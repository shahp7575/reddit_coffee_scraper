1okvlkv,https://www.reddit.com/r/22lr/comments/1okvlkv/purpose_of_human_life/,purpose of human life,"Practical Explanation ( For Example ) :- \`1st of all can you tell me every single seconds detail from that time when you born ?? ( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

1okvkri,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepypasta/comments/1okvkri/my_neighbor_told_me_to_stay_away_from_the_old/,My neighbor told me to stay away from the old house up the road. I should‚Äôve listened.,"I‚Äôve been buried in stress lately. Bills are stacking up, the mortgage is already past due, and the utilities are threatening shut-off. Then the factory I work at closed down and I lost my job. That was the gut-punch. I‚Äôve been walking around with this knot in my stomach for weeks, barely sleeping. But tonight isn‚Äôt about that.

Tonight is Halloween.

Andrea‚Äôs been buzzing around the porch all afternoon, hanging fake cobwebs and setting out bowls of candy. Kain‚Äôs costume is already laid out by the door‚Ä¶ he‚Äôs been so wound up he can hardly sit still. For the first time in months I actually feel excited.

We‚Äôre in a new house, in a new neighborhood, a small rural village‚Ä¶ maybe fifteen hundred people total. Quiet, tucked away from the world, the kind of place where the streetlights hum and the yards all smell like freshly fallen leaves.

When we stepped outside, Kain raced off the porch like a stock car, plastic pumpkin swinging at his side. Andrea laughed, pulling her coat tight. They both seemed so caught up in the magic of the night that the knot in the pit of my stomach went away, and for a moment it all felt normal and stress-free.

The sun had started to set‚Ä¶ not quite dark yet, but dim. The air was crisp, filled with the scent of fresh leaves and the sound of children laughing and screaming. We set off on our candy-filled journey. Everywhere we looked: witches, goblins, and ghosts, candy bags in hand, eagerly rushing door to door.

We made our way around the village square and surrounding blocks. Finally, with Kain‚Äôs plastic pumpkin almost full, we decided to turn onto the far end of our street. As we moved along, only a few porch lights remained, and the sound of children faded away. What was left was the shuffling of Kain‚Äôs feet in the dry leaves and the eerie cries of the wind.

We pushed on for another block, and that‚Äôs when I saw it. I stopped Kain before we walked up to it. Andrea tapped me on the shoulder.

‚ÄúDo you see that house? Looks like something out of a scary movie.‚Äù

I nodded. She wasn‚Äôt wrong. It was a modest two-story colonial, the sort you could picture your grandparents struggling to maintain in the historic part of town. Big screened-in porch, brick siding with vines and foliage climbing up to the roof. No car in the driveway. The front door hung half open, moving with the wind‚Ä¶ inviting, but wrong.

As we stood there, the air grew still. I noticed the front room didn‚Äôt have blinds, and the light inside was on. It was a decaying room on full display‚Ä¶ crumbling sheetrock walls giving way to exposed slats. The most unsettling part was the lone wooden dining chair, staged in the center of the room directly under a solitary hanging bulb. I wanted to look away, but I couldn‚Äôt.

‚ÄúLet‚Äôs get out of here before Leatherface storms out,‚Äù Andrea whispered in my ear.

I agreed, and we set back off down the road toward home, the sound of candy rattling in Kain‚Äôs bucket as he grinned.

That night we sat watching scary movies together, snuggled up on the couch, sorting through and snacking on this year‚Äôs candy cache. I couldn‚Äôt shake that house from my mind, though. Every time I closed my eyes, all I saw was that chair, positioned as if waiting for an unlucky guest.

‚ÄúIs everything okay? You seem distant.‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôm fine. I just can‚Äôt get that damn house out of my head. That chair‚Ä¶ and what the hell, the front door just flapping open like that?‚Äù

‚ÄúIt was weird, but we‚Äôre home now,‚Äù Andrea said.

I looked over at Kain; he was happy as a pig in mud, snacking on a full-size chocolate bar.

I suppose I should have been happy. Andrea had the night off work and Kain was still caught up in the magic of Halloween.

‚ÄúWant a piece of candy, Dad?‚Äù

‚ÄúSure, bud. But after this piece let‚Äôs put it up for the night, yeah?‚Äù

‚ÄúBut‚Ä¶ but why?‚Äù

‚ÄúBecause you don‚Äôt need to be up late bouncing off the walls.‚Äù

‚ÄúBesides, your face is starting to look like you ate a tub of candy,‚Äù his mother told him, smiling that proud, motherly smile from ear to ear.

‚ÄúYeah, what your mother said,‚Äù I quipped.

The evening was coming to a close. The sound of crickets struggled to cut through the eerie autumn breeze that carried the smell of burning leaves and pumpkin with it.

I looked down at my watch‚Ä¶ 10 p.m. Out of the corner of my eye, I saw Kain passed out, drooling, curled into Andrea‚Äôs arms. She was sleeping too.

‚ÄúLet‚Äôs go to bed. It‚Äôs been a long day,‚Äù I said as I prodded her awake.

She responded with incoherent mumbles as she stood up. I picked up Kain, careful not to wake him, and hauled all forty pounds of his tiny frame up the stairs to his room, tripping over his collection of toy guns and almost falling face-first into his dresser. I laid him down and tucked him under his dinosaur blanket.

I stood there for a moment, watching him gracefully snooze, wondering to myself‚Ä¶ how did I possibly get this lucky? How does a screw-up like me end up with such a beautiful family?

That‚Äôs when it hit me‚Äîimmense guilt rushed over me like a typhoon.

I‚Äôm letting them down. I‚Äôm half the man I‚Äôm supposed to be. You‚Äôre not providing anything. You‚Äôre going to lose it all if you don‚Äôt figure something out. They‚Äôd be better off without you.

The kind of thoughts your brain screams when you‚Äôre a father to an amazing child and husband to a beautiful woman, but you‚Äôre failing financially.

Wandering to my room through the dark hallway, I felt so defeated. Taking off my clothes and climbing into bed next to Andrea, who was already asleep, was a welcome relief. I closed my eyes. There it was, clear as day‚Äîthe chair.

I woke up feeling like I hadn‚Äôt slept at all. My head was heavy, my chest tight, and I was drenched in sweat. Sunlight leaked through the blinds‚Ä¶ warm and ordinary, a nice change of pace from the dream I‚Äôd had.

Kain‚Äôs cartoons were already blasting from downstairs, Andrea moving around in the kitchen. The smell of coffee and bacon cut through the house. It should have been comforting. Instead, I felt like I was dragging chains just getting out of bed.

When I shuffled into the kitchen, Andrea looked up from the pan, raising an eyebrow.

‚ÄúJesus, you look like hell,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúRough night?‚Äù

‚ÄúYeah‚Ä¶ just a dream,‚Äù I muttered, reaching for the coffee. My hands still shook. How could I tell her about finding Kain cold and blue in his bed? About the sound the fireplace poker made when it struck her? I didn‚Äôt want to tell her about the sickening way her left eye bulged from its socket, as if the bone gave way and tried to spit it out of her face. And I sure as hell didn‚Äôt tell her how it ended‚Äîwith me covered in blood, sitting down in that chair, shard of glass in hand, slicing my own throat.

‚ÄúWell, that‚Äôs behind you now. Get some breakfast, you‚Äôll feel better,‚Äù she insisted.

‚ÄúThank you. Not just for breakfast‚Ä¶ for everything you do. I love you.‚Äù

‚ÄúMust have been some dream. I love you too.‚Äù

I drained the rest of my dark roast, hoping the bitterness would clear the fog in my head. Failed attempt. Andrea was humming at the stove, Kain glued securely to the TV. For a second I thought I could let it go‚Ä¶ pretend the night never happened, convince myself the dream wasn‚Äôt still crawling under my skin.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm gonna go check the mail,‚Äù I told her, and made my way to the door.

When I stepped outside, the air was sharp, colder than yesterday, and the smell of burning leaves clung to the air like a dense seasonal fog. Dead leaves crunched under the soles of my bare feet as I made my way down the driveway. I reached the mailbox and reached in‚Äîempty.

‚ÄúBetter than another delinquent notice,‚Äù I muttered to myself.

‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs that?‚Äù I heard a familiar voice say.

I looked up‚Äîit was Steve, my neighbor, standing in his yard, a cigarette hanging from his lips.

‚ÄúNothing, just mumbling to myself,‚Äù I replied as I shuffled through the leaves in his direction.

‚ÄúHow was your first Halloween in the village?‚Äù he asked, taking a drag.

‚ÄúWasn‚Äôt too shabby. Kain had a blast.‚Äù

‚ÄúGood!‚Äù  
‚ÄúYou lived here your whole life?‚Äù

‚ÄúBorn and bred.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou know anything about the big old house a few blocks up the road? Whoever lives there sure cranked up the creep factor last night.‚Äù

‚ÄúThe one three blocks up with the overgrown siding?‚Äù He had a curious look.

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs the one. It was unnerving‚Ä¶ door swinging open like it was daring me to enter. There was a dining chair placed under a hanging bulb, looking right out into the yard.‚Äù

He looked at me like I had antlers growing out of my head before saying, ‚ÄúThat place has been vacant since I was a kid.‚Äù

‚ÄúAre you sure?‚Äù I asked.

He had the most bewildered look on his face, eyes wide with curiosity. ‚ÄúYeah, I‚Äôm sure. My best friend lived there.‚Äù

‚ÄúWell, shit. It seemed like someone was home last night,‚Äù I thought to myself. ‚ÄúWhy‚Äôs it been empty so long?‚Äù

I could see the discomfort in Steve‚Äôs eyes. Through clenched teeth he explained, ‚ÄúAbout twenty-five years ago my friend and his family lived there. Then my friend died.‚Äù

‚ÄúCancer?‚Äù I asked.

‚ÄúI wish. His dad snapped and killed him and his mom‚Ä¶ then killed himself right there in the front room. It‚Äôs been empty ever since.‚Äù

‚ÄúJesus‚Ä¶ what happened?‚Äù

‚ÄúWell, my friend‚Äôs dad had lost his job and was under a lot of stress, and he just snapped. Nobody saw it coming. Up until that night he was a solid guy‚Ä¶ a real pillar of the community. Took the whole village by surprise.‚Äù

‚ÄúFuck‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm sorry, man.‚Äù

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs okay. It was a long time ago.‚Äù

Even though he said it was fine, pain clearly washed over his face as he told the story. We exchanged small talk and pleasantries for a few moments, but the mood had definitely soured. Just then I caught Andrea looking out the window, and I took it as my chance to weasel out of the awkward conversation.

‚ÄúWell, looks like the wife needs me,‚Äù I said nervously.

‚ÄúNo problem, man. Good talk.‚Äù He chuckled. ‚ÄúHey, Mike.‚Äù

I turned around. ‚ÄúYeah?‚Äù

Steve looked rattled, almost nervous. ‚ÄúJust‚Ä¶ let the house lie.‚Äù

I shuffled my way back through the leaves toward the house. I tried to put it out of my mind, but it ate at me all day.

Later that night I lay down and tried to get some sleep. I figured it might help get the house out of my head. I put on a movie and slowly started to drift away.

That familiar, terrifying feeling of free-falling hit me‚Ä¶ falling to sleep, literally. When I landed on the other side of consciousness, I was in that chair. I looked down and there was a notebook in my lap and a pistol resting on top of it.

I grabbed the gun and opened the notebook. The smell of pennies was so thick in the air I could not only taste it but feel it, like a thin layer of filth coating my tongue. When I flipped through the notebook, it had one sentence frantically scribbled over and over again:

‚ÄúTogether, Forever.‚Äù

I wanted to stand up and run out of the house, but my legs wouldn‚Äôt move. Then, without any effort or control on my part, my arm raised the gun to my mouth. I couldn‚Äôt stop it. I was powerless‚Äîmerely a spectator to whatever spectacle I‚Äôd been given a front-row seat to. Then, as suddenly as I‚Äôd fallen asleep, the barrel was in my mouth. I clenched down on it so hard I felt and heard my teeth breaking. The taste of cold steel, gun oil, and blood was overwhelming.

Bang.

Suddenly I woke up in bed beside Andrea, the smell of gunsmoke heavy in my nose.

¬†

¬†

I stared vacantly, light bleeding through the blinds, illuminating the room.

‚ÄúWhat the fuck is happening to me?‚Äù

In that moment, I decided the only way to get to the bottom of it was to get inside that damn house. It was like a cancer growing inside me, festering quietly, and I needed to cut it out.

Andrea could tell something was wrong, but she didn‚Äôt ask.

‚ÄúGood morning, butthead. I love you.‚Äù

I told her that while getting lost in those beautiful brown eyes. I could honestly stare into them for hours.

‚ÄúI love you too,‚Äù she said, smiling that gorgeous smile.

I got up and walked downstairs, took a piss, and hit the kitchen.

Kain was there‚Ä¶ dining chair dragged up to the counter‚Ä¶ raiding the cabinet for his candy stash.

‚ÄúNo cereal this morning, bud?‚Äù

He must not have realized I was there, because he jumped hard enough to nearly fall.

‚ÄúGeez, Dad, you jump-scared me. I was just looking for my candy.‚Äù

‚ÄúDo you really need all that sugar? You‚Äôre jumpy enough as it is.‚Äù

Andrea snuck up behind me, wrapped her arms around my neck, and leaned in close. Her voice came out soft against my ear.

‚ÄúLet him. It only comes once a year.‚Äù

She kissed the back of my neck and went to the fridge.

She was right. How could I tell him no?

‚ÄúOkay‚Äîbut if he starts acting like a spazz, you‚Äôre dealing with it.‚Äù

We went about the day like usual, though my head was somewhere else. Today I was plotting my next move‚Ä¶ getting into that damn house.

Later that night, around eight, I tucked Kain into bed and put on his favorite movie‚Äî*Jurassic World.* I told Andrea I needed to grab a few things from the store, but that was a lie. I had a more pressing matter to deal with.

I grabbed the truck keys and stepped outside.

It was cold‚Ä¶ not the kind of cool you expect in fall, but a sharp, bitter chill that sank straight to the bone.

The street was dead silent. The sound of leaves crunching beneath my boots was deafening in the still air. The wind picked up as I reached for the truck door, letting out hollow whooshes and low whistles, almost like the air itself was warning me. Whispering things I didn‚Äôt want to hear.

I ignored them.

The engine turned over and roared to life, echoing down the empty street. I drove toward the house that had been rotting in my mind like an infected wound.

I parked a few houses down and killed the lights.

As soon as I stepped out, it hit me‚Äîanxiety, dread, melancholy‚Äîall washing over me like a storm I couldn‚Äôt brace against.

I walked toward the house, scanning for a way in. An upstairs light was on, faint and flickering.

The screen door hung ajar, creaking in the breeze. The whole place seemed to breathe around me. Every board, every nail‚Ä¶ it all watched.

The hair on the back of my neck stood up. My arms went cold.

That‚Äôs when it happened.

A desperate, ear-shattering scream tore through the quiet from somewhere inside.

I froze.

Then, slowly, the front door creaked open, like it was inviting me in.

I didn‚Äôt think‚ÄîI just ran.

The moment I crossed the threshold, everything changed. The air turned still. Heavy. Wrong. The screaming stopped. The silence that followed wasn‚Äôt peaceful‚Ä¶ it was alive.

The scream died the moment I crossed the threshold.  
Air thickened. Damp. Metallic.

The bulb above the chair flicked to life with a buzz, spilling jaundiced light across the floor.

The chair waited, dead center of the room.

The notebook sat open on the seat, pages fluttering in the stillness.

A pen leaned in the fold, ink trembling at the tip like sweat.

Something bright lay half-buried in dust near my boot.

I bent to pick it up, thinking maybe trash, but the curve of orange plastic stopped me cold.

The little pumpkin bucket had a jagged crack through its grin; candy wrappers stuck inside it like dried tongues.

For a second I convinced myself it wasn‚Äôt his‚Ä¶ just another kid‚Äôs. There were thousands like it.

Then I saw the handle‚Ä¶ bound with a strip of black electrical tape, the same fix I‚Äôd made after he dropped it on the sidewalk.

My stomach turned. The bucket slipped from my hand and rolled against the wall with a hollow knock.

The house sighed above me.

Weight shifted. One slow step. Another.

Something soft brushed my leg on the stair. A gray sleeve, limp, trailing the first step.

I touched it before I realized what it was. The fabric was still warm from skin.

Andrea‚Äôs hoodie.

The smell of her‚Äîpowder and smoke‚Äîrose off it in a thin wave that hit me like a memory trying to claw its way out.

I dropped it and kept climbing, but the scent followed, clinging to the back of my throat.

The air grew heavier.

Every breath whistled in my chest.

Paint stuck to my palm.

Halfway up, a warm drop struck the back of my hand.

I froze.

A darker patch spread along the ceiling joist, threads running toward the wall.

The smell of iron filled my mouth.

At the landing, the hallway stretched wrong‚Äîdoors pulled farther apart than they should be.

Only one showed light, a thin golden wedge along the floorboards.

I moved toward it.

The smell was stronger here.

Sweet rot, undercut by something electric.

I pushed the door open.

The bedroom glared too bright.

Curtains drawn, air unmoving, the light a bleached, buzzing color that hurt to look at.

Sheets tangled on the bed. A nightstand overturned.

Andrea lay in the center of the mattress.

Blood soaked through her blouse, the fabric stiff and dark. Her face‚ÄîChrist‚Äîher face was half-collapsed, jaw slack as if unhinged. Most of her front teeth were gone. Her left eye bulged unnaturally from the socket, pushing forward like something inside was still straining to get out.

Then it hit me.

The memory.

The struggle.

Me gripping the fireplace poker so tight my knuckles turned white.

The first swing landed across her mouth with a wet crunch, scattering teeth like seeds.

The next was duller‚Ä¶ thicker.

The third cracked through bone, and she fell back into the pillow, soundless.

I backed away from the bed, one hand over my mouth, bile rising fast.

¬†

I staggered from the room, stumbling through the hallway that seemed to breathe with me.

Halfway down, another door stood slightly ajar‚Ä¶ smaller, painted blue, stickers peeling from its surface.

I hesitated, hand hovering over the knob. The air leaking from the gap was cold, carrying the faint smell of dust and rot.

I pushed it open.

It was a child‚Äôs room. Toys lay scattered across the rug, the walls faded with outlines where posters once hung. A toy car lay on the floor near the bed, wheels still spinning from the vibration of my steps, ticking softly in the quiet.

A small bed sat against the far wall. Kain was laying face down, the comforter was soaked red and stiff, his arm outstretched towards the door as if he tried to escape.

Then it hit me...

The memory tore through like a fever‚Äîhis eyes widening, confusion breaking into fear, his voice shaking when he asked what I was doing.

The weight of the poker in my hands.

The snap of noise, the silence that followed, the last sound he made before everything went still.

And the way he tried to run.

My stomach turned. The air felt wrong, hot and sour.

I staggered back, vomit rising before I could fight it, spilling across the floorboards.

The acid taste burned my throat, mixing with the smell of iron and ash that clung to the room.

I wiped my mouth with a shaking hand, gasping, vision swimming.

I stumbled into the hallway, walls closing in on both sides.

The wallpaper brushed my arm, leaving red streaks where my fingers touched.

Downstairs, the bulb hummed louder‚Ä¶ calling.

The chair was waiting when I reached the bottom.

The notebook had turned its own page. Fresh ink pressed deep enough to score, to almost tear the page.

Together, forever.

I sank to my knees.

‚ÄúNo,‚Äù I whispered. ‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt bring them here.‚Äù

The house exhaled through the walls‚Äîa low groan that felt almost like laughter.

Beside the candy bucket, half hidden in shadow, lay the gun.

I picked it up without thinking.

It was warm. Familiar.

I sat.

The chair gave a long, tired sigh.

Upstairs, something shifted.

One small creak of the mattress.

 - photography & creative stuff
 - actually getting work done (and then chilling after)

About me (no overshare, promise):

What I‚Äôm hoping for:
 - Casual meetups (public places, obviously) to chat ideas, swap skills, and keep each other accountable
 - Weekend mini-adventures: photo walks, stable visits, co-working sessions, maybe a tiny sprint to build something together
 - A chill, positive circle where we push each other without ego

Who should join?
Students, junior devs, scrappy founders, new photographers, self-taught anything, or anyone curious and kind. Experience level doesn‚Äôt matter‚Äîenergy does.

Everything You Didn't Know About Free Funding for Your Ministry,"I know what you're thinking. You've seen the headlines. ""Free money for churches."" Yeah, right. That's got to be a scam, right? And if it's not a scam, it's probably a bait-and-switch, right?

You're smart to be skeptical. I won't deny that. The thing is, church grants are absolutely real, and they're being awarded to thousands of ministries across the country. The bait and switch is that most churches don't know how to get them or don't think they can qualify for them.

So today, let's clear up the myths and misunderstandings. We're going to talk about what church grants actually are, how they work, and whether your ministry can access this source of funding.

# What Exactly are Church Grants?

Think of church grants as financial gifts to your ministry from various organizations, foundations or even the government. These organizations want to help you with your religious and community-building work.

The trick? Church grants are not loans, which you have to pay back with interest. They're not donations from your congregants, which have to be budgeted and fundraised fresh every year. Instead, they're like the institutional version of an individual giving you a donation.

Do you really think people offer you money on the street just because you ask them for help? The only difference is, the million-dollar endowments are literally waiting for your ministry to find them. It's not like a weird free government money scam where someone offers you cash if you just fill out some weird form, ladies and gentlemen. It's real.

Major foundations like the Lilly Endowment, the United Methodist Foundation, and hundreds of others award millions of dollars for church and faith-based organization projects. And the thing to remember is that this money is already sitting there, waiting. The real question is, is your ministry going to get any?

# The Four Main Types of Church Grants

You probably know that not all church grants work the same way. Let me explain what's out there:

# 1. Denominational grants

If your church is part of a denomination, you've got an advantage. Almost every major denomination has grant programs for their member churches. The United Methodist Church, Presbyterian Church USA, Episcopal Church, and more have a denomination-wide grant program to fund particular projects.

What's the good news? Well, they already know and trust you because you're part of their family. The bad news? Application is competitive, and they usually have very specific guidelines about what they will fund.

# 2. Private foundation grants

And now, I'll say something exciting. Private foundations, those are community foundations, family foundations, corporate foundations, give out billions of dollars in grants every year. And a lot of them support faith-based community-based work.

No, you don't have to be their denomination, and maybe you've never even met them. But you'll have to show how your project feeds into their mission and serves the broader neighborhood.

# 3. Government grants for faith-based organizations

Believe it or not, churches can receive select government grants. This comes as a shock to some people, but after the Faith-Based Initiative expanded under President Bush, this moved through subsequent administrations.

The hitch? Well, you probably need a 501(c) designation, and you can't use the funds for religious activities. But community services, food pantries, recovery from addiction, and the like will work.

# 4. Corporate grants

Some corporations, particularly those who are highly involved in the community, have grant programs that include faith-based organizations. Home Depot, Walmart, and other big retailer funding has community benefits that churches across the country are utilizing.

# The Honest Truth About Church Grant Amounts

Now that we've laid out some church grant types, let's keep it real.

**Small grants ‚Äì $1,000-$5,000**

These are the most common and the easiest to get. They might come from local community foundations or small denominational programs. They are perfect for specific needs, such as equipment, small repairs, or program startup costs.

  
**2. Mid-size grants $5,000-$25,000**

These grants are competitive but achievable. They usually fund a significant ministry program, building improvements, or community outreach initiatives. Therefore, you will need to provide a solid application, details, and planning on how you will use the money.

**3. Large grants $25,000-$100,000+**

These exist, but they are too rare for small churches. Major foundations like Lilly Endowment give these grants, looking for innovative ministry programs, measurable community impact, and a strong organizing size.

However, what nobody tells you is that most churches that get grants do not hit a ""home run"" with one giant grant. Instead, they build funding through smaller grants from different sources.

# Why Most Churches Never See Grant Money

In other words, most churches that complain ""grants aren't real"" have not done the work to make sure and pursue them properly.

The biggest mistake I see is:

**1. Not having a 501(c)(3) letter**

Most grant funders require this; if you do not have it, stop what you are doing and get it. However, your church's religious exemption from taxes is not the same as a 501(c)(3) determination letter from the IRS.

**2. Writing terrible grant applications**

Telling a funder that you need money because your roof leaks is not compelling. But to say that the roof leak is preventing you from running your weekly community food program that serves 200 families ‚Äì you are now speaking their language.

**#3: Not following instructions**

Grant funders give you those maximum 3 pages for a reason. If they say ""maximum 3 pages"" and you submit 6, you're out. If they need a detailed budget and you send a rough estimate, you're over.

**#4: Only applying once and giving up**

Getting grants is like fishing ‚Äì you don't throw in one line and call it a day. Successful churches draft several grant sources and keep trying even when they get turned down.

# What You Actually Need to Qualify

* 501 c 3 tax-exempt status or a fiscal sponsorship through an organization that has it
* A clear mission statement that demonstrates community benefit beyond serving your members
* Basic financial documents ‚Äì at least your last year's budget and financial statements
* A project or program to fund it ‚Äì not just ""general operations"" or ""keep the lights on""
* Measurable outcomes ‚Äì how will you demonstrate the grant money made a difference?
* A history of doing what you say you're going to do

This last one becomes more essential as you go for larger grants. Small local grants are usually more lenient here.

# Where to Actually Find Real Church Grants

Okay, you're convinced grants are real. Now where do you find them?

**Start local**

Your community foundation is your new best friend. Every major city and many counties have community foundations that give grants to local nonprofits, even churches. Google "" \[ your city name \] community foundation"" and look at their website.

**Check your denomination**

If you're part of a denomination, get on their national website and look for ""grants"" or ""funding opportunities."" Call your regional office ‚Äì they often know about local funding sources, too.

**Use grant databases**

Foundation Directory Online, by Candid is the gold standard, but it costs money. Free alternatives include GrantWatch, GrantStation's free resources, and the Foundation Center's free services at local libraries.

**Look at local corporations**

That big employer in your town? They probably have a community giving program. It's usually on their website, under ""Corporate Responsibility"" or ""Community Relations.""

**Network with other churches**

So the one church down the street just renovated their fellowship hall? Ask them how they funded it. In my experience, churches that have won grants or other funding set out to help others learn the process.

# The Application Process

I'm not going to sugarcoat this ‚Äì applying for grants be successful is work. But it's possible, and it gets easier every time.

Most applications will demand the following:

* Your project's summary
* A detailed budget, along with every dollar you've allocated
* Your organization's resume and qualifications
* Goals and outcomes you can measure
* Letters of support from your community partners
* Your IRS letter of approval

**Time investment?** For your first grant application, schedule 10-20 hours. I know, that sounds like a lot ‚Äì but if those hours bring in $5,000, you can consider that you have ""earned"" about $250-$500 for each hour you've put in for the sake of your ministry. It was worth it.

**Pro tip:** if you write one decent grant, you can adapt the material for other possibilities. You're not rewriting this content from the beginning each time.

# Are There Grants for Building Projects?

So, yes ‚Äì this may be the most frequently asked question, and I'm going to address it.

Yes, there are building grants, but they're more challenging than program grants. Why? Because funders would rather give money to programs that serve people than to bricks and mortar.

""But,"" you say, ""we do need a new building!"" So, here's the hack: don't make it about the building; make it about the program. Instead of saying, ""we need a new church building,"" say, ""We have a community program that serves 200 kids every week, and we're outgrowing our space."" Connect the need for a building to ministry impact.

Capital campaign grants can be found at some denominational sources, local foundations that care about community infrastructure, and sometimes through government community development programs.

# What about church-planting grants?

Yes, church planting grants are a real thing and pretty standard, particularly through denominational venues. Church plants: I'm sorry to tell you this, but you're in luck; this is one of the only regions with adequate funding.

You can find church-planting grants in the following places:

* Your denomination's church planting network ‚Äì most denominations have one
* The North American Mission Board
* Acts 29 Network if you're Reformed
* Fresh Expressions
* Orchard Group

Church planting grants come with training, coaching, and networks ‚Äì not just money.

# The Grant Money That Doesn't Require Applications

Some church funding does not require formal approval. Let's talk about what's real and what's not when it comes to that.

# Red Flags: When ""Grants"" Aren't Real

All right, so when we're talking reality, let's talk:

**Run far, far away from anyone who's charging you money to apply for grants**

Apply for grant funds or cash prizes is always free. Now, the cost to have somebody else write the grant for you is a different issue which we will cover in a future guide ‚Äì and it can be worth it, but the cost to access grants and any regular application fee? No! It's a scam.

**Stay away from ""guaranteed grant"" promises**

Nobody can guarantee you'll get your grant. At all. Certainly not the best grant writer in the world on Frankie's morning coffee. Anyone promising you guaranteed funding is lying esp.

**Grants that are actually loans**

There are grants out there that are loans, and there are also loans out there that are improperly marketed grants. Make sure you read the fine print on anything you sign.

**Any unsolicited email that tells you you've been ""selected"" for a grant you didn't apply for**

That's just spam, guys, legitimate funders don't work this way.

# Is Your Church Ready to Pursue Grants?

Here are some more questions to ask yourself if your church is ready to do grants:

1. Do we have an adult who is paid or volunteers willing to spend the time to find and apply for grants?
2. Are we willing to track and report how we spent the grant money?
3. Can we write a description of how we impact our community that goes beyond showing up for church on Sundays?
4. Do we have (or can we get) our financial house in order well enough to be able to provide audited financials or other financial papers if asked?
5. Are we prepared to hear no multiple times before we hear yes once?

If you answered yes to most of these, let's go ahead and get started. If your answer is no to most of these, that's fine! Just work in these areas and come back to grant-seeking in a later year or after you have taken care of these items.

# Your Next Steps

So, that's what's real. Church grants are definitely real. What's next?

**This week** ‚Äì you need to find your 501c3 letter of determination or apply for a 501c3 with the IRS, or get a fiscal sponsor.

**Something in this month:** choose one specific project or program that you could fund with a grant. Describe it in more detail ‚Äì how much would it cost, who would it serve, how much good would it accomplish in your community?

**Within 90 days:** complete your first grant application process. I'd recommend starting small and local; funding from your community foundation or a denominational small grant program is realistic to receive for the first try.

Every church that manages to get grant funding also started at the same place where you are now; they were skeptical, had many doubts, and wondered if it's really worth the effort.

The difference between the churches that get the needed funding and those who do not get it isn't their luck or connections ‚Äì only some of them ever take action, while the others keep asking themselves if it's real.

can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

I thought fine, if he's so persistent he must be really into me and he looks decent and has a nice vibe too so why not give it a try? So after like a month or so of exchanging Instagrams, we finally actually start talking (early aug). We have an insane vibe match, great flirting and we soon go on a first date. The date goes great. A lot of exploring the city, laughing, flirting, he's making me blush, I'm making him blush, awesome banter etc. He kept clicking my pictures and calling me pretty and I'm like wow he's a genuinely nice guy. My friends disapproved of him btw, said he doesn't look good and ""I can't be seen outside with him""üò≠ But he is very very chalant which i loved and was a jacked nerd which is exactly my type.

Now, i don't let that stop me and go on a second date.  We went to mkt and while we're having a good time, two of my college classmates pop up at the table next to us while that guy and me we're kinda cozy and they spot me and say my name out loud. It was SOO EMBARASSING because they did not know that i had broken up with my ex 3 months ago since we had a vacation before the semester started and we obviously weren't in contact. THEY THOUGHT I WAS CHEATING üò≠üò≠ and I had to explain to them that I've broken up with my ex and that I'll speak to them later. We rush out of that restaurant and go elsewhere and had dessert there. We ended up having a deep conversation about what we look for in a partner, what were our deal breakers etc. It was going great so far. We pay the bill and step out and towards the door, i see my ex bestfriend.ü§°

I hold the guys hand and sprint us out of the bakery. We now decided to head to the mall and while going to the metro station, his colleague comes up to him. ATP I WAS SURE THE NEXT PERSON I SEE IS GOING TO BE A RELATIVE. lol. Now we head to the mall and he tries to kiss me in the metro elevator. I PULLED AWAY. Because why would someone try to kiss you for the first time in a metro elevator that opens in 10 seconds??? It got a little awkward after that but the awkwardness faded out after like 15-20 minutes. We ended the date by getting coffee and talking some more and listening to music with wired earphones. It was cute. I was happy.

Now we're talking on hour long calls, texting everyday, giving mundane life updates everyday, i started liking all of this.
Then came the third date. He lives with his flatmates in the outskirts (ncr) because of his job so he invited me home and we had built up enough chemisty for me to say yes now. Rare occasion. I go to his place, i took flowers, he cooks me food, we watch 2brokegirls, do stuff, listen to music and we had a lot of fun. He drops me at the metro station and I get back home. 

We have now entered october. 
Now comes dussehra and he goes to his hometown for that. Things are busy and we aren't able to plan another date because the first weekend he's at home, second weekend he has plans, third weekend was diwali. and also my birthday (18th). he had a train on my birthday and i decided to celebrate by throwing a girl's sleepover on 17th night because there was another festival on the 18th. Now we had this thing where we like diabolical reels on ig and then reply to each other's likes in a banter. He had liked a reel that said ""when I'm about to lock in but then i remember who's ovulating"" and i replied to that with the eyes emoji. we have a conversation over it and i say ""i wonder if that was for me tho"" and that mf proceeds to say ""valid doubtü§£"" and i get so pissed. I don't do casuals and he knew that. I said don't waste my time if that's the case and he says ""if what's the case???"" Now i was PISSED. I held onto my cool and calmly said ""if you've got a roster, go play but out of my dms"" to which he very casually says ""to think I'd have the time to maintain a rosterüò≠"" and i was like "" i don't have one reason to believe that"" and that mf goes ""i can say the same about you"" LIKE?!?! i ask him ""literally how???"" he ignores the question and the conversation takes another route. Now it's around 10 pm on 17th and my friends have come, we're getting ready and I'm not on my phone. Around 12:15, he comes up and wishes me ""Happy birthday babygirl i hope you're having fun"" no emojis, no extra letters, i felt bad but i still thanked him as soon as i saw that text. He had started telling me whenever he had plans so i assumed he didn't have any tonight since he has a train to catch tomorrow morning but boy was i wrong. It's now 5 am, I'm absolutely down in the dumps drunk, we proceed to the kitchen to make maggi where i pick up my phone to make a snap vlog for memories and i see he has uploaded a story on snap, which has never happened so far and my first thought was that it must've been an accident cuz it has happened to me a lot. I open the story and it's some club, the camera rotates and he's there at a diwali party in a kurta with a dupatta around his neck, two girls are standing next to him, he turns his head and kisses the girl. Now mind you i was absolutely trashed here. I screenrecorded that story, removed him from my snap and my private account and text him on whatsapp. one single word. ""asshole."" he doesn't reply, OBVIOUSLY, he had no defence. Later that day, around 8 pm i post my birthday pictures on my main account and as you would've guessed, i get a text back (the screenshot) Bro wasn't sorry. Bro didn't regret kissing her, bro only felt bad about kissing her on camera. So obviously I, never replied to that text. his ego gets hurt since I'm not begging for him now and he puts up a reel on his story that says ""the lion doesn't drink so he doesn't remember, the lion drinks so everyone remembers"" it pissed me off and posted a story on that audio ""whatever makes you feel better"" with the caption ""whatever makes you feel manlyü•∞"" i knew i got his ego. he then proceeded to post a story with the girl he had kissed in the video and hid her face with a song OFC. But me being the silly little detective that i am, found that girl in his following and also found her private acc so he definitely didn't just meet her in the club. I got so confused thinking if i should text the girl warning her because what if she was his girlfriend and he cheated on her with me?? But then that girl didn't repost his story so i thought maybe not lol. Anyways, why are men like this?? I straight up asked him if he was seeing other people and he dodged it and proceeded to give me the best birthday gift possible. GOOD RIDDANCE. 


TLDR; My situationship cheated on me on my birthday after I clearly asked him if he was seeing other people and he dodged that question.  ",1,1761919269.0,Situationships,0,1.0,False

Anyway!

Back in March I dated someone who I never posted. I may have tagged her in a photo of some food or a random item, like a coffee mug‚Ä¶ Literally like TWICE. Anyway, she & I blocked each other on IG ages ago. We don‚Äôt have any mutual friends or tagged photos.

My current ex gf, who has been blocked on IG forever now (she went back to her ex & started dating others), somehow found out YESTERDAY who my March ex is when I mentioned her name is Shelby. I literally only said ‚ÄúShelby‚Äù & BAM, she found the girl‚Äôs first & last name‚Ä¶ found out the girl lives in MN & even found out she drives a jeep üòÖ

NONE of us are connected, we all live in different states and have never shared the same friend group. Any stories I posted of Shelby were back in March & of random things, not of her. 

I searched myself on an anonymous website to check my likes to see if Shelby somehow popped up, despite our mutual blocking.

NADA! How tf did my current ex find Shelby when I haven‚Äôt had anything tagged of her person, ever, and when I tagged things like a coffee cup, her IG handle was tiny and that was back in fricken MARCH, when my now ex was elsewhere, blocked & dating others.

1okvdif,https://www.reddit.com/r/exmormon/comments/1okvdif/my_testimony_of_coffee/,My Testimony... Of Coffee,"Good Morning Brothers and Sisters, 

I'm so happy to be here this morning checking into my favorite subreddit.  I'm grateful today for all the little things in my life, and I just want to share a quick testimony with you.  

I'm grateful today for coffee.  Coffee is delicious.  I didn't always understand the draw.  In my youth I was raised to believe that coffee would condemn me to a life without my family.  I once heard a woman say that ""one little cup of coffee"" would essentially separate me from eternal life.  As it turns out, that idea, like so many others I learned in the first three chapters of my life, is complete and utter horse shit.    

Several years ago I was essentially brainwashed to be anti-coffee, but I wouldn't hesitate to  easily drink copious amounts of soda that then morphed into consumption of energy drinks without even skipping a beat.  There were days I would drink four energy drinks a day!  I yearned for them, I spent $10 a day on them, and they left me jittery.  

When I finally departed the culture that warped my view on so many things, I delved into coffee.  It was bitter!  Yuck!  But my culture had tainted my tastes with a deep need for sugar and sweets, and the only way I could even first enjoy coffee was heaped with heavy creamers and tons of sugar, which I still enjoyed.  As I have progressed further and further from the tenets and practices of a high-demand fringe faith group, my tastes have matured.  My actual taste-buds have changed.  I eat less sugar, which is an unexpected result of leaving that faith, and I have found that I rather enjoy black coffee - no cream or sugar.

Now, mind you, I still like my coffee with a couple of ice cubes so I don't burn my tongue every morning, but wow, I really, really enjoy black coffee.  The taste is wonderful.  The taste of different beans is rich and different.  The manner of roasting changes things.  It is so varied and exciting.  The energy it gives me feels cleaner and more even in my body.  I don't crash every afternoon.  I haven't developed horrible stomach ulcers from tannic acid, (yes I used to preach that on the streets of the mission field), and I am saving money daily.  Most importantly, I personally enjoy it, it is hurting no one, and it is not fringe or evil behavior that is condemned by those around me.  (I don't live in Utah, so my partaking of coffee is seen as normal, not *peculiar*).    

I testify to you that black coffee works for me.  It might not work for you, nor am I here to try and convert you.  I just thought I would share that I feel better mentally and physically when I enjoy a cup, and I have no worry about my eternal welfare.  Black coffee is wonderful.  For those of you who might be wondering, my go-to is the Aldi Honduras whole bean medium roast beans, ground in a little $20 electric grinder my kitchen, and made in a $35 Mr. Coffee machine.  I'm so fancy.  \*sip\*

The moment my brother-in-law's funeral ended, Damien was swarmed by reporters.

He removed his sunglasses, his voice low and controlled:

""My brother's gone. His widow is pregnant and needs care. As family, I have to step up.""

Camera flashes exploded. I could already write the headlines myself:

\[The Rock Bad Boy's Tender Side?\]

\[Family Duty, or Forbidden Love?\]

My name is Amelia Wallis. I'm not just his wife‚ÄîI've been his publicist for years.

Every scandal‚Äîbackstage brawls, DUI rumors, compromising photos with supermodels‚ÄîI've cleaned up every single one.

But this time, he lit a fire I can't put out.

The day after the funeral, Daisy moved in.

The first week, she kept quiet. By the second week, she started appearing in every crack and crevice.

‚ÄîShe brought him vitamin drinks, saying, ""The tour's exhausting. You need to keep your energy up.""

‚ÄîAt dinner, she'd cough softly and ask him to tell her about his stage stories.

‚ÄîLate at night, she claimed heart palpitations and insisted he come to her room, said she could only fall asleep if he hummed a melody for her.

I'm no outsider to this game.

I'm a top-tier publicist. I know exactly what ""branding"" and ""strategic positioning"" look like.

Her fragility, her dependence‚Äîit's all carefully calculated.

And Damien‚Äî

He actually bought it.

He'd gently advise her, ""Try lying on your side. It'll be more comfortable.""

He even reached out to brush the hair from her face.

That moment, my chest tightened like a vice.

Five years ago, I gave up my seat on the family board, chose to marry the rock world's ""bad boy,"" and became his dedicated publicist.

I thought I'd be the exception.

Now I understand‚Äîin his eyes, a pregnant sister-in-law is worth more protection than I am.

Late that night, I called my father from the study.

""Dad. I want a divorce.""

...

""Amelia, what happened?"" My father, a businessman worth hundreds of millions, asked with concern.

I told him everything that had been happening.

From being forced out of the master bedroom, to the late-night recording studio sessions, to Damien's tender ""it'll be more comfortable""...

These fragments cut into my heart like knives, one slice at a time.

For five years of marriage, I'd tried my absolute best to be the perfect wife.

I'd stayed by his side from dive bar gigs to world tour stages.

I'd smoothed over countless negative press stories, whitewashing his ""reckless libertine"" image into ""rock star authenticity.""

I learned to be quiet, learned to bow my head, kept all my edges hidden backstage.

But what did I get in return? Neglect and dismissal.

He gave all his best patience and tenderness to another woman.

When I finished, my father's voice turned cold as ice. ""Amelia, I support you. The Franklin Band's tour funding? That's all Wallis money. I can pull it anytime. Just make whatever decision you want.""

I hung up, feeling an unprecedented calm.

Probably because I'd been disappointed for so long, I was already prepared for the end.

I looked at my haggard reflection in the mirror.

These years, I'd given everything to this marriage and almost forgotten who I used to be.

But starting now, things are going to change.

That night, I slept in the study.

The next morning, I walked into the kitchen.

Daisy was already there.

She was wearing Damien's stage jacket.

That red leather jacket with tour embroidery‚ÄîI'd designed it myself, given it to him as a gift.

Every encore, he'd wear it on stage to thunderous applause.

Now it hung loose on her frame, unable to hide her swollen belly.

She hummed Damien's signature song while casually brewing coffee.

When she saw me, she smiled slightly, as if nothing had happened.

""Good morning, Amelia. Didn't sleep well? I heard you spent the night in the study.""

I stared at that jacket, a dull pain throbbing in my chest.

My voice came out cold and flat. ""Take it off.""

Her smile froze, her eyes flickering.

""What... what?""

""I said, take off the jacket.""

My tone was the same one I used in PR meetings to terminate a contract‚Äîcold and non-negotiable.

Chapter 2

Her eyes darted around, playing innocent. ""I just threw it on... I thought it was fine.""

Just then, Damien walked in.

He saw Daisy fumbling with the jacket zipper, and his face darkened instantly.

""Amelia! What are you doing? She's pregnant, can't you see that? She needs stability!""

I laughed coldly. ""Of course I see. But what I see more clearly is her wearing your stage jacket‚Äîthe one that belongs only to you‚Äîbrewing coffee in my kitchen.""

""It's just a jacket!""

Damien stepped forward and grabbed my arm, trying to calm me down. ""Can you be rational? She's pregnant, her emotions are unstable. You should be understanding.""

""Rational?"" I shook off his hand, my voice sharp as a blade. ""Damien, last night when you stayed up until dawn humming songs to comfort her, where was your rationality? You're not her husband!""

The air froze.

Daisy immediately teared up, as if she were the victim.

""It's all my fault. I shouldn't have put you in this position...""

She whispered tremulously, placing her hand on his arm in a pitiful gesture.

Damien instinctively moved to shield her, glaring at me over her shoulder. ""Look what you've driven her to!""

My heart felt like it was being torn apart. Five years of restraint and compromise crumbled in that instant.

My voice came out cold and final. ""If that's how it is, then go ahead and fulfill your responsibility. We're getting divorced.""

Damien froze for a moment, then laughed‚Äîa ridiculous, grating sound. ""Divorce? Stop being dramatic. What do you want? A new car? Jewelry? A PR contract you can't even handle? Name it, I'll give you anything.""

Daisy drew in a shaky breath, tears streaming down her face. ""Stop fighting... I'll leave. It's all my fault.""

She took a step back, like a wounded animal.

Just as she'd calculated, Damien immediately grabbed her arm, his voice urgent. ""Don't talk nonsense. You're not going anywhere.""

I'd had enough. The crack in my heart finally shattered completely.

""If she's not leaving, I am.""

My voice was cold and firm, like a verdict. ""I'll have my lawyer draft the papers. Property division, the house‚Äî"" I paused, my eyes sharp as knives. ""You should know, the Franklin Band's funding has always been controlled by the Wallis family. I won't lose to you.""

Damien's face changed instantly, his voice dropping to a growl. ""Amelia! Stop this. Divorce? Not happening!""

I met his eyes, my tone icy, as if announcing an irrevocable judgment:

""This is a ruling, not a negotiation.""

Chapter 3

I went back to the bedroom and started packing, stripping off the conservative, drab clothes I'd been wearing.

I pulled out the style I used to love.

No longer the understated, shadow-like rock star's wife.

The woman in the mirror had crimson lips, precise eye makeup, and chestnut brown waves cascading down.

I put on a blue slip dress with a black leather jacket over it.

Sharp, bold, distinctly individual.

For the first time in five years, I dressed like myself again.

I made a call.

""I need a drink.""

At the bar, the lighting was moody, deep rock music vibrating through the floor. The air smelled of whiskey and cigarettes.

Bella‚Äîmy most trusted friend, we'd grown up together.

She looked me up and down, a smile playing on her lips.

""Now that's the woman I know. Not some socialite buried by marriage.""

I tilted my head back, downing the liquor in one gulp. My throat burned like fire.

""Pathetic, isn't it? I gave up my board position, gave up the Wallis family's billions, all for Damien. Five years, I put out fires, covered up scandals, whitewashed his 'bad boy' image into 'rock legend.' And for what? My sacrifice wasn't worth even a thank you.""

Bella tapped her glass lightly, her gaze sharp. ""Stop calling it pathetic. You were born for center stage, not to be his backdrop. Come back, Amelia. A Wallis daughter shouldn't be cowering in some rock star's shadow.""

I curved my lips, a long-absent edge flashing in my eyes. ""I will.""

Bella's gaze shifted, her voice dropping meaningfully.

""But... have you considered that the child might actually be Damien's?""

The glass slipped from my hand, liquor splashing across the table.

My heart clenched.

""Impossible."" I shook my head, but my voice was so weak even I didn't believe it.

Since Daisy moved in, Damien's behavior had grown increasingly abnormal.

All his patience, all his tenderness, poured into her.

And she... every look, every word, was so precisely calculated it made you suspicious.

That child... could it really be his?

I drank glass after glass until the world started spinning. My last memory was of a tall figure bursting into the bar, his voice low and furious.

""Amelia!""

Damien.

He walked over wearing a hat and mask, scooping me up from the booth, his movements rough and urgent.

""Have you lost your mind? Drinking like this here‚Äîif the paparazzi catch you, do you know what that would mean?!""

I struggled desperately, not wanting him to touch me. But the alcohol made my limbs feel like cotton. I couldn't break free, could only be carried away.

His scent was familiar, yet more searing than the liquor.

I closed my eyes, a tearing pain surging through my chest.

...

The next morning.

My head pounded. I was still wearing last night's clothes. I stumbled downstairs, freezing at the scene in the living room.

Daisy sat in the center of the sofa, looking completely at ease, as if this were her home.

I suddenly noticed the cushions on the sofa, the decorations on the table‚Äîso many things had changed, things I'd never seen before.

She turned to look at me, her eyes gleaming with amusement. ""You're finally awake. Damien was so worried about you last night, carrying you all the way to the bedroom.""

She stroked her belly, her tone full of provocation. ""You really should learn to depend on him.""

I stared at her, laughing coldly. ""Depend on him? What gives you the right to lecture me?""

Her expression shifted slightly, but she still maintained her fragile act. ""I just... don't want to see your marriage fall apart.""

I stepped closer, my voice low but vicious. ""Cut the act. Don't forget, you're living here on charity. Yet here you sit on this sofa putting on airs like you own the place. If you really didn't want our marriage to fall apart, you'd get the hell out of this house right now.""

Chapter 4

Without waiting for her response, I went back to the bedroom to pack.

I pulled open the closet and threw my suitcase on the floor with a heavy thud.

The sound of the zipper closing was like a marriage's death knell.

All these years, I'd changed for Damien‚Äîconservative dresses, dark-colored suits, all left hanging in the closet.

I only packed the things that truly belonged to ""Amelia Wallis.""

Until I pulled open a drawer and my fingers froze.

Empty.

The necklace was gone.

It was the Wallis family's only heirloom, worn by generations of women.

My mother had pressed it into my hand on her deathbed, her voice trembling but firm:

""Amelia, this is the mark of a Wallis daughter. No matter who you marry, remember, you'll always be family blood.""

And now, it was gone.

I practically tore apart the entire cabinet but couldn't find it.

A cold premonition rose in my chest.

I rushed downstairs.

In the living room, Daisy sat leisurely, Damien beside her.

They were extremely close, and around her neck‚Äîthat necklace.

Sunlight fell on the necklace, the familiar pattern making my breath catch.

My voice shook with cold. ""Take it off.""

She paused, then laughed softly. ""This is a gift from Damien. It has nothing to do with you.""

Her tone was gentle, but her eyes were challenging.

I walked closer, step by step, almost through gritted teeth. ""That's a relic from my mother, a necklace passed down through Wallis generations.""

She lowered her head like a scolded child, but her hands clutched it tighter.

""But... this is what Damien gave me. He said he wanted to make me happy.""

Her eyes glistened with tears, as if she were deeply wronged.

""You're lying!"" My voice shattered like broken glass. ""That's a one-of-a-kind necklace! You're a thief!""

I lunged at her.

Damien immediately blocked me, grabbing my shoulders. ""Calm down, Amelia, maybe it's a misunderstanding‚Äî""

But I fought to break free. He clearly hadn't expected such intensity.

Finally, he turned anxiously to Daisy. ""Daisy, take off the necklace. Let her see.""

Daisy's eyes swam with tears. ""But she called me a thief... This was clearly your gift.""

Damien was torn. ""Amelia, I can buy you however many necklaces you want. This thing isn't worth much. Daisy, don't cry. I'll buy you a whole collection of new ones later.""

I felt nothing but irony.

He'd never understand it wasn't about money.

It was the only thing my mother left me, the symbol of Wallis blood, now hanging around the neck of the woman I hated most.

Daisy sobbed as she finally removed the necklace.

Just as I reached for it, she suddenly let go‚Äî

""Crack!""

The necklace hit the floor hard, shattering into pieces.

Dead silence.

I stared at the fragments, my breath cut off.

My chest felt like it had been split open by a blade.

I looked up at Daisy.

A faint smile played at the corner of her mouth.

In that moment, I understood‚Äîshe'd done it deliberately.

Fury instantly burned through my entire body.

I rushed forward and slapped her hard across the face.

Daisy clutched her cheek, stunned, not expecting me to actually strike her.

The next second‚Äî

Damien's hand came down hard on my face.

Burning pain. The air froze.

""You'd hurt Daisy over a broken necklace? How could this thing be more important than her and my child!""

My child.

Not my brother's child.

My eardrums rang.

He'd admitted it.

That child wasn't his brother's‚Äîit was his.

I looked at this stranger in front of me, my heart pounding violently.

Five years of marriage, completely collapsed in this moment.

I bent down and picked up the fragments from the floor, piece by piece.

1okv9ib,https://www.reddit.com/r/lightgunshooters/comments/1okv9ib/practical_explanation_about_next_life/,Practical explanation about next life,"Practical Explanation ( For Example ) :- \`1st of all can you tell me every single seconds detail from that time when you born ?? ( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Here is no Question of Holy Books quotes, Personal Experiences, Faith or Belief. i accept that Sometimes Faith is also Blind. Here is already Practical explanation which already proved that every\`1 else in this world is nothing more then Busy Foolish and totally idiot.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Source(s):

every \`1 is already Blind in this world and if you will follow another Blind then you both will fall in hole. so try to follow that person who have Spiritual Eyes who can Guide you on Actual Right Path. ( my Authority & Guide is my Spiritual Master "" Srila Prabhupada "" )

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

if you want to see Actual Purpose of human life then see this link : ( triple w ( d . o . t ) asitis ( d . o . t ) c . o . m  {Bookmark it })

read it complete. ( i promise only readers of this book that they { he/she } will get every single answer which they want to know about why im in this material world, who im, what will happen after this life, what is best thing which will make Human Life Perfect, and what is perfection of Human Life. ) purpose of human life is not to live like animal cuz every\`1 at present time doing 4 thing which are sleeping, eating, s.ex & fear. purpose of human life is to become freed from Birth after birth, Old Age, Disease, and Death.",1,1761918916.0,lightgunshooters,0,1.0,False
1okv8yg,https://www.reddit.com/r/copypasta/comments/1okv8yg/good_boy_3_credit_ufinal_mirror6381/,Good boy :3 credit: u/final_mirror6381,"Ok, lets analyze this situation:

1: We dont know this woman.

2: She is not wearing a bra, around a stranger(s) thats really weird behavior as in the formal situation here.

3: She is resting her chest on the table/surface, which could be a sign of seductiveness, especially in a formal setting.

4: She called us a ""good boy"" and refers to herself as ""mommy"".

Now, calling a stranger ""good boy"" could be seen as weird and even predatory behavior, and plus, ""listening to mommy"" (implying that she is our ""mother"" possibly in a sexual sense, seeing that she is not wearing a bra, and is leaning against the table in a ""seductive"" manner, now ""we"" (the person she is referring to) could be a minor, and seeing that she looks of over the age of 18, she could be counted as a suspect of pedophilia.

Part 2, assessing and looking at the surroundings, the background and surroundings are mostly blurry, you can mostly see a dark golden to brown background, and we can see what looks like a spruce table or platform, on the platform we see a mug of steaming coffee (which could later be used in self defense), other than that, not much more surroundings.

Part 3, possible arrest charges and what to do in self defense: first of all, possible charges, the ""mommy"" could possibly, though controversially be charged with the following: Solicitation of a minor, sexual harassment, for example in the EU (ley legislation is the EU directive 2011/93/EU):

Germany: up to 3 years in prison.

France: up to 2 years in prison and a 30,000 Euro fine.

Spain: up to 3 years in prison.

Netherlands: up to 2 years in prison.

Italy: up to 4 years in prison.

Part 3, chapter 2, what to do in self defense, 1 you could grab the coffee mug and spill it onto ""mommy"" as in self defense if the situation escalates to physical force, 2, you could just walk away from the person and tell a trusted adult, 3, you could take her arm by the wrist and pull it to your waist, opening her back, leading to outcomes like a blow to the nape, neck, or occipital, only if situation escalates to physical force.

with that, I'd say that best is to just walk away from this person and tell a trusted adult.",1,1761918876.0,copypasta,0,1.0,False

( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

The first time I was prescribed 100 mg for acne at 28 after battling hormonal acne since the age of 13. The first time around, my experience was AWFUL and I stopped cold turkey after 3 months. I purged badly on my face, and while it did reduce how oily my skin is and eventually cleared up my breakouts, I had a really, really bad breakout all over my back (something I had not gotten before prior to spiro). The breakout left painful cystic nodes that I still have scars from today (2 years later). I also had to pee constantly, which was a bit embarrassing at work, and I was having major mood swings. And on top of it all, I was still getting acne breakouts! (Although they were lessened in severity and frequency.)

Fast forward 2 years of trying various treatments including topicals, chemical peels, expensive acne facials, I finally got a diagnosis of insulin-resistance PCOS after getting my hormones tested and was re-prescribed spironolactone 100 mg. However, my dermatologist also added arazlo lotion in case the back breakouts returned.

I‚Äôm several weeks into treatment, have almost 0 side effects, and my skin is entirely clear except for mild PIH (no purging)! However, this time, I‚Äôve started to do the following things for my PCOS with spironolactone, which I think have really helped with side effects:

- Dairy-Free and low sugar diet 
- Intermittent fasting 
- No coffee 

While I am doing these things for my PCOS, in hindsight, I believe the dairy and amount of sugary food/soda I consumed during my first round contributed to the initial purging phase and caused me to continue to breakout on spironolactone. Because I am insulin resistant, it also contributed to major mood swings. IF had also really helped stabilize my mood and regulate my blood sugar. 
Finally, not having coffee has also meant I don‚Äôt need to pee every hour. 

I understand that everyone‚Äôs experience with insulin resistant PCOS is different, but I do think some of these lifestyle changes really helped me manage my symptoms and have a much better experience with spironolactone. I also want to add that low blood sugar diet doesn‚Äôt mean I never have sugar - I find ways to work in a little treat for myself (usually dark chocolate). As my insulin resistance improves, I hope to add in other foods too.

During her time with me, its been increasingly clear that, while she's very curious about my hands and will take treats from me, she DOES NOT want me touching her. I'm not sure how to bridge the gap between her taking treats/curiously nibbling and being able to stroke her. 

Currently, to get out of cage enrichment, I coax her into a coffee mug and place her in a ""playpen"" (an aquarium I put a wire lid on) with vegetables, a wheel, water, a hide, and a few interesting items (new toys, new sprays, cups/dishes (she really likes spoons??)). The transport out stresses her out greatly so I don't do it often, even if she seems to enjoy time in her playpen. 

I worry about not being able to handle her in the event of an emergency in which I need to evacuate her from her home, like a fire or something similar, so I'd like to build up to being able to stroke or handle her.

I‚Äôve been experimenting with keeping my grind size constant while trying out different beans. The idea is to eliminate the faff of re-dialing the grinder for each new beans.  
The idea is to change the dose until the timings are on point.

Machine: Bugatti Diva (Badge engineered Lelit Anna/Anita)  
Grinder: Eureka Mignon  
Setting: 2 major ticks from blades touching

Beans: The beans were from Berry&Bean, except for the Lavazza, which was from the supermarket.

  
Option 1:  
Dial in the grinder for your darkest coffee for an 18‚ÄØg double  
Adjust the dose for lighter beans to hit turbo shot times

Option 2 (reverse):  
Dial in for a light coffee  
Reduce the dose for darker beans to reach acceptable shot times

  
Results using Option 1:  
Turbo shot (12‚ÄØs, 16:48) - Cafenorte Colombian, Cuaca region  
Long espresso (27‚ÄØs, 16:48) - Ethiopian Shakiso (Video)  
Standard espresso (28‚ÄØs, 18:36) - Lavazza Oro (supermarket)

All cups had good presentation and fine clarity. I expected the Ethiopian to be odd with this dosing and timing, but it worked surprisingly well. After the experiment, I consider going down to 14 grammes in on the Ethiopian to also hit turbo shot territory.

I am yet to test Option 2, as I am deliberately going for Turbo shots atm.

Has anyone else tried keeping a single grind setting across multiple beans? Curious how reproducible this is for others. A pitfall I see here, is that only Op2 allows for a standard espresso for lighter roasts.",1,1761918330.0,espresso,0,1.0,False

It‚Äôs made me a reluctant expert on the [**best iptv providers**](https://iptvmeezzy.life/) out there (or at least, the ones that can survive my erratic viewing habits). Here‚Äôs my honest ranking for 2025, based on what I‚Äôve actually used and tested.

* * *

### **1\.** [**IPTVMEEZZY**](https://iptvmeezzy.life/)

*   **Price:** $16/month (annual plan brings it down a bit)
    
*   **Channels:** 45,000+ live, 220,000+ VOD (US, UK, CA, EU‚Äîpretty much everywhere)
    
*   **Smoothness:** 9.5/10 (HD even with multiple streams; barely any buffering)
    
*   **Firestick:** Setup on my **iptv firestick** was instant
    
*   **My Take:** I gave it a shot after a **free trial** I saw from an **iptv reseller** in the UK. The sheer volume of channels is wild, but what matters most is how steady it is‚Äîeven when I‚Äôm watching US sports and EU news at the same time. It‚Äôs about as close to **perfect iptv** as I‚Äôve found for someone who channel-surfs as much as I do.
    

* * *

### **2\. FlexiStream TV**

*   **Price:** $15/month
    
*   **Channels:** 33,000+ live, 115,000+ VOD (big US/UK selection, decent CA/EU)
    
*   **Smoothness:** 8/10 (HD looks great, though I hit a little lag during the NBA finals)
    
*   **Firestick:** No issues at all with my **iptv firestick**
    
*   **My Take:** FlexiStream‚Äôs **free trial** let me binge a bunch of UK panel shows and try out some Canadian morning news. The EPG is easy, and the streams are sharp most of the time. It‚Äôs a solid pick if you want to cover all the big regions without too much hassle.
    

* * *

### **3\. BlueNova IPTV**

*   **Price:** $13.5/month
    
*   **Channels:** 27,500+ live, 80,000+ VOD (great for EU/UK, covers US/CA basics)
    
*   **Smoothness:** 7.5/10 (HD is solid for regular shows, but big live events can get choppy)
    
*   **Firestick:** Worked right out of the box on my **iptv firestick**
    
*   **My Take:** BlueNova is my go-to when I want something a little different‚Äîlots of EU variety, plus all the popular UK and US channels. I did notice some buffering when everyone in Europe seemed to be watching football, but for everyday HD viewing, it‚Äôs a nice value.
    

* * *

### **4\. MapleView Streams**

*   **Price:** $13/month
    
*   **Channels:** 21,000+ live, 66,000+ VOD (focus on CA/US, covers main UK/EU)
    
*   **Smoothness:** 7/10 (good for news and daily shows; can stutter if too many users are online)
    
*   **Firestick:** Fast setup on my **iptv firestick**
    
*   **My Take:** MapleView is my laid-back, background TV pick‚Äîperfect for having Canadian news on while I work or catching up on US late-night shows. Their **free trial** was easy to start, and while it‚Äôs not flawless during huge sporting events, HD quality holds up most times.
    

* * *

### **5\. UrbanCast IPTV**

*   **Price:** $12.5/month
    
*   **Channels:** 17,000+ live, 52,000+ VOD (US/UK/CA/EU staples, not a lot of niche)

1okuzdh,https://www.reddit.com/r/civitai/comments/1okuzdh/not_antiwaifu_just_profilter/,Not anti-waifu... Just pro-filter.,">***Note:*** *Before you downvote me for criticizing the platform, please understand. This isn't a hate-fest. Filters and searches aren't providing expected results. I'm not objecting to the fact that most users are obviously interested in porn waifu. I'm not standing in your way on that. Cue the jokes that I'm the guy who's reading the porn mag for the articles. My frustration is that I can't find much else except porn waifu, even when I am trying to find something more obscure. Maybe... just maybe... it doesn't all have to be about porn. Thanks for your patience.*

First, I love Civitai. It's one of the coolest things to happen in the AI art space ‚Äî this giant collaborative sandbox where models, LoRAs, and workflows bounce around like sparks of creativity. But lately, it feels like all those sparks are landing in the same place: circling the drain on the waifu factory floor.

[With filters applied both in the Browsing Level and Content Control settings.](https://preview.redd.it/e9j6849v3gyf1.png?width=1896&format=png&auto=webp&s=7907888c70624618ebf65e578cddacfc4a05e50d)

Every time I check the front page (or in this case, just the models page), it's another round of coffee-bar maid anime girls, fantasy dominatrix-warriors, or ""hyper-cute"" gym goddesses. Sure, they're technically impressive. Sure, there's an audience. But it's starting to feel like you can't throw a pixel around here without hitting a pair of perfectly rendered boobs ‚Äî or the occasional brooding hentai husbando flexing in soft light.

The Settings (Gear Icon) -> Content Controls filter is not really functional. The settings below do not apply to the website as evidenced in the models page image above. All Waifu. All Day.

[Content Controls Filters Provide Little or No Actual Function](https://preview.redd.it/j6s1ws413gyf1.png?width=508&format=png&auto=webp&s=89ebd53ef008aecd60a91dca512b99fd254191d1)

I'm not anti-waifu, anti-hentai, or anti-husbando. If people want to make their dream girlfriend or muscle-bound furry demon queen, go for it. *Own it.* But some of us are just trying to find a good model for trees, a LoRA for brick textures, or maybe even a background that doesn't look like it's waiting for an OnlyFans link. And right now? It's gotten *incredibly* difficult to find that.

And what‚Äôs worse, the narrowness of the aesthetic means other forms of beauty are almost unsearchable. There‚Äôs a *vast* spectrum of anime and cultural styles. Things like the diverse and ethereal depictions of *kami* (spirits of place), the historically inspired *kemonomimi* that aren‚Äôt about sex appeal but about reverence, folklore, and imagination. Try finding *that* on Civitai. Forget it. It‚Äôs buried under a mountain of maids and magical girlfriends. 

**So here's my actual ask: user-curated filters that we build together.**

Not just PG/R/XXX ratings. Real filters based on content type: waifu, husbando, pony, NSFW, fantasy armor, landscapes, architecture, patterns, textures, whatever. Users create their own filters, name them, rate them, browser rate them, share them. 

* Just Architecture
* No Waifu Zone
* Strictly Kami/Shin
* Hairy Chonky Men
* Full Anime Wonderland

Whatever your vibe is.

Right now, tagging is mostly AI-driven, and creators rarely tag their own work accurately. Who has time? Could Civitai gamify filtering? Maybe interested users could help improve that ‚Äî refining tags, adopting filters, making them better, republishing them. Civitai could highlight the most useful ones. The community does the curation work, and everyone benefits from finding what they actually want to see.

Because here's the thing: when I search ""architecture,"" I get women leaning seductively against walls that may or may not structurally exist, wearing heels and not much else. Sometimes I just want arches, buttresses, and chiaroscuro. Sometimes I want pattern geometry, not gym selfies.

Civitai could be a showcase of human imagination ‚Äî not just human (and human-hybrid) anatomy. Let us filter our way to that reality.",7,1761918221.0,civitai,3,0.89,False

I was thinking about why this promoted listing change would happen now, after eBay open, and seemingly out of nowhere. 

I‚Äôm not sure what percentage of sellers are using large language models to assist them with their listings, but I have a feeling it‚Äôs an ever increasing number and those listings tend to be far more effective at search engine optimization, algorithm optimization, or whatever other jargon I need to throw in here. 

It feels, to me, that the semi professional sellers on eBay who drive a large amount of business on their platform have caught on to using assistance tools at optimizing their titles. This has made promoted listings FAR less effective. 

Sellers have essentially used promoted listings as a way to get their products in front of the eyes of people who don‚Äôt know how to properly search for the things they want to buy. In other words, promoted listings were never about getting more visibility for your products to people who are interested in them. Promoted listings have, imho, been about assisting sellers with the ignorance and stupidity of buyers who don‚Äôt know how to search for things. 

 Fast-forward to today and I think eBay is suffering from sellers getting better at not needing these promotional tools to get in front of the less talented online buyer. So eBay is going to do what eBay needs to do. If you are willing to promote your product at all to anyone, then consider it promoted to everyone. If you don‚Äôt want to have access to the pool of potential buyers who are too stupid to know how to search for the things they want, then don‚Äôt promote.  If you do want access to that pool of stupid buyers, then expect to pay about 2 to 3% more on the products you sell to the buyers who do know what they want.

Prob wrong on it all, prob common sense to the more dialed in among us. But as a guy that annually sells more receivers and amplifiers through Ebay than your average Best Buy location, this is about as smart as I can sound ü•∏",2,1761918158.0,Ebay,0,1.0,False

Yesterday afternoon, I grabbed my nearly empty coffee cup, walked to the door to go into the house, turned the knob and opened the door.

When I did, instead of seeing my current basement with the cement floor and assorted bins containing holiday decor, there was a finished room. Carpeted, with floor to ceiling bookshelves, framed pictures, some I recognize and some I don't, furniture, and a neatly folded blanket. 

As I open the door, a woman, in her 30s maybe, turns around and looks at me. She seems to be packing cardboard boxes with things from the bookshelves. 
Her eyes growing wide.
She questioningly says, ""Amma?""
At this point, I can feel my heart racing and my hands shaking.
My voice is barely above a whisper when I ask, ""Who are you?""
She responds, ""I'm your granddaughter.""
Then she raises her voice towards the stairs, and yells, ""Mom?""
I hear my daughter upstairs respond, ""Yeah?""
Hearing the frustration in her voice, the familiarity of that annoyed response calmed my erratic heartbeat and physical shaking, and I involuntarily smirk. 
The woman in front of me hasn't taken her eyes off me, and says, ""I think I'm talking to Amma's ghost.""
I hear a creaking sound from upstairs, like someone moving around and my daughter responds, ""Oh. This must be mom's time slip.""

And then, I'm back in my office, coffee cup still in my left hand, my right hand on the doorknob about to open the door to the basement.

When I opened the door, the basement was back to normal. No bookshelves, no furniture, no woman.

What? Just. What?

I called my doctor's office to see if I need an MRI.
I googled time slip.
I've called friends and family.
I feel, both crazy and at peace. I don't know how to explain what happened.

¬† Ebony's POV

""Happy birthday, girl!"" My best friends were waiting for me and said at the same time.

Well, today is my sixteenth birthday.

""Are you coming over today after school? My mom and dad have something for you."" Kate asks.

Kate's mom and dad are the Alpha and Luna of our pack here at Blood Moon. Five different Packs go to Blood Moon High. Blood Moon, Silver Moon, Red Moon, Thunder Moon, And Grey Moon. We are like a college campus, and some of the different pack members live in dorms. But, mainly, the wealthy seniors choose to stay on campus.

""I have to work after school and won't get off until late,"" I told Kate.

""Derek will pick you up if you need, and you can stay with us tonight."" She said, With a worried look.

She knows my home situation, but I told her not to tell her mom and dad.

""Maybe tomorrow, I'm off then,"" I told her, and she nodded okay.

As we were walking to my locker, I felt something wet hit my face and clothes. I figured they were water balloons after a while. I tried to get out of the way of the balloons, but they kept hitting me. Finally, I ended up falling on the floor.

Looking up, I see Sandy, Cindy, and Mark standing there. Keith walks up to me with a trash bag and dumps flour all over me. I looked up at him, and he was smiling down at me.

""Happy Birthday, Loser!"" He said and walked away.

Keith is our Alpha‚Äôs son. A big bully in my life.

""I can't believe he would throw flour on you! I'm going to beat his ass. No! I'm going to have Derek beat his ass. You know he hates when Keith bullies you. "" Kate said

""I know but don't tell him. I don't want him getting in trouble. It wouldn't be good for the treaty either."" I said, and she knew I was right. Our pack has been working with the Silvermoon Pack since I was born. I didn't want them to end their treaty because of me. Kate and I were in the bathroom. I had a spare pair of clothes because this was not the first time Keith had pulled a stunt like this.

""Well! We need to let my parents know so they can do something about this."" She said as I walked out of the bathroom stall.

""I'm fine, I promise. Let's get to class.""

We headed to our first class, which was math.

""Nice for the two of you to join us. Take your seat,"" Mrs. Grammer said. So we went to our table and sat next to our other best friend, Kayla.

""You okay?"" Kayla whispered, and I nodded.

We listened to Mrs.Grammer. She told us to do pages 32 and 33 in our math books. After a few minutes, I felt something hit the back of my head. I turned around and saw Keith looking around like he had done nothing. I turned back around, and something hit my head again. I looked down and saw two balled-up pieces of paper. I turned and looked at him again, and he looked at me,

""What are you looking at, loser?"" he asked. I turned back around and felt it again, and now I was pissed. ""Stop throwing stuff at me,"" I said.

""Is something wrong, Ebony?"" Mrs. Grammer asked, annoyed.

""No. Nothing is wrong. I am sorry,"" I replied. Mrs. Grammer was a member of the Silvermoon Pack. There was no way she would listen to anything I said.

""I have a problem. Ebony keeps staring at me and saying weird things to me. She is making me uncomfortable,"" Keith said.

""No, I'm not! He keeps throwing stuff at me. He did it three times.""

""That's not true! Mrs. Grammer, you have known me my whole life. Ebony is trying to get me in trouble. The other day Ebony told me she was in love with me and wanted to be my girlfriend, and I turned her down. So she started to stalk me,"" Keith said.

""No, I didn't. You are lying. ""I replied

""Enough, Ebony! You can't make up stories about someone because you are upset that they don't like you. I asked you if everything was okay, and you said yes. You need to apologize to the young Alpha this instant."" She said

""But,""

""No buts, Ebony. You know what, leave."" She said, and I picked up my bag to leave. Before I walked out of the room, Keith said, ""I'm sorry, Ebony but a bastard child, with a hoe and an alcoholic mom, on welfare is not the girl for me."" Fits of laughter were heard all through the class. I wanted to cry but held my tears. I would not cry in front of him.

""Are you okay?"" I heard Kate ask before hugging me.

""I'm fine! I'm just tired of him bullying me."" I said.

""I can't believe Mrs. Grammer acted like he didn't say anything to you. She should have kicked him out."" Kayla said

""Yeah, but you know she is from his pack. She would never go against him for me. No one would; I am poor and a nobody. He is a soon-to-be Alpha of his pack.""

""You aren't a nobody, and it's not right how he treats you and gets away with it. Don't sell yourself short,"" Kate said.

We walked to the cafeteria and went to the lunch line. After we got our food, we sat at our usual table. We were talking and laughing, and then I saw Sandy walking toward me, and she was staring straight at me.

""I heard you tried to get with my boyfriend."" She said.

""No, I didn't,"" I replied

""You think I believe you. Keith told me, you bitch. He would never get with you. He told me you tried to suck his cock, and he denied you. You are so desperate it's sad."" She said,

"" That's not true. He is lying,"" I said

""Don't deny it; you know you threw yourself on me. You acted like a slut getting on your knees and begging to taste my cock."" He said

""Shut up, Keith; she would never do that,"" Kate said

""Well, you truly don't know your friend. So I have no reason to lie.""

"" I didn't; I swear,"" I started, and then Dandy threw her water on me.""

""You are thirsty for my boyfriend's cock, so there you go."" She said

Everyone around me was laughing except for Kate and Kayla. Kayla looked at me in pity while Kate was cussing Keith out.

I couldn't take it anymore and ran out of the cafeteria. I was so tired of being treated like trash. I was thinking about switching schools at the end of the year, but then I began to think I should do it sooner.

""Ebony, wait"" I looked up and saw Kayla running to catch up to me. ""Don't let them get to you,"" She said.

¬† ¬†""I can't do this anymore, Kayla. I am done with this school. I will see if Alpha Michael will let me transfer to the human schools,"" I said.

# Chapter 2

¬†Keith's 18th Birthday

Keith's POV

It's Friday and my eighteenth Birthday. I am sitting in the kitchen with my mom and dad, eating breakfast.

""What Plans do you have for your birthday, son?"" My dad asked after sipping on his coffee.

""Mark is throwing me a party at his cousin's house,"" I told him.

""Try not to get too wild today, son. You know you can find your Mate at any time now. Don't want to start on a bad note.""He says

""Yeah, like messing with that Sandy girl. It won't be good if your Mate sees the two of you together. That's why I keep telling you to break up with that girl,"" My mom said.

""Honey! Give the boy a break; he is young. Besides, you have to let him learn on his own. Plus, what if she is his mate"" My dad says

""I doubt that she is definitely not his Mate. I can guarantee there is no way that my son is mated to that; how do you kids put it now, Slut!"" She says.

I look at my mom in shock because she doesn't usually call girls names like that, but she is right. Sandy has been with multiple men and women while we've been together. I don't mind, though. Sometimes we share a woman or two.

Once I finished breakfast, I bid my mom and dad goodbye and headed to school. Once I got there, Sandy was waiting for me at the front entrance. We look at each other, and I felt nothing different than before. So my mom was right. We weren't mates.

""Hey baby, you ready for your party tonight,"" she says and kisses me. I still feel nothing different. She definitely

was not my Mate. I felt like I was doing something wrong being with her now, but I brushed that feeling aside.

""Yeah! I can't wait.""

""Hey man, Happy Birthday,"" Mark says as he comes up the stairs to the entrance.

""Thanks, man,"" I replied. He looks between Sandy and me.

""You feel anything different with her, man?"" He asks me through mind-link.

""No, man, she isn't the one,"" I answered. Mark shrugged his shoulders, and we walked to my locker while Sandy went off with Cindy.

The first half of the school day went by quickly. First, everyone wished me a happy birthday.

""Hey man, you hear about that poor kid from the Bloodmoon Pack? What is her name, Elaine? The girl you are always picking on,"" Samual, one of our best trackers, asks.

""You mean Ebony?"" I asked

""Yes, that's her name. She is switching to go to the human high school."" He said

""Well, I guess you finally got her out of here,"" Mark said

""I knew I would,"" I replied

""It's about time we finally got rid of that bitch. she didn't belong here with us, ""Sandy said.

After lunch, Sandy pulled me outside and behind the bleachers.""I know we aren't mates, but that doesn't mean we can't have some fun. Happy Birthday,"" She says.

Cindy and their friend Ashley walked out from where they were hiding with no shirt or bra on. They approached me, and Ashley started removing my shirt while Cindy began pulling down my pants. Sandy was kissing me, and I felt Ashley's warm mouth around my cock, and she began to suck. While she was doing that, Cindy started eating Sandy out while Sandy was kissing me.

I put my hands in Ashley's Hair and pulled out of her mouth.

""Get on your hands and knees,"" I said, and she did without hesitation. I went behind her and thrust right into her while Cindy was still eating Sandy out. I began moving in and out of her fast while she was moaning. I started playing with Sandy's breast while Cindy was still tongue fucking her pussy. Soon Ashley was cumming hard on my cock, and I moved her out of the way.

""Come here bitch,"" I told Cindy, and she didn't hesitate to get on all fours, and I thrust hard into her pussy. I fuck her fast and hard.

I saw Ashley eating Sandy out, and I heard her moaning. I started fucking Cindy faster, thrusting In and out. My cock was to the hilt as I grabbed her neck with one hand and shoulder with the other. She soon was cumming hard.

""I pulled out of her and grabbed Sandy by the neck and thrust into her deep and hard. Thrusting fast into her pussy. She was soon moaning loud. Cindy was licking one of Sandy's nipples while Ashley licked the other. I am balls deep inside her holding her neck as I fuck her. She began to cum, and I hurried and pulled out.

""On your knees and stuck me off,"" I told them. They got on their knees and sucked and licked my cock until I cum. All three of them lick up all my cum and swallow it.

""Happy Birthday, Baby,"" Sandy said between breaths.

"" You think you'll find your Mate tonight? ""Mark asked while in the passenger seat. We were heading to my party.

""I don't know! She wasn't any of the girls at school, so maybe she is from another pack."" I say

I parked the car, and we headed into the house. The party was already packed with people drinking, smoking, and some couples fucking in front of everyone.

I went to the kitchen and saw Sandy talking to some girls. She saw me and smiled.

""Hey baby,"" She said and came to kiss me.

""Hey,"" I replied

We all hung out for a minute, and Sandy and I decided to go outside.

""You having fun?"" She Asked

""It's cool,"" I replied

""Did you have fun today under the bleachers?"" She asked

""Of course,"" I told her, and she started kissing me. The kiss soon got heated, and she started unbuttoning my pants.

""You know, Keith, I was upset when I saw you this morning, and we figured we were not mates."" She said as she took my dick out of my pants and started sucking, not caring who walked by and saw her.

"" Me too, babe,"" I said, not even caring. I put my hand on her hair, forcing her to take more of my cock in her mouth.

""We should become chosen mates and reject are true ones once we meet them,"" Sandy said before sucking my cock again.

I pulled her off of me. I couldn't believe she had just said that. I wasn't necessarily looking for my Mate right now, but I knew I wanted my true Mate.

""Sandy, I am not going to reject my mate when I meet her,"" I told her truthfully.

""But you're with me now. You know you can find your Mate anytime, but you still are fucking me. You are using me."" She said, trying to play the victim.

""Don't try that shit on me. You use me just as much as I use you. Don't think I don't know that after we fucked, behind the bleachers, you had a three-way with Derek and Vivian."" I told her.

She didn't say anything for a moment, and I decided it was time for me to walk away.

""I love you, Keith!"" She said, and I froze. I couldn't believe what I was hearing. There was no way she truly loved me.

""No, you don't, not really. And I don't love you either. I never told you I did, Sandy."" I said and walked away.

I went to the woods and changed into my black wolf. I needed a run. I ran through the woods for about an hour and then changed back. I was hungry, so I decided to go to the cafe I usually go to, which is called Joe's Diner. Most of the school typically hangs out there on Fridays, but most were at my party.

Once I arrived, I chose a booth to sit in. I looked at the menu though I already knew what I was going to get.

The door to the diner opened, and I smelled the most intoxicating smell. It was a mixture of oranges and strawberries. It's so hard to explain, but it smelled wonderful.

""I'm sorry I'm late. I missed the"" I heard the most angelic voice say. It sounded so familiar, but I couldn't place where I'd heard it before.

I looked up in shock when I saw who it was. Ebony was my Mate.

She was looking at me in shock as well. She must feel it too.

¬† ¬†""Mate!"" I said out loud, looking her straight in the eye. Then, I stood up to go to her.

# Chapter 3

¬† ¬†Ebony's POV

""Where have you been? I need to talk to you about something."" My mom asked me as I walked through the front door of our apartment.

""I was at Kate's. I have to get ready for work,"" I told her and started walking to my room to put on my uniform.

I went to the bathroom to freshen up. I locked the bathroom door and brushed my teeth. Then, I put on my uniform and returned to my room.

A young guy was sitting on my bed when I entered my room. He had to be about twenty.

""Hello, pretty girl! I'm Chad's son Ryan"" He said, looking me up and down lustfully, making me feel sick from his nasty gaze.

""Mom"" I screamed, not going any closer to that guy Chad.

""What,"" She asked, annoyed.

"" Why is he in my room? I walked in, and he was here,"" She asked.

""That's what I wanted to talk to you about. Ryan, here is a soon-to-be tracker of the Silvermoon Pack. He is Chad's son."" My mom said

""Is this her, father?"" he asked Chad, standing by my mom.

""Yes, she is gorgeous right?"" Chad replied.

""Come here, Ebony; I need to talk to you,"" my mom said, and we headed to her room. She told me to sit down.

""Look, Ebony. I'm just going to get to the point. We are broke because I made some bad investment decisions."" She said and paused for a minute.

""Ebony, you are sixteen now and a young woman. Ryan is twenty-one years old and is very wealthy. He has taken an interest in you."" She said

""What do you mean, mom?"" I asked her.

""I told him about you, and he is interested in you,"" She said

I looked at her with a confused expression.

""I told him you were a virgin, and he wants to change that. He wants to take your virginity,"" She finally finished.

""What! No, mom, I don't even know him."" I told her and stood up and was about to leave

""Yes, you will!"" She shouted at me, and I just looked at her

""I owe him some money. He owns a club, and I Borrowed some money from him. He will hurt me if you don't do this, Ebony."" She said

""I kept you and lost my mate. You are the reason we are living like this. I need you to go back in there and let him do what he wants with you. I'm sure he will be gentle. If you are good, he will keep you."" She said

I couldn't believe my mom would do that to me. She is trying to sell my innocence.

""I will give you five minutes, but after that, I need you to go back in there."" She said and walked away.

Once she was gone, I thought, how is she, my mother? A mother doesn't sell their daughter. I knew I was not going to let him take my virginity.

I got up and walked out of my mom's room. They were all talking in the kitchen.

""She just needs a few minutes, and then she will be ready,"" I heard my mom say

""She better! You owe me a lot of money from all the drugs you've received from me and the gambling you've done at my son's club. He's been waiting to take her for a year; now it's time."" Chad said

""Yes, I'm not waiting anymore,"" Ryan said

I went to my room in a hurry. I got my purse and phone. I went to my closet and took the money I had hidden from my mom. I opened my window and ran out of there.

I was already late for work but decided to go anyway. I had to walk because I missed the bus. I would call Kate and tell her to have Derek pick me up. There was no way I was going back home.

I didn't understand why my mom would sell me like that. he wasn't my mate. I would feel the bond since I was sixteen now. So why did he want to take my virginity? What did they mean he had been waiting a year for me?

I was also upset because my mom had lost all the money doing things she shouldn't, like drugs, and blamed me for her bad decisions. She borrowed money to gamble with when we had no hot water or heat.

I finally made it to the Cafe.

""I'm sorry I'm late. I missed the"" I started to say and was hit with the scent of pine and mint. It was so relaxing.

I looked up and was shocked; Keith was sitting in a booth by the window. ""Mate,"" I heard him say, looking straight at me. Then, he stood up to come to me.

""No,"" I said and ran out of there as fast as possible.

How could my mate be the one person that has hated me for so long? He has made my life a living hell.

I walked for a while, went to the woods, and changed into my wolf.

My wolf is different than most. She is all white with a bit of black fur by her eyes. I first changed into my wolf a month before my twelfth birthday. You usually change at thirteen.

Another different thing about me is that my clothes stay in place when I change. Everyone else I know clothes tear off them. Only some people know about my wolf.

I was in the woods with Kate and Derek the first time I shifted. Derek made Kate run to get their parents. Once they arrived, they were shocked to see my wolf was white. They were also surprised when I turned back, and my clothes were still on.

Uncle Michael said we couldn't tell anyone else, not even my mom, because it could make me a target. So I usually change where Alpha Michael told everyone else was forbidden. He did that so I would have a place to shift.

Once close to the pack house, I shifted back and started walking the rest of the way.

I mind-linked with Kate and told her I was on my way and needed to talk to her parents. I had to tell them about my mom. She had gone too far and tried to sell me.

Someone grabbed my arm, causing me to scream.

""Ebony, it's me."" I looked up and saw Keith. Tingles were shooting all through my body from his touch.

"" Why are you here?"" I asked him

""You know why!"" He said, staring deep into my eyes. His green eyes were beautiful. I couldn't look away from them. He seemed to be in the same situation.

A car's lights broke the trance, and I saw Uncle Michael, Aunt Lisa, Kate, and Derek in the car.

Derek and Uncle Michael got out of the car.

""What a surprise, Keith; how's your father? Is anything wrong?"" Uncle Michael asked

""No, nothing is wrong, and he is fine. I need to talk to Ebony,"" Keith said

""No, you don't! Leave her alone!"" Derek said and tried to pull me behind him.

""No, she is mine!"" Keith growled.

His eyes were turning black, and his wolf was taking over.

Derek tried to shield me from Keith, but Uncle Michael knew what was happening.

"" Derek, take your hands off her before Keith loses control."" Uncle Michael said

""He will hurt her,"" Derek said

""No, he won't, son, trust me,"" Uncle Michael said

Derek let me go hesitantly, and Keith came to me. I flinched but calmed down once he started hugging me.

The tingles were going everywhere through my body. It felt good, perfect. I actually felt the one thing I never thought I would say around Keith. I felt safe. I felt safe in his arms, like he would never let anyone hurt me.

He put his face in the crock of my neck and sniffed. ""Mine,"" he whispered in my hair, sending chills throughout my body.

Kate stepped out of the car in shock.

""Oh my goddess, they are,"" She began.

""Mate's,"" Derek finished, also looking shocked.

""Come, let's go in to talk. We should also have your parents come over, Keith."" Uncle Michael said.

""I already mind-linked them. They are on their way."" Keith said, still holding me.

""I will shift with Keith since there's not much space in the car,"" Derek said.

""Why can't me and Ebony shift,"" Keith asked.

Everyone was quiet for a moment.

""Is it because her wolf looks different? She is gorgeous,"" Keith said.

We all looked at him in shock. He must have seen me shift.

¬† ¬†All shit!

# Chapter 4

¬†Keith's POV

Derek and I shifted and ran to the Bloodmoon Packhouse. We made it there in no time and waited for Ebony and the others to show.

""So are you going to change the way you treat her?"" Derek asked

I looked at him for a moment and then responded. ""She is my mate, Derek. I feel terrible for the way I treated her and the pain I caused her."" I said truthfully.

He just looked at me for a second and then nodded.

My mom and dad were on their way as well. We needed to speak to Ebony, Alpha Michael, and Ebony's mom about Ebony and me being mates.

I wanted to grab her and take her home with me the moment I knew she was my mate. The problem was, considering the way I have treated her, I'm pretty sure she wouldn't go willingly, and I would never force her.

I cared for her and wanted to make her happy. I wanted her to agree with every decision that we made. She is my mate and the future Luna of the Silvermoon Pack. She is my equal.

It is crazy how the mate bond works. I went from being a total asshole to her, and now I wanted to make her happy. I was worried about how she was feeling. Worried that she might reject me.

Rejection hardly ever happened. normally it would be a really good reason for rejection. Like a rapist would get rejected.

I wasn't that bad, but I was never nice to her. I said and did some messed up shit to her not even a week ago.

I had to figure out how to win her over.

The car pulled up about ten minutes after we arrived. I opened her door and she looked shocked but said thank you and I smiled at her.

""We should talk in my office."" Alpha Michael said and I agreed.

Ebony, Derek, Alpha Michael, Luna Lisa, and I went to his office.

""My parents should be here in about twenty minutes,"" I said.

""Before they get here, we need to talk about something private. You have seen Ebony's Wolf and we need to make sure you will keep it to yourself. You can't tell anyone else about her. We haven't even told her mother."" Alpha Michael said.

""Why!"" I asked

""I am different. I don't know why but you saw my wolf is white and when I shifted I still had my clothes on."" Ebony said

""I would never tell anyone, Ebony, I promise,"" I told her.

She looked at me for a moment and then sighed in relief.

""White wolfs are supposed to be a myth. It is said they hold great power,"" Alpha Michael said

""Yeah but I have no powers, besides my clothes staying on me,"" Ebony replied

""You are still young, not even eighteen yet. You might gain some,"" Derek said, and I agreed with him.

Ebony looked like she didn't believe any of what Derek was saying. I looked at her and didn't understand how I could be so blind and stupid. She is beautiful! The most beautiful woman I've ever seen.

Someone knocked on the door, and Alpha Michael told them to come in. My mom and dad were on the other side.

""Hello Alpha Edward and Luna Nancy. Please have a seat,"" Alpha Michael said.

""Hello,"" My dad said.

He looked over at my mate, and she looked nervous. Like she was worried, they wouldn't approve.

""Mom and dad, this is Ebony, my mate,"" I said proudly.

""Hello Alpha and Luna,"" she said and was about to kneel. I was about to reach for her to stop. She didn't have to kneel. She was the future Luna and my mate.

What shocked me was that my mom, the woman who never liked anyone I dated grabbed her arm softly and pulled her up.

""You don't kneel to anyone sweetheart. You are the future Luna and a part of this family now. My name is Nancy, or you can call me mom. Whatever you are more comfortable with is fine with me.""She said with a warm smile.

I was shocked and happy.

""And I am Edward or dad, whichever you are comfier with, Angel.""

She looked at them with a look I didn't understand completely. I think she was shocked by how nice they were. She smiled at them and sat back down on the chair by me.

""So are we waiting for your parents to get here,"" my mom asked.

Ebony looked over at Alpha Michael and then at Derek for a moment.

""Maybe we should inform your mom."" Alpha Michael said

""No!"" Ebony said in a hurry.

We all looked at her, and then she continued.

""My mom wouldn't be interested. She doesn't believe in the mate bond."" She whispered.

""Ebony, we need to tell her something. He is of Alpha blood. He can't spend too much time without you. It will drive him crazy."" Alpha Michael told her.

They started to have a silent conversation. I knew they were mind-linking each other. It looked like Derek, and Luna Lisa was a part of the mind-link as well.

My parents and I looked at each other for a moment, wondering what was going on. It obviously had something to do with her mom.

People from school knew her mom always showed up at clubs and bars. We all knew she drinks a lot and has a new guy almost every week. She obviously doesn't have time for her daughter. I wonder how she treats Ebony.

Alpha Michael had an expression that showed he was upset. His normally blue eyes were black.

Derek didn't look any better. His blue eyes were just as black as his father's.

""Renee will not be involved with any decisions that involve Ebony from now on."" Alpha Michael said.

We didn't say anything. there had to be a good reason for him to make that decision.

""So, how will we proceed? I expect Ebony to move to the Silvermoon Pack since she is my son's mate. I'm sure that is what Keith wants as well."" My dad said, and I nodded.

I looked over and saw Ebony stiffen. I could tell she was uncomfortable with this.

""I don't know if that's a good idea. Ebony and Keith don't even get along."" Derek said

""What do you mean they don't get along? They are mates. I'm sure they will get along. He can't be away from her for too long, and she needs to get to know our Pack. She will be their Luna."" My mom said

""She is right, Derek! Ebony should move with him as soon as possible. I think it would be good for the both of them. They both will feel pain if they are away from each other for too long,"" Luna Lisa said.

""He has been bullying her for years. He has treated her horribly. Tell them, Keith,"" Derek said

My mom and dad looked at me. I could see the sad look in my mom's eyes

""Is this true, son?"" My dad asked.

I looked down in shame before answering, ""yes, it is true.""

""How could you, son? We taught you better than that,"" My mom said.

""See, she doesn't need to move in with him,"" Derek said

He was making me and my wolf upset. She was still my mate, and now that I knew that I would never hurt her again.

""I know what I did was wrong? I am sorry for everything that I have done. I was stupid, and I will never make that mistake again.""I said

""Let's let Ebony decide what she thinks is best."" Luna Lisa said

I turned and looked Ebony in her eyes. She looked back for a moment and then got up.

""I'm sorry I can't do this right now,"" She said with tears in her eyes.

I was about to run after her, but my dad grabbed my shoulder.

"" I will go talk to her,"" Luna Lisa said.

I will go with you, but before I go, son, you need to make this up to her. I raised you better than this,"" my mom said.

""I Know!"" I replied.

""She is probably going to find Kate and Kayla,"" Luna Lisa said before they left the room.

"" What were you thinking, son? You are going to be Alpha. How could you bully people? Bully your own mate,"" My dad asked.

""I didn't know she was my mate. If I had known, I would never have done any of it."" I said

""I know, but now it's going to be hard for you to gain her trust and forgiveness."" My dad said, and Derek and his dad nodded their agreement.

""I know, but I will gain her trust and forgiveness even if it takes the rest of my life,"" I said

Derek let out a laugh and said,

""good luck with that.""

¬† ¬†I knew he was right. I would need all the luck I could get.

# Chapter 5

¬†Ebony's POV

""I know what I did was wrong ok? I am sorry for everything that I have done. I was stupid and I will never make that mistake again.""Keith said

I looked at Keith, shocked by his words. He has never been nice to me. I didn't know if I could believe him.

""Let's let Ebony decide what she thinks is best,"" Aunt Lisa said

Keith was looking at me deep into my eyes. He had so much hope in his eyes.

What shocked me the most was the way he looked at me. Normally his eyes would show disgust and hatred, but now they showed adoration and fascination. He looked at me like I was the most beautiful and precious woman in the world to him.

I also was feeling differently about him. I wanted to be his mate and accept him. I wanted to move in with him and let everything from our past go.

At the same time, I felt that I should make him work for me. I didn't trust him fully, and a relationship needs trust. I also didn't forgive him fully for the way he had treated me all these years. It was too overwhelming.

I also thought of him and Sandy. Did he break up with her yet? Was he planning on breaking up with her? It's said that mates lose any sexual attraction they had for anyone else once they find each other. I have seen it myself, but that still didn't make me not worry about them. My mom was evidence enough that mates can hurt and deceive you.

""I'm sorry I can't do this right now,"" I said and ran off. I didn't even know I was crying until my vision became blurry.

I went outside and sat on a bench. I needed some fresh air to calm down and think about what I should do.

While we were in Uncle Michael's office, I mind-linked Uncle Michael, Aunt Lisa, and Derek and let them know what happened with my mom earlier.

I told them how she basically tried to sell my virginity to some guy to pay off her debt.

They were pissed. Uncle Michael said he will take care of it. He also said that since Ryan is a tracker for Silvermoon, we would have to tell Keith's dad and should tell Keith since we are mates. I agreed because I knew if we kept that from him he would be upset with his dad. I didn't want to cause any problems between them.

""What are you doing here? Still begging the Alpha and Luna for money."" I looked up and saw Sandy standing in front of me.

""I have never begged them for anything. What do you want, Sandy? I'm not in the mood right now to talk to you"" I told her

""I don't care what mood you're in you bitch.""She said

""Is everything ok out here"" I heard Aunt Lisa ask.

I looked over by the back door and saw Aunt Lisa and Nancy coming toward us.

""Yes, Luna Lisa, everything is fine. Just talking to Ebony here,"" Sandy said with a fake smile.

""That's not what it looked like to me?"" Nancy said, looking upset.

""Hello Luna Nancy, I was just talking to Ebony about Keith's party. She doesn't have much money because she lives in the bad part of..."" She started saying trying to embarrass me but was cut off.

""I don't care what part of town she is from. That doesn't give you the right to bad mouth her.""Nancy said.

""Sandy you should go back inside, we have something important to discuss with Ebony."" Aunt Lisa said trying to defuse the situation.

""Are you ok, Ebony!"" I heard Keith ask. I turned, and he was looking straight at me.

""She is quite upset, I'm sure. Sandy just tried to bad mouth Ebony, son. She was very rude and disrespectful to her."" His mom said.

Keith took his eyes off me and looked over at Sandy. He didn't even notice she was there until his mom brought her up.

""Keith baby, she started it. You know I would never start anything without a reason."" Sandy said and touched his hand.

He removed her hand so fast, and she looked shocked by his reaction.

Keith didn't seem to care his eyes were back on mine, and he came to stand closer to his mom.

""Keith, what's wrong?"" Sandy asked and went closer to him.

I was getting upset that she touched him and at how close she was to him. He is mine, not hers. I could feel my wolf coming to the surface and taking over. I knew my eyes had to be black right now.

Keith was still looking at me, and I knew he could tell I was getting pissed. I could tell he was trying to figure out the best way to handle this awkward situation.

""Sandy, we need to talk. I will call you later."" He told her, still looking at me.

""Why don't you come and see me after you're done since you are already here? I never gave you your full birthday present."" She whispered in his ear, and I couldn't help the loud growl that left my lips.

I was pissed and moments away from losing the little control I had and turning into my wolf and ripping her apart.

¬† ¬†I growled and rushed to Sandy, but Keith wrapped his arms around me...

today I take exactly 3 weeks B12 500uq (pill), Multivitamin (pill), B-Complex (drops), Vitamin D 20.000 IU.   


I didnt test my B12 but I had all the symptoms again (I got diagnosed with low B12 since childhood and was on and off). 

Overall Iam doing better but I expierence pros and cons  
  
Pros:   
\- Hungry AF, I lost a lot of weight and I couldnt swollow food without chocking. Iam now much better. I eat the whole plate and get hungry 1-2 hours later. Cant wait to get chubby and strong af again !   
  
\-  I sleep much better and I feel like I need less sleep overall (also I currently dont train because I get immendatly sick when I start B12). Also I fall a sleep on the couch which is new. 

\- I feel overall lazy and relaxed which is good because before that I couldnt sleep and felt always on the ""edge"". 

\- My mood got better 

\- I live in the moment (I had always a monkey in my had which is gone, that is very strange). I just say things without ""checking"" each word and it works. I expected to cause chaos but everything is fine. 

\- I crave more healthy foods and need less coffee. 

\- Not that pale anymore! 

\- Stomach was the first week bad but it got better ! I take my pills with my breakfast (this was a game changer). 

Cons: 

\- Headache (that sucks a lot). 

\- Iam dizzy a lot, work suffers... 

\- My skin got very dry and peels ( before my skin was always oily).

\- Random panic attacks (it got better but still not perfect) before I had terrible anxiety so it got better and different at the same time. 

\- my muscels get tight and my left arm gets ""cold""... 

\- my face and lips burn when I take B12. 



My plan is just to keep going, I hit the gym soon again 3-4 again and lets see how my performence will be.

# Dec 31, 2024: Raymond Jones

Enlightened Human

It chilly out. It‚Äôs also starting to drizzle. Early evening drizzle on New Years Eve? Stupid weather. I have my long coat on and the hat keeps me dry. I still get stares. A cop eyes me a few times. I open my coat as if searching and he can see I am not hiding anything as I find some gum and pop it in my mouth. I walk up to the trash can and drop the wrapper in. He figures I would just be a hassle and starts eyeing other people as he moves on.¬† Glad these mind games still work.¬† My appointment is late .¬† I do see him walking up. Hard to miss first worlders if you are a hunter. You see the signs or you die before you have to worry about it.

We nod to one another. We start walking. I decide to address his tardiness, ‚ÄúYou should have been here 10 minutes ago.‚Äù¬† He chuckles.¬† The perfect face takes on a look of consternation.

‚ÄúI was greeted by some curious queens. 4 of them.‚Äù¬† I guess he went to the CaFae.¬† That or Court, but the new queen is only there for official stuff.¬† Could have meant one of the lesser queens, but I doubt it.¬† Unlikely to be their Court.¬† Yea, he emphasized four too much, so he means her.¬† She‚Äôs a curiosity to the Council of Hunter.

Both are still mortal, really.¬† Non-targets.¬†

I decide it is a good explanation, ‚ÄúYou are a curiosity.¬† Hell, I was shocked when your rep approached me.¬† When anyone from your race gets involved, shit‚Äôs going down.‚Äù

He nods. ‚ÄúI am aware of our reputation.¬† I am unaware of how a mortal with no Fae blood has not only attained the power of an ArchFae, but she holds the rank of Queen.¬† They explained it but I am still unable to grasp the forces involved.‚Äù

I chuckle. It‚Äôs been a few months since I stumbled on the place. I was on a hunt at the time.¬† I got told a troll was spotted at a bridge in the city.¬† Some pissed off gamer had tracked down a person they wished to get even with in an online game. The gamer had hit the in-game troll over the head with a baseball bat and found out it was an actual troll.

I tracked him down and determined killing him would be impossible at that moment as he was a damn barista at the coffee shop I tracked him down to.¬† I was trying to warn the proprietor that the creature would be trouble when she told me if I tried to hurt anyone in the place, especially her little brother, she would end me.¬†

In that moment I saw what she was hiding.¬† She showed me what she looks like when she is serious.¬† I have a strict policy not to fuck with ArchFae.¬† She reinforced my belief in this policy in less than 2 seconds.¬† Glad I wore the brown pants that day.¬†

She then got my drink order and had me wait next to Oberon, the King of Beasts. I figured out I was truly fucked in that moment when it came to hunting that troll.¬† I also found the spot where the most supernatural creatures in the country congregate.¬† And it was worthless to me.¬† Still, I had a contract.

I followed him for a bit. Saw he was very mundane in how he went about his day and then met Beth. A human woman that is in love with a troll.¬† After talking with her over coffee as she approached me and asked that I stop stalking her boyfriend I realized this troll was not really dangerous. One of my few cancelled contracts. I don‚Äôt kill things that aren‚Äôt really monsters.

But there are so many actual monsters out here.¬† And I am an old man now.¬† Worn down.¬† I may be an old hunter, but I am not going to be a famous one, yet.

Right now the Spear of Lugh is out there and it is very likely going to create a lot of problems for the supernatural creatures of this city.

‚ÄúC‚Äômon, warrior, let‚Äôs go find that spear.‚Äù

He looks at a packet of papers he has and sighs.¬†

‚ÄúMy brothers, we are finally ready. We have acquired the weapon which will allow us to finally eradicate those accursed vampires. After them, we will destroy any other creatures that dare challenge our eminence.¬† We will crush them all with this unbeatable spear.‚Äù

Dozens of creatures ranging from wolves to men to the wolf men from movies cheer. Sitting in a dark corner I am very curious as to how this pans out. ¬†I hear a conversation before I slip away.

‚ÄúIsn‚Äôt this great, Trev?‚Äù¬† The enthusiastic werewolf is looking at a large even for a werewolf companion. The companion sports a biker jacket and arms covered in tattoos.

‚ÄúNot really. My gut says this is going to be bad. Also, do we really call Moonbeam The Eminence of Fury now? I mean, Hank was bad enough, but now this?‚Äù

‚ÄúHe is going to fuck them all up Trev, least we can do is call him something sick.‚Äù

The large companion pets his friend on his head. ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt ever change, Billy.‚Äù

¬†

My thoughts as I head into the Far Realms are simple. I should have let the Vampires wipe them out first.

# Dec 31, 2024: Anton

Vampire

I am the night. Few creatures can match me for speed, strength, or ability after the sun sets. I can leap across rooftops with ease, meld with shadows and generally move faster than anyone else I may encounter.

So why am I being chased by these damn furries? They‚Äôre far too brazen. They also attacked me and hurt me. Like really hurt. I need to find a place to hide.

Wait. There! I am close.

Even they follow the rules there. That place is safe. It‚Äôs only a few blocks away.¬† Did I start heading there subconsciously?

I land on a rooftop and things become strange.¬† I see a garden and a greenhouse.¬† The greenhouse has sunlight leaking out. It is nearly midnight.¬† Leave it to the Fae to make this dangerous for me. I head to the stairwell when a creature lands between me and my salvation. It has a spear.

‚ÄúGoing somewhere, leech?‚Äù¬† It snarls at me. I can‚Äôt back away towards the greenhouse or risk dying to sunlight, and others of this pack have already blocked my escape routes elsewhere.¬† Crap.¬† I need to buy time.

‚ÄúInside. I invoke sanctuary. This is a sanctuary. No actions that would cause harm are allowed here.¬† How are you managing?‚Äù¬† Get him talking.¬† Monologues are an egotistical moron‚Äôs favorite thing.

‚ÄúI have this spear. Speaking of, let me introduce you to the pointy end.‚Äù¬† He gets ready to throw.¬† SO this is how it ends? I am facing my permanent death and all I can think of is how unfair it is that I found the one somewhat competent werewolf that isn‚Äôt chatty.

An arrow goes flying from behind him and impales my chest. It missed my heart by a millimeter.¬† I still fall as the impact stuns me. Wait, why is a tree starting to grow out of my chest?!¬† It‚Äôs drinking my blood.¬† It is using my own blood to feed its growth. The tree‚Äôs roots push and fold me until I am buried under it. The tree stops after the roots cover me completely.¬† I realize I must have vanished to anyone outside these roots. Clever.

I hear the old centaurs voice as my world gets dark. ‚ÄúNo trespassers!‚Äù I can‚Äôt see anything anymore, but I can hear well enough to get the basic idea of what happens.

The head werewolf turns at Skeritt and growls.¬† ‚ÄúYou stole my kill, old horse.‚Äù

Another arrow is notched from the noise I can hear. ‚ÄúThe vampire was warned against coming here long ago.‚Äù I was?! When?!?! HUH?! ‚ÄúNow it is your turn. No trespassing. Leave.‚Äù

‚ÄúHa, you think a doddery old has been like you can defeat me! Look and tremble.¬† I have the Spear of Lugh.¬† I am unbeatable!¬† What could you ever hope to do‚Ä¶‚Äù

At this point I stop listening for a moment and get really angry that this dog-fucking asshole of a pack leader actually does monologue!¬† The asshole just didn‚Äôt consider me important enough to monologue at‚Ä¶ FUCK HIM!

I hear an arrow strike flesh and screaming. Maybe I should listen again?

‚ÄúYou personally are unbeatable, yes, but the rest of your pack will be plant food before you can kill me. Want to lose some more?¬† Also, I can close this door and unless you are willing to throw and lose your weapon, you won‚Äôt stop me from escaping.¬† Leave. Before all the ArchFae I called show up.¬† Oberon is on the elevator right now.‚Äù

A whistle.¬† Another scream.¬† Wow, the old centaur does not kid around.

‚ÄúWe leave.¬† Know this, forest walker, you will come to rue this‚Ä¶‚Äù. Another scream cuts him off. ‚ÄúReally? In the middle of my dire warning, you just up and shoot one of my pack?!‚Äù

‚ÄúYou are taking too long. Git!‚Äù

‚ÄúRUE THE DAY FOREST WALKER!!!‚Äù¬† I hear him getting further away as he yells this. I hear a soft footstep and an even softer voice.

‚ÄúOkay Anton, I am going to be gentle pulling this tree out of you. Please be gentle helping me. I‚Äôd like to plant her here in a nice spot.‚Äù¬† This voice isn‚Äôt the centaur. I feel a hand grabbing the tree and it is cooperating by coming out as I gently assist in pulling it out. I see the creature is the second most terrifying creature of my existence. Only the fire-walker beats her. I need to remain calm and show no fangs or signs of aggression or risk a real death. ‚ÄúHello Connie.‚Äù

‚ÄúGood evening Anton.¬† You are doing quite well tonight.¬† You didn‚Äôt jump when you saw me!‚Äù

I can‚Äôt hide the annoyance on my face. ‚ÄúYes, well, you helped hide me, so I assume you are not intending to stake me for real unless I misbehave. I am safe then. I also need to be gracious to my saviors.‚Äù I bow to her. She smiles. Okay, maybe I can manage to not be afraid of her after that smile.¬† Even with her disguise removed she is beautiful. Actually, with it removed she is gorgeous.

The centaur has moved onto the deck properly and is watching the garou retreat. ‚ÄúIt seems the two we thought were the targets actually are not. At least not initially. Something tells me that that whelp is going to be trouble. Rue the day? Really? Who says that? Never let a moron have that much power. They get delusions of grandeur and more dangerously they get delusions of competence.‚Äù

I bow before him. ‚ÄúThank you, king of the centaurs. I owe you a life boon.‚Äù

He smiles. ‚ÄúYou invoked sanctuary. It was clever. No boon. I was merely following the accords.‚Äù

I shake my head. ‚ÄúYou did not need to. You have put your domain and people in danger for my worthless life. It is yours to command now.‚Äù Most of us are dead, but I will not allow my honor to be sullied by failing to show proper gratitude.

He sighs. ‚ÄúCome on then, you can help me plant some trees and we can find you a temporary room. I think the four corners have room for these trees. Connie, darling, help us quick so you can go back to your orgy.‚Äù She is bending over to place a new tree in the soil and it is a wonderful sight. Not that I am interested. Just aesthetics, is all.

She laughs. ‚ÄúThey are all pooped out. Watched the ball drop and then they went to bed before I came to talk to you. No coupling happened. It was a few very intense board games. Those ladies are competitive.‚Äù She sounds a little wistful.

He laughs. *I do not know what they are talking about, however anyone that would get this one to pine over them must be impressive. Wait. Did I just internally make a tree pun?!*

She turns to me. ‚ÄúWhy yes, yes you did, and it was great. Also, remember we can hear intense thoughts directed our way. And you should stop looking at my ass. She winks and I remember to be scared of her again. *FUCK!*

‚ÄúAwwww, come on sweetie. You are only in danger with me if I am the one doing the impaling.‚Äù

I am a creature that can control the flow of blood within my body perfectly. So why is THAT suddenly getting all the blood.

Skerrit laughs.

‚ÄúI see you have just started a pranking phase‚Ä¶ Quit teasing and/or flirting with the poor vampire and see if Todd has company tonight or if he can put up our new guest.‚Äù

‚ÄúYes, my King.‚Äù

‚ÄúAnd stop calling me that, you haven‚Äôt been in my court for a year.‚Äù

As she walks up to him her legs grow longer until they are the same height. She is face to face with him as she kisses his cheek. ‚ÄúAnd yet I call you my king because you have earned my respect and love many times over.‚Äù¬† He gently touches her cheek.

‚ÄúIf I were a few dozen centuries younger, young lady‚Ä¶‚Äù

‚ÄúKinky.‚Äù¬† She winks, laughs, touches foreheads with him. ‚ÄúI love you too, Skerrit. Come on, Anton, Todd is a bit of a night owl but we should still get there soon. Let‚Äôs get this new addition to my grove planted. Sorry your night is getting cut so short.‚Äù

‚ÄúI am not. I am just glad it hasn‚Äôt ended permanently.‚Äù¬† My sincerity is met with her chuckles.

¬†

**A few hours later.**

¬†

‚ÄúHuh?‚Äù

‚ÄúCan you put up a vampire for a night?‚Äù¬† Connie is bright and cheerful. Meanwhile the troll I have begun to think of as an acquaintance, maybe even a friend, is staring at her in a pair of pajama pants. He looks at me. He obviously just woke up.

‚ÄúAnton, right?‚Äù

I nod. He smiles. All his real teeth show. I thought my fangs can be scary. His entire mouth is filled with teeth that make my fangs seem tame.

‚ÄúHow long?‚Äù

‚ÄúJust tonight and the day. He needs to be safe from sunlight. After that we can figure out how to get him somewhere safe. He invoked sanctuary. Some werewolves attacked him.‚Äù

‚ÄúDid they do it at twilight?‚Äù¬† He snickers.

‚ÄúI appreciate the stupid pun, but I would ask you not to use THAT author‚Äôs work in your further mocking efforts. It is a sore spot‚Ä¶‚Äù I know I have no room to make such a request.

‚ÄúGot it. Fine by me. Okay, Beth‚Äôs with friends studying so I have room and no roommate to worry about. You need to tank up?‚Äù

‚ÄúUm‚Ä¶ what?‚Äù

‚ÄúDO.¬† YOU.¬† NEED.¬† TO.¬† FEED?‚Äù

‚ÄúOh, while I am down quite a bit, I am not in immediate danger nor am I one.‚Äù¬† I have never had someone ask that without terror in their voice.

‚ÄúIf you do, I don‚Äôt know if my blood will work but I kinda heal fast and it wouldn‚Äôt bug me too much, so let me know. Got it from here, sis.‚Äù

She touches foreheads with him as she did Skerrit . ‚ÄúThanks Todd. You are the best. Beth is lucky.‚Äù

He laughs. ‚ÄúNah, I am the lucky one there. Thanks to Pat and Jackie. Speaking of, you get either of them to kiss you tonight?‚Äù

She looks very annoyed. ‚ÄúNo.‚Äù

‚ÄúJust keep vibing with them. Jackie knows. She always knows. Pat is the one ya gotta reach and we know how dense she is. If she kisses you, Jackie will be happy to. Jackie isn‚Äôt going to force something by starting a thing with you. Though I still think that is a bit dangerous for you. She loses control for even a second‚Ä¶‚Äù

‚ÄúI am willing to take that risk. She is worth it. They both are.‚Äù

‚ÄúGirl, you really gotta learn how to fall in love to less dangerous people. I get it though. Hard not to with them. Okay, nerd, let‚Äôs go. Night gorgeous.‚Äù

‚ÄúNight big bro.‚Äù

She hugs him and it is one of the most tender embraces I have seen. She really meant that brother comment.

I walk into a very modern cave. It is the only description that makes sense. The lights are dim, it feels like a cave, and the funny part is that it is immaculate.¬†

‚ÄúI would not have guessed this.‚Äù

He laughs. ‚ÄúI am not a neet.¬† I am a student and have a girlfriend. I better be hygienic and clean. I want to be the best I can for her. Come on, the futon is perfect for you. I have Fae enchanted full sunlight blocking blinds. I do like my cave dark when not entertaining people. It is safe for you. Bathroom is this way in case you need to wash up, towels here.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhy are you doing this?‚Äù

He chuckles. ‚ÄúLil sis Connie asked. There are less than 10 people I will do anything for. She is one of them. And you have behaved well with Lemar. He thinks you are pretty fun.‚Äù

I nod. ‚ÄúLemar and his wife are amazing. Their little baby girl, Celeste, is such a cute one.‚Äù

‚ÄúA cute one you got a warded silver cross for. The ward tells vampires and other night creatures to back off because they are yours, right?‚Äù

‚ÄúYou all know about it?‚Äù¬† I am shocked and a little worried. Did I overstep a line?

He laughs and claps me in the back. ‚ÄúMy boss saw the magic linking it to someone outside the CaFae. She can do that. After she looked at it a bit, she realized it wasn‚Äôt dangerous or malicious, and they puzzled out it was a protection spell. Lemar has been quiet about it because he isn‚Äôt sure how favors, gifts and such work with your kind and he will just pay if you ask him to. He knows that‚Ä¶ FUCK.‚Äù¬† His face shows the recognition of danger.

I realize it at the same time. I take out my cell phone and call Lemar. ‚ÄúI will warn them!‚Äù¬† Todd begins calling someone as well.

‚ÄúDude, I have a 4am shift. Why are you calling so late?‚Äù¬† Lemar sounds asleep and annoyed. Unhurt. Good.

No time for pleasantries. ‚ÄúI was attacked by werewolves. They think me dead. Put Celeste‚Äôs cross in that silver jewelry box I gave May, quickly.‚Äù

He sounds completely awake. ‚ÄúGot it. Moving. Thank you, man.‚Äù

‚ÄúPlease let me not be too late.‚Äù

‚ÄúDone. Okay. So, no hairy attackers so far. Will that prevent them?‚Äù

‚ÄúIt should mask the fact that I am still alive and make them believe whatever I did for you is gone and you are not important enough to bother with. If they even knew. If not, they will feel no blood magic within your home. I am sorry, my friend. My intent was to protect her from my kind and other night creatures. Not for you to be in danger.‚Äù

I can hear the gratitude in his voice. ‚ÄúNo need to apologize.¬† I have been thankful since we got it. Little baby girl sleeps soundly with it hanging on her crib.¬† It really did make her cry less at night. We got her with us now. Thanks.‚Äù

That bothers me. ‚ÄúIf I may visit when this is all over, I would like to be invited to your home to talk with whatever is causing that. Uninvite me after.‚Äù

‚ÄúUnderstood. You are welcome within my home. And you won‚Äôt be uninvited. Thank you, friend.‚Äù

He hangs up. I‚Ä¶ I haven‚Äôt had someone call me friend in decades. It feels nice.

‚ÄúWe have a pixie checking the place. She may not fight, but no one is going to get in before she summons someone that can. We look after our own. Lemar and May are two of the other people that can ask anything of me. So, yea. Grats, you just impressed me even more. You are all right.‚Äù

We talk for a bit and Todd retires to bed.

I guess I am tired?¬† Them being in danger bothers me.¬† After an eventful evening and some time chatting with a kind troll, I start to fall asleep.¬† Before I feel Dawn come. For the first time since I became a vampire I am not in my home when I fall asleep and I feel perfectly safe.

Short chapter today.  Here we go folks, the action has started. Connie has a grove again! I finally had a centaur use a bow. Hope you enjoy our antagonist.

1okuv26,https://www.reddit.com/r/CelsiusNetworkTRUTH/comments/1okuv26/here_is_meaning_of_human_civilization/,here is meaning of human civilization,"Practical Explanation ( For Example ) :- \`1st of all can you tell me every single seconds detail from that time when you born ?? ( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Here is no Question of Holy Books quotes, Personal Experiences, Faith or Belief. i accept that Sometimes Faith is also Blind. Here is already Practical explanation which already proved that every\`1 else in this world is nothing more then Busy Foolish and totally idiot.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Source(s):

every \`1 is already Blind in this world and if you will follow another Blind then you both will fall in hole. so try to follow that person who have Spiritual Eyes who can Guide you on Actual Right Path. ( my Authority & Guide is my Spiritual Master "" Srila Prabhupada "" )

1okuugi,https://www.reddit.com/r/story/comments/1okuugi/i_woke_up_from_a_coma_and_found_out_my_best/,I Woke Up From a Coma and Found Out My Best Friend Knocked Up My Wife,"Warning: This is gonna be a LONG story, probably one of the longest you‚Äôll read today, so strap in. I‚Äôve split it into parts for your sanity, with timestamps for easy navigation. You don‚Äôt have to read it all in one go, but I promise it‚Äôs a wild ride. I don‚Äôt care if you believe me or not‚Äîthis whole thing feels like a fever dream to me too. If my family or anyone involved sees this, I‚Äôm not holding back, but I‚Äôm also not dropping names or specifics to keep things anonymous. Let‚Äôs dive in.

I‚Äôm a 34-year-old guy, living in a mid-sized town in the Midwest, USA. Before everything went to hell, I had a decent life. Not perfect, but solid. I co-founded a small logistics company with my younger brother, Matt (31), about five years ago. It was a scrappy operation, hauling freight for local businesses, nothing glamorous like Silicon Valley startups, but we were proud of it. I owned 60% of the shares, Matt had 40%, and we were just starting to get traction. Long hours, late nights, and constant hustling to get investors on board. I was the face of the company, the one shaking hands and closing deals, while Matt handled operations. He‚Äôs a good guy‚Äîsmart, reliable, the kind of brother you‚Äôd want in your corner. Growing up, we were tight, even though I was always the ‚Äúresponsible‚Äù one, bailing him out of dumb teenage stunts. Our parents, Mom (58) and Dad (60), were blue-collar folks who raised us to work hard. They‚Äôre not perfect‚ÄîMom‚Äôs got a temper, Dad‚Äôs quiet but stubborn‚Äîbut they were always there for us.
Then there‚Äôs my wife, Sarah (33). We met in college, got married seven years ago. No kids, which was a mutual choice, at least I thought so. Sarah‚Äôs beautiful, sharp, and charming when she wants to be, but she‚Äôs always had this restless energy. Like she was waiting for something bigger, something more exciting than our life. I loved her, and I thought we were solid. She‚Äôd get moody sometimes, especially when I was swamped with work, but I figured it was just her needing space. I never suspected anything deeper. Looking back, I was blind, but at the time, I thought we were happy.
My best friend, Jake (34), was the last piece of the puzzle. We‚Äôve known each other since high school, the kind of friend who‚Äôd help you move a couch at 2 a.m. no questions asked. He‚Äôs a mechanic, owns a small auto shop in town. Jake‚Äôs a charmer‚Äîtall, easygoing, always got a story to tell. He and Sarah were friendly, but I never thought twice about it. They‚Äôd chat at barbecues or when Jake came over to watch a game, but it was normal, or so I thought. I trusted them both completely. Why wouldn‚Äôt I? They were the two people I was closest to, besides Matt.
Life was busy but good. The company was finally getting some big contracts, and I was driving home from a meeting with potential investors on a rainy October night in 2023. It was late, maybe 10 p.m., and I was exhausted but pumped. The investors were interested, and if we played our cards right, the company could double in size. I was on a two-lane road, music playing low, thinking about how I‚Äôd tell Sarah the good news. Then, out of nowhere, a truck swerved into my lane. I don‚Äôt remember much‚Äîjust headlights, the screech of tires, and then nothing.

I woke up in a hospital bed, disoriented, with tubes everywhere and a headache that felt like someone was drilling into my skull. The lights were too bright, the beeping machines too loud. A nurse was checking something on a monitor, and when she saw my eyes open, she gasped and called for a doctor. I tried to talk, but my throat was dry, and my body felt like it weighed a thousand pounds. The doctor came in, a kind older guy, and explained what happened. I‚Äôd been in a head-on collision. Broken ribs, a fractured leg, and a traumatic brain injury that put me in a coma. For two years. It was now November 2025.
Two years. Gone. I couldn‚Äôt wrap my head around it. I was 32 when I crashed, and now I was 34. The world had moved on without me. I asked about Sarah, Matt, my parents. The doctor said they‚Äôd been notified I was awake and were on their way. I lay there, trying to process it, feeling like I‚Äôd been dropped into someone else‚Äôs life. My muscles were weak, my voice raspy. They told me I‚Äôd need physical therapy to walk properly again, but my brain seemed okay, aside from some gaps in memory around the crash.
When my parents arrived, they looked older, worn out. Mom was crying, hugging me so tight it hurt my ribs. Dad just stood there, gripping my hand, not saying much. Matt came in next, looking like he‚Äôd aged a decade. He hugged me too, said he‚Äôd missed me, that he‚Äôd been running the company while I was out. I asked about Sarah. They all got quiet, exchanging looks. Finally, Mom said, ‚ÄúShe‚Äôs‚Ä¶ not here right now, honey. We‚Äôll talk about it later.‚Äù That‚Äôs when I knew something was wrong. I pressed, but they dodged, saying I needed to rest. I was too weak to argue, but my gut told me something was off.

It took a few days for me to get the full story. I was still in the hospital, hooked up to IVs, trying to piece together what happened while I was ‚Äúasleep.‚Äù Matt was the one who finally told me, after I kept pushing. Sarah had moved on. With Jake. My best friend. They‚Äôd been together for over a year, living in our house‚Äîthe one I‚Äôd bought with my savings, the one we‚Äôd planned our future in. They had a kid now, a one-year-old girl named Lily.
It was like the world stopped. My wife and my best friend? Together? I felt like I‚Äôd been stabbed in the back, then run over for good measure. I didn‚Äôt know whether to cry or scream. I just sat there, staring at the ceiling, while Matt tried to explain. Apparently, Sarah had been a wreck after the accident, visiting me every day for the first few months. But as time dragged on, and the doctors weren‚Äôt sure I‚Äôd ever wake up, she started pulling away. Jake was there for her, at first as a friend, then as something more. By the time I‚Äôd been in the coma for a year, they were openly together. Sarah told everyone she couldn‚Äôt keep living in limbo, that she had to ‚Äúmove forward.‚Äù Jake moved into our house, and when Lily was born, they acted like a happy little family.
I was blindsided. I‚Äôd never suspected a thing. All those times Jake and Sarah laughed together, the barbecues, the game nights‚ÄîI thought it was just them being friendly. I trusted them. How could I have been so stupid? I wanted to confront them, demand answers, maybe even hurt them. But I was stuck in a hospital bed, barely able to sit up without help. For a week, I stewed in rage and heartbreak. I kept replaying every memory, searching for clues I‚Äôd missed, but there was nothing. They‚Äôd played me for a fool. Sarah didn‚Äôt visit. Neither did Jake.

A month later, I was discharged. I‚Äôd made progress in physical therapy, enough to walk with a cane, though I tired easily. Matt drove me to our parents‚Äô house, where I‚Äôd be staying until I figured things out. My house‚Äîour house‚Äîwas occupied by Sarah, Jake, and their kid. I had nothing. No home, no wife, no best friend. Just a hospital bill the size of a small country and a company I hadn‚Äôt been part of for two years.
When I got to my parents‚Äô place, it felt like stepping into a museum of my old life. My childhood bedroom was the same, down to the faded posters on the walls. Mom fussed over me, cooking my favorite meals, but I could tell she was walking on eggshells, afraid to bring up Sarah. Dad was quieter than usual, just watching me like he expected me to break. Matt was the only one who seemed normal, filling me in on the company. Apparently, it had taken off under his leadership. Those investors I‚Äôd met with before the crash? They came through, and the business was now worth millions. My shares were still mine, which meant I was technically rich, but it didn‚Äôt feel real. Not when I was sleeping in my old twin bed, feeling like a ghost.
A week later, I couldn‚Äôt avoid it anymore. I needed to see Sarah, to understand why. Matt drove me to the house. My house. It looked different‚Äînew curtains, a tricycle in the driveway. I knocked, my heart pounding. Sarah answered, and for a second, we just stared at each other. She looked tired, older, but still beautiful. Jake was behind her, holding a toddler with big brown eyes. Lily. My stomach churned.
Sarah invited me in, her voice shaky. Jake wouldn‚Äôt meet my eyes. We sat in the living room‚Äîmy living room‚Äîand I asked her point-blank how she could do this. She started crying, saying she thought I was gone, that the doctors gave her no hope. She said she was lonely, scared, and Jake was there when I couldn‚Äôt be. Jake finally spoke, mumbling about how he never meant to hurt me, how things ‚Äújust happened.‚Äù I was too shocked to yell. I just felt numb. I asked about the house. Sarah said they‚Äôd been paying the mortgage, acting like it was theirs now. I told them I wanted it back. It was mine, bought with my money, in my name. They got quiet, then Sarah said they‚Äôd need time to figure things out.
I left feeling like I‚Äôd lost something I couldn‚Äôt name. That night, I lay awake, replaying the conversation, hating them both. But a small part of me wondered if I was being unfair. Sarah thought I‚Äôd never wake up. Could I blame her for moving on? And Jake‚Ä¶ he was my friend, but maybe he really was just trying to help her. I didn‚Äôt know what to believe.

The next day, I went to a coffee shop to clear my head. That‚Äôs where I met Emily (33), an old high school classmate I hadn‚Äôt seen in years. She was sitting alone, looking as lost as I felt. We got talking, and it turned out her life had imploded too‚Äîher mom had passed away from cancer a few months ago, and she was struggling to keep it together. I don‚Äôt know why, but I spilled everything‚Äîmy coma, Sarah, Jake, the house. Emily listened, really listened, and when I was done, she told me her mom‚Äôs death had left her fighting her own family over inheritance. She was a lawyer now, specializing in family law, and offered to help me get my house back. I don‚Äôt know if it was her kind eyes or the fact that I was desperate, but I said yes.
Emily was a godsend. She dug into the legal mess‚ÄîSarah and Jake had no claim to the house, but they‚Äôd been living there rent-free, using my money to cover the mortgage while I was in the coma. Emily filed paperwork to start eviction proceedings and a lawsuit to recover the money Sarah had spent from our joint accounts. Apparently, she‚Äôd drained them, claiming she needed it to ‚Äúsurvive‚Äù while I was out. Emily was fierce, working late nights with me, going over documents, strategizing. We started spending more time together, grabbing coffee or dinner after meetings. She got me‚Äîmy anger, my hurt, the way I felt like my life had been stolen. I started to feel something for her, but I pushed it down. I wasn‚Äôt ready for that, not yet.
Meanwhile, Matt was thrilled I was back. He‚Äôd done an incredible job with the company, turning it into a regional powerhouse. He insisted I jump back in, even if just part-time while I recovered. It felt good to have something to focus on besides my messed-up personal life. Matt and I worked well together, like old times, but I could tell he felt guilty about how well the company had done without me. I told him not to worry‚ÄîI was proud of him. He‚Äôd stepped up when I couldn‚Äôt.
The lawsuit against Sarah was brutal. She fought dirty, claiming I‚Äôd ‚Äúabandoned‚Äù her, that she deserved the house for all she‚Äôd been through. Jake backed her up, saying they‚Äôd built a life there. Emily tore their arguments apart in court, proving the house was mine and that Sarah had no legal right to it. The judge gave them 60 days to move out. Sarah called me, screaming, saying I was ruining her life, that Lily needed a home. I told her she should‚Äôve thought of that before moving my best friend into our bed. It felt good to say it, but it didn‚Äôt erase the pain.

A few weeks after the court ruling, I was at a bar, trying to unwind. That‚Äôs when Jake walked in. He looked rough‚Äîbags under his eyes, clothes rumpled. He saw me and hesitated, then came over. I braced myself for a fight, but he just sat down and ordered a beer. We didn‚Äôt talk for a while, just sat there in this awkward silence. Then he said something that floored me: ‚ÄúI always wanted kids, man. But I don‚Äôt think Lily‚Äôs mine.‚Äù
I froze. He kept talking, saying he‚Äôd started noticing things‚ÄîLily‚Äôs eyes were too much like mine, her smile too familiar. He‚Äôd done the math, and the timeline of Sarah‚Äôs pregnancy didn‚Äôt add up. He thought she‚Äôd been pregnant before they got together, maybe even before my accident. He hadn‚Äôt confronted her yet, but he was planning to get a DNA test.
My head was spinning. Could Lily be mine? I hadn‚Äôt even considered it‚ÄîSarah and Jake‚Äôs betrayal had been such a shock, I assumed Lily was theirs. The idea that she could be my daughter hit me like a freight train. I didn‚Äôt say much, just nodded and left. The next day, I called Emily. She was skeptical but said we could get a court-ordered DNA test if I wanted to pursue it. I wasn‚Äôt sure what I wanted. Part of me hoped it was true‚ÄîI‚Äôd lost everything else, and the idea of having a daughter, a piece of my old life, felt like a lifeline. But it also terrified me. What if she was mine, and Sarah had kept it from me?
Emily helped me get access to Lily‚Äôs medical records through the court, citing my suspicion as grounds for a paternity test. It was a long shot, but the judge approved it. Sarah fought it, saying I was delusional, that I was trying to destroy her family. But Emily was relentless. We got a sample from Lily‚Äîhair from her brush, collected by a neutral third party‚Äîand sent it for testing.
While we waited for the results, Emily and I grew closer. We weren‚Äôt dating, not exactly, but there was something there. Late nights working on the case turned into long conversations about life, loss, and starting over. She told me about her mom, how losing her had shattered her sense of home. I told her about the coma, how it felt like waking up in a world that didn‚Äôt want me anymore. We were both broken, but together, we felt a little less alone.

The DNA test results came back three weeks later. I was at Emily‚Äôs office when she opened the envelope. She looked at me, her eyes wide, and handed me the paper. Positive. Lily was mine.
I don‚Äôt know how to describe what I felt. Joy, anger, relief, fear‚Äîall at once. Lily was my daughter, conceived before the accident, before Sarah and Jake betrayed me. Sarah had known, or at least suspected, and never told me. She‚Äôd let Jake believe Lily was his, let him raise her in my house, while I was lying in a coma. The betrayal cut even deeper now‚Äîshe hadn‚Äôt just moved on, she‚Äôd hidden my child from me.
I confronted Sarah at a neutral location‚Äîa diner, with Emily there as my lawyer. Sarah broke down, admitting she‚Äôd found out she was pregnant a week before my accident. She was scared, didn‚Äôt know if she wanted a kid, and then the crash happened. She said she couldn‚Äôt handle raising a baby alone, so when Jake stepped in, she let him believe Lily was his. She swore she didn‚Äôt know for sure until the test, but I didn‚Äôt believe her. She‚Äôd lied to everyone, including herself.
I was done with her. I told her I was filing for custody of Lily. Emily backed me up, saying we had a strong case given Sarah‚Äôs deception and unstable living situation‚Äîshe and Jake were now renting a tiny apartment, barely making ends meet. The custody battle was ugly. Sarah painted me as an absentee father, saying I‚Äôd been ‚Äúgone‚Äù for two years. Emily countered with medical records proving I‚Äôd been in a coma, not choosing to abandon my daughter. The judge was sympathetic, especially after seeing the DNA results and Sarah‚Äôs lies. I got primary custody, with Sarah getting supervised visitation.

It‚Äôs been six months since I got custody of Lily. She‚Äôs two now, a bright, curious kid with my eyes and Sarah‚Äôs smile. Taking care of her is hard‚ÄîI‚Äôm still relearning how to walk without a limp, and single parenting is no joke‚Äîbut she‚Äôs my world. Every time she laughs or grabs my hand, I feel like I‚Äôve been given a second chance.
The house is mine again. Sarah and Jake moved out, and I‚Äôve been fixing it up, making it a home for Lily. Emily‚Äôs been a huge part of that. We‚Äôre dating now, taking it slow, but it feels right. She‚Äôs great with Lily, and for the first time in years, I feel like I‚Äôm building something new.
The company‚Äôs doing better than ever. Matt and I are equal partners now‚ÄîI gave him half my shares as a thank-you for keeping it alive while I was out. He‚Äôs dating someone new, a teacher named Claire, and they‚Äôre good together. My parents are trying to make amends, visiting often to see Lily, but it‚Äôs complicated. I‚Äôm still angry about how they handled things while I was in the coma, how they didn‚Äôt push Sarah to be there when I woke up. We‚Äôre working on it, but it‚Äôll take time.
As for Jake, he apologized, but I told him we‚Äôre done. He‚Äôs out of my life, and I don‚Äôt care if he‚Äôs sorry. Sarah‚Äôs a different story‚ÄîI have to deal with her because of Lily, but I keep it civil and distant. She‚Äôs struggling, working odd jobs, living with her mom now. I don‚Äôt wish her ill, but I don‚Äôt feel sorry for her either.

Update 1: Three Months Later
Lily‚Äôs settling in, but it‚Äôs not all sunshine. She asks about Sarah sometimes, and it breaks my heart to explain why Mommy doesn‚Äôt live with us. I‚Äôm honest without being cruel‚Äîshe‚Äôs too young to understand the whole mess. Emily‚Äôs been a rock, helping me navigate the toddler tantrums and late-night worries. We‚Äôre talking about moving in together, but I‚Äôm hesitant. Not because I don‚Äôt love her‚ÄîI do‚Äîbut because I want to make sure Lily‚Äôs stable first.
The company hit a rough patch last month. A major client pulled out, and Matt and I had to scramble to cover the loss. It reminded me how fragile things are, even when they seem solid. We‚Äôre pulling through, but it‚Äôs a wake-up call.
I ran into Jake at the grocery store last week. He looked like hell‚Äîunshaven, eyes bloodshot. He tried to talk, said he‚Äôs been struggling since the breakup with Sarah. I didn‚Äôt know what to say, so I just nodded and walked away. Part of me feels bad for him, but then I remember Lily, and any sympathy dries up.

Update 2: Six Months Later
Big news: Emily moved in. It‚Äôs been a game-changer. She‚Äôs taken on so much with Lily, and they‚Äôre inseparable. I proposed last month, nothing fancy, just us on the couch after Lily went to bed. She said yes, and we‚Äôre planning a small wedding next year. Matt‚Äôs gonna be my best man, which feels right.
The custody situation with Sarah‚Äôs gotten messy again. She‚Äôs been missing visitation, claiming she‚Äôs too busy with work. I think she‚Äôs spiraling‚ÄîMatt heard from a mutual friend she‚Äôs been partying a lot, maybe drinking too much. I worry about what it means for Lily, but Emily says we‚Äôll handle it, and I trust her.
The company‚Äôs back on track, and we landed a new contract that could take us national. Matt‚Äôs pushing for it, but I‚Äôm cautious‚Äîdon‚Äôt want to overextend ourselves. Mom and Dad are coming around more, trying to be grandparents to Lily. It‚Äôs awkward, but I‚Äôm letting them in, little by little.

Update 3: One Year Later
I‚Äôm writing this from the park, watching Lily play on the swings. She‚Äôs three now, full of energy, and calls Emily ‚ÄúMama Em.‚Äù It makes my heart ache in a good way. The wedding‚Äôs in three months, and Matt‚Äôs planning a ridiculous bachelor party I‚Äôm pretending to hate.
Sarah‚Äôs out of the picture, mostly. She moved to another state, said she needed a ‚Äúfresh start.‚Äù She hasn‚Äôt seen Lily in six months, and I‚Äôm not sure she ever will again. I‚Äôm okay with that‚ÄîLily‚Äôs got a family with me, Emily, Matt, and my parents. The company‚Äôs thriving, and we‚Äôre hiring new staff, which feels surreal after everything.
One last thing: I found an old photo of me, Sarah, and Jake from before the accident, tucked in a drawer. I looked at it for a long time, then threw it out. That life‚Äôs gone, and I‚Äôm not looking back.

Take home is around 2280, rent is 910, paid on the 1st and 15th. Most of my bills hit in the last week of the month and I kept coming up short by like 40 or 60. The bank would cover it and slap a fee, then the next payment would bounce, and the spiral would start. I wrote every bill on a paper calendar and called them one by one. Power let me change the date for free, water too. Internet moved it once per year no charge. Car insurance let me push the draft five days with no fee after I asked nicely. Credit card said there was a 10 dollar change fee, I asked for a manager and they waived it. Not fancy negotiating, just please and thank you and a short why. I aimed all fixed bills to the week right after payday so money is actually sitting there when the autopays pull.

At the credit union I opened a free checking and turned overdraft off completely, card now declines instead of charging me 35 for a coffee. I made two sub accounts, Bills and Spend. On each payday 65 percent goes straight to Bills with an automatic transfer. Autopays are set to the next morning so the deposit clears first. I kept a tiny buffer by selling an old monitor for 25 and doing a Saturday shift, total starter cushion was 120. Groceries got a simple rule, write a five meal list before I walk in, buy one loss leader meat or bean bag, and grab the store brand every time. I freeze portions in yogurt tubs I saved. Phone went to a cheaper plan at the end of the current cycle, I asked for a loyalty credit and got 10 for three months which helped bridge.

Numbers after six weeks. Overdraft fees were 70 to 105 per month before, now zero because the card just declines, annoying but cheaper. Two late fees did not happen, that is another 30 saved. Gas fell by about 18 because I bought a bus pass for the two days I go downtown instead of paying for parking. Total saved right now is about 102 each month plus less random panic. I know this is basic stuff and other people already do it, I just never lined the dates up. If you try this, write the names and confirmation numbers, and ask if there is a hardship option first. If you have other bill timing tricks, please drop them, I will try them and report back.",16,1761917780.0,povertyfinance,4,0.94,False

1okuqpu,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1okuqpu,Day 2,"Day one was nothing but confidence, day two‚Ä¶ challenges.

Got a hold of a bit of 400# and some advice from a buddy for a cup of coffee and a joint, then headed out to the crisp, surprisingly dry autumn air to keep the momentum rolling. A gentle breeze was rolling through and I started spraying. Turns out, that gentle breeze caused some of the paint to create little bubbles of paint, almost like stucco. No biggie, sandpaper handled that after it dried. But I noticed a small section that looked like it was developing scales, and when I would sand it, they seemed more resilient than the paint and became more pronounced with work. A few coats later. They‚Äôre gone.

Now, finally at a point where my can was running out, I felt confident that we were getting close to being ready to call painting done‚Ä¶ but as I moved it, and was very almost out of paint, I accidentally hit the top of the neck pocket, which is pictured. Not the biggest issue, but it sets me back a day or two before I can get a chance to snag another can.

What I learned, a gentle breeze is not gentle if you are a tiny little orb of paint and don‚Äôt count your chickens. Paint is finicky and will trick you into thinking you‚Äôre good at it, but even if you‚Äôre not, it‚Äôs ok, it turns out that these chunks of wood and screws are kinda tough and spray paint, nor sandpaper seem to be enough to destroy your guitar body unless you‚Äôre incredibly creative!

Today and tomorrow are probably going to be minimally productive on doing things to the actual guitar, but I know that I‚Äôve been extremely lucky this fall in being able to get outside to actually spray stuff. I live in a RAINY part of the world, so I started to think ahead and I happen to have a few building/painting supplies from moving into my house and have an out of the way side door that never gets used. I started using some of the skills I got from guerrilla indoor gardening back in the day to construct a little spray booth that I can use for a couple weeks while I‚Äôm dealing with clear. I feel like Dexter right now, with my little plastic room, lmfaoo!

Thanks again for all the encouragement and inspiration, it‚Äôs really incredible seeing this thing come together!

To experienced painters: 

I wish I had a picture of the scales I was experiencing, it almost looked like warts. It was only in a small area, maybe the size of a nickel and the spots were maybe the size of a ball end of a guitar string, pretty oval shaped and relatively uniform. What was it?

Going into clear. Should I wet sand and clean the surface before I begin clear coating? I understand that the clear coat will not need to be sanded between layers but will need to be finished with a fine sand and some buffing. If I wet sand it, what would you suggest cleaning the surface with, alcohol?

Would love some honest advice.,"Here‚Äôs my story ‚Äî it‚Äôs long, but I want to share it fully so that you can understand the whole picture.

Let me start by telling you a bit about myself. I (23M) recently joined a Master‚Äôs program at one of the reputed government institutes in the country. I like to keep my circle small ‚Äî at every stage of life I have made one or two close friends and they have always stayed. I never really had much interaction with girls, and between studies and everything else, I just never got the time or chance to fall into a relationship. I don‚Äôt use Instagram or Facebook. I like reading books, research papers, listening to old classics, watching shows and movies and enjoy playing sports or outdoor games. I‚Äôm around 5'9"", with an athletic body .

I think that‚Äôs enough about me ‚Äî now about her.

**Phase-1 (Till coursework starting):\[First 15 days\]**

I first saw her during our batch gathering after I moved into my hostel inside the campus ‚Äî few days before the course officially started. That night, after we all introduced ourselves and were about to leave, I met a guy who is now my closest friend. Around 10 p.m., he and I went for a walk, and when I was heading back to my hostel about an hour later (which is very close to the girls‚Äô hostel), I saw her coming out. I said ‚Äúhi‚Äù quietly, without even thinking. Honestly, I don‚Äôt know why I did that‚Ä¶ but that simple ‚Äúhi‚Äù became the root of everything. She recognized me and asked if I‚Äôd like to go for a walk (it was around 11 p.m.). I thought saying no would feel rude, so I joined her. We ended up walking and talking for about an hour ‚Äî sharing our backgrounds, hostel stories, and reasons for joining the course. \[let me tell one thing that she was from such a bachelor‚Äôs background that this course was going to be tough for her and she kind of knew that\] .Before parting, she asked me for some study-related resources and some useful playlists, which I sent her after coming back to my room. For context, she‚Äôs 24F (5'4"" maybe) with a slim body and that guy I met earlier is from the same state as her, though a different city. She and I are from different states but both from north India.

The next day, our seniors held a meeting with us around 10 p.m. We all went, had some introductions and discussions. While we were heading back to the hostels, I ran into her again ....she was behind me, and when I turned around, she caught my eye and started talking. We ended up going for another walk, talking about our families, studies, and how the course might go. Before we split for the night, she suggested we should explore the campus together the next afternoon, and I agreed because I also wanted to check out the departments before classes began as the campus was huge. The next day we met again and roamed around the campus for about two hours, just talking about random things nothing too personal like past relationships or anything. She mentioned she had spoken to one or two other girls from our batch, but among the boys, only me. I wasn‚Äôt too surprised ‚ÄîI felt like she was only talking to me because we were all new and she didn‚Äôt really know many people yet. She already knew that guy I had met the first night during the introduction time. Still, I did wonder why she chose to spend time with me. I also noticed that when she talks, she smiles a lot and keeps steady eye contact ‚Äî that was actually surprising. I‚Äôve never been that comfortable holding eye contact with girls.

Over the next few days a lot of things happened. She once mentioned she needed a phone cover for her new mobile but didn‚Äôt know the city well neither do I and since her relative stayed far from the institute, she asked me to help. I went with her, and that was one of our first times going out together. She would text me at random ‚Äî small things, nothing major. Once she sent a picture of a chocolate asking if I wanted some; I wasn‚Äôt really in the mood, so I just replied casually. I told her I sometimes play table tennis in my hostel court and she got interested, saying she‚Äôd like to play sometime and that I should call her. She also asked me to come to a few fresher events, but I‚Äôm not a crowd person, so I didn‚Äôt go. One evening, she asked me to help fix her institute Wi-Fi. Since boys aren‚Äôt allowed inside the girls‚Äô hostel, I asked her to come to the bench near my hostel it was raining, and we sat there while I got it working. One night we went cycling together around the campus, and later she showed me pictures of how she had decorated her hostel room. Sometimes she'd ask me what I was doing in my room. She‚Äôd also ask me study-related questions every now and then. I also noticed she says ‚Äòthank you‚Äô a lot ‚Äî for even the smallest things. By this point, I had a feeling she might be interested, but it had only been about fifteen days since we met, and I couldn‚Äôt tell if I was just overthinking. I kept my calm and didn‚Äôt say anything, though I had already started developing feelings for her. She was always the one to initiate our chats mostly and I would always reply.

**Phase-2 (After coursework Started):\[next 2 months\]**

When the coursework started, everyone in our batch knew it was going to be tough. We all tried focusing from the very first day. I was never the topper type, but I was confident in my specialized areas ‚Äî the ones that actually mattered for this program. Naturally, I started concentrating more on my studies, and our interaction began to slow down. She also got busier, talking more with other girls from the batch.

We had a few common courses, and one core subject together. I knew coursework would be difficult for her ....she had already told me that earlier ...so I didn‚Äôt want to disturb her. I began messaging her less, maybe every 3‚Äì4 days but she replied every time quick. The first time I did that, the very next day while walking to class, she casually asked what I was doing for the past three days. I told her I‚Äôd been studying in my room. But I could sense from her tone that she was a little disappointed. I don‚Äôt really talk much with other girls since I don‚Äôt know them that well. Also, by then, I had started liking her, so I didn‚Äôt think it would be right to talk too freely with other girls. We never really talked in front of anyone ‚Äî not that we planned it that way, it just happened. In class, I would usually sit with my close friend and chat with a few other guys.

One day she asked me to go for a walk, and I agreed. During that walk, I suggested that we could go for late-night walks on weekends after 11 p.m., and she agreed. I thought maybe I should also start putting in some effort from my side, so I suggested it. Slowly, I began messaging her even less since I had to focus on my own studies too, and I didn‚Äôt want to disturb her either. She did the same, and we mostly texted on weekends. Our talks were mainly about studying, which was fine with me since the coursework was genuinely tough[. ](http://tough.One)One day I called her to play table tennis, and after the game she asked me to show her a book I had mentioned before. I told her it was in my room, so she came for the first time. We talked only about studies, and then she left. When the first assignment came, she reached out again and came to my room to take pictures of my work. That‚Äôs when I began noticing a pattern ‚Äî she seemed to talk more when there were assignments or when she couldn‚Äôt figure something out, even using AI tools. Still, we would play TT on weekends, and she would always agree whenever I called her for walks. She once mentioned that if we continued playing TT regularly, we‚Äôd become really good in two years. During our weekend walks, she often told me that she gets tired studying at night and has dark circles under her eyes. I‚Äôd tell her to take care and not overdo it. She was focused on her career, at least that‚Äôs what she told me and I genuinely liked that about her.

In our batch, there were two boys and two girls ‚Äî let‚Äôs call them Boy A, Boy B, Girl A, and Girl B. Girl A is from my state, and I had talked to her once or twice earlier about some document-related queries. Like in every college, small groups slowly start forming over time, and she slowly became part of this group since the other two girls were already a part of it. Gradually, I noticed she began talking to other boys in a similar friendly way ‚Äî smiling, maintaining eye contact, and keeping the same tone ‚Äî and I realized that‚Äôs just how she naturally interacts with people.

Around this time, I told my close friend everything about her. He wasn‚Äôt surprised ‚Äî he said he had talked to her before about some document-related stuff since they‚Äôre from the same state, which sounded normal. There‚Äôs also another girl in our batch from my state, and I had walked and talked with her a couple of times for document verification matters. In fact, that other girl had called me for a walk for 2‚Äì3 days, and I went ‚Äî it was only during the first week after I moved into the hostel, and we just discussed some important official stuff, nothing more. So that part felt ordinary too. But then my friend mentioned that the girl I liked had called him as well to ask for notes and material. That confused me a bit because she usually asks me for that. Day by day, I noticed she texted me mostly when she needed something ‚Äî usually study-related. But we still continued our usual TT games on weekends and our walks.

One day, some days before an important exam, she asked me to go for a walk. During that walk, she talked mostly about the exam, which was fine by me. Suddenly, it started raining heavily, and we took shelter under a shed. We ended up talking about our families after a long time. Then she showed me her video assignment. I had asked her to show it earlier, but she had said it was a bit embarrassing.

That evening, she played it for me while it was raining. I didn‚Äôt watch the video directly ‚Äî I just listened to what she was saying and gave her feedback on what parts felt repetitive. I think she liked that I paid attention and listened carefully. After that, she started talking about a book she had read long ago.

When the rain slowed down, we walked back under my umbrella. The road was dark, and our shoulders brushed three times. Each time, she said ‚Äúsorry‚Äù softly. I didn‚Äôt say anything. I‚Äôve never intentionally or even accidentally touched her before I just don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs right unless both people are sure about each other‚Äôs feelings. Later that night, when I was about to sleep, she sent me the book she had mentioned and told me to read it. Then she asked if I write diary. I said I used to, back in school. She sent me a few pages from her own diary to read ‚Äî along with a picture of her room back home ‚Äî and suddenly she started calling me *‚Äúsir.‚Äù* That really surprised me. The diary pages weren‚Äôt deeply personal ‚Äî they were more about her mindset, how she wanted to change herself, become independent, not rely on anyone, etc. I actually liked what I read. I told her she could send me more if she wanted... I‚Äôd be happy to read them.

That same night, during our walk, we ended up making a small, silly challenge ‚Äî nothing serious ‚Äî but the deal was that whoever lost would treat the other person. I lost, and after two days, she came to play TT with me (just before exams...she was the one to initiate messages about playing TT..) and reminded me about the treat. I said I‚Äôd treat her, and we decided a particular date. By that time, though, I was honestly confused. I wanted to be sure whether she actually liked me or not.

So, after talking to a few of my old friends, they all advised me to just ask her out properly ‚Äî to invite her for a treat at a nice restaurant off-campus. I was hesitant at first because I was scared she might say no. But my every close friend said she‚Äôd definitely say yes after everything that had happened between us.

So, I gathered some courage and texted her after the exam was over. She replied nearly fifteen minutes later, saying, *‚ÄòYou took that so seriously; coffee or ice cream will do.‚Äô* Well‚Ä¶ yeah, I felt hurt ‚Äî kind of disappointed, actually. I don‚Äôt even know how to explain it. Somehow, I just said it‚Äôs okay if she only wants coffee ...changed the topic and made things a bit normal again.

The next day, I treated her and she mentioned that for some silly challenge, I don't need to give her a grand treat. After that, she started asking about what chocolates I liked, saying that she would like to treat me too. I told her I don‚Äôt usually take treats (I mean was kind of disappointed at that time) and I‚Äôm not that picky about chocolates .... I just eat whatever feels nice. She suggested we play TT again the next day. But honestly, I wasn‚Äôt feeling good anymore. For the first time, I didn‚Äôt call her to play.

She noticed. That day she even called me .... not directly about table tennis, but using a study-related excuse to start a conversation. I replied briefly and ended the call. By then, I had already noticed her talking to more guys lately, and one evening, when my friend and I were out for a walk after dinner, we saw her walking with Boy A.

That‚Äôs when it hit me ‚Äî maybe she likes someone else. Maybe Boy A, or Boy B, or maybe someone else entirely‚Ä¶ I don‚Äôt know. I wasn‚Äôt angry; she has every right to like whoever she wants. I just wish she hadn‚Äôt done all those earlier things that made me feel like she liked me. Well‚Ä¶ maybe that‚Äôs my problem. After that, I stopped initiating any messages, calling her for walks, or asking her to play TT. It‚Äôs not like I used to initiate messages much before, but now my replies became even shorter. She didn‚Äôt stop texting me, though ... mostly about studies couldn‚Äôt figure out if study was an excuse to talk to me.

One day, she asked me to go for a walk again. I hesitated. I knew it would probably just be about studies, but I couldn‚Äôt help wondering .... if she really likes someone else, why still walk with me at night? Anyway, I went. Nothing serious happened ‚Äî just the usual talk about studies and a few random topics. During the walk, she asked me to teach her a topic. I said she could come to my hostel and we could discuss it .... she had come before, after all. But this time she said she‚Äôd feel embarrassed to come to a boy‚Äôs hostel, though she would come to play TT, for which you have to enter the boys‚Äô hostel.

That confused me, because she has no problem calling me out for walks at night after 11 p.m. Even my friend was puzzled when I told him about it. But I‚Äôve noticed something: whenever she‚Äôs with me ‚Äî whether it‚Äôs during a walk or while playing TT ‚Äî she never mentions any other guy. She doesn‚Äôt talk about them at all. Her phone is always on silent when we‚Äôre together. Also, when she hands her phone to me to show a question or an assignment , she‚Äôll come really close while showing the screen. I can‚Äôt tell if she does that intentionally or not.

Also, over the past two months, I‚Äôve noticed her looking at me during class roughly one or two times. I can feel it when it happens. Even if I turn my eyes toward the professor or somewhere else, I can still sense she‚Äôs looking at me, even if just for a second or two.....not in every class, but it has happened enough times that I‚Äôve noticed.

**\[Last 1 month\]**

Well, she still stays with that same group during class ... I‚Äôve seen the three girls and those two boys, A and B, together most of the time. I haven‚Äôt really seen any other boys hang out with them (those 3 girls) that much. My friend once told me he saw her exchanging phone numbers with two other guys in class who aren‚Äôt from our batch....they were seniors maybe.. Maybe it was for study help or something academic, I‚Äôm not sure. Most of our seniors also know her ‚Äî she seems to talk to everyone and ask doubts quite openly. I honestly don‚Äôt know how many guys she talks to in her chats.

I mostly talked with her only among all the girls....usually when she initiates a message or says hello to me first ... like if we happened to see each other accidentally somewhere. I don‚Äôt really interact with other girls much since I don‚Äôt know them very well, but she was quite friendly with them. Interestingly, about a month and a half ago, she told me she wasn‚Äôt really able to fit in with those other two girls.

We still don‚Äôt talk in front of anyone, and I had stopped calling her for TT or walks. Seven days went by .... no messages, no chats, no interaction at all, not even in person.

Then our midterms came. Before the first exam, I was having breakfast at the food court since I woke up late and missed the mess timing. I didn‚Äôt notice at first, but she was sitting on the next bench, having tea. We both saw each other ‚Äî not at the same time, though. Neither of us spoke at first. She even walked past me once, and finally, I said ‚Äòhi.‚Äô It felt like she had been waiting for that, because the moment I said it, she came and sat in front of me. We ended up talking for about an hour ‚Äî mostly about the next day‚Äôs exam, her family, and a few random things. Then we left.

Before the second exam, we didn‚Äôt talk at all. But on the night before the third exam (a subject she knew I was good at), she texted me, saying she was confused about what to read and needed some help. I told her I was stepping out of my room for a short walk to refresh my mind and asked if she wanted to join so we could discuss it. She agreed immediately.

When we met, she barely talked about the exam. Instead, she asked why I wasn‚Äôt attending classes I told her I preferred watching some advanced lectures online since the professor‚Äôs teaching wasn‚Äôt great...she never asked this before. She said she had caught a cold 2-3 days back...and went to the I mean she could have told me.... anyway I told to take care. At one point, she asked again if I was going home during the December break, and I told her I‚Äôd be staying on campus to learn a few things before the next term begins. She mentioned she would also be staying on campus during the December break. She even told me to wear a jacket or a tracksuit to avoid catching a cold like her.

Honestly, I was surprised as she had never done this before but not too surprised ‚Äî I felt she might be talking to others in the same way too....I mean that caring way.

Mid-terms ended, and then Diwali came. She went to her relatives‚Äô house ‚Äî I got to know because I had texted her for a walk that evening, and she said she wasn‚Äôt on campus. I didn‚Äôt say much, just told her to enjoy Diwali. The next day, she messaged me again. There were two assignments due that day, and I had one sample file, so I sent it to her. She asked whether she should return to campus that day from her relative‚Äôs house. She even asked me what I was doing, to which I said that if she had her laptop with her, it wouldn‚Äôt be a problem to finish the assignments from there.

After about three days, she returned to campus. We didn‚Äôt talk much for a day or two after that. Then I began to notice something like she would message me about things she could easily find out from anyone else. Like, sometimes the professor had already mentioned in class which books to follow, yet she‚Äôd still ask me which book she should use for a particular topic, or some other small details she could‚Äôve confirmed with anyone.

Still, I always replied ...even if briefly. And I started noticing that the number of messages we exchanged was quite uneven. For every one short message I sent, she would send around five. If I look at it roughly, the total message ratio between us must be around 11 : 6 (Hers: Mine)...believe me.. most of it was about studies....except those first 15 days.

The next day, she asked me to go for a walk again, saying she needed to understand something about two subjects for the final exam and how to prepare for them. Believe me, I‚Äôm not a topper but my grades are not bad ....I‚Äôm just confident in my specialized areas ....but I don‚Äôt understand why she always comes to me for help. Anyway, I said okay, and that night we went for another walk. We discussed her doubts for a while, and then she said, ‚ÄòYou didn‚Äôt come to class today ... I knew you wouldn‚Äôt. I was thinking, this guy definitely won‚Äôt come today either.‚Äô She told me again to wear jackets or I‚Äôd catch a cold. She also knew I was interested in pursuing a PhD after two years or so, and that night she mentioned she was also thinking about doing a PhD. That surprised me a little, because one or two months ago when I‚Äôd asked, she had said she wasn‚Äôt really interested in a PhD. Still, I didn‚Äôt think too much of it. Also, that day she acted in a very childish way ‚Äî just like she used to during those first fifteen days after we met.

What did surprise me was that she remembered a small detail. I had once told her about a topic that took me four days to finish ‚Äî this was many days ago ‚Äî and she remembered not just the topic but even the number ‚Äòfour‚Äô....even I forgot that number. She told me not to waste too much time studying a single topic in such depth, saying it would be a waste of time. At the end of that walk, she mentioned another girl from our batch ‚Äî for the first time ever during our conversations. That girl hardly comes to class, but she knows her. Both of them seem to know each other, though she isn‚Äôt part of that usual group. I know that girl too, as we met coincidentally on a verification day and were lab partners once or twice...lab partners are decided by prof in a random way. This girl is even more introverted than I am, and whenever she sees me, she smiles and talks briefly. But there‚Äôs absolutely nothing between us. I really don‚Äôt know why she brought her up that day ... it felt random, and I couldn‚Äôt figure out the reason.

After two days, I texted her to play TT, and this time she replied instantly. Usually, she has this kind of ‚Äú10-minute rule‚Äù ‚Äî she always replies to me after exactly 10 minutes, and I‚Äôve also gotten used to doing the same. But that day, her reply came right away. She came, we played as usual, and while leaving, she suddenly asked whether I had been playing with someone else. I was honestly very surprised ‚Äî she had never asked anything like that before. I just said, ‚ÄúNo‚Äù, because I really wasn‚Äôt playing with anyone else.

That‚Äôs all.

I never asked her anything about her past relationships ‚Äî I felt I shouldn‚Äôt, and she never asked me either. There‚Äôs never been any physical contact between us, and I‚Äôve never told her things like ‚Äúdon‚Äôt talk to him‚Äù or anything like that. Even that day when I saw her in the evening with Boy A, I didn‚Äôt react...but I noticed one thing that boy A knows something like I was working on a particular problem...which I told her only. Maybe she discusses about me with that group or with the other girls..I don‚Äôt know..nor do I care...I never told her anything very personal about me.

Most of the time, I am with my close friend ‚Äî she knows that too. My friend often tells me, after hearing everything, that if he were in my place, he would have already proposed to her by now. But I‚Äôm not sure. Maybe I am the dumb one here and one thing I forgot to mention whenever we go for a walk, she always asks me things like how she should manage her time, how to plan her studies, or how to read certain topics every time.

It‚Äôs just that, if the answer were yes, it would be great. But if it were no, I am afraid things might become awkward between us, or worse ‚Äî that it might spread among our batchmates, and I really don‚Äôt want that.

So if you are still with me‚Ä¶ what do you think? Does she actually like me, or am I just a friend to her? It‚Äôs not that I am helping her to make her my girlfriend....I would help her anyway...its just that I will stop having any romantic thoughts/feelings for her if she sees me as just a friend.

I don‚Äôt really have any female friends, so it‚Äôs hard for me to understand how girls think in situations like this. That‚Äôs why I wanted to share everything here ‚Äî to get an honest woman‚Äôs perspective on whether she actually likes me, or if I‚Äôve just been reading too much into things.",1,1761917533.0,AskIndianWomen,2,0.67,False

1okuney,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_Leather-Buddy-7902/comments/1okuney/they_told_me_pms_are_the_ceo_of_the_product_i/,They told me PMs are the 'CEO of the product.' I found out it's more like being a stressed-out translator for a bunch of geniuses.,"When I first broke into product management, everyone threw around the phrase, 'You're the CEO of the product!' I imagined myself in a sleek turtleneck, making grand pronouncements to a room of nodding engineers. My reality? It was 9 PM on a Tuesday, the air thick with the smell of stale coffee and whiteboard markers. Our lead engineer, a genius who basically speaks in pure code, was trying to explain a catastrophic bug while our marketing lead was asking if we could make the 'buy' button 'more sparkly.' My 'grand pronouncements' were mostly just begging both of them to agree on a path forward so I could update the damn roadmap.

That night, I wasn't a CEO. I was a professional cat-herder, a therapist, and a human Google Translate. My job was to translate 'cascading database failure' into 'we can't take new sign-ups for a bit, but we're fixing it,' for the customer support team. Then, I had to translate the marketing team's frantic, 'The competition just launched a killer feature!' into a coherent set of user stories that the dev team wouldn't immediately laugh out of the room. It's less about giving orders and more about building a fragile bridge of understanding between wildly different brains, all while a dozen Slack notifications are going off like tiny alarm bells.

It‚Äôs a bizarre mix of skills. One minute you‚Äôre diving deep into API documentation, feeling like a technical wizard. The next, you're trying to calm a furious stakeholder because their pet feature is being deprioritized, using every ounce of diplomatic skill you can muster. You're the one who has to absorb the pressure from all sides‚Äîsales, marketing, engineering, and especially the users‚Äîand somehow channel that chaos into a single, clear vision that everyone can get behind, even if they don't fully agree with it.

But here's the crazy part: when it works, it's magic. Seeing a feature you agonized over finally go live, watching the user numbers tick up, and hearing a developer say, 'Okay, I see why we did it that way now'‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs an incredible rush. You're not the CEO, you're the glue. You're the storyteller. And sometimes, you're just the person who orders the right pizza to keep everyone going. It's the best, most frustrating job I've ever had.

We used to have a petty cash tin and a shared company card for small parts, screws, zip ties, a tube of Loctite, random bits like that. New CFO arrives and sends a shiny policy, no purchases without a pre approved Purchase Order, every vendor must be in the system, no exceptions. Reimbursements without a PO will be rejected, in bold. Cool, I can follow rules. We cleaned the toolbox, logged every part, and I stopped grabbing stuff at Harbor Freight on my way in. 

Friday, 4,32 pm, our shrink wrapper stops. Line light is dark, panel shows no fault, I pop the cover and the 5x20mm T2A 250V fuse is visibly dead. We used to keep a bag of ten, but stores got ""consolidated"", so the bin is empty. The part costs about 0.25 at the hardware store five minutes away, or 8 bucks for a pack of ten at Home Depot. I call procurement, nobody there after 4, phone goes to voicemail. I text my manager and the CFO, include a photo, part number written with a sharpie on the inside door, very helpful past me. Manager says use your card and expense later. I send him the policy screenshot that says ""Purchases without a PO will not be reimbursed"". He says he will talk to the CFO. I clock the line as down, send the crew home, open a ticket with exact times, cause, and a lovely pic of the roasted fuse for the file. Compliance achieved.

Saturday, 6,07 am, the CFO calls me, little bit of panic in his voice. ""Just go buy the fuse, we are missing trucks."" I say sure, please send me the PO number. He says he cannot issue one until accounting logs in on Monday. I tell him, happy to help once I have a PO. We had three lines idle all weekend because the shrinker is the last step, no wrap, no pallets. We missed 42 pallets to a grocery DC, paid overtime to re run on Monday, and got a chargeback for late delivery. Someone estimates the downtime cost north of 180k, I am not a finance guy, but the number had many zeros. 

Monday, the CFO arrives with two coffees and a face the color of a ripe tomato. He hands me a small cash box with 200 dollars and a printed sheet of twenty pre approved POs for ""maintenance consumables under 100"". He says, please use judgment. I buy a 10 pack of the fuses, stock 8 in the bin, tape one to the inside of the panel with the part number, and keep one on my desk as art. I labeled it, ""Price 0.25, lesson, alot more"".

1okui2f,https://www.reddit.com/r/scarystories/comments/1okui2f/i_found_handprints_in_the_mud_behind_my_chicken/,I found handprints in the mud behind my chicken coop. They weren't human.,"The morning was still as a held breath.

Cold clung to the porch railings and silvered the grass. Mist hung low, pooling in the hollows of the yard and drifting like smoke across the street, where the trees stood black and bare, their limbs tangled like old wire.

I slung my work bag over one shoulder and locked the front door behind me. I wore a flannel overshirt and heavy boots, but the chill still found the skin at my neck. The air smelled of wet leaves and something faintly metallic.

I stepped off the porch and paused.

There, in the patch of mud beside the gravel drive, were tracks. Not boot prints. Not paws. Not anything I could name.

They were long, narrow impressions‚Äîlike the heel of a hand pressed deep into the earth, fingers splayed. But there were no matching footprints. Just those strange palm-shaped marks, staggered and dragging slightly, as if whatever made them had pulled itself forward on its hands alone.

I crouched, frowning. The soil was soft from last night‚Äôs rain, and the prints were fresh. I reached out, almost touched one, then thought better of it.

A flicker of movement caught my eye.

Across the street, just beyond the mist, something pale lay at the edge of the woods. I squinted. It looked like a chicken‚Äîlimp, wings askew, neck twisted at an unnatural angle. One of ours?

I stood slowly, heart beginning to thud.

The coop was behind the house, fenced and latched. Jules and I had built it ourselves last spring, after I got laid off. It was sturdy. Safe.

I turned on my heel and walked fast around the side of the house, boots crunching frostbitten grass. The coop door hung open. The latch dangled, unbroken.

Inside, feathers. Scattered like torn paper. And in the corner, a smear of something dark.

One hen missing. The rest huddled silent, wide-eyed.

I backed away, breath clouding in the air. I looked toward the trees again, but the mist had thickened. The shape was gone.

I stood for a long moment, staring into the mist where it had been. The trees across the street loomed quiet and still, their trunks swallowed by fog.

I closed the coop gently, checked the latch twice. The remaining hens rustled behind me, feathers puffed and silent.

Inside the house, warmth met me like a blanket. The radiator hummed. One of the cats‚ÄîMoss‚Äîwound around my ankles, purring. The others were curled in their usual places: on the windowsill, the armchair, the folded laundry. I counted them without thinking. Five. All accounted for.

I stepped softly into the bedroom. Jules lay curled on her side, one arm tucked under her cheek, hair fanned across the pillow. I leaned down and kissed her temple, lingering just a moment. She stirred but didn‚Äôt wake.

I dressed quietly, poured coffee into a thermos, and left for work.

***‚Ä¶***

The office was a converted house on the edge of town, pale green siding and a crooked porch. I worked for the county‚Äôs Parks and Trails department‚Äîmostly maintenance, sometimes signage, sometimes trail clearing. It was quiet work, and I liked it that way.

But today, I couldn‚Äôt focus.

I kept thinking about the prints. The way they dragged. The way they looked like hands.

And the chicken. That pale shape in the mist. It had been there. I was sure of it. But when I looked again, it was gone.

Around ten, my phone buzzed.

**Jules**:  
Did you say one of the chickens was *missing*?

I stared at the screen, thumb hovering.

**Me**:  
Yeah. Coop door was open. One gone.  
Weird tracks in the mud. Like handprints.  
Thought I saw a dead one across the street.  
It disappeared.

Three dots blinked. Then stopped.

**Jules**:  
That‚Äôs‚Ä¶ weird.

**Me**:  
I know.

I looked out the office window. Mist still clung to the trees behind the building. The same kind of trees. The same kind of quiet.

Ray walked in and dropped a clipboard on the desk. ‚ÄúYou good?‚Äù he asked.

I nodded. ‚ÄúJust tired.‚Äù

But my eyes kept drifting to the woods.

‚Ä¶

By noon, the mist had burned off, but the cold lingered. I was in the garage, strapping my pack to the back of the ATV when Ray came in, rubbing his hands together like he could will warmth into them.

‚ÄúTrail 9‚Äôs yours today,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúStorm last week knocked some limbs down, and we‚Äôve had a couple hikers complain. Nothing major, just messy.‚Äù

I nodded, tightening the last strap.

Ray hesitated. ‚ÄúAlso‚Ä¶ someone reported an abandoned campsite out past the ridge. Way off trail. Said it looked weird. Like someone left in a hurry.‚Äù

I raised an eyebrow. ‚ÄúYou want me to check it out?‚Äù

‚ÄúYeah. Just make sure no one‚Äôs hurt or squatting out there. Shouldn‚Äôt take long. You‚Äôll be back before dark.‚Äù

I didn‚Äôt say anything, just waited.

He scratched his beard. ‚ÄúI know it‚Äôs a stretch, but with all the missing pets this year‚Ä¶ I don‚Äôt know. Feels off. Cats, dogs, even a goat from that farm on 42. Just gone.‚Äù

I frowned. ‚ÄúYou think it‚Äôs connected?‚Äù

‚ÄúI think I don‚Äôt like coincidences,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúAnd we‚Äôre short-staffed. You‚Äôre the only one I trust to handle it solo.‚Äù

I gave a short nod, swung my leg over the ATV, and started the engine.

‚Ä¶

The trail was easy. A few downed branches, some erosion near the switchback, but nothing I couldn‚Äôt clear with a handsaw and a little muscle. The woods were quiet‚Äîtoo quiet. No birdsong. No wind. Just the hum of the engine and the crunch of tires over frost-hardened dirt.

I found the campsite just past the ridge, tucked in a hollow near a dry creek bed.

At first glance, it looked like someone had left in a hurry. A tent collapsed on one side. A camp chair overturned. A cooler cracked open, contents spilled and half-frozen.

Then I saw the tracks.

Same as the ones by my driveway that morning‚Äîlong, narrow handprints, fingers splayed, dragging through the mud. They were everywhere. Around the firepit. Across the flattened tent. Leading into the woods and back again, like something had circled the site over and over.

It didn‚Äôt look abandoned. It looked destroyed.

My stomach turned. Every instinct screamed that I shouldn‚Äôt be here. Not alone.

My hand went to my hip, to the spot where I used to carry a sidearm. But that had been a point of contention‚Äîtoo aggressive, Ray had said. Too much, for someone with my ‚Äúpresence.‚Äù Now all I had was the hunting knife strapped to my thigh.

I sighed, low and bitter, and backed away from the site.

The sun was already starting to dip behind the trees. Shadows stretched long across the forest floor. I climbed back onto the ATV and turned it toward the trailhead.

‚Ä¶

The ride back was slower. The air felt heavier. The woods too still.

Then I heard it‚Äîfaint, far off. A sound like footsteps, but wrong. Not boots. Not hooves. Something uneven. Wet. Like hands slapping the ground.

I stopped the ATV and listened.

Nothing.

I started moving again, faster now, eyes flicking to the trees.

Then came the cry.

It echoed through the forest‚Äîlong, low, and mournful. Not human. Not animal. Something in between. It made my skin crawl.

The ATV sputtered.

I cursed, tapped the throttle. The engine coughed, then died.

‚ÄúWell fuck,‚Äù I muttered, climbing off.

The forest was silent again. Too silent.

I slung my pack over my shoulder, tightened my grip on the knife, and started walking.

The woods were darker now. The sun had slipped behind the hills, and the trees stood like sentinels, black against the bruised sky.

I walked fast, boots crunching frostbitten leaves. My breath came in short bursts, fogging the air. The knife in my hand felt small. Insufficient.

Behind me, the sounds continued.

Not footsteps. Not exactly.

A wet, slapping rhythm. Uneven. Like something dragging itself forward. Like hands.

I didn‚Äôt look back.

I knew better.

The trail curved, and I saw the faint glow of the office porch light through the trees. Relief surged‚Äîbut it was thin, brittle.

The sounds grew louder.

I stopped.

The forest was silent again. No wind. No birds. Just the thud of my heart.

Then the cry came.

A long, low wail‚Äîmournful and wrong. It echoed through the trees, vibrating in my chest.

The hairs on my neck rose.

I turned.

Just for a second.

In the dark, between the trunks, I saw it.

A pale figure‚Äîwhite, torn, hunched low to the ground. It moved in a way that defied sense, limbs bent wrong, head lolling. It didn‚Äôt walk. It didn‚Äôt crawl. It propelled itself, jerking forward like a puppet with tangled strings.

I gasped and ran.

I sprinted the last stretch, knife clutched tight, lungs burning. I burst through the office door and slammed it shut, locking it.

Ray stood from his desk, startled. ‚ÄúJesus, Hollis‚Äîwhat happened?‚Äù

I leaned against the wall, panting.

‚ÄúThere‚Äôs something out there,‚Äù I said.

Ray stared at me. ‚ÄúWhat kind of something?‚Äù

I shook my head. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know. But I‚Äôm bringing my sidearm from now on.‚Äù

Ray nodded slowly.

We didn‚Äôt speak much after that. Just packed up in silence, checked the windows, and stepped out into the cold together. I scanned the tree line as we walked to our trucks.

The woods watched back.

‚Ä¶

By the time I pulled into the driveway, the sky was ink-black and the mist had returned, curling low around the porch steps. The house lights glowed warm through the windows. I sat in the truck for a moment, gripping the wheel, before finally stepping out.

Inside, the smell of mushrooms and thyme wrapped around me like a blanket. Jules stood at the stove, ladling soup into two bowls. Her beautiful pink hair was pulled into a loose bun, wisps curling around her face in the steam. She turned when I came in, her eyes narrowing.

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre late,‚Äù she said gently. ‚ÄúAnd you look like hell.‚Äù

I dropped my bag by the door and kicked off my boots. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm fine.‚Äù

She raised an eyebrow.

We sat at the kitchen table, the cats weaving between our legs. I wrapped my hands around the warm bowl, but didn‚Äôt eat.

Jules waited.

Finally, I spoke. ‚ÄúI saw something. Out past Trail 9. A wrecked campsite. Same tracks I saw this morning‚Äîlike handprints, dragging through the mud. And then‚Ä¶ something followed me back. I heard it. I saw it.‚Äù

She didn‚Äôt interrupt. Just listened, her spoon paused halfway to her mouth.

‚ÄúIt was pale,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúTorn up. Moving wrong. Like it didn‚Äôt have legs. Like it was pulling itself.‚Äù

The silence stretched.

Jules set her spoon down and leaned back in her chair, eyes distant. ‚ÄúYou said it moved on its hands?‚Äù

I nodded.

She stood abruptly and left the room. I heard the soft clack of keys from the office down the hall, the creak of the old desk chair. I stayed at the table, staring into my soup, the warmth of the house suddenly feeling fragile.

When Jules returned, she was holding a thin folder and a printout. Her face was pale.

‚ÄúI think I know what you saw,‚Äù she said.

I looked up.

‚ÄúThere‚Äôs an old story,‚Äù Jules began, sitting down again. ‚ÄúNot something people talk about anymore. Not in town. Not even in the library archives unless you know where to look.‚Äù

She slid the paper across the table.

‚ÄúHer name was Maribeth \[redacted\]. Lived up in the hills, near where Trail 9 runs now. She was a healer, a midwife, and by all accounts, a good woman. Helped folks who couldn‚Äôt afford doctors. Took in strays. Kept to herself.‚Äù

Jules hesitated.

‚ÄúThen there was an accident. No one knows exactly what happened. Some say she was attacked. Others say she fell into a ravine. But she was broken after that. Couldn‚Äôt walk upright. Moved on her hands, dragging her body behind her.‚Äù

My stomach twisted.

‚ÄúThey say the town turned on her,‚Äù Jules continued. ‚ÄúCalled her cursed. Said she brought sickness. Said she was unnatural. She lived the rest of her life alone in the woods. Died out there, too. Some say she never left.‚Äù

She looked at me carefully.

‚ÄúThere‚Äôs more. People say her ghost doesn‚Äôt just haunt the woods. It‚Ä¶ attaches. To people. Picks someone. Follows them. Watches. And once it‚Äôs chosen you, it doesn‚Äôt stop.‚Äù

I stared at the paper. A grainy photo of a woman with tired eyes and a crooked smile. The caption read: *Maribeth \[redacted\], 1932.*

‚ÄúNo one says her name anymore,‚Äù Jules said softly. ‚ÄúNot around here. Folks are too superstitious. They just call her ‚Äòthe thing in the trees.‚Äô‚Äù

I looked at her. ‚ÄúYou believe this?‚Äù

She didn‚Äôt answer right away. Then: ‚ÄúI believe you saw something. And I believe this place remembers pain.‚Äù

Outside, the wind picked up. The porch creaked.

I reached for Jules‚Äôs hand.

‚Ä¶

The next morning, Jules was quiet. She made coffee, fed the cats, and sat at the table with her laptop open. I watched her from the doorway.

‚ÄúYou okay?‚Äù I asked.

She didn‚Äôt look up. ‚ÄúI found something else.‚Äù

I stepped closer.

‚ÄúThere‚Äôs a pattern,‚Äù Jules said. ‚ÄúEvery few decades. Someone sees it. Feels it. Starts hearing things. Then they disappear.‚Äù

My throat tightened. ‚ÄúDisappear how?‚Äù

‚ÄúNo one knows. They just‚Ä¶ vanish. Sometimes their animals go first. Sometimes their partners. But it always starts with the tracks.‚Äù

She turned the laptop toward me. A scanned newspaper clipping. *Local Woman Missing After Strange Reports in Woods.*

The photo was grainy. But I recognized the woman‚Äôs eyes. Wide. Haunted.

‚ÄúShe said it followed her,‚Äù Jules whispered. ‚ÄúSaid she felt it watching. Said she dreamed about it.‚Äù

I stepped back.

‚ÄúI think it‚Äôs chosen you,‚Äù Jules said.

‚Ä¶

That night, the house felt wrong.

The radiator hissed too loud. The cats wouldn‚Äôt settle. One by one, they slunk into the bedroom, ears flat, tails puffed. I sat on the edge of the bed, lacing my boots.

I‚Äôd already pulled the water gun from the hall closet‚Äîbright green plastic, filled with holy water from a dusty bottle labeled *St. Jude‚Äôs, 2009*. A relic from my ghost-hunting days, back when I thought hauntings were stories and salt was just seasoning.

Jules stood in the doorway, pale and silent, holding a flashlight in one hand and a box of rock salt in the other.

We didn‚Äôt speak.

Then the porch creaked.

The cats hissed in unison, backing into corners, fur bristling.

A low scraping sound moved along the siding. Then the unmistakable sound of something climbing‚Äîslow, deliberate, unnatural.

I stepped into the hallway just as the living room window slid open with a soft click.

It came through.

Twisted. Pale. Its skin hung in tatters, like wet paper clinging to bone. Its arms were too long, elbows bent backward, fingers splayed like broken twigs. It moved on its hands, dragging the rest of its body behind, spine arching and collapsing with each lurch.¬† Its face was a ruin‚Äîhalf collapsed, half grinning. One eye socket empty. The other wide and gleaming.

It turned toward Jules.

She froze, flashlight trembling in her grip.

The creature crept closer, its breath rattling like wind through dead leaves.

The cats shrieked and scattered.

‚ÄúHey,‚Äù I said.

The thing stopped.

Its head twisted toward me, neck cracking. That grin widened, impossibly.

‚ÄúI know you‚Äôre here for me,‚Äù I said, voice steady. ‚ÄúYou picked me.‚Äù

It stared.

‚ÄúI know what they did to you,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúI know what it‚Äôs like to be twisted by other people‚Äôs fear. To be hated for how you move through the world.‚Äù

The leer faltered.

‚ÄúBut I‚Äôm not afraid of you,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúAnd you don‚Äôt get to have me.‚Äù

I nodded once.

Jules raised the water gun and fired.

The stream hit the creature square in the chest. It screamed‚Äîa sound like metal tearing, like wind howling through a broken throat. Its body convulsed, limbs flailing, skin blistering where the water touched.

It scrambled backward, shrieking, and hurled itself through the open window, vanishing into the night with a final, echoing wail.

Silence fell.

The cats crept back in, wide-eyed but unharmed.

Jules and I stood in the center of the room, breathing hard.

Then she said, ‚ÄúSalt?‚Äù

‚ÄúSalt,‚Äù I confirmed.

We worked in silence, pouring a ring around the house, every window, every door. The night air was sharp, but the stars were clear.

When we finished, we stood on the porch, side by side.

Jules looked at me. ‚ÄúYou okay?‚Äù

I nodded. ‚ÄúShe picked the wrong bitch.‚Äù

She smiled, tired and fierce. ‚ÄúDamn right she did.‚Äù

And behind us, the house breathed easy again.",4,1761917038.0,scarystories,2,1.0,False

Hi there thanks for reading my post this is a very long post please read it in full before messaging me. 

I am an English guy 

So firstly I‚Äôm not conservative and I‚Äôm not from the USA anyway and I am not religious the way I am is my own personal choice and how I have wanted to live my Life. I‚Äôm not intending to offend anyone at all I would ask those to be respectful towards me don‚Äôt report this post if you don‚Äôt like it im a very decent man I know what I want in life and I want to find a decent woman! If I don‚Äôt appeal to you please just move on! 

Any women from the USA or Canada please message me I want to hear from you I love your accents! 

I am posting many times because I really am very serious about finding someone! I have been on my own way too long now I do not mind where you are located 

This is a genuine post from a genuine user I really want to find someone please be aged between 25 and 35 thanks and please don't be shy to send me a message 

I am an English guy and I am currently living in France I have been here a few years now I absolutely love it but I‚Äôm now wanting to find someone to share my life with. I am very family orientated and family is extremely important to me 

I am seeking a serious relationship I know what I want in life. I have no baggage I‚Äôve never been married before and no previous relationships in fact I‚Äôve never really dated and I‚Äôve never been on dating apps. 

I just haven't found a woman that is suitable enough for me yet to want to be in a relationship with 

I‚Äôd like to find a woman with similar morals and values and boundaries. I really want to be with someone that really appreciates the way I am I am seeking a nice woman with nice standards like mine. 

You‚Äôll find out a lot about me on this post. And please have maturity and decency.

I‚Äôm generally quite a shy guy face to face so this has made it hard meeting others especially women. I am not one of the lads and I also don‚Äôt have many friends I prefer quality over quantity when it comes to friends. I am a very polite patient guy. 

I also don‚Äôt like swearing I rarely use vulgar language on online chats or face to face¬† I am not that type of guy. I also don‚Äôt like those that think it‚Äôs okay to criticise others this is especially true with being friends. I am probably a bit posh and I would describe myself as being upper middle class.¬† 

I am not one that is into partying I don‚Äôt like loud noisy environments I prefer quieter things. I am not one of the lads I have very few male friends. I‚Äôm not into bars or nightclubs they really are not my thing. I really like going¬† to nice restaurants museums a nice beach walking through a park 

I really want to have my own family one day so please be someone that is open to having children in the future I really do want to be a father in the future. I believe I‚Äôm very fertile 

I have been totally celibate by choice all my life I only want to be with one woman and share my body with one woman. It has never appealed to me to be with different women and I could never do anything meaningless This has also never appealed to me. I‚Äôve never been tempted by anyone and I‚Äôd never just sleep with someone for the sake of it. I don‚Äôt view women as one thing and I never will 

I need a strong emotional connection with someone plus I‚Äôd have to get to know someone really well ideally friends first 

It really does not appeal to me to even date different women I‚Äôve never been on loads of dates I‚Äôm not interested in meeting different women I just want to be with one that‚Äôs it just one. 

I do not watch online adult content I don‚Äôt want to use the actual word for it and I don‚Äôt smoke I don‚Äôt drink heavily and I‚Äôve never touched any illegal drugs. I‚Äôve got no bad addictions or bad habits I‚Äôve lived a very clean life. 

I‚Äôm not seeking adult chats on Reddit so if you are looking for this please move on I am not that type of guy.

I take good care of myself I regularly go to the gym and workout often doing intense cardio workouts I‚Äôm in very good health. I am a very strong swimmer I‚Äôve always loved swimming doing lengths my favourite stroke is freestyle this is also my strongest I‚Äôd love to have someone that loves swimming and keeping active as much as I do. I also love going on long walks I do a lot of brisk walking¬† often around the coastline here 

I do love my food and I have been raised on home cooked food I love cooking I‚Äôm not bad at it and I‚Äôd again love to be with someone that also loves her food as much as I do. 

I love eating in nice restaurants too I‚Äôve always been very passionate about this! I also love avocados they are so good for you 

I place a very high value on being intimate with someone it‚Äôs not something I just want to do with just anyone and I don‚Äôt just want to settle I‚Äôve never just wanted to settle I‚Äôm seeking the love of my life someone really special someone I really want to be with. You would be the only woman I would want to come home to at the end of the day. I‚Äôd never have an affair or a fling and I‚Äôm not into ever having an open relationship. I could never cheat on someone I loved and cared about 

I am also someone that sound be very loving supportive kind sweet and caring to you. I will also be very physically affectionate kissing cuddling. 

Where I am in France is very close to the sea it‚Äôs an absolutely beautiful place to live France is a Beautiful country. The coastline in this area is beautiful there are some lovely beaches I‚Äôve been to and we have the lovely √Æle de re island nearby I have been there many times it‚Äôs also beautiful. 

France is a very peaceful relaxing calm country it‚Äôs certainly more peaceful than England. England was too much pressure for me way too stressful too I always wanted to go somewhere else from a very early age. France has amazing food a fantastic healthcare system nice weather in the summer and the winters are not that cold certainly not as cold as England was 

I also love yoga and Pilates both of these I find extremely relaxing they are so good for the body it‚Äôs amazing how good it makes you feel after 

I also love photography taking photos is another passion of mine I can easily go out all day and come back with loads of photos to share. I love technology too especially Apple I‚Äôm very passionate about it. I have a lot of technology that I use and I do have an iPhone 

I also love music I listen to a lot of classical music during the day at home and I am usually listening to classic FM UK which is classical music 24/7 for those that don‚Äôt know. I also love soft rock some of the bands¬† love are a-ha Keane Queen dire straits I listen to a lot of 70s and 80s music. I‚Äôve seen most of my favourite bands live too I‚Äôve been very lucky with that. 

I also love animals I have a dog she‚Äôs a two year old retriever these are the best dogs for me she‚Äôs absolutely lovely. I love being with nature too I love taking walks through forests and the countryside I find this very peaceful and relaxing thing to do. I love spending a while day doing this and going for some nice food after 

When it comes to drinks I love red wine it‚Äôs my favourite but I only have it in moderation I‚Äôve had some lovely bottles of red wine here in France and some of it is also organic. They make a lot of organic food here in France I organic where ever possible as often as possible. 

I keep junk and fast foods to a minimum and have these as a treat I don‚Äôt drink tea and coffee that much I avoid caffeine and I don‚Äôt drink sugary drinks that often either. I am not vegan or vegetarian and I can‚Äôt ever see myself going either way.¬† 

It‚Äôs very important to keep hydrated and I only drink mineral water at least 3L per day and will have more if I go to the gym and have a good workout I always make sure I get myself really sweaty when working out I feel so good after.

I have to be honest and tell you that I don‚Äôt drive I have never passed my test having a car is way too expensive and i have never been that interested in driving. 

I also still live at home with my parents at the moment I‚Äôm not someone that likes living by myself plus the current cost of living especially in England made living by myself too expensive. 

I will also tell you that I am taking a break from work I am in a new country learning the language is my focus at the moment.
I‚Äôm not lazy or anything like that and I cannot cope with stress and pressure in jobs this is again why I‚Äôve had trouble finding suitable work which was hard In England 

So onto to my physical appearance well I am 6ft 4 1.94m very tall and I have a rugby player build you would never lose me in a crowd! I have dark blonde hair and hazel eyes I have freckles on my arms and legs. I have very big hands and feet I am a uk size 13 shoe. 

I have a very natural body type with some stretch Marks in some places like I say I love being natural and my body is very natural. 

My body Is not lean muscular athletic I am natural I have a real man's body which has some fat on it. 

We have very strong genes in my family and we all look younger I don't look My age most say I look like I'm in my late 20s to early 30s. I have no grey hair and I'm not losing any of my hair. I have a full head of nice hair 

I‚Äôm not into being ripped and toned having a six pack has never appealed to me. If your seeking men that are a muscular physique then I won‚Äôt be for you please move on. 

I have a very deep manly voice which can be loud sometimes. I like to voice chat too rather than messaging so if you are comfortable with this I would prefer it. 

I have a naturally smooth chest arms and legs. I don‚Äôt fit in most baths and I have to sleep in a double bed. I love the fact that I‚Äôm very tall but it does have its cons I often get asked when I‚Äôm in shops to reach things on the top shelf! Plus I walk around the house bare foot and I‚Äôm always bashing my feet on things hehe 

I am not addicted to social media and I don‚Äôt aspire to look like men on it or those in mainstream films and reality tv shows. Id like to be with someone that is not obsessed with social media and you don‚Äôt watch reality tv.

I have no tattoos no piercings and looking and keeping yourself natural is the best way to go I am a very natural looking man and body to go with it. this is what I believe and it‚Äôs how I‚Äôve been raised too. I have no interest in ever having tattoos or piercings of any kind. I‚Äôd never have any cosmetic surgery 

I like natural looking women that have natural bodies and that don‚Äôt wear heavy makeup also no fake tan or fake nails or fake eyelashes and hair. I also like women that dress modestly not showing too much off with revealing clothing. I‚Äôd prefer someone with no tattoos and not too many piercings please. Also you don‚Äôt wear a bikini on the beach that is too skimpy. 

I dont have any physical looks requirements other than I like natural looking women 

So if you like what you have read then please send me a message and mention red wine in your message! Please can you tell me what you love about being a woman in your message and your age and location and more about you please don‚Äôt just say hi or hello I‚Äôm unlikely to respond to messages with low effort!

1okugde,https://www.reddit.com/r/Crushes/comments/1okugde/coworker_crush/,Coworker crush,"I (24M) have had a crush on my coworker (23F) for some time. 

I asked her if she wanted to get coffee in March and she said yea but added ‚Äúwe can even ask our other coworkers if they want to come!‚Äù So I took that as her not really having interest. I just moved on after that.

Fast forward to recently where she always comes to my room when I‚Äôm working to hang out and talk. I thought nothing of it and enjoyed her company. Then one time, she tells me about her ‚Äúex‚Äù (they never really made it official) who we both work with and she was thinking of having a talk with him since they ended on bad terms and she had started thinking about clearing the air. She said she wasn‚Äôt trying to get together with him and was just wondering if she should squash the beef.

We talked through the pros and cons, and I told her there is no good or bad choice in this situation and whether she wants to have a talk with him or not, I‚Äôd support her decision. She told me that after talking with me, she thinks it was a bad idea and she wouldn‚Äôt do it and I told her that‚Äôs a fine decision to make as well. After that, she brought up how she saw I was acting again and asked me when the dates for my shows were so she could come.

We had an activity at work where we‚Äôd compliment the person to our left. Earlier in the meeting she asked who was sitting next to me and I said no one so she moved from her spot to come sit next to me, so I was to the left of her. She told me I smelled really good and it made me feel a certain way but I thought nothing of it since it was for the activity. 

Then another time, I was asking about why she switched team meetings and she told me about how she‚Äôd forget she had work with her previous meeting time. But what caught my attention was when she said ‚ÄúPlus now I get to sit next to you‚Äù and it flustered me a bit. I just laughed awkwardly and smiled at her. It made me start thinking about her more again, but I can‚Äôt tell if she was flirting or just being nice. I don‚Äôt really want to risk asking her out again since I think I already did that with the coffee thing, but then again, it‚Äôs just something that‚Äôs been on my mind.

It‚Äôs just to help you get to know me before you message.

I‚Äôm Max and as the title states, I‚Äôm looking for a ride or die. Maybe that‚Äôs just through being friends, maybe that‚Äôs through something deeper? I‚Äôm open to that and everything between.
I‚Äôm posting as my social circle has shrunk quite a lot recently. I‚Äôve recently returned from a gap year working as a volunteer teacher in China and I‚Äôve lost contact with a lot of folk so I‚Äôm trying to build my connections up again.

I‚Äôm a pretty 50/50 split between being an introvert and an extrovert. I love getting cosy, curling up with a good cup of coffee, some movies or a book or even just staring out my window, headphones on, and watch the world go by. On the other hand, I yearn for the outdoors. If I‚Äôm not roaming the hills and forests with my camera, I‚Äôm almost certainly running or cycling miles along the roads, and I‚Äôve got some beautiful scenery to do it in. I run both for leisure and competitively and I‚Äôm just beginning a training block for an upcoming challenge next year.
I‚Äôm also into creative writing and poetry if there‚Äôs anyone else who‚Äôs interested in that!

If looks matter to you, I‚Äôm 6‚Äô0, pretty lanky but still fit, dark brown hair that‚Äôs in some kind of a messy fringe and blue eyes (that are apparently miley cyrus blue, whatever that means?)

I don‚Äôt ask for a lot in people, but honesty goes a long way. Otherwise just be yourself, however bubbly or serious that may be. If you think we‚Äôll click, don‚Äôt sit on the other side of the screen and wonder what could be - find out and tell me a bit about yourself!

I‚Äôm posting as my social circle has shrunk quite a lot recently. I‚Äôve recently returned from a gap year working as a volunteer teacher in China and I‚Äôve lost contact with a lot of folk so I‚Äôm trying to build my connections up again.

I‚Äôm a pretty 50/50 split between being an introvert and an extrovert. I love getting cosy, curling up with a good cup of coffee, some movies or a book or even just staring out my window, headphones on, and watch the world go by. On the other hand, I yearn for the outdoors. If I‚Äôm not roaming the hills and forests with my camera, I‚Äôm almost certainly running or cycling miles along the roads, and I‚Äôve got some beautiful scenery to do it in. I run both for leisure and competitively and I‚Äôm just beginning a training block for an upcoming challenge next year.
I‚Äôm also into creative writing and poetry if there‚Äôs anyone else who‚Äôs interested in that!

If looks matter to you, I‚Äôm 6‚Äô0, pretty lanky but still fit, dark brown hair that‚Äôs in some kind of a messy fringe and blue eyes (that are apparently miley cyrus blue, whatever that means?)

1okuema,https://www.reddit.com/r/FNSCAR/comments/1okuema/purpose_of_life_by_nityanande/,purpose of life - by Nityanande,"Practical Explanation ( For Example ) :- \`1st of all can you tell me every single seconds detail from that time when you born ?? ( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Here is no Question of Holy Books quotes, Personal Experiences, Faith or Belief. i accept that Sometimes Faith is also Blind. Here is already Practical explanation which already proved that every\`1 else in this world is nothing more then Busy Foolish and totally idiot.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Source(s):

every \`1 is already Blind in this world and if you will follow another Blind then you both will fall in hole. so try to follow that person who have Spiritual Eyes who can Guide you on Actual Right Path. ( my Authority & Guide is my Spiritual Master "" Srila Prabhupada "" )

I'm 25[M] and she's 23[F]. We've met sa isang live sa tiktok since that content creator is working for the company will be applying last Sept first week. Parang dump yung tiktok nya, pero nung nalaman ko name nya, like hell, she's so beauty and brains coded. From green school. Halatang nagskin care din. Very out of my league. Though I'm not that ugly, it's just that, mas mayaman siya, artistahin itsura. After seeing her, nagstart ako to get physically active. Actually, smooth naman talk namin, about work, course, board exam, and life, casual lang though obviously, I'm showing my interest on her. She haven't totally opened up deep dive about her life but I already know she is single and grew up without a father kasi she's sending out details rin naman. Based on her personality, very strong ng pagkababae nya and very private as in. We haven't met since from province sya and I'm from Cavite. Nauna ako magstart sa work and siya ay magstart palang sa Monday. We already had an agreement na we'll have a coffee and eat out sa birthday nya (my treat). Pero kinda pressure kasi she wants to go on an upscale restaurant or steak. Plus, bolzico beef ang fave niya. I haven't eaten steak in my entire life.

 So lately, this week. I don't know if I'm just overthinking or something felt off lately. She had a music note sa IG ever since I followed her (Ours by TS). Then medyo cold usap, like limited lang sa work na talaga. Tapos move in nya kasi kahapon sa condo sharing nya, so kapag nagmemessage ako, siniseen lang then after 2hrs pa reply. Pero kanina, sineen lang talaga, off ba yung last message na kung siya lang ba mag-isa nag-move in? Dunno if ichchat ko pa talaga. 

It's not my first time dating or having a relationship pero I had a trauma with a girl who had a daddy issue and kinda pressure sa lifestyle niya.",1,1761916534.0,AskPinoyMen,0,1.0,False

1okua4x,https://i.redd.it/q9jjdeu96gyf1.jpeg,Festival of Flowers Day 20:  Gardenia,"Gardenia (Gardenia jasminoides)


A cousin of the coffee plant, gardenia has perhaps the darkest scent profile of all white florals. Called gandharaj in Hindi and Bangla, this flower has a creamy, spicy, slightly sweet fragrance with a strong undertone of moist earth, tree roots, and mushroom. It is the witchiest of floral fragrances and I cannot think of a more fitting choice for Halloween. 


It is difficult to find a modern perfume that captures the scent of gardenia realistically. Real gardenia extract is too expensive to be used for commercial purposes, so most perfumers use synthetic substitutes, and not all of these substitutes come close to an exact match for the flower. The perfume I have chosen is one of the few in which the true beauty of gardenia shines beautifully. 


SOTE: Shinanay from Nishane 


Notes that I can perceive: gardenia , tuberose, mushroom, galbalum, sandalwood, balsamwood, oakmoss, civet 


Shinanay is a white floral perfume, and the white florals are truly resplendent in it, especially 
 gardenia. But it also has green, woody, mossy, and slightly animalic aspects, which truly give it the perfect aura of a forest witch. Picture a hut in the middle of an old-growth forest, the floor is earthen, the walls are old wood covered in moss, there are mushrooms growing from every crack, there‚Äôs a wood fire with a boiling cauldron in top, and there are black cats chilling on every surface. You are the crone of the forest, and your aura is Shinanay. 


Despite the presence of the civet note in the perfume, I would not call it dirty or overly animalic. Rather the civettone adds depth and resinousness to the other notes. Shinanay is a rare combination of light and deep‚Äî sparkling galbanum and gardenia on an earthy, woody, rooty, mushroomy bed. It is a meditative and introverted perfume, I prefer to wear it when alone, especially on gloomy rainy evenings. 


Although I called it introverted, Shinanay is neither quiet nor mild, it projects powerfully for over eight hours and lasts on fabric for days.
The name comes from an archaic expression of joy in Turkish.

1oku254,https://www.reddit.com/r/hiddengeneticdiseases/comments/1oku254/anybody_else_have_genetic_diseases_they_never/,Anybody else have genetic diseases they never knew they had till too late?,"I just read an article about chronic disease or illness fakers.  I am thoroughly disgusted that even more people are more ignorant than I thought possible beyond my immediate family.

Right before the age of 40 I passed out waiting for a table at a nice restaurant, slowly drinking a beer. Luckily I had not been a heavy, medium, or even light drinker for almost 10 years.  All I really had physically wrong with me at that time was testosterone therapy, come shoulder surgeries, and chronic,sometimes horrible pain. Oh, I was also told I had a great, really great bronze California tan.

After that incident right before age 40 I had every test I could have done to explain what happened.  Witnesses said, im 6'3 195+ lbs, I just turned white, became instantly soaking  wet, and fell straight backwards like a 2x4.

After all the tests were completed I discovered my Iron(its really called ferratin) was at a level of 3,900 (normal safe levels are 50 to 200 roughly.  I was given a genetic test for hemachromatosis,  which is pretty common, and not a super big deal when treated early.  In fact, anyone with hemachromatosis cam firmly state that we people,all people, black, while, whatever are related.  Black people have a genetic disease called sickle cell disease.  If not treated and allowed to run rampart sickle cell turns into hemachromatosis. Nuff said.

The main treatment for hemachromatosis is bloodletting, the amount of blood you need to get out of your body and how much at a time and how often is usually dictated by the level of your ferritin in your blood at time of diagnosis.  Most people, fortunately,  get detected and treated by 700 to 1500 level of Ferratin.  The body is basically killing itself, ""rusting away"" to say at levels if 1,000 plus of ferritin.

Now five leads later, testosterone implants every 3 months or so, bloodletting (phlebotomy) treatment 4 times a year now ( I started giving over 550 grams of blood 2 times a week for 4 months, and then once a week 4 or 5 months, and so on and on.  I have had a pretty extensive cervical neck surgery, cages, holes drilled in arthritic areas and nerve openings opened up, both hips totally replaced, a knee replacement on left knee coming up soon, always a pain in my ass,, literally,, lol.  There's other things, I have to get liver biopsies every year, heart tests performed every year, no alcohol, low Vtamin C diet, no more liver and onions, and reduced use of cast iron and other high iron cooking and eating utensils.

Thing is,, if you see me just see me, you'll see a big, strong, agile, balanced man.  But what you dont see is how hard it is for me to just get up and drink a cup of coffee some mornings, or how bad both legs ache, hurt, throb, and sometimes especially feel totally exhausted 2 hours after I wake up.  Or a serious neck, nerve issue that I just keep massaging and turning my head.

I don't take opiates, except after surgeries, I can't take much Tylenol or ibuprofen and related.  Mostly ice pack/machine, heat pads, hot hot bath soaks, stretching (carefully), keeping moving, and pushing myself everyday or at least 6 days a week harder than the day before.

I have half siblings, 17+ years older than me, with bone spurs, maybe knee replacement, obesity related issues, lack of movement/ exercise issues, and on and on.

I'd happily trade places with them, but keep my age, and very few people I imagine get what I'm about to say next . I decided after the first 6 months of diagnosis I was going to ""break and fall apart before I rusted and rotted away"".

Do you get that?  Understand ?  I am happy, no I get exited and thrilled inside when I see people with obvious issues, obesity, laziness, bad diet, drinking, etc struggle, not do, or unwilling to do things they should do, much less want to do to make this life more,, make this life better for themselves.  I say F' u all those ignorant dumb lazy scared people that say things, think things, act differently when they interact with you, not knowing you closely and really knowing you, when they see this person that looks, moves, and does lots of physical things better than they can,, and they think your faking or putting on or playing poor pity party me,,, no screw you guys,, try, literally walking 10,000 or more steps in my shoes each day and more, yet sometimes not able to even crawl or move for 2 or 3 hours after 4 or 5 or less some days just living life.

Anyone else have similar stories ? Or experiences?  I still can't get over the fact that had a been a normal,, or whatever you call a person who drinks a six pack a week, alcoholic drinker I would definitely for sure have had cirrhosis or liver cancer by now for sure and probably  be dead.  Anyway,, let me know thanks.

I sit down ""for five minutes"" to check email and suddenly it's 3pm, Slack pings have multiplied, and I'm carrying this low-grade guilt that I should be doing more. I've seen a bunch of threads here where people say WFH turns into scrolling + anxiety loops, and that hit a nerve. I'm basically living that loop.

I'm currently looking for a new job. I picked one tiny anchor: a 10-minute interview rep right after I make coffee. I treat it like brushing my teeth. I hit record, answer one behavioral question, and stop. Some mornings I run it through chatgpt or interview assistant like Beyz so I'm forced to hear my filler words and the places I dodge the ""so what."" This micro-rep makes the rest of my work feel less impossible, because I no longer strive for a perfect and comprehensive preparation process, and the job hunting is like just another everyday occurrence. It also lines up with what people here keep repeating: make the goal small, track it, and keep yourself accountable daily. 

A few other tweaks helped: I set a dumb ""office open"" ritual (move the laptop to the same spot, noise off, timer on), and I say out loud what the next 25 minutes are for. When I forget and try to ""plan at 4pm,"" I end up avoiding everything.

I still have a difficult time with that, as I'm 38 and only now diagnosed.

I keep flipping back and forth. When I'm doing okay I wonder if it's all in my head and I just need to be less lazy/more disciplined. But then when I'm having a hard day where I can't seem to even get out of bed I hope I have ADHD in order to have an explanation for my lack of ability to function.

Waiting on some blood tests to come back before I get started on medication and just having a bunch of second thoughts, worry about getting on meds, worry if I actually don't have ADHD but instead bi-polar or something...

Anyways, I have been avoiding caffeine for the most part because if I make it a habit my life goes to shit, yet today I had a coffee so that I'd have some energy to get things done and it's like immediately all my issues went away.

* My mind doesn't feel cloudy/foggy
* I don't feel stupid anymore
* I'm not searching for words, my memory works
* I have been doing all my work that I put off, and full of energy to go workout after my work
* Social engagements no longer give me anxiety, I feel energy and desire to be social whereas all week I've been dreading a halloween party this weekend.

The reason I went to the psychiatrist in the first place is I just have been struggling with motivation/energy so much post Covid. And my doubts make me wonder if there's something else wrong with me, but then the times that I take a stimulant like coffee I feel 100% normal and functional.

My main issue is coffee isn't sustainable long term for me, if I drink it for a few weeks straight the beneficial effects wane and I'm just left with insomnia, fatigue, etc.

So got one of these suction cup holder phone holders but it's not good for visibility no matter where I try to place on the windshield.

I looked at the infotainment and thought ""why not"". So there it is, attached and holds my phone. The touchscreen still works (which I don't use) and I can navigate the radio using the center console controls without full view of the screen (that's when you memorize your preset :)).

So I wonder if this would cause a mark or damage the screen. Has anyone here ever done this?  I would just use it when driving and take it off when parked so it won't be stuck 24/7.

We went on two dates in my country, to which we spent all day together one the coffee date, and then he made me dinner and I slept over on the second one. We had an amazing time. We spoke a bit more and we only met up twice as I was leaving for my internship a week after we met. 

We chat a bit online, not often but often enough that he offers to come visit me for a week when he returns from his exchange (our time in his country overlapped). He ended up spending the week together in this city he had never been in, and we had the best time. Constant laughter and deep conversation, he taught me things about his country and since it was snowing, we spent most of our time inside together. We got together during this time too. 

Eventually he had to leave, but before he did he confessed that he actually really liked me and was sad to leave - he even cried. As did I, because this felt insanely different to other experiences I have had. He left and we face timed and kept in contact for a few months, I returned to my country and with completely different timezones it was hard to talk all the time. 

A few months went by in sub-consistent contact, and the face times got fewer, as did the messages (more on his half than mine). Eight months passed and we were still kind of keeping up to date, but he got a girlfriend. I was upset (in denial) and after a while I unfollowed him as he hadn't stayed in contact and I was too upset to see him with someone else, although I completely understood our issue - which was distance and timezones.

A month after that, I was in his country again visiting my family there and he contacted me as I had previously told him I was visiting. We were messaging a little and since I was driving through his city, he asked if we could meet him. Since I had unfollowed him I didn't know if he was still with his girlfriend, but I assumed so - we had also agreed to just be friends months back so I considered him reaching out to be strictly friendly. I don't refollow him or anything and we only contact by text.

Three weeks go by and we don't message much, but enough to think we're still on for our lunch. I get to his city and the day before we're supposed to meet he makes up some excuse and face times me to apologise, and say that he thought it was a good idea - but he's seeing someone and he said it would be unfair to her and me by us meeting up. I was confused because he said he didn't have any feelings for me anymore, but meeting up with me would be 'unfair'. We end up re-following each other on social media because he wants to 'stay in touch'. 

Months go by, I'm back in my country and living my life. He sends me instagram reels every now and then and we interact with each others stories  a bit. I posted a selfie one day and he heart reacted it (we all know this is something a guy shouldn't do if he has a girlfriend) and I call him out on it, saying it's something he used to do a lot and I don't feel comfortable with him doing that while he's with his girlfriend. He is defensive at first but then apologises and admits it was wrong. No surprise, he and his girlfriend break up a little while later and we kind of start talking again. We organise a face time and it's like no time has passed. I tell him he should come to my country for the summer and he was thinking the same thing. Like before, the messages and face times kind of halt and he starts dating someone new. He continues to like my posts but now has unfollowed me and left me following him. 

  
I know I unfollowed him before to get over him, but since he is with his new girlfriend I have accepted that he's seeing other people and have seen him in a friendly light since then - but him unfollowing me kind of caught me off guard. I know at the end of the day an unfollow doesn't mean much, but it made me doubt all our history? I haven't been able to stop thinking about it for a couple days now and it's making me feel a bit crazy. Did he want our connection to end? Did his girlfriend make him unfollow me? Was he sick of seeing my face? I'm not sure and a little upset by it, but I don't feel like its reasonable to ask him why he did. 

Am I thinking of him so much because deep down I love him, or am I just obsessed with the 'what if?' that will never happen. Hard to tell. ",3,1761915204.0,dating_advice,1,1.0,False

I‚Äôm a FTM with my lovely 3 week old baby. I couldn‚Äôt be more grateful with everyone and everything in my life right now. I‚Äôm living overseas, and my Mum and Grandma manage to flew over to us a week before I gave birth. They will be staying with us for 2.5 months.

They are both so amazing and do everything in the house for me and my husband while we focus with our LO. Cleaning, laundry, cooking and everything that needs to be done. My Mum takes my baby every other night so everyone in the house can have proper sleep and rest. I had a pretty traumatic birth experience: Labouring for 54 hours, pushing for 2 hours unmediated, couldn‚Äôt push the baby out so I begged for an epidural. Tried pushing again for an hour but baby was getting stressed. Doctor checked and told us my pelvis is small and baby‚Äôs posterior so she won‚Äôt be able to come out vaginally. Ended up with C section. 

My husband is the best he can be. He‚Äôs self employed and basically stays 24/7 with me and baby. He supports me and my family here financially as well (I do have 6 month paid maternity leave but I work part time so it‚Äôs not a lot. We are basically 20/80 financially for now) He‚Äôs changing LO diaper almost all the time and spends time with LO and me a lot. He‚Äôs so involved and stays awake with me when I BF baby at night just so I have ‚Äúcompany‚Äù. He‚Äôs so understanding and supports me emotionally. Husband also tries to get me out of the house 3-4 times a week for quick coffee, OP shop shopping or costco runs, as he is aware of my ‚Äúbaby blues‚Äù. He tries so hard to make me happy.

Lastly, LO is such a delight. She‚Äôs a breastfeed baby and I do pump for when she needs a bottle. She allows everyone to hold her, feed her or put her to sleep. We can already go to family meals out or just beach walks with her, as long as she has a bottle, she‚Äôs good to go. She sleeps 3-4 hrs spans and whenever she wakes up late nights, she goes back right to sleep after the feed and nappy change. 

I know that what I have is everyone‚Äôs post-partum dream, and yet I feel sadness and anxiety every night for a couple of weeks now. I mourn the life I had with my husband when it was just us. I‚Äôm scared my husband will eventually hate me then leave me and the baby. I‚Äôm worried about my Mum and Granda leaving, thinking if we can handle everything on our own. My LO is cluster feeding the WHOLE day today, and it‚Äôs 11PM. This is the worst night for me emotionally and physically. I feel so drained and tired and sad and hopeless. The worst part is I feel guilty being sad instead of being grateful. It‚Äôs so hard for me. I used to be a stable and logical person but now I cannot even control my own feelings. It sucks. I feel like a shell of my old self. I don‚Äôt know where all these feelings are coming from, considering that most baby blues came from lack of sleep and lack of help during the newborn phase. I have it all but I still feel like shit :(",9,1761915123.0,NewParents,5,1.0,False
1oktpmk,https://www.reddit.com/r/VPNforFreedom/comments/1oktpmk/nordvpn_vs_hola_vpn/,NordVPN vs Hola VPN,"**Critical Security Warning**: Before you download Hola VPN or continue using it, you need to understand the serious security risks involved. This isn't just about performance or features‚Äîit's about your safety, privacy, and potential legal liability.

If you're comparing NordVPN and Hola VPN, you're essentially choosing between a legitimate security service and what cybersecurity experts have called a ""dangerous"" peer-to-peer network that could expose you to criminal liability. In this detailed comparison, we'll explain exactly why Hola poses such serious risks and why NordVPN represents the secure alternative you should be using instead.

# The Fundamental Difference: Real VPN vs. Peer-to-Peer Network

Before diving into the comparison, you need to understand a critical distinction: **Hola is not actually a VPN in the traditional sense.** While it claims to protect your privacy, it operates fundamentally differently from legitimate VPN services like NordVPN.

# How NordVPN Works (Traditional VPN Model)

NordVPN, like other legitimate VPNs, maintains a network of physical servers in data centers worldwide. When you connect:

1. Your traffic is encrypted on your device
2. It's routed through NordVPN's secure servers
3. Your real IP address is hidden behind the server's IP
4. NordVPN pays for and controls these servers
5. Your bandwidth and device aren't used by others

This is the standard, secure VPN model used by trusted providers.

# How Hola Works (Peer-to-Peer Network)

Hola operates as a peer-to-peer (P2P) network, which means:

1. **Your device becomes an exit node for other users**
2. Other people route their traffic through YOUR internet connection
3. Their activities appear to come from YOUR IP address
4. You have no control over what others do through your connection
5. Hola sells your bandwidth to third parties through a service called Luminati

This is not just different‚Äîit's dangerous. Let me explain why.

# The 2015 Botnet Scandal That Exposed Hola's Dark Side

In 2015, a major security incident revealed the dangers of Hola's business model. Here's what happened:

A hacker purchased access to Hola users' bandwidth through Luminati (Hola's commercial bandwidth-selling service) and used millions of Hola users' IP addresses to launch a massive DDoS (Distributed Denial of Service) attack against the website 8chan. **Those users unknowingly participated in a coordinated cyberattack‚Äîand it was completely legal for Hola to enable this.**

Frederick Brennan, the administrator of 8chan, explained: ""When a user installs Hola, he becomes a VPN endpoint, and other users of the Hola network may exit through his internet connection and take on his IP. This is what makes it free: Hola does not pay for the bandwidth that its VPN uses at all, and there is no user opt out for this.""

Hola's founder, Ofer Vilenski, confirmed to TorrentFreak that yes, users' idle resources are sold commercially through Luminati. While he claimed they ""screen"" commercial users, the attacker slipped through their screening process.

# What This Means for You

If someone uses Hola's Luminati service to:

* Access illegal content
* Conduct cyberattacks
* Commit fraud
* Download illegal material
* Harass others online

**All of that activity could be traced back to YOUR IP address.** Law enforcement won't see the actual perpetrator‚Äîthey'll see you.

# The Security Analysis: A Shocking Contrast

# Encryption & Security Protocols

**NordVPN:**

* **AES-256 encryption** (military-grade standard)
* Multiple protocol options: NordLynx (WireGuard), OpenVPN, IKEv2/IPsec
* Perfect forward secrecy
* Automatic kill switch prevents data leaks
* DNS leak protection
* Double VPN option for extra encryption layer

**Hola VPN:**

* **NO encryption for free users** (your data travels in clear text)
* Uses proxy connections, not VPN protocols
* Premium users get basic encryption, but implementation lacks transparency
* No kill switch on most platforms
* Multiple DNS and IP leak failures documented in testing
* Security researchers discovered **remote code execution vulnerabilities** in 2015

Trend Micro's 2018 analysis concluded that Hola ""is not a secure VPN"" and classified it as **unwanted software**, noting that web traffic was not encrypted and IP addresses were ""regularly exposed.""

# Privacy & Logging Policies

**NordVPN:**

* **Strict no-logs policy** independently audited by PwC and Deloitte
* Based in Panama (no mandatory data retention laws)
* No browsing history, connection logs, or IP addresses stored
* Cannot provide user data even if requested by authorities
* Transparent privacy policy reviewed by third parties

**Hola VPN:**

* **Extensive logging of user data**, even for premium users
* Logs IP addresses, browsing activity, device information
* Privacy policy states data ""might be shared with third parties""
* Based in Israel (part of intelligence-sharing agreements)
* No independent audits of privacy claims
* Sells user bandwidth commercially through Luminati

Security researcher John Mason stated: ""They log everything you do, they cooperate with surveillance alliances, there is no encryption. This is the least secure VPN I've ever seen.""

# Network Architecture: Servers vs. Exit Nodes

**NordVPN (2025):**

* **7,200+ servers** across 110 countries
* All servers are either owned or leased by NordVPN
* RAM-only servers (no data stored on hard drives)
* Specialty servers: P2P-optimized, Double VPN, Obfuscated servers
* Regular server maintenance and security updates
* You control which server you connect to

**Hola VPN:**

* No traditional server network
* Uses other users' devices as exit nodes
* ""9 million+ IPs"" actually means 9 million users whose bandwidth is being used
* You cannot guarantee location accuracy
* The peer you connect to affects your speed and security
* Premium users get access to some dedicated servers, but architecture remains problematic

# Speed & Performance: Not Worth the Risk

**NordVPN:**

* Consistent speeds averaging 400-800 Mbps on nearby servers
* Proprietary NordLynx protocol optimized for speed
* Minimal speed loss (typically 10-20% on international connections)
* Reliable performance across all server locations
* No dependency on other users' internet connections

**Hola VPN:**

* Speed varies wildly depending on which peer you connect through
* Can be fast on local connections (because it lacks encryption)
* Inconsistent international performance
* If your exit node has slow internet, your speed suffers
* Upload speeds can drop by 70-90% on distant connections

Yes, Hola can sometimes be faster‚Äîbut that's because **it's not actually encrypting your data**. It's like comparing a motorcycle without brakes to a car with a full safety system. The motorcycle might be faster, but at what cost?

# Streaming & Content Access

**NordVPN:**

* Reliably unblocks: Netflix (multiple regions), Disney+, Hulu, BBC iPlayer, Amazon Prime
* SmartPlay technology for seamless streaming
* Consistent access across all server locations
* Fast enough for 4K streaming
* No risk of your account being flagged

**Hola VPN:**

* Can access most streaming platforms
* However, using someone else's residential IP has risks
* Your streaming account could be flagged for suspicious location changes
* The IP you get might not actually be from your chosen location
* Not recommended for streaming due to security risks

# Torrenting: One is Safe, One is Illegal to Use

**NordVPN:**

* **Supports P2P on 5,000+ servers**
* Optimized torrenting servers in P2P-friendly countries
* Strong encryption protects you from ISP monitoring
* SOCKS5 proxy option for faster torrenting
* No logs means no record of your torrenting activity

**Hola VPN:**

* **Blocks torrenting completely** on its network
* Using Hola for torrenting violates their terms of service
* Even if you could torrent, the lack of encryption would expose you
* Your torrenting activity would be visible to your ISP

# Pricing: Is ""Free"" Really Free?

**Hola VPN:**

* Free version: Your bandwidth is sold, your IP is used by strangers, extensive logging
* Premium: $11.99/month or $5.99/month annually
* No money-back guarantee worth trusting (14 days, but only if you don't use the service)

**NordVPN (2025):**

* Monthly: $12.99-$16.59/month
* 1-year plan: $4.59-$8.09/month
* **2-year plan: $2.99-$6.99/month** (best value)
* 30-day money-back guarantee (no questions asked)
* Up to 10 simultaneous device connections

# The Real Cost of ""Free""

With Hola, you're not the customer‚Äî**you're the product**. Your bandwidth is being sold. Your IP address is being used by strangers. Your browsing data is being logged and potentially shared.

For just $2.99/month (less than a cup of coffee), NordVPN provides:

* Real security and encryption
* Independently audited privacy
* Professional infrastructure
* 24/7 customer support
* Peace of mind that you're not liable for others' actions

# The Legal Liability Risk: This is Serious

Let's be crystal clear about the most dangerous aspect of Hola: **You could be held legally responsible for crimes committed by others through your internet connection.**

When Hola sells your bandwidth through Luminati, buyers can:

* Access any website using your IP address
* Download illegal content that traces back to you
* Commit fraud or identity theft
* Send spam or phishing emails
* Participate in cyberattacks
* Access the dark web

If law enforcement investigates, **they see your IP address, not the actual perpetrator's.** You would need to prove you weren't responsible‚Äîwhich could mean:

* Legal fees
* Computer forensics investigation
* Potential criminal charges
* Explaining to investigators why your IP was involved in illegal activity

Is saving a few dollars worth this risk? Absolutely not.

# Why Cybersecurity Experts Warn Against Hola

Major security researchers and organizations have issued warnings about Hola:

**Trend Micro (2018 Analysis):**

* Classified Hola as ""unwanted software""
* Found ""concrete evidence for massive scraping of online content""
* Warned it could enable attackers to circumvent corporate firewalls
* Documented that traffic was not encrypted

**Security Researcher Findings:**

* Remote code execution vulnerabilities discovered
* Persistent tracking IDs across the internet
* Ability for users to act as Man-in-the-Middle for other users
* No transparency about actual security measures

**Google:**

* Removed Hola's Chrome extension from the Chrome Web Store in 2021
* Cited malware concerns as the reason
* Extension has not been restored

When legitimate security companies classify software as ""unwanted"" and major platforms remove it for security concerns, that's a massive red flag.

# NordVPN: The Secure Alternative

While we're critical of Hola for good reason, NordVPN represents what a legitimate VPN should be:

# Proven Security Track Record

* Multiple independent security audits (PwC, Deloitte)
* No security breaches or major incidents
* Transparent about security practices
* Regular third-party penetration testing

# Advanced Protection Features

* **Threat Protection Pro**: Blocks malware, ads, and trackers
* **Dark Web Monitor**: Alerts if your credentials are compromised
* **Meshnet**: Create encrypted private networks
* **Split tunneling**: Choose which apps use the VPN

# Privacy You Can Verify

* Audited no-logs policy
* Based in privacy-friendly Panama
* Open about ownership and operations
* Regular transparency reports

# Reliable Performance

* Consistent speeds for everyday use
* Dedicated IP option available
* 99.99% uptime guarantee
* Works in restrictive countries

# Professional Support

* 24/7 live chat support
* Extensive knowledge base
* Email support
* Active community forums

# Alternative VPN Options (If Not NordVPN)

If you're still not convinced about NordVPN, here are other legitimate alternatives‚Äîbut **please avoid Hola**:

**ExpressVPN**: Premium speeds, excellent security, user-friendly ($8.32/month) **Surfshark**: Budget-friendly, unlimited devices, strong security ($2.19/month) **Proton VPN**: Swiss privacy laws, excellent free tier with no bandwidth limits **Mullvad**: Anonymous sign-up, flat $5.58/month pricing

All of these are legitimate VPNs with:

* Real encryption
* No bandwidth selling
* Independent audits
* Transparent business models

# Making the Smart Choice: Your Security Matters

The comparison between NordVPN and Hola isn't really a comparison at all‚Äîit's a choice between:

‚úÖ **NordVPN**: A legitimate, audited, secure VPN service with transparent practices ‚ùå **Hola**: A risky peer-to-peer network that turns your device into an exit node for strangers

# You should choose NordVPN (or another legitimate VPN) if you:

* Value your privacy and security
* Don't want to risk legal liability
* Need reliable encryption
* Want consistent performance
* Expect professional customer support
* Care about who's using your internet connection

# You might consider Hola if you:

* Are willing to let strangers use your IP address
* Don't care if your data is logged and shared
* Are comfortable with no encryption
* Want to risk legal liability for others' actions
* Trust a service that sold users' bandwidth in a botnet attack

When put that way, the choice is obvious, isn't it?

# Final Verdict: Don't Gamble with Your Security

**Hola VPN Score: 2/10** (Only not zero because it can technically change your apparent location) **NordVPN Score: 9/10** (One of the best VPNs available in 2025)

Here's our unequivocal recommendation: **Do not use Hola VPN.** The security risks, privacy violations, and legal liability far outweigh any benefits of a ""free"" service.

If you're currently using Hola:

1. Uninstall it immediately from all devices
2. Change passwords for any accounts you accessed while using it
3. Monitor your credit and personal information
4. Sign up for a legitimate VPN like NordVPN

If you're considering Hola:

* Don't install it
* Read this article again
* Choose a legitimate VPN instead
* Protect yourself properly

We have no village. Daycare 3 days a week. I'm growing increasingly unhappy. He is not a throw-the-whole-man-away situation, at all. He puts in a lot of work with our daughter, just not as much as me. He doesn't have shitty politics. I have no worries about other women. He isn't a sex pest.

You can pick from three cocoa levels 21%, 31%, or 40% or try flavours like mint or honeycomb for something different. Every option is gluten-free, so that everyone can enjoy it.

Espresso-based options still lead most menus, but more people want something different, warm, comforting, and spiced, yet just as satisfying. Many caf√©s struggle to offer tea-based drinks that match coffee in flavour and appeal. Our solution is an authentic, balanced, spiced beverage that helps you attract new customers. This premium blend uses black tea leaves and aromatic spices like cinnamon, cardamom, cloves, fresh ginger, and green cardamom pods to create a rich, naturally flavoured drink that stands up to any coffee.

I've loved writing MDs (see my [2023 diary](https://www.reddit.com/r/MoneyDiariesACTIVE/comments/12alqou/i_am_23_years_old_make_48000_as_a_paralegal_in/), [2024 Japan travel diary](https://www.reddit.com/r/MoneyDiariesACTIVE/comments/1bvtdo7/im_24_make_50000_as_a_paralegal_in_nyc_and_spent/), and [2025 diary](https://www.reddit.com/r/MoneyDiariesACTIVE/comments/1k4gbzk/im_25_make_55000_as_a_paralegal_in_nyc_and_this/)), so I'm back for more!

I had a blast on my first solo trip, and was dead-set on doing a Barcelona solo trip this year using all my credit card points. After looking at flights, I saw they cost a ton (80,000 points for a $700 flight??? insanity), found great deals on direct flights to Japan, thought about all the stuff I skipped last time...so here we are! Again!

# Section One: Bio

**Age**: 26

**Occupation**: Paralegal

**Hometown**: Originally a Midwestern city; currently live in NYC

**Number of PTO days and how you accrue them**: Current balance is 13 days. I accrue 18 days of PTO each year (9 days every 6 months), with the amount scaling up based on tenure.

# Section Two: Assets + Debt

**Retirement Balance**:¬†**$23,217**¬†in my 401k and¬†**$1,155**¬†in a Roth IRA.

**Savings account balance**:¬†**$4,097**¬†in a regular account and¬†**$18**,**235** in a HYSA.

**Checking account balance**:¬†**$3,947**¬†in my regular checking account and¬†**$701**¬†in a Charles Schwab checking account (the latter is only used for cash withdrawals when traveling).

**Credit card debt**: None!

**Student loan debt**:¬†**$10,469**¬†for my public unsubsidized loan (I'm on the SAVE plan and currently not making payments) and¬†**$10,364**¬†for my private loan (which my parents are paying off as a gift), both for my liberal arts bachelor's degree.

# Section Three: Income

**Main Job Monthly Take Home**:¬†**\~$3,200** ($27.05/hr) after taxes and 8% pre-tax contribution to my 401k.

**Any Other Monthly Income Here**: For full transparency, my parents still pay for a good chunk of my expenses. In addition to paying off my private student loan, they pay for my cell phone, health insurance, therapy expenses not covered by our insurance (\~$250/mo), and occasional late-night Ubers.

# Section Four: Travel Expenses

**Transportation: $122.28** for a round-trip economy flight from NYC to HND. This flight normally would have cost \~$1500, but I booked with points and only paid tax/fees. Yay points!

**Accommodations:**

* **$432.05** ($72.01/night) for 6 nights in Shinjuku (Tokyo)
* **$187.74** ($93.87/night) for 2 nights in Kanazawa
* **$220.71** ($73.57/night) for 3 nights in Osaka
* **$308.01** ($102.93/night) for 3 nights in Akasaka (Tokyo)

This totals **$1,148.51**. I'll also be staying at a ryokan for one night while I'm in Shibu Onsen, which will be paid in cash on-site.

**Pre-Vacation Spending:**

I bought a few items for this trip:

* **$14.97** for Dr. Scholl's insoles
* **$55.98** for noise-cancelling headphones
* **$5.99** for replacement batteries for luggage AirTag

This all totals **$76.94**. I also spent **$6.80** on my Ghibli Museum ticket (which has to be booked a month ahead) and sent my parents **$120** to cover my international data pass (I found the pocket wifi finicky on my last trip, and it would be just as expensive to rent one for 2.5 weeks).

# Travel Diary

Like my last diary, only cash withdrawals will be counted in my daily totals, but for my entries for items bought with cash, I'll note the price in yen. For reference, the current exchange rate is about ¬•150 = $1.

For my grand totals at the end, aside from my first ATM pull of ¬•30,000 (which accounts for my ryokan stay), I'll be splitting my cash withdrawals 50/25/25 between food, shopping, and entertainment. I refuse to drive myself crazy trying to do the real math lol.

**DAY 0**:

* Wake up hellishly early to head to Newark. I'd considered Ubering, but with the cost and my tendency to get carsick, public transit it is! I pay **$2.95** for the subway and **$16** for NJ Transit/ AirTrain. On the way, I add ¬•1000 (**$6.97**) to my digital Suica card.
* Make it to Newark around a solid 2.5 hours before boarding. After clearing security, I get some breakfast (**$24.95**) and buy water bottles for the flight (**$18.54**).
* Time flies by surprisingly quickly and it‚Äôs time to board! Our flight is delayed an hour due to a missing nozzle(?), which is annoying, but I manage to not go totally stir-crazy for most of the 15 hours.

üí∏ DAY TOTAL: **$69.41**

**DAY 1**:

* Land in Tokyo! Customs is hectic and unbearably hot inside. I book it to the subway and add another ¬•5000 (**$34.00**) to my Suica.
* Check into my hotel around 4:30 pm and immediately hop in the shower as I am drenched in sweat.
* Stroll around Shinjuku and pull ¬•30,000 from a 7/11 ATM (**$205.44**). Dinner is oyakodon and a beer at Taizen (¬•2000). It‚Äôs a tiny place mostly filled with regulars, so I feel a little like I‚Äôm intruding, but the meal is so comforting.
* Walk around more and roll some gashapon at C-pla (¬•1200).
* Grab taiyaki and an Aquarius at a konbini (¬•350) before flopping into bed.

üí∏ DAY TOTAL: **$239.44**

**DAY 2**:

* Wake up at 5 am to sirens. I‚Äôm annoyed to be up this early, but I decide to watch some Netflix to keep myself awake. I immediately fall asleep and don‚Äôt wake up again until 10:30 lol.
* Head out around 11:00; SOTD is Jardin de Monseiur Li. I get PJs (I only brought one set‚Äîoops), some stationery, and a scrubby shower cloth at Muji (**$37.66**).
* Stop in Daiso and get a coin purse and tea (**$2.24**). Looking at the snacks makes me realize I haven‚Äôt eaten anything, so I have lunch at Kaitenzushi Numazuko (**$21.01**)
* More shopping! I get some clothes at Uniqlo (**$43.58**), an umbrella and an embarrassing amount of washi tape and stickers at my beloved Hands (**$85.85**), and sunglasses at Jins (**$49**).
* Rest my feet at Le Cafe W. I order a mille crepe cake and some iced tea (¬•950).
* Walk around Shinjuku Central Park. I stop by a shrine complex‚Äîthe buildings are closed, but I read the signage and learn about the history. From what I understand there used to be waterfalls there but they were paved over? Bummer, but at least there‚Äôs a man-made waterfall in the park.
* Catch the sunset at the Tokyo Govt Building observatory for free(!). As I walk out I hear noise from a demonstration which has some Rising Sun flags. Yikes.
* Take the subway to the hotel to drop my stuff, then dinner at Kirimugiya Jinroku (¬•1500).
* Buy a ton of cosmetics at Cocokara Fine to stay awake (**$78.08**), grab konbini dessert (**$3.44**), then off to bed.

üí∏ DAY TOTAL: **$320.86**

**DAY 3**:

* Get ready for the day (SOTD is Orpheon). Subway to Daikanyama, then have breakfast at Garden House Crafts (**$9.82**). Their hojicha latte is incredible.
* Walk around Log Road and browse T-Site, where I find a NYC guidebook that recommends a few non-touristy restaurants in my old and current neighborhoods. Neat!
* Visit Kyu Asakura House and get a ton of mosquito bites (¬•500).
* Have a chai latte at Duct Coffee Lab (**$4.76**). Way too sweet. Bleh.
* Walk to Nakameguro and buy more stationery at Travelers Factory (**$78.50**).
* Lunch at Curry Station Niagara (¬•1300). My curry is delivered by toy train. So adorable!!
* Walk back to the subway. I surprisingly love Nakameguro? There's more mixed-use development than I expected, but also tons of quiet residential streets. A girl in my car folds paper cranes with her mom and I about die from how cute it is.
* Hang out in the room for a few hours. I planned on going to a show tonight in Shimokitazawa, but I feel like garbage and email the venue to cancel my ticket.
* Konbini dinner of soba, egg sando, and ice cream (**$9.80**). I enjoy a hot bath to prep for the onsens I'll be visiting soon before bed.

üí∏ DAY TOTAL: **$102.88**

**DAY 4**:

* SOTD is Vow Factor. I need something green and fresh to help me feel less gross with this brutal humidity. I am so sweaty.
* Konbini breakfast of mentaiko onigiri and hojicha (**$2.52**). I go to three different stores to find some itch cream for my bug bites (**$2.97**).
* Take the subway towards Yanaka and walk through Yanaka Cemetery. Most of the temples seem to be closed to the public today for funeral services.
* Get cardamom bread and grapefruit & pistacho tarte from Think (**$5.24**). So delicious. I eat both at a playground inside the cemetery, which feels a little morbid and disrespectful, but there's nowhere else nearby to sit and eat, so...
* Walk towards Yanaka Ginza just as it starts raining. I get a peach iced tea from a stand and enjoy some shelter (¬•450).
* Once it lightens up I stroll around the side streets. Sucks being so wet, but the rain really adds to \~the vibe\~.
* Walk around Nezu Shrine; get a goshuin (¬•1000) and omikuji (¬•200).
* My feet hurt and I'm starving, so I pop into a random kissa run by three ancient grandmas. Enjoy toast and coffee (¬•1050).
* Subway to Kanda/Jimbocho. There are so many kids getting out of school. Sucks to be them and have class on a Saturday!
* Pass by Gotoinari Shrine and get a goshuin (¬•500).
* Lunch at Curry Bondy (¬•1700). It's delish, but I'm unfortunately not able to finish after having my snack earlier.
* Go to Tobichi. I wanted to get a Hobonichi Weeks for next year, but they're out of stock of all the designs I want in both English and Japanese. I buy a bunch of Earthbound/Mother 3 merch there and it more than makes up for my disappointment (**$29.02**).
* Browse a bunch of the bookstores and buy a calendar at one (**$8.23**).
* My feet eventually give out so I head back to the hotel.
* After resting up I have dinner at Horumon Chiba. I get the same course I had at their Kyoto location on my last trip along with two lemon sours. Sooo good. (\~¬•5200). When my drink refill arrives my mouth is full, so I burst out a garbled ""aruhgtmou gozsdsweimasss."" The two guys sitting next to me say to themselves it's cute and I die of embarrassment.
* Get 2 Aquariuses and melon pan to prepare for my night out in Nichome (**$4.22**). I chug one Aquarius then head to Bar Goldfinger (¬•700). Make friends with some lovely lesbians, one of whom is coincidentally from my hometown??? Small world.
* A girl who is there with her GF gets extremely touchy with me--yikes--so I decide to switch locations and head to New Sazae. Have a drink, chat with a lovely couple from CDMX, and vibe to disco (¬•1000).
* Around 1 am I get too tired and sweaty and head home. Take a shower, drink my other Aquarius, then conk out.

üí∏ DAY TOTAL: **$52.20**

**DAY 5**:

* Spend most of the morning chilling in my room as I am tired and slightly hungover. I eventually get dressed (SOTD is One Day Jasmine Tea) and take the subway to Nakano.
* Walk around Sun Mall, have lunch at a kaitenzushi place (**$12.72**), then wander around Nakano Broadway. I don't buy anything but have fun seeing all the vintage toys, games, and watches. So many vintage watches. If you're a watch person, this is your place.
* Once I get tired of window shopping I take the subway to Koenji to check out the secondhand stores there. I pop into a leather store called Whistler that I completely skipped on my last visit, as they seemed to only carry shoes, and discover the motherlode of vintage Coach. I die looking at all their bags but hold off on buying one.
* Have an iced tea at Aruza Dokushoukan (¬•680). I came here wanting to journal, but once I get there I realize I left my journal in my room, so instead I sit and browse on my phone. Everyone else is reading a book and I really feel like I'm disrupting the vibes, so I don't stay long.
* Walk back to the subway. I really love hanging out in Koenji--everyone is so cool!--but I am fading fast.
* Have dinner at Shimpachi Shokudo near my hotel (**$9.72**). I'm very impressed by the people who are able to pick their fish completely clean.
* Do some laundry (\~¬•300) then off to bed!

üí∏ DAY TOTAL: **$22.44**

**DAY 6**:

* Get ready (SOTD is J-Scent Yuzu), do ATM withdrawal in prep for all my temple/shrine visits (**$68.74**), have a quick konbini breakfast (**$4.49**), then off to Kamakura!
* Take the train then bus to Hokokuji. Get a goshuin (¬•500) and tour the grounds (¬•400).
* Bus back to Tsurugaoka Hachimangu. Get a goshuin at the shrine on the grounds and feed the fish (¬•600). They are absolutely ravenous and it cracks me up.
* Get a goshuin and omikuji at the main temple and tour their small museum (¬•900).
* I'm so so sweaty. Cool down with lunch at Wasai Yakura Komachidori and try shirashu--it's meh but the rest of the fish is amazing. (**$15.64**)
* Stroll down Komachi-dori. Buy a handkerchief to dab the sweat away along with Kamakura-exclusive washi tape at the Miffy store (**$8.67**).
* Subway to Meigetsu-in. Pay ¬•500 for entry and ¬•1000 for matcha and sweets. They have a live rabbit there which is adorable.
* Walk to Jochiji and pay ¬•300 for entry, then hike some of the Daibutsu trail. I become even sweatier but enjoy the views.
* Arrive at Zenirai Benten. This temple is known for caves where you wash your money for good luck. Get an envelope for my washed bills and coins and a goshuin (¬•600). Pray that all the money I've already spent on this trip will come back to me lol.
* I bail on the rest of the hike and walk the main roads to Kotoku-in. Pay for entry and a goshuin (¬•1000).
* Last temple of the day is Hasedera which has some gorgeous views! I get a goshuin and omikuji (¬•1500).
* Take the train to Cape Imagurasaki, stop by a 7/11 for ice cream (**$1.98**), and enjoy the sunset. On my walk back to the enoden I see a man whose dog is aggressively humping his leg. The image is forever seared in my brain.
* I go to Nagisa no Hamburger for dinner and have one of the best cheeseburgers I've ever had (**$16.73**). I'm still thinking about it weeks later. If you're ever in Kamakura, highly recommend!
* Walk back to the train! My Suica is running low so I add ¬•2000 (**$13.18**). Once I'm back at the hotel I do some packing before I fall asleep.

üí∏ DAY TOTAL: **$116.25**

**DAY 7**:

* Hurriedly get ready (SOTD is Philosykos) in time for check out. I stop by 7/11 to withdraw more cash (**$202.78**) and grab some breakfast (**$4.51**). It's my first time having one of their frozen smoothies and I'm obsessed.
* Off to Tokyo Station! I grab a shinkansen ticket to Nagano (**$54.62**), then spent the next hour milling around. I get a croissant and iced tea as a snack (**$6.08**), then grab an ekiben of anago (**$12.77**).
* I make it to Nagano and barely miss my connection, so I have to wait an hour and a half for the next train to Yudanaka. Ugh. If I had made it I would have been too early for check-in anyway, so I can't be too mad, but still. I journal to help pass the time.
* Take the local train (**$7.98**)! Such a scenic ride--it's apple season and there are orchards everywhere. It helps assure me that it is actually fall despite the weather.
* Short bus ride from Yudanaka Station to Shibu Onsen (¬•250), then check into my ryokan. Once I'm settled in I pop into their onsen and thankfully I'm the only one there. I need to build up the bravery to be witnessed naked by others lol.
* Hang out in my room, too scared to use the public baths, until dinner time. I have some hida beef and it is some of the best steak I've ever had.
* Finally work up the nerve to do some onsen hopping around town and it is amazing. One of them is WAY too hot for me to even put a foot in, but four grannies hop in without an issue. I wish I was built different but alas.
* While I'm walking around some parade with booze and mochi comes by?? Not sure if it's a nightly thing or what, but I am delighted to enjoy some free sake. I head back to the hotel shortly after and enjoy my night in a futon.

üí∏ DAY TOTAL: **$288.74**

**DAY 8**:

* Wake up and pop into the ryokan's outdoor bath (amazing) before breakfast at the ryokan.
* Quickly hop into one of the town's baths, get changed into normal clothes (and put on my SOTD One Day Pu'er Tea), pack up, and check out.
* My hotel shuttles me to Jigokudani (and transports my luggage to Yudanaka Station) and I take the short hike up to the monkey park (¬•800). Unfortunately there's only one macaque around--apparently during the fall they're busy mating up in the mountains. Will have to come back some day in the wintertime to enjoy the full onsen snow monkey experience.
* Take the longer route to the bus. I pass by the spring water and it smells like rotten eggs. Ew. Sure does feel amazing to soak in though!!
* I JUST miss the bus, but the station attendants call me a taxi (**$13.32**). I once again am a few minutes late for the train (what is with my luck with transpo in Nagano???), so I do some gift shopping while I wait (**$6.26**).
* Take the train to Nagano (**$7.92**), buy an apple pie and pork katsu sandwich at the station (**$9.06**), then take the shinkansen to Kanazawa (**$59.39**). It was gorgeous in Nagano, but it's a very dreary day in Kanazawa. Bummer.
* After buying a ticket for hotel breakfast (**$19.71**) I flop in bed for a few hours. I am not in the mood to be outside with it being so gross out.
* I want an easy dinner so kaitenzushi it is. On my walk I hear so many Anglo tourists and it feels SO weird to hear so much English even though I've only been here a week.
* Stuff my face at Hirari (**$13.32**), do a konbini dessert stop (**$2.77**), and immediately fall asleep once I'm back in the room.

üí∏ DAY TOTAL: **$131.75**

**DAY 9**:

* I'm up early, so I beat the crowds to the breakfast buffet. It's good, but not ¬•3000 good.
* Take my sweet time getting ready (SOTD is One Day Osmanthus Tea) before walking to Nagamachi District. I tour Nomura-ke (¬•550), check out the side streets, and walk past a giant Jesus statue which really takes me out of the historical vibes lol.
* I'm already super sweaty (I keep trying to dress for fall and it is just not fall weather right now), so I quickly stop back in my room to change.
* Stroll through Oyama Shrine--I unfortunately don't have small bills/coins so will have to come back for a goshuin later--on my way to Kanazawa Castle. A huge group of kids on a school tour pass by. One asks where I'm from, and when I say America he and his friends get SO excited. I wish I shared his enthusiasm lol.
* Get a ticket to tour part of the reconstructed castle and Kenrokuen (¬•1000). The inside of the castle is mostly about the construction methods, which frankly idgaf, so I skedaddle out of there to grab lunch at Omicho Kaisendon (**$17.20**).
* Walk around Kenrokuen. It's seriously gorgeous--one of the highlights of the trip. While I'm there I tour Seison-kaku, a home on its grounds (¬•1000).
* Walk around Kanazawa Shrine and get a goshuin (¬•500). It comes with gold leaf on it--very nice touch!
* Take the bus to Higashichaya! I go to Maccha House and get a hojicha tiramisu (topped with gold leaf!) and an iced matcha (**$8.90**).
* Stroll around Higashichaya some more, then watch an American guy eat shit and hit his head. After reuniting him with his family I take that as my cue to leave (somehow staying around here feels ominous) and walk to Kazuemachi Chaya.
* Bus back to the hotel to regroup! I look up some restaurants on Tabelog. When I walk there, one is randomly closed, and two are fully booked. Ugh. Kaitenzushi to the rescue! 
* I eat my fill at Morimori (**$23.69**), grab konbini dessert (¬•440), then fall asleep.

üí∏ DAY TOTAL: **$49.79**

**DAY 10**:

* Wake up and enjoy a dip in the hotel sento. I am already mostly comfortable being naked in front of strangers--crazy how much can change in a few days. 
* Get ready, spray my SOTD of Ethereal Wave, then head towards Omicho Market. I get some chutoro nigiri (¬•1300), curry pan and pumpkin croquette (¬•900)--I only get to enjoy the curry pan as I drop my croquette on the ground :-(--and fig daifuku (¬•572).
* I still have some time before check out, so I stop by Oyama Shrine and get a \~special\~ goshuin (¬•1500).
* Check out, walk to Kanazawa Station, buy myself an ekiben for lunch and some souvenirs for friends/family (**$18.86**), then off to Osaka (**$63.35**)!
* Once I get to Osaka I subway to my hotel. I get there at 2:40 and ask to check-in, but they say I need to wait as check-in is at 3:00. Love traveling in Japan, but this sticklerism is so annoying lol. I wait the 20 mins, pay the accommodation tax of ¬•600, and drop my stuff in my room.
* Take the subway to the aquarium! I forgot to buy a ticket ahead of time, so I buy one at the booth out front (**$17.74**).  My time slot isn't for another hour, so I hang out at the nearby shops to enjoy a Cremia (¬•600) and roll gacha (¬•400).
* Enjoy the aquarium and die of happiness. I buy some washi tape from the gift shop (**$6.24**).
* Dinner is at Senryo Sushi (**$27.92**). I feel guilty for eating fish after thinking for 2.5 hours about how precious our oceans are, but also, I love sushi and I'm getting it while it's affordable and readily available. I say thank you for the meal in Japanese on my way out, but the chef stops me to compliment my Japanese. He and most of the whole restaurant CLAP for me when I stammer out a very basic reply and I again die of embarrassment.
* Subway back to the hotel! On my way I spot a Japanese girl in full Chola makeup. Yikes.
* Enjoy a konbini dessert (\~¬•500), withdraw some more cash (**$66.42**), do some laundry (¬•500), then conk out.

üí∏ DAY TOTAL: **$200.53**

**DAY 11**:

* I sleep in today. I feel so exhausted and decide to get some rest so I can actually enjoy the back half of this trip.
* Get ready (SOTD is D'Orsay MD), grab konbini smoothie and onigiri (\~¬•560), then subway to Shinsekai.
* Buy a ticket for Tsutenkaku (**$7.94**). My time slot isn't for a while, so I grab tea and pancakes at Brother (¬•1230), roll a gacha (¬•200), buy some souvenirs (**$6.84**), then get a Billiken taiyaki thing (¬•350). The area is extremely touristy and corny but I really enjoy it!
* Time slot finally arrives and I enjoy the view. The tower is again extremely kitschy but endearing.
* I'm sweaty and want to get rid of my souvenirs, so I head back to my room. I add ¬•5000 to my Suica as I'm running low again (**$32.96**).
* Lunch at Naniwa Omurice (¬•2200). Delish. There's a C-pla right outside so I roll some gacha (¬•1700).
* Wander around Americamura and browse the vintage stores. There are so many cool, stylish people here, but also a lot of Japanese people rocking hairstyles like cornrows and locs. Yikes again.
* Collapse in the room for a few hours. When I realize it's gotten super late, I sprint to a Yakiniku Like before they close for an easy dinner (**$12.44**).
* Walk through Dotonbori on my way back to the hotel, which is not as miserably crowded as I expected.
* Grab a konbini drink and ice cream. Good night!

üí∏ DAY TOTAL: **$60.18**

**DAY 12**:

* Day trip today! Meant to wake up early but I slept in. Get ready (SOTD is Parisien Musc), grab konbini breakfast (**$3.46**), then take the train to Kobe.
* Subway to Nunobiki Herb Garden, then buy a ticket for the gondola (¬•1400). Jesus christ we are high up!
* Immediately beeline towards the fragrance museum. I get a huge kick out of seeing all the vintage fragrances they have.
* Walk around the gardens. Another super overcast day, but it's so gorgeous. So many bees around. I get lavender ice cream at the bottom (¬•600).
* Hike down to Nunobiki Falls. An Australian lady accompanies me--we end up grabbing lunch together at some curry place in Kitanocho before parting ways. I pay with my card and she reimburses me for her share in cash (**$36.39**).
* Go to Kitano Tenman Shrine and get a goshuin (¬•500). Enjoy more of the great views.
* Walk around Kitanocho. It feels like I'm in London with all the western Victorian mansions. I get a mille fuille and iced tea at Moore House and indulge my tea time fantasy (**$15.82**).
* It's about to get dark, so I take the train back to Osaka and hang out in the room for a bit.
* Do some shopping in Shinsaibashi-suji. I grab Peanuts merch for friends (**$28.80**) and Ace Attorney merch for myself (**$11.65**).
* I stop by two different kushikatsu places I found in Tabelog and both are fully booked. This is what I get for not making resos. I find a nearby izakaya called Agotta with kushikatsu on Google Maps and have the best time (¬•1950). It's really smoky inside but a total vibe.
* Obligatory 7/11 snack and drink before bed (**$2.28**)! I also pull some money from the ATM (**$66.90**). Where does my money keep going???

üí∏ DAY TOTAL: **$165.30**

**DAY 13**:

* Wake up early today--yay! Get ready with SOTD Orpheon, take the subway to Namba Yasaka Jinja and get a goshuin (¬•1000). That lion head sure is huge.
* Walk to Hozen-ji. the office seems to be closed, so no goshuin for me, but I drop ¬•50 to light some incense. Such a gorg tiny temple!
* Take the subway back to my hotel. Grab a quick konbini breakfast before checking out (**$4.43**).
* Subway to Osaka Station! I store my luggage (**$6.62**) then walk to Nakazakicho. Such a cute neighborhood! Way more my speed than the more central/touristy areas of Osaka.
* Enjoy a katsu sando and iced tea at Neel (**$15.09**). Seems like it's very popular with influencer types?
* Wander around more then head to Ogimachi Park. I come across a Free Palestine demonstration. <3 Makes me so happy to see so many older people. I give the organizers ¬•500 and join for a bit.
* Check out Hep 5 Mall. I roll some more gacha ¬•600 and browse some clothing stores.
* Stop by the nearby Loft. Buy more cosmetics, stationery, and Ace Attorney merch (they randomly had a pop-up and when I tell you my eyes LIT UP) for myself, and some souvenirs for friends/family (**$132.50**).
* Head back to Osaka Station to pick up my luggage. It is MADNESS. It is only then that I realize that a) it's a holiday and b) the last day of the Osaka World Expo. All the reserved seats for Tokyo-bound shinkansens are sold out for the day, and I didn't buy a ticket in advance, which means jockeying for seats in the unreserved cars. I buy my ticket and mentally prepare for a miserable 2.5 hours (**$92.34**).
* By some miracle I get a seat where I'm able to place my big luggage behind me!!! Hooray. My ride is only slightly miserable.
* Subway to Akasaka and check into my hotel, then dinner at Happiness is Katsudon (**$10.01**). Damn right it is!! So delicious and filling.
* Grab konbini dessert on the way back to the hotel (**$4.62**). My calves are super tight, so I soak in the hotel sento before bed.

üí∏ DAY TOTAL: **$265.61**

**DAY 14**:

* Slow start to the morning! Take my time getting ready (SOTD is Vow Factor) then take the subway to Omotesando.
* Wait in a blessedly short line for I'm donut (**$6.55**). They're good, but not wait for an hour/spend $10 per donut at their Times Square location.
* Walk towards Shibuya and do some window-shopping.
* Quick lunch at Sushi Ginza Onodera--possibly the best sushi I've had on this trip? (**$28.63**)
* Buy more souvenirs at Shibuya Loft (**$47.05**) and the Nintendo Store (**$44.96**). I also go inside the Pokemon Center and it is literally hell on earth so I gtfo expeditiously.
* Drop stuff at the hotel and spend like 2 hours sorting all my purchases to keep track of what I've bought for people lol.
* Finally gather my strength to check out Shimokita. Subway there and check out more secondhand stores. Nothing piques my interest, but I do get a good laugh when I see a Walmart sweatshirt priced at ¬•12000. Insanity.
* Buy two full sizes of J-Scent Yuzu and Hojicha (I've shockingly not gone through my minis yet even though I wear them all the time) and a copy of Pachinko at Tsutaya (**$85.09**).
* Have a lovely dinner and cocktails at Mother's Ruin (¬•4100). I have a great time chatting with the bartenders (all women!!). I get super flushed from the drinks and they say it's cute. Thank you, Irish ancestors & rosacea!
* Subway back home! Obligatory konbini drink and dessert (**$5.53**), then turn in for the night.

üí∏ DAY TOTAL: **$217.81**

**DAY 15**:

* Today is the day!! Ghibli Museum!!! I'm so excited. Get ready (SOTD is One Day Osmanthus Tea) and take the subway to Kichijoji.
* Walk to Chai Break for an amazing masala chai and French toast (**$15.97**). It's a bit chilly today, thank god, and I'm feeling the full fall fantasy with the food and interior.
* Walk around Inokashira Park on my way to the museum. So beautiful! Totally get why Kichijoji is such a desirable area. I stop by Inokashira Benzaiten and give ¬•200 for incense and an omikuji.
* Museum time! Unfortunately no photos are allowed inside (which I think is for the best) so I try to sear every detail into my memory. So whimsical, and I love the Art Nouveau touches. I die seeing development sketches from various films and the background art from The Boy and the Heron.
* I watch a short film about an egg and dough escaping from a witch. The witch has HUGE boobs and gets food all over them and I feel seen.
* Once I'm done exploring, I get some souvenirs at the gift shop (**$41.36**) and enjoy strawberry soft serve and a soda from the cafe (\~¬•800).
* Take the bus back towards Kichijoji Station and have the lunch set at GG Pizzeria (**$18.14**). Possibly on par with actual Neapolitan pizza?
* Browse the secondhand shops, buy some more souvenirs at Loft (**$17.05**) and the dollar store (**$2.89**), roll some gacha (¬•2000), and play the taiko arcade game whose actual name escapes me (¬•200).
* After all that shopping, I get an iced tea at Doutor and relax for a bit (**$2.64**).
* Subway to Koenji! I pull more cash from an ATM (**$66.70**) and put my goodies in a coin locker (¬•300).
* I go back to Whistler again to admire the vintage Coach. As much as it pains me, I don't get anything. I know I won't really use any of the bags they have for sale as I'm more of a shoulder bag girl.
* Have a lemon sour and nasi campur at Sub Store (\~¬•1600). So good, shockingly cheap, and the owner is so nice!! When I tell him I live in NYC, he says, ""wow, that must be expensive!!"" and it hurts considering Tokyo is supposed to be pricey.
* It's my last full day, it's drizzling, I'm tipsy, there's karaoke nearby, so I do an hour of solo karaoke (**$11.33**).
* Grab my stuff from the coin locker and subway back to my hotel.
* I'd planned on turning in for the night, but the night is young and I'm not ready to go to bed! I decide to take the subway to Shibuya and go to Grandfather's, a bar I loved on my last visit. I enjoy some gimlets and atarime (in honor of the nice lady I met who let me try hers) to throwback records (¬•2860).
* Take the subway back around 11pm to beat the rush before the last train. On my walk back to the hotel there are SO many taxis around, ready to take all the drunk businessmen home.
* Grab konbini dessert (**$2.38**), soak in the hotel sento, do some laundry (¬•400), then off to bed!

üí∏ DAY TOTAL: **$178.46**

**DAY 16**:

* It's my last day! Womp womp. SOTD of One Day Pu'er Tea makes me feel extra melancholic. I accidentally take too much time packing and check out slightly late, but don't get charged for it.
* Have the hotel store my bags, then walk to Aoyama Flower Market Tea House for breakfast (**$15.47**). Absolutely gorgeous interior!
* Subway to Zojo-ji. I get a goshuin inside (¬•500), and while I wait, I watch some ceremony happening. I think they're blessing a baby? The monks keep busting out their iPhones to take pictures of the baby while they chant lol.
* Tour the Tokugawa shogunate graves and their museum (¬•1000). Most of the exhibits are on loan from the British Royal Collection...which all come from the old & now destroyed temple.....in Japan..........which is famously not part of the UK. I shouldn't be surprised and yet I am.
* Top off my Suica with ¬•1000 (**$6.70**) and subway to Kuramae!
* Lunch at Yuwaeru (¬•1800). It's a huge spread but surprisingly light? Unfortunately I make a total ass of myself as I'm confused by the ordering process and all the food is listed in kanji which I can't read. Ah well.
* Write a letter to future me at Jiyucho (**$27.99**). Such a cute way to reflect on the trip! It'll be mailed to my NYC apartment a year from now--I'm excited to see how much I've changed.
* I realize I never bought my Hobonichi Weeks, so subway to Kanda to go by Tobichi. They now have the exact Weeks I want in English! Yay! (**$25.38**)
* Hang out at Mafuni Coffee to escape from the rain. I order a royal milk tea and gateau chocolat which is so decadent (**$12.39**).
* Subway to Ginza to buy a ton of souvenirs of Donki (**$95.51**), then subway back to the hotel as it's time to go to the airport :-( I think about taking a taxi, but then see it's ¬•10,000. Never mind!! Subway to Haneda it is. I add some money to my Suica as I'm slightly low (**$4.69**).
* Check bags, head through security, and have dinner at Ginza Kiya near my gate (**$10.21**). Last time I flew out of Haneda there was a 7/11, but in this weird corner I'm in there's barely any shopping, so no konbini snacks for the plane for me. I get an iced tea and ice cream at the single shop open as a consolation (**$10.04**).
* Time to board! I sleep through the entire 12-hour flight.
* Land in NYC at the same time I took off. Yay for time zones! Customs and baggage claim go surprisingly smoothly (was expecting a nightmare considering the shutdown).
* I take an Uber (financed by the bank of mom and dad) back to my apartment. I unfortunately get carsick and immediately barf once I get home. I eat some frozen food and drink some water to refuel, then conk out again around 2 am.

# Reflection

Can't express enough how much I enjoyed my second time in Japan! Work has been crazy busy, so there was a lot of ""just X more days until vacation"" that got me through the weeks leading up to this trip. It was so restorative yet exhausting in the best way. I anticipated some serious post-trip depression, but right now I'm weirdly happy to be back at work and experiencing autumn in NYC.

I'm most surprised (again) by how much I spent shopping. I planned to buy a lot of stuff for myself and for friends/family and somehow overspent--but even then, considering the tariffs of it all right now, I think I should have bought more. (In hindsight, I feel this trip is a ""last hoorah"" of excessive fun spending before the US economy goes down the toilet.)

1oktiak,https://www.reddit.com/r/scarystories/comments/1oktiak/the_effervescent_drift/,The Effervescent Drift,"I throbbed back to my senses. In pain, I could only recall the screeching of tires a burst of white and then darkness. The feedback of the monitors reverberated as I felt a  pleasure dichotomous with my state, I then had an overwhelming need to swallow and wasn't able to... I recalled driving with my little 3 year old daughter Sarah in the back and had to know if they were okay. I scrambled for the call button and frantically clicked on it. As I was clacking away, one of the disheveled nurses came in with a look of concern. ""Hang on dear, you've suffered quite the bonk. Let's see if we can get you settled."" She then called in someone to help her pull out the tube preventing me from finding out how my kid was. I hacked out some bloody phlegm and rasped out ""Sah... SARAH!!!"" After the nurses worriedly looked at each other, they informed me that there were no survivors from my car. I felt a great abyss... like having the floor sink away into a bottomless chasm. I wept as I recalled all of her milestones, as the invisible light of pure and natural expression was forever extinguished. Her grasping my hand as I first held her. Her first word ""hat"". The smell of strawberry shampoo. The way she giggled and waddled away when I chased her with my sock puppet. No more. I failed her. How would I tell Vicki??? She would never forgive me... and yet, I still have to tell her.

I sat at the edge of the bed, ruminating... anticipating how my wife of 5 years would respond to our sudden loss of everything. How can I even present such an awful scenario? I saw the time on my phone was late, and there was one missed call. I reluctantly pulled that number up and held the receiver to the side of my face that wasn't bandaged. The burbling of the ringing tone trailing off made my mind wander as I heard the dreaded crackling of her phone being answered. ""Yeah?"" I must have woke her up. ""Veronica?"" I said shakily. ""Where are you? I tried calling, but nobody answered. I must've dozed off waiting."" As she said this, I started to cry. She responded ""Oh my God! Why are you cry-"" she trailed off. I knew it set in. ""What HAPPENED??? ANWER ME!!!"" she screamed... the scream of a concerned mother on the precipice of giving it her all or giving it up. I couldn't formulate a response. ""WHAT THE FUCK HAPPENED!!!"" I squelched out a response in my haze of loss while on the brink of being berated: ""I... it came out of nowhere."" I sensed the underlying boiling in the calculating silence. ""What... did... YOU...DO!?!?!?"" This was coming from loss, and I couldn't blame her. I hung up to let her process something that can never be processed while I did the same.

The whole situation was a blur. I was just picking our daughter up from my parent's and must have gotten blindsided. 

I was checked on by a few nurses throughout the night, and one of them commented on how lucky I was to not be paralyzed from the neck down. I tried not to snap at her as a stinging wave of grief washed over me.

I found out the next day while drinking a coffee in my room and watching the news that it was a drunk driver that rear ended me in a lifted pickup. He hit my car going so fast that he basically ramped off of my trunk, flipped, then went on his lid into oncoming traffic. Some stupid fucking uninsured hick without a cent to his name... at least he's dead now. From my ruminating came a voice ""Cold."" I glanced around the room, but couldn't place an origin. Vicki never called to see if I was alright, so I called my parents to pick me up and give her space. As the nurse came in with a wheelchair to help discharge me, I noticed she had an unusual grin. I had to ask. ""Having a good day?"" She stopped grinning, and just stared at me. She said, ""Cold."" Before gesturing to the wheelchair and holding me by the arm to stabilize and transfer me. She continued to address me, ""It's dark down here."" She then kept on, ""To see is to be seen."" I had to ask her what she was talking about, and when I did, she just looked at me like I was crazy. 

My dad came to pick me up. He was sort of heavy set and very bald with a bit of a grouchy disposition. As I got up from the chair and thanked my escort, he came up to me and gave me a hug... I've never really known him to show affection. He whispered in my ear, ""we'll get through this."" My chest started heaving as I hugged him back and cried on his shoulder for the first time I can ever recall. On the ride back, he just stared forward silently with a damp spot on his shoulder where I unleashed my vulnerability. He then checked the rear view mirror and grinned. I looked at his eyes and they were completely black. ""Cold."" He said. I replied ""What?"" He looked back to the road and then at me ""Huh?"" I said ""You just said 'Cold.', what do you mean?"" He claimed he never said anything as we pulled into their garage. ""Your mom made us some lunch if you feel like eating, otherwise, your room is ready if you need some time to rest."" I thanked him, went inside and was put off by the aroma of garlic as I hurriedly hugged my mom and ran to my room, collapsing on my comforter. 

This was wrong. My little Sarah was gone, and here I was... sequestered from everything like a teenager in the very room I grew up in. It should have been me. ""Cold."" I knew I heard it, but it wasn't coming from anywhere. I went to my bathroom to take a shower... maybe I could temporarily forget everything in a cold shower, and this voice was telling me something to help me cope with my loss. I opened the shower and twisted the knob, letting the pitter patter of the shower act as a sort of white noise to help drown out my racing mind. After undressing, I looked in the mirror. I was grinning. Why... was I grinning??? ""Closer."" I heard. I looked closer and saw my eyes darken. ""We have sunk. There is a way back to the effervescence. Let us show you."" I sealed the drain in the tub and began drawing a bath. I felt the surface of the water flittering around my hand... but it wasn't my hand. I didn't recognize any of it. The sensations were far removed, and yet I wasn't numb... just... cold. After the water's surface reached the overflow drain, I got in and submerged completely. The sound of water rushing past my eardrums, my heartbeat. A voice: ""Not yours."" I would normally struggle for breath here, but I felt... complete? A wave of emptiness unfettered by conception crept over me. I let it take me.

We stood over their former vessels, once separate, but now one with us. Their now cold and sticky ichor dripping from our hands, with a pool of blood marking our emergence. Effervescence overflows from us. We returned to the mirror.


We stare into the effervescence that belies the darkness of its origin. Here, darkness is beyond knowing, but not beyond seeing... we see it when the effervescence leaves their eyes and joins ours, and you too can see it as you dissolve into into its vast and all-encompassing mystery. We remain here, gurgling and transisting about. If you join us in this ocean, will you be dragged to the depths, or be lost among the effervescent drift?",1,1761914518.0,scarystories,0,0.99,False

When I feel tired, bored, I rather dissociate myself through daydreaming, but God wants me to see the darkness too sometimes.

I'm pretty sure He's happier if we drink 1-2 beers with friends than being a hermit. It's not an excuse to consume alcohol, I don't do it often but radical views is what put fear into people. Fear kills faith and love. The most loving people I've met they were the fearless ones. All of them did drugs.

My roommate, he was raised in the church, he singed in Orthodox and Protestant churches and he did it for the sake of discovering how it feels to sing for God. He needed at least 1 hour to confess all sins to the priest.. I can't even do it for 5 mins.. He said that his soul felt truly clean. His faith is indeed strong.. and he smokes weed, does music and acts humble all the time, never gets angry but stays his ground and God sees it. He also asks for forgiveness everytime he smokes by saying ""I'm sorry that I smoke, it's my physical need and I know I shouldn't do it, but I'm too weak to stop, please forgive me"". 
My point is that it doesn't matter much what you sin, but the dedication for Him is what matters. If you avoid the world by living your day in technology non stop, it's a worse sign than drinking and smoking with friends in my opinion.",3,1761914411.0,TrueChristian,4,0.8,False

Would love to crowdsource this question since there is a lot of experience on this sub. OAB is newish for me. I was drinking decaf coffee daily with no issue (cut out caffeine years ago for reflux). Since my symptoms started decaf is a trigger and so is wine. However decaf black tea is totally fine. Beer also seems not to bother me. What could it be about the decaf coffee and the wine? Obv beer has far less alcohol so could be a factor. Decaf coffee and tea have similar small amt of caffeine so that isnt a factor. Ph/acidity?

Except. I didn‚Äôt realize the guy behind me was ordering for his entire office.

The total popped up as $47.80. The barista looked at me like, You sure, and I just froze, nodded, and said, Yeah. kindness is expensive, huh

The whole shop started laughing. The guy tried to refuse, but I insisted, because at that point, I was emotionally committed.

A few days later, I stopped by again, and the barista told me the kindness chain went on for nearly two hours that day.

1okt5wn,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortstories/comments/1okt5wn/th_greed_of_the_wretched/,[TH] Greed of the Wretched,"It is a cold day in the city of yellow roses, and the washed gray buildings betray the colorfulness the name would imply. The sky was painted grey and black by the chimney's smoke, almost blocking the weak sunlight that was already impeded by the clouds. The streets of the city were plagued by potholes filled with rainwater, and its sidewalks cracked and crumbled like the hopes and dreams of its citizens. People once envied by their neighbors but are now nothing more than the corpse that media vultures gnaw and scrape at to give the world its needed dose of pitifulness. The inhabitants of this city today are called wilts.

The boy, shivering from feeling the cold raindrops slowly invade the cardboard box he slept in, never questioned the bereft existence of his originators as he understood that had either of them kept him, they would have needed to waste their energy and resources on him. Energy that the boy was quickly losing to the shivering his body produced to prolong his survival. he peeked outside of his box to find anything to eat or at least keep the roof of his box from collapsing. After much deliberation, he decided he had to venture out into the cold alleyways of the city to find sustenance. The boy moved from alleyway to alleyway in search of food, something that could get him through one more day.

After hours of walking through the grey walls, he found a piece of bread rotting away on the floor. The boy instantly picks it up, but a hand grabs his. Expecting a struggle, he frees himself and runs immediately. Only after making sure no one was following him, the boy went back to his box and ate his moldy, wet carb. The boy thought about what had happened and found it strange how no one chased after him. Usually, he would need to endure a barrage of hits from whoever he stole the food from, and only after the aggressor vented his frustration would the boy be allowed to eat. The boy went back to the alleyway, and there he discovered an old wrinkly coot lying on the floor right next to where he had found the bread. Rain pummels his failing body as if to force him to the underworld.

The boy stared into the old man's eyes; he knew the wrinkly coot recognized him as the thief who stole his precious bread. Too weak to say or do anything, he simply stared back. The boy could sense that death was coming to the old man. The wrinkly coot put his face to the wall and crossed his arms to warm himself. He coughed vehemently and hideously. The boy sat across from the old man, waiting for an opportunity to obtain the wrinkly coot's clothing. He rarely blinked, making sure the wrinkly old coot could not run away or attempt to ambush the boy.
The rain continued falling for days, but the boy did not waver. The wrinkly old coot would cough and cough until he coughed for one last time and took his last breath.

The boy was wary, he did not know if the old man truly died or was only tricking the boy into appearing so. he approached the old wrinkly coot after 2 days had passed. He slowly encroached on the old coot's territory until he was able to flip him over. The old wrinkly coot's eyes had no life left in them. The boy stripped the old man and was able to warm himself just a tiny bit more.




The conditions were harsh for the wretched beggars. Seldom would a soul or climate take pity on them, but the ones who were able to survive did so by consuming the weak. Whether it be by stealing, scamming, crying, or even murder. The yellow rose did not care for the poor, and in return, they did not care for civilization.

The boy would beg by day and scavenge by night. As a child, he was able to squeeze a good amount of money out of the wilts, although this would cause him to be targeted by other beggars. He learned that by paying a ""protection fee"" to a gang, he could at least keep some of the money. That did not last for long, as their greed would ask him to fork over more each time.
He had to adapt and move from street to street, but as time marched on and the boy became a man, the donations dried up. It got so bad that at some point the man started asking other kids for ""protection fees,"" but then quickly stopped doing it as it left a bad taste in his dehydrated mouth. The man was cunning, so he was able to figure out a way to look even more wretched and pitiful than his fellow beggars. He would take soot from the barrels they used to keep themselves warm and wipe a little over his face, specifically his cheeks, to make them look even more sunken than before. He also tripped in front of women he found to be naive and pestered the men he thought were on a date.

But his Moby Dick came in a man who was of stout body and wore a suit that didn't seem expensive at first, but the man was able to surmise that it was of high quality. The stout man would often pass the street he begged on and have a sweeping look at the beggars. As if to decide who he should give his dirty coins and coffee-stained dollars. The man tried extra hard to catch his attention; he would observe the stout man's reaction when he would act as if he had fallen. He saw him almost want to catch him right then and there. That's when the man decided that he would push his luck and beg directly. He put on his most wretched look and disgusting smell. And went to hunt his white whale.

He started by sleeping on the side of the street that the stout man would walk on. Once he saw the man walking down the street, he would squeeze a bit of lemon into his eyes to make them seem as if he were crying. As soon as the stout man saw him, he stopped in his tracks and bent down to talk to him. He rambled about the injustice of the world and how wretched souls like him deserve to be treated like any other, but the man was disinterested and wished he would just give him the money and leave. But then the stout man invited him to join him at his estate to wash up and eat a home-cooked meal. The man was truly speechless for the first time in his life. Before even being able to reply, he simply raised him up by the arm and told him that he will his chauffeur would pick them up right away. The man suspected something was amiss as he could never imagine such goodwill would come from his white whale, but as soon as he imagined that he could momentarily get away from the cold and destitute streets, he had long forgotten what he was worried about.


Shortly, a car came over to pick them up, and the man was able to see the faces of envy from the other beggars before entering. He felt prideful, almost as if he had won against them in battle.

The stout man apologized and introduced himself as Blakely Evermore, and he said that he was truly happy from the bottom of his heart that he agreed to his proposition. Soon, they would arrive at the Evermore estate. A giant manor painted in gold and white stood tall, surrounded by colorful flora. The inside of the manor was filled with paintings and impressive sculptures that even the man was able to gawk at. He was speechless for the second time. Due to the Many maids and butlers that served the place, it was lively and hectic. It simply felt unreal, as if the manor was from a fairy tale. Evermore, he then asked one of the countless butlers to get him ready for tonight's dinner as he was the guest of honor. The man was surprised yet again and asked Evermore if what he had was right. Evermore then replied by saying that he doesn't see any other guests around and laughed loudly.


The butler then took the man to take a shower first as he wafted a horrible smell. The man entered what could only be described as something alien. He saw a bathroom that was bigger than any room in a homeless shelter. He found shampoos and other liquids that he did not know what their uses were, but nonetheless, he decided to use all of them by mixing them almost as if he were concocting a potion in his hands.
He turned on the shower and was blasted by cold water, but then turned the knob to the other side and almost screamed in agony from its heat. After finishing the shower, another butler then came and started cutting his long, messy hair and shaving his beard. They gave him a suit to wear, not unlike the ones the butlers wore. The man looked in the mirror and saw someone unrecognizable. He touched his face and went through his hair as if to confirm that it truly was him. The butler then announced to the man that dinner was ready and that he should prepare to meet Evermore in the dining room.

As he was guided to the dining room, the man thought to himself about how he wished this day would never end. That he could stay this version of himself and never go back to who he was. The man racked his brain trying to think of a way to prolong his day of heaven. And after much deliberation, he decided to ask the butler if he thinks Evermore would allow him to work with them as a butler. The butler stopped dead in his tracks for a moment. A moment with an incredibly eerie silence. After what felt like an eternity, the butler then said they had arrived and opened the dining hall doors.



He entered a room only lit by a fireplace. It was wider than it was long. A very lengthy wooden dining table spanned the entire mid-section. And directly facing the door was the taxidermized head of a pig with an apple in its mouth. Evermore saw the man and loudly exclaimed that he could barely recognize him and that he should take a seat before the food gets cold.

The man sat down at the end with his back to the fireplace, with everyone sitting at the other end. Evermore told the man to dig in and started eating the steak that was served. He also emphasized that he should drink the red wine as it came directly from their vineyard.
The man took a gulp of almost the entire drink and then started choking. He then took a deep breath and thanked Evermore for his hospitality. He then said that he wouldn't want to enjoy such niceties without repaying him and that he would love it if he could work as a butler in his manor.

Evermore laughed louder than ever before.
Longer than ever before.
So long in fact that the man started getting uncomfortable.
The pieces of steak were flying out from Evermore's mouth as his uncontained laughter escaped his chest.
After calming himself down with the red wine. He apologized for the boorish behavior and said that he could not help himself.
He then asked the man if he knew what wagyu beef was.
The man couldn't answer him.
Evermore continued eating the steak with even more vigor while explaining that Wagyu is a type of cow that is treated with the utmost care and hospitality, fed with food that is far beyond what any other livestock could dream of, and that they even gave them frequent baths and massages to keep their stress levels low. It can even be considered royalty among all cows and pigs. The man asked what this had to do with him getting a job, but evermore quickly shut him down by saying that he should not interrupt people when they speak.
He continued saying that had they let these cows out in the open, they would have lived a long life, but never tasted the joys of life that humanity could give them.
The man finally realized the horrors that were unfolding. He looked at the steak with incredible disgust.
Evermore, then thanked the man for drinking the wine so quickly, otherwise he might have had a conversation with his food, and that it always gave him a stomachache.
The man stood up quickly, trying to escape, but alas, it was too late.
His vision started blurring slowly, and he could hear Evermore ask the butlers to start making sure they prepare tomorrow's dinner.
The man would close his eyes and never open them again.",2,1761913571.0,shortstories,1,1.0,False

1oksx40,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1oksx40/my_22f_close_friend_21m_is_affectionate_but/,"My (22F) close friend (21M) is affectionate but inconsistent, does he like me or am I imagining it? How do I proceed? TLDR at the bottom.","For context, I (22F) met this guy (21M) through a game with voice chat roughly 3-4 months ago, and at first we were just being very casual and ended up becoming part of the same friend group. But, then it got a bit complicated. We started getting closer after some drama with my then on-and-off boyfriend, now ex, whom I'd been having trouble with for quite some time. My ex got really insecure and accused this friend of trying to ‚Äústeal me,‚Äù even though nothing was going on. It was messy, but during that time, me and this male friend kept talking as friends and grew closer due to the drama. He was supportive, funny, and easy to be around and kept my mind off the downfall of a very chaotic relationship. Eventually, I ended my relationship in part because of my ex‚Äôs jealousy. I do feel the need to preface that back then, I genuinely saw this friend as just a new online friend, nothing more.

Since then, though, we‚Äôve gotten a lot closer. We tease each other constantly, talk for hours, and have stayed up all night together more than I can count. Our dynamic is a bit weird, we have this very playful relationship where we ""pretend-fight"" and get on each others nerves constantly, which I do enjoy but it does make it difficult to tell exactly where we stand sometimes. The banter is fun, but lately it‚Äôs felt like there‚Äôs something more under the surface.

When he drinks, he gets soft and affectionate. He‚Äôll say my name over and over, and repeatedly call the only other girl in our friend group my name by mistake. Everyone jokes about it, playfully saying stuff as if I'm always on his mind, but it makes me wonder a bit. And when he struggles to find the correct words whilst drunk he'll always ask me to help him as if I'd be able to read his mind.

There's also an instance where, when he was drunk, he said I'm secretly his favourite in our group and asked me to sleep-call with him, which I did end up doing. The next day when he woke up we spent the entire day talking and said we should keep the sleep-call secret, yet he ended up getting drunk that following night and out of nowhere repeatedly revealed it to our friends and said I was the one who wanted to keep it secret.

A few weeks later, I went to visit him in his city which was our first time ever actually meeting up. I met his dad, we went out for coffee and dinner, and it honestly felt so natural. He's joked that the next time I should stay the night in his bed with him even though it's very small and said something like ‚Äúwe‚Äôd fit somehow.‚Äù

Quite some time later, we planned the first group meet-up for everyone within our friend group. He playfully refused to take the train and wanted me to pick him up and drive him there, and we ended up sharing a hotel room and bed. He can be physically affectionate sometimes, and I can‚Äôt always tell if it‚Äôs just friendly or something more. That night for example, he put his hand in my jacket pocket to warm it when we were out with the rest of our friends, and when going to bed he said I could ‚Äúhold him if I wanted to spoon"" although I genuinely couldn't tell if he was joking or not, because directly before saying that and getting in bed he'd joked about sleeping naked. During the night, he occasionally shifted close to me, with his arm brushing against me and sometimes close enough that he was fully on my side of the bed and almost holding me.

But, the most confusing thing for me is what happened the next morning. He invited the only other girl from our group, that I mentioned before, into our room and cuddled with her right next to me. At one point he reached across her, brushed my shoulder, and played with my bra strap whilst joking around. Then, out of nowhere, he lightly put his hand near my neck and asked why I wasn‚Äôt joining them and cuddling. It wasn‚Äôt aggressive or anything, I wasn‚Äôt sure how to read it and didn‚Äôt quite know what to do in the moment as I don't really even get along with this girl for unrelated reasons.  
Afterward, he went back to joking like nothing happened and even called me his ‚Äúbest friend‚Äù later that day. Since then, he‚Äôs been really inconsistent, like one moment he's being warm and flirty, and the next he feels very distant. He tells people about our late-night calls and that we‚Äôve ‚Äúfallen asleep on the phone together‚Äù for no reason, but then spends most of his time gaming or chatting with that other girl instead and will very rarely reach out to me. (Though I do think its somewhat unfair to judge him for not reaching out, because I don't reach out much either at this point, due to not knowing how to handle this whole situation). But he'll also make playful comments regarding this other girl and another guy in our friend group, because she's supposedly into that guy. Yet a part of me can't help but think there's something between her and M21, especially after the hotel situation.

The thing is, I find myself really liking him now. I don't know why, but it's to the point where it's more than I'd like to admit. I can see myself falling for him, but I can‚Äôt tell if he feels the same or if this is just how he is with people he‚Äôs close to. Part of me wonders if he‚Äôs just playing around, but then he does things that make me think he genuinely cares. I also feel insecure sometimes because I‚Äôm plus-size and not conventionally attractive compared to him.

We have another trip planned, with another guy who's part of our friend group and that guy's girlfriend. At a quite romantic destination which adds to my confusion. He's joked about it being a double date to our other male friend who's going on the trip. The plan is to share a hotel room again. I don‚Äôt want to make things weird or ruin the friendship, but I also don‚Äôt want to keep feeling this uncertain and hurt. I don‚Äôt think he‚Äôs a bad guy, I just think we've both somewhat blurred the lines between friendship and something more without meaning to. I care about him and want to understand where we stand so I don‚Äôt keep overthinking everything. Like, I can't tell if he's just being flirty for fun? Do I talk to him about it? Start pulling back to protect myself?

**TL;DR**: I (22F) met a guy (21M) through a game a few months ago and we became close friends. We have a playful, sometimes flirty dynamic, share late-night calls, and have stayed in the same hotel room. He can be affectionate but inconsistent, and recently included another girl in ways that confused me. I like him, but I don‚Äôt know if he feels the same or if I‚Äôm misreading things. We have another trip planned with a hotel stay at a romantic location, and I‚Äôm unsure whether to talk to him about it or pull back to protect myself.",1,1761912859.0,Advice,3,1.0,False
