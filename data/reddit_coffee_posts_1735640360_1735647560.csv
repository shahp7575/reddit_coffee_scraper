I’ve been weighing out 18g of beans but no matter what I do to the grinders, I cannot get more than 12-16g of espresso out. I barely touched the tamper to the coffee this am and got 12g. The pressure is good, the flow starts as it should, there’s even a pretty nice crema. It runs for about 30seconds but all I have to show for it is the 12g. 

Based off a seemingly good article I changed the internal grinder to 1 and have the external up at 10. I’m using local roasted fresh beans.",1,1735647450.0,espresso,1,1.0,False
1hqdjtw,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1hqdjtw,Zyn review.,"This is a coffee flavored zyn rated strong. 

If you've never tried nicotine then be prepared to vomit.
 
If you've tried nicotine and have built some kind of tolerance then this doesn't give you the kind of kick everybody says it does. I'm sure you have to be a regular user to get that effect. But if this is your first time you will feel nauseating, but just a little bit. 

The taste is coffee so putting that aside I'd say the tingly sensation you'll feel is the same as that of cinnamon. It's spicy and hurts a wee bit. When the saliva takes the content inside one of these pouches to your tongue, you'll for sure get reminded of that time you had cinnamon. 

Now the question begs: Will this remove the smoking addiction? Not sure, maybe it's more likely to change your addiction from cigarettes to zyn when you start to feel the kick. But if you're like me that smokes maybe once a while and don't find the fun in it, you'll probably dislike frequent uses of this. It surely is great if you dont want the aftermath of smoke scent on you all the time. But perhaps I don't really understand the nicotine addiction. 

There are two types of flavor that I'm aware of: coffee and apple. 

Should you try it? Depends upon your system and how well you handle nicotine, weed and alcohol. All comes down to tolerance I suppose. If you're all about flavour then have fun with trying stuff. 

Do I recommend it? I'm not sure as I went through all the tolerance and your preferences. But as I say often, even if you're healthy your entire life or sick, you will die one day and no one will give a fuck. It's like finishing an open world game like rdr and rdr2, you'll realize that you've missed so many hidden details and Easter eggs and treasure hunting. This doesn't mean that you should go jump off a cliff because you'll die anyways but more like,"" I tried that and that so and so."" There is a high chance you'll get addicted but honestly you can get professional help and realize who you are and what you want to be as a person. You can have a perfect job, career and marriage but still try stuff and not effect your life. For me realization is what's keeping me away from addiction. In conclusion I don't recommend it because I don't know you. But never forget to have some good time. Have a great day! ",1,1735647395.0,NepalSocial,1,1.0,False
1hqdjki,https://www.reddit.com/r/pourover/comments/1hqdjki/hario_switch_recipe_tuning/,Hario switch recipe tuning,"Hey, I'm still trying to figure out my Hario Switch which I got in Christmas. My today's cup was my best yet but it still wasn't what I consider to be incredible cup.   
  
So the recipe I'm following for now, is famous Coffee Chronicler with changes for sweeter cup. I grinded 20G of coffee. I utilized tap water double filtered through Brita filter, and unfortunately I don't have gooseneck kettle but more traditional electric one. Having opened valve and using 93°C water I poured the first 160g of water within 20 seconds so that I can close the valve at the 25 seconds mark. Before closing but after finishing this pour I did a small swirl for higher agitation. Then at 30 seconds mark I started pouring the rest of my water. I think I poured a little bit too fast and aggressively ending this pour at about 50 seconds. At around 1 minute and 10 seconds I added more agitation by mixing with the spoon the content of the switch. I opened the valve at 2 minutes mark finish the brew at 3 minutes.  
  
The resulting cup was quite sweet with little acidity and light body. Overally pleasant for my liking. But at times it was a little bit too harsh and bitter? Even quite burnt tasting. Is this just what to be expected from the switch due to the immersion step that there always be some kind of bitterness? Or should I try less agitation, cooler water maybe 91°C or to grind coarser?  
  
Ngl today I added more agitation and grinded one click finer than yesterday since I felt like my cup was a little hollow but acidic/bitter at the same time, but maybe I still don't understand some basic concept of pour overs. Even though I've been using V60 for two years I still feel like I don't understand some basic concept and my cups often miss the mark.

I'd really like to make it a mega secure bed that she can launch off to her hearts content. I've considered just super glueing the cardboard but the matt would still slip on it, and also maybe sewing some string to the corners of the matt and tying it, but I think there'd still be some slippage.

From a sturdy pair of hiking boots and a reliable backpack to warm layers and a comfortable sleeping bag, ensure you have everything you need to tackle the varying conditions along the trail.
4. **Travel Insurance and Permits**: Obtain comprehensive travel insurance that covers trekking activities, emergency evacuations, and medical expenses. Additionally, make sure to secure the necessary permits and documentation required for the Annapurna Circuit trek, as regulations may change by 2025.

# Permits and Regulations for Annapurna Circuit Trekking in 2025

Trekking in Nepal requires obtaining the necessary permits and adhering to local regulations to ensure a safe and responsible experience. As regulations may evolve by 2025, it's crucial to stay informed and comply with the latest requirements.

1. **Trekking Permits**:

   * Additional permits, such as the Trekkers' Information Management System (TIMS) card, may also be required.
2. **Restricted Areas**:
   * Certain areas along the Annapurna Circuit may be designated as restricted or off-limits for environmental or cultural reasons.
   * It's crucial to respect these restrictions and follow the guidelines provided by local authorities and park officials.
3. **Environmental Regulations**:
   * As Nepal continues to prioritize sustainable tourism, expect stricter regulations regarding waste management, campfire restrictions, and minimizing environmental impact.
   * Be prepared to follow Leave No Trace principles and carry out any non-biodegradable waste from the trek.
4. **Cultural Sensitivity**:
   * Respect local customs and traditions, especially when visiting sacred sites or interacting with local communities.
   * Dress modestly and seek permission before photographing individuals or cultural events.
5. **Guide Requirements**:

Anyways 

My mom started working part time about five years ago. I always knew she was close to her boss. It started with ""I'm getting coffee with him after work"", ""I'm getting dinner with him"" and I didn't mind it because I would go to lunch/dinner with my colleagues of the opposite sex as well. 

I don't really remember when things took a turn. 

Here and there she would mention stuff that made me raise an eyebrow, but never to the point where I would accuse her of cheating on my dad. 

""He said I'm the best employee out of all the workers""

""I'm going on a drive with him tomorrow"" (She left at 9am and came back home at 9pm)

The thing that confused me the most was how she would tell me these things. If she had a sexual relationship with her boss, would she really tell me, her daughter, ""I got this from him as a Christmas gift""? Christmas, Birthday, Valentine's....You name it. 

I was back home for the holidays, so even though I was really scared, I went through her phone. 

""I love you"" 

""Can I see you tonight"" 

""Tell them you have a younger boyfriend"" (my dad is 6 years older lol) 

It's kind of weird because I don't really care if she's cheating on my dad. I just need prove, confirmation that they have something inappropriate going on and that I'm not overthinking this whole thing.

It was a few days until I properly unwrapped the item, which arrived by a private courier. 

Upon getting ready to set it up, I noticed a large manufacturing defect. A quite wide 10mm~ by 15mm~ high and about 40mm deep cut on one of the sides. This side was supposed to be ""live edge"", so it should appear natural and free from tool marks, etc. 

It's visible enough to be annoying, like really annoying. My eyes are drawn to it and the 3 visitors I've had since I put it in the room all asked the same thing ""what's this hole?"". 

It was relatively pricey at £400, so I wanted it to fill me with joy, rather than look at this defect and feel annoyed, also I didn't want house guests to pick up on the fault. 

It turns out it's from a circular saw, when the seller cut a piece off a larger piece. This wasn't mentioned in the product listing, it was barely noticeable in the images due to the angles and in the images you'd only really see it if you knew to look for it. 

The seller tried telling me it makes it look unique, but I wanted a natural item, not something with a random, deep tool cut on the side. Unique is grains, splits and other natural stuff, defects are caused by tools and workmanship, etc. 

I said I wanted to return it, they then offered me a discount, which is no good to me, as I'd be stuck with the same problem and still be out of pocket. At this stage I'd rather just get my money back and buy from a reputable retailer to avoid this shit in the future. 

Initially, after I asked to return it, I got silence. It was Xmas though and I didn't want to be a dick and ruin someone's Xmas. 

A couple of days after Xmas I opened a Help request with the seller, at this stage it's just the seller and me, I haven't escalated it. 

The seller informs me they're out of the country until mid Jan. I've had to put this item out of the way, so it doesn't get scratched or anything, but now I have nowhere to put my brews 😭. 2 weeks is ages to wait. I don't really wanna shell out on a replacement until this has gone. 

It's been about 4 days since I spoke to the seller, they're supposedly arranging collection, at some point. I'm unsure if this is going to be after they arrive back and how much longer I'd have to wait. 

What do I do here? Do I escalate to Etsy and expedite the process? I mean if they're out of the country, I'm guessing it can't be collected any time soon, so I'm still responsible for this thing.

How does tracking even work with a private courier? I had to sign on delivery, how would I prove to Etsy/PayPal/bank that it had been collected by their designated courier? I mean I have cameras and stuff, but it's a little more ropey than a guy getting out a big DHL van, wearing a DHL uniform and actually scanning a barcode on my doorstep. 

It's all a shame as the item would have been pretty great without the defect, I definitely wouldn't have bought it had it said ""random deep cut on the side edge"" ",0,1735645387.0,AskUK,2,0.5,False

1. Situation- I've got a job I always wanted to do. So I am psychologist graduate and the only job I truly wanted to do was clinical psychology. Nothing else. I knew this in my gut. I always wanted to work with mental illness and idk why I just have strong feelings that I want to help people who suffer from severe mental illness. I always sense that this was my ,,true calling"". Since I was like 12 year old! I saw myself in white coat walking through hospital halls etc. I didnt intentionally thought about it I just knew. But this job is really hard to get in my country and only few psychologist majors work in hospital. When I just finished degree and people ask me what you want to do, I would always say whatever oportunity came; I didnt run from working in HR, schools etc, but I would always think clinical psychology is something I actually want. I applied for many jobs and with some circumstances I ended up working in psychiatry. I will start soon and I am excited and scared in same time so wish me luck!!

2. Situation my toxic ex from 7-8 years ago got married. This is ex with whom I really did have very very messy breakup and toxic relationship. I thought that he is incompetent to ever get married because he really is awful person. I didnt thought about him for years, but idk why in last couple if months I wondered did he marry after all these years. Aprox 1 month ago I was on coffee with my friend and I we opened up to each other about past etc and I mention that my ex, and I literally said *,,I really want him to get marry because I want to see who is he married with. I am really wondering did he*. And idk whyy but few days ago I just had urge out od nowhere to stalk him on social media and I saw he did get married in August this year. Btw I dont miss this ex nor I have any feelings I was just curious. Was this intuition?

3. I manifested my soulmate and manifested our breakup. 
4 years ago in my diary I wrote things literally like points what I want my SP to be like. And I met SP with whom i had amazing relationship with and she literally had all qualities I want in person. But ofc we have downs also and some problems. We were together for 3 years.
However this summer I started to feel something is off in my guts. I felt some weird depression but its like I couldn point finger why. And then my SP broke up with me and I am not sure did I unintentionally manifested our breakup due to this negative energy or I had intuition I wasnt aware about, that breakup will come?

They broke up over a year and a half ago after being together for 4.5 years. We’ve been dating since February 2024.

Here’s the problem: I feel like I know way more about his ex than I ever wanted to. I never really asked about her, but his family and friends keep bringing her up. From what I know, she was physically abusive and toxic (which his sister and friends witnessed firsthand), but for some reason, they keep talking about her.

Whenever I’m out with him and his friends, if I leave to go to the restroom, I come back to find them discussing her. They even mention her name in passing during casual conversations. She even went over to my boyfriend’s place for coffee randomly (while we were out together), and his mom still writes her heartfelt birthday messages about how she wishes her to be loved 🙃 … his sister still goes to her regularly for nails (she doesn’t have a nail business), even though she literally abused her brother… 

My boyfriend doesn’t like it either and has told them to stop bringing her up so much, but they don’t seem to listen. What makes it more confusing is that they never speak of her negatively—it’s always neutral, which makes it even weirder.

No one of them was ever rude to me or anything.. I’m an introvert, so I take time to warm up to people, so they just call me quiet. Despite that, I can’t shake this uncomfortable feeling like her shadow is looming over everything.

I (24F) live in Bengaluru and work as a software developer. I share a 2BHK apartment with my roommate, Aisha (25F). We’ve been living together for three years, and things have been fine overall.

Six months ago, Aisha started dating her boyfriend, Rohan (26M). At first, he was visiting occasionally, but lately, he’s been at our place four or five nights a week. It feels like he’s unofficially moved in. He uses my things without asking (like my coffee maker), takes over the living room, and just generally makes himself at home in a way that I find uncomfortable.

Last week, Aisha asked if Rohan could officially move in to help split the rent. I said no. While it would help with rent, I’m just not comfortable living with him full-time. I feel that it’s important to have some boundaries in our shared space, and I don’t want to be in a situation where I’m living with someone I’m not fully comfortable with.

Aisha says I’m overreacting and that I’m making a big deal out of nothing. Rohan has said I’m “being paranoid” and that I need to “chill out.” Now the atmosphere at home is really tense, and I’m starting to wonder if I’m being unreasonable.

AITA for setting this boundary, or am I overreacting?

Let’s start with my daily grind: waking up half-asleep, chugging lukewarm coffee, and prepping for a class only to have my student cancel 19 whole minutes before we start. Wow, what a gift! It’s like opening a present and finding a gaping hole in my wallet instead. $2 for my troubles? Cambly, please, don’t bankrupt yourselves on my behalf. I’ll try not to spend it all in one place! 😂

But don’t worry, it’s not all bad. I had an emotional reunion today with a student who hasn’t booked since dinosaurs roamed the earth. She’s been waiting four years for me to return—FOUR YEARS. Kept the app on her phone like I’m some sort of tutoring messiah. Honestly, who needs a therapist when I have this validation?

Now, on to the real problem: ghosting. Six no-shows in one day, people. Six. My slots? Wasted. My pay? Laughable. My patience? Nonexistent. So, I’ve done the only logical thing: added a Booking Behavior Manifesto to my profile in multiple languages because the world needs to know how to respect my time. If Google Translate makes me sound like a dictator, so be it. I’m running a tight ship here.

Here’s a pro tip for everyone: if you book a class, show up. If you don’t, at least pay me for my wasted time because I’m not running a charity. I don’t care if it’s your first time or your last—my time is sacred, and I will rant about it here.

","**Originally posted to** r/coffee **but the Mods deleted for unknown reasons... Thought it was a good topic to discuss but apparently not. Anyway!**  
  
For a lack of better title - hope after I explain this it all make sense. It is something I have been thinking for a while.

I believe that most of us go, if not often, at least have been to specialty coffee shops, and had supposedly nice coffee brewed by people that knew what they were doing. I am one of those - but 99% of the time, I am drinking my own coffee, that I brew myself in many ways and forms (mainly black, filtered, but anyway)

Most of my experience with specialty shops have been nice but tea-like coffees, which I like but they are totally different from what I brew at home. Better? Worse? not sure.

When drinking on a specialty coffee shop, sometimes I do think I have a lot of bias, and I might interpret things that were either bad or not specially unique, as something ""exquisite"" and to be appreciate.

When I drink at home, my coffee is usually more full body, although I do fine tune it to bring the florals/fruit notes true - as well as elevate the acidity, yada yada, yada. But here is the catch:

I know that ""coffee is subjective, if you like it its good"" - but I think we all know that this can be a double edge sword, and actually cap your own coffee of being better.

I can, of course, maybe try to mimic the coffee that I had at coffee shops, but I can't help but find that I might be missing something when I do so, because at home, when I do a ""tea like"" brew, I tend to think of it as ""weak"" and that I'm leaving good stuff in the beans... maybe I'm being too harsh on myself, but anyway.

And now, this is where the ""Knowledge argument"" comes - because as most of you, I go then on crusades of reading, watching videos, trying to expand my palate, etc etc. And then brew again... and again. I will eventually find things that I enjoy more, or less, and adjust. **This is good.**

BUT! Back to the ""knowledge argument"" - there's this thing, that I always think, is: Where do I stand on the ""common bar/perception"", or ""where do I stand when evaluated by the book"" - not sure if I'm making myself clear here.

For those that don't know, the ""knowledge argument"" is a thought experiment, of a person that grows in a world of black and white, and she has access to all of the knowledge about what the ""color red"" is. The question is - having all the knowledge herself, will she knows what red is when she sees it?

I completely understand how ""heavy"" I'm taking this subject and one might argue that this might ""remove the joy"" - but don't get me wrong, I do enjoy my coffee even with those thoughts.

I just want to bring this up to see if its something we all share, and talk about ways to better situate ourselves as home brewers. It's ok to go back to our own ways of brewing - knowing what we like, but what can we do to test our knowledge vs what we produce?

Sometimes I think of finding a ""drinking buddy"" where we both brew for each other, explain what we are trying to achieve, and review each other's brew. Is it perfect? No. But I think this, would as much as ""tasting different fruits""/""cupping different coffees together"" would also elevate our understanding of how the perception of coffee differs from person to person, and know as well where your perception sits, when evaluated by other person.

I’ve owned the Ninja Luxe Cafe Coffee Espresso Maker for over a week now, and overall, I’ve been enjoying it. I’ve made plenty of espressos, and the cold drinks like iced lattes have turned out fantastic. The cold froth feature is also impressive!

However, I’m running into issues with hot lattes and cappuccinos when using the hot frothing options. While the machine steams the milk, the temperature just isn’t hot enough—not to my liking or even to what I’d consider the standard for these drinks.

Here’s what I’ve tried so far:
	1.	Adjusted the milk frothing temperature settings to high (I also tried medium and low) and changed the H number to 7. This is a hidden setting I found online—you can access it by pressing and holding the button next to the start brewing button, which is located directly under the coffee section.
	2.	Verified that the frothing wand is clean and free of residue.
	3.	Checked the manual thoroughly and watched multiple YouTube reviews.

Despite all this, the milk froth temperature remains lukewarm at best. I’ve also noticed similar complaints in reviews on Best Buy, so I’m wondering if this could be a common issue with the machine. However, none of the YouTube reviewers I’ve watched mentioned this problem.

At this point, I’m unsure if I have a defective unit or if I’ve missed something. I really like this machine, especially for iced lattes, which my family and I have been loving. I’d appreciate any tips or advice from anyone who has experienced this issue or knows a potential fix.

I keep my camping kitchen in the brain of the pack and to be as space-conscious as possible I have to make some adjustments.

Currently I have a 1500ml Toaks titanium pot for cooking water (we share usually 3-ways). Soto windmaster with built-in igniter and a 230g gas canister. 

The easy solution would be to put canister and burner into the pot, but both wont fit. Alone the canister is loose and rattles around. I have sometimes put a zip-lock with coffee ground inside, but this carries the risk of spoiling the coffee if the bag has any punctures and the pot remains wet after use. 

I don't carry freeze-dried meals, but usually have dry couscous and soy crumble. The meals are carried in a plastic bottle for easy access. Can't fit it into the pot. I have a Kupilka bowl for preparing the meal and eating (i was gifted this...) but will replace it with something lighter and foldable in the future. Doubt anything would still fit the inside pot anyways, maybe outside if anything.

1hqce93,https://www.reddit.com/r/LawyerAdvice/comments/1hqce93/rlawyeradvice/,r/lawyeradvice,"What would you tell your daughter to do? Please I need help. 

This time last year I was sitting in my home of 11 years. I was employed, married, and stable. What was to come in the next year would wreck every aspect of my life. As today, almost six months after my mother in law, an attorney who is very well respected did the unthinkable. Her son, my husband began abusing cocaine last February. Everything about him changed. He was already a challenge, but I tried. I was a good wife and I never displayed any aggression. Nothing that would ever warrant sending the police to my home. Using his mother’s power and influence as an attorney to try and have me arrested. Some backstory that is pertinent; my disabled sister was living with us, and paying a minimal amount of rent. She was hit by a car when she was young and had a stroke from the brain damage and swelling. She’s been through so much. 

One Friday this summer my sister and I were sitting and watching TV. My husband came home from his part time job at 8:00. What walked through our door was an agitated fool. He needed coke, or had just used, and he was raging. He immediately became confrontational with my sister. Even called her “gimp squatter”. I got between the two of them. I made my husband sit down and he grabbed both of my arms and threw me onto the coffee table. My sister saw everything. He called me a bunch of names and left for the night. 

He returned the next day and was obviously high. He was messing with my sister and then he said “I’m going to have you arrested Bitch”. It’s like he was delusional. He stayed with his sister who has many psych issues the night before . He actually got her involved in this. I still have all the text messages where he tells me exactly what he is going to do. He told his sister that I threatened her. She called him crying on speaker phone, right in front of us. She said “what do I do?” He said “call the police”. She said really? He said “I don’t know, call mom and tell her”. Then he started laughing and telling me that I was done. That they were coming for me. A few jminutes later he got a text message, and said “bitch be gone”! The police are coming for you!! Five minutes later three police officers showed up. They were informed of MY psych history that wasn’t even true. They split us all up. I was separated from my physically and cognitively disabled sister. She was terrified. The police made him leave. They felt pretty dumb when my sister and I told the same story. They pulled us out of our condo and did this in front of all of our neighbors. It was so embarrassing. I felt so betrayed by my mother in law. She knows the shenanigans that her kids are involved with. I called the police back out that same evening to report the battery. I have a PO in affect, and I am currently in dissolution of marriage proceedings. I have been staying with different family members. My husband stopped providing any financial support. I have been diagnosed with PTSD. I shook for two months. I became paranoid and thought that they could control the police. I was so scared. I guess paranoia is part of PTSD. I have had to apply for food stamps. I get $292 a month. I had to quit my job because of location and the fact that I was so traumatized that I couldn’t focus on work. I had to apply for disability. My life has been miserable. 

My question is, how is this legal? It was a false claim, when in fact I was the person who was assaulted. This single call, event lead me to where I am today. I would have thought that she could have easily called me and asked me what was going on. I told her about the drug abuse. She used her power as an attorney to assist my husband in intentionally inflicting emotional distress. Is she culpable? What can I do? If my sister wasn’t involved I might not be as hurt. I also learned of real estate that she and my husband were trying to conceal from me. Fixed that situation in the dissolution of marriage proceedings.  Please advise me.

For context, I met my situationship 8 months ago, and we dated for 1 and a half of those before mutually splitting. We have only ever spoken online, but we live in the same country, just far apart. After two months of not speaking, he randomly reached out again, and for the last 4 months we've been in a grey area.

At my school, there is a guy whom I have some mutual attraction with. I am new to my school, and only have a few months left there. He's a gentleman, very polite, and respectful to a fault. After we admitted that there might be mutual interest in fooling around (as friends!) he asked me out on a coffee date.

When I told my situationship, however, he immediately grew jealous and defensive. He told me to tell the guy that I was taken, and when I asked him if that was true, he said: 'I'm not sure. It doesn't feel real. I want to see you in person.' While I am in love with him, and not with the guy from my school, I am unsure as to whether or not I should pursue other connections.

My options as of this time:

1. Tell the guy from my school that I am taken, and wait for the moment in which I can see my situationship in person (likely to be at university, or in 2025)
2. Go out on the date anyway, but don't fool around with the guy (we don't know each other very well).
3. Go out on the date and potentially fool around with the guy if the opportunity arises.

1hqc8zi,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortstories/comments/1hqc8zi/rf_single_mom/,[RF] Single Mom,"THANDILICIOUS CARTWRIGHT 30s, plain-looking, working-class mom, was on the side of the road, trying to change a tire. One of the lug nuts wasn't budging. She got up, wiped the sweat off her forehead, and called DEIGHTWAHN on her cell. No answer. No surprise.

Little MEMAFACE was sweating too. That’s Thandy’s 3-year-old daughter. She was in her car seat whining. 

“Almost, baby,” Thandy muttered, wiping the sweat off Mema’s little face with her sleeve. The toddler’s big eyes locked on hers.

“I know,” she whispered, then sighed. “You’re right.”

Deightwahn was supposed to take her car to the shop last week after he dropped her off at work. Instead, he picked Thandy up that day, and the AC was still broken. The car was on E. *She* paid for gas.

But now, she had to deal with the situation at hand.  She grabbed the lug wrench and pressed into it. Day Day wasn’t here, so she had to do this by herself. She stood, placed a foot on the wrench, and pressed down. The lugnut had to come off. It was just something that had to be done. She thought about all the times she was there for him, picking him up from random places, letting him borrow her car, cooking him dinner, buying him food. She even gave him a key to her apartment.

She thought about this as she stepped on the wrench with both feet, using all of her body weight to carefully bounce, all the while looking down at the scissor jack to make sure the car didn’t wobble off. She thought and realized that this was the last straw. Her friends would probably say this was 12 straws past the last one, but Thandy wasn’t counting with numbers like they were. This was a feeling for her. A generalization. If he couldn’t be there when she actually needed him, did she need him to be there at all? Did she actually need him?

Finally, she decided. She told herself it had to be done, but now she would do it. She stood on the ground, held the side of the car, and stomped down on the wrench, jerking The lug nut loose. 



When she arrived at her apartment, she momentarily forgot her resolution. She was excited to talk to Deightwan, to tell him she changed her first tire. After all, he was the one who taught her that “kick the shit out of the wrench” trick.

Thandy gathered the groceries from the trunk before wrestling with Mema’s car seat belt. The baby slept through it all. Even when Thandy trudged up the stairs, awkwardly balancing the child, the bags, and the keys, the toddler didn’t even stir. 

 At the top of the steps, Thandy used her knee to prop up her little, heavy girl, who sagged like a sack of potatoes. Thandy stopped, her hand moving as her fingers flipped through the keys to find the right one. Her key to the front door. The one with the pink rubber cap.

Once the door was open and the groceries were on the living room floor, Mema immediately woke up. She was lowered down and she began running to her toys with the energy provided from rest and lack of responsibility. 

Thandy straightened her back and took the door in her hand to close it. That’s when she noticed the broken chain latch. This wasn’t the first time she noticed this, in fact, she was there when DEIGHTWAHN broke it. That evening she had used it for extra security when she got home from work, something she used to do before he had his key. This was an action akin to feeling around on the wrong side of the wall to turn on the light when you first change apartments.

When Deightwahn showed up that night, he used his key but couldn’t get in. Thandy heard the door clunk, stopped by the weak chain, and then a laugh echoed from a distance—probably from whoever had dropped him off. He must have been embarrassed, because before she could even get from the bedroom to the living room to undo the latch, he popped the door open, snapping the chain in half.

The latch hadn’t provided much security anyway, and Deightwahn wasn’t remorseful. In fact, he seemed irritated. He asked her why she’d locked it like it was her fault. Thandy ended up apologizing to him. Something that seemed perfectly normal, until she had a few days to think about it. Now, looking at the broken chain, and what it represented, Thandy remembered why Deightwan had to leave.

She closed the door and let the groceries stay where they were for a minute. She’d go into her bedroom and he would probably be sleeping on her bed. Last time she called him and he didn’t pick up he was snoring with his phone right beside him.

 	She walked slowly as she advocated for the devil. Maybe this is a conversation she didn’t have to have. After all, it wasn’t all bad. There was that night he took her to one of his favorite spots and performed that poem. It was called “You.” When he was through she stood and clapped. He smiled as he looked at her, getting off stage before a girl from the front row jumped up. She embraced him emotionally as if the piece was meaningful to her for some reason. Thandy realized she had stopped clapping. She was pretty sure she knew the reason. It was because “You” is an obscure title. 

She asked him who the girl was. He didn’t dignify this. Instead, he told her that they had to “renegotiate their relationship.” When she backpeddled, he explained his disposition He told her he “loves being desirable but hates being desired.”

	Thandy put a hand on her bedroom door. Even the good times were complicated.

This was the end of the day. And here, Thandy knew she had to do what her friends and family said was best for her. So she put on a pleasant demeanor to ease the blow and walked in. He wasn’t there. 

	“Great,” she said aloud. Now she would have to wait and pump herself back up when he got home. She would have to go through this emotional rollercoaster ride again. Who knows how many memories she would encounter before now and then? There was a real chance that she would talk herself out of it before she saw him again. 

	When she went to put away the groceries she saw Mema playing with a key. A key with a blue rubber cap.

	“Where did you get that from, baby?” Thandy asked. The little girl pointed to the coffee table. There was a yellow sticky note that said “Thanks,” written–no drawn in a pretty cursive font complete with a drop shadow. She read it and looked toward the bedroom again. When she went in this time she opened her mirrored closet door and looked at the space where Day Day’s suitcase used to be. He was gone. No fanfare. No goodbye. Just a yellow square piece of paper.



	The rest of the month was a blur. Monday was Tuesday, or was it Thursday? There were no breaks in the monotony. No late-night visits. No calls to meet at some obscure location for a random event. She woke up. She drove to her job. She drove home. She slept. She woke up. She drove to her job. She drove home. She slept.

	One morning, Thandy got up and sat on the edge of the bed. She couldn’t move but she knew she had to get ready for work. She just stared at her vanity. She didn’t know why she still had the yellow sticky note. Sometimes she would just look at it and wonder why he thanked her. She wondered why the lettering was so carefully drawn. He could have used more words to explain in the time it took him to design this.

Thandy looked to the overflowing bin of dirty clothes in the corner. She cocked her head before getting up and reaching for a pair of boxers. For some reason, this article of clothing brought her to three emotions. First, she was happy, and last she was upset because in between those two, she was sad. And she got mad at herself for being sad. But she was. And as liquid welled up she refused to close her eyes. She refused to cry. She’d rather her eyeballs dry up and shrivel like raisins than cry.

	“What’s wrong Mommy?” Mema said, causing Thandy to blink rapidly, little splashes of guilt sprinkling her cheek.

	She let go of the boxers and wiped her tears. She started to get up, to get ready for work. She could escape Mema’s question if she kept busy. If she kept moving forward. But then, Thandy realized what today was. It was Saturday and she had nowhere to be. So she was stuck inside of her day off looking into the eyes of this little girl who still wanted an answer.

	“Nothing, it’s just,” she figured it didn’t matter if she said it or not, so, she just let go. “Mommy’s just lonely, baby. That’s all.”

	The little girl extended her arms and grabbed the air in front of her as if summoning her mom’s head. Thandy lowered to her and they hugged so tight that she could hear little Mema’s thoughts.

	*Don’t be lonely Mommy. You have me.*",1,1735641885.0,shortstories,1,1.0,False
1hqc7pu,https://www.reddit.com/r/diabetes_t2/comments/1hqc7pu/what_is_it_about_mornings/,What is it about mornings?,"So for the last week and a half I've been experiencing low blood sugar events a couple of hours after eating breakfast. My breakfasts aren't particularly low or high carb affairs. When I'm at home, I usually have a Jimmy Dean bacon, egg, and cheese croissant breakfast sandwich (26nc). Twice a week, I go to Starbucks in the morning, and sometimes I get breakfast there. When my low blood sugar problems started, it was on my first day switching from caffe mocha (no whip, whole milk, 46nc) to caffe misto (heavy cream, 0nc). Before I made that switch, I sometimes got the double-smoked bacon croissant sandwich (41nc), making the total net carbs 87).  Oddly, I didn't notice much affect on my BG according to my CGM.

That day that I switched, I had had my at-home breakfast sandwich, but my BG got down to about 50. Since this had never happened to me before, I was not prepared. I managed to have a chocolate chip cookie but it took forever to get back in normal range. Since then I've started carrying a juice pouch and peanut butter; I've had some lows almost every morning since then, but I haven't had any event as bad as that first time. 

Today, I had the caffe misto and the double-smoked bacon sandwich (which I still think of as having too many carbs), and my BG just floated along with no spike and just an ever so slight low. (The little coffee cup at around 10:30 shows when I finished the sandwich. )

In contrast, I find that just about anything I eat in the evening causes my BG to go up. So what is it about mornings? 

BTW, I'm sticking with the switch to caffe misto because I like it and it's cheaper than the mocha, but I'm not sure it was necessary for controlling BG.",2,1735641720.0,diabetes_t2,4,1.0,False

2024 is coming to a close, and boy am I ready to put this year behind me! Maybe you can be the person that makes me thankful it’s a new year. 

So, a bit about me. I am really introverted (INFP for those of you keeping score at home), but I’m told I don’t shut up once I’m comfortable with you. My love language is sharing music :) I love having deep conversations over coffee or tea. 

I love enjoy reading. History, (particularly U.S. and intellectual history), philosophy (I enjoy dabbling in existentialism in particular), and literature (Kafka, Chekhov, Milan Kundera, and Raymond Carver are among my favorite writers). I love film, especially foreign film and films that are a bit more cerebral or absurd. Wes Anderson, Charlie Kauffman, the Coen brothers, and Ingmar Bergman are among my favorites. I often find meaning in music. Cloud Cult has been especially comforting for me this year. I also love Bright Eyes, the National, Okkervil River, and Leonard Cohen—to name a few. I also love writing poetry and short stories. 

Physically, I’m 6’5”. I have green eyes and brown hair. I’m a normal weight. I like to be active. My favorite form of exercise is taking long walks. 

I’m looking for someone who might be open to a relationship at some point. These things take time, so I’m not looking to rush things. I’m looking for someone who loves having deep conversations. Someone who wants to explore art museums or discussing their favorite literature or philosophy. Someone I can share music with and help each other through our days. Building an emotional connection is important to me. 

I’m in the CST time zone, but I work really early hours, meaning I’m up in the middle of the night sometimes. So the time difference isn’t always a problem for me if you think we might hit it off. I am open to voice and video chatting too once we are comfortable with each other. Thanks for reading. I hope everyone finds their person soon. I know how lonely this process can be.

1hqc6fl,https://i.redd.it/do4r8fcgx5ae1.jpeg,I'm Listening.,"My sister in-law called me just now around 11 15 I think,Normally she never calls me because we didn't see eye ro eye. Especially when it came to family and the position we were born in to. Hi my name is Jack and I'm a survived Domestic violence. I have been Diagnosed with Bipolar, P.T.S.D., Insomnia, and Depression. I have been off my meds for about 5 years two and a half of that I livedon the streets of palm springs California tell just recently. On or around November 17   my mother  asked me if I wanted to go live on a piece of land she bought 19 years ago. I had been living on the side of a month north of the city halfway up tramway road at about 1300 feet hoping the world would come to a end, but it never did. what did happened was the tribal authorities scouted out my encampment using drones then informed me that a work detail had been scheduled to come and remove all the stuff not native to the ground and that I was invited to leave. I was told that if I stayed, I would be brought up on charges for trespassing, Littering. and contaminating the ground which I lived on. So I decided to take her up on her offer. Not having very many options. I figured that this was an opportunity to make a Living Amendment before she dies. I'm 48 And 22 years younger than Florence aka mom. and I think that I have A.D.H.D. everything is fucking falling apart the bubble I lived in got popped and know I have to start all over again four the fifth time in my life. I have been here at my mom's since then and had to tell this story to someone because I need help. Cathy is married to my brother Chris  and has been suffering from his Alcoholism for about 12 years. the story leading up to that point is a dramatic one not easily told. I have been working on it's development  since turning 32. but things got Overwhelming This winter and I can't ignore it any longer. I  was satisfied Riding away on the side of that mountain waiting for the Sun to crash into the sea.
 I had my Jug, I smoked my coffee, 
 and I have my wild herbal blend ready to burn away memory when ever the want came around. knowing that I was going to give up my self medicating If I with my mom's I did it cold turkey,  that was a bad thing. I've been going through changes almost every other day trying to maintain and just when I think I've made it passed the darkness I kick over my oil lamp filled with gasoline forced to put it out before that blazing inferno Consumes me or starts takes hostages or victims. I would rather be on the side of a mountain starving. Then have to deal with everybody else's emotional damage for whatever reason I have dwrite it to change.  But still it comes at me every other day, with no end in sight and every other day my heart breaks completely.
 I don't wanna fight anymore.  But I can't lay down and I, my God, won't let me.
 This young lady called me because my brother Chris chose to drink over taking care of her and her 2 kids.  And I'm under the assumption that she called me. Because I'm in the black cheap, I can't tell you. How many times I've avoided Catherine, it's not because she's evil or repulsive, she's not week minded or selfish. fuck how I wish it was just one of those. this is harder than I'd like to admit. The truth is difficult  to accept And I have purposely put myself in harm's way in hopes to die a martyred death. She is the only person in this world that gets me all in my feelings like this. I wish there was a softer easier way. But there I can't save it from the court path. That she is taken. I have this overwhelming desire to help her out of this situation that she's unwittingly wonder into It took.
 About 10 minutes for her to start truly venteen. It took about 20 minutes for me to start crying uncontrollably without uttering a sound I wiped away tears as they rolled down my face All I could manage to do was sit and listen.
This is poor beautiful woman is suffring from Neglected in fractured heart she's crying out her sorrow and hate builds in me towards Chris For a whole bunch of different things, but mainly because he reminds me of his dad, my mom's second husband.
 And she reminds me so much of my mother.
 Honestly, I think I'm falling in love with her. Or maybe I already had. That would explain a lot of different things.
 While I was always fighting with her, I was trying to get her to see.
 When we were alone together, we have a great time.
 She's She likes to cook. She likes to clean. She likes to garden and grill things. She's a good mother she's a hard-headed individual.
 She likes to sing.
 She loves to paint.  Chill out animals. She likes fairies and reading books of that sort of thing. She has unwittingly helped me become a better man.
 By telling me how she feels about her marriage Every time I finish talking to have to go back in my own minds memories And attempt to clean up the mess. My parents left, I need help There's a lot of shit in here. Those people really fucked me up. I really wish they would have gotten into the wars when I was litthough instead. I had to watch all of that shit and now I'm forced to watch it again.
 She doesn't desert.  To live like that, just like my mother shouldn't have decided to stay with that bastard. That was my stepfather. Or put up with the motherfucker that she has now.
 I really hate fucking men. I do I look in the mirror and I see all the nasty things that this.  People have done to me and as a man. Now I've never been married.
 Why the fuck would I want to put myself to tbut? I'm in love with her. I know I can do good. I'm dumb side. Better man than he ever was.  Who embraces being an asshole? I guess there was no other choice. I feel as she feels her story. Mirrors, mine, all I've ever wanted. Was somebody to love into hold? Someone that wasn't afraid to tell me that they were, but I was theirs.  Give me the opportunity to say that they were mine. I stop drinking. I stop using drugs for what to rot here in my mother's back room waiting for her husband to get pissed off and kick me out for the fourth time in a row before Christmas. Now the New Year's tomorrow, she calls me.  Telling me about what he did my fucking brother.
 I used to look up to him even though he was younger just to watch him piss away. He's the best thing that could ever happen to him. I don't have to sit here and quake. Not letting buddy, anybody know that I'm in love with this woman and I have been for yes, I just don't want to admit it.  It wasn't not for any other reason that I know it would hurt so many people in my family because And not from then believing that I was wrong because they wouldn't be able to admit to everybody. That. I was right all of them deserve. What is this? They put themselves in there? The ones that didn't repent didn't stop with their doing.  Didn't embrace the change. They were the ones that blamed everyone next to them. For the mess that they did choose to clean up the fucking mess that they made. They asked for another drink. Another hit another slapped. Everyone wants to dare ask for help. They just looked down their nose at everybody else around them.  They deserve their shame. I'm no saint. I lived a very hard life and I've given up. I've lbut, I've never had a bag. I'm proud of the man I am today. I know that I'm in love with my brother's wife. And I know there's a reason why she comes to me. The last 2 years is becoming more frequit, the more he's out of it, getting himself locked up.
 It has beenlaunch a fucked up existence. This piece of art was made way too fast.
 But I wanted to show it to you guys because it means a lot to me.
 Tell me what you think I need to Quiet the voices in my head.
 And this is the next best way. I know besides going to back out to the streets. Find ing a bag a piece of Dirt on the side of Mountain 1300 feet Waiting for the world end.  Day after day.
I think I'm in love.
Can you only?
Thing you're listening to me It's a painting. I hope you guys can be honest with me.
 I really hope you guys have a whole lot to say.

1hqc61y,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortscarystories/comments/1hqc61y/a_dog_person/,A Dog Person ,"‘Ah, look, Mr Monroe likes you,’ Selena said. 

Mr Monroe was an enormous cat, a Maine Coon. 

If I face-planted here, I’d be eaten, digested, and shat out by morning. 

Selena was always the airy fairy member of our group. She’d been a yoga teacher, a dietitian, a trapeze artist, and now the proud owner of ‘Cat Lat,’ the first cat coffee shop in the city. 

‘You can pet him, Charlie.’ Selena continued. 

‘I’m good.’ 

Mr Monroe slinked off to join his feline cronies, practically hanging from the rafters. 

‘I’ve finally found it,’ she continued, ‘a mission.’ 

I sipped my latte, pausing and pulling a cat hair from my tongue. 

… 

My job, a supply chain manager for J.M. Smucker Dog Food, took me to China. 

When I got home, I met another mutual friend (Adrian) for Starbucks. 

Adrian was an outrageous gossip, and before I’d even sat down, he mentioned Selena. 

‘Let me guess,’ I said, ‘Cat Lat went the same way as Selena the Ballerina.’ 

‘No,’ he answered, ‘business is booming.’

‘Oh?’ 

‘Selena has become unmanageable.’ 

I considered him over the prow of my cold brew. 

‘Selena unmanageable?’ 

‘Cocaine.’ 

‘Really?’ 

‘Yes, and she’s bought a motorbike. One of those you hear long before you see. The new investors say she’s bad for brand image.’ 

‘Selena will be fine,’ I answered, ‘She always lands on her feet.’ 

…

Selena did not land on her feet; she landed on her head. 

I saw the video before I got the message (such is the power of Reddit). 

It showed a woman at the zoo haul herself up the 10ft wall of the tiger enclosure and begin a manic tightrope walk around the perimeter. 

After she fell, the only thing they wrestled back from the tigers was her cranium. 

Selena, the waif/stray, didn’t have any family, and I was now 1/8th owner of a cat coffee shop. 

The others wanted to put the incident at the zoo down to a tragic Selena-ism, but it didn’t sit right. 

I had a pathologist friend look into the case. 

The eight beneficiaries were meeting at Cat Lat when he dropped by. 

The cats swanned around (catted around?), as I wondered at setting dobermans loose in the store. 

‘Your hunch was right, Charlie.’ Dr Tom said. ‘Selena was not in her right mind.’ 

‘Well, we all knew that,’ Adrian quipped. 

‘I mean it,’ he went on, ‘her brain was covered in lesions.’ 

Mr Monroe rubbed his shaggy coat around my legs. 

‘It explains the erratic behavior.’ 

‘What caused the lesions?’ I answered. 

In the corner, another cat meowed, and Dr Tom readjusted his surgical mask. 

‘Toxoplasma gondii.’ 

Mr Monroe leaped onto my lap. When I went to shove him off, something deep in my core made me halt.

I was frozen in inaction as the enormous Maine coon peered up as if to say: 

‘What, Charlie? Cat got your tongue.’ ",8,1735641511.0,shortscarystories,0,0.9,False
1hqc5ks,https://www.reddit.com/r/malaysians/comments/1hqc5ks/am_i_the_problem_i_feel_crushed/,Am I the problem? I feel crushed...,"Before I rant like a loser, I wanted to say **ANAK TUNGGAL IS NOT BAHAGIA** if your family is problematic and also... poor (RM2700 per month type of poor)

I feel like I'm living with a mental/brain ill-ed person, my ~~beloved~~ mother.

She's extremely moody (happy this minute, immediately pissed next minute and immediately back to chill after 3hrs of continuous scolding)

Also, she somehow able to see and hear something me and my father cannot (actually no one can, only her). This make her believe there's other being exist into the world. Worse is she'll always listen to her ""voice"", and act according to it, never listen to real person. Sometimes, or... Twice per week at least, she'll pissed off by the voice and scolds the voice... We tried to suggest her to see doctor but we got scolded to dust and piss her even more, hence we only tell her to stop listening to the hallucinations.

She's crazy, always got pissed by the weirdest reason possible, remember when I was in tadika, we have a family gathering, my uncle bought a happy meals for me, she, the lord, otherwise told me to not accept the gift, but I'm literally a child and my uncle insist to give so I accepted. During the night I went back to home, got scolded and she just thrown out my bolster and lock the house door for the night.

Then during the night before my STPM retake, I got kicked out again for another weird reason. I went to cook Maggi and Coffee for dinner, saw a pot of boiled hot water, used it. Then, she came and noticed, immediately pissed because she told me the hot water is needed to use for making barley tea later (She says use hot water so the water boil faster when preparing the barley tea). Then she starts saying I'm dumb and is a nuisance, got kicked out after, fucked up my STPM math T retake... She only allow me to go back 3 days after... It pissed me off as this story is too ridiculous and people would suspect I'm a brat instead of that woman is wicked.

Also, she always gives some wrong and ridiculous advice and thought it's correct.

I very like idols, so my phone, YouTube, social media are full of them and their picture as my device wallpapers. Suddenly, she just suggest I should stop following them because their ""Yin"" energy is sucking my ""Yang"" energy, so I became weak (I have Thalassemia that's why I'm weak but she doesn't want to acknowledge it). Of course I didn't listen to that bs. However, she just becomes worse, she blaming idol, action games and film are exhausting my energy and forbid me to interact with them. Also, I don't even waste money on merchandise, I just listen idol song and watch their performance/TV show, tf did I do wrong?

But there's one time I go to Japan Expo 2023, she knew and wanted to follow, I told her that event have your most hated thing, ""Japanese and Female Idols"", but she still wants to go and somehow enjoy it, what's this irony?

Imagine being forbid to do EVERYTHING you like. I can't even job hunting freely because she force me to work near the house, if I insist to work outstate I'm afraid I'll be chased out for real.

Also, last time I strained my pelvic area, cannot walk for 2 weeks. She scolded me that I'm wasting her money to pay patch medicine, I'm giving problem and I'm a nuisance... Instead of giving me blessing to get well early, she told me to die faster so I suffer fewer and she doesn't need to spend time take caring a Thalassemic child that strained his pelvic... And then face to GuanYin to wish me die earlier...  

25 years, I seldom act for myself, what I do always put my family first and tolerate them as they are senior, elder and parent. But now I feel like I'm not even me, I'm like playing minesweeper, doing everything, putting flags but I still able to step on a mine... Maybe I'm just a spoilt child that rant for these little things...

Also she always eat outside, not cheap eh, nasi lauk-lauk (叫菜吃饭/大炒), Fast Food, Mid-High End restaurant (Those air-conditioned Kopitiam). Then complain not enough money during end of the month, goddammit... Worse scenario, durian season, RM38++ for one kg chibai...",6,1735641447.0,malaysians,16,0.75,False

1hqbyvu,https://www.reddit.com/r/adultery/comments/1hqbyvu/please_help_should_i_end_it_now/,Please help! Should I end it now?,"My (50f) 18-year marriage has been in deep trouble for the last four years. No sex for the last two. I ended up stepping out once and immediately sought therapy. From the get-go, I knew I needed to make a decision about my marriage because I'm not willing to do this as a lifestyle.

I've been slowly coming to terms with the fact that I need to end my marriage and preparing. Still had basic needs, so nine months ago, I connected with a married man in a dead bedroom situation through an app. He was planning to stay in his ""not awful"" second marriage. First wife was very  abusive (he has PTSD from it) and she turned kids against him; they are estranged. I told him in the beginning that I would likely be divorcing in the coming year, at which point it would end because I'd be single and looking for future potential. He was ok with that.

We met for coffee and it was lightning in a bottle - on both sides. Most fascinating man I've ever met - has a job and hobby business that are so unusual, I made him prove he was legit because I didn't believe him. Still, I reiterated my terms. A week later, he asked to meet up at his home, 7 hrs from me. Before I left, he basically said he wanted ""connection and real intimacy"" because it's the basis of great sex. I really didn't want to get emotions involved, but figured I could deal with a bit of connection. Big mistake.

Two months, three meetups, and hundreds of hours of conversation later, he told me he loved me. I reluctantly said it back because it was the truth. Tried to convince me to do this ""forever"" with him, but I said I would never settle for half a life. I want to go on vacations and out to dinner with someone eventually, so it would only last until I had to go. He literally cried. 

A month later, he called in the middle of the night and told me he was going to ""blow up"" his life. I'd made him realize it wasn't what he needed anymore. I never asked him to do that, but I agreed I'd give him a chance.

Fast forward, we are deeply in love. We've talked/texted every single day -THROUGH the day, since we met. We've been able to meet once a month for 4 days to 2 weeks at a time. Sex is terrific, but almost an afterthought. We cook, hike, share our hobbies, spend hours talking over tea, watch movies, and even sing together late into the night at the kitchen table. 

I told him I'd give him until 12/31/25 to at least get a signed separation agreement in place, or I'm out the door. I'm not going to spend years spinning my wheels. He agreed that was reasonable. For months, we discussed where we'd potentially live, went over budgets, bank accounts, credit scores, planned out a small business. Did boxes of therapy/""getting to know you"" cards. Our therapists and best friends know (my bestie had dinner with us twice.) All are supportive.

This past month, I started feeling anxious, and  realized it was because I haven't seen any real action on his part toward making it happen. I'm filing for divorce within the next couple of weeks.

He's been going through emotions about leaving his home and animals (understandable), concerned about where and how we'd manage a home purchase and move (including heavy hobby equipment), also how to approach ""the"" conversation with his wife. He's also had a bit of family drama that really devastated him. Then he got news that he could potentially lose his job (fully remote) in the coming months, and I felt an energy shift. It's unlikely he'd be able to find a similar job, and it put him in turmoil. I offered for him to come down and live in my large home once I'm separated regardless of the job situation, and set up his shop here. We could spend a year regrouping until we find our dream home, and then I'd sell mine. He said he can't come to me with nothing and expect me to support him. We're both employed professionals. He pays child support, doesn't have a lot left over, but he's set up for retirement. He's now thrown himself into the hobby to grow it as a backup, and hopes to know about his job by March. Can't move out on his own right now, either. Says he ""needs time,"" he ""never imagined"" that someone like me existed and is trying to believe that it's real and trust that he can make the right choice this time. 

Communication is still very consistent and loving, but he rarely brings up all our future plans. He insists he has no intention of stringing me along. Still says he is willing to leave everything behind and wants a future with me, but there's been tension and a few heated moments because he feels I'm being impatient/pressuring him. Says he is working through things and needs to do it on his time. I can't help but feel that it's stalled. Don't know if I should wait out the year, or cut my losses. 

If you read all this, much thanks! 

EDIT: My husband and I live in separate homes that each own individually in adjoining states due to jobs. AP can easily move in once I file.
