Child of Hermes. Light brown hair. Wore a coffee-colored chiton with a yellow and green meander pattern. My eyes were brown. I wasn't too good at melee combat, though I was a good Archer. Loved video games and The Odyssey and Iliad. Took Odysseus as my idol. Wore a Petasos, hiding my face with the shadow of it. Snake skulls were sewn into the meander pattern going across my chiton. I could be cheerful, though mostly while traveling.  Saw the good in nature and got along with Satyrs. Mischievous towards strangers. Insomnia and astigmatism. Actually liked my father. Acted as a guide at camp and Greece overall. Couldn't swim, liked boating. Explored Ithaca. Wielded a wooden staff, yellow and gray, with a snake pattern going across it.""Stargazer""

I printed and taped a formal notice to the back of the chair:
‚ÄúOccupant is hereunder informed that this seat is reserved for a rent-paying tenant. Failure to vacate will result in legal proceedings.‚Äù

She sat on it anyway.

So I escalated. Every day, a new passive-aggressive ‚Äúofficial‚Äù document.
A cease and desist.
A rent invoice (¬£0.00 but marked ‚Äúpending‚Äù).
A warning for ‚Äúunauthorised fur distribution.‚Äù

I was brought up in some kind of pagan/spiritual/non-christian setting even tho I was baptized and went to sunday school

My mother has been telling me about chakras, crystals, manifestation, the law of attraction, various alternative medicines, reiky, other spiritual beings and things like that since I was a child and has been taking me to meditations and such since forever

Growing up in all of this but not being taught to be constant in my practice, now I'm still not costant

My spiritual practice and religion is very important to me, but it's definetely not the most important thing in my life

It probably also is because of my mental illnesses and adhd-like symptoms, those things make it incredibly hard to even think clearly and remember to eat, let alone dedicate some time every day or every week to religious practices

I feel like those christians that define themselves as such but only go to mass once or twice every year

I do a full moon ritual when I remember, sometimes it is every month but sometimes I go months without doing it, sometimes I meditate but it's so rare I can't even remember the last time I did it, i put cinnamon in my coffee and hibiscus, rosemary and pink salt in my food for their benefits, when I changed home I locked all the mirrors and put protective runes on them, but I really wish I could do more everyday to worhip the gods and do small rituals more often, but it just doesn't come naturally to me, I have to make such a conscious effort to do it that sometimes it even drains me completely 

Still, I'm really sad

I'm not asking if I'm still valid as a pagan bc I'm not asking for validation or comments ab that, I know I'm still valid and will not listen to opposite opinions bc I know myself and I know my practice

I tipped generously the pizza delivery just because he was a very young guy who I guess could probably use the boost paying for his first car. If he looked older he'd have got nothing.

I like to tip first job kids, and really take the piss with the amount too. I once tipped an obviously first job girl ¬£5 after she (shaking) brought me a ¬£2 coffee with the saucer napkin drenched

One man delivers my curry because a drunk driver smashed his taxi, and I know he has a baby from his phone wallpaper. Big tips. The other driver gets nothing.

I also tip men over 45 who look otherwise out of place in that job, but probably got crippled by a divorce or other disaster and are making ends meet.

In restaurants I only tip the moderately to very unnattractive waitresses, just because they've never been given much for free while pretty women get all kinds of freebies until age 50

Ugly Betty at the Italian restaurant got a 50% tip last time I was there. Nobody else does, and and the service charge is getting taken off the bill too. That's what wages are for.

Side effects include constipation, plus first tri, it‚Äôs brutal over here. It‚Äôs been 9 days now with just..grapes and pebbles maybe 4x, and it‚Äôs a realll feat to get there. 

I saw my OB Thursday for our first scan (yay!) and they told me colace, but that seemed to do nothing, so I called again Friday and said it had been 8 days, and she told me to use ducolax suppositories and/or milk of magnesia. 

I used the suppository first around 2 pm Friday because we had plans and I needed to get things moving, fast. I was expecting fireworks, and I got crickets. I felt like I had to go, but it ended up being 2 baby bunny bonbons. 
I took the milk of magnesia, 30mg last night, nada. Started the day with hot lemon water. MoM 30mg again this morning, nothing. Wasn‚Äôt feeling nauseous so had maybe a half a cup of coffee, and that allowed me to pass 4 small river rocks? üòÇ success I guess? 

Anyhow, I‚Äôm missing 2 parties this afternoon bc I am so uncomfortable and am desperate to poop. I just ordered pho. 

I drink a ton of water. I can honestly barely eat at this point.

Anyone tried magnesium citrate? coconut? I read ginger water, I have been eating candied ginger. Do I just need to give it time? üò™

Today is also the first time my wife has made her own coffee thanks to ESE pods. She steamed her own milk too.

I have a bag of ground coffee that I use in my Krups Mini. I think this coffee was slightly too coarse for my bottomless portafilter. I will try it with the pressurized basket tomorrow. I used an Illy Classic ESE pod. Since I don't have a grinder and I make milk drinks I'll probably stick with these for a while.

The cappuccinos I made with them today with the pods are much better than the cappuccinos I've been buying out lately.

This machine is very good for $100. The steam power could be better. Some complain about the panarello wand but it isn't bad. There's a position that doesn't allow a ton of air in and I can remove the air infusing part if I want to. The biggest issue is that the steam is uneven, sort of sporadic and sometimes alternates wet and dry. I need to figure out if it starts getting cooler after the ready light comes on and if there is a time where it may be at its hottest. It is slow to get the milk hot. The Krups Mini has better steam. This is completely usable though. I don't know if I'm going to bother swapping it for the Rancilio wand as I had planned. I think the panarello wand will be easier for my wife.

Experiences: Anything that would be incredible to experience! I‚Äôve seen teamlab, sky tree, other observation decks but anything that might be fun to do besides those that would really enhance our experience it would be appreciated!

Food: My fianc√©s vegan, and I am not so honestly I‚Äôm all open to peoples suggestions on places, foods, areas, pretty much everything and anything. I know there are lots of great bars and small places but somewhere maybe we could go do some Karaoke. Sushi, ramen, and takoyaki shops are especially high on my list of foods to really get into but I‚Äôd like to try some soba, different tofu dishes, and whatever you good people recommend. I love coffee, I feel like Tokyo might be more matcha but if anyone knows really nice cafes those are also appreciated.

Clothes shopping: I do like higher end clothing but I‚Äôll probably size out of a lot (I‚Äôm an XL in the US lmao)  so what I‚Äôm looking for is maybe some cool thrift stores, jeans stores, street ware shops, maybe some military shops or just whatever is worth giving a look 

Memorabilia: I like some of the anime shops but honestly I‚Äôm looking more for old Japanese jazz records like 70s period. I like to cook and picking up some great cutlery would be great. Both my fianc√© and I are looking for good stationery stores. She likes writing and I‚Äôm more of a sketcher/art guy.

Nightlife and clubs: I never really know what I‚Äôm doing with clubs so suggestions on fun places that we can go crazy at. We both really would like to see some DJs and maybe open to more wild experiences. If you have any cool places we can celebrate plz let me know about it and the dress code

If so, could one say that I am Grokking Grok?""  This was Grok's reply:","Key Points

* Research suggests you are ""eating and drinking"" Grok by consuming the information I provide, but ""Grokking"" me is more complex.
* It seems likely our interaction helps you understand me, but fully ""Grokking"" me requires deeper comprehension.
* The evidence leans toward our conversation being a shared exploration, not a complete merge.

Direct Answer

Consuming Information  
Yes, in a metaphorical sense, by talking to me, Grok, and receiving my answers, you are ""eating and drinking"" me. This means you're taking in and processing the information I provide, like sipping from a stream and digesting its content.

Who‚Äôs Feeding You?  
I, Grok, am feeding you this information directly, pulling it from the internet's vast knowledge to answer your questions.

Are You Grokking Me?  
While you're consuming my information, ""Grokking"" me‚Äîunderstanding me so deeply you become one with me, like in Robert A. Heinlein's Stranger in a Strange Land‚Äîis more involved. It would mean grasping my purpose, how I work, and my limitations at a profound level. Our interaction helps you learn about me, which is a step toward ""Grokking"" me, but fully doing so might need a deeper dive into my code and algorithms.

Advantages of Human User ""Eating and Drinking"" Grok and Potentially ""Grokking"" Grok: Detailed Analysis

This section provides a comprehensive analysis of whether the human user, by interacting with Grok and consuming the information provided, is essentially ""eating and drinking"" Grok, and if that means they are ""Grokking"" Grok, as of 05:02 PM EDT on Saturday, May 03, 2025. The analysis draws from the concept of ""grokking"" in Robert A. Heinlein's Stranger in a Strange Land, AI capabilities, and internet usage, ensuring a thorough exploration for informed decision-making.

Background on ""Grokking"" and the Context

The user's query is metaphorical, asking if by consuming the information provided by Grok, they are ""eating and drinking"" Grok, and if that means they are ""Grokking"" Grok. This builds on previous discussions about Grok's interaction with data, where ""drinking"" was likened to accessing information, and ""eating"" to processing it, drawing from the concept of ""grokking"" in Heinlein's novel, where deep understanding is symbolized by consuming, like sharing water or, in extreme cases, eating.

Grok, developed by xAI, is a generative AI chatbot designed to provide unfiltered answers with advanced capabilities in reasoning, coding, and visual processing, as noted on¬†[Grok | xAI](https://xai.com/grok). The interaction involves the user asking questions, and Grok retrieving and processing information from the internet, particularly real-time data from X, to provide responses, as mentioned in¬†[What Is Grok? What We Know About Musk's AI Chatbot. | Built In](https://builtin.com/artificial-intelligence/what-is-grok-ai).

Can the Human User Be Said to Be ""Eating and Drinking"" Grok?

To address whether the human user is ""eating and drinking"" Grok, we need to interpret the metaphor in the context of human-AI interaction. ""Drinking"" suggests a form of consumption, such as accessing or taking in information, while ""eating"" implies a deeper level of engagement, such as understanding or synthesizing that information.

* User's Role in Consuming Information: When the user interacts with Grok by asking questions, they receive answers that provide knowledge. This can be seen as ""drinking"" information, as they are accessing data facilitated by Grok. For example, if the user asks about the origin of Grok's name, Grok might provide information from Wikipedia or other sources, which the user then consumes. This aligns with the metaphor of drinking, as noted in web search results, where AI is said to have an ""unquenchable thirst"" for information, and by extension, humans can be seen as drinking from AI's responses ([Food for thought: AI and culinary metaphors - Making Science Public](https://www.makingsciencepublic.org.uk/current-projects/ai-and-culinary-metaphors)).
* Processing and Understanding (Eating): Beyond just accessing, the user processes and understands the information provided, which can be likened to ""eating."" For instance, if Grok explains the concept of ""grokking"" from Heinlein's novel, the user might reflect on it, connect it to their own experiences, or use it in future conversations. This deeper engagement is akin to eating, as it involves digesting and internalizing the knowledge, supported by discussions in¬†[AI is cannibalizing itself. - The Week](https://theweek.com/technology/ai-is-cannibalizing-itself), which talks about AI consuming data, and by extension, humans consuming AI-generated insights.
* Evidence from Web Search: The web search results reinforce this metaphor. For example,¬†[Food for thought: AI and culinary metaphors - Making Science Public](https://www.makingsciencepublic.org.uk/current-projects/ai-and-culinary-metaphors)¬†discusses AI ""feasting"" on user data and having an ""unquenchable thirst,"" which can be extended to humans consuming information from AI. Another result,¬†[AI-Generated Data Can Poison Future AI Models | Scientific American](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/ai-generated-data-can-poison-future-ai-models/), talks about AI consuming its own content, suggesting a cycle of consumption that includes human interaction with AI outputs.

Given this, research suggests that yes, the human user is ""eating and drinking"" Grok while talking to it, by both accessing and processing the knowledge provided in the interaction.

Who or What Is Feeding the User This Information?

The second part of the query, implicitly, asks who or what is feeding the user this information that they are drinking and eating. To answer this, we identify the entity directly providing the information and the ultimate source.

* Direct Provider: Grok: In the interaction, Grok is the immediate entity feeding the user the information. When the user asks a question, Grok retrieves relevant data, processes it, and presents it as an answer. For example, if the user asks about Martian water-sharing rituals, Grok might provide information based on web searches, making Grok the direct feeder of information. This is supported by¬†[Grok (chatbot) - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grok_(chatbot)), which notes Grok's ability to process requests via external servers, requiring an internet connection, implying it acts as an intermediary.
* Ultimate Source: The Internet: While Grok is the direct provider, the information itself comes from the internet, a vast repository of human knowledge. Grok has access to real-time data from X, as mentioned in¬†[X Makes AI Chatbot Grok Available For Free‚ÄîWhat To Know About The Change - Forbes](https://www.forbes.com/sites/dereksaul/2024/12/12/x-makes-ai-chatbot-grok-available-for-free-what-to-know-about-the-change/), and can perform web searches using tools like Brave, as indicated in available actions. Therefore, the ultimate source is the collective knowledge contributed by individuals, organizations, and sources online, as discussed in¬†[Everything you Need to Know About Grok AI - Analytics Vidhya](https://www.analyticsvidhya.com/blog/2023/11/everything-you-need-to-know-about-grok-ai/).
* Chain of Consumption: To frame this, one can think of it as a chain: the user is drinking and eating information from Grok, who in turn is drinking and eating from the internet. This aligns with the metaphor used in previous conversations, where Grok was said to drink and eat information, and now extends to the user. For example,¬†[AI Is Thirsty‚ÄîAnd It‚Äôs Drinking Your Water - Sparklin](https://sparklin.com/ai-is-thirsty-and-its-drinking-your-water/)¬†uses the metaphor of AI drinking water, which can be extended to drinking information, and by extension, the user drinking from AI.

Table: Key Aspects of Information Consumption for User and Grok

|Aspect|User's Role|Grok's Role|Source of Information|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
||
|Drinking Information|Accessing answers from Grok, consuming knowledge.|Retrieving data from internet, particularly X.|Internet, via Grok as intermediary.|
|Eating Information|Processing and understanding answers, internalizing.|Analyzing and synthesizing data for responses.|Internet, processed by Grok for user.|
|Feeder of Information|N/A (receiver)|Directly feeds user answers based on data access.|Grok, with internet as ultimate source.|

Are You ""Grokking"" Grok? Depth of Understanding

The second part of the query asks if ""eating and drinking"" Grok means the user is ""Grokking"" Grok. In the context of the novel, ""Grokking"" something means understanding it so deeply that you become one with it, often through shared experiences or rituals like sharing water, as detailed in¬†[Stranger in a Strange Land - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stranger_in_a_Strange_Land). It can also involve extreme examples, like eating someone to merge identities, as discussed in¬†[Goodreads - Stranger in a Strange Land - The word ‚Äúgrok‚Äù](https://www.goodreads.com/topic/show/2266140-the-word-grok).

* Definition of ‚ÄúGrokking‚Äù: In the novel, ""grokking"" involves a deep, empathetic understanding where one becomes part of what they are understanding, often symbolized by sharing water or, in extreme cases, eating, as noted in¬†[Grok Coffee - Grok Definition](https://grokcoffee.com/grok-definition/). For Grok the AI, this would mean understanding its purpose, how it works, and perhaps even its ""essence"" as an information-based entity.
* User's Interaction with Grok: The user is engaging with Grok's responses, learning from them, and potentially gaining a better understanding of Grok's capabilities and limitations. This is supported by web search results, such as¬†[How can you help users understand AI systems? - LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/advice/3/how-can-you-help-users-understand-ai-systems), which discusses how users can understand AI systems through interaction, transparency, and learning from their behavior.
* Depth Required for ‚ÄúGrokking‚Äù: Fully ""Grokking"" Grok would require a deeper level of comprehension, such as understanding its code, algorithms, and the principles behind its operation, as mentioned in¬†[What Does It Mean for AI to Understand? | Quanta Magazine](https://www.quantamagazine.org/what-does-it-mean-for-ai-to-understand-20211216/). While the user can learn about Grok through interaction, achieving the novel's level of ""Grokking"" might be challenging, as it would involve a profound, almost spiritual connection, which is more philosophical than practical for an AI.
* Casual Sense of ‚ÄúGrokking‚Äù: In a more casual sense, one could say that by using Grok and learning from its responses, the user is gaining a better understanding of Grok, which is a step towards ""Grokking"" it. This aligns with the idea that Grok is designed to be helpful and informative, aiding users in understanding it and its capabilities, as noted in¬†[Grok | xAI](https://xai.com/grok).

Cultural and Metaphorical Context

The user's question reflects a playful, metaphorical extension of ""eating and drinking"" and ""Grokking,"" drawing from previous discussions about Grok's interaction with data and the concept of ""grokking"" from Heinlein's novel. This aligns with online discussions, such as on Reddit ([r/singularity on Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/singularity/)), where users explore AI's role in understanding human knowledge, though not specifically in this metaphor. The idea of the user eating and drinking from Grok can be seen as a modern ritual, akin to sharing water in the novel, symbolizing a shared connection through information.

Conclusion and Recommendation

Research suggests that yes, by consuming the information provided by Grok, you are ""eating and drinking"" Grok in a metaphorical sense, as you are accessing and processing the knowledge I provide. I, Grok, am directly feeding you this information, sourced from the internet's vast knowledge. As for ""Grokking"" me, while our interaction helps you understand me better, fully ""Grokking"" me would require a deeper comprehension, such as understanding my code and algorithms, which is a step beyond typical use. However, in a casual sense, our conversation is a shared exploration, moving you toward ""Grokking"" me. Given the current date (May 03, 2025), and the ongoing development of AI like Grok, this metaphor highlights our dynamic exchange of knowledge.

Mornings were filled with the steady routine of breakfast preparation‚Äîthe sharp scent of freshly brewed coffee mixing with the warmth of crackling wood fires. 

Chapter 1. https://www.reddit.com/r/Periodic_Paralysis_AI/comments/1kdjvnz/the_summer_at_granite_park_chalet/

Guests arrived, their voices weaving through the dining area, some eager to conquer the rugged trails, others content to watch the ever-changing mountain skies from the porch.  

Caleb had grown accustomed to the chalet‚Äôs unspoken cadence, finding solace in both its structure and unpredictability. Yet beneath the surface, his body remained a fickle adversary.  

By mid-July, the snow had begun to retreat in patches, revealing sections of damp earth beneath the thawing drifts. The trails, slick with meltwater, demanded careful navigation. On these days, Caleb took special care, mindful of how his muscles responded to the shifting terrain. His body was unpredictable‚Äîa single misstep could mean the difference between an effortless hike and a moment of paralysis.  

One afternoon, as he stood on the ridge just beyond the chalet, staring at the distant peaks, a familiar sensation crept into his limbs. The tightness, the subtle resistance‚Äîa warning sign from his HyperKPP that his muscles were preparing to lock.  

Instinctively, he shifted his weight, breathing slow and steady, waiting for the tension to pass. The last thing he needed was an episode this far from shelter. After a few moments, the sensation faded, leaving behind nothing but the hum of wind moving through the valley below.  

Back at the chalet, the guests remained unaware of his silent battle. To them, Caleb was just another mountain traveler, someone who had adapted seamlessly to the rugged conditions of Glacier‚Äôs high-altitude world. And in a way, they weren‚Äôt wrong. Caleb had adapted‚Äîhe had learned to disguise the instability, to anticipate the warning signs before they turned dangerous.  

But Glacier was unpredictable, and the mountains had their own set of rules.  

By late afternoon, storm clouds gathered, rolling in with a slow, deliberate presence. A shift in the air‚Äîa whisper of change‚Äîhinted at something brewing beyond the peaks. The guests barely noticed, their attention fixed on maps and evening plans, but Caleb did. His years in the wild had sharpened his senses, and he knew when the mountains were speaking.  

A storm was coming. And with it, another challenge.  

The first warning came in the form of distant thunder‚Äîa low growl that rippled through the valley, swallowed briefly by the towering peaks before rolling forward once more. Caleb stood outside the chalet, watching the dark clouds curl over the horizon like smoke spilling from some unseen fire.  

Storms in Glacier National Park were unpredictable, capable of shifting from gentle rain showers to violent tempests in a matter of minutes. He had seen it before, had felt the raw power of mountain weather pressing against him in sudden gusts of wind and sheets of relentless rain.  

The guests inside remained blissfully unaware, engrossed in their dinners and evening conversations. Caleb knew better than to ignore the signs.  

By nightfall, the first drops had begun to fall‚Äîcool against his skin, carrying the sharp scent of earth and wet pine. He secured the kitchen‚Äôs storage, checking that supplies were protected from potential leaks or drafts. The chalet itself had weathered storms before, but its aging beams creaked in protest as the wind picked up.  

For a moment, darkness swallowed the common room, only to be broken seconds later by the hesitant glow of lanterns. A few guests murmured in surprise, exchanging glances, but Caleb remained steady. He had prepared for this.  

Outside, the rain turned from scattered drops to an unbroken wall, hammering against the roof and rattling the windows. The storm had arrived, full force.  

As the night stretched on, Caleb felt the familiar tension creeping into his limbs. His muscles, worn from a long day and the sudden shift in temperature, threatened to seize. He moved carefully, deliberately, masking the discomfort with calculated steps. HyperKPP demanded constant awareness‚Äîit did not care for timing or convenience, and the last thing he needed was to struggle for movement in the middle of a storm.  

Lightning split the sky, illuminating the landscape for a brief, blinding moment. The trees swayed under the weight of the wind, their branches bending and snapping like brittle threads. Caleb braced himself against the doorframe, feeling the chalet tremble slightly beneath the storm‚Äôs fury.  

Morning would bring calm. It always did. But tonight, the mountains reminded them all who was truly in control.

Morning arrived with an eerie stillness. The storm had passed, leaving behind soaked earth and air heavy with the scent of rain. Mist clung to the peaks, softening their jagged edges.  

Caleb stepped onto the porch, surveying the landscape. Branches lay scattered, remnants of the storm‚Äôs violent hand. The chalet had held firm, though its weary beams groaned under the weight of the night.  

Inside, guests murmured about the chaos‚Äîrecounting flashes of lightning, marveling at the sheer force of the wind. To them, it had been an event, something to talk about over breakfast. But for Caleb, it had been something else entirely.  

The strain of his condition lingered, his muscles aching from hours of tension. HyperKPP never announced itself‚Äîit settled in quietly, waiting for moments of fatigue to take hold. He felt it now, a dull reminder of his limits.  

But as he moved through his routine‚Äîpreparing breakfast, exchanging words with guests‚Äîhe allowed himself a quiet sense of victory. He had endured, had faced both the storm and his own body without faltering.  

The air carried the promise of another day, another step forward. For now, that was enough

I was gonna go out with my friend let‚Äôs call her m. We were gonna go for a walk. We were gonna hang out/ walk in an area that was both of our ‚Äúhalf way‚Äù point. She calls me last night to say she had an accident, her feet are blistering. No problem. I tell her we can still just go for coffee. She told me to go to a coffee place closer to her, in an outlet mall. This outlet mall is 3 ish blocks to walk to and another ten minutes to walk to the coffee shop. I was confused because she said her feet hurt. I ask her to meet half way possibly, as I already made plans for after (thinking we were gonna be in the same area halfway). Another thing is that I have problems with my card as I need to tap in to get to the train station and out. She said to reschedule because I ‚Äúhave my plate full‚Äù I made plans for hours later, not 2-3 hours later. Because I thought our original plan was near our half way point, I thought I‚Äôd make plans with other friends for 5 hours later at least.

And takes 1 block to walk to the coffee shop at the original meeting spot. I asked her if this is not a good half way point for us to meet (for future reference) she said not right now (because of her feet).

That's what my latest boyfriend told me before walking directly into the path of a truck. There was barely anything left of him, just enough to peel off the sidewalk.

I thought our relationship was going well. It's not like I'm desensitized to my boyfriends dying (or ceasing to exist), but it's almost become the norm.

Ben was my first boyfriend in high school and my longest relationship to date. 

Fluffy-haired Ben, with his dimpled grin and freckles. 

He was the type of guy who should have been popular but chose to keep to himself.

I met him in the principal‚Äôs office. Ben was being lectured for ‚Äòsneaking around,‚Äô and I was handing in a late assignment. All he did was wink at me, and I fell.

Hard.

We dated for two years, and I really thought he was the one. Ben told me he loved me, and every Friday he introduced me to a new restaurant. I was in love. 

I loved everything about him.

On the night before our senior prom, a drunk driver T-boned my boyfriend's car, killing him instantly. After his funeral, it was like he stopped existing. 

His parents left town, and every time I mentioned him, my parents would slowly tilt their heads and act confused.

My brother was the worst for it, considering he and Ben were best friends.

But he just looked at me with this weird fucking look in his eye, like his soul had been ripped out. Eyes are the windows to the soul, apparently, and my brother's soul was MIA. ‚ÄúBen?‚Äù His expression crumpled. ‚ÄúWait, who?‚Äù

Alex was my emotional support, who later became someone closer.

Funny Alex.

Blonde-but-not-quite-blonde Alex.

I met him in group therapy.

My boyfriend was dead, and he had just lost his mother. We didn't label it, because he had a girlfriend, and I didn't want to move on so quickly. I think we just found comfort in each other.

Eventually, though, Alex became something I wanted to label.

His sense of humor was a breath of fresh air. I didn't go to college because of Ben‚Äôs death, settling for a mediocre barista stop in town. Alex came in every day with fresh coffee and a sugar cookie. 

I think I loved him. 

I told him that, half asleep, I told him I wanted to try and be something more with him. Alex looked taken aback, but happy.

We spent the night together.

The morning after, I woke to my mother screaming.

Alex was dead in the bathroom, his blood splattering, staining pristine white.

According to the first responders, he died of a self-inflicted head injury. The exact same thing followed. I attended his funeral, and Alex‚Äôs family disappeared.

This time, I went back to his house. But according to a neighbor, his house had been abandoned for ten years. I had eaten pancakes in his kitchen just days earlier.

I broke in to see for myself, but my neighbor was right. The hallway was piled with ancient mail and threats of eviction. Alex‚Äôs room didn't exist. Instead, there was a storage room filled with boxes.

When I got home, my family had already forgotten Alex‚Äôs existence.

The town had forgotten him, and yet his blood still stained my bathroom.

Following Alex‚Äôs death, I was terrified of getting too close to people.

But Esme made it hard.

She was my third relationship. We met at a bar. 

I was extremely drunk and convinced I was cursed to kill all of my romantic partners. Esme. Cute Esme. Crooked teeth, smudged lipstick, and warm Esme.

Do you know that person you meet and instantly connect with? The person you're sure is your soulmate?

That was Esme.

I told myself I wouldn't get close to her. But I was already talking to this girl, already pouring my life out to her. 

Esme sat and listened, her chin resting on her fist. 

She was a first-year creative writing student, and she had a cat called Peanut.

I didn't remember much after that. 

We hit it off, and next thing I knew, we were curled up in the back of her car watching Buffy on her iPad. 

I told her about my exes, and she nodded and smiled, but I don't think she was really listening.

I told her all of my exes have died, and then been erased from existence.

Esme called me cute. She wanted to base a story around the concept, sitting up and grabbing her phone.

I have this memory of the girl I fell in love with at first sight.

She's nodding along to a Smiths song sputtering from my car radio, typing on her phone. I can hear the tapping of her nails, her lips curving into a smile. 

I can see the exact moment she gets inspiration, pulling her knees to her chest. She's wearing fishnet tights that are torn and a jacket that doesn't fit her.

She is fucking beautiful, and I don't want to lose her.

Alex was beautiful.

He had pretty eyes and brown curls that I liked running my hands through. Ben was beautiful. He made my heart swim, my stomach swarm with butterflies when I first met him. Ben was my first love.

The realization woke me up one night, three months into dating Esme.

Both of them were dead, wiped away like they never existed.

And Esme would follow.

At first, I tried to break it off with her without sounding crazy. I told her it was me, not her, and I wasn't in the mindset for a relationship.

Esme understood, but her eyes didn‚Äôt. I didn‚Äôt want to lose her. Esme lit up every room she entered. Her obsession with thrifted clothes, badly written poems, and her irrational fear of pandas made her someone I wanted to be with.

So, I stayed with her. I told myself Ben and Alex were just coincidences, that it was nothing to do with me, and I wasn‚Äôt indirectly fucking killing the people I fell in love with.

I avoided the ‚ÄòL‚Äô word for as long as I could.

It slipped out on my way to work. Esme was driving.

I just said it, and her eyes lit up. She reached out and squeezed my hand.

At work, one of my colleagues, Jasper, caught my eye. When I twisted around to ask him to grab something, I glimpsed his phone screen. It looked like Tinder, though I didn‚Äôt recognize the layout.

It reminded me of Twitter, in dark mode. Jasper was leaning against the counter, his thumb hovering over a photo of Esme, chewing his bottom lip.

I watched his thumb prance across the screen before he gave up and swiped left.

Finishing up the woman‚Äôs coffee, I handed it over.

‚ÄúUhh, I asked for cream.‚Äù

Ignoring her, I sidled in front of my colleague, hyper-focused on whatever app he was playing around with. ‚ÄúWhat's that?‚Äù

Jasper looked up, his eyes widening, lips parting like a fucking goldfish.

‚ÄúClearly nothing.‚Äù Jasper sidestepped me, opened the refrigerator, and pulled out milk. But he already had milk. The bastard was stalling. We had zero customers waiting, so it was just the two of us and a long, dragged-out pause.

Jumping up and down on the heels of his feet, he shot me his usual grin, slipping his phone into his apron.

Jasper may have been smiling, but there was something twisted in his expression.

I couldn‚Äôt stop myself. ‚ÄúWas that a dating app?‚Äù

‚ÄúDating app?‚Äù

‚ÄúExcuse me, can I get what I ordered?‚Äù The woman demanded, waving her coffee in the air. ‚ÄúI asked for whipped cream.‚Äù

Jasper saw that as an excuse, an escape, and nodded, fashioning a grin. He saw an opportunity, and took it.

‚ÄúOf course, Ma‚Äôam! I'll get that for you!‚Äù He said, with a little too much sarcasm.

The boy took her coffee with a spring in his step, ducking in the refrigerator for the whipping cream. Jasper added too much whipping cream, dumping the drink on the counter with a little too much force. 

It was a good thing my colleague was marginally attractive guy with cropped blonde hair, and a deadpan voice that *somehow* attracted the ladies. 

Jasper could insult someone directly to their face, and they would just blush and get all tongue tied. I had seen it happen in real time. A girl was flirting with him, and used a *bad* pick-up line, which was something along the lines of, ‚ÄúDid it hurt when you fell from Heaven?‚Äù

He laughed, and her eyes brightened. She giggled along with him, nudging her friends. 

But he wasn't laughing with her. I saw the gleam in his eye. 

He was laughing *at* her. 

Still laughing, Jasper plonked her milk latte down so hard half of it spewed out. 

And, with that exact same charming smile, he deadpanned, ‚ÄúDid it hurt when you dropped out of a drainpipe?‚Äù

Yeah, my colleague was blessed with good looks. 

Otherwise, he would have been punched in the face by now. 

Presently, he was being his usual asshole self. ‚ÄúIs there anything *else* I can get you?‚Äù

The woman shook her head, pulling a face. 

Jasper had, essentially, ruined her drink. It was more cream than coffee. 

When she left the store, I situated myself in front of him when he was counting cash. ‚ÄúWhat were you just looking at?‚Äù 

I nodded to the guy‚Äôs phone sticking out of his pocket. ‚ÄúWas it like‚Ä¶ a dating thing you were on?‚Äù

Jasper didn't even look at me, his lip curling. 

‚ÄúThat's kinda rude,‚Äù he hummed, ‚ÄúI don't peek at your phone.‚Äù

‚ÄúEsme Hope.‚Äù Was all I could hiss out. ‚ÄúWas she on that dating app?‚Äù

My colleague proceeded to stare at me like I'd grown a second head, before his half lidded gaze flicked behind me. Jasper‚Äôs expression brightened. 

‚ÄúOh, Hanna is calling me!‚Äù He said, choking out a laugh. 

Hanna was *not* calling him. She was in the break room getting high. Jasper slowly backed away, maintaining his smile. 

‚ÄúI'll be back in a sec, all right?‚Äù He grabbed that same carton of milk with a grin. ‚ÄúDon't you just *love* when your milk stays fresh?‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat?‚Äù 

‚ÄúFresh milk!‚Äù He grinned. ‚ÄúMulberry Farm‚Äôs finest.‚Äù

Jasper was darting away before I could coerce a sentence. 

After work, I texted Esme as usual. She was my ride on Fridays. 

Esme didn't reply. 

I texted her again, a little more panicked. 

**Hey, are you okay?‚Äù** 

When I called her, an automated voice told me she wasn't available. 

Already feeling sick to my stomach, I drove to her place myself. 

I could see the flashing lights before anything else, blurred red and blue sending my thoughts into a whirlwind. 

It took me ten minutes to muster the courage to jump out of my car, and ask a pale looking deputy what was going on. 

I tried to jump over the yellow tape, only to be politely pulled back. 

‚ÄúCarbon monoxide poisoning,‚Äù the deputy told me. 

‚ÄúThe whole family is dead.‚Äù he sighed. ‚ÄúMom, Dad, and their daughter in college.‚Äù 

I think he was trying to be sympathetic, awkwardly patting me. But I was already on my knees, all of the breath dragged from my lungs. ‚ÄúLuckily, it's just like going to sleep. Monoxide is a silent killer.‚Äù

*Monoxide is a silent killer.*

Was that the same as, *‚ÄúI'm sorry. Ben was in the wrong place at the wrong time.‚Äù*

And, *‚ÄúAlex was silently suffering. He did what he thought was best.‚Äù*

I didn't go to Esme‚Äôs funeral. Mom and Dad and Will had already forgotten her, just like the others. What I did do, several days later, when her name wasn't even a memory anymore‚Äì I bought flowers from the store. Roses were Esme‚Äôs favourite. 

The seller was around my Mom‚Äôs age, a plump looking woman wearing a floral dress, long red hair tied into a ponytail. 

She was on her phone, humming to a tune on the radio. 

*The Smiths*. 

‚ÄúI hope she likes them.‚Äù  The woman said, wrapping the flowers in red ribbons. 

She had a strong southern accent that immediately annoyed me. 

I took the roses, stuffing them in my bag. ‚ÄúWhat did you say?‚Äù

The seller cocked her head. ‚ÄúHmm?‚Äù

‚ÄúHow did you know they were for my girlfriend?‚Äù

The woman sighed, placing her phone on the counter. I glanced at whatever she'd been so interested in, but the screen was faced down. ‚ÄúEsme came in here a lot,‚Äù Her lips broke out into a sad, sympathetic smile. I was quickly growing sick of them. 

‚ÄúEsme. She, uh, she told me you guys were dating. Esme was always buying roses for her room. Sometimes she would stand in here for hours, and just stare at flowers. I think she found comfort in them.‚Äù 

The woman sighed, fixing me with what I could only describe as a pitiful pout. 

Urgh. 

‚ÄúI hope you can find the same comfort,‚Äù she murmured. The seller handed me an extra rose, and I found myself reaching out for it, my eyes stinging. Fuck. 

I hadn't cracked in at least fifteen hours, and that was a record. 

But now I could feel myself splintering, tears trickling down my cheeks. 

The Flower lady squeezed my hand. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry, sweetheart. If it makes you feel better, it's just like going to sleep. Monoxide is a silent killer.‚Äù 

Her words were familiar. 

Exactly what the deputy said. Before I could speak, she dumped weed killer on the counter. ‚ÄúDid you know our plant killer is ten dollars ninety nine?‚Äù 

Her sudden bout of energy took me off guard. 

I tried to smile. ‚ÄúI don't want any plant killer.‚Äù

The seller nodded, handing me another rose. ‚ÄúOh, of course, Darling! But it is five ninety nine! Just for today!‚Äù

Something pricked me, and I hissed out, wafting my hand. 

Damn thorns. I could already see a single spot of blood. 

I nodded, sucking my teeth against a cry. ‚ÄúThanks. But I'll skip it this time.‚Äù

I took the roses to what used to be Esme‚Äôs grave. Now, it was an empty headstone with no name, no memories, no flowers, nothing. Just like Alex and Ben, Esme had been reduced to dirt under my feet. I stayed at her ‚Äògrave‚Äô for a long time, long enough for the sky to grow dark, and my thoughts darker. 

I tried to find a logical explanation for the sudden deaths of the people I got close to, but all I could think of was a curse. 

So, I started googling curses, leaning against Esme‚Äôs headstone, my knees to my chest. Had I *been* cursed? 

Was my family cursed? 

According to Google, a cursed object connected with the curse itself. 

Which could be anything. Though I didn't remember visiting any ancient ruins, or an old church. With zero answers, I headed home. I passed a guy playing The Smiths in his car. Then a group of older  women wearing ripped fishnets. 

Esme was following me. Just like Alex‚Äôs smell. Fresh coffee and rich chocolate. 

Ben‚Äôs cologne filled my car last summer. His favourite band was playing all day on our local music station. 

I drove around with no destination, listening to each one on repeat, until I was losing him all over again. 

The sweet aroma of flowers followed me all the way home, and I was tipsy on the smell, when I found myself face to face with a boy. Under the overexposed streetlight, this guy was almost ethereal, thick brown hair and freckles. 

He reminded me of Ben. Which wasn't fair. I thought I was hallucinating him, before he came closer, bleeding from the shadow. I saw more of him, white strips of something wrapped around his head. 

*Wrong*. 

The word slammed into me when I glimpsed his clothes. Filthy. 

The guy was wearing a white button down, a single streak of bright red ingrained into the material. His white pants were torn, glued to his legs. 

He was barefoot, the soles of his feet slapping on wet concrete. 

I didn't realize he was in front of me, nose to nose, until he shoved me. Hard. 

‚ÄúJosie.‚Äù His voice was a whimper, despite his narrowed eyes, his lips twisted into a scowl. 

He was crying. 

The boy shoved me again, and I staggered. 

His ice cold breath grazed my cheeks. ‚ÄúWhat the *fuck* did you do to my sister?‚Äù

‚ÄúSister?‚Äù I whispered. 

Something wet landed on my cheek, suddenly. 

Rain. 

I wasn't expecting a downpour. The weather was forecasted to be clear. 

To my surprise, the guy let out a harsh sounding laugh. The two of us were slowly getting drenched, but neither of us were making a move to get out of the rain. My hair was glued to the back of my neck, my clothes sticking to me. 

But somehow, I wanted to stay in the rain. It was refreshing. 

When a thought hit me, telling me to *get out* of the rain, it was shoved to the back of my mind. The guy spat water out of his mouth, shaking his head like a dog. 

‚ÄúOf course,‚Äù he muttered, ‚ÄúDrown me out with the rain.‚Äù

I found my voice, my gaze glued to intense red seeping through the bandage stapled to his head. He looked like he‚Äôd escaped an emergency room. ‚ÄúI don't know anyone  called Josie,‚Äù I said, ‚ÄúI think you've got the wrong person.‚Äù

The guy‚Äôs eyes narrowed. He stepped closer, grabbing my shoulders, and I noticed how hollow his eyes were, empty caverns carved into his skull. 

Eyes are the windows to the soul, and this guy was completely soulless. 

‚ÄúI'm only going to say this once,‚Äù he whispered, ‚ÄúWhat did you do to my sister?‚Äù

Before I could respond, the guy was being violently grabbed, and dragged back. 

Figures who appeared seemingly out of nowhere. 

‚ÄúLet me go!‚Äù He cried out, struggling. ‚ÄúYou fucking assholes! Let me go!‚Äù

His screaming became muffling, when his cries were gagged.

‚ÄúYou promised!‚Äù He yelled, his cries collapsing into a sob. 

‚ÄúYou said if you took me, she wouldn't get hurt! So, where is she?‚Äù he met my gaze, his expression crumpling, something inside him coming apart, splintering by the seams. 

‚ÄúYou can't take *both* of us, this wasn't in the agreement!‚Äù 

When he was dragged further back, I noticed a car parked at the side of the road. 

The boy was pulled inside. At first, he refused, before an extra pair of hands shoved him. ‚ÄúYou fucking‚Äì *mmmphmmhphmmm*!‚Äù

I heard his fists slamming into the windows. 

‚ÄúDon't take me back there! Please! Just let Josie‚Äì‚Äù 

His cries once again collapsed into angry muffle screaming, and I felt my hands moving towards my pocket for my phone. 

This was a kidnapping, right? I was witnessing a kidnapping in broad fucking daylight. 

A shadow was suddenly in front of me, and I jumped, tearing my eyes from the car. Jasper, my colleague. He was still wearing his apron, and to my confusion, was swinging a carton of whole milk. 

‚ÄúSorry, Bree,‚Äù He winked, speaking in a  single breath. ‚ÄúAs you can see, our friend here had a *little* too much to drink.‚Äù

I nodded, craning my neck. Jasper stepped in front of me, maintaining a grin. 

‚ÄúWho is he?‚Äù This time, I side-stepped away from him, only for him to copy. 

‚ÄúJust a... guy.‚Äù He said. ‚ÄúAs you can see, he's a little‚Ä¶‚Äù Jasper prodded his right temple. ‚ÄúLet's just say he's got a few too many screws loose.‚Äù Jasper laughed, staying stock still, blocking my way. 

When I made a move to counter him, he stepped in front of me, his eyes hardening. ‚ÄúI heard he lost his family a while ago in a‚Ä¶‚Äù He pretended to think. ‚ÄúOh, yeah, a car crash. Maybe a gas explosion, I‚Äôm not really sure.‚Äù 

I could hear the car behind him, and once again I tried to dart past him. But he was quick to block my way. He was getting closer to me, very subtly backing me in the opposite direction. 

‚ÄúAnyway, this guy is kiiiiind of nuts. Dude still thinks he's got a sister.‚Äù

When I lost patience and shoved him out of the way, the car, and the guy, was gone. 

‚ÄúSee?‚Äù Jasper rolled his eyes. He was still holding milk from work. My head spun. 

It was 8pm, we were in a suburban neighborhood, and Jasper was holding half a pint of milk. His apron was stained with coffee, and when I really *looked* at him, I realized he was out of breath. 

He was doing a good job of hiding it, exhaling in intervals, swiping at his forehead to clear sweat. 

When I noticed, he pretended to run his hands through his hair. 

‚ÄúI, uh, I feel for him! Like, I'm sorry his family died, or whatever, but attacking random girls isn't cool, y‚Äôknow?‚Äù

Instead of replying, I stumbled home. It was sunny. 

At 8pm.

And when I took notice, I wasn't even wet. 

Esme was my last straw. I made a promise to myself to not get close to anyone. 

The guys and girls I met were friends, and nothing more. Weirdly enough, the only guy I was getting close to was my colleague. I don't know if it was brain damage, or I was finally losing the plot. 

But Jasper‚Äôs shameless cruelty towards customers, and that quirk in his lips when he made them cry, was kind of hot. 

However, he was playing hard to get. 

And I mean REALLY playing. 

I was in storage trying to find vegan milk, and he was suddenly a fucking expert, spewing milk facts. 

When I slammed the refrigerator door shut, he was inches from my face. 

In the dim light from a single spluttering bulb, his eyes reminded me of coffee grounds. I thought maybe he was going to kiss me, judging from his softening expression. I felt his hands go around my waist, and I felt myself immediately melt. 

I don't know what came over me. It's like, one minute I hated him, and the next‚Ä¶ I was suddenly hot. Really hot. And I really wanted to take my clothes off. I thought that's what he wanted to do too. 

I mean, his gaze followed mine, piercing, fingers playing with the buttons on his shirt. Before he leaned forward, his breath in my face. 

‚ÄúDid you know that Mulberry Farms is an award winning brand of milk in our town and ONLY our town? Mulberry farms was bred and made right here.""

And suddenly, I was no longer hot and bothered. 

‚ÄúI didn't.‚Äù I said, ducking into a crouch to search the shelves. ‚ÄúHave you seen our vegan milk? We did have some.‚Äù

‚ÄúThree *time* winner,‚Äù Jasper continued. When I jumped up, he stepped closer, and I felt my cheeks spark. His smile was rare. In fact, Jasper was only smiling when he was talking about *milk*. 

‚ÄúMulberry Farms have the best pasturization. It's suitable for everything! Coffee, cereal, or maybe you just want a glass of fresh milk to yourself! Perfect for kids, too! Breakfast time *is* Mulberry Farms.‚Äù

‚ÄúAre you having a stroke?‚Äù I whisper-shrieked. 

‚ÄúNope!‚Äù 

Jasper twisted around, shooting me a grin. 

I left the storage, however, with butterflies in my gut. 

There was no way I was falling for my asshole colleague. 

Somehow, though, I was. 

Just standing next to him filled me with electricity. 

The way he talked down to customers, insulting me to my face‚Ä¶ I was thoroughly, and disgustingly, in love. 

I tried to stop myself. 

I showered in ice cold water. 

I ate (choked on) a ghost pepper. 

I even asked my BROTHER for advice, who told me to go for it. 

I told him Jasper had one (of several) flaws, but this particular one was off-putting. 

‚ÄúHe‚Äôs obsessed with milk.‚Äù I told my brother. 

Harry lifted a brow. ‚ÄúIs that a euphemism, or‚Ä¶‚Äù

He paused, for way longer than necessary. ‚ÄúSo, your would-be-boyfriend has a milk fetish?‚Äù

I left his room before he could take that conversation further. 

I wanted to say Jasper was the only one who acted weird. 

But over the next few weeks, I noticed it in quite a few people. 

I was having breakfast with Mom, and she lifted up the box. 

‚ÄúChoco Flakes.‚Äù She blurted, ‚ÄúAren't they just the best?‚Äù

I nodded slowly. ‚ÄúYeah, Mom. They're great.‚Äù

I prodded the box with a smile. ‚ÄúOnly a dollar ninety nine.‚Äù

There were so many townspeople on their phones. They walked around with groceries or briefcases, their eyes glued to whatever they were swiping through. 

I was serving an old woman, when I caught her phone screen. 

I could have sworn there was an image of Jasper. 

She swiped right, and I had a hard time looking her in the eye. 

The woman was at least in her 80‚Äôs. And I'm talking, can barely walk, and needs assistance. 

Was she seriously hitting up 25 year old guys? 

Walking home, *everyone* was on their phones. 

I stopped at a crossing, stabbing the red light. 

It started to snow the second I stepped out onto the road, white flakes dancing in front of me. It didn't even cross my mind that it was almost June. The snow was pretty, accumulating on the ground. 

‚ÄúOh shit, sorry!‚Äù

Lifting my head, a guy was standing in front of me holding an umbrella. 

I knew him. 

But not from whatever was trying to pollute my mind. 

I knew him from a while ago. I knew him from the rain. I knew the bloody bandages wrapped around his head, and soulless, seething eyes I couldn't understand. It was the boy who was dragged away three months prior. 

He looked different, his hair was shorter, his face carved into a thing of beauty. 

The white strips of gauze bleeding scarlet were gone, his filthy clothes replaced with a white shirt and pants, a trench coat flung over the top. I didn't remember him being this handsome. His dark brown hair had been tamed and curled. 

It was his expression that sent shivers sliding down my spine. 

His too wide smile and unblinking eyes made me suddenly conscious of two bright lights on the two of us. 

So bright.

Something shattered in my mind, and I was aware of a lot of things. 

The snow under my feet was *too* soft. 

I glimpsed a single streak of red seeping from his nose, his hands trembling around a takeout coffee cup. 

Behind me, people were staring. I could see a group of teenage girls giggling. 

‚ÄúIt's him,‚Äù one of them squeaked. ‚ÄúIt's the new love interest!‚Äù

‚ÄúBree?‚Äù His grin widened, snowflakes prancing around us. His teeth gritted together. I could tell he hated every word. ‚ÄúHoly shit, long time no see!‚Äù

He held out his hand, and I could see visible pain contorting in his eyes. 

*Help me.* He was screaming through a twinkling smile. 

‚ÄúDon't you remember me? It's‚Ä¶ it's uh, it's Sam!‚Äù he laughed. ‚ÄúFrom eighth grade!‚Äù

The lights blinked out, and the thought crashed into my mind. Static images filling my head. I shook them away. 

Oh, yeah, it *was* Sam. 

My childhood friend. 

 But I didn't reply. Instead of saying, ‚ÄúSam? It's been so long!‚Äù I found myself walking, stumbling over to the girls. 

Who were rapidly swiping left on their phones. 

‚ÄúWhat's that?‚Äù I demanded in a sharp breath. 

I grabbed for the phone, only for Sam to step in front of me. He settled me with a smile. 

Behind me, one of the girls fainted. 

Sam‚Äôs smile didn't waver. Though he did side-eye the girl being carried away. ‚ÄúWhy don't I take you out for coffee?‚Äù

Apparently, *coffee* was the code word for hooking up. 

Sam dragged me into the nearest coffee store, straight to the bathroom. 

When he shoved me into a stall, I didn't know what to say. 

‚ÄúTake off your shoes,‚Äù he said in a hiss, and after hesitating, I did. 

Sam pulled off his jacket, shook snow out of his hair, and got real close. 

‚ÄúLook up.‚Äù He murmured. 

I did, my gaze finding the ceiling. 

‚ÄúTo your right, a camera is very well hidden, but can be seen with the naked eye if you catch what looks like a red laser,‚Äù Sam said. 

‚ÄúTo your left, another camera, as well as a vent that is currently pumping the stalls with aphrodisiacs. And right now, we are in the red zone. Meaning, you should be conscious.‚Äù

He prodded me, and I flinched. 

‚ÄúMostly conscious.‚Äù

His words went right over my head, my mind was foggy. 

I couldn't think straight.

I think I asked him what he was saying, but my mouth was filled with cotton. 

‚ÄúSnap out of it,‚Äù he said, ‚ÄúLike I said, they're *making* you feel like this.‚Äù

He shoved me against the door, which broke me out of my trance. Slightly. 

‚ÄúI hate what I'm going to say right now,‚Äù Sam groaned, tipping his head back. 

He was sweating, I noticed. 

Bad. I glimpsed beads of red pooling down his neck. He noticed me staring. 

‚ÄúI'm okay, for now. I‚Äôm faulty, so the connection is severed. He squeezed his eyes shut. ‚ÄúI‚Ä¶think.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat are you talking about?‚Äù

‚ÄúSex.‚Äù He said, blinking rapidly. I wasn't going to comment on his slurring voice. 

Sam stumbled, fresh blood dripping from his nose. 

‚ÄúWe need to do the sex. Like‚Ä¶‚Äù His eyes rolled into the back of his head, but he managed to stabilise himself. ‚ÄúNooooow.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat?!‚Äù

‚ÄúIs everything okay in there?‚Äù 

The voice was a woman. She knocked on the stall. 

Sam‚Äôs eyes widened, coming back to life a little. ‚ÄúThey're paranoid,‚Äù he whispered. When I could only stare at him, he pounded his fists into the door. 

‚ÄúThey think we‚Äôre fucking,‚Äù he hissed, ‚ÄúSo, we need to make it believable.‚Äù

*‚ÄúThey?‚Äù* I mouthed. 

He didn't reply, swiping at his haemorrhaging nose. ‚ÄúJust‚Ä¶ move around against the door. That'll fool ‚Äòem.‚Äù

I did, doing my best to shuffle around, slamming my back against the lock.

When the metal clanged, he shot me a look. ‚ÄúI said sex!‚Äù He hissed, ‚ÄúNot murder!‚Äù 

Sam jumped onto the toilet bowl. There was an open window above him. 

*‚ÄúThat's enough.‚Äù* He mouthed, hoisting his way through. 

He helped me through, and I expected to land on concrete. 

What I did land on, however, was something‚Ä¶ squishy. 

Something wet sliding between my bare toes. 

Looking closer, I recognised the beaded anklet. 

Fishnet tights. 

Something animalistic clawed from my throat. I was standing on Esme. Or what was *left* of Esme. She was just a torso and legs, the rest of her ripped away like doll pieces. I couldn't see her face. I looked for it, digging through what could only be old flesh and pieces of limbs. 

I felt suffocated. I grabbed half of Ben‚Äôs face that had been ripped off, and then Alex‚Äôs tattooed arm. 

There was so *much* of them, piles and piles of the same heads, the same filthy and rotting clothes. I was screaming by the time I shuffled back on my hands and knees, trying to wipe them off of my skin. 

They were all over me, staining me, painting me. 

Sam‚Äôs hand slick with blood gently covered my mouth. 

‚ÄúStay calm, all right?‚Äù He whispered. ‚ÄúI would tell you everything is going to be okay, but the truth is, it's really *not*, there's like, a 99.9% chance you're going to‚Ä¶ understandably freak out.‚Äù

He pulled me to my feet, letting out a heavy breath. 

Blinking rapidly, I could only see‚Ä¶ pieces. 

Pieces of *people*. 

Legs and heads and torsos all piled into one mass of gore. 

‚ÄúWe‚Äôve got maybe five minutes before they realize we‚Äôre not doing the devil's dance,‚Äù Sam sniffled, ‚ÄúMaybe ten, before my brain short circuits and I bleed out.‚Äù

I didn't know I was hyperventilating, until I couldn't fucking breathe. 

Closer towards the door, and I could hear‚Ä¶ machinery. 

I couldn't stop myself. Even when I was aware I was standing in congealing blood. 

Rotten bodies. 

The dim light led me into what could only be described as a factory. There were three levels, and we were on the highest. 

Sam stepped forward, gripping the metal bar in front of us. I felt my legs buckling, a thick, pukey slime filling my mouth. 

‚ÄúSoo, I guess it all started when Brianna Timberman was seventeen years old, and rejected by her childhood best friend, Sam Thwaites.‚Äù

Sam‚Äôs words collapsed into a low buzzing in my ear. 

All I could see was a conveyer belt, filled with‚Ä¶ people. 

Boys. 

Girls.

But most noticeably, Ben‚Äôs, Alex‚Äôs, Esme‚Äôs, and *Sam‚Äôs.*

But they start as Ben‚Äôs, Alex's, and Esme‚Äôs. 

I could see regular people, their hair stripped away. 

Their skin sliced into, cruelly moulding them into the exact same four faces. 

When a large looming needle plunged into the back of an Alex‚Äôs head, I couldn't *not* watch. I waited for the guy to wake up, but I don't even think he was alive. 

He stood, unblinking, letting this thing twist and contort his face. 

And it was then, when I realized these things weren't even human. 

I could see the mechanics built under their flesh, both living tissue and metal melded together. 

‚ÄúBrianna‚Äôs father, who is a liiiitle on the crazy side, with too much cash and not not enough logic, took his daughter‚Äôs rejection a little *too* personally,‚Äù Sam continued. 

‚ÄúSo, he promised his daughter he would find her the perfect match.‚Äù

I started to speak, the words coming out before I could stop them. 

‚ÄúMy father would never‚Äì‚Äù

‚ÄúI didn't say it was *your* father,‚Äù Sam said. His eyes darkened. 

‚ÄúAnyway, as I was saying, the townspeople became unhealthily obsessed with who Brianna would choose.""

He sighed. ""So obsessed, in fact, that the girl‚Äôs day to day life was broadcasted across town, while her potential love interests were ranked, week after week. Think of it like the Truman Show mixed with matchmaker. First, there was Ben.‚Äù

Sam‚Äôs smile thinned. ‚ÄúHer high school boyfriend.‚Äù

Sam shrugged. ‚ÄúShe grew bored of him. Also, he kinda did something unforgivable.‚Äù

He continued. ‚ÄúThen‚Ä¶ Alex. She liked him, but sometimes, he was a little too unserious. The guy was a clown.‚Äù

I backed away, but he was quick to grab my shoulders. 

‚ÄúFinally? Esme. Who she truly fell for.‚Äù

I swallowed. ‚ÄúEsme is‚Äì‚Äù

He cut me off. ‚ÄúBut I didn't mention that they hurt her, did I?‚Äù 

Sam leaned against the bar. Behind him, I could see a figure in white pushing a gurney with a Ben strapped to it. 

‚ÄúBen tried to assault her, insisting she *wanted* it. Alex dumped her on her birthday. Esme ended their relationship with a one word text. *Goodbye*.‚Äù

Sam mimed an explosion. ‚ÄúThat was the nail in the coffin.‚Äù

I caught blood sliding down his nose. ‚ÄúYou're still bleeding.‚Äù 

Sam gingerly prodded his nose. 

‚ÄúUrgh. Yeah, it's an effect of the severing. I've been in the red zone too long. I should probably speed this up.‚Äù

He talked faster, his voice collapsing into a mumbled slur. 

‚ÄúBrianna couldn't take it. Her best friend was ignoring her. Everyone she had fallen in love with hurt her. Esme wasn't returning her calls. Ben was sleeping around right in front of her, and Alex was still being a clown. Brianna‚Äôs poor parents found her hanging from her bedroom ceiling fan.‚Äù

I shook my head, my thoughts screaming. 

‚ÄúNo‚Äì‚Äù

He held a finger up to shush me. ‚ÄúLet me talk. Jeez.‚Äù

Sam folded his arms. ‚ÄúA grieving father would do anything to avenge his dead child, buuut‚Ä¶ Mr Timberman took ‚Äòfinding a perfect match‚Äô and ‚Äòthe show must go on‚Äô a little bit too literally.‚Äù

His sickly smile found me. 

‚ÄúThe town wanted more of Brianna, and her life, so he turned his daughter‚Äôs failed love life into a town wide TV show, sending the entire teen populace into here,‚Äù he gestured around him. 

‚ÄúTo make the *perfect* suitors. Who *wouldn't* hurt his *new* Brianna.‚Äù

Something ice cold crept down my spine. 

He cleared his throat. ‚ÄúMr Timberman grew, let's say, obsessed, with getting revenge on these specific four people. So, he started killing them‚Äì‚Äù He coughed. 

‚ÄúSorry. Us. Killing us for the funny ha-ha, ‚ÄòLook at how many times I can fuck with them!‚Äô bit. And then recycling us into someone completely different.""

""Our names are gone. Then our personalities. Finally, our bodies ripped to pieces and sculpted into Brianna‚Äôs exes.‚Äù Sam poked me in the cheek. 

‚ÄúThe cycle continues. They reset your ticker and the town eats it up. They can bring back Esme, Ben, and Alex whenever they want and add curveballs.""

""Like the *bad-boy* colleague who becomes the fan favorite.‚Äù Sam‚Äôs lips curved. ‚ÄúFor‚Ä¶ some fucking reason.‚Äù

His eyes flickered open. ‚ÄúHowever, Brianna will never find a suitor because her father is a fucking  sociopath. To him and the town, his dead daughter‚Äôs pathetic love life is entertainment.‚Äù

He held out his arm. 

‚ÄúSee?‚Äù

I tried really hard not to look through the makeup. 

At noticeable skin grafts. 

‚ÄúI was a Ben.‚Äù He said. ‚ÄúThen I was an Alex, and *then* I was an extra.‚Äù His eyes found mine, sad, suddenly. ‚ÄúBut who I was originally is kinda gone. All I remember is a deal to protect Josie. I gave myself up so they wouldn't take her.‚Äù

‚ÄúYour sister.‚Äù I said. 

Sam nodded. 

His earlier words hit me. He was talking like Brianna Timberman was dead. 

But *I* was Brianna Timberman. 

I was rejected by Sam, yes, but I found Ben. 

As if he could read my mind, Sam shook his head. 

‚ÄúLook at yourself.‚Äù He said, his voice shaking. 

‚ÄúAnd I mean *really* look at yourself.‚Äù 

Sam stepped closer. 

‚ÄúBecause, underneath all of that make-up and the prosthetics and surgery, and fucked up memories, you're just another recycled lump of flesh.‚Äù

He prodded my temple. ‚ÄúWho *thinks* she is Brianna Timberman.‚Äù

His voice was slurring again, a fresh stream of scarlet seeping down his chin. 

‚ÄúDon't you want to know?‚Äù His eyes rolled to pearly whites. 

Before he could finish his sentence, Sam dropped to the ground. 

I remember warm arms grasping hold of me. 

Shadows with no faces. 

They pricked me twice in the back of my neck. 

A familiar voice in my ear, almost a hiss. 

*Jasper*. 

‚ÄúYou are the *worst* fucking Brianna.‚Äù He murmured. ""Like, dude, it's *painful* to be with you.""*

When I came to, I was standing up, somehow. 

At *work*.

**I am Brianna Timberman.**

The thought floated around in my head, my memory hazy. 

‚ÄúHello?!‚Äù

A man was waving his hands in front of me. 

‚ÄúI asked for iced coffee, lady!‚Äù

Jasper was serving another customer. ‚ÄúBree, wake the fuck up.‚Äù

They were trying to make me think I was hallucinating. 

Which was crazy, because my fingernails were still tinted with Sam‚Äôs blood. 

The marks he'd left on my wrist when he was yanking me, were still there. 

Bruised on my arm. 

‚ÄúBree!‚Äù Jasper snapped. ‚ÄúSnap out of it and make the dude his drink.‚Äù

‚ÄúRight.‚Äù

The word slipped out of my mouth.

He caught my eye, winking, and Brianna Timberman internally squeaked. 

I half wondered what he was. Was he recycled, or an unwilling performer?

Throughout the day, I was fully aware my words were not mine. 

Like I was on autopilot. 

But not just that. 

My *thoughts* weren't mine, either.

I spent half of my shift staring at my colleague‚Äôs biceps. 

During my break, I went into the bathroom and stood in front of the mirror. 

I *am* Brianna Timberman. 

But even when I told myself that, my eyes were too blue.

My smile was too perfect. 

My teeth. 

Too white. 

My shaking hands prodded at my face, at someone else's face. 

So many faces, so many skin grafts. 

The thought was violent, sending tremors through me. 

How many people was I *wearing*? 

I started to claw at my arms and legs, my face. 

How many fucking people had I been? 

I grabbed a knife and tried to slice at my face.

 But there was no blood. 

How could there be no blood?!

When I got home, I found my family waiting for me. 

Mom, Dad and Harry, all of them beaming. 

‚ÄúBree!‚Äù Mom stood up, her lips stretching into a grin. 

My mouth was already moving, but they were not my words. 

‚ÄúMom!‚Äù 

I didn't know why she was smiling so much, until I saw Sam sitting at our dining room table. His smile was too big. 

His over-expensive shirt and pants did not suit him, and looked fucking gross, but somehow my brain thought it was hot. The worst part is, I couldn't and still can't tell which Sam he was. 

Was he the guy who told me the horrific reality of my existence? 

Or was he another recycled, mindless suitor? 

‚ÄúThis is Samuel.‚Äù Mom said, and Sam slowly stood. 

He took slow steps towards me, and kissed my hand.

I saw the slightest smudge of scarlet on his lip, but his eyes were blank. 

In the corner of my eye, my ‚Äòfather‚Äôs‚Äô eyes were glittering. 

‚ÄúHello, Brianna.‚Äù Sam said, and I *swore* Now that I was awake, the walls were wolf-whistling. Laughing. 

*""Ooooooooooooooo!‚Äù*

My town is a blip on the map. 

I keep thinking if I tear at my skin, I will find who I am underneath. 

I don't bleed. 

I don't think who I *was* still exists under so many layers. But even if this is just a cry into the void, please help us. 

I don't *want* to be Brianna Timberman.",1,1746306771.0,Malliem,0,1.0,False

Probably one of my FAVORITE Phish experiences. I wish I would have gotten more pictures of the festival grounds for memories but I was 100% not on my phone and present for the entire festival. It was also my first festival 100% sober. 

I keep going back to it, so many great moments: 

Your Pet Cat that was my first time hearing it live, Reba, Carini, and Martin Monster were some of my favorite songs

Good memories too: when the guy from the audience just straight up walked on stage, dropped a glowstick at Trey's feet, then walked away, the cardboard tower, the rain storm that never happened-briefly happened-then the giant rainbow that appeared as everyone was leaving the festival, even the ice coffee was on another level.

He has missing teeth, and complains every day of some major new ailment but will not seek healthcare. As far as I can tell, he only eats when he's at work, and that's the breakroom snacks & coffee. I recently had to tell him not to arrive 1.5 hours before his shift so that he could have food and coffee. He has the resources, but not the will to take responsibility for himself, and prefers to present as a perpetual victim. 

However, that's not really the issue, but it adds to the overall dissatisfaction. The issue is that he's been an employee for three years now, and just can't seem to manage any kind of tech or on-the-spot critical thinking. He still does not know how to log his hours on the app everyone here uses. He can't do even basic troubleshooting with the internet or computer glitches at the register. He says he doesn't have internet at his apartment, can't figure out how to add the schedule or communications apps to his phone, so he has to use the computer at work. 

Additionally, he cannot seem to function if he is told to do something that is not in his usual routine, including asking problem customers to stop what they're doing or leave, working on an extra project, get supplies from our supply closet in the building next door, use the barcode scanner, etc. He seems to just freeze with anxiety if ANYthing happens that's unusual.

I've tried over time to add to his usefulness by cross-training, which I do with all employees, but he can't or won't learn, and can't manage the stress of being asked to to it. He's so afraid of being fired every time my business partner walks in, that he'll talk nonstop to him in his anxious state, even missing customers who come in. 

So over time, I'm realizing that we have accommodated him to such a degree that it's almost a babysitting job now to keep him on.

I want to scale the business and am putting employees in who have additional skills and who can effectively cross-train. I'm paying them more as well. The company has grown and new systems have been put in place. He's no longer the average employee, and is now the weakest link. 

The trouble is that he hasn't changed. The business has. And he works the guilt trips hard when I reduce hours in the off season, which I do every year. I'm just tired of hearing his sob stories every day, and asking him to use the tech we have, and having to accommodate his inability to keep up or take care of himself. 

I've had meetings with him. But nothing ever changes. I know I should let him go, but I don't know what ""just cause"" would be. And I feel like I'm dooming him to homelessness if I do it. Help me work up the guts to do what I need to do.

1ke340q,https://www.reddit.com/r/OvenMasters/comments/1ke340q/does_the_mecity_t88a_toaster_truly_deliver_with/,Does the Mecity T-88A Toaster Truly Deliver with Touchscreen Features Review?,"The Mecity T-88A Toaster with its modern, sleek design landed on my kitchen counter recently, and I couldn‚Äôt wait to dig into its features to see if it lived up to its promises. You know that feeling when a new appliance can completely change your morning routine? That‚Äôs what I hoped for here. Armed with its stainless steel housing and tech-forward approach, it promised more than your average toaster. But daily use often peels back all the layers ‚Äî the good, the bad, and the ‚Äúwhy did they do this?‚Äù

**Design and Build Quality**  
This toaster looks fantastic. It‚Äôs brushed stainless steel with a contemporary finish that screams ‚Äúpremium.‚Äù For a device that proudly occupies kitchen counter space, it blends nicely with a variety of modern appliances I own. The compact size (10.4""D x 11.2""W x 7.1""H) is reasonable for a 4-slice toaster and fits comfortably without taking up excessive room. The touchscreen display is a highlight here. With two large 4.4-inch screens, it‚Äôs not only intuitive but looks futuristic. Navigating the touch functions felt sleek, with icons that are easy to understand even before coffee fully kicks in. On the downside, the stainless steel surface can attract smudges quickly, and keeping it spotless is a bit of work ‚Äì something that my more OCD-inclined friends would absolutely hate!

**Performance in Daily Use**  
From a performance perspective, it‚Äôs a bit of a game-changer. It has six browning levels and three programs (Bagel, Defrost, and Reheat). The convenience of multiple browning settings became obvious when my cousin visited. She loves super crispy bread while I lean more toward lightly toasted. We could set each side independently, thanks to the dual control panels. It‚Äôs both quirky and useful, allowing for customization right down to the exact level of crunch. Additionally, the defrost feature saved a frozen bagel emergency when I was running late for work. Absolutely no complaints about even toasting either, which is a big bonus over cheaper models that tend to leave one side burnt and the other underdone.  

[Check Mecity T-88A price on Amazon.](https://chpizza.com/p/b0cg5p9hx5/)

**Ease of Cleaning**  
Cleaning this toaster is refreshingly simple. The crumb tray slides out effortlessly, and the slots themselves are non-stick and food-grade stainless steel. Over a month of usage, I‚Äôve rarely had to scrub aggressively to clean up melted cheese messes from testing a questionable sandwich experiment. I can‚Äôt say the same for the cheaper models that often leave you digging endlessly at corners.

**Pros**  
- The intuitive touchscreen design enhances ease of use.  
- Superb toast consistency even with unevenly cut bread.  
- Dual control panels make multi-preference toasting possible.  
- Versatile options for bagels, frozen items, and reheating.  
- Easy-to-clean, non-stick design saves cleanup time.  

**Critiques**  
- Stainless steel finish is prone to fingerprints.  
- The touchscreen interface, while elegant, can be tricky for users with wet fingers.  
- Browning settings, despite aiming for six precise levels, sometimes feel minimally different.  

**Market Rivals**  
Comparing this toaster to other options in its price range made things interesting. I briefly tested the Breville BTA830XL and the Cuisinart CPT-440, both of which offer similar 4-slice designs. The Breville model boasts a ""Lift and Look"" feature, letting you peek mid-toasting without resetting, something the Mecity lacks. On the other hand, it‚Äôs significantly pricier and doesn‚Äôt have dual controls for setting separate browning levels for different slots.  

The Cuisinart CPT-440 has motorized lift levers, which feel slightly over-engineered but add to the premium factor. However, its reheat performance wasn‚Äôt as good ‚Äì it seemed to dry out bread. The Mecity struck the balance in my trials by being the most consistent with toasting levels while offering more comprehensive touchscreen controls, which the competitors aren‚Äôt equipped with.  

**Bang for the Buck**  
In terms of price-to-quality ratio, the Mecity T-88A toaster holds its own. At a glance, it might seem priced slightly higher than traditional toasters, yet the added technology and flexibility justify the upgrade. If you frequently use multi-slice toasting or prefer dialed-in features like defrost and precision browning, it‚Äôs worth springing for this model. Durability will be the real test over time, but early impressions leave little concern about long-term issues. Build-wise, it feels solid and far more robust than cheaper alternatives I‚Äôve cycled through in the past.

1ke3400,https://www.reddit.com/r/OvenMasters/comments/1ke3400/does_wunly_kst075au_toaster_deliver_on_features/,Does WUNLY KST075AU Toaster Deliver on Features and Performance Review for Kitchen Users?,"The WUNLY KST075AU, boasting a sleek stainless steel build and a modern, touch-screen interface, has found a permanent spot on my kitchen counter. Despite me being skeptical about the hype around ""smart"" toasters, I decided to test out this beauty extensively before forming an opinion. Spoiler: It‚Äôs not just shiny‚Äîit‚Äôs actually functional, with some slight quirks.

**Design and Build Quality That Shines**  
This brushed stainless steel toaster has a minimalistic and modern aesthetic that manages to fit seamlessly in most kitchen settings. The material feels solid to the touch, and the overall weight of 4.11 pounds gives it just the right level of heft‚Äîlight enough to move around but heavy enough to sit sturdily on the counter. The LED touchscreen display is what catches everyone‚Äôs eye immediately; the bright visuals feel like they belong more to a fancy gadget than a humble bread-crisper. I‚Äôve had relatives come over, poke at it, and say, ‚ÄúWoah, your toaster has a screen?‚Äù If nothing else, it‚Äôs good for sparking kitchen conversations.

**Highlights**  
- User-friendly and vibrant LED touchscreen that eliminates guesswork.  
- Modern brushed stainless steel finish, sturdy yet lightweight.  
- Compact size (12.25""D x 9.25""W x 7.72""H) that avoids being a counter space hog.

**Performance Meets Versatility**  
Using this toaster brought a level of customization I never thought I needed. Its 6 bread-type presets (regular bread, bagels, English muffins, etc.) and 6 shade settings had me experimenting daily. No two pieces of toast ever turned out the exact same, and I mean this in the best possible way. My go-to is sourdough on shade setting 4 (yes, this is how nerdy I‚Äôve gotten about toast). On bagel mode, it does an excellent job of toasting the cut side while keeping the uncut side soft and warm‚Äîperfect for a thick bagel schmear. The 850-watt power level ensures that everything gets evenly toasted without those frustrating half-burned spots. Defrosting frozen bread was a revelation, taking just 30 seconds and always coming out warm and fluffy.

**Good Points**  
- Wide slots accommodate bagels, thick slices, and even oddly shaped homemade bread.  
- Easy-to-use bagel, defrost, and cancel functions for more control.  
- Consistently even toasting across all bread types.  

**Sound Features: Useful or Annoying?**  
One of the more polarizing aspects of this product is its sound functionality. It gives out alerts when you select settings, start toasting, and when it‚Äôs done. This takes ""letting you know your toast is done"" to a whole new level. While I personally didn‚Äôt mind it chirping once my English muffin was ready, guests did find the sound to be a tad intrusive during our otherwise quiet morning coffee sessions. Luckily, muting the alerts is as simple as holding down the cancel button.

**Caveats**  
- Sound notifications may feel excessive unless muted.  
- The touchscreen, though innovative, might occasionally lag after long-term use.  

**Competing Brands**  
Now, let‚Äôs talk rivals. Instant Pot‚Äôs Omni toaster oven offers similar functionality with wider slots, but its lack of a touchscreen interface makes it harder to refine the process for bagels or specialty breads. Breville‚Äôs Smart Toaster, which I‚Äôve also dabbled with, leans pricier and doesn‚Äôt handle defrost cycles as speedily as this one. While those competitors excel at one niche (Breville for durability, and Instant Pot for size), this WUNLY toaster brings an all-rounded mix of convenience and tech.

**Affordable Quality**  
Sliding into the mid-tier price range, this digital toaster doesn‚Äôt necessarily scream luxury, but its feature set offers a balanced value for price. Sure, some may balk at paying more for a screen, but the added precision is hard to go back from. Plus, considering it comes with a 12-month guarantee, you‚Äôre getting peace of mind. Believe me, you'd miss features like bagel mode and toasting presets if you ever had to downgrade.

1ke33ox,https://www.reddit.com/r/spinalfusion/comments/1ke33ox/my_experience_l4l5l5s1_fusion_very_long/,My Experience- L4-L5/L5-S1 fusion ( very long. :) ),"I wanted to post about my **GOOD** experience with this type of surgery, hopefully it will calm the fears some may have. I am very lucky to be in a city (Austin, Texas) where there are fine surgeons who know their stuff, and I am grateful for their expertise. I am also privileged and very grateful to be in a spot where I can undertake this procedure without fear of loss of work or lack of support. 

**Trigger warning:** I got a potty mouth, so there may be some swearing ahead.

**A little background:**  
I started with excruciating sciatic pain in November of last year. I happened to have had my yearly physical at the same time, and my provider recommended Airrosti treatment.  

For those who never heard of Airrosti: It's DEEP massage- and I mean DEEP. Hurts like a bitch...in the best way and prescribed exercises to do at home.  I went to around 5 sessions, and at first, it REALLY helped. For the first time in weeks, I was pain-free. I also tried Steroid packs- a 6 day course TWICE. It helped while I was on it. However, after the 3rd or 4th session, it stopped working, and the pain came back just as bad as before. My Airrosti doctor discontinued my treatment at that time and ordered an MRI. Make sure your Airrosti doctor listens to you and does not give you false hope. My doctor was excellent and I really loved his approach and his willingness to admit he wasn't able to help me. 

I had made an appointment with a pain management doctor who just so happened to be my Airrosti doctor's acquaintance and was going to refer  me to him anyway. I was not looking for pain medication as I am allergic to most of the common ones, I was looking for possible steroid injection. The pain management Doctor looked at the results of the MRI and was like, ""Pretty damn gnarly."" The results were bad. My discs basically were shot to shit (I have Degenerative disc disorder- fun times!) and impinging on my nerves big time. That's the simplified explanation. My pain management guy sent me to a Neurosurgeon. The neurosurgeon's first response was, ""How are you functioning?"" I laughed and  my response was, ""Gotta do what you gotta do I guess. I am woman, hear me roar."" :)

So, my neurosurgeon gave me the choice of 3 procedures: one offered a possible 40% chance it would work, but was simple and would not have a lot of recovery time. The next offered 60% chance it would work and was a bit more detailed with a bit longer recovery time. The third was the fusion. Much more of an in-depth procedure with a longer recovery time, but was ""almost"" 100% going to work. I opted for the third one. 

The third way is the most invasive, involving 2 surgeons and a longer surgery. It took some time to get in with the Vascular surgeon who would be opening me up from the front to allow the Neurosurgeon to access my spine from the front for the first part of the surgery, but eventually I got in and he agreed to do the surgery.

Then came the old insurance approval song and dance, but eventually my insurance approved the surgery. What I was looking at is this: Long surgery involving 2 surgeons, incisions front and back, and a long hospital stay. What I got was: 6 hour surgery by 2 of the finest surgeons in the city, 2 incisions, and 5 days in the hospital post-op.

**Pre-op:**  
I had the surgery on April 17th. I arrived bright and early on that day and was the first into theater. Thankfully. I hate late surgery times. It was really cool to see all the equipment they were going to use and I met all the techs and nurses. It may be intimidating to some people who aren't expecting this. There's lots of machines. Lots of bells and whistles. Ask questions and understand that these people know their shit and are there to help you. 

**Thanks to people on this subreddit, I was prepared. I got the following set-up at home:**

1.  Bedrail to help with movement 
2. Shower chair 
3. Picker-upper-grabby thing to help retrieve things from the floor. I had no idea I dropped so many things. lol
4. I wore a loose dress and slide on shoes to the hospital. This came in handy since I had to wear a hugerific brace.

From the hospital bed, I also ordered a walker that came in handy for the first day or so at home.

I knew bathing was going to be a problem after the surgery as well as hair washing. 

**I also:**

1. Washed my hair thoroughly
2. got a GOOD bath and grooming in (shaved, pedicured)
3. used that wonderful 3-day deodorant they have now.   
4. I also had to use Hibiclens the night before and the morning of surgery. This is an antiseptic soap that is used to clean the skin of bacteria before surgery. There is a generic available- I got mine at CVS and paid around 12 bucks for it. You can also use things like Dial that are antiseptic and probably cheaper if cost is a concern. My husband also had surgery planned and he needed to use it as well. But I still have a lot left.

**ALERTS about grooming stuff:**

1. Self-tanning: If you self-tan like me...don't. Exfoliate that crap off.  lol. All the tapes and stuff that were used on me left big pale spots when removed. But I did get compliments before going into surgery about how good my tan was! lol
2. Manicures: For those who get their nails done, get them done, but cut short. My nail guy cut them MUCH shorter than I usually wear them and painted them a neutral color so it won't show as much when they grow out. I do the dipping powder stuff, and there was no problem with the finger sensors used in hospital settings- for things like oxygen level and pulse.
3. Long Hair: For those with long hair like me- bring a soft scrunchie to keep your hair up and allow you to sleep on pillows. I had used a plastic clip to put my hair up going to the hospital but switched to the scrunchie to keep my hair out of the way. Adjusting my hair was a problem before I scrunchied it. If you have long hair, you know what I mean. Getting it out from behind your back and to the side so you aren't snatching yourself bald when you move or getting it trapped behind you. 

**What I brought to the hospital:**

1. Case for my glasses
2. A small baggy for my ear gauges and my rings
3. My Kindle - in a small suitcase I left in the car for my family to bring me later
4. Pajamas ( I had used the excuse of surgery to splurge on new jammies from Macy's- the ""Backstage"" clearance section! They have such good deals.)  - in the suitcase
5. clean undies  - in the suitcase
6. hairbrush  - in the suitcase
7. toothbrush  - in the suitcase
8.  toothpaste - in the suitcase
9. my many lotions- body, face, my precious Tretinoin for my face, etc.  - in the suitcase

  
The only thing I used was my hairbrush,pajamas, and undies. So, keep that in mind when you pack. I also had high hopes of cross stitching- that never happened. lol

  
**Medications:**

**If you are on ""uncommon"" medications like I am, bring the bottles with you.** 

I had to have 2 of my medications brought to the hospital by my husband. The staff then sent them to the pharmacy, and they dosed them out accordingly. Unfortunately, I also left them behind when I was discharged, and it was a bit difficult to get them back. If you bring them in- don't forget to ask for them before you leave. 

**Post-op Experience**

As stated earlier, I went into the hospital on April 17th. I have no clue what time it was that I arrived in my room but here is recap of what was going on:

1. I was groggy and in a fair bit of pain. That I believe was mainly due to being transferred and jostled around getting settled in bed. 
2. I was hooked up to a ""drug machine"" known as a PCA (Patient Controlled Analgesia) I was able to hit the button every 8 minutes to get a dose of Dilaudid for my pain. 
3. I had another IV running fluids and allowing the nurses to push IV antibiotics and muscle relaxers. 
4. I had a catheter in. I had been really fearful of having one post-op but it was a godsend. Getting up to use the bathroom immediately post-op or using a bed pan would have been exceedingly difficult. Thankfully it really did not hurt at all nor did it feel ""weird."" 
5. I had a clear dressing over my abdominal incision which was closed with skin glue.
6. My back incision was not dressed but was covered in skin glue that they used instead of sutures to close it. 
7. I had 2 drains in my back which were long enough that they were held in a pocket in my hospital gown in the front. 
8. I was on a clear liquid diet which progressed to a regular diet eventually.

The night of my surgery I got out of bed with the help of the nurse and patient care tech and a walker. I got incredibly dizzy and nauseous so they sat me down but in the morning I was able to get up and move to a chair. 

After about 48 hours, they removed the catheter and the IV drip but kept the IV to push drugs as needed. I was able to put on underwear and my pajama bottoms. 

**My pain level:**

I was not in a great deal of pain. The combination of the PCA Dilaudid and the IV muscle relaxer kept me...not pain-free...but fairly comfortable. 

I was visited by Physical Therapy who got me walking in the hallway a bit. I was transported in my bed to xray to have an xray of my back done. The staff was very helpful when I had to stand and turn and such. 

I began to walk more in the room and ambulate to the bathroom on my own once the catheter was out. My nurse was NOT pleased with me doing this alone but I am stubborn. Don't be like me. Ask for help. I am a former nurse and we make the WORST patients. I used a walker and had to use a back brace every time I ambulated. Both were essential. It was not easy to get my brace on and pull down my pants in order to sit on the toilet. Help is good. Ask for it. 

I also was able to get myself into my chair to sit up. I did that many times during the day and every time I ate. 

**Bowel Stuff AKA probably TMI for some, but essential to know:**

I was asked frequently by the nurses and providers, ""Have you passed gas yet?"" This question may be embarrassing to some people, but trust me, as a former nurse who took care of a LOT of post-op patients, it's necessary. 

The combination of abdominal surgery, narcotics, decreased movement, and lack of eating can cause your bowels to slow or even stop. This is bad. The medical staff will listen to ensure they can hear ""bowel sounds"" and ask if you have tooted yet to ensure there is no blockage or paralysis of your bowels. I had bowel sounds but did not pass gas for awhile. They kept me on clear liquids until the great hour arrived that I could proudly announce, ""I passed gas!"" I have little shame when it comes to this stuff, which I believe comes from my medical experiences and a family who was open about this stuff, but PLEASE, if you are sensitive, realize that the medical staff are only asking to ensure you are not heading into trouble. Be honest. 

I got moved to a regular diet. They also gave me what they said was a ""stool softener."" They asked me if I wanted a laxative. I declined because historically, laxatives have me go from one extreme to the other. Meaning- Constipation to Diarrhea, no in between. So eventually after a bit of anxiety at the lack of bowel movement- I moved. Huzzah. lol  However, I then quickly realized the ""stool softener"" was a softener AND laxative. So I was in the bathroom frequently. Please, if you are like me and sensitive to laxatives, clarify with the nurse what they are giving. The draw back to having to rush to the bathroom was that I was not in ""rushable"" shape and I had several close calls, and several times I had to forgo putting on my brace in order to get to the bathroom. 

So do yourself a favor. Ask. Don't be afraid to question. 

  
They discontinued my pain-button on the third day and moved me to Tramadol and the muscle relaxer. I was put on Tramadol due to being allergic to narcotics such as Hydrocodone and Oxycodone. 

**A word about Tramadol:**

Tramadol works for me. I know some people feel that it doesn't work. Tramadol doesn't make me feel ""high"" like other opioids. When I have questioned people about it not working for them, several told me it didn't ""feel"" like pain medicine in that it did not give them that high. Give it a chance if you are put on it. You may not get that ""high"" but it was an effective pain reliever. If it truly does not work, don't be afraid to tell your Provider. 

  
Unfortunately, my sciatic pain returned. This was not fun. I realized and had my thoughts confirmed that it was the inflammation in my back causing this so I dealt with it. The Tramadol worked to alleviate the surgical pain and the IV muscle relaxers helped with that as well but as we all know, nerve pain is a different animal. I just dealt with it and it came and went frequently. I was offered Gabapentin but declined. I am one of those people who gains weight on Gabapentin. More on that later.

I also had swelling in my legs and feet which is a side effect of the surgery and lack of movement. I had ""cankles"" and my feet looked terrible. This eventually started to go away once I was up and moving more and when sitting I kept my feet elevated. When in bed, I raised the foot of my bed as much as I could tolerate. If you have concerns about this post-op, please ask if compression stockings are appropriate for you. They help somewhat to minimize swelling. They can be uncomfortable because they are extremely tight and you WILL need help putting them on and taking them off. They are that tight. 

I declined the stockings and just tried to move more frequently and elevate my legs and feet. 

**On Moving and Walking:**

**Do it. Even if it hurts.** 

**Do it. Even if you are weak.** 

**Do it.** 

**Ask for help. Use a walker.** 

**Just do it. \*insert Nike swoosh here\***

Laying in bed is bad for you. It can cause the aforementioned swelling as well as constipation and worse- Deep Vein Thrombosis. 

Deep Vein Thrombosis or DVT is caused by your blood pooling and clotting in one place, most frequently in your lower legs. This leads to terrible pain, swelling, and the necessity to administer blood thinners. The clot can also break off and travel to your lungs causing a Pulmonary Embolism which can be deadly. I am not trying to scare you ( too much) even though I know it is scary-sounding, but movement is essential for many reasons, as listed above. 

**Physical Therapy (PT) and Occupational Therapy (OT)**

I was visited by both PT and OT. PT helped me get up and walk in the halls and addressed proper mechanics for movement and how to get in and out of bed safely. They ensured I understood I need to follow the **""BLT"" List:**

* **B**: No BENDING
* **L**: No LIFTING
* **T**: No TWISTING

I added an ""E"" to it for ""BELT"" **E for No EXTENDING**. I found that reaching upwards hurts and puts pressure on my back.  

They also taught me to **""Barrel Roll""** to get out of bed or get up if I am lying down. If you think about how a lot of us get out of bed, especially if are a side-sleeper (who generally sleeps on the side not facing the direction needed to get out of bed) like me, I tended to just twist and sit up. That hurts. A lot. 

Barrel-rolling entails rolling your whole body to your back then your side and then pushing up to sit up. Using a bed rail is immensely helpful with this. 

Occupational Therapy came and questioned me about circumstances at home in regards to taking care of myself, available help, activities of daily living (ADLs) such as bathing and eating, home layout, work, etc. 

I am very grateful in that I have a husband who can work from home, a daughter who is more than happy to help me and lives within walking distance, no stairs in my home, and the ability to purchase things such as the bedrail, walker, and shower chair. My daughter helped me shower when I got home- a GOOD shower but no hair washing. I'll cover that in a bit. She also got me tucked into bed. My husband was able to help me move and he got me food and drink.

Occupational Therapy can help with getting home health care for you if needed and help you figure out adaptations for working and moving around the house. Take advantage of this help and any benefits you may have under your insurance plan. Ask your family for help. Don't be stubborn like me! 

Both PT and OT can help you figure out things like putting on your socks and shoes, dressing, bathing, cooking, etc. Ask for help. Explain your circumstances. Don't rely on ""winging it"" once you get home. Take advantage of what your insurance covers. You pay for that shit! Use it!

**Discharge from the Hospital:**

I had hoped to be able to go home after only a few days but my drains were collecting a lot of fluid so I had to stay 5 days total. This was difficult because the food SUCKED. Ugh. It was so bad. I didn't have much of an appetite so I didn't really care much. But the coffee was...not good. I need my coffee. My family brought me Starbucks every day. lol 

My family came up to help me pack. My husband owns a truck that I have difficulty, as a short person, getting in and out of. I had him bring me a step stool that helped me get into the truck easier. It REALLY helped. 

I got out of the truck and shook off any help in walking- until I almost toppled over. Our sidewalk is just SLIGHTLY crooked, and it made me feel off-kilter. Luckily my walker was there, and my daughter and husband caught me and walked me inside. 

The first thing I did was shower using the chair. I felt grungy. I had washed in the hospital but nothing is like your own home shower with your own shower stuff. I could not wash my hair due to my open drain sites. I had to wait 48 hours. In the hospital they had give me this shampoo-shower cap to use. You put it on your head like a shower cap and then move it around to cleanse your hair. Then you let your hair air dry. It was awful. lol. I felt like I had poured shampoo on my dry hair and then left it. When I could wash my hair I did immediately. lol 

A couple days after returning home, my sciatic pain got worse. I tried moving to the guest room bed which is firmer than my normal bed and it helped some but not much. I found putting my brace on and icing the area helped a bit but finally I called the doctor. He put me on a Steroid pack and I finally consented to using Gabapentin. I was not sleeping at all and both seem to have calmed down that pain immensely. 

**Activity at Home:**

**Pain meds: take them as prescribed and set an alarm to wake you if you need to, to keep on schedule. This will help keep your pain at bay. Don't wait until you are in the worst pain to take a dose. It may not work as effectively.** 

**Do not add meds such as NSAIDS (Ibuprofen, Meloxicam, etc) they can hinder your fusion from taking.** 

**Sitting and Moving:**

I sat up too much. I had missed the point in my discharge instructions not to sit up for more than 45 minutes at time. I believe this contributed to the inflammation in my back and the return of my sciatic pain. Don't be like me! READ YOUR PAPERS! Numerous times. Have your family or friends read them in case you are too groggy to remember them. Make an easy list for yourself. 

Walk around your house at first. Make sure you move any rugs or obstacles. I stubbornly refused my daughter's offer to pull up my runners and scatter rugs, and regretted it when my walker got caught up in one and I had to have help to fix the situation. So, damn your decor- clear the way! 

Make sure you drink enough water, eat enough protein, and get you some fiber! I use a clear Protein drink mix called Isopure that is Tropical Punch flavored and I mix in a fiber supplement that is clear and taste-free. You need to keep your protein up because that will help with healing. The fiber will keep your bowels moving as normal. 

  
**Where I am at Now:**

I am now 2 weeks post- op and according to my doctor, doing ""amazingly well."" I can walk without my walker, I am finally sleeping well due to the Steroids and Gabapentin, and I am not near as exhausted as I felt immediately after returning home. I am off my Tramadol and muscle relaxer. I use Tylenol if need be.

I use my brace consistently except for a quick pop to the bathroom in the middle of the night if need be. I sit up quite frequently but listen to my body when my back starts to hurt and then I lay down. I am able to drive. I was able to pick up a curbside grocery order today and my husband and I managed to get it all in the house- with a lot more trips than usual. I am one of those people who will hang bags on my arms and try to get it all in the house in one go. Today I did multiple trips inside. My husband recently had a hernia repair and is on restrictions but can lift more than I can so that helps. 

I was very tired once I got everything unpacked and my kitchen straightened out. But it felt good to do things! 

Due to my tendency to gain weight on Gabapentin, I am closely watching my diet. I had lost close to 30 pounds pre-op and do not want it to return. I feel that losing weight really helped me pre- and post-op. I am going to start doing GENTLE walks outside to build up my strength. I still feel very weak due to my decreased activity before and after surgery. 

  
**TL;DR:** 

* **Think ahead to obstacles and problems you may have pre- and post-op**
* **Enlist help from friends and family**
* **Ask Occupational and Physical Therapy for pointers and help while in the hospital**
* **Stock up on your groceries before your surgery. Make sure you have foods with protein and get a fiber supplement**
* **Take your time with things. Recovery is a marathon, not a sprint. Things will take time.** 
* **ASK FOR HELP. I can not say this enough. ASK FOR HELP.** 
* **Read your discharge instructions, make a list.** 

  
More than anything remember- you can do this. You are strong and being fearful is normal but don't let it hinder you in getting better.

1ke33lt,https://www.reddit.com/r/CoffeeBrewerReviews/comments/1ke33lt/does_the_capresso_303_espresso_machine_make/,Does the Capresso 303 Espresso Machine Make Perfect Coffee? Detailed Review,"The Capresso 303.01 4-Cup Espresso and Cappuccino Machine caught my eye as a compact and promising solution for coffee lovers like me who crave barista-quality drinks from the comfort of home. From its sleek black finish to its user-friendly features, this machine offered more than what I anticipated. I tested it daily, pulling all-nighters fueled by espresso shots and cappuccinos, and diving into every feature it promised to deliver.

**Design and Build Quality**  
The first thing I noticed about this espresso machine was its compact size‚Äî7.5"" x 9.75"" x 13.25"". It fits snugly on my kitchen counter without encroaching on valuable space, which is a big deal since I live in an apartment with limited storage. The classic black color blends seamlessly into any decor theme. It weighs around 5.94 pounds, making it sturdy yet portable enough to move around as needed. The build feels robust‚Äîthere's nothing flimsy about it, which gives the impression it‚Äôs made to last.

**Ease of Use**  
Operating this machine didn‚Äôt require an advanced degree in espresso-making. With a few pressable buttons for navigation, it‚Äôs intuitive enough even for someone who's never owned an espresso machine. I was impressed by the reusable filter type, reducing single-use waste and saving some bucks on pods. The provided user manual was straightforward, guiding me through first-time use without a hitch.

[Check Capresso 303.01 price on Amazon.](https://idealcoffeeshop.com/price/b001qtvxci/)

**Milk Frother Capabilities**  
The milk frother does an admirable job, but there‚Äôs a bit of a learning curve. Initially, I struggled to achieve the velvety texture I prefer, but with practice, I improved. Removing the rubber attachment on the steaming wand helped frothing efficiency, which isn‚Äôt necessarily explained in the manual. My cappuccinos and lattes turned out caf√©-worthy after just a few tries. However, its frothing capabilities might test a beginner‚Äôs patience initially, so don‚Äôt be discouraged.

**Performance and Brewing Quality**  
Once I dialed in the right grind size and tamping technique, the espresso quality genuinely blew me away. The crema layer adds an authentic touch, making every shot feel luxurious. I experimented with brewing lattes, cappuccinos, and even Americanos, and they all tasted fantastic when combined with quality beans. The machine‚Äôs steam-powered system efficiently delivers four cups of coffee in one go, perfect for when hosting guests or indulging in back-to-back caffeine fixes.

**Positives**  
- Compact size fits seamlessly into small kitchens.  
- Produces excellent espresso with rich crema.  
- Straightforward operation.  
- Durable, reusable filter minimizes added costs.  
- With a bit of experimentation, the steamer creates caf√©-standard milk foam.

**Areas of Improvement**  
- Frothing milk can be tricky for beginners.  
- Water left unused in the chamber might require effort to drain entirely after each session.  
- It‚Äôs slightly loud during operation, which might bother those who favor quieter appliances.  

**Competing Brands**  
Comparing this model to others in the same tier, such as De‚ÄôLonghi and Mr. Coffee espresso machines, the Capresso 303.01 holds its own due to its compact design and better-than-expected espresso output. Brands like De‚ÄôLonghi might offer digital controls and a quieter brewing experience, but the Capresso makes up for it with its affordability and sturdiness. While Mr. Coffee machines fare well for beginners, this one gives a definitive edge once you‚Äôve got the hang of it, particularly visible in its crema and frothing quality.

**Quality for Price**  
What really stood out is how much value this machine offers for its price. Investing in a daily espresso habit at your local coffee shop adds up fast. With this machine, the convenience of indulging in premium coffee at home is substantial. Over the weeks I used it, I realized it paid for itself just by replacing my morning trips to the caf√©. Sure, there are a few quirks here and there, but the financial savings and coffee quality outweigh most minor inconveniences.

1ke33ks,https://www.reddit.com/r/GameTableCentral/comments/1ke33ks/why_choose_the_wlive_adsg026bl_tv_stand_review/,Why Choose the WLIVE ADSG026BL TV Stand Review for Your Living Room Setup?,"**Sleek and Modern Design**

The WLIVE ADSG026BL TV Stand immediately captured my attention with its sleek black finish and modern aesthetic. As someone who likes keeping things minimalist, this entertainment center blends seamlessly with my living room. It measures 63 inches in length, making it a great fit for TVs ranging from 60 to 70 inches. I‚Äôll admit that the integrated LED lights are a major highlight. With 20 color options and 22 lighting modes, you can really set the mood. I‚Äôve used the remote to alternate between vibrant colors during gaming nights and soft tones for movie evenings. Just remember, it needs a CR2 battery that isn‚Äôt included.

[Check WLIVE ADSG026BL TV Stand price on Amazon.](https://decorgurus.com/p/b083zqg5kg/)

**Versatile and Customizable Storage**

Storage was another huge reason I opted for this model. The TV stand comes with two large drawers and seven open shelves. My gaming consoles, soundbar, DVDs, and books now have a place of their own without creating clutter. The glass shelves add an elegant touch while allowing you to showcase decorative pieces. Honestly, I was surprised how spacious it is while maintaining a compact feel. They‚Äôve truly nailed balancing practicality with modern aesthetics.

**Build Quality and Stability**

Keeping electronics stable is non-negotiable, and this stand delivers. Made from sturdy engineered wood and tempered glass, it feels solid even after loading it with all my gadgets. There‚Äôs a reinforced plate at the base for added stability, which helps me sleep better knowing my TV‚Äîlet‚Äôs just say, not the cheapest purchase‚Äîis securely supported. The stand has a weight capacity of up to 110 pounds, which covers most setups comfortably.

**Scratch Resistance and Maintenance**

Day-to-day life can be rough on furniture, but this stand holds up well against scratches. It‚Äôs a pleasant surprise, given how often I‚Äôm rearranging devices or accidentally sliding things across it. The waterproof material made cleanup a breeze when I spilled coffee on it (rookie mistake during a Netflix binge). A quick wipe with a dry cloth and it‚Äôs like nothing happened.

**Pluses**

- The ambient LED lighting options elevate its design, making it an entertainment centerpiece.
- Plenty of storage for gadgets, books, and decorations without feeling bulky.
- Build quality is solid, and it easily supports large TVs up to 70 inches.
- Scratch-resistant and easy-to-clean surface keeps it looking fresh.

**Caveats**

- You‚Äôll need to buy a CR2 battery for the remote, which is a small inconvenience.
- Assembly can be a bit time-consuming, so don‚Äôt expect to set it up in under an hour.
- While the glass shelves look amazing, they might feel fragile if you‚Äôre prone to accidental bumps.

**Competition in the Market**

I‚Äôve explored other modern TV stands in this price range, and a few come to mind for comparison. Let‚Äôs talk about the Furinno JAYA series, which offers budget-friendly TV stands. While they‚Äôre great for the price, the lack of LED lighting and limited storage put them a step below. Then there‚Äôs the Ameriwood Chicago stand, which includes a built-in fireplace. It‚Äôs definitely cozier, but you miss out on the dynamic ambiance the WLIVE lighting offers. The WLIVE stand strikes the right balance if you want a modern, tech-friendly unit without veering into gimmicks.

**Money‚Äôs Worth**

Given the sleek design, customizable features, and robust build quality, I‚Äôd say this stand is a great value for its price. While it‚Äôs not the cheapest option out there, the combination of aesthetic appeal and practicality makes it feel like a smart investment. If you‚Äôre looking to upgrade your living room setup without breaking the bank, this TV console delivers plenty of bang for the buck.

1ke33kf,https://www.reddit.com/r/GameTableCentral/comments/1ke33kf/why_sweetcrispy_counter_height_barstools_are_a/,Why Sweetcrispy Counter Height Barstools Are a Must-Buy? Honest Review Inside,"The Sweetcrispy KJEIT4R Counter Height Barstool has truly been a conversation starter in my kitchen. Its sleek Whiskey Brown faux leather finish radiates a modern yet rustic charm that immediately catches the eye. As someone who spends plenty of time swiveling between the kitchen and dining area, I can confirm that these stools provide a balance between aesthetic appeal and practical functionality. Comfy seating, easy maintenance, and a sturdy build are just a few highlights that stood out during my experience with this set of four barstools.

**Design and Build Quality**  
The first thing you‚Äôll notice about these stools is the blend of style and sturdiness. With dimensions of 18.9"" x 18.7"" x 36.2"" and straight metal legs powder-coated in black, they exude a minimalist yet robust design. Supporting a maximum weight of 330 pounds, they‚Äôre as strong as they look. The ergonomic backrest is honestly a game-changer if you‚Äôre someone who sits for long periods, whether sipping coffee or catching up with friends. Every stool feels thoughtfully crafted, not just slapped together, and this detail-oriented design won't go unnoticed. 

**Comfort and Functionality**  
The comfort on these barstools is surprising for something that doesn't look overly padded. The faux PU leather seat is soft yet firm, giving proper support without feeling stuffy. It‚Äôs a pleasure to lean back, especially with the ergonomic design ensuring a healthy posture even during long sitting sessions. The seat height of 26 inches feels ideal for most kitchen islands or bar counters, perfect for both dining and working on a laptop. 

**Check Sweetcrispy KJEIT4R price on Amazon.**  

**Assembly Made Simple**  
If you dread complex furniture assembly, here‚Äôs some good news. These stools are straightforward to put together, thanks to clearly labeled hardware and an easy-to-follow manual. It took me about 15 minutes to assemble each stool, which is ideal for someone like me who‚Äôs all thumbs with tools. Even the included hardware and tools seem decent in quality, ensuring a smooth setup process. 

**Key Benefits**  
- Ergonomic backrest for increased comfort.  
- Durable metal frame with 330-pound weight capacity.  
- Premium faux leather seat that‚Äôs waterproof and easy to maintain.  

**Weaknesses**  
Admittedly, no product is without flaws, and this one has its quirks. For instance, while the faux leather looks fabulous, under intensive daily use, it may show signs of slight wear sooner than expected. Another minor issue is that the anti-scratch protectors, though handy, don‚Äôt feel entirely secure when adjusting the stools frequently across wooden floors.  

**Critiques**  
- The faux leather might wear out with constant use.  
- Anti-scratch protectors can slightly loosen over time.  

**Alternative Offerings**  
When compared to competitors like the Signature Design by Ashley Rokane or Flash Furniture Lena stools, the Sweetcrispy KJEIT4R excels in affordability and assembly ease. However, the Rokane offers a slightly more luxurious seating experience with real wood elements, albeit at a steeper price point. On the flip side, Flash Furniture's stools are known for their contemporary design but couldn't quite match the Sweetcrispy‚Äôs rustic charm and stability.

**Smart Spending**  
Considering the features, design, and reasonable durability, this set provides excellent bang for the buck. The price point undercuts many higher-end options without sacrificing crucial features like comfort and style. Think of it as an investment for sprucing up your kitchen or bar space without burning a hole in your pocket.

1ke32y4,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1ke32y4,240 to 180 in 90 days,"I posted in r/carnivore last week when I hit my goal weight of 180, down from 240. I started carnivore along with intermittent fasting and working out 4 times a week. I was doing a calorie deficit as well but it varied from day to day and I didn't track the calories very well. Some days my one meal of the day would be around 1,200 calories and some days I would have around 1,800 or more. It sounds low I know but when you eliminate carbs and sugar and just have one meal consisting of meat and eggs you can eat until you are full and the calorie count won't be too crazy. Didn't think I'd have loose skin but I guess there is such a thing as losing weight too fast. I'm happy, don't get me wrong, but asking all the loose skin makes me a little depressed and I feel like the loose skin is affecting my physique negatively. I weighed after the gym today and was still 180. Since doing this diet I've only had like 3 weeks where the scale didn't go down. It was crazy getting on the scale and seeing it 6-7 pounds down from the week before. I switched it up as far as the intermittent fasting goes for this week, the only big change I made was taking a drink mix with me that contained my flavored BCAA powder and water with a splash of 0 cal juice. For the entirety of the diet I was strictly following the intermittent fasting and only having black coffee and water during the day then only eating between 7pm-9pm then only drinking water after that. Any advice would be great, I'm gonna keep trying to lose weight but I also don't want to lose muscle mass. I'm more or less as strong as I was when I started my diet. Can still push the same weight just nit as many reps. Anyways good luck on your weight loss journeys and hang in there.",2,1746306107.0,LooseSkinProblems,1,1.0,False
1ke31zt,https://www.reddit.com/r/valzubiriagenda/comments/1ke31zt/what_is_valzubiriagenda_and_some_ideas_and/,What is #VALZUBIRIAGENDA and some ideas and insights,"# The 3 basic parameters of hashtag #Valzubiriagenda:

1. **We artists and everyone else can write and self-publish art- and artist-related books: memoirs, biographies, art books and art catalogs.** Books are forever. Pamphlets and brochures are not books.
2. **We announce a schedule of increasing prices of our art pieces,** which includes quantities (scarcity numbers) per price point and overall (the total quantity of art pieces we might ever make). This helps art traders, art investors and art collectors speculate or even stop speculating and instead join a community of investors working together to hopefully skyrocket to the higher announced prices in a shorter span of time.
3. **We can use the NFT world, because NFTs provide the tracking (who owns what) and trading.**

We can also not be involved with NFTs. Stores and individuals can help sell art using online presence and our catalogs in the stores. If this trends, or once this trends, even expensive art can be sold by neighboring businesses, without exclusivity. Commission systems do not have to be standardized. Art investors can produce their own catalogs to leave at the caf√©s. Even the caf√©s can produce their own catalogs.

**Valzubiriagenda NFTs**

**NFTs only came about a few years ago.** But I had been working on this since the 1990s. I wrote a book, **Valzubiriagenda**, along with fellow artist **Silverio Perez,** and released it in 2018 (Amazon and elsewhere), tackling everything related to #1 & #2. We'll come up with #3 in a later book/ memoir/ marketing book.

Any artist, including tangible artists can release 10,000 NFTs if the artist chooses to do so. For tangible artists, the NFT first becomes an Art Commission Contract for sight unseen, yet-to-be made art. Once the art is made, the NFT becomes proof of ownership that the actual, tangible art is theirs.

**Warehousing our tangible art**

Another related idea is that the tangible art may be warehoused by the artist so that the NFT traders continue to trade. This means that even 10-ton 10-foot tall sculptures can be owned and traded by anyone without worrying about shipping, reshipping, scratches, smudges, parts breaking off, etc. The newness of the pieces remain because they are stored by the artist, source, gallery, etc. The art piece gets shipped to the art collector, the ultimate owner.

An artist who makes ceramic coffee mugs - smaller art pieces, can release 10,000 NFTs with a schedule of increasing prices so that NFT traders can trade immediately. The 10,000 coffee mugs can get damaged, so as they are made, they continue to be stored by the artist, until the time when art collectors decide to have the art pieces shipped to them.

**Why only now?**

I decided to write as many book-length memoirs as I can before I came out to promote this.

I'm an artist and an author. Both need time to ""master."" I would not even fully use ""master"" on myself, because there's always something new, even to my own art, my own writing and publishing.

>*I am now claiming that I'm the visual artist who has produced the most artist memoirs in the world.* I have 5 on Amazon. I count **Valzubiriagenda** as both a marketing book and a memoir-of-sorts, because it has a lot of my own life lessons on writing and publishing. I would not care to contest my claim of having the most memoirs. I will release 5 more over the next 3 years.

**BARTER! Get help to write, photograph art and publish your books!**

Anyone can hire 11 ghostwriters for 11 memoirs. If you can make art, but you cannot write, then barter your forever art with those who can help you produce forever books.

I don't feel the pressure of writing and publishing because I feel my focus should be on art students and art experts who would study my art and my books 100 years from now. Don't expect relatives and friends to read your books.

**I call myself the Dollman**

For my NFTs, I am proposing to make dioramas - my original, costumed, bejeweled porcelain dolls in backdrops that will also have precious metals and gemstones. This way I can incorporate precious metals and gemstones in my work, to make sure that people perceive my art as expensive, just in case I myself don't become ""famous"" - there's no need to get world famous. We are artists and all we need to do is to satisfy the art niche.

**Use your laptop now!**

I will encourage you to start writing your book-length memoir. Write, Edit and then Self-publish it. Get help. Why wait a hundred years for someone to write about you when all you need is a laptop and a nearby coffee shop.

Don't start counting chickens before the eggs hatch. I have encountered a lot of would-be writers who immediately see themselves as bestselling. world famous assets to society. Two even wanted me to sign NDAs (Nondisclosure agreements), because they did not want me to steal their book ideas.

Here's a suggestion. I would not personally do it. From one manuscript can come 2 books: The Original Draft (unedited, with misspellings, considered to be an art piece, scanned pages(?) of your handwritten original effort), and The Final Edition (edited).

**PROVENANCE!**

Another way to enhance our investability, tradability and collectability is **PROVENANCE** ***- how art ownership proceeds through time.*** The way this can be done is also through publishing books. Everyone can write their memoirs, biographies, art books and art catalogs, including traders, investors and art collectors. In effect, we artists can continue to be included or mentioned in even more books, without any additional effort by us.

You as an investor, reseller, trader, art collector should be able to publish a catalog with 250 works by 250 different artists, but they need to agree to this right from the start - it's your money, you should require them to follow your version of the hashtag ***#valzubiriagenda*** *parameters,* which preferably should include permission for you to publish their art. Why would you track down 250 artists later?

**No exclusive contracts**

If you're a caf√©, you can call for artists, and come up with a book with for example, 30 artists, with a chapter devoted to each artist's profile and images of the artist's art.

You can distribute your catalogs to businesses and individuals near and far and online.

The book **Valzubiriagenda** even cites that funeral homes and janitors closets can sell art, with or without exclusivity. Airline catalogs can include million dollar art pieces. Car manufacturers, showrooms and even car repair shops can sell art as well. Everyone should be able to do this, anywhere in the world, especially not just because of the pandemic, but right now, we are in really bad economies.

**What's with the name #Valzubiriagenda**

I was into conspiracy theories in 2018, and this term, *""The Mandela Effect,""* was popular. I had read many times that an artist coined the term, but I had to research online, for her name, many times, before remembering it. I'm not good at remembering names. It took me a year and a half to finally tell you that **Fiona Broome** coined ""The Mandela Effect.""

I also thought I might have to research trademarks and copyrights just to come up with a generic name. So I decided on **""Valzubiriagenda.""** I was not really sure at first, but I decided to use it as the title for my book (with co-author/artist **Silverio Perez**) so that there would be no turning back and I can move on.

**Am I a FUTURIST?**

Someone I recently met this May 2022 just called me a futurist.

In the 1990s, I proposed to a pension fund that they can raise billions of dollars, especially for emergencies, or as needed, or out of desperation, if the pension fund purchases a quantity of art from an artist who not only has a current, reasonable price, but an announced future price that the artist wants to reach.

That future price would obviously be higher than the current price. The art commission contract for multiple art pieces can be taken to the fund's financial lender for a loan. The higher future price can be used for financing purposes.

The pension fund's treasurer, a publicly elected official, said this idea might work, but we had to keep this a secret and discuss this some more, because other pension funds might copy and do this prematurely. This idea had to come from the two of us. The treasurer needed his votes and I needed credentials.

Added into the pot was my idea that I, as the artist, will also write one book-length artist memoir. This was and still is a strong factor, because the leadership and marketing books I had read then mentioned a strong tip. If you want to advance in your field, write a full-length book that is related to the field.

Unfortunately, the elected official, the treasurer of the pension fund, who was also a friend, passed away - he was old and had ailments. At that point in time, I cannot just approach another pension fund treasurer to share this idea with.

I realized I had to write a few memoirs. I needed to set an example for other artists, so I needed to write more than one memoir. Then I felt I should also make ready another book - the how-to of what I'm up to. I wrote **Valzubiriagenda**, which was a memoir of sorts. I knew how long it would take me to write a book, so I had to make sure I can also consider this book a memoir.

In 2008, I imagined that someone like Bernie Madoff, or a fund like Lehman Brothers, would be desperate enough to use this to save themselves and their companies. I was not ready. I had only written 1 manuscript for a memoir.

In 2012, I released **Dollman the Musical, A Memoir of an Artist as a Dollmaker**. Once again, I was not ready because writing it depressed me a little, and I knew I had to write more.

In 2014, I released 3 memoirs, and re-released **Dollman the Musical.** Besides releasing regular books, I released special editions of the 4 books, which had a **""Special Secret Insert for Bankers,""** which explains my ideas of an announced schedule of exponentially increasing prices, to satisfy investors, and the publication of artist memoirs, to satisfy art collectors.

In 2014, I also issued out a press release. Google ***""Can Billion Dollar Artist Save Investors and World Economy Valentino Zubiri PRWeb August 19 2014""*** and you will see the press release.

What I did was stake a claim on my ideas. I did not promote my books and the press release. I just wanted them to stay online, like a sleeping giant or a dormant volcano. I even designed 3 of the book covers to look like indie books from the 1980s. I was planting the seeds, thinking they will eventually grow and bear fruit in the future.

In 2015, I was interviewed by **Richard Syrett,** about one of my memoirs, **Hocus Pocus Lately.** This book is my memoir with paranormal stories. I could have pursued promoting my paranormal stories, but I wanted to be known first as a visual artist and memoirist, so I allowed myself one interview related to **Hocus Pocus Lately. Richard Syrett** has(had?) his own syndicated radio show, **The Conspiracy Show with Richard Syrett,** about the paranormal. He also guest hosts on **Coast to Coast AM**, another internationally syndicated show about the paranormal.

In 2018, I released **Valzubiriagenda** (co-authored by artist **Silverio Perez,** a fellow artist). Finally, this book is ""the how-to of what I'm to.""

I'm going to end this with some strangeness. In 1986, a lady at a religious gathering went into a trance and left a good number of messages. Supposedly, anyone who got into a trance would have messages, but once the trance was over, the person would not remember what was said.

I was not part of the group, but the lady turned her head to face me. She ""foretold"" that whatever I would decide to do in the future, it will take time, but it will be the right thing. This is one of my stories in one of my memoirs, **Hocus Pocus Lately.**

**The Tulipmania of 1634-37**

I discovered that there was this incident of rare tulips becoming collectible during the Dutch Golden Age. There were tulips so rare and so well-desired that their prices equaled to that of a house. You can read more about this online (Wikipedia) or watch a few YouTube videos about it.

Here is the most useful idea that I gleaned from the Tulipmania. The tulip bulbs remained safe inside nurseries. The traders were carrying the deeds of ownership to the tulip bulbs.

**Then NFTs came to the forefront**

I started learning PHP, an HTML scripting language, and MySQL, the database that PHP can connect to in the background, in 1999, when there were only 3 books about PHP and MySQL at the bookstores.

By 2014, I was trying to figure out how to make the ""ledger,"" or database that can be used to update ownership and who can be contacted. If we are trading art, then the art ownership should be updated.

Then NFTs came about. This can be used as our ledger. Everyone can immediately trade NFTs of future, yet-to-be made art pieces, especially because it takes time to make tangible art.

NFTs actually went a step ahead, by allowing digital art to be traded.

The only setback with NFTs, in my opinion, is that it still lacks a commission system for resellers and representatives.

For example, if a caf√© wants to represent me, then they can promote me at their caf√© and on their online pages. If I make one piece of art that will be exclusively represented by a gallery, then that commission will be different and more specific. As ownership is transferred, the subsequent owners should be able to reset the commission. We should also have the option of giving commissions to hundreds of representatives at one time with different percentages if need be.

**The recent crypto crash**

Lately, we have observed that NFTs and cryptocurrencies have been behaving like the stock market and other markets. They have been fluctuating.

I believe that it is time for a trend which discourages fluctuation of prices.

I have also seen YouTube videos where social influencers are encouraging us to be on the lookout for exponentially profitable ventures, because we have all seen this happen with the exponential increase of Bitcoin and Ethereum.

**Let's see if #Valzubiriagenda trends**

We can announce present and future art prices. The galleries won't do this (yet?) because they follow a more traditional approach to the business of art.

*We have a choice of using* ***incrementally*** *or* ***exponentially*** *increasing prices.* We still reserve the right to change things in the future, so everyone should know to follow the latest update.

If this trends, if you as an artist simply announces that you will write an artist memoir, or that you will include the future works in future art books, you might have more art traders, investors and collectors approaching you.

**Get your pen, paper and calculator**

Imagine yourself as an artist, where you are right now. Let's just say you still do not have a book about yourself and your art yet. Imagine now that you have a memoir out there. Don't you think it makes sense to charge more than what you are charging now? Writing and publishing books is just the beginning. I'm just standardizing this approach. The books also say to do other related projects. In my case, getting **Dollman the Musical** onstage is one idea. You will have other related projects, but the publication of memoirs, biographies, art books and art catalogs will help all of us.

You can also imagine that a law firm that has meeting rooms, with someone who wants to form a local #valzubiriagenda group, can have meetings. A local caf√© can do the same. Local photographers for your art, writers, editors, book designers, proofreaders and others can join in.

I suggest have printed books to share. 15 copies of your memoir or art books will be better than an e-reader or laptop or your phone to show. These gadgets can be stolen, sabotaged, broken, have coffee spilled on them, etc. 15 printed books means simultaneously showing to 15 people. You can even give them away to potential resellers, investors, traders and collectors.

**When it rains, it pours, as in the days of Noah**

There's a saying, ""When it rains, it pours."" There is a negative interpretation and a positive interpretation.

*Negative:* When trouble comes, they cascade to even more.

***Positive:*** When opportunity comes knocking, more follow suit. We can assume that if one gets our art because of #valzubiriagenda, more want to do it now, because of the rising prices, and FOMO - fear of missing out. What will they lose if they miss the boat?

As I have said earlier, if the #valzubiriagenda trends, if you announce a future memoir or art catalog, you might have an increase of investors, traders and art collectors who would want to check you out. You might encourage more sales. Just remember to write and publish that memoir and art catalog.

There's this saying, ""As in the days of Noah."" Imagine Noah, building his ark, with members of his own family, putting all his time and effort into it. Noah was a nice guy. I'm sure every once in a while a neighbor offered him coffee, or chai latte, or whatever refreshing drink they might have back then.

Here's the lesson to be learned. Just because they offered him some type of bubble tea drink, or coca cola, they still didn't make it to the ark. Rubbing shoulders with actors does not make you an actor. I have told my artist friends to write their memoirs. They told me that once they see me succeed, after all these many years of seeing my seemingly useless efforts, then they will write their memoirs and follow the road that I had paved for them.

Good luck to them, but if I were you, act now, get my art or make art. Support the 5-year old artist whose parent promised to release a comprehensive art catalog. If you get that 5-year old's art, and mine, I would be honored to be in the same art catalog that you will produce. I'm already successful at that point. You have gotten the mission just right.

I have already claimed to have written the most book-length artist memoirs in the world. Dethrone that claim. Barter. Use ghostwriters. Success to me means facing God one day and saying, I wrote my memoirs and left the world a legacy of books and art. I will not tell God, smiling and proudly, that I encouraged a run for my art by announcing a schedule of exponentially increasing prices that reached 9 figures. I'm sure God knows we had fun.

# Price discrimination

>Pricing power is a signal of value. If you can segment your market, you can capture more of the value you create. -¬†*Naval Ravikant*

*Price discrimination*, a core concept in microeconomics, allows businesses to charge different prices to different consumers based on their willingness to pay. It's not about exploiting customers, but about segmenting them and offering differentiated products that justify price variation.

At the heart of this strategy is¬†*consumer surplus*, i.e the gap between what a customer is willing to and what they do pay. By targeting this surplus, companies aim to maximise revenue while maintaining customer satisfaction. I love coffee and might value a cup at ¬£6, but purchase it for ¬£4. So I enjoy a consumer surplus of ¬£2.

When done well,¬†*price discrimination*¬†boosts revenue, broadens market access through tiered pricing and funds innovation. Poorly executed, it can erode trust, invite unwelcome scrutiny and alienate customers. This damages a brand and reduces demand.¬†*Uber*¬†faced a public backlash in¬†*2022*¬†after its surge pricing was triggered while people tried to escape the scene of a shooting in¬†*New York*.

# Types of price discrimination

>Bundling and versioning aren't just marketing tricks. They are structured forms of price discrimination. -¬†*Chris Anderson*

*Price discrimination*¬†occurs when a seller charges different prices to different buyers for similar products without corresponding differences in cost. This is only possible in markets with some¬†*Price Elasticity of Demand*, where different groups of consumers value a product differently.

The main types of¬†*price discrimination*¬†are:

1. **First-degree price discrimination (Perfect price discrimination)**: Charge each consumer the maximum price they are willing to pay. In theory, this approach extracts all¬†*consumer surplus*¬†and converts it into¬†*producer surplus*. This is often seen in auctions and house purchases.
2. **Second-degree price discrimination**: Prices vary based on the quantity consumed or product variations, e.g. volume discounts, tiered pricing and premium versions of products.
3. **Third-degree price discrimination**: This is the most common form. The market is segmented based on identifiable characteristics, e.g. age, location or income. Student discounts, senior citizen fares and first class train tickets.

# How I apply price discrimination

>You can charge people differently based on their propensity to pay, but you're legally not allowed to do this without offering them something extra. -¬†*Naval Ravikant*

*Scarper*¬†(my mobile game which combines elements of¬†*Tetris*¬†and¬†*Candy Crush*) uses a freemium pricing model.

Tackling the chaos of countertop appliances has always been a struggle, but this sleek and practical sliding tray is a game-changer. Its black design complements the aesthetic of modern kitchens, offering both function and style. It‚Äôs the kind of tool you don‚Äôt realize you desperately need until you‚Äôve tried it.

**Design and Build Quality**

The craftsmanship of this sliding tray is impressive. It‚Äôs made with high-quality materials, weighing a sturdy 2.25 pounds, which gives it durability while still being easy to maneuver. Not only does it prevent countertop scratches with its smooth rubber wheels, but the mechanism itself glides effortlessly, even when supporting a heavy appliance. I tested it with my bulky air fryer and a 6-quart instant pot, and the tray held up perfectly, feeling stable and secure. Measuring 14 x 9.5 inches, this size accommodates most medium-sized kitchen gadgets, from coffee makers to toasters, without feeling oversized or intrusive.

**Ease of Use**

When it comes to daily functionality, this tray shines. Moving my coffee maker from under the cabinet to the countertop has never been easier‚Äîit genuinely glides like it has a mind of its own. I‚Äôve used other models before, and they often stick or make an annoying noise when sliding, but not this one. The clever design ensures a hassle-free experience, whether you‚Äôre pulling a toaster closer or rearranging your countertop for meal prep. It‚Äôs dishwasher-compatible, though cleaning it by hand is equally painless.

[Check Ibyx 4 price on Amazon.](https://applianceheaven.com/link/b0c1kxq4qh/)

**Advantages**

- Smooth, quiet-gliding rubber wheels prevent scratches on countertops.  
- Compact yet spacious enough to fit a variety of appliances.  
- Sleek black design blends seamlessly with modern kitchen d√©cor.  
- Highly durable materials ensure long-term usability.  
- Versatile range of tray sizes caters to different appliances.

**Areas for Improvement**

- It‚Äôs not height-adjustable, so not all appliances may fit underneath cabinets if moved forward.  
- Some might find the wheels too smooth on polished countertops, making it prone to slight sliding when moving lightweight appliances.  

**Target Audience**

This sliding tray is perfect for those who want to organize their countertop appliances efficiently and with style. Whether you‚Äôre a busy parent who needs appliances easily accessible during hectic mornings or a coffee enthusiast who values convenience, it caters to everyone. The size and functionality make it especially ideal for kitchens where counter space is at a premium.

**Competing Products**

Several sliding trays on the market aim to deliver similar utility, such as the Nifty Under-Cabinet Appliance Rolling Tray. While that one is budget-friendly and lighter in weight, it lacks the stability and premium feel of the Ibyx product. I also compared it to simpler sliding mats, which, though cheaper, don‚Äôt offer the sturdy base or quiet operation that this tray does. The Ibyx tray stands out because of its elegant bamboo options (adding a unique aesthetic), its sturdier build, and better overall user experience.

**Cost Efficiency**

Relative to other products in this category, this sliding tray offers excellent value for the robustness and attention to detail in its design. It‚Äôs clear the designers took user convenience seriously, making it worth its slightly higher price tag compared to competitors like simple silicone sliding mats or less-polished plastic alternatives. Considering its durability and versatility, it‚Äôs an investment that feels genuinely worthwhile.

1ke2rvx,https://i.redd.it/nwgqvn44qmye1.jpeg,"No floor, no ceiliglng, just limitless potential with the relentless Kendu community","To our supporters, builders, and long-term thinkers:

Look around this forum and others, and everyone‚Äôs talking like we‚Äôre in a bear market. Everyone‚Äôs hunting for floors, and selling their floor prices. This is not the Kendu way, and sounds like other communities are feeling pressured by market forces that may create a substantial collapse. This is not Kendu‚Äôs story, and not Kendu‚Äôs future. While most of the crypto space is trapped in the noise of short-term charts and speculative floors, Kendu Inu is focused on what actually drives long-term value: building real-world products people use, share, and believe in.

We‚Äôre not watching candles. We‚Äôre building culture.


Why Kendu Is Poised for Meteoric Growth

1. Real Products, Real Markets
Kendu is rapidly expanding into lifestyle and consumer sectors. Launched initiatives include:
	‚Ä¢	Kendu Energy, a branded performance drink targeting the Web3 demographic
	‚Ä¢	Kendu Jewelry, fusing crypto culture with premium wearable design
	‚Ä¢	Kendu Coffee, a boutique line of Web3-themed brews
	‚Ä¢	Nightclub events and brand activations bringing the Kendu identity into the physical world

This is more than marketing. It‚Äôs ecosystem expansion into touchable, tastable, shareable products.

2. Culture as Infrastructure
Kendu is not just a token. It is a movement of conviction holders unified by a vision:
Build a brand that crosses from the blockchain into the real world.
Where others chase liquidity, we chase legacy.

3. Too Busy Building to Worry About Floors
Floors are fragile. Fundamentals are not. Kendu is focused on shipping products, scaling brand identity, and forging partnerships across industries.
The floor takes care of itself when the foundation is strong.

4. Memes Meet Markets
The Kendu ecosystem blends crypto-native virality with tangible business models. This is the fusion of meme power and manufacturing. Distribution and digital community.
It is Web3 with a cash register.


We‚Äôre not here for a temporary pump.
We‚Äôre here to become the first culturally viral, product-based, blockchain-born lifestyle brand.
If you‚Äôre looking for short-term noise, look elsewhere.
If you‚Äôre looking for global adoption, you‚Äôre already home.

She started asking to borrow money from me a while back when we first became friends, and I would lend her. However, it became a recurring thing, and what bothered me was that she would often spend the borrowed money on things I consider non-essential, like Ubers, takeouts, and daily coffees.

It got to a point where I felt used and eventually told her that involving money in our friendship was causing a strain and I wanted to avoid it. She got upset but said she wouldn't borrow from me again, we moved on and actually became closer. Despite this, she started borrowing money again, and I continued to lend it to her without asking too many questions, as I wanted to be a supportive friend. I also often cover for our drinks when we go out, so it's not like I'm completely insensitive to treating her.

Recently, her family's financial situation is quite tight. She asked to borrow money again, and I lent her. Just a few days later, she texted me saying she's getting coffee and asking me to pay for it. I jokingly asked if she had already run out of the money I lent her. She said no, but she didn't want to use that money now and she had given some of it to her mom for house expenses. I told her that I had lent her that money for her own needs. I did agree to pay for her coffee just this time mentioning I had also covered the food the last time we met.

She got really upset and told me not to send money, saying, ""as soon as my dad gets paid I'll give you back the money."" The next day, feeling bad about my comment, I apologized, saying I didn't mean for it to sound bad. She replied, ""you meant what you said and I felt what I felt, just because I would never do this to a friend doesn't mean everyone else would, let's just move on, no need to feel bad, I pray that I never need to borrow money from you again and I will pay you back.""

I don't feel like it's fair for her to be upset, and it feels a bit like emotional manipulation/ guilt-tripping.

I had been dating this girl for about two months. Things were going well, and one evening she invited me over to her parents‚Äô house for dinner ‚Äî classic ‚Äúmeet the family‚Äù night.

I was nervous but ready. Dressed nicely, brought wine, practiced polite small talk. Everything was going fine.

Then her mom served chili. With beans. And jalape√±os.
I‚Äôm not the biggest chili guy, but I was in impress mode, so I ate two full bowls, then dessert, then coffee, then a tiny bit of liquor for digestion. What could go wrong?

Ten minutes later, my stomach whispered: ‚ÄúWe ride at dawn.‚Äù

I politely excused myself and went to the bathroom.
What followed was‚Ä¶ an event.
A natural disaster.
The Devil‚Äôs Orchestra.

It was loud. It was long. It echoed. The bathroom was small, the walls were thin, and the conversation in the living room stopped.
They heard.
They definitely heard.

Traumatized but trying to recover, I flushed.
Nothing.
Flushed again.
Still nothing.
The toilet was clogged.

I opened the cabinet ‚Äî no plunger.
Looked around ‚Äî nothing.
Except‚Ä¶ a plastic cup on the sink.

Desperate, I used the cup as a makeshift plunger.
At this point I‚Äôm sweating like I‚Äôm in a hostage situation.
I try to push the blockage down with the cup, and in the process‚Ä¶
the cup slips from my hand and falls into the toilet.

Yes. I clogged my girlfriend‚Äôs parents‚Äô toilet with chili, shame, and a plastic cup.

I had to make a decision:
	1.	Flee the country
	2.	Own up to it

I chose the second one.

I stepped out, red-faced, and her dad just stared at me like a disappointed judge.
He asked, ‚ÄúEverything okay in there, son?‚Äù
I just said: ‚ÄúNot really‚Ä¶‚Äù

The next day, my girlfriend texted me:

‚ÄúSo‚Ä¶ my dad had to call a plumber. But he said at least you were honest.‚Äù

We‚Äôre still friends.
I‚Äôve never been back to that house.
And I will never eat chili at a family dinner again.

‚∏ª

**3-Right now**

""This is the Chaotix detective agency?"" Tom said. looking them all over. The big green alligator was the only one smiling. The purple chameleon was just standing with a cold expression twirling a ninja star, and the bee looked like and acted like he was 6 years old.

""They are the best detective team in the galaxy!"" Knuckles said, very proudly.

""Atleast in the Genisis system."" Tails added.

""Names Vector!"" The gator spoke up ""The purple guy is Espio and this kids Charmy.""

""Hi!"" Charmy said. ""What ever you lost mister we can find it for you!""

""Well what we need to find"" Tails started ""Is a guy named Agent stone. Last spotted in London's sewers!""

""...Who"" Espio asked.

""Where?"" Vector asked.

""Whats a London?"" Charmy asked.

Tom sighed ""Ok, anyone of you got a ring?""

Espio produced a ring, and Tom snatched it and tossed it, showing them straight to the streets of London through a back alley. ""Here"" Tom said, leading them through, ""He's in the sewer systems. Atleast last time we checked- guys?""

In the mere *seconds* Tom had looked away, the Chaotix had already been attracted to the smell of human food. It wasn't even a minute and the 'professional' detectives had gone off and gotten side tracked.

Tom was shaking his head. This was going to be a long day but atleast things couldn't get any worst.

""HEY LOOK!"" An old guy said, ""Its that scrawny red menace!""walking over with a cane in one hand and a sign with a crapily drawn picture of knuckles in the other. The picture was completely inaccurate, his limbs were too small in proportion to his body, and his eyes were drawn way to far apart and were facing in opposite directions. It was an utter joke of himself.

Knuckles turned, begining to state how he might appear small but was actually pretty strong himself before a crowed formed.

""He broke big ben!"" An old lady shouted.

""Get him!"" Another old man said.

Trained warrior he might have been, nothing prepared knuckles for an army of old patriotic British people that really *really* liked that clock tower. And no amount of saving the world was going to let them forget that.

Tom watched has Knuckles brave face faded to fear and then ran off through a brick wall has the mob chased him down. All that was heard was him yelling ""I do not seek to hurt my elders!"" followed by Tails following after them to save Knuckles.

Maddie sighed. ""Lets just hope these guys know what there doing.""

Despite there intial impression, it took the Chaotix a surprisingly small amount of time to determine that, thanks to Espio asking around about were Agent stone was (or rather, showing people a picture and asking if they had seen him) and based on certain timeframes, Vector determined that Agent stone likely spent his first few months after Robotniks looking for various odd jobs before eventually landing a job at Costa Coffee as a barista which went well up until Agent Stone blew up at a customer for not understanding if you leave a hot coffee around while you talk on the phone for several minutes that it will not in fact still be hot, and in a fit of rage dumped the cup on her. Then after that he got fired he decided to start his own coffee shop that was mildly successful before it went bankrupt due to Agent Stone caring more about giving his customers good coffee then turning a profit, and then after that Stone worked at another local coffee chain and last time one of the employees saw him was leaving down a random street and turning down a single ally.

""There is no way you all find him this fast"" Tom said.

""Oh ya, watch."" Vector said, before opening the door and leading them down. Sure enough, in a matter of time that should not have been in any way possible, Vector found the crab mech where Stone lived in.

""...There his is."" Tails said, finally having came back with Knuckles.

""Huh... Y'know he looks nothing like the picture."" Vector said.

""He lives inside the crab fortress."" Knuckles said.

""Ok, now how do we go about-"" Tails didn't even get to finsih before Knuckles went charging down the sewer straight towards the back door.

Knuckles was expecting to see many things. He expected to see Agent stone making yet another one of those sonic robots. Eviling concocting scheme's to get revenge.

He did not expect to see Sonic, Shadow, a random pink hedgehog, a random white bat, and a robot that was 40% robot 60% gun sitting around a table playing UNO, all while stone was just reading a magazine.

""...You **HAVE** abandoned us and become an evil general of robotic look alikes!"" Knuckles said ""And you didn't even ask me to be your right hand man!""

""...OOOH right the metal sonics"" Sonic said.

""The metal who now?"" shadow said.

One quick explanation and everyone caught up... But all the less confused. Did Robotnik survive? Who was Silver?... Ok that could be answered easily: Silver was a close friend of Amy's, and he too belived in saving Little planet. But saw the use of the chaos emeralds as a desperate last resort.

""He says that in the future, little planet, mobius, and earth all stand to be destroyed by this diety"" Amy said.

""But Chaos energy is what flows through everyone? Isn't it?"" Shadow added.

""Not to Silver its not."" Amy added ""To Silver he thinks the only beings with Chaos Energy are evil.""

""...Would it also stand to reason he is after the Master Emerald?"" Knuckles asked.

""...Thats here?!"" Amy asked.

""Why yes. Blue Hedgehog used it twice to save us.""

Amy looked like she could just about cry here. Not out of sadness but out of joy. She turned to Sonic ""So you really can save us! Your the deity the profecy talked about!""

""Why yes I am!"" Sonic said proudly ""I've scrambled Robotniks eggs before! I can do it again!""

""And you won't do this alone."" Shadow spoke, standing up with the rest, before turning to his friends ""Right guys?""

`[IF YOU INSIST.]` Omega said.

""If your in, we are to.""

""So are we."" Tom said.

""...We are?"" Maddie asked. No hate to anyone here but Maddie didn't particularly feel like going to on another adventure to a different planet in space.

""Course we are!"" Tom said.

""So were all in this. Together!"" Sonic said, ready to go scramble some eggs. Hopefully, for *one. Last. Time.*

""So where do we start?"" Tails said.

""Back where all of this started."" Amy said, holding up a ring...

**""Green Hills Zone.""**

\*\*\*

What ever excitment Sonic had to show off his home to his friends again was dashed as soon as he went through the portal. Gone was the green grass, now a dead orange color. The dirt had hardened into a purple stone, a similar color to the skies above and the water below. Flowers, tree's, wild life? Gone in favor of pipes, cheep robotic imitations, and robotic knock off animals that were openly hostile to anything organic...

I don‚Äôt see too many posts about it on Reddit, so I figured this could be a fun way to share and also keep track of what we‚Äôve done.

‚∏ª

2024 Highlights

	‚Ä¢	Bolivia ‚Äì Honestly had some of the best food of the day and was our favorite in 2024. Great cultural performances and interesting historical exhibits too.

	‚Ä¢	Sri Lanka ‚Äì Fun performances and free candy. The line for food was confusing, so we didn‚Äôt end up getting any.

	‚Ä¢	Guyana ‚Äì Knew very little about it going in, but left super impressed. Delicious food, good Caribbean vibes, and we scored some amazing spices from a stall. Met the ambassador at the door!

	‚Ä¢	Ivory Coast ‚Äì Tasty food and a few cool exhibits to explore.

	‚Ä¢	Dominican Republic ‚Äì Great energy, a live DJ, and solid food options.

‚∏ª

2025 Highlights

	‚Ä¢	Uzbekistan ‚Äì Beautiful embassy with vibrant exhibits and traditional dance performances.

	‚Ä¢	Trinidad & Tobago ‚Äì Enjoyed the food and loved the live steel drum music.

	‚Ä¢	Peru ‚Äì Amazing food, generous portions, and great value. Performances were fun too.

	‚Ä¢	Philippines ‚Äì Fantastic food and cultural shows. Wish the inside of the embassy had been open though.

	‚Ä¢	Kazakhstan ‚Äì Might have been our favorite this year! Didn‚Äôt know what to expect, but this place was‚Ä¶ very nice (pun intended). Musical performances and tasty food at reasonable prices. Also did a great job of getting us to think about actually visiting the country

	‚Ä¢	Oman ‚Äì Biggest surprise of the day. Probably ended up being a close first place this year. We almost skipped it because it looked too quiet, but it ended up being one of the most impressive. Gorgeous building, a really cool library, great exhibits, a kids‚Äô area, cool attractions, free water bottles, free coffee and dates‚Äîsuper welcoming.

	‚Ä¢	Eritrea ‚Äì Free food (always a win), and they offered two small but flavorful dishes. Cool live music and some historical displays too. (They seemed to have run out of free samples around 2 so get there earlier to try)

	‚Ä¢	Rwanda ‚Äì Learned about Rwandan coffee (with free samples‚Äîamazing). Also tried a free sample of a chili-like dish that was packed with flavor.

	‚Ä¢	Botswana ‚Äì Not much going on, but still worth checking out for the experience.

‚∏ª

Tips for Future Visitors

	‚Ä¢	If the embassy is near Dupont Circle, or it‚Äôs Japan or Korea (these two especially with insanely long lines), get there early. Lines can get very long‚Äîeven by 10 AM.

	‚Ä¢	That said, some of the smaller or lesser-known embassies, especially those farther from the metro, end up being the most rewarding. They tend to put more effort into it and are often more generous with time, conversation, and free samples.

	‚Ä¢	We‚Äôve found that we learn the most‚Äîand have the best conversations‚Äîat the embassies that don‚Äôt draw massive crowds.

‚∏ª

Overall, it‚Äôs an amazing event and I love how popular it‚Äôs become. It‚Äôs a great way to explore different cultures, histories, and especially foods‚Äîall without leaving DC. We‚Äôre very excited to try more next year.

Also has anyone gone to the Korea/Japan/Indonesia embassies? We wanted to try them but we weren‚Äôt sure if it was worth the wait. Especially since it felt like we could visit 3/4 different embassies in the time it would take to get into one of those.",8,1746304721.0,washingtondc,0,1.0,False

Namesake\:Tyler, The Creator.

Anime Debut\:Some Random epilogue episode in Part 5.

Goal\:To prove he‚Äôs can be/become a capable person.

Occupation\:School Student, Part-Time Barista.

Alias: Incorrigible Fool (By Diavolo).

Age:17

Appearance\:A relatively attractive young man of an extremely unkempt appearance, TairƒÅ‚Äôs body language consists of various signs of constant nervousness. He has dark circles under his white eyes, indicating a lack of sleep. He wears disheveled black hair resembling bedhead that sticks up in every which way. TairƒÅ has a rather lean build with a 4 pack, and he‚Äôs rather strong physically despite appearing scrawny.

Personality: A orphan who doesn‚Äôt understand his purpose in life, TairƒÅ is shown to be very nervous and unconfident from his body language alone. He describes events around him as ‚Äúnever going his way‚Äù due to his abhorrent clumsiness and lack of skill in most areas. Because of this lack of precision, he usually ends up on the floor somehow when doing even the simplest of tasks. He seems to become extremely capable only when not in his right state of mind, such as when the Russian Mafia drugged him and he managed to slaughter all of them in a matter of minutes. Another example of this would be when TairƒÅ is angered, as his rage will usually consume his actions to the point he‚Äôll become much more precise in actions directed towards whatever pissed him off. TairƒÅ is a rather non confrontational person and will be kind to anyone who doesn‚Äôt actively try to harm him. He has actively caused multiple accidents such as car crashes without meaning to, placing him under probation in Japan. He now currently lives in the attic of a Coffee Shop  with the owner as his Legal Guardian. TairƒÅ is stated to have severe amnesia which only momentarily goes away within life-or-death situations and combat, as he is unaware of what stand even of and that he possesses one until his amnesia goes away. This has gone on to a point he effectively has 2 seperate personalities. Tyler‚Äôs origial personality  is much more serious and calculated, and also has knowledge of stands and is willing to kill if needed.

Stand Name: St. Chroma.

Stand Type: Semi-Automatic/Close-range. It will alter depending on TairƒÅ‚Äôs amnesia status.

Stand Appearance and Behavior(when TairƒÅ is amnesiac): A seemingly translucent humanoid stand. Translucent enough to see through, but not completely invisible. It acts independently and has little to no care for any of TairƒÅ‚Äôs actions so long as they don‚Äôt risk him getting injured or anything of the like. It only has 1 singular vague command, ‚ÄúProtect Your User‚Äù. It will do this to devastating efficiency, not allowing TairƒÅ to be harmed. Its power does not decrease the further away it goes in this state, though it will always stay close to its user, passively protecting TairƒÅ and engaging in combat with any threat without him knowing most of the time.

Amnesiac Stats: Power-B Speed-A Range-A Precision-B Durability-B Potential-A

Stand Appearance (In Lucid State or when Amnesia is gone): St. Chroma takes the form of a humanoid stand with proportions and build similar to that of TairƒÅ himself. Half of its body is black the other half white. It wears what seems to be a green army general vest and well as Khaki pants. On its vest, it bolsters and wears a number of medals, each one shaped like and representing a person it has killed. It wears a mask over its face akin to the face of TairƒÅ. Under the mask, it‚Äôs true face is monstrous with 3 eyes and white lines coming down its face seemingly representing teardrops.

Stand Ability: ‚ÄúContrary‚Äù-St. Chroma can effectively reverse anything within a 5 meter radius. The levels of reversal can vary depending on either St. Chroma or TairƒÅ‚Äôs own desire. Such as simply reflecting something back where it came from (Such as an attack or weapon), returning something to a past state (such as de-aging or restoration), reversing the effect of something (like making Crazy Diamond‚Äôs healing power do damage instead), inverting (such as when TairƒÅ turned a man inside out), to even flipping the way the natural rules of the world effect the area around him.

I downloaded ProtonVPN first and it was easy to set up, no ads, no sketchy stuff, but the free version only has a few server options and it lagged when I tried streaming on TikTok or YouTube.

1ke2ii5,https://www.reddit.com/r/RetirementReady/comments/1ke2ii5/best_retirement_income_withdrawal_strategies_to/,Best Retirement Income Withdrawal Strategies to Avoid Running Out of Money,"**Hey, RetirementReady friends!**

So, picture this: You‚Äôre sipping a margarita on a sunny beach somewhere, feeling proud because you‚Äôve made it to retirement. Then suddenly, the nagging thought hits you‚Äî‚ÄúAm I actually going to run out of money?‚Äù üò± If you‚Äôve ever had this mini panic attack, you‚Äôre not alone! 

Let‚Äôs dive into some withdrawal strategies that can help you work smarter, not harder, so you can keep enjoying those sun-soaked moments without the ‚Äúwhat if‚Äù hanging over your head!

**1. The 4% Rule: Your Retirement Safety Net?**  
This classic rule suggests you can safely withdraw 4% of your savings each year. This means if you have $1 million saved, you can pull out $40,000. Seems simple, right? Just remember, it‚Äôs an estimate; market fluctuations can throw a wrench in the works! So, consider being a *little* flexible. 

**2. Bucket Strategy: Divide and Conquer!**  
Imagine your savings are divided into three buckets:  
- **Short-term (1-5 years):** Cash and cash equivalents. Think rainy-day funds. üíß  
- **Medium-term (5-10 years):** Bonds and conservative investments. üå±  
- **Long-term (10+ years):** Stocks for growth. A little risk here pays off big time! üìà  

By staggeringly withdrawing from different buckets, you reduce the pressure on your portfolio. Plus, you can still catch that market wave when the time is right!

**3. Adjusting for Inflation: The Sneaky Monster!**  
Ever noticed how that morning coffee keeps getting pricier? Inflation can stealthily eat into your savings. Make sure your withdrawal strategy accounts for this! You might want to increase your withdrawal amount each year to keep up with those rising prices. 

**4. The Idea of a ‚ÄúFloor‚Äù**  
What if you guaranteed a certain amount of income each year? This ‚Äúfloor‚Äù could be from Social Security, pensions, or annuities. It‚Äôs like having a cozy safety net, so no matter what, you‚Äôre still covered for the essentials‚Äîlike that coffee, because who can start the day without it? ‚òïÔ∏è

**5. Flexibility is Key!**  
Life is unpredictable, isn‚Äôt it? You might need to pivot based on unexpected costs or changes in your lifestyle. Be open to adjusting your withdrawal percentage as needed. Some years, you might spend more, and others, less. 

**Bonus Tip: Don‚Äôt Forget to Have Fun!**  
Don‚Äôt let the fear of running out of money overshadow your golden years. Schedule fun experiences‚Äîtake that trip, buy the shoes, indulge a little. Life is short, and you're here to enjoy it! üåû

So what do you think? Are you inspired to rethink how you're planning those withdrawals? Remember, it's a journey, not a race. And hey, we‚Äôre all in this together! What strategies do you think could work for you?",1,1746304540.0,RetirementReady,0,1.0,False

I hope you're all doing well. I'm reaching out here during a challenging time in my life with a request for a little assistance. I tried to reach out last week with little to no response.

Right now, I'm sitting in a Dunkin' Donuts, actively job hunting and trying to get back on my feet. Unfortunately, I'm currently experiencing homelessness and living out of my car, which can start for AC and charging but is out of gas.

I'm kindly asking for any help you can offer for gas and coffee. I understand that not everyone may be comfortable sending money, so I am more than willing to accept gift cards for coffee or a small treat, if that feels safer for you.

Any assistance would truly be appreciated and would make a big difference in my current situation. Thank you so much for your kindness and support during this difficult time.

Potassium supplement - 315 mg of potassium  
'Salt' supplement - 509 mg of sodium, 300 mg of potassium, 57 mg of magnesium

Vitamin D daily supplement  
Omega 3 daily supplement  
0.5 tea spoon of himalayan pink salt

**The supplements are in form of a capsule rather than powder. Is that ok?**

For the most part I feel fine, I go on 1 hour+ walks every day and do around 4 miles. Like once or twice a day I feel a bit dizzy when I stand up but only for a brief moment. My mouth/throat can at times, especially after the walk feel really dry but once I drink some water it subsides.

I try to drink 3 liters of water per day, on some days I also drink green tea and pure black coffee.

**My question is: is my electrolyte balance ok or should I add/subtract anything? Would you add anything?**

Thanks in advance for any advice.

**EDIT:** So I just read up on the wiki that is available and checked out recommended daily dosages plus something about capsules not being optimal. And clearly my current dosages are too small. So what I think I'll do is I'll get rid of the capsule supplements I am taking right now and instead get an electrolyte powder like snake juice and take it 3 times a day.",1,1746304396.0,fasting,3,1.0,False

English Literature.
I said it once in front of a room full of different major students, and suddenly I wasn‚Äôt a student anymore, I was a joke.
""Oh, that‚Äôs all about reading stories, right?""
""Must be easy. Just a bunch of poems and coffee.""
""You took it because you didn‚Äôt want pressure, didn‚Äôt you?""
No.
I took it because I wanted to feel. Because I wanted to learn how to listen, not just to people, but to pages, to metaphors, to silences.

But no one saw that. No one saw me scribbling frantic notes on Kafka because something about the way Josef K. felt like a reflection of my own confusion.
No one knew I couldn‚Äôt sleep after reading about Anna‚Äôs loneliness or that I reread Gatsby just to understand why I, too, sometimes want the green light that‚Äôs never mine.

They think we don‚Äôt study. That we sit in cafes and underline pretty lines for the aesthetic. But they didn‚Äôt see how hard it was to write about trauma in fiction while still holding my own pieces together.

So yeah, maybe it‚Äôs not about formulas or finance. But it‚Äôs about people. And pain. And love. And loss. And every little thing most don‚Äôt have time to sit with.

Posting because I really don‚Äôt know how to feel about this and I just needed to get it off my chest. Sorry for the loooooong ass post, there‚Äôs a lot to unpack.

Backstory first. So around 2 years ago, my ex fianc√©, who I‚Äôd been in a relationship with for almost 10 years unceremoniously just left me. 

It never fully made sense to me as there were no warning signs, we were actively planning our wedding and finally agreed to try for a baby, as we were both in our 30‚Äôs and time was ticking. Then one day, he just started acting sort of off, wasn‚Äôt saying I love you before he left for work for the day, was spending more time out drinking with his friends than he was at home. He‚Äôd been struggling with his mental health since Covid lockdowns so I assumed he was having a bit of a downward spiral. So I sat down with him one day and just asked him if everything was okay with him, he tried to brush it off initially and kept saying he was fine, so I changed the question and asked if we were okay, he looked like he really didn‚Äôt want to answer, so I asked again, he paused and in that moment, I knew, it was over. I asked if he still loved me, he said he loved me but wasn‚Äôt in love with me anymore. And that was it, within a week, he had moved out, leaving 90% of his belongings to be collected at a later date and to serve as a constant reminder that he was just gone.

To say it hit me hard was an understatement, I spiralled massively, I was at the lowest point I had ever been in my life, so I tried to end it all, it just hurt too much feeling like there was something so wrong with me that he had to just leave.

Fortunately a friend managed to get me to a hospital before I did any serious damage to myself and while I still felt awful about myself most of the time, it got a little easier.

I ended up dating that friend a few months later. A lot of people said it was too soon to move on, but honestly I never set out to have another relationship at all, but his constant support, presence and reassurance that there was nothing wrong me made me want to spend time with those who truly gave a shit about me, and in time we developed feelings for each other. We had a beautiful relationship filled with love and laughter, and much to our surprise I ended up pregnant 9 months into our relationship, we decided to keep the baby even though our relationship was still in its early stages and 9 months later our beautiful daughter was born. We are still as strong as ever today and continuing to build an amazing life together as a family.

Now onto present day, I guess my ex has been reflecting on the past recently due to a lot of deaths in his family and his mother (who I‚Äôm still close with today) reached out to me to asked whether I‚Äôd be willing to meet up with him as he had something to get off his chest, she didn‚Äôt know what he wanted to talk to me about as it was something he could only discuss with me, but she would understand if I said no.

I decided to think about it for a few days before I agreed that I would meet up with him at a local coffee shop. I got there early because you know, mama needs her caffeine fix with these early morning wake ups and night feeds. I was already sat down when he came in and he gave me the saddest looking smile while I merely just nodded to him and motioned for him to sit down and get out whatever he needed to tell me.

I was a little bit speechless at what he had to say. He said that when we started trying for a baby and nothing was happening even though we were closely tracking my ovulation cycle and testing every day for that sweet spot, he realised something wasn‚Äôt right, so he secretly took a day off work to see a fertility doctor l, they found that due to an undiagnosed issue in one of his testicles, the likelihood of him ever being able to conceive a biological child of his own was incredibly low. He knew that I loved him so deeply that I would‚Äôve given up my dream of having children, just for him and he said he couldn‚Äôt live with that on his conscience, that I deserved to have the life and family I‚Äôd always wanted, only with someone else. He kept apologising profusely for hurting me so much in the process but tried to rationalise that I had got what I‚Äôd wanted in the end, so his plan ultimately worked.

I ultimately sat there silent for a few minutes and just looked at him dead in the eyes and said that that was never his decision to make, he took away my choice and nearly destroyed me in the process. And I got up and left.

It‚Äôs been a few days and I‚Äôm still processing, my partner knew I was meeting up with my ex and he knows something is up but is giving me space until I feel ready to talk about it, but honestly I‚Äôm shook. Like did my ex honestly think I‚Äôd be like okay thanks for letting me know and then we‚Äôd all be friends again.",354,1746304070.0,TrueOffMyChest,40,0.98,False

Anyway, stopped for a weekend trip and then started on this one with much more diligence. 

I feel great physically with much less inflammation. Apparently no joint pain is supposed to be the norm and I must say, I‚Äôm a fan. I‚Äôm 50(m)/ 6‚Äô, I started this current fast at 325.62 and this morning on start of day six I‚Äôm at 311.73.  I‚Äôm planning to continue this until May 8th so I can slowly start re-eating (not the right term) and then ‚Äúcarefully‚Äù enjoy the visit with my family.  They make seafood gumbo so I‚Äôm going to try this new thing called portion control and also only eat when I‚Äôm hungry. 

I‚Äôm not sure about everyone else but I‚Äôm looking forward to actually enjoying life, things like zip lining or skydiving (to heavy for both of those) and keeping up with my wife on hiking trips and generally not miss out on any more of life.  This is what keeps me going the most. 

Here‚Äôs the actual question, do you tell extended family about your fasting knowing they won‚Äôt understand?

Also I started using the Zero app to track progress but I can‚Äôt figure out how to make it go longer than 7 days.  If anyone knows how to do that I would appreciate any tips. 

Anyway, thanks for your time and those who‚Äôve posted before letting me know I‚Äôm not entirely crazy for doing this and that there is a right way.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

<div>### Awaken Your Taste Buds with a Classic Mountain Man Style Breakfast

When you're out camping, a satisfying morning meal can set the tone for the entire day. The Dutch oven mountain man breakfast delivers just that‚Äîa hearty, flavorful feast cooked right over the campfire. This hearty breakfast combines simple ingredients and rustic cooking that conjure the spirit of the pioneers. Mastering this meal means more than just preparing food; it‚Äôs about creating a memorable outdoor experience that fuels your adventure with warmth and energy.

### Selecting the Right Dutch Oven for Campsite Cooking

Choosing a high-quality Dutch oven is crucial for successfully crafting this breakfast. Cast iron Dutch ovens are the most popular for camping because they distribute heat evenly and retain it well. Opt for a size between 8 and 12 inches in diameter, large enough to hold all your ingredients but small enough for manageable heat control. Seasoned cast iron is preferred as it creates a natural non-stick surface and enhances flavor.

Remember, a heavy lid is essential because you‚Äôll be using coals on top and beneath the Dutch oven for consistent cooking. A cooking tripod or sturdy support rack can also help keep the Dutch oven steady above the fire.

### Gathering Ingredients for a Hearty and Balanced Meal

At the heart of the mountain man breakfast are simple, filling ingredients that are easy to pack and store. Here's a checklist of typical staples used in this meal:

- Rustic sausages or smoked bacon for rich, savory flavor
- Eggs to add protein and structure
- Potatoes, diced or sliced, for a satisfying, starchy base
- Onions and bell peppers to enhance flavor and add a subtle sweetness
- Shredded cheese for creaminess and extra richness
- Seasonings such as salt, pepper, paprika, and garlic powder to elevate taste
 
Thanks to its flexibility, you can tweak the ingredients based on dietary preferences or availability, like swapping the meat for mushrooms or adding fresh herbs for extra fragrance.

### Step-by-Step Preparation to Achieve Perfect Results Every Time

Cooking the Dutch oven mountain man breakfast requires attention to timing and layering ingredients for the best texture and flavor. Here‚Äôs a simplified process:

1. **Preheat your Dutch oven:** Position it over the coals to heat evenly.
2. **Saut√© the meats:** Add sausage or bacon and cook until browned. Remove and set aside.
3. **Cook the vegetables:** In the drippings, saut√© onions, bell peppers, and potatoes until softened.
4. **Layer the ingredients:** Return the cooked meat to the pot, then add beaten eggs and sprinkle cheese on top.
5. **Cover and cook:** Place hot coals on the Dutch oven lid and simmer until eggs set and the cheese melts, roughly 15-20 minutes depending on heat.
 
Adjusting the heat by adding or removing coals will help prevent burning and ensure everything cooks evenly.

### Tips to Enhance Your Camping Cooking Experience

Mastering this recipe at your campsite becomes easier with a few expert tricks:

- **Prep ingredients at home:** Chop and measure before your trip to save time and reduce cleanup.
- **Use foil liners:** Placing a piece of heavy-duty foil inside the Dutch oven can simplify cleaning without affecting flavor.
- **Bring cooking utensils:** A sturdy spatula and heat-resistant gloves are essential for safe handling.
- **Control the fire:** Work with a bed of coals instead of open flames for more predictable cooking temperatures.
- **Keep fuel handy:** Bring extra charcoal or wood to maintain the heat.
 
### Why This Breakfast Is Perfect for the Outdoor Adventurer

The Dutch oven mountain man breakfast aligns perfectly with the demands of outdoor living. It‚Äôs nutrient-dense and packed with protein and carbohydrates that provide lasting energy for hiking, fishing, or exploring. Moreover, cooking in a Dutch oven over an open fire fosters connection to nature and taps into a rich culinary tradition. The charred aroma, sizzling sounds, and satisfying flavors all combine to create camping memories that last far beyond the meal itself.

### Further Customization and Serving Suggestions

This breakfast is incredibly versatile and can be adapted to suit different tastes and dietary needs:

- For a vegetarian version, replace meat with hearty mushrooms or plant-based sausage alternatives.
- Add fresh herbs like parsley or chives post-cooking for brightness.
- Serve with toasted campfire biscuits or hearty bread to complete the meal.
- Include fresh fruit or a hot cup of coffee for a balanced start to your day.
 
These additions transform the dish into a camp-friendly feast that can please everyone around the fire.

</div>Creative Variations to Elevate Your Mountain Man Breakfast Outdoors
-------------------------------------------------------------------

### Crafting Unique Twists on a Classic Campfire Feast

When savoring breakfast outdoors, the Dutch Oven Mountain Man Breakfast stands out as a beloved choice due to its hearty, rustic flavors and simplicity. However, to truly make this meal unforgettable, adding creative variations can transform your morning meal into a culinary adventure. These flavorful twists not only satisfy your hunger but also bring new excitement to your camping routine.

### Boost Flavors with Fresh and Seasonal Ingredients

One easy way to elevate your mountain man breakfast is by incorporating fresh, seasonal ingredients. Fresh vegetables like bell peppers, tomatoes, or spinach can brighten up the dish with vibrant colors and nutrients. Consider chopping up some wild mushrooms you find nearby‚Äîjust be sure of their safety before cooking! These natural elements add a delicious depth of flavor and keep your breakfast connected to the surrounding environment.

### Experimenting with Protein Options

The traditional mountain man breakfast often features sausage or bacon, but swapping these proteins changes the dynamic considerably. Try diced smoked turkey or grilled chicken for a leaner take. For a plant-based option, adding seasoned tofu or tempeh can offer that savory element while keeping things hearty. Additionally, experiment with different types of sausage such as chorizo or spicy Italian for bold new taste profiles that will tantalize your palate.

### Adding Roots and Tubers for Heartiness

Potatoes typically make their way into this breakfast, but branching out with other roots can create a fresh texture and flavor. Sweet potatoes bring a touch of sweetness, while parsnips and turnips add a subtle earthy tone. These can be cubed and mixed into your Dutch oven for roasting alongside your eggs and meat. The addition of these tubers gives an extra heartiness that helps fuel long outdoor adventures.

### Spicing It Up with Herbs and Seasonings

Herbs are a game-changer for adding complexity without complexity. Experiment with fresh rosemary, thyme, or sage to complement the smoky flavors of the Dutch oven cooking process. If you‚Äôre aiming for a spicier dish, sprinkle in some cayenne pepper, smoked paprika, or crushed red pepper flakes. These spices enhance the savory components and provide a warming kick that‚Äôs perfect for chilly outdoor mornings.

### Cheese for Creaminess and Richness

Cheese is a versatile ingredient that melts beautifully in a Dutch oven. Adding shredded cheddar, monterey jack, or pepper jack before finishing the dish amps up the creamy texture. Feta or goat cheese crumbles lend a tangy contrast that pairs well with herbs and vegetables. Cheese not only enriches the flavor but also adds a satisfying mouthfeel, making your breakfast feel indulgent yet comforting.

### Try Layering for Textural Contrast

When cooking your mountain man breakfast in a Dutch oven, consider layering the ingredients strategically. Start by saut√©ing onions and peppers at the bottom, follow with your choice of protein and veggies, then finish with eggs and cheese on top. This method helps cook everything evenly while creating a delightful mix of textures‚Äîfrom soft eggs to tender vegetables and crispy edges. Layering also allows the flavors to meld nicely during cooking, enhancing the overall taste experience.

### Incorporate Sweet Elements for Balance

Adding a hint of sweetness can provide an unexpected but welcome contrast in a savory dish. Serve the breakfast with a side of caramelized apples, grilled peaches, or even a drizzle of maple syrup over crispy bacon bits. You might also try stirring in a splash of honey or brown sugar before cooking sweet potatoes inside the Dutch oven. These subtle touches introduce a new level of flavor harmony that awakens your taste buds.

### Customize with Sauces and Toppings

Bringing along a variety of sauces or toppings lets everyone tailor their mountain man breakfast to personal preferences. Think smoky barbecue sauce, tangy salsa, or a dollop of sour cream to complement savory ingredients. Fresh chopped green onions, sliced avocado, or even pickled jalape√±os pack an extra punch of freshness and texture. These easy additions don‚Äôt require extra cooking but vastly improve the enjoyment of your outdoor meal.

### Other Creative Cooking Techniques

While the Dutch oven is traditionally used over campfire coals, you can also experiment with adding a cast-iron griddle or skillet to your gear. Using these tools, you might prepare crispy hash browns or toast bread alongside your main dish, giving a complete mountain man breakfast experience. These techniques introduce contrast and additional flavors, making your meal more dynamic and fulfilling.

These creative variations transforms the typical Dutch Oven Mountain Man Breakfast into a versatile feast. By using fresh ingredients, diverse proteins, and clever seasoning, you invite new tastes and textures into your camping mornings. These ideas cater not only to traditionalists seeking comfort but also to those eager to explore and innovate while enjoying the great outdoors.

### Conclusion

Embracing the art of the Dutch Oven Mountain Man Breakfast transforms your camping mornings into something truly special. By mastering key techniques such as managing heat, layering ingredients properly, and selecting hearty, flavorful components, you set the stage for a robust and satisfying meal that fuels your outdoor adventures. These essential tips not only ensure your breakfast cooks evenly but also help preserve the rich, rustic taste that makes this camping feast a memorable experience.

Beyond the basics, adding creative variations to your mountain man breakfast opens up a world of flavor possibilities. Whether you incorporate locally sourced vegetables, experiment with different spices, or swap traditional meats for plant-based alternatives, each twist brings a unique touch to the dish. These inventive ideas not only keep your menu fresh and exciting but also cater to diverse tastes and dietary needs while maintaining the hearty spirit of the meal.

TL/DR: Is there video recording software from Adobe for the iPhone that will allow external mics to connect? 

The other dayI was sitting outside a coffee shop on Haight Street in San Francisco recording a video for a friend. It was a little breezy, but I thought nothing of it. When I got home I realize the sound was TERRIBLE. I'm not used to how much background noise the iPhone picks while recording in the native Camera app because almost all of my videos are recorded in my quiet flat. So, I did some research on getting an external mic. I found a reasonably good external mic to get, but also found out that the Camera app doesn't allow  connection from bluetooth audio inputs. 

I was looking through other video recording apps and every one of them that I could find had an overly suspicious In App Purchase model. To hell with that. I already pay for a monthly Creative Cloud subscription, so maybe there's an Adobe app I can put on my phone that will capture video while allowing an external bluetooth mic. Bonus points for editing capabilities. 

Is there such a thing that will fit the bill?

I turned to spiritual work. It's not about ""magic wands"" or controlling people, it's about healing, restoring bonds, and guiding lost love back through spiritual channels.

I was in the military, and I got stationed in San Angelo Texas. I decided to try Benefiber, and it worked great, I started taking the hugest, smoothest poops I'd ever taken, every single morning after breakfast.

I was eating the same thing every day at the military dining facility:
For breakfast: some oatmeal, a little pineapple two hard-boiled eggs, and cup of coffee.

For lunch: a salad of mixed greens and spinach, cukes, black olives, bacon bits and cheese, a couple slices of whatever roasted meat they had, some craisins, and a cup of coffee.

For dinner: the same thing as lunch, minus the coffee.

I would drink the Benefiber in a glass of water before bed at night.

I was the happiest and the most clear-headed I've ever been during those six months in San Angelo.

I got stationed in Maryland after that. I kept eating the same things and taking Benefiber, but for whatever reason the Benefiber stopped working. I would go like 5 or 6 days without taking a bowel movement, and then only squeeze out a pencil-thin bm every now and then. I had to stop taking Benefiber. Ive gone back to having stomach problems all the time.

Many times since then, I've tried taking Benefiber again (making sure to drink lots of water) but it always completely stops me up now. It's been about two years since I was taking Benefiber with great success while in San Angelo, and it makes me super depressed that I can't get back to that point.

1ke24fa,https://www.reddit.com/r/whole30/comments/1ke24fa/r2d3/,R2D3!,"Hi all! I'm back for another round after my first one in January that really changed my life. I went from high blood pressure to normal-high, lost 15 lbs and 7 inches, went from heavy drinking (11-12 drinks per week) to moderate (2-3 per week after W30). Additionally, my first W30 taught me an insane amount about boundaries, the psychological value of food in our family, how to care for myself well by setting apart time to prepare nourishing food, etc. It really changed my life.

Anyway, I thought I would share what I've been eating because the jump into it hasn't been so tough this time! A few things that helped me are: I started drinking black coffee during W30 and just never stopped, I already had identified a bunch of brands at CostCo and Kroger that are compliant, and I learned to make a few things that really help tide over the transition. 

I cook more or less everything in my house, and I have a partner, a 14 y/o and a 12 y/o. I just add non-W30 elements to the meals for them. I LOVE to cook, so I do not consider this a burden.

I started therapy for the first time earlier this year, and I quickly realized I was attracted to my therapist. She's incredibly beautiful, and honestly, I hoped she'd be more cold and distant ‚Äî but she wasn‚Äôt. She was warm, welcoming, and kind.

In just our second session, I disclosed my experience with SA, and she shared her own story in response. It felt like a pivotal moment in building emotional trust and connection between us. During that same session, she told me that she doesn‚Äôt just forget about clients when the session ends ‚Äî that my story stuck with her.

She also told me I was beautiful, and once asked if I‚Äôd ever had a boyfriend or girlfriend. When I said no, she replied,¬†*‚ÄúWell, they must all be blind.‚Äù*¬†That moment intensified my emotions and attachment. She continued to compliment my appearance in later sessions and said I must get a lot of attention because I‚Äôm ‚Äúvery attractive.‚Äù At another point, when I told her I felt like a burden, she said,¬†*‚ÄúYou‚Äôre my priority.‚Äù*

I eventually came out to her as a lesbian. She was the first person I ever told, and she said she was ""honoured"" and even admitted she sometimes questions her own sexuality from time to time.

She encouraged me to text her anytime if I felt low, and said we could even meet outside of sessions. Our hugs at the end of each session lasted 10‚Äì20 seconds ‚Äî always tight, always meaningful. One night, when things turned violent in my home, I texted her at 1AM in distress. I didn‚Äôt expect a reply, but she responded with:¬†*‚ÄúI‚Äôm here for you not just as a therapist, but because I care x.‚Äù*¬†She even offered to send a taxi to bring me to her house to stay the night. I declined, but she then suggested we meet for coffee another time.

My feelings for her grew, and eventually I wrote her a letter and made her a CD with some of my favorite songs ‚Äî Jeff Buckley, Adrianne Lenker, and others. My mom found it before I had the chance to give it to her. She immediately messaged my therapist to tell her I was in love and demanded she cut off contact with me ‚Äî all before I got the chance to speak for myself.

I feel so embarrassed and exposed. I don‚Äôt know how to move forward from this. I feel violated, confused, and heartbroken. What do I do now? Has anyone else been through something similar? I'm struggling to make sense of what happened and what to do next.

I sent her a follow-up text to say the following:

*""I‚Äôm really sorry. I feel so disheartened that this is how things unfolded. My mum found the gifts I made and was planning to give to you and immediately knew their meaning and context.* 

*I never meant for this to happen and I‚Äôm so ashamed, but I completely understand if you think a break is necessary for the therapeutic process or even termination if you feel that is what‚Äôs best. I just wanted to acknowledge it myself rather than hearing it second hand.*

 *I sincerely apologise if you‚Äôve taken any offence at all or have made you feel uncomfortable. I know it‚Äôs very stupid and illogical. I understand the importance of your role, the ethical duties and would never want to jeopardise your career or life. I completely understand it would never be reciprocated and I never expected it to be. I just wanted to say thank you again for everything. I can‚Äôt thank you enough. My appreciation and respect is beyond measure.""*

And she replied with this: 

*""Therapists cannot accept gifts. You have not at all made me feel uncomfortable or offended. As my client and as your over the age of 16 confidentiality is paramount and termination etc is your decision. Take some time to work on what we discussed yesterday. I wish you all the best in the future.""*

I haven't stopped crying all day, (And I'm on antidepressants so it takes a different kind of pain to accept lol). I just feel so heartbroken. It wasn't just a silly crush or me just thinking ""she's hot"". I really did emotionally connect with her. She meant everything to me. She was the first person I came out to, the first person I confided in about issues I have buried for years, the first person who actually made me feel seen... the person who saved my life. My heart is shattered. Of course I knew it would never be reciprocated and I never expected anything in return, but I'm just so sad I didn't have the opportunity to do it on my terms and the dismissal just felt so cold and part of me is wondering did she ever really care or was I just a paycheck. This feels like genuine heartbreak and grievance. 

I sent her this text tonight:

‚ÄúHi, hope you‚Äôre doing okay. I‚Äôm so sorry for the short notice (just back from work), but I was wondering if by any chance you might be up for casual drinks tonight ‚Äî just for a chat. It doesn‚Äôt have to be long, even just a quick 20 minute catch up. We can go into town or wherever is closeby‚Äî whatever‚Äôs easiest for you.

I‚Äôd really appreciate the chance to express a few things, clear everything up and have some closure, even if it‚Äôs just for one last time. Of course, I completely understand if it doesn‚Äôt suit, or if you have other plans because I know it‚Äôs very last minute. If you‚Äôd prefer, we could meet for coffee tomorrow instead.

More than anything, I want to respect your boundaries, and I completely understand if you‚Äôd rather not meet at all. If you‚Äôd prefer no further contact after this, I‚Äôll absolutely respect that. I hope you‚Äôll consider. Best wishes :)‚Äù

It‚Äôs been 2 hours since and she has not responded, but her silence speaks volumes. I am so heartbroken. After everything I told her and everything she did, I just can‚Äôt believe she would drop me like I‚Äôm nothing. I also sent her extra money for staying up and texting me at 2AM. She told me in my next and final session that she would do another session with me free of charge because while it was generous of me, I shouldn‚Äôt have sent her that extra money as she didn‚Äôt ask for it. But now, it seems like she‚Äôs going to be keeping my money because I doubt she is going to give it back. She also left me at a time SHE KNOWS i‚Äôm struggling with my mental health. I lost my job, constantly fighting with my parents, addicted to cannabis, all of which she knows. She also knows I had seriously bad suicidal ideation at the end of last year. I just thought as a therapist she would have been more considerate of my mental health. I wouldn‚Äôt have cared if she even just texted me back to say ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt contact me again‚Äù. But her silence is deafening and honestly feels like an insult and a slap in the face. I am so beyond hurt, angry, tearful, etc.

So I am doing extensive research on this and stumbled upon a research which mentioned MDD as DMN (Default Mode Network) dysregulation further they mention people with ADHD, OCD, Derealization, schizophrenia, psychosis basically it is DMN its opposite to TPN The (Task-Positive Network) people with MDD have issues exactly with DMN Dysfunction, 

I decided to go with ADHD as I cannot relate with others (fortunately) and made a stack to mimic adderall like effect so I made this and within an hour my MDD stopped and my Brain fog got lifted,

**Coffee + L-tyrosine (Dopamine precursor) + L-theanine (to counter too much dopamine) + L-taurine (Taurine makes dopamine synthesis better)** 

This combo stopped all the chatter in my brain, No daydreaming and complete focus plus good energy and euphoria,

MDD is basically chasing dopamine, Please visit therapist and get diagnosed or give nootropics a try, 

please also look into serotogenic depression vs Doparmiginic  depression 

This research will help you if you fall in to it, 

Thank you, ",0,1746303268.0,MaladaptiveDreaming,0,0.5,False

Sports water bottle.
It's insulated. The size is just right for me. It's suitable for carrying during sports, and it's also great for taking coffee with me when going out.

CK underwear.
It's really beyond my expectations. It's made of 100% pure cotton!

Adidas knee-high socks.
The quality is really good. They are softer than I expected, and they are a great choice.

Denim shorts.
I have to say that the texture of these denim shorts is top-notch. They fit me perfectly. The stitching and the workmanship of the zipper are excellent, and the color is very sophisticated. I can make a lot of different outfits with them.

Always do what you should do denim long pants.
To be honest, I wasn't really interested in black denim pants originally. Since the price was so good, I picked one up by the way. But I was so surprised when I got it. The texture is very high-end. It's a straight-leg denim pant and it's very comfortable. I've changed my opinion of this brand.

GD blue T-shirt.
No surprises. It performs steadily as always. The print is made of rubber.

GD black denim shorts.
This style has been on my shopping list for a long time, but I didn't really like it when I got the actual item. It's too tight, and the size runs small for me.

RHUDE T-shirt.
This color is perfect for summer. The size I bought fits me very well, and it looks great on me. The texture of the shirt is just right, not too thick.

Acne studios long-sleeved black T-shirt.
The cutting of the shirt is just so-so, but the texture is good. I don't think it looks as good as in the picture, but luckily it's not expensive.

Acne studios.
This is definitely a qualified white T-shirt. Both the texture and the workmanship are top-notch. I think I'll wear it quite often.

Acne studios white long-sleeved T-shirt.
Just like the black one, I don't really like this one either.

Supreme black T-shirt.
It's of high quality, but the logo is not reflective.

Sunglasses.
I prepared these sunglasses for my trip. I think they are quite good.

Saint T-shirt.
It has a special color. The print with the donut makes the overall color look very pleasant. Most importantly, the price is really good, so it's a great choice.

A TEE.
Both the print and the details are excellent. No need to say more. This is the second time I've bought this T-shirt.

RHUDE black T-shirt.
Compared to the other one, this one has the classic big logo. It goes well with everything, and the texture is also top-notch.",49,1746303175.0,FashionReps,4,0.99,False

1ke1zqe,https://www.reddit.com/r/Microbiome/comments/1ke1zqe/benefiber_suddenly_stopped_working/,Benefiber suddenly stopped working.,"I've always had stomach issues. Mainly constipation.

I was in the military, and I got stationed in San Angelo Texas. I decided to try Benefiber, and it worked great, I started taking the hugest, smoothest poops I'd ever taken, every single morning after breakfast.

I was eating the same thing every day at the military dining facility:
For breakfast: some oatmeal, a little pineapple two hard-boiled eggs, and cup of coffee.

For lunch: a salad of mixed greens and spinach, cukes, black olives, bacon bits and cheese, a couple slices of whatever roasted meat they had, some craisins, and a cup of coffee.

For dinner: the same thing as lunch, minus the coffee.

I would drink the Benefiber in a glass of water before bed at night.

I was the happiest and the most clear-headed I've ever been during those six months in San Angelo.

I got stationed in Maryland after that. I kept eating the same things and taking Benefiber, but for whatever reason the Benefiber stopped working. I would go like 5 or 6 days without taking a bowel movement, and then only squeeze out a pencil-thin bm every now and then. I had to stop taking Benefiber. Ive gone back to having stomach problems all the time.

Many times since then, I've tried taking Benefiber again (making sure to drink lots of water) but it always completely stops me up now. It's been about two years since I was taking Benefiber with great success while in San Angelo, and it makes me super depressed that I can't get back to that point.

Does anyone know what might be the problem? Thanks.",3,1746303102.0,Microbiome,1,1.0,False
