My partner and I have been together for 12 years. I’m starting to process everything that’s happened over that time, and I’m realizing how much I’ve minimized or excused. I’d really appreciate input—has anyone actually come out the other side of something like this, stronger?

Some of what’s happened over the years:

Gaslighting/emotional invalidation:
	•	He used to walk away from me when upset—at public events, with his friends—and leave me to figure out what I did wrong. He’d be angry but not speak to me or stay with me. He has stopped doing this… but he did do it for the first two years of our relationship. He told me (today) that he thinks it stems from grade school when he would walk away and want people to follow him. 
	•	I told him porn felt like cheating to me because of past trauma…. This was when our relationship started. I had an ex who was addicted to it. I caught him watching it anyway and lied about it, even after we moved in together and I was a single mom…. Again this was 12 years ago. But I did catch him with it at night, in secret… I haven’t caught him since and he says he hasn’t looked at any. 
	•	One night when I saw flashlights on our property, he insisted it was lightning or our kids playing with flashlights. I went out alone with the dogs and ended up calling the police. A year later, he still insisted that it could have been leaving our car messed up… Even though it did happen. 
	•	He used to like and comment on half-naked women’s photos on Facebook. When I told him it hurt me, he brushed it off, said it meant nothing, and that he was just admiring their tattoos. This happened at the beginning of the relationship, and he said he never wanted me to be a tattoo model (I’m tattooed, so is he), and that he wouldn’t like that if I did it. But he stated that he was “just looking at their tattoos” last night. And then today I told him that’s just lying… because of course he’s looking at their naked/half naked bodies?!

His mother’s behavior toward me:
	•	She once told me I was selfish for eating leftovers out of their fridge (I didn’t have much I could eat at the time, I have allergies, they were leftovers in my own home she was a guest in). 
	•	She asked if I brushed my teeth, because of coffee stains—I couldn’t afford the dentist back then.
	•	She asked if I was bisexual (I’m not) and it felt really intrusive and judgmental.
	•	She commented on a public Facebook post, criticizing me for “turning my back on their family after everything they’d done for me.” And more, but in paragraph form. The post I had made was about how I was trying a new diet and had nothing to do with them or the family. Just me. 
	•	She told me, to my face, that she doesn’t understand why people like me. That she doesn’t know that person or why they like me. But she hasn’t gotten to know me in 12 years??? 
	•	For over a decade, my husband insisted she wasn’t being mean. Only very recently has he started acknowledging any of this. She even said the last point in front of him- and he did nothing. And there’s more…  comments about me doing things the hard way, how I live in my own little world (I was working while she was a guest again…) and she tried to make her opinion important when we decided not to circumcise our son… 

I’ve finally figured out the pattern of him gaslighting me…. It was hard to see. But he does it. He even did it two days ago… 
He says he wants to change, and that he didn’t realize what he was doing. He says he wants to help me heal. He’s no longer walking away or watching porn, and he’s said some honest things lately. But there’s still gaslighting, and it’s hard to trust what’s real anymore.

Is it even possible to come back from this? Has anyone actually repaired a relationship after years of this kind of damage—or is that just something people hope for?",1,1746130231.0,JUSTNOMIL,1,1.0,False
1kci9n4,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1kci9n4,My Day Planner - There may be signs...,"Towards the end of last year I started using a daily journal, where in I write down what I do with my time, and how long projects take. The goal of this started out less as planning, and more teaching myself to be aware of just how bad my time blindness is and to learn to accommodate accordingly. 

Rather than writing what I am going to do for the day and what time, I write in it as tasks are completed, and make note of how long they took. I found it also helps to keep me focused on the tasks at hand, because if I am vaccuming the house, I can't just stop and start sorting through what's on the coffee table or else it interferes with timing how long the vacuuming took. 

It's still very much a work in progress, and there are days that I miss completely, but one of the things medication has helped with is allowing me to abandon the all or nothing mentality I used to have. Now I can skip a day, hell even a week, and not feel like a total failure. I can just pick right up again and continue on. 

The placement of the stickers is also brought to you by Vyvanse, LOL. To place my first one, I figured I would give the cover a quick wipe down with alcohol to ensure the sticker would adhere better. Turns out the alcohol ate away at it instead, leaving all of those white damaged swipes.  Unmedicated me would have been utterly destroyed by ruining my shiny new book, and been absolutely debilitated by my stupidity and clearly lack of self-worth.

Instead, I felt disappointed, a little angry with myself, then resolved that the solution was just to add even more stickers until you could barely notice that the damage on the cover wasn't just a part of it. So I went online and ordered a bunch of stickers that I liked. 

As I went to put them on (again, something that unmedicated me would have never done because of decision paralysis on where to perfectly place the stickers), I realized that there is a bit of a theme in my selection, LOL.  I figured I would share it in a place where it could be truly appreciated!",1,1746130048.0,adhdwomen,1,1.0,False

Let me tell you a tale of chaos, charm, and pure dumb luck. It all went down in my loud, fast-paced town between April 30 and May 1, 2025. I’m 24, and what I’m about to confess is a mix of quick thinking, questionable choices, and one surprisingly resilient car.

It all started on April 30. I was chilling at home when my phone buzzed. It was my best friend from way back—the kind of friend who can make you laugh so hard you forget how to breathe. She texted, “I’m in town! Coffee?” And of course, I said yes. Catching up with her is always a guaranteed good time.

The only hitch? I didn’t have wheels. My uncle’s sleek sedan was sitting in the driveway. He’s pretty laid-back, so I called out, “Can I take the car?” He shouted back, “Sure, just don’t wreck it.” Famous last words.

I grab the keys, pick her up, and we’re off—cruising, laughing about our school days, roasting my terrible playlist. Everything’s golden until we hit this dusty road outside of town. She’s in the middle of a wild story, I’m laughing way too hard—and bam. I misjudge a turn and clip a *tractor*. Yep. A whole tractor.

Luckily, there’s no major damage. The car holds up like a champ—no dents, no scratches… just one cracked headlight staring at me like a giant neon “YOU MESSED UP.” She looks at me, wide-eyed, and says, “Your uncle’s gonna flip.” I throw on a grin and say, “Don’t worry. I’ve got a plan.” Truth? I’m absolutely winging it.

We still grab coffee because, well, priorities. She’s calling it “the great tractor showdown,” and I’m just trying to stay chill. Afterward, I drop her off at my place, park the car like nothing ever happened, and hop on my bike to take her home.

On the way back, I see the neighborhood kids playing cricket—swinging wildly, shouting, typical chaos. I pull up casually and go, “Hey, who’s been breaking stuff? Someone smashed a headlight.” They all deny it instantly and start pointing fingers at some mystery guy who “must’ve hit it and ran.” Bingo. I’ve planted the perfect story.

Back home, my mom’s half-asleep on the couch. She mumbles, “Who took the car?” My heart’s thumping, but I keep my cool. “Didn’t take it. A friend dropped us off. I just biked her home.” Then she asks how I even met up with my friend in the first place without using the car. I make up a quick cover: I got permission from Uncle, and two minutes later, my friend called and said she was outside. Mom was asleep when I left and only woke up after I returned—so the timing checks out in her mind. She buys it.

So far, so good.

Then comes May 1.

That cracked headlight’s still haunting me. That evening, my big brother pulls into the driveway, takes one look, and goes, “What happened to the headlight?” I keep my poker face strong. “No clue. Probably those cricket kids. They’re always hitting stuff.” 

He narrows his eyes, half-convinced. “Yeah, maybe. Those kids never own up to anything.” Thankfully, his phone rings with some work crisis, and he’s too distracted to dig deeper.

So here I am, May 1 night, typing this out with my heart still pounding. The car’s back in the driveway. The headlight’s cracked. But somehow, my story’s still holding up. Mom thinks I got dropped off. My brother blames the kids. And those kids? They’re blaming some imaginary mystery guy—thanks to my smooth little plant.

Will I get away with it forever? Who knows. But for now, I pulled off the *Headlight Hustle*—and that’s one story I’ll never forget.


TL;DR:
I borrowed my uncle’s car to meet an old friend, got distracted while driving, and accidentally cracked a headlight hitting a tractor. To cover it up, I made up a story, planted doubt with the neighborhood kids, and convinced my mom and brother it wasn’t me. So far, the cover-up is holding—barely.

Dear British Airways Customer Relations,
I am writing to formally express my disappointment regarding my recent experience on April 9 on my flight from Vancouver to London. I was traveling in Premium class and had an alert on my ticket noting that I am a nervous flyer. Unfortunately, that designation was not acknowledged or respected in any way.
One of the flight attendants, named Josh, was particularly rude and dismissive throughout the journey. I was spoken to in a harsh tone, with no basic courtesies such as “please” or “thank you,” and I felt as though I was being treated as an economy passenger despite having paid for Premium service.
The breakfast service was also disappointing. Instead of a proper meal, I was handed a wrapped sandwich with no offer of coffee, tea, or any beverage, which is not consistent with the Premium class experience I was expecting and had paid for.
Additionally, on the outbound flight, my leather jacket was removed from the overhead bin and went missing. I reported this immediately and have followed up daily with your Lost and Found team via both email and phone for ten days straight, with no meaningful assistance or resolution provided.
These experiences have left me extremely dissatisfied and disheartened. I expected a higher level of care and service, particularly given my status as a nervous flyer and as a Premium class customer.
I would appreciate a full investigation into these matters, and I request appropriate compensation for both the poor onboard experience and the mishandling of my lost personal item. I would also like to be informed of any changes or corrective actions that may be taken as a result of this complaint.
I look forward to your response

1kci2vh,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepypasta/comments/1kci2vh/after_his_family_died_the_towns_children_started/,"After His Family Died, the Town’s Children Started Vanishing.","Robert Hayes never expected to feel joy again after Anna died. Some nights, he still woke reaching for her—fumbling blindly through the darkness for a hand that would never be there again. Grief, he realized, had a smell: old clothes, cold sheets, unopened mail.

Just before Anna’s passing, the twins had been born—tiny, furious fists clenching at the air. Every new day with them had felt like a second chance. Emma, with her mother's green eyes and fierce little laugh. Samuel, quieter, thoughtful even as an infant, furrowing his brow like he was trying to solve the world's problems.

They filled the house with life again. Noise. Color. Robert cooked terrible pancakes every Sunday—Emma demanding extra syrup, Samuel meticulously sorting his blueberries before eating. He read to them every night, even when they fell asleep halfway through. They built snowmen with mittened hands in the winter, fed ducks at the pond in spring, ran barefoot through sprinklers under the sticky heat of summer.

And every night, after the giggles and the mess and the exhaustion, Robert kissed their foreheads and whispered the same thing: ""I will always protect you.""

He meant it.

That November afternoon was gray and damp, the misty rain making the world look like it was dissolving at the edges. Emma wanted a pumpkin ""big enough to sit inside,"" while Samuel had chosen one lopsided and scarred, insisting it had ""character."" Robert strapped them into their booster seats, singing along with the radio, the car filled with syrupy, sticky laughter.

The semi-truck came out of nowhere. One moment: headlights. The next: twisting metal. Then—silence.

When Robert came to, hanging upside down from his seatbelt, the only sound was the soft hiss of the ruined engine. He screamed for them. Clawed at the wreckage. Dragged himself, bleeding and broken, toward the back. Emma and Samuel were gone. Still buckled in, so small, so still.

At the funeral, Robert stood between two tiny white caskets, staring as faces blurred around him and words tumbled into meaningless noise.

""God has a plan."" ""They're angels now."" ""Time heals.""

Time, Robert thought numbly, had already taken everything.

That night, alone in the nursery, clutching a sock no bigger than his thumb, he whispered the only prayer left to him: ""Bring them back.""

No one answered.

# Chapter 2: Hollow Men

The days after the funeral blurred together, each one a paler copy of the last. Robert woke at dawn, not because he wanted to, but because the house demanded it—cruel reminders of a life that no longer existed. Samuel’s alarm still chirped at seven a.m., a tiny little jingle that once made Samuel giggle under the covers. Robert couldn’t bring himself to turn it off. He brewed coffee he didn’t drink, packed lunches no one would eat, reached for tiny jackets that would never again be worn. Every movement ended the same way: with the silence pressing in like water in a sinking room.

He tried to hold the pieces together at first. Sat stiffly in grief counseling groups while strangers passed sorrow back and forth like trading cards. He nodded at the talk of “stages,” “healing,” “coping,” while his chest felt like it was filling with wet cement. He adopted a dog—a golden retriever named Daisy. The shelter said she was “good with kids.” Robert brought her home, hoping maybe something would spark again. But Daisy only whined at the door, as if she, too, was waiting for children who would never come home. Three days later, he returned her. The woman at the shelter didn’t ask why.

By spring, the house was immaculate, sterile—as if polished grief could make it livable again. The nursery remained untouched. The firetruck sat mid-rescue on the rug. A doll lay half-tucked beneath a tiny pillow, eternally ready for sleep. Sometimes Robert thought he heard them laughing upstairs, voices soft and wild and real as breath. Sometimes, he answered back.

Outside, the world moved on. Children shrieked with joy in parks. Mothers chased toddlers through grocery aisles. Fathers hoisted giggling kids onto their shoulders at county fairs. At first, Robert turned away from these scenes, flinching like they were gunshots. But soon, he began to watch. He stood in the shadows of the elementary school parking lot, leaning against his rusted truck, staring at the children spilling through the doors—backpacks bouncing, shoes untied, voices lifted in a chorus of lives untouched by loss.

""Why them?"" he thought. ""Why not mine?""

The resentment crept in like mold beneath the wallpaper—quiet, patient, inevitable.

One evening, he sat alone in the dim light of the living room. An untouched bottle of whiskey sat on the table, sweating with condensation. The television flickered with cartoons—a plastic family around a plastic dinner table, all laughter and pastel perfection. Robert stared at the screen. Then, without warning, he hurled the remote across the room. It shattered against the wall, leaving a long, ugly crack.

His chest heaved with silent, shaking sobs. Not for Anna. Not even for Emma and Samuel. But for himself. For the man he used to be. For the father he failed to stay.

The next morning, without planning to, Robert drove to the school lot before dawn. The world was still dark, the pavement damp with night. A bright blue minivan caught his eye—plastered with “Proud Parent” stickers and stick-figure decals of smiling children, their parents, and two dogs. Robert knelt beside it, the pocketknife flashing briefly in the dim light. He peeled the tiny stick-figure children from the back window, one by one. Then he slashed the tire, slow and steady, the blade whispering through rubber like breath.

When the mother discovered the damage hours later—cursing, frantic, dragging her children into another car—Robert smiled for the first time in months. A small, broken thing. It didn’t fix anything. It didn’t bring Emma and Samuel back. But it shifted the weight in his chest—just enough for him to breathe.

That night, he dreamed of them. Emma laughing, Samuel running barefoot through the grass, fireflies sparking in the gold-washed twilight. He woke to silence, the dream already fading. But something else stirred beneath the grief.

A flicker.

Control.

# Chapter 3: Seeds of Malice

The second time, it wasn’t enough to slash a tire. Robert needed them to feel it. Not just the inconvenience, not just the momentary panic. He needed them to understand that joy was a fragile, borrowed thing—one that could be ripped away just as suddenly as it was given. Like his had been.

At dusk, the school parking lot stood silent, the last child long since swept up in a waiting minivan. Robert moved through the rows of bicycles like a man walking among gravestones. Each one upright. Untouched. Proud. He slipped a box cutter from his coat pocket. The first brake cable sliced with almost no resistance. Then another. Then another. He moved methodically—his grief becoming surgical.

The next morning, from the privacy of his truck, Robert watched a boy coast down a hill—fast, laughing, light. And then the bike didn’t stop. The child’s face turned. Laughter crumpled into terror. He crashed hard, metal meeting bone. A broken wrist. Blood in his mouth. Screams.

Parents swarmed like bees kicked from a hive, their voices panicked, their eyes wide. Robert didn’t move. He watched it all with hands trembling faintly in his lap.

He thought it would be enough.

But two weeks later, the boy returned. Cast on his arm. A gap where his front teeth had been. And he was laughing again. Like nothing had changed.

Robert’s jaw clenched until it hurt. They hadn’t learned. They had already begun to forget.

The annual Harvest Festival arrived in a blur of orange booths and plastic spiderwebs, cotton candy, and hay bales. Children raced from game to game, cheeks flushed from the cold, arms swinging bags of prizes. He moved through the maze like a ghost. No one looked twice at the man with the hood pulled low. Why would they?

Children leaned over tubs of apples, dunking their heads, emerging with triumphant smiles. Emma would have loved this. She would have squealed with laughter, water dripping from her curls, cheeks red from the chill.

His hands shook as he slipped the crushed glass into the tub. Ground fine—but not invisible. Sharp enough. Just sharp enough. He lingered nearby, heart pounding like a drum inside his ribs.

The first scream cut through the carnival like lightning. A boy stumbled back from the tub, blood streaming from his mouth, his cry high and broken. More screams followed. Mothers pulled their children close. Booths tipped. Lights flickered. The festival collapsed into chaos.

Still—not enough.

Robert returned home and sat in the nursery. The crib was cold. The racecar bed untouched. The silence as thick as syrup. He sat on the hardwood floor, knees to his chest, and whispered:

""They don’t remember you.""

His voice cracked. Not from rage. But from emptiness.

The playground came next. The place they had loved the most.

At three in the morning, Robert crept across the dewy grass, fog clinging low, as if the world were trying to hide what he was becoming. He wore gloves. Moved like a man fixing something broken. He loosened the bolts on the swings just enough that the nuts would fall after a few good pushes. He smeared grease across the rungs of the slide. Buried broken glass beneath the innocent softness of the sandbox. Then he left.

The next day, he parked nearby, watching as the playground filled with children again. The laughter returned so easily, as if it had never left.

Then came the fall.

A boy—maybe six—slipped from the monkey bars and struck his head on the edge of the platform. Blood pooled in the dirt. His mother’s scream sounded like something being torn in half. An ambulance arrived. The playground emptied.

Robert sat in his truck and felt that same flicker in his chest. Not joy. Not peace.

But control.

For a moment, he wasn’t the man who had clutched a tiny sock and begged God to make a trade. He was the one who turned the screws. The one who made the world bend.

He didn’t stop.

# Chapter 4: The Gentle Push

The river ran like an old scar along the edge of Halston, swollen and restless after weeks of rain. Robert stood alone at the water’s edge, the damp earth sucking at his boots, the air cold enough to bite through his coat. Across the park, families moved like faint shadows in the fog, children darting between the trees, their laughter muted and distant, like memories worn thin by time.

He watched them without blinking.

He watched him.

A small boy, maybe five or six years old, wandered away from the others, rain boots slapping through shallow puddles, his coat slipping off one shoulder. Robert saw how easily it happened—the gap between a parent's distracted glance, the careless joy of a child unaware of how quickly the world could take everything from him.

Robert moved without thinking. Not planning. Not deciding. Just following the pull inside him, a pull shaped by loss and stitched together with rage.

He crossed the grass in slow, steady strides, boots silent against the wet earth. When he reached the boy, he didn't say a word. He simply placed a hand on the child's small back—a touch as light as breath, the kind of touch a father might give to steady his son, to guide him back to safety.

But this time, there was no safety.

The boy stumbled forward. The slick ground gave way beneath his boots. His arms flailed once, a startled gasp escaping his mouth, and then the river took him.

No thrashing. No screaming. Just the slow, cold pull of the current swallowing him whole.

Robert turned away before the first cries rang out. He walked into the trees, his breath misting in the frigid air, his hands curling into fists inside his sleeves. Behind him, screams split the fog, voices shattered the quiet—parents running, wading into the water too late.

He didn’t stop. He didn’t look back.

That night, Robert sat cross-legged between Emma’s crib and Samuel’s racecar bed. The nursery smelled of dust and faded dreams. He placed his hands in his lap, palms open like a man offering an apology no one would ever hear, and he whispered into the hollow silence:

""I made it fair.""

The words tasted like ash on his tongue.

For the first time in months, he slept through the night, deep and dreamless.

But morning brought no peace.

By noon, the riverbank had transformed into a shrine. Flowers and stuffed animals lined the muddy ground. Notes written in childish handwriting flapped in the wind. Candles guttered against the damp air. Children stood holding hands, their faces pale with confusion as their parents clutched them tighter, their grief raw and noisy.

Robert drove past slowly, his knuckles white against the steering wheel. He watched them weep, saw their shoulders shake with the weight of a loss they couldn’t contain.

For a moment, he felt something close to satisfaction. A shifting of the scales.

But as he rounded the bend and the river disappeared from view, the satisfaction dissolved, leaving behind a familiar emptiness.

They would mourn today. Tomorrow, they would forget.

They always forget.

# Chapter 5: The Town Crumbles

Three days later, the boy’s body was pulled from the river, tangled in roots and mud, bloated from the cold. The coroner called it an accident. Drowning. A tragic slip. Everyone in Halston nodded and murmured and avoided each other’s eyes. But something changed.

The parks emptied. Sidewalks once buzzing with bikes and hopscotch now lay silent under cloudy skies. Parents walked their children to school in tight clumps, hands gripped a little too tightly, eyes flicking to every passing car. Playgrounds stood deserted beneath creaking swings and rusting chains. But it didn’t last.

A week passed. Then another. The fences around the park came down. Children returned—cautious at first, then louder, bolder. The shrieks of joy returned, diluted with only a trace of caution. The town, like it always did, began to forget.

Robert couldn’t stand it.

He returned to the scene of the first fall—Miller Park—under the cover of fog and early morning darkness. The playground had been repaired. New bolts gleamed beneath the swing seats. New paint shone on the monkey bars.

Robert smiled bitterly. Then he went to work.

He loosened the bolts again, not so much that they would fall immediately, but just enough to ensure failure. Enough to remind. Enough to reopen the wound.

That morning, a boy ran ahead of his mother, eager to swing higher, faster. Robert watched from his truck as the seat tore loose in mid-air, the boy thrown to the gravel below like a puppet with its strings cut. Another scream. Another ambulance. Another tiny victory. But it wasn’t enough.

One broken arm would never equal two coffins.

Thanksgiving loomed, brittle and joyless. Halston strung up lights, tried to bake its way back into comfort, but everything tasted like fear. Robert didn’t feel it soften. If anything, the ache in his chest had sharpened.

He found his next moment during a birthday party—balloons tied to fence posts, paper hats, children screaming with sugared laughter. Seven years old. The age Emma and Samuel would have been.

He watched from the alley behind the house, his jacket dusted with soot to match the disguise—just another utility worker. He didn’t need threats or blackmail this time. He didn’t need help.

Just a soft smile. A kind voice. A simple story about a missing puppy.

The little girl followed him willingly.

In the plastic playhouse near the edge of the yard, Robert tucked her gently beneath unopened presents. Her arms were folded neatly. Her hair smoothed back. He set Emma’s old music box beside her, its tune warped and gasping. It played three broken notes before clicking into silence.

She looked like she was sleeping.

By the time the party noticed she was missing, Robert was already miles away. He drove in silence, humming the lullaby softly under his breath, as if to soothe himself more than her.

But the hollow inside him didn’t shrink.

Winter came early that year. Snow blanketed the sidewalks. The playgrounds stayed empty now—not because of caution, but because of cold. Christmas lights blinked behind drawn curtains. People whispered more often than they spoke.

And still, the town tried to move forward.

Robert watched two boys skipping stones into the water where the river hadn’t yet frozen. They were brothers. They laughed without fear. Without consequence.

Samuel should have had a brother to skip stones with.

Robert crouched beside them. Smiled. Held out a daisy chain he had woven in the truck—white flowers strung together with trembling hands. The boys giggled and reached for it.

He guided them closer to the edge.

One soft push.

The river accepted them.

When their bodies were found seventeen days later, wrapped in each other’s arms beneath a frozen bend, the daisy chain had vanished. But Robert still saw it—looped around their wrists like a crown of thorns.

Elsewhere in town, Linda Moore sat in front of her computer. Her spreadsheet blinked. A child’s name—Eli Meyers—suddenly shifted rows. Not one she had touched. Not one she had assigned.

Beside the name, a new comment appeared: “He looks like Samuel did when he lost his first tooth.”

Then a new tab opened—her niece’s photo, taken from outside the school that morning. Through a window. Across glass.

The screen blinked red: “She still likes hide-and-seek, right?”

Linda’s hands hovered over the keys. She didn’t call anyone. She didn’t say anything. She just let the change stand.

That afternoon, Eli boarded the wrong van for a field trip. When the chaperones reached the botanical gardens, they came up one short. They retraced every step, called his name until their voices cracked. But Eli was gone.

The police found his backpack three days later, tucked under a hedge near the perimeter fence. Zipper closed. Lunch untouched. No struggle. No footprints. No sign of him at all.

Just silence.

The school shut down its field trip program. Metal detectors were installed the next week—secondhand machines that buzzed even when touched gently. Classroom doors were fitted with new locks. Parent volunteers were fingerprinted. A dusk curfew followed.

In a closed-door meeting, someone on the city council finally said it out loud:

“Sabotage.”

Maria Vance stood outside Halston Elementary the next morning. The sky was gray, the cold sharp enough to sting. Parents didn’t make eye contact. Teachers moved like ghosts. Children whispered like everything was a secret.

Maria didn’t need the pins on her map anymore. She could feel the pattern in her bones.

This wasn’t chaos.

This was design.

And whoever was behind it… they were just getting started.

# Chapter 6: Graves and Whispers

Another funeral. Another headline. Another casket lowered into the frozen ground while a town full of trembling hands tried to convince themselves that prayer could hold back death. Halston draped itself in mourning again, but the grief rang hollow. They weren’t mourning Robert’s children. They were mourning their own safety, their own illusions.

Still, life in Halston ground on. The grocery stores stayed open. The school bell still rang. The church choir resumed, voices cracking on and off-key. Robert watched it all from the outside, a man staring through glass at a world he no longer belonged to. Their fear wasn’t enough. Their tears weren't enough. They had forgotten Emma and Samuel.

So he decided to make them remember.

He found the perfect place: a crumbling church tucked into a forgotten bend of road, its steeple sagging like a broken finger pointed skyward. Once a place of baptisms and vows, now it stank of mildew and mouse droppings. Still, there was something fitting about it. Robert prepared carefully. He built a crude cross out of rotting pew backs. He scavenged candles from a thrift store bin. He smuggled in a battered cassette deck, loaded with a single song—""Safe in His Arms,"" warped and warbling with age.

He thought about Emma humming along to hymns in the backseat, Samuel tapping his feet without knowing the words. He thought about the empty nursery and the promises he had failed to keep.

The boy he chose wasn’t special. Just small. Just alone. Harold Knox, the school bus driver, had been warned months before. A photo of his daughter tucked inside his glovebox. A note in red marker: ""He will suffer. Or she will."" Nails delivered in a plain manila envelope.

On a cold Thursday morning, the bus paused at Pine Creek stop. Fog licked the ground like low smoke. One child stepped off. The doors hissed shut behind him. Robert was waiting in the trees.

The boy didn’t scream. He didn’t run. He simply blinked up at the man reaching out to him. Inside the ruined church, Robert worked quickly but carefully. The child was lifted onto the wooden cross, his back pressed to the splintering wood. Nails were driven through soft palms and tender feet. Not savagely—but deliberately, with grim reverence. Each strike of the hammer echoed through the empty rafters like the tolling of a slow funeral bell.

""You'll see them soon,"" Robert whispered as he drove the final nail home. ""My little ones are waiting.""

He placed a paper crown on the boy’s brow. Smeared a rough ash cross over the child's small chest. Lit six candles at the base of the altar. Then he pressed play. The hymn trickled through the cold, rotten air, warbling and distant. Robert stood for a long moment, his eyes stinging, before he turned and walked away. He locked the doors behind him, leaving the boy crucified beneath the broken arches.

It was the boy’s mother who found him. She had followed the music, though no one else had heard it. She had forced the heavy doors open and fallen to her knees at the sight. The boy was alive. Barely. But something essential in him—something fragile and bright—had been extinguished forever.

Halston did not rally around this tragedy. There were no vigils. No bake sales. No Facebook groups offering casseroles and prayers. They shut their church doors. Canceled choir practice. Turned their faces away from their own shame.

Maria Vance stood outside the ruined church, the rain soaking through her coat, her hair plastered to her forehead. She didn’t light a cigarette. Didn’t open her notepad. She just stared through the doorway at the altar, at the boy nailed to the cross, at the candles sputtering against the wet wind.

This wasn’t revenge anymore. It wasn’t even grief. This was ritual.

That night, Maria tore everything off the walls of her office. Maps, photographs, reports—all of it came down. She started over with red string and thumbtacks, tracing each death, each disappearance, each shattered life. And when she stepped back, she saw it for what it was: a spiral.

Not random chaos. Not accidents. A wound closing in on itself.

At its center: silence. No fingerprints. No footprints. No smoking gun. Just grief. And grief was spreading like infection.

Parents pulled their children out of school. The Christmas pageant was canceled. The playgrounds sat under gathering drifts of snow, swings frozen mid-sway. Stores boarded their windows after dark. Halston was curling inward, shrinking, dying a little more each day.

And somewhere, Maria knew, the hand behind all of it was still moving.

She didn’t have proof. Not yet. But she could feel it in her bones.

This wasn’t over. Not even close.

Late that night, staring at her empty wall, Maria whispered to the darkness: ""I’m coming for you.""

And somewhere out in the dead heart of Halston, something whispered back.

# Chapter 7: The Spider’s Web

The sketchbook was found by accident, jammed between a stack of overdue returns at the Halston Public Library. A volunteer almost tossed it into the donation bin without looking. Curiosity saved it—and maybe saved lives.

At first glance, it looked like any child's notebook. Tattered corners. Smudges of dirt. But inside, Maria Vance saw what others might have missed. She flipped through the pages with gloved hands, her stomach tightening with every turn.

Children, sketched in trembling pencil lines, filled the pages. Their faces twisted in terror. Scenes of drowning, of falling, of burning playgrounds and broken swings. Some pages had dates scrawled in the margins—events that had already happened. Others bore dates that hadn’t yet arrived.

Mixed among the drawings were music notes, faint staves from hymns, each line annotated with uneven, obsessive care. On one page, three candles formed a triangle, familiar from the church scene. On another, a child's chest bore the ash cross Robert had smeared. It was all there—mapped in quiet, meticulous horror.

One line, scrawled over and over in the margins, stopped Maria cold: ""I don’t want them to suffer. I want them to remember. To feel it. To see them. Emma liked daisies. Samuel hated swings. They laughed on rainy days. Please. Remember.""

She pressed her hand to her mouth, her eyes stinging. This wasn’t just violence. This was love—twisted, broken love, weaponized into something unrecognizable.

At the bottom of many pages, a code repeated again and again: 19.73.14.8.21

It wasn’t a phone number. It wasn’t coordinates. It wasn’t a date. Maria stayed up all night breaking it down. Old habits from cold cases surfaced—simple alphanumeric cipher: A=1, B=2, and so on.

S.M.H.H.U.

Nonsense, until she cross-referenced abandoned businesses in Halston's property records.

Samuel’s Mobile Home Hardware Utility. A tiny repair shop that had shuttered years ago, its letters still ghosting across a sagging storefront.

The lease belonged to a man who had never made the papers until now: Robert Hayes.

No criminal record. No complaints. No outstanding bills. His name surfaced once, buried in an old laptop repair registration. The name Anna Hayes appeared alongside his. Deceased. Along with two children: Emma and Samuel. A car crash, two years prior.

Maria’s pulse pounded in her ears. She pulled the warrant herself. No backup. No news vans. Just her badge and a city-issued key.

The house at the end of Chestnut Lane looked abandoned. The windows were boarded. Weeds clawed their way up the front steps. But inside, the air smelled like grief had been embalmed into the walls.

She moved slowly, her footsteps muffled against the dust. The kitchen was stripped bare. The living room was hollowed out, the couch gone, the tables missing. Only the nursery remained untouched.

Two beds—one tiny racecar frame, one white-painted crib. Tiny shoes lined up neatly against the wall. Crayon drawings taped with careful hands: Emma holding a daisy. Samuel clutching a paper star.

Maria’s throat tightened. She knelt by the crib and saw it— A loose floorboard, cut precisely.

Underneath, she found a panel. And beneath the panel: photographs.

Hundreds of them.

Children on swings. Children walking home from school. A girl climbing the jungle gym. A boy waiting at a crosswalk. Her own niece, captured through the glass of a cafeteria window. Even herself—photographed at her office window, late at night, unaware.

On the back of her photo, in red marker, someone had scrawled: ""Even the strong lose their children.""

Maria staggered back, the room tilting. Robert hadn’t been lashing out blindly. He had been orchestrating this, piece by piece, grief by grief.

He had built a web.

And now she was standing at its center.

# Chapter 8: The Broken Father

They found him at an abandoned grain silo just outside Halston, a skeleton of rust and rotted beams forgotten by progress. The frost clung to the metal, and the morning mist wrapped around the place like a shroud.

Inside, twenty children sat in a wide circle, drowsy, confused, but alive. Their hands were zip-tied loosely in front of them—no bruises, no screaming. Only a heavy, drugged stillness. The air smelled of damp hay, gasoline, and old metal. Makeshift wiring coiled around the support beams, tangled like veins. Propane tanks sat beneath them, linked by a taut, quivering wire.

At the center stood Robert Hayes.

He was barefoot, his clothes coated in dust and ash, his hair hanging in ragged tufts over his eyes. In one hand, he clutched a worn photograph—Emma dressed in an orange pumpkin costume, Samuel wearing a ghost sheet too big for him, chocolate smeared across his chin. The picture was bent, the edges soft from being touched too often.

In his other hand: the detonator.

Maria Vance pushed past the barricades before anyone could stop her. She left her gun holstered. She left the shouting negotiators behind. She moved through the broken doorway into the silo’s yawning cold, stepping carefully as if entering a church.

Robert didn’t look at her at first. His thumb brushed across Samuel’s face in the photo, tender and trembling. When he finally raised his eyes, they were dark hollows rimmed with exhaustion—not anger. Not even madness.

Just grief.

""They laugh,"" Robert whispered, his voice rough, shredded from disuse. ""They still dance. They pretend it didn’t happen.""

Maria stopped a few feet away, close enough to see the scars time had carved into him, the way his shoulders sagged under invisible weights.

""They didn’t forget your children,"" she said softly. ""They forgot how to show it.""

Robert’s lip trembled. His grip on the photograph tightened.

""Emma loved the rain,"" he said, as if to himself. ""Samuel... he hummed when he drew. No one remembers that.""

""I do,"" Maria said.

The words cracked something inside him. His arms slackened. His body seemed to shrink. He looked down at the children—their heads drooping in the cold—and then, finally, he let the switch fall. It hit the dirt with a soft, hollow thud.

Robert Hayes sank to his knees, folding into himself like a man kneeling at an altar. The officers moved in then—slowly, carefully. No shouting. No violence. They cuffed him gently, almost reverently, as if recognizing they were not capturing a monster, but burying a broken father.

As they led him past Maria, he turned his head slightly. His voice, when it came, was low enough that only she could hear.

""I killed most of them,"" he said.

Not all. Most.

The word cut deeper than any weapon.

Robert hadn’t acted alone.

And Halston’s nightmare was far from over.

# Chapter 9: Broken Threads

Two weeks after Robert Hayes was locked behind steel bars, another child died.

A girl this time. Found floating face down in a retention pond behind Halston Middle School. Her sneakers were placed neatly beside her backpack, the zipper closed, her lunch still inside untouched. There were no signs of a struggle. No bruises. No cries for help. Just the stillness of the water swallowing another small life.

Maria Vance stood in the rain at the pond’s edge, her hands balled into fists in her coat pockets. She watched as divers hauled the girl’s body out under a gray, broken sky. Every instinct in her screamed against the easy explanation being whispered around her: accident. Tragedy. Bad luck.

But Maria knew better.

Robert Hayes was sealed away, his world reduced to a cell barely wide enough to stretch his arms. No visitors. No phone calls. No letters. And still—the dying continued.

Someone else was carrying the flame now.

She returned to her office late that night and faced the wall of photographs and maps. Not as a detective. Not even as a protector. As a mourner. Someone who had lost, and who understood the ache that demanded action, no matter the cost.

This wasn’t about Robert anymore. It was about everyone he had touched.

She didn’t trace the victims this time. She traced the helpers.

The janitor who had locked the wrong fire exit during the Christmas pageant. The administrator who had quietly reassigned field trip groups. The bus driver who had closed the doors before the last child could climb aboard.

Ordinary people. Invisible hands.

Maria started digging.

Brian Teller cracked first. She approached him without backup, without even her badge displayed. Just a quiet conversation at his kitchen table. She asked about the fire door. His fingers trembled around his coffee cup. She asked about the night of the pageant. He looked away.

Then she mentioned his son. The boy with asthma.

Brian broke like a rotted beam.

""They sent me a photo,"" he whispered. ""It showed a red circle around his chest... around his lungs.""

He thought it was a prank at first. A cruel joke. He hadn’t meant for anyone to get hurt. But Robert had known exactly where to cut.

Linda Moore came next. She was waiting in the empty school office when Maria arrived, staring blankly at the playground beyond the frosted windows.

""I didn’t want anyone to die,"" Linda said before Maria could even speak. ""They sent me a picture of my niece. Sleeping. In her bed. I just... I thought if I moved a name, it would be harmless.""

Harold Knox—the bus driver—took the longest. He didn’t speak at all when Maria placed the envelope on the table between them. The photos. The nails. The hymn sheet with the red slash across it.

His hands shook. His shoulders sagged.

""I thought it would end,"" he said finally. ""I thought if I did what they asked, it would be over.""

Maria said nothing. She didn’t need to. Because she understood something that terrified her.

Robert Hayes hadn’t needed to kill with his own hands.

He had taught grief how to move from person to person, like a contagion. He had taught fear how to whisper in the ears of desperate mothers, exhausted fathers, terrified guardians. He had taught ordinary people to become monsters in the name of love.

That night, Maria rebuilt her board one last time.

Not a network of victims. But of mourners. Of conspirators. Of grief-stricken souls trapped between guilt and survival.

She traced red string from each accomplice, not to Robert, but to the acts they committed—small acts, each just a hair’s breadth from excusable, from forgivable, until they weren’t.

At the center of the new web wasn’t a man anymore. It was a wound.

Robert Hayes had planted something that would not die with him. It had learned to spread.

It had learned to live.

And it was still growing.

# Chapter 10: Ashes in the Wind

Robert Hayes was gone—a hollow man locked away behind glass and concrete, his name recorded in a courthouse ledger no one cared to read twice. His trial was short, his sentencing swift. Life without parole. No outbursts. No apologies.

And yet, Halston didn’t recover.

The news cameras packed up and left. The vigil candles guttered and drowned in rain. The teddy bears and faded flowers piled at playground fences decayed beneath early snows. A few hollow speeches were made about resilience, about healing, about moving forward.

But fear had taken root deeper than grief ever could.

Children walked to school two by two, their hands clenched white-knuckled. Parents trailed behind them, glancing over their shoulders at every rustle of leaves, every parked car. Churches stayed half-empty, pews gathering dust. Christmas decorations blinked dimly behind barred windows. Laughter, when it came, sounded thin and brittle.

Maria Vance saw it everywhere. In the way playgrounds sat deserted even on sunny days. In the way neighbors no longer trusted each other with their children. In the way hope had been packed away with the last of the holiday lights, perhaps forever.

And still, the messages came.

No more crude threats. No more photographs. Just notes now—typed, anonymous, slipped under doors or taped to mailbox flags. Simple messages.

""We’re still here."" ""She still dreams of water, doesn’t she?"" ""You can’t save them all.""

Maria sat alone most evenings at Miller Park, sipping cold coffee as the swings moved listlessly in the wind. She watched a rusted carousel creak in slow, aching turns. She watched the ghost of what Halston used to be.

And she understood, bitterly, that Robert Hayes had won something no prison walls could take away. He had planted fear not in the hearts of individuals, but in the soil of the town itself. It bloomed every day, fed by memory and absence.

He had turned grief into a weapon. And he had taught others how to wield it.

Halston wore its fear like an old, threadbare coat now—something familiar and heavy and impossible to shed.

Maria kept working. She kept pulling at threads, reopening old files, retracing old paths. She chased shadows. She chased half-remembered names. She chased whispers of whispers, knowing most of it would never lead anywhere clean.

Because Robert hadn’t needed to give orders anymore.

He had shown them how.

How to wound without touching. How to kill without a sound. How to turn love itself into a noose.

Maria walked the town at night sometimes, past shuttered shops, past homes with blacked-out windows, past a burned tool shed someone had once set ablaze just because it “looked wrong.” Every porch light flickering behind a curtain. Every father standing a little too long at the window after putting his children to bed. Every mother who locked every door twice, even during the day.

This was the new Halston.

Not a place. A wound.

The final note came on a Tuesday morning. No envelope. Just a sheet of paper taped to Maria’s front door, the words typed carefully, the ink barely dry.

""You can’t save them all.""

Maria stood barefoot on the porch, the snow biting up through her skin, and stared at the note until the cold seeped into her bones. Then she struck a match, holding it to the paper until it curled black and drifted apart into the wind.

Ashes in the snow.

She watched the last of it vanish into the pale morning light.

And whispered to the empty, listening town:

""Maybe not. But I can damn well try.""",2,1746129582.0,creepypasta,1,1.0,False

**Overview:**

We started in Cagliari, rode up the east coast to the Gulf of Orosei, climbed inland into the mountains of Orgosolo and Nuoro, took a train south to Carbonia and ferry to Carloforte, then rode our bikes back to Cagliari. 

**(Rest) Day 1:**[**Bike shop to the hotel**](https://www.strava.com/routes/3213532057151121666) **+ exploring Cagliari (10 miles 100ft)**

After arriving the night before, we had a nice breakfast at the hotel before going to pick up our rental bikes at [Sardinia Cycles](https://www.sardiniacycling.com/en/), a quick 20 minute bus ride away in Quartu Sant'Elena. We brought along our kits and bits to install frame bags and carry the day's riding gear. From here we rode back to our hotel. We saw flamingos. There is an extensive network of bike path which seemed complicated to connect. We rode back to the hotel and spent the evening exploring Cagliari by foot. I got a [haircut](https://maps.app.goo.gl/MefqsCvvGW4FnFGSA). 

**Day 2:** [**Cagliari to San Priamo**](https://www.strava.com/routes/3209955529523681050) **(56 miles 3000ft)**

Our hotel had a garage to leave luggage and a courtyard to pack bikes in which we arranged access to with our host beforehand. It took about two hours to get out of the city and find ourselves on a quiet coastal road, high on the cliffs above the Mediterranean and looking southward towards Africa. We passed through a few lovely towns though admittedly did not stop when it was opportune and we found ourselves having not eaten lunch and needing a grocery store to purchase dinner during [“riposo”](https://europe.stripes.com/travel/riposo-in-italy.html#:~:text=Riposo%2C%20also%20known%20as%20pennichella,to%20escape%20the%20midday%20heat.). Our fault. After crawling down a brief section of *Gravèl* we arrived at our accommodations where we were kindly greeted by Mateo and the family. 

**Day 3:** [**San Priamo to Abatax**](https://www.strava.com/routes/3210012811941325726) **(65 miles 2600ft)**

All of our efforts have been validated. We are a day early for the [Murave Citrus Festival](https://www.muraverawelcome.com/en/50th-citrus-festival/) but stopped at a nice bakery where we had a cappuccino and got supplies for a picnic lunch. Despite these roads having a bit more traffic, SS125 became a favorite of ours. Between the quality of the pavement and [steady breeze](https://www.windy.com/41.185/9.327?40.716,9.327,8), we were happy to be on 30/32mm road bikes. The town of Jerzu looked stunning, but we didn’t have time to deviate and investigate. We explored Abatax in the evening and took ourselves out to a nice seafood dinner. 

**Day 4:** [**Abatax to Cala Gonone**](https://www.strava.com/routes/3210015019386435704) **(47miles 4200ft)**

Possibly the best day I’ve ever had on a bike. We stopped at a bakery for snacks and lunch, had a noteworthy [cappuccino](https://maps.app.goo.gl/72MjZPcqrsnVNiMW8) and fresh orange juice, then rode on past Tour d’Italia murals and cactus. The towns of Triei and Baunei were highlights of the trip. Baunei has one of the highest populations of centenarians in the world, it is a part of the [Blue Zone](https://www.bluezones.com/explorations/sardinia-italy/) here in Sardinia. The roads from Baunei to Cala Ganone were the best I have ever ridden. We shared this [epic descent](https://www.google.com/maps/@40.1601272,9.5088426,3a,75y,41.98h,63.57t/data=!3m7!1e1!3m5!1sqezhaLcGuMg8bMfBqJbxdQ!2e0!6shttps:%2F%2Fstreetviewpixels-pa.googleapis.com%2Fv1%2Fthumbnail%3Fcb_client%3Dmaps_sv.tactile%26w%3D900%26h%3D600%26pitch%3D26.430627070279066%26panoid%3DqezhaLcGuMg8bMfBqJbxdQ%26yaw%3D41.98399151712253!7i16384!8i8192?entry=ttu&g_ep=EgoyMDI1MDQwOS4wIKXMDSoASAFQAw%3D%3D) with sports car enthusiasts and 50 year old German men on street bikes wearing their silly suits. They are the reason the mountain top restaurants were open, and I was grateful for that.

Consider reserving one ahead, We got lucky and one was available. Upon arriving in Cala Gonone we walked to the marina and inquired about a boat rental. There were about 20 rental booths, but availability was limited as their season was just starting. They said they might have one available, tomorrow was better than the next day due to weather, and to show up at 9am ready to go. We did, and they gave us a god damn motorboat. Crazy.

This rugged region is part of the Blue Zone but features its own[ dark past](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orgosolo#:~:text=At%20one%20time%20Orgosolo%20was,sentence%20passed%20on%20their%20enemies.). Consider [watching this](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Banditi_a_Orgosolo) after you go. 

**Day 8.1:** [**Orgosolo to Nuoro**](https://www.strava.com/routes/3210004554076157854) **(13 miles 1500 ft)**

Early morning ride to catch the train in Nuoro. We got there early and had time to get food for the travel day at a bakery and an amazing breakfast at an [awesome cafe](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Bar+Centrale+Ristoro/@40.3203705,9.323974,53m/data=!3m1!1e3!4m6!3m5!1s0x12de8660147e77c5:0x65c6925f31a43e01!8m2!3d40.320228!4d9.3241639!16s%2Fg%2F11b6gg97tr?entry=ttu&g_ep=EgoyMDI1MDQwOS4wIKXMDSoASAFQAw%3D%3D).

This is also where you could extend the trip to include what is credited to be the most beautiful town in Sardinia, [Bosa](https://www.sardegnaturismo.it/en/most-beautiful-villages-italy-overlooking-sea-sardinia).

**8.2** [**Carbonia to Portoscuso**](https://www.strava.com/routes/3210000687757774750) **(12 miles 200ft) + Ferry to Carloforte**

Low quality industrial riding on bad busy roads :(. The Ferry was easy and fun though! 

**(Rest) Day 9:** [**Carloforte**](https://www.strava.com/routes/3209266717761891560) **(15 miles 1500ft)**

**Day 10: Ferry from Carloforte +** [**Calasetta to Chia**](https://www.strava.com/routes/3209264496030542670)

We took the ferry to Calassetta, which was a relaxing way to spend the morning. After a cappuccino, we explored quiet the island of Sant’Antioco. I wish I had more time here! The afternoon was an absolute slog to Chia consisting of windy, busy, and bad roads. There were still some [moments](https://www.google.com/maps/place/%C3%9A+Barach%C3%A9/@38.9484298,8.7200977,3a,75y,163.08h,75.76t/data=!3m7!1e1!3m5!1s5TUYN8r1IqTNRITPmFp36A!2e0!6shttps:%2F%2Fstreetviewpixels-pa.googleapis.com%2Fv1%2Fthumbnail%3Fcb_client%3Dmaps_sv.tactile%26w%3D900%26h%3D600%26pitch%3D14.243017260833511%26panoid%3D5TUYN8r1IqTNRITPmFp36A%26yaw%3D163.07956443474868!7i16384!8i8192!4m14!1m7!3m6!1s0x12e7b16649ae0b1f:0xa6da136304aed7fc!2zw5ogQmFyYWNow6k!8m2!3d39.1440905!4d8.306652!16s%2Fg%2F11flg0r4qw!3m5!1s0x12e7b16649ae0b1f:0xa6da136304aed7fc!8m2!3d39.1440905!4d8.306652!16s%2Fg%2F11flg0r4qw?entry=ttu&g_ep=EgoyMDI1MDQyOC4wIKXMDSoASAFQAw%3D%3D) of [bliss](https://www.google.com/maps/place/%C3%9A+Barach%C3%A9/@38.9223037,8.7527531,3a,75y,234.28h,83.75t/data=!3m7!1e1!3m5!1sb-nMEkM8V7rkJo59Y2UwZg!2e0!6shttps:%2F%2Fstreetviewpixels-pa.googleapis.com%2Fv1%2Fthumbnail%3Fcb_client%3Dmaps_sv.tactile%26w%3D900%26h%3D600%26pitch%3D6.254777721942929%26panoid%3Db-nMEkM8V7rkJo59Y2UwZg%26yaw%3D234.28105712167508!7i16384!8i8192!4m14!1m7!3m6!1s0x12e7b16649ae0b1f:0xa6da136304aed7fc!2zw5ogQmFyYWNow6k!8m2!3d39.1440905!4d8.306652!16s%2Fg%2F11flg0r4qw!3m5!1s0x12e7b16649ae0b1f:0xa6da136304aed7fc!8m2!3d39.1440905!4d8.306652!16s%2Fg%2F11flg0r4qw?entry=ttu&g_ep=EgoyMDI1MDQyOC4wIKXMDSoASAFQAw%3D%3D). Chia is a tourist trap. 

**Day 11:** [**Chia to Assemini**](https://www.strava.com/routes/3209261246898927438)**/Cagliari  (53 miles 1500ft) + Train to Cagliari**

Our host informed us that there was a “[manifestation](https://www.sardegnaturismo.it/en/saint-ephysius-festival-sardinia)” in town. This was a highlight of the trip and we were grateful to see it, but the afternoon made us question if it was worth it. Pula to “Cagliari” was an absolute nightmare. We quickly altered our plans to catch a train from Assemini to Cagliari. **We later learned that tour companies will shuttle this section between Pula and Cagliari because it is AWFUL and terrifying with no good way around it**.

After arriving in Cagliari via train, we hustled to the bike show to return our noble steeds with just seconds to spare. We celebrated with some electrolytes in the [bike shops cafe](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Maglia+Nera+Cafe/@39.2403195,9.1870469,3a,75y,298.08h,95.16t/data=!3m7!1e1!3m5!1sIowUW8ym1jVFlt8o3GQ7ug!2e0!6shttps:%2F%2Fstreetviewpixels-pa.googleapis.com%2Fv1%2Fthumbnail%3Fcb_client%3Dmaps_sv.tactile%26w%3D900%26h%3D600%26pitch%3D-5.1609839528927495%26panoid%3DIowUW8ym1jVFlt8o3GQ7ug%26yaw%3D298.0765081544895!7i16384!8i8192!4m6!3m5!1s0x12e7352a90ae9415:0x8af7dca20324121e!8m2!3d39.2403666!4d9.1869973!16s%2Fg%2F11rtxfns11?entry=ttu&g_ep=EgoyMDI1MDQyOC4wIKXMDSoASAFQAw%3D%3D), then bused back to our our hotel. 

In the evening we celebrated with more electrolytes at an [absolutely packed locals bar](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Caffetteria+Tiffany/@39.216696,9.112576,51a,33.1y/data=!3m8!1e2!3m6!1sCIHM0ogKEICAgIDcpdKbDQ!2e10!3e12!6shttps:%2F%2Flh3.googleusercontent.com%2Fgps-cs-s%2FAC9h4no8vQ3zjGrxEhGE5JN6GjLxFjj_0cqZ981ldMfkOW2lnIyTdcPRrW7MjrCaB1arkcMv1AdphN6fFXEv7-tg3nxv1lqk1WOAokAgA8u_fVR1WVclk3NhW8fpLTN8tf8R9Q72inI%3Dw152-h86-k-no!7i4128!8i2322!4m10!1m2!2m1!1sRestaurants!3m6!1s0x12e73408b9d8e15d:0xd4002ff3142c6ab8!8m2!3d39.2166613!4d9.1136336!10e5!16s%2Fg%2F11bw3dkplv?entry=ttu&g_ep=EgoyMDI1MDQyOC4wIKXMDSoASAFQAw%3D%3D), returned to the best gelateria, and reflected on the la dolce vita. 

**Bikes:**

[Sardinia Cycling](https://www.sardiniacycling.com/en/) was amazing to work with. It was easy to sort out the bikes and ask questions via email and whatsapp. We wanted to rent gravel bikes, but there was an [event](https://www.sardiniacycling.com/en/biking-tours/epic-sardinia-gravel-edition.html) going on so there was none available. In the end we absolutely loved our Canyon Endurace CF 8 (30/32mm) road bikes and were glad we ended up with skinnier tires due to the smooth and quiet roads. 

**Distance:**

We are generally (very?) fit people who measure success in coffees and croissants rather than distance and elevation gain. Regardless of the distance, it took us all day, every single day. I actively tried to decrease mileages while planning this, despite an overwhelming desire to see everything. You can always add on mileage during a day, it’s hard to reduce it if you need to be somewhere. I included multiple layover days so that if we got delayed for any reason, we wouldn’t fall behind on our entire trip. I did this in Cagliari, Cala Gonone, and Carloforte. 

**Cagliari:**

We gave ourselves a full day in Cagliari incase of travel delay and to pick up and prepare our bikes. Between this full day and the final evening before departing, we did not feel the need to spend more time in Cagliari. This is where we decided the best flavor of gelato was [al basilico e lime](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Kremet+Gelateria/@39.2177202,9.1137845,59m/data=!3m2!1e3!5s0x12e7340f35ef30e7:0xa5780d33392b0ac0!4m6!3m5!1s0x12e735b845541205:0x20f0ee09f1ae401f!8m2!3d39.2177025!4d9.1138904!16s%2Fg%2F11gk08w9qg?entry=ttu&g_ep=EgoyMDI1MDQwOS4wIKXMDSoASAFQAw%3D%3D). On our final night we celebrated with an [Aperol Spritz](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Caffetteria+Tiffany/@39.216696,9.1134891,3a,75y,90t/data=!3m8!1e2!3m6!1sCIHM0ogKEICAgIDcpdKbDQ!2e10!3e12!6shttps:%2F%2Flh3.googleusercontent.com%2Fgps-cs-s%2FAB5caB87b2E8aEIwELD_Q-eSTXYlG7I7u8Wxvj1B-snijmzpdTn-R-pLuLq9-kw-Wrl1cgTzyfCd8cbMKLXLz8PamPrvALmKpkuylWJg-jGMRy9KcbkoVPrcH7oIzZ9NFLUsqg_SsBU%3Dw152-h86-k-no!7i4128!8i2322!4m13!1m5!3m4!2zMznCsDEyJzI1LjciTiA5wrAwNyczMC4wIkU!8m2!3d39.20713!4d9.125!3m6!1s0x12e73408b9d8e15d:0xd4002ff3142c6ab8!8m2!3d39.2166613!4d9.1136336!10e5!16s%2Fg%2F11bw3dkplv?entry=ttu&g_ep=EgoyMDI1MDQwOS4wIKXMDSoASAFQAw%3D%3D).

**Cala Gonone:**

The resort town of Cala Ganone was an obvious place to spend multiple days and we treated ourselves to a nice hotel. There was a very large population of rock climbers here as well. Did I mention renting a boat?

**Carloforte, Calasetta and Sant'Antonio:**

The riding getting to these islands was industrial with truck traffic and bad pavement. The Ferry was a very fun experience and easy to do. Carloforte is a vibrant and intimate port city, we loved it here despite the biking being not nearly as good. We had the [best dinner](https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g644261-d17810785-Reviews-U_Barache-Carloforte_Province_of_Carbonia_Iglesias_Sardinia.html), the [best croissant](https://www.google.com/maps/place/D%C3%A2+darsen%C3%A9tta/@39.1431303,8.3056184,21z/data=!4m6!3m5!1s0x12e7b1f94dcba225:0x2c3b38921a12ecd6!8m2!3d39.1431729!4d8.3057921!16s%2Fg%2F11tcgrw2vl?entry=ttu&g_ep=EgoyMDI1MDQwOS4wIKXMDSoASAFQAw%3D%3D), and the only eggnog gelato of the trip. 

Calasetta was a strange resort town. We changed plans to focus our time in Carloforte and were happy we did, though the riding was beautiful on this island and Sant’Antonio was worth of more of our time. 

**Chia: Hard pass.** 

**Time of year:**

We went from 4/20-5/5. We planned this trip just before the tourist season for better biking temperatures, cheaper prices and quieter roads. It was kinda cold and snowed on the tallest peak while we were there. We only swam once. 

The crazy Italian and vacationing German drivers were very considerate, once they saw you. Bring lights and backup lights. Generally speaking, the roads felt safe. I attribute much of this to the time of year being before the tourist season had started in earnest.

**Water:**

Is there water? Yes. We carried two bottles each and normally got away with 1. The cooler temps helped with this. We also recommend cappuccino and [Sardinian electrolytes](https://www.lasardegna1930.it/lasardegna/en/beer/1756-birra-ichnusa-al-limone-tipica-sarda.html) consumed together at the same time.

**Cost:**

All in, we spent $3000 each, including flights and bike rentals. Without those, the cost once we got to the island was closer to $1200 each, or $100 a day. We did not hold back, but also had zero space in our bike bags to purchase any souvenirs which would have added significant expenses. 

**Language:** Sardinia’s economy is driven heavily by tourism, everyone spoke English. 

**What else?**

I learned that [sparking water was naturally occurring](https://www.smeraldinawater.com/). 

The island has many pump tracks and I rode one almost every day.

Consider giving yourself more time in Cala Gonone so you can be flexible based on the weather. This might be critical for [renting a boat](https://www.google.com/maps/search/boat+rental+cala+gonone/@40.283387,9.6379451,20z?entry=ttu&g_ep=EgoyMDI1MDQwOS4wIKXMDSoASAFQAw%3D%3D). Did I mention the boat rental?

It is [windy](https://www.thetimes.com/world/europe/article/sardinia-blows-up-over-invasion-of-wind-farms-j290z6255). Other bikers have described a show stopping heading when trying to ride north along the island's west coast. The winds on the more sheltered east coast were significant. We were grateful to be on decently árëō setups with bags rather than panniers. 

The trains are a great bike friendly resource and immune to wind.

# 🧘‍♀️ My Friend Sophie's Experience Using Pineal Guardian

A few months back, I reconnected with my old yoga buddy, Sophie L., who’s been on quite the wellness journey lately.

Between daily meditation, herbal cleanses, and endless reading about the **benefits of pineal gland activation**, Sophie had become a bit of a pineal gland guru in her own right.

When she heard I was looking into [Pineal Guardian](https://theworldhealth.org/pineal-guardian-official) **reviews**, she lit up like a light bulb.  
Turns out, she’d already been using it for about six weeks.

Sophie told me she noticed a subtle but powerful shift after the first month.

Her meditation sessions felt deeper, she remembered her dreams more vividly, and—this was the big one—she woke up feeling refreshed instead of dragging herself to the coffee pot like a half-asleep zombie.

She did mention one small quirk: the taste was a little too ""wild-harvested salad"" for her liking when she took it straight. Now she drops it into a berry smoothie every morning and barely notices it.

For someone like Sophie, who’s been exploring **natural remedies for brain fog** without wanting a medicine cabinet full of pills, Pineal Guardian felt like the right fit—supportive, simple, and genuinely aligned with her holistic approach.

With only a few **natural ways to clean** the **pineal gland**, you don't want anything extreme—just patience and consistency.

# ⚠️ Potential Drawbacks of Pineal Guardian

The taste can be earthy, especially when taken neat, although tea or smoothies help mask it well.

Some users may find the results so gradual they initially question if anything's happening. This supplement is a marathon, not a sprint.

Finally, price-conscious buyers may hesitate, though the cost could suggest it's one of the **best supplements for pineal gland detox** ... quality doesn't come cheap.

    I noticed that Ginseng raises Serotonin levels and too high can be dangerous and can cause serotonin syndrome. 
      I try to avoid the drinks altogether but if do I look for the lowest caffeine and “energy blend”  which confuses me why a company puts so much over a daily dose if our bodies supposedly gets ride of like B,D and other stuff that actually can lead to toxic levels…from my experience with a relative getting blood work done . 
      I’m trying not to just ramble here but finding other drinks maybe green tea’s or something that are a recommendation? I can’t do coffee anymore unless cold and sugar’d and creamed perfectly old school like.
      Is there a recommendation on something that works similar to LEXIPRO that i don’t need to watch everything that may react with it?

# Training

I’ve spent the last 3 years getting back into consistent training. In Fall 2022, I ran a 1:38 half marathon after a summer of training, and have progressed a decent amount in both speed and volume. Fast-forward to 2024, I set my sights on a sub 1:25 half marathon in October– and as a side-quest paced my partner for a 3:37 marathon in November. My marathons were 3:58 (2014), 3:47 (2016), 3:37 (2024). In the half, I ended up with 1:24 in October and a 1:25 in November (2 weeks after our full).

With a sub 1:25 in the books, and the 3:37 feeling relatively relaxed, I set my sights on a sub 3 goal. I’m an MD/PhD student that defended in January, and I figured getting back into clinicals might preclude me from consistent training needed to achieve that running goal, so I really wanted to try. I aimed for the Carmel Marathon April 19th.

HOWEVER…life got in the way a little. Though I had a great aerobic base in November, December was nuts in terms of my work life. I had a lot of writing/coding/stress getting my PhD work wrapped up, and lost a lot of consistency (and sleep/energy). BUT, after I defended in January, I was able to get back into it a bit. I revised my goal, setting my sights on Sub 3:10. I had really wanted to get up to 55-60 mpw regularly by Jan, but instead essentially had a reset and needed to start a new build. I was regularly averaging 35-40 mpw (aside from 1-2 weeks here and there for conferences/travel), with 2-3 weeks over 45 miles. I peaked at about 47 miles. My longest run was 21 miles (first 10 easy, second half at or below goal pace). I did a 19 miler before that, and 18, 16, 12 after. I would have loved to do another 1-2 20+ mile runs, but I just couldn’t fit it in. I also needed to move back to the city my med school is in the first week of April, so I genuinely did my best to get miles in…but it was a real balance of fatigue/fitness. I also proposed to my fiancee in late feb/early march (!!) which was another big life milestone.

The 21, 18, and 16 mile runs were the best long runs I’ve ever had, so I felt optimistic about a sub 3:10. For the 18, I worked in 2x 2 mi at 5-15s below marathon pace (after mile 13) and for the 16, I did a half marathon at 7:10 pace in the middle of it and it felt so damn relaxed. Generally, I aimed for mostly easy miles during the week with 1-2 track sessions or tempos. My mileage went 46, 44, 31, 31, 10 up to April 19th. But then….

Race Cancelled!!! Weather was pretty bad and Carmel decided to cancel. The right call, I think. But it was a bit disappointing. The afternoon wasn’t too bad weather-wise, so I got in a 13.1 mile run with 3x 2 at marathon pace or faster worked into that run. Medical school was starting back up that week so I needed to pivot within the week if I was still going to race somewhere– Louisville and Fort Wayne were the closest options. I chose Fort Wayne because temps were predicted to be a little cooler, and it was a bit cheaper/easier logistically. I essentially extended my taper but got another good workout (4x 5:00 at 6:50 pace) early in the week to keep the legs fresh because I was feeling a bit sluggish after the carb-loading/rest the week before.

# Pre-race

Packet pickup was pretty smooth the day before. Got into Fort Wayne that afternoon, temps/weather seemed pretty ideal. Went to Salvatori’s, got a nice baked ziti and fettuccine + breadsticks. A+ for large portion sizes and decent food. Drove a few parts of the course after dinner to get a sense of the layout and where we’d be running. Looking at the course map, I knew it’d be a lot of out and backs, with most of the race on paved trail. Didn’t look to be quite as flat as Carmel, but definitely not as hilly as the Pittsburgh marathon I’d run years prior.

Was hard to sleep with the excitement and nerves, but got some decent shut-eye. Downed my usual half-coffee + bagel/jam + a few gummies before we left the hotel in the AM.

# Race

Weather was spectacular. Nice and cool, 40-45 F at the start, a decent sunrise. This being a very small race (<250 runners in total, split between half and full marathon), there wasn’t a whole lot of fanfare at the start. To be honest, it felt smaller than most local 5ks I’ve run in my life.

The race experience was overall OK. The course was pretty scenic/nature-y, running through downtown Fort Wayne, along the river, into some nice parks/trails. It was more interesting than I think it would have been running in Carmel.

However…it was quite poorly marked in my opinion. I was running in a pack of 3-4 runners and we constantly questioned whether we were on course, since we kept losing sight of runners ahead of us. Some turns were just not clear enough and required too much thought/prior course knowledge for my comfort. It’s really tough to try and remember where to turn when you’re trying to save any mental energy you can for pulling through the last few miles. With small races, obviously you don’t have as many people cheering, so it did require a bit more mental fortitude and camaraderie with my fellow pack of runners (including my fiancee running the half). The aid stations were about 50% people handing out water/gatorade and 50% where you had to grab a cup/gel off the table…which required a little more dexterity than I thought. We were rocking that first half though, right at 7:14-15 pace, getting my fiancee to the half marathon finish in \~1:34-35.

The turn-off for the full marathon was not very clear. We thought we needed to go straight, but we actually needed to turn into a fenced lot, and go pretty much all the way to the finish line, doing a hairpin turn before exiting the lot. It was confusing. And we didn’t find out until we had run about .1 miles the wrong direction, and had to turn and go back. We were a bit pissed about that, since we even clarified with course support and only found out when we DOUBLE CHECKED with people on the other side of the fence.

Anyway, after complaining about it for a mile, the pack I was with focused in and kept cruising. We worked together up until about mile 17 or so and then started to split up. I started slipping on the pace with some fatigue setting in around mile 20 so dialed it back hoping to keep it steady for the last 10k. Managed to get to \~22 miles before I started feeling my quads start to cramp up…23-26.2 were a bit of run/walking/hobbling. My legs were just locking up anytime I slowed down and my muscles were too fatigued to really do much…so it was a battle. Started to see my chances of a 3:15, 20, 25 start slipping as I got passed by several runners throughout that final 5k.

Not my day…but we got through it. Didn’t really hit the main goals, and I feel like it wasn’t a great reflection of my true potential/fitness but still ended up with a \~7ish min PR.

# Post-race

After I crossed the line, I realized my watch was still a bit short so got in the extra .04ish miles to round it out. Not sure if the course was a tad short…since a lot of runners were in a similar boat. Seemed like I wasn’t alone in feeling like it was a bit of a hard one to navigate/be sure of the directions. Ended up 19/109, 3/10 in my age category (M 30-34). Smallest medal I’ve gotten for completing a marathon (same medal for half and full), but also the smallest race! Went to the hotel, cleaned up, grabbed a burger and shake at Culver’s before hitting the road.

# Reflections/Seeking Advice/Feedback

I think, despite some issues with the course, less support than I’ve had at larger races, it was really the lack of training volume that killed me in the end. The weather was pretty perfect, the course was generally pretty fun. But I think to tackle those last few miles with speed and not burn my muscles, I just need more volume next time. My half marathon fitness would predict me to be a bit faster, and my long runs were the most solid they’d ever been…but I just couldn’t make enough time for the volume I probably needed, right? Race cancellations suck…but I’m not even sure I would have done much better the weekend before?

Anyway…I could use any thoughts/insights y’all may have and I’m happy to discuss my training in more detail. I think (thanks to my schedule getting a bit busier soon) it’ll be a year or two before I can attempt the marathon again– but I’m hoping I have a solid few half marathons in the near future.

In the end…at least I got out and ran. When I remind myself I almost bailed completely after the cancellation but still got out and did the miles, I feel a little better about myself? Still, a bit disappointed though. Was hoping to push through a time I was happy with before disappearing into my medical training for a bit.

Finally, would I recommend the Fort Wayne Marathon? I think, given my experience, I’d probably look for a bigger race if you’re training diligently and would be put off by some of the things I mentioned. It takes a lot of logistical management and volunteers to host a marathon, and this course has lots of potential. The organizers clearly worked very hard and are doing their best. It could be improved drastically with a few less out/backs and better directions/signage/support. But, as a last-minute race or an opportunity to just get the distance in, it definitely served its purpose. I just wish I could have done a little better!

Happy to chat more with anyone planning to run this race…I couldn’t find much information/review of the course at the time I signed up!

You could call me an average sort of person. I’m by no means a model, but confident enough to be a step or two outside of ugly. Someone who didn’t quite grow out of their adolescent awkwardness, but I happily embrace it. Not the most social butterfly, but also not a shut in or hermit, watching the world pass by behind a pane of glass. 

I grew up in a small town, taking a job in an office. I kept to myself, but slowly inched my way up a ladder. When I was offered a management position in a larger town some miles away, I said screw it and took it. Similar mind numbing work behind a keyboard and screen, but I’d have my own office and an entire floor would be underneath my watchful gaze. 

It was an easy decision. My parents had both passed away and I had no other family or siblings, no loved ones, no one to keep me tethered there. It really came down to breaking out of my comfortable shell. Something told me to go, and I swung and cracked though. Packed up my scant belongings, my simple life, and was soon in a larger town, but not quite the bustling city most of my generation prefer. I set up shop and gingerly settled into my new role.

I wouldn’t call myself a hard ass boss my any means. My people preformed exceptionally well, and I allowed them to do so. I wasn’t one to crack the whip, but if I had to talk to someone, I did. I could see the entire floor from within my glass cage and, in turn, they could see me, could see I was always just as busy as they were. Hopefully it was respect. There was always that small part that gnawed at me though. Whenever I would peak over my monitor to see someone hunched near a coworker: were they talking about me? How awful a bass I really was? Higher ups never chewed me out, but I also never received accolades. Was I doing enough?

I never socialized with them outside of the office, but I could tell you all their names, their hobbies. That didn’t matter though, I was content with my humble, simple life. My average life. Maybe that was the problem…

The first time I saw them, I was on my way back to my office, a freshly filled mug in my hand. Heading down the central aisle between desks, I took a sip and glanced towards my office. I stopped dead in my tracks, spitting coffee back into the mug. Someone was sitting at my desk, head down. All I could see was the top of his head peeking over the monitor. I didn’t remember corporate saying anyone was visiting. There was something so familiar about that dark brown hair, like I had met this person before. 

A voice broke my gaze from the glass walls. Giselle Swenson looked up at me, a Flickr of concern in her green eyes. She enjoyed spending her weekends hiking around the nearby trails.

“You okay, boss?”

I smiled at her, clenching the handle of the mug so I didn’t spill the steaming coffee. Was she blushing? 

“Oh yes, I’m fine, Giselle,” I lied. “ Just remembering an email I forgot to send.”

“Uh oh,” she feigned fear, raising a hand to lightly brush my arm. “ Don’t wanna peeve off the hierarchy. “

Did her blush deepen? I’d never considered any sort of relationship with any of my employees. I honestly preferred the life of solitude.

“ Definitely,” I retorted with a forced chuckle.

“Better get back at it then, big man.”

Big man? Giselle had already returned to her work. Her black nails clicking across her keyboard. My gaze shot back to my office…my empty office. I sat down, rubbing my eyes, then looked out at the floor. Nothing seemed out of the ordinary. No one out of place like they had dashed from my office during my short interaction. 
Maybe it had been a trick of the light. Was I losing it?

 Maybe things were taking a toll on me and I refused to admit it. I tried to shrug it off, but it kept me on edge the rest of the day. Maybe that would have been the end of it, but that was not the last time.

It was some time later, days had passed,, bordering on months. I had forgotten about the incident, going about my life as normal. This time I knew it was not a trick of the light, and it shook me to my core.

I lived in a nice one bedroom apartment not far from the office. I walked to work, it was so close. I used the time to separate myself from the office, and to people watch along the way. Most didn’t notice, some gave me a questioning glare. The occasional smile or furtive glance, even a nod or wave every once in awhile, which I would cordially return. I kept to myself, but wasn’t rude about it. I had no desire to learn more about these people, but they had done nothing to irk me. 

I had left the office long after everyone else, staying late to wrap up some weekly items before the weekend. I grabbed my bag and the dark red sweatshirt, it had been a chilly few days. It was my favorite color, and quite the comfortable Hoodia, one I had had since before my move here. I could easily get something else, perhaps more professional, but it was just so damned comfortable and fit perfectly. 

Leaving the lobby I immediately turned left to begin my usual route home. The street was bustling, but not nearly as busy as it would have been around quitting time. A crisp wind brushed my face as I looked up and down the street, eyes darting to and from. The grey sedan whizzing past, stirring up a warmer, chemically tainted breeze. The elderly gentleman across the street walking a rather pudgy beagle. The rather attractive female bending over down the road to retrieve her dropped phone. The sights, the sounds, the smells, it allowed me to let my mind wander to the upcoming weekend. A couple days I would probably spend at home with a good book.

“On your left!”

The words broke my spell. I scooted right as a man my own age jogged by. A fit specimen and I couldn’t help but let my eyes linger to the shorts that hugged his exquisite buttocks. Perhaps a little too long, but I was entranced until those chiseled cheeks turned a corner.

My gaze returned forward, and that’s when I saw them. 

They stood at the corner up ahead, probably waiting to cross. The same corner I would cross to get to my apartment. Someone in a dark red Hoodia, very similar to my own, but with the hood pulled up over their head. The same bag as mine draped across a shoulder, hanging at their hip. My hand instinctively went to my own, absently stroking the dark canvas. They were shorter than me, but something seemed off about their stance, but I just couldn’t quite place what. 

I was about to shrug it off as the most bizarre consequence. I mean, I took this same route twice a day, daily, for several years and had never seen such a similar get up as mine. Then their head turned and my knees nearly gave out. Time itself seemed to slow down. My own face was underneath that hood. My own face! My own face, yet not quite me face. If he caught a look at me, he didn’t how it. He simply looked both ways then leisurely crossed the road. 

I was transfixed. Locked in place. The world around me failing to properly exist. I could only watch disbelieving, as I walked away from myself. It felt absurd to think like that, but that was all my shocked brain could muster at the time. He moved onto the opposite corner and I lost track of him in a group of people. My eyes darted, struggling to find the dark red Hoodia, but in the waning daylight, it proved unfruitful. He-me?- was gone. The world slowly came back into focus.

Streetlights springing to life. The scent of the nearby steakhouse wafting on the chilly wind. An annoyed grumble parting the fog.

“Sightsee somewhere else, buddy.”

I don’t remember making it home, but somehow I did. Hastily locking the door, shrugging off my bag and letting it fall to the floor. Tearing my hoodie off. I stood there silently, just staring at the sweatshirt in my hands. I threw it across the dark room, letting it disappear into the shadows before shuffling and falling into my couch. I rubbed my eyes, massaging my temples, struggling to calm my racing heart. 

The incident from just over a month ago came rushing back. I had just glimpsed the top of a head then, but I vaguely 4emembered something familiar about it. Had I seen that same person that day too? So many questions rushed into my head.  Did I have a twin brother my parents had never told me about? If so, why? Was work harder on me than I was admitting to myself and I was losing my mind? 

The walls I had built around my simple little life were cracking. I could feel a dull throbbing starting in the back of my head. It was only a matter of time before it crept forward. I needed to get some rest. Maybe that was all I really needed, but I knew it would not come easily. Not without outside help. I would have loved to just knock myself out with a frying pan like some cartoon character, hopefully forget about all this. 8 also knew that that was not practical. I was shaken up and not thinking clearly. I would need some help of the medicinal or alcoholic variety, probably a mixture of both.

I dreamed that night. With the events of the evening and the medicinal cocktail to knock me out, I wasn’t surprised. I remember it so clearly, unlike most of the dreams I have.
I was walking along a worn path, gnarled trees lining each side. Beyond them all I could see was a bluish-gray fog. It was dead silent, almost oppressive. I walked along the path. Nothing seemed to change. The trees were mirrors of each other, stretching along both sides of the path. I just kept walking. Eventually I noticed a blurry form taking shape further up the path. I was unsettled but kept moving. I could faintly make out a rectangular shape. Was it the door out of this place? I started moving faster in hopes it was, but still shooting glances all around, keeping an eye on my ominous surroundings.

No it wasn’t a door. I stopped. A form was moving towards me within the rectangular frame. It moved when I moved, paused when I paused. I raised my hand and waved, the form followed suit. A mirror? I moved forward to stand before the mirror. This close it was far taller than me, but there my reflection stood, staring back at me in bewilderment. 

Yet it wasn’t quite me. Its proportions were off, barely noticeable from afar, but this close it was clear. It was me, but not me. It raised its hands and pressed them against the glass. It stared at me with soulless eyes as a smile grew on its face, stretching into a menacing rictus.

“Wake up,” I whispered to myself, scared to take my gaze off the reflection but desperately not wanting to look upon it.

 Its hands emerged from with the frame. I struggled to turn and run, to move at all, but I was paralyzed, frozen to the spot. The hands grabbed my shoulders, digging in and pulled me towards the mirror, slowly, agonizingly so, pulling me towards it. I could only look on in fear as I was pulled past the frame of the mirror, closer to the me that wasn’t me…

I awoke with a gasp. I was standing in front of my closet doors, which were a pair of full length sliding mirrors. I screamed quietly at my own reflection and fell back into the bed behind me.

 Struggling to calm my racing heart. How did I get up to stand in my sleep? What kind of messed up dream was that? I was clearly losing it. The clock said it was just after three in the morning. I sighed knowing sleep would elude me tonight. 

I spent the rest of the night and the day puttering around the apartment. Did the man I saw the previous evening cause the bizarre nightmare? Did I even get a clear enough look at his face to be certain he looked so damned similar? The sweatshirt and bag were identical. Sure it had been waning light, but I knew what I had seen. The previous vision from my office nearly a month ago reiterating that. Was it possible I had a twin brother no one had ever told me about? My parents and I had been close and surely they wouldn’t have kept that from me.. there were scant family members I could reach out to. Both of my parents had come from very small families. I tried to think of anyone I could ask and if I should even reach out with such a ridiculous question. 

I spent the day trying to occupy myself with menial tasks around my apartment, but nothing could distract me from everything that had occurred within the last 24 hours. Sure it had all started with that quick glimpse in the office, or had it? What if there had been other times this individual had been right beside me on the street, or standing in line behind me at the store, but I had missed it? That thought brought a slight chill down my spine. I thought about going down to the small park behind my building to get some fresh air, but what if I saw him sitting at a bench across the park? The thought of looking out the window, seeing him sitting at a park bench shook me to my core, causing me to stay away from my windows altogether. 

The TV played in the background, but I had no idea what was playing, nor did I care. It was more a distraction from the silence that would cause my mind to wander some dark corridors.
Some way, somehow the day passed. Before I knew it, the sun was setting. A mixture of stressed out exhaustion and copious amounts of medication and alcohol found me drifting into a somewhat fitful sleep. Thankfully there was no nightmares this go, but I was jarred awake just after one in the morning.

The apartment was silent, but a glow was coming from the living room. Had I left the television on? I was sure I had turned it off and I was certain I would not have muted it.

“Hello?” I called, immediately feeling foolish. If I was being robbed, I just alerted them.

There was just silence and the flickering glow from what was clearly the television. I must have left it on. 

I groggy got out of bed and ambled into the living room. I got a few steps in before looking up and stopping dead in my tracks. Silhouetted against the light from the television was a form sitting on the couch. Even in the dim light, I knew who it was.

“How the fuck did you get in here!?” I demanded, all traces of my sleep flushing 8tselfmout of my system.

No response. He just kept watching the screen.

“Hey!” I shouted, stepping closer. “you’ve got the wrong place!”

Nothing, not even a flinch. I took another step closer, resting my hands on the back of the couch. That’s when he glanced over his shoulder and bolted to his feet. Standing there in nothing but a pair of boxer briefs, even in the fluctuating light of the television, there was no doubt this man was my twin. He stood there, arms outstretched, eyes agape. His mouth was moving frantically, but no sound was coming out. He looked like he was shouting, but I heard nothing.

“Who are you?”

He was clearly as taken aback as I was, waving his arms in front of him as if was trying to ward off an attacker. He glanced towards the front door, then to the bedroom, as if trying to discern which was the best bet to get away from me.

“who are you!?” I said again, 4aising my voice. “How did you get in here?”

I stepped toward him and he made his choice, taking off for the bedroom. I grabbed the sides of my head. What the fuck was going on here? Was I dreaming again? Should I follow him? There was no way out from there, but what if had a weapon and was lying in wait in the darkness? Clearly I had startled him. Maybe he was some junkie who had forced his way in, but that didn’t explain the unbelievable resemblance to me. Maybe I should’ve just called the police and let them handle him, but I needed answers.

I moved towards the bedroom, flicking the switch near the door, hoping to catch him off guard. The room was bathed in a soft yellow glow, but was empty. My eyes went to the closed closet, the only place he could have hid. I hadn’t heard the doors slide open or closed, but in the heat of the moment it was possible it was missed. 

“I know you’re in the closet. If you come out, get dressed, and leave I want call the cops.”

Nothing.

I grabbed a book off my nightstand, the closest thing I had to a weapon. The plan was to tear open the door, hitting him with the book, hopefully stunning him enough to get control. I stared at my reflection raising the book and pushed the door open. Shouting, tossing the book while swinging my arm amongst the hanging shirts and pants, trying to cause a commotion to disorient him. He made no response to the flurry, and I soon realized the closer was devoid of anything living. Confused, I thoroughly checked every inch of the closet before giving up.

Where had he gone? I know he hadn’t gone into the bathroom and the bedroom window was closed, the curtains undisturbed. Besides which, he would have to be absolutely insane to jump out of a seventh floor window with no balcony. I rubbed the back of my throbbing head. Maybe I was losing it. Maybe it was time for a vacation from the office. 

I pulled closed the door and there he was, staring back at me, in the mirrored door. A clear view in the lit bedroom. He was me, but not quite me. He was shorter than me, his arms and legs proportionate to his height. 

Stories from my childhood came rushing back to me. Stories told in the dark, stories to scare our friends. Stories of creatures that looked like us, but not quite. Small differences that gave them away. These creatures haunted us, watched us. Some stories told of these creatures trying to lure us away to their world. These creatures would act scared to lull us in. Those that came in contact with these creatures were never heard from again. I dismissed them long ago as children’s scary stories, but there he was, staring at me through the mirror. Their names escaped me, but then I suddenly remembered…

Humans! The word suddenly came to light. This creature was a human, trying to be me.

It stared at me, eyes wide in fear. I smiled at it and its eyes widened even more. It flinched, as if trying to run, but could not move. Its lips were moving, but I could not hear its cries. I reached up to touch the glass, but came upon the familiar feel of my own flesh. I could now hear the faint incoherent mumblings of this creature.

These humans were not so scary as the stories led us to believe. Grinning wider, I moved closer to the mirror.

This human didn’t seem to be scary, quite the opposite. Maybe it was time to branch out, step outside my simple life, maybe learn something about these humans. It would certainly be a story to tell.

Similar mind numbing work behind a keyboard and screen, but I’d have my own office and an entire floor would be underneath my watchful gaze. 

It was an easy decision. My parents had both passed away and I had no other family or siblings, no loved ones, no one to keep me tethered there. It really came down to breaking out of my comfortable shell. Something told me to go, and I swung and cracked though. Packed up my scant belongings, my simple life, and was soon in a larger town, but not quite the bustling city most of my generation prefer. I set up shop and gingerly settled into my new role.

I wouldn’t call myself a hard ass boss my any means. My people preformed exceptionally well, and I allowed them to do so. I wasn’t one to crack the whip, but if I had to talk to someone, I did. I could see the entire floor from within my glass cage and, in turn, they could see me, could see I was always just as busy as they were. Hopefully it was respect. There was always that small part that gnawed at me though. Whenever I would peak over my monitor to see someone hunched near a coworker: were they talking about me? How awful a bass I really was? Higher ups never chewed me out, but I also never received accolades. Was I doing enough?

I never socialized with them outside of the office, but I could tell you all their names, their hobbies. That didn’t matter though, I was content with my humble, simple life. My average life. Maybe that was the problem…

The first time I saw them, I was on my way back to my office, a freshly filled mug in my hand. Heading down the central aisle between desks, I took a sip and glanced towards my office. I stopped dead in my tracks, spitting coffee back into the mug. Someone was sitting at my desk, head down. All I could see was the top of his head peeking over the monitor. I didn’t remember corporate saying anyone was visiting. There was something so familiar about that dark brown hair, like I had met this person before. 

A voice broke my gaze from the glass walls. Giselle Swenson looked up at me, a Flickr of concern in her green eyes. She enjoyed spending her weekends hiking around the nearby trails.

“You okay, boss?”

I smiled at her, clenching the handle of the mug so I didn’t spill the steaming coffee. Was she blushing? 

“Oh yes, I’m fine, Giselle,” I lied. “ Just remembering an email I forgot to send.”

“Uh oh,” she feigned fear, raising a hand to lightly brush my arm. “ Don’t wanna peeve off the hierarchy. “

Did her blush deepen? I’d never considered any sort of relationship with any of my employees. I honestly preferred the life of solitude.

“ Definitely,” I retorted with a forced chuckle.

“Better get back at it then, big man.”

Big man? Giselle had already returned to her work. Her black nails clicking across her keyboard. My gaze shot back to my office…my empty office. I sat down, rubbing my eyes, then looked out at the floor. Nothing seemed out of the ordinary. No one out of place like they had dashed from my office during my short interaction. 
Maybe it had been a trick of the light. Was I losing it?

 Maybe things were taking a toll on me and I refused to admit it. I tried to shrug it off, but it kept me on edge the rest of the day. Maybe that would have been the end of it, but that was not the last time.

It was some time later, days had passed,, bordering on months. I had forgotten about the incident, going about my life as normal. This time I knew it was not a trick of the light, and it shook me to my core.

I lived in a nice one bedroom apartment not far from the office. I walked to work, it was so close. I used the time to separate myself from the office, and to people watch along the way. Most didn’t notice, some gave me a questioning glare. The occasional smile or furtive glance, even a nod or wave every once in awhile, which I would cordially return. I kept to myself, but wasn’t rude about it. I had no desire to learn more about these people, but they had done nothing to irk me. 

I had left the office long after everyone else, staying late to wrap up some weekly items before the weekend. I grabbed my bag and the dark red sweatshirt, it had been a chilly few days. It was my favorite color, and quite the comfortable Hoodia, one I had had since before my move here. I could easily get something else, perhaps more professional, but it was just so damned comfortable and fit perfectly. 

Leaving the lobby I immediately turned left to begin my usual route home. The street was bustling, but not nearly as busy as it would have been around quitting time. A crisp wind brushed my face as I looked up and down the street, eyes darting to and from. The grey sedan whizzing past, stirring up a warmer, chemically tainted breeze. The elderly gentleman across the street walking a rather pudgy beagle. The rather attractive female bending over down the road to retrieve her dropped phone. The sights, the sounds, the smells, it allowed me to let my mind wander to the upcoming weekend. A couple days I would probably spend at home with a good book.

“On your left!”

The words broke my spell. I scooted right as a man my own age jogged by. A fit specimen and I couldn’t help but let my eyes linger to the shorts that hugged his exquisite buttocks. Perhaps a little too long, but I was entranced until those chiseled cheeks turned a corner.

My gaze returned forward, and that’s when I saw them. 

They stood at the corner up ahead, probably waiting to cross. The same corner I would cross to get to my apartment. Someone in a dark red Hoodia, very similar to my own, but with the hood pulled up over their head. The same bag as mine draped across a shoulder, hanging at their hip. My hand instinctively went to my own, absently stroking the dark canvas. They were shorter than me, but something seemed off about their stance, but I just couldn’t quite place what. 

I was about to shrug it off as the most bizarre consequence. I mean, I took this same route twice a day, daily, for several years and had never seen such a similar get up as mine. Then their head turned and my knees nearly gave out. Time itself seemed to slow down. My own face was underneath that hood. My own face! My own face, yet not quite me face. If he caught a look at me, he didn’t how it. He simply looked both ways then leisurely crossed the road. 

I was transfixed. Locked in place. The world around me failing to properly exist. I could only watch disbelieving, as I walked away from myself. It felt absurd to think like that, but that was all my shocked brain could muster at the time. He moved onto the opposite corner and I lost track of him in a group of people. My eyes darted, struggling to find the dark red Hoodia, but in the waning daylight, it proved unfruitful. He-me?- was gone. The world slowly came back into focus.

Streetlights springing to life. The scent of the nearby steakhouse wafting on the chilly wind. An annoyed grumble parting the fog.

“Sightsee somewhere else, buddy.”

I don’t remember making it home, but somehow I did. Hastily locking the door, shrugging off my bag and letting it fall to the floor. Tearing my hoodie off. I stood there silently, just staring at the sweatshirt in my hands. I threw it across the dark room, letting it disappear into the shadows before shuffling and falling into my couch. I rubbed my eyes, massaging my temples, struggling to calm my racing heart. 

The incident from just over a month ago came rushing back. I had just glimpsed the top of a head then, but I vaguely 4emembered something familiar about it. Had I seen that same person that day too? So many questions rushed into my head.  Did I have a twin brother my parents had never told me about? If so, why? Was work harder on me than I was admitting to myself and I was losing my mind? 

The walls I had built around my simple little life were cracking. I could feel a dull throbbing starting in the back of my head. It was only a matter of time before it crept forward. I needed to get some rest. Maybe that was all I really needed, but I knew it would not come easily. Not without outside help. I would have loved to just knock myself out with a frying pan like some cartoon character, hopefully forget about all this. 8 also knew that that was not practical. I was shaken up and not thinking clearly. I would need some help of the medicinal or alcoholic variety, probably a mixture of both.

I dreamed that night. With the events of the evening and the medicinal cocktail to knock me out, I wasn’t surprised. I remember it so clearly, unlike most of the dreams I have.
I was walking along a worn path, gnarled trees lining each side. Beyond them all I could see was a bluish-gray fog. It was dead silent, almost oppressive. I walked along the path. Nothing seemed to change. The trees were mirrors of each other, stretching along both sides of the path. I just kept walking. Eventually I noticed a blurry form taking shape further up the path. I was unsettled but kept moving. I could faintly make out a rectangular shape. Was it the door out of this place? I started moving faster in hopes it was, but still shooting glances all around, keeping an eye on my ominous surroundings.

No it wasn’t a door. I stopped. A form was moving towards me within the rectangular frame. It moved when I moved, paused when I paused. I raised my hand and waved, the form followed suit. A mirror? I moved forward to stand before the mirror. This close it was far taller than me, but there my reflection stood, staring back at me in bewilderment. 

Yet it wasn’t quite me. Its proportions were off, barely noticeable from afar, but this close it was clear. It was me, but not me. It raised its hands and pressed them against the glass. It stared at me with soulless eyes as a smile grew on its face, stretching into a menacing rictus.

“Wake up,” I whispered to myself, scared to take my gaze off the reflection but desperately not wanting to look upon it.

 Its hands emerged from with the frame. I struggled to turn and run, to move at all, but I was paralyzed, frozen to the spot. The hands grabbed my shoulders, digging in and pulled me towards the mirror, slowly, agonizingly so, pulling me towards it. I could only look on in fear as I was pulled past the frame of the mirror, closer to the me that wasn’t me…

I awoke with a gasp. I was standing in front of my closet doors, which were a pair of full length sliding mirrors. I screamed quietly at my own reflection and fell back into the bed behind me.

 Struggling to calm my racing heart. How did I get up to stand in my sleep? What kind of messed up dream was that? I was clearly losing it. The clock said it was just after three in the morning. I sighed knowing sleep would elude me tonight. 

I spent the rest of the night and the day puttering around the apartment. Did the man I saw the previous evening cause the bizarre nightmare? Did I even get a clear enough look at his face to be certain he looked so damned similar? The sweatshirt and bag were identical. Sure it had been waning light, but I knew what I had seen. The previous vision from my office nearly a month ago reiterating that. Was it possible I had a twin brother no one had ever told me about? My parents and I had been close and surely they wouldn’t have kept that from me.. there were scant family members I could reach out to. Both of my parents had come from very small families. I tried to think of anyone I could ask and if I should even reach out with such a ridiculous question. 

I spent the day trying to occupy myself with menial tasks around my apartment, but nothing could distract me from everything that had occurred within the last 24 hours. Sure it had all started with that quick glimpse in the office, or had it? What if there had been other times this individual had been right beside me on the street, or standing in line behind me at the store, but I had missed it? That thought brought a slight chill down my spine. I thought about going down to the small park behind my building to get some fresh air, but what if I saw him sitting at a bench across the park? The thought of looking out the window, seeing him sitting at a park bench shook me to my core, causing me to stay away from my windows altogether. 

The TV played in the background, but I had no idea what was playing, nor did I care. It was more a distraction from the silence that would cause my mind to wander some dark corridors.
Some way, somehow the day passed. Before I knew it, the sun was setting. A mixture of stressed out exhaustion and copious amounts of medication and alcohol found me drifting into a somewhat fitful sleep. Thankfully there was no nightmares this go, but I was jarred awake just after one in the morning.

The apartment was silent, but a glow was coming from the living room. Had I left the television on? I was sure I had turned it off and I was certain I would not have muted it.

“Hello?” I called, immediately feeling foolish. If I was being robbed, I just alerted them.

There was just silence and the flickering glow from what was clearly the television. I must have left it on. 

I groggy got out of bed and ambled into the living room. I got a few steps in before looking up and stopping dead in my tracks. Silhouetted against the light from the television was a form sitting on the couch. Even in the dim light, I knew who it was.

“How the fuck did you get in here!?” I demanded, all traces of my sleep flushing 8tselfmout of my system.

No response. He just kept watching the screen.

“Hey!” I shouted, stepping closer. “you’ve got the wrong place!”

Nothing, not even a flinch. I took another step closer, resting my hands on the back of the couch. That’s when he glanced over his shoulder and bolted to his feet. Standing there in nothing but a pair of boxer briefs, even in the fluctuating light of the television, there was no doubt this man was my twin. He stood there, arms outstretched, eyes agape. His mouth was moving frantically, but no sound was coming out. He looked like he was shouting, but I heard nothing.

“Who are you?”

He was clearly as taken aback as I was, waving his arms in front of him as if was trying to ward off an attacker. He glanced towards the front door, then to the bedroom, as if trying to discern which was the best bet to get away from me.

“who are you!?” I said again, 4aising my voice. “How did you get in here?”

I stepped toward him and he made his choice, taking off for the bedroom. I grabbed the sides of my head. What the fuck was going on here? Was I dreaming again? Should I follow him? There was no way out from there, but what if had a weapon and was lying in wait in the darkness? Clearly I had startled him. Maybe he was some junkie who had forced his way in, but that didn’t explain the unbelievable resemblance to me. Maybe I should’ve just called the police and let them handle him, but I needed answers.

I moved towards the bedroom, flicking the switch near the door, hoping to catch him off guard. The room was bathed in a soft yellow glow, but was empty. My eyes went to the closed closet, the only place he could have hid. I hadn’t heard the doors slide open or closed, but in the heat of the moment it was possible it was missed. 

“I know you’re in the closet. If you come out, get dressed, and leave I want call the cops.”

Nothing.

I grabbed a book off my nightstand, the closest thing I had to a weapon. The plan was to tear open the door, hitting him with the book, hopefully stunning him enough to get control. I stared at my reflection raising the book and pushed the door open. Shouting, tossing the book while swinging my arm amongst the hanging shirts and pants, trying to cause a commotion to disorient him. He made no response to the flurry, and I soon realized the closer was devoid of anything living. Confused, I thoroughly checked every inch of the closet before giving up.

Where had he gone? I know he hadn’t gone into the bathroom and the bedroom window was closed, the curtains undisturbed. Besides which, he would have to be absolutely insane to jump out of a seventh floor window with no balcony. I rubbed the back of my throbbing head. Maybe I was losing it. Maybe it was time for a vacation from the office. 

I pulled closed the door and there he was, staring back at me, in the mirrored door. A clear view in the lit bedroom. He was me, but not quite me. He was shorter than me, his arms and legs proportionate to his height. 

Stories from my childhood came rushing back to me. Stories told in the dark, stories to scare our friends. Stories of creatures that looked like us, but not quite. Small differences that gave them away. These creatures haunted us, watched us. Some stories told of these creatures trying to lure us away to their world. These creatures would act scared to lull us in. Those that came in contact with these creatures were never heard from again. I dismissed them long ago as children’s scary stories, but there he was, staring at me through the mirror. Their names escaped me, but then I suddenly remembered…

Humans! The word suddenly came to light. This creature was a human, trying to be me.

It stared at me, eyes wide in fear. I smiled at it and its eyes widened even more. It flinched, as if trying to run, but could not move. Its lips were moving, but I could not hear its cries. I reached up to touch the glass, but came upon the familiar feel of my own flesh. I could now hear the faint incoherent mumblings of this creature.

These humans were not so scary as the stories led us to believe. Grinning wider, I moved closer to the mirror.

This human didn’t seem to be scary, quite the opposite. Maybe it was time to branch out, step outside my simple life, maybe learn something about these humans. It would certainly be a story to tell.

A Quiet Bloom in the Shadows

----

I am thirty, alone — but not unloved.
I move through this world like a shadow with purpose: busy, constant, unseen.
Days are filled with the hum of tasks, people I meet only halfway, and a silence that grows louder when the lights go out.
I have just stepped out of a five-year story, one written in invisible ink —
A love that bloomed behind drawn curtains,
A partnership shaped like a secret, Too tender for the world’s harsh light.

We were a hushed heartbeat,
A duet in a locked room.
And though it mattered deeply —
Though we mattered —
We lived in parentheses. And now, the page has turned.

What is this era, then? This ache I carry with elegance?
This new terrain where I am free and not free,
Desiring and withholding,
A romantic not quite brave enough to be seen chasing love.
In the language I speak fluently but only to myself.

I am not lonely — not really —
Just open in a quiet way. I catch myself watching couples on park benches. Hands brushing, laughter spilling out.
I feel a soft envy, not of them, but of the simplicity.
To just be. To want without negotiating the price of visibility.

This is my hopeless romantic era.
But hopeless doesn’t mean without hope.
It means stubborn. It means soft even after all that hardness.
It means I still write poems in my mind
About hands I haven’t held yet,
About glances that linger,
About the possibility that someone, someday,
Might see all of me and not blink.

I crave connection like an introvert craves quiet:
Intensely, but in doses.
I want to be known in the quietest ways —
A shared smile over coffee,
A hand finding mine under a restaurant table,
A coming out that is not a declaration,
But a slow unveiling — soft and true.

And until then, I'll continue to romanticize everything.
The way the sky blushes at sunset.
The warm weight of a book resting on my chest.
The imaginary conversations I have with someone who doesn’t exist yet, But who might. I know will.

This is my era of feeling deeply,
Of wanting fiercely but gently,
Of letting love grow in shadow
Until I am ready to let it reach the light.

And maybe —
Just maybe —
The next chapter won’t be written in whispers.
Maybe next time, love will be loud.
Or at least,
at the very least,
Unafraid.

1kchjyj,https://www.reddit.com/r/Cuphead/comments/1kchjyj/what_are_your_charm_ideas/,What are your Charm Ideas?,"If Studio MDHR decided to add more charms to the game, what are some ideas you wish they would implement? I'm honestly kind of dissapointed with the base game's charms. Twin Heart is very similar to Heart and better than it in most use cases. Coffee is generally the only charm worth using when trying to S rank airplane levels (unless you can pull off a Whetstone speedrun strategy). Parry Sugar is nice, but situational etc. Anyway, here are my ideas.

**Directional Dash**

It allows the player to dash in 8 directions as opposed to two. This was a planned DLC Charm, but unfortunately, it was never officially released. It would be a great alternative to Smoke Bomb in several boss fights like Sally Stageplay. It would also help against the platforming bosses like Grim Matchstick and Rumor Honeybottoms. For the Airplane levels, the charm could just maintain the enhanced speed after coming out of mini-plane for 2 seconds (with a 5 second cooldown).

**Glass Cannon**

The player deals 40% more damage, but takes 3 damage from enemy attacks (so they effectively die in one hit, but still get an HP Bonus). Not only does the extra damage allow for very short boss phases, but dying in one hit speeds things up if you're trying to S rank since you can immediately retry instead of pausing and doing a retry. I'm surprised MDHR never did this considering it's literally just an inverted heart that works well. Works identical in airplane levels also.

**Inverted Gravity**

This causes the player to be pulled to the top of the screen as opposed to the bottom of the screen by gravity. This makes certain boss phases like Goopy, The Root Pack, Beppi, King Dice, etc. very easy. It also causes you to take unavoidable damage against other bosses like Werner Warman or Cagney Carnation. This does not affect Lobber. Inverted Gravity is also already in the game as part of Funhouse Frazzle. For airplane levels, it just causes your bombs to fall upward instead of downward. That might be useful against Dr. Kahl or Hilda Berg.

**Phase Reset**

When the player dies, they retry a boss phase from the beginning of the phase they died instead of at the beginning of the fight. But you can't get an A-rank or S-rank for beating fights this way. This would also enable checkpoints in Run & Guns.

I was heartbroken and felt deep guilt for not speaking to him in the months before his death—because my boyfriend didn’t want me talking to other men, even old friends. I left Brazil early to attend the funeral, and while I needed emotional support, my boyfriend was upset I left and didn’t seem to grasp how devastating the loss was. I felt completely alone.

While he remained in Brazil, we had a series of emotional arguments. During one fight, I threatened to break up like we had done in the past, ( as we were young and a little immature at the time) not meaning it. But this time, he agreed. He started expressing doubt about our future and said he wanted to raise his kids in Brazil one day. I was crushed. I had believed we were close to getting engaged. Instead, I spiraled into my lowest point—barely eating, not sleeping, and consumed by anxiety and fear of losing him. Though we stayed together, my sense of emotional safety was badly shaken.

Back at college for my senior year, things were still tense between us, and I felt extremely alone on campus. My best friend had moved off campus, my sister (my roommate) was always with her boyfriend, and most of my other friends had graduated. I prayed to find new friends but struggled. I’ve always found it easier to befriend men, especially since they tend to show interest if they find you attractive. One day, a guy on campus introduced himself, and later we connected on Instagram. He responded to one of my stories, and our conversation led to hanging out.

When we met up to study, and he asked me about my summer. I ended up getting emotional and crying as I opened up about how painful my summer was—losing my best friend, and all the issues I had with my boyfriend. I apologized, and he was kind, telling me he was glad to be there to listen. I think part of me hoped he’d want to be my friend, even if it was because he liked me, because I was desperate for companionship.

Later, we went out for coffee, and he brought up my boyfriend again— I think because we had left our last conversation off with me crying about him and my late best friend. I ended up telling him about my relationship concerns. I admitted I was frustrated about not being engaged yet, and told him about the emotional distance and uncertainty I’d been feeling. I told him about some of my fears with my relationship etc. At the same time, I made sure to say, “But I love him and can’t let him go,” because that was always true. I never doubted that I wanted to stay with my boyfriend. Still, I think I subconsciously made my issues sound more dramatic, maybe to keep this guy’s interest as a friend or listener. But I never saw him as anything more. I have always done this even with my female friends. I used to like to stir the pot for a response (I know, toxic lowkey I’m not proud). I think this is where I fear if it was cheating or not. Because I wonder if me wanting him to have interest in me so he would want to be my friend is considered unfaithful. I never flirted with him or anything but if in my mind I was hoping he would have a little crush so he would want to be my friend more? Is that bad if I don’t directly say anything or flirt? Or is that just an intrusive thought?

I tried to set him up with my friends—both to make my intentions clear and maybe distract him if he did like me. But I also worried that if he started dating someone, I’d be alone again. It wasn’t jealousy, just fear of isolation. He paid for my coffee, wiped spilled coffee off my hand, and offered me his jacket—but I made sure not to wear it, as that felt like something too intimate.

Eventually, I told my boyfriend everything. I had looked up whether having a guy friend was wrong, and most said keeping it a secret was. I didn’t want to hurt him, and I loved him. As soon as I told him, I cut off contact with the guy. I felt no sadness about that—he wasn’t important to me emotionally. I didn’t care about who he was as a person; I just needed someone’s attention to not feel alone.

Since then, I’ve been tormented by guilt. I’ve wondered daily if what I did was cheating—even though I never flirted, never wanted him, and never imagined being with him. I thought I was keeping things respectful and honest. But now, I constantly fear that I crossed a line I didn’t mean to.

This happened almost two years ago. I have not been able to let it go with fear that I cheated. I take cheating very seriously and also have really bad moral OCD that has been diagnosed so I don’t know if it is that or if my fears are true. Thanks so much!!!

I met this woman about a month and a half ago. She’s in med school and therefore extremely busy. We’ve gone on 4 “real” dates, and apart from those I drove her to the airport once, she invited me to workout at her gym, and we’ve gotten coffee and checked out some local shops. Haven’t slept together, but we’ve kissed passionately every time we see each other.

Long story short, we had spent the afternoon together over the weekend— got coffee, walked around etc. and it was a really nice time of connection. The next day, she was texting me and seemed really stressed with school and a few other personal matters that cropped up over the weekend. 

I offered her an ear to vent and a few ideas to distract if she needed. She started taking longer and longer to reply throughout the day, until she told me she just needs to figure out how to manage what’s going on with school and these other things. I told her I get her, I’d give her some space and she could feel free to text me later.

She didn’t, and I haven’t heard from her in 3 days. 

Considering we met on an app, it’s a given she’s talking to other guys, as I have been talking to other girls. We haven’t had any real conversations about where things are headed, although preferences are listed as long-term relationship/monogamy. We both have been very open with one another and have connected on a pretty deep level. We talk on the phone regularly, and have texted every single day since we matched up until this point.

I’d like to maintain this connection, and I worry that most advice of “let her come to you” you read online is entirely manipulative game-playing. Everyone I’ve talked to for advice is giving me entirely mixed responses. 

I can be a persistent guy, but I don’t want to burn the bridge by contacting too soon. What I want to do in reaching out is, 1. check in on how she’s doing 2. get some read on her level of engagement 3. communicate my intentions 4. gain some clarity on if this is worth pursuing on my end. Obviously, not going to fire all that off at once, but if a dialogue can be opened those are my priorities in our communication at this point.

How long is too long or too soon at this early of a stage to wait for her? Can I reach out or is that too much? I’m definitely overthinking how to balance this. In the end, I know I’ll be fine moving on if it’s over, but for now, I feel foolish in either assuming it’s over or assuming it’s not.

Thanks.

Why YSK:
Most people struggle to focus, not because they're lazy, but because they've never trained for it. Your brain is like a muscle. If you've spent years overstimulated by phones, notifications, and constant mental clutter, it's no wonder focus feels impossible. But the good news is? Focus can be rebuilt with the right habits and consistent effort.

Why You Can’t Focus
You've conditioned your brain to always chase instant dopamine. Every time you switch tasks instead of staying present, you're reinforcing distraction. Like lifting weights, building focus feels uncomfortable at first, but that discomfort is the training.

5 Good habits to boost energy & focus

Take cold showers in the morning, this will normally boost dopamine and kickstart your nervous system.

Get early morning sunlight, set your body’s internal clock and improve wakefulness.

Wait 90 minutes after waking to drink coffee, helps avoid the afternoon crash.

Avoid constant content consumption or jumping between tabs. These repetitive distractions drain your focus over time.

Practice deep breathing to lower stress and improve mental clarity throughout the day.

How to actually train focus

Use 90-minute deep work blocks, 1 to 3 per day.

During breaks, move your body and avoid mental stimulation (walk, clean, stretch).

Struggling to focus? Good, that’s the mental “burn.” Keep returning your attention to the task.

Bonus Tips

Your first 8 hours of the day are your most productive, especially the first 2. Prioritize meaningful work during this window.

Find work that feels like play. The more you enjoy it, the longer and deeper you'll be able to focus.

Hope this helps someone who feels stuck in the loop. You can take your attention back it just takes reps, like the gym.

I rarely get hangovers but if i do i don’t even want to think about alcohol for days if not a week or 2. 

I tend to compulsively do things in general. If i have zyns around i always have one in my lip, if i buy coffee pods ill drink 3 or 4 coffees throughout the day, if i have snacks i eat them all in a day or two. 

I def think i qualify as a functional alcoholic based purely on consumption amount and frequency but wonder if most alcoholics struggle with impulse control in general. I switched to kratom for a while with success but i honestly am not sure that’s much better than drinking.

Lately i’ve been getting really painful acid reflux once a week or so and it’s probably attributable to the drinking. 

Also is it appropriate to consider AA if i don’t have the goal of quiting drinking? I’d like to get back to just enjoying it on occasion.

Review inside!,"The **Keurig K155 Office Pro Commercial** coffee maker has managed to create quite a buzz among coffee enthusiasts. After spending weeks with this machine, brewing everything from rich coffees to flavorful teas and even iced beverages, I feel equipped to share the nitty-gritty of my experience. While there’s a lot to love about this device, it’s not without a few quirks that might be dealbreakers for some.

**Sleek Design with Office-Friendly Features**  
This coffee maker definitely looks the part. Its metallic finish and modern style immediately stood out when I first set it up in my office kitchen. It’s compact enough that it doesn’t hog the counter space, even with its generous dimensions of 10.38""D x 14""W x 13.8""H. The silver finish, paired with a well-designed LCD touchscreen interface, gives off a premium vibe that’s sure to impress colleagues or visitors. One of my coworkers even remarked on how professional it looked, joking that it’s “the Bentley of coffee makers.” While it leans toward a more industrial aesthetic, it blends well in most settings without being distracting.

**Intuitive Touchscreen Interface and Customization Options**  
The **touchscreen interface** on this coffee maker is one of its standout features. It’s vibrant, easy to navigate, and highly customizable. You can program your preferred brew temperature, schedule the machine to turn on or off, and even change the interface language to English, Spanish, or French. Honestly, the programmable nature of this machine saved me so much time on groggy mornings. With a single touch, I could enjoy my coffee exactly how I wanted it. The flexibility doesn’t end here; there are four brew sizes to choose from—4 oz., 6 oz., 8 oz., or 10 oz.—to cater to every caffeine need. My favorite setting? The 8 oz., which struck the perfect balance between strength and volume.

[Check Keurig K155 Office Pro Commercial deals on Amazon now.](https://tastefulcoffee.com/p/b00dwkehu4/)

**Pour-Over Water Reservoir for High Volume Usage**  
This machine’s **90 oz. removable water reservoir** is a lifesaver for busy office environments. During an intense brainstorming session, the coffee maker powered through serving a dozen co-workers without breaking a sweat. Refilling is a straightforward process, and since it’s a pour-over model, installation complexity is nonexistent. Unfortunately, the large reservoir does add some bulk to the design, making it less suited for tighter spaces. I did notice, however, that if it isn’t seated just right, the machine refuses to work. It’s a minor annoyance, but something to keep in mind.

**Brewing Performance and Versatility**  
The coffee quality is excellent—for a single-serve brewer. I’ve tested everything from K-Cup pods to reusable filters (thankfully, it supports those), and the results were consistently great. Whether it’s strong coffee for late nights, mellow tea for afternoon breaks, or indulgent hot cocoa, the machine holds up its end of the deal. That said, the lack of a milk frother limits drink creativity. I missed having lattes or cappuccinos without resorting to a separate device.

**Drain and Store Feature for Portability**  
For anyone who moves coffee makers between home and office, this is a game-changer. Keurig has included the option to easily drain water from the internal hot water tank, making transport and storage a breeze. Recently, I loaned it to a friend hosting a family gathering, and the convenience of draining the tank beforehand made it hassle-free. However, regular users probably won’t need this feature often.

**Good Aspects**  
- Highly intuitive touchscreen interface.  
- Adjustable brewing customization with four sizes available.  
- Large 90 oz. water reservoir cuts down on frequent refilling.  

**Areas of Concern**  
- Slightly bulky, especially for small kitchen counters.  
- Inflexible for specialty beverages like lattes due to no frother.  
- Reservoir placement can make operation finicky at times.  

**Competitive Options**  
When stacking this coffee maker against its rivals, there are clear winners and losers. Machines like the **Nespresso VertuoPlus** might appeal to those who prioritize better extraction technology or built-in frothers, while the **Cuisinart SS-10P1** offers more versatility with reusable pod compatibility and a hotter brew temperature. However, the **Keurig K155** outshines many competitors in its **ease of maintenance, high capacity, and reliable performance**. It lands nicely in the middle—perfect for those looking for fuss-free brewing but less ideal for gadget-enthusiasts wanting more features.  

**Value Proposition**  
For what it offers, the price feels justified compared to cheaper models that lack programmable features or have smaller reservoirs. While machines with integrated frothing capabilities or faster brewing times might come at a slightly higher cost, the balance this device strikes between functionality, volume, and ease of use is hard to ignore. For office use, it’s particularly cost-efficient, considering how many cups it churns out without overwhelming its user.

* Design and customize every detail of their shop interior.
* Craft unique drinks, desserts, and full menus.
* Hire and manage staff.
* Attract and interact with all types of costumers.

The tone of the game is calm and cozy, similar in vibe to titles like *Animal Crossing* and *Unpacking*, but with a focus on simulation and customization mechanics. I believe there's a lot of potential here for something both creative and commercially viable.

**What I'm searching for:**

I'm looking for passionate team members who want to collaborate and help shape this project from the ground. Specifically, I'm hoping to find:

* **3D Modelers/Artists** (stylized, cozy low-poly aesthetic/similar to the Unpacking artstyle).
* **Programmers** (Unity or Unreal experience preferred).
* **UI/UX Designers.**
* **Writers/Narrative Designers** (if you're interested in helping me create customer stories or world lore).

No strict experience requirements, just passion, creativity, and consistency.

  
**Revenue Plans:**

At this time, the project is **unpaid**. However, if we get to a stage where the game is ready for release (Steam, Itch, etc.), the plan is to implement **fair revenue sharing** based on team contributions. The main goal is to create something meaningful, fun, and potentially profitable for everyone involved.

5.      I remember pressing it hard against my skin sometimes. Feeling the coolness, then the warmth leaching from my own body into the stone. What was I trying to do? Absorb it? Understand it by touch? A small, stupid ritual against the larger unknowns.

8.      Suppose I admit it: my primary orientation is towards a piece of rock. I love blue, but the world seems to be saturated with green. A point of cold pressure just below my throat. Sometimes I forget it's there, until I shift wrong, or the chain catches, it suddenly catches against the ordinary fabric of the day. An inescapable weight.

9.       I read that Meteorites carry traces of amino acids. Building blocks of life. Here, they brought death. And this fragment I wore? It seemed to carry only the echo of his pain. A building block of distance. Is that life?

10.  Performance becomes second nature in a town like Smallville. The Smile. The Tilt of the Head. The Appropriate Level of Grief. The Necklace was part of that uniform. I remember catching its reflection in the window of the Talon, superimposed over my own face. Which was the mask?

11.   She catches me touching the stone again. A flicker in her stare—not judgment, just… always noticing. My thumb hides the green. But she’s already turning away. What did she see? A souvenir, or the scar; maybe just the chaotic green I wear.

12.   Are the hinges of my apartment made of glass?  The coffee shop was supposed to be a serene space. It’s more like diorama of my entrapment: I’m like both prisoner and exhibit, serving lattes in a cage dressed as a Nilotic sanctuary.

13.  Is it a sin to crave the texture of truth? Even if it's cold, sharp-edged? This stone doesn’t lie. Its green simply *is*. Unlike the shifting landscapes in people’s eyes, the careful architecture of their smiles. This weight, at least, feels constant. But maybe that’s the biggest lie of all – mistaking mineral silence for honesty. My own pathetic fallacy.

14.  Is it possible to get used to poison? A low dose, every day, until your body doesn't register the sickness, just the constant unease. Until the green glow feels like normal light.

15.  What do you do when the person you love causes you physical pain, just by being near what defines *you*?

16.  Paris had soft light. Grey stone that absorbed sound. Stood before Monet’s Nymphéas for an hour. All that blue felt like a different planet. Could barely remember the colour green. A lie, of course. You never forget the feel of the cage.

17.  Took it off. Placed it in a cedar box Nell had made years ago. The sudden lightness felt wrong. Like an amputation.

18.  People talk about scars fading. Does embedded radiation fade? Or does it just become part of your cellular makeup, indistinguishable from the self? You carry the source within. Removal doesn't guarantee decontamination.

19.  From the sky-fire that took them. My parents. And I wear it. Daily. Is this piety, or a kind of morbid map-making? An attempt to trace the coordinates of absence, right here, against my own skin.

20.  The Talon. My messy, imperfect try at something real. Coffee grounds on the floor, the clatter of mugs. Then Clark would walk in, and the air would thicken. The green stone, even tucked under my shirt, felt suddenly loud. A tuning fork for his evasions. He'd promise. *This time, Lana.* And the stone felt like a lie detector against my own pulse. Steady, knowing beat: *No.*

21.  Is memory just choosing which bruises to press on? Over and over...or am I? This one is—cool and green; perpetually tender.

22.  He once gave me a rare orchid. Perfect, waxy petals. Unreal. He said its particular shade reminded him of my eyes. I think it reminded him of the necklace. Something beautiful, cultivated, and containable. Something he could eventually own.

23.  I confess I have built a life around a piece of green stone. A shard collected from the wreckage. It rests against my sternum now, always cool. They say remember the those we lost.  Suppose I admitted that some days, the coldness of it feels less like memory, more like the core of the loneliness itself.

24.  The feeling of the chain, thin against the skin on my neck. Sometimes catching a strand of hair. A tiny, persistent irritation. A reminder.  
  


25.  Sometimes, it’s just green. Dull jade in the shade. Other times, caught in a certain light, it seems to pulse. A faint, unhealthy viridescence leaking out. Like poison trying to pass as jewel. Like a secret held so tight it glows.

26.  A man out by Hob's Pond swore he saw lights fall the night of the shower. Said they hummed a tune. People called him crazy. Maybe. Or maybe just observant.  
  


27.  Do memories attach themselves to objects? Or do objects become anchors for the storm inside? Pressing the cool green stone against my temple. Trying to still the thoughts. A futile exercise. Like trying to map fog.

 

28.  Authenticity? Tried to find it in textbooks, in relationships, in independence. Is it something you find? Or something you are granted?

29.  That hard, phosphorescent green. The color of this rock, yes. But also oscilloscope screens. Digital rain in *The Matrix*. An unnatural energy. A signal from somewhere else, disrupting everything.

30.  And Lex. He arrived with answers. Not truths, perhaps, but answers. Plausible surfaces. Explanations like smooth, cool stones skipping over the murky depths Clark navigated. Lex didn’t carry a secret like a burden; he wielded secrets like tools. Or weapons.

31.  Hold it up to the window on a rainy day. Does stone absorb sorrow? It just refracts the gray light, dense and mute. I read somewhere about rocks holding magnetic memory. Perhaps this piece remembers the fire, the speed, the impact. Maybe I touch it hoping for transmission. A jolt of clarity. Am I simply assigning narrative weight to a random piece of cosmic debris?

32.  Does the green fade? Or just seep deeper into the bloodstream? Still waiting for an answer.

33.  That necklace, that small green thing, made his proximity agony. Think about that. Love as proximity-induced pain. The green glow, the color of an impossible equation.

34.  A snag. The chain catches on the wool of my sweater. Just a tiny, routine friction. And suddenly: the linoleum floor of the hospital, the smell of antiseptic, the sticky green soap in the dispenser. *That* green. This stone didn't create the feeling, it just gave it a locus. Something tangible to wear around my neck, a portable memento of the moment the world cracked.

35.  To find oneself irrevocably altered. Choiceless. Defined by an event, carrying its physical remnant. Its muteness. That is the point, perhaps. A constant, quiet assertion of the rupture. Maybe this uncomfortable persistence is the closest thing to truth I possess.

36.  My fingers find it without thinking. Stress, uncertainty, a sudden chill—the familiar smooth shape; the outline of its mineral stubbornness.

37.  How to describe Lex’s control? Not chains. More like… altering the magnetic poles. So all your compasses point toward him. Even your own body, a traitor collaborating with the narrative he spun. Phantom life. Sickeningly precise.

38.  His pain. A physical thing. A barrier woven into the fabric of the town, the air, the necklace. My closeness was agony for him. Love measured in excruciating proximity. Green was the color of that impossible space between us.

39.  What is this compulsion to touch it? Trace its edges until my fingerprint smudges its surface? Not like wanting Clark, the heat of that. No. This is different. A desperate, almost geological curiosity. What would happen if I put it in my mouth? Let the cold strangeness dissolve on my tongue? The *wanting* is there- Is it a strange thought? To integrate it somehow. To understand its alien indifference from the inside out.

40.  To want truth so badly you’d tear the world apart for it. Then realize you might be tearing yourself apart instead.

41.  Trust erodes like sandstone. Faster here. Each lie, each evasion, not a hammer blow, but water dripping. Persistent. Inescapable. You wake up one day and the foundation is just… gone. Replaced by suspicion. That hard, watchful green.

42.  Is it perverse to miss the weight of it now? The certainty of that specific pain? At least it was a map. A known territory of hurt.

43.  He made the lies physical, undeniable. Cellular. Suddenly the necklace seemed like a childish token. A surface secret. Lex dealt in biological truths, rewritten realities. His deception wasn't a weight; it was an infection. The green I wore felt clean compared to that invisible violation.

44.  I took it off. Put it in a box. Felt like burying a part of myself. The part that waited. The part that believed, maybe, that truth was graspable, solid like stone. It’s more like a tear now than jade stone.

45.  Loneliness can make you mistake control for comfort. I know that now.

46.  Heavier than stone, the weight of what it represented. The unsaid. The perpetually deferred truth. You get used to carrying it, adjust your posture. Until one day you try to stand straight without it and find you’ve forgotten how.

47.  Am I just cataloging grievances? Polishing the stone of my own hurt? Perhaps. But understanding the shape of the cage is the first step, isn't it? Even if you can't find the key.

48.  Sometimes, I dream in green. Not the soft green of new leaves. The hard, phosphorescent green of trapped energy. Of things that fell from a great height and shattered everything. It doesn't fade. That color. It just finds new surfaces to stain.",1,1746127029.0,notgoodphilosophy,0,1.0,False

Which inspired me to post about something else I believe is worth mentioning along with the app organization 

If you discover an app on here, really like
It, but don’t yet have a reason or way to work it into your current workflow, hang on to it instead of trashing it and moving on!

You may more than likely end up becoming the benefactor of a grandfathered license via early adoption or be receiving updates for now paid software 

I personally have a handful of apps I found here months ago, that would run me north of 30 to 50 dollars presently

There is a clipboard app I trashed a while back, saw it had new features and wanted to give it a spin and it’s now 9.99. Free when posted here and I downloaded it 

Now, having said that, absolutely spend your money where you think it is worth it. If you like an app enough to keep it around, throw the developer a coffee or donation, but report 

But, I’m not going to say what is and isn’t a lot of money for any one poster. So, this is just to say, that app you want now? May have had it already

And they should be kind of similar, focusing on that specialty coffee angle, not just big chains like Starbucks unless they have a special Reserve store maybe? I want to know things about them. What's their atmosphere like? People talk about that online, right? So maybe check reviews? Like on Google Maps or Yelp? See what people say about the coffee quality, the vibe, the service, maybe even if it's good for working. Could you find maybe 5 to 7 of the top competitors like this? And for each one, can you tell me their name, their address, maybe a link to their website if they have one? And then summarize what people are saying in the reviews about those key things: coffee quality, atmosphere, service, and suitability for working. Oh, and if you find any mention of their price range, like if they're expensive or average, that would be great too. Just put it all together in a nice list or something I can easily read.

1kcgyxs,https://www.reddit.com/r/csMajors/comments/1kcgyxs/advice_for_incoming_freshmen/,Advice for Incoming Freshmen,"I'm finishing my first year at university, and have declared my major as Mathematics and Computer Science. There is some insights, personal opinion, and opportunities I want to share with incoming freshmen as I begin to wrap up my first year of studies. I'm not going to try to scare people away or complain about how ""THE MARKET IS COOKED!!1!1,"" I am going to share hard nosed, practical advice and personal experience.

Firstly, let's start with this subreddit. Most takes here are WAYYYYY too polarized and binary, and they don't represent the full reality of things. There is almost no neutral, the market is healing when someone gets more than 2 offers, but it's cooked when a sophomore doesn't land an internship at a FAANG company. People talk about their schools either being targets, or nobody coming from them with a CS degree ever having a successful career. It's draining, and it caused me to personally miss out on the nuances of the tech industry earlier in my first semester, because I used this place as a source of info. Don't do that. Use it as a source of entertainment if anything. There is a very specific way the posts here can infiltrate your mind, and make you inherit defeatist mannerisms if you don't pay attention.

So you may be wondering, ""what did you miss out on that you wish you would have known about?"" Glad you asked! (Ik you didn't but just stay with me)

Landing an internship as a freshman is possible, but difficult if you haven't been preparing since high school. As such, for the average individual, your goal should be looking into non-internship based, career development opportunities. Fellowships, career pipeline accelerators, and professional networks are what you should prioritize, alongside personal projects. Obviously apply for internships and research as well, it never hurts to put your name  in the hat. Additionally, there are specific opportunities aimed towards first and second years as well, so look out for those. (Google STEP, Microsoft Explore, NVIDIA Ignite, Pfizer Futures, Jane Street JSIP)

These internships are best case scenario, so like I said, really focus on the other aspects of career development if you can. They are often neglected by this Reddit despite their usefulness. Some examples of this are the MLH fellowship, or Codepath classes, or joining ColorStack if you are a person of color in tech. Also, try to network through clubs, coffee chats, LinkedIn connections, and your major relevant courses. This year is really you setting the layup for a strong sophomore recruiting season.

As for general college advice, I feel like many of the things that I could share are overdone/well known info. Make sure you balance your time well to live life, CS shouldn't encapsulate everything.

DMs are open if you want to hear more about specific opportunities, or about my personal journey. (Also if you want a ColorStack referral but be ready to share personal info if that is the case.)

The format where you get the chance to get to know the demon behind VoxTek Enterprises. 
Oh, and don’t forget, we’ve always been at the cutting edge of innovation, modernity, and, of course, giving you exactly what you want. It's all about keeping you *engaged* my dear people. 
**So go ahead and keep sending in those burning questions.**

For this months edition I have decided to get a little personal, to make up for my lack of presence over this *hectic* month. 
So stay tuned for a handful of *personal* information.


**How do I drink my Coffee?** 
For the record: I prefer my coffee black. None of those sugary, syrupy concoctions for me, no. 
I don’t need to mask the bold, bitter essence of the bean with cream, sugar, or worse - flavored nonsense. 
The beans must be **premium** - nothing substandard will do. I am not some peasant sipping on cheap, watery brew. No, I demand the best. 
Of course there are occasions where I will indulge in something sweeter and far more… *over the top*, but I would not call these beverages *coffee*.

**Do you ever get tired? When do you sleep?** 
I wouldn’t say I get *tired* in the way I used to as a human, but sure there are instances where everyone needs *some* kind of rest. So yes my dear people even I do sleep from time to time.
But do not be fooled, there is **no** instance where something slips me.

**What is your favorite kind of shark?** 
My favourite kind of shark is a hammerhead. Tiger and Blacktip are a close second. Of course my absolute favourite sharks are my own.  

**What are your opinions of the other overlords?** 
What an interesting question. I do regard most overlords with at least some degree of respect, they are *overlords*. 
Well, at least I can make them think it’s respect.  
Some.. well, some I can not stand for very, very good reasons.  
There are, a selected few I regard with respect and partnership.  

**How do you tolerate Val day to day?**  
Ah, Valentino, yes. How do I tolerate him, you ask? Well, you know... I like to think of it as professionalism – with a side of entertainment. 
It’s not exactly tolerance. More like... mutual understanding, if you will. See, I have this unique ability to look past all the... unsavoury details and focus on what really matters when it comes to the relationship between the two of us. 

**But** I do want to empathize here that you all should be careful how you speak about *my* partner.



I do hope I managed to quell your curiosity a little - or even better? Stirred more questions with you my *dear* people. 

Until next month, stay *tuned* and *Trust me.*

Now before we get started I would like to add that I am diagnosed with autism and have this on my record, all shift leaders and managers are aware of this in regards to my social abilities. I am not inept but queues are where I struggle with others. Within the last two months I've noticed that one shift leader has spoken to me about things that I do or say which might be offensive, which is fine since we all have different forms of speech.

  
Here's a list of things I have been ""called out"" for, and later, a list of what actually happened:   
\-talking about the ""lower"" areas 

\-being rude to other workers 

\-discussing politics

\-being sarcastic when asked to do something

Heres what was actually said:

\-My coworker, B, asked why I was in a rush to get off and I explained I had a gyno appointment 20 minutes out, no further details added.

\-When C made a mistake and apologized I said ""because no ones done that before? you're good.""

\-Customer came in with a President2024 hat and ordered a frap, which I said ""not the usual customer?"" to said shift lead

\-When requested to help I say ""if you so insist""   
Mind you, none of my other coworkers have discussed anything with me about this, none of my other shift leaders or my manager, it is only this one shift lead, of which I have a report opened on from when she called me a slur. 

I've discussed this with management and they said that I can be sarcastic and to just hold off on it around her, which I do not mind doing. Yesterday, however, she approached me and said that I have been disrespecting and making other workers uncomfortable with how friendly I am with one of the other staff. I have known this other staff for 5 years and I am unsure how us being friendly would make other people uncomfortable when we just toss playful jokes when business is slow.

I just started working at a new coffee shop, and I'm super anxious about how good I’m doing. I've been there for about a month, and while my manager says I’m great on bar and he has no worries about that, he says that I need to be more confident when interacting with customers (and my coworkers.) He essentially said if he didn’t see improvement in a week or two that he would fire me. 

I’m used to working alone or with one person I know really well, but now I’m going to be working usually in a team with three or more people, and he said everyone has known each other for years and they haven’t had a new person for like two years. I used to be a shift lead, I made all the recipes and did social media and was like the main barista. People would come in when I was working just to get their drinks made by me but now I’m doing none of that and just making drinks lol. That in itself is okay with me but it’s overwhelming and I feel like I'm being watched or judged all the time. I know this is just my brain being mean to me and no one has been outwardly mean or judgey but I have struggled with anxiety my whole life, and even though I'm on medication, it’s still hard for me to project my voice and connect with customers the way they want me to. Especially when I have to initiate the conversation (ex say/shout hi, welcome in right when people walk through the door.) I always find myself speaking too quietly when I’m on register and it definitely discourages me when people don’t hear me (my mind tells me that they’re ignoring me on purpose even though I know it’s probably not true)

I’m also totally used to knowing all the regulars, people come in and I know their order and their name, I can laugh and joke with them, but here it’s like all the regulars come in and they immediately know I’m new and it’s scary 😭 I feel like they would prefer someone else over me. Or like they don’t trust that I can make their drink well.

I really like this job and want to keep it, but I don’t know how to be more confident in this new environment. I talked to my friends about it but they basically just told me to suck it up lol and that it’s not hard to call out someone’s name or say hi and that if I can’t do it I should just quit. (Super helpful and not discouraging at all 😀) I don’t want to, I’ve been a barista since I was 15 and I love the industry and the job (once im comfortable things are so much easier!) so if anyone has tips on how to be more outgoing or strategies to help me feel more comfortable in a team setting, I’d appreciate it so much!!

I’m in the early stages of launching a PIH Engage chapter here in Tulsa, Oklahoma, and I’m looking for folks who might want to join me.

In case you are unaware, PIH Engage is a volunteer network connected to Partners In Health in the fight for global health equity. You’re probably already familiar with their connection to Nerdfighteria via the Maternal Center of Excellence project in Sierra Leone, TB Fighting, etc. 

Like many of you I’m sure, I am deeply disturbed by the recent funding cuts and program terminations that are walking back decades of progress that have been made in domestic and global health. I think PIH Engage is a meaningful and serious way to push back and actually do something about it. It is super organized and focuses on three pillars: advocacy, fundraising, and community education. I have been incredibly impressed with the meetings I have attended so far.

If any of this resonates with you, please comment or DM me to connect!! Would love to get coffee or something to discuss further. We’ll probably start small, but I believe this could become something powerful :)

So, last night I went on my second date—with a completely different guy, not the same one twice. We’ve been texting a little, but honestly? He never really has anything to say. Just dead air. I’m pretty sure he’s one of those low self-monitoring types—no awareness, no effort.

Anyway, I got out of class early and texted him, like, “Hey, wanna get coffee?” He replies slow as hell with all these annoying little logistical questions: “Where are we gonna get coffee this late?” “Are you sure you wanna drive that far?” “Will we have to order food?” Like, okay—if you want to see me, say yes. If you don’t, say no. It’s really not that complicated.

We settle on Denny’s. I tell him I’ll be there in 30 minutes. I pull into the lot and immediately spot the car with wheel well lights and decals—like it’s in a Fast & Furious fanfic. Mechanic vibes. Clearly, I’m staring at his “sweet ride.” I text him I’ve arrived and head in.

We get seated right away and he already looks twitchy. Not in a cute, nervous-first-date kind of way, but in the “Oh no, people are seeing me with a tranny in public” kind of way.

We order coffee. I try to make conversation, but this man is fighting for his life just sitting there. My food comes, and I offer to share. He declines, of course. I try asking basic questions to carry the convo:

“What are your days off?” “I don’t have days off.”

“What do you do for fun?” “I don’t have time for fun.”

Sir. Are you on a date or giving a deposition?

I genuinely can’t believe I did this. So now I’m wondering—do I tell him I’m not interested, or do I just vanish like a raccoon when the porch light turns on?",2,1746125165.0,MtF,1,0.75,False

I feel stupid for still getting excited every time he suggests something. Even when I know there’s a good chance he’ll cancel, I always say yes. I guess I’m just that desperate for company. He’s the only friend I have close by, and I don’t really have other options when it comes to casual hangouts. I end up saying yes, hoping this time will be different, and every time it just stings more.

I’m tired, honestly. Tired of getting my hopes up. Tired of being the only one who seems to care.

I Made Wooden Cups After Seeing a $70 Price Tag, Need Finish Advice!","Hey, everyone I’m a huge fan of wooden home products, and I’ve been wanting to add some wooden cups to my collection for a while. I found a set of handcrafted wooden cups online for $70 each, which I thought was insane! So, I decided to make my own instead.

I used [aserus wood for this project](https://www.woodyegypt.com/products/Wooden-Cups-For-Sale) because I love its grain and smooth texture. I started with a 6""x4"" block I had lying around from a previous project.

Here’s how I went about it:

* I cut the block into two pieces to make a pair of cups, each starting as a 3""x3""x4"" blank.
* I turned the blanks on my lathe, shaping the outside first. I went for a classic cup shape—tapered at the top, with the widest point about 1/3 from the bottom, and a slightly rounded base for stability.
* For the inside, I hollowed it out using a combination of a gouge and scrapers. It took a while to get the walls thin enough (about 1/4"" thick) without breaking through.
* Sanded starting at 120 grit, working my way up to 600 grit. I wet sanded at 400 and 600 with mineral oil to bring out the maple’s natural shine. The cups feel silky smooth now!

Now I’m at a crossroads with the finish. I want these cups to be food-safe since I’ll be using them for drinks like tea, coffee, or even cold juices. But I’m worried about hot liquids—espresso or tea can get close to boiling (around 200°F), and I don’t have a finish that’s both food-safe *and* heat-resistant. I’ve read about mineral oil and beeswax, but I’m not sure if they’ll hold up to hot drinks. Any suggestions for a finish that can handle near-boiling water while being safe for drinking?

For inspiration, the $70 cups I saw online had a more glossy finish and a slightly wider mouth, but I was working from memory and went for a more natural, matte look. I’ve attached a few pics of my cups below, plus a screenshot of the pricey ones that inspired me. What do you think of my cups? And what finish would you recommend?

When I asked again on my last shift, she said she’d ask but there’d be a delay in response due to there being a being a bank holiday. I didn’t message her again about this until this past Monday, to which she said this isn’t her area of expertise and to email head office, which I did the same day. I got an email the next day asking me to ‘stop messaging and calling’ my former manager. I had sent her a total of three messages that day, the first I’d sent since I left and did not call her once - not on Monday, not since I’d left nor have I ever called her.

1kcfx4l,https://www.reddit.com/r/BabyGearReviews/comments/1kcfx4l/does_the_summer_infant_lightweight_stroller/,Does the Summer Infant Lightweight Stroller Deliver Comfort and Style? Full Review,"The Summer Infant 31900 Ingenuity 3Dquickclose CS+ Compact Fold Stroller is a mouthful of a name for a product that surprisingly delivers on its promises. Having personally tested it daily for the past month while navigating busy sidewalks, parks, and the occasional crowded coffee shop, I’ve gained enough insight to break down the good, the bad, and everything in between.

**Design and Build Quality**  
This stroller definitely nails it in the design department. Its lightweight alloy steel frame feels sturdy while being manageable enough for quick grabs in and out of car trunks. The gray fabric choice, although minimalist, has an understated elegance that doesn’t scream “baby gear.” Details like the extra-large canopy and removable bumper bar make an immediate impact on usability. The canopy is vast enough to shield my kid from harmful UV rays, while the bumper bar allows me to lift my little one in and out without ever feeling clunky or poorly designed. Though pretty compact when folded, its length remains a little awkward occasionally, especially in smaller storage spaces.  

**Ease of Use**  
What truly sets this stroller apart is its one-handed folding feature. This “quick close” technology saved me countless embarrassed moments fumbling with other baby gear in crowded areas. Folding it down is as smooth as butter, requiring just a single motion to collapse. At 17 pounds, it’s light enough that even my frazzled mind was grateful for the relief. Whether heading for a quick grocery run or a cross-state road trip, this feature alone catapulted it into being indispensable parenting gear for me.  

[Check Summer Infant 31900 price on Amazon.](https://babycareshop.com/p/b0bsp4k34f/)  

**Performance and Comfort for Baby**  
My baby seemed comfortable throughout most of the rides. The five-point safety harness not only made me feel assured but also kept them snug in the seat. Plenty of recline angles are built-in, ranging from attentive-sitting to napping bliss. That said, the seat padding could use an upgrade, especially for extended outings. My child tugged at the slightly stiff fabric, signaling that things could stand to be softer. On shorter rides, though, it’s honestly hard to fault. Plus, the peek-a-boo window on the canopy adds an extra layer of reassurance as I could always check on them mid-stroll.

**Benefits**  
- The quick-fold mechanism is a lifesaver, especially while juggling children or groceries.  
- Compatible with infant car seats like Graco SnugRide models and Chicco KeyFit, which means instant versatility for new parents.  
- A generously sized storage basket and smaller storage pockets provide ample room for diaper bags, snacks, and even my oversized water bottle.  

**Caveats**  
- The non-padded fabric lining of the seat might lead to a bit of discomfort for long-term sitting.  
- Although light, steering can become slightly wobbly on uneven terrains like gravel trails.  
- The absence of a suspension on the wheels makes it more suited for urban park strolls than bumpier terrains.

**Convenience Features**  
Additional features designed with stressed-out parents in mind genuinely add value. The two cup holders, one for me and another for the toddler, were helpful during hot days. Mobile phone storage was another welcome surprise. These small additions elevate the overall ease of use. I didn’t have to dig through bags to retrieve my essentials, which made rushed errands far less stressful. Care instructions were also straightforward—cold water and mild soap for fabrics and a soft, damp cloth for plastics. This easy maintenance definitely earns bonus points in my book.

**Competing Products**  
While this baby carrier shines bright for convenience and an urban lifestyle, there are contenders worth mentioning. The Baby Jogger City Mini GT2 offers a more seamless suspension system, making it the better choice for trail-goers, albeit at a higher weight. On another spectrum, the Evenflo Urbini Reversi manages to weigh less while providing reversible seating, but it doesn’t fold nearly as compactly as this stroller. Between these, where the 3Dquickclose CS+ excels is its balance of portability and practical day-to-day functionality without breaking the bank. For city dwellers or anyone frequently on the go, this model emerges as a clear winner among the three.

**Cost Efficiency**  
Price often dictates whether something lands in the cart or back on the shelves. For what this stroller lacks (like advanced seating comfort), it does justify its cost as a well-rounded option. Even when compared to pricier alternatives with all-wheel suspensions or reversible handlebars, this remains competitive when viewed through the lens of value-for-price ratio.

I’m going through one of the worst drowsy spells of my life this week and nothing I’m doing helps.

**Staff:**

Lola Santiago, 48, Head Chef, Rio Piedras, Puerto Rico

Head Chef Lola Santiago is a ferocious, no-compromise culinary force, known for her explosive temper and ruthless enforcement of kitchen discipline. Unlike Gordon Ramsay, whose fury is tempered by rare moments of encouragement, Lola is relentlessly enraged, enforcing an ironclad three-strike policy for dinner services. Under her rule, mistakes are not tolerated—one wrong dish, poor communication, or backtalk, and she won’t hesitate to throw an entire team, or both, out of the kitchen without a second thought.

Her strict rules demand nothing less than perfection, and she has no patience for incompetence. While Chef Ramsay delivers sharp-witted insults, Lola's approach is pure fire and brimstone—a verbal onslaught that leaves no room for excuses. She expects absolute obedience, and those who fail to meet her standards will be humiliated, broken down, and tossed aside without mercy.

However, beneath her brutal exterior, Lola is still driven by a singular goal: to mold the best chefs in the industry. She has zero tolerance for mediocrity, but for those who prove their worth, she will recognize their potential—though her praise is exceedingly rare and only given to those who have truly earned it. Every critique, every furious outburst, is her way of finding the strongest chef in the brigade.

In her kitchen, weakness is eradicated, egos are shattered, and only the best survive. Welcome to Chef Santiago’s Hell’s Kitchen—where the heat is unforgiving and only the most unyielding chefs will make it to the top.

Kim Donnelly, 40, Maître d'hôtel, Boston, Massachusetts

Kim Donnelly is the new female counterpart to Marino Monferrato, bringing her own unique touch to the front of the house in Hell’s Kitchen. As the Maître d'hôtel, she is responsible for ensuring smooth communication between the kitchen and the dining room, often handing out tickets to Head Chef Lola. Additionally, when a tableside dish is on the menu, Kim guides the assigned chefs through its preparation with precision and patience.

Unlike her predecessor, Kim has a naturally gentle and composed demeanor. She lacks the inclination to lash out at chefs, never resorting to anger or yelling, even when mistakes are made. Instead, she approaches challenges with a calm and respectful attitude, maintaining professionalism and grace in high-pressure situations. Her ability to keep the dining experience seamless, while fostering a more positive and supportive environment for the chefs, sets her apart as a refined and poised presence in Hell’s Kitchen.

Jake Campbell, 34, Blue Team Sous Chef, Maidstone, United Kingdom

As Head Chef Lola's Sous Chef, Jake Campbell serves as her right-hand man in the kitchen. He upholds the same high standards as Head Chef Lola and often becomes frustrated with contestants’ repeated mistakes. Like his MasterChef counterpart, Jake has a no-nonsense attitude, maintaining a stern and strict demeanor toward chefs who fail to meet expectations. He insists on precision and discipline, ensuring that every chef follows instructions and maintains top-tier quality.

However, beyond his tough exterior, Jake is an encouraging, friendly, and supportive sous chef who genuinely cares about the well-being of the chefs. He actively helps them learn from their mistakes and improve their skills. On multiple occasions, he has been seen offering praise, acknowledging strong performances, and motivating chefs when they excel.

Mary Fairchild, 36, Red Team Sous Chef, Augusta, Georgia

As Head Chef Lola's Sous Chef, Mary Fairchild acts as Head Chef Lola's right-hand woman in the services. She upholds the same high standards and frequently becomes irritated by contestants’ repeated mistakes. While she is more reserved than Sous Chef Jake, she has her limits—when pushed, she won’t hesitate to lash out at any disrespectful chef and will firmly put them in their place if they aren’t doing their jobs properly. Despite this, Mary remains calm and approachable both inside and outside the kitchen, always encouraging chefs to persevere and never give up.

**Conclusion:**

I can't wait for the first episode to be released soon, so we can find out how the 20 new generation contestants started a new journey before the team switch occurs. I also wonder how both teams ended up getting kicked out of all dinner services. Despite that, I am expecting the red team excelling challenges, while the blue team failed miserably in challenges. I'm also excited for drama, romance, punishments, and more bad dinner services. This is going to be one of the most worst teams in the show's history, due to ejection on every dinner service.",2,1746123326.0,HellsKitchenFanFics,0,1.0,False

He's about one year older than me (i'm in second grade, he's in third), we have PE classes together and we sometimes have classes next to each other. Thinking of him has been keeping me up at night for months. I literally can't stop thinking about him. I even did a first move.

 Once during PE, when we weren't doing anything and his friends were not near I approached him. I told him that he's pretty and his haircut really fits his face. He smiled and thanked me and since then, I really wanted to talk to him again. 

In my class there is a girl who's friends with him and from her i know that he's (probably) not dating anyone right now, not gay and rather kind. 

Today when I was talking with my older sister about him, she told me to ask him out on a walk or coffee and I would love to do that. The issue is that i'm quite awkward and don't know how to approach him. I don't know what to say and when to do that, since he's usually with his friends. And if i'll somehow ask him out, what if i'll mess everything up? I'm a huge yapper, i literally have so much to say. Some people hate it and just ignore me after finding out how much i can talk and text. I don't want him to ignore me.

Should i even try to ask him out? And what should i say? When i should do that? What if my constant talking will annoy him?

the long of it:
my friend found a totally abandoned goldfish in a house he was emptying for work, and i had a gruelling 3 or so months of doing everything i could to heal this fish... ultimately after all the treatments money can buy failed to see him improve i decided the humane thing was to euthanize him. it was so sad!!!! pic 3 is the last pic i have of the poor thing. long live pingo!!!!!!

that was the start of my aquarium journey and here we are :) i could have just sold it all off but i want to keep pingo's memory alive (although i will likely never choose a goldfish myself)

stocking:
• 8 neo shrimps (started with 12 but we know how that goes...)
• 1 nerite snail (although you'd never know it)
• some hitchhiker bladder snails (under control for now, i move em to their own little jar-quarium when i can snatch em)
• 13 CPDs and 6 melini corys in quarantine
• plan is to get white cloud mountain minnows, maybe chili rasboras or rasbora erythromycin - i love tiny fish. 
• gonna get 10 more cherry shrimp from my pal with a thriving colony. 
• and maybe some otos once the tank is more mature!

plants:
(wish me luck because im in quebec and my LFS sells with either latin or french names)
• java fern
• anubias - i think the big ine is afzelii and the small one café (coffee?)
• dwarf hair grass in the front there
• slightly bigger grass is dwarf sagittaria
• vallisneria spiralis is the spirally grass
• little guy with leaves is a small bacopa i think?
• vallisneria tall in the back
• lots of elodia (which i LOVE and grows FAST)
• big leafy guy is echinodorus ocelot i believe
• all the rocks are gobi, and ive got a cholla with moss on the right there
