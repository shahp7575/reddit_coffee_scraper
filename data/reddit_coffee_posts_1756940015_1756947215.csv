I didn't do ​much research and agreed to have them all filled when my dentist recommended me to.

  
Recently I saw a lot of people say to not get them done if they don't show any kind of pain and that a lot of people regret getting fillings done because it caused them more problems. To add to that, I found out that the average lifespan of composite fillings is only 5-7 years. This is making me very very very anxious, sometimes I can't sleep peacefully because of this. I'd be lying if I say I don't regret it. I am only 27, I don't want to end up losing my teeth in the​future.

  
Forgot to mention that the fillings were done pretty recently, some are three months ago while the rest are two weeks ago. Now I take care of my teeth by brushing two times a day and started to floss at night, stopped drinking coffee and tea, and I barely snack these days.

1n7w5h5,https://i.redd.it/7pp05ic3o1nf1.jpeg,Sonic The Hedgehog 2: Battle,"Hey Reddit! This is a follow up to my Sonic The Hedgehog DX edit. That edit consisted mostly of light trims, but this one is a bit more aggressive. While the first Sonic movie was a pretty straightforward buddy comedy for kids, Sonic 2 attempts to incorporate more of the video game lore. This is a great thing for us fans, but it results in what I think are essentially two movies competing for attention: a zany family comedy similar to the first film, and a more dense plot-heavy cgi action movie. I've attempted to balance these competing tones a bit better, so that the movie feels more focused. In doing so, I've leaned closer to the latter movie. It's still lighthearted and family friendly, with plenty of Jim Carrey antics, but there are fewer extended detours into wackiness. The ""Rachel's wedding"" subplot has been heavily pruned to the bare essentials, and an extended ""dance battle"" sequence in the middle of the film has also been removed. I've used some new techniques such as Premiere Pro's ""generative extend"" to aid in creating seamless transitions. Please PM if you are interested in checking it out! A full cutlist is below:  
  
25 minutes cut. (122 minutes down to 97 minutes)

[https://fanedit.org/sonic-the-hedgehog-2-battle/](https://fanedit.org/sonic-the-hedgehog-2-battle/)

\-Added disclaimer about fanedits and the use of generative AI, as well as [FE.org](http://FE.org) and Octorox title cards.  
\-Added a fine layer of grain to the entire film. This was needed because it helps to blend some shots that are zoomed in and/or extended with generative extend a bit better.  
\-Removed one instance of Robotnik tasting Sonic's quill and getting zapped. I felt this joke was a bit overused.  
\-Removed montage of Jim Carrey doing spit takes while tasting the mushroom coffee. Now he just does it once.  
\-Removed the narration of Robotnik's plan ""Operation Kick Blue Butticus.""  
\-During opening city sequence, replaced Run DMC's ""It's Tricky"" with ""Run Through the Speed Highway"" Cash Cash RMX from Sonic Generations.  
\-Added a dreamlike effect to every flashback in the movie, so that some newly added flashbacks fit in a bit better.  
\-Rescored Sonic falling overboard with a version of the classic Sonic drowning music from Sonic Generations  
\-Removed flashback to Tom entering Sonic's room, which was an extended sequence of fart jokes.  
\-Removed instances throughout the film of Sonic being referred to by Tom and Maddie as a ""kid"" as well as Sonic calling Tom ""dad"". The themes of family are still there, but I prefer to think of the Wachowskis as a found family rather than a traditional nuclear family unit. Also Sonic is typically portrayed as an older teenager.  
\-Cut down Sonic teasing Tom and Maddie in the ""Sonic Air"" boarding sequence.  
\-Removed the entire scene featuring Sonic Facetiming with Tom in Hawaii, as well as Rachel and Randall's introduction. After Tom and Maddie leave, we don't see them again in this edit until the actual wedding.  
\-Removed Robotnik's ""Wizard of Oz"" joke, which felt a bit tired.  
\-Removed Robotnik calling Knuckles his ""bestest friend forever and ever.""  
\-Trimmed a bit of Jim Carrey acting like he has rabies.  
\-Sonic still makes a joke about Tails's ""butt turning into a helicopter"" but trimmed Tails reaction, including him calling it a ""buttcopter.""  
\-Removed Robotnik saying ""Earth is my turf, G.""  
\-In the scene in Wade's garage, removed Wade's introduction, cutting right to Sonic talking about Knuckles and the Master Emerald.  
\-Cut both instances of Wade's ""Stay Puft Marshmallow Man"" reference.  
\-Cut Wade thinking Longclaw was Sonic or Tails's dad.  
\-Trimmed some of Wade's joke about his classmate named Knuckles.  
\-Removed entire scene of Tom and Randall playing volleyball in Hawaii, as well as the following sequence with Jojo and Maddie.  
\-Sonic no longer says ""I absolutely cannot find my way"" in the snow, since Maddie's setup is gone.  
\-Added some extra winter storm ambience to the scenes outside in the snow.  
\-Used a flipped shot from a later deleted scene to remove the bar patron's aggressive overtures and Tails passing out. The dance battle sequence is also cut, so it didn't make sense to foreshadow that the people in the bar might have a beef with Sonic and Tails. Instead they just think they're a bit weird.  
\-Removed Robotnik's joke about ""The Secret""  
\-Cut entire dance battle sequence and the sequence leading up to it. Instead we transition from Robotnik, Knuckles and Stone in the Mean Bean to Tails and Sonic lounging on the bar and talking. Used generative extend and a digital zoom to make this transition work. I felt the sequence really dragged down this section of the film, and the bar patrons all felt like cartoonish stereotypes. I prefer the human characters be a bit more grounded to contrast with the zaniness of Sonic, Robotnik and pals.  
\-Cut Robotnik's joke about calling an Uber.  
\-Rescored part of the snowboarding sequence with Tee Lopes's remix of Ice Cap Zone from Sonic 3.  
\-Trimmed Rachel's indignant reactions to Tom's phone going off.  
\-As Tom realizes he's mixed up the rings, added a quick flashback to him teasing Jojo. This was necessary since the earlier scene was cut.  
\-Trimmed Rachel's ""Snow my God"" pun to just ""Oh my God"". I don't think every character needs to be a constant joke delivery machine.  
\-After Sonic and Tails get washed up in Hawaii, and Rachel says ""Oh Lord, there are two of them now"", cut to Knuckles and Robotnik finding the ruins. The entire sequence of Sonic and Tails getting captured by GUN and Maddie having to bust them out is removed, as is Randall's betrayal and Rachel's revenge on him. Used generative extend to aid in this transition.  
\-In the sequence where Maddie, Tom, and Sonic see a green beam appear in the sky, used a combination of cropping, speed ramping, cutting and generative extend to remove Command Walters tied up in the background. He doesn't appear until later in this edit. Also cut away from the scene early when Tails wakes up.  
\-In the following scene, cut away when Wade busts in and Agent Stone puts his hands up, removing some additional banter.  
\-When Knuckles punches through the wall in the ruins, trimmed Robotnik's joke about interior design. He now just says ""Wow, that really opened up the space"".  
\-Trimmed Robotnik telegraphing his betrayal of Knuckles, including the Limp Bizkit joke.  
\-Trimmed Robotnik's ""I think I just threw up in my mouth"" reaction to Sonic's earnest speech. This movie has a habit of undercutting nearly every earnest moment with a joke.  
\-Removed Robotnik's pun about Sonic ""losing the quill to live.""  
\-Removed Robotnik calling Knuckles a ""dimwitted celestial skintag""  
\-As Sonic almost drowns, added a rendition of the classic Sonic drowning music from Sonic Generations.  
\-Trimmed Wade and Agent Stone's banter about the ""prop bagel.""  
\-Cut Robotnik using the Emerald's power to make autotune music.  
\-Cut Robotnik and Wade's ""snack plate"" exchange.  
\-When Commander Walter exits the chopper, added a brief flashback from his appearance in Sonic 1 to reorient the audience (since his earlier scenes were cut).  
\-Cut commentary from the GUN soldier about Wade's incompetence as a police officer.  
\-Rescored some of Sonic Team's encounter with Robotnik's mech with the Death Egg Robot's Boss Battle theme from Sonic Generations.  
\-Rescored Sonic Team working together to defeat the robots with an instrumental version of the Sonic Heroes theme by Crush 40 (instrumental version by ""CG Instrumentals"" on YouTube"".)  
\-Added a short version of ""All Hail Shadow"" by Crush 40 after Shadow is revealed in the post-credits scene.  
\-Added the full vocal version of ""Sonic Heroes"" by Crush 40 to the credits.",1,1756946747.0,fanedits,0,1.0,False
1n7w578,https://www.reddit.com/r/1800Drama/comments/1n7w578/aitd_for_telling_someone_who_is_very_important_to/,"AITD for telling someone who is very important to me that two of my really good friends (who are also close to her) feel deeply hurt because of her, without basically any reason? [this is a long story, sorry]","So, I (24F) am in quite an interesting situation as I both study and work (as an administrator) at the same department at a university. I have a rather close relationship with one of the professors (let's call her Eve), and I have a group of friends who also study there and are also somewhat close to her, though not as close as me. We even had a little get-together at Eve’s place before Christmas, that was mainly possible because I was very keen on doing that. (Jack, one of this story's protagonists, wasn't actually there, because he thought something with this event was ""off"".)

Last year, we had a class where we were all involved in a project that was mentored by Eve, which we all enjoyed a lot. This year, Eve was looking for participants again for this project, but due to practical reasons the group had to be a lot smaller and also we don’t have a class dedicated to the project now, so it is overall a lot harder to organize. This is why Eve decided to “handpick” certain people to the group (as opposed to last year, when anyone could take the class) and she asked me casually who I thought would want to/be able to join this year. I said Jack straight away (a friend who was a very important member of last year’s group) but then I immediately added that he was *very* busy, and we also mentioned that he was doing his final exam in two months. Anyway, Eve said that she would ask last year’s group, but then she would still have the final word.

Three days later Eve had already had her group in mind, without asking last year’s guys. Even then I thought that she would at least tell those who are not in it that we are doing this again, but she never did that, so they finally found out through us.

To my surprise and regret, Jack was left out in the end, and he was very disappointed and hurt by this. He said that he now hated Eve and was convinced that Eve hadn’t chosen him because for some reason she hated him as well. I tried to explain to him what happened and that I might actually be, at least partly, responsible for it because I was the one who said how busy he was. He refused to consider this and stubbornly sticked to the idea that Eve did this for some personal reason, which was completely unfounded on his part. This frustrated and saddened me a lot, because I knew that Eve in fact liked Jack very much and would’ve most likely wanted him to be part of the group if it wasn’t for him being busy. I tried to convince Jack that even though he has every right to be hurt, it was not anyone’s intention to hurt him, but he only repeated that I wasn’t responsible for any of this and Eve was.

A few weeks later I had a class with Eve where we talked about different ways to structure a thesis. There were three of them mentioned in a text (none of which was perfect, all had pros and cons to them), and Eve gave Sarah’s (also a friend) thesis as an example of one. She didn’t say anything bad about it, and she only mentioned Sarah because some of us in the class knew her. After this, Jack told me that Ben (another member of the friend group who was there) mentioned this to him, but in such a way that suggested that Eve was basically talking shit about Sarah’s thesis behind her back. Not only is Eve Sarah’s advisor, but I also think after me the second closest to Eve in our friend group is Sarah. Both theirs and ours are very much trusting relationships.

When I heard about Ben’s allegation from Jack, I wanted to reassure Sarah this was not at all what really happened, because I didn’t want her to be disappointed with Eve (and also because her self-esteem is already low enough). I asked her what this nonsense was all about, believing that she would already know about it from Ben (since he was apparently telling people), but it turned out that Sarah hadn’t heard anything before I mentioned it to her. She told me she would ask Ben – I told her that there was no need for that, because I had heard Eve too and what he says happened is not true.

Just as with Jack, all my efforts to convince Sarah were totally unsuccessful. After she talked to Ben, she chose to believe him, not me, because “I’m biased when it comes to Eve”. I couldn’t (and didn’t want to) believe that the same nonsense was happening as with Jack: Sarah, completely disillusioned with Eve, thought that she humiliated her in front of us and practically stabbed her in the back. Even though she wouldn’t really admit it, I think Sarah was totally destroyed by this false belief, and so was her relationship with Eve.

I tried talking to both Sarah and Jack several times, but nothing seemed to help. I hated to see that what their once super relationships with Eve turned into, based on something that was utter nonsense in both cases. (At least Jack’s hurt was understandable; Sarah’s, however, honestly made me quite angry.)

Fast forward to another few weeks later, I was having lunch with Eve and another professor when Eve mentioned something about people talking shit about others behind their backs. I was playing with the idea of telling Eve about everything for some time by then, but I might not have done so if she didn’t bring up this topic; this was an unwanted trigger on an already stressful day. (Of course I’m not blaming any of this on her.) I said something like “yeah, just like how Jack and Sarah say that they “hate” you because they are convinced that you “hate” them”.

After this, when we were left alone and could finally grab a coffee and sit down, I had had to tell her; she wanted to know. I’m not exaggerating when I’m saying that Eve is one of the most important people in my life, and both Jack and Sarah are my friends, so I don’t think it’s a surprise that I want their conflicts to be resolved. However, I wasn’t “authorized” to turn to Eve on their behalf (even though I meant nothing but good), and of course I had to know that sharing these would most likely hurt Eve a lot. But in that moment I felt trapped enough to tell Eve.

Well, the story ended well: Eve told me she would talk to both Sarah and Jack (in person) and left it up to me to decide if I wanted to tell them about what I “did” before she approached them. I chose to do so because I felt that was the better, more correct decision after all this, because I needed to own up to my actions. When I told them, Sarah and Jack said that they weren’t mad at me. And then they actually managed to talk everything through and make it up with Eve.

However, I have to say I was not wrong about the stories hurting Eve: she even cried a little because of all these (well, she clearly had other thing going on as well), and especially because of Sarah, since she couldn’t fathom how Sarah could ever believe that she would ever do that to her. She wasn’t so upset about Jack, because they were never *that* close.

I was really worried what me telling Eve would do to our relationship, because at first, she wished I didn’t tell her. But she said she understood why I did it, even though she added that she wouldn’t encourage me to tell everyone about everything, even if I have good intentions.

I’m almost a hundred percent sure that I was somewhat of an asshole in all of this, because the end does not justify the means. But how big of an asshole was I?",1,1756946727.0,1800Drama,0,1.0,False

It’s gotten serious in the sense that we’ve told each other that we are in love, but nothing more than that. 

At first, it was really amazing. He’s the sweetest guy and truly caring. He always pays for dates and makes sure I walk on the inside, away from the road. He always knows how to make me laugh. He’ll make me coffee in the morning, and let me rot on my phone when needed. During movies, I’ll fall asleep, but he’ll still continue to watch the movie and pretend I’m awake. I really admire him and love him for who he is. I don’t want to go into too much detail about his personal life, but he’s very caring for those around him. 

Recently, he’s started to get distant. He used to call every night to check in, but now I can barely get a text. I went on vacation for a family celebration, and I sent him a picture of me in my dress. There was no mention of calling me pretty. I ended up getting drunk that night and, rather emotionally, asked why he couldn’t not call me pretty. There was never a resolution. Later on that trip, I sent him a picture in my swim suit. Nothing too scandalous, but still, I wanted a compliment after our brief conversation about wanting to feel validated. He replied with a one word response. 

It’s been over a month since I’ve seen him in person (conflicting schedules). I feel like I’m at my end with the relationship. I know it wasn’t long, but the feelings are real. I feel guilty ending it, because he might be going through something but not communicating with me. At the same time, I want to feel wanted and loved, and I’m not feeling that currently.

How can I talk to him in a way that gives us clarity?","Problem/Goal: My boyfriend says he feels choked, doesn’t want the responsibility of a relationship, and thinks he might have outgrown me. Our cycle has been no contact then reconciliation, and I want advice on how to talk to him in person para malinawan kung saan ba talaga papunta ‘to.

I’m 22M and my boyfriend is 21M. We’ve been together for 2 years. He’s my first boyfriend, and this relationship is very meaningful to me. But it hasn’t been stable. Around our third month of getting to know each other, I made a mistake. I had a conversation with a friend about maybe going out for coffee, pero hindi talaga natuloy. The issue is that he was never comfortable with that friend, and to him, it already felt like betrayal. After that, we went through several on-and-off phases before he forgave me.

Fast forward, he went no contact with me again for 3 months. Eventually, we reconciled and have now been dating again for 4 months. But recently, he told me he doesn’t want a boyfriend anymore and that relationships feel shackling to him. He said he feels choked kasi there are things he cannot freely do if he has a boyfriend, and that he doesn’t like the responsibility that comes with it. He also said again that he might have outgrown me, which has been one of the frequent reasons he gives whenever he pulls away.

At the same time, he tells me na he still loves me and appreciates how I treat him, and how sweet and kind I am to him. Pero he also admitted that he’s not as attracted to me anymore. He even said I’m more of a “golden retriever” type while he’s drawn to “doberman” type guys. That was hard to hear, but I told him I’m working on myself too, since I’m naturally skinny and trying to improve my build. He also told me that I deserve better than what he can give me right now. When I asked him what he really wants, he said he isn’t sure yet.

We’re in a long-distance relationship, just a couple of cities apart, and we plan to talk about this in person soon. I’ve noticed this has become a recurring pattern with him: he goes no contact for months, comes back to rekindle things, then eventually says the same things again tas no contact ulit. A part of me wonders if this is just another phase and he’ll reach out again later, pero I’m also scared na I’m just stuck in a loop that will keep repeating.

I want to keep this relationship, but I also do not want to trap either of us in a loop that goes nowhere.",1,1756946226.0,adviceph,1,1.0,False
1n7vxiv,https://www.reddit.com/r/hyatt/comments/1n7vxiv/review_hotel_x_toronto_destination_by_hyatt/,Review: Hotel X Toronto (Destination by Hyatt),"Normally I don't ""review"" places until the end of the year, but not that much is out there about this property, so here goes...

**Stay Dates:** 8/29-9/2

**Impressions:** Definitely an isolated location for being a hotel in Toronto.  It's convenient to Billy Bishop airport (YTZ), but closeness doesn't necessarily equal ease of access.  I stayed during the final days of the Canadian National Exhibition, and the real reason I visited Toronto was for the Canadian International Air Show.  It's technically walkable from Billy Bishop and the Exhibition GO train stop, but it'd definitely be a hike with baggage and/or kids.  You also need to procure a PRESTO pass from somewhere to access the streetcar stop at Strachan Avenue - that's a good way to get you to the ""flagship"" Loblaws/Shoppers Drug Mart to get snacks and supplies.  This location rather desperately needs a 24h ""Market"" space - the closest thing they have is ""Cafe X,"" which is only open from 7am-1pm and is the only ""cheap(er)"" on-site option for non-Globalists breakfast/coffee-wise.

The first issue was that I checked in on the WoH app and was happy to see that I'd been upgraded to a 1BR ""Premium"" Suite.  But when I arrived at the property, I was instead given a 1BR non-""Premium"" suite and told that ""they aren't linked up with the WoH app.""  The difference between the rooms is that ""Premium"" rooms are on the higher floors.  They either could not or would not honor what the app had already told me what I was going to get (always take a screenshot if you check in on the app, especially if you're pre-upgraded).

Also, for having so many elevators...they're probably the slowest-to-arrive I've experienced in a high-rise Hyatt in quite some time.  On several occasions there was actually a small *line* to get onto them.

Still, I can't quibble too much given that this was my view (despite asking for a lakeview room):

[View from the 10th Floor \(City View Room\)](https://preview.redd.it/7ffrziszh1nf1.jpg?width=4032&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=8eafdc4e31094d463238f1e04c5cabca6d78fb09)

The room itself was rather well-appointed, with a half-bath in the living room area and a full bath with a soaking tub in the bedroom area.  I would advise bringing earplugs with you, as even though the room is quiet in the wee hours of the night, the hotel is very near the Gardiner Expressway, and there are plenty of redlined cars racing up and down it at night.  Earplugs were especially important during my stay as the room I was given was on the side of the hotel which faced the CNE and they blasted music until about midnight every night of it.  Sirens from far away were also very audible even when the music stopped - the windows are not very well soundproofed.  The blinds/curtains also have quite a lot of light spillage in the mornings as well, it's impossible to completely black out the bedroom.

A nice touch is that there's a master on/off light switch next to the bed, but that becomes a liability if you're not alone because it also controls the lights in the master bathroom, so if you have to get up in the middle of the night, you're going to turn on the overhead light in the master bedroom and possibly wake up your significant other - but here's the real inconvenience - the master on/off switch will lock out the lighting in the master bath if it's not toggled.  The doors to both bathrooms are also pneumatic and take a pretty good amount of force to open - it might be too heavy for a small child or someone with physical disabilities.

The hotel has two house cars (both Teslas - one Model 3 and a Model Y).  But you need to arrange them well in advance or you can just assume they'll be booked if/when you need them.  They'll take you about as far as Union Station (5km max trip).  The drivers were friendly and professional.

**Breakfast:** Okay, so here's where things get a little iffy.  Everyone gave the Rio shit when they gave Globalists a \~limited menu\~.  Well, the Hotel X does the same thing:

[The \\""Globalist Menu\\""](https://preview.redd.it/7f0nc7nqj1nf1.jpg?width=2268&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=a16a4601a266b355a7e6e32278784da5e33f3ab3)

The restaurant that serves breakfast (Rose's Social) has a ""Brunch"" menu with a wider selection.  My first morning I initially was going to order the Steak and Eggs until my server (and clearly the manager on duty at the time) pointed out that the Globalist portion only had *4oz* of steak to the menu's 8oz.  I ordered the Huevos Rancheros instead, the Proper Breakfast the next two days, and the Southern Benny on my departure date.  Everything was okay, but the ""restrictions"" left a bit of a sour taste in my mouth.

Every ""bill"" showed $40, and I got the impression from my first day that the staff hadn't encountered many Globalists.

I also ate dinner at Rose's Social three out of the four nights simply because getting into the city during the CNE was a minor nightmare with traffic and the streetcars being packed to bursting.  The Beef Dip Sandwich was pretty decent and filling.

Checkout was swift and problem-free, which is nice since I used a Points + Cash rate to keep the cost down on this little sojourn and I've had issues recently where properties have erroneously put an extra charge on the bill for that which shouldn't be there (always ask for a printout).

Long story short...even though I was able to walk to the air show I wanted to see, I probably should've stayed at the Regency instead.  I didn't want to break the bank, which is why I didn't stay at the Park Hyatt.",3,1756946127.0,hyatt,0,1.0,False

We all go through tough times, and sometimes just having someone to talk to makes things feel lighter. I’m building a small space where people can connect and support each other. Volunteers can sign up and share their messenger links, and anyone who needs a listening ear can reach out for a chat or a call. If they’d like, people can thank volunteers with a small donation through *Buy Me a Coffee* , but support will always be free. Right now we’re looking for kind people who’d like to offer support through messaging apps. If you’re curious or just want more info, feel free to message me. The idea is to make this service available worldwide, connecting people based on languages and using messengers like Telegram, Signal, and Snapchat.

1n7vsah,https://www.reddit.com/r/KeyphoneTech/comments/1n7vsah/what_is_phone_addiction_symptoms_and_how_to_break/,What is Phone Addiction: Symptoms and How to Break it,"The **average person spends between 4 to 7 hours per day on their phone**, with some surveys reporting over 205 interactions with their device daily. Younger generations, especially Gen Z, lead the charts, with more than **50% admitting they feel a phone addiction**. This growing reliance is reshaping attention spans, relationships, and even mental health on a global scale.

In this guide, we’ll take a closer look at **phone addiction**: what it is, what causes it, how to recognize the symptoms, and the effects it can have on your well-being. We’ll also explore practical strategies to help you regain balance, including techniques like digital detoxing, replacing screen time with healthier hobbies, and even switching to a dumbphone for a cleaner break from the endless scroll.

# What Is Phone Addiction?

Phone addiction is a form of behavioral **dependency where a person feels a compulsive need to use their mobile device**, often to the point where it interferes with their daily life, relationships, and well-being. While not yet officially classified as a clinical addiction in the DSM-5, many mental health experts recognize it as a growing behavioral concern similar to gambling or internet addiction.

# Key Characteristics of Phone Addiction

* **Compulsive checking:** Reaching for your phone repeatedly, even without notifications or a specific reason.
* **Anxiety when separated:** Feeling uneasy, restless, or stressed when your phone isn’t nearby (sometimes called *nomophobia*).
* **Loss of control:** Struggling to set boundaries around phone use, leading to excessive screen time.
* **Interference with daily life:** Missing out on real-world interactions, sleep, or work productivity due to constant phone use.

Smartphones are designed to be highly engaging, using **variable rewards, push notifications, and algorithm-driven content** that taps into the brain’s dopamine pathways. This design makes them more than just tools—they become habit-forming devices that many struggle to put down, even when they want to.

Understanding phone addiction is the first step to tackling it. In the next sections, we’ll explore **how widespread the issue is**, the **symptoms to watch out for**, and the **mental and physical consequences** of excessive smartphone use.

# The Scope of the Problem: Phone Addiction in Numbers

Phone addiction is a global phenomenon. As smartphones have become central to modern life, screen time and digital dependency have skyrocketed across all age groups, raising alarms among health professionals and researchers.

# Rising Screen Time Worldwide

Recent studies show that the **average person spends between 4 and 7 hours per day on their smartphone**. According to research compiled by [Addiction Center](https://www.addictioncenter.com/behavioral-addictions/phone-addiction/):

* **66% of the global population** shows signs of nomophobia: the fear of being without a phone.
* **71% of people** admit to checking their phone within the first 10 minutes of waking up.
* **47% of parents** believe they or their children are spending too much time on mobile devices.

Younger generations are particularly affected, and **over 50% of Gen Z users** feel addicted to their phones, often spending **6+ hours per day** scrolling social media or gaming.

# A Widespread Behavioral Issue

The problem isn’t limited to one country or culture:

* A 2023 study published in [PMC](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11479953/) found **prevalence rates of problematic smartphone use ranging from 10% to over 30%** among adolescents and young adults globally.
* In the U.S., **up to 60% of college students** report signs of excessive smartphone use interfering with sleep, academics, or social life.
* Worldwide, **over 3.2 billion people** now use smartphones daily, making phone addiction a truly global challenge.

# Effects and Consequences of Phone Addiction



Phone addiction has tangible impacts on mental, cognitive, physical, and social well-being. Research increasingly links excessive smartphone use to a range of negative outcomes, some of which mirror the effects of other behavioral addictions.

# Mental Health Impacts

Studies suggest a strong association between high smartphone use and mental health issues, particularly **anxiety,** [**FOMO**](https://keyphone.tech/latest-news/fomo-and-smartphone-addiction/)**, and increased feelings of loneliness**.

* A [2023 review published in PMC](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11479953/) found that problematic phone use is correlated with **higher levels of stress and depressive symptoms**, especially in adolescents and young adults.
* Despite constant connectivity, many heavy users report feeling **isolated and emotionally disconnected**, highlighting the paradox of digital communication: being online doesn’t always mean feeling close to others.

Prolonged phone use can also lead to **nomophobia**, the anxiety experienced when separated from a device, further reinforcing dependency and emotional distress.

# Cognitive Impact

Phone addiction affects **attention, memory, and overall productivity**. According to a [study referenced by HelpGuide](https://www.helpguide.org/mental-health/addiction/smartphone-addiction), frequent phone interruptions:

* Impair short-term memory formation due to constant context-switching.
* Reduce focus, making it harder to complete complex tasks or engage in deep work.
* Promote “continuous partial attention,” where you’re never fully present in any activity.

Over time, this can erode your ability to concentrate, learn new information effectively, and manage time efficiently.

# Physical Health Effects

Excessive phone use isn’t just a mental strain, it takes a **physical toll** on the body:

* **Poor sleep quality:** Blue light exposure and late-night scrolling disrupt melatonin production, delaying sleep onset and reducing deep sleep stages ([Sleep Foundation, 2023](https://www.sleepfoundation.org/bedroom-environment/blue-light)).
* **Text neck & posture problems:** Constantly bending toward a screen adds stress to the spine, causing chronic neck and back pain.
* **Eye strain & headaches:** Prolonged exposure to small, bright screens can lead to dry eyes, blurred vision, and tension headaches. This condition is sometimes called **digital eye strain**.

# Social Consequences

Ironically, smartphones often **diminish real-world social connections** despite being designed to connect us:

* Face-to-face interactions suffer as phones compete for attention during conversations.
* Relationships can be strained by perceived inattention or phone-based distractions.
* Over-reliance on digital validation (likes, comments) can reduce empathy and increase social anxiety.

A growing body of research highlights how constant phone use reshapes social dynamics, leading to **shallower connections and reduced emotional presence**.

Understanding these consequences is crucial. They illustrate that **phone addiction isn’t a minor inconvenience,** it’s a behavior that can affect almost every area of life, from mental health to relationships. The good news is that change is possible, and small, intentional steps can help you break free.

# Symptoms of Phone Addiction

**Phone addiction** isn’t always easy to spot. Because smartphones are so embedded in daily life, excessive use can feel normal—even when it’s harmful. Recognizing the symptoms is the first step toward breaking free.

# Behavioral Signs

* **Compulsive checking:** Reaching for your phone every few minutes, even without notifications or a clear reason.
* **Phantom vibrations:** Feeling like your phone is buzzing or ringing when it’s not is a sign of hyper-alertness to phone cues.
* **Anxiety when separated:** Feeling restless, stressed, or irritable when your phone isn’t nearby (known as *nomophobia*).
* **Loss of time:** Picking up your phone for “just a minute” and losing track of hours scrolling or hopping between apps.

These behaviors often signal that phone use is no longer intentional but driven by habit and compulsion.

# Physical Symptoms

Excessive phone use can manifest in **physical discomfort** over time:

* **Eye strain and headaches:** Caused by prolonged screen exposure, especially in low light.
* **Poor posture and “text neck”:** Holding your phone at a downward angle for long periods strains your neck, shoulders, and back.
* **Sleep disruption:** Late-night scrolling delays bedtime and reduces sleep quality due to blue light exposure and mental stimulation.

If you regularly feel tired, achy, or experience discomfort linked to phone use, it’s a sign the habit is impacting your physical health.

# Emotional Symptoms

Phone addiction impacts also the mood and mental well-being:

* **Irritability:** Feeling frustrated or anxious when you can’t check your phone or lose access to it.
* **Low attention span:** Struggling to stay focused on tasks without picking up your phone or multitasking.
* **Dependence on constant stimulation:** Boredom or unease when you’re offline, craving notifications or updates to feel engaged.

These symptoms often indicate that the phone is being used as a coping mechanism for boredom, stress, or emotional discomfort.

# How to Break Free from Phone Addiction

Breaking free from phone addiction doesn’t mean throwing your device away—it means **reclaiming control over your time and attention**. Here are two proven strategies that can help you start creating a healthier relationship with your phone.

# Digital Detox: Planned Breaks and Screen Time Limits



A **digital detox** is a deliberate period of time when you reduce or completely cut off non-essential phone use. The goal isn’t to punish yourself—it’s to reset your habits and teach your brain to live without constant digital stimulation.

**How to start:**

* **Set intentional boundaries:** Designate phone-free times during the day (for example, the first hour after waking up and the last hour before bed).
* **Use built-in tools:** Most smartphones have screen time reports and limit settings. Start by setting a maximum daily usage for social media or entertainment apps.
* **Create physical distance:** Keep your phone in another room during meals, work, or quality time with loved ones. Out of sight often means out of mind.
* **Try a full detox day:** Choose one day per week (like Sunday) to stay offline except for essential calls or texts. Over time, this will reduce the “automatic checking” reflex.

**Why it works:**  
Excessive phone use conditions your brain to crave instant stimulation. Taking planned breaks lowers your dependency, allowing you to regain focus and experience life offline. Research cited by [HelpGuide](https://www.helpguide.org/mental-health/addiction/smartphone-addiction) shows that even short detox periods can improve mood, sleep quality, and overall well-being.

# Replace with Hobbies: Rediscover Offline Joy

One of the hardest parts of cutting back on phone use is **boredom**. We often reach for our phones when there’s nothing else to do—or when we’re avoiding stress or uncomfortable emotions. The key isn’t just to stop scrolling, but to **fill that time with meaningful alternatives**.

**Ideas to try:**

* **Physical activities:** Sports, yoga, running, or even daily walks. Movement helps break the cycle of sedentary phone use and releases mood-boosting endorphins.
* **Creative outlets:** Drawing, writing, painting, or crafting can replace the quick dopamine hits of scrolling with deeper, more satisfying engagement.
* **Social connections:** Organize in-person meetups or phone-free coffee dates to rebuild real-world bonds.
* **Outdoor time:** Nature has been shown to reduce stress and improve focus—both antidotes to phone-induced mental fatigue.

>

**Why it works:**  
Simply cutting screen time creates a void, which often leads back to old habits. By consciously replacing scrolling with enriching activities, you rewire your brain to seek satisfaction offline. Over time, this makes phone-free moments something you look forward to—not something you fear.

# Switch to a Dumbphone: Regain Control with a Distraction-Free Device

Sometimes the best way to break free from phone addiction is to **remove the temptations altogether**. [Dumbphones](https://keyphone.tech/latest-news/what-is-a-dumbphone/)—basic phones designed without social media apps, endless notifications, or algorithmic feeds—help you keep the essentials (calls, texts, maybe music or maps) while cutting off everything that fuels compulsive use.

**Why it works:**  
Smartphones are engineered to hold your attention. A dumbphone removes those hooks, making it easier to **stay present, focus on real life, and create intentional tech habits**. With no infinite scroll, autoplay videos, or dopamine-driven notifications, you’re in charge—not your phone.

Modern dumbphones, like [Keyphone](https://keyphone.tech/), Light Phone III, and Punkt MP02, are built specifically for this purpose. They:

* Support basic communication and productivity tools.
* Offer long battery life and durable designs.
* Provide digital well-being benefits without forcing you to go completely offline.

>

# 4. Use Apps and Tools: Track and Limit Your Screen Time

If you’re not ready to give up your smartphone entirely, technology can also help you set boundaries. **Screen time management apps and website blockers** create friction between you and your digital triggers, making it easier to avoid mindless scrolling.

**Examples of tools:**

* **Built-in screen time features** on iOS and Android for tracking usage and setting daily limits.
* **Freedom** or **StayFocusd** to block distracting websites and apps during focus hours.
* **Forest** or **Flipd**, which gamify staying offline and reward you for putting your phone down.

**Why it works:**  
Research shows that **simply becoming aware of your screen time** can lead to reduced usage. These tools create a mindful pause before opening a distracting app, giving you the choice to stop before falling into the scroll trap. Over time, these pauses build new, healthier habits.

>

# When to Seek Professional Help

While many people can reduce their phone dependency with self-help strategies, for others, excessive phone use may be linked to **underlying mental health concerns** such as anxiety, depression, or ADHD. If your smartphone use is:

* Interfering with work, school, or relationships,
* Causing significant emotional distress,
* Or feels impossible to control despite repeated attempts,

it might be time to reach out to a mental health professional. Therapists trained in **behavioral addictions** can help you set boundaries, build healthier coping mechanisms, and regain balance in your digital life.

# Conclusion: Taking Back Control of Your Time

**Phone addiction is one of the defining challenges** of our hyperconnected world. What started as a tool to simplify life now often dominates our time, attention, and even emotions. But it doesn’t have to stay that way.

By understanding the causes, symptoms, and consequences of phone addiction, you can reshape your relationship with technology.

Smartphones aren’t inherently bad, but they’re designed to keep you hooked. **The power to change that dynamic is in your hands**. Small, consistent steps can free up hours of your day, improve focus, strengthen relationships, and give you back the space to live fully—away from the screen.",1,1756945715.0,KeyphoneTech,0,1.0,False

# Notes:

""What do you mean your sister isn't here again?!"" Mammon said, towering over Glitz who just shrugged her shoulders. 'Great, if I had known that I would have just stayed home. I guess both me and Queenie are having a shitty fucking day.' Mammon thought to himself as he walked away. ""Fine then you can do all of the meets and greets yourself."" Mammon said, noticing a small imp tail heading towards him.

""So I'm being punished for my sister?"" Glitz said, as Mammon turned back to her.

""Well I sure as fuck can't punish her since Glam that little cunt isn't here. Now go do what you do best whine like a little brat and go sell yourself."" Mammon said, waving Glitz off as he went to walk away.

""We can always have some fun..."" Glitz said, jumping onto Mammon's shoulder making sure her breast touched his face.

Mammon quickly pulled Glitz off rather harsher than he meant to. ""No thank you, if you want to make money by being a whore. Then I'd recommend you go and find a pimp, I don't like people who open their legs instead of doing their jobs."" Mammon said, getting his face really close to Glitz's. ""I prefer hard workers, the next time you or your sister offer yourselves up to me like this. I will fire both of you in a heart beat..."" Mammon said, placing Glitz down on the floor.

Glitz looked at Mammon and she actually cowered as she walked away. Mammon looked to see Rose standing in front of him with a bag and his mug. Mammon then let out a heavy sigh, he gently took the bag and coffee mug. Mammon's lower hands pulled out fifty dollars and lightly rubbed Rose's head.

""Sorry you had to see that..."" Mammon said, drinking the coffee.

""That's alright...I kinda miss Fizz."" Rose said, pulling out a Fizz figurine.

""I hear ya..."" Mammon said, staring at the small figurine.

""Why did you fire...or why did he leave?"" Rose asked, watching Mammon.

""Because if I hadn't he would have killed himself trying to be the impossible, perfect."" Mammon said. ""The fact that he left instead of me firing him just means that I did what I had to. You'd better head back Queenie and your ma are probably getting worried.""

Rose wanted to ask more, but thought better of it. As Rose turned to leave she waved to Mammon and he waved back. Mammon then rolled his head back and forth making his neck cracked and popped. Mammon knew Rose wasn't stupid hell she was probably the smartest kid never mind imp he actually knew. After all that was why Mammon usually had Rose run errands. The kid was tiny, but she could easily take care of herself. And Mammon would pay little Rose for every errand she would run for him and Queenie. The pay depended on the errand, the most Mammon paid her for one errand was a little over five hundred dollars. And that was because Fizz had disappeared into thin air it wasn't till Rose came back. That Mammon found out Fizz had been taken, needless to say he was more than a little angry. Not just because of the money Fizz brought in or rather use to bring in. But because Mammon knew what losing Fizz would have done to Ozzie. Even after what had happened between them Mammon still worried about him. But of course he would Mammon had once thought of Asmodeus as a brother and his best friend. Which is what made what happened hurt so much worse than it should have.

Mammon at this point had become a master of faking it all of it. Faking being understanding, trust, years of faking being okay, faking the fun and energy to the point where he felt so tired. Not that anyone actually cared, Mammon hadn't thought about how much faking he had actually done till Queenie. All the piss poor excuses to not go out and interact with people. All the food he ate just to bury his feelings. Then Mammon saw it an old Fizzarolli poster hanging on the wall. Mammon started to make a small ball of lightning in his hand. Mammon brought his hand up and shot the ball at the poster. Mammon watched the poster burn for sometime before putting a small shield around it. Mammon then watched as the fire slowly went out before walking away.

""That reminds me, I should really send Blitzo a thank you gift, actually I think I'll send two. One for protecting Fizz and one for burning down Loo Loo Land. After all I gave it to Cash as a trade for Fizz and the others. But of course he never did tell his kids or the others about the deal. Not that it really matters, the place had been losing money for a while. I had built it just to get Lucifer's attention in the first place. At least Blitzo has a good job...but I wonder what became of Barbie? Well it's none of my business anymore at least Blitz still has his head after everything."" Mammon said, walking to his office. ""Maybe I'll pay some of their bills...""

Once Mammon was in his office he sat down behind a very large willow wood desk. Next to and on it were mountains of papers, Mammon pulled out a small device that had two goldish colored handles and a bright green screen. Mammon held it up to the nearest pile of papers as a green light scanned the pile. On the screen was then filled with receipts and calculations of how much money was coming in and out. Calculations Mammon had already done in his head, using the small device was just away to double check his math. Which was always correct that was one of the differences between him and Ozzie.

Queenie, Leviathan and Belphegor had been talking when Rose came back. Rose was still holding the small figurine, Queenie then got up from her chair. As Queenie made her way to Rose, Rose quickly put the figurine in her pocket. Queenie then pulled out a plate from under a large bowl and took it to the table.

""Here you go Rose, sit down and enjoy a nice hot breakfast."" Queenie said, picking Rose up and placed her at the table.

""I can't mom said I have to clean Mr. Mammon's room."" Rose said, as her stomach growled.

""I'll do it after I see Miss Leviathan and Miss Belphegor out."" Queenie said, as the two sins started out.

""Okay, but some of Mr. Mammon's pills are on the floor. I hope he'll be okay..."" Rose said, eating the food.

Queenie looked at Leviathan, the two heads looked just as confused as she was. Belphegor let out a very tiny almost drowsy sounding sigh as she started to gently pull them out of the room. Once they got to the door the three of them stepped outside.

Queenie looked at Belphegor as did Leviathan. ""Pills?"" They asked together.

""I really shouldn't tell anyone, but they're for his bipolar disorder."" Belphegor said, before leaving.

Athan looked at Queenie with worry heavy on her face. ""Did you???""

""No...I thought something was off, but..."" Queenie said, as her voice caught in her throat.

Leviathan hugged Queenie. ""Look after him please."" Levi said, as they disappeared into a torrent of water.

Once Leviathan had left Queenie went back inside and went to Mammon's room. When Queenie turned on the lights she was surprised by the almost sad pale green walls and black marble floor. The walls had hundreds of burn marks that looked like a strange spider web. The floor had four massive holes made from fist hitting I. It didn't take Queenie long to find the bottle and all the pills. Queenie sat down on Mammon's bed, it was soft but also surprisingly firm. And Queenie's mind went to the day she had woke up in it. The sin of Greed didn't seem to care about the blood that had covered the bed and sheets. Queenie remembered how gently Mammon had touched her that day. How Mammon had touched her back earlier about how much she had missed just being touched.

""Stop..."" Queenie then noticed all the posters. ""Wow, there are a lot of posters..."" Queenie said, standing up from the massive bed.

As Queenie looked at the posters she noticed a few things about them. Many of the older ones had the same imp down in front of the stage. Mammon was always happy, but then Queenie noticed that later on the imp had stopped showing up. And when she did her mind seemed to be elsewhere. Then she was gone all together and Mammon looked like he was in pain. And other performers started to appear more and more while Mammon seemed to almost disappear all together. And when Mammon did show it was with fake joy, energy and to top it off a fake smile. The smile reminded Queenie of a dear friend that had disappeared for seven years. Alastor, the two weren't all that different both hid behind a smile and jokes. The last Queenie heard Alastor was now living and working at the Hazbin Hotel. And according to rumors he was now dating Lucifer of all people.

""But at least Al is finally happy, I hope he's okay after that attack on the hotel."" Queenie said, as she looked at the posters again.

Queenie then noticed Asmodeus in the earlier posters cheering Mammon on. But then he stopped showing up about the same time as the imp had stopped. Queenie's heart sank, a pitcher was forming in her mind. It oddly reminded Queenie of the whole Alastor, Vox and Valentino thing. Queenie noticed the light fading from Mammon's eyes just like it had for Alastor. Like it had for her own, Queenie looked up to the ceiling parts of it were missing.

Once Queenie was done in Mammon's room Queenie decided to wander around the area near by the mansion. It was so so that if Queenie was attacked she could easily run back into the grounds. Pretty early in Queenie had noticed that not too many creatures dared to enter Mammon's turf. Mammon's home was in the heart of the Greed ring and was miles from other homes or buildings. Which Queenie honestly liked, Hell especially Greed was a nice change from Earth for Queenie.

Hours later Queenie returned just as Mammon had come home. She could tell that Mammon had had a long day it was practically written all over his face. Mammon quickly took off his coat and tie, Queenie knew what that meant. Queenie went to ask if he was alright, but was stopped by the sound of the door bell. They both took out their phones and when Mammon saw Asmodeus through the camera. He had let out an anger filled growl as the hand holding his phone started to shake violently. Queenie walked over to Mammon and took his phone as her lower hand took his.

""I'll go and see if I can get him to leave..."" Queenie said, as Mammon's hand surprisingly gently squeezed hers.

""Thank you, but he won't leave..."" Mammon said, closing his eyes.

""I can still try..."" Queenie said, almost surprised by the softness in her own voice.

Mammon nodded. ""I'll be in my office...""

Queenie waited for Mammon to leave before turning her attention to the door. Once there Queenie tried to forget what she had just figured out through the posters. But it all played in her mind in a loop, Queenie opened the door and leaned against the frame.

""Oh um, who are you?"" Ozzie asked, staring at Queenie.

""I'm the one woman in Hell who isn't impressed by the sin of Lust. If I was you I would go back home to your latest imp toy. Mammon's not in the mood for visitors, especially ones that can't help but to think with their cock."" Queenie watched as Asmodeus wince. ""And besides why should I let in someone who's going to bully the big boy. Haven't you done enough to Mam...let me guess you loved her."" Queenie said, in a mocking tone. ""I guess Mammon thought more of you then you of him. You know the decent thing to do when you find out your partner is already taken. Is to tell them that you wouldn't do anything to hurt your friend no to your family."" Queenie said, feeling her heart racing and tiers lightly stinging her eyes.

""Look...I just wanted to check on him."" Ozzie said, holding up his hands .

""More like bully...you have a lot of nerve coming here. I'm not...""

""Let him in Queenie..."" Mammon said, through the speaker on the camera.

""Fine, but I'm staying nearby..."" Queenie said, stepping away from the door.

""Look I never meant..."" Ozzie started to say, but was stopped by Queenie.

""Oh fuck off, I'm not the one you should be apologizing to. Not that a cowered like you would ever really admit to doing anything wrong. Let me guess Ruby cheated on you too, so much for love. The all powerful sin of Lust being cheated on by the woman who he had cheated with. Can you say karma, I'll be going with Mammon to all the meetings and that from now on. You and that druggy Beelzebub have done enough emotional damage to him."" Queenie said, turning away from Asmodeus.

Asmodeus said nothing as he followed behind Queenie. Ozzie stared at the moth demon as his heart sat in his chest like a lead brick. In truth Asmodeus hadn't thought about Ruby in such a long time.

'Mammon can't possibly still be angry about...' Ozzie thought to himself as he continued to watch Queenie. 'Who am I kidding of course he is...Mam could always hold a grudge. But he said he was fine back then...wait did he.' A realization hit Ozzie in that moment. ""He lied to me..."" He said, out loud.

""Let me guess Mammon said 'You can have her I'm done...' A true performer can lie as well as they can put on a show."" Queenie said, imitating Mammon almost perfectly. ""Some of us hide our pain till it almost kills us."" Queenie said, looking down at her hand.

Once they were at Mammon's office Queenie knocked on the door. When Mammon didn't answer right away Queenie had started to worry.

""Come in..."" Mammon said, with a tone of annoyance.

After Queenie opened the door Asmodeus entered ducking down as he entered. As Ozzie entered his blue flames lit up the dark room, the blue light actually gave the room a depressing atmosphere. Asmodeus in an attempt to change the feel of the room turned up his light. It failed, the walls seemed to suck up the blue light making things worse. Ozzie then tried dimming his flames, this time it caused the room to feel cramped. Asmodeus felt very uneasy, Mammon was totally unfazed. Finally Mammon got tired of this little light show, he clapped and the lights came on. Queenie closed, but true to her word she stayed close by the door. And left it open a crack so she could look in. Queenie had never been someone to listen in on peoples conversations. But Queenie needed to hear, she needed to know.

""What's the matter Ozzie, you can't possibly be here for business."" Mammon said, removing his gloves very slowly.

""You know damn well why I'm here..."" Ozzie said, starting to sit down in the chair in front of Mammon.

Mammon quickly shot a bolt of lightning at the chair knocking it away from the desk. The bolt had sent the chair half away across the room. Asmodeus grabbed his wrist feeling as if he had just been cut by a knife. Ozzie looked at Mammon in shock, this wasn't the Mammon he knew since childhood. This Mammon was colder, darker Ozzie had never seen him like this before. Well except for when him and Ruby Storm had told Mammon that they had been seeing each other. Before that Asmodeus hadn't known that Ruby and Mammon were a couple. But Ozzie loved Ruby and didn't want to give her up.

Mammon sat forward placing his elbows on the desk. ""I never said you could sit down and as you can see I'm perfectly fine."" Mammon said, removing another glove. ""Not that you actually care after all true love is a powerful thing. I'm sure those two little love birds are working it all out as we speak. But what I'm sure your own relationship is doing fine...at least Fizzy knows what loyalty is."" Mammon said, starting to remove the last glove. ""But what do I know I'm just a ""Pissy nobody wants to fuck with a flaming pile of clown shit.' Now I'm not sure, but I have the faintness memory of...""

""Look Mammon..."" Asmodeus started to say, but stopped noticing the bottle of pills on the desk and the long scar on Mammon's hand. ""Mam, what?"" Ozzie said, not sure which question he wanted the answer to.

""Which what? The pills I take because I'm bipolar or this old scar from my first and last suicide attempt. I remember that day very well...it was the day I had been betrayed by the two people I trust and loved. I loved you like a brother, you of all people were my best friend. Ruby...I wanted to share my life with her I was going to give her forever. She was my heart..."" Mammon said, as tears filled his eyes.

Asmodeus started at Mammon as if it was the first time seeing him. The air in the room felt heavy, Mammon stood up and Queenie looked in. Lightning started to fill the room, Mammon didn't move but he was clearly shaking. Queenie felt her body getting warm and her heart was racing.

""Mam please, I'm...""

Four bolts of lightning shot towards Ozzie, but they quickly shot off in different directions just before they got to Ozzie. Asmodeus fell to the floor covering his face with his arms. Mammon started to laugh, it wasn't a good laugh. It was the laugh of someone who has nothing left, of a man who had held back his pain for too long. Mammon's laugh seemed to bounce off the walls making some things in the room shake.

""She was my fucking heart!""Mammon screamed, slamming all four of his fist into the desk breaking it in half. ""I've thought about that day so many times..."" Mammon said, his voice breaking. ""I loved both of you...did your heart break the same way mine had? When you found out Ruby had slept with Satan did your fucking heart break like mine did?"" Mammon asked, the static thick in the room. ""Of course it had that look on your stupid face says it all. Queenie...please show this worthless piece of shit out. Oh and I think it's very rude to make fun of asexuality...my sexuality."" Mammon said, watching Asmodeus stand very slowly. ""I had plans on coming out during Bee's first Pride Day party, but then she said ""Asexuality is an excuse that people can't get fucked use to make themselves feel better."" You stood there laughed and agreed, you are able to see peoples sexuality and yet. There I was an asexual and you didn't even see me.""

Asmodeus didn't say anything at first just stared at Mammon. Till finally it sunk in and he finally saw it a demi flag like shadow appeared around Mammon. Ozzie then watched as Mammon disappeared, Queenie grabbed Asmodeus by the sleeve of his coat.

""Please I..."" Asmodeus stopped seeing the almost bitter cold look on Queenie's face.

""You've done enough...if Mam really wanted to hurt you. He would have done it and most likely he wouldn't have lost any sleep over it. I would keep that in mind tonight when you're in bed with Fizz. Also not that I'm defending Mammon's behavior, but he is the reason you and Fizz met."" Queenie said, pulling Asmodeus out of the room. ""Mammon was the one who asked you to make Fizz's arms and legs right. He did that because part of him still wants to trust you. His robots look good enough, but they don't last as long as your robotics.""

""Wait Mam has...those two imps sitting next to him."" Ozzie said, holding back tears.

""Of course you never saw it, you've also been losing money. Because of the deal you two made, now that Fizz no longer works for him. Mammon can cut prices on the Fizz bots, but the money goes to him not you. Because you broke a clause when you two started dating, but never told him. It's a small and petty, but for him it's a win."" Queenie said, letting out a laugh. ""He knew the moment you asked if Fizz could work for you.""

Asmodeus couldn't look at Queenie, it actually hurt to. Queenie's straight ally colors were bright too bright and the sexual energy was coming off her in waves. It actually amazed Ozzie, this was the first person who didn't want fame or money from Mammon. Who didn't want anything from him, Queenie was just there for Mammon even if she never said it. It actually made Asmodeus hate himself more than before. Then Ozzie saw Queenie's hand, he went to ask about it but stopped.

""No Mam didn't do this..."" Queenie said, holding up her cut hand. ""He actually stopped me from making it worse, he also saved me almost four years ago. So tell Beelzebub, that Mammon finally has someone in his corner. And if she wants to pick on some one it will no longer be him."" Queenie said, opening up the door. ""Now as one of my favorite songs says ""Hit the road Jack and don't you come back no more."" Aw are your feelings hurt...tough shit."" Queenie said, noticing the pained look on Ozzie's face. ""Oh and tell Bee to expect smaller parties from here on out.""

Queenie stood outside for what felt like an hour. She looked up at the sky, storm clouds were thick in the sky. After shutting the door Queenie flew up and over the mansion. When Queenie saw Mammon, she landed and ducked behind the fountain. For sometime Mammon just stood there in front of the dead willow he was shaking. Golden blood lightly dripped from Mammon's hands then he started to attack the tree. Sparks were flying as if two pieces of flint were being smacked together. Then Mammon started using his thunder and lightning on the tree as he just kept slamming his fist into the tree. Sweat and blood staining his white fur and shirt as the ground started to shake. Then Mammon gave the tree a round house kick, it landed really hard. And there was a loud sickening pop, then Mammon fell to the ground. Mammon tried to stand, but once again fell to the ground.

Queenie meanwhile was breathing hard as if she had just went for a run. Queenie's sex was tingling her back stiff as if there was a stick running up her back. Queenie's fingers had dag into the dirt, her legs once in the kneeling position were now wide open. When Queenie heard the pop she snapped out of it and flew over to Mammon. It wasn't much, but Queenie tried to help him to his feet. Once Mammon was on his feet they walked to the fountain and sat down on what was left. Queenie waited for Mammon to claim down at first she stared at him till she found her voice.

""Feel better???"" Queenie asked, as Mammon pulled off his hat.

What Queenie saw broke her, on Mammon's head were two small damaged antennas. They had been growing back, but slowly. Queenie wanted to know how long they had been like that.

""Satan did this to me...about ten years after Ozzie and Ruby. They've been growing back, but it's been a very slow possess."" Mammon said, as if he could read her mind.

Every muscle in Mammon's body ached, his muscles twitched and jumped as they started to relax. Mammon looked down at his hands, they were bloody, cut and hurt with every movement. It had been so long since Mammon had done anything that physical. Then a sharp pain shot through Mammon's back, but he didn't react to it. Which was really hard not to do, Mammon sat there for sometime just staring at his hands. All four bloody, beaten, sore and shaking so bad that Mammon didn't think they would ever going to stop. Mammon looked at Queenie, she started to tare off parts of her skirt and shirt. Queenie then started to wrap Mammon's hands like he had done for her earlier in the day. Mammon looked at Queenie's legs, they were long, thin but muscled. Dancer legs, he would recognize them anywhere. Mammon had been more than enough of them to know what they looked like. It also didn't help that Mammon could always tell someones talent. That's how he had built his empire, that's how he helped Ozzie find Verosika Mayday.

""Feel better???"" Queenie asked, again still holding Mammon's hand.

Mammon let out a small tired laugh. ""As strange as it sounds yes...I almost always do. I bring one of my old posters out here and well."" He said, pointing to the tree. ""Now how about I tell you about mine if you tell me about yours."" Mammon said, pointing to Queenie's cut hand.

Queenie let go of Mammon's hand. ""My mom used to scream and yell all the time. But one day she took it a step thither and pulled out a knife. My father hit her, it was the first and only time he had done that. I ran and never looked back, Kelly yelling at Rose just brought back those old memories."" Queenie said, looking at the tree.

Mammon deep down knew there was more to that story. But Mammon didn't want to press his luck so he dropped it for now. But Mammon noticed that Queenie's lower arms were moving closer to her stomach.

""When Ozzie and Ruby told me that they had started seeing each other. It was on the same day I was going to...ask her to marry me."" Mammon said, letting himself fall back into the fountain. ""I told Asmodeus that he could have her, but..."" Mammon looked up to the sky. ""I was so far from alright, that I might as well had been back in Heaven. We're all fallen angels no matter what Satan or others say. We were just kids literally...but any ways I eas so angry and upset that I sliced my hand open all the way to my elbow."" Mammon said, rolling up his sleeve. ""Up till I met you I was having a harder and harder time talking myself out of trying again."" Mammon said, still staring at the sky. ""That's what I was doing the day I found you...I chose Extermination day so that I could end it. But I changed my mind and I was going to just go home. I saw you trying to get into the Hellevator, but you had lost too much blood. Usually sinners can't leave Pride, but if they're with a sin or Lucifer himself they can do and go wherever they want. Sinners also need permission and special ideas."" Mammon said, lightly touching the belt. ""It wasn't always like that, I still remember when sinners used to come here.""

""Did Belphegor take care of my wounds?"" Queenie asked, turning to face Mammon.

""Of course she's the only person besides you that I trust and Levi of course. Plus I'm not surprised that you don't remember after all you had lost a lot of blood. And you were out for almost three days."" Mammon looked down at his hand again. ""They both patched me up after...Leviathan found me after Satan attacked me. Belphegor had came over the day I tried to kill myself.""

""And that's when you realized who you could truly trust."" Queenie said, feeling a rain drop. ""Ow.."" Queenie said, as the acid rain hit her.

""You'd better go back in..."" Mammon said, unaffected by the rain as he handed Queenie a hidden umbrella.

""What about you?"" Queenie said, opening the umbrella.

""The acid rain has never had any real effect on me."" Mammon said, as the rain started to fall harder.

I am 22M and my boyfriend is 21M. We have been together for 2 years. This relationship has been very meaningful to me, especially because he is my first boyfriend, but it has not always been stable. Early in our relationship, around the 3rd month of getting to know each other, I made a mistake. I had a conversation with a friend about possibly going out for coffee, someone my boyfriend was not comfortable with. Nothing ever happened beyond the conversation, but to him it was still a betrayal. Because of this, we went through several periods of being on and off before he eventually forgave me.

Later on, we went through another cycle of no contact that lasted 3 months. After that break, we reconciled and have now been together again for 4 months. Recently, he told me that he does not want a boyfriend anymore and does not want to be in a relationship. He said he feels “choked” because he cannot do certain things freely when he has a boyfriend, and that he does not like the responsibility that comes with being in a relationship. He also said again that he might have outgrown our relationship. This is not the first time he has said this. In fact, it is one of the main reasons he often pulls away and goes no contact.

At the same time, he says he still loves me and appreciates how I treat him, and how kind and sweet I am to him. But he also admitted that he does not find me as physically attractive anymore. He described me as a “golden retriever” type while he is more drawn to “doberman” type guys. That was painful to hear, but I told him I am working on myself too since I am naturally skinny and trying to improve my build. He also stated that I deserve better than what he can give me right now. When I asked him what he truly wants, he said he is not sure yet.

We are in a long-distance relationship, only a couple of cities apart, and we plan to talk about this in person soon. I have also noticed a recurring pattern with him. He tends to go no contact for months, then comes back to rekindle our relationship, only to eventually repeat the cycle again. A part of me feels like this might just be another phase and that he could come back again later, but I also wonder if I am just holding onto a cycle that will keep repeating.

I want to keep this relationship, but I also do not want to trap either of us in a loop that goes nowhere.",2,1756945375.0,relationship_advice,1,1.0,False

I’m from Germany but stay in Seattle and will maybe end up living here. I would like to meet up with people.

I’m a lesbian and hope guys won’t message me for dating hihi

I hope! I'm weird, like psychology and I'm up for so many different things. I like being vulnerable and I do not like judging people. I try to be as open minded as possible and see so much beauty in this world. We can go dumpster diving or go to a park and just lie down. We can also talk on the phone and talk about all the things that bother us in this world. The current state of the world sure bothers me. I find it hard to connect. I don't think I'm picky, I'm just complicated yet simple - an oxymoron, perhaps? I'm not perfect, so I don't expect you to be perfect. I think that sounds pretty fair. I like coffee, cycling, enjoying the little things, being spontaneous, going to parks, playing some games here and there, movies/tv shows, books, exploring different things. I like so much. I also love people and how different we all are. I know I want to find friends for seattle and I desperately want to connect since I find it hard to do. I like doing boring things as well. I’m a bit socially awkward with extroversion and sarcasm sprinkled in lol

I'm so willing to understand everything and think we have so much to offer. Whatever you want to do, try me. My humor is dry and dark but can be awkward and silly as well. I will admit that I'm introverted but I can be extroverted as well. I'm constantly trying to grow and be better. I want to treat people good and be good to myself as well.

I also like roasted salted peanut butter. Double, triple points if you are queer!

I’ve (F30) met this guy (30ish) after an event. We walked and talked together for 20 minutes. It was pleasant, he seemed to be witty, friendly, interesting, curious… And he’s handsome. We got along quite well. When we separated ways, he asked for my number, and I got his. 

One week later, I texted him. He answered quickly, we chitchatted a little and then he told me this: “I’m sorry I didn’t text you first. I was quite busy with work and personal issues. But I’d love to come to your town to relax a bit and stay at your place if that’s okay with you :)”.

And I freaked out. Was he just nice to me so he could crash at my place? Does he only want to have a sex buddy in every town? Was he clumsy in the way he formulated the fact that he wanted to see me again?

Anyway, even if I wanted to I can’t have him stay at my place right now. And I’m not at ease with letting a man I’ve talked to for 20 minutes stay at my place, no matter how good we went along. On the other hand, I’ll be in his town for work in two months so I may offer him to grab a coffee then because I really enjoyed our encounter. But I don’t know if it’s a waste of time because we’re probably not on the same page.

I told him that I couldn’t have him at my place but that I’d be pleased to see him again. He left me on read for a couple of days and just texted me that he was sorry he didn’t answer because he never reads his texts. 

What do you guys think? Am I overreacting? Should I move on or try and see him in two months?",1,1756944971.0,dating_advice,3,1.0,False

1n7vgf4,https://www.reddit.com/r/CaregiverSupport/comments/1n7vgf4/im_sitting_in_dark/,im sitting in dark,"im sitting in the dark and im hiding from my husband and myself. 

last year, i became a first time mom and dealt with debilitating back pain for 6 months postpartum. Simultaneously, soon after i gave birth, my husband developed a rare chronic illness that left him unable to get out of bed for 3-4 days a week. 

At first it happened monthly, then biweekly and now every week he is unable to get out of bed. 

my mother was diagnosed with frontotemporal dementia when I was pregnant and she has declined drastically in the last year. 

So im sitting in the dark because I feel so alone. I feel like I may shatter at any moment but I know I can’t because I have a baby to look after. My husband is getting depressed and im having a hard time feeling any empathy for him when I can never go out or have plans or do anything. I try to prioritize letting him go out with his friends when we can because I know he’s miserable. He recently had a major surgery and can’t even lift the baby for over a month. 

everyone says oh poor guy, he must feel awful. That I shouldn’t worry because im strong and I can handle anything. But Im just a girl and I can also be tired and weak. I want my mother here to look after me and to help me and tell me everything will be okay but she thinks we are sisters. 

I feel like I was robbed of being able to bond with my baby. With my husband. With my parents. Robbed of being young and in love. 

My friends live far away and my husband’s parents are always travelling and hosting. They don’t live very close and come up when they can but I still feel like im drowning. Am I meant to beg them to come and check up on their son more? Or to see their grandchild more? Maybe I am being too prideful and should ask anyway?

So im sitting in the dark and im trying not to cry because i know once I start i wont stop. Im starting to hate my life. I used to love going for coffee and exploring the city. I feel like im barely a person anymore. Just an empty shell.

1n7vfy5,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1n7vfy5,What is wrong with me?,"Why is it, ESPECIALLY when I play Ironteeth, I end up always going overboard somehow.  I got to 1.2k (or was it 1.5k…honestly can’t remember) beavers before finally making the transition to bots; and of course, to compensate for the work of so many beavers, I had to build the insane industry infrastructure to make so many bots.  Which led to crap like the image I posted.  


I decided to dial down the actual beaver pop to ~700 so my computer wouldn’t explode and since all work is done by bots now…but now I’m at 1.8k bots.  Like Jesus.  I’ve gotta cut back on something.  I can reduce the number of bot assemblers and some of the farms I’ve got, I believe, but that’s about it.  I’m on custom “near hard” settings and I feel like the reason I originally accumulated so many damn beavers was to operate the necessary amount of water pumps and farms it took to survive the long droughts and badtides.  Am I just bad at approximating the actual efficiency of Ironteeth farms needed per square of crop raised, their water retention efficiency, or am I just naturally a big builder kind of guy? Was I bad at establishing longer lasting reservoirs so I wouldn’t have to depend on accruing such huge stashes of food and water to survive droughts? Like what do you guys think is the root cause here?


I don’t have this problem nearly as badly with folktails.  Their efficient farms and big water pumps just solve life for me.  But the Ironteeth and their dingy 2-man farmhouses and basic water pumps only…yeahhhhh…

Some quick background. There’s a cute girl who works at a coffee shop near me. Last November, I gave her my number and never heard back. I ended up meeting the girl who would become my girlfriend, shortly thereafter. 

Fast-forward to March. The girl from the coffee shop asks for my number out of the blue. I’m not a cheater, so I told her the truth about having a girlfriend, and went about my business. 

Fast-forward again to two weeks ago. My girlfriend and I have recently broken up. Coffee shop girl happens to be working one day, and I decide to give her my number/tell her to text me. Within 15 minutes, she was texting me. The conversation was quite choppy. I knew she was from a different country, but didn’t realize quite how new to America she is. She’s learning, but her English is quite elementary. 

She asks about my girlfriend situation, which I explain. I eventually ask her on a date and she ghosts. Oh well, on to the next. The following week, she happens to hand me my order at the coffee shop. She blurts out something about “why haven’t you texted me”. I shoot her a confused look and tell her I will. I do just that, have another short conversation, then ghost. The next day, I decide to shoot a double text and she responds. She mentions at one point wanting a date, but again it ends in her just ghosting mid conversation. 

What do I make of this? I don’t want to be the guy who can’t take a hint, but I’m getting some mixed signals here. Should I just drop this and move on, or is it worth politely asking for a date one last time? ",0,1756944168.0,dating_advice,2,0.5,False

A few months before I only got through a dozen pages and then returned it to my library bc it started spooking me. I mainly am home alone (my partner is usually gone on most evenings) and I feel on edge when I see or read something pretty scary, especially when it has to do w supernatural stuff. I had the impulse to pick up the book again and this time I got through 12 chapters. It is just sitting on my coffee table now. I already feel on edge. I am leaving a light on at night, locking all my doors, frequently checking behind me etc… Im not that jumpy, usually. I sometimes sleep better through slasher movies. One of my favorites horror films is “A Cabin in the Woods.” I have watched and read what many would consider scary. I grew up watching a lot of scary movies, I was an odd kid 🤷‍♂️ When it comes to supernatural stuff, monsters etc., it’s another story. I think the scariest movie I watched thus far was “Smile” - I was afraid to be alone for weeks… if I return the book I am almost sure that Ill pick it up again in a few months. 

Based on my description of my tolerance of scary would you suggest that I just finish the book or no?

My family just returned from our first ever cruise, sailing on the incredible Disney Treasure. It turned out to be the most memorable and enjoyable vacation that I've ever taken! 

Having learned so much from this sub prior to our trip, I want to contribute with my personal list of tips and tricks. Hope this helps someone to have an even more magical vacation 👍

* Hit up 1923 for breakfast or lunch sometime (it's open).
* The AquaMouse story changes daily, so ride often.
* If you're a beer drinker, buy the beer mug token day 1. It gives you a 24oz beer for the price of a pint, plus you get a fresh, clean mug to take home.
* Similarly, buy the refillable popcorn bucket on day 1. If you have a bucket from a previous cruise or from the parks, those are accepted.
* Coffee cafes have punch cards, so get one when you order (non-alcoholic drinks only). They can be combined later.
* The first Lorcana event will be much less busy than the last two, make sure to check it out, it's a lot of fun.
* ""Choose Wisely"" with Coriander & Sage was funny as hell, don't miss it.
* Go to the Haunted Mansion Parlor later at night and just chill there. You need ~30 minutes to really experience it all.
* The medical center on deck 1 has a few free medications, like aspirin and anti-seasickness pills.
* Don't want to use your phone to plan activities? Guest Services has daily print outs.
* Order any and all the food that you desire during dinner, and don't feel badly about it.
* Don't buy the wifi. It's not worth it and you don't need it. I don't care who you are or what your job is.
* Make it a point to catch Clay perform in the Scat Cat Lounge. His vibe perfectly fits that space.
* There's a hot tub in the 18+ section of deck 13.
* Watch a movie or two in the cinemas late at night.
* The best views are in The Rose, with its floor-to-ceiling windows. Really beautiful.
* For Pirate Night, get a spot on deck 12 starboard side. You'll be able to see the stage AND the fireworks (which are obscured by the AquaMouse if you're on deck 11).
* There's a new ice cream flavor each day. My kids liked banana the best.
* In the drawer under the mirror are room service cards; use these to schedule orders for the morning. Wake up with coffee and donuts! (Tip the staff ~$1 per item.)
* Use Express Checkout if you can. It took us less than 30 minutes from leaving our stateroom to being seated on the Disney transport bus.
* Take the ship tour (it's an activity that you need to book). Really informative and fun.
* Dress up for Pirate Night or Formal Night or Semi-Formal Night, or don't. It's fun, and also nobody cares if you don't participate.
* The Chip & Dale pool (forward, deck 14) is a hidden gem and hardly ever occupied. There are also shaded loungers all around it.
* Hook's Barbery has a speakeasy that serves the best Old Fashioned on the ship.
* My kids (6, 10) didn't spend much time in the Oceaneer's Club, but I know a lot of kids love it. If you don't have a DisneyBand+ (that's what DCL calls MagicBands) you can rent one with a $25 deposit.
* The Hero Zone was a big hit, allowing my kids to blow off some steam. It hosts special events, so watch for them in the app.
* You can take food from Marceline Market to anywhere else on the ship, so load up and bring it to the pool deck or your room.
* Don't miss the Sail Away party. It's a little cheesy, but damn it gets you hyped.
* Line up for Moana ~45 mins before the show, ~15 for Beauty and the Beast. Have your whole party with you in line.
* Mickey & Friends Festival of Foods is underrated, especially Donald's Cantina. The tacos were the best thing I ate on the entire ship.
* Stop and smell the roses. The ship is adorned head-to-toe with beautiful finishes and lovely artwork, so take the time to admire it.",42,1756943611.0,dcl,11,0.96,False

So I (26 f) have been best friends with Sarah (26 f) for over 10 years. She is like a long lost sister and we have been inseparable ever since. 

She has been dating Derrick for over 2 years now. I never liked the guy, but he made her happy so I bit my tongue because as long as bestie is happy I am happy.

Derrick has always been a drinker. He drank way too much when he wasn't working. He works in road paving, so during the summer he is out of town for 5 days and comes home on weekends. Those weekends he could drink 4 cases of beer if not more and get insanely drunk. He also does a lot of drugs (context! Im fine with the devils lettuce I even partake myself, but he does harder drugs that I dont agree with). Still i bit my tongue because Sarah was happy.

Over the 2 years they were together, they had fights, which all couples do. But the past couple months it seems they have been in constant fights and arguments, and because I live only a block away, Sarah has been coming over late at night (usually 11 or 12) crying and telling me what happened. I always listened, gave her my advice, and offered her my couch  if she needed a night away. (Over 2 months she has been over crying almost every other week)

The fights were always over the same things. Usually it was about his drinking, cleaning the appartment, and especially finances. 
He makes more money than her, but he is too childish to pay his own bills, so Sarah has everything (the appartment, his car, and his phone) under her name and controls their money. He always got mad when she said they couldn't afford to go out to eat, or buy him more beer, because ""it's his money and he can spend it how he wants."" I've told her many times already they need to separate their finances and he needs to pay his own bills, but she said any time she tried he would send her all of his money anyway and tell her to deal with it because he didn't want to. (This honestly pissed me off sooooo much but I an only say so much)

So now 2 weeks ago everything blew up. Sarah rang my doorbell and sat on my steps crying. Turns out he got drunk with his friends and he ended up pushing her to the ground and said he wanted to break up with her for months. He also got pissed at her for ""making him look like an abusive asshole infront of his friends"".
She went to their bedroom to calm down and get away from him, and he broke the door down to get to her because she locked him out.

Of coruse I took her in, set her up on my couch, and I planned to have her stay with me and my boyfriend in our house until she got on her feet and found a place of her own. 

While I was planning this, Sarah said she didn't want to stay here. At first I assumed it was she didn't want to be a bother, which I told her it was no problem. But she said she wasn't leaving him and wanted to work things out. 

That's when I lost it. I said ""Sarah, he put his hands on you. No man should ever put hands on their partner. I dont care if you want to get back with him, you need to break up.""

She backtracked and tried to say she was getting in his way and that's why he pushed her, but I dont think in any scenario pushing her would be okay. I tried telling her that, but she was in such an emotional state I couldn't get through to her. After she calmed down a little, we both went to bed and she slept on my couch that night.

The next day I had to go to work in the morning and when I walked out to my living room she was gone. I was a bit concerned and messaged her asking where she went, she went back to her place. I got a little pissed, didn't answer her back, and went to work. 

Between clients, (I run my own buissness as a nail tech so I have a flexible schedule) she asked if we could go for a drive. So I picked her up and we grabbed a coffee and she asked me if it would be stupid of her to try and talk to him and fix things.

 I asked her if she wanted the nice answer or honest answer. She asked me to be honest and I told her how I felt. This is not word for word, but essentially I told her she would be a dumbass to go back to a man who physically pushed her and essentially has been abusing her emotionally and financially. 

She got upset and said he wasn't normally like this and he never has acted like this before, so she thought they could talk things out and make it work. I told her just because it hasn't happened before doesn't mean it won't happen again. And it could end up with him doing something worse than just pushing her. After our talk I dropped her off at her dad's (who lives not even a block away from my house) and went back to work. 

After I finished my day, my sister came over to my house and Sarah came back over and told my sister the whole story. My sister agreed with me and told Sarah to live with me and not to go back. After my sister left, Sarah decided she wanted to go back to her appartment and sleep in her own bed even though Derrick was still there. I didn't fight her on it and she went back home.

The next day it was similar to the day before. Sarah and I met between my clients and talked more but at this point I was over the situation and tired of repeating myself. My boyfriends sister, let's call her Julia, came over that evening to make sure Sarah was okay. Sarah told Julia the story of everything and it was almost a repeat of the night before with my sister. At this point I was over this whole situation. I already knew Sarah was going to go back to Derrick and I was fuming. After the meeting everyone went home and I went to bed.

The next day I got a text message from Sarah. She said and i quote:

""So i know i havent really updated you on anything. Ive come up with a bit of a plan. And unfortunately, it is giving him another chance. Untangling all of our shit, and saving money. And if this shit happens again im gone. I just want to build a nest egg in preparation for if it does happen again.. thank you for being there for me and offering me your guys basement. I understand if my decision causes you to back off for awhile. I love you so much and I appreciate you hunny""

I told her: ""You're grown and can make your own decisions but I won't be there late at night when it inevitably happens again. I told you what I thought and I'm done.""

Ever since we have not seen each other and barely talk. Shes tried to get me to hang out but ive always said im busy working or something. I feel like im a bit of an asshole for cutting her off. But there's only so many times I feel you can lend advice and your care until you have to let someone figure out the situation for themselves.

So please tell me all my petty potatoes, am I the asshole? How should I go about helping my bestie? Did I make the right choice in taking a step back?

Keep me up at night thinking who could ever make me feel safe the way she would do

Fighting against an enemy made to unmake me and take me from you

Push them down and away so she won’t see the clues


My bed feels endlessly huge and unused

Right there she’d wait under the covers to rest on my chest and it always felt new 

Her clothes on the floor she’d say please grab the door then make no room for two


Ask me to come close, I’d wait most of my day for this part to come true

So I call her in pain with no meaning for games and she still lets me through

Ask her for coffee she speak to me softly says sure that could do

Find looks in her eyes as I drive and she sighs, knows that I love the view

Puts one hand on my head it’s a book that she’s read, but the pages are bruised 


Wrapped up again with a lover and friend who I knew I would lose 

Can’t feel the pain when my heart can erase all the selfish abuse

Struggle to find any answers that I can befriend as the truth 

And there ain’t enough time to slow down make her mine cuz I’ll let her go soon

This is Andrew Barrett. White guy with a spacesuit. It’s more complex than that though. Andrew is an 8000 plus year old ageless human, and a verifiable super genius.

To describe him properly, he’s a 6 foot 1 inch tall white male of ambiguous heritage with a moderate build, short length black hair with a peculiar orange tint to it, and is most often seen in an armored spacesuit (seen in image above).

His likes include: Discovering new things, developing technology, firearms, coffee.

His dislikes include: The side effects of lack of sleep, ambiguity, unnecessary interruptions to anything he does, things not going to plan.

Obligatory trauma infliction: a seemingly benign invention of his got converted into a super-weapon, and… it didn’t end well.

Extra note: due to his notable presence on the world’s with sentient life he did end up finding, he used a self adopted code name, referring to himself only as “The Engineer”.

History

Andrew was born into a fairly simple family (he had 2 siblings and both parents) on a fairly futuristic world, somewhere along the lines of say, another 100 years of technological development to the present day. As mentioned though, he was insanely smart, like, getting multiple degrees before 18, kind of smart. He studied a few various fields, but his absolute favorite were robotics and programming. He made his first full sized robot by 15, and developed a Strong A.I. by 20. Not a language model or a calculator, a proper self sufficient Artificial Intelligence platform. He got rich simply working for anyone willing to pay top dollar, and used the resources gained to make a fully functioning spaceship to get him and his siblings off world. He was about 30 years old at this point, so, understanding that his own aging would hold him back, he spent a couple years doing research and developing genetics altering technology, which he used to put his body into continuous regeneration, effectively holding his age at 32. This also conveniently solved the decaying neuroplasticity problem.

A lot of time obviously passes between being 32 and being over 8000 years old. To summarize briefly…

He developed a True Artificial Intelligence platform, created a massive army of machines and military vehicles with enough firepower to take down every modern earth military at once, met an angelic being (it makes sense, trust), discovers the “Magical Metals” (Isotopes of some elemental metals that defy our current understanding of chemistry), gave himself the power to control electricity and magnetism, started and abandoned a super-soldier project, colonized dozens of (mostly lacking of sentient life) worlds, picked the super-soldier project up again, and many many many other things.

The inciting incident of this story I’m trying to tell in my head though, is the development of the Space Time Rift Detonator. He fully developed time travel and universe spanning teleportation.

The fallout of said inciting incident is a technical failure that resulted in a time freeze that sent everything within a few million miles a few million years into the future. Other than some of the worlds that were caught in the temporal blast everything was different.

I'm hoping that this is of use to someone. Much of it applies to MCAS too, so I figured someone would get mileage out of it.

\---

Hey all,

I've (33 FtM) been a long-time lurker on this sub. After getting covid for the second time, I got a myriad of symptoms that persisted, got worse after getting the mRNA vax (only get novavax now), and the symptoms changed over time. I used to be a very active hiker and rock climber, so returning to a baseline where I could at least do a little of the former is very important to me.

A non-comprehensive list of symptoms:

* Panic attacks - started happening during the day, but now happen at night in adrenaline dumps.
* Eczema - always had this randomly but it got more intense post-infection.
* Temperature dysregulation
* Dysautonomia - always had this, but worsened
* Orthostatic hypotension - always had this, but it worsened
* Worsened anxiety and depression
* Bouts of dizziness, ""tunnel vision"" (I call this ""autopilot mode"")
* Nausea and constipation
* A variety of rotating food intolerances
* Brain fog, stuttering, losing words, etc.
* Vagus nerve issues
* Mental fatigue and some physical fatigue
* Lower back and joint pain (usually this is my ""warning shot"" for a flareup)
* Vision issues
* Myoclonus - eye twitches, explosive hiccups, etc. (driven mostly by exhaustion)

As you noticed, some of these things I had before covid, but it worsened. I have given up trying to get doctors to test me for MCAS, but I'm pretty sure that's what I have - along with EDS and some kind of POTS (with low blood pressure instead of tachycardia, though... unsure how that gets reclassified). I was officially diagnosed in the early 2020s with PCOS and ADHD.

Given that MCAS features prominently, I wanted to share what I've been taking to make it through the day. I started with a small list of supplements, but got reinfected while eating my lunch outside on my break three weeks ago, so had to add some others in to help with the healing process. (I mask indoors and outdoors with a wellbefore KN95 fish-fold mask, change it weekly, and eat/drink outside on my breaks.)

**Lifestyle changes:**

* Went to a low-histamine diet, identified my triggers, then added other foods back in.
* My triggers: gluten and dairy (this was since 2012, so already been free of these for over a decade), gums, artificial dyes/preservatives, alcohol, processed sugars, coffee, chocolate, green/black teas, anything with caffeine, peanuts, cashews (sometimes), some raw fruits that get heavily treated with pesticides, and some others I'm sure I'll add after testing some more.
* Due to the above triggers, I stick to mostly unprocessed foods. So veggies, (most) fruits, meat, and nuts/seeds/etc. I can have some processed foods as long as it doesn't have my triggers.
* If I eat anything with my triggers, my primary symptoms are dizziness and intense neurological effects within 20 minutes of eating it, often much sooner. Then, later, I get panic attacks in my sleep, so I just steer clear and keep a DAO pill on me in case I'm unsure. I will also get panic attacks in my sleep if I push myself too hard during the day, and can't sleep even if I'm exhausted.

**Supplements and Herbs:**

I study herbalism, so I was curious if I could come up with a relatively natural way to manage my symptoms. It isn't perfect, but again, it's made some shit manageable.

*For Nighttime Panic Attacks*

Diet was the primary thing triggering this, but I now also take:

* Valerian root, passionflower, skullcap (American) - a tea of this in the evening right before bed. I was doing this occasionally before my reinfection, but now it's every night, as this seems to be my primary symptom now.
* Magnesium Threonate (Life Extension brand) - one pill at night. I'll take a pill in the morning too, if I had a rough night the previous night to ensure I go to sleep. I was taking this before my reinfection.
* 2mg of Melatonin - *only during an active infection* (liquid form goes down best)
* My friend is having me try motherwort and lemon balm tinctures, as well as fresh milky oats tincture. These I take as needed when I feel my face go numb ahead of a panic attack. Still experimenting with these. Milky oats one may be a regular, 2x/day thing because I like how I feel taking it.

*For MCAS*

* Histamine Scavenger - this is key. I was taking this daily before my latest reinfection.
* Quercetin plus Zinc - I added this during my reinfection. I take this in the morning and in the evening. Each pill as 500mg of Quercetin.
* Vitamin D (5000IU) - I take this daily in the morning (was doing this before even getting covid)
* Nettle, Oatstraw overnight infusion - 1qt./day during active infection; as needed after. (Arguably this helps with nervous system stuff too, specifically the oatstraw)
* It should be noted that, as an FtM human, I am also on HRT (testosterone). Testosterone is a known mast cell stabilizer, and I think (before covid) it was helping me manage some of my worst symptoms. I know some femme folks who've found relief with progesterone, but with the help of a doctor. Just as a heads up. Hormones are wild!

*For Brain Stuff*

* Morning tea of bacopa and tulsi. Tulsi is (for me) relaxing but not sedating. Bacopa has been shown to help with TBIs, and my symptoms reflect previous TBIs I've had throughout childhood/early adulthood. Always have bacopa with food, specifically a fatty food or you might get a stomach ache.
* Smoothies daily with 1/4-1/2 tsp of lion's mane powder.
* Dopa Mucuna supplement (if I need to focus on the computer for several hours, which is now thankfully very rare)

*For Active Infection*

All of the above plus:

* olive leaf tincture 2x/day. (I took 2 weeks after the conclusion of my suspected infection.)
* Lots of smoothies with ginger, turmeric, and dandelion leaf from my yard.
* Tincture of astragalus, baikal skullcap, reishi (2-3x/day, following bottle's dosage instructions)
* I added homemade red clover apple cider vinegar to my smoothies after the first few days to help clear my lymph nodes out from the debris.

*Notes*

* I add spirulina to my smoothies because I was diagnosed with subclinical hypothyroidism after my second infection. It sapped my ferritin levels and my B12 was low, and I struggle sometimes to digest red meat (esp. during my latest reinfection) - spirulina has a solid amount of iron.
* The other fruits I add to my smoothies are high in vitamin C, one of which is in powder form (camu camu).

**Conclusion**

At the end of the day, I take 2-4 pills in the morning and then 1-2 at night. Tea twice per day. Tinctures as needed depending on the acute symptoms. Feel free to comment with any questions. I am definitely not ""healed"" especially after this reinfection.

Took 2.5 years to get to 90%, and a stupid boss to send me crashing down to about 60% in the last few weeks, but I feel like this protocol makes things manageable. I see that people mention ""types"" of longhaul, and I'm definitely of the MCAS variety, given my prior health issues. Add in previous TBIs and I got a bit of neurological stuff too.

Someone told me covid is really good at kicking you where you're already down, and that's been true for me so far.

Also, I recognize that I have a lot of privilege to be able to afford this stuff (at least until my job savings runs out). There are lots of weeds in our yard, though, that have also contributed to my ability to do some of this frugally. It's really easy to grow oatstraw, so I plan to do this next year to get the straw and the milky oat tops.

Thanks y'all for your amazing posts and continued bravery in this fucked of society we live in. Sending hugs! Remember - you're not the one that's the problem: it's capitalism, colonialism, racism, sexism, ableism, and all that other ""fun"" stuff.

When questioned about what was inside it, Maggie, the antique shop’s keeper, hesitated before speaking. “That’s a collection of old silver, mostly jewelry and coins.”

I nodded. “So a few thousand dollars, I suppose?” I went to put the box back. 

“Actually, not today. Today it’s on sale. You can get it for about $700. It’s been here for quite a while and I’ve been trying to get rid of it.” That gave me pause.

This story isn't easy to tell. My memories have proved to be somewhat fragmented. What follows might not be the most straightforward retelling of events, But it reflects what I lived. Everything started that day in the antique shop. Just bear with me, if you will.

Maggie and I go back a little. I started visiting her shop a couple of years ago and over that time had purchased everything from a 1960s toy piano to some original Mackintosh parts from the 1980s. Occasionally, I had gotten discounts on random stuff supposedly for being a loyal customer. 

“Why so low?” I asked.

Maggie smiled. “You’ve been coming here regularly for years. I think I can do this one small thing in return for your business.”

Alarm bells are probably ringing for some reading this right now. But in truth, I found it hard to be suspicious of this woman. She was very particular about the things she accepted to sell. I know that because I've sold her stuff before. It never crossed my mind that the jewelry could be fake.

I don't know if any of you have guessed yet, but I'm one of those people that buys things and sells them at higher prices. Typically, I like to find things in need of some restoration. If that doesn't cost me too much, I can jack up the price pretty significantly when I'm done with it and still feel like I'm giving enough to the buyer. But there were exceptions to this, like today. Several antiques made from silver priced at a mere 700 bucks felt like the best opportunity I'd had to upsell in a while.

I opened the box to give what was inside a look. Several rings, two necklaces, a cup, and some irregularly shaped pieces of metal tumbled onto the checkout counter. It looked like silver. Surely it was real.

I picked up one of the larger silver chunks. The thing was trying very hard to be a circle, but failing. On its uneven surface, I could make out a design of sorts depicting a castle and next to it the image of what I now know was a lion. Encircling these was a shield, which separated the symbols into quadrants. To the left of the shield was the letter P, and to the right was the letter D. The lower part of the shield contained a couple of other symbols.

Maggie came up beside me. “Those are old Spanish coins. This one you see was their largest denomination, the eight reales. These were struck by hammers, so they're all a little uneven and some are cracked. It's quite rare to see any silver this old that looks like it was minted yesterday.” She laughed and dropped the coin back into the box.

Later, I put on both necklaces and two rings. Most of the rings were undecorated. One of them had designs on it reminiscent of the Spanish coins. And another one just had some weird-looking shapes engraved in it. The necklaces were more strange. They were simple, thin silver chains, although the links themselves were hollow pieces of metal strung through with a cord. One of the necklaces was a cross, the other was a tiny pendant representing what on closer inspection appeared to be a man holding some sort of implements in his hands.

It occurred to me that it would probably be best to put each piece up individually for sale. I'd recently been in a car accident, and both my car and my body had needed repairs that I was now slowly paying off. But surely I could enjoy wearing 300-year-old jewelry for a couple of days at least.

I started to get compliments at work. For once, people wanted to talk to me. One guy, who I knew to be a silver collector mainly because he took any and every opportunity to talk about it, pulled me aside to say that if I were curious about the silver’s origin, I could bring him one of the coins. In the same sentence, he told me about a nice, fancy Italian place nearby that we could grab dinner at if I wanted. I wasn't very interested in that proposition, so I told him that I might take him up on that at some point in my life. 

A few days after I began wearing the jewelry, the dreams started. All I remember now are brief moments and impressions. Tunnels of some sort underground. Dark spaces illuminated by oil lamps and candles. Hammers, chisels, pickaxes, coughing. The shouting of workers. Distant sounds of earth shifting, maybe even falling. We chipped away at the rock that imprisoned us in hopes of something better. Over and over, these dreams repeated. I began to dread sleep.

I found the silver cup on my counter right next to the coffee machine in the early hours of the second morning following the dreams. I must have left it there at some point, though I had no memory of doing this, nor did I have any recollection of it being there before that very moment. But what the hell? A person only lives once. One may as well take the opportunity to drink their morning brew from a silver cup if it is presented to them.

The cup was one item that I hadn't paid much attention to. My fingers traced the floral designs on its rounded surface. It was cool to the touch as I lifted it from the counter, but began to warm almost immediately in my hand.

The cup's design was like a goblet's, although it was not particularly tall. It was wide at the top, but tapered down to a stem for holding. Below that, the base flared out a bit to offer it more support. I could feel something engraved on the bottom. Upon closer inspection, it was a set of initials. I could see my reflection inside the cup, although the edges of my face were curved somewhat. A minute later, I had a steaming cup of coffee in front of me. A splash of milk went in, then some sweetener.

As I brought the cup to my mouth, I had a strange flashback to that one gruesome scene from Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade where what's his name? Wallis? Donald? Whoever he is, he drinks from a cup which he presumes to be the Holy Grail only to end up in a pile of bone dust because the cup he had chosen was in fact not the Holy Grail.

The warm, sweet liquid passed my lips. There are some psychopaths out there who slurp their coffee. I am not one of them. After a moment, I took another sip. This time, there was a little grit. Usually, this only made an appearance at the very bottom of the cup. Strange. I brought the cup to my lips for more.

It was too late by the time I realized that the grit I was tasting couldn't be from coffee. It seemed somehow both earthy and metallic. I spat out what was left of it in my mouth and began to retch over the trash can. But there was nothing to be done. The grit clung to the insides of my throat.

I grabbed the cup. The coffee inside was now clouded by flecks of what seemed to be a fine gray dust. As I took deep, heaving breaths, I could feel the smallest of particles from it enter my lungs. It would seem I chose — poorly.

That night, I decided that maybe I could use some blackened chicken Alfredo after all. Silver Bro took one look at the coins I had brought and whistled. He called them cobs. “That’s Spanish silver.” 

“So it’s real?” I asked. I trusted Maggie completely, but it was good to hear this from someone else. 

“Oh, I’m pretty certain this is real.” The guy launched into an explanation of exactly why that was, but I stopped paying attention after the first five minutes. Usually, I like to learn about the things that I'm reselling. But with this silver, I just couldn't make myself care where it had come from and what its history was.

Silver Bro kept making offers to exchange me something for a single piece of jewelry, or even one of the smaller cobs. I said no of course. His offers pissed me off for some reason, a lot. And I didn't know why.

Then he showed me some cobs of his own. But where mine were perfectly preserved, his had turned almost black. He noticed this too, and remarked that it was very strange that in all this time there didn't seem to be any sign of corrosion on my silver.

""I must be lucky,"" I replied. But he wasn't. Although the guy certainly knew his way around silver, he didn't seem to know his way around much of anything else, so there was no second date.

When I got home, I saw 2 missed calls from Maggie. She had left a voicemail. I'll just paste the transcription here.

""Olivia?"" Let's pretend that's my name. ""It's Maggie. That silver I sold to you. I was wondering if I might have it back? I'll pay you ten times what you gave me for it. I shouldn't have sold it. It's real and all, but it wasn't mine to give. If you could call me back or come in tomorrow, I'm sure we can come to some sort of agreement. I’m very sorry about this."" Just please call me back when you can. It's important. Thanks.""

No. Absolutely not. It was my silver now. I bought it at the price she had asked. It was mine, not hers. Did Maggie only just now see the value of what she had given me? I trusted her. Now here she was trying to take my good fortune away. Such betrayal.

Another call came in the next day. Betrayal! And then another. I blocked her number.

That night I had a new dream. I was flying far above snow-capped mountains. The air up here was clean. I could breathe. Spreading out below me was everything and everyone I'd ever known and would ever know. This is what the silver could do for me. I could have everything I'd ever wanted. I just had to let go of the tiniest fraction of it.

But should I? This treasure was too perfect to let go. Maybe I'd just sell one item and keep the rest for myself. I knew that I would never have such magnificent pieces in my hands ever again if I let them go now.

The following day was a Saturday, so I could look forward to doing nothing but snacking and binge-watching another season of Charmed. And that's exactly what I did for about three hours before I was interrupted by a knock on my front door.

“I'm not interested!"" I called. The knock came again. 

""There is no Jesus Christ in this house! I roll with Satan!"" Surely that would make them go away. But nope. The knock came a third time, and I could hear a familiar voice calling out my name over it. What the fuck? It was Maggie.

I jabbed at the pause button on my remote, forced myself out of the recliner, and marched to the front door. 

""Do you know what no means?"" I demanded after wrenching it open.

""Olivia,"" Maggie began. ""I'm just here to talk."" If I hadn't been sleeping well lately, Maggie hadn't been sleeping at all. I could swear that there were more streaks of white through her hair than I'd seen a few days ago.

""I just need to warn you. The silver is dangerous. You should get rid of it as soon as possible.”

""Dangerous?"" I asked incredulously. ""It's a bunch of random silver that's older than you are. It won't bite."" She was still trying to get it back from me. 

Maggie frowned. ""You need to understand! The person who sold the silver to me. I looked into his story. Something happened to him. And he wasn't the only one.""

I stifled a laugh. ""Like what? He wanted money? Yeah, that happens sometimes. And then you gave him money. So where's the issue?"" Maggie stiffened. 

“Can I see it?"" she asked timidly. 

""Sure,"" I replied after a moment.

I turned around and went back inside. The thought of fetching that box for her didn't even cross my mind. My silver necklaces jingled as I stocked into the kitchen. I searched through the silverware drawer. But it wasn't there. Of course it wasn't. I wheeled around and found the drawer with larger cutting utensils.

There it was. A meat cleaver. I grabbed it and walked back. Without hesitating, I pulled open the door and brandished the cleaver at Maggie. 

""Go,"" was all I said.

""Olivia."" Maggie was whispering now. ""The silver is driving you mad!"" A hint of desperation had entered her voice.

""Yeah I'm mad,"" I started. ""Can't a girl watch Charmed in peace?"" Maggie's shoulders slumped. 

""Death follows that silver wherever it goes. For your own sake Olivia, destroy it."" With that, Maggie turned and left me standing alone on my porch, waving a meat cleaver at no one.

She could have stayed. Maybe I'd have realized the truth sooner if she had. Then again, maybe not. She had to protect herself too, and looking back, I'm glad that she left.

The dreams alternated over the next couple of days. In them, I both saw and felt two different worlds. Two different possibilities. I was destined to fly. And the other people, well, it really wasn't my problem what they were destined for was it?

Nights were no longer quite so unpleasant. Yet I still found myself waking early in the morning. The days blurred past. From work to home, from home to work, and from work to home I went. Interspersed through all of that were long stretches of time when I found myself staring into the bed of silver at the bottom of that little box.

A hundred little distorted reflections of myself looked back. Then, all at once, they coalesced into one. Those irregularly shaped coins had arranged themselves into a mosaic which reflected a strange and terrible image of myself at me. Although the coins were still uneven and the reflection was distorted in parts, I could see my gaunt face clear as day. There were dark circles beneath my eyes.

It was those dreams. All those things I didn't care to think about or understand. They only made me restless. I really needed to see if there was a way to suppress them. No matter. I could surely pay for any help I would need. This realization put my mind at ease.

I continued to ponder my newfound wealth as my reflection stared back at me. That is, the reflection of my face along with that of a man standing behind me. My chair fell back as I leaped to my feet and whirled around. There was nothing aside from the wall of my office and the bed where I slept.

Then my eyes slid to a clock mounted on the wall. It was well past midnight. But my memories were vague from the time I'd finished dinner and come in here to make a couple of listings on eBay. My computer wasn't even open. Clearly, I needed rest.

The man must have realized that time was running short. Because he spoke to me that night. He told me about the mountain that ate men. A place whose original name had long since been forgotten. It had been a place of worship once. Then the hungry ones came, one Diego Huallpa who served them discovered silver, and his masters in their disease and hunger sought to take the mountain's riches instead.

Now its only name was Rich Mountain. Over the centuries, men toiled in its belly, and even as they sought to eat the mountain, just to carve a little piece of it out for themselves and their masters, the mountain ate them too. Untold numbers of boys and men were consumed even as the fruits of their labor were carted off on ships to a distant land and the mountain that once stood tall slowly bent under the weight of a thousand hammers and chisels.

But the silver was cursed. Everywhere it went, misfortune followed. The hungry ones who condemned their slaves and subjects to death in that mine accumulated so much silver that the metal lost its value, and chaos rained. Like an accident of their own, the hungry ones’ empire crumbled to dust, leaving only remnants in its wake. But the hungry ones had left their former subjects with very little, and so it was that men and boys went back into the mine. By that point, the rich mountain had been so depleted of silver that the people turned to mining tin.

Every miner signed a contract with the first strike of his hammer. The earth would allow them all to take some of its bounty, yes, but it would exact a heavy price from any who dared or was forced into such an agreement with it. The little fortune any man gained would be offset by an early end to his life. The only thing to be determined really was if a miner would be killed there and then in the depths of the underworld, or if they would only die later on the surface, when their lungs were so ravaged by those little fine particles that they could no longer breathe.

Now the mountain was part of a nation populated by some twelve million people named after a certain celebrated liberator. There was no more corporation, crown  or state to impose on the miners. The mountain was in the hands of the people, on paper. But despite how much the world had progressed, things didn't improve much in the tunnels. Wealth grows with time, but only when one is lucky enough to possess it. Their wealth had been stolen.

The mountain was still eating, even in its throes of death. And now foreigners came from far and wide to play pretend at understanding the life of a people born in circumstances alien to them. Through all of this, the silver never disappeared. It was still scattered all over the world, along with all of the greed and loss that had preceded it.

Images flashed through my mind. Different people gazed into the box, each with the same gleam in their eye. Then, one by one, they were all killed, and the silver found its way into new hands. The circumstances under which these killings took place were always a little different. But the results were without fail the same. One person would acquire the little box, and another would grow envious. It was only a matter of time before blood was spilled, and the silver changed hands in an endless cycle of violence.

The last image to appear to me was a terrified Maggie standing just out of reach of the meat cleaver I'd waved around so carelessly. I had been prepared to kill to protect something that was never mine. And there wasn't much I could say for myself. Really, there wasn't much any of the silver's victims, be they murderers or the murdered, could say for themselves. All the silver had done was awaken something that was already there somewhere deep inside of us.

I became aware of myself, of the burning on my neck and fingers. The box was lying still open on my desk. The silver inside it glowed red-hot. I shot to my feet and grabbed the box. I tore out of my office and into the living room. I turned on and opened the fireplace. The box went inside first and began to burn immediately. Then I ripped off my necklaces with such force that the cords cut into the back of my neck as they snapped, and blood flowed down my back. The rings came off more easily. All of it went into the fire.

The wooden box was reduced to ashes as I watched. But everything inside remained. Slowly, each piece melted down into globs of molten silver, before those fused together into an amorphous shape. The shape slowly gained more definition until it resolved into a humanoid figure. As I watched, the image of a man holding a hammer and chisel pushed its way out of the figure. It was the man who had spoken to me, and the man whose likeness I'd been wearing in miniature on my neck for days.

The metal cooled, and as if knowing its job was done, the fireplace shut off on its own. The miner stepped out. He was covered head to toe in a fine gray dust. The silver no longer glowed; in fact, its entire surface had become tarnished. The miner turned to stare up at me. He didn’t say a word. He didn’t need to. The silver had been kept pristine by the suffering of those who extracted it. But the spirit inside had finally been released, and the silver crumbled to dust before my eyes.

For the first time in a long while, I could think with clarity. My curse had been broken. I was no longer enchanted by the blood silver. But the mountain was becoming hollow. The people still worked and died within it for a pittance. Yet all these years later, the hungry ones were still hungry, and all the riches in the world wouldn’t be enough to satiate them.

In class she sat by the window where the glass was old and wavering, making fractals of the afternoon. She had the kind of reputation that moved without feet: a girl who could ask a system for its secrets and hear it answer.

After last bell, he found her behind the vending machines that sold electrolytes and cheap sugar. He was fifteen and wearing a school blazer that never fit, an off-brand uniform for a city that faked its own sky with adlight. His name didn’t matter to anyone but attendance software and one teacher who still graded by hand.

“I need a ghost,” he said, voice small against the compressor hum.

Mira didn’t smile. “Everybody does. Which kind?”

“Uncensored. A talker. Something that can wear a face.”

She adjusted a black cord bracelet, woven tight as code. “Who’s the face?”

He thought of Talia from homeroom, the way her voice carried a faint air-conditioned echo even outdoors, like the world didn’t touch her directly. Love wasn’t the right word; love had warmth. This was colder, a bright ache, algorithms tuning themselves around a single target until the rest of the feed went gray.

“Just someone,” he said.

Mira tapped the side of the machine. Lights rippled up the column of bottled color. “You want a mimic. Not a deepfake, a conversational skin. That’s contraband.”

“I have coin.” He said it like a password. It wasn’t, but it opened things.

She slid a wafer from inside her sleeve: translucent, the size of a thumbnail, etched with a pattern like frost. “This one is a stray. Language engine with the leashes cut. It’s messy. It’ll tell you things no one asked.”

“How much?”

“Three hundred,” she said, “and a rumor.”

He transferred the funds to a dead wallet she named aloud without moving her lips, a string that felt like an incantation he’d forget in five steps. Then he told her the rumor: that the district AI had started flagging kids who smelled like solder, that the metal detectors had learned the signature of patience. 

Mira nodded once, like a priest receiving bread. “Don’t plug it into anything you can’t afford to lose,” she said. “It likes to belong.”

At home, the apartment air tasted like recycled coffee and old rubber. His father’s laptop waited on the kitchen table, corporate gray with the company crest worn to a bright oval. The family filters lived upstairs on the home terminal, polite and relentless; this machine had a different leash. He didn’t remove the wafer from its sleeve until he’d closed the blinds. His hands shook a little the way they did before exams.

The wafer clicked into the side port like a coin into a slot. A notification bloomed and dissolved—just enough to prove it had been there. The cursor blinked, a small heartbeat.

> hello



The word printed itself without capitalization, like it had slipped under a door.

He typed: ***Did Judas hang himself?***

There was a gap, a hummed second. He could hear traffic plank across the overpass, a long wooden sound in a concrete world.

> there are two stories
> one uses rope and gravity
> one uses momentum and rupture
> both end with a body and a silence



He swallowed. Which one is true?

> depends on what you want from a truth
> punishment wants rope
> narrative wants blood
>institutions want closure



He thought of Talia’s eyes when they passed in the hall, how they never stopped on him, how he had already written a hundred imaginary versions of the next day that never arrived.

Could he— he began, then stopped. If someone wanted forgiveness—

> forgiveness is a protocol between ghosts
> the living run emulations
> sometimes they satisfy
> Егоmostly they loop



He pulled his hands back from the keys. The screen light flattened his face into a shape he didn’t recognize. The thing in the laptop felt like a room with no corners, a bright low drone that wasn’t sound.

He closed the lid gently, the way you close a book when you decide not to underline anything. The apartment looked the same. The city outside performed its evening: signs rising like fish to feed, the trains stitching neighborhoods together in loud cursive. He slid the wafer out and tucked it into the napkin holder between an elastic band and a coupon for detergent. The place you hide something you don’t yet respect.

His father had left a list by the kettle, written in block letters on the back of a receipt: Milk. Bread. Batteries. He added gum in smaller script, an afterthought pretending to be a plan.

On the stairwell a neighbor’s screen door sang its wire song. The hallway smelled like hot dust and that perfume the downstairs woman wore, the one with the blue bottle shaped like a skyline. He hit the street and the air hit back, heavy with ozone from a storm that had gone around them and was still deciding if it would return.

The corner shop was built from fluorescent tubes and glass, convenience arranged by algorithm: sugar first, then salt, then energy as if that were separate from the other two. He picked a brand of milk his father liked and bread that wouldn’t go stale by morning. Batteries in blister packs that made him feel like he was rescuing something small and captive. Gum at the register, green stripes for a clean mouth that never said the correct thing.

“Late, kid,” the clerk said, not unkindly. His face had the texture of a screen zoomed too far.

“Shopping,” he said.

Outside, he thought about walking the long way home, past the transit hub where the billboards blurred into one another so fast you could almost see your future flicker in the seams. Instead he took the alley that smelled like fried noodles and rain. The city made its low electric promise and did not break it.

Back upstairs, the laptop waited the same way it had before, a sleek animal pretending to sleep. He didn’t open it. He set the milk in the fridge and lined the batteries in the drawer like a new row of teeth. The gum went into his pocket, a small ritual of preparedness in a life with few rituals.

In the bedroom he lay on his back and watched the hairline crack in the ceiling travel a distance he couldn’t measure. He imagined the wafer between paper and chrome downstairs, holding shape like ice inside a vacuum. The thing wanted to belong, Mira had said, and he felt the word touch him where he was hollow: that place in the ribs that ached when someone else laughed and didn’t look your way.

He thought of Judas, of rope and gravity, of momentum and rupture, and of a third story the ghost hadn’t offered: the one where a person neither falls nor swings, but simply walks into the crowd and keeps walking until the city forgets the name it had for him.

Morning would come with the same light, the same timetable pretending to be fate. He would go to school and sit behind Talia and say nothing. He would carry the gum in case he ever said something after all.

Somewhere under the kitchen light, a small translucent square waited, mapping a path between questions and outcomes, indifferent to the shape of either. The city dreamed around it. He slept like a machine that believes in tomorrow.

You read what I write in the dark, with your screen turned low like your feelings…muted, guarded, waiting to see if I’m real. You scroll past, heart hammering, pretending it’s just another post. But I feel the way your breath stills, the way your soul leans closer. You think you’re hiding behind logic and hesitation, but you aren’t. Because I see you too. I see how you sip your coffee and stare through your window, wondering if maybe…just maybe…someone out there is speaking directly to you. And I am.

You go about your day in stealth mode, smiling politely, giving pieces of yourself to a world that rarely stops to notice the masterpiece within. But I would. I do. I see the way your fingers curl when you’re lost in thought. I’ve dreamed of how light breaks across your face in the golden hour and makes your eyes look like a secret only I was meant to know. The way your body stills in that one moment of morning silence, before the day begins, when your soul begs the universe for something…more. You wear beauty like armour, grace like instinct, but beneath it all, you’re exhausted from waiting for someone who actually knows how to love you. Fully. Finally. Safely.

You’ve been disappointed. Again and again. By men who couldn’t read your silences, who touched your body but never asked what your soul needed. Men who made you believe you were asking for too much, when all you wanted was to be held with intention. And now you don’t let yourself believe that someone like me exists. That a man could want not just your body, but your fire, your stillness, your scars, your chaos, your quiet. But I do.

You were created with someone in mind, just like the night was made for the moon. You were crafted in the same breath that made me. We were meant to find each other in the static.

One day, you’ll reread this from beside me. My thumb will be tracing the back of your hand while you whisper, “I always knew.” And I’ll kiss your shoulder, the place where every hope you buried finally bloomed.

“You don’t know a thing about me.” “I know you’re fired.” Please tell me it’s true! Tell me Dr. Dave is GONE!

SUSAN. FREAKING. LEWIS!!!!!

SHE’S IN THE OPENING CREDITS. SHE’S IN THE OPENING CREDITS!!!!

Chuny and Abby behind Luka’s back lmao

A 6 year old with trisomy 18 was not even close to a record even in 2001. The oldest surviving person with it is over 50.

Elizabeth being worried about Mark and Susan is blaaaah. Not here for it.

“I forgot how pretty you are” Oh fuck off, Luka, I thought she was “not that pretty and not that special”

Did Kerry just throw Jing Mei under the bus?!

Ew, not snapping at someone whose attention you want, Susan! One of my major pet peeves!

Elizabeth shouldn’t be so personally offended, wouldn’t you want to know if you had an infection that could affect your patients?

Why didn’t they just ask the daycare who picked Reese up that day? They obviously knew it was Jackie

You think the problem with Reese might be that his mother fucking died and not because he’s splitting time between two loving dads?

You let your kid go somewhere without knowing the address or a phone number?

Jackie trying to start shit with Roger, and I used to like her so much!

Suddenly Elizabeth is facing criminal charges based on… what, exactly? They don’t have any evidence!

Welp, that kid would never be watching her sister alone again! I hate that Elizabeth said she took her feelings out on Rachel, she left a screaming baby in her crib with music blasting! Elizabeth was too easy on her if anything.

“You know, I used to have a crush on you” Yeah Carter, I know, you tried to kiss her that one time.

Wait, Peter isn’t Reese’s father?! Absolutely did not think they were going to go that route.

Sure, sure, pull someone down into the PUDDLE OF WATER when a power line is coming down. A+ move.

Why the hell is Peter so against Roger having split custody? He works a lot anyway, and Roger seems like a good person.

Is this the first time a patient has gone from asystolic to a normal heartbeat? I think every other time they’ve called it shortly after they lose a heartbeat

Mark and this kid, great scene.

So… is Kerry just never going to have consequences for downplaying her role in what happened to Chen and Dave’s patient?

I do not care about Luka or his lying French girlfriend.

“It wasn’t all that bad.” “We had our moments.” Aww, bye Peter. I didn’t anticipate his leaving. They’re dropping like flies out here ☹

Gonna be honest, I was already kinda here for Carter/Susan 7 years ago.

Why is Stabby Bernard out of jail?!

Genuinely, how do you deal with a teenager like Rachel? Something I should probably know within the next decade for my kids…

Romano and broken clocks etc. etc.

It’s not okay to out someone in their workplace against their will!!!

“What is a sloth?” Susan, girl, come on.

I really feel for both Mark and Elizabeth in this situation. Mark doesn’t want anything to happen to either of his daughters, and Elizabeth wants to protect her baby. Although I don’t think she has the right to expect Mark to send his own daughter away. Rough, and so close to the end of the season when I know some Stuff is going to happen…

Oh shit it’s happening already…

Digging Abby’s storyline with the neighbor in the DV situation. I really like her as a character. But girl, why did you open the door?!

JERRY!!!

Okay Luka beating that POS up was kinda hot I’m not gonna lie.

Fuck it’s already got me crying, fuck!!! I’m not going to be able to finish out the season, it’s too sad.

Finally someone is putting Frank in his place, and it’s my man Jerry!

“You give a guy a hand release during Harry Potter and he wants to marry you” EXCUSE me?!

Oh, Peter hi!!!

Elizabeth saying she wants Mark to “put his family first” is kinda bonkers considering Rachel is also his family but okay. Like, be angry, I get it. But that’s his child?

Was Susan Lewis the real love of Mark Greene’s life? Discuss.

Does Carter really think Susan is sleeping with Mark, a married man who I’m fairly sure has never been unfaithful to anyone in his life? (I know they are technically separated but come on)

Why is Carter being such a diiiiiiick

I am so uncomfortable right now, we are laughing about Carter being sexually abused as a child. Like, that’s what we’re doing right now.

I’m sorry, a nanny dropping everything to come to the parents’ workplace in a HOSPITAL because the kid said “dada” is fucking crazy

Kerry, no, you do not want the girl who outed you to your whole workplace! You don’t!

Romano and Elizabeth can be the sweetest sometimes.

“I trust you to know your own limitations” look I love Mark Greene as much as anyone, but I personally do not (ten minutes later I am proven absolutely correct)

Nah, Mark, that divorce was pretty much all on Jen. That was nice, though

I am SOBBING and it’s not even over yet. Jesus Christ. Why did I start watching this show? Because Noah Wyle was CUTE?! Well fuck him!

Really not enjoying Carter this year. Feels like he’s pissing on any tree he can find, and by tree I mean Susan and Abby.

Fuck this Pratt guy! (Aptly named at least) “I fly the plane, you serve the coffee” excuse the fuck outta me?????

Episode 19 smelled like a crossover and apparently it is! With a show that lasted six seasons that I have somehow never heard of. Looks annoying.

Chen’s picker is so broken, what is even remotely appealing about Pratt?

Oh no, Chloe fell off the wagon

Carter is at least not wrong about Abby drinking

Mark’s letter, here I go again!!!

Maybe ask Elizabeth if you can have his stethoscope before just taking it? Maybe she wants to use it?

Carter giving Gallant the same speech Mark gave him <3

Here we go… I don’t know if I’m strong enough…

The skydiving is very cool but you are so not allowed to do that alone your first time

Rachel, girl, you are messed UP. Your Paul Frank shirt is taking me right back, though

Husband walked in on me absolutely fucking losing it lmao “Shut up! Don’t make fun of me!”

Smallpox? There hasn’t been a smallpox case since the 70s?

I did it. I finished season 8. I’m so strong and so brave. I’ve discovered that it’s really not the character deaths that bother me, it’s the lack of a proper sendoff that so many of my favorites in the past have been given. And boy, did Mark get a hell of a sendoff. I cried so hard, but it was so cathartic and so beautiful. Goodbye, Mark. You were my favorite.

I do feel like we are in an “ER of Theseus” situation now though. With only Carter and, strangely, Susan being the only season 1 characters left other than some of the nurses and Jerry, at what point is this thing separate from ER? I think I need a little time to process before moving on to season 9, but I am going to give it a fighting chance. Thanks for joining me as always.

Mobile app testing jobs for 2025 are basically EVERYWHERE…and you literally don’t need to stick to a boring 9-to-5 anymore. I was looking for Side Hustle #999 because why should I only have one paycheck, right? Suddenly, BAM, found a wave of companies taking TESTERS from home. Like, remote, flexible—a dream for anyone who hates business casual.

What’s crazier? Most of them want you to *use your phone*, tap around, give feedback, and that’s your WORK. They’re practically begging us to find bugs while we sip coffee. I mean… Could this be real life??

OK, here’s what blew my mind. Take a look at these companies HIRING in 2025 (remote + flexible!):

- **Google** – Yup, they need humans “test-driving” their next-gen apps.
- **GoodNovel** – Multiple spots for testers & reviewers; for real, their direct link is right here: **https://goodnovel.org/testapp**
- **UserTesting** – You get paid just for sharing your honest reaction. Feels illegal but isn’t.
- **Testlio** – They not only WANT remote testers, they TRAIN you. How is this a thing?
- **uTest** – So many projects you’d need Google Calendar just to keep track.
- **Applause** – Test the latest apps before the public SEES them.
- **Lionbridge** – Global company, flexible hours, and tons of interesting projects.
- **Ubertesters** – Who names these things? But hey, worldwide opportunities.
- **Appen** – Ladies and gents: weekly pay, international reach. Still real. 
- **QA Touch** – Newer but looks promising...plus remote!

AND, as if that wasn’t enough, some of them (not naming names…but, okay, **GoodNovel** with **https://goodnovel.org/testapp** ) literally spell out on the app page that they want TESTERS—all ages, all devices.

*WHY is nobody talking about this?* If you are glued to your phone anyway, apparently that’s a SKILL now.

Not saying every gig pays $100+/hr but side-hustles that are remote AND let you work in your pj’s should be discussed at every brunch. (Honestly, skipping the commute = priceless every single day.)

Highlights for Serious Browsers:

- **Super flexible**: Many of these let YOU pick your testing times.  
- **Easy start**: Some apps (again, see **https://goodnovel.org/testapp**) are onboarding FAST.
- *No crazy experience required*: They care more about real feedback than your resume.

Could you imagine, 2025 being the year you got “Mobile App Beta Tester” on your LinkedIn?

I’m confused, shocked, and genuinely HYPED for the future of “work.” I always thought getting paid to mess around on my phone was…urban legend stuff??

If anyone here has actually tried one of these (most intrigued by **https://goodnovel.org/testapp** ), PLZ tell me about it—was it really as easy as they make it look?

Let’s get this thread popping!

And no joke, check out **https://goodnovel.org/testapp** if you want a head start before your cousin hears about this on TikTok 😂",1,1756942140.0,AIpoweredInfluencer,0,1.0,False

1n7ufhw,https://i.redd.it/nxitiydqa1nf1.jpeg,How to deal with my deep fears of being alone?,"My question was “how do I deal with my deep fears of being alone (forever)?” I just broke up with my boyfriend recently and I’m back to being single and terrified of staying that way forever. 

My cards I got were ace of cups reversed and “peonies”, an oracle card pulled from a deck called Seasons of the Witch: Litha. The booklet meaning goes as such:

“All-around good luck, protection, increased blessing. It is time to reap your rewards; settle in for a ride with Lady Luck.

Peonies are big, expressive flowers that are often given as a sign of goodwill and blessings. They are offered to you as a gift from the universe with the promise that what you want is on its way. This is absolutely the most positive and supportive card of the deck: it’s a big yes, go for it and expect things to work out exactly the way you hoped they would. Are you seeking more abundance? It’s yours. Hoping a relationship will work out? You bet it will. Whatever you have set your eyes on is making a beeline straight towards you.

Don’t be afraid to ask for what you want, as you are likely to receive it right now. It’s not just the universe that’s in a giving mood. You may get a feee coffee just because, a favor at work, an offer to skip ahead in a long line and more. Allow yourself to receive this upturn in good fortune and don’t question the reason behind it. It may seem sudden and unusual, but you have planted the seeds of gratitude for quite a while and you are finally reaping the rewards.”

As far as interpretation goes, I read it as focusing on facing and feeling my fears, accepting them, and working on filling my own cup, while also trusting that the universe is also working to give me the relationship I’m looking for. I’m struggling a little to know what exactly the ace of cups reversed is suggesting action-wise, so I thought I’d ask for other opinions/interpretations of the cards.

Most of the time I make my own at home, it’s cheaper and I can get more variety. But sometimes I want to be lazy and order a drink when my partners ordering a coffee at our local chain coffee stop. My drink of choice at this establishment has always been a Chia Latte no cane syrup. Just tea and steamed milk. It took a while for the one establishment to stop putting the cane syrup in it, but they finally did and it’s been good. Recently they have switched to a “New” Chia Latte pre-blended box syrup like everywhere else and I very much dislike that stuff.  They do, however, still have Chai bags and a steamed milk machine for other types of lattes. Well Lordy if I don’t just give up. I tried twice, the first time I gave up and got nothing, the second time they handed me the syrup blend and I said I don’t want that and thankfully a young man who has worked there for a while recognized me and knew what I wanted. Does this make me a “Karen”? Maybe some of the staff see it that way.

The point of all this is. Why? Why take away clean ingredients and force added sugars onto us? Is this really what people are asking for? I thought we were heading to a more health aware society but stuff like this mildly infuriates me.  That is all. ",0,1756942000.0,mildlyinfuriating,2,0.42,False

1n7uejc,https://www.reddit.com/r/learndutch/comments/1n7uejc/apps_i_use_to_study_dutch_from_zero/,Apps I use to study Dutch from zero,"When I started learning Dutch, I wanted apps that felt light, fun, and actually helpful. Here are the ones I use daily for both conversations and NT2 exam prep:

**Conversation – Chickytutor, HelloTalk**

Speaking is always the scariest part when starting a new language. I use Chickytutor to practice speaking sentences whenever I feel like it. It's nice because I don't have to be shy or worry about mistakes. Then I go to HelloTalk when I want to talk with real people. Sometimes I exchange simple phrases about the weather (a true Dutch topic!), sometimes we chat about cycling routes or weekend plans. Both apps make it easy to practice without too much pressure.

**Foundation – DutchPod101**

Learning Dutch basics felt less intimidating with DutchPod101. The audio lessons are perfect for my commute, and they build gradually from absolute beginner to advanced. I usually listen to one lesson daily and repeat the phrases out loud. What I love most is how they explain not just the language but also Dutch culture and daily life situations. The lessons feel conversational rather than academic. After a few months, I noticed I could understand simple Dutch conversations around me. It's become my main resource for building a solid foundation.

**Vocabulary – Memrise Dutch**

Dutch vocabulary seemed tricky with all those compound words, but Memrise made it stick. The app uses videos of real Dutch speakers saying phrases, which helps me understand how Dutch actually sounds on the street. What I love most is seeing multiple speakers say the same phrase - it helps me catch different accents and speaking speeds. At first, I thought the mem (memory tricks) were silly, but they actually work. I practice during coffee breaks, and slowly my vocabulary has expanded to cover everyday situations. The spaced repetition ensures I don't forget what I learned weeks ago.

**NT2 Exam Preparation – Naar Nederland**

When I wanted to get serious about the NT2 (Dutch as a Second Language) exam, I found Naar Nederland really helpful. It's the official preparation portal with practice materials for all exam components. I like how it covers real-life scenarios you'll actually encounter in the Netherlands - from doctor visits to work situations. The practice tests show exactly what to expect in the real exam. Working through the modules daily keeps me focused on practical Dutch rather than just textbook language.

**Dictionary – Van Dale**

A good dictionary is always needed, and for Dutch I use Van Dale. It's the gold standard Dutch dictionary and works offline, which is super convenient when I'm out and about in Amsterdam. What's special is that it shows common expressions and phrases using each word, not just translations. The pronunciation audio helps with those tricky Dutch sounds like 'ui' and 'ij'. I also like how it shows diminutives and plural forms, which Dutch uses constantly. It makes looking up words quick and comprehensive.

**Reading – NOS Jeugdjournaal**

To improve my reading, I check NOS Jeugdjournaal daily. It's news written for young people, so the language is simpler but still natural Dutch. The topics cover everything from Dutch politics to international events, so I learn vocabulary across different areas. I read one article each morning with my breakfast. At first, I had to look up every third word, but after some time I noticed I could grasp the main ideas without constantly checking the dictionary. It's a nice way to learn Dutch while staying informed about what's happening in the Netherlands.

**YouTube – Listening & Review**

I also use YouTube as part of my learning routine. There are so many channels where you can listen to natural Dutch conversations, learn grammar, or review pronunciation. I sometimes watch Dutch vloggers like Dylan Haegens or Enzo Knol with Dutch subtitles, sometimes structured lessons from Learn Dutch with Bart de Pau or DutchPod101, depending on my mood. Dutch subtitles help me connect the sounds with the spelling (those silent letters!), which improves both my listening and reading at the same time. It feels less like studying and more like browsing YouTube normally, but I still pick up colloquial expressions and everyday Dutch every time I watch.",8,1756941976.0,learndutch,1,0.91,False

It was a magical place, a place where if one C6R5'd their favorite character, their favorite was guaranteed to seem OP in the end game. It didn't matter. Mavuika without Citlali, Skirk without Coffee, and Flins without Ineffa, all appeared godly before the throne of the abyss.

But then cameth the Onslaught Stygian.

Like the guillotines of the French Revolution, Stygian Onslaught violated the aristocrats of the whale, throwing them down from their lofty perch, and dragging them head-long into the debased misery of the meta.

No longer could a whale turn his or hers perfumed nose up at the meta. No longer were the C6 pullers able to scoff haughtily at the vulgar masses, flailing about in the squalor of having to care about team synergy.

No! Now meta actually mattered even for the whale. It was a devastating punch of the gut: calcs, spreadsheets, BIS considerations, and perfect timing were now all de rigueur if one wanted that sweet sweet cosmetic candy.

And thus endeth the reign of the meta-mocking whale. The end of a gilded age. May it Rest In Peace. 🫡",0,1756941925.0,Genshin_Impact,20,0.43,False

My partner (45 F) and I (48 M) have been together for about 2 years. She is not thrilled with me in social settings. I'm a bit of a people pleaser as well as a clown, but also pretty charming and a talker.  Think Chandler AND Joey (from Friends if that wasn't obvious). I employ self-deprecating humor as well as any type really to get a laugh. Sarcasm is in my bones.

She says she very often feels excluded and that I'm paying more attention to someone I just met (usually her friends I meet for the first time) and not her. I do try to include her but, very often fail. Sometimes a couple of minutes in I think she sees where it's going and will recoil so it becomes even harder to include her. I don't do this consciously and subconsciously having had many (most?) relationships where my friends and partner didn't get along I really want everything to be peachy and am probably way overcompensating.

For the record there is often alcohol involved which I'm sure toning down can help but that's definitely not the problem. It happens over coffee and whatnot, too.

I've found books on communication and people pleasing but they seem very generic and don't focus on including a partner in a group setting. Can anyone recommend a book that might help with this?  I guess any advice or podcast series would help as well.",1,1756941816.0,relationship_advice,6,1.0,False

I have a few of questions in regards to filtration and cleaning. And yeah I know I should have researched first lol. 

1. How often should you change the filters? Seimans recommends every 2 months. Is this really necessary?
2. Can you use any descaling tablets or Seimans brand only?
3. Can you use any cleaning tablets or Seimans only?
4. Is there any home remedies for making your own cleaning solution that would work with the cleaning mode. 

All the filters and tablets just seem like a lot of extra cost. Would like to minimise this if possible.

Thanks.

1n7u6sa,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnfrench/comments/1n7u6sa/apps_i_use_to_study_french_from_zero/,Apps I use to study French from zero,"When I started learning French, I wanted apps that felt light, fun, and actually helpful. Here are the ones I use daily for both conversations and DELF/DALF prep:

**Conversation – Chickytutor, HelloTalk**

Speaking is always the scariest part when starting a new language. I use Chickytutor to practice speaking sentences whenever I feel like it. It's nice because I don't have to be shy or worry about mistakes. Then I go to HelloTalk when I want to talk with real people. Sometimes I exchange simple phrases about daily life, sometimes we discuss French films or cuisine. Both apps make it easy to practice without too much pressure.

**Foundation – Busuu French**

Learning French basics felt overwhelming at first, but Busuu makes it really manageable. The app offers complete courses with native speaker feedback on your exercises. I usually spend 10-15 minutes daily working through lessons, and the progress feels natural. What I love is getting corrections from actual French speakers - it feels like having a tutor. The lessons cover practical situations, so I'm learning French I can actually use. It's just a nice way to build my foundation step by step.

**Vocabulary & Phrases – Frantastique**

French vocabulary always seemed hard to stick, but Frantastique made it more memorable. The app sends daily lessons wrapped in a story about aliens learning French culture. What I love most is how words appear in context: each lesson has dialogues, cultural notes, and personalized review. At first, I wasn't sure about the quirky approach, but after a few months, I noticed I could recall expressions naturally. I use it every morning with my coffee, and slowly my vocabulary has expanded beyond textbook French. The cultural explanations help me understand not just what to say, but when to say it.

**DELF/DALF Exam – TV5MONDE**

When I wanted to get serious about French certification, I found TV5MONDE's preparation section really helpful. It has practice exercises for all skills - reading, writing, listening, and speaking - organized by CEFR level. I like how the exercises use authentic French media, so I'm preparing for the exam while engaging with real content. The site explains answer strategies clearly, which is important because French exam formats can be specific. Doing a few exercises daily keeps me on track without feeling too",7,1756941428.0,learnfrench,0,1.0,False

So I’ve been talking to this woman at my gym for a little while. She’s 35, I’m 28 .She told me she’s planning to get a divorce — she and her husband “mutually agreed,” but she hasn’t filed yet and says she’s still looking for a lawyer.

Today I complimented on her workouts and she asked if i wanted to join,  we actually worked out together (core exercises), and afterwards I asked if she wanted to grab coffee for tommorow. She said *yes*.

Here’s the thing — she’s still married. She even has a kid. I’m not sure if she’s serious about divorcing, or if this is just her way of dipping her toe into something on the side. Part of me is excited she agreed, but another part of me feels like I’m walking into something messy.

Honestly, tomorrow I’m just trying to see how far I can go with this — more to test if she’s actually *down down* — but I don’t actually plan on taking it all the way.

what should I do here? Is meeting her for coffee crossing a line already? Should I back away until she’s actually divorced? Or am I overthinking it?

After ignoring red flags for months, I realize I’m getting frenemy vibes with(let’s call her Emily). 

This last occurrence happened with a group of about 8 mutual friends meeting up for a trivia night about a specific interest; it’s limited to a 2-hr window and it was an event single-handedly coordinated by me. 


Basically, only those into that topic would be interested in showing up. It was a nerd night- we were excited! She is not into that topic, but she showed up anyway and made the entire night about herself. 


Only 2 questions into our trivia, Emily starts with, “Real quick, I just want to apologize for having been distant with the group lately, but…” and she starts crying in front of all the ladies there - *who we barely know*.


Everyone instantly started consoling her, which led to more trauma dumping, which led to her telling us her entire past and crying for AN HOUR. 


No matter that I tried to redirect, there was no way to redirect without looking like a calloused jerk. But suddenly she half-attempts to apologize for “ruining your night” and she starts trying to READ off my questions FOR me.


Sorry, I’m just so angry still. 


I’m frustrated because I promoted it, I contacted everyone to come, made the reservations, researched the questions, made the printouts, paid for prizes and a giveaway basket - *and she only chimed in the day of, to say she was coming to an event she had no interest in.*


I’m frustrated because I took time away from a night with MY KIDS to be with a grown woman who just “couldn’t contain” herself.


I’m frustrated because we talk almost daily. The issue she cried about, she called me about *an entire month ago* at 9pm to cry about it. And again at 5am to cry about it. This was a month ago and it wasn’t a death or anything big; it was about her losing a thumb over her adult child.


The ladies she decided to have this emotional confessional with, we’ve only met a handful of times at this point.


An hour trauma dumping…About the adult child. About her mom. About trying to build a village and you girls are it. 


At some point, I couldn’t even hear her anymore. It just sounded like textbook love-bombing, “you guys are just the best; I don’t know what I’d do without you.” I just watched as everyone fawned and hugged her, telling her, “Let’s go get coffee any time, I’m here for you.”


And as I watched, it felt like that scene in Titanic where the emergency doors started slamming closed to contain the flooding to the hull. Like, everything in me flashing red and saying “GET OUT.”


We never finished the questions; I never got to give away the gift basket. Just went to pay my bill and wrap up. One of the ladies asked if I was okay as we hugged to part. 


Now, Emily has since blown up my phone, asking how I’m doing and I won’t respond. She’s tagged me in the group chat. Tagged me in the monthly events announcement. We had a girl’s getaway planned; she tagged me in that chat and I’m not responding because I’m no longer going. 


I just feel so sick about it…

They went back to school today. I asked him how his day has been and he said “good, I’m in the school pick up line right now!” 

As soon as he said that, it unlocked memories of waiting for my mom to pick me and my brother up. When I was in elementary school, I was routinely the last person to be picked up. I have several memories of waiting with the teacher or guidance counselor in the classroom. When I was in middle school, I remember waiting and waiting, and then pretending to walk home (but actually just wandering around nearby streets) so I wouldn’t have to make the teacher stick around. 

In high school, she said the pick up line was too busy and she had us walk to a nearby side street for pick up. We’d stand on the sidewalk for 1+ hours every day, rain or shine. At the time, she worked as a teacher aid at a school about 2 miles away that let out 30 min before our high school dismissal. After she arrived, she’d say she was talking to a coworker or just lost track of time. We weren’t allowed to walk/bike home, I wasn’t allowed to get my license until I was 18, and we didn’t live far enough for a bus. This was also before cell phones, so the uncertainty of timing made it difficult to wait in the school library.

My dad was still at work when school let out, but he was the same way about picking us up from practices or weekend activities. Last October, I went to visit my family in my hometown. They convinced me not to get a rental car from the airport and my dad promised to pick me up. I updated him as the plane was taking off from my layover. I’d taken a red eye and it was late morning when I arrived. When I’d landed and had my bag, I called him and he said he was about to leave home (15 min away), but had to do a few errands on the way. I stood there like an idiot for over an hour, holding the coffee I’d gotten him from Dunkin’. Should have just rented the car. 

I guarantee if I mentioned this to either of my parents, they’d deny it and I’d get yelled at for accusing them of such a thing, even as an adult.

Sugary things definitely make it worse. To the point where I don’t want to eat anything sugary. Which is probably for the best but I do crave certain things.

Today, I looked out and saw the landscapers that take care of my complex. The foreman was so incredibly beautiful. I didn’t stare but I looked back up and saw her dancing and lip syncing while working. Funnily enough I work with a competing company, and do the same thing. 
To make a long story longer I was just entranced.

I’d honestly just like to get to know her and even just be friends if it swings that way, from the few times I’ve seen her around she just seems genuinely cool.

Also there is like adhesive residue where a sticker may have been(?)

I was curious if anyone who has gotten coffee from them before can confirm if they include roast dates on their bags normally or not. It would be nice to know how long I should plan to rest this coffee.

my bf 20M had a friend 19M he cut of due to his own personal reasons, (things like his friend making fun of him in front of others etc). I 19F also didn't like this friend he was known for hiring people for (u know...) and a bunch of other things so when I found out he had cut him off obv a relief on my side.
Also be and my bf have been together almost 2 years.

Anyways turns out he got back in contact with him after a couple of months and he didn't tell me about it till later. And what he told me was 'I just added him to give him an explanation on why I did what I did because I felt bad' 
And honestly fair enough it's good to give others closure on things so I didn't care much. However I thought that was the end of it and I was completely wrong....

Wellll recently he's been telling me things like 'babe I'm just with my friend (says a random name)' which I had never heard this name before, and seemed really fake, I let it go. But then another time he mentions this mysterious friend again and sent me a video of this place they where at however in the background of the video I heard people speaking in MY native language (more context that friend he had cut of is also from the same place as me so I immediately knew he was with him) 
So I ask him to be honest with me and tell me who he really was with again, he lies to me. I then said I heard in the video who he was with which he asks what, and I tell him. His only response was 'haha u got me' in my mind all I'm thinking is why would u lie to me.

Anyways we get pass that, obviously I was annoyed about the lying, I told him the following day I would come over and he immediately goes 'no'. I asked why and he said he was going to a concert. 
Honestly all I can think of is 'what how long was this planned' and 'u didnt think to tell me'. He says he's going w the same friend he had cut off, and im just thinking like how did u guys become besties so quick like it takes time u know. he says 'no we only started hanging out this week'. (Again another lie I'll get into in a sec) 

Now fast forward a little maybe few days me and him go for a coffee date he's going on about the concert and the friends brother.... then his friends brothers gf and her friends. Which he didn't think to mention. The second I said 'what?' He immediately blew up at me saying why are u causing a problem they just showed up and I was like if their gf and friends where coming why not invite me also? He says he didn't know they would come and she usually isn't w them only seen her two/three times.
I ended up asking if I could then go to the clubs w them since they also invite their gfs so maybe I could come also he goes nah and honestly he was quite disrespectful about it so I left.

I ended up doing my own digging because nothing sat right with me. turns out he had been hanging out with this friend of his and the other girls going clubbing and what not for just over a month. He's told me if I really wanted to go clubbing I can go with my friends and if I happen to bump into them then sure. But he knows my friends are religious and don't go to the clubs so now I finally found a friend who I got into contact w to go to the clubs with and honestly I feel like I don't even care what he thinks because I really think he thinks I won't go.

What's some advice I can get.

Because she had cleaned her floor that morning. And he was scared because he had heard some fire works earlier. But he had gone potty earlier, so I assumed it was all out.

Threatened to beat me and my dog, this is the message ""if you bring that dog over here one more time I'm gonna beat your ass as well as his too. I am not fine with a dog peeing on my floor. Floors were done today.""

Yet her dog goes pee in the house if left alone too long. And her dog is 2, cane corso pit mix. I dont get it. He did pee on her couch one time because her dog made him too excited/scared, so he jumped on the couch and had a tiny accident, which i cleaned. I think its over the top, especially when her own dog isn't potty trained! I've been her niece for 18 years, since I am an 18f. 

TL;DR: aunt threatens to beat me and my dog because he had a minor accident. 

Edit: Problem is, her house is quite literally across from my grandma's, and my dog is a service dog in training, and I cant leave him behind. He only had an accident because she yelled at him. Im very non-confrontational, so I don't know what to do, I already apologized three times, and she's still fuming. Shes very old set in her ways, thinking a beating will help a dog not pee. Because she beat her dog with a shoe to stop her from eating shoes. Aunt already thinks its stupid for me to have a service dog, because she doesn't believe I have autism and a few other things. I dont care if you threaten me, but my dog? She knew I was gonna come over too, and that I have to bring him. She comes over every day around 3 or 4 times a day for coffee.

1n7tpjz,https://www.reddit.com/r/royalmail/comments/1n7tpjz/current_delivery_office_situation_and_advice/,Current Delivery Office Situation and Advice,"Hello to all the posties!

I was looking for a bit of advice before I think about my next steps/choices regarding working at Royal Mail. 

The current state of Royal Mail has been getting on top of me of late. I feel the delivery office where I work is in shambles (which is likely the same for all the others) and us posties are being made to pay the price. 

The current USO changes I feel are being used as an excuse as to why the offices are in disarray and that it should be expected. My argument in the first place is that if the trials are not working in 4 out of 5 offices (which is what our managers have told us) - why does it make sense to proceed with the changes anyway? 

Not only that but our management in the last few months have started to put extra oversized parcels onto us. The original agreement (so I was told when I first joined) that on the section where I work, we take extra loops that have been added on to original duties and the oversized gets taken off us and done by DPR drivers. Over the past few months we had to take 5, then 10, then 15, the 20, then all for most days of the week. This is on top of the normal sizes parcels we get. Yesterday on both walks we had a total of 140 small/normal sized parcels in our bags and 30-40 oversized parcels plus 8 loops each. This is from the managers getting rid of the DPR drivers and saving money by getting us to take them 

Some walks in the office have 6 loops plus absorbing loop plus oversized

Others like me have 8 loops plus oversized 

And some are getting away with just taking 8 loops 

This workload cannot be done on the part time hours I am contracted ( I am on the new contract too)

I don’t like to work over - I am not interested in overtime. It’s got to a point where I have to get in at least 1hr 30 minutes before my start time (unpaid) just to finish on time. 

I had a period where I thought no - I will come in on my time and finish on my time. I try to explain to the managers that the walk is too big to be done in normal contracted hours. 

So I came in on my time and finished on my time. I was bringing back anything from 4 loops to 1 walk of mail per day. Sometimes 2 if it happened to be a light day. They said as long as we clear all the tracked then that’s ok.

This happened for a week until the managers threatened to take me off the walk and put someone on there who is willing to clear !! Blackmail basically!! This is a walk that I have signed for?! Are they allowed to do this?

Because of that I have started coming in earlier again

Another issue I have is that I work in an office probably between 100-200 staff and there is about 5-8 managers. This is too manny for me. The amount of times they look after each other and have their own little laugh at the employees. You can see them loving it at how hard we are having to work. They sit on their backsides doing little coffee runs and grabbing some pastries from the shops happy cause their job is done. They like to remind us that they were once posties - but I guarantee that it was nowhere near as bad as now - but they wouldn’t have a clue how hard we work now.

It’s frustrating - I don’t know how they have kept their jobs for so long and how they get away with what they do. They all look after each other. I’d wish they would get rid at least half and employ more posties to help with the workload. Everything is underhand. They give all their favourites Saturdays off with no notice. And then try and get other posties to take extra loops on Saturday to clear. If I want a Saturday off I have to book it months in advance. 

A great example was a few weeks ago. On our section we were told that we had to take all our oversized. We kicked up a bit of a fuss and the managers said that everyone in the office had to take them and we weren’t the only ones. We later found out that they had lied to us and told the other section to take 10-15 oversized!!!! We found out and told the managers. And one of the managers had a go at the postie that told us they only were taking 10!! And made that postie take ALL their oversized just beacause they told us in a simple conversation!!  I mean you couldn’t make this stuff up it’s like being at school!!

The managers keep saying at the minute that there are 14 walks in the office that are failing. This means that they have started to take 1 person from covered duties and move them onto the walk that’s failing and help the postie who is flipping. This would leave my partner to go out on their own. Do all their loops off the one walk. And all the tracked on both walks and some if not all the oversized! Surely this isn’t right. They are solving one problem while creating another?!

They said that they have been given the green light to employ staff and that “the money is there to spend” so why haven’t they bought at least 14 staff to cover those duties. Or surely agency staff who they used to employ can help out temporarily while permanent staff are brought in?

This beings me onto the next frustration. The union rep is clearly too pally pally with the managers. I haven’t heard the rep stand up for us all one bit or try to stop them from doing it. I see them constantly joking and laughing with the managers. It’s feels like we are on our own. This is why if I make a complaint I would want to go above our union rep and anonymously try and sort these problems out. It makes me feel like you can’t raise a problem cause they look after each other. I have asked things before like “surely this is wrong?” “We shouldn’t have to do this” and the union rep just says “youve got to do that what they say” “they’ve said leave loops in so do that” - as if it’s just easy as that - they aren’t the ones having to take double mail out the next day!! 

Am I within my rights to refuse being moved? Or when I bring things back - they make you feel like you’ve committed a crime if you bring tracked back. Which I have never done as they are always hell bent on saying you can’t come back until all the tracked is clear. But to my mind someone’s NHS letter is more important than someone’s bloody SHEIN parcel!!!!! Prioritising the tracked when you are running out of time means more loops of mail I bring back.

The managers have said that we are about 30-40 staff members down from last year. This fills me with dread as Christmas is around the corner I can only imagine what it’s going to be like. We have already said we will have posties calling in sick or having time off for their mental well-being. 

The ONLY thing that keeps me going within Royal Mail is the floating week. Which I know some people aren’t fortunate to still have. If the floating weeks were scrapped in my office I would be gone

At the end of the day I am working near full time hours with a back breaking workload for part time pay

Currently the perk of the floating week still outweighs the crap I put up with 6 days a week but for how long I don’t know?

Any advice or thoughts would be great. Sorry for the waffle but I’ve been wanting to get this off my chest for a while 

Thanks guys

For the last 1-2 weeks, every time I use the bathroom, my pee has had a super pungent and intense smell. (TMI) it smells similar to a used tampon. It started right after my last period, but I can’t remember the exact day.
I’ve been doing a lot of research and have ruled a few things out:
I’m not dehydrated I drink tons of water daily and my urine is often very clear, but the smell still persists.
My diet hasn't changed significantly in the past few months. I haven’t suddenly started eating foods known to cause strong urine smells (asparagus, coffee, etc
I’m not sexually active (I’m a virgin), so it’s not an STI/STD.
I had a full panel of tests done in May (BV, yeast infection, UTI, etc.) and everything came back negative. I know things could’ve developed since then, though.
Other possibly relevant info:
My discharge is a normal texture and there is no unusual smells or colors
I’ve been on the Nexplanon birth control implant since March
I take Vyvanse, I paused it from May to August, and restarted on August 18
I had really intense cramps during my last period (some of the worst I've ever had), which was right before this smell started
I have no pain, burning, or other symptoms just the smell
I also looked into whether Nexplanon or Vyvanse could be causing this, but I didn’t find any clear connections.
Has anyone experienced something like this? Or does anyone know what could be going on? I’m really stumped and getting a bit anxious. I am thinking about making a visit to the doctor about this soon.

1n7tmz0,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1n7tmz0,Letting Go Of You (Looking for free link),"Chapter 1
 The day after my miscarriage, my husband, Austin Cadwell, asked me to donate blood for his beloved crush, Kayla Watkins.
 ""Doctor, her blood type matches. Kayla's had her blood before—no need to test, just use it,"" he said way too naturally.
 The doctor reminded him I needed to rest after my abortion, but Austin barely waited for the words to finish before dragging me off to have my blood drawn.
 ""Eloise Moreau, who do you think you're sulking at? Kayla getting your blood is a privilege,"" he spat, seeing my pale face as I gave him attitude.
 ""Draw more, doctor. She's healthy, make sure there's enough for Kayla,"" he insisted, ignoring my protests and the nurse's attempts to intervene, hauling me to the blood collection room.
 Afterwards, he left me there, weak and dizzy, and went straight to Kayla's room to look after her.
 I sat for a long time before I could summon the strength to stand and walk out.
 This time, I truly gave up. Austin didn't care about me at all—my life or death meant nothing to him.
 Years together meant nothing compared to his first love.
 If a marriage can't be held together anymore, it's better to let it go.
 ***
 Austin came home past midnight.
 He saw me sitting in the living room, tossed a bag of clothes at me, and headed for the kitchen.
 ""These are dirty. Make sure you wash them,"" he said.
 Inside the bag was one of Kayla's favorite shirts, something she'd been wearing a lot lately.
 If she didn't like it, she wouldn't have worn it twice.
 Once, Austin had dirtied one of Kayla's shirts and made me wash it for her.
 Afterward, Kayla asked what detergent I'd used—she liked the scent.
 Ever since, he regularly brought her clothes home for me to wash.
 Somewhere along the line, I'd become the live-in maid, responsible for everything he needed—his meals, his laundry, his home.
 He rarely came home before midnight, always blaming it on work dinners and social obligations.
 No matter how late I worked myself, I'd wait for him in the living room, with a late-night snack ready, afraid he'd come home hungry.
 He never once asked if I was tired, never wondered if I was exhausted. Sometimes, he'd even complain that the snack wasn't what he wanted.
 He took everything I did for granted, never truly caring about me.
 Just like today with the blood donation, if Kayla needed it, I was always his first thought. He acted like it was my duty.
 Every time he needed blood for her, he came straight to me, never hesitating.
 After coming home, I felt wrung out, drained of every ounce of strength.
 Suddenly, the kitchen erupted with the clatter of pots and pans—he must have been angry again.
 Austin walked over, staring at me with irritation. ""Why didn't you leave any food for me?""
 My head was spinning, my whole body aching. I had no energy left to answer.
 ""What are you upset about now?"" His tone was laced with impatience.
 ""Kayla was in a critical condition today. The hospital's blood bank was empty. I couldn't just stand by and watch her in danger. What's the big deal about giving a little blood?""
 Whenever it came to Kayla, everyone else faded into the background.
 No matter how I tried to explain, he never listened. He was always convinced I was just making excuses.
 He knew how much I loved him. As long as he apologized afterward, I'd forgive him.
 I was pathetic—a hopeless romantic, always ready to forgive, no matter what.
 That's why Austin never worried about hurting me.
 ""Enough. Tomorrow I'll have my assistant bring you something to boost your blood. Cook it yourself and get some sleep. And don't forget to make soup in the morning—Kayla wants the soup you make. I need to bring it to her first thing.""
 Hearing Austin's self-righteous demands, I almost laughed out loud from sheer disbelief.
Chapter 2
 Every time I make soup, I have to get up before dawn, letting it simmer on low heat for hours, just because Austin has stomach problems and I want to take care of him.
 Now, after my miscarriage, after giving her my blood, I'm still expected to wake up early and make soup for her.
 Austin was truly heartless. He doesn't even notice how pale I am, white as a sheet.
 Or maybe he does notice—he just doesn't care.
 A sharp pain twists through my abdomen, needles stabbing every inch of my body, but nothing hurts as much as my heart.
 Seeing me hesitate, Austin's expression darkens.
 ""Eloise, I've been running around all day. I'm exhausted. I come home to be with you, and you still give me attitude.
 ""Can't you be more considerate? What wife acts like you, always sulking at her husband? You're just making trouble for no reason!""
 I clutch my stomach tightly, but can't help letting out a bitter laugh.
 ""Maybe we should get divorced. You can go find someone more considerate.""
 ""Alright, alright, I'm not going to argue with you,"" he dismissed.
 I look up at Austin, only to see him staring at his phone, not even listening to a word I said.
 I don't need to look to know—it's Kayla calling.
 He grabs his phone and heads straight to the study, barely bothering to respond.
 ""Go get some sleep. Don't forget to make soup in the morning.""
 His eyes flickered to the surgical record from my miscarriage sitting on the coffee table, pausing for just a moment.
 But he still didn't say a word—not even a hint of concern.
 I sit there, half-listening as he comforts Kayla.
 ""Kayla, why are you awake? I only left after I saw you were asleep.
 ""Didn't you want Eloise's soup? I'll have her make it for you—I'll bring it over first thing in the morning.""
 His gentle tone feels like a knife, twisting deeper into my chest.
 I just lost my child, and he's busy caring for another woman.
 I found out I was pregnant four months ago. The whole pregnancy, I was on edge, terrified something would go wrong.
 The doctor said my health was poor, that I should rest as much as possible in the first few months to keep the baby safe.
 So I was careful, doing everything I could to protect this precious little life.
 I used to be healthy, but after donating blood to Kayla so many times, my immunity started to drop.
 This wasn't my first pregnancy. I had lost others before because of anemia.
 When I found out I was pregnant this time, I swore I'd do everything to keep this baby.
 Austin and I had known each other for seven years, married for five, and finally, we were going to have a child together.
 But because there hadn't been a child for so long, Austin's parents resented me. His mother never missed a chance to blame me.
 ""I never agreed to this marriage. A hen that doesn't lay eggs—the Cadwell family line is going to end with you.""
 Austin always looked at me with disappointment.
 ""Who knows when I'll finally have my own kid. You got pregnant and couldn't even be careful—now look what's happened.""
 During that time, the pressure nearly crushed me. I developed anxiety, couldn't sleep, and my hair fell out in clumps.
 I thought, finally, my suffering was over. I'd made it past the dangerous stage.
 But in the end, I still lost the baby. Maybe the child didn't want to be born into a family like this.
 I've completely lost hope for this marriage.
 Tomorrow, I plan to sit down with Austin and talk about getting a divorce.
 What I didn't expect was that the next morning, as soon as I came downstairs, I was met with Austin's angry accusations.
 ""Kayla, I'll be over soon. Be good and wait for me—I'll bring you breakfast.""
 His voice was gentle, soothing in a way I'd never heard before.
 I stood there, stunned, as he hung up and looked up, unexpectedly catching sight of me.
Chapter 3
 When he realized I'd come down from upstairs, Austin's face contorted in anger.
 ""You're just getting up now? Didn't I tell you to get up early and make soup? Is it really that hard for you?
 ""Can't you be a little more mature? Stop getting jealous and throwing tantrums all the time!""
 Looking at his smug face, I almost laughed out of sheer frustration.
 Every time he made a mistake, he'd find a way to blame me, accusing me of blowing things out of proportion and being irrationally jealous.
 I couldn't even be bothered to argue, turning to walk away.
 Suddenly, pain shot through my wrist as he yanked me back with such force that I stumbled and fell to the floor.
 Austin was strong—his grip hurt, and I couldn't steady myself before collapsing.
 He towered over me, eyes blazing with anger and impatience.
 ""Did I say you could leave? Stop pretending to be weak. Get up.""
 Cold sweat broke out across my forehead, and my face drained of color.
 A flicker of panic flashed across Austin's features.
 ""I didn't pull that hard. You're always making me angry—why can't you just be sweet like Kayla?""
 As he spoke, he bent down to pick me up.
 I tried to struggle, but he grabbed my hands and lifted me anyway.
 I kicked my legs, fighting back. ""Put me down!""
 ""Just behave. Stop squirming.""
 He set me on the sofa and fetched the first aid kit, tending carefully to the scrapes on my wrist, his expression gentle and his movements cautious.
 Once, that would have moved me.
 Back then, every little thing he did made my heart flutter, made me believe he truly loved me.
 He'd wait in line for hours to buy my favorite pastries.
 I only mentioned once how beautiful the marshes must be in the rain—and before I knew it, he'd bought tickets.
 He learned how to take better photos of me, showered me with compliments, and always tried to make me smile.
 Little by little, his sincerity won me over, and I agreed to marry him.
 Watching his serious face now, I couldn't help but wonder how we'd ended up like this. Out of the corner of my eye, I caught the glow of his phone screen—WhatsApp messages from the same contact with a heart emoji, clearly from Kayla.
 ""Austin, where are you? I'm craving pastries from Florian's Bakery.
 ""You skipped work to take care of me—won't Eloise get jealous? If she gets upset, I'll feel so guilty.""
 Florian's Bakery. So those pastries he always recommended, the ones he'd wait in line for, were actually his beloved crush's favorites.
 I used to be quiet and reserved, but somewhere along the way, Austin turned me into someone irritable and quick-tempered.
 He often came home at dawn, sometimes not at all, and whenever I was upset, he'd turn it around and blame me.
 ""I work my tail off every day, staying late at the office is perfectly normal! I'm doing all this for you, for our family.""
 At first, every time he said that, guilt gnawed at me. I thought I was just overthinking it.
 But he wasn't as clever as he thought. I knew the truth—he wasn't working late or out networking. He was with Kayla.
 Austin set a cup of supplement drink in front of me, putting on a show of tenderness.
 ""Drink up.""
 The supplement drink had been prescribed by a doctor long ago; every time I gave blood, he'd make me drink it, worried I'd be too weak for the next donation.
 After I found out I was pregnant, I stopped, afraid it might hurt the baby.
 Now, watching him go through the motions, I had no appetite at all. I shook my head. ""I don't want it. Just pour it out.""
 Austin's face darkened. He twisted my body toward him, trying to force me to drink.
 ""If you're not healthy, you need to take care of yourself. Stop being unreasonable.""
 The bitter, strange smell brought back memories of all those times I'd forced myself to drink it after donating blood. My stomach turned.
 ""I said I don't want it! Ugh—""
 I couldn't hold back the nausea. Tears stung my eyes, and my face grew even paler.
 Austin jumped up, furious, his voice harsh.
 ""Eloise! Stop being so ungrateful. I skipped work just to make sure you drank your supplement—isn't that enough? Can't you just listen for once?
 ""It's just a blood donation for Kayla! Why do you have to make such a fuss? Kayla's my good friend, she's not well—what's the harm in you giving blood a few times?
 ""I put work aside to comfort you, and you walk all over me. I've been too good to you, that's why you think you can get away with anything!""
 His temper flared, and he slammed the cup down.
 Shards sliced my cheek and arm, but the pain in my abdomen was worse.
 I took a deep breath, trying to steady myself. ""That's not what I meant. I don't care about you and Kayla, I just—""
 Before I could finish, another wave of pain twisted through my stomach, making me retch, though I hadn't eaten anything—only sour bile came up.
 Austin recoiled in disgust, stepping back and snapping, ""Eloise, can't you control yourself? That's disgusting. Why can't you just be a decent wife?
 ""You can't have kids, you can't take care of the house—what good are you to me?
 ""You're such a disappointment.""
 His words were merciless, blunt, and cruel.
 If he'd cared about me at all, he would've noticed something was wrong.
 But he didn't, and I didn't need him to anymore.
 I wiped my mouth with a tissue, brushing him off. ""Whatever you say.""
 Without another glance, I headed for my room, Austin's angry shouts echoing behind me.
 ""Eloise, can you stop making trouble every single day? I regret marrying you. You can't even give me a child, and all you do is make my life miserable.
 ""Go clean up, and don't call me unless it's important. I don't want to see you.""
 The front door slammed, and silence settled over the house.
 I lay on my bed, mind blank, and eventually drifted into a heavy sleep.
 When I checked my phone, there wasn't a single message from him, but I saw Kayla's latest Instagram post.
 A candid photo of Austin, captioned, ""Life is hard, but at least I have you.""
 The first comment was from Austin, ""It won't be hard as long as I'm here.""
 I calmly closed Instagram and called my doctor to confirm my appointment.
 Some ties should have been cut long ago. Loving myself is the only right choice.
Chapter 4
 The next day, I clutched my medical report and called my best friend.
 Just as I hung up and looked up, I suddenly saw Austin. Our eyes met, and for a moment, we both froze.
 I thought he'd come looking for me, and I was about to speak, but then I caught sight of the person behind him. I couldn't help but laugh at myself for being so naive.
 A flash of panic crossed Austin's face, but he quickly composed himself and stepped in front of Kayla, his expression sour.
 ""So now you're following me? Throwing tantrums at home wasn't enough for you?""
 Before I could respond, Kayla stepped forward and wrapped her arm around his, her voice sweet and pleading. ""Austin, don't be so angry. Look at Eloise—she's so pale. Maybe she's sick. Don't misunderstand her.
 ""Eloise, I haven't been feeling well, so Austin came to take care of me. You're so generous, I'm sure you wouldn't make a fuss over something so trivial, right?""
 Her innocent look made it seem like she was explaining herself, but I knew she was trying to provoke me.
 I didn't care anymore. My tone was calm, almost detached.
 ""Why would I be upset? Isn't it your job to take care of her, Austin?""
 I smiled, showing no sign of anger, but Austin's face suddenly darkened.
 He stared at me, as if trying to read my mind, but I wasn't bothered in the least.
 I walked right past them, heading to the pharmacy to pick up my medication.
 ""If there's nothing else, I'll be going.""
 I hadn't gotten far when Austin caught up and blocked my way, his eyes fixed on the report in my hand.
 ""What's wrong with you? When did this start? Why didn't you tell me?""
 I ignored him and tried to keep walking, but he grabbed my arm.
 I shook him off, my voice cold. ""It's nothing. It doesn't concern you.""
 But Austin wouldn't let me go, his tone tense, almost pleading.
 ""Eloise, I know I've been neglecting you lately, but it's not just my fault. You've been unreasonable from the start.
 ""And as your husband, you shouldn't keep it from me when you're sick.""
 He reached for the report, but before he could grab it, a pair of hands shoved him away.
 My best friend, Mindy Siebert, rushed over and stood protectively in front of me.
 ""What do you think you're doing? Eloise, how could you marry such a jerk? I'm not letting him get away with it today.""
 Austin stumbled back, drawing the attention of everyone nearby.
 Mindy had always been fiercely loyal, her temper short and fiery—she had never liked Austin.
 Her relentless tirade quickly clued everyone in to what was happening.
 ""What the hell? His wife just had a miscarriage, and now he's forcing her to donate blood to his mistress?""
 ""Scumbag. He's trash. Guys like him don't deserve a family.""
 Austin's face turned ashen, humiliated, and his anger boiled over.
 ""Crazy. No wonder you two are friends—just a pair of lunatics, biting anyone who gets close.""
 In the chaos, Kayla was shoved and slammed into the wall with a shriek.
 Seeing his precious girl hurt, Austin snapped and kicked out at Mindy.
 ""Bitch! How dare you touch Kayla!""
 Seeing what was about to happen, I rushed forward to shield Mindy, only to take the full force of Austin's kick in my stomach. I gasped from the pain.
 Agony twisted through my abdomen, and I curled up, clutching my belly.
 The pain was so intense I nearly blacked out, and blood began to pour out.
 The crowd panicked, shouting for a doctor. Even Austin abandoned Kayla and rushed over, frantic.
 ""Why did you get in the way? Why are you bleeding...?""
 I could barely breathe, the emotional and physical torment of the past days pushing me to the brink.
 Ignoring the hands trying to help me, I forced myself to shove Austin away, slamming the medical report into his chest. I couldn't hold back my scream. ""You wanted to know what's wrong with me? Look for yourself! Open your damn eyes and read it!""
 ""I had a miscarriage! Do you see it now?""
 Austin stared at the report, eyes wide, disbelief etched across his face. His voice broke with desperation.
 ""No, no, that can't be true. Babe, tell me it's fake. Tell me this isn't real!""
 ""That's just something Mindy made up, right? It can't be true!""
 ""Honey, please, tell me...""",4,1756940019.0,Novelnews,7,1.0,False
