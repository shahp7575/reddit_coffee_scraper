About me: 
- 28 years old
- 6 ft tall
- halfie 🇺🇸 🇵🇭 
- average-to-fit body type (SFW/wholesome pics on my profile!)
- big fan of good coffee shops, fantasy books, live music, and silly questions like this

I know that height doesn't actually matter to most women as much as some men seem to fear that it does. Still, I know that some ladies do find tall guys attractive 

What I am curious about is: why that is. In other words, what about a taller man is attractive to you? 

Of course, different people will inevitably have different preferences and perspectives. That's why I'm asking here - I'm interested to hear about some of those differences!

If you'd like to share, feel free to message me on here. Looking forward to it!

1gq6h24,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1gq6h24,Suggestions? ,"Looking for the folks who are particularly opinionated because I just can’t decide some of these things at the moment! 

1. Should I just paint this entire room either the lighter, greener teal or the darker teal (or neither)? 
It’s all one big room but I feel this need to differentiate the dining room from the living space. 

2. ceiling? Should I color drench or leave white? Should I add some sort of molding? 

3. I want to get a new TV stand and coffee table…. Does a lighter wood color make sense for both? 

4. What the heck should I do with the tiles around the wood stove?? 


Other notes: I’m looking for a new bookshelf option as well, and may move them into a different room entirely to more fully fill out this gallery wall unless I can find something that would work floor-to-ceiling. I’m also getting a new light that has a flush mount for the ceiling light to hopefully make the room look taller. 

I just want this space to feel more cohesive and intentional but I feel like I’m still in the “figuring it out” phase. 

Apologies for all the clutter! I had not cleaned until after I decided to take these photos. ",1,1731478308.0,maximalism,0,1.0,False

1gq6evy,https://www.reddit.com/r/NoSleepAuthors/comments/1gq6evy/what_i_thought_was_going_to_be_my_happily_ever/,"What I thought was going to be my happily ever after, quickly turned into my worst nightmare.. ","It started out like a scene from some dreamy romantic movie. I was in the cereal aisle, reaching for the last box of Cinnamon Toast Crunch, and her hand brushed mine as she reached for it too. I looked up to find myself staring into the warmest brown eyes I’d ever seen. She laughed, the sound soft and musical, and said, “Guess we’ve got the same taste.” She had this easygoing confidence, like she wasn’t a stranger but someone I’d known forever.

Her name was Kate. She was beautiful in that effortless way, with a quick smile and this energy that seemed to light up the air around her. Over coffee, I learned she was smart, funny, with a way of looking right at you like you were the only person in the room. That day led to a second date, and a third, until days turned into weeks, and I was hooked.

She had a mysterious edge, though, something she didn’t fully reveal. It was in the way she talked about her family, this tight-knit group of women who lived on a “homestead” tucked deep in the woods. “It’s like a haven,” she said. “No noise, no distractions. Just peace.” She smiled, but her eyes had this far-off look, like she was seeing something I couldn’t. Then, one night, she asked me to visit the homestead with her. She wanted me to “see her world,” as she put it. I didn’t hesitate—I would’ve followed her anywhere.

The drive was longer than I expected, and the forest seemed to close in tighter around us the further we went. We finally turned down a dirt road that snaked through dense trees, branches scraping against the car windows. It was almost dark when we reached the homestead, a cluster of cabins that seemed to appear out of nowhere, nestled deep in the shadows of the trees.

I’d expected some idyllic little village, but this place felt wrong, oppressive, like the air was thick with something unseen. Women stood in front of their cabins, watching as we pulled in, their expressions unreadable. Kate led me inside one of the larger cabins, handed me a cup of tea. I took a sip, but it tasted strange, metallic and bitter. The room spun, my vision blurred, and the last thing I saw was Kate’s face, her smile melting into a cold, unfeeling stare.

When I woke, I was lying on a cold, damp stone floor. My wrists were bound behind my back, my head pounding as I tried to focus. The room was dark, the air thick with the smell of mold and something metallic… something like blood. I struggled, called out, but my voice echoed back, hollow and empty. Then I heard a low, rattling breath from somewhere nearby.

“Quiet. Don’t draw attention to yourself,” came a voice, barely more than a whisper.

I twisted, straining to see, and finally spotted him—a man slumped in the corner, his face battered and bruised, his eyes hollow with terror. He looked at me, his gaze a mixture of despair and something else… recognition.

“They got you too,” he rasped, his eyes locking onto mine, then shifting, almost fearfully, toward the door.

“What… what is this place?” I managed, panic clawing up my throat.

He shook his head, voice trembling. “She told you her name was Kate, didn’t she?” He laughed bitterly, his voice like sandpaper. “Yeah, that’s what she told me too. Kate, Ashley, Mary… she’s used them all. It’s not her real name. None of them are real.”

A chill crept up my spine. I tried to argue, to defend her, but his eyes held a look that crushed every word before it formed.

“She and the others bring men here,” he continued, his voice hollow. “They lure us, charm us, bring us here like lambs to the slaughter. I’ve been here for days, maybe weeks… watching them kill.”

I barely had time to process his words before the door creaked open. Kate walked in, but she wasn’t the woman I’d fallen for. She was cold, her eyes as dark as the shadows pressing in around us. Two other women followed her, their faces as blank and hollow as hers. They grabbed the man, dragging him out of the room. His screams started almost immediately, desperate and raw, growing fainter until there was only silence.

When they brought him back, he was nothing more than a lifeless shell, his face twisted in horror. I felt bile rise in my throat as I looked away, fighting down the panic, trying to keep control.

Hours passed, maybe days. I barely ate, barely slept, every sound from above making me flinch, my mind unraveling as I waited for them to come back for me. I thought about my family, my friends, anyone who might notice I was gone. But the days kept dragging on, and my hope was slipping away.

Then, one night, a new prisoner arrived, a man no older than me, his eyes darting around like a trapped animal. I watched him, hoping he had a plan, but he was as lost as I was. And then, one night, he snapped. I watched as he managed to loosen his bindings and dashed for the door, his footsteps frantic as he bolted down the hall. I heard him shout as he made it to the clearing outside… followed by a single, echoing gunshot. His body hit the ground with a dull, final thud.

And then there was silence.

I’d given up. There was no hope, no escape. I was weak, broken, waiting for the inevitable. But then, in a desperate flash, I remembered my smartwatch. I must have triggered the emergency alert when I’d thrashed against my restraints. It was a long shot, but it was all I had.

I drifted in and out of consciousness, time slipping through my fingers. And then, faintly, I heard the sound of sirens in the distance. My heart hammered as red and blue lights flashed through the cabin windows, the harsh beams cutting through the darkness. Shouts erupted outside, doors splintered open, footsteps thundered above me. And then, hands were on me, lifting me, carrying me out.

As I stumbled out of the cabin, I looked back, and there she was—Kate, or whatever her name was. She stood in the shadows just beyond the reach of the lights, her expression as empty as the forest around her, her eyes meeting mine with a look that chilled me to the bone. She watched me as they led me away, and then she vanished into the trees.

The police found nothing but the empty cabins when they returned; Kate and the others had vanished without a trace.

I’m back in the city now, safe, but I still can’t shake the feeling that it’s not over. Late at night, I catch glimpses of her in crowds, feel her eyes on me from across a crowded street, see her smile in strangers’ faces. And I know, one day, I’ll turn around, and she’ll be there—waiting, ready to lure her next victim into the darkness.",1,1731478073.0,NoSleepAuthors,0,1.0,False
1gq6ekm,https://www.reddit.com/r/babylonbee/comments/1gq6ekm/elon_musk_declares_war_on_lazy_workers_in/,"Elon Musk Declares War on ""Lazy Workers"" in Government Efficiency Overhaul","In what can only be described as a classic Elon Musk move, the billionaire entrepreneur has made waves in his new role at the Department of Government Efficiency. In a stunning display of candor, Musk proclaimed that he has ""never seen such lazy workers,"" citing their shocking habit of working a mere 40 hours a week and routinely asking for weekends off.

""Honestly, who do these people think they are?"" Musk quipped during a press briefing, shaking his head in disbelief. ""I mean, do they expect to be paid for doing nothing all weekend? That's just not how we do things at SpaceX!""

Musk's groundbreaking first recommendation? To replace all government employees with his new Optimus robots. ""These robots will work tirelessly, never needing a coffee break or a day off,"" he declared, brandishing a prototype that he claimed could also help with household chores and occasionally walk the dog. ""Why should taxpayers fund a workforce that wants to spend their Saturdays lounging around?""

In a daring attempt to win over skeptics, Musk has proposed a unique incentive program: ""For every robot we deploy, we’ll throw in a free Tesla for the first 100 people who sign up for the robot replacement program."" Whether this will convince workers to embrace their mechanical counterparts remains to be seen.

As Musk continues to revolutionize government operations, one thing is clear: the future of work may soon resemble a sci-fi movie—complete with robots, endless productivity, and perhaps a few less brunches. Whether or not this is an improvement remains a matter of heated debate, but one thing is for sure: Elon Musk is here to shake things up, one robot at a time!",4,1731478038.0,babylonbee,0,0.83,False

Have no clue what his age or race was either. Usually, I would block these profiles but I felt extra lonely and horny last night. We ended up having a pleasant conversation and made plans to meet for coffee this weekend. Fast forward, it’s currently a little over midnight in NYC and this guy hits me up again. 

He proceeds to spam me with multiple video calls and I declined each one. Instead of blocking him, I told him to fucking stop. He proceeds to love bomb me calling me babe and sweet cheeks demanding that he sees my album again. Kept on sending me stupid directions to a nearby park where his car was parked.

1gq6bra,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmIOverreacting/comments/1gq6bra/aio_roommate_is_being_super_controlling/,AIO Roommate is being super controlling,"Hey so this is my first reddit post but I need some advice. I 18F and my roommate also 18F, we'll call her B for the sake of this post. Ever since I met B I was slightly off put by her as I noticed how controlling and rude she was to her parents as they were just trying to help us set up our dorm, I initially brushed off this behavior assuming it was first day jitters. The first week we pretty much lived separate lives and just would chat at the end of the day about our life updates. One thing important to note about B is that she is a woman of color and would constantly mention to me that she was glad I was supportive and respectful as a white woman as she doesn't often experience that. I always held space for her and also tried to mediate when our suite mates were being micro-agressive towards her. We started to become pretty close by the end of the first month but the closer we got the more off I felt about things. She began to make jokes about my deceased father's drug problems for starters, which I brushed off but at this point makes me sick to my stomach. I now am starting to notice how any time I would get into a fight with friends or even just a simple disagreement she would right away take my side and over defend claiming ""fuck them, they don't deserve you"". Whenever I would go on a date, even if it went well she would always discourage. It is now at the point where I only have two friends, one of which I hardly mention and the other she constantly tries to push me away from. She has made it so I have to depend on her fully. My biggest issue with her is often how she watches YouTube without headphones at all hours of the day and night knowing it disturbs my sleep and work heavily. She also would often insist I kept the lamp on my desk which is only a foot away from my face on till the wee hours so she could study. We have a really snippy dynamic with each other, which she started often making mean comments and I would match her energy trying to play along with the joke. 

The problems really started about a month ago when I got mono, I was completely bed ridden and really struggling. On top of the mono, I had just gotten on Prozac which made me have really bad suicidal thoughts and just feel terrible (I have since been taken off it), and so when I got sick I stopped taking it as I just couldn't handle it anymore. So I was sick as a dog and dealing with extreme mental health issues. She then one night after drinking two energy drinks and an obscene amount of coffee was freaking out to me about how her heart rate was elevated despite barely being able to talk due to how sick I was, I still went out of my way to comfort her and remind her that it was only elevated due to the stimulant. She then proceeded to keep me up all night saying she was worried she was going to die. After staying up all night with her I was exhausted and slightly furious with how insensitive she was. The next night she yet again asked I keep the light on for her, I snapped at her and said no due to the fact I was super sick and had not slept at all. This pissed her off completely and she started treating me like I was a total jerk. She would also constantly tell me to turn off my favorite movie when I was sick, I watch it to cope when I'm upset which she knows (I was wearing headphones and didn't make it obvious what I was watching). She legit would shame me for it. She also during this week made me talk her through a mental breakdown she was having about her mom picking her up a day late to go home, despite the fact my home is all the way across the country and I was having a mental breakdown myself all about missing my family and old life. 

She constantly threatens to damage my things when I annoy her, which is usually only in response to a cruel comment she makes. She has also said many times now how she could beat my ass if she wanted to. She also likes to verbally blackmail me. Another problem is a while ago now, in the middle of the night she woke me up by having a full conversation by herself. I know for a fact I wasn't dreaming because I both got up to use the restroom and also texted my best friend from home saying how pissed I was. The next day I confronted her about her behavior and she swore up and down she wasn't talking. Claiming she was at most watching YouTube with her headphones on, that night I fully had a panic attack because I genuinely started to feel like I was going crazy. But now I'm realizing she must have been lying because she never watches anything with headphones also I know her voice incredibly well so idk how to feel. She knew how fragile I was and yet she pulled that making me feel insane, and then kept telling me I had to tell my psychiatrist about my 'hallucinations'... 

I'm really stressed as she keeps me up most nights and is always trying to pick a fight with me. But also because of everything I now don't have many friends which she constantly reminds me of, making it clear she is all I have..",1,1731477733.0,AmIOverreacting,0,1.0,False

I think it will look really beautiful assembled. It’s artistic. This is it. This is going to be my first project. Officially. Research begins tomorrow. 
My night took an unexpected turn. I talked on the phone for three hours with my best friend. Things have been quiet between us since June. I was adjusting to my new life. She was adjusting to her new life. We just haven’t been as tightly in contact over the last half year. But tonight we caught up for real. We laughed. We cried. We reminisced. It was so nice. I miss her so much. We were really honest with each other about things in a way we have never been honest with each other and it was so nice. For a little bit I was worried that our friendship had not grown with us but, it had. We just hadn’t talked about it yet. 
I love her so much. So much. I wouldn’t be alive without her. She saved me during one of the most terrifying, painful, lonely experiences of my life. One time, I was broken hearted in the worst kind of way. I couldn’t get out of bed. I couldn’t eat. I couldn’t shower. I just cried. A lot. And I think I was drinking still back then. It’s hard to say. Anyway, I kept telling her that I needed coffee creamer but I wouldn’t leave my house or order it. For three days she asked me multiple times a day whether I had gone to the store for coffee creamer. Eventually she called me and said “Mmk. Your time is up. You need to walk to the store and get creamer now”. And I did. And it was like that. Sometimes I’d call her because I couldn’t figure out what to eat and we would walk through it. That’s how much she loved me. I love her. We have certainly had a few ups and downs. But I don’t think we will ever not know each other or be best friends.

I work at a haunted house every Halloween. Not as an actor scaring people, but as the 'nurse' – the person who deals with the aftermath of scares. Here's a behind-the-scenes look that might just hit the front page for its mix of humor, terror, and human moments:

TL;DR: Being the 'nurse' at a haunted house gives you a unique perspective on human reactions to fear, from the hilarious to the heartwarming.

The Job Description:

My role is to help people who've had too much fright, got hurt (yes, it happens), or just need a break from the terror. I'm stationed in a corner that's supposed to look like a makeshift medical tent, but with a spooky twist, of course.

The Scare Spectrum:

The Comical Overreactions:
One time, a grown man literally jumped into my lap, thinking I was part of the scene. He apologized profusely once he realized I was there to help, not haunt.
The Genuine Fright:
There was this kid, maybe 12, who was visibly shaking. His friends had dared him to go through alone. I spent 20 minutes calming him down, teaching him some breathing exercises, and he left with a smile, albeit a sheepish one.
The Unexpected:
A girl twisted her ankle running from a chainsaw-wielding clown. As I was wrapping her ankle, her boyfriend proposed right there in the 'medical tent'. She said yes, and they left with her hobbling on one foot, him carrying her other arm, and a ring on her finger. Talk about memorable!
The Heartwarming:
An elderly lady came through with her grandchildren. She got a bit overwhelmed in the dark, narrow corridors. I walked her out, and she thanked me by giving me her favorite candy, a Werther's Original. She said it was for being ""an angel in a place full of devils.""
The Philosophical:
A college student, after being scared out of his wits, sat with me discussing the psychology of fear, why we enjoy being scared, and how it relates to our need for adrenaline in everyday life. We ended up exchanging numbers to continue the conversation over coffee.

The Lessons Learned:

Fear brings out the most unexpected reactions in people. From tears to laughter, from proposals to philosophical discussions, you see humanity in its rawest form.
People often need a moment to remember that fear can be fun, but it's okay to step back when it becomes too much.
Even in the scariest environments, kindness prevails. Whether it's sharing a candy, helping someone through their fear, or proposing in the most unconventional setting, there's always a silver lining.

1gq67wy,https://www.reddit.com/r/solotravel/comments/1gq67wy/trip_report_a_week_in_london/,Trip report: A week in London!,"I posted here a couple months ago asking for advice on my first trip to London. [Here is a link ](https://www.reddit.com/r/solotravel/comments/1f24jsf/please_critique_my_tentative_solo_london_itinerary/)to the post for anyone interested.

My trip was amazing, and I definitely utilized the advice I got here! I went into a lot of detail about my travel style and preferences in the previous post, but just to summarize: Female early 30s, like to wander and explore neighborhoods, don't really like churches or nightlife, vegetarian. I like to mix up my meals with market food, some nicer or unique restaurants, and local chains. I also LOVE checking out local grocery stores, and this trip did not disappoint!

* Day Zero (Saturday)
   * I landed at Heathrow around 1 pm. Set up my esim and navigated to the Elizabeth Line pretty easily. Citymapper was an absolute must for this trip - I used it everyday for all kinds of public transit.
   * Transferred to a bus at Paddington to get to my hotel (normally is accessible by the underground but there was planned maintenance that closed the station closest to my hotel for the first couple days I was there). I ended up at Paddington a lot this trip and it was not my favorite lol, just very big and busy.
   * Checked in at the [London House Hotel](https://www.londonhousehotels.com/). Overall this hotel was fine and fit my needs - good location, clean, not expensive. The only real downside was that the walls were very thin. I could hear everything happening in the hallway outside my room. This didn't end up being a big issue other than one night where I was woken up by some loud people in the hallway.
   * After getting situated at the hotel I went out to explore! Notting Hill is so cute, I loved the whole vibe. I went to the Portobello Road Market, but pretty quickly moved to quieter side streets as it was too overwhelming in my sleep-deprived state (spoiler I ended up going back later.)
   * Had an early dinner at [Rosa's Thai](https://rosasthai.com/), which was lovely. At this point I was ready to crash so I went back to the hotel for the night.
* Day One (Sunday)
   * I got up nice and early to get in a full day of sightseeing! I started with a coffee and pastry from [Blank Street](https://www.blankstreet.com/), both of which were great.
   * I took my coffee to go and had a long meandering walk through Hyde Park. Absolutely loved this, it was so beautiful and peaceful in the morning - that is, until I started noticing more and more groups of runners starting to congregate. Turns out this was the day of the Royal Parks half marathon! I think this particular area of Hyde Park was the start of the race. The running route was all through Westminster, so I kept coming across it as I made my way around. This was slightly annoying as certain crosswalks were blocked off, but because it was so early the race hadn't actually started yet. This meant no cars and no runners, so I was able to stand in the middle of the road and get some nice pictures. Eventually the race did start, and it was actually really fun to watch for a bit and see everyone cheering for the runners.
   * I went from Hyde Park to Buckingham Palace, then walked down the mall to Trafalgar Square. From there I went down Parliament Street hoping to spot Larry the cat at 10 Downing (no luck). Took some pictures and admired Big Ben and Westminster Abbey.
   * I crossed Westminster Bridge and took my time walking along the south side of the Thames. I timed this so that I ended up at Borough Market right after it opened - no lines! I spent a long time looking at everything before getting the mushroom risotto, which was so good! At this point it was getting busier so I found a curb on the edge of the market to sit and eat.
   * After eating and just chilling for a bit I went to the London Bridge City pier to catch an uber boat to Greenwich! I bought my one-way ticket using the ThamesClippers app, but I think you could just do contactless tap like the underground(?). The boat was nice, it felt good to sit lol. The ride to Greenwich was not long, maybe 20 or 25 minutes? That could be wrong but it was definitely not long.
   * I walked up the hill through Greenwich Park and checked out the Royal Observatory, which was very cool (if you're into that kind of thing). I spent a decent amount of time looking at everything, and then spent like an hour and a half sitting in the cafe because I needed a break. 
   * I then wandered around Greenwich with no real aim. It's such a lovely place! I ended up at the Greenwich Market, and checked out some of the chain shops - Waterstones, Boots, etc. I know this probably seems funny to those in the UK but I just find it so interesting to see how they differ from my usual stores!
   * This was also my first Marks & Spencer experience and you guys, I get the hype. I wanted to buy so much of the food. I decided to try some classics so I got a bag of Percy Pigs and some mini Colin the Caterpillars. Don't hate me - I didn't love the Percy Pigs. They were fine, but I've never been into gummy candy. I do love chocolate, so Colin was my favorite of the two.
   * Finally, I went to have Sunday roast at [Richard the First](https://www.richardthefirst.co.uk/)! I chose this pub specifically because it had good reviews of its vegetarian Sunday roast. Everyone was friendly and I was served quickly. The food was great and I'm happy I got to try something (somewhat) traditional!
   * I took the DLR back into Central and then switched to the underground. I knew nothing about the DLR but it came up on Citymapper as the quickest option back so I went with it. I love when cities have lots of transit options!
* Day Two (Monday)
   * This was the only day I had to deal with some bad weather, which I know was pretty lucky. It did cause me to rearrange some plans but it wasn't a big deal.
   * I had an amazing breakfast at [Tab x Tab](https://tabxtab.com/). I got the grilled halloumi, poached eggs and avocado on toast, which I highly recommend. I took my time here and had a couple lattes as it was raining and I wasn't in a hurry.
   * I used the rain as an excuse to check out Waitrose and Tesco. My biggest takeaway: the meal deals!!! I knew about them already but it was different to see in person. So many options! I also love how there's so many ""meal for two"" dinner specials. Also, Heinz has a much more expansive set of products than I ever knew about. Who knew Heinz made pasta sauces? Not me.
   * It was still raining so I decided to postpone my original plan of walking along the mini Venice canals and instead went to [Daunt Books](https://dauntbooks.co.uk/) in Marylebone. This is a must for book lovers, I really enjoyed it!
   * The weather had calmed down a bit so I took the tube up to Hampstead to explore. I can totally understand why people recommended Hampstead, it was picturesque! I wish the weather had been better so I could spend more time wandering around. I did have a lovely afternoon pastry and coffee at [Heath Street Bakehouse](https://www.heathstreetbakehouse.com/).
   * I then walked over to the heath, and made my way up Parliament Hill to check out the view. It was all so beautiful and again, I would've spent more time here with better weather.
   * I took the bus into Kentish Town to get a late lunch at [Queen of Sheba](https://www.thequeenofsheba.co.uk/). This was a recommendation I got from my previous post and it was great! Ethiopian food was new to me and I really enjoyed it.
   * From here I went back to the hotel to chill for a couple hours, then get ready for my evening plan, which was seeing Book of Mormon! This was one of the best experiences of the trip, it was such a great performance. It was at Prince of Wales Theater, which was small enough that even my seat in one of the last rows had a great view.
   * I ended up not having dinner this day as I was still full from the late lunch. However, I didn't know about the West End tradition of ice cream at intermission! I couldn't pass that up.
* Day Three (Tuesday)
   * I originally had this day set as a day trip in my itinerary, but I decided I needed more time in London.
   * I started the day at [Layla Bakery](https://laylabakery.com/) for a coffee and pastry. This place is so cute! Probably my favorite bakery of the trip. They had just reopened with their fall menu and I got a pumpkin and manchego cheese pastry - amazing!
   * I did some more wandering around Notting Hill and admiring the cute houses. I also ordered some empanadas from [De Nadas Empanadas](https://denadas.co.uk/) to go so I could take them to my next destination, Richmond!
   * The tube out to Richmond was a little more complicated, I had to get off and cross the street to a different station(?), but still on the District line. Again, Citymapper made this easy and I had no problems.
   * I'm a Ted Lasso fan so I was excited to see Richmond. I went out to the Richmond Green and ate my empanadas on one of the park benches. 
   * Someone on the Ted Lasso sub put together a self-guided walking tour that hit a bunch of the filming spots, so I used that as a guide. It was a beautiful walk around such a cute little place! I also hung out at the riverside for a while which was nice, but I did have to deal with a drunk guy who wouldn't leave me alone. This is pretty par for the course as a solo female traveller but still annoying. 
   * I dipped as soon as I could and went to [Kiss the Hippo](https://kissthehippo.com/) for an afternoon coffee. From there I went to the Ted Lasso souvenir shop, and finished up with a gelato at [Gelateria Danieli](https://www.gelateriadanieli.com/). 
   * I made my way back to the hotel and accidentally took a nap, lol. It was time for dinner by then so I pulled myself together and went to [Govinda's ](https://govindas.london/?gad_source=1)in Soho. I was looking forward to this as the reviews online were great. The food lived up to the hype, delicious and cheap. However the restaurant itself was packed and very warm, so overall pretty uncomfortable. I ate quickly so I could escape the heat. I ended the night just walking around Soho. Even on a Tuesday night the streets were crowded and I found it pretty overwhelming. I went back to the hotel and ate some Colin the Caterpillars for dessert.
* Day Four (Wednesday)
   * Started the day with a coffee and pastry at [Gail's](https://gails.com/?srsltid=AfmBOorS5m0kOpHcRlS0IxuZDPAQsafyFd8tGk7C5xpWzHGdQyB8niDe). I then took the tube out to Tower Hill. I was a bit early for my Tower of London reservation so I walked along the river a bit and just admired the view.
   * I did the free Yeoman Warder tour to start, which was great! Definitely recommend. I then explored everything else on my own, which I think took a couple hours. I found all the history interesting, but I imagine someone more into it than me would take more time.
   * It was roughly noon when I left the Tower of London, so I walked to [Roti King](https://rotiking.com/food-drink/) for lunch. Wow, this place was amazing! So simple, just roti and dahl, and so so good. Also, where has milo been all my life?! 
   * I walked around Spitalfields Market for a while, just checking everything out. I then went to the [Brick Lane Vintage Market](https://www.vintage-market.co.uk/), which I really enjoyed! I bought a sweater and some candles.
   * I then walked over to [Horizon 22](https://horizon22.co.uk/). I booked my ticket ahead of time but I'm not sure how necessary that was. The view was beautiful and I enjoyed it. It was a bit crowded but the space was big enough that it didn't really matter.
   * I was tired of walking at this point so just went back down to the river and sat for a while, just people watching. I also got an ice cream from a cart outside the Tower of London but I can't remember what it was called!
   * I then made my way over to [Tayyabs](https://www.tayyabs.co.uk/) for dinner. So so so good, highly recommend! I wished I was with more people so we could order more and share everything.
   * Back to the hotel for the night, finished off the Colin the Caterpillars.
* Day Five (Thursday)
   * This was my day trip! I booked a tour of some of the Cotswolds and Oxford through [London Walks](https://www.walks.com/). Most of their walks are for a few hours around various areas of London, but they have some longer trips that go outside the city as well. This was a nice break for me from planning and navigating. I had a great time, even though most of the others on the tour were in couples or groups. 
   * We went to Minster Lovell and Burford in the morning and Oxford in the afternoon. I'd love to go back and see more of the Cotswolds. I'm really glad I took a day to see more of England outside of London.
   * On the train home I placed an order at the [Pizza Pilgrims](https://www.pizzapilgrims.co.uk/) near my hotel. Picked it up on my way back and had a hotel room feast (something I consider a must on vacation).
* Day Six (Friday)
   * This was my last day, and I didn't have any real plans. I went to [Arome Bakery](https://www.instagram.com/aromebakerylondon/?hl=en) for breakfast and got probably the prettiest pastry I've ever had (chocolate and pistachio escargot). I think it has to be a tie between Arome and Layla for best bakery of the trip.
   * I then walked through Regent's Park and walked for a bit along the canals like I had planned to earlier. It was a very misty and quiet morning which made for a lovely walk. 
   * I then went to check out Camden Market. I can understand why people think its too touristy and commercialized, but I still enjoyed walking around. Also got the craziest masala fries from [Funky Chips](https://funky-chips.com/)! I didn't know before going but I guess this place has gotten pretty popular on tiktok. I can understand why, the portions were huge and I still ate almost all of it.
   * From here I decided to go back to Hyde Park, since I enjoyed it so much earlier. I also went to Tesco for a candy haul (a truly embarrassing amount of candy). Afterwards I went back to the hotel to get a head start on packing up all my stuff and to chill for a bit.
   * I then went back to truly check out the Portobello Road Market. It was crowded but definitely worth it, I loved looking at everything! I bought a print from a local artist, which is something I try to get everywhere I go.
   * I had a reservation this night to have dinner at [Dishoom](https://www.dishoom.com/). It was delicious and the atmosphere was great (I went to the Kensington location). Again, wished I was with more people so I could've tried more things.
   * From Dishoom I walked to [Oddono's](http://www.oddonos.com/) for some truly great gelato (on par with what I've had in Italy).
* Day Seven (Saturday)
   * I checked out of the hotel and booked a taxi to St. Pancras using the Freenow app, which worked really well. Definitely recommend if you're planning to use taxis in London.

And that was my trip! I know I didn't hit a lot of the usual museums and galleries, but they just weren't my top priority. When I go back (and I will someday!) I'll check some of them out. There was just so much to do and see! Public transit was amazing and made everything so accessible. 

I know this is a massive post, but I hope it helps someone else planning a London trip, just like the other posts I found here did for me!

1gq6703,https://www.reddit.com/r/AlchoholicsAnonymous/comments/1gq6703/please_help_me_and_tell_me_where_i_should_start_i/,Please help me and tell me where I should start? I need the guidance. ,"I don't know why I am here, but I feel this is where I need to be in order to get started.  33M.

So, I will just post my story and see if anyone can push me in the right direction.

I drink anywhere from 6 to 12 beers a day. This has been ongoing for at least 6 months and its time I face reality instead of ignoring it. Long overdue conversation.

6-12 beers daily, craving a beer by 11am, that's a problem. Fully able to look in the mirror on that.

I just don't know where to start in order to address it.

My wife is an angel. She drinks, absolutely no where as severe as me. Sometimes I wish she would kick me in the ass and give me a wake up call that I need because I am too weak to handle it on my own.

My problem is that liquor doesn't affect my life in anyway besides it being an addiction, terrible for my health and a money sink.

I am not angry drunk. I have a great job. Fully functional adult... I just drink more than I should. And that is my pathetic excuse for why I do it.

If there is no impact on how I treat my partner, job, friends, hobbies, etc, what's the harm? Kind of thing.

The harm is actually getting too comfortable with it and falsely justifying it.

But my health is at risk. I honestly cannot remember the last day I went without a beer which is fucked up to think about.

I do feel the affects on my body. I am not as sharp. I am slow. I process things slower mentally. My hobbies are sports related and I used to be an all-star (in comparison to relative competition). But now? I can't even stick handle a puck.

I have tried toning it down... But fuck me the withdrawal is terrible. I don't know anything about this stuff but I want to get back in control of my consumption. Its like as soon as I finish my coffee, I want to crack a beer afterwards.

I work from home... Its been a god sent for my mental health. I like the freedom and lack of commute, huge benefit. But the side effect is the freedom. I would never sip on a beer in an office... But at home? Whose watching, who cares? Terrible shit mindset. The freedom and no self control is killing me.

Honestly, at times I wish my wife would just put me in my place and discipline me, challenging it. But I also know its all on me to address it.

Part of why I drink...

* To escape. Fucked up past, mostly resolved but bits an pieces unresolved.
* To treat myself. Hard past, I should reward myself.
* Not toxic, probably more enjoyable to be around while having a buzz on.
* In a position where I have freedom to live my life how I want.
* Pressure in my relationship. She's a catch but sometimes I feel I can't keep up to it so I drink to combat those insecurities.
* Expendable money. Got the cash to blow on what I want in life, just going to the wrong things.

I have a big time addictive personality... Doesn't matter what I do, there is an additive side to it. Doesn't matter if its sports (I play on 3 hockey teams per season), video games, sex, liquor, weed, coffee, chocolate, movies, programming, golf, vaping, writing, biking, etc... Whatever I do, I am consumed by it... I just happened to direct that addiction to liquor which is bad.

Sometimes that addictive personality pays off when its used for productive and healthy stuff, other times its the bane of my existence. Sometimes a strength, sometimes a weakness. Just depends where I direct it to.

I have been slowly trying to replace addiction with another, sometimes works. Occasionally I will drink gingerale all day instead of beers. I rather have that then alcohol. Right now, that is the only way I am handling this, replace the addiction with another. 

Anyways... No clue on where to start but I need to get this crap out of my life because its ruining my mental health and body.

If you come this far, I thank you and please push me in the right direction, I desperately need it.",1,1731477226.0,AlchoholicsAnonymous,0,1.0,False

I didn’t get my period until I was 16. I was usually irregular but I always got a period every month, sometimes twice in a month. In 2019 I went on birth control because I took a plan b and got my period for 2 months straight at the age of 19. Yes I said 2 months straight. 60 days. I was then on birth control until 2021. the combo pill. When I went off of it to get skinny, it worked. I lost the water retention weight, but my boobs and my hips were huge. 

To my surprise, my periods were extremely regular off the pill and I would get them every month, no pain, no cramps, everything was normal. In 2022 I went to the gyno for the usual check up. everything was still perfect. A year later I was in my prime. Skinny, hot, everything was great. But I realized I had skipped a period month, and noticed my period was irregular for about 3 months. I was also going through extreme stress. The symptoms started at this time. 

I rapidly gained about 10 lbs of weight. The same 10 lbs would fluctuate. I looked terrifyingly bloated in the face, wide neck, hump on neck, hair pattern changes on body/head, no definition in waist, extreme bloating in upper and lower stomach area, and I would throw up in the morning and after eating food. I had bad cramps during periods now, I felt fatigue every single day of the month, sleep apnea, insomnia, woke up feeling like I didn’t sleep all night (my watch would calculate 4 hrs of sleep even though I “slept” for 8) bags under my eyes and major headaches/migraines in the morning, with extreme night sweats and waking up at 4 am with nightmares. ontop of this I was very moody and developed anger issues. I very hormonal as well. something was off balance every day. BUT I was still ovulating and still getting a period. 

I booked an appointment with an endocrinologist and after she immediately suggested medicine and the non fda approved inositol, and to stop eating white rice and other carbs, I pushed for us to approached the holistic route before starting anything.

We took blood tests. My testosterone was high, high cortisol, all forms of high cholesterol, high fatty liver, everything you could think of. BUT, the major things like Ac1, Thyroid, and insulin all came back normal. Why was this? Does this mean adrenal pcos? We ruled out cushings at the endo as well with a steroid test. I tried yoga, meditating, low intensity workouts, ovasitol and vitamins, I stopped drinking coffee on an empty stomach, I cut out gluten and dairy for a while so that I wasn’t so inflamed. I was still struggling. Ovasitol gave me a raging headache and made me feel faint/lowered my blood sugar too low. Working out with light intensity still stressed out my body. I ate extremely clean whole foods. I limited my alcohol. If I messed up 1 day of this lifestyle I was back at square 1. This was no way to live. My body’s anxiety and stress levels were at its max. Still nothing moved in the blood work. I went to the allergist and she diagnosed me with a soy allergy and other common allergies, but not wheat. Most women with pcos have soy intolerance and gluten.

Each day that went on unmedicated I started to look and feel worse and worse and felt helpless. After the ultrasound confirmed I had pcos, I was prescribed a combination birth control pill. This did not fix my high testosterone. Before starting medication we tested again. My advanced lipid panel was all bad/red, so was ALT, testosterone, cortisol, vitamin d was at the bare minimum 
range of 31, the average lowest being 30. My FSH was normal… DHEA was normal, LH was normal, estrogen normal as well. What is going on??? I then made the choice to take spironolactone after trying to lower testosterone and stress again…my remedies were not making any difference. 

The first day I took the birth control I woke up feeling like 1 million bucks. My blood work started to get better after the 3 months. I realized I went from 180 to 202 after starting birth control and spironolactone. My face, neck, arms, stomach, lower body all blew up like a balloon even thought spironolactone is supposed to be a diurect. It was then that I started tirzepatide at 5mg and have been on the same dose for months now. I have shed 20 lbs. I felt better, my clothes fit better, and i’m still fluctuating in weight. When I take the tirzepatide I feel sick, my birth control and spironolactone aren’t absorbed all the way, so mood swings still occur, my hormones may not be exactly balanced as they should, the spironolactone fluctuates my breast size and heart patterns due to absorbtion, and my cortisol still remains high. Still no cushings.

So now, i’m stuck on birth control and spironolactone with slight heart palpitations and I would like to have children eventually. I am afraid to get off of both of these until I want kids. All of my symptoms will become worse when I get off. I am also scared of the risks that untreated pcos can have on future fertility and overall well being.

I came back maybe 15 minutes later to put the lid back on and she was totally gone. I panicked, I was terrified to move anything at all for fear of squishing the tiny little baby on accident. So slowly and methodically I moved one thing after another out of the room inspecting everything as best I could to absolutely no avale.

We have two kids. She's put on weight for a variety of reasons, some medical. I don't care. But she does. And I think it's making her lose confidence, which exacerbates the weight gain (like she feels down so can't be fucked eating healthy today etc).

She has a therapist for things. She exercises. I tell her all the time how attracted I am to her. She knows this. We have a healthy enough sex life.

So I thought, you know what would make me feel confident? If some lady my age approached me for a bit of a flirt, right? Of course, I'm happily married and would make that known, but the approach would boost confidence.

But I don't want to leave these things up to chance. So say I pay a dude to approach her somewhere she frequents. Just a casual hi. What's your name. You look good. How about we get a coffee.

I've known this Algerian woman for several years at this point, we met in college and began talking more often in 2020. We had gone out to several museums together, I'd always bring her something or buy her ticket if we had to reserve it for a gallery. She'd insist on buying her own food if we ever got anything to eat.

As a Balkan guy in the US I grew up around a decently sized Arab community and am a Muslim (by conversion), so I'd like to think I'm at least somewhat culturally aware? She's told me her parents aren't pressuring her about getting married and she isn't seriously looking for a partner, which I respect. she does seem to text me a lot, and call me frequently. We've bonded over helping her find a job, our love of art and music, we seem to get along really well. 

 She doesn't judge me for my blindness, encourages me to better myself, doesn't seem that materialistic (though this isn't a huge deal) and has a lot of ambition. When she went through hard times finding a job in the US and contemplated moving back to Dubai or France, I encouraged her to keep putting herself out there and not give up on her goals.

What sparks this post is that earlier this year I was traveling through the city where the two of us used to live. I offered to meet with her after work so we could catch up over coffee, and she agreed. The day of I messaged her while on the road and she completely forgot, a family event had come up. I offered an alternative, for us to meet a few hours later at a Turkish place we used to frequent in college. The catch being that a handful of my family would be eating separately (it just made more logistical sense after driving 8 hours on our end). She politely declined and told me she was shy, which again I get. I just wonder was that alternative option a major mistake? 

While I can't say I'd marry her at this time, I do care for her and wish her success in life. Compared to past relationships I've had with a Lebanese and Turkish woman, we seem to get along better. I'm in my 20s, I know there's a lot of life left but man does it hurt not knowing how to navigate these things. Sorry if this post was a little ramble-y.. it's 2am.",5,1731476357.0,arabs,0,1.0,False

Then we talk, it's nice and honestly just platonic and then after a day she says I seem very mature and asks if she can talk to me about something and ask for advice, and it's about her situationship💀.

**Product Photography: Creating the Perfect Setup (2024)**

When selling products online, presentation is crucial. One effective way to enhance your store's appeal is through high-quality product photography. Attractive and professional images can significantly boost the visual appeal of your online store, helping you stand out in a competitive market.

While investing in a professional photography studio is ideal, it’s not always feasible for emerging or small businesses. Fortunately, DIY product photography is an excellent alternative. With the right tools and techniques, you can capture eye-catching product photos that rival professional shots without breaking the bank.

# Essential Equipment for Product Photography

High-quality e-commerce photography can be the difference between closing a sale and losing a customer in your online store. This guide is designed for budget-conscious business owners, offering simple yet effective tips to create professional-grade product photos that drive sales.

# Camera

https://preview.redd.it/sxu26hskul0e1.png?width=1500&format=png&auto=webp&s=63861c5572e8ba0fe4f8d8928e87296e8f392efd

The camera you choose plays a vital role in the quality of your product images. While high-end DSLRs like the Nikon D850 (around $1764) with a 105mm f/1.4 lens (about $725) can produce stunning results, they are not necessary for most small businesses. In fact, you can achieve great results using a smartphone—check out our smartphone product photography guide for more tips.

Start with the camera you have and assess the results. Remember, the camera is just one part of the equation. Excellent product photography results from thoughtful decisions about lighting, exposure, styling, and post-processing.

# Tripod

https://preview.redd.it/57erxxupul0e1.png?width=1500&format=png&auto=webp&s=bb464e0dacaf9ce35c23df4b8fa8e85b5a385e7f

A tripod is a three-legged stand used to support and stabilize your camera. It is essential for product photography, ensuring consistent composition and framing across multiple shots.

A tripod is especially useful when shooting with slow shutter speeds and is necessary when using a small aperture for greater depth of field. It’s easy to use: set it up on a stable surface, secure your camera, and adjust the legs and head to try different heights and angles.

For beginners, an affordable tripod will suffice. Many quality options are available for under $30.

# White Background

https://preview.redd.it/wxlzf1dqul0e1.png?width=1500&format=png&auto=webp&s=236b959159b7bc801a6ee22399e9d7ed18b66a52

A clean white background and proper light control are the foundation of professional product photos.

There are various options for white backgrounds. If you shoot frequently, consider investing in white backdrop paper. Paper backgrounds are particularly useful because you can easily cut off dirty sections and roll down new material.

If you're on a budget, you can purchase poster paper from a local art or drug store—typically, 10 sheets cost around $7. Choose pure white, as off-white or cream backgrounds are harder to edit to pure white in post-processing.

# Table

A good table allows you to easily adjust the background, lighting, and products to accommodate various setups.

A standard folding table is ideal for product photography. The width should be between 24 to 27 inches, providing ample space for most product setups without being too bulky.

Cover the table with your chosen background material, allowing it to curve up to the wall or backdrop stand for a seamless look. Ensure you can work comfortably whether standing or sitting. The table doesn’t need to be aesthetically pleasing since it will be covered; just focus on stability and size.

# Tape

Securing your setup is crucial for consistent shooting. Tape is an excellent tool for securing backgrounds.

To avoid damaging the table, use strong removable tape, such as painter's tape or fabric tape. Secure the edges of your background material (like poster paper or seamless paper) to the table, ensuring it is taut and wrinkle-free, curving up to the wall or backdrop stand.

# Lens

The lens you choose significantly impacts the overall quality of your product photos. Consider the size of your products and the shooting environment when selecting a lens.

While lenses can be a significant investment, aim for versatility. A standard zoom lens allows you to shoot larger products and capture smaller details. Two popular options are:

* **24–70 mm f/2.8**: Great for both close-ups and wide-angle shots, with an f/2.8 aperture suitable for low-light conditions.
* **50 mm f/1.8**: This prime lens matches the human eye's focal length, with a wide aperture suitable for various environments.

Experiment with different focal lengths to find the lens that best showcases your product's key features.

# Lightbox

Lightboxes are excellent for product photography, creating even lighting and reducing shadows, making your photos look more professional. They are particularly useful for small to medium-sized products. Using a lightbox is straightforward: place your product on a white background. If your lightbox has built-in lights, turn them on and adjust for even illumination. For more control, consider using external light sources.

# Props

Props can help tell the story of your product by creating ambiance, showcasing scale, or demonstrating usage. However, balance is key—props should enhance, not overshadow, your product.

For example, when photographing a coffee mug, you might include coffee beans, a book, or a pastry to create a cozy scene. Arrange props naturally around the product, ensuring they don’t obscure key features.

When choosing props, consider their colors and avoid anything that clashes with your product. Take test shots and adjust your arrangement as needed to create a balanced and appealing image.

# Optimal Lighting Conditions

Whether indoors or outdoors, natural light is the ideal choice for photography. When shooting indoors, a room with large windows near a wall provides excellent lighting.

Outdoors, open areas or shaded spots can offer good light. However, controlling outdoor light can be challenging and may require additional tools like diffusers or reflectors.

Remember, the distance from the light source affects your shots: being close to the light source creates soft light with darker, softer shadows, while being farther away results in brighter, sharper light. Try to find a space where you can manipulate the light to achieve your desired effect.

# 1. Set Up Your Table

https://preview.redd.it/smf6pwquul0e1.png?width=1500&format=png&auto=webp&s=6e7da78f11a5befbab0084cab6e96adce9d72fea

Once your equipment is ready, it’s time to create your shooting area:

* Position the table near a window, avoiding shadows from the windowsill.
* Keep the window at a 90-degree angle to your setup.
* The closer you are to the window, the larger it is, the softer the light will be.

**Key Tip:** Turn off all other lights in the room to avoid contaminating your setup—this is a common mistake made by many beginners.

Experiment with different setups:

* Try rotating the setup so the window is at a 45-degree angle.
* Face the window directly to your setup for different natural light effects.
* For food photography, consider placing the window behind the setup for a dramatic effect.
* An open garage door can simulate window light without the interference of glass.

Avoid direct sunlight hitting your setup, as it can create harsh shadows that are unflattering for most products.

https://preview.redd.it/jmdh5iewul0e1.png?width=1500&format=png&auto=webp&s=a79c9ecf435c51d5d26a021810713e98d30c299b

# 2. Set Up Your Background

The background is a key element in product photography. It is typically a solid piece of material, often white paper or fabric, that smoothly curves from a vertical position to a horizontal one. This seamless transition eliminates sharp corners or blemishes in the background, creating a clean, professional look for your product photos.

**How to Set Up the Background:**

* Position the top of the background material vertically, allowing it to smoothly curve onto the horizontal surface of the table.
* You may need to gently roll the board to achieve the correct curvature.
* Create a smooth, uninterrupted background that extends from behind the product down to the surface.

**Setup Options:**

* If possible, place the table against a wall and secure the background to both the wall and the table.
* If there’s no wall, use bricks or wooden blocks to create support for the back of the background.
* Center your product on the flat part of the background, leaving space to add a white reflector card later. This setup will ensure your product appears to float in a clean, distraction-free environment, drawing all attention to the item being showcased.

# 3. Adjust Your Camera

Every camera is different, but here are some general guidelines to help you get started:

* Set the white balance (WB) to auto.
* Turn off the flash.
* Use the highest available image quality settings. If available, use RAW format for maximum editing flexibility. If RAW is not an option, select the largest JPG setting. Choose a large image size and select super fine quality.
* Set the ISO to 100 to reduce noise.

**Exposure Settings:**

**Option A: Manual Mode (M)**

* Set the aperture value to the highest number for maximum depth of field.
* Adjust the shutter speed until the image is correctly exposed.
* Use the camera’s live view to preview your adjustments.

**Option B: Aperture Priority (Av)**

* Set the aperture value to the highest number.
* The camera will automatically adjust the shutter speed.
* Use exposure compensation if needed.

**Option C: Auto Exposure**

* If limited to automatic settings, try using sunset mode.
* On a smartphone, tap the area you want to expose correctly.
* Use exposure compensation (+1 or +1½) if available.

https://preview.redd.it/hgv26bcyul0e1.png?width=1500&format=png&auto=webp&s=64fa2b530ea72285676b52b6f8d7f1394e1e5d41

**Pro Tip:** Don’t rely solely on the camera’s preview image. Use the histogram to ensure correct exposure. Adjust the exposure until the curve representing the white background touches the right edge but does not exceed it.

# 4. Set Up Your Product

Placing the product may seem simple, but it often requires careful attention to detail. For items like bottles, ensure the label is centered and straight. You may need to make several small adjustments to achieve perfect alignment.

# 5. Set Up Reflector Cards

White reflector cards are your most valuable light modifiers for any setup. They reflect light back into the shadows, creating a more even image. Experiment with different angles of the cards to find the best light for your product.

# 6. Take Photos and Evaluate

After capturing your images, take the time to review what you’ve created. This is where experience and product knowledge come into play:

* What aspects worked well?
* What areas could be improved?
* How can you enhance the overall image quality?

Try different techniques over time to improve your skills. Upload the images to your computer for a more accurate view, as the camera display can be misleading. Consider using software like Lightroom to organize and perform initial edits.

# 7. Edit Your Photos

Even well-shot photos often require some editing. Your initial image should be a correctly exposed product on a light gray background. Editing helps to:

* Clean up the background
* Remove distracting shadows
* Improve overall brightness and contrast

https://preview.redd.it/camfiz20vl0e1.png?width=1500&format=png&auto=webp&s=065fd964e9348bbab8bbff5b49a7fc2a7210c3ea

https://preview.redd.it/99sp8201vl0e1.png?width=1500&format=png&auto=webp&s=4e20e973b6c46589eaa0117cb54a08f70f0717ca

Editing can be challenging for beginners, but tools like Shopify Magic make the process easier. This AI-driven tool allows you to:

* Separate the subject from the background
* Remove or replace up to four AI-generated scenes at once
* Customize aesthetics, styles, and contexts using text prompts

Alternatively, consider outsourcing the work to professional editing services. Companies like Pixelz and Path offer affordable options, typically charging between $3 to $5 per image.

# 8. Optimize Images for Your Website

Image optimization is crucial for search engine optimization (SEO) and website loading speed. Aim to strike a balance between image quality and file size, with a common target of keeping each image under 200 kilobytes.

https://preview.redd.it/68tq6ut2vl0e1.png?width=1500&format=png&auto=webp&s=73d722c256ad3bd8edc018eac30fd63e5a332381

https://preview.redd.it/wz89ni74vl0e1.png?width=1500&format=png&auto=webp&s=cc6c35bde9583a792e4be8283720ecf187141e7f

**To effectively optimize images:**

1. **Resize for Containers** One way to optimize images is to resize them to fit the containers on your website. For example, if your container is 684 pixels square and your image is 1500 pixels square, the larger image will still fully load, slowing down your website.**Pro Tip:** Resize images to 1.5 times the container size to accommodate retina displays. For a 684-pixel container, aim for an image size of 1026 pixels square.
   * **Determine the HTML container size:**
      * Use your browser’s developer tools to inspect the image element.
      * Right-click on the image and select ""Inspect Element.""
      * The sidebar will display the pixel dimensions of the container.
2. **Resize the Image** Use built-in tools like Mac Preview or Microsoft Paint for simple resizing. Open your image in the application, adjust the dimensions to fit your container size, and export at 100% quality, saving it as a JPEG.
3. **Compress the Image** After resizing, you may notice the file is still large. Smart compression can remove unused data without sacrificing quality.**Recommendations:**
   * Use Photoshop’s “Save for Web” feature or dedicated software like JPEGmini.
   * These tools use algorithms to determine the best compression.
   * Avoid over-compression, which can make images appear blurry.
   * Image Size: \~1 to 1.5 times the HTML container size
   * Format: JPEG
   * Color Space: sRGB
   * Compression: Use JPEGmini or similar tools after exporting

# Expert Product Photography Tips

When capturing product photos, consider the following tips:

* **Use Window Light with Lightboxes** Natural light is often ideal as it’s a simple one-light setup that is cost-effective and easy to use. When using a lightbox or softbox, you enter a multi-light setup, which increases complexity and often requires more advanced knowledge. Multi-light setups come with several challenges:Lightboxes typically provide very even and shadow-free lighting. While this may seem ideal, shadows are important for creating product shape and providing a sense of placement. Natural window light often produces more dynamic and interesting images. Like anything, DIY has its limitations. Achieving perfection on clear or highly reflective products often requires a multi-light studio setup and deep technical knowledge.
   * **Cost:** Lightboxes and additional lighting can be expensive, sometimes more than hiring a professional.
   * **Technical Knowledge:** You need to understand how to balance the exposure of different lights and position them correctly. This includes learning about aperture, shutter speed, and their relationship to light.
   * **Color Balance:** Each light source has a different color temperature, which can significantly affect your images.
   * **Flash Complexity:** If using flash instead of continuous light, you’ll face additional challenges with exposure, sync speed, and professional triggering devices.

https://preview.redd.it/gdbic5t7vl0e1.png?width=1500&format=png&auto=webp&s=d3bc870291cb97469d345292db3730f6fbe8296b

* **Use Foam Boards** Foam boards are versatile and essential tools for controlling light in product photography:Foam boards are ideal because they are sturdy and easy to position. You can purchase them on Amazon or at local craft stores. In a pinch, white printer paper or poster board can serve as alternatives.
   * **White Foam Board:** Used to reflect light back into the shadows, illuminating the darker side of the product.
   * **Black Foam Board:** Can deepen shadows, especially useful when photographing white products against a white background.
   * **Combination Boards:** Use a white reflector card in front of the product and a black reflector card behind it for a more complex lighting setup.
* **Learn Basic Photo Editing Skills** Mastering photo editing skills can significantly enhance your product images:
   * **Cost Savings:** Reduces the need for professional editing services.
   * **Control:** Gives you complete control over the final look of your images.
   * **Versatility:** Allows you to repurpose photos for various marketing channels.
* Start with Adobe Photoshop tutorials to get easy-to-understand lessons applicable to various software. After learning the basics, choose a photo editing software that fits your needs and budget.
* **Capture Multiple Angles** Providing different perspectives can help shoppers better understand the product:
   * **Eye Level:** A straightforward view of the product from the front.
   * **High Angle:** Showcasing the product from above.
   * **Low Angle:** Capturing the product from below.
   * **Bird’s Eye View:** Looking down on the product.

https://preview.redd.it/ztxijhc9vl0e1.png?width=1500&format=png&auto=webp&s=7591b198364a51931c4bea27191b2632c77aa78d

Keep the camera and tripod in the same position while rotating the product during the shoot. This ensures consistency and reduces editing work in post-production.

*  **Experiment with Other Types of Product Photography** While shooting against a white background is crucial, consider incorporating other styles to enhance product presentation:
* **Lifestyle Photography** Lifestyle photos help tell the story of the product and showcase its context:Notice how Allbirds uses both white background and lifestyle photos on their product pages. This approach provides shoppers with context for how the product is used in real life. If you sell hiking boots, show them on someone’s feet. When selling clothing, display your apparel being worn in an appropriate setting.
   * Useful for website content, social media, blog posts, and emails.
   * Helps shoppers envision how and where to use your product.

We had met a year prior but never stayed in touch or dated. We reconnected 8 months ago and dated for 6 months. We had kind of a rough start as he was being a bit of an idiot, I was very clear on my standards and he quickly changed after we talked. All has been well up until a month or two ago. We have been fighting every other weekend. Mostly about dumb things (some due to my own mistakes, to which I did my best to hold myself accountable and do better, and some his own), but ended up being pretty emotionally drawn out conversations. We had pretty good conflict resolution and have been able to move on from everything. I know that fighting is a normal part of relationships and more all about how conflict is repaired and it was a good sign to me on how things were always handled in the end.

Around 3 weeks ago we had another fight over a dumb misunderstanding (due to imo his own insecurities from past relationship betrayal trauma). He completely blew up and dumped me over text. He changed his behavior like a light switch. He refused to meet for coffee or even give me a phone call, it was truly a sad excuse of a breakup. This happened on a Friday, the following morning he had a flight planned to go see one of his best friends then visit his grandparents, he didn’t book a return flight so I had no clue when he would get back. He told me he would text me when he came back to pick up his things, we haven’t had any contact since. He was pretty dirty over text and I felt completely disrespected and shocked. I tried to make sense of it, and even excuse his behavior given his past relationship trauma but I cant really excuse or make sense that type of behavior.

Here is where things get messy. After our breakup, I had moved into a new place less than a block away with him (4 min walk) with my roommates; completely coincidental, and a move I actually tried to avoid. At the time we had signed the lease, I was already hesitant moving so close to him, since I really value my space and liked living in a different neighborhood as him. We had talked about it and he seemed excited to have me close, we are both homebodies and love to cook together, he mentioned this a few times. I honestly didn’t have much of an option as we weren’t able to find another place that met my roommates and I’s needs anywhere else. My roommates convinced me it would be fun to live so close to my boyfriend. 

When I moved in, I knew he was out of town. And this whole time I had been crashing out multiple times daily, ive been angry, and very sad. Im still struggling to believe that this was the same man I love and have spent so much time with. Being intimate not only physically but emotionally and spiritually. Some days, I feel like a dodged a bullet because why would I ever want to be with someone who discarded me so fast and so abruptly with absolutely no explanation? Yet, being the woman I am, I still deeply love him and miss him so much. It has been a very painful breakup for me. 

I have to pass by his apartment constantly to get to the gym and to walk my dogs. Its kind of frustrating as he has a direct view of the street and i have a direct view to his apartment. When i first moved in I would walk by to see if he was home, mostly because I wanted to be prepared to have said conversation. The days went by and he was still gone and I gave up on looking and when I walked by I stopped looking up at his window. 

This past Sunday my roommate walked by and said she saw him and his lights were on. So I started to mentally prepare myself to talk to him or even possibly run into him. Today (tuesday) I went on a walk with my roommate and the dogs and he rode his bike past us. Im not sure if he saw me (I hope he did, my outfit was fire and I felt good)

I guess after seeing him in the flesh after all of this, it hit me like a truck. He really is my neighbor and I will most likely run into him many more times. I am now stuck between texting him to give him his things or dropping off his things in a box at his apartment and just moving on with no conversation. Same vibes as sit in the corner and think about what you did. I have been waiting for his message to get his things, and I honestly refuse to text him, as it is not my responsibility and don’t want to be the one to reach out first ( i’m aware thats my ego talking to me)

 I also want overall advice on how to navigate this situation. In an ideal world we would get back together and it will all be flowers and daises and happily ever after, but I know thats now how things works and that I deserve better. He is also too stubborn and avoidant to ever admit any wrongdoing or take any sort of accountability. 

Any advice or insight is deeply appreciated :)",1,1731475451.0,BreakUps,0,1.0,False

1gq5pc1,https://www.reddit.com/r/fantasywriters/comments/1gq5pc1/feedback_on_the_racial_tension_between_human_and/,Feedback on the racial tension between human and fishmen in my story [general fantasy],"

The main villain for the first book, called 'the Scale Reaver' by local, is a behemoth mutant human who went on a killing spree against the fishmen living in Bobar Island. He had consumed a new recreation drug that is actually a slow burn mutagenic substance that morphs living things into monsters, but as an outlier his mutation is relatively controlled. His mental deterioration lead him to seek out bloody vengeance against the fishmen who had tortured and killed his parents

Fishmen and human share the island of Bobar, though each living in separate towns and villages. Fishmen live in the coast with villages/towns with section of the town both in the water and on the shore, while humans live in the inner island and sometimes on the coast.  However, after Admiral Kepler, the one and only fishmen in the navy, rebelled against the newly crowned Emperessed Analise, there was a huge scouring - a witchhunt by the Empire's military for Kepler's allies and associate across all fishmen settlement of the island. Kepler's hometown was razed to the ground as revenge.

This lead to tension between the human minority of the island and the fishmen. Humans work hard to find work, being discriminated by fishmen from even menial labour jobs. Humans brandishing weapons terrorizing fishmen coffee shops. All this go on and on, eventually leading to a full on race riot. Eventually, humans moved to the nothern part of the island, while fishmen stayed in the south east and south west part. 25 years later (the event of the story) the tension seem to cool down but humans and fishmen of the island rarely if ever contact one another

For some reason or the other (which I haven't thought of yet) the scale reaver's parent's were tortured to near death and gibbeted for people to see. Young Scale Reaver remembered singed this into his memory but could not seek revenge as he know realistically there wasn't anything he could do. He became a dockworker at the largest dock in the island and held silently to that resentment for the rest of his life, until the new drug that came to the island deteriorated his brains and reduced him to a animalistic state which compelled him to act out his pent up hatred against the fishmen. So far, he had completed decimated 2 out of 5 fishmen settlements. The settlements had lost contact, which is why they sent someone to investigate.

My questions are:

1. From what's been said here, is the racial tension between human and fishmen done correctly? Is it a little too melodramatic, ignorant, or hamfisted?

2. Is there anything I could do or sensitive matters I should be aware of when making a plot line about racial rension?

Last night I only l slept about 1-2 hours because I had this terrible bloating.  It felt like the gas was pushing against my ribs.  The gas feels non-stop and is very painful.  After sleeping, if I do manage to finally sleep, it does get better.

I had this at about 2021-ish one night.  Then a few weeks later I had a really terrible version of it that didn't go away for days.  It turned out to be a gallbladder infection, and an MRI showed slight swelling in the walls of my gallbladder.  After some antibiotics and a few days I felt much better.

After that, it was really rare to have this bloating, maybe once every few months.

Ever since the beginning of this year it's becoming once every few weeks.  One time it happened in the morning after eating crispbread with cream cheese.  There doesn't seem to be any solid connection between the bloating and food other than that.  I eat the same sort of things, and don't get bloating, then eat it and then get the horrible bloat anyway.

Caregivers are special members of our Ehlers-Danlos syndromes (EDS) and hypermobile spectrum disorders (HSD) families. Being a Caregiver is a demonstration of love and loyalty. You may be a parent, spouse, or child, or have another special relationship with a person who has a type of EDS or HSD who needs your care.

Most of us never got training in being a Caregiver. You may believe a Caregiver needs to be a medical expert who knows all, a superhero who can do all, and a saint who can always be cheerful. However, Caregivers are human with all the skills, emotions, and experiences that entails. You have the ability to be the Caregiver your loved one needs.

But how do you care for someone with EDS or HSD and care for yourself too?

#Tip #1: Learn all you can about EDS and HSD and how it presents in your loved one.
Learning all you can about your loved one’s condition will help you both. It is also important to learn about how their condition affects them. Do they have joint problems? Do they have digestive issues? Your knowledge about their type of EDS or HSD will help if you accompany them to doctor appointments, talk with family or friends, and research symptom treatment or management options. Learning about EDS and HSD will also help you and your loved one talk about what they are experiencing. You can learn about EDS and HSD from The Ehlers-Danlos Society, medical journal articles, from others on message boards like ours on Inspire, and from support groups. We have virtual groups for
parents and partners called Let’s Chat.

#Tip #2: Watch, listen and communicate.
Your loved one with EDS or HSD will likely say or show you what they need. There will be days when what they need most is simply for you to believe that they are in pain, fatigued, or experiencing symptoms making them feel awful. There will be days when your loved one needs you to encourage them to be more independent and to problem-solve ways or tools to help. There will be days when they
need time completely alone, maybe in a dark room curled up in bed. And there will be days when your loved one wants to be seen as “normal” but may need your help with how to pace activities.

Neither you nor your loved one are mind readers so you both need to ask questions and explain answers. If you are uncertain about what your loved one needs — ask. If your EDSer or HSDer does not understand what you are doing, explain in a matter-of-fact manner. Two-way communication is crucial. This requires being honest with and listening carefully to each other. If needed, a professional counselor
can help you both increase your skills to have these important, honest conversations. Remember that your loved one is more than their diagnosis (separate who they are as a person from their condition) and you are more than their Caregiver (separate your role from who you are as a person). While it is necessary to talk clearly about EDS and HSD, it is equally necessary to set times when it is not discussed. Having open, frequent communication between you and your loved one will help you be a better Caregiver and both of you will feel better understood and supported.

#Tip #3: Accept your feelings.
Being a Caregiver can be hard work and it is perfectly normal for you to have feelings like anxiety, anger, grief, or guilt. Understand that your feelings are neither good nor bad; they are your feelings and need to be felt. While it is normal to have a variety of emotions, you and your loved one need to make sure your feelings are not negatively affecting each other. Some find talking with other Caregivers in a support
group helpful while others use journaling to express their feelings or meditation to process their feelings. There are family, friends, community groups, faith-based resources, professional counselors, and online forums you can use for more tips and strategies.

#Tip #4: Take care of yourself.
You cannot be an effective Caregiver for your loved one if you do not take care of yourself every day. This means eating healthfully, getting quality sleep, exercising regularly, and taking care of your own medical needs. But it also means nurturing more than just your body. Take time for yourself each day relaxing, doing something you enjoy, and connecting with what is important to you.

Maybe you have a hobby or are part of a book club. Or perhaps a good nap or meditation restores your balance. Make this time for yourself each day. It is also important to seek social connections for both you and your loved one. These may be with your best friends, a group you belong to, cultural events in your community, the regulars at a neighborhood coffee shop, or wherever you are with others you enjoy.
Being around other people can help you cope better with the responsibilities of being a Caregiver. Use community resources when needed and accept help from others. You cannot be the Caregiver you want to be if you do not take very good care of yourself physically, emotionally, and socially.

#Tip #5: Remember that life is more than EDS and HSD.
You can help create opportunities for humor, adventures, problem-solving, and discussions that have nothing to do with the condition. Have conversations and show what you love about your loved one’s personality, intelligence, outside interests, or passions. Have your loved one help make important decisions. Plan activities that are EDS- and HSD-friendly so you both can have fun but not make anything worse. Allow them to help you when you need help. Celebrate what you both love about life and about each other — knowing that this condition is just one aspect of your lives.

Being a Caregiver may feel overwhelming at times. There will be good days and bad days. But if you follow these tips and work together, you will find that Caregiving can be rewarding for you both.",1,1731474515.0,chronicillnessconn,0,1.0,False

[Original Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/s/lPZBeUBs36): **October 12, 2024**

This may be a little confusing but I will try to make it as clear as possible.

My (27F) fiance's ex is now my older brother's wife, so my SIL. To make it less confusing my fiancee is George, my brother is David and my SIL is Ella. George (38M) briefly dated Ella (34F) 4 years ago. Ella wanted to get married and have kids but George did not want this with her. He was also having a lot of issues back then, partying, doing drugs and not being the most reliable person. They dated for 6 months and everything ended in drama because Ella was not able to make George want to settle with her. 

Soon after their breakup she met my brother and they got married 6-7 months after. So yeah they moved really fast and basically Ella dated her ex, broke up with him, met my brother and got married to him, everything in only 1 year and a couple of months.

I met George 2 years ago and at that time Ella was already married to my bro. Back then I had no idea that George was Ella's ex. When George started to feel attracted to me he changed completely. He quit drinking and doing drugs (he has been sober ever since), started going to therapy and overall became a new person. He did this because he wanted to change and I have been with him during his entire healing journey. I am very proud of him and we have a healthy and amazing relationship.

Even if Ella was already married to my brother, she was furious when she found out I was dating George and that he was serious with me. She was so cruel and said a lot of nasty lies. She used to tell everyone that George was grooming me (I was 25 when we became a thing and he was 36, this is not grooming ffs), she lied that George was abusing me, trying to get me to become an addict like him and many other things. This ruined my relationship with my brother because he never did anything to make her stop.

George and I announced our engagement to my family last week during my dad's birthday. My parents were happy for us but Ella said ""It must be nice to be the one to get the ring after someone else struggled to fix him"". Again no reaction from my brother as usual. My parents told her to stop but I just snapped and told her something along the lines ""He fixed himself you POS, and yes it is nice to know I will be married to the man I love more than anything and who loves me the same. But how is it for you knowing that no one else except my idiot brother ever wanted to marry you? Does it feel nice?"". 

My parents kicked them out after this. They told her that everybody had enough of her BS, she is insane because althoug being married she is still bitter over the fact that her ex did not want her. She is officially banned from every family event and my brother is now blaming me. So AITAH in this situation? I don't think I am honestly but I want to also hear some unbiased perspective.

**AITAH has no consensus bot, OOP was NTA with a few YTAs and others**

**Relevant Comments**

**OOP clarifies the details on why SIL is banned but not her based on multiple comments**

> **OOP:** Why should I be banned from my own family? I am my parent's child and she is an in law. I will soon be an in law to my future husband's family but I would never attack his relatives in their homes. 
> 
> Also, my relationship with George is not doomed. We are happy, we love each other and we really have a healthy relationship. A frustrated woman who cannot get over something that happened 4 years ago will not ruin my relationship. 

**Commenter 1:** Your SIL being banned is essentially banning your brother as well. Would George actually go to family events if you weren’t allowed to go?

> **OOP:** No, he would not go without me. But my brother was asked multiple times to address this and keep his wife in line and he did not, he keeps making excuses for her. Just to be clear, I was able to tolerate this woman for years and I did it only for my brother, but apparently he was not able to ask his wife to stop. 

**Commenter 2:** Yeah, I think we have an unreliable narrator here. George is not sounding like a knight in shining armor, and from Ella’s comments that she’s trying to keep OP from something bad happening, maybe the family should ask her for specifics? Maybe Ella isn’t bitter that her ex didn’t want her. Maybe she knows something OP doesn’t. This is some messy shit, and I definitely think we are missing information.

> **OOP:** I can respect your opinion and thank you for your feedback. Yes, this is how she made it seem, that she knows things that I am too young and in love to see, that she is looking out for me. Some lies that she said are: that George is grooming me - false, I am a consenting adult. Yes, we have an age gap but it's not like I am 15 and he is 11 years older. 
> 
> She said George will influence me to drink and do drugs to become like him - false, he never did anything like this. He never ever did that with her either. 
> 
> Although in her narrative she is trying to make people see George as a dangerous man who is running down the street with a needle to corrupt people to do drugs with him, this is not the case at all. Even when he used, he was not like that. 
> 
> He has always been a functional adult, he has a good paying job but in the past he was spending his free time at parties, getting drunk or high to numb out some of his feelings and he was clearly not relationship material. She said his change is not real, that he is just a predator, faking to be a good guy now just to get me. This is false also, I am the one living with him for 2 years and I think I know better what's happening in my house. So no, even if she deludes herself Ella does not know George better than I do 

**Did OOP have a great relationship with her brother before his marriage to Ella?**

> **OOP:** I love my brother and we used to have a great relationship before. Since he is older, he was always my protector but I am deeply hurt and disapointed in how he acted during the last years. Ella and I never bonded or had a close relationship. How did I respond to the snide comments. At first I tried to be polite and chill but when her comments did not stop I also became unkind to her.

[Update #1](https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/s/QjuhYhTBwE): **October 14, 2024 (two days later)**

This update will be very long so if you don't want to waste time reading the first part, you can skip directly to the actual update.

Thank you so much for all you comments and reaching out to me! I don't know what I excepted when I posted, I guess I wanted to receive some unbiased feedback from an outside perspective, but I never expected this. I was really overwhelmed with how kind and nice most of you were so once again thank you and sorry for not being able to reply to all the comments! 

For those who were not on the same page, I understand and respect that you have a different opinion. From my initial post I have left out a lot of details because it's a long story but some of you were curious about what actually happened and asked me to provide more details so buckle up, I will do just that.

*How I met my future husband* - I got asked a lot if I live in a trailer park or small town with only a bar available 😅. The answer is no, we actually live in a big city with a population of a couple millions of people. I met my fiancé through a mutual friend. My girlfriend was dating one of George's colleagues and they all began to hang out for drinks after work since they were all in the same building. At some point I had no plans for that day and my girlfriend invited me to go with them to a bar and this is how we were introduced. After this we started having different group activities together and things slowly progressed.

*George targeted his ex's younger SIL to spite her/there was no coincidence that we started dating* - as absurd as it may sound it was indeed an ironic coincidence. You may think out of the millions of people there are in a city, what are the chances for you to start dating your SIL's ex. Well it happened to me and we did not know about it in the beginning. The girlfriend that asked me to go with them to a bar did not know Ella, never saw her IRL and she never saw her with George. When George met me he had no idea that I had any connection to Ella, so there was no chance for him to be an evil mastermind and intentionally date me just to spite her. I did not take George home to meet my family immediately either. Maybe I am the weird one but I was never the type to parade my boyfriends in front of my parents if I was not sure the relationship was going to last.

*I broke the girls code* - I do not consider that I did. Let's be clear, I have a couple of true friends, they have been my friends for many years and I would do anything for them. I am a very loyal person and I know the girls code very well. When we eventually found out the connection Ella had with both of us, I was shocked and I asked the same question that many of you did - what were the chances? It was a very uncomfortable position to be in. Even though I had no relationship with Ella except the obvious one of her being my SIL, it was strange to know that they dated. I wanted to find out what happened before taking any decision and I did. The way I saw things - there was no reason for me to ""punish"" George for having a past. We were in love, we were happy and Ella was already married to my brother. I may have been selfish but I thought is this man and our relationship worth it? And the answer was yes, to me he was, is and will always be worth it. Also, we see my brother and Ella only a couple of times/year. Most of the times (for obvious reasons) we prefer to visit my parents separately.

*George's addictions* - so many of you reached out to me being concerned about this and I wanted to thank you for caring and say I am sorry you had to go through traumatic experiences with addicts. Some of your stories were hard to read and I appreciate immensely that you were open to share your experiences with a stranger. I understand why most of you were triggered by my story but George was not that type of addict. He had a lot of unresolved trauma, he was lonely, unloved and ashamed so his coping mechanism were parties, alcohol and drugs. His entourage was also not the best...you can imagine that a bunch of 36 years old party-boys/girls are no good but at the end of the day when everyone else went home to their families, wives and kids, these were the people who could provide company to George. I think it was more like all of them providing company to each other so they could feel less lonely. But other than this, George was a functional adult, he had a stable well paying job (he was and is still working as a software engineer), he was never violent etc.

*George changed for me* - no, George changed for himself and because he wanted to. He told me that I was the trigger that made him want to get his life in order but in a more meaningful way than just wanting to get into my pants. When we started hanging out as a group with my friend and his colleague, he learned how easy it was to interact and have fun without drugs or alcohol. He also saw that I enjoyed spending time with him, I looked forward to seeing him every time and he understood that his sober self is not unlovable. He was longing for healthy relationships and normality but until that moment he felt like he was not deserving to have them. I think the way I helped him was solely because I saw and fell in love with his true self and that gave him confidence and purpose.

*I am the golden child* - there is no such thing in our family, my parents love my brother and I the same. Of course when they heard Ella's BS the first time they were worried for me but I was open with them. I told them how things happened, George was honest and never hid his troubled past from them and in the end they were ok with our relationship. My parents trust me, trust my judgment and they only want to see me happy. And in regards to Ella, my parents are just doing what every parent should: defend their child. She was warned before. My parents talked to her, asked her to stop acting like this and told her she is out of line so it's not like they kicked her out the first time it happened.

**Now into the UPDATE:**

Yesterday I contacted my brother and asked him to meet me for coffee. It was only the two of us and I think it was the first time I have opened my heart like this in front of him. I started off by apologizing for him being caught in the middle but I told him I will never apologize or be sorry for loving George. I was honest and told him how much this situation has been affecting me. My brother is the same age as my fiancé so he is 11 years older than me. 

During our childhood he was my protector, the person I looked up to. Due to our age difference we never really had many activities in common and I could not wait for the moment I grow up so I can get to share more with my brother as adults. But I did not get the chance to do this because of Ella. David would always teach me to value myself, to choose people who treat me right and make me happy, however I am not able to share my happiness with him anymore. I understand why he would wish I never met George, but it still hurts knowing that your brother somehow resents the source of your happiness.

David would always defend me when I was younger even in front of our parents. When I was 15 I was experimenting with makeup and it looked bad, really bad. During a family function one of our uncles got drunk and told me to stop using makeup because I was too young to look like a hooker. David got mad and kicked him out for offending his sister. This is the kind of brother he used to be and to now see how he stays aside and allows his wife to be offensive and cruel it's really hurtful. I do not care that she is like that towards me, I don't like Ella at all and I could easily ignore her. 

But what gets to me the most is she constantly trying to belittle and humiliate my future husband. I have lived with this man for 2 years, I have shared so many things with him during this time and I am certain I know better what kind of man he is. I know how hard it was for him to heal all his trauma, I know how hard he worked day by day to become the best version of himself, I know how much he loves me, protects me, supports me and I simply loose it when I hear her crap and how she is constantly trying to bring him down. 

Yes, I go bear mode when he is involved as someone told me in the comments but I don't care. I will not allow any of my family members to abuse the person I love. I may have tolerated things for my brother's sake but I will never be quiet in front of his b\*\*\*h of a wife.

I told my brother that I love him and I will always cherish the memories I have with him but we cannot go on like this. I understand he is a victim and I am ready to do anything for him if he is willing to accept that his marriage is not good, that Ella is not a good woman and is abusing him. I cannot force him to divorce her because this has to be his choice but I told him I will accept his decision no matter what that is. He will always be my brother but George is my family now. We plan on having kids in the near future and there is no way in hell I will ever allow his lunatic of a wife to be near my kids. I also refuse to subject George to the abuse. We tried...we thought that this rough period will eventually pass and that everything will be ok but unfortunately Ella became more and more bitter and disgusting. We will still see my parents but I am standing my ground and will not go to their house if she is present.

David and I cried a lot and for the first time in many years I felt like I had my brother back. He apologized over and over again and explained a lot of things to me which gave me the chance to understand him better. But at the same time I am so angry that I had no idea what was happening to my brother. Some people said that David was a rebound for Ella but it seems they were both a rebound for the other. What made them marry so fast was the age pressure. 

My brother was feeling like it was very hard to connect with someone and the prospect of being able to have a family of his own seemed very far away until Ella came and offered him the possibility to have exactly what he wanted without too much struggle. So yeah...in the end I guess we are all some messed up people in a way or another.

I don't know what's going to happen, David said he plans to take some time, go away alone for a couple of days and think what he wants to do. But he said that when he'll be back he wants to have a chat with George to apologize to him as well for everything that has happened. My brother knows that everything Ella says is false, he said everyone is able to see how much George loves me and that we make a great couple and there are times when he wished to also have something like this in his life. He told me he is proud of the woman I have become and that no matter what happens, I will always be his little sister. After this I went home and cried some more with George besides me. I have tried to play strong and denied myself to feel hurt for so long that yesterday I have finally exploded. But it was good because now I feel better.

**Additional Information from OOP, responding to multiple comments regarding on trying to be civil to Ella and covering George’s past up**

> **OOP:** Hi! I respect your point of view and thank you for your feedback. However, it seems too much to me saying ""I brought him back into her life"". No one expects them to suddenly be BFFs or spend a lot of time together, we do not have the same group of friends, we do not have vacations/trips together so how is my future husband forced into her life? We only ever meet up for family related ocasions which are not that many to be honest. In a year we have Easter, Christmas and my parents' birthdays (so 4 events) and maybe sometimes some weddings of extended family members but that's it. 
> 
> Also, no one asked her to do anything or be nice to us. I only ever asked her to ignore us like I do to her so basically she was asked to behave like an adult. As an adult sometimes you will have to share the same space with people you are not really fond of, however you should be able to be civil and do not make stupid comments. I never liked her, not even before George. So I can also she is forced into my life? I guess so, but I understood sometimes I have to see her because she is my brother's wife and that was it.
> 
> I can understand her experience with my future husband was very different than what I have with him and I can respect her not liking him. However, I will never accept her idiot comments, her nasty remarks, her lies and overall her being a shitty person towards us. She should fix her issues with a therapist not act like we are her punching bag. 

**Relevant Comments**

**Has OOP’s brother shared on if there was some type of abuse going on between him and Ella?**

> **OOP:** He did not share much about what is happening to him but from what I have seen and what he had told me, I don't expect her to be the perfect angel with him. Also abuse has many forms and at least she is abusing his kindness and his easygoing nature. She had the guts (multiple times I should say) to come to my parents' house and offend me (their daughter) in their presence even after they were polite enough and asked her to stop so again I don't think that she is being too nice to my brother behind closed doors. 

**OOP should share that her brother didn’t need to have a miserable future with Ella if she continues to manipulate him**

> **OOP:** Yes, I did and I talked to my parents and we will target the topic full force when he comes back. I fear she is manipulating him with this in order to make him accept more than he should. Maybe convincing him that at their age it is too late to find someone to start a family with. But hell even my fiance is willing to talk to him and use himself as an example that it is never too late and you should not settle for toxic people

[Update #2](https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/s/huNu1U5HTT): **November 6, 2024 (one month later)**

Hey! It's been some time since my last update and I kept receiving questions about what's new with my family drama so I decided to update once again.

TL;DR: my brother David is divorcing his wife and we found out a lot of details about her. As expected she is not taking the divorce lightly.

As planned, David did take some time for himself and went to a retreat cabin for a week. He went there alone because he wanted to have the space and time to rethink his life choices. This was exactly what he told Ella but left out the location because he did not want to risk her showing up there. 

The first day he was away, Ella contacted my parents and me to ask us about my brother's location. We did not disclose anything. On Wednesday that week I was contacted by some of my brother's friends. They wanted to know if my brother was ok and if it was true that David was cheating on Ella. Initially I was very confused on why would they think that but they told me that Ella has been going around complaining to people that my brother was cheating on her and that we, his family were on board with it and covering up his affair. 

I told my bro's friends that this was not true but I decided to be petty so I went on social media, uploaded a photo of me with my brother and wrote how proud I am of him that he is taking this time to focus on mental health and his wellbeing. Some hour later Ella called me and demanded I take down my post because I was embarrassing her. I played dumb and asked her why would a post dedicated to my brother would ever embarrass her. She never answered, never admitted to lying and I never took down my post, it will stay where it is for posterity 😂.

After my brother returned from the retreat he asked me, George and my parents to meet up at our parents' place and talk. He apologized for everything that happened with his wife and told us a lot of things about Ella. Apparently she is a very jealous person and she has a constant need to put others down so she can look better or feel superior. Bro gave us a lot of examples of shitty things she did including to some of her relatives and supposed friends. 

One of her female cousins works for a transport company so most of her colleagues at work are men. Ella told this cousin's husband that there are high chances of her cousin cheating since she spends every day surrounded by men. Her cousin was pregnant at that time and I don't know if she was trying to imply the baby may not be her husband's but still...needless to say they don't speak to Ella anymore. 

She had a girlfriend who got into a relationship with a guy. Ella kept telling this girl bad things about her partner that she supposedly heard from other people. She was never able to tell who she heard it from, most likely she invented everything. That's why her family members avoid her and never invite her to functions and she does not have any friends. People from their circle were friends with my bro before he married her so they are just tolerating her for his sake.

I mentioned that Ella must be abusing my brother and a lot of people took it the wrong way. When I mentioned abuse, I did not mean it as physical abuse, but more like emotional abuse. I guess everyone has their own way of seeing things, but for me being married and still being pissed about things that happened with your ex years ago is clearly a sign of disrespect towards your spouse. And if someone is able to openly disrespect their spouse over and over again in front of their family, it's a high chance for that person to do more than disrespect behind closed doors. My bro clearly struggles to see his self-worth at the moment and this is also the reason why he accepted too many things from his wife. But we will be with him, always support him and remind him what an awesome guy he is.

Also, many people were outraged and called me an AH for calling my brother an idiot. I don't know if all of your families and relationships are like those you see in commercials, but in real life siblings fight and sometimes when they fight, they may call each others names. This doesn't mean I don't love my brother or that I don't respect him. But if I see him acting like an idiot, I will always say it to his face and explain why I think he is an idiot. I apologized for calling him an idiot and he said there is no need to apologize because he expects me to always be honest with him even if sometimes the truth may hurt. And I understand because I expect the same from him.

Anyways, David confronted Ella with everything that she has been doing and told her she needs to get help. She refuses to accept she has any problem, she states that *""everything that she has ever done came from a place of love and care for that person""* (riiight, because when you care for your cousin you lie to her husband that she may be cheating on him or when you care for your SIL you lie to everyone that she is forced to do drugs by her partner). She did not take the divorce well but not because she was losing my brother, but because she saw this as a failure that shattered her perfect image she had of herself. 

Maybe after some time passes I will actually be able to feel sorry for her because she is a sad person with so many issues that refuses to get help. Of course Ella blamed the divorce on me and our family, claiming that David is choosing us over her, so clearly she does not take any kind of responsibility for her actions. David however warned her that if she continues spreading lies about our family, we will hire a lawyer and take legal actions against her. 

At the end of the day if she still insists with her crap, she will have to prove everything in court. Of course we don't want to get to this, but she needs to understand that we cannot say whatever we want about other people and not face the consequences.

In the meantime, George and I are planning our wedding and my bro will be George's groomsman. They really had the chance to bond and even discovered they actually have a lot in common. I don't want to be mean but ever since Ella is out of the picture, our family gatherings happen more often than before and the atmosphere is so light. 

My brother is slowly going back to his old self, he is having a good time with us, no stress, no dissociating, he is just present and enjoying. So that's it for now. I don't know if this was the update you were expecting but I can say I am happy. We are slowly healing from everything that had happened this past years and I am positive that in the end we will be closer and stronger than before.

**Relevant Comments**

**OOP on Ella needing to get help with resolving her own issues, affecting David’s self esteem**

> **OOP:** Wow...I never thought about this but you may be right. I have been thinking about your comment and it makes a lot of sense. My brother who has self esteem issues, her cousin and cousin's husband that were expecting a child so obviously were in a vulnerable and emmotional moment of their lives. Her friend that started dating someone and was going through that initial phase of getting to know the partner and building trust. My brother again when she knew their relationship was on rocks and he may decide to walk away from her so why not trash his image and conveniently plant affair rummors before a divorce. My parents... 
> 
> Jeesus, she may be actually really evil! 

**Commenter 1:** Ella sounds like a real piece of work. It's a shame that she couldn't just be happy for you and your brother. Good on you for standing up for him and exposing her lies. Hopefully she gets the help she needs, but it's understandable if people want to distance themselves from her toxic behavior. Keep supporting your brother and reminding him that he deserves better!

**Commenter 2:** Ella sounds like the textbook definition of toxic. Good riddance to her, honestly. Glad your brother's getting his life back together.

Since I went full carnivore, I’ve had the liquid #2 the entire time. That’s 8 months of not trusting a fart. I have tried almost every variation to see if it changes and it hasn’t. I have tried high fat-moderate protein, low fat-high protein, some dairy/no dairy, butter/no butter, high salt/low salt, high electrolytes/low electrolytes, not drinking 30 minute prior/post eating…. Nothing seems to work. 

I eat the same exact meal 95% of the time, and just swap the above ingredients every couple weeks to try to stop it. My current meal is 12oz of 80/15 ground beef in smash burger patty form (no seasoning), 3 eggs, 1 slice of cheese, salt to taste. I eat that twice a day. I will also occasionally munch on some pork rinds fried in pork fat and nothing else. I drink coffee and also take pre-workout, but even on days that I don’t do that, I still shit my brains out. I’ve tried a multitude of electrolyte brands. All of them use stevia extract as the sweetener.
 
I’ve also gotten fluffier than when I started. I’ve tried eating until satiety, caloric deficit, caloric surplus and so on. I can’t seem to lean out. Right now I’m doing a surplus to see if I can bulk, then try a cut and see what that does. The problem with eating to satiety is my hunger cues are messed up and always tell me to eat. I’m not overweight by any means. I’m 5’11” and currently 163lbs. I’m scrawny though, and carry all my weight in my stomach and face. If I gain weight, I get a pot belly and a fluffy face. 

The main reason I’m doing carnivore is for autoimmune. When I’m on the SAD, I’m so stiff in the mornings I can barely move. I’m almost pain free with this diet. When I have a cheat day with a moderate amount of sugar, my body aches the next day. Example, I had a Cinnabon with the wife on Friday and Saturday morning I was pretty stiff and in pain.

“Prajakta,” she replied, smiling back.

I work at a coffee shop, and we have a plastic self inking stamp that I can just press down on to stamp coffee bags with a basic label of the business name. The stamps keep breaking because we have to apply some force for a clear print, so I’m hoping to find a heavy duty way to stamp labels on our bags. They’re craft paper brown bags, and we stamp about 200 of them a week. We used a regular wood stamp with a handle and an ink pad, but the strain on our wrists led us to the self inking stamp which is better but not perfect.

Do you think lino printing would work for production printing or would the strain on our wrists be worse than with a stamp and an ink pad? The ergonomics seem better than the ink pad and stamp method.

I found out my husband was cheating on me, kept it to myself, and the day I had him served with divorce papers, I posted this on Facebook, where all our friends and family are…

AITAH for publicly humiliating him for cheating on me? 



This is what I wrote: 


Oh, honey, you thought I wouldn’t find out?

That’s adorable. Really. But here’s the thing – your sneaky little side hobby, thinking you’re some undercover James Bond type, has finally been exposed. And unlike you, I have no intention of hiding in the shadows. So grab your popcorn, because this is going public.

Do you know how long I’ve been ignoring the late nights, the “work trips,” the secretive texting? YEARS. That’s right. But oh, how sweet it was to discover that you, my dear husband, are about as subtle as a neon sign saying “SNEAKY CHEATER HERE!”

Let me take a moment to thank your “soulmate” (and I use that term generously) for leaving a trail of evidence that even a blind mole rat could follow. Between her very generous perfume on your shirt, the “misplaced” lipstick-stained coffee cup in your car, and the hotel receipts you oh-so-cleverly stuffed into MY glovebox? Sweetheart, you left enough clues to rival an Agatha Christie novel. And boy, I played detective.

So now, my darling husband, consider this my own little “public service announcement.” I’m done with your ridiculous lies. I’m done waiting up and playing the supportive wife while you’re out here romancing someone who doesn’t even know how to button her blouse correctly.

And yes, I know you’ll try to gaslight your way out of this. Maybe say I’m “overreacting” or “paranoid” or ""taking things out of context."" Well, let me tell you, context went out the window along with my trust and patience.

So enjoy this, sweetheart, because it’s the last time I’ll be giving you ANY of my time, attention, or dignity. I'll be just fine – but you, on the other hand? Good luck convincing anyone else that you're even half the man you pretend to be.

Consider this Exhibit A in the glorious show of your own unraveling. And you know what? I might just bring popcorn for the whole town to watch.

Cheers, darling! 🍾

So, they work at this local convenience store in my area and we've seen each other almost everyday for about 6 months. We don't and have never ever interacted beyond the usual customer-employee relationship EXCEPT NOW. 

I've been attracted to them the first time I saw them and it's the main reason why go to that convenience store specifically when there are cheaper alternatives. I'm not particularly hiding my crush but I'm not doing anything in showing it too except eye contact.

So context, they changed their rotation and now they work late at nights to early mornings.  I've been having breakfast stupidly early there for 2 weeks or so until I stopped for about a week because of something. So we haven't seen each other around that period but I still go to that store because funnily enough I've become an overly loyal customer (I go there about twice or thrice a day). 

Once I got back on my morning runs to the store, they talked to me for the first time EVER. Not the ""here's your change"" or ""Careful, it's hot"" kinda thing. I was just paying for my coffee and they said ""Oh, you aren't getting your sandwhich? I ordered a lot of them for you.""

(And mind you, I might have pined for them for 6 months but NEVER EVER did I expect that they would actually talk to me. I was genuinely happy with our one second eye to eye contact.) 

They smiled at me like that lazy kind of smile and jesus christ the eye contact we had was the best since they actually talked to me. I was too shocked to reply BUT I SMILED out of surprise (i just hope i didnt look to manic). My reply was kinda lame because I simply said I'll order tomorrow. 

After that, I went everyday but my timing on the first few days were off because they weren't on the counter. Even when they were at the counter, we haven't talked again. I felt like I need to be the one to start the conversation but I DONT WANT TO EMBARASS MYSELF. My friends have been telling to ""flirt back"" because it kinda seems like it was. But God, I've been agonizing over the thought that they were just teasing me or something and it wasn't flirty. 

Please tell me if this was flirting or not, and even if it wasn't, any advices on what to do (if I should do something about it) 

P.S. I seriously can't get any sleep because I'm overthinking things.

### Training
I (30M) had a really solid 12 week build (52, 70, 65, 75, 81, 71, 78, 80, 83, 81, 58, 54) leading into my first marathon. I come from more of a mid-distance background so I am still trying to get a good grasp on marathon training. Some key workouts along the way were fatigue 1600 (6 miles at 6:00 short jog to the track and then 3x1600), 22 mile long run with 8x1km working from MP down to HM at the end, 22 mile long run with 5 miles, 1 float, 4 miles, 1 float, 4 miles at MP, 20 mile run with 11x 1k MP, 1k float, and 18 mile progression run avg. 5:59. There were many other sessions, but these were the significant ones in my eyes. I tried a double threshold day; however, between work and being a dad/husband continuing these wasn’t feasible. I am self coached so there are many things I am still trying to figure out with marathon training. I’ve thought about giving Pfitz a go for the next cycle, but also enjoy experimenting with training too.

### Pre-race
I live in Indianapolis so no travel to throw off the routine. I started to carb load Wednesday evening. I wasn’t very scientific about this. I just tried to focus on getting a good mixture of simple and complex carbs in. The main objective was to never feel hungry at all through the day. 

Race morning I woke up at 4:45 to give myself plenty of time to eat as I tend to get fairly nervous. This was no exception. I managed to get down half a bagel, 2 nutrigrain bars, and my iced coffee. After doing some mobility I helped get my daughter ready and out the door we went. 

After we got downtown I said goodbye to my wife and daughter and found my club’s tent (S/O Monon Track Club). I hung out there for a while before getting my race gear all on and heading to find a few friends that also had elite entry. We did about a half mile warm up and a few strides in the warm up area. Before I knew it we were getting called to the start line for the national anthem. After the national anthem Gold Medalist Cole Hocker (an Indy native) spoke for a couple of minutes. The whole time I kept telling myself not to get sucked out too quick. The half and full both start together.

### Race
The mad dash was off and I tried to find pace quickly. I wanted to be conservative for the first 3 miles and feel things out. Once I hit the 3 mile mark I allowed myself to pick it up a little bit. Around mile 5-6 I found a pack of guys that were shooting for 2:30 and settled in with them. I tried to turn my mind off and just run. This lead to a fairly boring (perfect) next 10 miles or so. 

We came through the half in 1:14:56 and our pack was 7 deep. Around the 16 mile mark we had dwindled to a pack of 4. The two guys in the front said they were going to start to push. I was a little nervous about starting to go this soon, but it was either make the move or run alone. So the group of 4 continued! We started to push the pace. Around miles 20-22, the two the led the charge started to really push the pace down. This section of the course is fairly isolated and there is not much fan support. I kept telling myself hold on to them. This is the part of the race that I’ve trained for. All the 4:30-5am alarms, the hard workouts, the nighttime doubles after putting my daughter to bed. All of it was for this moment. I know that’s extremely cheesy, but that’s what I needed. 

I was able to hold with them for a little bit longer, but they had dropped down to 5:20s and there was no holding on. I was still managing to hold 5:30-5:40 and then was telling myself just get back to Meridian St., which is about a 2 mile straight shot back to downtown.

I made it to Meridian and met back with the half marathon route. The amount of support from both the half marathoners and spectators was amazing. By the point I am doing everything I can to stay on 5:40 pace. I kept focusing on good form and trying to catch any fading marathoners that I could. In the moment, I thought I was doing a good job of hold good for… photographic evidence says otherwise. 

With about 400 meters to go I pass the club tent and really start to pour everything I have out. This was by far the longest 400 meters of my life. With about 100 meters to go I could finally make out the clock above the finish line. 2:28:xx. I couldn’t believe it. I knew we had picked it up, but I didn’t realize by how much. I pushed through the line and got a nice shiny PR of 2:28:17. I couldn’t stop smiling.

### Post-race
It didn’t take long for the adrenaline to wear off and my quads to start screaming. I made my way through the finishing shoot to find my wife and daughter. It didn’t take too long to find them. My wife was super excited and just kept saying “You did it!” It was definitely a great moment and one I will cherish long after my running days are over. 

We finally started making our way to the club tent. I very graciously offered to push the stroller. I obviously am just super Dad… definitely wasn’t using it as a walker. I had fun catching up with others that had ran that day and had a cold snack or two to celebrate.

Now being a couple of days removed I’ve started having the what ifs creep in. I guess there is only one way to find out if any of them are true. Ladies and gentlemen, I think I’ve caught the marathon bug.

This isn’t necessarily *my* view, but it is how I think the general public will go (the ones who aren’t constantly online and don’t faint if they hear a sex joke from a man).

He has been a genuine and nice guy. He isn’t afraid to challenge gender stereotypes, like his love of cooking and cleaning. He is sex-positive. Quite open-minded. He doesn’t lie about things, and he’s generally positive (unlike that negative lying redhead). He has been the “big brother” to all of the other housemates and has shown a fun playful sarcastic side as well as his level-headed mature side. He is noble enough to baby the baby of the house, the 38-year-old infant redhead woman, proven by his sincerity in giving her a cup of coffee when she was sad and also the nice letter he wrote for her (a lot of you assumed he was going to write something shitty about redhead, but he didn’t because he is nice). If he wins, it’s because he played a great character on the tv show we watch. That’s all it is people. If Ali loses it doesn’t mean homophobia and sexism. Get real.

1gq4r01,https://www.reddit.com/r/FriendshipAdvice/comments/1gq4r01/navigating_2_different_friendships_and_dont_want/,Navigating 2 different friendships and don't want to leave anyone out.,"**BACKGROUND:** I am a college junior who lives with a nice roommate I'll call Peggy. We don't have everything in common (e.g. Peggy is more introverted than me; whereas I like to go out and chat at a coffee shop, Peggy prefers watching shows on her phone). Ultimately, I do enjoy talking to Peggy and feel close around her. However, it's taken me a while to really find ""my people"" and right now, I think I've finally found them. Here's why:

**SITUATION:** I recently got involved with a student org and made a group of friends there, including someone I'll call Kara. Kara and I often will eat lunch together in the cafeteria or go for walks. One time Peggy and Kara both asked me to make plans at the same time, so I decided to ask them if they'd like to get a meal together (something low key). I always feel awkward when I know both people but they don't know each other, though I will say it went pretty well. (We actually tried a really good brunch place, so even when there were lulls in the convo, at least we could comment on the food.)

**CHALLENGE:** However, I have plans with Kara tomorrow night (she asked me to do something), and for some reason, I'm thinking about just limiting the plan to Kara, and not including Peggy. I don't think Kara would mind, but it's just hard to explain since sometimes I do want 1 on 1 time with a friend. Also, Kara and I like to talk about things related to our student org, and I wouldn't want Peggy to feel left out. Kara and I do regular walks three days a week, and usually Peggy is free then, so I feel like I should ask her (and there's always a chance Peggy asks to join me, not knowing I have plans with Kara). One time I didn't come back to our dorm and just camped out in the student lounge, because Peggy would probably ask where I was going and I didn't want to just show up to my plan with Kara with Peggy without checking with her first.

Idk why I'm struggling to navigate this situation. I don't want Peggy to think that I'm not friends with her anymore, but it feels awkward if I just start inviting her to all my hangouts with the student org. But then when I invited her to brunch with Kara, she was really eager to come along.

Does anyone get what I'm trying to get at? I want to spend time with both Peggy and Kara and my student org friends, but I'm not sure if I'm handling it right. (I'm pretty clueless with how to make friends, given I've only had a couple of close ones.)",1,1731472002.0,FriendshipAdvice,3,1.0,False

1gq4o3t,https://www.reddit.com/r/coworkerstories/comments/1gq4o3t/i_think_my_coworker_is_trying_to_get_me_fired_and/,I think my coworker is trying to get me fired and I don't know why.,"Hi, everyone. I don't normally post on here, but I'm kind of a the end of my rope and would appreciate any input. I (20F) am one of three supervisors/shift leads at a small business coffee shop, I'm also a college student.              
                                          I got along pretty well with one of the other supervisors (40F) up until a couple weeks ago. She normally works opening shifts and I normally work closing ones. Opening shifts can be substantially busier than closing shifts, but they also have a lot less cleaning and stocking tasks. In spite of this, I'm often left with a lot of dishes and stocking that opening is supposed to do before they leave. Now, this didn't really bother me, because I usually have time to pick up the slack and I'm also NOT one to complain or tattle on people. If there's an issue, I'll just fix it myself and forget about it.

The problem started when this coworker started consistently posting complaints about this and that to the work groupchat and basically how everyone except her has to ""do better"". I ignored it. But recently she posted photos proving how closing shift never leaves opening shift with enough cups in the cabinet and how ""they don't have time to stock cups in the morning"". Yes, they do, I've worked mornings before. Additionally, the reason they didn't have as many cups as they wanted was because my closing shift had had to prepare for an event. But, again, I let it go. 

The thing that really pushed me over the edge was that she reported me to our boss because apparently I don't make enough eye contact with her when she's talking and it makes her feel like I'm not paying attention. I can't speak for anyone else's feelings, but the reasons for my ""bad eye contact"" are 1. If I'm clocked in, I'm gonna start working whether your talking or not and 2. I'm literally neurodivergent. Luckily the boss has a brain and I didn't get punished for this. We also have a kind of elf on the shelf type game that we play with a gnome I bought as a Halloween decoration. We hide it every day and write a poem on the white board with a hint. When the whole cup thing happened she threw a fit about the gnome, shoved it God knows where and wrote a passive-aggressive note for me on the board about how I'd better stock cups if I want to keep the gnome around. I don't give a damn about the gnome. I didn't even come up with the game. But I took the gnome back because people threatening my belongings rubs me the wrong way. 

Anyway, sorry for the long post. I'm just so confused and exhausted. I love my job, but if this keeps up I will not hesitate to quit. Any advice?",12,1731471731.0,coworkerstories,3,0.88,False
1gq4nn8,https://www.reddit.com/r/Problem_SoHome/comments/1gq4nn8/the_appeal_of_small_home_projects_designing_cozy/,"The Appeal of Small Home Projects: Designing Cozy, Affordable Living Spaces","In recent years, small home projects have gained immense popularity, not only for their charm but also for their practicality. For those looking to own a cozy space without the burden of constant upkeep, a smaller home can offer an attractive and functional solution. This appeal extends to homeowners on a limited budget or those who want to build on a small plot of land without compromising essential living areas. This article explores a 65-square-meter one-story house design featuring two bedrooms, a full bathroom, a living room, and a kitchen—all thoughtfully laid out to maximize comfort and efficiency.

# Why Small Homes Are So Appealing

Small homes present an ideal balance for people looking for a practical and efficient living solution. These homes offer a cozier, simpler environment, reducing heating costs and requiring less maintenance. Rising material costs further drive this trend, with [small projects offering](https://www.reddit.com/r/Home_Garden_Solution/comments/1gpdvm5/small_house_design_compact_modern_living_solutions/) a more accessible pathway to homeownership while still incorporating essential comforts and amenities.

# Efficient Design for a Compact Space

This particular house is structured around the idea of maximizing every square meter. Despite its modest size, the house layout includes a boiler room, bathroom, and open kitchen-living space that flows seamlessly into a terrace. The terrace not only expands the living area but also creates a beautiful outdoor space for relaxing, reading, or enjoying a morning coffee—an element that many people dream of having in their homes.

# Key Features of This Small Home Design

1. **Multi-Purpose Rooms**: The boiler room can double as a laundry or storage room, ensuring maximum utility. This space allows for the installation of filters and boiler equipment without crowding other areas of the home.
2. **Bedroom Layouts for Privacy**: The house includes two bedrooms, each equipped with ample closet space and arranged to ensure privacy. The layout appeals to both young families and older adults who prefer a cozy, manageable home with dedicated sleeping spaces.
3. **Natural Lighting**: With large windows throughout the kitchen, living room, and bathroom, the home capitalizes on natural light. This design choice minimizes the need for artificial lighting during the day, enhancing the ambiance and helping to reduce energy costs.
4. **Outdoor Integration**: The terrace adds a functional outdoor living area, perfect for social gatherings or quiet relaxation. This space can be customized with furniture like tables, chairs, or even outdoor sofas, giving homeowners a versatile extension of their living area.
5. **Cost-Effective Construction Materials**: The house can be built from various materials, including aerated concrete blocks or expanded clay blocks. The flexibility in material choices allows for adjustments based on budget, without compromising quality or appearance.

# Practical and Functional Interior Layout

The layout was crafted to support efficiency and functionality, avoiding unnecessary corridors and ensuring all space is well-utilized. Upon entering, a closet area is available for hanging coats and storing shoes. The bathroom, spacious and equipped with a niche for a washing machine, sits conveniently to the left of the entryway. The open-plan kitchen and living area creates a welcoming space for cooking, dining, and relaxing without feeling cramped.

For those who enjoy cooking, the kitchen, while small, includes adequate preparation surfaces and storage. If desired, the layout can accommodate a kitchen island, but a simpler table may be more suitable for a home of this size. The large window overlooking the terrace provides an abundance of light and a sense of openness, enhancing the atmosphere of the main living area.

# Expanding or Customizing the Layout

This house also offers the potential for customization. With only one load-bearing wall, expanding the house to increase its area can be done without significant changes to the structural design. This flexibility allows homeowners to add space for an office, play area, or additional storage, further adapting the home to individual needs.

# Small Homes, Big Dreams

For individuals who prioritize simplicity, functionality, and cost-efficiency, a smaller home provides a perfect balance. A well-designed compact home can meet all the needs of modern living while keeping costs manageable. Whether you’re a young couple, a retiree looking to downsize, or simply someone who values efficient space usage, small home projects can be an inspiring choice, merging affordability with comfort.

By focusing on small home projects, homeowners can achieve their dreams without overextending themselves financially. This style of home is not just a trend but a thoughtful, practical approach to housing that resonates with people around the world. With clever design and the right materials, even the smallest of homes can be a personal sanctuary, offering all the essentials in a compact, beautifully crafted space.
