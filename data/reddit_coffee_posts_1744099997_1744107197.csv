Guests are stuck on which hotels to pick when traveling with kids. There are many family friendly properties but you need to book in advance. 

A family-friendly safari is a must. Parks like Tarangire and Lake Manyara offer shorter game drives and abundant wildlife, from elephants and giraffes to playful monkeys and colorful birds. Many lodges cater to kids with special programs and guides who love working with young explorers. 

If you're heading to Zanzibar, the beaches are paradise for families. Shallow waters, calm waves, and activities like snorkeling, boat rides, and meeting giant tortoises on Prison Island make for unforgettable experiences. My daughter age 7 has a fascination for tortoises since my last trip to Seychelles and now wants one as a pet!

For a cultural twist, visiting a Maasai village is both fun and eye-opening. Kids can learn about local traditions, try dancing, and even join a spear-throwing demo or jumping contest. Add in a trip to the Snake Park near Arusha or a coffee farm tour near Moshi, and you‚Äôve got a well-rounded itinerary.

Tanzania is also a place to slow down and enjoy nature, chasing waterfalls in Materuni or doing a craft workshop with local artists are peaceful, engaging ways to spend a day.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------

Creating an outdoor kitchen is an exciting venture, allowing you to blend cooking, dining, and entertainment in your backyard. One of the most critical decisions you'll make is selecting the best countertop for outdoor kitchens. The right material not only enhances aesthetics but also improves functionality and durability. With a range of options, you can find the perfect fit for your outdoor space.

### Key Features to Consider

Before diving into specific materials, it‚Äôs important to understand what you should look for in an outdoor kitchen countertop:

- **Durability:** Outdoor countertops should withstand weather conditions, including rain, sun, and temperature changes.
- **Maintenance:** Choose a material that is easy to clean and maintain.
- **Style:** The countertop should complement your outdoor decor and design style.
- **Budget:** Consider your budget when selecting materials, as costs can vary significantly.

### Popular Countertop Materials

Here‚Äôs a look at some of the best materials for outdoor kitchen countertops, each with unique advantages:

Check pricing here: https://itrendworld.com/best-countertop-for-outdoor-kitchen  
  
#### Granite

Granite is a classic choice for outdoor kitchens. This natural stone offers remarkable durability and is heat resistant, so you can place hot pots directly on the surface without worry. Available in many colors and patterns, granite fits into virtually any design scheme. It's also resistant to moisture and UV rays, making it a great choice for various climates.

#### Concrete

Concrete countertops provide a versatile option due to their customizability. You can stain, etch, or mold concrete to fit your specific style. Not only is concrete durable, but it can also withstand the elements. However, it does require sealing to prevent stains and moisture penetration. With a little care, concrete can maintain its beauty for many years.

Check pricing here: https://itrendworld.com/best-countertop-for-outdoor-kitchen  
  
#### Composite Materials

Composite countertops often blend materials like quartz, resin, and natural stones, offering the look of high-end stone while being more affordable. This material is non-porous, which means it resists stains and bacteria, making it easy to clean.Composite options come in various colors and patterns, allowing you to find something that perfectly matches your outdoor style.

#### Tile

Tile countertops are a popular choice because they offer endless design possibilities. You can select from a variety of colors and patterns, and tiles often come with slip-resistant surfaces, adding safety in wet conditions. One downside is that grout lines can stain or crack over time. Regular maintenance is essential to keep tile countertops looking their best, but the visual appeal can truly enhance your outdoor kitchen.

Check pricing here: https://itrendworld.com/best-countertop-for-outdoor-kitchen  
  
#### Stainless Steel

If you‚Äôre looking for a sleek, modern look, stainless steel is an excellent option. This material is tough and can handle extreme temperatures, and its resistance to rust makes it suitable for all weather conditions. Although it can scratch easily, many people appreciate its industrial aesthetic, especially in contemporary outdoor kitchens.

### Benefits of Selecting the Right Countertop

Choosing the best countertop for your outdoor kitchen has numerous benefits that go beyond aesthetics:

Check pricing here: https://itrendworld.com/best-countertop-for-outdoor-kitchen  
  
- **Enhanced Functionality:** The right countertop can improve your cooking experience, making food preparation more manageable and enjoyable.
- **Increased Property Value:** A well-designed outdoor kitchen can significantly enhance your home‚Äôs value, especially with high-quality materials.
- **Comfortable Dining Experience:** An attractive countertop setup encourages outdoor dining and entertaining with family and friends.

In essence, the best countertop for your outdoor kitchen will significantly influence its overall functionality and appeal. Think about the material that best suits your needs and style preferences. Whether you go for the timeless elegance of granite or the modern twist of stainless steel, your outdoor kitchen will become a beloved gathering space, inviting long meals and cherished memories in the fresh air.

So, take your time to weigh your options. Your outdoor kitchen deserves a countertop that reflects your personal style while enduring the elements.

Design Tips for Creating a Stunning Outdoor Kitchen Space
---------------------------------------------------------

Creating a beautiful outdoor kitchen is a fantastic way to enjoy cooking and dining outside. With the right design tips, you can transform your backyard into a culinary haven. Here are some essential considerations to help you design a stunning outdoor kitchen space that suits your lifestyle and tastes.

Check pricing here: https://itrendworld.com/best-countertop-for-outdoor-kitchen  
  
### Choose the Right Location

The placement of your outdoor kitchen is crucial. Consider the following:

- **Sunlight and Shade:** Choose a spot that balances sunlight and shade. You might want direct sunlight for morning coffee but prefer shade in the afternoons.
- **Proximity to Indoor Kitchen:** Having your outdoor kitchen close to your indoor kitchen can make transporting food and supplies much easier.
- **Privacy:** Consider the noise and visibility from neighbors. A more private location can enhance your outdoor dining experience.

### Pick Durable Materials

Outdoor kitchens face the elements, so durability is key. Here are some materials to consider for different surfaces:

Check pricing here: https://itrendworld.com/best-countertop-for-outdoor-kitchen  
  
- **Countertops:** Choose heat-resistant materials such as granite, quartz, or concrete. These are easy to clean and won‚Äôt warp in the sun.
- **Cabinets:** Stainless steel is a popular choice for outdoor cabinets as it is resistant to rust and corrosion.
- **Flooring:** Opt for slip-resistant tiles or stone to ensure safety, especially when wet.

### Plan Out Your Layout Wisely

The layout of your kitchen can either make or break your outdoor cooking experience. Here‚Äôs how to optimize it:

- **Work Triangle:** Like in indoor kitchens, aim for a working triangle between your grill, sink, and refrigerator. This layout maximizes efficiency.
- **Group Your Zones:** Consider your different cooking areas (grilling, prep, and dining) and arrange them in a logical order to streamline your cooking process.
- **Dining Area:** Incorporate a dining area that allows for easy access to food and drinks, promoting a seamless flow.

### Incorporate Essential Appliances

Investing in quality appliances is vital to enhance functionality. Consider these staples:

Check pricing here: https://itrendworld.com/best-countertop-for-outdoor-kitchen  
  
- **Grill:** Whether gas, charcoal, or electric, choose a grill that matches your cooking style.
- **Refrigerator:** An outdoor-rated refrigerator will keep drinks and ingredients cool and within reach.
- **Sink:** A sink allows for easy cleanup and food preparation, making your outdoor space very practical.

### Add Comfort and Style

Don't forget about aesthetics and comfort when designing your outdoor kitchen. Here are ways to elevate the look:

- **Lighting:** Soft ambient lighting, such as string lights or pendant fixtures, can create a cozy atmosphere for evening gatherings.
- **Seating:** Comfortable seating options, like bar stools or lounge chairs, can encourage people to linger and enjoy the space.
- **Landscaping:** Surround your kitchen with beautiful plants and flowers to enhance the overall ambiance and create a welcoming space.

### Consider Weather Protection

Your outdoor kitchen should be functional year-round. Think about these features:

Check pricing here: https://itrendworld.com/best-countertop-for-outdoor-kitchen  
  
- **Gazebo or Pergola:** A structure can offer shade and protection from rain, allowing you to cook and dine comfortably.
- **Windbreaks:** Planting bushes or installing walls can help shield your space from strong winds.
- **Heating Options:** Install heaters for cooler evenings, ensuring you can enjoy your space no matter the season.

Creating a stunning outdoor kitchen space is an investment in your home and lifestyle. By considering location, materials, layout, functionality, comfort, and protection from the elements, you can create a space that not only enhances your cooking experience but also becomes a sought-after gathering spot for family and friends. With thoughtful planning and design, your outdoor kitchen can be both beautiful and functional, maximizing your outdoor living experience.

### Conclusion

When it comes to selecting the best countertop for your outdoor kitchen, understanding the various materials available is essential. Each option, be it granite, quartz, tile, or concrete, offers unique benefits that cater to different styles and practical needs. Granite is celebrated for its durability and elegance, while quartz provides a non-porous surface that‚Äôs easy to maintain. Tile adds versatility with endless design possibilities, whereas concrete can be molded into any shape, giving you a custom feel. By assessing these materials based on your lifestyle, cooking habits, and aesthetic preferences, you can choose a countertop that not only enhances your outdoor kitchen's functionality but also reflects your personal style.

Designing a stunning outdoor kitchen space takes thoughtfulness and creativity. Incorporate elements like color coordination, proper lighting, and cozy seating to create an inviting atmosphere. Ensure that your countertop complements the overall design and serves as a focal point. Thinking about layouts that facilitate smooth movement while cooking and entertaining can elevate your outdoor experience. Remember to blend practical aspects, like storage and workspace, with design elements that make your outdoor kitchen a true extension of your home.

He came from a 9 year long relationship. But just when you think it‚Äôs bad enough, it will get worse..

1. Maganda si ex. Like mestisa type of ganda. Tipong pwede ipasok sa PBB.
2. Close si ex sa family. Lalo na sa mga ate ni guy. And boto talaga yung parents sa kanya. (Again, maganda kasi talaga si girl)
3. Ended in good terms sila. Nag hiwalay lang kasi bumalik sa US si girl. 
4. First in everything talaga si girl. First jowa, first long term, highschool sweethearts at TOTGA talaga ni guy. 
5. Umuwi yan si girl last week sa pinas. Like what I said, close siya sa fam. Nag coffee date pa sila nung 2 na ate ni guy :/ (pero no contact na sila ni guy)

According to her mother, he was a catch a manager at a renowned company with a five-figure monthly salary.

At just 24 years old, Clara had been pressured by her mother to get married to the point that she was afraid to return home. So here she was, reluctantly going on yet another blind date. She wanted to meet this so-called catch, yet his first question was about her income.

You‚Äôre sitting in my caf√© now, Clara said, maintaining her polite smile. After her blind date scrutinized around, looking pleased, she added, But I‚Äôve yet to break even. The man‚Äôs expression shifted. I take it that you‚Äôre operating at a loss right now. She nodded, and he responded with a frown. Well, did you invest with your own money or borrow from others? How much debt do you have?

The reason it works- it forces you to focus on something other than your panic. 

A series of random, unrelated, and unnatural tasks. 

I have index cards with 3-5 unrelated tasks written on each. Each subsequent task is in a separate room, but may return to the previous room. The tasks should NOT cause damage and should NOT be overly complicated- just unnatural to you. 

Some examples- 

1- drink a glass of water while standing on my bed; put a shoe in the bath tub; get a rock from the back yard and smell it; mix clay or paint to color match a random item. 

2- rearrange spices in alphabetical order of the LAST letter in the name; put 3 ice cubes in the toilet; put a banana on head as a hat and hum the national anthem; drink 4oz water from a bowl with a spoon. 

3- eat 5 ice cubes out of a glass of water using chopsticks; lay on floor in garage, balance a socket on forehead, make snow angles without dropping the socket; fold dirty laundry while putting it into the washing machine; put keys in the refrigerator.


Some others that work on their own-

-choose a category and a person's name, name something in that category for each letter of the name(i.e. Sarah, animals. Snake, ardvark, raccoon,  antelope, hamster). May need to repeat a few times- starting with an easy subject like animals or foods, work towards more difficult. It forces you to think and focus on a category- names with repeating letters need a different thing for each repeat, so it makes you keep track of what you've used already. 

-rename objects with overly descriptive names. Coffee maker is already there. Refrigerator though- that's now the hypothermic food preservation unit. Pencils are handheld graphite dispensing rods. This forces you to think about the functions of objects that you may not ever think about. That focus draws focus away from panic.

-randomized stairs or stepping on tiles. Up 7 stars, down 3, up 2, down 4, up 5, then back downstairs. I have stars and 12""x12"" tiles, so i do random numbers for the stairs then go to center livingroom and do the same on tiles- 7 forward, 3 left, 2 right, 4 back, 5 forward. To amp it up, i poke things. 7 windows, 3 sinks, 2 doors, 4 pots/pans, 5 light switches. Or sit on things- bed x7, counch x3, floor x2, stairs x4, kitchen counter x5.

I'm 16. My dad cheated on my mom with a woman called Ronnie when I was a kid. My parents divorced because of it and my dad moved in with Ronnie. I found out everything from my cousin and it made me really dislike my dad and Ronnie. I was 6 when my parents separated, dad moved in with Ronnie and I found out why. My dad and Ronnie were together until I was 8 and then they broke up. Dad dated a bit and then he and Ronnie got back together. Then they broke up after another year. Dad dated some more. Then they got back together again two-ish years ago and now they're engaged.

My relationship with dad improved a little at one point. I still disliked Ronnie. a lot  But I liked other girlfriends of my dad's more. One reason he gives for those relationships ending and him going back to Ronnie is the fact she has always tried really hard with me. He wants that. He didn't like feeling like his ex's could be fine with me not being there. But he's fine with me not wanting Ronnie there but I guess that's nothing to do with them.

Ronnie has been jealous of my relationship with my mom since she and dad became official the first time. She tried to be equal or even more than my mom but she never stood a chance with me. It drove her crazy. Apparently it was the reason for one of their breakups. The fact that I was cold and distant and never let her in. I was passably civil always but that was it. You could see I didn't like her and wasn't trying with her. I didn't have the same issues with the other women but I also liked that they weren't trying to be mommy 2.0.

This last time dad got back together with Ronnie our relationship with dad got worse again. Probably the worst it's ever been. He told me he loved her and she was the one and he wanted us to be a family. And I told him I would never want to be a family with her and if that meant we weren't a family anymore either then I'd deal with it. He asked me to forget about the cheating and accept that he loves Ronnie and he hasn't loved my mom for a very long time. I told him I couldn't accept it and he couldn't make me accept it. We're now in this really awkward place.

Ronnie's been trying extra hard since she moved back in with dad. She keeps trying to make plans with me. Some stuff I was planning to do with mom and I told her so and other times I just didn't want to go with her. Now she's making the most out of the wedding when dad has his custody week with me. She dragged me dress shopping a few times and tried to make plans with me. Whenever I was dragged dress shopping I ignored her buried myself in my phone for the 1-2 hour long consultations. The last time we went she found a dress she really loved and I wasn't even paying attention. I was texting with mom about something and Ronnie took my phone from my hand and saw who I was texting. I took the phone back off her and told her to never do that again.

Ronnie was crying and she told me even for a moment like this she couldn't leave my mom out of it and enjoy the moment with her. That she'll always come second. She told me she could be on her death bed and I'd choose to grab a coffee with my mom instead of saying goodbye to her. I rolled my eyes and she kept rambling on. So then I looked her in the eye and told her my mom would ALWAYS come first. That it didn't matter what she's going through because I love my mom and would pick my mom even if I didn't have to. I told her I would choose a stranger over her. And the sooner she accepts it the better.

My dad got so mad at me because Ronnie didn't continue with her consultation and she cried for hours when we got back. She cried the next day too.

symptoms:

1)intolerant to heat - spinning head, numbness in my hands (pins and needles) and feet, feeling faint with high heartbeat - i used to think that it is from panic attacks, but since i started this biohacking route i noticed heats role in those said panic attacks.

2)ofc i have some problems with digestive track :) but less constipation and more in loose stools once in while, bloating or pains. but these subsided since i dont eat gluten, dairy or sugar. 

3) skin problems - everything seems textbook for sluggish detox pathways.

anyways. i now drink b9, b12 and b6 - methylated forms. and i feel better regards numbness problem... but pre period symptoms i havent had in like a year since i started to change my life - pain in my tailbone, lower belly, sore af breasts and increased acne... is it normal? will it improve when my detox pathways improve and ""digest"" estrogen better? did any of you ever had that and what did you do to make it better?

what i do in addition to that - vit D3 + k2, omega, and feritin supplements, aswell as NAC and MSM with mastic gum for suspected h.pyllori problem for digestive problems. i drink and do my own daily bone broth for gut lining, my diet has enough fats and protein as well as berries and veggies to suuport digestion and detoxification. I do jumping in the morning for 10 mins and over all i exercise for atleast 30 mins a day (sometimes less if i feel like shit) and i walk everywhere. i do dry brushing few times a week. i sleep atleast 7 hours and have a routine, but i can work on that better. i drink coffee, black, sometimes with l-theanine for stress support. i avoid as much as possible chemicals in my food and home... 

anyways.. sorry for long read, but i would appreciate any help i can get :) i asked chat gpt since in my country everything about this is so so so so expensive and not insurance covered and it said thats its fine and that it should improve since my body is adjusting with detoxification... let me know :)",1,1744104513.0,MTHFR,0,1.0,False

For any ""dates"" (loosely referring to them as such) that I go on, they are just a low-key sit down, getting to know one another face to faces at a neutral space (most likely a local coffee shop because I dont drink alcohol and have weekdays off, plus they are fairly deserted in the late morning/early afternoon) and leaving separately. No matter how someone behaves online, they are always different in person vs that projected facade, and wanting to get to know them there is always a step I take.

I am just super relaxed as a person and, honestly, it kind of showcases that. Any additional dates require input from them, because I want to know we are doing something both of us enjoy. These additional dates can end up in the bedroom if desired by both parties, but are not expected to.

That being said, I simply wonder, how do you handle a first date with a potential new partner?

Let‚Äôs Rate + Share Tips for Better Consistency!,"**üß† Be Honest: How Often Do You Actually Stick to Your Morning Routine? Let‚Äôs Rate + Share Tips for Better Consistency!**

Okay, let‚Äôs be real for a second. How many of you hit that snooze button like it‚Äôs your best friend? üôã‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è I mean, there‚Äôs nothing quite like those extra five minutes in bed‚Ä¶ or is it really just a slippery slope into chaos? 

Every morning, there we are, armed with our perfectly curated morning routines. Whether it's a killer workout, meditation, or a nourishing breakfast, we‚Äôve got big plans! But let‚Äôs face it, life happens, and sometimes our intentions get about as far as our coffee pots make it. 

So, how often do we actually *stick* to the game plan? Here‚Äôs a little breakdown based on my own rollercoaster of routine attempts:

- **Some Days:** You wake up feeling like a rockstar ready to crush it! ü¶∏‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Routine? Check! Healthy breakfast? Check! 
- **Most Days:** You roll out of bed like a zombie, bleary-eyed, and suddenly breakfast is whatever you can find that doesn‚Äôt require cooking. ü•¥ 
- **Every Now and Then:** You manage a whole week of sticking to it, and then BAM! Life hits you like a freight train. 

Okay, let's talk about why sticking to our morning routines can feel like chasing unicorns. 

1. **Lack of Flexibility:** Sometimes the routine feels too rigid. Ever tried meditating for 20 minutes only to realize you‚Äôve spent 15 minutes trying to remember what you were supposed to be focusing on? 

2. **Setting Unrealistic Goals:** Sure, waking up at 5 AM sounds great, until you realize you‚Äôre more of a ‚Äúwake-up-when-it‚Äôs-light-out‚Äù person. üò¥ 

3. **Distractions Are Everywhere:** Social media, email, the latest Netflix binge... what‚Äôs real and what‚Äôs not? Hello, rabbit hole! 

But here‚Äôs the kicker: we can pivot! üéâ 

**A Few Tips for Better Consistency:** 

- **Start Small:** Maybe it‚Äôs just **5 minutes** of stretching or **3 minutes** of gratitude journaling. Baby steps!
  
- **Mix It Up:** Who says you have to meditate every day? Switch it with a podcast on your morning walk. Flexibility can keep things fresh.
  
- **Accountability Buddy:** Find a friend who‚Äôs also in this morning routine boat. Check in with each other and celebrate those little wins. 

- **Prepare the Night Before:** Lay out your workout clothes, prep breakfast, or even write down a quick to-do list. Less thinking means more doing! 

- **Stay Kind to Yourself:** If you stumble, it‚Äôs okay! Life happens. Tomorrow is a fresh start. üåÖ

So, where do you land on the routine scale? Are you a morning warrior or more of a consistent snoozer? Let‚Äôs chat about this journey together! Share your wins, your epic fails, and let‚Äôs figure out how to keep each other motivated.

## Beyond ""Keep Calm"": Alternative stress Relief Strategies

While the ""Keep Calm and Carry On"" message provides a helpful reminder to stay resilient and focused, it's not a extensive solution to stress management. In today's fast-paced world, it's essential to develop a range of coping strategies to effectively manage stress and maintain well-being. Here are a few alternative approaches:

* **Mindfulness and Meditation:** Practicing mindfulness and meditation techniques can help you become more aware of your thoughts and feelings, allowing you to respond to stressful situations with greater calm and clarity.

* **Physical Activity:** Exercise is a powerful stress reliever. Whether it's a brisk walk, a yoga class, or a gym workout, physical activity releases endorphins, which have mood-boosting effects.* **Spending Time in Nature:** Studies have shown that spending time in nature can reduce stress hormones and improve overall well-being. Even a short walk in a park can have a significant impact.* **Connecting with Loved Ones:** Social connection is crucial for mental and emotional health. Spending time with friends and family provides support, reduces feelings of isolation, and helps you cope with stress.

* **Creative expression:** Engaging in creative activities,such as painting,writing,or playing music,can provide an outlet for emotions and help you process stress in a healthy way.

* **Prioritizing sleep:** Adequate sleep is essential for both physical and mental health. Aim for 7-8 hours of sleep each night to allow your body and mind to recharge.

* **Healthy Diet:** A balanced diet provides the nutrients your body needs to function optimally. Avoid processed foods, excessive sugar, and caffeine, which can exacerbate stress levels.

* **Professional Help:** if you're struggling to manage stress on your own, don't hesitate to seek professional help from a therapist or counselor.They can provide guidance and support in developing effective coping strategies.

1ju91vl,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1ju91vl/my_31m_ex_26f_and_i_want_to_reconnect/,My (31M) Ex (26F) and I want to reconnect,"  I met this lovely woman and we hit it off right away. Our first date was great. Everything was great. I felt so connected and loved. We planned a trip to Hawaii.
 Backstory for the breakup: 11 months into the relationship we got accidentally pregnant (failed condom probably) and she decided to have an abortion. I agreed and supported her to the best of my ability. It wasnt the right time for a child. It was difficult for her, which is absolutely understandable. 2 weeks go by and we go on our trip, which turned out to be half amazing, and half miserable. I haven't ever been so far from home without my family. 
   
  We stayed with her family who live there to save money on a hotel. The caveat being that we couldn't sleep in the same room due to the family's religious beliefs.  I told her that was fine, it would be worth it to just be there with her.   But with the abortion trauma right behind us, and me sleeping in another room, being so far from home and comfort, I felt so distant from her.  I kinda shut down and wasn't happy or talkative. It put a strain on everyone in the house. We had a heart-to-heart and things got better, but there was a certain tension.  
  We get back home and talked about our relationship and everything that had happened. She told me that she felt like she was losing part of herself and becoming too much of me, which was a bad habit from past relationships, as she put it.
 We thought it be a good idea to take a break and take time for ourselves.  I had high hopes that we could work it out and mend the bond. In my eyes, nothing really terrible happened and we never fought or shouted at each other. We could talk about anything.
Two more weeks go by and she ends it completely.  I was crushed. We agreed to be civil and keep in touch, so we could keep our mutual friends and possibly reconnect in the future.    This was the last week of last October.  
  
Since January we've texted and met for coffee.  We went on a date last week, which was really nice. I felt the spark, the butterflies. I kissed her, and she kissed me back twice!  All good, right? 
  Well, Today we went out for dinner and she told me something had happened. Something she needed off her chest.
 She was at a mutual friend's (23M, now ex-friend) house, back in October while we were on the break. They got drunk, and she would keep coming in and out of consciousness. She woke up with his hand in her pants, and was pressured into sex while drunk.  

 I've known this guy for years, before I knew her.  I never thought he would do something like that.  I trusted both of them to hang out without me there. I know she is not a cheater.
  
 I believe her in this situation.  He did a shitty thing. It's not her fault, right? A small part of me does blame her for ""letting"" it happen. 
    I wonder if I can accept what happened, move on, and be truly happy with her and not see her as ""tainted"".  
 What should I do? 
Should I confront him?  
How should I talk to her about it?",1,1744102780.0,Advice,0,1.0,False

1ju90cs,https://www.reddit.com/r/FictionWriting/comments/1ju90cs/chapter_two_the_dean_isnt_human/,Chapter Two: The Dean Isn‚Äôt Human...,"*From ""The Troublemaker He Fell For""*

On the first day of school, I rode in the sleek black car heading to class.

Mr. Bai‚Äôs driving was exceptional‚Äîno matter how fast the car went or how sharp the turns were, not a drop of coffee ever spilled from his cup. No wonder Father trusts him. Today‚Äôs test: \[Passed\].

‚ÄúYoung Master! We‚Äôve arrived at Tetsukahana Academy. Do you nee‚Äî‚Äù

‚ÄúNo need! I‚Äôve got arms and legs, I can walk myself.‚Äù

As soon as I opened the door, sunlight poured into the car. This was... the first time I opened it myself.

The glare reflected off my pale skin as I squinted toward the school gates, taking timid steps forward. I was nervous... nervous I‚Äôd run into *him*.

Using the school map, I found Building C, Room F3. My classmates were already sitting neatly in their seats. Disliking the atmosphere, I strutted to the podium, pulled out a chair from beneath the lectern, sat down, and propped my legs on the table.

Everyone stared at me in shock. They whispered and gossiped. Some called me a brainless spoiled brat, others said I looked like a delinquent. I didn‚Äôt bother responding. Instead, I smirked and pulled a bayonet from my waist, hurling it at the bulletin board with force.

‚ÄúWhat are you doing?!‚Äù  
‚ÄúLetting the knife fly\~ Didn‚Äôt you see?‚Äù  
‚ÄúI‚Äôve been teaching ten years and never seen a student like you!‚Äù  
‚ÄúWell, now you have.‚Äù

This round, chubby teacher‚Ä¶ don‚Äôt tell me she‚Äôs our homeroom teacher? She doesn‚Äôt look like one at all...

I stood up in disdain, pulled a cigar from my pocket, and walked over to the planter. Just as I was about to clip the end‚Äî

‚ÄúThis is a school! You can‚Äôt smoke here, don‚Äôt you know that?‚Äù  
‚ÄúOh\~ really?‚Äù

Annoyed, I stepped into the hallway outside the classroom, ready to finish cutting the cigar. But just then‚Äî

A man across the corridor looked at me. I waved politely.

Suddenly, he threw a triangular ruler at me‚Äîit slashed my hand open. Blood welled up as I bent down and found a note attached to it:  
‚ÄúWu, don‚Äôt you know smoking is prohibited on campus?‚Äù

I looked up and saw the man giving me a chilling smile and a warning gesture.

Furious, I stormed toward the inner hallway to confront him, blood streaming down my arm. I no longer felt the pain‚ÄîI just wanted payback!

Then‚Äîsomething black flashed past me! I dodged by reflex, swinging a punch that barely missed.

The figure raised his head slowly, glaring at me with piercing eyes.

‚ÄúWu Baifeng... where do you think you‚Äôre going?‚Äù  
‚ÄúTo hell with you!‚Äù

That seemed to piss him off. His expression turned fierce. He grabbed my wrist hard and dragged me violently.

‚ÄúOw...‚Äù

Blood surged again. I could hardly fight back as tears welled up in my eyes.

Noticing the wound, his anger faded. He gently helped me sit on a bench, pulled out gauze and ointment, and carefully treated my injury.

‚ÄúDidn‚Äôt recognize me?‚Äù  
‚ÄúWho the hell are you?‚Äù

He took off his black blazer and pushed aside his messy hair. That familiar face appeared.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm the Dean of Student Affairs. I‚Äôm Zhang Yingfang.‚Äù  
‚ÄúYou‚Äôre the guy from the day I enrolled‚Ä¶‚Äù  
‚ÄúFinally remembered, Wu Baifeng.‚Äù

Just then, the intercom buzzed:  
‚ÄúAll students and faculty, please assemble on the sports field for the flag-raising ceremony.‚Äù

Zhang Yingfang glanced at his watch, his brow creasing in anxiety.

‚ÄúNo time! Come with me.‚Äù

He pulled me through the crowd. People bumped into us from all directions as we tried to find my class, but failed.

‚ÄúCan you stay near the podium for now? I can‚Äôt find your homeroom group.‚Äù

I nodded obediently and followed.

After the national and flag anthems, the principal saluted a portrait of Sun Yat-sen and handed the mic to Zhang Yingfang.

‚ÄúAhem. Hello, students! I‚Äôm your newly appointed Dean of Student Affairs. If you ever need anything, you can come to me‚Äîbut let me warn you, if you don‚Äôt behave‚Ä¶ I may not write you up, but I‚Äôll make sure you *never* want to mess up again.‚Äù

Students murmured below. He wore an unnatural smile, his handsome face unreadable beneath his black suit. What was he really thinking?

‚ÄúOh! One more thing. The infirmary is right next to my office. Don‚Äôt wander around if you‚Äôre injured. And ask the teacher before heading there. Otherwise‚ÄîI‚Äôll be angry\~‚Äù

His velvety voice mesmerized us freshmen. His gentlemanly salute was pure charm.

At noon, I wandered the campus. From the sports field to the courtyard, silver snow-lotus and lavender bloomed along the way, a strange aura of death hanging in the air. Maybe that‚Äôs why the uniforms are gray. The buildings, gray and white. The dean always in black. Something about this school felt‚Ä¶ off.

In the distance stood a familiar figure, holding a strange necklace, murmuring to a stone.

Curious, I crept closer to listen.

‚ÄúBaifeng‚Ä¶ do you know why the school‚Äôs colors are gray and white?‚Äù

‚ÄúHow would I know? I was just about to ask why this school is even called *Tetsukahana Academy*!‚Äù

Zhang Yingfang looked up at the sky, pondering his answer.

‚ÄúBaifeng‚Ä¶ do you know the Iron Chancellor, Bismarck? He‚Äôs in your junior high textbooks. The founder wanted students to inherit his spirit. This school survived the Japanese occupation, survived World War II, and still wasn‚Äôt destroyed. The founder was Japanese, named Hanano Tanano. That‚Äôs why the school is called *Tetsukahana*. But the buildings and uniforms? Those are recent changes, because‚Ä¶‚Äù

His face darkened, like recalling something painful. He picked a flower, crushed it in his hand, and scattered the petals into the wind, again looking up at the sky.

Suddenly‚Äî

‚ÄúXiao Hei! I brought the canvas you asked for!‚Äù

A student in uniform ran over holding a huge canvas, looking a bit like Zhang Yingfang.

‚ÄúLingjia! You‚Äôre finally here! I was about to fall asleep waiting!‚Äù

‚ÄúNot my fault‚Äîyou throw your stuff everywhere. Took me forever to find it.‚Äù

Zhang pulled out a rubber band from his pocket, tied his hair back, and took the canvas, sitting down right there to paint.

He looked like a prince from a manga while painting‚Ä¶ if only he‚Äôd ditch that black suit.

Watching him paint so quietly, I didn‚Äôt want to disturb him, so I left the courtyard.

As I passed the bulletin board, I glanced over the list of clubs: paranormal club, art club, dessert club, hip-hop dance, board games‚Ä¶ all sorts. But I preferred the school team. I‚Äôd ask about it later at the academic office.

After school, I got into the black car again‚Ä¶ thinking about what Zhang Yingfang said earlier. That sorrowful look on his face‚Äîwhat had happened to make him look that sad?

The next morning, Mr. Bai drove me as usual. But this time, there were two unfamiliar people at the school gate. Patrol officers? But they weren‚Äôt wearing uniforms‚Ä¶

I squinted, face pressed to the window, trying to see who they were.

‚ÄúHi\~ Baifeng! Good morning!‚Äù

Before Mr. Bai could open the door, Zhang Yingfang opened it like a butler welcoming his master home.

‚ÄúHmph. Morning... Dean.‚Äù

I playfully grabbed his collar and leaned in close to his ear.

‚ÄúThis is the school gate. Show some respect.‚Äù

He growled angrily, his expression turning scary.

It was the first time anyone outside my family had yelled at me. Furious, I pulled out the bayonet at my waist and pressed it to his throat, eyes sharp with rage.

‚ÄúWanna see God today?‚Äù

But Zhang Yingfang didn‚Äôt show a trace of fear‚Äîjust a strange, knowing smile. That smile sent a chill down my spine.

1ju8y3v,https://www.reddit.com/r/QueerParenting/comments/1ju8y3v/question_for_queer_parents_about_confidentiality/,Question for queer parents about confidentiality,"Here's the situation:

I volunteer at an LGBTQ+ community center a couple of evenings each week, when it's adults 18+ and only.

On a different evening each week, a queer youth group, ages 12-17, meets at the community center. They have their own adults to chaperone them, and plan activities for them.  
  
All adults who are volunteers must pass a background check for the safety of the kids. Otherwise, we take no names; a person can be as anonymous as they wish to be while they're visiting the community center.

Occasionally, someone will bring a younger child to the Youth Group events, which is not a big deal as far as I know.

What' \*is\* a big deal is this:

On Saturdays, the place is open to all ages, and lately a few parents have been bringing their toddlers into the community center and just letting them run wild.

THAT is a problem.  
  
It's a problem due to the place not being safe for toddlers, because of bookcases not anchored to walls (which can't be helped; long story) and bins of sharp objects (pencils, scissors) within each reach of a two-year-old, not to mention coffee tables with very sharp corners.  
  
It's a problem because some adult guests don't really care to have toddlers screaming, grabbing things from them, hitting them, and so forth.

Yes, the adults who don't like those things could stay away on Saturdays, but that day might be the only day they have to visit the place. And if anyone is donating money to keep the place open, it's THEM, not the parents of toddlers.

The solution WAS going to be that volunteers would ""catch"" a parent with a toddler at the door, welcome them, and explain to them that they have to be with their child AT ALL TIMES.

Now the solution has become this:

""Let's have one of the teenagers babysit the toddlers in one room so the parent(s) can relax or visit elsewhere in the community center!""

The parents can't leave the place; we're not doing ""drop off"" so they can run errands.

But ...

Because I've pointed out the potential hazards in the place, now the people who want to do this ""project"" have come up with an ""agreement"" that a parent must sign, indicating that the community center is not responsible if a child is injured there.

I don't think such an agreement will hold water if challenged in court, and I'm FAR more concerned about a child getting hurt (or killed by a falling bookshelf) than I am about being sued, but my questions are THESE:

Would you, as a queer parent, be okay with signing such an agreement and providing your name, address, and contact information?

I don't think I'd be okay with that, because what if someone breaks into the place and steals the files? What if there's a search warrant and the cops seize the files?

What do YOU think about it?

What would YOU do?

Provide the info and sign the agreement so you can hang out at the community center for four hours with your kid, one day a week, or turn around and leave?

So, I finally bit the bullet and tried making some. Besides a rookie mistake with additives that made my base smell a little funny, I'm really pleased with how it turned out for a first attempt. üòä

The soap was easy to load on my RazoRock and M√ºhle synthetic brushes, and just a tiny amount was enough to produce copious, thick lather.

Stop crying about your social life as a remote dev because you're also supposed to socialize outside of office. People who work in office are tired because their colleagues won't let them live in peace. Gl through scorching sun, sweat and pollution in your throat for the next few days to realize how grateful you should be. Besides that we live in Pakistan where relatives don't even let you die alone in peace and you can't socialize for some reason.

 I get it, believe me that office makes a large portion of socialization but that doesn't mean you shouldn't be socializing with your friends, cousins or family. Go to a fricking park, a pan shop, a vape shop, a coffee shop, tech events or anywhere else where there are people. If not anything else then just get admission in a cheap university near you to socialize with people.

Okay, friends, let me start with a bold claim: **to-do lists are overrated.** ü§Ø I mean, seriously, how many times have you felt the thrill of writing down everything you need to do, only to feel that creeping despair when you realize you‚Äôve *barely* managed to check off one or two items by the end of the day? 

I used to be *that* person‚Äîdrowning in a sea of tasks, feeling like a headless chicken. But then, something clicked. What if I could simplify all of that into just **10 minutes** each morning? 

Here's how I traded my long, anxiety-inducing to-do lists for a quick but super effective morning routine that‚Äôs turned my productivity game upside down. Buckle up! 

### The 10-Minute Morning Routine Breakdown: 

1. **Gratitude (2 minutes)**  
   - I grab my trusty journal and jot down **three things** I‚Äôm grateful for. 
   - It‚Äôs amazing how focusing on the positives can set a killer tone for the day! üí™

2. **Goal Check (2 minutes)**  
   - I peek at my *big* goals‚Äîthose dreams on the horizon. 
   - Just a quick reminder of why I‚Äôm getting up early and hustling. 

3. **Mindfulness (3 minutes)**  
   - Yup, I‚Äôm the person who sits in silence for a moment, sometimes with a cup of coffee in hand, just breathing deeply. 
   - Seriously, you‚Äôd be amazed at how calming this is. Kind of like a reboot for my brain. üßò‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

4. **Top 3 Priorities (3 minutes)**  
   - Instead of an endless list, I pick **three things** I want to tackle that day. 
   - It‚Äôs like a VIP pass for my to-do list! üéüÔ∏è

**Why did I make this switch?** 

- The clarity! I went from feeling overwhelmed to empowered. 
- Less stress, more smiley face emojis. üòÑ 
- And productivity? Let‚Äôs just say I‚Äôm humming through my work like I‚Äôm on a coffee-fueled rocket ship. 

Now, don‚Äôt get me wrong‚Äîthis isn‚Äôt some magic wand solution. There are days when I slip (hello, Monday mornings üò©), but the simplicity of the routine keeps me grounded.

### The Kickers:

- **No more scrolling** through endless tasks that end up draining my spirit. 
- **No more guilt** for the things I didn‚Äôt finish‚Äîbecause I‚Äôm focusing on what matters. 
- **More energy** to tackle life (and I‚Äôve convinced myself I can crush my dreams before breakfast). ü•ê‚ú®

So, what‚Äôs the takeaway? It‚Äôs all about working smarter, not harder. Life is too short to get lost in a never-ending list of things to do.

1ju8vrd,https://www.reddit.com/r/DiagnoseMe/comments/1ju8vrd/10_year_unsolved_health_mystery/,10 year unsolved health mystery,"I've had a chronic cough and throat clearly for 10 years, though it was initially mild and rarely problematic, it's drastically progressed over the last 2 years. I had a chronic cough as a child as well and was frequently diagnosed with bronchitis and activity induced asthma, but I ""grew out of it"" for a long time and have never had real symptoms of asthma besides wheezing. The cough has become a severe barking cough that's present 75% of the time and is incredibly disruptive to my daily life. I'm unable to pin-point specific triggers, as it fluctuates so drastically throughout each day. As a general rule standing, eating, drinking (especially coffee and soda) cold, hot air, perfume/chemical smells and inhaled irritants, etc. all seem to be triggers .. laying down reduces symptoms and laying specifically on my left side causes a deeper, more raspy/wheezy cough that helps actually relieve the tickle in my throat that causes the cough. The normal barking cough is dry, but it seems like if I can get the proper airflow out of my lungs I expel a white phlegm, but post nasal drainage is always present, so it's difficult to determine the source of the mucus the cough expels. The constant cough is caused by an irritation I can feel in my throat and I have to force a rumble barking cough to vibrate the area enough to ""scratch the itch"". However, this irritation that causes the cough reflex is significantly REDUCED or even eliminated while sick or following an illness. (I actually get excited when I have the flu because it means I get a week or 2 without this constant cough) This has been unexplained by all of the specialists I've consulted. I have a hypothesis that because most of the illnesses bring a productive cough from deeper in my lungs, it's satisfying whatever is causing the sensation because its able to produce what I'm unable to expel otherwise. It seems to reach further down into my lungs while sick (with any illness from COVID to a sinus infection).. I've attempted treatments and multiple medications following medical assumptions that is related to asthma, GERD, or severe allergies, all of which brought no relief. Initially I had an MRI, EKG and tilt table - which diagnosed POTS and NCS. I also had a CT scan, barium swallow to rule out GERD, and x-rays, which showed nothing. Over the last year I've had several more x-rays, an upper GI scope with biopsy, a different barium swallow test to analyze swallowing abilities, allergy testing, a head MRI, a laryngoscopy, and bloodwork, all showing no causes. A standard PFT showed Isolated air trapping/pulmonary hyperinflation of uncertain clinical significance and a thyroid ultrasound showed a partially calcified nodule in the right upper lobe - both were ruled insignificant to symptoms by the doctors. I've spent my savings on testing and consultations with several specialists and they just keep ordering the same tests I've already done. I'm desperate for answers and I don't know what else to do. I need someone who's interested in solving a puzzle!

I‚Äôm in my lover girl era again. I‚Äôve been through the quiet kind of healing, yung hindi obvious sa Instagram, pero halata sa kung paano ako mag set ng boundaries. The past year has been all about pain, growth, figuring things out, and realizing I want someone who matches my softness and my fire.

I‚Äôm not here to collect conversations. I‚Äôm here because I believe somewhere out there is a guy who‚Äôs ready too, emotionally available, mentally stable, and not a walking green flag sa simula lang.



About me:


‚Ä¢I‚Äôm 24, 5'6"", light morena (?), 55kg

‚Ä¢Certified yapper with a soft spot for late-night talks and surprise hugs

‚Ä¢Extrovert who thrives on connection but also knows when to give space

‚Ä¢Passionate about healthcare and making people feel safe and seen (iykyk - nurse duties)

‚Ä¢I love curating playlists and lowkey daydreaming about love through them

‚Ä¢Currently battling my TikTok addiction when I should be reading books

‚Ä¢Iced coffee over everything (even when it‚Äôs raining)

‚Ä¢K-dramas, Thriller movies and medical dramas (Grey's Anatomy supremacy, Friends for comfort)

‚Ä¢Hopeless romantic but emotionally aware, yes, I will talk about feelings

‚Ä¢Love language: physical touch and words of affirmation (in short, hug me and gaslight me into believing I‚Äôm pretty, joke lang sa gaslighting, pero seryoso sa pretty)

‚Ä¢I jog to clear my head, but still figuring out how to not overthink after



What I‚Äôm looking for:


‚Ä¢Someone decent, emotionally available, and a little cheesy (I swoon over words of affirmation, sorry not sorry)

‚Ä¢A man who‚Äôs emotionally mature, self-aware, and open to real connection, hindi lang bored or curious

‚Ä¢Someone who understands boundaries, values effort, and enjoys meaningful conversations as much as late-night kulitan

‚Ä¢Physical attraction matters, so I‚Äôm open to swapping pics early on. Gusto ko din ng spark, di lang ng vibes

‚Ä¢Open to LDR muna if needed, basta may plans and effort

‚Ä¢Not into hookups, so if you're here to collect girls like Pok√©mon, doon ka sa far away

‚Ä¢I don‚Äôt expect perfection, just consistency, clarity, and sincerity



Other things you should know:


‚Ä¢I‚Äôm clingy in the best way. I‚Äôll hype you up, remember how you like your coffee, and send you random memes at 2AM

‚Ä¢I‚Äôd rather get to know someone slowly and meaningfully than rush into something that fizzles

‚Ä¢I‚Äôm planning to pursue med school, so I‚Äôm all about long-term goals (yes, I dream big, and I‚Äôd love someone to dream with)

‚Ä¢If you‚Äôre emotionally unavailable, please don‚Äôt confuse me with mixed signals. Soft ako pero I don‚Äôt play dumb

‚Ä¢I love guys who make me laugh, make me feel safe, and aren‚Äôt afraid to show up

‚Ä¢Tinotopak din paminsan minsan (I'm just a girl) 



About you (hopefully):


‚Ä¢Emotionally intelligent, conversationalist, honest

‚Ä¢Romaaantiiic

‚Ä¢Bonus pogi points if you‚Äôre tall and can protect me hehe but attitude > abs

‚Ä¢Emotionally available and actually ready to date

‚Ä¢Between 24‚Äì29, knows what he wants, and isn't scared of commitment or effort

‚Ä¢Hindi passive-aggressive communicator. If may problem, let‚Äôs talk like adults, hindi pa-fade

‚Ä¢May values, may goals, and may respeto sa babae

‚Ä¢Not a walking red flag (Bare minimum lang. Don‚Äôt be a creep or a ghoster)



If you‚Äôve made it this far, maybe that‚Äôs a sign? Message me, but please, not just a ‚Äúhi‚Äù or ‚Äúhello.‚Äù Tell me something about you, your weirdest green flag, or what made you stop and read this. Effort is attractive, and who knows? This might just be the beginning of a slow burn, soft-launch-worthy kind of connection.

If that leads to me not ordering a bag of coffee, the problem gets even worse next weekend.

I wanted to write a program that finds all of the available options from my favorite roasters, extracts all of the key details like tasting notes, origin, varietals, roast level, and more, and uses that information to give me a recommendation.

That led to this: [cjohnsto-nz/CoffeeCopilot](https://github.com/cjohnsto-nz/CoffeeCopilot)  
It can keep track of your order history, to ensure that you're provided with a wide variety of brews, as well as to stay in budget.  
It will start by scraping your configured Roaster's Shopify sites for available products. At the moment, I have it set up to filter down from there to whole beans, 250g.

Once the products are scraped, it will collect all of the Shopify information, scrape the page for further detail, and take the first product image, and sent all of that to an LLM to extract the details.

Finally, it will consider your order history, your configured budget, all of the available options, and your configured prompt to give you a recommendation.

This is at a point where it's ready for a technical user who is happy to provide their own AI API credentials, edit some config files, maybe open up a sqlite db, etc, but it absolutely works.

My long term plan is to automate the ordering process, have it flick me notifications when it has recommendation, and even to have it monitor my usage somehow and order coffee such that the next bag will be perfectly rested by the time my current one runs out. IoT scales?????

At the moment, there is support for Shopify based roasters. At least in NZ, this covers... well... all of them.

I've enjoyed the experience of letting the robot pick my coffee. Even just for the data extraction, this could find some use archiving product information.  
Just wanted to share. I know people have strong feelings about AI, but as a data enthusiast, I find this to be a really cool use case for this technology.

My question is what benefit does the immersion dripper have over the regular ceramic v60?  I don't think I'll mess around with various methods or weighing etc.  I want simple quick and tasty.  Will the immersion give me anything better than the standard for the extra money?

So now I'm making an effort to really try and dial in my espresso properly.

I know that adjusting grind size, yield or time will affect the others but I'm not sure where to start. My instinct is to go with what Kingrinder suggest for espresso (40 clicks) to start with and work on a 1:2 ratio yield - so 18g in, 36 out - and see what time I end up with. From there I can try and adjust the grind size to improve the shot quality and try and get it to hit that ratio within 25-30s. But I keep reading conflicting advice. I've read some things that say I should set the timing first and then let the grind dictate the yield?

And on the note of timing - when do I start the timer? When I press the button on the machine there's a brief moment where it seems like nothing is happening (which I assume of course is the heater block warming up). Do I start timing from then, or when the machine starts to make a noise (which I assume is the pump starting). What about on subsequent shots where the block doesn't need to warm up again (or to the same extent at least) - or if I've run the machine without the portafilter in place to flush it through beforehand?

I had a chronic cough as a child as well and was frequently diagnosed with bronchitis and activity induced asthma, but I ""grew out of it"" for a long time and have never had real symptoms of asthma besides wheezing. The cough has become a severe barking cough that's present 75% of the time and is incredibly disruptive to my daily life. I'm unable to pin-point specific triggers, as it fluctuates so drastically throughout each day. As a general rule standing, eating, drinking (especially coffee and soda) cold, hot air, perfume/chemical smells and inhaled irritants, etc. all seem to be triggers .. laying down reduces symptoms and laying specifically on my left side causes a deeper, more raspy/wheezy cough that helps actually relieve the tickle in my throat that causes the cough. The normal barking cough is dry, but it seems like if I can get the proper airflow out of my lungs I expel a white phlegm, but post nasal drainage is always present, so it's difficult to determine the source of the mucus the cough expels. The constant cough is caused by an irritation I can feel in my throat and I have to force a rumble barking cough to vibrate the area enough to ""scratch the itch"". However, this irritation that causes the cough reflex is significantly REDUCED or even eliminated while sick or following an illness. (I actually get excited when I have the flu because it means I get a week or 2 without this constant cough) This has been unexplained by all of the specialists I've consulted. I have a hypothesis that because most of the illnesses bring a productive cough from deeper in my lungs, it's satisfying whatever is causing the sensation because its able to produce what I'm unable to expel otherwise. It seems to reach further down into my lungs while sick (with any illness from COVID to a sinus infection).. I've attempted treatments and multiple medications following medical assumptions that is related to asthma, GERD, or severe allergies, all of which brought no relief. Initially I had an MRI, EKG and tilt table - which diagnosed POTS and NCS. I also had a CT scan, barium swallow to rule out GERD, and x-rays, which showed nothing. Over the last year I've had several more x-rays, an upper GI scope with biopsy, a different barium swallow test to analyze swallowing abilities, allergy testing, a head MRI, a laryngoscopy, and bloodwork, all showing no causes. A standard PFT showed Isolated air trapping/pulmonary hyperinflation of uncertain clinical significance and a thyroid ultrasound showed a partially calcified nodule in the right upper lobe - both were ruled insignificant to symptoms by the doctors. I've spent my savings on testing and consultations with several specialists and they just keep ordering the same tests I've already done. I'm desperate for answers and I don't know what else to do. I need someone who's interested in solving a puzzle!

Some models even include temperature control, allowing you to precisely heat water to the optimal temperature for different types of tea.

1ju8gif,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1ju8gif/aitah_for_thinking_my_friend_is_the_asshole/,AITAH for thinking my friend is the asshole,"I (36F) have a married female friend (35F), husband is (37M). Married for 5 years, dated for 1+. We have been friends for more than a decade. She was a colleague of mine but we do keep contact every once in a while. Around September last year, she contacted me to attend our former colleague's wedding and after that once in a while we hang out to eat/for coffee. 

Around Oct/Nov I found out that her husband laid his hands on her (as a DV survivor myself, it triggered me a lot to hear that). The story was that he sneaked around her phone and he found deleted pictures of her and a guy, the guy was hugging her by the waist. She got angry and she slapped him and he did it to her back. They both went to told their respective parents (husband's family live in the same city whilst hers are in a different city). So I told her, if you need anything, you can always go to my place for safety.

I met with her a couple of days ago for coffee, she told me that her husband is still suspicious of her and following her every move. Apparently she met another guy friend (just the two of them at an open area coffee shop) and she informed husband where they were and her husband abruptly came and was being violent (ask nearby thugs to beat up the guy), so she got scared. I am still on her side by this point.

But during our conversation, she let it slipped that she did in fact cheated on her husband and are already talking about divorce. The guy who she cheated with went dark but her husband somehow is still keeping an eye on him (private eye or something). Her husband is telling her that he's gonna get even with this guy (I tend to think of the worst on this one) because the last time, they only have a restraining order (similar to this, I don't live in America)

So I was basically guiding her step by step on how to defuse his anger via text while I was talking to her. I told her to tell him that she is sorry for not letting him get even in the first place (a punch or two) and that she doesnt want to ruin their marriage even more if things got ugly (police involved and such). I asked her if she knew if he had been cheated on in the past and  I told her his pain and fear had festered and that men most likely resort to violence. She mentioned he said 'you made me do this' which is narc's textbook gaslighting (i am well aware of that) and it scared me for a while because thats what my ex used to do to me.

I advised her to go to marriage counselling and gave her list of doctors for recommendation. She doubted that her husband is willing to go at first but he is.

After a little more 'prying' for information, turns out she almost always never introduced/included him in her circle of friends. When asked why, she said that her husband is very quiet and awkward around people and she kinda feels ashamed of him (I advised her to start slowly introducing him to her circle of friends to make him feel at ease and be less suspicious, to build more trust and transparency)


For additional info: 

- They have been trying to have a kid but failed, want to try again but money got in the way (for now)


- She makes more money than him. Her friends suspected that he's using her for money but I don't because he's also working but making less and she doesnt pay for everything. She owns the house and has a car. Husband only has motorcycle. 


- Her husband is introverted, wife is very extroverted. I am currently introverted (mostly ambivert)


- In-laws relationships are no longer bue√±o. She thinks the in-laws are siding with the husband and won't help her talking him out of it. 


- Husband only knows my name but never met


Am I the asshole for siding with my friend at first because of my past experience but now I am kinda thinking she's the asshole in all this and start feeling sorry for the husband? By no means, I don't condone any kind of violence from/to both sexes. They already talked about divorce and she seems to be okay with it and she just wants to get it over with. Like she did wrong and now she wants to move past this. She said that she thinks divorce is gonna hit him harder than it will to her. 

What do you guys think?

PS: Sorry if my story seems to be all over the place, has typos, sentences that dont make sense. English is my second language. 

Edit: husband is reluctant to get a divorce. I have only guesses, no way to find out.
