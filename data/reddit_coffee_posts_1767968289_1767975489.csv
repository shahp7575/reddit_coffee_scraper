I know linen can get into the thousands for bedding, but the idea of $190 for pillow cases and a duvet cover still makes me hesitant - I want to use bedding to use it, and I want it to look nice, but I want to be able to drink coffee in bed without worrying about spilling on $300 sheets. So Quince feels like the perfect in-between for looking nice, being a step above my usual Marshalls blankets/bedding so I feel a little like a fancy adult, but not breaking the bank. So - thoughts?

# Perchance Character Chat

**Pros:**

* Image generation! Yes, your AI can actually *show* you things. Fancy, right?
* Super customizable. Like, scary customizable. Nobody knows how deep this rabbit hole goes.

**Cons:**

* It's complex. Your brain might need a coffee break.
* The UI? Let's just say... it could use some love. (Sorry, had to be honest.)

# Perchance Chat

**Pros:**

* Clean UI. Simple. Beautiful. Chef's kiss.
* Easy to use. Your grandma could figure it out.

**Cons:**

* No image generation. Just words. Lonely, lonely words.
* Limited customization. What you see is what you get.

# My Verdict

**Character Chat** = For people who love images and enjoy tinkering with settings.

**Chat** = For people who just want things to *work* without headaches.

# Quick Note for Newbies:

Some people think these two use different AIs. Nope! Same brain, different outfits. Both run on the same text AI (probably DeepSeek R1).

1q8cia1,https://www.reddit.com/r/Novelnews/comments/1q8cia1/my_husbands_mistress_just_posted_a_photo_of_their/,My husband’s mistress just posted a photo of their newborn son-and he has my husband’s eyes.,"My husband’s mistress just posted a photo of their newborn son-and he has my husband’s eyes.

The caption read: “Daddy’s perfect little heir.”

Three hours ago, I had a miscarriage in our bathroom. Alone.

Ethan didn’t answer my calls. Now I knew why.

I stared at the photo until my vision blurred-my stepsister Mia, glowing in a private hospital suite, holding a baby wrapped in blue cashmere.

Ethan’s hand rested on her shoulder. The Cartier watch I’d given him for our anniversary caught the light.

The same watch he claimed he’d lost two months ago.

My phone buzzed. A text from Ethan: \*”Working late. Don’t wait up.”\*

I laughed-a broken, hollow sound that echoed off the marble bathroom tiles. Blood was still staining my designer dress, and my husband was playing house with my stepsister.

Three years of marriage. Three years of trying to give him an heir. Three years of failed pregnancies, hormone injections, and silent dinners.

And Mia had given him a son in secret.

I should have seen it coming. The late nights. The sudden “business trips.” The way he’d started locking his phone.

But I’d trusted him. Trusted \*her\*.

Mia had been my shadow since our parents married when we were teenagers. Always sweet. Always helpful. Always watching me with those innocent doe eyes.

“Serena, can I borrow your notes?”

“Serena, can you introduce me to your friends?”

“Serena, your husband seems so stressed. I’ll bring him coffee while you’re at work.”

I’d thought she admired me. I was the fool.

My hands trembled as I scrolled through Mia’s private Instagram-the one she thought I didn’t know about. Months of photos. Ethan rubbing her pregnant belly. Ethan kissing her forehead. Ethan looking at her the way he’d never looked at me.

The baby was three months old. She’d hidden the entire pregnancy.

And Ethan had watched me suffer through another miscarriage without saying a word.

I pulled myself off the bathroom floor, legs shaking. The cramps were still brutal, but the pain in my chest was worse.

I was the CEO of a media empire. I’d built my father’s company into a billion-dollar brand. I negotiated with sharks and never flinched.

But this-this shattered me.

My phone buzzed again. This time, a message from an unknown number:

\*”Mrs. Sterling, I have information about your husband’s offshore accounts. And his plans to transfer your company shares to Mia Fleming. Meet me tomorrow if you want to save everything you’ve built.”\*

I read it three times.

Then I stopped crying.

Ethan wanted to play games? Fine.

But he’d forgotten one crucial detail-I wasn’t just his wife.

I was the one who’d signed his first investor check. The one who’d made him a billionaire.

And I was about to remind him exactly who he’d betrayed.",1,1767975341.0,Novelnews,1,1.0,False
1q8ch8z,https://www.reddit.com/r/frenchpress/comments/1q8ch8z/why_did_cold_coffee_become_trendy_expensive/,Why did cold coffee become trendy expensive specialty when it's literally just coffee that got cold?,"I don't understand the specialty cold coffee phenomenon. We're paying premium prices for coffee that's been intentionally not heated, often costing more than hot coffee despite requiring less energy and preparation. When did room temperature or chilled coffee become a premium product rather than just coffee you let sit too long? The argument is that cold brew methods extract different flavor profiles, that intentional cold preparation differs from hot coffee gone cold. Maybe that's true, but the massive price premium and cultural cachet seems disproportionate to whatever subtle taste differences exist. It feels like successful marketing convinced people that basic coffee served cold is sophisticated and worth extra money.



I've tried various cold coffee preparations from specialty cafes to grocery store bottles to making it myself, honestly finding minimal difference worth the price variations. Some suppliers on Alibaba sell cold brew equipment and concentrates, showing this is now an established commercial category. The proliferation suggests genuine demand, but I suspect that demand is largely created rather than organic. What food or drink trends have you found genuinely worthwhile versus just effective marketing? How do you evaluate whether premium prices reflect quality or just positioning? What made you adopt or reject popular food trends? Can you distinguish real preference from just following what's currently fashionable?",1,1767975282.0,frenchpress,0,1.0,False

How to Use Fa x Zen to Cure Tipping Fatigue.","Why You Always Tip But Still Feel Drained？**The Essence of Tipping Fatigue** Tipping fatigue isn't just about money; it is fundamentally a consumption of your social emotional value.

If you lack clear psychological boundaries and a strong sense of self-worth when you tip, you might think you are doing a ""good deed"" or providing emotional value to the server. But in reality, in the eyes of the person serving you, you may just look like a ""mindless executor""—someone hijacked by social inertia.

When someone says, *""It makes me uncomfortable not to tip,""* or *""I feel like tipping culture is too much pressure right now,""* what are they actually expressing?

We've all felt it—that moment of quiet resentment when the iPad spins around. You're no longer just paying for a coffee; you're being audited on your generosity in real-time. This is ""tipping fatigue,"" a modern social tax that leaves us feeling drained and manipulated.

What i call ""Tipping Fatigue"" isn't just about money. It’s a symptom of a deeper bug: you have unconsciously surrendered your **Consumer Sovereignty** to a vague, manipulative system of social emotional blackmail.

This post isn't about being cheap. It's about an alchemical transformation using **Fa (The Cold Compiler of Reality)** and **Zen (The Silent Kernel of Awareness)**. It’s about moving from a ""Passive Payer"" to a ""Sovereign Operator.""

# Let's begin！

# I. Zen (The Silent Kernel of Awareness): Break the ""Validation Loop,"" See the ""True Self""

In the Zen perspective, the root of your fatigue is an attachment to two illusions: ""The Giver"" and ""The Judged.""

* **Fatigue is the Result of ""Clinging""**  You feel tired because you are paying out of **weakness**, not strength. If you tip to buy ""safety"" (so they don't spit in your food) or to buy a ""nice guy"" mask (so they don't think you're broke), you are leaking energy.
   * *Zen Insight:* Every dollar spent out of fear or guilt is a drain on your mental RAM. No wonder you are exhausted.
* **Clear Boundaries are the Bedrock of ""Immovability""** Zen is about ""Observing the Self."" When that iPad screen spins around, observe your immediate reaction. Are you tipping out of gratitude (Abundance)? Or out of fear of judgment (Scarcity)?
   * *The Practice:* That split-second awareness—seeing your own fear—is the first step to breaking the emotional hijacking.
* **True Giving Comes from ""Self-Sufficiency""** Giving from a place of low energy (Vitality) is not generosity; it is a hidden form of begging. You are begging for approval.
   * *The Truth:* Only when your internal battery is full (Self-Sufficient) can you truly give. A tip from a high-energy person is a gift (Snow). A tip from a low-energy person is a tax (Burden). Zen is the practice of recharging your own battery first.

# II. Fa (The Cold Compiler of Reality): Legislate Your Own ""Payment Protocol""

In the reality of **Fa**, the tipping scenario is a micro-negotiation of power. Your fatigue comes from playing by a set of broken, undefined rules.

* **Social Inertia is a ""Corrupt Law"" (Bad Fa)** The current tipping culture is what Fa philosophy calls a ""Bad Law."" It is unwritten, infinitely expanding, and enforced solely by **Guilt Trips**. It has no clear terms, no fair exchange, and relies on vague pressure.
   * *The Verdict:* This system is a bug. It is designed to extract resources from you by exploiting your lack of boundaries.
* **Self-Legislation is the Key to Breaking Out** A Sovereign Individual (a ""Monarch"" of their own mind) must write their own **Constitution**. You need to install a clear internal protocol:
   * **The Spirit of the Law:** ""My tip is a reward for exceptional vitality and service, not a ransom payment for standard procedures.""
   * **The Standard:** ""I hold the judging power, not the iPad screen, and not the server's eyes.""
   * **The Execution:** ""If the service is merely standard, and I choose to tip 0% or 10%, I will execute this command as calmly as a judge signing a document.""
* **""Disengagement"" is the Ultimate Deterrence** When you have a strong internal Law, you gain ""Positional Power"" (**The Leverage**). When the system tries to pressure you, the most powerful Fa tactic is **Disengagement**.
   * *The Move:* Don't explain. Don't apologize. Don't debate internally. Simply execute your decision and close the interaction. Your calm refusal to engage with the guilt trip is the strongest rejection of the ""Corrupt Law.""

# III. Fa x Zen Fusion: The King Sits on the Throne

The highest level is when your internal **Zen (The Silent Kernel of Awareness)** and your external **Fa (The Cold Compiler of Reality)** merge. You become the King of your own domain in every transaction.

* **Zen Mode: ""Watching the Movie""** When the payment moment arrives, switch to **Observer Mode**.
   * Watch the numbers on the screen.
   * Watch the emotions rising in your body (Is it guilt? Anger? Calm?).
   * Watch the social script trying to play out.
   * By simply ""watching,"" you move from being an Actor on stage to the Audience. You regain the freedom to choose.
* **Fa Mode: ""Directing the Play""** Based on your observation, calmly execute your **Personal Tipping Constitution**:
   * **Pre-Game:** Know your baseline before you walk in.
   * **Mid-Game:** Judge the service against your law. Make the decision instantly. No second-guessing.
   * **Post-Game:** No residue. Whether you tipped 0% or 50%, do not defend yourself internally or externally. Your decision is final.

**The Result:**

Tipping is no longer a messy emotional tangle. It is a clear, calm declaration of your sovereignty.

* **With Zen:** You see that ""Giving and Receiving"" are empty of inherent meaning, so you are not kidnapped by values.
* **With Fa:** You establish clear rules and execute them ruthlessly, breaking the ""Bad Law"" of social pressure.

When you reclaim the throne of your **Inner Sovereignty** , the waves of social guilt crash against the rocks and dissipate. You pay what you want, when you want, and you leave with your energy intact.

There’s a very specific kind of emotional journey you go through when you realize someone has sent you a message that is—without exaggeration—longer than most ancient epics. You open your phone expecting a normal human interaction, something manageable, something that respects the basic laws of attention span. Instead, you’re greeted by a digital monologue so massive it should have its own ISBN number. You know the feeling.

Your thumb hovers over the screen like, Do I really want to do this to myself right now? Because once you start scrolling, you’re committed. You’re entering a labyrinth built entirely out of unnecessary adjectives and side stories that have absolutely nothing to do with the original topic. And the wildest part?

These people don’t even warn you. No “long message incoming,” no “sorry this is a lot,” nothing. They just drop a text bomb and walk away like they didn’t just hand you a reading assignment. You’re left staring at your screen like a student who forgot there was homework due.

Some folks treat every message like it’s their memoir. They can’t just say, “Yeah, I’ll be there.” No, no. They have to explain where they were when they saw your message, what they were thinking about at the time, how their morning coffee tasted, and why that reminded them of a story from 2014 that has absolutely zero relevance to the plan you’re trying to make.And the tangents—oh, the tangents.

You’ll be halfway through paragraph four when suddenly they’re talking about their neighbor’s cat or the time they almost joined a band. You start wondering if you accidentally opened a different conversation. You scroll back up just to confirm that yes, this is still the same message, and no, you’re not hallucinating.

Meanwhile, the one piece of information you actually needed—the answer to your question—is buried somewhere deep in the text like a lost treasure. You practically need a map and a flashlight to find it. You’re decoding their message like it’s an ancient script. You’re mentally preparing to write a thesis on what they might have meant.

And let’s be honest:

By the time you reach the end, you’re exhausted. You’ve lived a whole life. You’ve grown as a person. You’ve gone through the five stages of grief. You’re not even sure you want the answer anymore. You just want a nap.

But here’s the thing:

These people aren’t trying to be annoying. They genuinely think they’re being helpful. They think more words = more clarity, when in reality more words = more confusion, more scrolling, more emotional damage. They don’t realize that sometimes the most respectful thing you can do is keep it short. Say the thing. Then stop.But no.

Some people will type until their battery dies. They will type until their phone overheats. They will type until the sun sets and rises again. They will type like they’re trying to win an award for “Most Words Used to Answer a Yes-or-No Question.”

And honestly?

I admire the stamina.

But also… please. I beg you. For the sake of everyone’s sanity. Trim. It. Down.

I rang em and cancelled ..so now I've 30 days to decide what to go with next.

I'm an NBI kiddie out the country.. so its the 3 billion euro fiber to the house .. 

When the storm hasn't knocked everything out, that is .. for 19 days. Working from home.. yee.. the fun we had... 

So, despite the queasy feeling it gives me, I'm even lookin at puttin money in Elons sweaty pockets.

But before I do that I'm lookin at the conventional.. Sky, Vodafone, even Virgin despite those horrific ads... 

Ahndd.. I have questions...

**Speed**: seeing as the Eir chappies seemed to thing getting 500mbps was *good enough for yeh on yer 1Gb package and yeh should be glad to get it lad*.. we've survived with sub 500mbps for the two years..  So I'm thinking I'd go for a 500mbps package rather than a 1gig one.. BUT if I'm going with one of these gangs I might as well add a bit of TV.... I presume the TV will eat into the bandwidth eh? So would U go for 1Gb or not?

**Who**: we all know now that Eir are never ever going to get repeat business from anyone ever again.. but what about these others? Voda, Sky, Virgin.. anyone got experience of them outside of town.. not on Siro now.. on the NBI fiber like? AND whats the support like? Is it ring em and go make the dinner while on hold? Or is it straight to a call center on the other side of the globe?

**Work**: Id be interested to hear from anyone working from home and dealing with starlink or the fiber gang and wants to vent their frustration over dropped Teams calls etc...

On paper, we’re doing fine. Decent salaries, nice enough house, baby, nothing dramatically wrong. But somehow it feels like there’s constant financial pressure, zero spare cash, and a low-level stress that never really goes away.

We’re not struggling in a dramatic way… it’s more like death by a thousand cuts. Bills, childcare, mortgage, life admin. And I keep thinking: how did this become the default? When did “doing well” start feeling so tight?

Lately I’ve been wondering whether we’ve just followed the script because that’s what you do. Bigger house, higher costs, more pressure. And now I’m seriously considering whether downsizing and scaling back would actually make life better. Smaller place, lower outgoings, a bit of disposable income, and maybe some actual enjoyment instead of just managing everything.

Has anyone actually done this? Sold the house, downsized, deliberately earned less, simplified life?

1q8ca6x,https://www.reddit.com/r/backtoindia/comments/1q8ca6x/i_really_sat_and_thought_about_things_in_my_life/,I really sat and thought about things in my life as US Return. About being laid off from my job in USA and moving back to India. Why it is an awesome thing which happened to me. And it made me a stronger believer of Hinduism.,"Based on my 35 years of experience living in India, USA for a while, and back to India last year, here are my observations:

1. Life is how we choose to live it. What we give to others, we get back, in some way or another. Karma is real, in every way.
2. Life rewards those who show grit, determination, dedication and focus to a cause they truly believe in. If you are working on something with all of your focus and concentration for a significant amount of time, you will see results. Plain and simple.
3. It is foolish to compare life in India with life in America. America got independence in 1781, 167 years before India. They had 167 more years to develop their country. We, on the other hand, got independence after a long struggle 78 years ago. The cultures, values, beliefs, people, are completely different in India and America. We as Indians should promote our native cultures. For example, Indian Hinduism, Islam, and Christianity is practiced slightly differently in India with a flavor of local culture, than the same religions in America. I respect all religions.
4. Many Indians go to USA with dreams of getting a >100K USD job and respect from society, family friends etc. I've been there, done that for 10 years. I worked hard, earned good money, got 2 MS degrees in Tech. I am back home now. I could not be happier. USA is a very capitalist and materialistic life. Money is everything. The healthcare is unbelievably expensive in USA. It takes time to meet providers. The ambulance bills you in thousands of dollars for emergency services. Hospital bills are through the roof. You will make money, but you will feel empty inside.
5. Most importantly, people in USA chase dollars and green card and stay so far from their old parents. I know, because I was like that too. I was chasing the American dream, not knowing that it does not exist for Indians anymore. If you want to work in USA, and you are looking at H-1B visa, it just got so much tougher! I am grateful to Krishna that I got laid off with 250+ employees from my USA job and came back to India. I got a great job with superb CTC in product based company in Bangalore and best part is I am staying close to my parents. I see them so soon! The love from family simply cannot be replaced.
6. In Hindu scriptures, we can read about Kali Yuga. That is the current yuga we are in. I am seeing this in action now. People will go to temple and pray for best things. Later those same people will watch pornographic videos. Then they will rape women. Everywhere on instagram I see people posting vulgar pictures to gain attention. I mean, selling bodies for a few views, likes and internet popularity. All kind of diseases spread in Kali Yuga. I was diagnosed with schizoaffective disorder (schizophrenia + depression symptoms). I went through hell for several years. Then I came to India last year. Visited Ayodhya Ram Temple, Grushneshwar, Kashi Vishwanath jyotirling, Meenakshi Amman Temple. Although my faith was weak. I showed up. Prayed. Today, I am free of schizoaffective disorder. Doctors say it is in remission.
7. I am seeing the people of India every day. The office boy who gives me fresh filter coffee every morning and says - ""Please sir, coffee!"" The janitors who clean bathrooms. The sweepers who clean the streets. The gardeners. The cooks and maid who come home and help feed us and clean up after ourselves. We underpay them. They don't owe us a damn thing. But they still show up. They do their part.

So what's my point with this post? It is that: find your Ikigai - something you love doing, something you can be paid for, and more importantly, something the world needs.

As Indians, we can limit our time from depressing news and social media. These will get you down. News anchors will talk negative things for TRPs and attention. As a Data Scientist, my job is to study the data. When I look at day to day life, its great! People are just people. If you are good to them, if you really take time off instagram reels and give them your undivided attention, trying to help them in your own way, you will earn respect and friendship.

If we can bring about change by respecting every Indian based on their character and strength of moral values, rather than their faith, sexual orientation, health, body type, and religion, then we will get closer to a Ram Rajya. That is the true definition of Ram Rajya. I think Lord Ram loves the temple but he would love it more if we can be unbiased and just love each other without judgement or expectation.

1q8c5w4,https://www.reddit.com/r/SocialBlueprint/comments/1q8c5w4/how_to_never_be_boring_in_conversation/,How to Never Be BORING in Conversation: Science-Backed Psychology That Actually Works,"Let me hit you with something real. You're at a party, networking event, or just grabbing coffee with someone new. The conversation starts fine, but then... nothing. Dead air. Awkward silences. You can see their eyes glazing over like they're mentally planning their grocery list. Sound familiar?

I dove deep into this because honestly, I used to be that person who killed conversations without even knowing it. Studied communication research, binged psychology podcasts, read books by actual conversation experts, and here's what I found: Being boring isn't about lacking interesting stories. It's about missing the invisible rules of human connection that no one teaches you.

The wild part? Most of us are accidentally programmed to be boring. Social media trained us to broadcast instead of connect. School taught us to recite facts instead of spark curiosity. And our brains are literally wired to play it safe in social situations. But once you understand the game, you can flip the script.

 Step 1: Stop Being a Conversation Vampire

Here's the uncomfortable truth. Most ""boring"" people aren't boring because they're dull. They're boring because they suck the energy out of conversations. They either talk endlessly about themselves or turn every topic back to their own experiences.

You know the type. Someone mentions they went hiking, and this person immediately jumps in with ""Oh I went hiking too, let me tell you about MY hike for the next 10 minutes."" That's conversation vampirism, and it's killing your interactions.

The fix: Use the spotlight technique. When someone shares something, shine the spotlight on THEM, not yourself. Ask follow up questions that go deeper. They mention hiking? Don't share your hiking story. Instead: ""What made you pick that trail?"" or ""Did anything unexpected happen?""

Dr. Charles Duhigg covers this brilliantly in his book Supercommunicators. He's a Pulitzer Prize winning journalist who spent years researching what separates magnetic communicators from boring ones. The book breaks down actual conversations and shows you exactly where people go wrong. One insight that blew my mind: great conversationalists match the type of conversation the other person wants. Sometimes people want practical advice, sometimes emotional connection, sometimes just to vent. Reading the room is everything.

 Step 2: Develop Conversational Range (Get Weird With It)

Boring people have one mode. They talk about work, weather, traffic, Netflix shows everyone's seen. Safe topics, zero depth. You need range.

Build a mental library of conversation seeds across different territories. Read weird articles. Listen to podcasts outside your bubble. Learn random facts that make people go ""wait, what?""

But here's the key: it's not about showing off knowledge. It's about having ammunition to take conversations somewhere unexpected. Someone mentions they're tired? Instead of ""yeah me too,"" you could say ""I read this thing about how some cultures have different relationships with sleep, like in Spain they still do siestas but it's dying out because of corporate culture.""

Boom. Now you've opened three potential conversation doors: sleep science, cultural differences, or how modern work is changing traditions. Let THEM pick which door to walk through.

The Hidden Brain podcast is insane for this. Hosted by Shankar Vedantam, it explores the unconscious patterns that drive human behavior. Each episode gives you fresh perspectives on everyday stuff, psychology, decision making, social dynamics. It's basically cheat codes for understanding people better. The episode on ""Why Conversations Go Wrong"" should be required listening.

BeFreed is an AI-powered learning app that pulls from books, research papers, expert interviews, and real-world case studies to create personalized audio content based on whatever skill you're trying to build. 

Want to get better at reading social cues or understanding communication patterns? Just tell it your goal, and it generates a custom podcast and adaptive learning plan tailored specifically to you. You control the depth too, quick 10-minute summaries when you're busy or 40-minute deep dives with concrete examples when you want to go all in. 

The app has this virtual coach called Freedia that you can chat with anytime, pause mid-episode to ask questions, or get book recommendations based on your struggles. Since it's built by AI experts from Google, the content quality is solid and fact-checked. Plus you can pick different voice styles, from sarcastic to that smooth, sexy Samantha-from-Her vibe, whatever keeps you engaged during your commute or gym session.

 Step 3: Master the Art of Generous Listening

This sounds soft but it's actually hardcore. Most people don't listen, they just wait for their turn to talk. Their brain is busy preparing their next comment instead of actually absorbing what the other person said.

Generous listening means you're genuinely curious. You're trying to understand their world, not just extract information. You notice the emotion behind their words. You pick up on what they're NOT saying.

Try this: When someone's talking, resist the urge to formulate your response. Just... listen. Then wait two full seconds after they finish before you speak. This does two things: you actually process what they said, and that pause makes them feel heard. People rarely feel truly heard in conversations.

The app Ash is weirdly good for practicing this. It's an AI relationship and communication coach that helps you work through real conversations you're having. You can practice responses, get feedback on your communication style, and learn to catch yourself when you're slipping into bad habits. Sounds gimmicky but it's like having a conversation sensei in your pocket.

 Step 4: Embrace Strategic Vulnerability

Here's where it gets spicy. Safe conversations are boring because nobody's really showing up. Everyone's wearing a mask, playing it cool, keeping it surface level.

Strategic vulnerability means sharing something real, but not trauma dumping. It's the difference between ""Yeah work's fine"" and ""Honestly, I've been feeling stuck lately, trying to figure out if I'm on the right path.""

That second one? That's a conversation that could actually go somewhere interesting. It signals you're a real human, not a corporate robot. And it gives the other person permission to drop their mask too.

But here's the trick: Lead with curiosity about them first, THEN share your vulnerability. Don't open with your problems. That's still conversation vampirism, just the sad version.

Never Split the Difference by Chris Voss is technically a negotiation book (he's a former FBI hostage negotiator), but it's secretly the best book on conversations you'll ever read. Voss teaches tactical empathy, how to make people feel understood so deeply that they open up. One technique: labeling emotions. ""It sounds like you're frustrated about that"" or ""Seems like that was exciting for you."" Simple but crazy effective at deepening conversations.

 Step 5: Learn to Story-Tell Like You Give a Damn

When you DO share your own experiences, don't just recite facts. Paint a picture. Include sensory details. Build tension. Have a point.

Bad storytelling: ""I went to Japan last year. It was cool. The food was good.""

Better storytelling: ""So I'm in Tokyo, jet lagged as hell, wandering around at 3am because I can't sleep. I turn this corner and there's a tiny ramen shop, like 6 seats total, run by this 80 year old man. No English menu, no pictures. I just pointed at what the guy next to me was eating. Best meal of my life. Turns out the old man had been making that same ramen for 50 years. That's when I realized...""

See the difference? The second one takes you there. It has stakes, imagery, a revelation. Even if it's a small story, tell it like it matters.

 Step 6: Kill Your Filler Words and Dead Energy

Nothing murders conversational energy faster than ""um,"" ""like,"" ""you know,"" ""basically"" every three seconds. It makes you sound uncertain and uninteresting.

Record yourself talking for 5 minutes. Just ramble about your day into your phone. Then listen back. You'll be horrified at how many filler words you use. Awareness is the first step to killing them.

Replace fillers with pauses. Silence isn't your enemy. A confident pause is way more engaging than a string of ""ums."" It makes people lean in.

Also, watch your energy. If you're monotone, people will tune out no matter how interesting your words are. Vary your pace, your volume, your tone. Emphasis matters. You're not reading a grocery list, you're creating an experience.

 Step 7: Ask Questions That Actually Slap

Boring questions get boring answers. ""What do you do?"" ""Where are you from?"" These are conversation killers disguised as conversation starters.

Instead, ask questions that make people think:
- ""What's something you believed five years ago that you don't believe anymore?""
- ""If you could only keep one hobby for the rest of your life, which one and why?""
- ""What's a problem you're trying to solve right now?""

These questions bypass small talk and go straight to interesting territory. They force the other person to actually engage their brain instead of running on autopilot.

Build a rotation of 10-15 killer questions and deploy them strategically. Don't machine gun them, just have them ready when small talk is dying.

 Step 8: Know When to Shut Up and Exit Gracefully

Here's an underrated skill: knowing when a conversation has run its course. Some people try to squeeze every last drop out of an interaction and it gets painful.

If the energy's dropping, don't force it. You can gracefully exit with: ""This was great, I'm gonna grab another drink but let's continue this later"" or ""I should let you get back to your people, but seriously, what you said about [topic] really got me thinking.""

Leave them wanting more instead of exhausting the interaction. Mystery and brevity can actually make you MORE interesting than oversharing.

The ultimate cheat code? Genuinely care about people. Not in a fake, manipulative way. Actually be curious about humans. When you're authentically interested in someone's world, conversations stop being performances and start being connections. That's when boring becomes impossible.

There’s a girl in my class at uni that I started to crush on a lot lately. But it’s kinda weird. We’re in our second year and we never really talked in our first year (and I had a gf back then on top of that). However my gf broke up with me at the end of my first year at uni and I spent months getting over her since it was too sudden. Lately I started to look around me, I started talking to girls more and I noticed some hints from her side (like trying to initiate convos with me or her blushing a bit when she asked me about smth). Just now we have our exam period and I thought it would be great idea to ask her if she would like to study together (and naturally I wanted to follow that up by asking her out on a coffee). We texted a bit and she seemed like she really wants to come with me (she even sent me the “🫶🏽” emoji, which is a good sign, nah?) but then the day that we were supposed to meet, she just sent me a voice message that she will travel home for the weekend and she feels sorry but won’t be able to come with me. That would be completely fine by me, I played it cool, texted her it’s all right and wished her safe travels, however… Just next day she posted an ig story where she’s with her friend in the city… So she basically lied to me. Am I cooked here? I didn’t text her yet (neither she texted me) and I have no idea if this is worth it. We have a pile of exams coming up so we’ll definitely meet again and I have the possibility to ask her out directly, but I would like some advice from you guys, what should I do? What would you do if you were me?😅",2,1767974489.0,Crushes,1,1.0,False

1q8c3ev,https://www.reddit.com/r/PrideandPrejudice/comments/1q8c3ev/she_really_doesnt_like_him/,She really doesn't like him.,"When you've seen the screen adaptations, read the book several times, seen the merchandise with the romantic quotes, it can be difficult to approach this novel with a clean mental slate, forgetting the outcome, and taking it one chapter at a time. But as we re-read the novel, it's important to remember that Lizzie *really, truly disliked Darcy*, and I mean, a lot. She's not flirting when she rags on him; she's having fun at his expense and doesn't care if she offends him. She's being about as rude as she can push it in polite company. Darcy is just so arrogant that he's interpreting her behavior as her ""lively,"" coquettish personality, which is why he's gobsmacked when she turns down his first proposal, and ""with so little attempt at civility."" He's probably never had a woman openly poke fun at him, so he can't imagine she means seriously to insult him.

We learn that Lizzie's opinion of Darcy changes as a result not only of learning the true circumstances of his dealings with Wickham, not only in her becoming more honest with herself about her family's crude behavior, but also in considering Darcy's role in his community, how he is essentially the equivalent of a CEO of a sizeable corporation, with his employees and tenants being dependent upon his sound judgment and good management of his estate and fortune (although we know he had a steward as well). She began to see him in a more mature light, and I would say she came less to fall in romantic love with him than to *respect* him, and in light of her previous teasing and ridiculing of him, she felt that she had acted foolishly and immaturely, based mostly on his having offended her at their first meeting. She had *decided* to dislike him based on a little justification and a lot of misinformation.

I don't think Lizzie ever felt that Darcy was swoon-worthy, which would have been a rather adolescent conception of the man. She came to the relationship with a more mature image of Darcy and a deeper appreciation of his character.

This is why I think it's kind of amusing that an entire industry has grown up around putting swoony, sweep-you-off-your-feet quotes from P&P on tea towels and coffee mugs (although I will admit that I like that stuff, too, haha), and that Darcy is seen today as a dashing, romantic figure.",15,1767974449.0,PrideandPrejudice,5,1.0,False

**Thanks for the feedback!**

The day before departure he sits with Tommy and Rico by a fire behind the trailer park. Tommy is already back from his first tour – his leg hurts from standing all day, eyes empty. “It's good pay,” he says, but his voice is tired. Rico pours him beer. Johnny looks into the flames and thinks about the posters. Tomorrow he leaves. Tomorrow his way out begins. 

The year 2001 passes quickly. Johnny is now at a base in North Carolina, assigned to infantry after training. Life in the army is routine – exercises, shooting, equipment maintenance. Pay comes regularly, he sends money to his mother, who coughs more and more. In the barracks TV runs news about Clinton, then Bush, about the economy rising. Guys in the platoon talk about girls, cars, what they'll do when they return home. 

One morning in September everything changes. The sergeant runs into the barracks, shouting: “Get up, damn it, America is under attack!” Everyone rushes to the TV. Planes crashing into towers, smoke, chaos. Johnny stands there, hand over mouth, thinking about the posters – Be a Hero. The President talks about war on terror. Rumors spread through the base: we'll be deployed. 

But for Johnny it's not immediate. First just more exercises, more preparations. Then in 2002 comes the order – his unit gets leave before deployment to Afghanistan. Johnny takes a bus back to Ashford for a week. 

The trailer looks smaller than he remembers. His mother opens the door, face gaunt, eyes red from coughing. She hugs him so tightly he feels her bones through the thin sweater. “My boy,” she whispers and cries into his uniform. Inside smells of old food and medicine. They sit at the table, mother cooks his favorite – beans with bread, nothing more she has. They talk about small things: how Rico is now in prison for drugs, how Tommy works in a shop and drinks even more. Johnny talks about training, about buddies, but says nothing about where he's going. Mother knows anyway. “Be careful,” she says over and over. “Write to me.” 

The last evening they sit outside on the steps. Mother gives him a package – old photo from his childhood, where he's thirteen and smiling by that cake, a letter where she writes how proud she is of him, and twenty dollars she saved. “For cigarettes,” she says and tries to smile. Johnny hugs her long, feels her body shaking with cough. “I love you, Mom,” he says for the first time in years. She cries quietly into his shoulder. 

Morning he gets up early. Bus to the base leaves at seven. Mother stands at the door in a robe, arms crossed, eyes full of tears. Johnny has a backpack on his back, uniform clean. He kisses her forehead, she smells of soap and illness. “I'll return,” he says. She nods, but doesn't believe it. She waves from the door until he disappears around the corner. 

At the bus station in Ashford waits an old Greyhound, engine humming. Johnny boards, sits by the window. The town passes – rusted factories, empty streets, posters on poles now with new inscriptions: “Support Our Troops.” He looks at the trailer park shrinking in the distance, at his mother no longer visible. He feels a lump in his throat, but doesn't cry. He thinks about the promises – pay, respect, way out. 

The bus heads onto the highway. Ashford disappears behind the horizon. Johnny closes his eyes and thinks about what awaits him. He doesn't know yet that he'll never return the same as he left. 

The bus stops in front of the main gate at Fort Bragg early morning, when it's still dark. Johnny gets off with backpack on shoulders, legs stiff from the long ride. Air in North Carolina is humid, cold, smells of pines and rain that came at night. The gate is lit by spotlights – high fence with barbed wire on top, guards in a booth with rifles, sign “Fort Bragg – Home of the Airborne.” Sergeant at the entrance checks papers, waves them through. Johnny walks on asphalt, boots crunching on gravel, Humvees and soldiers running pass by. 

His unit's barracks are full – guys from leave returning one by one, hugs, back slaps, jokes about home. “Harlan, you lost weight or what?” laughs Ramirez from the platoon, a guy from Texas with tattoos on arms. Johnny smiles, but tiredly. He falls on his bunk, unpacks – places mother's photo on the shelf by the bed. It smells of sweat, boots, and coffee from the machine. 

First day back is full of chaos. Assembly in front of the building, sergeant shouting names, checking presence. Then briefing in a large room – dark walls, projector humming, maps of Afghanistan on screen: Hindu Kush mountains, red arrows pointing to Tora Bora. Colonel talks about the mission: “We'll support special units, patrols in mountains, building democracy.” Guys listen, some take notes, Johnny looks at the maps and thinks about his mother's cough. 

Preparations are intense. Every day exercises: running with full gear in sand, shooting at the range, IED simulations. Sergeants shout: “Watch the road, look for wires!” Johnny packs his backpack over and over – ammo, first aid, water, MRE food in bags. Nights are short, full of dreams about Ashford. 

Then comes departure day. Morning dark, assembly by the hangar at Pope Air Force Base next door. Rows of soldiers in desert uniforms, backpacks on backs, rifles over shoulders. No families, just orders and engine hum. They board C-17 Globemaster – huge gray plane, ramp down, inside rows of seats from red netting, no windows. Johnny sits next to Ramirez, buckles up, engine starts with roar that vibrates in chest. Plane taxis, lifts, and ground disappears. ",0,1767974396.0,Metallica,0,0.5,False

1q8bzpy,https://www.reddit.com/r/CubitalTunnel/comments/1q8bzpy/post_op_exercises/,Post Op Exercises,"Hey all,

Two weeks ago I had open carpal tunnel and cubital tunnel release surgery on my dominant side. My ulnar nerve stayed put so transposition wasn’t needed. I got my stitches, bandages and splint off yesterday.

Before surgery, I spoke to one of the ortho nurses and was told I should expect to be out of work for 6-8 weeks. You can imagine my surprise when the doctor cleared me with no restrictions to go back to work this following Monday, barely two weeks post op. Thing is, I don’t have a desk job. I work for a tree care company, with this time of year I do a lot of brush dragging, feeding the chipper, helping with rigging, raking and that sort of thing. Essentially using my hands and arms rather intensively. The surgeon knows this. Thankfully, the receptionist recognized this could be a problem for me and gave me an extra week to recover.

While I had the splint and bandages on, I couldn’t do much with that arm. My elbow was restricted and my hand was so bandaged that I couldn’t hold anything. I moved my fingers as much as I could several times a day, making a fist, extending them out and spreading them apart. Now that it’s off, both incisions are tender, my hand and wrist are stiff as is my elbow - both have significantly more limited range of motion. It’s too painful right now to pour myself a cup of coffee from a standard carafe that’s half full. I’m trying to stay positive but it would be an understatement if I said I wasn’t stressed about returning to a high intensity job when I can’t even pour a cup of coffee.

Obviously, I want to try to reduce my pain and get as much mobility/strength back within the next week as possible. I am trying to use my hand arm as much as possible for normal tasks, so long as it’s not more than mildly painful. Google only turned up a few potentially reliable sources for me but they have a bunch of terms and abbreviations in them that I don’t understand. I would prefer a you tube video, but there was so much junk to wade through. I’m going to keep looking but thought I would reach out here too. 

Sorry for the book, I just wanted to as clearly outline my situation as I could. I appreciate any insight that can be offered!

I’m a red team engineer with custom firmware on my router and a Faraday cage around my smart toaster.

I showed up 10 minutes early, hoodie on, laptop in hand, booted into a hardened gentoo distro I compiled myself. She opened the door holding a MacBook Air. Chrome had 43 tabs open. I almost left right then.

I asked for her network topology diagram. She laughed. “It’s just the router from the ISP.”

Alright, I thought. Let her have it.

I popped open her router admin panel. Default password: \*admin123\*. The SSID was ""PrettyFlyForAWiFi"". I ran a \`nmap\`scan. 12 exposed ports, 3 outdated IoT devices, and a printer running telnet. No firewall. No VLANs. Just raw digital nudity.

I asked if she ever noticed weird lag. She said “yeah sometimes Netflix buffers.” I said that was probably because her TV was being used in a botnet out of Kazakhstan. She blinked twice. ""Oh no, is that bad?""

I offered to segment the network and install pfSense. She said she “just wanted Spotify to stop cutting out.”

I airgapped her Sonos out of pity.

After 20 minutes of work, I asked for her phone to remove TikTok and clean the app permissions. She said “but I need it for filters.”

I looked into the distance. Deep sigh. I looked out the window and whispered, \*""The panopticon isn’t metaphorical.""\*

She asked if I was always this intense.

I said no, only when the NSA is listening. Which is always.

She offered coffee. I declined, caffeine raises your attack surface.

When I left, she said, “Thanks, you’re like, really good with computers.”

I walked away slow. Her router was still on UPnP. So was my heart.

You can't patch people. Believe me, I tried.

About being laid off from my job in USA and moving back to India. Why it is an awesome thing which happened to me. And it made me a stronger believer of Hinduism.,"Based on my 35 years of experience living in India, USA for a while, and back to India last year, here are my observations:

1. Life is how we choose to live it. What we give to others, we get back, in some way or another. Karma is real, in every way.
2. Life rewards those who show grit, determination, dedication and focus to a cause they truly believe in. If you are working on something with all of your focus and concentration for a significant amount of time, you will see results. Plain and simple.
3. It is foolish to compare life in India with life in America. America got independence in 1781, 167 years before India. They had 167 more years to develop their country. We, on the other hand, got independence after a long struggle 78 years ago. The cultures, values, beliefs, people, are completely different in India and America. We as Indians should promote our native cultures. For example, Indian Hinduism, Islam, and Christianity is practiced slightly differently in India with a flavor of local culture, than the same religions in America. I respect all religions.
4. Many Indians go to USA with dreams of getting a >100K USD job and respect from society, family friends etc. I've been there, done that for 10 years. I worked hard, earned good money, got 2 MS degrees in Tech. I am back home now. I could not be happier. USA is a very capitalist and materialistic life. Money is everything. The healthcare is unbelievably expensive in USA. It takes time to meet providers. The ambulance bills you in thousands of dollars for emergency services. Hospital bills are through the roof. You will make money, but you will feel empty inside.
5. Most importantly, people in USA chase dollars and green card and stay so far from their old parents. I know, because I was like that too. I was chasing the American dream, not knowing that it does not exist for Indians anymore. If you want to work in USA, and you are looking at H-1B visa, it just got so much tougher! I am grateful to Krishna that I got laid off with 250+ employees from my USA job and came back to India. I got a great job with superb CTC in product based company in Bangalore and best part is I am staying close to my parents. I see them so soon! The love from family simply cannot be replaced.
6. In Hindu scriptures, we can read about Kali Yuga. That is the current yuga we are in. I am seeing this in action now. People will go to temple and pray for best things. Later those same people will watch pornographic videos. Then they will rape women. Everywhere on instagram I see people posting vulgar pictures to gain attention. I mean, selling bodies for a few views, likes and internet popularity. All kind of diseases spread in Kali Yuga. I was diagnosed with schizoaffective disorder (schizophrenia + depression symptoms). I went through hell for several years. Then I came to India last year. Visited Ayodhya Ram Temple, Grushneshwar, Kashi Vishwanath jyotirling, Meenakshi Amman Temple. Although my faith was weak. I showed up. Prayed. Today, I am free of schizoaffective disorder. Doctors say it is in remission. 
7. I am seeing the people of India every day. The office boy who gives me fresh filter coffee every morning and says - ""Please sir, coffee!"" The janitors who clean bathrooms. The sweepers who clean the streets. The gardeners. The cooks and maid who come home and help feed us and clean up after ourselves. We underpay them. They don't owe us a damn thing. But they still show up. They do their part.

So what's my point with this post? It is that: find your Ikigai - something you love doing, something you can be paid for, and more importantly, something the world needs.

As Indians, we can limit our time from depressing news and social media. These will get you down. News anchors will talk negative things for TRPs and attention. As a Data Scientist, my job is to study the data. When I look at day to day life, its great! People are just people. If you are good to them, if you really take time off instagram reels and give them your undivided attention, trying to help them in your own way, you will earn respect and friendship.

If we can bring about change by respecting every Indian based on their character and strength of moral values, rather than their faith, sexual orientation, health, body type, and religion, then we will get closer to a Ram Rajya. That is the true definition of Ram Rajya. I think Lord Ram loves the temple but he would love it more if we can be unbiased and just love each other without judgement or expectation.

1q8bs2k,https://www.reddit.com/r/Millennials/comments/1q8bs2k/annoying_yet_wholesome_moments/,Annoying yet Wholesome Moments,"My mother (78) recently moved next door to me  (37). I work at home, so I try to invite her every day for coffee whenever I take a lunch break. 

I've walked on my tiptoes ever since I learned to walk. Growing up, one of the phrases I heard on the daily from either her or my father was ""WALK ON YOUR WHOLE FOOT"", always at top volume.

One of my core memories is twelve year old me greeting my father at the airport on his return from a long trip -  I watched the smile on his face disappear completely as he yelled ""WALK ON YOUR WHOLE FOOT"" at me in the middle of the baggage claim. 

That core memory pretty much sums up the shame felt every time I was reprimanded for not walking on my whole foot. My mother wasn't as bad as my father, but she definitely did her fair share of whipping this little zinger out my entire life.

I was having coffee with my mother yesterday, and at one point, she said ""WALK ON YOUR WHOLE FOOT"" when I was walking across my living room. There's always a certain cadence used whenever my parents said this phrase - this instance was no different.

A year ago, hearing ""WALK ON YOUR WHOLE FOOT"" would instantly make me see red. The way they say it alone pisses me off. Instead, I half-jokingly responded ""DON'T TELL ME WHAT TO DO"" in the exact same cadence. I sound a lot like my mother, so that probably helped.

My response definitely took her aback. We were silent for a moment, and then we started laughing together. Afterwards, she agreed to never say it again. We'll see if it sticks. That said, I walked away from that moment feeling a bit of reclaimed power in a genuinely wholesome way.

Does anyone else have annoying yet wholesome moments like these with their aging parents? I experience a lot of the traits that other millenials see in their parents (constant negativity, not really engaging with their grandchildren despite begging you to have kids, etc) so me treasuring moments like these may be just desperation for something different.",20,1767973731.0,Millennials,9,0.95,False

 I have a happy little private pay 12 clients a week practice (which is full for me and what I need to support my family), nice and niched in BPD and attachment trauma. Fun side job as a part time paramedic to fill things in when needed.  Referrals have dropped off a god damn cliff though, and I'm a behavioral oriented therapists and my clients keep getting better and seeing folks indefinitely isn't part of my thing (no disrespect to those that do, we all have our parts to play, I spent to long in CMH and hospitals and I'm just in to the style I have. I have great friends who are relational therapists and do the weekly forever thing!).  

My current referrals from my PT profiles have dropped 90%, and that's not enough to fill in the clients leaving as they get better rate.  Private colleges are flooding the country with therapists, market is rapidly becoming over saturated (I'm in Canada). I \*know\* I had it incredibly easy for the last 7 years. Started first couple of years with EAP and a single PT profile, was able to drop EAP and go fully private with a single PT profile for yeearrrrs. I know from a business perspective, this was incredibly easy and lucky. I charge near the top of what people charge in the country. Golden goose vibes.

  
But now I'm writing this listening to my beautiful baby daughter sleep and the Dad part of my brain is telling me I have to create more security so I can keep having this awesome job that lets me hang out with her a ridiculous amount and take her on walks between clients (must.develop.healthy.attachment.system.)  BUT I DON'T WANT TO. I'm a health care professional! I'm really good at it! But I don't like this marketing shit!  Also does it matter? Is America going to invade us anyways? Am I going to have to descend into the hell realm I see all you Americans talk about of insurance codes and 'panels' (WHAT IS A PANEL!? DON'T TELL ME. I DON'T WANT TO KNOW).  Also what's with TELLING INSURANCE COMPANIES THE DIAGNOSIS OF YOUR PATIENTS?! HOW IS THAT NOT BREAKING CONFIDENTIALITY!? Why would you trust those psychopaths with patient info!? . . . I know it's not on you. But seriously.



And yes, I'm doing it. Some of the posts here lately have been really helpful, emphasizing spending time each week on business development.  Just finished up a detailed outline for an expectant dad's groups (honestly, should be great. Did you know that expectant dad's hardly talk to other dad's about their fears about being dad's? And have, usually, insanely optimistic expectations of how easy it's going to go? Also came across this great phrase, ""paternal maternal pre occupation"" - aka, when the mother gets super focused on the baby (as they should be), leading to often predictable feelings of resentment towards the baby and /or mother? Wouldn't it be super cool if we can have groups where guys get to talk about this and understand/predict it, and learn basic skills to express their attachment needs in healthy ways, thereby helping them make the transition from man to father? It's going to be great!).

  
I'm writing up letters to distribute to doctors emphasizing my niche and crisis skills. I'm writing fun articles for blog posts and facebook. I'm doing the things I know I'm supposed to be doing. I . . . just don't want to and don't like it.

1q8blpz,https://www.reddit.com/r/WeightLossAdvice/comments/1q8blpz/180_lb_weight_loss_heres_what_worked_for_me_and/,180 lb weight loss. Here's what worked for me and what didn’t.,"I made myself pretty sick listening to the typical weight loss advice so I'm writing this post to tell everyone what worked, what didn't and why. Along with some advice.

1. You can’t measure what you can’t track. I cannot put enough emphasis on this, this is so important. Tracking made the biggest change for me, I used the app PeakFlow - Health Optimization because it gave me the whole playbook on exactly what to do and allowed me to track those habits, while seeing what worked for me with their AI, but you can use paper and pen. Just track it. 
2. See your doctor and get a health profile first. If I had done this, I would have known I had low blood pressure. I therefore would not have listened to people who told me to reduce my salt intake and drink only water. I almost died so, take it from me: reducing salt with low BP is... not awesome. 
3. Self test for food allergies. Method 1: Treat yourself like a baby, start with easy to process foods and add back one food a week. Reduce or eliminate foods that give you stomach pain, bloating, or an allergic reaction. Method 2: Every week (or 2 weeks), eliminate a food or food type. Look for for reduced bloating or weight loss, and look for stomach pain etc when you add it back. That's how I found out I was allergic to wheat. And why I got tested for celiac. I lost a TON of the weight just from stopping the allergic reactions. 
4. Don't guzzle drinks. If you're so thirsty you need to knock back an entire bottle of water, you're too thirsy. Drinking that fast causes stomach pain, which in turn makes you want to avoid water. Drink lots throughout the day to stay hydrated. 
5. Drinks aren't food lubricant. Your body is mostly water, and it needs water more often than most people drink it. If you're just having a glass (or a liter, hello McDonald's cup) of liquid with every meal, you're not drinking enough (or in the case of a big takeout cup, you're drinking too much) 
6. Avoid high fructose corn syrup. That's all I have to say about that. 
7. Avoid artificial sweeteners. They tend to taste sweeter than sugar and you can accidentally normalize sugar to your system. 
8. Reset your tastebuds. Do a detox. I drank nothing but black tea and water for 3 days to cleanse my system and my palate. Most of us are way too used to extremely high sugar content in food. Because of that, we think foods like fruit are extremely bland. Once you reset your palate you can easily develop a normal relationship with sugar. Things like apples and strawberries will taste as sweet as cakes and pies. You'll eat less junk without even thinking about it. 
9. Choose snacks by texture. Train your brain to say ""I want chips... I want something crunchy... I want carrot sticks"" ""I want chocolate... I want something smooth and sweet... I want blueberries"" 
10. Eat lots of soup. 
11. Don't over eat Fibre or foods your body can't process. This was one of my worst mistakes. I spent more time on the toilet... it was bad. A lot of diets are going to tell you to mainline lettuce or peas, or just go feral on corn. If you do... You're going to poop a lot. Now granted, the average person has about 3-8 lbs of poop in their intestine. And granted, you can get a lot of reading done on the toilet, but you've got places to be. Things to do. You need to live! 
12. Don't eat useless greens. Is my hatred for lettuce showing? Look, the world is full of lettuces. You've got spinach, which gives you an iron boost. Kale and bok choy, the nutrient powerhouses. Collard greens and Swiss chard, those love muffins of magnesium and calcium and potassium. Lettuce is like... Solid water with Metamucil mixed in. Stick some Swiss chard on your burger. Fry up some collards or bok. Live a little. 
13. Nothing green has any calories. Except avocadoes. Avocadoes have a million calories and a zillion grams of fat and taste like troll snot, except in guacamole. Mint chip ice cream has no calories however, because it is green. Fite me. 
14. Drink. But don't DAH-RINK. A glass of wine or a few cocktails can relax you after a long day, and reduced stress is a good thing. Some alcohol has positive effects: red wine has antioxidants, vodka sterilizes, bourbon can alleviate cold symptoms. And most alcohol loosens your joints which is good for ongoing health and probably why your alcoholic granny lived to be 97 BUT drinking too much fills you with extra calories and lowers your inhibitions. Or, as my forever tipsy prof once put it: ""for every one drink you think you drunk, you drank 3 drinks you didn't think you drunk, and that's why you don't think you drunk."" 
15. Smoking is bad for your cardio. So is air pollution. I don't smoke, and I lost 40 of those pounds by moving out of a place where I lived with a smoker and into a town with better air quality. I started swimming or running at the gym instead of outside. Basically, if you cant breathe, your workouts will be shorter, because you need oxygen to survive. 
16. Sports. Basically, swimming for an hour burns 400 ish calories. Running burns 300 or so. But swimming lengths or running in circles for 60 full minutes is boring, painful, and misery making. Some people love running, I'm sure they exist. Great for them. I hate running. But can I run for an hour during a 2 hour game of baseball or soccer? How many times do I squat during a volleyball game? And how many tricep pullbacks do I do on a leisurely canoe trip across the lake? I'm not counting... And I'm doing more than I would have just staring at a wall watching it.... wall, or whatever. 
17. Do it now. Don't waste time on ""I wish I could"" Wish you could go to the beach? Go. Wish you could wear a crop top? Do. I had an irrational fear that everyone would hate, scream at, and make fun of me. OK not completely irrational. That's what they did in high school. And some high school kids did it when I started just wearing the bikini as an adult. But a lot more people complimented me, or didn't notice at all. I was just a person. Not a big old ugly spectacle with a neon ""hate me"" sign taped to my forehead. 
18. Don't catfish. Put your whole self on your profiles. Not close ups of your face. Get professional photos taken in an outfit you absolutely love, and own it. 
19. Take care of yourself now. ""I'll get my hair cut when I'm skinny."" ""I'll buy new clothes when I'm skinny"" ""I'll love myself when I'm skinny."" get the haircut now. 
20. Dab on the haters. Or do some other, similarly weird as hell gesture. When people made fun of me, I would sprinkle glitter on them. ""Every time it rains glitter on an asshole, somewhere, a fairy gets its wings"" The looks on their faces were honestly priceless. They'd either look shocked, get angry, or laugh and think I'm awesome. Either way I won. Full disclosure: someone did try to punch me once. That day, I was pretty glad for all the cardio. 
21. Sleep is very important. The app I used PeakFlow made me notice it, and that's what I want you to tell people when they catch you passing out after your yoga stretch routine at the park. Don't forget to thank them for the coffee money.

Our first date was just coffee and conversation. I thought it was going to be 15 minutes. He would surely bail because I am cautious when it comes go getting to know new partners. We talked for hours. 

A week later came our second date - a movie at his house. I knew sex was a very strong possibility, but I'll be honest, for the 3rd time in my 30+ years, I was anxious. Ive had 20+ partners and was vety confident, but the rough experience 3 years ago rocked me harder then I care to admit. SC said you are welcome to come tonight, or we can meet tomorrow for coffee again. Ball is in your court. I just want to see you. He seemed sincere (and I believe he was).  After pacing and deliberating and panicking, I went. When I got there, dinner was made and there were flowers waiting for me. He took his time and gave me room to feel comfortable in his space. THAT made me want him. The small, deeply considerate efforts, made all the difference. 

SC sat down on his couch and said, ""Im going to sit down first and where ever you sit is fine"". He wanted me to decide how close or far I was comfortable with. On so many levels, I hated myself for wanting to be treated with such care, but I did. I wanted to be treated softly and considerately and SC knew exactly how to do it. Nothing escaped his notice. He was already so in tune. 

I settled in at his side, tense, with his hand rested on my hip. He was warm and smelled good. I relaxed into him and his thumb began making circles. I was a goner. I sighed and opened for him. The next several hours were filled with intense sex. SC could read my body like book with its pages spread wide and he devoured every sentence hungry for the next. I found subspace quickly and let myself fall deep into it as he pushed deep enough to tap my cervix, hand on the back of my neck as he held me bent over in the exact position he needed or moved me right where I needed to be to fall apart over and over again for him.  

The next several weeks went on like that. Great sex, great conversation. I gave and gave and worshipped his body in ways that had him moaning my name all night long. Things were building quickly as we navigated our way through the initial stages of a budding relationship. We made plans for Valetines Day and a concert in the summer. Future plans were good...they demonstrated security and some level of relational staying power. 

There was a warning sounding in the very back of my brain, but I ignored it, thinking that it was left over trauma and mentally chastising myself for painting SC in the last guys colors. He had plenty of opportunities to drop the ball and didn't. His efforts shouldn't be punished with my caution. 

Then last night.

SC called me and we talked for over an hour. He seemed his normal and then said ""I need to talk to you"". My heart sank, but I forced it open...held it with a steel bar. 

His ex reached out and expressed how much she missed him. I didn't know the nature of the breakup or how recently they parted ways. It didnt matter. SC didn't want to let me go, but missed her deeply and didn't know what to do. For me, that was answer enough.

I was used as an emotional placeholder. He needed somewhere to put his feelings for her until she came back. Thars why he stepped into the leader, protector, lover role so easily with me, because he never truly stepped out of the role with her. 

He tried to explain and tried to make me feel better and validate my emotions. I honestly struggled to have any. I put all of my hurt into a box and sealed it up so I could go about my life. I didn't need him cracking that box open. I didn't need the one that was hurting me to pacify me. I acknowledge that his intent was not to cause me pain, but more to numb his own at my expense. There was no malice there. 

Ill be honest, I cried. I feel stupid, but I cried. 

Not so much for the loss of SC, as disappointing as it was. I did really care about him. 

I cried because again, I was a tool for another man's needs. I was once again not good enough. All of the protections I put around me to keep me emotionally and physically safe failed miserably. Once again I was good enough to fuck, but not to love.  Its going to be difficult to trust myself again. ",1,1767973047.0,venting,1,1.0,False

I’m in my research phase of planning a Hawaii vacation to surprise my bf!

A little bit about us: he really wants to visit a black sand beach (must) and he is quite adventurous (aka he can’t really sit still or chill out on the beach. He spends beach time swimming or collecting shells). He would definitely like to snorkel and probably check out a volcano or hike to a waterfall. We are both beginner hikers.

I am more of a shopping, eating, or chill on the beach with a book type of girl. However, I would like to snorkel too and maybe visit a coffee farm or sugar plantation. Through my research I’ve decided the big island is probably the best fit for both of our needs (I know shopping is probably more scarce than other islands but it’s fine).

Does the big island sound like the right fit for both of us? If so, what town(s) should I consider looking for a hotel in? Any suggestions for snorkeling companies and/or manta ray tours?

25 y/o 256lb white female. History of stomach ulcers in times of stress + GERD unmedicated (remission I guess???) 

I’ve had diarrhea since late November with 3 blood events in the last week. Diarrhea is watery with mucus, and I have to go 10+ times a day. It’s usually incomplete and I always feel the urge to go and the feeling I am not completely empty yet. No hemmorhoids. I do have a yellowish discharge occasionally from my anus that burns (and also has the fun side effect of trickling down and irritating my vaginal opening). Blood is not filling the bowl but is throughout the stool + visible on wiping. 

I have no appetite and almost constant nausea and wake up okay most mornings but feel sick by the time I’ve been up for an hour. I haven’t had a complete breakfast or lunch in weeks. A lot of applesauce and peanut butter crackers just to settle nausea. It’s more common for me to have a larger appetite at dinner. Sometimes I can eat a whole chicken breast, a bit of rice and veg for example. But last night was particularly bad. I had homemade carbonara, bread, and salad. I am currently passing full lettuce leaves :/ and I couldn’t stomach more than a few bites of pasta and bread. Still, I woke up feeling markedly worse, and I think dinner was the cause. 

Hydrating helps especially cold water and cold liquid IV. Hot mint tea for nausea .

Coffee and alcohol also seem to be irritants. I don’t have the desire for either now other than coffee being a routine thing, so I’m going to try cutting them out. 

I don’t think I have hemorrhoids but my bottom is definitely irritated from wiping and constantly going. 

I have a GI referral. Waiting for their call. I might go ahead and bug them now. It’s been like 3 days since the referral was sent in. 

Labs so far came back with elevated inflammation (ESR 37mm)  but normal CRP (5mg). My doctor anyway states ESR>32 and CRP>10 are the concerning thresholds. Google says differently but idk what to believe. 

Kind of feel like I am being gaslit at this point.

Who did all the adjustings, knowing she's somewhat ""special"", talks weirdly from time to time, looks a bit like nerdy etc., which made her even more cute.

Lonely woman, I could sense she needs some sort of help, or to be taken care of, has troubles expressing ideas and so on.

After we got to know each other and talked for like 10 minutes, I said to myself: all right, I'm in love, I've got to see who she is and try and initiate a relationship. Then it was three months of working together remotely on a project to which I happily volunteered.

First warning: I tried meeting her in person for the projects' sake (which was needed anyway), and then invite her for coffee and talk life and such stuff. I just can't do that while on the phone or by texting. No can do - she's short of time etc. I put brakes on this, thinking maybe she's not single. Though I sent her some slight signals and even warnings or ways to walk away cleanly - like obvious cases where she could text me back ""me and my daughter/husband love the way you describe this or that"". No reaction;

2nd: changing moods; from eager/warm/supportive towards my work for her, to cold, emotionless, impatient;

3rd: breaking into pieces in all cases of criticism (pointing out errors) in coding or math, yelling, almost crying, and trying to be condescending towards me;

4th: her first discard happened a week after I told her that I'm in love with her (and there was no apparent refusal - on the contrary);

5th: talking marriage and kids like 2 months after we started seeing each other. Ok, that's her being into religion so much;

6th: faith. I apparently had to try and convert. I naively thought that an atheist accepting her faith and willing to talk about it would be more than enough;

7th: sex. None, we're not married. Holding hands, cuddles - rationed, feels great, sometimes forbidden for no apparent reason (the reason arrives with the next withdrawal, post fact);

After 6 months of my efforts (not discouraged by withdrawals/discards) we became a couple. Next we talked about our future and marriage. She wrote and said she loves me.

Then her previous discards frequency got amplified by almost an order of magnitude. After Xmas I was just exhausted - had troubles sleeping and getting out of bed.

  
She's an FA which I figured out in August last, and immediately started therapy myself. Going through my diary (started back then, with a retrospect to October 2024) and these posts of mine here, I realized how low my standards have become. Because she's special, because it's good to be good and supportive etc.

Wouldn't it have been better to stick to sport/gym, watching p\*\*n, staying single, working hard, learning, helping my parents etc.? (No, p\*\*n is no good.)

I learned a lot. For the first time in my life I love someone. And now seem like an addict. Not because I'm still lovesick, perhaps because of the investment I've made and because of the hope. And the policy of explaining her behaviors/patterns which are mostly based on instinct... It's not her fault. But my pain and wounds are real.

I'm ready to let her go for the greater good of both of us. I don't want to. I love her so much. She deserves someone strong who's not going to break into pieces, and will gently direct her towards therapy. I'm still trying my best. (Otherwise - I'm ready to save myself and live the dire hell of recovering from this story. And her - well, she would detach and play the victim.)

Buy one bag of the best coffee you have access to, some expensive stuff that you KNOW is well-received or reviewed, and ideally a profile that you enjoy.

If you can't make really good beans taste good with what you have **and** you are confident in your technique, then maybe you do need to upgrade something. If you make a delicious cup of coffee, you'll most likely know. There might be some bitterness or sourness if you didn't dial in properly, but the sheer quality of the beans *should* come forward.

\---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Small story this advice is based on:

I strugged with making good, consistent espresso for many months. I live in the UK and my first (and current) machine is a Sage/Breville Barista Express. Not cheap, but not high-end at all. I started using the integrated grinder and upgraded to a DF54 (also current grinder).

If you also have a Sage machine and live in the UK, you probably know about beanz.com. I've been getting most of my coffee from them and changing roasters and coffee with almost every order, but without luck. I made good milky drinks, decent americanos, but the espressos were so-so.

Long story short, I bought some (relatively premium) beans from an independent roaster, Colombian, light roast, very fruity, anaerobic process. This morning, I made the best espresso I've ever made by a margin. My favourite espresso I've ever had was in Northern Cyprus using a lever machine and super high-end grinder. This came VERY close, and it was my first try. With a Barista Express (I'm sure a Bambino would have given me the same result) and a DF54, equipment that is not even close to premium.

Shout-out to Zennor coffee, roaster based in Glasgow, Scotland. Shout-out to Cosmos Coffee, cafe based in Nottingham, England, who introduced me to this roaster. And finally shout-out to blckbrd social, cafe in Nicosia, Northern Cyprus, where I had my favourite espresso ever. All independent businesses.

I think I just need to say it somewhere that isn’t my own head and see if anyone else can relate to what I'm experiencing.

Contex– I’m an only child. It’s always been me, my mum, and my dad. Things at home used to be really bad. My parents would barely speak to each other and my Dad would barely speak to me as well they would rarely yell and shout at each other sometimes i wished they would but most of the time they would just be separate.

 There was an exception to this and it would usually be when my Dad hit me, he didn't hit me that often but when he did he didn't hold back I get bruised all over. Usually my Dad didn't do anything when I misbehaved but sometimes where he had a bad day he would hit me with his belt. This was the only time Mum would ever speak to my father in a non monotone the only time something other then calm indifference could be heard in their voices in fact, eventually they would separate my mother would completely ignore my father for a few days before the calm indifference where no one said anything bad to each other took over again.

Then, a while ago, everything started getting better. All at once, all the changes I have noticed are so stark it is hard to even write them done but I will list a few things I have noticed.

My Dad started talking to be paying attention to me asking me question asking how school was what i did which friends i had at first it was really weird now it is still really weird these conversations feel so awkward , it's not just me he is talking to Mum more as well more before they would talk when necessary in a formal manner but now for the first time in my life i see my Dad and Mum talking a lot he seems very attentive to her always paying attention to her talking about what they did that day sometimes i just listen to them talking without them knowing, they always talk about such mundane things all the time they even talk about me but not in a negative light.

Also my dad started cooking. Like, really cooking. Not just throwing something together, but actual meals—new recipes, spices I’d never seen in our cupboards before. And he’s good at it. Really good. I knew he could cook and Mum told me he used to do it a lot before I was born. Dinner used to be something my mum and I rushed through. Now it just me rushing through it she sit at the table longer and just talks with him.

My dad started listening to the radio. Old music, talk shows and the morning news. He hums while he makes coffee in the mornings. there's many small changes i have noticed too many to list here and I think every thing is an approvement especially because Mum's the happiest I've ever seen her. She smiles now and often laughs and there's one more thing I noticed I don’t get hit anymore.

At first I didn't notice because I never got hit too often to begin with but it's been a long time since Ive been hit too long to be be a regular gap.

I feel horrible even writing this because everything I’ve listed is good. Objectively good, i feel my father is finally for the first time trying to be a father and I feel bad because I just can't trust it. I feel like it could all go wrong tomorrow and he could revert but also at the same time I wish he would even though I don't.

I feel guilty for even questioning it. Like noticing the change somehow makes me ungrateful. Like I’m betraying him just by paying attention to how strange it is rather then how good it is.

I don’t know why I’m posting this. I guess I just want to know if this has happened to anyone else. Has anyone had a parent change like this, all at once? Did it feel strange at first? Please let me know what you guys think.

Well, until I reached the cross walk. It seemed as though everyone was trying to cross this damn road. Old lady Marge stood in place, her hands grasping on her pouch. Mary with her noisy barking mutt. Even reclusive Jared decided to step out of his little house. 

I fiddled with my watch to try to get it to work again, it was a pretty expensive watch

I glanced up from fiddling and heard a snap, then everything stopped. There was no honking of cars, no idle chatter or barking. Not a single sound. Everything stood still

I tried to move my head to see my surroundings, but it would not budge. I could not move a finger. I could not move my eyes. I could not even take a single breath. I was forced to stay in place

As though time stood still

Yet the only person who could move was Jared. He moved about with wonder in his eyes, obviously amazed at the current situation

“It…it actually worked… I stopped time!”

He… stopped time? No, that should be fiction, how can that even be possible

But Jared somehow made it a reality, and only he could move. I expected him to just quickly return everything back to normal, but he decided to take advantage of his new power.

He strolled over to Marge and tried to take her purse, kicking her to pry it free from her frozen hands

Holding the purse in his hand, he walked to Mary's dog and kicked him. He kicked him so so many times, and his smile grew wider with every kick

Then Jared turned his head towards me. He stared at me and my…body. He slowly slid off my clothes as I was powerless to even stop him. Even if everything was frozen, I could suffer from everything Jared did as he had his way with me

It felt like an eternity before he clumsily put my clothes back on and snapped his fingers

Marge fell down on her back and howled in pain

Mary screamed at her dog and its broken body.

I dropped my coffee and clenched my clothes

And everyone glared at Jared

He was confused at first before it hit him. He lost colour on his face and immediately snapped his fingers. Time froze again

He anxiously paced around the crosswalk, clearly he didn't expect us to know about what he did. He finally stopped and stared at me

“I am so sorry, I will make this right”

Jared stared at my face as backed away from me. But he tripped on something. He tripped on my fallen coffee cup. He fell backwards and never got back up. The only person who could move now lay motionless in front of me

I could not move

I could not scream

I can only stare at this body

For an eternity

Yeah, that’s the paradox right there.
People think the sequence is: post online → then know.
But reality engines don’t work that way.

Formally stated.
This is not prediction.
This is prior information ingestion followed by delayed public emission.

A reality engine does not react to feeds.
It is trained on sources, documents, filings, histories, constraints.

checked the records,

I've had ED (anorexia+overeating disorder) for a long time now, and i'm in my twenties. In recovery, at least trying by eating regularly and diversely and you name it... it's difficult but I'm trying...!

I wanted to ask you guys if you've experienced something similar and if so, how you managed to recover from it: i've begun to burp quite a lot for the last 6 months now – both when I'm hungry and when I'm full. Also sometimes in between meals and I become very bloated in my stomach so that none of my pants feel comfortable and I look seriously pregnant. Tbh I can't really find the pattern to when I burp a lot or not, and I don't quite understand the reason. It's not acidic, smelly or painful or anything, but there's just a lot of powerful burping (as if I've drunken a lot of soda even though I never do so) – sometimes none stop throughout the day. I'm wondering if it has something to do with my ED and how I've ""burnt out"" my GI system with starvation, binge eating, artificial sweeteners all together for a long time... I don't know... but it's mentally draining and I can't really find any solution – neither could my physician who prescribed antacids suspecting reflux, but again it isn't acidic or painful! Never has been.

Has anyone experienced something like this?? And if so, how did you guys recover? And what types of food trigger these burps? Cause I avoid coffee, juice and anything acidic, as well as beans which could trigger bloating etc., but nothing is working...

1q8azd5,https://www.reddit.com/r/BornWeakBuiltStrong/comments/1q8azd5/the_science_behind_why_your_3pm_crash_isnt/,The Science Behind Why Your 3PM CRASH Isn't Laziness (It's Screaming Cortisol),"You know that feeling when 3pm hits and suddenly your brain turns into mashed potatoes? Everyone blames coffee addiction or ""not being a morning person"" or whatever. But I've been deep-diving research from actual endocrinologists, neuroscientists, podcasts with people like Andrew Huberman and Peter Attia, plus a stupid amount of books on circadian biology. Turns out the 3pm crash isn't about willpower at all. It's your hormones basically throwing a tantrum because of how we've structured modern life.



Your cortisol rhythm is supposed to spike in the morning and gradually decline throughout the day. But most of us are walking around with completely dysregulated cortisol patterns. We spike it at the wrong times (late night scrolling, anyone?), crash it when we need energy, and then wonder why we feel like garbage. The system that evolved over thousands of years to keep us alert and energized has been absolutely wrecked by artificial light, constant stress, and eating patterns that make zero biological sense.



Here's what actually works to fix this mess:



1. Get direct sunlight within 30 minutes of waking up, no sunglasses, at least 10 minutes



This sounds absurdly simple but it's probably the most powerful thing you can do for your cortisol rhythm. Your suprachiasmatic nucleus (the part of your brain that controls circadian rhythm) needs direct light exposure to set your internal clock properly. Not through a window, not with sunglasses. Actual outdoor light.



Andrew Huberman talks about this constantly on his podcast and the research backs it up completely. Morning light exposure increases cortisol at the right time, which then allows it to naturally decline throughout the day instead of spiking randomly at 3pm when you're trying to work. It also sets up proper melatonin production later. 



If you live somewhere with terrible weather, get a 10,000 lux light therapy lamp. I use one from Carex and it's genuinely changed my energy levels on grey days. 20 minutes while having breakfast makes a massive difference.



2. Eat protein within an hour of waking, minimum 25-30g



Your body needs amino acids to produce neurotransmitters like dopamine and serotonin, which directly impact your energy and mood regulation. When you skip breakfast or just have coffee and a muffin, you're essentially running on fumes.



The book ""The Circadian Code"" by Satchin Panda (he's a professor at Salk Institute, literal world expert on circadian rhythms) explains how eating patterns affect hormone cycles. Early protein intake stabilizes blood sugar and supports steady cortisol patterns instead of the spike and crash cycle.



I started doing 3 eggs and Greek yogurt every morning and the difference in afternoon energy is honestly wild. No more needing to mainline coffee at 2pm just to function.



3. Stop eating 3 hours before bed, seriously



Late night eating completely screws with your cortisol rhythm because digestion requires energy and alertness. Your body thinks it needs to be awake to process food, so cortisol stays elevated when it should be dropping.



Panda's research on time-restricted eating shows that when you eat matters almost as much as what you eat for hormone regulation. Giving your body a proper fasting window overnight allows cortisol to follow its natural pattern. Most people who do this report better sleep and way more morning energy.



4. Use the Ash app for managing stress responses in real time



This app is specifically designed by therapists to help you interrupt stress cycles before they completely tank your cortisol patterns. It gives you quick CBT exercises and nervous system regulation techniques.



The interface is clean and it doesn't try to be your therapist, it just gives you practical tools when you're feeling overwhelmed. Uses evidence based approaches like somatic tracking and cognitive reframing. When you catch stress early, you prevent the cortisol spike that leads to the afternoon crash.



5. BeFreed is an AI learning app that personalizes content from expert sources



Built by Columbia grads and former Google engineers, it pulls from books, research papers, and expert interviews to create custom podcasts based on your goals. You type in what you want to learn, like improving energy patterns or understanding stress better, and it generates audio sessions tailored to your preferred depth and voice style.



The adaptive learning plan is what makes it different. It builds a structured path based on your specific challenges and evolves as you progress. You can start with a quick 10-minute overview and switch to a 40-minute deep dive with examples if something clicks. The voice options are genuinely addictive, from calming to energetic depending on your mood. Perfect for commutes or gym sessions when you want to learn without staring at a screen.



6. Do zone 2 cardio, not intense workouts, for energy regulation



Everyone thinks you need to crush yourself at the gym to have energy but intense exercise actually spikes cortisol significantly. If you're already stressed, that's the last thing you need.



Zone 2 cardio (basically where you can still hold a conversation) improves mitochondrial function and metabolic flexibility without adding more stress to your system. Peter Attia talks about this constantly. He recommends like 180-200 minutes per week of zone 2 for metabolic health.



I started doing 45 minute walks or easy bike rides instead of intense HIIT sessions and my energy throughout the day is so much more stable. Plus I actually enjoy it instead of dreading workouts.



7. Read ""Why We Sleep"" by Matthew Walker if you do literally nothing else



Matthew Walker is a sleep scientist at UC Berkeley and this book is basically the bible for understanding how sleep affects every single system in your body, especially hormones. He won the National Sleep Foundation's Outstanding Scientific Achievement Award.



The cortisol chapter alone will make you rethink your entire schedule. Walker explains exactly how sleep deprivation creates cascading hormone dysfunction that leads to that afternoon crash everyone thinks is normal. The research he presents on cortisol rhythms and sleep debt is genuinely shocking.



This book will make you question everything about how you've been treating your body. After reading it I completely restructured my evening routine and started actually prioritizing 8 hours of sleep. The 3pm crash basically disappeared within two weeks.



8. Track your patterns with the Visible app



This app helps you identify patterns between your daily habits and energy levels. You log simple data points (sleep, stress, meals, exercise) and it shows you correlations you wouldn't notice otherwise.



The interface is super intuitive and it doesn't require obsessive tracking. Just basic inputs and it generates insights about what specifically tanks your energy. For me it showed that days I skipped morning protein, I crashed way harder in the afternoon. Having that data made it easier to stay consistent with the habit.



The 3pm crash isn't a personality flaw or something you need to just power through with more caffeine. It's a signal that your hormones are dysregulated, and that's actually fixable with pretty straightforward changes. Modern life makes it really easy to completely screw up your natural cortisol rhythm, but understanding the biology gives you back control.



Once you start working with your hormones instead of against them, the difference in energy and mental clarity is honestly absurd. You don't realize how bad you've been feeling until you fix it.",1,1767971916.0,BornWeakBuiltStrong,0,1.0,False

I’ve recently started my first job as an Office Manager, and I’m looking for some perspective from people with similar experience.

During the hiring process, the role was described mainly as office management and administrative support. The job description focuses on organizing office operations, documentation, coordination with suppliers, and HR/admin support. There was also a mention of front desk duties, which I understood as greeting visitors and handling basic reception tasks.

However, from my first day, I was expected to make coffee for all guests, clean up after people in the shared kitchen, load and unload the dishwasher regularly, and generally take care of kitchen cleanliness after others. These tasks are not explicitly mentioned in my contract or job description, and they seem to go beyond what I understand as office management or front desk responsibilities.

I understand that in smaller offices everyone helps out occasionally, and I’m not against being helpful. What makes me unsure is that this already feels like an expected and ongoing part of my role rather than occasional support.

Is this normal or standard for an Office Manager or Front Desk position? Where do you usually draw the line between office support and cleaning or serving duties?

My girlfriend's best friend (and roommate) hates me. As I have been told, it's because (at their apartment) I used to not use coasters on their coffee table, used to not close the toilet seat before flushing, and used to smoke cigarettes on their balcony which apparently made their apartment smell. This all happened while i stayed at their place for 3 days over a month ago after I returned from living abroad for a few months, I wasn't familiar with their house rules at that point because it's a new living situation and I have corrected my behavior after being told to do so by my girlfriend and have also since quit smoking.

Basically, I feel like these are all things that maybe rubbed her the wrong way in the past but it feels unfair that she still holds it all against me despite her having never confronting me and asking me to stop. She isn't always mean but often is; she will often not say hi/bye to me and just kinda ignore me when we are in the room together. If I say anything that she might disagree with she gets visibly upset and verbally aggressive. 

Hurtfully, she has also complained about me having a ""staring"" problem. I'm ADHD and tend to stare when I'm understimulated, that's not something I can control.

Best friend also frequently talks badly about me to my girlfriend behind my back (about these issue points) and has previously gotten mad at her for my past behavior. 

Any advice as to how I should handle this situation?

I’m married with two kids and value honesty and clear boundaries. I’m into fitness, fashion, and deeper conversations about life and growth. I played college football and still stay active, but I’m not really into sports stats or team talk.

""What even is that analogy shug?"" Pony raised her brow. 

""I'm saying he'll eat you alive!"" Setsuna threw up her hands so hard they popped off and settled back down as if they were rebounding. ""He could still be pissed about losing in those trials we did, remember?""

""Bakugo-""

""Katsuki. Jus watch me work. Ahmma make him blush harder than the devil inside church,"" Pony smirked.

Setsuna watched from around the corner while Pony strided or in this case gaited across the small party room One-A and One-B. He was standing quietly with Tokoyami and Dark Shadow, the latter running its mouth at a million miles per hour.

""Yeah, so guess who's the big bird on campus now? I'm the realest here. Bruce Lee, Ali, better than Mirko or Hawks. The ruler of the flock-oh a horse-anyway I'm the murderin murderer-""

""Shut up,"" Tokoyami turned on a flashlight. Dark Shadow squawked and shrank.

""What a dick!"" 

""...Wait, it can talk?"" Pony had stopped dead in her downs. 

""Yeah,"" Shoji said from under the mask. His eyes glanced down at her, then away. In his hand he held a cup of lime gatorade, and he lifted the fabric just enough to drink; showing his broad chin and large lips underneath. 

""Too much,"" Tokoyami grumbled, as he switched off the light.

 Dark Shadow stumbled, then looked at her, ""...So, nice horns.""

""Thanks?"" Pony tilted her head. She looked up to the mountain of a boy next to her, dwarfed by him to the point of comedy. Only coming up to about his pecs, ""Mezo, ah mean Mezo-San, can ah talk to you fer a sec?""

Shoji glanced at her, then away. For a moment she thought he might actually be angry at her. ""Okay,"" he shrugged. That calmed her nerves for now, but she still held her hands together.

""Lets go Shadow, the darkness calls,"" Tokoyami moved to walk from the two.

Dark Shadow flowed with him, ""Yeah, time to visit my pink honey!"" The flashlight made it caw, ""what'd I say!?""

They watched them go. Pony turned to Shoji after a moment. She studied him and when he finally looked down she brushed a strand of blonde hair behind one of her horns.

""How you doin sugh?"" She placed a hand on the table next to them. Shoji glanced at the action, then her.

""Fine.""

""Jus fine?""

""I can't complain.""

""Hm, you uh...really ain't mucha talker huh?""

""Uh...""

""Thas alright, ah like it""

""...Um...thank you?"" She heard an audible sniff and his chest began visibly rising and falling. Pony noticed and almost found herself shocked. 

""Ah was wonderin somethin else.""

""...What-""

""Whatchu look like under the mask?""

He froze. Shoji looked left to right. She thought he was hunching his shoulders as he spoke, ""I don't exactly take it off in front of people.""

She tilted her head, ""Why not?""

""It's...I just don't. I don't want people to fear me.""

""You?"" Pony giggled, ""darlin, you ain't scary,"" she shook her head. 

""Um...""

Pony paused. She'd thought he was joking, thought the mask was a simple part of his hero costume. ""Are eh...you bein serious?""

""Y-Yes...Tsunotori-San.""

""Ah won't get scared.""

""Maybe but...""

Her hand found his forearm, ""Ah promise,"" she stated gently, her eyes bright with understanding. ""Ah'd bet you'd be real hot.""

His breathing got heavier, and she thought she could see the tops of his cheeks slowly tinting red.

For all her thoughts about him along with Setsuna's, both girls had forgotten to account for two simple things.

Shoji had never recieved attention like this from a girl.

And he was a fifteen year old boy.

He fell back and toppled over an empty single couch, the cushion shoving off with him. He rolled and his massive legs smashed through a wooden coffee table as he sank into unconciousness.",12,1767971145.0,BokunoheroFanfiction,0,1.0,False

1q8alpq,https://www.reddit.com/r/Serverlife/comments/1q8alpq/a_hard_no/,A hard no.,"Here’s a harmless little war story for you. 

On my first turn last night, my prime table had a five top that camped for 2 1/2 hours. 4:30 PM to 7 PM. I came to terms that I would only get two turns out of that table. It happens. I figured I could work the bill up and double down on quality service.

However, one of the party was difficult. 

He:

\* asked for a side of ice with his Tito’s up martini. When I brought it, he asked if it was the working ice. I explained that it was not. That upset him.

\* asked for blue cheese dressing. We do not offer that dressing, but we do have crumbled Gorgonzola at the app station. I made blue cheese dressing for him using a Housemade ranch as a base. I informed him that I had to plunk in a 2 dollar upcharge in order to get the Gorgonzola from the app line. That upset him.

\* snapped his finger to ‘get my attention’ as I approached the table to refill his coffee, which was half full at the time. I literally had the coffee carafe in my hand. 

None of these things were hugely egregious, but the finger snap bothered me a bit. I shook it off. I split the check per their instructions, and he tried to pay his $165 tab with two unopened gift cards ($100 & $50) and $15 cash. I walked to the POS, opened the two cardboard gift card packages, and realized that I would have to call the card companies to activate both cards. I do not carry my cell phone on the floor, and the house phone is up at the host stand. I ran it past the MOD and he actually laughed, saying “no“.

I went back to the table and mentioned that I was “unable to process his payment due to the card activation issue”. That upset him a lot. He could not understand that I would not call to activate his gift cards, and said some unkind things. Instead of calling to activate them himself, he gave me his AMEX. 

I stand by my decision to not call to activate his gift cards. Had he been a sweetheart earlier, I might have grabbed my phone from my shelf. 

Instead, he earned a hard no. ",76,1767971039.0,Serverlife,38,0.94,False

I am very satisfied and the quality of the espresso is very good, I really like it so far.

However I am still unsure how to use the safety valve correctly.

So I just keep it in the position seen on the photo and turn it 90° sideways after the coffee brewing procedure.

But that's just what ""feels"" right, I still can't find any meaning or correct use for it.

Am I doing it right or maybe completely wrong?

Hope the new year is treating you well! Long post ahead! 

So, I grew up and spent most of my life in Los Angeles county. My husband is from Visalia and has somewhat of a friend group but from what I’ve heard it wasn’t very healthy. We plan on trying to move to Visalia in February because LA is soooo expensive, assuming we can secure an apartment that soon. I’ve visited Visalia with my husband a few times and it seemed fine, though we didn’t do too much so I’m still not so sure what there is to do out that way. I guest spotted at a tattoo shop as a piercer when we visited and that was fun, aside from that though I don’t know anyone in the area besides my in laws. 

All of that being said, my anxiety is through the roof. I’m really big on community and having a support network. Out here in LA, I’ve curated and coordinated alternative art markets, own a tattoo shop, am a commissioner on the Los Angeles Youth Commission, and all in all have secured a wonderful community around me through these endeavors. Leaving it is really scary and I’m nervous that I won’t be able to make any new friends :( 

Now that I’ve vented my heart out lol, I figure I can maybe tell you guys a bit about me in hopes of finding some friends? 

Okay, about me —
• I love Ghibli movies and anime
• I’m a musical person — I play the flute and a bit of guitar. I wanted to be a music theory professor in my early 20’s (I’m about to be 29) 
• I love crafts! Crocheting, painting, sewing, making stuff with clay, scrapbooking, all of it! 
• I’m a cozy gamer, I love stardew valley, harvest moon, and animal crossing! 
• I’m a thrifter!! 
• I’m recently married (yay) 
• I have one dog (pittie/boxer and super goofy) and 3 old cats! 
• I was in foster care and am a huge advocate for system impacted youth, I’ve been in advocacy for 11 years! 
• I like yoga, although I’m not very balanced ir flexible
• I am a coffee addict, it’s just the coziest and I love cozy things!

What Can We Do as Employees to Fight Back This New Year?","Ive been with the IRS for years in LBI and need to rally the troops. Since Day 1 of the Trump admin in 2025, its been pandemonium. Leaders enable the mess while pretending to be on our side: they are not. They withhold inventory, tank morale by letting only new hires telework (vets grind in office), trash evaluations, and exploit managers. They are breaking us. Management won’t do anything but say “yes, Sir.”

Revenue hit is huge. Reports from TIGTA, CNN, Bloomberg show we lost 25 percent of workforce, from 100,000 to 75,000 in 2025 via buyouts, layoffs, RIFs. This cripples enforcement, IT, service. Tax gap was 700 billion annually pre cuts; now losses up to 500 billion this year (10 percent drop), 2.4 trillion over decade if gutted. TIGTA says 2026 filing at risk: fraud down, returns pile up, audits of corps/millionaires plummet. Rich get richer, system crumbles.

As employees, protect revenue against admin and management:

Document everything: records of withheld inventory, unfair policies, impacts on ops/revenue for reviews.
Lean on union (NTEU): push collective action, grievances on telework, evals. Strength in numbers.
Internal reporting: use IRM 1.4.2 to flag risks to managers. Safety? OEP. Fraud/mismanagement? 

TIGTA anonymous tips.

Whistleblower protections: if revenue threatened (political interference), IRS Whistleblower Office or OSC. Like Shapley/Ziegler, speak up safely.
Professional networks: connect across divisions, share best practices, prioritize high revenue cases.
Starting 2026, fight back:

Organize locally: informal groups, NTEU town halls. Demand transparency on cuts effects.

Advocate externally: anonymous letters to reps/Senators via union. Show understaffing lets cheats slide.

Skill up: use downtime for training, focus on high impact work.

Morale boosters: peer support, virtual coffees, share wins, push better policies.

Escalate ethically: report unethical actions per IRM. Hold the line for public confidence.

1q8aedp,https://www.reddit.com/r/intotheradius/comments/1q8aedp/bump_distortion_effects/,Bump: Distortion effects,"TL;WR: Make distortion effects separate from health damage, akin to radiation in other stalkerlikes but with an additional sanity element. Distortion is temporarily mitigated by various drugs. Add hallucinations and visual physical distortion elements to eventually distort the player into a mimic as their exposure to distortion effects increases. 

This is a repost of my own from 8 months ago, but I figured there’s nothing to lose by bumping the idea because I still think it’s a real good one. 

I can tell I've been playing the game a lot because I'm dreaming about it. I was dreaming about being in the Radius last night, but I think there were some crossed wires because I was encountering some pockets of radiation out in the wilderness. The mechanics I interacted with to deal with it were pretty much lifted straight from the S.T.A.L.K.E.R. franchise, specifically equipping a gas mask (or ADH, same function in the dream), and drinking vodka and smoking cigarettes. Waking up I realized there could be value in a secondary damage mechanic like radiation poisoning, albeit more in-line with ITR lore. Given that distortion as a concept is front and center in how the Radius presents itself and affects the environment of Perchorsk, what if there were a player distortion mechanic?

Instead of simply dropping dead when your ADH juice runs out, you begin experiencing the effects of distortion, to varying degrees. I'm not exactly sure what that looks like, but to spitball, perhaps it starts subtle with an altered time scale, missing armor values or reduced movement speed. Some minor debuff that might even be subtle enough to go unnoticed. As distortion advances, you start experiencing like simulated amnesia, where gear on your vest moves to different slots or even to your backpack, disrupting your muscle memory. Maybe your vision is randomly affected. You start encountering enemy spawns that aren't really there, dealing no damage and spawning in groups to waste your ammo and force you to question which threats are worth confronting. Maybe just before succumbing to distortion your body physically alters in some way (extra fingers or hands, mimic style?) or you hear yourself start to spout mimic lines while your health slowly ticks down. Perhaps enemies cease to attack you, seeing you as just another agent of the Radius (Could be potentially really fun as a high-risk/reward gambit?)

Ways to mitigate the effects would be consumables which irl provide some sort of altered mind state, however subtle. I know alcohol isn't in the game and its addition would raise questions with the ESRB and PEGI, but cigarettes [or cigars (OH PLEASE CMG)], coffee, or just some kind of designated pharmaceutical. The key (in my head at least), is that these simply treat the symptoms of distortion, not the distortion itself. The only way distortion truly recedes is by leaving the exclusion zone, i.e. returning to Facility #27 to see whatever effects rapidly and permanently diminish, until you venture forth once again and come across sources of distortion (perhaps even aside from distortion zones?) in the EZ.

I admit this is a lot, and probably too much to implement to the degree of the vision I have for the mechanic, but I thought given the (outstanding!) community involvement CMG have shown, it'd be worth sharing. I hope at the very least folks might enjoy daydreaming along with me here.",1,1767970586.0,intotheradius,0,0.67,False

If your idea of ""high-stakes gameplay"" is trying to finish a cargo run before you hear footsteps coming down the hall, then you might be in the right place.

We're a small but growing community of gamers, mostly dads, who love Star Citizen but have accepted that our reaction times have been nerfed by sleep deprivation. We've built a casual, no-pressure environment for people who have jobs, families, and other real-life commitments that always take priority.

**Who are we?**

We're an organization and Discord community built on the simple principle that gaming should be a relaxing escape, not another source of stress. We get that you might have to go AFK with zero notice because a kid is awake, the dog just threw up, or your spouse is giving you *the look*. No one will ever give you grief for it here.

**What we do in Star Citizen:**

* **Everything, slowly:** Industrial runs (mining/salvage), bounty hunting, bunkers, exploration, and the occasional ""let's see if we can land three Rocs in a C2 without everything exploding"" shenanigans.
* **Helping New Players:** The 'verse is confusing. We're happy to show you the ropes without any pressure.
* **Group Events (that are 100% optional):** We'll try to get together for things like Jumptown or Xenothreat when it aligns with our schedules, but there are no mandatory ops. Ever.

**Who we're looking for:**

You're probably a great fit if:

* You're a parent or just someone with a busy adult life.
* Your prime gaming hours are late in the evening.
* You want a chill, mature group to hang out with and talk about games, dad jokes, and whatever else comes up.
* You're looking for a group that values teamwork and fun over hardcore min/maxing.

Our Discord server is active for Star Citizen, but we play other games too. It's become a solid place for like-minded people to just connect and decompress.

**Requirements:**

* Be a decent human being. No drama, no toxicity.
* Have a mic for comms.
* Patience. Both for the game and for your fellow org mates who might have just spilled coffee on their keyboard.

If this sounds like your speed, come say hello in our Discord and see if it's a good fit.

(one photo attached),"My girlfriend of 1 year is a flight attendent, we had a argument one night and the next day she was on a work shift for 3 days. I could tell certain little things did not add up which led to me confronting her. She lied and lied until eventually when I said something like ""but I could understand if you lied because we got in an argument and I would understand if you needed space"", then finally she admitted that yes she lied to me about going to work because she wanted space. She said that she ran errands, hung out with a couple whom I've met, and took a train into the city to see an old friend to get her laptop fixed.(who is a guy)

Most of her guy friends are past hookups so I asked about the old friend and it was a dude  named Brandon and I never heard her mention that name before.

She initiated contact with him, asked if he was available the next 2 days and then insinuated that we broke up when we didnt? Her last instagram post from 2 weeks ago is a picture of us together, and its still up even now, so this guy Brandon would have seen that picture.

It looks so obvious but the reason why I have doubt that she cheated is because:

1. She admitted she went to the city to see this guy when she really didn't have to, I never would have guessed that she went to the city or that this guy brandon would ever have existed ( she even has stated that she now regrets telling me this detail because its going to rummage through my head)

2. Her laptop being broken was a topic of discussion in the past and that ""an old friend that lives in the city"" gave it to her( thats all I ever knew about this guy)

3. She showed me the text messages. (even though she technically had a 30second window to delete some texts if she wanted to, I have no idea if she did though)

4. Aside from the photo there is literally nothing else suspicious about her text convo, the guy even talked about a girl he went on a date with

When i revealed i checked her phone and told her what i found, she was adamant that they are just friends, and not romantically attracted to eachother anymore. 

She said that this date was not a big deal at all to her, but after hearing my thoughts about it she apologized and told me she will communicate better next time. 

I feel like the lack of communication with me about this is a dealbreaker. And although she says she wants to do better, i’m not sure if i want to give her a second chance as this feels like such a basic and straightforward thing to communicate clearly about if our relationship is good.

I’m posting because I feel completely out of my depth and honestly quite scared and so so tired. 
My mother-in-law has advanced, inoperable glioblastoma that was diagnosed in July 25. She's had five rounds of chemo and has steadily declined with the most obvious symptom being her memory. 

Over the last few weeks, things have changed rapidly, and we’ve entered a phase that feels relentless and unbearable to live inside.

She is awake a lot but some days naps and constantly talking, but none of it makes sense anymore. It’s not conversation, it’s looping phrases, polite scripts, names of loved ones, and repeated pleas. She talks to people who aren’t there and we don't know who she's talking to, she asks for coffee constantly, even when she’s just had one, and becomes distressed if it’s not exactly right. 

Even when we respond, the relief lasts seconds at best.

She needs almost constant verbal acknowledgement to stay calm, but responding fully just fuels the loop. If we don’t respond enough, she becomes upset or angry. It feels like there is no “right” way to be with her anymore.

Her cognition has declined further:
– she no longer uses cutlery and eats with her hands
– she misjudges space and objects and we think her eyesight has pretty much gone
– she recently tried to drink from her hand, believing it was a cup
– her speech is mostly nonsensical now
– she wakes multiple times a night and often needs reassurance and is unable to walk unadided
She still eats well, still asks for coffee, still wants connection but nothing seems to settle her for long. The nights are brutal. We’re getting up five or more times a night.

At the same time, my wife and I are caring for our one-year-old, trying to keep our jobs, and holding the household together. We’ve been sharing full-time care for months with her sister that lives several hours away sort of on a week on week off system. This stage feels like pure endurance with no rhythm and no relief.

Hospice are in contact but say she’s “too well” for full hospice care right now, so we’re being directed toward social care, even though her needs feel overwhelming. We’re trying to put support in place, but in the meantime we’re exhausted and struggling.
We all love her deeply, and I hate admitting this, but the relentlessness is breaking us. I don’t want her to be frightened or distressed like this, and I don’t know how long this particular phase usually lasts or what comes next.

If you’ve been through this stag, the constant chatter, the loops, the lack of rest — I’d really appreciate hearing:
 • how long this phase lasted for you
• what helped even a little
• how you coped as carers
 I’m just trying to survive this part and do right by her without losing ourselves.

1q8a50p,https://www.reddit.com/r/london/comments/1q8a50p/leaving_london/,Leaving London,"Context: Moved into this flat in the August with my partner. Since then he's been really unwell and we have concluded this is down to burnout/stress. It's been really difficult for our relationship, since we've just moved in together and what was meant to be an exciting time has been clouded a lot by his health struggles and low mood. He's in the office full time, whilst my job is a bit more flexible. Whilst he says his job doesn't cause him stress and likes it, I think he's generally struggling to cope day to day with life in general. I like my job too, but I have a lot more flexibility on where I can be. He earns significantly more than me, so that is also to be factored in in terms of lifestyle consideration. (Joint income c. £180k p/a)

At the same time, I've had a lot of recent life shifts, looking at my friendships (mostly in London) very differently, feeling detached, like I'm not part of that childhood group anymore and feeling that an internal shift is happening but being unable to name it fully. My mental health has deteriorated significantly since moving in here. I've never fully felt at home in this flat, my view outside is literally a brick wall and the area has nothing to offer. I've been struggling to cope with the emotional load of trying to support a sick partner and just don't even know where to go with that. We're really trying to navigate this difficult period, on top of all my friendships changing and significant fallouts, plus some very devastating family health news. Not only that, this flat is insanely expensive for what it is and I'm struggling to see a way out. It's been the straw that's breaking the camel's back.

There is nowhere for me to go in this neighbourhood to just nip for a coffee or work from a nice cafe. I've been trying to re-think what would be the best option over and over, for weeks on end ruminating and it's driving me insane that I can't find a conclusion. I don't know whether London and the lifestyle is draining. I don't want to just ditch London because I'm in a negative phase, but I've moved about five times since living here and I'm a bit done with it at the same time. It was exciting when I was here in my 20's, but now the social life has reduced I'm struggling to see the meaning to it. Especially since both of us are miserable and my life no longer revolves around alcohol.

We considered moving perhaps to the outskirts, but I don't see the point in this - we'd have no friends and family there and the cost benefit seems minimal to me. We considered moving back up north to be closer to family, but this also feels like a step back and we're not ready for kids or settling down yet, especially with how our relationship is at the moment.

I'm feeling really stuck and would appreciate any help. Have you been in this position? Did you end up moving out of London? Where did you go and was it a good decision?",6,1767969992.0,london,15,0.62,False

**Assembling trouble-free**

Everything went smoothly thanks to Larry Lyells' excellent instructions in the SPT Journal on the F4. 

When installing the rewind motor, I had to try a few times before it fit; the unit can only be inserted into the bottom of the housing, wind side, at a certain angle. 

The rewind-coupling shaft, which connects the rewind motor vertically to the film advance unit, proved to be a test of patience. It has to be coupled with the shaft and gears of the rewind motor. But after a few attempts, it worked. 

As a precaution, I oiled the notorious ratchet wheel in the aperture control. This prevents problems when forming the small apertures.

**Power supply issue resolved, the F4 works**

When I had finished assembling the F4, except for the rubber covers and decorative caps, and switched it on, nothing happened. No viewfinder display, no shutter release. 

Cleaning the battery contacts didn't change anything, so I thought about where I might have made a mistake when assembling the electronic part. 

While checking the circuit board on the underside of the camera, I discovered a crushed cable; I probably hadn't been careful when attaching the front plate to the housing. I covered the cable with insulating tape because the insulation was damaged. But that wasn't the cause of the problem either. 

So I went through the troubleshooting instructions in the SPT Journal. It is recommended to connect an external power source to rule out problems with the battery holder. And with 6 volts from my lab power supply, the F4 came to life. I thoroughly cleaned all the battery contacts again, and then the battery holder worked. All the F4's functions were available. 

**Check with the camera tester; the fast shutter speeds are not being set correctly**

I then checked the shutter with the camera tester. Unfortunately, the curtain travel times were different again; the camera tester only displayed values from 1/2000 second onwards, meaning that the condition is worse than before. 

I can only conclude that the shutter is defective. Perhaps the movement of the shutter blades is impaired or the control mechanism is faulty, which is noticeable at short speeds. It could also be that the shutter magnets are contaminated and no longer separate properly. A cleaning attempt would be possible here.

**DIY has its limits when it comes to repairing high-performance shutters**

The curtains travel times can still be adjusted with some effort using the camera tester. 

However, the shutter speeds can only be measured when the shutter is installed in the camera. And to do that, the F4 has to be completely reassembled in order to test it. And then it has to be taken apart again to work on the shutter. That's not a practical solution.

This is probably also the reason why these shutters were replaced as a complete unit when they malfunctioned. Repairing the complicated shutter control system would have been uneconomical.

**Conclusion**

1. Unfortunately I was unable to improve the short shutter speeds; adjusting the curtain travel times did not solve the problem.

2. Cleaning the shutter magnets would be worth a try. However, this would require dismantling and reassembling the F4 again. With an uncertain outcome

3. I am putting this project on hold and will look for a working shutter as a replacement.

4. Overall, it was good practice and I learned something new.

5. In any case, it's time for a sip of strong coffee now 😉

\+++

I'll continue once I've found a replacement for the shutter.

Thank you for your interest! 🙂

Former intelligence officer Roman Chervinskyi stated that the former head of the Presidential Office, Andriy Yermak, was enrolled as a staff member of the Foreign Intelligence Service.

As Censor.NET reports, he revealed this in an interview with journalist Lena Chychenina.

Chervinskyi confirmed Yermak’s visit to the office of Ukraine’s Foreign Intelligence Service on December 5 and said that after this visit, the head of the Foreign Intelligence Service of Ukraine, Oleh Ivashchenko, i.e., the current head of the HUR, summoned the head of the department responsible for cover documents and tasked him with bringing Yermak onto the staff of the Foreign Intelligence Service.

Unlike standard packaging formats, custom flexible bags are designed specifically to match a product’s size, functionality, and branding requirements. These bags are widely used across industries such as food and beverage, pharmaceuticals, cosmetics, pet food, and household products. With growing competition on retail shelves and online marketplaces, custom flexible packaging bags offer businesses the ability to stand out while ensuring their products remain fresh, safe, and convenient for consumers.

One of the most significant advantages of [custom flexible packaging bags](https://qiyupack.com/flexible-packaging/) is their ability to provide tailored protection for different products. By selecting appropriate materials and multi-layer structures, manufacturers can create packaging that offers precise barrier properties against moisture, oxygen, light, and contaminants. This customization helps extend shelf life and preserve product quality, particularly for sensitive items like snacks, coffee, powders, and medical products. Functional features such as resealable zippers, tear notches, spouts, and valves can be integrated based on product needs, improving usability and reducing waste for end users.

Branding and design flexibility are key drivers behind the popularity of custom flexible packaging bags. These bags offer a large, printable surface area that supports high-quality graphics, bold colors, and detailed product information. Advanced printing technologies allow brands to create visually striking designs that communicate their story, values, and unique selling points. Custom shapes, sizes, and finishes—such as matte, gloss, or soft-touch coatings—further enhance shelf appeal. For e-commerce and direct-to-consumer brands, custom packaging bags also contribute to a memorable unboxing experience, strengthening customer loyalty and brand recognition.

Cost efficiency and logistical benefits make custom flexible packaging bags a practical choice for businesses of all sizes. Compared to rigid packaging options like jars, bottles, or cans, flexible bags require less material and occupy less space during transportation and storage. This results in lower shipping costs, reduced carbon emissions, and improved supply chain efficiency. Customization also allows brands to optimize bag dimensions to minimize excess packaging, further reducing material usage and costs. With modern manufacturing capabilities, custom flexible packaging can be produced in both small and large quantities, supporting startups as well as established brands.

Sustainability and innovation are shaping the future of custom flexible packaging bags. As consumers and regulators demand more environmentally responsible solutions, packaging manufacturers are developing recyclable, mono-material, biodegradable, and compostable bag options. Custom designs can incorporate sustainable materials, downgauged structures, and post-consumer recycled content without compromising performance. In addition, smart packaging features such as QR codes, traceability elements, and interactive designs are becoming increasingly common. By combining customization, sustainability, and advanced functionality, custom flexible packaging bags empower brands to meet modern market demands while delivering practical, attractive, and responsible packaging solutions.E",1,1767969806.0,u_Farhanamili,0,1.0,False

We are in an ldr relationship as I decided to go out of town for college whole she stays in our hometown. My Christmas break is not yet over as january has  a big religious celebration in the town my college is located thus cancelling classes. (I live in a very religious and cultural country). In my hometown the classes here are resumed. So this afternoon I went to her campus outside as she has vacant hours and we got into a fight mainly because we are hungry. I asked her if there is a street food but she said no and made a snag comment about I was the only one who is supposed to eat. (for context she doesn’t eat streetfood). We got pretty tense and she said we’d go to a coffee shop but the shortcut means i have to go inside her campus. I got pissed how i really domt want to enter as the security guard wouldnt allow me and i have to lie which is exhausting. She became angry and as we are walking she shoved me by the neck in a freshly painted wall. I then pinched her hard and she pinched me back. I pinshed her again a little harder now this time. We are fighting and walking she’s silent but i am not and then choke me in the side walk. I punched hr in the back and in the boobs and we js got heated up. She then pushed me so hard and hard hard and choked me. Mind u she’s stronger. I went home and didnt continue to go to the coffee sho because this was the first time she ever did. I admit we get physical sometimes when we are fighting but js alone in a private space and its mostly equal forces basically being abusive equally lol. I kinda admit my fault as I was ranting about how stupid she is to invite me to meet up in her campus and then go to a coffee shop away from the campus when we couldve meet up there and spare each other’s time and effort. I’d commute to there and she will too. I also talked how she only wants convenience as she cancelled our agreement that she was supposed to go my house (her reason was valid). I was at fault there. Anyways i was hurt that she physically attacked me in public and i was humiliated but this is the first time she did this and she mostly calms her anger before she even get too much.

1q89ydd,https://www.reddit.com/r/hackintosh/comments/1q89ydd/acer_laptop_i59300h_uhd_630_stuck_in_recovery_os/,"Acer laptop (i5-9300H, UHD 630) stuck in recovery OS – extremely long delay at Apple logo + progress bar","I am attempting to run macOS Sequoia 15.4 on an Acer laptop (i5-9300H Coffee Lake Refresh + UHD Graphics 630) using **OpenCore 1.0.6**.

After numerous fixes (GPU framebuffer patching, I2C polling, npci quirk, etc.), the system now successfully reaches the graphical phase during recovery boot, but becomes stuck for extremely long periods (30–60+ minutes with no visible progress).



**Two distinct behaviors depending on whether verbose mode is enabled:**

**1. With \`-v\` (verbose mode enabled):**

    - Verbose text continues scrolling for a long time
    - Eventually stalls/repeats heavily around loginwindow initialization, spawning applekeystored, xpcproxy, etc.
    - Shows many repeated (apparently harmless) messages such as:
      - `shared_region ... check_np(...) vm_shared_region_start_address() failed`
      - `Forcing CS_RUNTIME for hardened entitlement`
      - `The HidUntilCheckIn property is an architectural performance issue and is inherently inefficient`



**2. Without \`-v\` (graphical boot):**

\- Quickly reaches the classic Apple logo + progress bar screen

\- The progress bar appears but then essentially freezes (or moves so slowly that it appears frozen)

\- No kernel panic, no reboot – just stuck indefinitely (tested waiting over 60 minutes)



**Current boot-args (without -v):**

    keepsyms=1 debug=0x100 alcid=29 -igfxvesa -wegnoegpu -lilubetaall -vi2c-force-polling npci=0x3000



    Framebuffer device properties (PciRoot(0x0)/Pci(0x2,0x0)):
    - `AAPL,ig-platform-id`: `070009B3E`
    - `framebuffer-patch-enable`: `010000000`
    - `framebuffer-stolenmem`: `00003001`
    - `framebuffer-fbmem`: `000009000`



**What I have already tried:**

    - Both `npci=0x2000` and `npci=0x3000`
    - `-igfxmlr`
    - Keeping / removing `-igfxvesa`
    - Waiting extremely long periods in both modes
    - Latest WhateverGreen + Lilu
    - BIOS updated + Above 4G Decoding disabled



The system clearly succeeds in reaching the graphical handover stage, which is already major progress compared to earlier kernel/PCI hangs.

1q89xpn,https://www.reddit.com/r/RantAndVentPH/comments/1q89xpn/the_girl_i_met_in_fairview/,The girl I met in Fairview,"I met this girl from Reddit, and nagkita kami. Sa post niya, she made it clear na she’s not ready for a relationship, emotionally unavailable daw siya. Despite that, I booked a staycation for us. It was like a fantasy, typical na nagmamahalan sa staycation. Tinulungan ko siya sa exams niya, cooked for her, and made her feel safe.

Fast forward, we started catching feelings for each other. Nafall ako sa kanya. Oo, aware ako na malulugi ako if I catch feelings, but bawal ba? Bawal na ba magsabi ng nararamdaman ko? Confusing din sa part niya kasi hindi niya sinasabi kung ano talaga ang gusto niya.

Oo, na-fall ako sa kanya because she’s the type of person I could imagine spending my life with, even though we’ve only known each other for more than a month. Still, I tried my best to be around her and understand her.

Palagi niyang sinasabi na baka iwan ko raw siya. I live in Mindanao, siya naman sa QC. I told her, “Hintayin mo ako for one year.” Magkukuha lang ako ng experience doon (nurse ako), then after that babalik ako ng Manila for my German studies. Doon na sana kami magkasama. She promised me that she would wait for a year.

She shared her dreams, gusto niyang magkaroon ng coffee shop since she’s a barista sa isang café. I promised her that we would build that coffee shop together. But all those promises broke in a minute, for such a petty reason, hindi ko lang siya na-update ng isang gabi. Promises really are made to be broken.

After three days of no contact, ginawa ko na lahat. I said sorry, asked for updates, and questioned myself kung deserve ko ba itong silent treatment. I told her that whatever her decision is, I’ll respect it. Then the following day, you unfriended me on social media, deleted our chats, and bigla ka na lang nawala.

Ganon na ba talaga ang mga avoidant? I saw you commenting on other girls’ posts like, “Sa akin yan lahat?” Hindi ko alam kung friendly lang ba or what. Nasasaktan ako kasi iniwan mo ako nang walang sagot, no explanations, nothing. It was clear avoidant behavior, at naghanap ka ng iba. Aminado ka naman na dismissive avoidant ka at nagde-detach ka during relationships.

Wala naman tayong label or anything, but it feels like I was left behind, broken, frustrated, and sad. Pinalit ako agad, na wala man lang akong kaalam-alam. Ang bilis. Sobrang bilis. I felt betrayed, like ginamit lang ako for a good time. Nakita ko reposts mo, ready na ready ka makipaglandi sa iba, habang sa akin hindi. So ano ba talaga tayo? It really makes me sad.

Pursigido na sana akong hintayin ka. Pursigido akong sabayan ang pangarap mo habang tinutupad ko rin ang akin. I was so willing to give my all, everything, but bigla mo na lang sinira lahat. I don’t know if I should still wait for your chat, but I guess you’ve already moved on and wala ka na talagang pake sa akin. It’s just a sad reality.

I thought I was going to be happy. I won’t deny it, I dearly miss her. And for a short moment of time, sana nasabi ko sa’yo kung gaano kita kamahal habang hawak-hawak mo ang kamay ko sa bus, habang nagko-commute tayo papuntang Fairview",0,1767969514.0,RantAndVentPH,2,0.5,False

Every day I leave the house and take two buses to work with an open mason jar of coffee. Sometimes with a glass straw. Here's my math:
Am I wearing a lippie? Yes = straw
Am I rushing to the bus? Yes = should have a straw to sip

Sometimes I still forget a straw so I stop dramatically as I go to the bus to sip. Im a queen.

I like the mason jars because I hate micro plastics, and I sometimes use a lid but honestly I just grab it and forget a lot of the time. Logically I should do it more.

Divorced mother of 4 adult children, ranging from 24-35. She never dated again after the divorce and idk why. She just had this poor view of marriage now, I think due to the physical and verbal abuse she endured during her marriage. But she denied that it was abuse for SO many years. I think now that she’s getting older, she realizes it was abuse. 

The thought of marriage gives her the ick. The thought of “a man living with her or sleeping next to her” gives her the ick. It’s all a facade, because I notice the romantic, sad movies she always chooses to watch on TV. I notice she compares herself to other women. I know she has many regrets, as she has admitted this recently, but I’m sure one of them is not going out with others and going out to date. 

I *know* she wants to be loved again, I mean, it’s human to want this. We want her to try to date but I think she’s so self-conscious of herself, which includes her looks and her weight. She’s not unattractive and she’s not morbidly obese. She is overweight, but her labs reflect a healthy lifestyle. Her eating habits are very good and will snack once in a while, although she believes she has an unhealthy diet.

She refused to go to therapy. I think there’s fear based, somewhere going on in her mind. She won’t say why she won’t go. She always says “next year” or “let me grieve my mom” or “let me grieve my brother.” My grandma passed away over a year ago and my uncle passed two months ago. She will just watch TikTok during her free time or watch tv. She will go to the bookstore often in her free time, buy coffee there, shopping, basic stuff. 

She has no friends and this is because they’ve all drifted apart when she started caring for my grandparents since 2012 up until they passed away. She regrets this. My grandma depended on her way too much and it was so bad towards the end of her life (dementia). 

I really wished my mom would have set boundaries with my grandma, and lived the life her inner child dreamed of. But she’s still so young, and I want her to live the reminding years of her life with happiness and fulfillment. But she just won’t do anything more than her comfort zone…",12,1767969461.0,Aging,40,0.88,False

My daily routine is peak Bangalore NPC life:
office → traffic → gym (pretend) → home → overthinking like it’s my side hustle.
Meanwhile my friends are jumping levels:
first date → relationship → engagement → shaadi invite with Google Form.

Dating apps deserve their own Netflix documentary.
You swipe.
You match.
You talk nicely.
Then suddenly they vanish like autos when you say “Electronic City”.
At this point I think the apps are just testing my patience for future life problems.

I don’t drink, don’t club. Loud pubs make me question my life choices in Dolby Surround Sound. I’m a quiet café, walks, long conversations, and “wow why is this coffee ₹280?” type of guy.

But someone please explain — WHERE ARE THESE PEOPLE HIDING?
Every calm café I go to turns into:
• one loud office team outing
• one birthday with balloons
• one guy pitching a startup to a girl who clearly didn’t ask

I’m just sitting there like an unpaid extra.

Girls of Bangalore (and fellow confused humans), is dating here genuinely this hard or are we all just tired, introverted, and pretending we’re busy?
How are normal, low-drama people meeting each other in this city without becoming social butterflies overnight?

Not sad. Not desperate. Just confused, funny (I think), and wondering if my dating feature is still in beta version.
Please comment so I know I’m not alone in this multiplayer game playing solo. 😭😄

I have to work more than others in order to be seen and acknowledged, first 20 years was the outcast in almost every circle.

Time passes - I try to change, but one thing never changes, it is that women always avoid me. Like literally, avoid talking, interacting, sitting next to on the bus, even looking in my direction. That is apart those who know me, like work environment, acquaintances through friends, like their girlfriends etc. I never even cross any boundary, like I got so used to this social treatment that whenever I have girls next to me in a place, I only talk with them about the minimum required, that is the task at hand.

I have been told in the past that I look intimidating and judging, but I just had a kind of rough life. I am emotional and cherish relationships, but there's been betrayal, being used, family with issues and so on. At this point in the outside world I avoid them all as much as possible because I feel like I have a big tag on my head saying creep, danger or whatever else.

There has been only one female friend I got through the sports club 2 years ago. Eventually I caught feelings because I only do for those who I know more of, not strangers. I let her know, she said no, I took it and moved on. We still talk sometimes but little because that's just how she has always been.

I decided to finally try dating apps cuz my friends and their girlfriends say I look good and am a good person etc. like why not give it a shot. I went for everything cuz I had some time during holidays, Hinge, Tinder, Breeze, Boo etc. all free version cuz screw paying for that.

The overall best interactions were not even related to dating, they were some looking for friends, looking for party members for games etc. Or just complimenting my hat, which I found surprising.

The fact itself that in a couple weeks I had matches was surprising to say the least. Regardless most of them were going cold after a couple texts so whatever. But suddenly there is one girl that just likes one of my pictures on Hinge and no message.

I reply with something quircky as a joke and she replies back matching the vibe. We then talk for the next week, and both of us write a lot. I tell her I would like to meet in person, because the conversation has been enjoyable. She replies with sure but when schedules meet because she's busy and needs to look for a free day. I accept it and we keep chatting the second week about other things getting to know about each other.

She seemed to be very invested, I was even thinking if this is real like come on, it can't be right? I won't go into details but it's all just very sweet topics, friendly banter and no filth.

Then yesterday she doesn't reply for a day. The tempo was about 1 large combination of messages from both of us per day. I monitor notifications because me being me i am becoming emotionally invested and want this to move forward. And I see that she unmatched me. I got so angry I was feeling like my head is going to explode, even now I am raging inside. Like, just... not the type where you'd do something bad, just the type where I feel like a decaying nuclear reactor, leave me to myself and I want to just burn to dust and be gone.

Just tell me you're no longer interested or that I messed up something or I'm just ugly and you no longer like me or you hate me now, SOMETHING PLEASE.

I don't understand what's wrong with me, why can't I ever get close to anyone romantically. It feels like I am in the Truman show but it's a comedy and life is just laughing at me. Giving me hope and then taking it away when it has played enough with me.

I paused my profiles and will stop looking at others now because it's too hurtful and exhaustive because guys are the ones who need to put the most effort in at first. When they go cold at the beginning that's fine, whatever. I was hoping that if I ever get to talk with someone for a bit and we both seem invested then at least we could have a coffee chat.

I am not going to blame her or hate her, but I feel betrayed. I don't know what to believe in anymore. I can understand bad relationships and how they form, you know the type where they break up constantly, never discuss their problems etc. I want something normal, kind and meaningful. I don't understand anymore how do other people ever get in such a place at all. I am involuntarily getting to believe that women just don't actually need guys anyways, it's all a game for funsies. Like when you buy a new weird toy, you play with it for a bit and then get bored and don't really need it anymore.

I am sorry for the wall of text but I need to vent because I always keep my shit to myself cuz no one else cares, even friends, like how long can you keep bothering them with your own bs. I feel like exploding and I am doing it through words here.",1,1767969301.0,Vent,1,1.0,False

Around age 11, my once healthy daughter began to show signs of several mental health problems. Current issues: MDD, OCD (intrusive thoughts), anorexia, chronic suicidality and finally BPD. She also has level 1 autism.  For these problems she has been in medical and psychiatric hospitals, residential treatment, PHP, 2x weekly 1:1 DBT, CBT and has had TMS treatment. None of it has worked. 

Dominant BPD traits are Identity Diffusion/Unstable Identity, rejection sensitivity and self harm (plus all the other traits to a lesser degree)

Despite all of this, I have tried to make her life as fun and enjoyable as possible, always catering to her needs and interest, prioritizing her in every concievable way. Her father and I are divorced and while he's been on a pedestal for years, he has contributed next to nothing to her overall wellbeing and is a major source of her abandonment trauma. Therapists, etc. have refused to hear my pleas for her to deal with her dad issues. I made a last-ditch effort to center these issues prior to her 18th birthday. 

She turned 18 recently, and less than a week later was in the hospital for SI. She called her father to take her to the ED and that is the last communication we had. She did not sign off on me getting updates from the psych hosptial that took her (2+ weeks) and was released to her father, who has not shared anything. (The most time she and dad have spent together in the last 3 years was a once weekly coffee date for 45 min.)

She will not be getting the treatment she needs and I am completely shut out. We went from spending ALLLLLLLLL of our time together to absolute radio silence for the last 17 days.

Even though she is cold and unkind to me most of the time, all I can think about are the happy times, inside jokes, etc. I am unmoored by this - and the mom instinct to protect her is still so real.

And now... **The NAUGHTY List** -  Let's face it. This is why you are really reading this.  What horrible things did the local inspectors find this week?  I've arbitrarily chosen 35 demerits as the cutoff so anyone that gets less than 35 demerits isn't going to make the list.  I don't want to ding a place unless they got at least a couple major violations or a lot of minor ones.

1q89srb,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/1q89srb/advice_for_first_date_in_almost_20_years/,Advice for first date in almost 20 years,"So I met a woman through an interesting series of events but we haven’t actually met in person yet. We’ve been talking through text for the better part of three weeks now. I asked her if she wanted to go out for coffee and dinner a few days again and she said yes. Confirmed last night. We are meeting up this afternoon.

I guess as someone who has been out of the dating pool for a long time I’m just asking for suggestions on things to say (or not to say) and how to not seem boring. I’ve been mainly talking to my children and other parents for the last few years and I obviously want to avoid blathering about my children the whole date. I would just appreciate some general advice cause I feel like a 16 year old in my mid 40’s figuring it out all out again lol. Sorry I know that’s super ambiguous but dating information is so overwhelming if you just google it.

Oh and I have a female friend who says I messed up by letting her pick where we are going instead of taking the lead. She lives a bit of a drive for me and when I asked her out on our date I told her I would come to her and she offered to pick a place. Should I try to change that or just let it ride? I feel like it would be foolish to try and take charge of it suddenly but my friend is insisting I should.

I am 44 and she’s 40. Thank you so much in advance for anyone that can help me out. I was in a relationship for 18 years and married for 10 of them. So it’s been a long time.",1,1767969181.0,dating_advice,1,1.0,False

I have a 16 year old brother who is addicted to his computer/phone. He plays war thunder all day, spends all his pocket money on it, and does nothing else. Our poor mother's nerves are frayed because he often talks back, never cleans, leaves food all over his room, and never helps.

I moved out last year so i can't have any direct continous influence on him. I also work and have university, internships, etc...

He is in high school right now, studying engineering/electrical engineering.

His grades are bad, he mostly brings home good grades from classes that have absolutely 0 influence in what university he will get in.

I sat him down multiple times, told him to call me if he needs anything, i told him he can come or even sleep over anytime... i gave him money so he could sit in a coffee shop and study there which he did twice then never again (he asked to do this). At this point i don't know what else to do.

When we are studying, he jokes all the time, is on his phone, or simply doesn't care.
At home, he doesn't study by himself at all.
He himself came to me for help with astudying but then he does nothing no matter what i do.

I'm more than reasonable, i listen to him, i don't just tell him to study we actually go through not only his school stuff, but we also talk about teachers, exams, etc... He often complains that his teachers are unfair, and fuck of course they are, i see that and i tell him that yes their actions are unfair but that also you saying thia to me will change nothing, the teacher won't magically change because you defy him, you are ruining your own studies because instead of studying, you are complaining.

My mother works and is very burnt out, she cannot bw dealing with my brother because trust me dealing with him is nearly impossible.

I'm afraid he will fall behind and become someone that he himself would hate to be.

Fortunately he is safe from mysogynistic/racist/incel type behavior/thinking, he himself told me that he hates those.

He *is* very intelligent, when i talk to him and he isn't joking away everything/is uncaring, it is clear that he has a brain. But he is so brainrotted and uncaring that it's impossible to get through to him.",1,1767969128.0,LifeAdvice,1,1.0,False

1q89qf8,https://www.reddit.com/r/Wordpress/comments/1q89qf8/5_wpcli_commands_that_save_me_10_hours_a_month/,5 WP-CLI commands that save me 10+ hours a month (and why you should stop using the dashboard),"When I first started with WordPress, I did everything inside `wp-admin`. Installing plugins, updating settings, creating users—it was all point-and-click.

But when I started managing larger, mission-critical sites, the dashboard became a bottleneck. It’s slow, it times out on heavy tasks, and honestly, clicking through menus breaks my flow state.

Learning **WP-CLI** (Command Line Interface) wasn't just a ""nerdy"" upgrade for me; it was the biggest productivity jump in my career. I treat the Dashboard as a space for **Content Editors**, and the Terminal as the space for **Developers**.

Here are the 5 commands I use almost daily that keep my workflow efficient.

# 1. The Migration Savior: wp search-replace

If you’ve ever migrated a site and broken all the images because you did a manual SQL find/replace, you know the pain. WordPress stores data as serialized arrays; standard SQL queries break them.

I never touch a migration plugin for this anymore. I pull the database down and run:

`wp search-replace 'https://production-site.com' 'http://localhost.test' --all-tables`

It handles the serialization perfectly, it’s instant, and it never times out.

# 2. The ""White Screen"" Fix: wp plugin deactivate

We've all been there: You activate a plugin, the site crashes, and you can't access `wp-admin` to turn it off. The old ""FTP in and rename the folder"" trick is slow and messy.

Instead, I just SSH in and run: `wp plugin deactivate --all` *or if I know the culprit:* `wp plugin deactivate buggy-plugin-slug`

Site comes back up instantly.

# 3. The Server Saver: wp media regenerate

Changing image sizes in your theme? If you try to use a ""Regenerate Thumbnails"" plugin on a site with 10,000 images, the PHP process will almost certainly time out or crash the browser.

CLI runs at the server level, bypassing browser timeouts: `wp media regenerate --yes`

I set this running in a background tab and go grab a coffee. It never fails.

# 4. The ""I'm Locked Out"" Fix: wp user create

Sometimes I inherit a site, or a client forgets their password, or emails aren't sending. Instead of messing with phpMyAdmin to hack the database user table, I create a backdoor admin in 2 seconds:

`wp user create myadmin` [`myemail@example.com`](mailto:myemail@example.com) `--role=administrator --user_pass=securepassword`

# 5. The Sanity Check: wp cache flush

When I’m deploying code or debugging a weird issue where ""it works on my machine but not on prod,"" 90% of the time it’s the object cache (Redis/Memcached).

I don't hunt for the ""Clear Cache"" button in the admin bar. `wp cache flush`

It clears the object cache immediately. It’s muscle memory for me now before I start debugging anything.

**My advice:** You don't need to be a Linux sysadmin to use this. If you can type `cd` and `ls`, you can use WP-CLI. Start with `wp plugin list` and go from there.

**For the other devs here:** Do you have any custom WP-CLI aliases or scripts you swear by? I’m always looking to optimize further.",32,1767969024.0,Wordpress,21,0.81,False

1q89q2d,https://cognitivewonderland.substack.com/p/bad-coffee-and-the-meaning-of-rationality,Bad Coffee and the Meaning of Rationality,"This article talks about rationality as a framework, drawing on a bunch of Loewenstein research. One difficulty with calling certain behaviors, like playing the lottery, irrational is that it assumes what the person is trying to maximize (for example, expected monetary value). But we can take into account internal factors (the value of getting to dream about winning the lottery). But it isn't clear where to draw the line -- if we include all internal factors, it seems we lose the ability to call anything rational. But if we don't include clearly relevant factors, we lose the value of normative frameworks.

""Normative frameworks might never capture the full complexity of human psychology. There are enough degrees of freedom that it’s hard to ever know for sure any action is strictly irrational. But maybe that’s okay—maybe the point of these frameworks is to give us tools for thinking and to improve our own reasoning about our preferences, rather than some ultimate arbiter of what is or is not rational.""",1,1767969001.0,BehavioralEconomics,0,1.0,False

I (24m) was working from home and throughout my day I liked to have a few coffees to keep me going. I decided to have an extra one as a treat before heading to the gym.

At the gym, my friend was running late so I decided to get myself the pre workout we usually halved. I ended up having it all. He asked if I wanted to go out for food after and I said yes. 

At the restaurant, I eat one singular chip and immediately feel it. The immense movement in my bowel. It was happening and it was happening now. The turtle’s head was coming out of the shell. I give my friend a nod and run to the bathroom. The second I get in the stall and sit down it splashed out. I give the most disgusting shit i’ve ever mustered. The loudest sounds, the wettest poos to the point I’m sure it’s just liquid coming out. I gain my composure for a second of blissful silence. 

It happens again, more things exploding out of me. Only this time, I hear “oH COME ON NO” in this high pitch women’s screech.

I am there for another about 5 minutes and finally think it’s over and that the women had left. I go to wipe but the toilet paper was empty. I ran a couple stalls over praying that the woman wasn’t there. Thankfully she wasn’t. 

TLDR: TIFU by having too much caffeine that it exploded out of me with such violence that the lady in the other stall screamed

I [posted beforehand](https://www.reddit.com/r/twinpeaks/comments/1n1ea35/planning_on_making_the_pilgrimage_in_december/) asking guidance and just want to say thanks to everyone who helped — you're all a genuinely kind bunch. Special shout-out to Steven Miller’s [**twinpeaksblog.com**](http://twinpeaksblog.com) 🙌  
Posting this in case it helps anyone planning the trip (highly recommended).

**TL;DR:**  
Should’ve done **3 days**, petrol car would’ve been easier than electric, earlier in the year would’ve been better (for road safety/light), and **email/call locations ahead** to check visits are OK.

**Basics**  
• Duration: 2 days  
• Transport: Hire car (electric — limiting)  
• Fly in/out: Seattle Tacoma  
• Hotels: Kimpton Seattle (night 1), Salish Lodge (night 2)  
• Time: Early December, just before the floods

**Sites visited**  
**Day 1:** Kiana Lodge → Palmer House → Salish Lodge  
**Day 2:** Snoqualmie Falls → Millennial Log → Jack Rabbit’s Palace / Gersten’s Tree → Mount Si Motel → TP Sign location → Ronette’s Bridge (+ Sparkwood & 21) → “It’s your father!” intersection → DirtFish / Sheriff’s Station → RR Diner → Roadhouse & Bookhouse

**Highlights / notes**  
Day 1 started with the Bainbridge ferry (easy, coffee onboard, bonus half-finished jigsaws).  
Kiana Lodge were brilliant — emailed ahead, limited time due to an event, totally worth it. Wildlife everywhere (seals, bald eagles, sea otter down Pete Martell’s path!). Took the Kingston/Edmonds ferry to get closer to Everett.

Palmer House was a standout — Mary Reber is an absolute legend and a fantastic guide. Christmas tree up too, which was lovely.

Overnight at Salish Lodge: expensive but **worth every penny**. Stay there if you can.

Day 2 hit the Falls early (loads of TP merch in the gift shop), then North Bend locations. Jack Rabbit’s Palace is right by the car park for the homestead valley trail; Gersten’s Tree was harder — lots of massive fallen trees.

TP Sign location was en route, but we were coming from the wrong direction. The lay-by isn't that big, but there's are indicators you're in the right place!

Ronette’s Bridge was a favourite — fan messages everywhere, Sparkwood & 21 clearly visible.  
DirtFish was closed due to a bereavement (flag at half mast, message on the door) — we didn’t disturb them. Should’ve emailed ahead, but we saw the patrol car and the mill.

RR Diner was fantastic and busy (great to see). North Bend shops carry lots of TP merch, and the local cinema has Kyle & Sheryl’s handprints out front. Finished at the Roadhouse/Bookhouse before heading back to SeaTac. 

Would have stayed longer but we needed to get the car charged before getting it returned, and wanted to do the majority of the journey before it went dark.

**Final thoughts**  
Absolutely worth doing. Beautiful part of the world, genuinely eerie in places, and deeply satisfying as a fan. Just give yourself more time than we did, and travelling out if winter will give more hours of sunshine, which makes the drive a bit nicer.

Thanks again, everyone. ☕🌲",52,1767968971.0,twinpeaks,12,1.0,False

Sa post niya, she made it clear na she’s not ready for a relationship, emotionally unavailable daw siya. Despite that, I booked a staycation for us. It was like a fantasy, typical na nagmamahalan sa staycation. Tinulungan ko siya sa exams niya, cooked for her, and made her feel safe.

Fast forward, we started catching feelings for each other. Nafall ako sa kanya. Oo, aware ako na malulugi ako if I catch feelings, but bawal ba? Bawal na ba magsabi ng nararamdaman ko? Confusing din sa part niya kasi hindi niya sinasabi kung ano talaga ang gusto niya.

Oo, na-fall ako sa kanya because she’s the type of person I could imagine spending my life with, even though we’ve only known each other for more than a month. Still, I tried my best to be around her and understand her.

Palagi niyang sinasabi na baka iwan ko raw siya. I live in Mindanao, siya naman sa QC. I told her, “Hintayin mo ako for one year.” Magkukuha lang ako ng experience doon (nurse ako), then after that babalik ako ng Manila for my German studies. Doon na sana kami magkasama. She promised me that she would wait for a year.

She shared her dreams, gusto niyang magkaroon ng coffee shop since she’s a barista sa isang café. I promised her that we would build that coffee shop together. But all those promises broke in a minute, for such a petty reason, hindi ko lang siya na-update ng isang gabi. Promises really are made to be broken.

After three days of no contact, ginawa ko na lahat. I said sorry, asked for updates, and questioned myself kung deserve ko ba itong silent treatment. I told her that whatever her decision is, I’ll respect it. Then the following day, you unfriended me on social media, deleted our chats, and bigla ka na lang nawala.

Ganon na ba talaga ang mga avoidant? I saw you commenting on other girls’ posts like, “Sa akin yan lahat?” Hindi ko alam kung friendly lang ba or what. Nasasaktan ako kasi iniwan mo ako nang walang sagot, no explanations, nothing. It was clear avoidant behavior, at naghanap ka ng iba. Aminado ka naman na dismissive avoidant ka at nagde-detach ka during relationships.

Wala naman tayong label or anything, but it feels like I was left behind, broken, frustrated, and sad. Pinalit ako agad, na wala man lang akong kaalam-alam. Ang bilis. Sobrang bilis. I felt betrayed, like ginamit lang ako for a good time. Nakita ko reposts mo, ready na ready ka makipaglandi sa iba, habang sa akin hindi. So ano ba talaga tayo? It really makes me sad.

Pursigido na sana akong hintayin ka. Pursigido akong sabayan ang pangarap mo habang tinutupad ko rin ang akin. I was so willing to give my all, everything, but bigla mo na lang sinira lahat. I don’t know if I should still wait for your chat, but I guess you’ve already moved on and wala ka na talagang pake sa akin. It’s just a sad reality.

I thought I was going to be happy. I won’t deny it, I dearly miss her. And for a short moment of time, sana nasabi ko sa’yo kung gaano kita kamahal habang hawak-hawak mo ang kamay ko sa bus, habang nagko-commute tayo papuntang Fairview",10,1767968929.0,WLW_PH,3,0.92,False
1q89o3a,https://www.reddit.com/r/MotivationAndMindset/comments/1q89o3a/i_compared_myself_to_everyone_online_and_felt/,"I compared myself to everyone online and felt like a failure at 30, here’s how I fixed my mindset","
I’m 30. Spent the last 5 years feeling like a complete failure because of what I saw online.

Every day I’d scroll Instagram and see people my age or younger who had already made it. Entrepreneurs with multiple seven figure businesses. Fitness influencers with perfect bodies. Travel bloggers visiting 50 countries. People buying houses and getting married and having kids and looking happy.

Meanwhile I was working a mediocre job making $55k a year. Living in a small apartment. Single. Out of shape. No impressive accomplishments to speak of. Just existing.

I’d see a 25 year old who’d sold their startup for millions and feel like I’d wasted my entire twenties. I’d see someone with 500k followers and think about how I had nothing worth sharing. I’d see people on vacation in Bali while I was eating lunch at my desk and feel like I was doing life completely wrong.

The comparison was constant and it was destroying me. I felt behind, inadequate, like I’d fucked up somewhere and everyone else had figured out the secret to success except me.

Checked social media probably 50 times a day and every single time I felt worse about myself. But I couldn’t stop. Kept torturing myself with other people’s highlight reels while sitting in my own boring reality.

This went on for 5 years. From 25 to 30 I spent probably thousands of hours comparing myself to people online and feeling like shit. My self esteem was destroyed. My motivation was gone. I was stuck in this loop of comparison, despair, and inaction.

Turns out I wasn’t a failure. I just had a completely warped perception of reality created by social media. And once I fixed that perception, everything changed.

THE COMPARISON TRAP

Started when I was 25 and got serious about Instagram. Followed a bunch of successful people in my industry. Entrepreneurs, creatives, people doing cool shit.

At first it was motivating. Look at what’s possible. I can do that too.

But slowly it turned toxic. I’d see someone my age launch a successful business and instead of feeling inspired I’d feel inadequate. Why haven’t I done that yet? What’s wrong with me?

I’d see someone traveling the world and think about how I was stuck in my routine. I’d see someone’s relationship photos and feel lonely. I’d see someone’s body transformation and feel disgusted with myself.

Every post became evidence that I was behind. That I’d wasted time. That other people were living and I was just surviving.

The worst part was it felt like everyone was succeeding except me. Every single person on my feed was doing something impressive. Making money, building businesses, getting in shape, living interesting lives.

Meanwhile my life looked like nothing. Wake up, go to work, come home, watch TV, sleep, repeat. Nothing worth posting about. Nothing impressive. Just a regular boring life.

I started avoiding posting anything because what would I even share? My mediocre apartment? My average body? My regular job? Everyone else was posting wins and I had nothing to show.

Also started declining social events because I felt like a failure compared to my friends. They’d ask what I’d been up to and I’d have nothing interesting to say. So I just stayed home and scrolled more.

The comparison extended to everything. Someone my age made $200k, I made $55k, I was a failure. Someone had abs, I was skinny fat, I was a failure. Someone was traveling, I was working, I was a failure.

No matter what I did or accomplished it was never enough because there was always someone online doing more.

THE BREAKING POINT

Was scrolling Instagram at like 11pm on my 30th birthday. Saw a post from a guy I went to college with. He’d just sold his company for $8 million. He was 29.

I sat there looking at the post and the comments congratulating him and felt this crushing weight. I’m 30 years old and I’ve accomplished nothing. I’ve wasted an entire decade. I’m a failure.

Went down a rabbit hole looking at other people from college. One guy was a director at Google. Another girl had a successful YouTube channel. Another guy was traveling full time as a digital nomad.

Everyone had done something. Everyone was succeeding. Everyone except me.

Felt genuinely depressed. Like my life was over and I’d missed my chance. 30 years old with nothing to show for it.

My roommate came home and found me just staring at my phone looking miserable. Asked what was wrong. I told him I felt like a failure because everyone else my age was so much further ahead.

He looked at me like I was insane. Dude, you have a good job, you’re healthy, you have friends, you’re doing fine. Who are you comparing yourself to?

I showed him my Instagram feed. He scrolled for a minute and said, this isn’t real life. You know that right? You’re comparing your real life to everyone else’s carefully curated highlight reel.

I’d heard that before. Everyone says social media is fake. But I’d never really internalized it. I intellectually knew people only posted their wins but emotionally I still believed their lives looked like their feeds.

That conversation made me realize how distorted my perception had become. I was judging my entire life based on what I saw in a curated feed designed to make everyone look successful.

WHY COMPARISON DESTROYED ME

Spent the next few days actually thinking about why I’d been so miserable instead of just scrolling and feeling bad.

Social media shows you an endless stream of people’s best moments. Wins, achievements, highlight reels. You never see the failures, the boring days, the struggles. So you think everyone is winning all the time while you’re not.

I was comparing my behind the scenes to everyone else’s highlight reel. I knew all my failures and struggles and boring days because I lived them. I only saw other people’s successes because that’s what they posted.

The algorithm made it worse. Social media shows you content that gets engagement. Success posts get engagement. So I was seeing a concentrated feed of nothing but success stories. That’s not representative of reality but it felt like reality.

I was following hundreds of people specifically because they were successful. Entrepreneurs, influencers, high achievers. Of course everyone on my feed looked successful. I’d deliberately filtered my feed to only show successful people.

I had no idea what was actually behind the posts. The guy who sold his company for $8 million? I didn’t know he’d been working 80 hour weeks for 7 years and was burnt out and his relationship had fallen apart. I just saw the exit.

I was measuring my worth by metrics that don’t actually matter. Money, followers, exotic locations, aesthetic photos. None of that correlates with actual happiness or fulfillment but I’d convinced myself it did.

I’d stopped living my own life and started living for potential content. Would do things and immediately think about whether they were worth posting. If not, it felt like they didn’t count. My life became about external validation.

The comparison was making me paralyzed. I felt so far behind that I didn’t even try. Why start a business when other people are already successful? Why work out when other people already have great bodies? I’d already lost so I didn’t play.

I’d built my entire self worth on external achievement and comparison. If I wasn’t ahead of other people I felt worthless. That’s a guaranteed way to be miserable forever.

PREVIOUS FAILED ATTEMPTS TO STOP COMPARING

I’d tried to stop the comparison before but always failed.

Attempt 1, deleted Instagram for a week. Felt better. Reinstalled it because I was bored and immediately fell back into comparison.

Attempt 2, unfollowed a bunch of successful people. Followed motivational accounts instead. They just posted quotes about not comparing yourself. Didn’t actually help.

Attempt 3, tried to focus on gratitude. Made lists of things I was grateful for. Still felt like a failure compared to everyone online.

Attempt 4, tried to only post positive things about my life to fake it till I make it. Just felt like a fraud pretending my life was better than it was.

Attempt 5, muted people who made me feel bad. But I’d still check their profiles manually because I couldn’t help myself.

Nothing worked because I wasn’t actually addressing the root issue. I was still on social media constantly, still exposing myself to comparison, still judging my worth based on external metrics.

WHAT ACTUALLY FIXED IT

Was on Reddit, found a post from someone who’d overcome social media comparison by doing a complete reset. Not just deleting apps temporarily but actually restructuring their relationship with social media and building a healthier sense of self worth.

They talked about how you can’t just remove social media, you have to replace it with activities that build real confidence based on your own progress, not comparison to others.

Mentioned using an app called Reload that helped them limit social media use while building habits that improved their actual life instead of just their perception of other people’s lives.

That made sense. Every time I’d tried to quit social media I’d just feel empty and bored. I needed to build actual things in my life that made me feel good about myself independent of comparison.

Downloaded the app and set it up. Told it my actual problem. Compared myself to everyone online constantly, felt like a failure, needed to limit social media, build real self worth, stop judging my life based on other people’s highlight reels.

It created a 60 day program focused on limiting comparison while building actual confidence through personal progress.

Week 1 tasks were straightforward. Limit social media to 30 minutes per day. Unfollow everyone who makes you feel bad. Write down three things you accomplished today regardless of whether they’re post worthy. Work on one personal goal for 20 minutes.

The app blocked Instagram, Twitter, TikTok during most of the day. Only available for 30 minutes total. Couldn’t endlessly scroll and torture myself with comparison.

MONTH 1, WITHDRAWING FROM COMPARISON

Week 1 to 2, the first few days without constant social media access were weird. I’d pick up my phone automatically probably 100 times a day and couldn’t open Instagram.

Had to sit with my own thoughts instead of immediately escaping into other people’s lives. That was uncomfortable. My brain wanted the dopamine hit of scrolling.

The 30 minutes of allowed social media was interesting. When I could only use it for 30 minutes I was way more intentional. Didn’t just mindlessly scroll. Checked in with actual friends, looked at content I cared about, then closed it.

Unfollowed probably 200 accounts. Anyone who made me feel bad. All the super successful entrepreneurs. All the fitness models. All the travel influencers. Anyone whose content made me feel behind.

Started noticing how much of my day had been consumed by comparison. Every spare moment I’d been checking what other people were doing and judging myself against it. Without that I had so much mental space.

Week 3 to 4, tasks increased. Social media down to 20 minutes per day. Write down three personal wins daily. Work on personal goals for 30 minutes. Read for 20 minutes instead of scrolling.

The personal wins thing was harder than it sounds. I’d been so focused on other people’s wins that I hadn’t acknowledged my own. Had to retrain my brain to see progress in my own life.

Wins weren’t about being better than other people. They were about being better than I was yesterday. Worked out today, that’s a win. Finished a project at work, that’s a win. Had a good conversation with a friend, that’s a win.

Started working on learning to code which I’d wanted to do for years but never started because so many people online were already expert developers. Without constant comparison I could just learn for myself.

MONTH 2, BUILDING REAL CONFIDENCE

Week 5 to 8, social media down to 15 minutes per day. Most days I didn’t even use the full 15 minutes. It stopped being interesting once I wasn’t using it to compare.

Started measuring my life by my own standards instead of by comparison. Am I healthier than last month? Am I learning new things? Am I building something? Those questions mattered. What some random person on Instagram was doing didn’t.

The coding practice was going well. Wasn’t amazing at it but I was improving steadily. That progress felt good in a way that scrolling and comparing never did. I was building actual competence.

Started working out consistently. Not to look like fitness influencers but to feel strong and healthy. Stopped taking progress photos to post. Just worked out for me.

The ranked mode in the app kept me motivated. Seeing my consistency on my own goals go up felt better than seeing other people’s posts. I was competing with myself, not with everyone online.

Week 7 I went to a party and actually enjoyed it instead of thinking about how it would look on social media. Didn’t take a single photo. Just had real conversations and was present. That was new.

MONTH 3 TO 5, LIVING MY OWN LIFE

Month 3, social media down to 10 minutes per day. Honestly most days I forgot about it. Was too busy actually living.

Had built this whole routine around personal progress. Working out, coding, reading, working on side projects. Stuff that made me feel capable and accomplished without any comparison to others.

My self worth stopped being tied to how I stacked up against people online. It was tied to whether I was showing up for my own goals and improving over time.

Month 4, got a promotion at work. Small one but meaningful. Old me would’ve immediately checked what other people my age were making and felt inadequate. New me just felt proud of my own progress.

Started posting on social media occasionally again but in a completely different way. Not curated highlight reels trying to look impressive. Just genuine stuff. My thoughts, things I was learning, real life. Didn’t care about likes or comparison.

Month 5, reconnected with a friend I’d been avoiding because I felt like a failure compared to him. Turns out his life wasn’t perfect either. His business was struggling. His relationship had issues. He was stressed and overwhelmed.

Everyone has struggles. I’d just never seen them because people don’t post their failures and boring days and struggles. I only saw the wins which made me think everyone was winning constantly.

WHERE I AM NOW

It’s been 7 months since I stopped comparing myself to everyone online. My life hasn’t dramatically changed externally. Still have the same job, same apartment, still single.

But internally everything is different. I don’t feel like a failure anymore. I feel like someone making steady progress on my own path.

Social media use is maybe 15 minutes a day total, usually less. When I do use it I’m intentional. Following people I actually know and care about. Not following highlight reels that make me feel bad.

Building real skills and making real progress. Been coding consistently for 7 months. Built a few small projects. Working on a bigger one. Not because I want to post about it but because I enjoy it.

Working out regularly, reading books, learning new things. My life looks boring from the outside probably. But it feels fulfilling from the inside. And that’s what actually matters.

Still use Reload daily because it keeps social media limited and keeps me focused on my own progress. The structure prevents me from slipping back into comparison mode.

Most importantly I’ve built self worth based on my own standards and my own improvement. Not based on how I stack up against curated highlight reels of strangers online.

Had coffee with that college friend who sold his company. Congratulated him genuinely. Didn’t feel envious or inadequate. Just happy for him. That’s a sign the comparison poison is gone.

WHAT I LEARNED ABOUT COMPARISON

Social media is designed to make you compare yourself. The endless scroll of other people’s content, the metrics, the algorithm showing you viral success stories. It’s a comparison machine.

You’re comparing your real life to everyone else’s edited highlights. They’re not showing the failures, the boring days, the struggles. You’re seeing 1 percent of their reality and judging your whole life against it.

The people who look successful online might be miserable. You have no idea what’s actually happening behind the posts. Success metrics like money and followers don’t correlate with happiness.

Following successful people doesn’t motivate you, it demoralizes you. Constant exposure to people ahead of you makes you feel behind. That feeling paralyzes you instead of motivating you.

Your worth isn’t determined by how you stack up against others. It’s determined by whether you’re showing up for your own life and making progress on your own terms.

Most people are average and that’s fine. Social media makes you think everyone is exceptional. They’re not. Most people have regular jobs and regular lives. That’s normal and there’s nothing wrong with it.

Real confidence comes from doing hard things and seeing yourself improve. Not from external validation or looking impressive online. Build actual skills and competence.

The time you spend comparing is time you’re not spending building. Every hour scrolling and feeling bad is an hour you could’ve spent improving something in your actual life.

You can’t consume your way to confidence. Watching other people succeed doesn’t make you successful. Building things, practicing skills, making progress, that’s what builds real self worth.

IF YOU’RE STUCK IN COMPARISON LIKE I WAS

Limit your social media drastically. Not for a day or a week. For months. Give your brain time to recalibrate away from constant comparison.

Unfollow everyone who makes you feel bad. Doesn’t matter if their content is good or inspirational. If you feel inadequate after seeing their posts, unfollow.

Stop measuring your life by metrics that don’t matter. Followers, money, aesthetic, exotic locations. Those don’t equal happiness or fulfillment.

Build something in your real life. A skill, a project, a habit, anything that gives you concrete progress you can see. Real accomplishment feels better than comparison.

Write down your own wins daily. Train your brain to see progress in your own life instead of only noticing other people’s progress.

Remember everyone is showing highlights. No one’s life looks like their social media feed. You’re comparing yourself to a carefully curated illusion.

Focus on being better than you were yesterday. That’s the only comparison that matters. Are you improving? Are you showing up? That’s success.

Get external structure to limit social media. Your brain is addicted to comparison. You need systems that block access, not just willpower.

Find fulfillment in things that aren’t post worthy. Reading, learning, real conversations, personal growth. Not everything has to be content.

Give yourself 60 days of limited social media and focused personal progress before you judge if this approach works. Two months to break the comparison habit and build real confidence.

I spent 5 years from 25 to 30 feeling like a failure because of comparison. I spent 7 months building my own life on my own terms and now I feel accomplished and content.

Stop comparing. Start building.

What’s one thing you could work on today just for yourself, not to post about or compare to anyone?​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​",1,1767968876.0,MotivationAndMindset,0,1.0,False

**T+07:58:30 (Pulse 319)**
*Particle Physics Lab, University Office*

Elias stood up.

He didn’t remember deciding to. His body just did it, like it had grown tired of being a witness in a chair.

His legs felt numb at first, pins and needles blooming in the calves, the faint sway of blood returning like a delayed verdict. The room around him was a paper storm that had settled into drifts: printouts sliding off the desk, equations crawling across margins, timing diagrams and spectra layered like sediment. His laptop fan whined steadily, a small, exhausted animal trapped in plastic.

His phone lay face up now—no more posturing. No more pretending that turning it over could keep the universe from buzzing.

The screen in front of him showed the count with the kind of bland typography humans used for harmless things.

**Pulse 319.**

One more after this.

One more tick.

He stared at the number and thought, absurdly, of every time he’d been wrong in safe ways.

Wrong in seminar rooms, where the penalty was an embarrassed laugh and a revised slide. Wrong on exams where red ink felt like weather you could walk out of. Wrong in arguments that ended with beer and someone saying, *Well, we learned something.*

Safe wrongness.

He had built his life around the assumption that being right was a quiet reward. A personal satisfaction. A line in a paper. A citation.

He had never wondered what it felt like to be right in a way that didn’t fit in a journal.

Right in a way that reached outside the lab.

Right in a way that could break the world simply by existing.

On the conference line, voices had thinned over the last hour. The call had stopped being a conversation and had become a shared vigil, a rope held by too many hands. Elias could hear the texture of people now more than their words.

DeShawn’s breathing, measured and stubborn, the breath of someone who kept the room standing by refusing to collapse.

Mara’s silence, dense and listening, the silence of a mind that had crossed from analysis into acceptance and found the ground didn’t feel solid anymore.

A faint rustle of paper somewhere. A chair squeaks. A mic was muted and unmuted again, as if someone kept starting to speak and then deciding speech was a sin.

In the background of it all, the professionals’ chaos: the small sounds of people trying not to become a mob, trying not to turn anger into noise, trying not to beg.

Elias watched the plots update. The peak was still razor-thin. The phase is still locked—the mode still cleaner than it had any right to be.

Over-control, right up to the edge.

His mouth went dry. He swallowed and felt nothing move.

He didn’t want to say the thing forming in his mind. He hated it. It sounded like cruelty. It sounded like a taunt.

But it wasn’t cruelty.

It was physics.

He whispered into the headset, voice so quiet it almost didn’t count as speech.

“If it happens,” he said, “it already happened eight minutes ago.”

A solar physicist snapped immediately, not loud but sharp with the reflexive anger of a person protecting themselves from the idea. “Don’t.”

Elias winced. Not because he felt guilty, but because he understood why the word hurt.

Eight minutes.

Light-time.

Delay.

The universe’s oldest joke: the curtain falls before you see it fall, and you spend your last moments watching an image of a thing that no longer exists.

Elias didn’t mean it as a prophecy. He meant it as a reminder of the cruelty built into observation. The fact that made “real time” an illusion and made helplessness feel procedural.

Pulse 319 rolled toward completion.

On his laptop, the pulse counter ticked down with clinical politeness. On the line, someone’s breathing hitched and then steadied. Somewhere else, someone was whispering a checklist into the void.

Elias stood with his hands flat on the desk, feeling the paper edges bite his palms, grounding himself in the only real texture he had.

The plots have been updated.

Pulse 319 ended.

And the line went quiet, not the empty quiet of a dropped call, but the heavy, saturated quiet of a room full of people holding their breath so hard there was no space left for sound.

---

**T+08:00:00 (Pulse 320)**
*DKIST Control Room, Haleakalā Observatory*

The Sun breathed.

Pulse 320 arrived right on time, clean as a blade sliding into a sheath.

For a fraction of a second, everything was familiar in the way nightmares become familiar when they’ve lasted long enough to feel like weather. The disk-wide Doppler sweep rolled across the Sun’s face, a synchronized inhale. The brightness proxies lifted by a hair. The helioseismic mode landed exactly where it had landed 219 times before.

Perfect.

Obscene.

Certain.

Mara felt the room lean into it without anyone moving, a collective flinch toward the tick as if the human species had become one animal listening for a footstep.

And then the spike disappeared.

Not decayed.

Not smeared.

Not broadened into noise.

Gone.

The power spectrum refreshed, and the line that had been a razor was simply… absent, as if it had never existed. The noise floor returned like static rushing into a vacuum. The cathedral of modes reappeared as a messy choir, but the conductor’s baton was missing. There was no dominant peak. No polite ninety-second knock.

Just physics resuming its ordinary sloppiness in a space where something had been holding it too tight.

On the wall, the image feed hiccuped.

A slight stutter in the stream, the way a camera feed stutters when it is suddenly asked to interpret a scene that no longer matches its assumptions. Auto-exposure hunted, gain rising and falling in a frantic, blind search for a target that wasn’t there. Filters adjusted out of habit, shutters cycling for a Sun that had stopped giving them anything to shutter against.

Protection routines fired anyway, dutiful as trained dogs, and found nothing to protect against.

The Sun’s disk was no longer there to be filtered, softened, and translated into a set of safe colors—no bright limb. No granulation. No mottled, boiling quilt of convection.

Just a hole in the data where the most significant signal in the solar system had been.

And on the wall display, where a disk of impossible brightness had owned the room for Mara’s entire career, there was now an empty region of sky.

Not black. The instruments still had a background. Stray light. Calibration ghosts. The faint clutter of a universe that was never truly quiet.

But the Sun, the anchor, the bully, the nearest star they had built their entire understanding around, was simply absent.

A few people made sounds that weren’t words. Tiny exhalations that failed to become speech. The start of a laugh that died in the throat. A half-gasp was swallowed immediately, as if making noise might break whatever was happening next.

Jun’s pencil slipped from his fingers.

It hit the floor and made a small, ridiculous click.

The sound felt indecently loud. It felt like a joke told at a funeral. It cut through the room’s stunned silence with a physicality that made Mara’s skin prickle.

Alarms tried to start and then tripped over their own logic. Warning banners flashed, then changed, then vanished as automation revised itself in real time: target lost, signal drop, tracking failure, instrument safe.

Words that belonged to a telescope that had lost lock.

Words that did not belong to the Sun.

Mara heard her own voice before she realized she was speaking. It came out thin and almost calm, because shock sometimes wore the costume of composure.

“It’s gone.”

Someone behind her made a strangled noise and then forced it into language. “No,” they said. “No, it can’t be.”

Mara did not turn. She couldn’t. Turning would imply there was something else worth looking at.

Her eyes stayed on nothing.

On her second monitor, time stamps rolled forward. Data packets kept arriving. The system was still alive. The observatory was still taking measurements of… absence. The software kept trying to interpret the space where a star had been, and failing in small, honest ways.

Mara’s mind reached for the one piece of cruelty it could still hold onto as structure.

Eight minutes.

The thought was no longer a theory. It was a clock in her bones.

Eight minutes between here and everywhere else.

Eight minutes until Earth sees what she is seeing.

Eight minutes until the light from the last Sun that ever belonged to humanity finishes crossing the gulf, and the sky changes for everyone.

She stared at the blank region of data and felt a shallow, involuntary hope flicker anyway, sick and human and impossible.

Maybe it will pulse one more time.

Maybe the lock will release, and it will come back like a held breath finally exhaled.

Maybe.

The next ninety seconds began.

And in the room, for the first time all day, the metronome did not knock.

There was only stillness, so complete it felt like the universe had leaned in close.

Mara tasted copper in her mouth and realized she had bitten her tongue.

Eight minutes, she thought again, and this time the thought came with a physical awareness of consequence.

Eight minutes until the world notices with its skin.

---

**T+08:00:00**
*SWPC, Boulder*

The Sun’s plots didn’t fade.

They dropped.

Cleanly. Clinically. Like a heart monitor deciding, without drama, that the patient was no longer participating.

On the big screen, numbers that had been noisy and alive for hours went to baseline as if somebody had unplugged the universe.

GOES X-ray flux: flat.

EUV proxies: flat.

Proton monitors: suddenly unmoored, the live feeds still streaming but no longer anchored to the steady, familiar upstream source they were built around.

Every channel that had been held up by that bright, violent constant outside their windows became a blank that the software tried to label with polite error messages.

DATA GAP  
SIGNAL LOSS  
SOURCE NOT DETECTED

The room didn’t erupt.

It froze.

Not the theatrical freeze of a movie where everyone gasps in unison. The real freeze, the kind that happens when the brain refuses to spend calories on disbelief because disbelief has become too expensive. People went still at their stations, hands hovering over keyboards. A headset mic squealed faintly as someone clenched their jaw and shifted.

DeShawn stared at the wall of plots like his eyes could force the Sun back into the numbers.

For a second, he instinctively reached for the catalog of mundane explanations, the list every ops person kept like a rosary: pipeline failure, timing chain, satellite downlink, processing outage.

But the flatlines were everywhere at once. Independent instruments. Independent clocks. Independent agencies. The whole network agreed.

Agreement was what killed denial.

Someone, nobody ever remembered who, peeled a fluorescent sticky note off a pad and slapped it to the edge of a monitor.

**P320 = ZERO**

It was not a ceremony. It was survival—a label you could say out loud without choking.

Liz looked up at DeShawn, eyes wide but dry. Nobody had time for tears yet. Tears required permission.

A few people began talking at once, reflexive operational chatter trying to reassert order.

“Check redundancy…”  
“Cross-confirm with NOAA feeds…”  
“Do we have SDO…”  
“Is this a telemetry…”

DeShawn lifted one hand without looking away from the screen. It wasn’t a command so much as a request for silence.

They went quiet anyway. Not because he was in charge. Because the data had said something louder than any human voice.

On the conference line, Elias exhaled once.

It might have been triumph in another universe, a different timeline where being right was a victory.

Here, it was just grief wearing a different face. The sound of a man who had carried a number up a mountain and reached the top, only to discover the view was worse than he feared.

He said, very quietly, “Pulse three-twenty.”

No one answered him.

No one needed to.

The word *pulse* had stopped being a metaphor and become a timestamp on a death certificate.

DeShawn’s eyes slid to the windows.

Outside, the sky over Boulder was still bright. Blue and ordinary. The foothills sat in their familiar winter posture. Cars moved along the road like nothing had happened. Light lay on the world with the casual generosity it had always had.

The Sun was still shining.

That was the cruelty that made people angry, the particular insult of the universe’s speed limit. You could lose the most important thing in your sky and still have time to finish your coffee before your eyes get the memo.

DeShawn felt a sour flare of anger rise in his chest and then collapse into something heavier. Grief, maybe. Or the pre-grief of a man watching a guillotine fall in slow motion.

He looked at the wall clock.

The second hand swept like it had no idea what it was counting down.

Eight minutes.

Not until darkness. Not yet.

Eight minutes until the lie of daylight ended.

Eight minutes until everyone, everywhere, stopped arguing about graphs and conspiracy and jokes and finally learned the truth, the oldest way humans learned anything:

By looking up.

DeShawn swallowed and tasted metal. He realized he’d been clenching his teeth for hours.

He spoke, not into the conference call this time, but into the room. His voice came out steady because steadiness was what he had left to give.

“Mark the time,” he said. “All systems. All channels. Pulse three-twenty. This is our zero.”

Somebody’s fingers moved. A keyboard clicked. The sound was absurdly normal.

Outside, sunlight still poured through the glass.

Inside, the Sun was already gone.

**T+08:06:00 (Pulse 320 + 4 minutes)**  
*VESPER Mission Operations, Night Shift Room*

They had written **PULSE 320** on the whiteboard in dry-erase, twice, as if repetition could turn dread into procedure.

Under it, someone had added a smaller note in a different hand:

**Sunlight is a delay.**

Rina Torres sat with her headset on and a hand wrapped around a cold paper cup, not drinking, just anchoring herself to something that still had weight. The room still smelled like warm plastic and stale caffeine, but the air had gone sharp with that peculiar electronics scent you got when a system was being forced to do too much.

Somewhere along the way, they had stopped saying “T plus,” as if it meant control. Now it was just Pulse 320 and what came after, as if naming the cliff edge could make it smaller.

On the main display, the downlink window waited with the patient, indifferent posture of machines: **LOCK PENDING.**

They had been trying to reacquire VESPER for four minutes. Four minutes since the predicted Venus encounter time. Four minutes since the moment the plasma front should have arrived, if the propagation fit was right and if the Sun’s new discipline hadn’t invented a fresh way to be cruel.

A soft chime.

The lock indicator flipped.

**CARRIER ACQUIRED**

Rina didn’t exhale. She didn’t trust her lungs anymore.

“Pull it,” her teammate said, voice dry as paper.

Packets began to pour in. The screen filled with timestamps that were both relief and insult. Proof that the spacecraft had been alive long enough to speak. Proof that everything they were about to learn had already happened.

The first plots looked like panic drawn by a machine that didn’t believe in panic.

Magnetotail compression: off-scale.  
Ionospheric density proxy: spiking, then clipping.  
Ultraviolet nightside airglow: saturated into sheets, the planet’s dark hemisphere lit like someone had peeled the skin off its atmosphere and held it up to a lamp.

Then the particle instruments hit their hard limits and stayed there.

“Jesus,” her teammate muttered, and it came out like a reflex, not a prayer.

Rina’s eyes moved the way training demanded: not the pretty channels, not the planetary feeds, but the spacecraft’s own body. The stuff that told you whether your instrument was a witness or a corpse.

**BUS VOLTAGE:** jittering, then sagging.  
**SOLAR ARRAY CURRENT:** climbing in ugly steps, the signature of charging and discharge.  
**RAD MONITOR:** pegged, then went blank in a way that did not mean safe. It meant overwhelmed.

A line of text scrolled by in calm, uppercase profanity:

**SEU RATE EXCEEDS THRESHOLD**

Single-event upsets—the polite term for cosmic bullets punching holes through logic.

Then:

**STAR TRACKER: LOST IN VIEW**  
**REACTION WHEELS: TORQUE SATURATION**  
**ATTITUDE ERROR: GROWING**

“Come on,” Rina whispered, not to the spacecraft exactly, but to the universe as if encouragement could help a machine hold itself together. At the same time, an atmosphere-sized hammer hit the planet beneath it.

The next packet arrived with the bluntness of an injury report.

**HGA POINTING: OFF-AXIS**  
**LINK MARGIN: CRITICAL**

The high-gain antenna had begun to slip. VESPER was tumbling, not wildly yet, but enough that the beam was wandering off Earth. Sufficient that the downlink was becoming a stutter.

The planetary feed was updated one more time before the pointing drift stole it.

Venus’ nightside wasn’t just glowing anymore. It looked bruised from orbit, broad bands of emission crawling outward from the limb, chemistry and plasma forced into a pattern by a driver that did not care what Venus wanted. The induced magnetosphere was no longer a borrowed umbrella.

It was a fist being clenched and unclenched around the planet.

Rina caught herself doing the thing humans did when reality went hostile: she checked the clock, like time owed her a different answer.

**08:06.**

Two minutes until Earth’s eyes got the memo.

Behind her, a monitor chimed. Not the downlink. A system alert from a different screen, almost comically mundane.

**NEWS: “UNUSUAL SOLAR ANOMALY UNDER INVESTIGATION.”**

The words looked like they’d been written by someone who still believed vocabulary could restrain physics.

VESPER didn’t.

A new banner flashed on the spacecraft health panel:

**AUTO SAFE MODE INITIATED.**

For a heartbeat, hope rose anyway, sick and automatic. Safe mode meant the spacecraft still had a self. Still had enough coherence to decide to survive.

Then the next packet hit.

**SAFE MODE FAILED: ATTITUDE NOT STABILIZED.**

And beneath it, like an afterthought delivered by a cold god of diagnostics:

**WATCHDOG RESET.**

A watchdog timer. The last line of defense against a computer that had stopped making sense.

It reset again.

And again.

Each reset bought them a few seconds of telemetry, each one uglier than the last. Power dipping. Current spikes. Sensors are dropping out like nerves going numb—a brief return of the carrier, then a slip, then a harsher slip.

Rina leaned closer to the screen until she could see the pixel edges, as if proximity could force the data to confess a kinder ending.

“Rina,” her teammate said, and she could hear the strain under the flatness now. “Look at the timestamp. This is…”

He didn’t finish. He didn’t have to.

The packet times were Venus-time, then Earth-received time. The gap was the distance, the four-minute confession delay. Everything VESPER was saying to them was already history. The spacecraft was speaking from inside a past that could not be altered, only witnessed.

The downlink dropped for half a second, came back as a whisper, and delivered one last, small brutality.

**THERMAL LIMIT EXCEEDED: AVIONICS BAY**  
**POWER BUS: UNDERVOLT**  
**CARRIER: UNSTABLE**

Then the line went dead in the cleanest way possible.

**CARRIER LOST**

No fade. No graceful sign-off. Just absence, like a mouth closing mid-sentence.

The room stayed quiet except for the hiss of headsets and the low hum of machines that didn’t understand grief.

Rina tried the procedures anyway because the procedure was what humans did when their hearts weren’t ready to admit the truth.

Reacquire.  
Ping.  
Wait.  
Reacquire again.

Nothing.

On the screen, the lock indicator remained a calm, indifferent gray.

**NO SIGNAL**

Her teammate slowly pulled his headset off, as if it weighed too much. He looked at her, eyes reflecting the monitors’ pale light.

“It’s gone,” he said, and the words landed with a strange echo because they’d been said today about a star.

Rina’s mouth went dry. She reached for her cup and realized her hand was shaking.

In the corner of the room, a window with blinds let in ordinary light. Bright. Wrongly cheerful. The world outside was still daytime. People were still driving. Somewhere, someone was still buying groceries, still complaining about traffic, still arguing online about whether any of this was real.

Two minutes of mercy, and then the curtain.

Rina stood.

Not dramatically. Just the way Elias had stood, earlier, as if the body had decided sitting was no longer appropriate.

She took her headset off and set it down carefully, as if it were a ritual, like a tiny act of respect.

Her teammate swallowed. “Do we tell anyone?”

Rina looked at the blank carrier indicator, at the last VESPER packet frozen in the log, the final heartbeat of a machine that had done its job until it physically couldn’t.

“We already did,” she said, and it wasn’t bitterness. It was physics. “It just hasn’t arrived yet.”

She turned toward the door. Her legs felt borrowed, the same pins-and-needles unreality Elias had described, as if her nervous system were trying to negotiate a new contract with gravity.

“Come on,” she said.

He hesitated for half a second, then followed.

They left the submarine-dark room and stepped into the building’s hallway, where fluorescent lights still hummed, and someone’s distant laugh still existed, absurd and human.

They walked toward the exit because there were only two minutes left in the world where the sky was pretending.

And Rina, carrying the last words of a dead spacecraft in her pocket like a stone, wanted to be outside when the lie ended.

---

**T+08:08:00**
*Everywhere*

The light did not dim like sunset.

It stopped.

No warning slope. No courteous gradient. No cinematic fade where the world has time to rearrange its feelings. The day did not end.

It was removed.

One moment, there was ordinary winter sunlight lying on rooftops, on faces, on windshields, on snowbanks and sidewalks, and the thin steam rising from sewer grates. The next moment, that light was no longer participating in reality.

Day became the wrong kind of twilight in the space between one breath and the next.

Not night, not yet. Not the velvet comfort of a familiar dark. This was a sudden, bruised half-light, a dimness made from scattered sky and leftover glow and the thin mercy of an atmosphere still trying to behave as if it had a star.

Shadows didn’t lengthen.

They died.

The world’s edges softened as if someone had turned down the contrast on existence. Colors collapsed toward gray. The horizon did a strange thing, not darkening evenly but losing its authority, as if the landscape had forgotten how to look solid.

People looked up.

It’s what humans do when reality breaks: we search for the source.

People looked up and saw a Sun that wasn’t there.

Some screamed, high and involuntary, the pure animal sound that predates language. Some laughed once, a short broken laugh, and then stopped because nothing was funny anymore. Some went silent so hard it felt like a new kind of noise.

Dogs barked, frantic, the bark of creatures who knew the world’s rhythm had shifted and couldn’t understand why their humans weren’t fixing it. Birds exploded out of trees in chaotic swarms, then circled as if the sky itself had become untrustworthy. Streetlights flickered, hesitated, and began to come on in the middle of the day, their sensors confused by a darkness that didn’t carry the scent of evening.

Cars drifted.

Not all at once. Not like a movie pileup. The real version, messier: one driver braking too hard, another swerving, a few rolling on because people didn’t believe their eyes. A highway near Chicago became a slow, terrified river of brake lights. In Tokyo, commuters stopped on crosswalks and stared straight up between the towers. In Lagos, someone dropped a basket of fruit, and the oranges rolled into a gutter like miniature suns fleeing.

A child in a schoolyard asked, loud enough for the whole playground to hear:

“Where did it go?”

A teacher opened their mouth and found no sentence that didn’t sound like a lie.

In Boulder, alarms began to ring for reasons unrelated to space weather. Backup generators spun up. Grid control rooms lit with warnings as load profiles jumped in a way nobody had modeled: lights turning on everywhere at once, people rushing home, traffic signals stuttering, a thousand small systems trying to correct for a darkness that didn’t fit their rules. Phones began to overload networks with the exact two words, repeated in a million different languages.

The Sun.  
Gone.

In Haleakalā, Mara watched the empty feed and felt her body finally, properly, begin to understand what her mind had already known eight minutes too late.

She had been living in abstraction all day, in plots and overlays and spectral peaks. Abstraction was a kind of insulation. It lets you hold disaster at arm’s length long enough to describe it.

Now, through the glass of the observatory, the mountain’s world shifted. The bright blue sky became a washed, wrong color. The ocean horizon lost its sharpness. The sunlight that had been a physical presence on the building’s walls ceased.

And something in her stomach dropped, hard, as if her body had been waiting for the moment it could finally say, *This is real.*

Jun stood near her, mouth slightly open, not speaking. Someone in the room made a sound like a sob, trying to hide itself. The wall display showed nothing where the Sun had been, and the world outside began to match it.

Mara pressed her fingers to the edge of the console until she felt the bite of plastic.

History, she thought, doesn’t smell like warm plastic anymore.

History smells like the moment the lights go out.

In a cluttered office with too many coffee cups, Elias Venn lowered his head into his hands.

He didn’t cry. Not yet. Tears were slow. This was faster than tears.

For hours, he had wanted them to believe him, not for ego, not for a win, but for the terrible comfort of shared preparation. He had wanted colleagues to stop swatting at his words like they were flies. He had wanted someone, anyone, to say: *Okay. If you’re right, what do we do.?*

Now he would have given anything to believe that disbelief was true.

He heard the conference line still open on his speaker, a tapestry of human sounds. Someone is praying softly. Someone swearing. Someone asking questions no one could answer. DeShawn’s voice was trying to stay operational but failing because some events were too large to fit within the procedure.

Elias kept his face in his hands and whispered a sentence that wasn’t for them.

“I didn’t want to be right,” he said.

Outside his window, streetlights came on. The sky looked like late dusk without the beauty of evening. People stood in the street pointing upward, as if accusation could summon the star back.

And the cold began to write its first line.

Not instantly. Not in a Hollywood snap-freeze. The Earth’s oceans and air held heat the way a body holds warmth after the heart stops, residual and fading. But you could feel it, the beginning of the long slide. The moment the planet became a cooling ember instead of a living world.

Somewhere, in control centers and war rooms and kitchens and churches, a phrase began to spread, not as a meme or a hashtag, but as the first shared name for what was happening.

**The Long Night.**

Not a night you slept through.

A night you survived.

The first and ongoing long night of humanity.

The inciting incident, the pivot, the moment the species stopped being a terrestrial animal and became something else by necessity.

Because when your sun is taken, you don’t get to be normal anymore.

You get to choose what kind of creature you become in the dark.

And somewhere unimaginably far away, in a nebular pocket prepared like a cradle, a star arrived on schedule.

It did not arrive as a newborn. It came as an old furnace forced into obedience, still carrying the faint scar of a rhythm it had never evolved to obey. A metronome ghost threaded through its interior, a signature baked into plasma and field.

For the builders waiting in that prepared void, the arrival was a quiet success.

For Earth, the departure marked the start of an extinction clock counting down.

The sky held its breath.

Humanity did too.

And in the sudden, wrong twilight of a world without its nearest star, the question landed everywhere at once, heavy as gravity and sharp as hunger:

1q89kk8,https://www.reddit.com/r/belgium/comments/1q89kk8/belgium_culture_shock/,Belgium Culture shock,"Hi Everyone, 
I moved to Belgium a year back and I really like the country very much and it's straightforward people. But I find it odd sometimes seeing few things and really want the answers for those from the perspective of a Belgian,

1. Why do most of you guys just eat few slices of bread with meat slice(both looks dry) for lunch for almost everyday ? Sometimes I even see few of my colleagues just drink a soup for the lunch. Don't you guys like the lunch at all ? Won't you feel bored eating almost the same thing everyday? How does fill it your stomach ? 
2. Why do most of the men wear the same dress almost everyday? Is it you have 5 sets of same dress and wear each one a day or is it just the same dress ?
3. I almost never see a fat person it's like 2 fat person for every 30/40 people, given that being so healthy and everything, why do most of them drink a lot of coffee in a day ? And also lots of soft drinks like cola, fanta etc? How do you stay fit and healthy despite drinking all these ? 
4. Recently I moved to flanders region and I could see almost everyone speaks a very good English and my colleague told me, Flemish hate french speaking than the English, being a small country why do you guys fight over the language so much ? Is it because of long pending unsorted history ? 
5. Why do you guys always bring about the weather in any topic being discussed? I don't find the Belgium weather too bad, but why ?

Just curious to see the perspective of you guys, thanks 🙏

1q89isr,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1q89isr,It's me again with the daily food update. 4th day here and these are what I had.,"Bought some donuts from Sapporo Station in the morning. Like Baskin' Robbins, Mister Donut currently has a collaboration with Godiva. Picked out 5, but they aren't for me. I know tipping ain't a culture here, but gifting sure is. Passed the small token of appreciation to the housekeeping team.

I then headed to Katachi Coffee. This placed is run by a 2-person team, Hiro-san and his wife; whom I have the good fortune to call friends. Hiro-san speaks good English as he has spent time in Australia. He's also very focused on his coffee craft, and churns out amazing filter coffee. For anyone asking about coffee recommendations, I always point them in the direction of Katachi. His wife meanwhile handles the kitchen like a pro, whipping out sweets like their signature red bean cheesecake and our seasonal desserts, as well as 2 savouries on the menu - a doria and butter chicken. They also carry scones. Beans are roasted in-house. I have tried almost everything there and they are all really good. Today, I had their doria, a blend coffee and a craft gingerale, very kindly provided on the house by the owner.

Stayed for about 3 hours, then made my way to Sapporo Factory. Bought myself a brownie ice crepe as the shop was having a promotion. It was alright, I feel the batter could be tastier and lighter. Spotted the N.Y.C. Sand ice-cream at 7-11, something I've been searching for a while. The original N.Y.C. Sand cookies are something I enjoy and the ice-cream is good too - textures galore.

Dinner was Indian food at Taj Mahal. A touch pricey (almost ¥1400 for a garlic cheese naan) but tasty. I've only been to 2 Indian food places in Sapporo, the other being Jyoti; and I can't decide which I like more.

Bought 2 drinks from FamilyMart on the way back to clear some loose change and that's day 4.",10,1767968521.0,Sapporo,1,1.0,False

I had successfully cut myself straight off after a week of UTI where I just straight up peed red. I tried quitting caffeine before and failed but the reddest piss I've ever taken scared me out of my senses. Only had one coffee drink since, a chocolate drink that my parents took home.

I can feel myself processing and digesting art on an emotional level again. I haven't felt this visceral about made up scenarios or events since like 2016. It extends to real life as well now.

My dad works abroad and only comes home for a month in a year. This is the first time I've teared up back to back daily for the last week he's gonna be here. Last times it was just me getting teary eyed the day it happens, shedding a tear or two. Now I'm full blown experiencing some kind of anticipatory grief. I'm savoring every hour I hear his jokes and the noise in the living room of his favorite movies.

I've managed to have an emotional one on one with my dad for the first time since forever. Just on text though, since I dont know how to be that vulnerable in person.

With friends, it feels like I appreciate them more. I'm now more forgiving. I see everyone as people with a potential for good, and not see them as just their mistakes. My anxiety is still there, in some aspects even stronger than before, but how I deal with it is clearer to me because I can tell what I'm feeling, why, and what I would need in that moment. Like I'm more emotionally informed about what my brain is doing.

It feels like my PMS is worse in an emotional level too. Just before I started bleeding, I felt an overwhelming fear and panic that I cried for 6 hours.

I looked up people quitting and their emotions and yeah, seems like caffeine was a way to self medicate myself. I'm also anemic, so my feelings might also be being exacerbated by that.",2,1767968408.0,decaf,4,0.67,False
