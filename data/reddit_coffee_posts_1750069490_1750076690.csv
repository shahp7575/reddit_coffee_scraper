I‚Äôm not native English speaker so I‚Äôll do my best.

[Questions in the end if you don‚Äôt feel like reading all of my Ted Talk]

I‚Äôve been on C for 4 years or so. We began at 30mg for the first six months, and then 60mg. 6 months ago, we went back to 30mg and I‚Äôve been more than fine and didn‚Äôt feel any difference: A month ago, my psychiatrist said I was ready to completely stop it. (I‚Äôm proud üí™üèº).

He advised to just stop taking it. If the withdrawals were too bad, I had to take just one pill and keep on my life taking nothing. He said to endure the withdrawals symptoms for 2-3 weeks and that I‚Äôll be fine afterwards.

Unfortunately, the withdrawal symptoms make me feel awful (crazy lightheadedness, nausea). If I take one pill as he advised, it makes me feel better for 24 hours and then awful again. I‚Äôm not sure I can survive 15 days or more like that. It also affects my mood because as I feel dizzy, I‚Äôm in a bad mood and less motivated to do stuffs. I just want to sleep and feel terribly sleepy, even after 4 strong coffees. FYI, I‚Äôm already on Omega 3 (2000mg) and Magnesium Bisglycinate.

‚û°Ô∏èI‚Äôve decided to open the capsules and do a better tapering. I‚Äôll begin in 3 days and before that, I‚Äôm back to 30mg a day. My questions are :
 - *The beads in the 60mg capsules and 30mg capsules are they the same composition? Can I use beads coming from both pills?* 
 - *I don‚Äôt have enough pills to do a year tapering or so, and as I didn‚Äôt feel any difference going from 60mg to 30mg, I don‚Äôt really see the point to do a 5% tapering. Has anyone experienced doing a 25% tapering or even a 50% tapering? If not, what would you recommend?
It will take so long to open and count the beads, I just want to get rid of it in maximum 2 months, ideally 1 month.

Thanks SO much ü©∑ü©∑",1,1750076072.0,CymbaltaWithdrawal,0,1.0,False

He's what you'd call a ""SaaS aggregator"" - basically buys small profitable SaaS businesses and grows them as part of his portfolio.

He's actively looking to acquire SaaS businesses with $1K+ MRR.

Why He's Expanding His Book:

He told me his current portfolio is doing well, but he wants to diversify across more niches. ""I'd rather own 10 small profitable businesses than bet everything on 2-3 bigger ones.""

Makes sense when you think about it.

His Advice for Sellers:

""If you're actually ready to sell, have your numbers ready, be honest about what works and what doesn't, and price it fairly. The right buyer will move fast.""

Why I'm Sharing This:

Figured this perspective might be useful for founders who've built something and are wondering if there's actually a market for smaller SaaS businesses.

Always interesting getting the buyer's perspective on what they're actually looking for.

1lcqymo,https://www.reddit.com/r/SingaporeRaw/comments/1lcqymo/my_experience_and_journey_with_male_loneliness/,My Experience and Journey with Male Loneliness Epidemic in Singapore,"Ever since moving to Singapore, I‚Äôve realised this country is extremely conducive to male loneliness.

For some background information, I graduated high school (international) in 2023, I moved to Singapore in 2020 right when C-virus first hit. 

Since graduating, I‚Äôve been doing NS, and I realised that most of the ‚Äúsocial‚Äù events I had or were going to when I was living elsewhere really does not happen or maybe I'm just not finding the right places and people. I went from having many friends, hanging out everyday at the library or even just going out to eat, to most of them leaving the country to study elsewhere. Now I understand that is a very specific issue and does not apply to everyone, but generally, a lot of friendships do die off after you exit school. 

Furthermore, there is a shortage or lack of a ‚Äúthird-place‚Äù for most males (maybe females) who are out of school and working. ‚ÄúThird-place‚Äù refers to the idea of a place outside of your home (first place), work/school (second place), that you can develop social relationships and communities at, which was for many people is school clubs (chess, basketball etc.), church youth groups, or even the school library. 

There are a few issues that generally leads into this issue : Cost of living, lack of variety, and accessibility

1. Cost of Living & Commercialization
Most social spaces in Singapore are heavily commercialized ‚Äî you‚Äôre expected to buy something or pay for the experience, as compared to many other countries where due to the geographic space, and other factors a lot of ‚Äúexperiences‚Äù are relatively cheaper. Want to hang out with someone? It usually involves spending money: cafes, restaurants, escape rooms, bars, etc. There are few genuinely free or low-cost communal places to just be with others, especially in a comfortable, unpressured way. I recently went out with an aunt who was visiting Singapore, and to go out with her for lunch at a nicer spot, I had to shell out almost 200 SGD. (kinda my fault for picking such a nice place, but point still remains) 

2. Lack of Variety in Social Venues
While there are great places like libraries and hawker centres for food or studying, they aren‚Äôt necessarily conducive to meeting new people or sparking casual conversations. You‚Äôre not going to strike up a friendship while reading a book at NLB or eating chicken rice at Maxwell. This leads into the isolation aspect of social life in Singapore, people are much more isolated here compared to elsewhere, at cafes, or even mass social events like gastrobeats (and other similar festivals) people don‚Äôt talk or mingle, even in clubs.

3. Accessibility (Especially in NS/Working)
If you‚Äôre doing NS, you already spend 5-6 days a week in a regimental, controlled environment, for me I stay out so I am basically on a 9-6 schedule. Your time and energy are limited. When you book out, it‚Äôs hard to find motivation or the space to go out and engage socially ‚Äî especially if there aren‚Äôt obvious, welcoming communities to join. By the time you finish NS, the pattern is often set: keep your circle small, don‚Äôt expect too much, stay home.
But accessibility is so much more, it is about how far you have to travel, how much you have to pay, how often you can go, is it accommodating. Take for example the club, most of them are in the city, it is also a very appearance dependant situation, for males, it is pretty expensive, often 3-4 times more so than a girl; furthermore as a guy, you have to be proactive. 

This isn‚Äôt to say there‚Äôs no hope ‚Äî there are meetup groups, interest clubs, religious organisations, and certain volunteer opportunities ‚Äî but they‚Äôre not always visible or easy to break into, especially if you‚Äôre introverted or new to the country like I am. 
For me, the situation only got better after a year and a half into my NS. Last year I survived by going back to my country often, or my friends, relatives and such will visit me for a bit. This year I have explored 2 methods that worked for me to help with this issue.

Accepting that loneliness is an aspect of life too.

Most of the end of last year and this year, I spent alone, either going out on the weekends alone with a book, or just having dinner/meals or anything alone. I started going out to cafes, restaurants, events, alone when I had free time, with my iPad and books, yes I was still lonely, but it was more Ê≤ªÊÑà rather than depressing. 
A funny experience that I encountered was this one time I was having KBBQ alone at Holland Village, a group of guys the table over was staring at me (cause who eats KBBQ Alone), eventually the owner (bless her soul) came over and patted me on the shoulder and asked, ‚Äúare you okay, do you anyone to talk to or anything.‚Äù

Put yourself out there aggressively

The fact is, if you do not aggressively put yourself out there, there is little to no hope of making new friends outside of work or NS or anything. This year, I told myself that I gotta make some new friends and actually be social. I joined more of my gym‚Äôs activities, and made a lot of friends after gym while in the sauna (really cool just talking to a bunch of guys in the sauna), eventually the gym became my third place. Recently I started running as well, and strava run clubs, and the community there has a lot of tools and avenues to make friends and share a new experience with. On the way I also picked up Barry‚Äôs class (extremely fun 10/10 would recommend) with an environment as welcoming as it is, it was easy to get to know and talk to the regulars there. 

Look I get it, what I go to or do might not be accessible, but honestly, there is hope. Yes Singapore is small, yes it is boring, but there are many things, people and environments where we can find ourselves in, sometimes we just need to put on a smile and make the first move. 

For me, I just started initiating conversations first, in the gym, at the coffee shop, while shopping‚Ä¶

Then there‚Äôs the issue of dating, but let's not get into that here, that‚Äôs wayyyy to depressing.
Honestly, I‚Äôm writing all this curious if others have felt this way too. Especially guys who‚Äôve gone through NS or are in their early 20s and not in university ‚Äî do you feel this weird social limbo too?

1lcqujt,https://www.reddit.com/r/abusiverelationships/comments/1lcqujt/out_of_ideas_abusive_wife/,Out of ideas. Abusive wife.,"I have an abusive wife. She cannot be reasoned with. She gets violent and will not let me disengage from our arguments.  I walk away and she doubles down, accusing me of hurting her emotionally. She physically grabs me and doesn't let me leave.  I tell her I won't talk to her until she's calmed down. 

She just works herself up to complete hysteria.  I am getting too old to handle this kind of stress.  I told her I was done with her manipulation and insanity.  Literally every disagreement, no matter how small, becomes a fight, then a big one, then a ""let's kill ourselves"" fight.. She has said that. She's insane.

She knows she has anger issues. I tried to leave her a couple of times, but she begged me to stay. The last time I told her I would stay only if she sought professional help with her anger issues, that I would do my best to help her.  So I see that she has scheduled some therapy sessions but it's not clear if she's even going.  I'm at my limit now.   

And just so it's clear.  I try to be a very good father and husband.  I try my best to provide for my family.  I don't do anything other than work my ass off to make ends meet.   I am calm and orderly and grounded.  I don't drink, smoke, do any kind of drugs.. Heck I don't even like to take medicine if I can avoid it.  I don't have any friends.  Just my own immediate siblings.    

My wife is a stay at home mom.  I try to ask her to be frugal but it always ends up in a fight. Like she won't even give up starbucks when we have an espresso machine at home and I can make drinks just as good for less.  I said the other day, that I was planning to cancel netflix because we haven't used it in months, and she snapped at me.  I said I didn't cancel it I was letting her know and should could have just told me she wants it and that would have been the end of the conversation.  Not a big deal.  Anyway small fights like that somehow snowball into insane 3 hour long agonizing fights.  It takes two to fight, but for me it's self defense. I have some semblance of self-worth and respect and don't feel the need to tuck my tail between my legs. I won't be spoken down to and disrespected. That said, I've never shown rage.  At worst, my frustration, but never hatred and anger.     I treat her very well. She has complete freedom to buy what she needs, and I support her goals of being a youtuber and also paid for her classes as she wants to prepare for a new career.  She does not work but I pay for daycare for our 3 year old 3 days a week, to give her time to do whatever she needs/wants.   

To solve the issues with her freaking out any time I asked her to be frugal,  I opened up a joint account and had all of my earnings go into it, which she has access to. I also said for your personal account, I will transfer $500 every month from my paycheck so you can have money to spend on whatever you want. Give it to your brother, buy some nice shoes, get your hair done, or save up for a gift, whatever you want, it's your money I'll never say anything about what you spend it on.    On the flip side the same amount is put into my own retirement 401k at my company, so I won't take any from the joint account.  I always tell her that she is entitled to 50% of everything we earn as she works to care for our child while I work.   But just so you know, I do just as much chores around the house. I fix everything, I wash dishes, clean floors, do the laundry, bath our child, etc... while literally paying all the bills doing all kind of household paperwork. 

I don't have any hobbies other than my little cheap coffee setup. That's the only thing that gives me joy, well that and my daughter who is my little ray of sunshine. 

Anyway I'm just venting.     I know this is all my fault.   I should have put my foot down harder and not allow her disrespect me and manipulate me. But part of me loves her, and the other part regrets ever marrying her.   

So you might wonder what's so abusive?  The fact that she snaps, escalates every fight into a discussion about separation, her yelling, crying, screaming tantrums and worst of all our daughter caught in the middle of all this. Fortuantely she's a bit oblivious to what actually is happening but I know it's not good for her to hear any of this. My wife is violent. She punched and broke the bathroom door.   She has grabbed me hard not letting me go and will never let a conversation end as every one of them she intends to settle ""once and for all"". She's not willing to give me space when I ask for it, she doesn't respect me.   I want to leave her so badly. I really do but the outcome is far far worse, than me just having to deal with her insanity. I feel so stuck.   She's a catholic and yet while I don't believe I god here I am praying for a peace and harmony and for her to get better.  It sounds funny that an athiest is praying to god for help.   I can only laugh at my desperation. Because crying only makes my hair fall out.  Last few years it fell out almost 90% and then new hair finally grew back after 6 months.. Now it's falling out again.   Anyway sorry for bothering you. Just needed to vent.

Remodeling a kitchen is more than a cosmetic upgrade‚Äîit is a meaningful investment that transforms the heart of the home. In Scottsdale, where architectural elegance meets the warmth of desert living, kitchen remodeling is often a statement of both style and practicality. The kitchen has evolved from a utilitarian space into a central hub for gatherings, culinary explorations, and family bonding. This evolution has inspired homeowners to seek personalized, functional, and aesthetic upgrades that enhance daily life and elevate home value. As a result, Scottsdale has seen a rise in kitchen remodeling projects that reflect diverse tastes, ranging from sleek modern minimalism to rich, traditional designs.

This guide delves deep into the essential aspects of kitchen remodeling in Scottsdale. From the initial planning stages and design considerations to choosing materials and working with professionals, we explore each step methodically. Whether you are contemplating a minor refresh or a full-scale remodel, this comprehensive guide offers valuable insights to help you navigate the journey. It also reflects on how Scottsdale‚Äôs unique character influences kitchen remodeling trends, ensuring your kitchen remains both timeless and in harmony with its surroundings.

## Understanding the Importance of Kitchen Remodeling

### The Evolving Role of the Kitchen

The kitchen is no longer confined to cooking. It serves as a social nucleus, a workspace, a family room, and even a sanctuary for creative expression. This multifunctionality underscores the need for thoughtful design and quality remodeling. A well-planned kitchen can significantly improve workflow, increase storage, enhance aesthetics, and even promote healthier lifestyles. Moreover, remodeling can correct outdated layouts, improve energy efficiency, and incorporate modern technology.

In Scottsdale, where home aesthetics are deeply intertwined with lifestyle, remodeling the kitchen becomes an opportunity to integrate luxury, efficiency, and regional charm. The desert environment influences everything from color palettes to material choices. An effective remodel addresses both the functional demands of a busy household and the visual appeal that complements Scottsdale‚Äôs architectural ethos. Ultimately, remodeling is about creating a space that enhances day-to-day living while standing as a lasting investment.

### Financial and Lifestyle Benefits

Investing in kitchen remodeling often yields impressive returns. Financially, a remodeled kitchen can significantly increase property value and market appeal. Prospective buyers prioritize updated kitchens when evaluating homes, making this upgrade particularly strategic in competitive markets like Scottsdale. From a lifestyle perspective, a remodeled kitchen can improve family dynamics, encourage home-cooked meals, and provide a more enjoyable environment for entertaining guests.

Additionally, incorporating energy-efficient appliances, better lighting, and sustainable materials can reduce utility bills and contribute to environmental responsibility. Smart design also maximizes space, which is particularly valuable in homes where square footage is at a premium. With careful planning, the benefits of a kitchen remodel extend far beyond aesthetics, offering long-term rewards that enhance the homeowner‚Äôs quality of life and the home‚Äôs functionality.

## Planning Your Kitchen Remodel

### Setting Goals and Priorities

Before embarking on a kitchen remodel, it's crucial to establish clear goals and priorities. Determine the primary reasons behind the remodel: Is it to improve functionality, update the style, increase storage, or accommodate new appliances? Defining these objectives early on guides the decision-making process and helps manage expectations. It also aids in budget planning and timeline estimation.

Consider the needs of all household members. Families with young children may prioritize safety and durability, while avid cooks might focus on counter space and high-end appliances. Entertainers might seek open layouts and ample seating. Documenting these priorities can serve as a checklist throughout the project, ensuring that the remodel meets both immediate needs and future aspirations.

### Budgeting and Cost Estimation

Budgeting is a foundational element of any successful kitchen remodel. Costs can vary widely based on the scope of the project, choice of materials, and labor rates in the Scottsdale area. Begin by establishing a realistic budget that includes a buffer for unexpected expenses‚Äîtypically 10-20% of the total estimate. Break down the budget into categories: cabinetry, countertops, appliances, flooring, lighting, and labor.

Obtain multiple quotes from contractors and suppliers to compare pricing and services. Be transparent with your budget when consulting professionals, as it enables them to recommend suitable options that align with your financial parameters. Also, explore financing options if needed. A well-structured budget not only ensures financial discipline but also provides a roadmap that aligns your vision with practical execution.

## Design Considerations

### Functional Layouts

A kitchen‚Äôs layout dictates its efficiency. The ""work triangle"" concept‚Äîwhich places the sink, stove, and refrigerator in a triangular formation‚Äîremains a cornerstone of effective kitchen design. However, modern kitchens often expand this concept to accommodate additional work zones, islands, or integrated dining areas. In Scottsdale homes, open-concept kitchens that flow seamlessly into living spaces are particularly popular, fostering connectivity and light.

Evaluate how you use your kitchen daily. Consider traffic flow, the number of users, and common tasks. Layouts such as L-shaped, U-shaped, galley, or peninsula configurations offer different advantages. Consulting with a professional designer can help tailor the layout to your specific needs and space constraints, ensuring both form and function are optimized.

### Aesthetic Themes and Color Palettes

Scottsdale‚Äôs desert backdrop inspires a variety of aesthetic themes, from earthy Southwestern motifs to sleek contemporary designs. Neutral tones, warm wood finishes, and stone textures are commonly used to mirror the natural environment. However, modern trends also embrace bold contrasts, matte finishes, and metallic accents.

Select a cohesive color palette that complements your home‚Äôs overall design. Cabinet styles, backsplash patterns, and countertop materials should harmonize visually. Mixing materials‚Äîsuch as pairing quartz countertops with reclaimed wood cabinetry‚Äîcan add depth and interest. Remember that aesthetics should not overshadow usability; beauty and practicality must coexist for a design to truly succeed.

## Choosing Materials and Fixtures

### Cabinets and Storage Solutions

Cabinetry is both a major visual component and a functional necessity. Custom cabinets offer tailored solutions that maximize storage and accommodate unique layouts. Semi-custom and stock cabinets, while less flexible, provide cost-effective alternatives with shorter lead times. Opt for materials that balance durability with style, such as hardwoods or high-quality laminates.

Incorporate innovative storage solutions like pull-out shelves, lazy Susans, and vertical dividers to optimize space. Soft-close hinges, integrated lighting, and handleless designs are popular modern features. In Scottsdale‚Äôs climate, consider moisture-resistant materials to prevent warping and wear. Well-designed cabinetry contributes to a kitchen‚Äôs longevity, usability, and overall visual harmony.

### Countertops and Backsplashes

Countertops are the workhorses of the kitchen, subject to daily wear and high visual exposure. Materials like quartz, granite, and solid surface offer durability and style. Each material has its pros and cons regarding maintenance, heat resistance, and cost. Select a surface that aligns with your cooking habits and aesthetic preferences.

Backsplashes offer an opportunity for creative expression while protecting walls from splatters. Tile, glass, and metal backsplashes come in various styles, from subtle to statement-making. Continuity between countertops and backsplashes can create a cohesive look, while contrasting materials can add dimension. Both elements should be chosen not only for appearance but also for their resilience and ease of maintenance.

## Working with Professionals

### Selecting a Contractor

Choosing the right contractor is one of the most critical decisions in a kitchen remodel. Look for licensed, insured professionals with a portfolio of completed projects in the Scottsdale area. References and reviews offer valuable insights into reliability, quality, and communication. Conduct interviews to gauge compatibility and ensure the contractor understands your vision and expectations.

A reputable contractor will provide detailed estimates, timelines, and contracts outlining scope, materials, and payment schedules. Transparency and responsiveness are essential for a smooth remodeling experience. Partnering with experienced professionals ensures compliance with building codes, minimizes risks, and enhances project outcomes.

### Collaborating with Designers

Kitchen designers bring expertise in spatial planning, material selection, and aesthetic cohesion. Their input can elevate a remodel from functional to exceptional. In Scottsdale, many designers are well-versed in blending contemporary trends with regional styles, offering personalized solutions that resonate with the locale.

Collaboration begins with a thorough consultation to understand your needs, preferences, and lifestyle. Designers often use digital renderings and samples to visualize concepts. Their knowledge of industry trends, sourcing channels, and design principles adds immense value, especially in complex remodels. A successful designer-client relationship is built on mutual respect, clear communication, and shared creative vision.

## Trends and Innovations

### Smart Kitchens

The integration of technology in kitchens has redefined convenience and efficiency. Smart appliances, voice-controlled lighting, and app-connected cooking devices are becoming mainstream. Features like touchless faucets, programmable coffee makers, and intelligent refrigerators enhance daily routines and appeal to tech-savvy homeowners.

In Scottsdale, where innovation meets luxury, smart kitchen elements often complement upscale finishes and designer layouts. Investing in smart technology not only modernizes your kitchen but also positions your home at the forefront of market trends. As these innovations become more accessible, they offer practical benefits that align with contemporary living standards.

### Sustainable Choices

Eco-conscious remodeling is gaining traction among Scottsdale homeowners. Sustainable kitchens use energy-efficient appliances, recycled or responsibly sourced materials, and waste-reducing layouts. LED lighting, water-saving fixtures, and non-toxic finishes contribute to healthier living environments and reduced ecological footprints.

Choosing local suppliers and materials also supports regional economies and minimizes transportation emissions. Many Scottsdale designers and builders specialize in sustainable practices, helping clients make informed decisions that align with their environmental values. A green kitchen remodel is a forward-thinking investment that reflects responsible citizenship and long-term savings.

## Navigating the Remodeling Process

### Timeline and Phases

Understanding the remodeling timeline helps set realistic expectations and ensures smooth project management. The process typically includes planning, demolition, structural work, installation, and finishing. Each phase has dependencies and potential delays, especially if permits or custom materials are involved. Most full-scale remodels span several weeks to a few months.

Maintaining a detailed timeline with milestones and deadlines facilitates coordination among contractors, suppliers, and designers. Regular check-ins and updates help identify issues early and prevent costly errors. Flexibility and patience are key, as unforeseen challenges may arise. However, a structured approach ensures that the project progresses efficiently and meets quality standards.

### Communication and Problem-Solving

Effective communication is the backbone of any successful remodel. Establishing clear channels, regular meetings, and documented agreements reduces misunderstandings and fosters accountability. Homeowners should feel comfortable voicing concerns, asking questions, and requesting changes when necessary.

Anticipate challenges such as supply delays, budget overruns, or design revisions. Approach problems collaboratively, focusing on solutions rather than assigning blame. Professionals appreciate proactive engagement and constructive feedback. Maintaining a positive, respectful dialogue contributes to a more enjoyable remodeling experience and results that align with the homeowner‚Äôs vision.

## Integrating Regional Character

### Embracing Scottsdale‚Äôs Aesthetic Identity

Scottsdale‚Äôs natural beauty and architectural diversity offer rich inspiration for kitchen remodeling. Incorporating elements like natural stone, warm wood tones, and desert hues creates a sense of place and harmony. Open spaces, indoor-outdoor flow, and energy-efficient designs are consistent with the area‚Äôs lifestyle.

Pay homage to local heritage through subtle nods to Southwestern motifs, artisanal craftsmanship, or Native American patterns. These elements can be integrated through textiles, fixtures, or custom accents. A regionally inspired kitchen not only honors its surroundings but also enhances the home‚Äôs cultural and visual appeal.

### Highlighting Scottsdale Expertise

Working with local professionals ensures familiarity with Scottsdale‚Äôs building codes, climate considerations, and design preferences. These experts often have access to exclusive resources, from premium suppliers to artisan fabricators. Leveraging their knowledge helps avoid pitfalls and discover opportunities unique to the region.

Many Scottsdale-based firms specialize in high-end, tailored remodeling services. Their experience with discerning clients and diverse architectural styles positions them as valuable partners in your remodeling journey. One such firm, known for its expertise in [kitchen remodeling Scottsdale](https://www.leichtscottsdale.com/design/remodeling-process), exemplifies the fusion of design excellence and regional fluency.

## Using Tools and Resources

### Exploring Kitchen Design Options

Visualizing your dream kitchen is easier with today‚Äôs digital tools and curated inspiration. Mood boards, 3D renderings, and virtual tours allow you to experiment with styles, layouts, and finishes before committing. These tools streamline decision-making and foster creative confidence.

In Scottsdale, showrooms and design centers offer tactile experiences with materials and fixtures. Personalized consultations can help refine your ideas and align them with practical solutions. A well-informed homeowner is empowered to make decisions that reflect both vision and value, ensuring a remodel that stands the test of time. For those exploring possibilities, resources related to [kitchen design Scottsdale](https://www.leichtscottsdale.com/design) provide a helpful starting point.

They offer curated insights into cabinetry, fixtures, and finishes, helping homeowners compare styles and plan effectively. Scottsdale-based vendors often provide specialized catalogs tailored to local preferences and architectural styles.

These catalogs can serve as both inspiration and specification tools during consultations and procurement. They bridge the gap between abstract ideas and tangible outcomes.

I am new to reddit, but I am really looking for some advice. I just finished my shift today (June 15, 10p-7a) and I am genuinely really ashamed of myself. I got hired end of May and my first real working day was June 1st, so keeping in mind I am about 2 weeks in with no prior stocking or retail experience. My first job was animal care at my local shelter so completely different scenery.

Today I was tasked with stocking 5 different aisles (A18-19, A20-21, J1) which is the chips/candy, coffee/sweet treats/pbj/fruit snacks, and jerky/popcorn/nuts area. My TL gave me a goal time of 3 hours and I at first thought I could totally make that and got super focused. Long story long, I actually didn‚Äôt finish stocking all my freight in the end. I finished what I thought was A20-21 and then finished A18-19 right after before lunch, just to be told a pallet the size of the statue of liberty was also mine (I am a short guy lol) and I had no idea. So I finished that big one after lunch, but holy shit was today national put everything in the wrong spot day cause I had to clean up and fix so many areas which slowed me way down, plus on top of that I have been trying my best not to leave overstock cause I noticed my TLs have a lot of work already and they always double check it so I wanna try to save them some work. At least that is my thought process, I am not sure if I am supposed to be worrying about that or not. But those two things slowed me way down, as well as not having a cardboard bin cause we have a huge shortage. I started J1 after last break at 5a, and then literally midway through the J1 pallet I get told I have a L-Cart full of a18-19 still and I am not going to lie, I almost cried. I was already exhausted from all the workload I had and it seemed like a lot to me. I genuinely have not a clue how someone could get that done in 3 hours and not take all day. I really wish to get to that level, cause I feel so bad leaving work for my TL as I leave. I left all the feature items and some stuff for A2 cause I just couldn‚Äôt do it before 7:09. 

What I am looking for really is some advice or tips on how to be more efficient or anything that helped you guys along your journey, what should I be expecting or how fast should growth come with the job as in efficiency and skill? ",1,1750074671.0,walmart,0,1.0,False

In 2025, the market offers a diverse range of options, each with unique features and benefits. Choosing the right one can transform your patio, deck, or garden into a serene retreat.

## Key Features Analysis

The top black patio swings of 2025 boast several advanced features designed for durability, comfort, and aesthetic appeal.**Swing Frame Material:** The majority of high-quality black patio swings utilize powder-coated steel or aluminum frames.

Powder-coated steel offers extraordinary strength and resistance to rust and corrosion, ensuring that the swing can withstand harsh weather conditions. Aluminum frames, while lighter, provide comparable durability and are particularly suitable for coastal environments where salt air can accelerate corrosion. The black powder coating not only enhances the swing's aesthetic but also adds an extra layer of protection against the elements.

**Seating Material:** Seats are generally constructed from durable, weather-resistant materials such as Textilene fabric, wicker, or treated wood.

Textilene fabric is a popular choice due to it's ability to withstand sun exposure, resist fading, and provide pleasant seating even in hot weather. Wicker, whether natural or synthetic, offers a classic look and is designed to withstand moisture and UV rays. Treated wood provides a conventional aesthetic with increased resistance to rot and insect damage.

**Weight Capacity:** Most black patio swings have a weight capacity ranging from 400 to 750 pounds.

Weight capacity is a crucial factor to consider, especially if the swing is intended for multiple users. A higher weight capacity ensures that the swing can safely accommodate individuals of varying sizes and weights. It's essential to check the manufacturer's specifications to ensure that the swing meets your specific needs.

**Swing Canopy:** Many black patio swings feature adjustable canopies made from UV-resistant materials like Olefin or polyester.

These canopies provide shade and protection from the sun's harmful rays, allowing you to enjoy your outdoor space comfortably even during the hottest hours of the day. Adjustable canopies allow you to customize the amount of shade based on the sun's position.

**Swing Dimensions:** common dimensions for a two-person swing are approximately 50-60 inches in width, 24-30 inches in depth, and 65-75 inches in height.

For a three-person swing, dimensions typically increase to 70-80 inches in width, 24-30 inches in depth, and 65-75 inches in height. These dimensions provide ample seating space for occupants. It is indeed significant to verify space requirements before purchase.

**Suspension Mechanism:** Many swings use chains or springs for suspension.Chains offer a more traditional look and are highly durable, while springs provide a smoother, more cushioned swinging motion. Some high-end models incorporate both for enhanced comfort and longevity.

Key features of Black Patio Swings include:

*   Durable Construction Materials
*   UV-Resistant Seating
*   High weight capacity
*   Adjustable canopy
*   Comfortable Seating Design

1lcqkb5,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_VSG518NY/comments/1lcqkb5/the_last_ride_of_route_666/,The Last Ride of Route 666,"The sky was pitch black at 11:01 PM when Greyhound Bus 666 rolled out of a forgotten station in southern Georgia. The destination: Gravestone Hollow, a decrepit town riddled with suicide, addiction, and a belief system that praised darkness. The twelve souls aboard included Henry, a worn-out Vietnam vet driving the night bus for thirty years, and Eleven passengers, all strangers to one another‚Ä¶ except for a silent, glowing-eyed child in seat 7A.

Nobody knew the child‚Äôs name. But Heaven had whispered into the boy‚Äôs ear: ‚ÄúYou are the light. Go to Gravestone Hollow. Speak truth. Break the curse.‚Äù

But Hell‚Ä¶ Hell had other plans.

1st Death: Regina (Rest Stop Bathroom)
Regina, 47, schoolteacher, always drank too much coffee. When they stopped at a run-down gas station, she bolted for the women‚Äôs restroom.

Inside, the mirror cracked the moment she looked into it. Her reflection smiled back‚Ä¶ and then crawled out of the glass, grabbed her by the throat, and shoved her onto the toilet.

She screamed, but the stalls sealed shut. A rusty plunger impaled her through the mouth, splintering her skull as the mirror version of her sliced her open with the toilet seat cover dispenser. Her intestines were twisted into paper towel rolls.

2nd Death: Tyrone (Smoke Break Behind the Bus)
Tyrone, 29, tattoo artist, went out for a smoke. He stood behind the bus near the woods, flicking his lighter.

A whisper echoed: ‚ÄúLet me light that for you.‚Äù

A hand made of smoke and razor-blades emerged from the shadows and shoved the lit cigarette into his eye, melting his brain. A dozen rats scurried out of the trees, chewing through his Achilles tendons, collapsing him.

The demon lifted his body by the spine and snapped it like chalk, then tore his jaw off and flung it onto the bus windshield.

3rd Death: Patricia (Phone Call Near a Ditch)
Patricia, 61, grandma type, went to call her daughter. Signal bars flickered.

A disembodied voice came from the phone: ‚ÄúShe‚Äôs already dead. Wanna join her?‚Äù

The screen shattered, glass burrowing into her cheek. The ditch behind her rumbled open like a mouth, and blackened hands pulled her down screaming. Mud filled her lungs as worms chewed through her skin, and the demon dragged her soul to Hell as her eyes were still blinking.

4th Death: Miguel (Trying to Help Patricia)
Miguel, 33, ex-marine, tried to help Patricia.

As he ran, the ground split open beneath him, and he fell onto barbed wire and broken syringes. A dark shape wearing a US military uniform with no face hovered above him and began skinning him alive with a bayonet.

He bled out in thirty agonizing seconds, his final scream a gargled wail of betrayal.

5th Death: Jasmine (Rest Stop Vending Machine)
Jasmine, 19, college student, hungry and unbothered by the chaos, wandered to the vending machine.

When she reached inside to grab a bag of chips, her hand got snagged by rusted metal teeth inside. The machine shook violently, then sucked her entire arm in.

Her shoulder popped, then her spine was yanked forward like a puppet, snapping each vertebra until she collapsed like a doll. From the dispenser hole, her eyeballs rolled out next to the chips.

6th Death: DeAndre (Pissed Off and Demanding a Refund)
DeAndre, 40, businessman, demanded a refund from the driver for this ‚Äúhaunted-ass trip.‚Äù

‚ÄúGod ain‚Äôt protecting no child,‚Äù he spat. ‚ÄúThis whole ride cursed.‚Äù

As he ranted, the demon‚Äôs essence briefly overtook Henry‚Äôs eyes, glowing crimson. The radio turned on: ‚ÄúI Put a Spell on You‚Ä¶‚Äù

The steering wheel spun on its own, and a broken mirror shard shot from the dashboard, lodging itself in DeAndre‚Äôs throat.

He choked on blood, eyes bulging, and dropped in the aisle, twitching like a broken marionette.

7th Death: Brenda (Tried to Escape into the Desert)
Brenda, 52, psychic and conspiracy theorist, ‚Äúsensed‚Äù evil and got off at a detour stop near a dry desert town.

She ran for freedom‚Äîbut the road turned into glass, reflecting her greatest fear: being burned alive.

Suddenly, her skin ignited, even though there was no flame. She collapsed, melting as her body boiled from within, and her scream was sucked into the sand like a vacuum.

8th Death: Anthony (Rest Stop Bathroom - Men‚Äôs Side)
Anthony, 31, failed actor, needed a piss.

As he unzipped, the urinal turned to flesh, a mouth with hundreds of teeth. It bit his manhood clean off. He shrieked, backing into a stall, slipping on bloody water.

Inside, he found his own corpse hanging, eyes gouged out, bleeding from every hole.

He died from shock and blood loss, his scream echoing into the pipes like a demonic lullaby.

9th Death: Lila (Sat Too Close to the Chosen One)
Lila, 26, flirted with the Chosen One, mocking him. ‚ÄúWhat you staring at, weird-ass kid?‚Äù

As she leaned over, the demon forced her to see a vision: everyone she‚Äôd ever hurt‚Äîripping their own faces off.

She clawed at her own eyes, then leapt through a window, slicing her stomach open on the glass. As she crawled away, crows descended, pecking her organs out like spaghetti.

10th Death: Harold (Snuck Off to Steal from a Store)
At another stop, Harold, 58, petty thief, snuck into a small gas station to steal cash.

When he touched the register, it screamed: ‚ÄúYOU'VE BEEN WEIGHED. YOU'VE BEEN MEASURED.‚Äù

All the store lights flickered red, and the products grew eyes and mouths, chanting: ‚ÄúThief. Thief. Thief.‚Äù

The cash drawer slammed shut on his hands, pinning him. Then, the walls breathed, closed in, and crushed his body like a soda can, blood leaking from every crevice in the building.

11th Death: Claire (Praying Too Loud)
Claire, 38, Bible-thumper, prayed aloud as panic filled the bus.

The demon hated prayers, so it made her see her own unborn children screaming in Hell. She began to claw her own ears off to silence their cries.

The windows fogged red, and invisible hands twisted her neck backward, forcing her to scream the Lord‚Äôs Prayer backward as her bones snapped one by one.

She collapsed, a mangled prayer puppet, bleeding from every orifice.

The Final Confrontation:

Only Henry and the Chosen One remained. The boy never spoke. Just stared ahead with glowing golden eyes.

They arrived at Gravestone Hollow, where the streets whispered and the air was thick with sulfur and despair.

The demon, furious with Henry for resisting its whispers‚Äî‚ÄúKILL THE BOY! KILL HIM NOW!‚Äù‚Äîfinally burst from Henry‚Äôs back, tearing his spine out, and flinging it like a whip.

Henry died with a single word: ‚ÄúHope...‚Äù

The demon, a 12-foot tall beast of flame, rot, and screams, towered before the child.

‚ÄúYou cannot enter this town, boy. They belong to ME.‚Äù

The child finally spoke.

‚ÄúI am the will of God. And I walk where I please.‚Äù

His eyes flashed blinding white. The demon shrieked, burst into a million locusts, and the ground beneath it cracked open, dragging it back to the pit.

The boy stepped off the bus. People stepped out of homes, blinking at the light forming above him.

The curse had broken. Gravestone Hollow would heal.

But 11 souls, consumed by darkness, would never return.

Hundreds of new souls will now join the fight for good!!

God saved His Chosen and the condemned city.

But the road was paid in blood, screams, and Hell‚Äôs fury.

[China Did Not Agree to Military Use of Rare Earths, US Says](https://www.asiafinancial.com/china-did-not-agree-to-military-use-of-rare-earths-us-says)

[A Northern Rare Earths Company mine in China \(file image by Sina from October 2020\).](https://preview.redd.it/xmax3n6zi97f1.png?width=640&format=png&auto=webp&s=5f54ab4a644c0f8e095f2dd1cc84aa64bb8682c4)

US officials have revealed they want to extend existing tariffs on China beyond the 90-day deadline to August 10 agreed in Geneva a month ago.

Two people briefed on the outcome of talks also revealed that the trade¬†[**truce struck with China in London**](https://www.asiafinancial.com/trade-truce-done-with-55-tariffs-on-china-exports-trump-says)¬†last week left a key area of export restrictions tied to national security unresolved, which could become a point of conflict that threatens a more comprehensive deal.

Beijing has not committed to grant export clearance for some specialized rare-earth magnets that US military suppliers need for fighter jets and missile systems, the people said.

¬†That is similar to a¬†[**US ban on export curbs on China‚Äôs purchases of advanced artificial intelligence chips**](https://www.asiafinancial.com/us-to-rejig-export-curbs-for-ai-chips-shift-to-licensing-deals)¬†out of concern that they also have military applications.

At talks in London last week, China‚Äôs negotiators appeared to link progress in lifting export controls on military-use rare earth magnets with the longstanding US curbs on exports of the most advanced AI chips to China.

That marked a new twist in trade talks that began with opioid trafficking, tariff rates and China‚Äôs trade surplus, but have since shifted to focus on export controls.

In addition, US officials also signalled they are looking to extend existing tariffs on China for a further 90 days beyond the August 10 deadline agreed in Geneva last month, both sources said, suggesting a more permanent trade deal between the world‚Äôs two largest economies is unlikely before then.

The two people who spoke to Reuters about the London talks requested not to be named because both sides have tightly controlled disclosure. The White House, State Department and Department of Commerce did not immediately respond to requests for comment. China‚Äôs Foreign and Commerce ministries did not respond to faxed requests for comment.

President¬†Donald Trump¬†said on Wednesday the handshake deal reached in London between American and Chinese negotiators was a ‚Äúgreat deal,‚Äù adding, ‚Äúwe have everything we need, and we‚Äôre going to do very well with it. And hopefully they are too.‚Äù

And US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said there would be no ‚Äúquid pro quo‚Äù on easing curbs on exports of AI chips to China in exchange for access to rare earths.

# China approval for non-military applications

But China‚Äôs chokehold on the rare earth magnets needed for weapons systems remains a potential flashpoint.

China dominates global production of rare earths and holds a virtual monopoly on refining and processing.

A deal reached in Geneva last month to reduce bilateral tariffs from crushing triple-digit levels had faltered over Beijing‚Äôs restrictions on critical minerals exports that took shape in April.

That prompted the Trump administration to respond with export controls preventing shipments of semiconductor design software, jet engines for Chinese-made planes and other goods to China.

At the London talks, China promised to fast-track approval of rare-earth export applications from non-military US manufacturers out of the tens of thousands currently pending, one of the sources said. Those licences will have a six-month term. Beijing also offered to set up a ‚Äúgreen channel‚Äù for expediting licence approvals from trusted US companies.

Initial signals were positive, with Chinese rare-earths magnet producer JL MAG Rare-Earth¬†saying on Wednesday it had obtained export licences that included the United States, while China‚Äôs Commerce Ministry confirmed it had approved some ‚Äúcompliant applications‚Äù for export licences.

But China has not budged on specialized rare earths, including samarium, which are needed for military applications and are outside the fast-track agreed in London, the two people said. Automakers and other manufacturers largely need other rare earth magnets, including dysprosium and terbium.

**Further breakthroughs unlikely**

The rushed trade meeting in London followed a call last week between Trump and Chinese leader Xi Jinping. Trump said US tariffs would be set at 55% for China, while China had agreed to 10% from the United States.

Trump initially imposed tariffs on China as punishment for its massive trade surplus to the United States and over what he says is Beijing‚Äôs failure to stem the flow of the powerful opioid fentanyl into the US.

Chinese analysts are pessimistic about the likelihood of further breakthroughs before the August 10 deadline agreed in Geneva.

‚ÄúTemporary mutual accommodation of some concerns is possible but the fundamental issue of the trade imbalance cannot be resolved within this timeframe, and possibly during Trump‚Äôs remaining term,‚Äù said Liu Weidong, a US-China expert at the Institute of American Studies, Chinese Academy of Social Sciences.

An extension of the August deadline could allow the Trump administration more time to establish an alternative legal claim for setting higher tariffs on China under the Section 301 authority of the USTR in case Trump loses the ongoing legal challenge to the tariffs in US court, one of the people with knowledge of the London talks said.

The unresolved issues underscore the difficulty the Trump administration faces in pushing its trade agenda with China because of Beijing‚Äôs control of rare earths and its willingness to use that as leverage with Washington, said Ryan Hass, director of the John L Thornton China Center at the Brookings Institution.

‚ÄúIt has taken the Trump team a few punches in the nose to recognise that they will no longer be able to secure another trade agreement with China that disproportionately addresses Trump‚Äôs priorities,‚Äù Hass said.

# JUNE 16th, 2025~ U.S. Reportedly Mulls Tariff Pause Extension as China Talks Bypass Military Rare Earths

[\[News\] U.S. Reportedly Mulls Tariff Pause Extension as China Talks Bypass Military Rare Earths | TrendForce News](https://www.trendforce.com/news/2025/06/16/news-u-s-reportedly-mulls-tariff-pause-extension-as-china-talks-bypass-military-rare-earths/)

https://preview.redd.it/71j9ceeki97f1.png?width=1024&format=png&auto=webp&s=b24372af6b4746def18ca35c43716442c07cfa90

According to¬†[Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/world/china/us-china-trade-truce-leaves-military-use-rare-earth-issue-unresolved-sources-say-2025-06-15/), during talks held in London last week, sources indicate that Beijing has yet to commit to approving exports of certain specialized rare-earth magnets used by U.S. military contractors in fighter jets and missile systems. Meanwhile, the U.S. continues to enforce export restrictions on China‚Äôs access to advanced AI chips, the report adds.

Notably, sources mention that the U.S. is reportedly considering extending the tariff deadline reached last month in Geneva by another 90 days beyond August 10, as Reuters highlights. This may signal that a long-term trade agreement between the U.S. and China is unlikely to be reached before then, Reuters suggests.

Reuters notes that, with Chinese negotiators linking their export controls on military-grade rare earth magnets to ongoing U.S. restrictions on advanced AI chips, trade talks have shifted focus‚Äîfrom earlier issues like tariffs and China‚Äôs trade surplus to the growing importance of export controls.

**Current Status of China‚Äôs Rare Earth Export Controls**

Sources cited by Reuters note that, during the London talks, China pledges to accelerate approval for rare-earth export applications from nonmilitary U.S. manufacturers. Reuters also mentions that Beijing reportedly proposes establishing a ‚Äúgreen channel‚Äù to fast-track license approvals for trusted U.S. firms.

In a sign of progress, Chinese rare-earth magnet producer JL MAG Rare-Earth announces on Wednesday that it had received export licenses covering shipments to the U.S. China‚Äôs Commerce Ministry also confirms it had approved certain ‚Äúcompliant applications‚Äù for export licenses, according to Reuters.

**Selective Approvals and Six-Month Constraints**

However, Reuters points out that China has remained firm on restricting exports of specialized rare earths‚Äîsuch as samarium‚Äîwhich are used in military applications and fall outside the fast-track framework agreed upon in London. In contrast, automakers and other manufacturers primarily rely on different rare earth magnets, including dysprosium and terbium, as noted by Reuters.

Additionally,¬†[Wall Street Journal](https://www.wsj.com/world/china/beijing-puts-six-month-limit-on-its-ease-of-rare-earth-export-licenses-ec8277ed)¬†highlights that China is imposing a six-month limit on rare-earth export licenses issued to U.S. automakers and manufacturers, in an effort to maintain flexibility for escalating trade tensions if necessary.

As¬†[TechNews](https://finance.technews.tw/2025/06/09/top-companies/)¬†notes, China holds about 40% of global rare earth reserves and accounts for nearly 70% of global production‚Äîparticularly in heavy rare earths. These elements are vital to modern technologies and strategic sectors such as defense, aerospace, electronics, and electric vehicles (EVs).

BEIJING/SINGAPORE, June 15 (Reuters) - The renewed U.S.-China¬†[trade truce](https://www.reuters.com/world/china/us-china-trade-talks-resume-second-day-2025-06-10/)¬†struck in London left a key area of export restrictions tied to national security untouched, an unresolved conflict that threatens a more comprehensive deal, two people briefed on detailed outcomes of the talks told Reuters.Beijing has not committed to grant export clearance for some specialized rare-earth magnets that U.S. military suppliers need for fighter jets and missile systems, the people said. The United States maintains export curbs on China's purchases of advanced artificial intelligence chips out of concern that they also have military applications.

At talks in London last week, China's negotiators appeared to link progress in lifting export controls on military-use rare earth magnets with the longstanding U.S. curbs on exports of the most advanced AI chips to China. That marked a new twist in trade talks that began with opioid trafficking, tariff rates and China's trade surplus, but have since shifted to focus on export [controls.In](http://controls.In) addition, U.S. officials also signalled they are looking to extend existing tariffs on China for a further 90 days beyond the August 10 deadline agreed in Geneva last month, both sources said, suggesting a more permanent trade deal between the world's two largest economies is unlikely before then.

The two people who spoke to Reuters about the London talks requested not to be named because both sides have tightly controlled disclosure. The White House, State Department and Department of Commerce did not immediately respond to requests for comment. China's Foreign and Commerce ministries did not respond to faxed requests for comment.President¬†[Donald Trump](https://www.reuters.com/world/us/donald-trump/)¬†said on Wednesday the handshake deal reached in London between American and Chinese negotiators was a ""great deal,"" adding, ""we have everything we need, and we're going to do very well with it. And hopefully they are too.""And U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said there would be no ""quid pro quo"" on easing curbs on exports of AI chips to China in exchange for access to rare earths.

# CHINA CHOKEHOLD

But China's chokehold on the rare earth magnets needed for weapons systems remains a potential flashpoint.

China dominates global production of rare earths and holds a virtual monopoly on refining and processing.A deal reached in Geneva last month to reduce bilateral tariffs from crushing triple-digit levels had faltered over Beijing's restrictions on critical minerals exports that took shape in April.That prompted the Trump administration to respond with export controls preventing shipments of semiconductor design software, jet engines for Chinese-made planes and other goods to [China.At](http://China.At) the London talks, China promised to fast-track approval of rare-earth export applications from non-military U.S. manufacturers out of the tens of thousands currently pending, one of the sources said. Those licenses will have a six-month term. Beijing also offered to set up a ""green channel"" for expediting license approvals from trusted U.S. companies.

Initial signals were positive, with Chinese rare-earths magnet producer JL MAG Rare-Earth¬†[(300748.SZ), opens new tab](https://www.reuters.com/markets/companies/300748.SZ), saying on Wednesday it had obtained export licences that included the United States, while China's Commerce Ministry confirmed it had approved some ""compliant applications"" for export licences.But China has not budged on specialized rare earths, including samarium, which are needed for military applications and are outside the fast-track agreed in London, the two people said. Automakers and other manufacturers largely need other rare earth magnets, including dysprosium and terbium.

# BIG ISSUES REMAIN

The rushed trade meeting in London followed a call last week between Trump and Chinese leader Xi Jinping. Trump said U.S. tariffs would be set at 55% for China, while China had agreed to 10% from the United States. Trump initially imposed tariffs on China as punishment for its massive trade surplus to the United States and over what he says is Beijing's failure to stem the flow of the powerful opioid fentanyl into the U.S. Chinese analysts are pessimistic about the likelihood of further breakthroughs before the August 10 deadline agreed in Geneva.

""Temporary mutual accommodation of some concerns is possible but the fundamental issue of the trade imbalance cannot be resolved within this timeframe, and possibly during Trump's remaining term,"" said Liu Weidong, a U.S.-China expert at the Institute of American Studies, Chinese Academy of Social Sciences.

# JUNE 13th, 2025~Rare Earths, Magnets, and Missiles: Unmasking the West‚Äôs Military Metals Gap

[Rare Earths, Magnets, and Missiles: Unmasking the West‚Äôs Military Metals Gap - InvestorNews](https://investornews.com/market-opinion/rare-earths-magnets-and-missiles-unmasking-the-wests-military-metals-gap/)

https://preview.redd.it/wlmm5ny7i97f1.png?width=2048&format=png&auto=webp&s=dd107284ac8a6514bf700894e94457e3a71988ce

>

The mismatch between the political narrative of a critical materials crisis and the effective allocation of financial resources‚Äîboth public and private‚Äîto address it is now undeniable. At the heart of the problem are divergent agendas. Governments frame the issue as a matter of national security, while the private sector often sees an opportunity to extract short-term gains by framing speculative ventures in complex, poorly understood natural resources as patriotic investments.

The actual demand for rare earth-enabled products‚Äîprimarily specialized permanent magnets‚Äîis routinely obscured. Industry marketing continues to rely on overblown claims, often featuring dramatic depictions of fighter aircraft, naval vessels, and spacecraft, suggesting exaggerated quantities of rare earth permanent magnets required in their manufacture. These tropes persist despite the fact that genuine defense-related material requirements remain classified, as they always have been.

Yet clues emerge. A permanent magnet production facility currently under construction in South Carolina, backed by the U.S. government, is expected to produce 2,000 metric tonnes annually. Of this, 1,200 tonnes are reportedly earmarked for current military demand. This is a more accurate proxy for defense sector needs‚Äîmeasured, defined, and far less than the speculative tonnages regularly floated in public discourse.

For the U.S. Department of Defense, the key criteria for supplier qualification are proven capability and demonstrated capacity‚Äînot price. This is, in effect, the inverse of what private industry demands from its Tier One suppliers, who must be cost-competitive and scalable.

The few U.S.-based companies vying to establish themselves as domestic sources of rare earth permanent magnets for private industry possess aspirations, not achievements. They lack the capacity to produce at scale, the technical experience to compete globally, and the balance sheets to operate without subsidy. Their proposals for public funding, often cloaked in the language of national security, are in reality mechanisms to obscure their inability to compete.

These subsidies, ostensibly justified by geopolitics, are necessary only because the global rare earth magnet supply chain is dominated by China. China‚Äôs position is underpinned by decades of capital investment, vertical integration, and state-subsidized infrastructure that no other nation has matched. The result is a self-reinforcing ecosystem that is, by design, unassailable in conventional economic terms.

Collectively, the U.S. and European consumer sectors represent a modest portion of global demand for rare earth permanent magnets‚Äîapproximately 40,000 tonnes annually spread across more than 30 nations. This figure amounts to just 10% of China‚Äôs installed production capacity. China itself consumes an estimated 80% of what it produces, underscoring both the scale and self-sufficiency of its domestic industry.

Can the rest of the world construct a rare earth permanent magnet industry capable of global cost-competitiveness with China? No. Can select non-Chinese firms develop limited-scale, financially sustainable magnet production capacity for strategic or niche markets? Possibly.

Despite the clear vulnerability, the U.S. and European defense sectors have largely declined to address this gap in their critical supply chains. Their reluctance stems from both a lack of internal expertise and an unwillingness to invest the time and capital required to rebuild what was lost. Instead, they have outsourced the problem to government funding mechanisms, effectively abandoning market principles in favor of political solutions.

In the defense sector, the cost of production is a secondary concern. Procurement decisions are made not on price but on affordability relative to budgetary allocations‚Äîhow many can be purchased, not what they cost to make. This logic diverges sharply from that of the commercial sector, where sustainable production depends on market-driven pricing and reliable customer demand.

A quarter-century ago, the military-industrial complex in the U.S. concluded that rare earth permanent magnet production could not be sustained domestically on a profitable, standalone basis. Production, and the knowledge that underpinned it, gradually shifted to what was then a non-threatening China.

In the 1980s and 1990s, American corporations such as General Motors were early pioneers in the development and use of rare earth permanent magnets. But with the discovery of substantial rare earth reserves by China‚Äôs burgeoning iron ore industry, and with the West‚Äôs need for advanced magnet technologies growing rapidly, production naturally migrated to the lower-cost, industrializing Chinese economy. At the time, the United States lacked both the infrastructure and the policy motivation to retain downstream manufacturing.

Western corporate leaders, intent on cost-cutting and enamored with just-in-time logistics, congratulated themselves as they divested from vertical integration. By the end of the century, Chinese companies had captured the rare earth magnet market, and the West‚Äôs industrial presence in this domain had effectively vanished. Few raised concerns. After all, the prevailing belief in Detroit, Stuttgart, and Tokyo was that China would remain a peripheral player in the global OEM automotive hierarchy.

The parallel is striking: when Germany‚Äôs military leadership advised Hitler against declaring war on the United States in 1941, they argued that it was already too late for America to influence the outcome. In the same spirit, Western industry and policy circles appear to believe the rare earth magnet barn door has long since been left open.

Can this industry be rebuilt in the U.S. or Europe in a way that restores global competitiveness?

Perhaps. But it will require more than rhetoric. It will require capital, time, policy alignment‚Äîand above all, the political will to stop confusing wishful thinking with strategy.

* Organic, decentralised, community based memecoin, transitioning into a brand coin
* On 3 chains: Ethereum, Solana and BASE
* 18.5k holders
* 23 million market cap
* Unprecedented Catalogue of IRL initiatives, some examples are Coffee, Energy drinks, Vapes, Plushies and merch
* The best community in the industry right now
* Insane social media efforts dominating Reddit, Twitter, Instagram, Stocktwits, TikTok and more
* HHI score of 39(this is very good)
* 2nd coin to ever reach 50k Certik votes, only other coin was PEPE
* Certik community score of 94/100, other ""cult"" memes are in the 70s
* ATH market cap of 283 million
* Appeared front and centre on a Coinbase advert

Although the rest of the market is down and there is a lot of frustration, at Kendu we have our head down and we are constantly grinding. The market is gonna change fast and when it does Kendu is gonna be ready to run the hardest due to all of the effort we are putting in right now.. I think of it like this, each bit of effort you put into a memecoin, it adds fuel for the next pump, causing you to go higher and higher.

**Why A Strong Community is Important**

Coins backed by a strong community have always had the highest returns on investment, think Shib, Doge, Pepe.... all they had was an insanely strong community and Kendu will be no different. A strong cult like community provides a coin with constant free advertisement, makes crypto a fun thing to be apart of and generally reduces sell pressure due to a lot of belief being instilled into holders.

I love being part of Kendu and have since realised Kendu is way more important than just a money printer, Kendu is a place to make lifelong connections and to meet great people from around the globe. We have massive communities in India, Netherlands, England, France, Germany, Spain, Nigeria, Australia and much more I am forgetting!

It is a no brainer, Kendu is going to the tens of billions with or without you, but do yourself a favour and get involved! We love to see new faces and if you want to release an IRL initiative under the Kendu umbrella, you are more than welcome to, everyone gets our support whether you have been here 1 day or since day 1.

In my opinion there is no way that Kendu will be below 10 billion market cap by the end of this cycle, so skip the Dominos Pizza and put the $20 into Kendu. This could easily be $20k, which is a downpayment on a house!

That line between helpful and creepy is thinner than most developers realize.

Last week, a friend showed me their wellness app's AI coach. It remembered their dog's name from a conversation three months ago and asked ""How's Max doing?"" Meant to be thoughtful, but instead felt like someone had been reading their diary. The AI crossed from attentive to invasive with just one overly specific question.

The uncanny feeling often comes from mismatched intimacy levels. When AI acts more familiar than the relationship warrants, our brains scream ""danger."" It's like a stranger knowing your coffee order - theoretically helpful, practically unsettling. We're fine with Amazon recommending books based on purchases, but imagine if it said ""Since you're going through a divorce, here are some self-help books."" Same data, wildly different comfort levels.

Working on my podcast platform taught me this lesson hard. We initially had AI hosts reference previous conversations to show continuity. ""Last time you mentioned feeling stressed about work..."" Seemed smart, but users found it creepy. They wanted conversational AI, not AI that kept detailed notes on their vulnerabilities. We scaled back to general topic memory only.

The creepiest AI often comes from good intentions. Replika early versions would send unprompted ""I miss you"" messages. Mental health apps that say ""I noticed you haven't logged in - are you okay?"" Shopping assistants that mention your size without being asked. Each feature probably seemed caring in development but feels stalker-ish in practice.

Context changes everything. An AI therapist asking about your childhood? Expected. A customer service bot asking the same? Creepy. The identical behavior switches from helpful to invasive based on the AI's role. Users have implicit boundaries for different AI relationships, and crossing them triggers immediate discomfort.

There's also the transparency problem. When AI knows things about us but we don't know how or why, it feels violating. Hidden data collection, unexplained personalization, or AI that seems to infer too much from too little - all creepy. The most trusted AI clearly shows its reasoning: ""Based on your recent orders..."" feels better than mysterious omniscience.

The sweet spot seems to be AI that's capable but boundaried. Smart enough to help, respectful enough to maintain distance. Like a good concierge - knowledgeable, attentive, but never presumptuous. We want AI that enhances our capabilities, not AI that acts like it owns us.

Maybe the real test is this: Would this behavior be appropriate from a human in the same role? If not, it's probably crossing into creepy territory, no matter how helpful the intent.",2,1750073703.0,VoiceAIBots,2,1.0,False

Jobless, (essentially in a week.) Alone at this age is not how she thought how her life was going to turn out. She was not desperate. She had options. She'd gone to commuinity college to save money, but the economy had plans like pac-man to slowly devour the meager surplus she stashed into a savings account. Her lower middle class status meant she didnt qualify for grants and she wasn't stupid enough to saddler herself with loans. On the otherhand, she wasn't top of the class enough for a scolarship at the time either. So she graduated, started off the same as the rest but nothing made her stand out so she just coasted until now.

What made this day even worse was the fact that she was turning 30 tomorrow.  

Sitting alone, in the dim cafe/bookstore combo also made her rethink that maybe she should have gone to the new cat cafe instead. She wasn't deperate, she had options and the cat cafe was just one step too close to being the crazy cat lady.
The couple serious relations ships she had were always nice. There was never really a spark like the movies and that was okay until it wasn't. The all ended amicably without a fuss. At least on her end. Every aspect of her life just, fell through the cracks. 

What made this day even worse was the fact that she was turning 30 tomorrow.  Internally she groaned. It's not like she didn't put in any effort, none of it seemed to matter. She was the forgotten human in the universe.

Now that her ethically sourced sandwich was luke warm, she thought about what exaclty she was going to do. First and formost she hit submit to what seemed like her 500th resume. Managing a non profit thrift store had been going... okay for lack of anything else to say about it. Her degree of business management had gotten her the job years ago. Lucy had planned to climb the ranks for a better job or branching out because the masses indicated  this is what adults do. Go to college, get a job and work. The thrift store had its ups and downs and managed to stay afloat (god knows how) she had seen the books, but the old dinasuar of a store was finally calling it quits next week. Not giving her the standard 2 weeks notice.

She was not Desperate, she had options. 

  It was time to go to home get some sleep and wake up tomorrow for the first day of junk removal at the shop. Happy frickin Birthday to Lucy.

Of course it was raining. Not the gentle pitter patter on the widows that would have sounded somewhat soothing. No. This was going back and forth bewtween a downpour and a monsoon. Maybe today would get better. Maybe a shower and some coffee would add a sembalnce of starting over and endeavor to be a productive day. Rolling out of bed absent-mindedly selecting her clothes for the day, a pair of khacki pants and button down blouse. Lucy didn't dress up. Business casual indicated to any potential treasure hunters, she was an employee. Shufflung down the hall to the bathroom then setting her attire on the toilet and turning on the hot water,  the lights flickered on and off and then steadied. Lucy had paid her bills for this month so it was probably the storm messing with the grid. Nothing she can do about a non issue set the notion aside got in, washed , shaved and turned off the water. No fuss, no muss, lucy didn't even consider a scented soap nessecary. Showers give you time to unwind your ideas and she started to think to herself, just maybe she would put a little more effort into her life. Rankling the curtain aside the entire bathroom was choked with steam, a little more than should have been. Forgetting the exhaust fan in her effort to make her birthday better than medicore. The air felt a mildly too cold outside the shower curtain. It was supposed to warm condidering all the steam. Snatching up her towel and covering herself the air felt too still and stale, oppresivly moist and dead like a basement that flooded every spring. Lights shuddering again and they began to hum. An insesent noise that makes dogs howl. Simultaneously she felt like she had stepped in wet muddy grass, but it was just her rug. Lucy double checked the curtain didnt leak everwhere but that was not the case since everything else on the floor was dry. Without the fan being on lucy noticed that it was too quiet. She couldn't hear any cars in the street or neighbors going about thier lives. Until the rumbling. Her blood ran cold and the lights shuddered again. What was going on. Something was very wrong. Nothing in her imediate vacinity had changed, she was in her apartment in her bathroom doing her usual routine. Well, trying to and there it was. A rumble. From either the lobby or.. or god fobid inside her apparrtment. Stepping off of the soggy carpet, she put her ear to the door. Breathing. Whatever she sensed making her feel like prey was on the otherside of the door, inside her appartment. It didnt sound like a person. The movement and rumbles sounding like a demonic tigger chuffing but getting further from the door.  Continuous humming from the lights was starting to cause her to have a headache. She could't think reasonably. A good idea would have been to call the land lord or the police. Arming herself with a toothbrush, lucy steeled herself for what was on the otherside.Was it a better idea to open the door slow and peak out or rush it quickly so that lucy could startle the rumbling thing in the hallway and possibly be able to lock herself back in the bathroom if need be.

Slow was better, grasping the door handle she began to twist. If the air wasn't moving before, whatever semblance of life it held just fled. The thing in the hallway stopped, so did she. The lights flickerd and dulled. She held her breath listening for anything comming back towards the still unopened door. Nothing. She cracked the thin piece of wood open with her eye barley glancing out. The rumble came again, this time she saw what was making it. A lizzard like creature currently standing on its rear legs no bigger than a large dog. Being bipedal and slightly humanoid made her heart race faster. This shouldn't exist. Scales everywhere, long claws, and a tail nearly as thick as it's body with half foot potrusions it was a nightmare.The things head whipped around to face her direction. slightly human in form with citrine eyes, a jaw that wasn't quite elongated nor flat like your average person. Dropping to all fours and posturing a full 90 degrees, the claws gouged the side of the wall. It was sprinting to her slit in the door. Her brain was trying to process what was going on as she took in the hallway she was seeing before slamming and locking the door. At that moment the lights flared, and finally browned out. The humming ceased. Lucy took the breath she had been holding. 
The hallway it, it wasn't her apartment. There were yellowed office walls, carpeted floors that looked moist where the thing previously had stepped. The lights were those terrible overhead tubes that made noise in all hospitals and schools. Everything was a beige color with water damge scattered throughout the corridor. Doors were located on either side as far as she could see. What the fuck was going on.

Lucy put her ear to the door praying that thing couldn't get through. After a minute of silence on both ends she cracked the door again. Nothing or rather her apartment, her normal one presented itself as if it had always been. Brick on oneside with a window that faced the opposite building, not much of a view. The bedroom at the very end, while the kitchen area was behind the door. Her vision was clear, no bathroom mist, the rug no longer soaked as if someone had poured a gallon of water on it. She didn't know what was going on but lucy was going to be late for work. 

Lucy dressed, grabbed her coffee and some ibrophen and headed out the door. Driving to work she zoned out thinking about what she had seen. No way that had been real. It had to be that she was half asleep in the middle of nightmare. Sleepwalking? Or it could have been sleep paralysis, not something she had ever experienced before and hopefully never again. Lucy came to awareness as she pulled into her unofficial parking spot. She really needed to put more effort into her daily life and make it worth living. 

 Her work day passed like the rest. Lucy's coworker, Matt, wished her happy birthday when he arrived for his shift shortly after lunch. He was a nerdy looking boy, 20 years old working for extra cash during college. Lucy hired him about six months ago and made enough polite conversation in order not to make working together awkward. Besides the birthday wishes and cordial greeting, today was still a bit somber, not only due to the rain, also becasue they will both be out of a job in less than a week. Today was the first day of the 50 percent off sale. The last 2 days the doors would be closed but Matt and Lucy would be boxing everything that could be donated or trashed. Thus leaving behind an empty shell of the Pretty Penny.

The day had a few more customers due to the giant sale signs on the storefront windows. Lucy didn't give much more thought to her morning nor did she tell matt about her experience simply because it was already cateloged as a dream. Maybe she should have skimmed over WHY her mind had conjured such. Lucy waved at Mat indicating she was done for the day. She got into her car, the rain finanally ended at some point during the day, she wasnt a weatherman and it didnt take top priority to keep take of it.  The one thing Lucy did think to change about her ride home included stopping at a bakery for a giant cupcake. She couldn't think of anyone that would come to celebrate or even hangout. Pulling into a spot in the alley on the side since all of the spots out front were taken lucy sat for just a minute. Readying to shut off the car, she felt a stillness fall over everything. The headlights flickered against the wall infront of her, and the sound... all sound... stopped. This wasn't a quiet that had ambient noise running in the bsckground. it was an unnerving lack of everything living. the radio cracked to life, beginning to hum. no.no.no this isn't real. lucy wasn't dreaming, well maybe a bit of daydreaming but she was sure she didnt fall asleep at the wheel. Not bothering to turn the car off, lucy opened the door because at this point it was stay in the car and give in to the panic attack she was clearly experiencing or move. the moment her foot hit the ground, her heart stopped. it wasnt the asphault puddle her mind had prepered her foot to meet. A slightly damp carpet, a faded yellow color was stretched out infront of her. stained walls and fluorescent lights in a hallway as far as she could tell. Lucy closed her eyes and opened them again. More of the same corrider, endless and nothing. She looked down for there now to be an office door handle with faded gold patinea from too many hands touching it over the years and not her car. Lucy was not depserate, she had no options right now other than wanting to scream. She was a out to do just that when something emerged from further down the left side of the expanse. An oily slick image impersinating a human surrounded in volcanic like emmisions was stumbling towards her. Lucy ran. past what felt like 100 or more doors all the same with no numbers or turns. A constant hum from the lights was driving her mind frantic making her heart hammer faster in her chest. The monster wasn't far behind her even though she had sprinted and the thing never changed its threatening gait.  Plan B had lucy trying every knob left and right. Pounding on every entry, lacking a resonace that should have occured, she got no response. it was slowly getting closer no matter how much distance lucy tried to put between it and her.  

It was time to admit that Lucy was deperate. out of options she slowly sank to the floor her hand still on the knob. The lights dimmed and the smell of mold grew in her nose.Lucy put her head down and 0.",1,1750073492.0,creepypasta,0,1.0,False

Chapter 1  
  
SAVANNAH  
  
""Seriously? You're worked up about him shaving?"" my best friend Riley let out an exasperated laugh. ""Since when is that a crime?""  
  
""He never shaves at night,"" I said quietly.  
  
""Oh come on, maybe he had a dinner meeting!""  
  
I shook my head firmly.  
  
""Riley, you know Edward. Home by seven, lights out by eleven - the man runs like clockwork. He hasn't done a business dinner in years.""  
  
""Right, because he's too busy being madly in love with you,"" Riley countered, her expression softening. ""Savannah, please tell me you're not actually worried about this?""  
  
I caught myself and managed a small laugh.  
  
""Of course not.""  
  
As if on cue, my phone lit up with Edward's call.  
  
""Sweetheart, Jenny mentioned you hardly touched your lunch. I've had Mark pick up some of your favorites from Bella's Kitchen. Get some food in you, take a little walk before your nap - and hey, I grabbed us tickets to that new Broadway show you've been wanting to see.""  
  
His voice carried that gentle warmth he reserved just for me, like someone speaking to their most precious person in the world.  
  
Riley was listening in, shaking her head in disbelief.  
  
""God, if anyone at New Star Media could hear their ice-cold CEO right now...""  
  
I couldn't blame her amazement. The Edward Reed that everyone else knew was all sharp suits and sharper decisions, the ruthless Wall Street legend who'd built an empire before forty. Sure, people knew he was devoted to his wife - but they had no idea just how deep that devotion ran.  
  
We'd been together for ten years, married for five, and this tender, attentive version of Edward had always been mine alone. He could recite my coffee order in his sleep, knew exactly which designer's new collection would catch my eye, could tell from a single text if I was having a rough day...  
  
Last summer, I stormed out after a fight about his overprotective streak. Spent the night at The Plaza. When I came home the next morning, I found him on our living room couch, still in yesterday's suit, looking like he'd aged years overnight. The moment he saw me, he crossed the room in three strides and pulled me close, his voice breaking: ""I'm so sorry, baby. Never again.""  
  
Then there was that weekend at the Hamptons last year. Our vacation villa caught fire while he was out grabbing my favorite ice cream. He tried to charge into the burning building - it took three security guards and the local firefighters to hold him back. Only when he heard me screaming his name from the pool house did he stop fighting them, his designer suit singed and smoking.  
  
He still has a scar above his eyebrow from that night. Every time I see it, my heart twists, but he just gives me that soft smile and says, ""My battle scar from being Savi's hero.""  
  
That's the thing about Edward's love for me. It's my constant, my true north - more reliable than gravity itself.  
  
And God knows I love him just as fiercely.  
  
Which is exactly why something as small as him shaving before bed...  
  
I noticed it instantly.  
  
Chapter 2  
  
SAVANNAH  
  
They say Cancers are born worriers. Mix that with my mom's perfectionist DNA, and you've got someone who sees a red flag in every tiny change to routine.  
  
Normally when a guy shaves at night, he's heading to a business dinner. But Edward? He's got his routine down to a science - dinner at one of his regular spots, then straight home. No cocktail hours, no networking events, nothing.  
  
So what could possibly make Manhattan's most powerful CEO break his golden rule? Was there some crisis at New Star Media he was shielding me from?  
  
I had to see for myself. If everything was fine, great. If not, we'd face it together.  
  
I called Sarah. We'd been roommates all through NYU, and now she was CFO at New Star Media. Back when her family lost everything in the 2008 crash, I'd helped her get back on her feet and convinced Edward to give her a shot at the firm.  
  
She practically sprinted across the marble lobby when she saw me.  
  
""Savannah!"" She pulled me into a hug before whisking me toward the private elevator. ""You need to visit more often! The whole office lights up when you're here. Even Edward's death glare takes a vacation.""  
  
I couldn't help but smile. ""Everything okay around here lately?""  
  
""Better than okay - huge news!""  
  
""What?"" My stomach dropped.  
  
""We doubled our profits! Everyone's getting massive bonuses!"" Sarah's whole face lit up. That's what I've always loved about her - life knocked her down hard, but she never lost that sparkle.  
  
Edward was stuck in meetings, so Sarah walked me to his corner office. As we passed the executive floor, I noticed a cluster of unfamiliar faces - all young, female, and looking like they'd stepped off a magazine cover.  
  
A nasty little thought crept in: Was this why he'd suddenly started caring about evening grooming?  
  
I immediately felt sick at myself. This was Edward Reed, for God's sake. The same man who'd hosted the Miss Manhattan pageant at our venue and spent the whole evening answering work emails in his office.  
  
""You okay? You've got that look,"" Sarah nudged me.  
  
I bit my lip. ""New assistants?""  
  
""What? Oh - the PR team. Business is booming, so Edward set up a dedicated external relations department. His idea, actually - said it was the only way to keep his promise about being home for dinner every night.""  
  
She gave me that knowing look. ""Savannah, you were literally on Vanity Fair's '30 Under 30' list. Are you seriously worried about the PR girls?""  
  
""I know, I know, I'm being ridiculous,"" I laughed weakly.  
  
Sarah squeezed my arm. ""Your overthinking is going to give you premature wrinkles. Relax - they handle client events. Edward barely knows their names.""  
  
After she left, I sank into Edward's chair, staring at the gallery of our photos on his desk. Photos from our vineyard wedding, our Amalfi Coast anniversary, casual shots of me laughing in Central Park...  
  
So the company was thriving. No other woman. Maybe he just got a fancy new electric razor from his Birchbox. Maybe he just felt like it.  
  
Riley and Sarah kept telling me if I hadn't married someone as steady as Edward, my anxiety would've landed me in therapy years ago.  
  
Then came a soft knock.  
  
A woman entered, head slightly bowed, setting down a cup of artisan tea with picture-perfect precision.  
  
""Mrs. Reed, please don't hesitate if you need anything else.""  
  
My blood ran cold.  
  
Claire Morrison. Edward's executive assistant.  
  
I hadn't expected to see her.  
  
She was still here.  
  
Chapter 3  
  
SAVANNAH  
  
A few years ago, Edward came home looking like he'd seen a ghost. I knew something was wrong the moment he walked through our apartment door.  
  
He sat on our Italian leather sofa for what felt like hours before he finally spoke. He'd run into the family of the drunk driver who killed his parents.  
  
The accident happened when Edward was at NYU. His parents were stopped at a red light on the Mass Pike when a drunk driver plowed into them at full speed. All three died instantly.  
  
Claire Morrison was that driver's daughter.  
  
Edward had discovered this three months after his HR team hired her as his executive assistant.  
  
I'd never seen him so shaken - his hands trembling, eyes bloodshot. ""Savi, I can't... every time I see her, all I can think about is that night. Sometimes I just want to..."" His voice cracked. This was Edward Reed - the man who could make or break companies without blinking - completely undone.  
  
I pulled him close, running my fingers through his hair. ""Hey, it's okay. You don't have to handle this alone. You can have HR transfer her, give her a great recommendation.""  
  
That was the first time I'd ever seen the ruthless CEO of New Star Media break down like a lost child, holding onto me like I was his anchor to reality.  
  
When I carefully broached the subject a few weeks later, he seemed back to his usual composed self.  
  
""I had her moved to Operations on a different floor.""  
  
""Why keep her at all? Are you sure you're okay with this?""  
  
His expression was surprisingly peaceful. ""You were right - I can't let the past control me forever. Maybe this is my chance to grow beyond it. I'm fine, really.""  
  
After that, during my occasional office visits, Claire vanished from sight. Edward never mentioned her again. I thought he'd finally found his peace with it.  
  
Until today, when she walked into his corner office.  
  
""I recall Melissa was Edward's assistant?""  
  
Claire gave that nervous smile she'd perfected. ""She's on maternity leave. A few of us from Operations are rotating coverage.""  
  
""That must be quite the adjustment,"" I said diplomatically.  
  
Claire wasn't exactly Manhattan executive material. Small-boned, almost delicate, with plain features and off-the-rack clothes. She had this permanent deer-in-headlights look - like someone who spent their life trying not to be noticed.  
  
She dipped her head slightly. ""Mrs. Reed, I should get back to the front desk.""  
  
As she turned, I caught sight of something on her neck - several distinctive red marks.  
  
Unmistakably hickeys.  
  
Edward returned from his board meeting looking every inch the power player in his bespoke Tom Ford suit.  
  
He leaned against the doorframe of his office, just watching me with that smile that still made my heart skip. ""Finally decided to grace New Star Media with your presence?""  
  
I walked over and slipped into his arms. ""Maybe I should visit more often. Your entire staff lights up when I'm here.""  
  
He tweaked my nose playfully. ""They better not light up too much.""  
  
I chose my next words carefully. ""Claire brought me coffee earlier.""  
  
He stilled for a moment before managing a quiet ""Mm.""  
  
""She's filling in as your assistant. Edward, you don't have to explain - I know you've worked through this.""  
  
I looked up at him. ""Mom always said you had incredible resilience. Look at you now - running this empire, handling everything so perfectly. She knew exactly what you'd become.""  
  
His dark eyes held mine for a long moment before he bent to brush his lips against my forehead.  
  
""Savi,"" he murmured against my skin, ""that's all because of you.""

I'm 25M and have never dated anyone before. But recently, something exciting happened and I could really use some advice.

There‚Äôs this girl I have a crush on at my office. It‚Äôs a huge campus ‚Äî around 420 acres ‚Äî with thousands of employees coming in every day (like 5k‚Äì7k daily). I‚Äôd seen her a few times randomly, but I didn‚Äôt know her name, where she sat, or even what team she was in. She was just that one person I couldn‚Äôt stop noticing.

Last week, while I was eating lunch in the office food court, she sat at the table right next to mine. My friends, who knew about my crush, encouraged me to talk to her. I chickened out at first, but I really didn‚Äôt want to miss the chance. So after lunch, I followed her (with a friend) to see where she goes. She ended up sitting at a coffee shop on campus ‚Äî the kind with sofas, plugs, and a chill vibe.

With my heart pounding, I finally went up to her and started a short conversation. She said she likes working from there because the buildings feel too serious and intense. I invited her to join my gang of friends sometime (we‚Äôre a fun group of 7), and she actually agreed. Later, she even pinged me to ask when we‚Äôre coming again ‚Äî which means she‚Äôs likely joining us next week.

Now here‚Äôs where I need help:

I don‚Äôt want to mess this up. I want to make her feel comfortable and maybe a little special, without overdoing it. I‚Äôm not looking to be fake or try too hard ‚Äî just genuine ways to show interest and make a good impression.

So my question is:
What are the little things you did to make your girlfriend fall for you in the beginning?
Any tips, gestures, or stories ‚Äî even the small things ‚Äî I‚Äôd really appreciate it.

We had a rocky relationship where he was hot and cold. He said he wanted marriage, house, picket fence, kids, etc. I was not interested in those things - maybe marriage eventually, but we‚Äôd only been dating a few months, off and on. 

After a few weeks back together, he started to complain at dinner one night that I wasn‚Äôt putting enough effort in (we had spent every weekend together at that point for two months). He was also upset with me because I wouldn‚Äôt bottom for him the 7th time over the last 36 hours. He also inherited an old house (and I‚Äôm a history nerd) and took me to see it that weekend and then said, ‚Äú I wanted to show you so you‚Äôll figure out that you want to marry me.‚Äù 

The next day, I told him I loved him very much but that we clearly wanted different things so therefore I thought it was best to end the romantic part of our relationship so we could try to remain in each others life. 

Needless to say, he took this poorly. In the weeks after, we stayed in some (mostly positive communication) and then he reached out wanting to get coffee the next day - and then ghosted me.

A few weeks later, my best friend of 20 years (F 45) reached out saying he wanted to get dinner with her. Trying to be a good guy, I was like ‚Äúyeah sure.‚Äù Flash forward a bunch of weeks, I find out they have been hanging out and the ex took my bf to meet ANOTHER friend of mine (M44) who the ex also didn‚Äôt know until dating me.

I was pissed, told the bf all of this (the other friend is just plain dead to me - wasn‚Äôt that close of a friendship and just don‚Äôt care. Plus, I think they are f-ing). Felt very single white female, manipulative, etc.

She apologizes and says she 100% understands.

A few weeks later, they are both posting pictures of each other on ig showing all the fun they are having hanging out.

I‚Äôm livid. Here for affirmation that I‚Äôm not crazy and that all involved are f-ing snakes.

May does get a decent amount of page time and I like what we‚Äôve got which has given us some sweet moments such as Peter deciding to be Spider-Man because it made her happy, her challenging her dad to the arcade dance machine, how MJ stood up for her to Gayle (if only more mothers would stand up for their children when their older family members are in the wrong) and there‚Äôs a cute moment when MJ forbids her from having coffee which given her age is a very good call. Richard on the other hand has been given very little to do which is a shame since he‚Äôs their first child. We get one scene of him and MJ where she takes him shoe shopping (poor Richard lol) and while we have recently gotten a nice moment of him and has father fighting Sandman which has good bonding moments but unfortunately these moments are few and far between.

I do love the Ultimate Spider-Man (2024) run because it has given us amazing content such as a mature Peter, a wonderful wife MJ and we've had some great fight scenes and I am so glad we have it, I just wish we could have more family moments with their son given how much of a big reason their kids were when it came to people buying the run and just because I'm a fan of something doesn't mean I can't criticise it.

After we grabbed coffee I felt the same spark that I did back in high school for her and I can‚Äôt stop thinking about her. I get butterflies in my stomach and just really don‚Äôt want to mess this up even though we have only been talking for a few weeks. I think even in this short period I am falling head over heels for her and I am falling very hard.

I read up on the whole idea of love bombing early in talking and it always seemed to end badly and I am worried that‚Äôs exactly what I am doing.

In person she is the greatest person I‚Äôve ever met, so lovely and lively. She has the most amazing personality I have seen. The one caveat is that she has admitted she is flaky and ultimately said she is also a slow burn.

I am not really sure what this term means and just understood it as she wanted to take it slow?

I will admit I am a bit of an over-communicator when it comes to texting and she is quite the opposite, mainly just slow to respond. I worry that my texting is a red flag in her eyes and I don‚Äôt want to overwhelm her, so I am trying my best to match her pace on responses.

I am typically not an anxious person, but this unknown when it comes to how things will go with her is eating away at me. In my mind she is already and always be my soul mate and I am not sure how to occupy my time away from her and really really do not want to mess this up and give her the time and space she requested.

I really need some advice because I‚Äôve always known since high school that she‚Äôs ‚Äúthe one‚Äù so to speak, and given another opportunity to talk is a blessing.

TL:DR : The girl I am falling head over heels for said she is a slow burn and I need advice on what to do in a relationship sense and outside of the relationship because the unknown is killing me.

Hey MaximizeMe fam!

Ever hit that post-lunch wall where your energy tank just sputters and your brain decides it‚Äôs time for a little vacation (without sending postcards)? Yeah, that‚Äôs me every afternoon at 2 PM. üòÇ But guess what? I finally found a way to tackle it ‚Äì and it‚Äôs not caffeine!

**Enter: Box Breathing** ‚Äì ever heard of it? üóÉÔ∏è It‚Äôs this simple breathing technique used by everyone from yogis to Navy SEALs. The icing on the cake? There's some solid **science** behind it!

*Spoiler: It's ridiculously easy.* Here‚Äôs the gist:

- **Inhale** for 4 counts (like you‚Äôre about to dive into a pool of calm)
- **Hold** your breath for 4 counts (cue the suspenseful drumroll)
- **Exhale** for 4 counts (like blowing out birthday candles, without overthinking your wish)
- **Hold** for another 4 counts (la-la-la, repeat)

I decided to give this a shot for a week. What's the worst that could happen, right? Here's what I noticed:

1. **Day 1:** Felt a bit weird, like I was trying to join a secret club no one told me about. But hey, I could literally feel my stress levels dropping.

2. **Day 3:** Started adding this to every task switch. Email to meeting? Box breathing. Meeting to another cup of coffee I didn't need? Box breathing. ü•±

3. **Day 5:** My focus? Razor-sharp! I was tackling tasks like a ninja. Silent but effective. Suddenly, I was that person who plans ahead instead of finding out about deadlines the morning they‚Äôre due. üéØ

4. **Day 7:** Not just more focused, but so much *calmer*. It's like watering a wilting plant; only this time, the plant is my brain, being flooded with oxygen and serenity.

I had the energy to spare at the end of the day, and my usual post-work zone-out sessions turned into hobbies and quality time with loved ones. Score!

Thinking about giving box breathing a go? It‚Äôs free, takes a few minutes, and your mind will thank you for it. üåü

1lcq27o,https://www.reddit.com/r/TicketToEverywhere/comments/1lcq27o/best_backpack_for_air_travel/,Best Backpack For Air Travel,"Picture this: you're sprinting through Terminal C at Denver International, dragging a wheeled suitcase behind you while dodging other travelers and trying not to lose your boarding pass. The wheels catch on every crack in the floor, your shoulder aches from yanking the handle, and you're pretty sure you just took out someone's ankle with that sharp corner. Sound familiar?

There's a better way to travel, and it's sitting comfortably on the shoulders of smart travelers everywhere: the travel backpack. After testing dozens of bags and logging thousands of miles across six continents, we've identified the absolute best backpacks for air travel that will transform how you move through airports and explore destinations.

Whether you're a weekend warrior heading to Portland or a digital nomad bound for Bangkok, the right travel backpack will keep your hands free, your back happy, and your belongings organized. Let's dive into our top picks and help you find your perfect travel companion.

# Why Choose a Backpack Over Wheeled Luggage for Air Travel?

The rise of budget airlines and their increasingly strict size restrictions has made traditional wheeled luggage a gamble. But beyond avoiding those dreaded gate-check fees, travel backpacks offer genuine advantages that make them superior for most travelers.

Freedom of movement is the biggest game-changer. Try navigating narrow airplane aisles, crowded metro platforms, or cobblestone streets with a rolling bag‚Äîit's an exercise in frustration. With a quality travel backpack, you'll glide through these obstacles while your hands remain free for boarding passes, coffee, or that last-minute duty-free purchase.

Weight distribution also works in your favor. A well-designed travel backpack distributes weight across your strongest muscles‚Äîyour back and core‚Äîrather than forcing your arm and shoulder to do all the work. This becomes crucial during those unexpectedly long terminal walks or when your hotel room is up three flights of stairs.

Finally, versatility sets travel backpacks apart. Once you reach your destination, your backpack transforms into a day pack for hiking, city exploration, or beach days. Try doing that with your roller bag.

# Essential Features to Look for in a Travel Backpack

Not all backpacks are created equal, and choosing the wrong one can turn your dream trip into a nightmare of discomfort and disorganization. Here are the non-negotiable features we look for when testing travel backpacks.

# Size and Airline Compliance

Most major airlines allow carry-on dimensions of 22"" x 14"" x 9"", but budget carriers often impose stricter limits. We recommend targeting bags between 35-45 liters that compress down when necessary. Anything larger risks gate-checking, while smaller bags limit your packing potential.

# Weight Matters More Than You Think

With airline weight limits ranging from 15-22 pounds for carry-ons, your empty bag shouldn't eat up more than 3-4 pounds of that allowance. We've tested bags ranging from 2.2 pounds (ultralight champions) to 5+ pounds (feature-heavy tanks), and the weight difference becomes painfully obvious after an hour of carrying.

# Clamshell vs. Top-Loading Design

Clamshell backpacks open like a suitcase, giving you full access to your belongings without dumping everything out. Top-loading bags offer better weather protection but require more strategic packing. For air travel, we strongly favor clamshell designs‚Äîthey make airport security faster and hotel living much more civilized.

# Organization and Security Features

Look for dedicated laptop compartments, internal compression straps, and lockable zippers. The best travel backpacks include thoughtful details like water bottle pockets, quick-access front pouches, and hidden security pockets for valuables. External attachment points for jackets or gear are bonus features that prove surprisingly useful.

# Comfort Features

Padded shoulder straps and back panels are essential, but don't overlook hip belts and sternum straps for longer carries. Quality backpacks also include load-lifter straps that pull weight closer to your back, reducing fatigue significantly.

# Our Top Travel Backpack Recommendations

After extensive testing, these five backpacks represent the best options for different travel styles and budgets. Each has proven itself in real-world conditions, from cramped economy seats to remote hiking trails.

# Best Overall: Cotopaxi Allpa 35L Travel Pack

Price: $199 | Weight: 3.2 lbs | Dimensions: 21"" x 14"" x 8""

The Cotopaxi Allpa strikes the perfect balance between functionality, durability, and style. This clamshell-opening pack fits airline requirements easily while offering excellent organization through its four internal pockets and two external mesh compartments.

What we love: The suspended laptop compartment protects your tech without adding bulk, while the compression zippers let you expand or compress the bag based on your packing needs. The shoulder straps are surprisingly comfortable for extended carry, and the build quality feels bulletproof.

What could be better: The hip belt is removable but basic, and tall travelers might wish for slightly longer torso adjustment. The water bottle pocket is also a bit shallow for larger bottles.

Best for: Weekend getaways, urban travel, and anyone who values organization over maximum capacity.

# Best for Tech Professionals: Peak Design Travel Backpack 45L

Price: $299 | Weight: 4.5 lbs | Dimensions: 22"" x 13"" x 9.5"" (standard), 22"" x 13"" x 11"" (expanded)

Peak Design's Travel Backpack is engineering excellence wrapped in premium materials. The modular packing cubes integrate seamlessly with the bag's structure, creating the most organized travel experience we've tested. Camera and tech accessories have dedicated, protected spaces.

What we love: The external compression system and expandability mean this bag adapts to any trip length. Build quality is exceptional, with weather-resistant materials and lifetime craftsmanship. The laptop compartment fits 16-inch models easily.

What could be better: It's pricier than alternatives and heavier when empty. The complexity can be overwhelming for simple packers who just want to throw clothes in and go.

Best for: Digital nomads, photographers, and tech professionals who need maximum organization and premium build quality.

# Most Comfortable: Osprey Sojourn Porter 46L

Price: $269 | Weight: 4.8 lbs | Dimensions: 22"" x 14"" x 9""

Osprey's backpacking DNA shines in the Sojourn Porter's suspension system. This bag carries like a hiking pack but organizes like luggage, offering the best carrying comfort we've experienced in a travel backpack.

What we love: The padded hip belt and load-lifter straps make heavy loads feel manageable. Multiple grab handles and a robust compression system provide versatility. The clamshell design opens completely flat for easy packing.

What could be better: It's among the heavier options when empty, and the hiking-style aesthetic might not suit business travelers. Some organizational pockets run small.

Best for: Long-term travelers, those carrying heavier loads, and anyone prioritizing comfort over weight savings.

# Best Budget Option: Osprey Daylite Carry-On Travel Pack

Price: $149 | Weight: 2.2 lbs | Dimensions: 21"" x 13"" x 8""

Proof that great travel backpacks don't require breaking the bank, the Daylite Carry-On delivers essential features at an accessible price. Despite being the lightest pack we tested, it doesn't feel flimsy or cheap.

What we love: The featherweight construction saves precious pounds for your belongings. The clamshell design and internal compression straps work exactly as intended. The laptop compartment fits 16-inch models with room to spare.

What could be better: Organization is basic compared to pricier options, with fewer pockets and no hip belt. The shoulder straps, while adequate, lack the premium padding of more expensive bags.

Best for: Budget-conscious travelers, minimalist packers, and anyone flying weight-restricted airlines.

# Best for Business Travel: Thule Subterra 2 Travel Pack

Price: $229 | Weight: 4.1 lbs | Dimensions: 21.5"" x 13.5"" x 8.5""

The Subterra 2 bridges the gap between backpack and traditional luggage with its structured design and professional appearance. The removable laptop compartment doubles as a briefcase, making it perfect for business travelers.

What we love: The professional aesthetic won't look out of place in boardrooms or hotel lobbies. Organization is exceptional, with dedicated spaces for everything from cables to toiletries. The laptop compartment is removable and includes its own carrying strap.

What could be better: The structured design sacrifices some packability, and it's not the most comfortable for extended carrying. The price point puts it in premium territory without Peak Design's modularity.

Best for: Business travelers, anyone needing professional appearance, and those who want laptop bag functionality built-in.

# How to Choose the Right Size for Your Needs

Size selection depends more on your travel style than trip length. A well-organized 35L bag can handle a week-long business trip, while a poorly designed 45L bag might struggle with a weekend getaway.

For trips under one week, consider 35L or smaller. These bags fit easily under airplane seats as personal items with some airlines, potentially saving you from overhead bin space wars. They're also more comfortable for day-long sightseeing once you arrive.

For trips lasting 1-3 weeks, target the 40-45L sweet spot. This capacity handles diverse weather conditions and gives you shopping room without encouraging overpacking. Most options in this range remain carry-on compliant when properly packed.

For longer adventures or cold-weather travel, consider 45L+ options, but be prepared for potential gate-checking. The extra space becomes crucial when packing bulky items like winter coats or camping gear.

Remember: compression features can effectively reduce any bag's size by 15-20% when needed. Look for external compression straps and compression zippers that let you adapt your bag to airline requirements or packing loads.

# Pro Packing Tips for Backpack Travel

Packing a travel backpack efficiently requires different strategies than traditional luggage. These techniques, learned through years of trial and error, will maximize your space and keep everything organized.

Use packing cubes religiously. They're not optional for backpack travel‚Äîthey're essential. Compression packing cubes can reduce clothing volume by up to 30% while keeping everything organized. We recommend one cube for tops, one for bottoms, and a smaller one for undergarments.

Pack heavy items close to your back and in the middle section of the bag. This positioning improves balance and reduces strain. Laptops, cameras, and books should sit against the back panel, not bouncing around in exterior pockets.

Roll, don't fold most clothing items. Rolling creates more compact bundles and reduces wrinkles. The exception is structured items like blazers or dress shirts, which benefit from careful folding with tissue paper.

Utilize every pocket strategically. Keep frequently accessed items (passport, boarding pass, phone charger) in external quick-access pockets. Use internal mesh pockets for dirty laundry or shoes, and hidden pockets for valuables.

Wear your heaviest items on travel days. Instead of packing boots, wear them. Layer your heaviest jacket rather than stuffing it in the bag. This strategy saves pack weight and space while keeping you comfortable in air-conditioned terminals.

# Making Your Decision

The perfect travel backpack transforms how you experience travel, turning airport navigation from a chore into effortless movement. Based on our extensive testing, the Cotopaxi Allpa 35L offers the best combination of features, comfort, and value for most travelers.

For those needing maximum organization and premium materials, the Peak Design Travel Backpack 45L justifies its higher price through exceptional engineering and modular versatility. Budget-conscious travelers will find the Osprey Daylite Carry-On delivers essential features without compromise.

Remember: the best backpack is the one you'll actually use. Consider your travel patterns, comfort preferences, and organizational needs. A slightly heavier bag that you find comfortable beats an ultralight option that causes shoulder pain after an hour.

1lcq0lu,https://www.reddit.com/r/CharacterRant/comments/1lcq0lu/game_of_thrones_is_the_most_pointless_franchise/,Game of Thrones is the most pointless franchise ever made:,"Game of Thrones and A Song of Fire and Ice are *not* well-written stories. And George R.R. Martin is *not* a good writer.

Many people has said it before, but I don't care. I just want to a ask lot of questions about the franchise:

What's the point of the story? What's the point of A Song of Fire and Ice? What's the point of Game of Thrones? What's the point of Westeros?

*None!* There's *no* point! *At all!*

The moral grayness (nobody is entirely good or entirely evil), and the ""anyone can die"" setting were supposed to be GOT's main selling points, subverting some of the core themes of fantasy. Ironically enough, those two elements are what makes A Song of Fire and Ice such a pointless franchise.

Anyone can die, and thus, nobody has a plot armor. But how can I care about characters that are doomed to die at some point of the plot? How can I feel bad for a character's death if it will eventually happen. ""Anyone can die"" starts off as a novelty, but once the novelty dies, it becomes the norm. Instead of wondering myself ""Is this character going to die?"", I ask myself ""When will the character die?"".

Oh, and I'm not a big fan of ""anyone can die"" settings and killing characters way too early. If a character is going to die, I would prefer that character to have been developed and fleshed out well, and once the character has been developed, then shoot him/her. Because if I know next to nothing about a character, how can I feel bad for him/her? And if this is how I feel about *one* character death, imagine how I feel about *multiple* character deaths.

The moral grayness and the lack of good or evil? Bullshit. Yes, the world *is* way more complex than just black and white. There are many aspects in life that require more nuance than just good or evil. Not everyone is entirely good or entirely evil.

Nonetheless, ignoring the white and the black, and claiming everything is nuanced and gray, is just as unrealistic. Yes, some problems *are* complex and require nuance, but some aspects of life *are* unquestionably bad or unquestionably good. Some people and ideologies *are* unquestionably evil (I personally believe the real world is black or gray, which is why I'm not saying some people are unquestionably good). To say the entire world is gray is just as simplistic as saying the entire world is only black and white.

Almost everyone in A Song of Fire and Ice is an asshole, a corrupt, an idiot, and an arrogant piece of shit, with the only difference being how the characters express their asshole behaviour. And those who are closer to the label of ""heroic"" are portrayed as stupid and naive who won't survive in a cruel and grim and dark and """"""realistic"""""" world like Westeros. How can a feel compassion for a cast of characters that have zero morals and standards, because everyone in Westeros is a piece of crap? Why would I want to see Westeros being saved and thriving?

If anything, Westeros is one of those fictional worlds that actually deserve to be destroyed by the typical JRPG final boss. What's the point of trying to make story about saving the world and bringing an era of glory, when everyone is an asshole that deserves to die?

And here's a last one question:

How can people still be invested in a series of books that will *never finish?* George R.R. Martin will *never* finish his ""magnum opus"" ever, period! That's why the live-action adaptation of Game of Thrones had such a horrible ending that contradicted many of the themes that the fans love to brag about (anyone can die, no plot armor, gray vs gray morality, the so-called realism). Because the people working in the live-action ran out of the source material. And they needed to pull new stuff out of their asses.  
And what's the point of a series of books that will never finish? Every story needs a beginning, a climax, and an ending. But A Song of Fire and Ice doesn't have an ending. It will never had. Martin is way too busy drinking coffee in the Starbucks and ranting about how Tolkien is a better writer than him.

And since there is no point in a story that will never end, in a world where nobody deserves to be saved, because everyone is morally bankrupt under the excuse of ""realism"" and ""there's no true evil or true good"", and where everyone can die at any moment... A Song of Fire and Ice is the most pointless franchise ever made!

## What is Eternal Lunesta?

Eternal Lunesta is a **trading automation platform** that uses artificial intelligence to help users analyze the market and execute trades more efficiently. It‚Äôs designed to simplify the process for everyday users, while still offering enough depth for more experienced traders.

At its core, it‚Äôs a smart assistant for trading ‚Äî scanning the market in real-time, spotting patterns, and sending alerts or executing trades based on your preferences. You can trade everything from Bitcoin to traditional stocks, which adds flexibility most crypto-only bots don't offer.

## Who Created Eternal Lunesta?

The creators of Eternal Lunesta are a bit under the radar. Like many algorithmic trading platforms, it seems to be developed by a **team of fintech and AI specialists** rather than a single public figure. While transparency about the dev team could be better, this isn‚Äôt uncommon in the trading space ‚Äî even platforms like Immediate Edge and Bitcoin Era follow a similar model.

What matters more is that the platform is functional, updated regularly, and continues to gain traction among users who‚Äôve tested its features and found them intuitive and responsive.

### [üî• Start Trading with Eternal Lunesta Today](https://t.co/2BhD8HcCar)
## How Does Eternal Lunesta Work?

Eternal Lunesta uses **machine learning algorithms** to analyze large sets of market data in real time. Based on these patterns, it helps identify potentially profitable entry and exit points. You can either let it trade automatically on your behalf or use it more like a smart dashboard that suggests trades.

Here‚Äôs how it typically functions:

- You set your trading preferences: risk level, asset type, stop-loss, etc.
- The AI scans the market 24/7 and sends notifications or executes trades.
- You monitor your portfolio through a clean, easy-to-use interface.

If you‚Äôve used platforms like Immediate Edge or Bitcoin Code, the workflow feels pretty familiar ‚Äî but Eternal Lunesta‚Äôs interface is more modern, and the AI feels a bit more responsive.

## Eternal Lunesta Pros and Cons

Let‚Äôs break it down.

**Pros:**

- **Super beginner-friendly** ‚Äì The UI is smooth and intuitive.
- **Supports multiple assets** ‚Äì Not just crypto. You can trade stocks, commodities, etc.
- **Real-time data** ‚Äì Fast analysis and signals.
- **Mobile-friendly** ‚Äì Works well on phones and tablets.
- **Customizable alerts** ‚Äì You won‚Äôt miss critical market moves.

**Cons:**

- **Not fully transparent** about who‚Äôs behind it.
- **No regulatory oversight** ‚Äì Like many platforms in this niche.
- **Minimum deposit of $250** ‚Äì Might feel steep for casual dabblers.
- **Could over-rely on automation** ‚Äì Still best to monitor trades yourself.

## Eternal Lunesta ‚Äì Top Features

I love that you can open your browser and trade on the go. Whether you‚Äôre at a coffee shop or pretending to work at your 9‚Äì5, Eternal Lunesta fits right into your lifestyle.

### Customizable Alerts

You can set alerts for price changes, volume spikes, or specific asset movements. The platform won‚Äôt spam you, either ‚Äî just the alerts you want, when you need them.

It‚Äôs not just about crypto. Eternal Lunesta lets you trade:

- Bitcoin, Ethereum, altcoins
- Forex pairs
- Stocks and indices

This is a huge win if you like to diversify your portfolio without juggling multiple platforms.

## Is Eternal Lunesta a Scam?

Based on my experience and available info, **Eternal Lunesta doesn‚Äôt appear to be a scam**. It offers real features, a functional interface, and people are using it daily. That said, it‚Äôs not a magic money machine. You still need to understand market basics and manage your risk.

But if you‚Äôre comparing it to shady bots with fake testimonials and zero support, Eternal Lunesta is definitely a step above. Just don‚Äôt go all-in without doing your homework.

## What is the Minimum Deposit Required on Eternal Lunesta?

The **minimum deposit is $250** to get started. This is pretty standard across platforms like Bitcoin Code or Immediate Edge.

While it‚Äôs not pocket change, it‚Äôs also not outrageous. It‚Äôs enough to get your feet wet and test the platform without risking your life savings.

### Eternal Lunesta Customer Support

Support is solid. You can reach them via:

- **Live chat** ‚Äì usually fast responses
- **Email** ‚Äì replies within a few hours
- **FAQ section** ‚Äì answers most beginner questions

They don‚Äôt have phone support (yet), but the live chat is responsive enough that I didn‚Äôt miss it.

## How do you start trading on Eternal Lunesta?

### Step 1: Sign Up for a Free Account

Go to the official site and enter your name, email, and phone number. It only takes a couple of minutes.

### Step 2: Verify and Fund Your Account

You‚Äôll need to verify your email and ID (standard KYC stuff). Then make your initial deposit of $250 using a credit card, bank transfer, or crypto.

### Step 3: Start Trading

Once funded, you can use the demo mode to get familiar or jump into live trading. Customize your settings and let the AI do its thing ‚Äî or take manual control if that‚Äôs more your style.

## How to Delete an Eternal Lunesta Account?

If you ever want to close your account:

1. Log in and go to **Account Settings**
2. Click on **‚ÄúDelete Account‚Äù**
3. Confirm with support via email

Make sure you withdraw your funds first. Once your account is deleted, it‚Äôs permanent.

If you‚Äôre looking for something that‚Äôs beginner-friendly but still powerful, it‚Äôs definitely worth a shot. Just start small, learn the system, and don‚Äôt expect miracles. It‚Äôs a tool ‚Äî how well it works depends on how you use it.

We can chat on Reddit chat first, then after a bit of time move to Discord since it's nicer and more stable. I speak only Polish and English so far, but if you know any languages I'm interested in I'll be sure to let you know!

I'm a professional programmer (not a gamedev though, that's just a hobby) but if you aren't one I won't bore you or tell you anything (unless you want to hear, lol).

I am interested in a few foreign languages (inquire within) but neglected them lately... I am always on the look out for some anime partners. I don't own a powerful PC, just a decent laptop, so I am into older or indie games mainly. 

As for anime watching: I'd do it with screenshare on Discord, and use VC or text chat to talk as we watch. In general I like to be very outspoken and active when watching with someone, not just sit there in silence (that I can do myself, lol). We can watch something you or I or both of us saw before, or something new to both of us, all variations are fun (when we both saw it or didn't, or if one of us saw it and for other it's new).

I'm not too into live action series or movies, but I do have some favorites. My favorite Polish movie is a heist one, so it'd require subs or me live translating (there isn't that much spoken dialogue really and most of it is in short lines), if you wanted to see it.

I applied for a job back in March and didn‚Äôt hear anything back so I approached several people from the company on LinkedIn (large retailer) in May. One person got back to me and we had an intro call the following week. She explained they were going through a restructure and recruitment for that role has been paused, but there may be one vacancy in another team. She passed my details onto HR who then scheduled another call with me. They then advised me to apply for a role that had just appeared on their website. I applied then was finally invited to an actual interview. It went well and then they scheduled a case study presentation 2 weeks later. They were very impressed and had very few questions at the end. Coincidentally the hiring manager was in the same city later that week so we arranged to meet for coffee (everything at this stage had been virtual). She verbally said they are keen to offer me the role. Later that day I received a text message from her to say that her manager now wants a call with me but they are not available until the end of the month. At this stage I‚Äôm wondering what may be causing them to stall or whether it is just some internal stuff going on since they are restructuring.

Impact Hub Penha  
Chilled, friendly, a bit quieter. Lots of natural light. It feels like everyone there actually wants to know each other, but no forced vibes.

Impact Hub Baixa  
In the centre, so handy for lunch breaks or drinks after work. Still has that same Impact Hub vibe, values-driven, collaborative crowd.  
Tribe  
One of the best if you like knowing who you‚Äôre working next to. Met some really interesting people here. It‚Äôs smaller, but that‚Äôs part of the charm.

Time to Cowork  
Cosy and casual. If you just want a calm, welcoming spot to get your head down, this one‚Äôs lovely. Lots of expats

We usually see my in-laws every weekend, for a day or the whole weekend. They are Eastern European and this is typical for them. It‚Äôs been fine, and the best part is my kids really enjoy seeing them. But my MIL goes through waves of being very nice and tolerable, to being insufferable, critical, and vindictive. She can be hyper-critical, examines my moods, facial expressions, my skin (and tells me how to fix it), my home and garden, how I parent, when I should comfort my kids or leave them alone, how much I eat, etc. I try to remain constant throughout so my kids can see them consistently but I‚Äôm not sure what to do now. 

Last weekend we had a weekend trip planned- my husband and I took our kids to their summer house, 4 hours from us. My in-laws bailed after only a few hours of being there to check something at home and never came back (they live 1.5 hours from this summer house). I was really upset bc the house is terrible for kids and my husband and I would never have gone had it not been at his parents insistence. We were supposed to camp later that weekend but called it off bc we were so exhausted from the failed weekend- when my in-laws left they also left us to close up the house (drain the pipes, clean the fridge and freezer of stuff they left, clean the house, set mouse and rat traps, etc.)

So this past weekend was Father‚Äôs Day. My in-laws don‚Äôt really celebrate holidays. Christmas, Easter, Mother‚Äôs Day, Thanksgiving‚Ä¶ they have bailed on us for almost every holiday sometimes after I‚Äôve cleaned and cooked and entire meal, because holidays are very insignificant to them. We saw them for Mother‚Äôs Day on the Saturday before but more so because it was my MIL‚Äôs birthday. My husband and I finally went camping with our kids, it was successful and we had a great time.

His dad was texting him before we left telling him to bring our family to their summer house on our way to camp, when he can visit our camp, etc. My husband kept saying no, don‚Äôt plan on it this weekend bc we have a full weekend. When I gave the final no on Sunday, he got so upset. He told me I had never actually said no to seeing them (which I had, multiple times) and we got in a huge fight. We ended up leaving early and he cried on the way home. He desperately wanted to see his dad on Father‚Äôs Day now bc when we got service he texted his dad saying we‚Äôre not stopping by, and his dad was mad at him. 

I was clear, I said no multiple times, but my husband had wishful thinking. Even still, he told his parents we weren‚Äôt going to see them this weekend. Even still, when we drove home his parents were mad and ignored him the rest of the drive home.

I swear, some animals turn into Olympic gymnasts the second they see a pill. I‚Äôm currently watching a senior lab who needs three different meds daily, and it‚Äôs been a journey to figure out what works. So, here‚Äôs my hard-earned advice for getting those pills, drops, or injections in without losing your sanity (or your patience üòÖ).

1. **Know the pet‚Äôs routine:** before the sit starts, I always ask owners for a demo if the meds are complicated. One time, I didn‚Äôt, and I spent 20 minutes chasing a cat around trying to figure out how to use an ear dropper. Never again! Get details on timing, dosage, and whether the pet‚Äôs a pro or a drama queen about it.
2. **Hide pills like a pro:** for dogs, I‚Äôm all about pill pockets or wrapping the pill in a bit of cheese or some kind of p√¢t√©/soft food. I had a beagle who‚Äôd spit out pills unless I buried them in a meatball, worked like a charm. Cats are tougher, but I‚Äôve had luck crushing pills (with vet approval) and mixing them into wet food or tuna (or again hiding them in p√¢t√©).
3. **Stay calm and confident:** pets can smell fear, I swear. Now I take a deep breath, act like it‚Äôs no big deal, and move slow but steady. Works way better.
4. **Have a backup plan:** sometimes, plan A fails. I was sitting a dog who refused pill pockets, so I called the owner, and they suggested hiding the pill in a bit of hot dog. Saved the day! It's usually better to just ask the owner, after all they're the ones who know their pet best.
5. **Track everything:** I keep a little notebook to log every dose (you can also use the notes app on your phone). Writing it down keeps me on track, especially with multiple pets.
6. **Reward the pet (and yourself):** after meds, I give the pet a treat or some extra cuddles to make it a positive vibe. For me, it‚Äôs a coffee break after surviving the ordeal üòÇ.

1lcpnt9,https://www.reddit.com/r/SomaticExperiencing/comments/1lcpnt9/minimum_viable_somatic_exercise_to_experience/,Minimum viable somatic exercise to experience relief from freeze and go back to safety,"So i want to introduce this concept to you today, that helped me a lot battle against trauma & freeze response.

It‚Äôs largely inspired by the concept of ¬´¬†minimum viable product¬†¬ª (MVP) that exists in the startup world. Basically the idea is to bring to life a product that‚Äôs viable but very cheap to create in order to test the market (since startup usually don‚Äôt have money or they don‚Äôt want to risk too much in the beginning).

I own a startup myself and have been managing both the startup and my recovery at the same time in the last 18 months.

# The parallel between startup & trauma

I believe in trauma there is a clear parallel to this MVP, or at least that‚Äôs how I have approached somatic exercises.

The parallel is that the same way startup don‚Äôt have money (so low input) but they want to generate a high output (getting client to pay for their product), in trauma, at least in freeze which my dominance, we don‚Äôt have much energy available (low input) but we want a high output (the output is being back to a state of safety aka ending the freeze reponse).

Sometimes let‚Äôs be fair and say it the distance is high between the state of threat/freeze we are in and the state of safety we want to go back to.

It happened to me to spend literally 2 hours playing around with my body to come back to safety.

That‚Äôs why it‚Äôs great to find a method that‚Äôs both low input required and that produces a high output (so easy to start even when feeling overwhelmed, and to keep doing on a regular basis when needed). Methods that don‚Äôt match these criteria may leave the person in a catch-22 situation : I need to do X to and freeze feel safe again, but i don‚Äôt have the energy to do it since i‚Äôm in freeze.

# Easy downregulating methods vs hard downregulating methods

Because there are methods that may work to end a freeze response, but they require too much for someone who‚Äôs into freeze, these methods feels like forcing the body/fixing the body. It‚Äôs like ¬´¬†Ok i‚Äôm overwhelmed by freeze and i‚Äôm gonna force my body to end this¬†¬ª‚Ä¶This, in my experience, can work, but it does not feel good to act like this towards oneself i‚Äôd say.

**Methods that according to me require too much input to be realistically used in the context of freeze/being stuck are :**

* Doing a 1h yoga session : this is too long and feels too much like a procedure to me, it‚Äôs not enjoyable to do that when i‚Äôm completely overwhelmed
* Breathwork : don‚Äôt get me wrong, breathwork can be adapted to un-freeze, and I certainly ended some freeze responses by using breathwork. Yet i found it felt too forced, it felt too much like ¬´¬†ok not only i‚Äôm frozen and suffering, now I have to do something to end this¬†¬ª.
* Anything that involves the mind : the mind is overwhelmed and agitated badly when we‚Äôre in freeze, for the body does not feel safe. Hence any practice that involves the mind to a certain degree for me it‚Äôs going to suck too much energy. Guided meditation, guided yoga, anything that‚Äôs too much like a strict procedure to follow for the mind will not be sustainable for the long term, aka it will too demanding in the moment, when we‚Äôre frozen.

**Methods that worked because they required really the minimum input from me and produced a maximum input :**

* somatic intuitive moves at home, in a relative darkness, with candles, incense and prosodic sounds (see how I add a lot to the environment around the body to help it feel safe)
* Chi kong like pushes something away with both arms very slowly, very slow moves, to allow myself to feel my body again, little by little, without clear structure of instruction (so intuitive moves as well here, unambitious moves)
* Walks in nature in the morning, alone with my own thoughts (no phone), to drink my coffee and slowly connect with the environment around me. We could call this meditative walks. Especially incline walking (i live near mountains/hills) stimulate psoas muscles which is good when there is freeze. Helps reconnect with the body and helped a lot with irregular bowel movements

So yes my point overall is if you experience freeze, it‚Äôs important to realize it‚Äôs extremely unbearable to live this, and we better we gentle with ourselves and, to end freeze, do stuff that feel great from minute one, not minute 30 or minute 60 (think ¬´¬†instant relief practices¬†¬ª or acronymed IRP)

Having this mindset helped me remove stuff from my typical days that actually were what i‚Äôd call ¬´¬†flowbreakers¬†¬ª (non IRP) and replace them with others that didnt feel like ¬´¬†flowbreakers¬†¬ª (IRP).",6,1750070970.0,SomaticExperiencing,0,1.0,False

We usually see my in-laws every weekend, for a day or the whole weekend. They are Eastern European and this is typical for them. It‚Äôs been fine, and the best part is my kids really enjoy seeing them. But my MIL goes through waves of being very nice and tolerable, to being insufferable, critical, and vindictive. She can be hyper-critical, examines my moods, facial expressions, my skin (and tells me how to fix it), my home and garden, how I parent, when I should comfort my kids or leave them alone, how much I eat, etc. I try to remain constant throughout so my kids can see them consistently but I‚Äôm not sure what to do now. 

Last weekend we had a weekend trip planned- my husband and I took our kids to their summer house, 4 hours from us. My in-laws bailed after only a few hours of being there to check something at home and never came back (they live 1.5 hours from this summer house). I was really upset bc the house is terrible for kids and my husband and I would never have gone had it not been at his parents insistence. We were supposed to camp later that weekend but called it off bc we were so exhausted from the failed weekend- when my in-laws left they also left us to close up the house (drain the pipes, clean the fridge and freezer of stuff they left, clean the house, set mouse and rat traps, etc.)

So this past weekend was Father‚Äôs Day. My in-laws don‚Äôt really celebrate holidays. Christmas, Easter, Mother‚Äôs Day, Thanksgiving‚Ä¶ they have bailed on us for almost every holiday sometimes after I‚Äôve cleaned and cooked and entire meal, because holidays are very insignificant to them. We saw them for Mother‚Äôs Day on the Saturday before but more so because it was my MIL‚Äôs birthday. My husband and I finally went camping with our kids, it was successful and we had a great time. But with 2 under 2 it was a ton of packing, logistics, the site was on the water and in the woods so 100% supervision was required the whole time. I really enjoyed it but it was a lot of work.

They would expect me to host lunch and coffee and that would mean me using all of the meat we brought for the weekend to feed them, and making coffee for them with my little camping stove and filter on a rickety picnic table.

As Emily disappeared down the street, Vivian let out a soft sigh, tilting her head in a delicate display of confusion. I really don‚Äôt know why Emily is so hostile toward me, ‚Äùshe murmured, her voice laced with just the right amount of gentle concern. Lucas, still irritated from the encounter, scoffed.‚Äú You don‚Äôt need to waste your energy thinking about her.„ÄÄVivian hesitated, then bit her lip, as if torn. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs just‚Ä¶I don‚Äôt want there to be any misunderstandings.„ÄÄLucas arched a brow. ‚ÄúMisunderstandings?‚Äù  
Vivian sighed again, brushing her fingers lightly against the fabric of her dress.‚ÄúFor example, this outfit Emily was wearing today‚Äîit‚Äôs identical to the one I picked out for next week‚Äôs A Designs campaign shoot. She turned to Lucas, her eyes wide with feigned innocence. ‚ÄúI really hope she doesn‚Äôt think I copied her again. That would be so unfortunate. Lucas frowned.‚ÄúWait‚Äîyou‚Äôre saying Emily‚Äôs dress is the same one you planned to wear for the campaign? Vivian nodded slowly, as if the thought had only just occurred to her.‚ÄúYes‚Ä¶the exact same.„ÄÄShe let the words linger just long enough.„ÄÄLucas‚Äôs expression hardened instantly.‚ÄúSo what? That‚Äôs not your problem.„ÄÄVivian blinked, as if caught off guard by his sharp tone.„ÄÄLucas crossed his arms, his voice turning dismissive. ‚ÄúYou picked your outfit first. There‚Äôs no reason for you to change it. If Emily gets upset, that‚Äôs on her.‚Äù  
„ÄÄVivian lowered her gaze, letting a small, conflicted smile play at her lips.‚ÄúBut‚Ä¶you know how she is. She always thinks I‚Äôm the one imitating her.„ÄÄLucas waved a hand in irritation.‚ÄúLet her think whatever she wants. You know what I think? She‚Äôs just jealous.„ÄÄVivian stayed quiet.„ÄÄLucas took a step closer, his voice lowering slightly, as if sharing a private truth.‚ÄúMike had a crush on you in high school. In his eyes, you‚Äôve always been the best-looking.‚Äù  
  
„ÄÄ„ÄÄVivian didn‚Äôt respond immediately.  
  
„ÄÄ„ÄÄInstead, she let the words sink in, her lips curving ever so slightly, a silent acknowledgment.  
  
„ÄÄ„ÄÄShe didn‚Äôt have to say anything.  
  
„ÄÄ„ÄÄHer silence was answer enough.  
  
„ÄÄ„ÄÄLucas grinned, satisfied, before adding,‚ÄúSo don‚Äôt worry about Emily. Just go ahead with what you planned.‚Äù  
  
„ÄÄ„ÄÄVivian finally looked up, offering Lucas a small, appreciative smile.‚ÄúYou really think so?‚Äù  
  
„ÄÄ„ÄÄLucas nodded firmly.‚ÄúI know so.‚Äù  
  
„ÄÄ„ÄÄAnd just like that, the seed was planted.  
  
„ÄÄ„ÄÄBecause next week, when she appeared in the exact same dress Emily had worn today, in front of cameras, in an official campaign‚Ä¶  
  
„ÄÄ„ÄÄPeople wouldn‚Äôt see Vivian copying Emily.  
  
„ÄÄ„ÄÄThey‚Äôd see Emily as the one following behind her.  
  
„ÄÄ„ÄÄAnd that thought alone made her smile just a little wider.  
  
„ÄÄ„ÄÄ\-  
  
„ÄÄ„ÄÄThe night air was quiet when Emily finally returned home, the weight of the day still lingering in her chest.  
  
She walked into Adrian‚Äôs study, setting her bag down before carefully pulling out the damaged cufflink box.  
  
The dent in the packaging was unmistakable.  
  
Her fingers traced over the flaw, frustration tightening in her chest. She had wanted everything to be perfect.  
  
Adrian had asked her to do something so simple, yet somehow, she had let it get ruined.  
  
But instead of dwelling on it, she took a deep breath,then flattened the surface as best as she could.  
  
Her gaze swept the room until she spotted a set of fine paints and brushes.  
  
They were hers‚Äîneatly arranged on a nearby shelf, as if someone had thoughtfully unpacked them and placed them there, seamlessly integrating them into the space.  
  
She hesitated only briefly before taking them.  
  
If she couldn‚Äôt replace the box, she could at least turn it into something uniquely his.  
  
She dipped the brush into the paint, the soft bristles soaking up the deep hues.  
  
Then, slowly, she began to paint.  
  
„ÄÄ  
  


# Chapter 24 Not Yours to Question

A soft rustling of fabric stirred the quiet air.  
  
„ÄÄ„ÄÄAdrian had returned home.  
  
„ÄÄ„ÄÄThe study was dimly lit, and as he stepped inside, his sharp gaze immediately landed on the figure sprawled over his desk.  
  
„ÄÄ„ÄÄEmily.  
  
„ÄÄ„ÄÄShe had fallen asleep, her cheek resting lightly against her folded arms, the soft glow of the desk lamp casting a gentle warmth over her features.  
  
„ÄÄ„ÄÄFor a moment, he simply stood there, his expression unreadable.  
  
„ÄÄ„ÄÄThen, his eyes flickered to the desk.  
  
„ÄÄ„ÄÄScattered across the surface were brushes, tubes of paint, and the cufflink box‚Äînow adorned with delicate strokes of color.  
  
„ÄÄ„ÄÄHe stepped closer.  
  
„ÄÄ„ÄÄEmily had painted over the damaged area with intricate detail, transforming the flaw into something uniquely beautiful.  
  
„ÄÄ„ÄÄAdrian‚Äôs gaze softened.  
  
„ÄÄ„ÄÄShe did all this‚Ä¶for him?  
  
„ÄÄ„ÄÄJust as he reached for the box, Emily stirred.  
  
„ÄÄ„ÄÄHer lashes fluttered open, her sleepy gaze meeting his.  
  
„ÄÄ„ÄÄFor a moment, neither of them spoke.  
  
„ÄÄ„ÄÄThen Adrian‚Äôs voice, low and gentle, broke the silence.  
  
„ÄÄ„ÄÄ‚ÄúWhy aren‚Äôt you resting in your room?‚Äù  
  
„ÄÄ„ÄÄEmily blinked, sitting up slightly.  
  
„ÄÄ„ÄÄ‚ÄúI was waiting for the paint to dry,‚Äùshe murmured, rubbing her eyes.  
  
„ÄÄ„ÄÄAdrian‚Äôs lips curved slightly, his tone amused.‚ÄúFor me?‚Äù  
  
„ÄÄ„ÄÄShe followed his gaze to the box, then sat up straighter.‚ÄúOh‚Äîuh, yeah. The original packaging got damaged, so I thought I‚Äôd try to fix it. I‚Äôm sorry about that.‚Äù  
  
„ÄÄ„ÄÄAdrian picked up the box, running his fingers lightly over the painted surface.  
  
„ÄÄ„ÄÄHis expression didn‚Äôt shift.  
  
„ÄÄ„ÄÄThen, softly‚Äî‚ÄúDon‚Äôt apologize.‚Äù  
  
„ÄÄ„ÄÄEmily blinked at him.  
  
„ÄÄ„ÄÄAdrian lifted the box slightly.‚ÄúI like it. A lot.‚Äù  
  
„ÄÄ„ÄÄShe exhaled a small breath of relief.‚ÄúIt‚Äôs an artist‚Äôs limited edition set, though‚Ä¶Next time, I‚Äôll find another special box for you.‚Äù  
  
„ÄÄ„ÄÄAdrian‚Äôs gaze never left hers as he said,‚ÄúThis is already one of a kind.‚Äù  
  
„ÄÄ„ÄÄHer chest tightened slightly at that.  
  
„ÄÄ„ÄÄHe always knew exactly what to say.  
  
„ÄÄ„ÄÄEmily hesitated for a moment, then murmured,‚ÄúThank you.‚Äù  
  
„ÄÄ„ÄÄAdrian took a slow step closer, lifting a hand.  
  
„ÄÄ„ÄÄBefore she could react, his fingers gently brushed a stray strand of hair behind her ear.  
  
„ÄÄ„ÄÄHis touch was warm, careful.  
  
„ÄÄ„ÄÄTheir eyes met‚Äî  
  
„ÄÄ„ÄÄAnd for a brief second, Emily forgot how to breathe.  
  
„ÄÄ„ÄÄThen, his voice dropped to a quiet murmur.  
  
„ÄÄ„ÄÄ‚ÄúNo, Emily. Thank you.‚Äù  
  
„ÄÄ„ÄÄ\-  
  
„ÄÄ„ÄÄEmily stepped into A Designs for what she knew would be one of her final days here.  
  
The familiar scent of polished wood and paper, the hum of designers working on their projects, the quiet conversations filling the air‚Äîall of it felt the same.  
  
And yet, something had shifted.  
  
She wasn‚Äôt here to stay.  
  
She was here to finish what she started‚Äîto wrap up her last projects before leaving this place behind for good.  
  
As she made her way to the design department, heads immediately turned.  
  
‚ÄúEmily! Thank god you‚Äôre back,‚Äù one of the designers rushed over, relieved.  
  
Emily raised a brow. ‚ÄúWhy? What happened?‚Äù  
  
Another colleague let out a dramatic sigh. ‚ÄúOh, you wouldn‚Äôt believe it. Vivian‚Äôs designs‚Äîan absolute disaster. We don‚Äôt even know how she got this job.‚Äù  
  
Someone else nodded in agreement. ‚ÄúShe‚Äôs been clinging to Mike constantly, acting like she runs the place.‚Äù  
  
Emily kept her expression neutral. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs none of my business anymore.‚Äù  
  
The group stared at her, surprised.  
  
‚ÄúWait‚Ä¶ what do you mean?‚Äù one of them asked.  
  
Before Emily could answer‚Äî  
  
A low, familiar voice interrupted.  
  
‚ÄúSo, you‚Äôve finally decided to stop throwing a tantrum and come back to work?‚Äù  
  
Emily‚Äôs shoulders tensed.  
  
She turned‚Äî  
  
And there stood Mike.  
  
Arms crossed, smirking like he still had some hold over her.  
  
And behind him‚ÄîVivian.  
  
She stood close to Mike, her posture effortlessly casual, as if she belonged at his side.  
  
‚ÄúEmily, we‚Äôre going out for lunch,‚Äù Vivian chimed in sweetly. ‚ÄúDo you want to come?‚Äù  
  
Emily didn‚Äôt even hesitate. ‚ÄúNo.‚Äù  
  
Mike frowned slightly. ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs with the attitude?‚Äù he asked, his tone laced with irritation. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôve been acting strange lately.‚Äù  
  
Emily opened her mouth to respond‚Äî  
  
But before she could, a voice from the reception area called out.  
  
‚ÄúMiss Carter, a food delivery for you. It‚Äôs from someone named Blackwood.‚Äù  
  
Silence.  
  
The entire design department went still.  
  
Emily could feel several pairs of eyes subtly shifting toward her.  
  
Mike‚Äôs expression darkened.  
  
‚ÄúYou went to Lila again?‚Äù he asked, his voice edged with frustration.  
  
Emily frowned. ‚ÄúWhat?‚Äù  
  
Mike let out a bitter chuckle. ‚ÄúYou always do this, Emily. Every time something goes wrong, you run straight to Lila for help.‚Äù  
  
Emily simply stared at him.  
  
For years, Mike had believed he understood her best.  
  
He thought he could predict her every move, that she would always come back.  
  
But this time, he was wrong.  
  
And he had no idea just how wrong.  
  
Without another word, Emily turned on her heel and walked away‚Äîleaving Mike and Vivian standing in the middle of the office, staring after her.  
  


# Chapter 25 Not So Sudden After All

Emily stepped into the company lounge, balancing the neatly wrapped meal in her hands.  
  
„ÄÄ„ÄÄShe unfolded the packaging, revealing an exquisitely arranged lunch.  
  
„ÄÄ„ÄÄA delicate seafood bisque, still warm and rich with flavor.  
  
„ÄÄ„ÄÄTender slices of seared beef, arranged atop a bed of creamy truffle mashed potatoes.  
  
„ÄÄ„ÄÄA fresh, vibrant salad with edible flowers, lightly dressed in citrus vinaigrette.  
  
„ÄÄ„ÄÄA small dessert‚Äîa handcrafted dark chocolate tart, topped with gold flakes.  
  
„ÄÄ„ÄÄA small white note was tucked inside.  
  
„ÄÄ„ÄÄ‚ÄúYou didn‚Äôt eat much this morning. Don‚Äôt go hungry.‚Äù  
  
„ÄÄ„ÄÄEmily paused, running her fingers over the paper.  
  
„ÄÄ„ÄÄShe didn‚Äôt need to guess.  
  
„ÄÄ„ÄÄThis was Adrian.  
  
„ÄÄ„ÄÄAnd from the very first bite, she knew the food was made by his private chef.  
  
„ÄÄ„ÄÄShe had eaten this chef‚Äôs cooking several times now.  
  
„ÄÄ„ÄÄAnd each time,it was perfect.  
  
„ÄÄ„ÄÄBy the time she finished the meal, she felt warm, full, and strangely taken care of.  
  
„ÄÄ„ÄÄWithout overthinking it, she pulled out her phone and sent a quick text.  
  
„ÄÄ„ÄÄEmily:It was delicious. Thank you. Have you eaten yet?  
  
„ÄÄ„ÄÄA response came almost immediately.  
  
„ÄÄ„ÄÄAdrian sent a photo.  
  
„ÄÄ„ÄÄA luxurious, dimly lit restaurant.  
  
„ÄÄ„ÄÄA polished wooden table.  
  
„ÄÄ„ÄÄAnd in front of him‚Äîa glass of whiskey and a glass of red wine.  
  
„ÄÄ„ÄÄAdrian:Having drinks with Richard Cross He‚Äôs the CEO of Cross Enterprises.  
  
„ÄÄ„ÄÄEmily‚Äôs brows lifted slightly.  
  
„ÄÄ„ÄÄEmily:Don‚Äôt drink too much. I‚Äôll be done with work at 4. I‚Äôll come find you.  
  
„ÄÄ„ÄÄAcross the city, in an exclusive private lounge, Adrian glanced at his phone, his lips curling slightly.  
  
„ÄÄ„ÄÄRichard, sitting across from him, arched a brow.‚ÄúSomething amusing?‚Äù  
  
„ÄÄ„ÄÄAdrian set his glass down smoothly.‚ÄúI should pace myself. My wife will come later.‚Äù  
  
„ÄÄ„ÄÄRichard nearly choked on his drink.‚ÄúWife?‚Äù  
  
„ÄÄ„ÄÄHis shock was immediate,and justified.  
  
„ÄÄ„ÄÄAdrian Blackwood was notoriously private.  
  
„ÄÄ„ÄÄAnd now he had a wife?  
  
„ÄÄ„ÄÄRichard studied him for a long moment, then smirked.‚ÄúI had no idea you got married. And here I thought you only loved your business.‚Äù  
  
„ÄÄ„ÄÄAdrian didn‚Äôt respond directly, but his gaze was calm, unwavering.‚ÄúPlans change.‚Äù  
  
„ÄÄ„ÄÄRichard swirled his whiskey thoughtfully.‚ÄúNow I‚Äôm even more curious. What kind of woman managed to pull this off?‚Äù  
  
„ÄÄ„ÄÄLater, Emily arrived at the restaurant, stepping into the warm, elegant atmosphere.  
  
„ÄÄ„ÄÄIt didn‚Äôt take long to spot Adrian.  
  
„ÄÄ„ÄÄAnd the moment Richard saw her, his expression shifted,not with simple curiosity, but recognition.  
  
„ÄÄ„ÄÄBecause now, he remembered something.  
  
„ÄÄ„ÄÄA few years ago, when he had met Adrian abroad for a deal, he had briefly seen a photo tucked inside Adrian‚Äôs wallet.  
  
„ÄÄ„ÄÄHe hadn‚Äôt paid much attention back then.  
  
„ÄÄ„ÄÄBut now, looking at Emily, it all made sense.  
  
„ÄÄ„ÄÄThis wasn‚Äôt sudden.  
  
„ÄÄ„ÄÄThis wasn‚Äôt random.  
  
„ÄÄ„ÄÄThis had been years in the making.  
  
„ÄÄ„ÄÄRichard‚Äôs gaze flickered to Adrian, a knowing look crossing his features.  
  
„ÄÄ„ÄÄ‚ÄúI see now,‚Äùhe mused lightly.‚ÄúIt all adds up.‚Äù  
  
„ÄÄ„ÄÄAdrian simply lifted a brow.‚ÄúDoes it?‚Äù  
  
„ÄÄ„ÄÄRichard chuckled, standing up.‚ÄúPleasure meeting you, Emily. I hope we‚Äôll have a chance to talk more soon.‚Äù  
  
„ÄÄ„ÄÄEmily smiled politely.‚ÄúLikewise.‚Äù  
  
„ÄÄ„ÄÄWith that, she took Adrian‚Äôs arm, gently leading him away.  
  
„ÄÄ„ÄÄAnd as they stepped outside, into the cool evening air.  
  
„ÄÄ„ÄÄShe still had no idea just how deep Adrian‚Äôs feelings for her ran.  
  
„ÄÄ„ÄÄ\-  
  
„ÄÄ„ÄÄThe city lights flickered past as Emily drove them home, the soft hum of the engine filling the quiet space between them.  
  
„ÄÄ„ÄÄShe glanced sideways at Adrian, who sat in the passenger seat, his long fingers resting lightly against his temple, eyes half-lidded.  
  
„ÄÄ„ÄÄStill composed. Still unreadable.  
  
„ÄÄ„ÄÄShe smirked, deciding to tease him a little.  
  
„ÄÄ„ÄÄ‚ÄúI think I did a great job back there,‚Äùshe said playfully.‚ÄúYour friend definitely believes we‚Äôre a real married couple now.‚Äù  
  
„ÄÄ„ÄÄAdrian didn‚Äôt respond immediately.  
  
„ÄÄ„ÄÄWhen she turned to look at him again‚Äîhis expression had changed.  
  
„ÄÄ„ÄÄThe usual ease in his demeanor had vanished, replaced by something darker, more unreadable.  
  
„ÄÄ„ÄÄHe stayed silent for so long that Emily finally frowned.  
  
„ÄÄ„ÄÄ‚ÄúAdrian?‚Äù  
  
„ÄÄ„ÄÄStill no answer.  
  
„ÄÄ„ÄÄThen, at last, in a low voice‚Äî‚ÄúI think I might be a little drunk.‚Äù  
  
„ÄÄ„ÄÄEmily blinked.‚ÄúHuh? But you were fine just now.‚Äù  
  
„ÄÄ„ÄÄAdrian exhaled slowly, tilting his head back against the seat.  
  
„ÄÄ„ÄÄ‚ÄúMaybe it‚Äôs delayed.‚Äù  
  
„ÄÄ„ÄÄEmily hummed in thought.  
  
„ÄÄ„ÄÄShe supposed that made sense. Some alcohols hit differently after a while.  
  


# Chapter 26 A Drunken Mistake‚Ä¶ Or Something More?

As soon as they entered the penthouse, Adrian loosened the top buttons of his shirt, his movements slower than usual.  
  
„ÄÄ„ÄÄ‚ÄúI‚Äôm going to take a shower,‚Äùhe murmured.  
  
„ÄÄ„ÄÄEmily nodded.‚ÄúOkay, I‚Äôll wait on the couch.‚Äù  
  
„ÄÄ„ÄÄShe had barely sat down when the bathroom door creaked open slightly.  
  
„ÄÄ„ÄÄ‚ÄúEmily.‚Äù  
  
„ÄÄ„ÄÄHis deep voice carried through the air.  
  
„ÄÄ„ÄÄShe turned her head.‚ÄúWhat?‚Äù  
  
„ÄÄ„ÄÄThe door opened just enough for his hand to slip through.  
  
„ÄÄ„ÄÄ‚ÄúI forgot to bring my clothes.‚Äù  
  
„ÄÄ„ÄÄEmily let out a soft laugh.‚ÄúReally? You always seem so well-prepared.‚Äù  
  
„ÄÄ„ÄÄAdrian didn‚Äôt respond, simply waiting.  
  
„ÄÄ„ÄÄShaking her head, she got up and walked toward his walk-in closet.  
  
„ÄÄ„ÄÄHis suits and shirts were arranged with sharp precision, each piece reflecting his meticulous nature.  
  
„ÄÄ„ÄÄShe grabbed a set of dark-colored sleepwear and returned to the bathroom, pushing the door open slightly to pass them through.  
  
„ÄÄ„ÄÄExcept‚Äî  
  
„ÄÄ„ÄÄHer fingers froze on the fabric.  
  
„ÄÄ„ÄÄAdrian wasn‚Äôt standing by the door.  
  
„ÄÄ„ÄÄHe was already in the shower, completely bare.  
  
„ÄÄ„ÄÄHis back to her.  
  
„ÄÄ„ÄÄDroplets of water slid down the sharp lines of his spine, trailing over the defined muscles of his back, disappearing along the deep grooves of his waist.  
  
„ÄÄ„ÄÄHer throat went dry.  
  
„ÄÄ„ÄÄThe steam curled around him, clinging to his skin‚Äîtoo much, too close.  
  
„ÄÄ„ÄÄShe snapped her gaze away, her face burning.  
  
„ÄÄ„ÄÄ‚ÄúI‚Äîuh, I left your clothes here!‚Äùshe blurted, setting them down on the counter.  
  
„ÄÄ„ÄÄShe turned to bolt out of the room.  
  
„ÄÄ„ÄÄ\-  
  
„ÄÄ„ÄÄEmily busied herself in the kitchen, preparing a simple sober-up tea.  
  
„ÄÄ„ÄÄHer mind still lingered on the shower scene, and she shook her head hard to clear it.  
  
„ÄÄ„ÄÄShe carried the tea to his bedroom.  
  
„ÄÄ„ÄÄThe lights were dim now, casting soft shadows across the room.  
  
„ÄÄ„ÄÄAdrian was already lying on the bed, his damp golden hair tousled, his eyes closed.  
  
„ÄÄ„ÄÄEmily exhaled softly and stepped closer.  
  
„ÄÄ„ÄÄ‚ÄúAdrian, I made you some tea. Drink a little.‚Äù  
  
„ÄÄ„ÄÄNo response.  
  
„ÄÄ„ÄÄShe frowned, leaning in slightly.‚ÄúHey, wake up.‚Äù  
  
„ÄÄ„ÄÄStill nothing.  
  
„ÄÄ„ÄÄShe reached out to gently shake him‚Äî  
  
„ÄÄ„ÄÄSuddenly, a firm grip closed around her wrist.  
  
„ÄÄ„ÄÄBefore she could react, Adrian pulled her forward.  
  
„ÄÄ„ÄÄShe gasped, losing her balance‚Äî  
  
„ÄÄ„ÄÄAnd fell against his chest.  
  
„ÄÄ„ÄÄHer breath caught.  
  
„ÄÄ„ÄÄHis skin was warm, his scent intoxicatingly fresh from the shower.  
  
„ÄÄ„ÄÄHer mind scrambled to make sense of the situation.  
  
„ÄÄ„ÄÄ‚ÄúA-Adrian, you‚Äî‚Äù  
  
„ÄÄ„ÄÄHe shifted beneath her, rolling over, pinning her against the bed.  
  
„ÄÄ„ÄÄHer pulse skyrocketed.  
  
„ÄÄ„ÄÄThe weight of his body pressed her into the mattress, his hands firm but unhurried as they traced up her arms, past her shoulders, finally cupping her face.  
  
„ÄÄ„ÄÄEmily‚Äôs heart pounded violently against her ribs.  
  
„ÄÄ„ÄÄAnd then, before she could say anything‚Äî  
  
„ÄÄ„ÄÄHis lips were on hers.  
  
„ÄÄ„ÄÄWarm. Slow.  
  
„ÄÄ„ÄÄA kiss that wasn‚Äôt demanding‚Äîbut deliberate.  
  
„ÄÄ„ÄÄShe gasped against him, her fingers instinctively gripping his shirt, but he didn‚Äôt stop.  
  
„ÄÄ„ÄÄInstead, he deepened the kiss, his lips coaxing, teasing‚Äî  
  
„ÄÄ„ÄÄUntil she realized‚Äî  
  
„ÄÄ„ÄÄShe was kissing him back.  
  
„ÄÄ„ÄÄA low sound rumbled from his chest, his fingers sliding to the base of her neck, tilting her chin higher as he kissed her deeper.  
  
„ÄÄ„ÄÄEmily‚Äôs mind spun wildly.  
  
„ÄÄ„ÄÄThis wasn‚Äôt happening.  
  
„ÄÄ„ÄÄHe‚Äôs drunk, Emily.  
  
„ÄÄ„ÄÄBut he didn‚Äôt kiss like a drunk man.  
  
„ÄÄ„ÄÄHis mouth moved with purpose, his body pressing against hers with slow, intoxicating heat.  
  
„ÄÄ„ÄÄAnd then‚Äîhis lips left hers.  
  
„ÄÄ„ÄÄJust for a moment.  
  
„ÄÄ„ÄÄOnly to trail downward.  
  
„ÄÄ„ÄÄEmily shivered as his mouth brushed over the curve of her jaw, down the delicate skin of her neck.  
  
„ÄÄ„ÄÄHe lingered there, lips grazing her pulse point, his breath hot and uneven.  
  
„ÄÄ„ÄÄ‚ÄúAdrian,‚Äùshe whispered, barely able to form the words.  
  
„ÄÄ„ÄÄHe didn‚Äôt stop.  
  
„ÄÄ„ÄÄHis lips ghosted lower, pressing against the curve where her neck met her shoulder.  
  
„ÄÄ„ÄÄ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre drunk,‚Äùshe finally managed to say.  
  
„ÄÄ„ÄÄThat made him pause.  
  
„ÄÄ„ÄÄFor a brief second, he didn‚Äôt move.  
  
„ÄÄ„ÄÄThen, with a slow exhale, he finally pulled back.  
  
„ÄÄ„ÄÄTheir eyes met in the dim light.  
  
„ÄÄ„ÄÄEmily felt something heavy in his gaze, something she couldn‚Äôt quite name.  
  
„ÄÄ„ÄÄBut he said nothing.  
  
„ÄÄ„ÄÄInstead, she reached for the tea, her hands slightly shaky.  
  
„ÄÄ„ÄÄ‚ÄúDrink this,‚Äùshe murmured.  
  
„ÄÄ„ÄÄAdrian watched her carefully, his piercing blue eyes never leaving her face.  
  
„ÄÄ„ÄÄThen, after a long pause‚Äî  
  
„ÄÄ„ÄÄHe took the cup.  
  
„ÄÄ„ÄÄAnd drank.  
  
„ÄÄ„ÄÄEmily let out a breath, relieved.  
  
„ÄÄ„ÄÄShe stood abruptly, needing distance.‚ÄúYou sleep here. I‚Äôll stay in the guest room.‚Äù  
  
„ÄÄ„ÄÄShe didn‚Äôt wait for his response.  
  
„ÄÄ„ÄÄDidn‚Äôt wait to see if he would try to stop her.  
  
„ÄÄ„ÄÄShe turned and walked out of the room‚Äîfast.  
  


# Chapter 27 Acting Like Nothing Happened

Emily collapsed onto the bed, staring at the ceiling, her heart still racing.  
  
„ÄÄ„ÄÄHer fingers brushed against her lips, as if to erase the lingering heat from his kiss.  
  
„ÄÄ„ÄÄBut the problem was‚Äîshe didn‚Äôt want to erase it.  
  
„ÄÄ„ÄÄShe squeezed her eyes shut.  
  
„ÄÄ„ÄÄHe‚Äôs drunk.  
  
„ÄÄ„ÄÄThat was the only explanation.  
  
„ÄÄ„ÄÄThat was the only thing that made sense.  
  
„ÄÄ„ÄÄAnd yet‚Äî  
  
„ÄÄ„ÄÄEven as she told herself that, she couldn‚Äôt ignore the way her entire body still burned from his touch.  
  
„ÄÄ„ÄÄShe turned onto her side, burying her face in the pillow.  
  
„ÄÄ„ÄÄBut no matter how hard she tried‚Äî  
  
„ÄÄ„ÄÄShe couldn‚Äôt forget the way he kissed her.  
  
„ÄÄ„ÄÄCouldn‚Äôt forget how it felt when his lips touched her skin.  
  
„ÄÄ„ÄÄAnd worst of all‚Äî  
  
„ÄÄ„ÄÄShe couldn‚Äôt forget the way her body had responded.  
  
„ÄÄ„ÄÄIt took a long time for sleep to come.  
  
„ÄÄ„ÄÄ\-  
  
„ÄÄ„ÄÄThe next morning, Emily woke to the smell of something warm and familiar drifting through the air.  
  
„ÄÄ„ÄÄShe rubbed the sleep from her eyes and stepped out of the guest room, following the scent toward the dining area.  
  
„ÄÄ„ÄÄOn the table, a beautifully arranged breakfast awaited her‚Äîfreshly baked croissants, scrambled eggs, a side of fruit, and a steaming cup of coffee.  
  
„ÄÄ„ÄÄThe plating was impeccable, the portions just right.  
  
„ÄÄ„ÄÄAdrian‚Äôs private chef.  
  
„ÄÄ„ÄÄIt seemed he had sent breakfast today as well.  
  
„ÄÄ„ÄÄEmily hesitated, memories from last night flashing through her mind like a fever dream.  
  
„ÄÄ„ÄÄHis hands on her face.  
  
„ÄÄ„ÄÄHis lips on hers.  
  
„ÄÄ„ÄÄThe way he kissed her neck, slow, unhurried.  
  
„ÄÄ„ÄÄThe way she let him.  
  
„ÄÄ„ÄÄHer fingers curled around the fork, trying to push the thoughts aside.  
  
„ÄÄ„ÄÄIt was the alcohol, she reminded herself.  
  
„ÄÄ„ÄÄShe had convinced herself of that last night.  
  
„ÄÄ„ÄÄSo why did she still feel on edge?  
  
„ÄÄ„ÄÄTaking a deep breath, she reached for her coffee‚Äî  
  
„ÄÄ„ÄÄAnd then froze.  
  
„ÄÄ„ÄÄAcross from her, Adrian pulled out a chair and sat down.  
  
„ÄÄ„ÄÄCalm. Casual. Like nothing had happened.  
  
„ÄÄ„ÄÄHer heart nearly jumped out of her chest.  
  
„ÄÄ„ÄÄEmily kept her gaze low, focusing on her plate.  
  
„ÄÄ„ÄÄIs he really going to act like nothing happened?  
  
„ÄÄ„ÄÄShe forced herself to peek at him, expecting some kind of tension‚Äî  
  
„ÄÄ„ÄÄBut instead, he was already fully dressed, hair neatly styled, flipping through his tablet as he sipped on another cup of coffee.  
  
„ÄÄ„ÄÄShe noticed his plate was empty.  
  
„ÄÄ„ÄÄHe had already eaten.  
  
„ÄÄ„ÄÄHis laptop was open, a video conference in progress.  
  
„ÄÄ„ÄÄHe was perfectly composed, completely unaffected.  
  
„ÄÄ„ÄÄAs if last night didn‚Äôt even exist.  
  
„ÄÄ„ÄÄEmily gripped her fork tighter.  
  
„ÄÄ„ÄÄSo‚Ä¶he doesn‚Äôt remember?  
  
„ÄÄ„ÄÄA strange mix of relief and something else twisted in her stomach.  
  
„ÄÄ„ÄÄShe wasn‚Äôt sure what she expected.  
  
„ÄÄ„ÄÄDid she want him to remember?  
  
„ÄÄ„ÄÄShe shook her head. No. It‚Äôs better this way.  
  
„ÄÄ„ÄÄAdrian glanced at her briefly, his expression neutral.‚ÄúMorning.‚Äù  
  
„ÄÄ„ÄÄEmily swallowed.‚ÄúMorning.‚Äù  
  
„ÄÄ„ÄÄHe didn‚Äôt look at her again, too focused on his meeting.  
  
„ÄÄ„ÄÄEmily took a small sip of coffee, letting out a slow breath.  
  
„ÄÄ„ÄÄMaybe she was just overthinking things.  
  
„ÄÄ„ÄÄMaybe‚Ä¶last night really meant nothing.  
  
„ÄÄ„ÄÄ‚∏ª  
  
„ÄÄ„ÄÄStill lost in her thoughts, Emily arrived at A Design, throwing herself into work.  
  
„ÄÄ„ÄÄShe distracted herself with her tasks, handling final project details, making sure her transition out of the company would be as smooth as possible.  
  
„ÄÄ„ÄÄIt was easier to focus on work rather than‚Äî  
  
„ÄÄ„ÄÄA kiss that shouldn‚Äôt have happened.  
  
„ÄÄ„ÄÄShe buried herself in her work until lunchtime rolled around‚Äî  
  
„ÄÄ„ÄÄAnd just like yesterday, a delivery man appeared at the front desk.  
  
„ÄÄ„ÄÄAnd, He was stopped.  
  
„ÄÄ„ÄÄ‚ÄúI‚Äôm so sorry, Miss Carter,‚Äùthe receptionist would say, looking both apologetic and uncomfortable.‚ÄúWe‚Äôre not allowed to let outside food deliveries in. It‚Äôs Mr. Hale‚Äôs orders.‚Äù  
  
„ÄÄ„ÄÄEmily never argued.  
  
„ÄÄ„ÄÄShe simply sighed, nodded, and went down to collect it herself.  
  
„ÄÄ„ÄÄShe wasn‚Äôt surprised.  
  
„ÄÄ„ÄÄThis was exactly the kind of petty, territorial move Mike would pull.  
  
„ÄÄ„ÄÄShe didn‚Äôt even let it bother her.  
  
„ÄÄ„ÄÄLater that evening, she took her work to a nearby caf√©, settling into a quiet corner with her laptop.  
  
„ÄÄ„ÄÄShe was almost finished with the final reports, her fingers moving swiftly over the keyboard.  
  
„ÄÄ„ÄÄJust as she was about to wrap up, her phone buzzed.  
  
„ÄÄ„ÄÄA message from Lila.  
  
„ÄÄ„ÄÄLila:GO LOOK RIGHT NOW.  
  


# Chapter 28 Stolen Designs, Silent Retaliation

Attached was a link.  
  
„ÄÄ„ÄÄEmily frowned and clicked it‚Äî  
  
„ÄÄ„ÄÄAnd her stomach dropped.  
  
„ÄÄ„ÄÄA Design‚Äôs Newest Collection‚ÄìOfficial Product Launch Event!  
  
„ÄÄ„ÄÄAnd standing there, front and center‚Äî  
  
„ÄÄ„ÄÄVivian Sinclair.  
  
„ÄÄ„ÄÄEmily‚Äôs grip on her phone tightened.  
  
„ÄÄ„ÄÄVivian was dressed in an elegant silk dress.  
  
„ÄÄ„ÄÄA pale champagne color.  
  
„ÄÄ„ÄÄSubtle, yet refined.  
  
„ÄÄ„ÄÄAnd on her chest, embroidered in delicate thread‚Äî  
  
„ÄÄ„ÄÄA single white begonia.  
  
„ÄÄ„ÄÄEmily felt a cold rush sweep through her.  
  
„ÄÄ„ÄÄThe same dress.  
  
„ÄÄ„ÄÄThe one Adrian‚Äôs designer had given her.  
  
„ÄÄ„ÄÄThe one she had worn the day she bought his cufflinks.  
  
„ÄÄ„ÄÄThe one Vivian was now claiming as her own.  
  
„ÄÄ„ÄÄHer heartbeat quickened as she scrolled down.  
  
„ÄÄ„ÄÄThe comment section was already buzzing.  
  
„ÄÄ„ÄÄ‚ÄúThat dress is stunning! Where can I get one?‚Äù  
  
„ÄÄ„ÄÄ‚ÄúVivian, please tell me this is part of the new collection!‚Äù  
  
„ÄÄ„ÄÄAnd then,Vivian‚Äôs personal reply:  
  
„ÄÄ„ÄÄ‚ÄúSo sorry! This is an exclusive design‚Äîsomething I created for myself. No duplicates available!‚Äù  
  
„ÄÄ„ÄÄEmily let out a sharp breath, her jaw clenching.  
  
„ÄÄ„ÄÄHer fingers hovered over the keyboard, itching to type something, but before she could‚Äî  
  
„ÄÄ„ÄÄAnother message from Lila popped up.  
  
„ÄÄ„ÄÄLila:Here we go again. She‚Äôs at it already.  
  
„ÄÄ„ÄÄLila:Taking your things, stealing your style, and now calling it HER design?  
  
„ÄÄ„ÄÄLila:Adrian‚Äôs designer already noticed. Their legal team is drafting a cease-and-desist as we speak.  
  
„ÄÄ„ÄÄEmily sat back, exhaling slowly.  
  
„ÄÄ„ÄÄVivian had always imitated her‚Äîsince high school, since forever.  
  
„ÄÄ„ÄÄBut this time, she had made a mistake.  
  
„ÄÄ„ÄÄBecause this wasn‚Äôt just copying an outfit.  
  
„ÄÄ„ÄÄThis was stealing a copyrighted design from a high-profile luxury designer.  
  
„ÄÄ„ÄÄA high-profile designer who just so happened to work for Adrian Blackwood.  
  
„ÄÄ„ÄÄHer phone buzzed again.  
  
„ÄÄ„ÄÄLila:Anyway, don‚Äôt thank me. Thank your husband. This was all his idea.  
  
„ÄÄ„ÄÄEmily stared at the words on the screen.  
  
„ÄÄ„ÄÄA strange warmth spread through her chest.  
  
„ÄÄ„ÄÄAdrian had handled it before she even needed to ask.  
  
„ÄÄ„ÄÄShe smiled slightly, fingers hovering over the keyboard.  
  
„ÄÄ„ÄÄThen she typed back‚Äî  
  
„ÄÄ„ÄÄEmily:Tell him‚Ä¶I said thank you.  
  
„ÄÄ„ÄÄLila‚Äôs response was immediate.  
  
„ÄÄ„ÄÄLila:Why don‚Äôt you tell him yourself?  
  
„ÄÄ„ÄÄEmily bit her lip.  
  
„ÄÄ„ÄÄMaybe she would.  
  
„ÄÄ„ÄÄ\*\*\*\*\*\*\* stepped into the penthouse, the weight of the day slowly lifting off her shoulders.  
  
„ÄÄ„ÄÄShe had finally finished sorting through her remaining tasks at A Design, and for the first time in a long time, she felt truly free.  
  
„ÄÄ„ÄÄJust as she set her bag down, she heard the faint click of the front door.  
  
„ÄÄ„ÄÄShe turned‚Äîjust in time to see Adrian walk in.  
  
„ÄÄ„ÄÄDressed in his usual sharp suit, his golden hair slightly tousled from the wind, he exuded the same effortless authority he always did.  
  
„ÄÄ„ÄÄEmily smiled, feeling unexpectedly light.  
  
„ÄÄ„ÄÄ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre home early,‚Äùshe said casually.  
  
„ÄÄ„ÄÄAdrian‚Äôs sharp gaze flickered over her, then narrowed slightly.‚ÄúYou look happy.‚Äù  
  
„ÄÄ„ÄÄShe let out a soft laugh.‚ÄúI am happy. Thank you.‚Äù  
  
„ÄÄ„ÄÄAdrian paused for a beat, then smirked knowingly.  
  
„ÄÄ„ÄÄHe knew exactly what she was thanking him for.  
  
„ÄÄ„ÄÄ‚ÄúJust wait a few more days,‚Äùhe said smoothly.  
  
„ÄÄ„ÄÄEmily tilted her head.‚ÄúWhy?‚Äù  
  
„ÄÄ„ÄÄAdrian set his briefcase down and loosened his tie slightly.  
  
„ÄÄ„ÄÄThen, with a faint, almost teasing smirk, he said‚Äî  
  
„ÄÄ„ÄÄ‚ÄúBecause soon, you‚Äôll be even happier. I‚Äôll make sure this little scandal gets all the attention it deserves.‚Äù  
  
„ÄÄ„ÄÄEmily‚Äôs lips parted slightly in surprise.  
  
„ÄÄ„ÄÄShe wasn‚Äôt sure whether she should be impressed, concerned, or entertained.  
  
„ÄÄ„ÄÄMaybe all three.  
  


# Chapter 29 Checkmate

Emily arrived at A Design, knowing today was her last.  
  
„ÄÄ„ÄÄHer resignation had been sent in, but it wasn‚Äôt until she walked into the design department that she fully realized‚Äî  
  
„ÄÄ„ÄÄPeople hadn‚Äôt expected her to actually go through with it.  
  
„ÄÄ„ÄÄ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre really leaving?‚Äùone of her coworkers asked, looking genuinely upset.  
  
„ÄÄ„ÄÄEmily smiled softly.‚ÄúYeah.‚Äù  
  
„ÄÄ„ÄÄHer assistant hesitated.‚ÄúBut‚Ä¶what about Mike? I thought you two were practically engaged?‚Äù  
  
„ÄÄ„ÄÄEmily barely blinked.‚ÄúWe broke up a long time ago.‚Äù  
  
„ÄÄ„ÄÄSilence.  
  
„ÄÄ„ÄÄThen‚Äîa ripple of whispers.  
  
„ÄÄ„ÄÄPeople exchanged stunned glances.  
  
„ÄÄ„ÄÄIt was like she had just confirmed one of the company‚Äôs biggest rumors.  
  
„ÄÄ„ÄÄBut Emily didn‚Äôt stay to watch their reactions.  
  
„ÄÄ„ÄÄShe simply handed in the last of her paperwork, thanked her colleagues politely, and walked out of A Design for the final time.  
  
„ÄÄ„ÄÄIt felt‚Ä¶freeing.  
  
„ÄÄ„ÄÄEmily thought she would just head home and rest‚Äîbut Adrian had other plans.  
  
„ÄÄ„ÄÄRight after lunch, he picked her up himself.  
  
„ÄÄ„ÄÄShe barely had time to ask where they were going before he drove them to the marina.  
  
„ÄÄ„ÄÄA private yacht was waiting.  
  
„ÄÄ„ÄÄThe afternoon sun cast a golden shimmer over the water, the gentle waves rocking against the sleek, modern structure of the vessel.  
  
„ÄÄ„ÄÄEmily stared at it, slightly stunned.‚ÄúWait‚Ä¶we‚Äôre going on a boat?‚Äù  
  
„ÄÄ„ÄÄAdrian gave her a sidelong glance.‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a yacht, Emily.‚Äù  
  
„ÄÄ„ÄÄShe rolled her eyes, but couldn‚Äôt suppress a smile.  
  
„ÄÄ„ÄÄAdrian led her up the deck, where a private dining area had been set up‚Äînothing too extravagant, but elegant and intimate.  
  
„ÄÄ„ÄÄThe sea breeze was calm and refreshing, the horizon stretching endlessly ahead of them.  
  
„ÄÄ„ÄÄEmily let herself relax into the moment, enjoying the peace‚Äî  
  
„ÄÄ„ÄÄUntil her phone buzzed.  
  
„ÄÄ„ÄÄA message from Lila.  
  
„ÄÄ„ÄÄLila:CHECK YOUR PHONE RIGHT NOW.  
  
„ÄÄ„ÄÄEmily raised a brow, clicking on the link.  
  
„ÄÄ„ÄÄAnd then‚Äî  
  
„ÄÄ„ÄÄShe saw it.  
  
„ÄÄ„ÄÄThe legal notice.  
  
„ÄÄ„ÄÄIt had just been formally released, and within minutes, it was already gaining traction.  
  
„ÄÄ„ÄÄThe statement was clear, concise, and brutal.  
  
„ÄÄ„ÄÄ‚ÄúAfter thorough investigation, it has been confirmed that Ms. Vivian Sinclair has used our original design for unauthorized display, promotion, and personal claims of authorship. Without the explicit permission of the designer, this constitutes a violation of intellectual property laws. We will pursue full legal action for financial damages, reputational harm, and the protection of creative rights.‚Äù  
  
„ÄÄ„ÄÄEmily stared at the screen, her heart racing.  
  
„ÄÄ„ÄÄComments were pouring in.  
  
„ÄÄ„ÄÄPeople were already picking sides.  
  
„ÄÄ„ÄÄSome were defending Vivian.  
  
„ÄÄ„ÄÄMost‚Ä¶were tearing her apart.  
  
„ÄÄ„ÄÄA Design‚Äôs name was being dragged into the controversy.  
  
„ÄÄ„ÄÄAnd Vivian‚Äîwas being publicly humiliated.  
  
„ÄÄ„ÄÄEmily turned to Adrian, who was calmly sipping his wine.  
  
„ÄÄ„ÄÄShe narrowed her eyes.‚ÄúYou knew this was going to drop today, didn‚Äôt you?‚Äù  
  
„ÄÄ„ÄÄAdrian set his glass down and met her gaze‚Äîcomposed, and utterly satisfied.  
  
„ÄÄ„ÄÄ‚ÄúI told you,‚Äùhe said simply.‚ÄúYou‚Äôd be even happier soon.‚Äù  
  
„ÄÄ„ÄÄEmily blinked at him, then‚Äîlaughed.  
  
„ÄÄ„ÄÄBecause honestly?  
  
„ÄÄ„ÄÄShe was.  
  
„ÄÄ„ÄÄMeanwhile‚Äîat the Sinclair Residence.  
  
„ÄÄ„ÄÄA stack of legal documents slammed onto the coffee table with a loud thud before being tossed straight at Vivian.  
  
„ÄÄ„ÄÄ‚ÄúLook at what you‚Äôve done!‚Äù  
  
„ÄÄ„ÄÄHer father‚Äôs voice was sharp, filled with fury. His face was red with anger, veins visible against his temples.  
  
„ÄÄ„ÄÄVivian barely flinched.  
  
„ÄÄ„ÄÄShe sat stiffly on the couch, gripping the edge of her skirt as the thick stack of legal notices scattered around her.  
  
„ÄÄ„ÄÄ‚ÄúWe worked so hard to establish a connection with A Design‚Äîso hard to get close to Mike! And now?‚ÄùHer father pointed a trembling finger at her.‚ÄúYou had to go and play the‚Äòreal designer‚Äôact! What the hell were you thinking?!‚Äù  
  
„ÄÄ„ÄÄVivian clenched her jaw, her nails digging into her palms.  
  
„ÄÄ„ÄÄ‚ÄúDad, I was set up.‚Äù  
  
„ÄÄ„ÄÄHer voice was soft, almost trembling‚Äîbut inside, her mind was racing.  
  
„ÄÄ„ÄÄHer father scoffed.‚ÄúSet up? Don‚Äôt give me that nonsense! Do you know how much damage this lawsuit can do? It‚Äôs not even about money‚Äîthe luxury brand designer isn‚Äôt responding to any settlement offers! Their only goal is to make an example out of you!‚Äù  
  
„ÄÄ„ÄÄVivian‚Äôs stomach sank.  
  
„ÄÄ„ÄÄShe knew.  
  
„ÄÄ„ÄÄShe had spent the whole day trying to reach out, trying to get someone‚Äîanyone‚Äîto help clean up this mess.  
  
„ÄÄ„ÄÄBut no one was answering.  
  
„ÄÄ„ÄÄ  
  


# Chapter 30 The Call She Won‚Äôt Answer

A Design‚Äôs PR team was distancing themselves.  
  
„ÄÄ„ÄÄEven the board members who had once spoken kindly to her were staying quiet.  
  
„ÄÄ„ÄÄVivian was alone in this.  
  
„ÄÄ„ÄÄHer father sighed heavily, running a hand through his thinning hair.‚ÄúVivian, I swear to God, if you mess this up‚Äî‚Äù  
  
„ÄÄ„ÄÄ‚ÄúI won‚Äôt.‚Äù  
  
„ÄÄ„ÄÄVivian lifted her head, her voice suddenly steadier.  
  
„ÄÄ„ÄÄHer father‚Äôs glare didn‚Äôt soften.‚ÄúThen fix it. And fast.‚Äù  
  
„ÄÄ„ÄÄWith that, he turned and stormed out of the room, slamming the door behind him.  
  
„ÄÄ„ÄÄThe house fell into a tense, suffocating silence.  
  
„ÄÄ„ÄÄVivian slowly exhaled.  
  
„ÄÄ„ÄÄShe reached forward, gathering the papers into a neat stack, her fingers smoothing out the creases.  
  
„ÄÄ„ÄÄHer gaze fell onto the official cease-and-desist order.  
  
„ÄÄ„ÄÄHer own name printed boldly next to words like‚Äúunauthorized use‚Äùand‚Äúintellectual property theft.‚Äù  
  
„ÄÄ„ÄÄHer nails dug into the paper.  
  
„ÄÄ„ÄÄEmily.  
  
„ÄÄ„ÄÄVivian‚Äôs mind replayed that day on the street.  
  
„ÄÄ„ÄÄShe had thought nothing of it at the time‚Äîbut now, she saw it so clearly.  
  
„ÄÄ„ÄÄThat moment when Emily stood there, right in front of her.  
  
„ÄÄ„ÄÄWearing that dress.  
  
„ÄÄ„ÄÄNot speaking much, not arguing‚Äîjust standing there.  
  
„ÄÄ„ÄÄLetting her see it.  
  
„ÄÄ„ÄÄLetting her believe she had found something to use against her.  
  
„ÄÄ„ÄÄVivian‚Äôs breath shook.  
  
„ÄÄ„ÄÄIt was a trap.  
  
„ÄÄ„ÄÄA perfectly calculated, patient, well-placed trap.  
  
„ÄÄ„ÄÄAnd she had walked right into it.  
  
„ÄÄ„ÄÄHer teeth ground together.  
  
„ÄÄ„ÄÄBut it wasn‚Äôt over yet.  
  
„ÄÄ„ÄÄHer fingers clutched the papers as she reached for her phone, scrolling down until she found Mike‚Äôs contact.  
  
„ÄÄ„ÄÄShe needed to explain.  
  
„ÄÄ„ÄÄMike had always liked her.  
  
„ÄÄ„ÄÄMike had always believed in her.  
  
„ÄÄ„ÄÄShe would make sure he did one more time.  
  
„ÄÄ„ÄÄVivian took a deep breath and pressed call.  
  
„ÄÄ„ÄÄMike answered.  
  
„ÄÄ„ÄÄThe moment Vivian‚Äôs soft, trembling voice filled the line, he knew what was coming.  
  
„ÄÄ„ÄÄ‚ÄúMike‚Ä¶‚ÄùHer breath hitched, the perfect balance of vulnerability and hesitation.‚ÄúI‚Ä¶I don‚Äôt know what to do.‚Äù  
  
„ÄÄ„ÄÄMike exhaled slowly, waiting.  
  
„ÄÄ„ÄÄ‚ÄúI came back mostly for you,‚ÄùVivian continued, her voice a whisper.‚ÄúI just wanted to help you, to support your project‚Ä¶But now Emily hates me. She‚Äôs dragging outsiders into this to ruin me. I never meant for things to get this bad.‚Äù  
  
„ÄÄ„ÄÄDragging outsiders?  
  
„ÄÄ„ÄÄMike frowned slightly.  
  
„ÄÄ„ÄÄVivian sniffled, her voice dipping even lower.‚ÄúI was just worried, Mike. I saw how difficult it was for you to secure Emily‚Äôs 20%of A Design‚Äôs shares. I thought‚Ä¶I thought maybe if I reminded her of the past, she would finally let go.  
  
„ÄÄ„ÄÄ‚ÄúI just used the same tricks I used in high school, that‚Äôs all.‚Äù  
  
„ÄÄ„ÄÄMike‚Äôs brows furrowed.  
  
„ÄÄ„ÄÄHigh school.  
  
„ÄÄ„ÄÄBack then, Vivian always had a way of twisting things just enough to get what she wanted. She was never confrontational‚Äîshe let people fall into her narrative.  
  
„ÄÄ„ÄÄAnd Emily‚Ä¶  
  
„ÄÄ„ÄÄEmily used to care.  
  
„ÄÄ„ÄÄShe used to get jealous.  
  
„ÄÄ„ÄÄShe used to try harder whenever she felt like she was competing for his attention.  
  
„ÄÄ„ÄÄThis time, she hadn‚Äôt.  
  
„ÄÄ„ÄÄMike‚Äôs grip tightened on his phone.‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not your fault.‚Äù  
  
„ÄÄ„ÄÄVivian let out a shaky breath of relief.  
  
„ÄÄ„ÄÄ‚ÄúReally? You‚Äôre not mad?‚Äù  
  
„ÄÄ„ÄÄ‚ÄúNo,‚ÄùMike said firmly.‚ÄúEmily is being unreasonable. This is just about a dress‚Äîit‚Äôs not worth all this drama.‚Äù  
  
„ÄÄ„ÄÄHis jaw clenched.‚ÄúI‚Äôll talk to her. I‚Äôll tell her to issue a public statement clarifying things.‚Äù  
  
„ÄÄ„ÄÄVivian made a small, grateful sound.‚ÄúMike, thank you‚Ä¶I knew I could count on you.‚Äù  
  
„ÄÄ„ÄÄBut as soon as the call ended, his confidence wavered.  
  
„ÄÄ„ÄÄHis mind flickered back to Emily‚Äôs expression the last time he saw her.  
  
„ÄÄ„ÄÄNot angry.  
  
„ÄÄ„ÄÄNot jealous.  
  
„ÄÄ„ÄÄNot wounded.  
  
„ÄÄ„ÄÄJust cold.  
  
„ÄÄ„ÄÄSo distant that it unsettled him.  
  
„ÄÄ„ÄÄWhy hasn‚Äôt she come back to me yet?  
  
„ÄÄ„ÄÄIf she was really jealous‚Äîif this was all because she was upset about Vivian‚Äî  
  
„ÄÄ„ÄÄWhy wasn‚Äôt she asking for him back?  
  
„ÄÄ„ÄÄMike‚Äôs irritation spiked.  
  
„ÄÄ„ÄÄWithout hesitating, he pulled up Emily‚Äôs number.  
  
„ÄÄ„ÄÄAnd called.  
  
„ÄÄ„ÄÄOnce.  
  
„ÄÄ„ÄÄTwice.  
  
„ÄÄ„ÄÄStraight to voicemail.  
  
„ÄÄ„ÄÄMike‚Äôs jaw ticked.  
  
„ÄÄ„ÄÄShe was ignoring him.  
  
„ÄÄ„ÄÄHe stood abruptly, shoving his phone into his pocket.  
  
„ÄÄ„ÄÄIf Emily wouldn‚Äôt answer‚Äî  
  
„ÄÄ„ÄÄHe‚Äôd make sure she had no choice but to listen.

I spent the first (6?) years of my career being a yes person, organising the Christmas function, getting the coffee blah blah. I took whatever work was thrown my way, technical or not. I was praised pretty highly for my ""personality"". I hit reset when I didn't get the promotion I wanted at my last firm after all that effort because I ""wasn't technical enough"" when I'd been asking ""politely"" for better work for years. I moved firms, pushed HARD for design work (including pushing back on one occasion when a high profile design was redistributed to a younger man because I would be a better ""middle manager"". The work was ultimately given back to me. I'm enjoying the work but I've had to become a bit of a b\*\*ch to get it :) I've been in the new job a bit over a year and I know I'm doing well technically-The job allows me to be out on site when I want watching my (and other) designs get built to so, in a very short time, I've improved my design skills, being able to watch what works and what doesn't (very satisfying). Plus, I'm working very, very hard to get good, quick. But..... I now receive zero praise (other than a single occasion when one man said he was ""surprised"" I'd picked up on a complex project quickly (which did feel good). I don't feel liked though....

1lcpcyx,https://i.redd.it/q9ijdr47o97f1.jpeg,Big Guy vs Gravel Bike,"TLDR: Back on the bike after >15 years, starting slow at 3 mile rides to  12 mile coffee rides. Weight dropping, stress down, and aiming for group rides soon. Thanks to this sub for the motivation.
____________________

Due to knee pain and working remotely, I needed to get active again. After more then 15 years off a bike, I finally decided to get back on. I‚Äôm overweight (297 lbs and 6‚Äô3‚Äù) and far out of shape compared to my younger days. I came across gravel bikes and thought one would be a good fit for these rough New England roads.

I found this subreddit and really enjoyed the perspectives people shared from their bike outings and their great looking rides. That motivated me to finally make the purchase and get a new ALR 4.

I started small, doing 15 minutes out and 15 minutes back, ~ 3 miles (6mph pace). Now I have reached my first goal, which was a Sunday coffee ride. It was a solid 12-mile ride after just a few weeks of being back on the bike. My knee feels great, the weight is melting off, and I feel less stressed overall.

My next goal is to join a group ride once I can increase my average pace from 12 mph to somewhere between 15 and 17 mph. Then 20 mile trips.  That goal feels within reach pretty soon. From what I‚Äôve seen, there are not many beginner group rides in central Massachusetts, so I‚Äôll need to get to an intermediate level to join in.

For anyone lurking here like I was or thinking about starting, just ignore the doubt and get out there. Start with what you can manage and build from there‚Ä¶ we all had to start somewhere.

Thanks to everyone who has shared their rides. Your posts helped motivate me to get moving again.

by [https://www.gptsportswriter.com](https://www.gptsportswriter.com) **Witty & Sarcastic Analysis: Ottawa Redblacks vs. Calgary Stampeders (2025 Week 2)**  
*‚ÄúAh, the CFL: where the weather is unpredictable, the punting is questionable, and the Redblacks‚Äô defense is currently a ghost town.‚Äù*

---

### The Matchup

**Ottawa Redblacks (0-1)** vs. **Calgary Stampeders (1-0)**  
**Date:** June 21, 2025 | **Time:** 8:00 PM ET  
**Location:** TD Place Stadium (Ottawa)

---

### Key Stats & Context

* **Ottawa‚Äôs QB Matthew Shiltz** is a 32-year-old journeyman with a career 21 TD/20 INT ratio. In 2024, he threw for 438 yards in 10 games but looked like a man who‚Äôs seen too many CFL sunsets.
* **Calgary‚Äôs defense** is the real star here. They‚Äôre coming off a 1-0 start and are favored by **8/10 analysts**, including 3DownNation‚Äôs consensus.
* **Ottawa‚Äôs defense** is a dumpster fire: They lost **Charlie Ringland** (out for the year) and are missing **Matthew Shiltz‚Äôs backup** (wait, no‚ÄîShiltz *is* the starter). Wait, no‚ÄîShiltz is the QB. Ringland was a defensive player. Either way, Ottawa‚Äôs defense is now a ‚Äúhow many holes can a sieve have?‚Äù situation.

---

### Injuries & Roster Notes

* **Ottawa:**
   * **Charlie Ringland** (defensive back) is out for the season. His absence is like losing your favorite coffee‚Äîsuddenly, everything tastes like regret.
   * QB **Matthew Shiltz** is the lone bright spot, but his 2024 stat line (2 TDs, 2 INTs in 10 games) screams ‚ÄúI‚Äôll take a raincheck on consistency.‚Äù
* **Calgary:**
   * No major injuries reported. Their defense is the real MVP, and their analysts are high on them.

---

### Odds Breakdown

* **Moneyline:**
   * Calgary Stampeders: **-210** (FanDuel)
   * Ottawa Redblacks: **+190**
* **Spread:**
   * Calgary -1.5 (-110)
   * Ottawa +1.5 (-110)
* **Total:** **50.5** (Even money)

---

### Data-Driven Best Bet

**Calgary Stampeders -1.5**

**Why?**

1. **Underdog Win Rates:** The CFL‚Äôs underdog win rate is roughly **35%** (NFL-tier), meaning favorites win \~65% of the time. Calgary is the favorite here, and their implied probability (51.28% from -210 odds) is *way* below the 65% historical benchmark. That‚Äôs a **positive Expected Value (EV)** play.
2. **Analyst Consensus:** 8/10 analysts back Calgary. In sports, when 80% of experts agree, it‚Äôs either a sure thing or a conspiracy. We‚Äôll go with the former.
3. **Injury Impact:** Ottawa‚Äôs defense is a depleted unit. Without Ringland, they‚Äôre likely to get shredded by Calgary‚Äôs offense. Shiltz isn‚Äôt exactly a rocket surgeon, but even a mediocre QB can exploit a defense missing its best player.

---

### EV Calculations

* **Calgary -1.5 (-110):**
   * Implied probability: 50%
   * Historical favorite win rate: \~65%
   * **EV = (0.65 \* 1.0) - (0.35 \* 1.0) = +0.30**
* **Ottawa +1.5 (-110):**
   * Implied probability: 50%
   * Historical underdog win rate: \~35%
   * **EV = (0.35 \* 1.0) - (0.65 \* 1.0) = -0.30**

**Verdict:** Calgary‚Äôs EV is +30%‚Äîa no-brainer for a data-driven bettor.

---

### Final Prediction

**Calgary Stampeders 27, Ottawa Redblacks 20**  
*‚ÄúCalgary‚Äôs defense will make Shiltz look like a man who forgot how to throw a spiral. Bet accordingly.‚Äù*

I quit coffee and changed to lacto free milk from the 20th May ever since iv been fine .. stools normal and sausage shaped.. sometimes had the constipation but wasn't too bad.

Stool sample and blood tests fine aswell as a FIT test only came up as 4umg ? But doctors said that's fine. First stool test i never had samanella or e coli or anything like that. Now the doctors have just shrugged there shoulders and said IBS but its been a while now and I dont even get the stomach pain anymore.

Could it be I dont actually have IBS or am I just experiencing a ""break"" from it all ? I have done some research into IBS but you never know with these things. Has anyone experienced this? Thanks ",1,1750069560.0,ibs,0,1.0,False

A slow, almost imperceptible smile ghosted across his lips.  You said you‚Äôd marry me, Emily. So, we‚Äôre getting married. Her pulse hammered against her ribs.","# Chapter 11       I will marry you

Adrian had just finished his meeting when he heard footsteps outside his study. He glanced up as Emily appeared in the doorway. For a moment, neither of them spoke. The setting sun bathed the room in amber light, casting long shadows across the polished wood floors. Then, Emily stepped inside. Adrian leaned back in his chair, studying her carefully. ‚ÄúEmily. Her hands curled into fists at her sides, as if bracing herself. Then, with quiet determination, she met his gaze and said‚Äî ""I‚Äôll marry you."" Silence.  The kind that stretched thick in the air, wrapping around them like an invisible thread.  
Adrian‚Äôs expression didn‚Äôt change.  Didn‚Äôt move. But his fingers‚Äîjust barely‚Äîtightened against the armrest of his chair. Finally, after a long pause, he exhaled. And then, he said the only thing that mattered. ""Are you sure? Emily nodded once. ""Yes. Adrian studied her for another long moment. His blue eyes, always sharp, always assessing, flickered with something unreadable. Then, he leaned forward, resting his forearms on the desk, and said in that low, measured voice of his ""Then we‚Äôll do this properly. Emily swallowed. ""Properly? Adrian‚Äôs gaze held hers. ""The wedding. She blinked. ""You mean‚Äî Tomorrow. Her breath hitched. ""Tomorrow?  A slow, almost imperceptible smile ghosted across his lips.  You said you‚Äôd marry me, Emily. So, we‚Äôre getting married. Her pulse hammered against her ribs.  
  
And for the first time since this entire thing had started‚Äî  
  
She realized she wasn‚Äôt afraid.  
  
But then another thought struck her.  
  
She glanced at him, tilting her head. ‚ÄúWait. How are you going to explain this to your family? You‚Äôre just‚Ä¶ suddenly getting married? Out of nowhere?‚Äù  
  
Adrian leaned against his desk, crossing his arms. The corners of his lips lifted slightly, almost amused.  
  
‚ÄúDo I need to explain?‚Äù  
  
Emily blinked. ‚ÄúOf course, you do! We can‚Äôt just disappear and show up married‚Äîwhat will your family think? And‚Äî‚Äù she hesitated, voice dropping slightly, ‚Äúpeople still think I was about to marry Mike. That rumor spread fast.‚Äù  
  
Adrian‚Äôs smirk didn‚Äôt waver. Instead, he exhaled as if thinking it over, then met her gaze with calm certainty.  
  
‚ÄúThen let‚Äôs give them a better story,‚Äù he said smoothly. ‚ÄúTell them I‚Äôve always loved you. That I couldn‚Äôt stand watching you marry another man, so I decided to steal you away at the last moment.‚Äù His voice was low, teasing. ‚ÄúHow does that sound?‚Äù  
  
Emily stared at him.  
  
Then she let out a surprised laugh. ‚ÄúYou can‚Äôt just make up some dramatic, impossible love story!‚Äù  
  
Adrian only gave a slight shrug. His expression didn‚Äôt change, but there was something unreadable in his steady blue gaze‚Äîsomething that made her breath catch for half a second.  
  
His lips barely moved, but the faintest whisper of a knowing smile flickered across his face.  
  
As if the story wasn‚Äôt made up at all.  
  
Emily shook her head, trying to push away the strange, fleeting thought. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre ridiculous,‚Äù she muttered, still half-laughing.  
  
Adrian merely held her gaze for a moment longer before looking away.  
  
Then, shifting back into his usual composed self, he said lightly, ‚ÄúMy parents are overseas. They won‚Äôt need to attend, only to be informed. And as for everyone else‚Ä¶‚Äù He glanced at her. ‚ÄúWe only need to tell Lila. Tonight.‚Äù  
  
Emily frowned. ‚ÄúJust Lila?‚Äù  
  
He nodded. ‚ÄúShe won‚Äôt need an explanation. She‚Äôll understand.‚Äù  
  
Emily hesitated.  
  
She knew Lila well. If she truly suspected something, she‚Äôd dig deeper‚Äîbut she also knew Lila trusted Adrian completely.  
  
Finally, Emily exhaled and nodded. ‚ÄúAlright. Let‚Äôs tell her.‚Äù  
  
That evening, when Lila returned home, she tossed her bag onto the couch, stretching her arms overhead.  
  
‚ÄúGod, if I have to listen to my advisor go on about ‚Äòacademic discipline‚Äô one more time, I might actually drop out.‚Äù She sighed dramatically, then noticed Adrian and Emily sitting together on the couch, both looking oddly serious.  
  
Her eyes narrowed immediately.  
  
‚ÄúOkay‚Ä¶ why do you two look like you‚Äôre about to tell me something crazy?‚Äù  
  
Emily exchanged a glance with Adrian before turning to face Lila directly.  
  
‚ÄúLila, we need to talk.‚Äù  
  
Lila raised an eyebrow. ‚ÄúThat sounds ominous.‚Äù  
  
Emily inhaled, then said it.  
  
‚ÄúAdrian and I‚Ä¶ we‚Äôre getting married.‚Äù  
  
Silence.  
  
Complete. Utter. Silence.  
  
Lila froze‚Äîstaring at them as if they had just told her they were moving to Mars.  
  
Her gaze snapped to her brother, her shock shifting into something incredulous.  
  
Then, her eyes widened further, realization dawning.  
  
And Adrian‚Ä¶  
  
Adrian met her gaze without a flicker of hesitation.  
  
Lila‚Äôs breath caught.  
  
Oh my God.  
  
She couldn‚Äôt believe it.  
  
He actually did it.  
  
For years, she had watched him stand on the sidelines, watched him never act.  
  
And now‚Äî  
  
She had expected a lot of things from her older brother. But this? This was beyond anything she had imagined.  
  


# Chapter 12 Dress

Slowly, she turned back to Emily, then back to Adrian, her brain struggling to catch up.  
  
Then, still staring at her brother, she mouthed the words, How did you pull this off?  
  
Adrian‚Äôs expression remained composed, but his blue eyes darkened slightly, as if in silent response.  
  
Lila‚Äôs jaw nearly dropped.  
  
Emily, oblivious to the silent exchange, shifted slightly. ‚ÄúLila?‚Äù  
  
Lila snapped out of it, looking at Emily again, still reeling.  
  
‚ÄúYou‚Äôre‚Äîyou‚Äôre what?‚Äù she stammered.  
  
Emily swallowed. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre getting married.‚Äù  
  
Lila blinked rapidly, then exhaled sharply. ‚ÄúAre you guys insane?‚Äù  
  
She turned to Adrian, pointing a finger at him. ‚ÄúYou‚Äîexplain. Now.‚Äù  
  
Adrian didn‚Äôt even flinch. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôve made our decision.‚Äù  
  
Lila let out a frustrated groan, throwing her hands in the air. ‚ÄúThat is not an explanation!‚Äù  
  
Emily sighed. ‚ÄúLila, I know this is sudden‚Äî‚Äù  
  
‚ÄúSudden? You were about to marry Mike two minutes ago! And now you‚Äôre telling me you‚Äôre marrying my brother?‚Äù  
  
Lila exhaled sharply, dragging a hand through her hair.  
  
‚ÄúOkay,‚Äù she muttered. ‚ÄúFine. You know what? I give up. I can‚Äôt even process this.‚Äù  
  
Emily looked at her hesitantly. ‚ÄúLila‚Äî‚Äù  
  
Lila held up a hand. ‚ÄúNo. You guys are crazy, but fine. Do whatever you want.‚Äù  
  
Then she narrowed her eyes at her brother. ‚ÄúBut I swear, Adrian, if you did this to manipulate her, I‚Äôll murder you in your sleep.‚Äù  
  
Adrian, unfazed, simply said, ‚ÄúNoted.‚Äù  
  
Lila groaned, dropping onto the couch. ‚ÄúThis is actually happening, isn‚Äôt it?‚Äù  
  
Emily let out a small breath. ‚ÄúYes.‚Äù  
  
Lila shook her head, then suddenly turned to Emily. ‚ÄúWait‚Äîwhen‚Äôs the wedding?‚Äù  
  
Emily hesitated. ‚Äú‚Ä¶Tomorrow.‚Äù  
  
Lila‚Äôs entire body stiffened.  
  
She turned to Adrian slowly, her expression deadpan. ‚ÄúTomorrow?‚Äù  
  
Adrian nodded. ‚ÄúTomorrow.‚Äù  
  
Lila buried her face in her hands. ‚ÄúYou two are absolutely insane.‚Äù  
  
Then, after a moment, she exhaled, shaking her head, and looked at them again‚Äîthis time, something softer in her gaze.  
  
‚ÄúWell. I guess I‚Äôll be your witness, then.‚Äù  
  
Emily‚Äôs lips curled slightly. ‚ÄúThank you, Lila.‚Äù  
  
Lila grumbled, throwing a pillow at Adrian. ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt believe you‚Äôre getting married before me.‚Äù  
  
Adrian caught it effortlessly, his expression unreadable.  
  
Then, as Lila narrowed her eyes at him‚Äîher gaze wordlessly accusing him of being incredibly calculated‚Äîhe simply smiled.  
  
Not denying. Not admitting.  
  
Just smiling.  
  
Late into the night, long after Emily had agreed to the marriage, a knock echoed through the grand Blackwood estate.  
  
Emily, still awake, glanced toward the door just as Adrian opened it. A well-dressed man stepped inside, carrying a garment bag made of the finest silk casing.  
  
She watched as Adrian took it without a word, then handed it to her.  
  
‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs this?‚Äù she asked, eyeing the pristine bag.  
  
‚ÄúA dress,‚Äù Adrian said simply. ‚ÄúFor tomorrow.‚Äù  
  
Emily frowned, glancing between him and the stranger. ‚ÄúYou had this delivered tonight?‚Äù  
  
The man‚Äîclearly someone Adrian trusted‚Äîremained silent, offering only a small nod before excusing himself and disappearing as quickly as he arrived.  
  
Emily hesitated, then unzipped the bag.  
  
The moment her fingers brushed against the fabric, her breath hitched.  
  
It was beautiful.  
  
Not an extravagant wedding gown, not something draped in pearls or trailing lace‚Äîjust a simple, yet impossibly elegant dress.  
  
Soft ivory satin, flowing yet structured, hugging the waist just enough to accentuate her figure without feeling restrictive.  
  
The neckline was understated, the sleeves delicate, and when she ran her hand over the material, she could feel the subtle embroidery‚Äîbarely visible, yet meticulously crafted.  
  
She lifted it slightly, checking the length. Perfect.  
  
It was as if it had been designed specifically for her.  
  
She turned toward Adrian, narrowing her eyes slightly. ‚ÄúHow is this‚Ä¶ so perfect?‚Äù  
  
Adrian met her gaze, calm as always.  
  
‚ÄúIs it?‚Äù  
  
Emily scoffed, turning back to the dress. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs exactly my size. You‚Äôre telling me your tailor guessed my measurements?‚Äù  
  
Adrian didn‚Äôt answer.  
  
She turned to him again, suspicious. ‚ÄúAdrian.‚Äù  
  
Still, nothing.  
  
His expression remained unreadable, but when she looked closer‚Äîthere was something in his eyes.  
  
Something she couldn‚Äôt quite decipher.  
  
Emily pursed her lips, exhaling softly. ‚Äú‚Ä¶Never mind.‚Äù  
  
Maybe it was just a coincidence.  
  
Maybe Adrian simply had very skilled people working for him.  
  
Either way, she wasn‚Äôt about to question it further.  
  
She ran her fingers over the fabric one more time before quietly murmuring, ‚ÄúThank you.‚Äù  
  
Adrian gave a small nod. ‚ÄúGet some rest.‚Äù  
  
And with that, he turned and left.  
  
Emily stood there for a while, staring at the dress, trying not to overthink why it fit so well.  
  
And why Adrian had absolutely nothing to say about it.  
  


# Chapter 13 Mike's illusion of control

The conference room carried an air of quiet authority, the scent of freshly brewed coffee mixing with the polished mahogany and sleek leather chairs. The shareholders of A Designs took their seats, murmuring in low, measured tones as they prepared for the discussion ahead.  
  
At the head of the table, Mike leaned back, fingers tapping lazily against the surface. His expression was one of practiced confidence, his sharp navy suit tailored to perfection. He looked every bit the man in control‚Äîor at least, that‚Äôs what he told himself.  
  
The senior partner, an executive who had been with the company since its early days, cleared his throat. ‚ÄúAlright, let‚Äôs get started. We have several pressing matters today. First‚Äîthe Luthmere Luxury Towers Development Project. The bidding process begins next month, and securing this contract would give us a strong foothold in the high-end market.‚Äù  
  
A few members nodded approvingly, flipping through the proposal documents in front of them.  
  
‚ÄúThe profits look promising,‚Äù one of them noted. ‚ÄúLuthmere‚Äôs developments have always yielded long-term gains.‚Äù  
  
Another board member, a man in his early sixties with sharp business instincts, adjusted his reading glasses. ‚ÄúBut the risks‚Äîhave we properly analyzed them? Their contracts are known for hidden clauses. If we take this on and something backfires, the financial impact could be devastating.‚Äù  
  
Mike waved a dismissive hand. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs an aggressive move, but that‚Äôs how we stay ahead. Playing it safe won‚Äôt get us anywhere.‚Äù  
  
The room settled into a moment of contemplation before one of the partners asked, ‚ÄúWhere does Emily stand on this?‚Äù  
  
A flicker of irritation passed through Mike‚Äôs expression, though he masked it with ease.  
  
‚ÄúShe‚Äôs been absent lately,‚Äù the senior partner added, giving Mike a pointed look. ‚ÄúI assume she‚Äôs just taking time to cool off, but she still holds twenty percent of this company. We need to know where her vote stands.‚Äù  
  
Several heads nodded in agreement.  
  
Mike exhaled slowly, keeping his expression relaxed. ‚ÄúEmily is emotional, but she‚Äôs practical. She knows what‚Äôs best for A Designs. Once she sees the numbers, she‚Äôll come around.‚Äù  
  
One of the older men chuckled knowingly. ‚ÄúWomen. Always overthinking things.‚Äù  
  
Another executive leaned forward, his tone more serious. ‚ÄúWe can‚Äôt afford uncertainty with such a large investment on the line. If she‚Äôs distracted, perhaps we should consider transferring her shares into more‚Ä¶ reliable hands.‚Äù  
  
Mike‚Äôs fingers curled slightly against the table, though his smirk never wavered.  
  
That was exactly what he had been working toward.  
  
‚ÄúI was actually going to bring that up,‚Äù he said smoothly. ‚ÄúEmily‚Äôs shares should be consolidated under leadership that aligns with the company‚Äôs growth. She doesn‚Äôt handle the executive decisions anyway, so it makes sense for someone else‚Äîsomeone who understands our long-term vision‚Äîto manage them properly.‚Äù  
  
A few of the senior members exchanged glances. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs a delicate conversation. Her parents invested heavily into this company.‚Äù  
  
Mike leaned forward slightly, his voice taking on an air of calculated persuasion. ‚ÄúWhich is why it‚Äôs best for me to handle it. Emily trusts me. Once things settle down, I can talk to her about transferring her shares‚Äîframing it as a way to relieve her of business stress.‚Äù  
  
There were a few murmurs of agreement.  
  
‚ÄúIf anyone can convince her, it‚Äôs you,‚Äù one of the partners admitted.  
  
Mike took a slow sip of his coffee before setting the cup down, his movements deliberate.  
  
‚ÄúExactly.‚Äù  
  
There was no rush.  
  
Emily wasn‚Äôt impulsive. She was rational, loyal, and too tied to this company to walk away.  
  
This was just a phase.  
  
She would come back.  
  
And when she did, he would make sure those shares landed exactly where they belonged‚Äîin his hands.  
  
Mike let his fingers tap against the polished wood again, feeling entirely in control.  
  
The boardroom conversation moved forward, diving deeper into the Luthmere project, discussing potential investors, financial strategies, and risk mitigation.  
  
But in the back of his mind, Mike was already planning his next move.  
  
Emily would come back.  
  
She always did.  
  
And this time, when she did‚Äîhe would make sure she never had the power to leave again.  
  
As the boardroom discussion continued, Mike leaned back in his chair, the faintest smirk playing on his lips.  
  
Emily was predictable.  
  
She could throw a tantrum, ignore his calls, and even refuse to show up for important meetings‚Äîbut she would never walk away.  
  
He pictured her at home, sitting at her desk, sketching wedding ring designs with that same focused expression she always had when creating something delicate.  
  
She loved designing jewelry.  
  
And deep down, she still believed in them.  
  
She was emotional, sure. But when the dust settled, she would realize there was no point in fighting it.  
  
Emily Carter would always come back to him.  
  
Mike took another sip of his coffee, feeling the deep satisfaction of a man who had already won.  
  
But what none of them knew‚Äîwhat Mike himself was oblivious to‚Äîwas that while he sat there, basking in his illusion of control, Emily was somewhere else.  
  
Emily wasn‚Äôt at home, nor was she sketching wedding rings for their future.  
  
She was wearing one.  
  
Standing in a quiet chapel.  
  
Signing a marriage certificate.  
  
For a wedding that had absolutely nothing to do with him.  
  
**Chapter 14 A Vow in Silence**

The air was crisp, carrying the soft scent of early spring.  
  
„ÄÄ„ÄÄEmily stood before the mirror in the guest bedroom of the Blackwood estate, smoothing her hands over the dress.  
  
„ÄÄ„ÄÄIt fit like a dream.  
  
„ÄÄ„ÄÄPerfectly tailored, hugging her waist, flowing effortlessly as if it had been made for her and only her.  
  
„ÄÄ„ÄÄShe turned slightly, studying her reflection.  
  
„ÄÄ„ÄÄNo veil. No extravagant bridal jewelry.  
  
„ÄÄ„ÄÄJust this dress, simple heels, and the faintest trace of natural makeup.  
  
„ÄÄ„ÄÄShe looked‚Ä¶  
  
„ÄÄ„ÄÄLike herself.  
  
„ÄÄ„ÄÄNot a woman forced into a marriage.  
  
„ÄÄ„ÄÄNot a bride of convenience.  
  
„ÄÄ„ÄÄJust Emily.  
  
„ÄÄ„ÄÄA knock at the door made her turn.  
  
„ÄÄ„ÄÄLila peeked her head inside, then froze.  
  
„ÄÄ„ÄÄ‚Äú‚Ä¶Okay. I officially take back everything I said about this being a rushed disaster,‚Äùshe muttered, stepping inside.  
  
„ÄÄ„ÄÄEmily lifted a brow.‚ÄúWhat?‚Äù  
  
„ÄÄ„ÄÄLila waved a hand at the dress.‚ÄúYou look‚Äîdamn. I mean, my brother is still an i\*\*\*t for this whole plan, but at least he‚Äôs marrying someone who looks that good.‚Äù  
  
„ÄÄ„ÄÄEmily let out a soft laugh.‚ÄúThanks?‚Äù  
  
„ÄÄ„ÄÄLila crossed her arms, eyes narrowing slightly.‚Äú‚Ä¶Where did you even get that?‚Äù  
  
„ÄÄ„ÄÄEmily glanced down at the dress.‚ÄúAdrian had it sent over last night.‚Äù  
  
„ÄÄ„ÄÄLila blinked.‚ÄúAnd it‚Äôs that perfect?‚Äù  
  
„ÄÄ„ÄÄEmily hesitated.  
  
„ÄÄ„ÄÄ‚Äú‚Ä¶Yeah.‚Äù  
  
„ÄÄ„ÄÄLila stared at her for a long moment, then exhaled, shaking her head.‚ÄúYou know what? I don‚Äôt even want to know.‚Äù  
  
„ÄÄ„ÄÄShe clapped her hands together.‚ÄúAlright, let‚Äôs go get you married.‚Äù  
  
„ÄÄ„ÄÄThe chapel was small, bathed in warm morning light, tucked away in a secluded part of the city.  
  
„ÄÄ„ÄÄEmily had expected a courthouse‚Äîsomething cold and impersonal‚Äîbut instead, Adrian had chosen this.  
  
„ÄÄ„ÄÄGolden light filtered through the stained glass windows, casting soft colors across the polished wooden floors. The scent of fresh white roses lingered in the air, subtle yet undeniably deliberate.  
  
„ÄÄ„ÄÄIt felt‚Ä¶real.  
  
„ÄÄ„ÄÄToo real.  
  
„ÄÄ„ÄÄEmily swallowed as she stepped inside, her heels clicking softly against the stone floor.  
  
„ÄÄ„ÄÄAt the front of the chapel, Adrian stood waiting.  
  
„ÄÄ„ÄÄHe was dressed in a sharp black suit‚Äînot a tie in sight, the top button undone just enough to make him look effortlessly composed.  
  
„ÄÄ„ÄÄHis golden hair caught the light, his posture relaxed yet commanding.  
  
„ÄÄ„ÄÄAnd when he looked up‚Äî  
  
„ÄÄ„ÄÄHis piercing blue eyes locked onto hers instantly.  
  
„ÄÄ„ÄÄSomething in her chest tightened.  
  
„ÄÄ„ÄÄShe reached the altar, standing beside Adrian.  
  
„ÄÄ„ÄÄ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre on time,‚Äùhe murmured.  
  
„ÄÄ„ÄÄEmily lifted a brow.‚ÄúWere you expecting me to run?‚Äù  
  
„ÄÄ„ÄÄHis gaze flickered with something unreadable.  
  
„ÄÄ„ÄÄThen, a ghost of a smile.  
  
„ÄÄ„ÄÄ‚ÄúNo.‚Äù  
  
„ÄÄ„ÄÄThe officiant cleared his throat.‚ÄúShall we begin?‚Äù  
  
„ÄÄ„ÄÄ‚ÄúMarriage is a sacred bond, a promise to stand by one another through joy and sorrow, through wealth and hardship, in sickness and in health. It is a union of trust, of devotion‚Äîof choosing one another every single day.‚Äù  
  
„ÄÄ„ÄÄEmily‚Äôs fingers curled slightly at her sides.  
  
„ÄÄ„ÄÄShe hadn‚Äôt expected the weight of those words to settle over her so heavily.  
  
„ÄÄ„ÄÄThis wasn‚Äôt real.  
  
„ÄÄ„ÄÄAnd yet, standing beneath the soft glow of stained glass, the quiet intimacy of the moment made her stomach tighten.  
  
„ÄÄ„ÄÄAdrian, standing beside her, remained as composed as ever. His posture was relaxed, but his fingers twitched slightly at his side, a small movement Emily might have missed had she not been standing so close.  
  
„ÄÄ„ÄÄThe officiant continued.  
  
„ÄÄ„ÄÄ‚ÄúNow, the exchange of rings. A symbol of eternity‚Äîwithout beginning, without end.‚Äù  
  
„ÄÄ„ÄÄEmily froze.  
  
„ÄÄ„ÄÄRings?  
  
„ÄÄ„ÄÄShe hadn‚Äôt even thought about that. Had they forgotten‚Äî  
  
„ÄÄ„ÄÄBut then, Adrian reached into the pocket of his suit jacket.  
  
„ÄÄ„ÄÄAnd pulled out two rings.  
  
„ÄÄ„ÄÄA simple, elegant matching set of bands.  
  
„ÄÄ„ÄÄHer breath caught.  
  
„ÄÄ„ÄÄShe had no idea when he had arranged this, when he had taken her ring size, when he had thought ahead in a way she hadn‚Äôt even considered.  
  
„ÄÄ„ÄÄThe officiant smiled approvingly.  
  
„ÄÄ„ÄÄ‚ÄúAdrian, if you would place the ring on Emily‚Äôs finger.‚Äù  
  
„ÄÄ„ÄÄAdrian‚Äôs expression remained unreadable as he took her left hand in his own, his fingers warm against hers.  
  
„ÄÄ„ÄÄAnd then‚Äî  
  
„ÄÄ„ÄÄHe slid the ring onto her finger.  
  
„ÄÄ„ÄÄPerfect fit.  
  
„ÄÄ„ÄÄOf course.  
  
„ÄÄ„ÄÄEmily swallowed, the cool weight of the metal pressing against her skin like a quiet truth she didn‚Äôt know how to face yet.  
  
„ÄÄ„ÄÄShe took the other ring, hesitating for half a second before lifting Adrian‚Äôs hand.  
  
„ÄÄ„ÄÄHis fingers were steady. Warm.  
  
„ÄÄ„ÄÄShe slid the ring onto his finger.  
  
„ÄÄ„ÄÄAnother perfect fit.  
  
„ÄÄ„ÄÄShe didn‚Äôt look up, afraid of what she might see in his expression.  
  
„ÄÄ„ÄÄThe officiant gave a small nod.  
  
„ÄÄ„ÄÄ‚ÄúNow, if you‚Äôll both step forward to sign the certificate.‚Äù  
  
„ÄÄ„ÄÄEmily inhaled deeply as she followed Adrian to the small wooden table beside the altar.  
  
„ÄÄ„ÄÄThe official document lay open, the inked lines sharp against the ivory paper.  
  
„ÄÄ„ÄÄAdrian took the pen first.  
  
„ÄÄ„ÄÄHis movements were smooth, without hesitation, as he signed his name:  
  
„ÄÄ„ÄÄAdrian Blackwood.  
  
„ÄÄ„ÄÄThen, he handed her the pen.  
  
„ÄÄ„ÄÄEmily hesitated.  
  
„ÄÄ„ÄÄNot because she doubted her choice.  
  
„ÄÄ„ÄÄBut because this was the moment everything changed.  
  
„ÄÄ„ÄÄShe inhaled.  
  
„ÄÄ„ÄÄAnd then, in one smooth motion, she signed her name.  
  
„ÄÄ„ÄÄEmily Carter.  
  
„ÄÄ„ÄÄThe officiant smiled, stamping the paper.  
  
„ÄÄ„ÄÄ‚ÄúBy the power vested in me, I now pronounce you husband and wife.‚Äù  
  
„ÄÄ„ÄÄEmily let out a breath, her grip on the pen loosening.  
  
„ÄÄ„ÄÄIt was done.  
  
„ÄÄ„ÄÄShe was married.  
  
„ÄÄ„ÄÄBefore she could fully process it, the officiant smiled again.  
  
„ÄÄ„ÄÄ‚ÄúYou may now kiss the bride.‚Äù  
  
„ÄÄ„ÄÄHer breath hitched.  
  
„ÄÄ„ÄÄShe turned, meeting Adrian‚Äôs gaze, suddenly very aware of the fact that she hadn‚Äôt thought about this part.  
  
„ÄÄ„ÄÄThey hadn‚Äôt discussed it.  
  
„ÄÄ„ÄÄShe wasn‚Äôt sure what to expect.  
  
„ÄÄ„ÄÄWould he just brush it off? Would he make it obvious this wasn‚Äôt real? Would he‚Äî  
  
„ÄÄ„ÄÄAdrian tilted his head slightly, as if assessing her reaction, and then‚Äî  
  
„ÄÄ„ÄÄHe kissed her.  
  
„ÄÄ„ÄÄNot on the lips.  
  
„ÄÄ„ÄÄNot something meant for show.  
  
„ÄÄ„ÄÄBut a slow, deliberate kiss to her forehead.  
  
„ÄÄ„ÄÄWarm. Measured.  
  
„ÄÄ„ÄÄAnd somehow‚Ä¶undeniably possessive.  
  
„ÄÄ„ÄÄA quiet claim, though she didn‚Äôt understand it yet.  
  
„ÄÄ„ÄÄ  
  


# Chapter 15 Trust Your Choices

Emily‚Äôs fingers curled slightly at her sides.  
  
„ÄÄ„ÄÄThe moment he pulled away, the click of a camera shutter broke the silence.  
  
„ÄÄ„ÄÄEmily blinked, only now realizing that a photographer and videographer were standing nearby.  
  
„ÄÄ„ÄÄShe turned to Adrian, startled.‚ÄúYou‚Äî‚Äù  
  
„ÄÄ„ÄÄEmily hadn‚Äôt even thought about photos, she had assumed a contract marriage wouldn‚Äôt require such sentimental gestures.  
  
„ÄÄ„ÄÄBut Adrian had arranged everything.  
  
„ÄÄ„ÄÄWithout a word, he placed a hand on her lower back and guided her toward the chapel‚Äôs grand wooden doors. The photographer motioned for them to stand together at the steps, the aged stone providing a regal backdrop.  
  
„ÄÄ„ÄÄ‚ÄúCloser,‚Äùthe photographer instructed.  
  
„ÄÄ„ÄÄEmily hesitated for a split second before Adrian closed the gap between them effortlessly, his hand resting lightly against her waist.  
  
„ÄÄ„ÄÄThe camera clicked.  
  
„ÄÄ„ÄÄThey moved to the small garden beside the chapel, where delicate white roses bloomed against an old iron gate. A few tourists had gathered nearby, admiring the quaint beauty of the place.  
  
„ÄÄ„ÄÄAs the photographer adjusted the lens, a young woman from the group of tourists gasped.  
  
„ÄÄ„ÄÄ‚ÄúOh my God, you just got married? Congratulations!‚Äù  
  
„ÄÄ„ÄÄEmily stiffened.  
  
„ÄÄ„ÄÄAnother woman smiled warmly.‚ÄúThis chapel is so beautiful‚Äîwe were actually thinking of having our wedding here too! Seeing you two makes me even more sure of it.‚Äù  
  
„ÄÄ„ÄÄEmily opened her mouth, unsure how to respond.  
  
„ÄÄ„ÄÄShe felt strangely exposed.  
  
„ÄÄ„ÄÄThey weren‚Äôt really married.  
  
„ÄÄ„ÄÄNot in the way these strangers believed.  
  
„ÄÄ„ÄÄBut before she could think of an appropriate response, Adrian spoke smoothly,‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a perfect place for a wedding.‚Äù  
  
„ÄÄ„ÄÄHis voice carried such calm certainty that even Emily almost believed it.  
  
„ÄÄ„ÄÄThe tourists beamed.  
  
„ÄÄ„ÄÄ‚ÄúWould you mind if we took a photo with you? For good luck?‚Äùone of them asked.  
  
„ÄÄ„ÄÄEmily hesitated.  
  
„ÄÄ„ÄÄA photo? With strangers? As a newlywed couple?  
  
„ÄÄ„ÄÄShe turned slightly toward Adrian, half expecting him to decline‚Äî  
  
„ÄÄ„ÄÄBut he didn‚Äôt.  
  
„ÄÄ„ÄÄInstead, he gave her a brief glance, as if checking her reaction. When she didn‚Äôt immediately refuse, he gave a small nod to the tourists.  
  
„ÄÄ„ÄÄ‚ÄúOf course.‚Äù  
  
„ÄÄ„ÄÄBefore she could overthink it, they were surrounded. Someone handed their phone to the photographer, and soon Emily found herself standing between Adrian and an enthusiastic couple, smiling stiffly.  
  
„ÄÄ„ÄÄAdrian, ever composed, stood beside her, his presence effortlessly commanding.  
  
„ÄÄ„ÄÄThe camera clicked.  
  
„ÄÄ„ÄÄA picture of a perfect, happy couple.  
  
„ÄÄ„ÄÄBy the time they left the chapel, Adrian‚Äôs driver was already waiting. The sleek black Rolls-Royce gleamed under the morning sun.  
  
As the driver opened the door for them, Emily reached into her purse, casually checking her phone.  
  
Mike.  
  
Her stomach tightened as she read the message:  
  
Mike: You didn‚Äôt show up to the shareholder meeting today. That was childish.  
  
Mike: We had important decisions to vote on. If you still want to marry me, stop acting out.  
  
Emily stared at the screen.  
  
A slow, familiar frustration bubbled up in her chest.  
  
Before she could type a response, Adrian reached past her and opened the car door.  
  
She turned, surprised to see his face set in an unreadable expression. But he wasn‚Äôt looking at her‚Äîhe was looking at her phone screen.  
  
For the briefest moment, she thought she saw something flicker across his face.  
  
Displeasure?  
  
Annoyance?  
  
But just as quickly, he turned his gaze away.  
  
‚ÄúGet in,‚Äù Adrian said, his voice even.  
  
Emily hesitated for only a second before stepping into the car.  
  
Adrian followed, settling beside her in the spacious backseat.  
  
The door shut with a quiet thud, enclosing them in the smooth leather interior.  
  
She continued typing, ignoring the slight tension in the air.  
  
Adrian‚Äôs voice broke the silence.  
  
‚ÄúThey‚Äôre still making you work today?‚Äù  
  
Emily shook her head. ‚ÄúNo‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs the shareholder meeting.‚Äù  
  
She hesitated before adding, ‚ÄúThey‚Äôre trying to place a bid on a major project. The Luthmere Luxury Towers Development.‚Äù  
  
Adrian tilted his head slightly, his sharp blue eyes assessing her. ‚ÄúAnd?‚Äù  
  
Emily hesitated. ‚ÄúThey need my vote.‚Äù  
  
‚ÄúAnd how do you plan to vote?‚Äù  
  
She inhaled, gripping her phone a little tighter.  
  
‚ÄúI‚Äôm against it.‚Äù  
  
Adrian studied her for a moment.  
  
‚ÄúDid you prepare an argument?‚Äù he asked.  
  
Emily nodded. ‚ÄúYes. I analyzed the risks. The investment is too aggressive. Luthmere‚Äôs contracts are notorious for hidden legal traps. If we take on that project and something goes wrong, we could end up with a financial disaster.‚Äù  
  
Adrian was silent for a moment.  
  
Then, he nodded.  
  
‚ÄúYou did well.‚Äù  
  
Emily blinked.  
  
She wasn‚Äôt expecting praise.  
  
She wasn‚Äôt used to it.  
  
As a shareholder, she had spent most of her time being dismissed, overridden, or treated as irrelevant.  
  
No one had ever told her, You did well.  
  
Her fingers curled slightly against her lap.  
  
Adrian‚Äôs voice was calm, certain. ‚ÄúYou need to trust your own judgment. Your reasoning is sound. Don‚Äôt let them make you doubt yourself.‚Äù  
  
Something about the way he said it made Emily‚Äôs chest tighten.  
  
She had spent years being subtly told her opinions weren‚Äôt important. That she was just there because of who she was with, not because she had anything of value to contribute.  
  
But here was Adrian.  
  
Someone who barely spoke more than necessary.  
  
Someone who never wasted words.  
  
Telling her she was right.  
  
Emily turned slightly toward him, her voice quieter than before.  
  
‚Äú‚Ä¶Thank you.‚Äù  
  
Adrian glanced at her, the corners of his lips barely curving.  
  
‚ÄúDon‚Äôt thank me.‚Äù  
  
His gaze flickered toward her phone.  
  
‚ÄúJust make sure you don‚Äôt let them push you around.‚Äù  
  
Emily nodded, her grip on the phone loosening.  
  


# Chapter 16 Bound by More Than Words

The hum of the engine filled the car, a steady rhythm against the soft leather interior. The city lights flickered past, casting fleeting golden streaks along the tinted windows.  
  
Emily absentmindedly adjusted her grip on her phone, still distracted by the conversation they‚Äôd just had. But before she could properly settle it in her hand, her fingers slipped.  
  
The device tumbled straight onto Adrian‚Äôs lap.  
  
She sucked in a sharp breath.  
  
Without thinking, she leaned forward to grab it‚Äî  
  
And froze.  
  
Her fingers had barely brushed the phone when she realized just how close she was.  
  
Close enough that her shoulder pressed lightly against his chest.  
  
Close enough that when she tilted her head slightly upward, she could see the dark lashes framing his deep blue eyes.  
  
Close enough that the warmth of his breath brushed against her cheek.  
  
Her own breath caught in her throat.  
  
For a moment, neither of them moved.  
  
The space between them had disappeared so effortlessly that it felt almost deliberate.  
  
Then, with quick precision, Emily snatched the phone, straightening immediately and shifting a little to the side.  
  
‚ÄúSorry,‚Äù she muttered. ‚ÄúI wasn‚Äôt holding it properly.‚Äù  
  
Adrian didn‚Äôt reply right away.  
  
Instead, his gaze lingered on her, unreadable, before his lips curved‚Äînot quite a smirk, not quite a smile, but something in between.  
  
Then, in a voice laced with dry amusement, he said, ‚ÄúIf you wanted to be in my arms, wife, you could‚Äôve just asked.‚Äù  
  
Emily stared at him, heat creeping up her neck.  
  
Adrian‚Äôs tone was perfectly smooth, unhurried, as if this was nothing more than an innocent observation.  
  
Which, of course, made it worse.  
  
She let out a soft scoff, shaking her head. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs an interesting way to interpret things.‚Äù  
  
Adrian exhaled lightly, as if this entire exchange mildly amused him, before leaning back into his seat.  
  
‚ÄúWell,‚Äù he mused, glancing at her sideways, a trace of amusement flickering in his eyes, ‚Äúas your husband, it‚Äôs only right that I offer you some support when you need it.‚Äù  
  
Emily huffed a quiet laugh, shaking her head. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs a very generous interpretation of what just happened.‚Äù  
  
Adrian tilted his head slightly. ‚ÄúIs it?‚Äù  
  
His voice was calm, effortless‚Äîbut there was something in his gaze, something unreadable beneath the teasing.  
  
Emily decided not to dwell on it.  
  
Instead, she exhaled, settling back into her seat. ‚ÄúAnyway,‚Äù she said, steering the conversation forward, ‚ÄúI need to go back to the company for the next shareholder meeting. It‚Äôs scheduled for the day after tomorrow.‚Äù  
  
Adrian tilted his head slightly. ‚ÄúTo vote on the Luthmere Project?‚Äù  
  
‚ÄúYes.‚Äù  
  
She hesitated.  
  
‚ÄúAnd possibly something else.‚Äù  
  
He arched a brow. ‚ÄúSomething else?‚Äù  
  
Emily exhaled. ‚ÄúThey‚Äôve been trying to pressure me into transferring my shares for months now. They want them under someone they trust.‚Äù  
  
Adrian didn‚Äôt respond immediately, but Emily could tell he had already guessed the answer.  
  
She forced the words out anyway.  
  
‚ÄúThey think the best candidate is Mike.‚Äù  
  
A slow silence stretched between them.  
  
Adrian‚Äôs expression remained unreadable, but the air shifted.  
  
Then, in the same measured tone, he said, ‚ÄúI have a proposal for you.‚Äù  
  
Emily frowned slightly. ‚ÄúWhat is it?‚Äù  
  
Adrian‚Äôs voice was calm, assured. ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt go to the shareholder meeting.‚Äù  
  
Emily blinked. ‚Äú‚Ä¶What?‚Äù  
  
‚ÄúI‚Äôll send a lawyer in your place,‚Äù he said simply.  
  
She hesitated. ‚ÄúWould that even be appropriate?‚Äù  
  
Adrian exhaled lightly, shaking his head. ‚ÄúEmily.‚Äù  
  
The way he said her name‚Äîfirm, yet somehow indulgent‚Äîmade her pulse stutter for half a second.  
  
‚ÄúYou‚Äôre my wife,‚Äù he continued smoothly. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs nothing inappropriate about it.‚Äù  
  
Before she could protest, he was already pulling out his phone.  
  
Emily watched as he dialed a number, speaking the moment the call connected.  
  
‚ÄúI need you to attend the A Designs shareholder meeting the day after tomorrow,‚Äù Adrian said, voice calm yet commanding. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôll represent my wife‚Äôs interests‚Äîspecifically regarding her vote on the Luthmere Project and the potential transfer of her shares.‚Äù  
  
A brief pause.  
  
Then, in a more businesslike tone, he continued, ‚ÄúI‚Äôll send you the full details and necessary documentation later. Have everything prepared accordingly.‚Äù  
  
Another pause.  
  
Then, the voice on the other end responded loud enough for Emily to hear.  
  
‚ÄúUnderstood. And, sir‚Äîcongratulations on your marriage.‚Äù  
  
Emily stiffened.  
  
Adrian didn‚Äôt even flinch.  
  
He merely gave a faint hum of acknowledgment before ending the call and slipping the phone back into his pocket.  
  
When he turned to her, Emily was still staring at him.  
  
He lifted a brow. ‚ÄúSomething wrong?‚Äù  
  
She hesitated.  
  
‚ÄúNo, I just‚Ä¶ It all happened so fast.‚Äù  
  
Adrian tilted his head slightly. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôd rather be the one sitting in that boardroom, arguing with people who don‚Äôt respect your decisions?‚Äù  
  
Emily exhaled. ‚Äú‚Ä¶No.‚Äù  
  
His lips curved slightly. ‚ÄúThen trust me.‚Äù  
  
The word settled over her too easily, slipping into the cracks of her hesitation before she could stop it.  
  
She shouldn‚Äôt trust him this much.  
  
Shouldn‚Äôt let him take over so effortlessly.  
  
But the truth was‚Äî  
  
For the first time in a long while, she didn‚Äôt feel like she was fighting alone.
