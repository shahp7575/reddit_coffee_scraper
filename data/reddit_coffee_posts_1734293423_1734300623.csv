To myself I thought that I always liked these rainy days. While others might find it dreary and gloomy, I found comfort in it. Even outside. I took my black raincoat from the rack, slipped into some loafers and rushed out on the streets. Funny how the rainy weather helped me get up easier. I wandered around in the rain and half an hour later found myself sitting in the same cafe as everyday for the past couple of months. Two coffees later the anxiety kicked in. Will there be a day passing by without that depressive thoughts crippling me? Would some company easen my mind? At this point I couldn't tell anymore, so long had I been alone. My mood turned dark. The burden of my existence weighed heavy upon my soul. Just another day. Quiet and lonely.

1hf3kdq,https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/1hf3kdq/the_power_of_doing_what_you_dont_want_to_doand/,The Power of Doing What You Don‚Äôt Want to Do‚ÄîAnd Doing It Anyway,"One of the most powerful tools in my recovery has been my daily routine. It‚Äôs a simple routine‚Äînot a marathon or some grueling checklist‚Äîbut it‚Äôs deliberate and non-negotiable. It consists of three key practices: praying, walking, and reading scripture. These three things may seem small, but their impact on my life has been enormous. The catch? I don‚Äôt always *want* to do them. And that‚Äôs where the magic happens.

# The Routine That Changed Everything

Every morning, before I even get out of bed, I pray. I start with the Lord‚Äôs Prayer, follow it with the Serenity Prayer, and then ask God to remove any self-seeking motives so I can be more useful to Him. From there, I lace up my shoes and head out for a walk. This isn‚Äôt just physical exercise; it‚Äôs a meditative time when I continue my prayers and listen for God‚Äôs voice. Often, this is when He reveals what I should write about or focus on for the day. Finally, I carve out time to read scripture. These three simple actions set the tone for my entire day and keep me grounded in my recovery.

# The Day I Didn‚Äôt Feel Like It

The other morning, I woke up feeling far from my best. My neck ached, my knees were sore, and a dull headache made getting out of bed seem like a monumental task. After my prayer, I decided to ‚Äútake it easy‚Äù on myself. Maybe my aches and pains were a sign from God that I deserved a day off from my routine. So, I poured myself some coffee and settled in.

But after just a few sips, a nagging thought surfaced: *You‚Äôve made this commitment for a reason. Don‚Äôt let excuses derail you.* Begrudgingly, I put on my shoes and headed out for my walk. Half a mile in, something incredible happened. My aches started to fade, my headache disappeared, and I found myself enjoying the fresh air and the beauty of nature. I ended up walking farther than I typically do, feeling energized and grateful.

# The Power of Persistence

Another day, I found myself battling boredom. I had more idle time than usual, and my routine urged me to pick up my Bible. But the thought of reading didn‚Äôt appeal to me at all. I figured I‚Äôd just stare at the words, distracted and disinterested. Still, I pushed myself to open to the book of Psalms. To my surprise, I was immediately drawn in. It didn‚Äôt feel like reading; it felt like uncovering the secrets of the universe. Despite not being much of a reader, I couldn‚Äôt put it down. That experience reaffirmed the importance of sticking to my routine, even when it feels inconvenient or unappealing.

# Recognizing the Enemy‚Äôs Lies

Moments like these have taught me how deceptive the enemy can be. The world conditions us to believe that bettering ourselves is boring, unfun, or unnecessary. It‚Äôs easy to slip back into the comforts of idleness‚Äîlying in bed all day, binge-watching shows, ordering takeout, or indulging in vices like alcohol. That‚Äôs the lie: that these things bring happiness. But they don‚Äôt. They lead to stagnation and misery.

The truth is, we are far more capable than we give ourselves credit for. We often tell ourselves we‚Äôre stuck: *I can‚Äôt get out of this rut. I can‚Äôt exercise because of my back. I‚Äôm depressed.* While some challenges are legitimate and beyond our control, many excuses are just that‚Äîexcuses. The discipline of doing what we don‚Äôt want to do, even when it‚Äôs hard, can break those chains.

# The Slippery Slope of Justification

The old me would have jumped at any excuse to skip my routine. But I‚Äôve learned how dangerous that mindset is. Skipping one day can lead to skipping another, and before long, you‚Äôve fallen back into the habits you worked so hard to escape. It‚Äôs a slippery slope, and the consequences aren‚Äôt worth it. Recovery is about progress, not perfection, but consistency is key.

# The Discipline That Builds Confidence

For me, the routine isn‚Äôt just about praying, walking, or reading scripture‚Äîit‚Äôs about discipline. Sticking to these commitments has given me confidence, purpose, and a newfound love for myself. It‚Äôs shown me that I am capable of far more than I once believed. And that discipline spills over into other areas of my life, strengthening my recovery and my relationship with God.

# A Challenge for You

If you‚Äôre feeling stuck or unmotivated, I challenge you to create your own routine. Choose three simple, meaningful actions that you commit to doing every day‚Äîrain or shine, no excuses. These should be things that nourish your soul and push you toward growth. They don‚Äôt have to be monumental. Maybe it‚Äôs a daily gratitude list, a short meditation, or a phone call to check in on someone you love. Whatever it is, stick to it. You‚Äôll be amazed at how it transforms your mindset and your life.

Stop believing the lies the world tells you. You are capable of far more than you think. Don‚Äôt let excuses hold you back from becoming the person God created you to be. The path to freedom and joy isn‚Äôt always easy, but it‚Äôs always worth it.

I am very much only interested in a monogamous connection, so single and unattached ladies only, please! The kind of relationship I am seeking is one that feels like the first sip of coffee in the morning, or the first splash of hot water from the shower after a long day, but all the time. I want you to feel like your heart is wrapped up in the fuzziest of blankets; safe, protected, and comfortable at all times.


To get some of the more important things out of the way, I am very left leaning in my social politics, not-religious at all, and I‚Äôm child-free. In the future and with the right partner I could be open to fostering or adoption, but do not want biological children of my own. I believe in putting kindness and love out into the world, even when it is hard. I am big on community building, support groups and being there for the people in my life. I am pretty bad about giving great advice but not applying the same wisdom to myself. I often overextend myself trying to please everyone, and need time to recharge my social battery. 


As for some more basic interests, I do a fair amount of volunteering. I rescue cats and work with seniors and the food insecure. I love gaming of most kinds, with a preference for in-person tabletop and board games. Need a board game suggestion? I got you! I‚Äôm a big sci-fi nerd, with most of my favourite movies being in the genre. That said, the LOTR trilogy is unmatched in my opinion and I watch them frequently. 


Not fit, not fat. Generally prefer the same in a partner but don‚Äôt have a ‚Äòtype.‚Äô I‚Äôm a sucker for giggles and sass! I rock the dad-bod, future Santa Clause impersonator aesthetic. Bit of a belly, bald, heavily bearded and very tall. Something unique about me is I have heterochromia. I rarely drink and do not smoke. I am DDF. I don‚Äôt gamble or have any other traditional vices. My addictions include too many cookies, petting every dog I see outside, and adding way too many things to my watch and read lists. 


I am not the most experienced when it comes to love and dating. I lost a previous partner to cancer, and have since spent most of my energy on community building, self-improvement and caring for a family member‚Äôs medical needs. I now have a firm grasp on who I am, faults and all, as well as what I want from life. Hopefully that is you!",1,1734299924.0,ForeverAloneDating,1,1.0,False
1hf3iey,https://www.reddit.com/r/ExNoContact/comments/1hf3iey/my_5_month_update/,My 5 month update,"This breakup has been such a whirlwind and learning experience for me. I really loved my ex, and I still hold a lot of love for him. We were together 2.5 yrs. 

We broke up due to differences we couldnt reconcile, mostly that we're from different places and neither of us wanted to start a life away from our support systems. After trying out my city, he moved back to his hometown and ended things. He was honest and told me he was worried he would grow resentful if he settled in my city long term, away from his friends & family. I don't expect everyone to understand this, but we're both from cultures where family is very tight-knit. 

We went NC for 4 months. Just two weeks ago, we met for coffee. It was very bittersweet, we mostly caught up and had some laughs. He gave me a long hug. Later, we texted briefly where he said the following: ""I miss you and will always miss you. In another life we'd want the same things and everything would be perfect.""

It was hard for me to hear these words after not speaking to him or knowing how he's feeling for a whole 4 months. I've found myself feeling a wave of complex emotions at month 5. I dont feel the same raw pain that I used to, but I see reminders of him everywhere I look, and its hard not wondering how things would've worked out ""in another life."" I don't know if he's found someone else but that's a hard pill to swallow, as I don't feel I have the emotional availability to open up to someone else yet. 

I'm hoping it will only get easier from here! ",1,1734299859.0,ExNoContact,0,1.0,False

also, when I started I could not find any cheap used setups. people wanted $200 for a dirty 10gallon tank, or $500 for a 20gallon. so I think doing it with retail(but can be on sale) prices is a good way to show people anyone can do it

of course you could go cheaper and have an empty tank, if that's what you want to show off, then do it. you could probably get better fish if you do. 

I also think one free natural/decoration is ok. maybe you have a sea shell or a rock you think is pretty(just make sure it's safe for in the tank and clean it). maybe like me you throw in a plant cutting from a friend/etc. heck, if you want to do a setup with a comedic coffee mug I think that's cool. something to personalize it is great. I just don't want a 'someone gifted me a 100gallon saltwater setup for free' type thing. that's not realistic for 99.9% of us

this is my rough guidelines. if you can show cheaper prices, great, let's have it. 

https://imgur.com/a/100-100-retail-10gallon-challenge-bU8j7eE

so I have some of the stuff, so I basically just redecorated a 10gallon tank I already had, used a cheap filter/heater/lid/light that came from another kit, tossed in some new gravel, used plants/wood I already had(but would follow the criteria I listed), then picked up a new cheap fish

and here's my final result. which anyone can copy for $100

If anyone is able to give my symptoms and notes a read through and provide ANYTHING that‚Äôs helped you or share experiences I will be eternally grateful

Symptoms
- Lower abdominal period cramps with intermittent intense sharp stabbing lower abdominal pain that takes my breath away
- Pain (both sharp and dull) around belly button, both sides
- Pain either side of my lower abdomen - I assume ovaries (right has been much worse but the left one seems to be making up for lost time in the past few weeks)
- Feeling that my abdominal organs are stuck together or to muscles causing discomfort and pain. Dragging dull or sharp stabbing pain when emptying bowel and occasionally bladder, the same pulling pain when I lift things or move my body too quickly (seriously I have to get up from the sofa sooo carefully)
- Upper abdominal pain (diagnosed as gastritis a couple of years ago, can be mostly controlled via diet)
- Butt lightning, takes my breath away
- Aching pain in my butt, vagina, vulva and groin
- Intense period type lower back and flank pain
- Period type pain spreading down thighs, fizzling into achy cotton wool legs that don‚Äôt hold me up (right leg worse)
- Pressure between ribs & get breathless and shaky very easily
- Always bloated (diet does not seem to make a difference)
- Get freezing cold or overheat very easily, can‚Äôt self regulate temperature 
- Intermittent nausea
- Breast pain at PMS times
- Bad headaches 3-5 days per week 
- Fatigue, so much fatigue
- Hopelessness and depression because my life is falling apart due to these symptoms and anxiety about leaving the house or managing any deadlines etc. 

I had the mirena coil put in three years ago, it made some of my symptoms better (previously I had a very heavy flow whereas now I don‚Äôt bleed at all). My GP said the consultant may want to try taking it out before doing a lap but I‚Äôm terrified that would make me even worse as I already had most of the symptoms to begin with?! 

I‚Äôm going to try cutting various foods out out eg dairy to see if that helps at all. I have to keep sugar intake fairly low for the gastritis, and I try to get variety and protein. I don‚Äôt have meat, spicy foods or coffee at all and only drink one glass of alcohol per week. I have lots of ginger tea and used to do light exercise (swimming, walking and yoga) but haven‚Äôt been able to over the last couple of months.

I‚Äôm on gastritis meds, an antidepressant, iron, vitamin D, B12 injections, and propranolol for migraine prevention

I don‚Äôt take any pain killers because I can‚Äôt take ibuprofen due to having gastritis, paracetamol does nothing and everything stronger is for limited time use only. I just rely on my heat pads (the skin on my stomach is badly burnt at this point but I‚Äôve got no other choice and how my belly looks is the least of my problems).

Trying to get another GP appointment this week and beg for help again but I‚Äôm not sure they‚Äôll do anything. I‚Äôve had to quit my job because the pain is so bad I became way too unreliable, some days I can barely move so there‚Äôs no way I could get to work.

Admittedly, it has been a rough few months. There have been a couple times she would get frustrated with me and her go-to would be to give me the silent treatment for a week or two. She would respond to my greetings and nothing more. Eventually we talked it out, and I thought we were finally past it. This was about two months ago.

About two weeks ago, my wife started giving me the cold shoulder again. She would avoid giving me eye contact and would actively avoid having conversations with me, saying she did not want to talk. Last Sunday, I finally tried to confront her about this. She again said she had nothing to say and asked me to leave her alone. I told her that when she acts like this it makes me feel worthless, unvalued, and unloved. She just continued to ignore me and I stormed off, saying that if her goal was to make me feel like sh\*t then she achieved it.  Afterwards, she doubled down, and now will not even respond to my greetings, essentially pretending I am not even in the room.

This morning I again extended a greeting, and she ignored me. I said, ""still not talking to me, huh?"" and again, no response. I got frustrated, dumped my cup of coffee in the sink and told her that I do not know what I did for her to hate me but nothing would be solved if we did not talk about it, before walking off. 

For context, she has been very stressed and depressed because of her job, which heavily overworks and underpays her, and I know she has a tendency to shut everything out when she is overwhelmed. But this time around, it seems she is only doing this to me. She is still speaking to her family when they reach out to her. It is only me that she refuses to even acknowledge. It honestly is making me feel very resentful, depressed, and worthless. 

I do not know what to do anymore. I tried speaking with her multiple times. I even wrote a letter expressing my desire to talk, that I love her, and that I want to understand what is wrong. Nothing. She just left my letter on the counter. It has been two weeks now and I don't know what to do.",3,1734299448.0,Marriage,13,1.0,False

‚ÄúS..sure.‚Äù¬†All the tears had left my voice, at this point everything was cold and numb, like wading through static.¬†

‚ÄúWill three-thirty work for you?‚Äù

No time was good for me, but what choice did I have? If I refused it would seem suspicious.¬†‚ÄúYea, I‚Äôll come down.‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôm so sorry this happened, Ms. Kelly, but the more information we have the sooner we can solve this.‚Äù

*Or the sooner you can lazily pin this on someone and close the case.*¬†‚ÄúI¬†understand, you have my full cooperation.¬†I¬†want this solved too.‚Äù

‚ÄúAlright,¬†we‚Äôll see you then.‚Äù

The phone went silent.¬†

She¬†had died horribly, and I was going to find out who did this and make them suffer. Suffer worse than she had. Outside of my house was a pile of firewood.¬†I¬†searched it until I found a plank of oak.¬†I¬†would make a spirit board, but not the cheap Ouija that Parker Brothers shilled out to curious teenagers.

I¬†carefully burned the words into the wooden panel. The smell of scorched cedar stung my lungs and my eyes were sore from crying , it didn‚Äôt matter.¬†I¬†found a pattern of the sun and moon and followed each detail until both images were pristine. ¬†I¬†struck my index finger with a sewing needle and the thirsty wood absorb my blood. Choosing a smaller block of wood, I carved a planchette, it was nothing more than a simple pointer but it would work. Finally, I placed a photo of Lily at the top. By the time my work was completed my hands were sore and the sun was breaking out over the sky.¬†

Concentrating I asked what the board wanted.¬†I¬†was so exhausted the planchette floated to the letters with no fanfare.

*G O T O SLEEP.*

‚ÄúLily, is that you?‚Äù

*YES.*

‚ÄúHow can I help?‚Äù

*D R E A M*

¬†The air suddenly grew cold and I wrapped a blanket around me.¬†I¬†wanted to sink into the couch, into the floor and into the cold damp earth, never to wake again.

I¬†woke to the weight of cold chains around my ankles, ¬†pleading with the man to let me go. The smell of exhaust at the engine started and the searing pain at my body dragged against the road.¬†

I¬†woke to my heart pounding and my couch drenched in sweat.¬†It¬†was dark out, the clock silently ticking. My phone read that it was close to three am, the witching hour. There were five missed calls from the local police department.¬†

I¬†made some coffee and drank it black, enjoying it‚Äôs warmth and bitterness. My phone vibrated against me and answered. The tired officer on the other line, I told him that I passed out and I was sorry and agreed to meet him in the afternoon for questioning.¬†

I¬†reviewed my handiwork from the night before. A plain cedar board with ornate wooden letters carved into it. The sun and moon looked ornate, the yes and no were slightly off center but that didn‚Äôt matter.¬†I¬†took some silver and gold paint and filled in the sun and moon before slapping a clear code of lacquer over the board. Parker Brother‚Äôs eat your heart out.

I¬†got into my small silver car and left toward the police station. Entering the office to a tired looking officer with thinning hair.¬†

‚ÄúCandace Williams, I‚Äôm here to discuss the Lily Henderson case.‚Äù

The officer‚Äôs eyes dropped.¬†‚ÄúMa‚Äôam, I‚Äôm sorry for your loss.¬†I‚Äôm detective Thompson. please come on back to the office.‚Äù

The office was surprisingly cozy. A simple desk with a computer sat next to a few office chairs.¬†I¬†took a seat in one as the Detective sat across from me.

‚ÄúMs. Williams, can I get you anything, a coffee or donut perhaps?‚Äù¬†He¬†smiled warmly.

‚ÄúCoffee, if that‚Äôs ok.‚Äù

‚ÄúSure thing.‚Äù¬†He¬†left the room and came back with a small paper cup.¬†‚ÄúIt¬†ain‚Äôt Starbucks but it‚Äôll get the job done.¬†I¬†am so sorry for your loss. Any information that you have about Lilly that will help us solve this case is would be greatly appreciated.‚Äù

‚ÄúDo you know what happened to her?‚Äù¬†A tear fell from my eye.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs still under investigation.¬†We're working to resolve this for you and her family.‚Äù¬†He¬†lowered his head.¬†‚ÄúDo you remember the last time you saw her?‚Äù

I¬†racked my brain trying to remember when I last saw her.¬†‚ÄúIt¬†was three weeks ago.¬†We¬†were going to meet up and she never showed.¬†I¬†called her phone she never answered, I thought she was busy. ¬†I¬†should have checked in on her and have been a better friend.‚Äù¬†My chest tightened as tears clouded over my eyes.

‚ÄúCandace, none of this is your fault.‚Äù¬†His¬†tone calmed my frazzled nerves.¬†‚ÄúI¬†have a daughter and I‚Äôm terrified of what could happen to her. Ma‚Äôam I‚Äôm going to do everything I can to get this monster off the street, but you‚Äôve got to help me. Do she mention anyone following her? Any stalkers, or any jealous ex boyfriends?‚Äù

‚ÄúLily did mention her ex, his name was James Martin, I think.¬†They¬†had a major falling out and she stayed at my house for a few weeks, he had been harassing her online but I never thought it would come to this.‚Äù

‚ÄúDo you know his address? What kind of vehicle he drove? Anything you can remember.‚Äù

‚ÄúA Toyota Tacoma, black.¬†I¬†don‚Äôt remember a plate number‚Ä¶‚Äù¬†A flashback of the vision interuppted my thoughts, the black truck, the chains, the screaming.¬†‚Äú663YET, I think, I‚Äôm not a hundered percent sure on it.‚Äù¬†

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs ok, anything you can remember, you‚Äôre a great help. Do you want some water?¬†You¬†look a little bit peeked.‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôll take some more coffee if you have it.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre going to be up all night.‚Äù

His¬†warm nature made me smile in spite of myself as he refilled my cup of coffee and handed me a glazed donut, my stomach growled as I realized I forgot to eat since afternoon yesterday.

‚ÄúThank you, and it‚Äôs ok, I work night shift.‚Äù

‚ÄúUnderstood. do you remember anything else about James?‚Äù

‚ÄúHe‚Äôs a big guy, reddish brown hair.¬†He¬†had a beard the last time I saw him. Lily would stay at my place to avoid him.¬†He¬†used to work at Wells Fargo with us, before they had layoffs.‚Äù

‚ÄúWas he ever threatening towards you?‚Äù

‚ÄúNot to my face, he didn‚Äôt like her hanging out with me. That's really all I have right now‚Äù

‚ÄúOk. Are you ok to drive home?‚Äù¬†His¬†eyes had a fatherly concern.

‚ÄúI‚Äôll be ok, if it makes you feel better I can text you when I get home.‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôd hate to impose-‚Äù

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs no problem.‚Äù¬†Nodding, ¬†I gathered my purse and left the station.¬†I¬†went home scrolled on my phone to James's socials.¬†They¬†were full of the same misogynistic speeches, hunting pictures and the confederate flag. But the photo of his truck and plate were in plain view.

At sunset I placed the spirit board on the middle of my alter and lit a black and red candle. Holding the planchette in my hands, I called Lily's name.¬†It¬†trembled as hit floated to Hello.

‚ÄúLily, is this you?‚Äù¬†I¬†asked, my heart beating rapidly.

*YES*.

‚ÄúWas James the one that killed you?‚Äù

*YES.*

My rage surged.¬†‚ÄúWe¬†got him.¬†I¬†gave the police his plate number, he‚Äôs going to go away for a long time.‚Äù

¬†*N O T G O O D E N O U G H.*

*‚Äú*Not enough?¬†I‚Äôm doing all that I can, what more do you want?‚Äù

*D E A T H P A I N H E L L.*

*‚Äú*I¬†hope he gets the death penalty.¬†He¬†needs to suffer.‚Äù

The planchette jumped in my hands once again.

*Y O U C U R S E H I M*

I¬†was a practicing Witch, but I didn‚Äôt curse people, then again, I didn‚Äôt need to curse anyone up until now. The murder of my best friend seemed a justified reason enough to.

My kitchen started to shake and cabinet drawers opened and slammed shut. the air grew so cold I could see my breath in front of me. And at my feet there was my phone and a mason jar. Shaking I picked them both up.¬†I¬†wasn‚Äôt practiced in curses, but this was a place to start.¬†

Lighting some black candles and dragons blood incense, ¬†my bedroom was filled with a soft glow and the scent of resin, wax and roses.¬†I¬†wrote the name James Martin Will Suffer on a sticky note, then I crossed out the vowels and repeating letters. Taking the remaining letters I ¬†rearranged them into a cryptic glyf. Folding up the sigil, spat on it in the Mason jar and covered it with dirt before sealing the lid.

I¬†drove to a near by river. In the past I had volunteered and cleaned litter from its shores, I collected rocks from her banks.

‚ÄúRiver spirit, I need your help. Take this jar and run it‚Äôs namesake to the bottom. May your water fill his breath and may my sister have her vengeance, by the name of Hecate and Morrigan‚Äù¬† ¬†The river carried it before bashing it into a boulder, breaking the jar into sharp shards before whisking it downstream.¬†I¬†prayed that the bastard would meet his end.

¬†Lily would pound on my walls every night and move my furniture.¬†I¬†went back to the spirit board asking if there was anything she wanted but it was the same message every time.

The grief and lack of sleep were affecting my job, my boss told me to take some leave and provided me the number to a grief counselor. When I was younger I used to bury myself in work to avoid pain, but now it only left me exhausted.¬†I¬†felt brittle as though my whole world was breaking around me.¬†

I¬†would give my testimony and along with the evidence, James would be sentenced to death. My job was done, the curse was only an accelerant for the inevitable. Except the trial would never come.¬†I¬†went back to the police office and asked for Officer Thompson.

‚ÄúMs. Williams?‚Äù¬†said the detective.¬†‚ÄúAre you all right, you seem tired.‚Äù

‚ÄúI¬†am, have you heard anything from James Martin?‚Äù

Thompson looked back and fourth.¬†‚ÄúI¬†think you should come into my office, I‚Äôll get you some coffee.‚Äù

‚ÄúThank you,‚Äù¬†I said, as he lead me back to a small stuffy room shaded by blinds.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm technically not supposed to discuss this with civilians, but I know you were her friend. James volunteered his vehicle, the tire tracks don‚Äôt match and he has a fairly solid alibi.¬†He¬†was helping some family move some equipment.‚Äù

‚ÄúWith his truck.‚Äù

‚ÄúYes, his truck was out, that‚Äôs why we don‚Äôt have a lead. Did Lilly have anyone else? Like any one that was giving her the creeps, maybe on social media?‚Äù

‚ÄúNo. Her and James were constantly fighting, she never told me about anyone else.¬†I‚Äôm sorry. ‚Äú

‚ÄúMa‚Äôam, I promise you we‚Äôll do everything we can.¬†We‚Äôre talking to her family, we‚Äôll let you know if anything changes if you do the same.‚Äù

I¬†felt completely numb as I got into my car, as though I were on another plane of existence, slowly fading away. Rage welled up inside me. But not at the kindly old officer, he was just doing the best he could. James planned this out, and dragged an innocent woman to death where no one could hear her scream.¬†I¬†needed to find proof.

My phone vibrated with a text from an unregistered number. ¬†

:I¬†KNOW WHO YOU ARE. ¬†THEY¬†WON'T FIND YOUR BODY:

My heart froze in my chest as I looked for the number, but the message had disappeared. ¬†Fear burned into rage, the bastard wouldn't get away with this.

I¬†visited James's once for a New Years Eve party, before he forbade Lily from talking to me.¬†He¬†lived on a farm with his parents but in a separate house. ¬†I¬†parked my car in a field at the far end of his property and passed through a wooded area with a sharp ravine. Clambering down the steep path I crossed a wooden bridge over the river, the babble of the water over the stones calmed my jumpy nerves. Climbing up the steep slope I followed the path out of the woods. The estate loomed in the distance.¬†

Rather than taking the dirt road I walked through the pasture. A few sleepy cows walked passed me, unbothered by my presents. Reaching the estate, I ¬†made my way to the enormous garage. The door was locked tight.¬†

The wind blew heavily against the garage, so heavy I had to brace myself.¬†I¬†ducked behind the structure as James walked out the door. Cursing under his breath he opened the door to the garage. In the corner loomed a stack of tires lying next to a chain. The image of Lily being dragged down the dirt road flashed through my mind and her screams made my flesh break out in a cold sweat. ¬†A ringing cell phone broke the silence.

‚ÄúHello?‚Äù¬†said James over the phone.

James's face fell, his skin paled as he ran back into the house.¬†I¬†took out my phone and snapped a photo of the evidence just as James ¬†screamed as I took off running as fast as my legs would carry me. My lungs burned from the cold air as he was gained on me. My legs buckled under me as I made my way through the woods towards the ravine, the river churning beneath me. Turning around to face him, his eyes wide with surprise.

‚ÄúWhy are you trespassing on my property, Candy?‚Äù

The words caught in my throat, I was too scared to say anything as he inched towards me.

‚ÄúNow, you‚Äôre going to be a good girl and give me you‚Äôre phone.‚Äù

‚ÄúOr what? Why do you want my phone. If you have an alibi you have nothing to worry about.‚Äù

His¬†eyes went blank.¬†‚ÄúWhat I did to Lily will be nothing compared to what I‚Äôll do to you.‚Äù

*Death, pain, hell.*¬†The words flashed through my mind.¬†I¬†listened to the river beneath me. James lunged towards me but I caught him off balance.¬†He¬†fell sharply down the ravine, landing on a large rock in the river.¬†His¬†bones poking through his shattered leg as he screamed in pain.

‚ÄúHelp!‚Äù¬†

Smiling, ¬†I looked into his pleading eyes before pushing him into the current, not enough to sweep him away but enough to drag the broken limb.¬†His¬†screams were exquisite as buzzards began to circle overhead.

The drive home was peaceful, and I felt heavy and drowsy. ¬†For the last time I rested my hands on the planchette as it drifted towards goodbye.¬†

Clambering down the steep path I crossed a wooden bridge over the river, the babble of the water over the stones calmed my jumpy nerves. Climbing up the steep slope I followed the path out of the woods. The estate loomed in the distance.¬†

Rather than taking the dirt road I walked through the pasture. A few sleepy cows walked passed me, unbothered by my presents. Reaching the estate, I ¬†made my way to the enormous garage. The door was locked tight.¬†

The wind blew heavily against the garage, so heavy I had to brace myself.¬†I¬†ducked behind the structure as James walked out the door. Cursing under his breath he opened the door to the garage. In the corner loomed a stack of tires lying next to a chain. The image of Lily being dragged down the dirt road flashed through my mind and her screams made my flesh break out in a cold sweat. ¬†A ringing cell phone broke the silence.

‚ÄúHello?‚Äù¬†said James over the phone.

James's face fell, his skin paled as he ran back into the house.¬†I¬†took out my phone and snapped a photo of the evidence just as James ¬†screamed as I took off running as fast as my legs would carry me. My lungs burned from the cold air as he was gained on me. My legs buckled under me as I made my way through the woods towards the ravine, the river churning beneath me. Turning around to face him, his eyes wide with surprise.

‚ÄúWhy are you trespassing on my property, Candy?‚Äù

The words caught in my throat, I was too scared to say anything as he inched towards me.

‚ÄúNow, you‚Äôre going to be a good girl and give me you‚Äôre phone.‚Äù

‚ÄúOr what? Why do you want my phone. If you have an alibi you have nothing to worry about.‚Äù

His¬†eyes went blank.¬†‚ÄúWhat I did to Lily will be nothing compared to what I‚Äôll do to you.‚Äù

*Death, pain, hell.*¬†The words flashed through my mind.¬†I¬†listened to the river beneath me. James lunged towards me but I caught him off balance.¬†He¬†fell sharply down the ravine, landing on a large rock in the river.¬†His¬†bones poking through his shattered leg as he screamed in pain.

‚ÄúHelp!‚Äù¬†

Smiling, ¬†I looked into his pleading eyes before pushing him into the current, not enough to sweep him away but enough to drag the broken limb.¬†His¬†screams were exquisite as buzzards began to circle overhead.

The drive home was peaceful, and I felt heavy and drowsy. ¬†For the last time I rested my hands on the planchette as it drifted towards goodbye.¬†

1hf3709,https://www.reddit.com/r/emergencymedicine/comments/1hf3709/the_adventures_of_charlie_collar_ed_detective/,"The Adventures of Charlie Collar, ED Detective Noir/Chaplain","(This is a work of profoundly deranged fiction. Any character‚Äôs resemblance to any person, living or dead, is purely coincidental.)

Merry Christmas. Almost didn‚Äôt see you there. The name‚Äôs Charlie, Charlie Collar. You‚Äôll find me haunting your local emergency department, like an underpaid ghost of chart notes past. Within those walls I‚Äôm a one-of-a-kind operator. Corpses are signed out to my care. I exorcise office equipment on demand. My cases‚Äô ESI number is 0. If you‚Äôre faced with a loss or existential crisis that no amount of Ativan can fix, I‚Äôm your man. Of the cloth.

Walking in from beneath the moonless sky, my eyes struggled to adjust to the fluorescent bulbs that stood between me and the remote possibility of an early rapture. I found an open computer that worked at least some of the time and pulled up our census. But I scarcely had time to scroll before I could sense behind me‚Ä¶her. The manly hair on the back of my neck stood on end. And then I heard the unmistakable voice: ‚ÄúCollar.‚Äù

I spun around. ‚ÄúHow do, Deb?‚Äù

Of course it would be Deb charging tonight. I‚Äôm no shirking violet but if she ever decided to wrap her biceps around my neck, I‚Äôd be out before you could say ‚ÄúGeodon.‚Äù If the earth made mountains out of muscle and coffee grounds instead of rock, she‚Äôd be the tallest. What awe I don‚Äôt reserve for God is beheld for her. I was all ears.

‚ÄúCollar, room 13 is demanding a priest before we even touch them, room 666‚Äôs kids are demanding that we throw out their written DNR and make them a full code, and we‚Äôve got a field arrest arriving in five. What are you doing sitting down?‚Äù

‚ÄúThe lower I am to the floor, the less it will hurt when this place knocks me on my keister, Deb.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou‚Äôd better get cracking Charlie, or I‚Äôll do the honors myself.‚Äù

Threats of physical violence aside, I like Deb. She doesn‚Äôt abide BS or suffer fools. Good thing I‚Äôm not a fool. I got up.

There was no way without a time machine that I was unknotting room 666‚Äôs DNR dilemma before our arresting patient arrived, so I sauntered all hardboiled-like over to room 13. There Mr. Doe sat on the edge of the bed, one light off and the other on to make it look like they were standing under the most fluorescent streetlamp in existence. Their face was a hard-to-crack mask of determination, but beneath it I detected a flicker of fear. I had seen this face before, on the faces of my coworkers who were working on stacks of chart notes right before a downtime hit. It‚Äôs the look of knowing, deep down, you might be too late.

When I admitted to Mr. Doe that I am not in fact a priest, I got an earful. I suppose I could have lied to him, but then again that job is already taken by their insurance company and private equity.

Could Mr. Doe call his own priest? Apparently not. The PCP shortage is spiritual as well as medical. Besides, the attending, Dr. Erving, was chomping at the bit to get the workup started. Something to do with metrics and Press Ganey, I understand. I‚Äôd only worked a few shifts with him, so I didn‚Äôt know much about him. I do know he played college basketball and is one of the few people on the unit taller than me. I hear he has a mean slam dunk.

If I was going to avoid putting up an airball on this case, though, I needed answers from Mr. Doe, and fast. He wasn‚Äôt on death‚Äôs door so strictly speaking he didn‚Äôt need full last rites, and if I did give him last rites and he went right back to sinning, well, I‚Äôd be like a hamster on my little wheel. Just when I started wondering if Petsmart was hiring and needed chaplains, Mr. Doe piped back up.

Mr. Doe explained that the last time he was here, a priest had blessed him and his turkey sandwich, and the attending on duty then had caught a massive hiccupping attack before it took Mr. Doe to hospital heaven. He needed the ritual again before Dr. Erving laid eyes on him lest he taken out by an extreme burping attack this time. Ah, I realized, like a mysterious gambler playing the craps table of life, he just needed a rabbit‚Äôs foot.

I informed Mr. Doe that I could bless his turkey sandwich this time around, but I could also do him one better and fish our communion elements out from under the sink. Would Mr. Doe be interested in communion that smelled vaguely of cleaning solution, bug traps, and industrial strength regret? He would.

‚ÄúHe‚Äôs all yours, sawbones,‚Äù I said to Dr. Erving as I returned to Mr. Doe‚Äôs room with my sink-dwelling wafers and wine (or juice if you‚Äôre Baptist, reader). To me, crossing off my first case of the night, they shone like a fresh stack of emesis bags. But Mr. Doe would have to wait.

1hf35pd,https://v.redd.it/zvw74faz037e1,It's illegal in California to flush drugs down the toilet ,"In California, sober living homes or similar facilities cannot legally flush drugs down the toilet due to environmental regulations and proper drug disposal guidelines. Flushing drugs can contaminate water supplies and harm wildlife. Here‚Äôs what they are typically required to do:

1. Follow DEA Guidelines:

Drugs should be disposed of according to DEA (Drug Enforcement Administration) guidelines, which often recommend using authorized drug take-back programs or disposal kiosks.



2. Use Authorized Disposal Sites:

Many pharmacies, hospitals, and law enforcement agencies in California provide secure drug disposal bins.



3. Dispose of Drugs in Household Trash (if permitted):

If no take-back programs are available, drugs can be mixed with an undesirable substance (like used coffee grounds or cat litter), sealed in a plastic bag, and thrown away in the household trash. This is a less ideal method but better than flushing.



4. Special Cases for Controlled Substances:

For controlled substances, special procedures may apply. Facilities may need to document the disposal and comply with state and federal regulations.




Conclusion: A sober living home should not flush drugs but instead use a take-back program or consult local guidelines for safe disposal. Facilities in California are expected to comply with both environmental and legal standards to prevent harm to the community and environment.

**Previously:**

Sam Grayle and her boyfriend, Parker, were on their way back from a party. Sam went back to their friend's house to grab another one of their friends, but when she returned to where she left Parker, he was gone. She turned to the only superhero she knew - Victor Stone- to find him. They started to investigate and found the trail leading to the Church of Blood so Vic had Sam attend one of their meetings with Donna Morris there as back up. Coincidentally, Vic‚Äôs sister was also there but before they could ask her about it, a monster attacked, kidnapping many people, including Donna. Vic vowed that they‚Äôd get her back‚Ä¶

It took Sam, Nic and Vic around ten minutes for them to be able to meet back up and gather their thoughts. First they had to help the remainder of the people calm down, check for injuries and talk to the campus and city police who showed up. But while he probably wouldn‚Äôt admit it, Vic was happy just to have the time to calm down and think while doing his best to help others.

Finally, they managed to get back together and discuss where to go from here.

‚ÄúSo, I know we all want to just dive in there and help those people, but we need to understand what we‚Äôre dealing with first.‚Äù Vic said.

‚ÄúNone of this makes sense. Why would the creature come here? If it just wanted people, there are any number of places it could go that are more crowded. So that leads me to think that it wanted someone specific.‚Äù

‚ÄúBut why? None of us are all that important,‚Äù Nic said.

‚ÄúWho knows why people do what they do. But if we think someone sent that monster here to kidnap someone, there‚Äôs only one group of people who knew who all was coming: The Church of Blood,‚Äù Sam said.

Vic frowned. Sam wasn‚Äôt wrong, but something about it didn‚Äôt feel right. His gut was telling him that he was missing something, but what? 

‚ÄúOkay, but they lost a lot of people too. Maybe that‚Äôs a misdirection, but the reactions really felt genuine. If they‚Äôre acting, some of them probably should change their degrees to theater because it seemed real,‚Äù Nic commented.

‚ÄúIf these people are controlling some sort of giant monster, the least they could do is have genuine reactions about it.‚Äù

‚ÄúMaybe. But most of them have left or are talking to the police now. I don‚Äôt think we can really get anywhere following them‚Ä¶ But the monster‚Ä¶ What was that thing? Nic, you saw it the best‚Ä¶ what do you think?‚Äù

She shuddered slightly. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not sure. It was like a person, but made of a hard but malleable grey material. Sorta looked like stone but parts glowed like it was red hot and crackled with electricity. It was flexible and strong. Best guess? Some sort of robot or artificial being or something like that.‚Äù

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs what I thought too. You saw it better than me, but I feel like it was like a servant. It had a task it was made for, it did it and left,‚Äù Sam said. 

Sam looked like she had more she wanted to say, but stopped herself, instead, she walked over to the window and looked out at the street. 

‚ÄúWhere do you think it went? Not really anywhere for a multi-story monster to go around here without drawing the entire city‚Äôs worth of attention.‚Äù

No one had an answer to that but Nic and Vic joined Sam by the window, looking for anything out of the ordinary. 

After a few moments, Vic spoke up. ‚ÄúYou said the thing changed size right? So what if it could shrink down?‚Äù

Nic‚Äôs eyes lit up with realization. ‚ÄúIf it could do that, then there‚Äôs tons of places it could‚Äôve gone. But it still would have to be about the size of a person to keep everyone trapped‚Ä¶‚Äù 

She snapped her fingers. ‚ÄúThe steam tunnels! They run all over campus. The monster could‚Äôve snuck through there and gone anywhere it wants.‚Äù

Vic raised an eyebrow. ‚ÄúWhy do you know about those?‚Äù

‚ÄúDon‚Äôt worry about it. Anyway, pretty sure there‚Äôs an entrance not too far from here, let‚Äôs go see if there‚Äôs any sign of it around there!‚Äù

‚ÄúYou can do that if you want. But I‚Äôve got another idea so we might as well split up.‚Äù

Sam looked at Vic expectantly. ‚ÄúCare to share?‚Äù

‚ÄúNo. I think it‚Äôs better to keep our thoughts in parallel for now. Then we can come up with our own conclusions and compare instead of maybe being led on a false path.‚Äù

‚ÄúI guess that makes sense. Then what do you want me to do?‚Äù

‚ÄúHonestly? Just stay here, or better yet, go find some friends in a  wide open public place and hang out with them while we figure this out. I just want you to stay safe while we figure this out.‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôve already said I can handle myself, Vic. Besides, your sister is going to be chasing a monster through steam tunnels. You‚Äôre not worried about that at all?‚Äù

Vic hesitated, trying to come up with something without giving away Nic‚Äôs powers.

‚ÄúI‚Äôve been around and heard about enough of Vic‚Äôs missions to know a thing or two. I‚Äôll be fine. But you? You‚Äôre just a civilian without any experience.‚Äù

Sam sighed. For the first time in awhile, Vic could see just how tired she was. The bags under her eyes had seemed to grow even larger than the deep, obsidian lines that were there when they had met.

‚ÄúFine. Just come back safe, okay?‚Äù

‚ÄúWe will.‚Äù

Nic shot Vic a glare that clearly meant she wanted some details later and he wasn‚Äôt going to disagree. But now wasn‚Äôt the time for that and both of them knew it.

‚ÄúOkay, you two get your stuff figured out, I need to get headed down there before the thing gets further away.‚Äù

‚ÄúGood luck and stay safe.‚Äù

‚ÄúI will.‚Äù 

Nic walked out the door and out of the building into the cold night air. By now, everyone else who was at the meeting had dispersed and campus life had moved on. Her classmates walked all around her without any idea of what had just happened around them.  She envied them for that. Their ignorance might not be bliss, but it‚Äôs nice to know there are other people out there solving problems that you never have to deal with. But when you‚Äôre a superhero‚Ä¶ you‚Äôre the other people.

She got to the nearest entrance to the steam tunnels, a ten foot tall concrete cylinder with about a four foot diameter. Students used them to put up posters for events and meetings and pretty much all of them had no idea what it was really for, except for the bored or inquisitive students who looked down at them from the upstairs of the buildings and saw the metal grate on top.

A pile of  ripped posters lay on the ground, no longer covering up the concrete pillar. If someone was taking the posters down, they‚Äôd have done something with the old ones, or at least taken them off the entire pillar. But only about 20% of the pillar was exposed.

She got closer and then, hoping no one was around to see her, jumped upwards and shaped shifted her arms to be slightly longer so she could reach the top and pull herself over.

As she expected, the grate was gone. The monster must‚Äôve ripped the posters down as it climbed into the tunnels. She looked down in the tunnel, wishing she brought a flashlight. She couldn‚Äôt reach it anyway, but she wasn‚Äôt about to throw her phone down there to have some light. 

*‚ÄòWell‚Ä¶ it can‚Äôt be too much more than say‚Ä¶ 15 feet down? I can balance myself on the sides long enough to do that‚Ä¶ probably...‚Äô*

Taking a deep breath, she pulled herself over the top and started to fall down. She held out her arms and legs, trying to slow her fall. Her gloved hands gripped the edges just enough to stop her from hitting the ground at full speed, but still fast enough to hit the metal catwalk with a loud thud.

Brushing herself off, she pulled out her phone and turned on the flashlight. The tunnels were surprisingly high, around seven feet tall, but the pipes running along the sides and top made it hard for her to move around comfortably. As far as she could tell, the tunnels could go on forever and there was no sign of the monster at all. 

She was just about to guess a direction, then she heard it.

‚ÄúHelp! Anyone pl-‚Äù

Someone was crying for help further to the right before they were cut off. She ran the best she could down the tunnel and she came to a dead end. Not many pipes came to this part of the tunnel and the few that did curved around on each other a few feet before the end, making the last bit simply an empty concrete tube. She tapped at it, trying to find a hollow point, and sure enough, at the end of the tunnel, there was some sort of path. 

She set her phone down then pushed at the wall hard, as if trying to knock it down, and the wall gave way, leading deeper underground. She could see a glimmer of fluorescent light up ahead and so she put her phone away as she continued on through the concrete path.

After a few moments, she found herself in a brightly lit prison. It was a perfect cube and all along the ground floor were prison cells, mostly empty but some filled with students. The top floor was a wrap-around catwalk with a small room with a glass window that looked down over something in the center of the room. Nic wasn‚Äôt really sure what it was looking at, but a small section in the middle of the room, maybe 100 square feet, was made out of a darker tile instead of the plain white that the rest was paved in.

‚ÄúNic?‚Äù A familiar voice called out to her from one of the cells just adjacent to the entryway.

‚ÄúDonna?‚Äù

Nic ran over to her cell. Donna sat on the floor against the wall but stood up once she saw Nic. She looked dirty and a little scuffed up, but more or less unharmed. The four other people in the small cell perked up upon seeing her too but cautiously kept their distance from the bars.

‚ÄúHow‚Äôd you find us?‚Äù

‚ÄúWe figured out that the monster must‚Äôve taken you all into the steam tunnels and then I kinda just got lucky. How are you all holding up?‚Äù

‚ÄúHonestly, things are more or less fine. We‚Äôd rather not be here of course, but beyond the anxiety of what might happen, nothing‚Äôs happened to us. We‚Äôve just been sitting here.‚Äù

Nic shrugged. ‚ÄúI guess that‚Äôs good at least. Let me see if I can find a way to get you out‚Ä¶‚Äù

Nic looked around the room; she figured that the controls would be up in that room on the second floor, but wasn‚Äôt sure how to get there. There must be some sort of elevator but there wasn‚Äôt any control station for it on this level. She frowned, she knew she had to be missing something but before she could really focus on it, a whirring, grinding noise started to come from the middle of the room.

The floor started to slowly sink down deep into the earth and Nic walked over cautiously to investigate. It sank down 10, 15, 20 feet until it finally stopped. She shined her phone‚Äôs light into the pit and quickly recoiled back. It was the monster.

As the elevator started to bring it back up, she looked around in a panic. She wasn‚Äôt sure she could take it down anyway, but with all these people around here she couldn‚Äôt risk using her powers and potentially exposing her secret identity. She silently swore; she really should have come in costume instead of rushing in as a civilian.

The elevator was almost here and she was no closer to coming up with a plan. Looks like it was time for improv. 

The creature was here. But it was much smaller than the multi-story, gargantuan being that they saw before. No, it was not that much bigger than your average linebacker. Big, muscular and dense, but less than a quarter of the size it was before.

She put her fists up into a guarding position and stood on the balls of her feet. The nerves left her in an instant. This one was beatable. 

Whether it was the better lighting or the smaller size, Nic couldn‚Äôt say, but the monster felt more human than it did before. Its thick grey, stone-like skin interwoven with red glowing circuits wouldn‚Äôt fool anyone into thinking it was human, but the look in its robotic eyes and the ‚Äúgrin‚Äù on its face seemed like it was excited for a fight too.

The creature made the first move. Every step made the floor rumble, like a massive hammer beating down. Nic started to circle and dance around it, looking for some sort for an opening. Then, like an avalanche, the monster accelerated and launched a barrage of punches at her, each like a 
sledgehammer. But Nic was faster, easily weaving and bobbing around the monster‚Äôs blows.

She didn‚Äôt dare strike back against it since it was taking everything she had to avoid taking a single blow. She wasn‚Äôt sure if she could take one and keep moving. She kept dancing around its strike and kicks even as her lungs started to burn. But she noticed something interesting as she narrowly dodged a punch: the monster was shrinking. It used to tower well over a foot and a half over her but now it was only a couple of inches from eye level. Its proportions were becoming weirder as it grew smaller. It only lost height in its legs and torso, but the squat head and arms stayed about the same size, its hands almost touching the ground. 

She weaved under another strike, then pushed towards the creature's chest and kicked where its gut would be. She dashed backwards to try and create some distance, but was too slow and took one of the massive fists to her chest, sending her flying into one of the cell bars and knocking the wind out of her.
She leaned over, panting, trying to keep moving. But she hasn‚Äôt noticed just how exhausted the fight was making her. Too tired. She was a little out of practice, sure, but not that much. Something was off. No longer as focused on the fight, she smelled the air for the first time. It smelled off, like rubbing alcohol or a room full of markers. Some sort of gas was being pumped into the room. 

She wanted to look for the pipes or vents it was coming from but the creature was back on top of her and she needed to be ready for it. She was dazed and disoriented but still kept her guard up and weaved sloppily around the first strike. It wasn‚Äôt that much bigger than her at this point. If she could just hold out for a couple of more seconds, she‚Äôd have the size advantage. 

But she was slower now and the creature knew it. It feigned with a right jab, predicting Nic would dodge to the left of its fist and responded with a left hook that hit her again square in the gut. It didn‚Äôt hit as hard as the first, but she wasn‚Äôt as strong either. She fell to the floor, willing herself to get back up. Her body screamed at her to stay down but still she rose to her feet, dazed and disoriented, focused only on the beast in front of her.

It was running at her, gunning for the kill. Glee seemed to course through its face, its red lights blinking and coursing through it, taunting her. She needed to take this thing down now or that would be it for her. She stood her ground to the last second and lunged out of its warpath, the monster‚Äôs momentum carrying it through and sending it crashing into the cell bar behind her. 

The bars bent with the impact and Nic prayed that it‚Äôd stay down. But it got back up and began to walk over to her. Nic wanted to respond, to keep fighting, but her body refused. Her mind screamed for her legs to move just one last time, but they would not. The creature continued its advance until it was almost on top of her.

Then, it stopped.

The creature stood perfectly still, like a statue, the red lighting gone. Nic collapsed to the ground in a huge sigh of relief. Looking up, she saw a familiar face up on the catwalk, looking down at her with pride and concern.

‚ÄúHi Nic. Hope I‚Äôm not too late,‚Äù Victor Stone said.

Thirty minutes earlier‚Ä¶

Vic walked out of the classroom where he left Sam and walked down the hall for a few steps  before immediately turning back around and heading to the classroom across the hall. He sat there and waited watching, the door to the room Sam was still in. He was watching her carefully, making sure that she wouldn‚Äôt slip out without him noticing.

A few minutes later, she stepped out of the room. Vic waited a few moments for her to get ahead, then began to follow her. She took the stairs down to the ground level and left the building.  He stayed a little bit behind her making sure that she wouldn‚Äôt see him.
 
She swiped her student id at the biology building and continued to the stairwell, where she went down into the basement. She stopped at an old white, wooden door. A sign on the door urged people to not enter due to every hazard under the sun: radiation, toxic substances, high temperatures‚Ä¶ the list went on and on. But the door wasn‚Äôt even looked and Sam walked right in. 

Vic waited another few moments and followed her in again. He was in an old lab that looked like it hadn‚Äôt been touched since the building was built 80 years ago or whenever it was, but he didn‚Äôt need to take long to see where Sam went. A  bookshelf was sliding back to its original position, about to hide the passageway behind it on the far side of the lab. He sprinted over, just barely squeezing through before it slammed shut.

He found himself in a small office space, looking down over a white tiled room, just behind Sam who was fiddling with some buttons on a large panel below her. She turned around to face him, her face a fix of surprise and exhaustion.

‚ÄúWhy? What gave it away?‚Äù

Vic was surprised by her suddenness but kept his composure. ‚ÄúThere wasn‚Äôt any one thing. But if I had to pick something, it was your continued instance that something was up with the Church of Blood, that they had to be involved. It was like you were goading me. Don‚Äôt get me wrong, they have their issues. But I‚Äôm pretty familiar with them and this wasn‚Äôt them. So, I started thinking about who else was involved and started to piece it together. But‚Ä¶ why? Why do this?‚Äù

Sam nodded. ‚ÄúI wanted to create new life. And I did! It‚Äôs made up of living data-binary organisms married to biological tissue. I call it... Malware! A little on the nose, but I can‚Äôt deny the results. The only problem was it needed a constant source of biological matter. Nothing crazy, just a pint or two of blood to stay stable and stop it from collapsing as it expended energy. The problem was that it no longer would react to my blood, iIt needed new material to grow. And so for science‚Ä¶ I had it kidnap my boyfriend, and then all those people. And look what it could do! That was with maybe fifteen samples. Who knows what it could grow into with a 1000? It could even take out Superman!‚Äù

‚ÄúBut why? Superman‚Äôs great.‚Äù

She shook her head. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not about *him*, but what he could be. What if someday, the Justice League isn‚Äôt able to take something down? But an army of Malware? Maybe that could buy you all the time to save the day.‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Ä¶ I can‚Äôt disagree with that exactly, but you can‚Äôt just kidnap people.‚Äù

She shrugged. ‚ÄúClearly I can. They aren‚Äôt harmed at all. Just a quick blood draw and then they go home. Parker‚Äôs just been down here with me helping out and doing his work remotely.‚Äù

He sighed. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think we‚Äôre going to agree on this. Just one last question. Why bring me on the case? If you just didn‚Äôt tell me about it, who knows how long until I would‚Äôve heard about it.‚Äù

‚ÄúBut you would have. I thought if I brought you on the case, maybe I could manipulate the facts. Slow you down until Malware got strong enough to take you down.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou know I don‚Äôt have my powers anymore, right? Look at me, I‚Äôm clearly just a guy, not a cyborg.‚Äù
She blinked twice. ‚ÄúI‚Ä¶ oh. I thought you just found a way to hide them.‚Äù

He laughed. ‚ÄúNo. I wouldn‚Äôt even if I could but - ‚Äù

A crash echoed through the room.

‚ÄúWhat was that?‚Äù

‚ÄúOh, right. Malware is fighting your sister. She made it down here and I sent him after her to stop her. But she was doing too well, so I started to fill the room with sleeping gas.‚Äù

Horror washed over his face. ‚ÄúTurn it off!‚Äù

‚ÄúFine. Waste of data though. It‚Äôd never seriously injure her.‚Äù

She flipped a switch and pressed a red button on the control panel.

‚ÄúHappy now?‚Äù

Vic ignored her and ran out to check on his sister. 

‚ÄúHi Nic. Hope I‚Äôm not too late,‚Äù Vic said.

‚ÄúNah, right on time,‚Äù she groaned. ‚ÄúI had‚Ä¶ another couple rounds in me, easy.‚Äù

Vic was about to disagree, but she passed out on the floor, asleep.

He turned back to Sam who was sitting in the chair, going over her reports as if Vic wasn‚Äôt even there.
‚ÄúUh‚Ä¶ you know I‚Äôm going to have to bring you in, right? Whether you can justify it to yourself or not, you did do a crime here and you‚Äôve got to pay for it.‚Äù

Sam turned to face Vic, but didn‚Äôt even look up from the paper. ‚ÄúIf you say so.‚Äù

‚ÄúListen, you clearly have some‚Ä¶ morality issues you need to work out. But your heart is in the right place. I‚Äôm sure you‚Äôll have some jail time, but after I know some people who‚Äôd love to have your talents.‚Äù

‚ÄúWell then, let‚Äôs get going.‚Äù 

She pressed a big button on the right side and all the cells opened up.

‚ÄúThe sooner I go to jail the sooner I can get back to my work.‚Äù

‚öôÔ∏è‚öôÔ∏è‚öôÔ∏è‚öôÔ∏è‚öôÔ∏è

‚ÄúOkay, hold on there‚Äôs no way she said that,‚Äù Nic said.

‚ÄúI promise you, she did,‚Äù Vic said.

The two of them were sitting in a back corner of one of their favorite coffee shops. The room was dark and cozy and they sat in two giant arm chairs with a small table between them. Vic took a sip from his coffee.

‚ÄúSo she just‚Ä¶ gave up and surrendered? No fight, no complaints? No second evil monster?‚Äù

‚ÄúNope. Maybe some part of her knew what she did was wrong and wanted to atone.‚Äù

‚ÄúOr maybe she really did just want to get back to work and knew that was the quickest path to do it,‚Äù she said, taking a drink.

‚ÄúGuess we can ask her eventually. I‚Äôm guessing she‚Äôll be out under some sort of work release for someone soon enough.‚Äù

‚ÄúI guess if she‚Äôs able to work for good, that‚Äôs fine.‚Äù

Vic nodded. It was good to just have a quiet moment every now and then and he was going to savor it as long as he could.

Anyway we got our order and it tasted... off. Not bad but not what it should have tasted like. It was close to close too and I was going to go back but by the time we got done done some more shopping (for Xmas and ourselves too) they had closed. Cut to me calling them today to see if I could get them remade. I politely asked the worker that picked up if we could get that done. She said lemme get my manager. 

Manager comes on the line and I explain again what happened. She goes do you have any kind of proof? I said no I paid in cash thru dt. She goes ok we can do it this time but I've had a lot of remakes this week and it's not cool it has to keep happening. Next time ask for a receipt if you pay in cash

I never got a receipt. Never thought to get it as my tickets and drinks both appeared ok when I got them. I also used to work at Wendy's and I know dt time is a real thing and didn't wanna taste it before leaving to ensure it was ok - that and I had stuff to do. 

I'm flabbergasted. All I wanted was a remake. I get it people have bad days but my god I was under the impression it's a remake if it isn't how we like it or am I wrong here - at least that's what I've heard before. 

I'm at a loss now. I feel like not even going back or at the very least having someone else get my Starbs for me h til after the holiday season is over. If this is how I get treated idk if I can go back to this one for some time now",0,1734298516.0,starbucks,10,0.22,False

I taught him about eight years ago and he's probably around 25 or 26 now.  Despite being Facebook friends, we haven't had contact since graduation. 

He's recently posted a few alarming posts that have me concerned for his mental health. These posts border on the paranoid, alluding to people out to get him, everyone ganging up on him, etc. He's also posted recently about famous people who have committed suicide and other references to US suicide statistics, etc.  A couple people have commented on these posts, checking in and asking if he needed someone to talk to. 

I don't know that I feel comfortable reaching out to him personally.  It seems like this is more than just someone going through a rough patch.  I'm worried that if we met up for coffee or something, I'd be in way over my head.  It seems like he needs to talk to a qualified therapist or psychiatrist. 

I looked back on my emails and I have his mother's email address from years ago on my school account.  Would I be out of line sending her an email from my personal account expressing my concern?  Is this best left to his friends and peers to handle?  A part of me thinks this is none of my business, and that I would be out of line interfering with a fully grown adult.

Note that I had my passport in my travel purse as of 3 days prior so it either fell out or I was pickpocketed. 

It was a Saturday and based on reading here I looked online for an appointment at the Hudson location here in NCY. There were no appointment so I called due to my flight leaving the next day. The first person was unable to find an appointment, and escalated my call to another department. They were able to get an appointment for me at 7:30 Monday morning, they day after my original flight. I then printed my original flight, cancelled the Sunday flight and rebooked for Monday around 1pm. My best hope was getting in the door at 7:30 and having my passport by 11 to get to JFK in time. 

Meanwhile, at my request my family flew out on the original flight Sunday morning and took my suitcase so I could book it through the airport with just a backpack.

Monday morning I arrived at the passport office at 6:45am, I was the third person in line. By the time it opened at 7:30 there were probably 30+ people in line so getting there early made all the difference. Once in, the agent scanned all of my info, scolded me for losing my passport and had me out the door by 7:45 to begin the wait.

There's a coffee shop across the street that has good coffee and excellent baked goods so other folks waiting for passports posted up there. One by one, they all got their texts that their passports were ready. Nothing for me, so at 11 I went over to wait since I was cutting it close to make the flight. Agents in the small waiting room that distribute the finalized passports were providing people with where they were in the process, but no one could tell me anything other than to try to wait a few more minutes. When I walked up for the last time before preparing to cancel my 1pm flight, someone from the back room popped out and said WE HAVE IT! I screamed and started crying, apparently the agent knew it was on the last piece of processing but didn't want to give me false hope.

All the people in the waiting room cheered, and a couple trying to go on their honeymoon got theirs right before mine and raced off. I hopped into a very expensive uber (yes I looked at the heli option but missed it by 15 mins) and arrived at the gate 8 minutes before the doors closed.

I'm in a bit of a dilemma about what car to buy. I have almost always owned a second fun ""weekend"" car (miatas, 86's, E46, etc), but for the last couple of years I've just had a boring daily driver. After saving a lot of money the last few years, I'm wanting to treat myself to a nice weekend car, ideally less than $40k. The car will mainly be used as a Sunday cruiser to coffee shops and whatnot, so I'd love for it to feel like ""an event"" to drive. The problem is that I'm expecting to have a kid within the next year or two. I‚Äôm looking for something that's fun to drive with a manual transmission, but ideally something with somewhat usable back seats. I'm also open to getting something with two seats, and just living with the fact that I'll only get to it enjoy it solo, but I feel like that isn't ideal. Here‚Äôs what I‚Äôm considering, along with some pros and cons for each:

# 1. 2014+ Corvette

* **Pros:**
   * Amazing performance (engine, handling, etc.)
   * Love the looks and sound
   * Great storage space for a sports car
* **Cons:**
   * This is what I would buy if it wasn't for the kid, but with no back seats I‚Äôm basically stuck with it being a solo car once the kid arrives. Not sure if this is a deal breaker or not. Curious to hear from other parents with a two seater on how often it gets driven and if it's isolating to own.

# 2. Ford Mustang GT

* **Pros:**
   * V8
   * Can fit a kid in the backseat in a pinch
   * Never owned a muscle car before, so it could be fun to try
* **Cons:**
   * Not sure I‚Äôm a muscle car guy
   * I typically value handling and driving dynamics over straight line speed (camaro fits better here, but not sure I can get pass the visibility/looks).
   * Not very ""special"" (maybe with some mods though?)

# 3. Honda Civic Type R

* **Pros:**
   * First ""fun"" car was an old Si that I loved, has some nostalgia factor
   * Should hold its value pretty well
   * Back seats seem very usable
* **Cons:**
   * Doesn‚Äôt feel like an ‚Äúevent‚Äù to drive unless you‚Äôre really pushing it, not sure it makes a great weekend/special occasion car. Almost too practical?
   * A lot of money for a civic

# 4. Hyundai Veloster N

* **Pros:**
   * Great fun-to-money ratio
   * Usable back seats
   * Can have fun on the streets without breaking the law
* **Cons:**
   * It‚Äôs a Hyundai, I've owned some (2018+) and the build quality sucked, left kind of a bad taste in my mouth
   * Similar to the CTR, seems almost too practical/tame for a weekend car

# 5. Porsche Macan S

* **Pros:**
   * Curveball option, sell my daily (Lexus RX) for something like this
   * Porsche driving experience, solid build quality
   * One car solution
* **Cons:**
   * Not sure it would scratch the sports car itch
   * No manual transmission option, which is a big part of the fun for me

# What I‚Äôm Looking For:

* **Fun to drive:** I want something that makes me excited to get in the car and take it for a cruise.
* **Manual transmission:** Relatively set on this, but could go for DCT.
* **Backseats:** I don‚Äôt need a family SUV or a sedan, but something that can at least work for occasional trips with a kid in the back.

What would you all do in this situation? Is there something else I should consider? Or do you have any advice on balancing performance and practicality when you‚Äôre about to become a parent? I'm sort of leaning towards the Mustang. Other cars I'm not really interested in are Golf R, GR86, GR Corolla, BMWs (hate the transmissions), Convertibles (miata, boxster, etc).

The coffee mugs are the 'everything' cups around here, so they get used ever 5 minutes. 

This also means they get broken when the RV moves regularly-- because someone forgets to put at least one of them away wrapped in packing paper, because who wants to do that every 5 minutes-- unwrap it, close the under-the-bed storage, go rinse it, use it, then wash+dry it and reverse the whole process. 

Other regularly shaped glasses, sure, we can just have foam holders in the cabinets and that works well enough. (And foam is cheap.)

any places to totally avoid besides the obvious?

Here in this post I'm simply removing KV from the equation. Let's just assume the man never came to the show. Now I will address why is Vivian being called spineless? 

When the first episode aired, majority of the audiences including myself and the housemates knew of Vivian more than ANY of the other contestants. He had an upper hand in terms of stature and popularity. He came in with a bit of an arrogance and superiority complex as well, which sometimes is loosely translated to Swag. 

Moving on, 

-When Avinash was put in jail while he was creating a havoc in the house for whatever reasons the man went and joined hands with Avinash and managed a meagre daily ration for the other housemates and proudly labelled himself as the problem-solver -  while he himself is eating Paranthas and enjoying his privileges because now he is Avinash's friend. Because as per Vivian Avinash was ‚Äúright‚Äù in the whole debacle. 
THE AUDIENCES WOULD'VE APPLAUDED A AVINASH vs. VIVIAN angle. He had the opportunity to show him his place. He didn't do anything. Swag - arrogance sab gayab..


-The same guy goes heads on with Chahat again for no real apparent reason. Maybe, because people thought she was irritating initially but now he wants to play that track until the 10th week. Reason ? Vague. We don't know. Don't expect a lot from Chahat but expect a real mudda for this animosity from a mature, calm, and wise personality like Vivian. But at least now I know that the man can fight and speak loudly and stand up for himself when it comes to Chahat stealing his coffee. 


-This same guy has no real relationship with Shilpa but plays along a narrative and tries to milks it's perks. Smart you might think, but a weak contestant like Shilpa took more advantage of the narrative and got saved by Vivian himself from nominations everytime a power came in his hands. Who's smarter? The calm, matured, and wise Vivian or Shilpa? 


-Everytime Rajat goes wild and does bal ka prayog this same person who supported Avinash because he was ‚Äúright‚Äù hides in a corner. Rajat keeps breaking the biggest rule of the house and Vivian has never really called it out EVEN ONCE. But will attack Chahat and Shrutika with his verbal diarrhoea WHENEVER he has the chance. I haven't seen Colors ka Laadla go man-on-man with Rajat and simply tell him that Boss, this is my home ground and I won't see you get physical with anyone. My own friends is out of chance but even my enemies. Use your damn mouth. Where does the Laadla arrogance fizzle out when it is really required? 


-Coming to Avinash and their brotherhood, he has forced this angle because he never had the guts to go against him. This was well-established after Avinash nominated him. The makers Salman, and even fellow contestants have pointed out in multiple ways to react or atleast confront. But what Vivian does is he meekly takes it upon himself and justifies this move. HE DOESNT EVEN QUESTION HIM ONCE. He literally thought it was better to say that I was missing my family and that's why I wasn't playing rather than saying that I don't need a friend who nominates me and that too so early in the damn game when it wasn't even required to do so. Forget Shilpa, he's being played by his own Chhote Miyaan. 


I didn't know much about Avinash, Eisha, Rajat, Chum, Tajineder, Sara etc.  before this show but I've known Vivian. When you see a personality of his stature you expect more class, maturity, and humility. The problem is that people don't expect much out of the others because they don't know them enough.  Vivian on the other hand is a successful and a bigger celebrity - so it is natural for people to expect a superior level of game from him. He is failing to deliver exactly that. They are calling him spineless because he doesn't have the courage to go against Avinash or Rajat. His biggest competitors.  

At this moment Vivian is simply thinking I will play the game, good or bad riding on Avinash's shoulders and once it boils down to top 2 or 3, I will win the show hands down owing to my fan base against Rajat and Avinash. But to us, outside the math is not adding up. Even Yamini, Edin, and Kashish aren't looking so delusional.

Coming back from the second visit to Thailand this year and i‚Äôm yet again bitten even harder by the bug.

My first visit was for 10 Days split between Phuket & Bangkok - It was great but as always the first time visiting you want to speed run through all the exciting places the country has to offer and you don‚Äôt get that time to simply take it in.

For some reason i got a feedback before the first visit that Bangkok is just too overwhelming and that my best bet is to only visit the city for two days and spend the rest of my time in Phuket.

Well here i am just coming back from a week long trip that was simply perfect, the city‚Äôs morning life where the weather is just perfect with a slight cold breeze, elders setting up their little street food carts, the whizzing sound of motorbikes just makes the whole metropolitan morning experience amazing !

At night the neon signs light up the streets where night markets are open wide with food selections your mind wouldn‚Äôt even think of, world class malls get filled with shoppers from all around the world and even though nightlife isn‚Äôt for all but experiencing it in Bangkok just to witness it was something to remember.

Coffee ! Never realized how great the coffee scene is there and man each cup was better than the other

Bangkok is one of the most incredible cities in the world and on this second visit i realized that it‚Äôs just so huge to experience it all in one visit, it is so vast and diverse yet close and warm, serene yet very loud and hectic - that contrast is tough to find and Bangkok in a systematically chaotic way did it just right.

I‚Äôm intrigued to know why you like Bangkok and why do you think it gets this negative feedback at times because i just can‚Äôt wait for the next visit !",6,1734298059.0,ThailandTourism,2,0.88,False

Good morning, fellow XRP watchers and hopeless coffee addicts! Let‚Äôs dive deep into the groundbreaking analysis of XRP‚Äôs daily chart. Spoiler: You might want to sit down for my 100% guaranteed prediction at the end.

The 4-hour chart is tighter than my jeans after the holidays. XRP is chilling in the neutral zone‚Äîtoo lazy to go up, too tired to fall down. It‚Äôs like that awkward guy at a party who‚Äôs just standing by the snack table, not quite sure what to do next.

On the daily chart, XRP is oversold. Way oversold. Like, ‚Äúcouldn‚Äôt pay its rent‚Äù oversold. Usually, that‚Äôs when the bulls start waking up, rub their eyes, and push the price up‚Äîusually. Or maybe they‚Äôll just hit snooze again.

The MACD is ‚Äúrounding the bottom‚Äù like a perfectly poured cappuccino. The red bars are fading, which means the reversal could be cooking. Slowly. Like a frozen pizza you forgot in the oven at 200¬∞.

Now let‚Äôs talk about the Stochastic RSI. It‚Äôs practically lying face-down at rock bottom. Imagine someone so exhausted they‚Äôre just crawling across the gym floor saying, ‚ÄúI‚Äôll move up soon, I swear.‚Äù The indicators want XRP to move, but they‚Äôre not in a rush.

Volume is light right now, but big volume could be incoming any moment. When the whales decide to jump in, we‚Äôll know because they never leave quietly. It‚Äôll be more like, ‚ÄúHey, you awake? BOOM. We‚Äôre moving.‚Äù

Now, for my 100% GUARANTEED PREDICTION‚Äîthis is the one you‚Äôve been waiting for:

XRP will go up, down, or sideways. That‚Äôs right. I said it. It‚Äôs the kind of insight you only get here.

To sum it up, XRP‚Äôs next move is as clear as mud. The indicators look ready, the market looks sleepy, and I look like someone who hasn‚Äôt left the charts in days. Remember: sideways is still a direction, and ‚Äúsoon‚Äù is the favorite word in crypto.

The first step to successful teeth whitening is to understand your options. Various methods can be employed, and each offers unique advantages. Here are some popular approaches:

- **Professional Whitening Treatments:** Dentists often provide in-office treatments that deliver superior results. These procedures use stronger whitening agents and are supervised by professionals to ensure safety.
- **At-Home Whitening Kits:** Many dentists offer take-home kits equipped with custom trays and professional-grade whitening gel. This method allows for gradual whitening over a few weeks and can be very effective.
- **Over-the-Counter Products:** Whitening strips, gels, and toothpaste available at drugstores are convenient and generally less expensive. They may not produce results as quickly as professional options, but they can still lighten your teeth significantly.
- **Natural Remedies:** Some individuals opt for natural methods such as baking soda, hydrogen peroxide, or activated charcoal. While these may yield mild whitening effects, results can be inconsistent. Always test these remedies cautiously to avoid damaging your enamel.

Once you've determined which whitening method suits you best, preparation plays a key role in achieving the best results. Consider the following tips:

- **Avoid Stain-Causing Foods:** Limit consumption of coffee, tea, red wine, and tobacco products, as these can contribute to staining. If you enjoy these beverages, rinse your mouth with water afterward to reduce potential staining.
- **Stay Hydrated:** Drinking water throughout the day helps wash away food particles and bacteria, reducing the risk of stains.

Preparation doesn‚Äôt stop at choosing the right method and maintaining a good oral hygiene routine. How you use the whitening products can also affect your results. Follow these pointers to maximize your efforts:

- **Follow Instructions:** Adhere to the guidelines provided with the whitening products you choose. Overusing products can lead to sensitivity and uneven results.

When your teeth reach that desired brightness, you‚Äôll want to maintain the results for as long as possible. Here‚Äôs how:

The title pretty much sums up everything that I've been thinking about and going through. 

I was in a QPR with my best friend of 10+ years for just over 2 and 1/2 years. The reason we got into a QPR was because we were each others best friends, and we thought that the chemistry of our friendship would carry over into the relationship. I think we did achieve that, but down the line there were a lot of unspoken expectations being brought into the relationship and it didn't sit well with my ex-partner, who for context is AroAce. I now realize that I was placing these expectations on not just her but us as a whole, as I thought that there was a specific way that relationships should look like and act, as taught to us by what the ""norm"" is within society, that norm being what romantic relationships look like. Looking back, I don't even care about meeting those expectations, and I critically failed to realize within my relationship that every relationship is different, and QPR's are no exception to that. It's funny how it took a breakup for me to realize what I actually care about and value within a relationship, but sometimes that's just the way life goes. You make mistakes, but you learn from them. 

Nonetheless, along with my introspection and going through the process of, well, processing the relationship, I've been thinking about A LOT of things, some of which being the thought/idea of dating other people, both now or in the future. For context, even before my QPR I had tried to date other people with the traditional method of dating apps and going out to parties/bars kinda thing, but no matter how much I tried or no matter how pretty or beautiful I may had found someone, I always felt really weird trying to initiate romance or sexual desire for someone I didn't even know. It really just felt *unnatural,* but I shrugged it off because at the time I thought I was just scared of women and was being too picky hahaha. But even now, as a newly single man, the idea of getting into a relationship with someone who I haven't made an emotional connection with, or who I haven't known for a while, feels really wrong to me, and frankly makes me very uncomfortable. I don't really have another way of describing this feeling other than it making me feel awkward and uncomfortable. And to that point, when I got into my QPR with my best friend, I realized that the anxiety I used to have about getting into a relationship was non-existent with her. Like, the way of doing things and the sequence of events that led up to us getting into a partnership just felt *right.* 

Jokes aside, I know however that I am not scared of women or trying to form relationships, as I'm a very outgoing and extroverted individual and I never shy away from wanting to talk to someone, man or woman. I love to talk to people just for the sake of being friendly; however, I now realize that for a WHILE I've mistook friendly intentions and platonic attraction with both romantic and or sexual intentions and romantic/sexual attraction. As silly as that may sound, THOSE ARE NOT THE SAME THING, but I guess allo people think that being friendly (helping a friend through a hard time, or hanging out with them at a coffee shop, or going on outings with them), especially if they are of the other sex, can hold a romantic intention behind it, and this very thing has gotten me in a lot of trouble with friends of mine as they could not distinguish platonic attraction and platonic intentions from romantic attraction and romantic intentions. I *can* distinguish what commitment is and what a friendship is, and I know enough to not emotionally cheat on a partner of mine. But I guess other people don't see it in that same way? 

I also am realizing that I haven't had many crushes in my life, and for the 2 or 3 crushes that I have had, they were admittedly all my friends. They were all people that I knew, and people that I grew to know over the course of some period of time. Once again, I just kinda shrugged this off as the typical love-life experience. I really thought that this was the way that EVERYONE experienced attraction and made long-term committed relationships with people. You meet someone, you become friends, you do stuff together platonically as you get to know them, and once you know them enough over the course of some time and form a strong enough emotional connection with one another, then and only then are you able to consider if you have romantic or sexual attraction towards them. Personality and emotional bond over looks any day of the week. This is why this has been so mind boggling, because... I thought everyone experienced their love life in this way, and I'm now learning that that's not the case???

This kinda dawned on me when I was at the club with some buddies a while back. I never once have looked at someone I found attractive and went, ""oh you're hot I wanna get in your pants"" or ""you're hot I wanna go on a date with you and see if our personalities match"". Even if I did find someone attractive, it was more in my mind along the lines of ""whoa that person is pretty!"", like the same way I would look at a sunset or a cool picture that I like. If I found someone attractive, as weird as this may be to say, I kinda just wanted to watch them do stuff? Just the appreciation of beauty with no hidden motive or intention behind it. And whenever I did chat with people, even my friends, I always talked with them for the intentions of being friends, nothing more or nothing less. If the ""more than friends"" attraction came later down the line then I would accept it, but I've never done anything with the intention of being more than friends off the bat, if that makes sense?  

I came across the term ""demisexuality"" quite some time ago when I was doing research about those who are AroAce, and I learned early on in my relationship what that was and the spectrum that is aromanticism and asexuality. However, with me thinking that I was alloromantic and never really considering anything aside from that, I just never thought of my own experiences and how they may differ from the experiences and understandings of other allos. I just kinda assumed that my allo experiences were the same as everyone elses... and as humbling as this is to say, I'm only now realizing that this is not the case. In the span of just over a week, I've learned about primary and secondary attraction, the experiences of those who consider themselves to be demi, what demisexuality and demiromanticism is, and a bunch of other forms of attraction such as but not limited to: platonic, aesthetic, alterous, fleeting, and a deeper understanding of what romantic and sexual attraction is... and I relate to it more than I thought I would. For myself, I think I experience platonic and aesthetic attraction at first, but down the line after forming a deep emotional bond with someone, I start to experience alterous attraction for those I am interested in.  

To those part of the community, are these the same kind of experiences/realizations you had when you were finding out you were demi? What are your stories when you realized you were demi? I can't help but have the slightest bit of imposter syndrome, but I feel like there's something there that I haven't had the courage to look at in a deeper sense up until now. As someone who never thought of themselves associating with the LGBTQ+ community, this all feels very new and scary to me. I'd love to hear peoples thoughts and experiences:))

Please inquire for any details. I would be happy to discuss the apartment and neighborhood in further detail.

We are looking for a clean and respectful roommate to take over the room. My roommate and I are 26 y/o males. He is a software developer and I work freelance in film.

1hf2jo7,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1hf2jo7/im_hurting_in_my_relationship/,I'm hurting in my relationship.,"I genuinely believed we had something. I'm 2 months into this friendship with her and couple weeks ago we were having a really good time, we were hanging out every day, laughing, bonding, getting close. So I thought its time to tell her my feelings. Now I know confessing is a tricky thing for the other person, really stressful. I got my answer a week later with a really weird ""yes I like you, but we will have to take it really slowly"". It's not the part of taking it slowly for me that is weird, but the time she took to say that. I tried to be understandable and accepted her answer. 

Now its been roughly a week and I feel like she is distancing herself from me. Out of nowhere she decided that she will start using less social media, which is okay, but that shouldn't involve things like messenger where we text, and plan things. When I talk to her It feels like nothing changed, but sometimes it looks like she is hiding something from me. We usually go on coffee breaks, we don't need to text each other to do that, but now she texted me that no coffee today because she has some things to do. I understand people can get busy, but the next thing is... I texted her the other day asking if we will go for coffee today and she answered me like its the first time we are doing this... And she asked if her friend can come, which I'm okay with, I have no problem with that, but why now? There where plenty of times where she could of done that, but now. We had planned to go somewhere on the holidays and now she says she will go away for the holidays with her family and next weekend its her sisters birthday. People can get busy, and they should prioritize they're family, but we were planning things before my confession without any problems, and now nothing works.

This weekend I decided to stop overthinking and take a break, I spent the days with my friends and I'm here now... 2 days without any text from her, nothing and I'm overthinking again. I feel miserable thinking about these things, and I hope she doesn't feel the same way. I want her to be happy, she has done a lot of things for me and changed me as person, but this feeling is painful.

I wonder will she even come start a conversation with me tomorrow? She has never done that, and I wonder if I'll see her waiting for me when it should be our coffee break tomorrow. I don't like this idea of distancing myself too, this could make a bigger mess, but that would give a reason to end things then. I don't want things to end like this, but if I'm going to hurt over this then it will have to end. 

Need advice on what is my next step? Should continue initiating all of our conversations? Do I ask if we will go for coffee? Or do I just shut down and see how she reacts? Maybe just ask what is wrong? Why do I feel this way? Anything is apreciated.

# Intro

I started playing Satisfactory with a friend in early access, we finished what was available in Update 3 in 2020 and continued on and finished Update 6 in 2022. I originally intended to continue that save after the release but the new story, achievements and interest from my friend compelled me to reconsider and we started anew in 1.0.

# Goals

My main goal was to finish the game from beginning to end and get all the achievements. Additionally I wanted to respect nature - as little harm to vegetation as possible and incorporating terrain features into builds where it made sense without outright just building floating platforms. I did not care for aesthetics this time, I got decorating out of my system during early access.

Sub goals were to build modular and extensible factories, process resources locally for less complex parts and use vehicles, mainly trains for transport. (In the old save we had one mega factory with world spanning conveyor belts for inputs but after reading the arguments against that I was interested in trying something different. Never used trains, trucks or blueprints either, it was time to change that as well. Ultimately though, I‚Äôm not sure if I like this setup better or not.)

Secondly, all factories were intended to function non-stop at maximum possible efficiency with all overflows sank from the beginning. That thousand coupons for the golden nut statue seemed impossibly far away.

Lastly, as the most enjoyable part of the game for me personally is the exploration (and I intentionally left roughly half the map unexplored during early access), I also wanted to automate tools for that as early as possible.

# The Beginning

The first couple of weeks were a crazy sugar rush. The progression just happened so fast: we flew through Phases 1 through 3 in less than two weeks. I was in a restless go go go, gotta go faster mental state. It was all sooo good but after a while I realized it would be wise to stop the overstimulation, so I took a break from the game for a whole week.

# Phase 4

When I came back I was committed to going to the end. Phase 4 ended up being absolutely brutal. The complexity just explodes here and I was hit with an additional double whammy: Firstly, my friend, by far the more productive person, did not rejoin after the break. Secondly, a large part of what we built by that point was kind of useless going forward - aside from a few satellite factories.

[AI Limiter factory at one of the satellite locations, one of the few salvageable builds from the early days](https://preview.redd.it/rodsfs42s27e1.jpg?width=1920&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=6639b6f939de9bfd396dd3cd8087ab79aaa5cca7)

Rushing through the early phases meant there was little respect for the original ideals: the early base was a half-organized mess of spaghetti with quite a few hand fed production lines, tractors getting constantly deadlocked, etc.

My friend actually started to plan and build the skeleton/vertical slice of a central base for complex parts production before we finished Phase 3 but it wasn‚Äôt functional yet. (Hence the ‚Äútemporary‚Äù hand fed lines by me‚Ä¶).

On my own, I procrastinated for weeks, in and out of the game. I was especially anxious about aluminum production as that was a huge headache in early access, one that I never managed to solve. (When that factory finally stabilized without constant manual intervention, it never functioned better than with a measly 30% of efficiency‚Ä¶) So I was exploring the map and as I uncovered more and more options I became increasingly uncertain how to approach it. But while I was wasting time I collected lots of hard drives and unlocked quite a few useful alternate recipes. I was going for Sloppy Alumina and Pure Aluminum Ingot in particular, remembering those being somewhat useful in the past.

Then, inspiration struck suddenly one day. I still vividly remember the moment of spotting a crevice over a waterfall on the edge of Red Bamboo Fields and realizing that is the place I could lead out the bauxite conveyors and water pipes relatively cleanly for a production platform over the Lake Forest lake. I finally got to work. To my greatest surprise it was a success at first try, after everything was built and started up, production was immediately at a 100% efficiency, getting more aluminum ingots from one normal bauxite node then from two pure nodes in the past.

[100&#37; efficient aluminum setup](https://preview.redd.it/wewi8v79m27e1.jpg?width=1920&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=24bb5a09d395acd6c0faa7449938596551eed434)

What followed was a lot of thankless infrastructure work and drudgery, beating the skeleton of the central factory into shape (building out and connecting the transport layers to the storage and factory floor through the magic of a logistics floor), rerouting every existing and useful production into it (meaning lots of railroad construction work) and building up proper factories for the necessary inputs neglected during the previous phases. During this I was constantly haunted by anxiety, uncertainty and confusion - especially hard when results only materialized sometimes literally weeks later but I somehow managed to persevere.

# The stackening

While building out the aluminum processing I finally started to get a grasp of blueprints, after a few failed attempts earlier. I liked the concept of using vertical builds for extendibility (I saw a few screenshots here on reddit presenting tall builds giving me some inspiration), so I started to experiment with stackable constructor blueprints.

After a few iterations I managed to get a good working template and there was no stopping and no going back. Stackable Assemblers. Stackable Manufacturers. Stackable Blenders! Stackable Particle Accelerators! Stackable everything!!!

I ended up especially liking that if only conveyor/pipe floor holes and wall outlets are used to connect the blueprints, they become self-cleaning - meaning that when using the blueprint dismantle mode they bring all connections: conveyor lifts, pipes and cables with them so it is easy to modify, replace or reposition whole stacks if the need arises.

Using these blueprints significantly simplified planning and building factories while keeping out of nature‚Äôs way and helped me to speed up my progress again. They were a game changer and after a while I started to get partial to their ridiculous looks as well. Italian cuisine going strong, with some leftover spaghetti lasagna was taking over. The end of Phase 4 was in sight.

[Leftover spaghetti, lasagna takeover](https://preview.redd.it/us6a9oi1p27e1.jpg?width=1920&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=781ae930576eab12bc1dc25d9e7479fef1e4df9d)

# The power situation

The last Project Assembly part for Phase 4 required Particle Accelerators to be made, and those things just devour electricity. The last time I built something dedicated to power production was a coal power plant in Phase 2. Since then I was coasting on burning away byproduct fuel in oil processing plants and connecting a few Geothermal Generators to the grid.¬†

I was afraid it was finally time to go nuclear. It was something I planned to do in early access but never got around to it. I also had vague intentions for it here (previously automated Ionized Filter production for this reason for example), but building up something that complex when I was this close to finishing Phase 4 felt distinctly unappealing.

Then I realized: there were like fifty-odd somersloops lying around unused in a storage box somewhere thanks to my previous exploring and compulsively collecting everything shiny activities. (It‚Äôs a great way to procrastinate after all.) So I plopped down five Alien Power Augmenters and could not stop laughing about cheating my way out of the power requirements. Until Phase 5 hit me in the face, that is.

# Phase 5

In Phase 5, every new machine is a power hungry beast. I was appalled, the feelings of being lost and confused came back with full force. So I procrastinated by exploring a bit more and connecting the remaining geysers to the grid. Every little bit counts! - says the justification seeking voice in my head. Luckily, anxiety did not last long this time as I had another realization. I had barely used overclocking thus far. So what if I just overclock the Oil Extractors for the plants I already had‚Ä¶ Soon enough, I had 56 additional Fuel Generators happily chugging away and I thought I was set. Which turned out to be mostly true, I only needed to do a bit of juggling in the end when I slooped some of the Quantum Encoders. I finished the game without going beyond Turbofuel!

https://preview.redd.it/oqmecopbk27e1.jpg?width=1920&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=a08fb383f786ef67ac57c435a603348a34791cbc

Otherwise, Phase 5 turned out to be a walk in the park. With all the infrastructure in place, I did not have to build any new capacities, just extend what already existed and add in the new inputs. Not an inch of new railroad laid down. Not a single new truck. Okay, I set up a new drone, but only because I was curious about how they worked.

[Crater lakes diamond factory, an excuse to use a drone](https://preview.redd.it/gpxga9wkk27e1.jpg?width=1920&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=3c5d40e401eb8d460dbbad0a1087978387f84762)

Finished the game five days after Phase 4 was done. Coupons rolled in when the overflow of the most advanced parts started going down the sink. I got the stupid, seemingly unattainable statue before the last Project Assembly Part was done.¬†

We toured the map and the factories with my friend and we watched the ending together. It felt pretty special altogether, I might even say it was ‚Ä¶satisfactory.

# Conclusion

I love this game and I learned a lot during this playthrough. And not just about the game, I also had to reflect on my own tendencies and overcome some personal difficulties in (in this case only perceived) performance pressure situations.

On the other hand, this is a game I was unable to experience in a healthy way. For the two months I could barely think of anything else and a lot of the times I played in excessively long sessions, I could barely tear myself away. That‚Äôs fully on me, the game is wonderful and does not contain any of the psychological manipulations other, mainly mobile and live service games employ to retain engagement. It just hacked my brain regardless.

Originally, I just wanted to share a few screenshots of the final factory because I like how ridiculous the stacks look, this ended up being a weird and long retrospective. If you are here, thanks for reading!

And thanks for Coffee Stain for making the game. Especially for Hannah and the level design team for the wonderful map. And for Snutt, Jace and Mikael for the uniquely great way they engage with the community. The rest of the devs I don‚Äôt know by name, but I‚Äôm grateful for all their work just as well.¬†

Finally, to half-jokingly quote a review I read on (I think) steam: Please don‚Äôt ever make a game like this again, I have a life I should be living!

Just moved into first apartment with bf so excuse the clutter it‚Äôs still far from being put together yet. My initial plans for the space was to be decorated very warm and cozy with lots of warm earthy tones, tons of plants etc.
https://pin.it/2uxcAnlOe
So I had my heart set on a persian style rug with lots of warm tones and primarily red.

We were at the store the other day and saw this rug though, the cream and black one and figured it would match really well with our furniture, which leads me to be conflicted now with this choice.
 
Important note for other furniture we will have a tall wooden bookcase where that little black shelf is by the TV, it‚Äôs like a medium warm reddish wood, cherry wood almost?? I would like to buy a warm wooden coffee table to match as well. We have lots of art and books with blacks, reds and earthy tones as well

I think I‚Äôm still leaning towards the red style because it will bring a lot of the warmth and character that I want into the space. The cream one is tempting though because it‚Äôs convenient, I live in a small town so not a lot of options and I don‚Äôt need to order online if I get that one, and it will also seamlessly match the furniture we already have without much effort. But I worry if we choose that one it will be too much boring sad beige.. So just curious what others think! Thanks! 

(Any other recommendations welcome too, I‚Äôm having a really difficult time finding a good coffee table too lol)

Dodgy is actually good, just have a few quantums/coffee/tea handy. 

If someone isn‚Äôt already sharing 3* team medic make sure you are, so if someone uses a stimpak you get that heal.

for stage 2,3,4 having a vampires weapon you can free aim out of vats is great. EPR if you‚Äôre commando and willing to do that hunt. For 1 and 5 I use a q2525 railway. 

This is for everyone: you DONT need to stand ON the drill to protect it in stage 2, in fact it‚Äôs smarter to stand away from it and lure the mole miners and mole rats away from it. Crippling their legs helps. You don‚Äôt even need to defend it until it‚Äôs half way full. If youre running to get fuel, try to get the further and more hidden tanks first so if everyone dies the last person can get them easy. (Edit: apparently it‚Äôs a bug and sometimes they attack the drill immediately. So again if the person is protecting, make sure it‚Äôs away from the drill)

kill lynx in stage 3 first. This is when I say dodgy is actually good along with a vampires free aim weapon. Using it on the eyebots so vats wont reset and then vats epsilons heads. Killing lynx>vulture>bloodhound is my go too since lynx has the more annoying effect. 

If your a herbivore grab blight, it‚Äôs everywhere around the ash heap. Blight soup and sunshine oil are VERY good buffs to have handy for the terror. Sunshine oil you can actually stock up since it doesn‚Äôt degrade.

# July 5, 2122, 00:00 warp on the warship Mary Rose

Owens prepared the medical bay, the hum of the air filters a constant backdrop. The harsh, sterile light reflected off gleaming surfaces and the air tinged with antiseptic. She signaled for the specimen to be brought in, and mechanical arms extended, gripping it securely in the zero-gravity environment.

Owens took a steadying breath, her gloved fingers hovering over the alien‚Äôs form. This was more than just an autopsy‚Äîthis was a confrontation with the unknown. She photographed it from head to toe, each shutter click punctuating the silence. Her voice trembled slightly as she activated her recorder.

‚ÄúMedical Doctor Owens, 00:00 UTC. Specimen A-ZERO exploratory autopsy.‚Äù

She paused, observing the figure suspended before her.

‚ÄúThe specimen is bipedal with four arms. Approximately two meters tall. It wears a black exoskeletal suit with a helmet featuring reddish-orange visors, likely for light filtration. Beginning suit removal.‚Äù

She located an orange circle on the collar and pressed it. Carefully, she lifted the helmet free, the visor‚Äôs reflection catching the sterile light before she set it aside and studied the face beneath. Owens hesitated for a moment, taking in the alien‚Äôs features. The tusks and serrated teeth hinted at a predator, but the eyes‚Äîlarge, reflective‚Äîseemed almost curious. She noted her observations clinically, pushing away a creeping sense of awe.

‚ÄúThe face is wide and pale. Eyes like a predator‚Äôs‚Äîlarge, slit-pupiled, blinking horizontally. No nose, just narrow slits. Boar-like tusks jutted from a mouth lined with serrated teeth. The ears are flat, hugging close to the head and come to a¬† point.‚Äù

She resisted the urge to speculate, choosing instead to move forward, her thoughts reserved for the final report.

*Focus Owens.*

Finally managing to remove the rest of the suit and put it aside for further study, she observed.

‚ÄúThe specimen does not wear any clothing under the suit. Pale skin with dark stripes everywhere except the face, palms, and soles of the feet. no hair or furr. The smell can only be described as‚Ä¶ funky. The specimen has sustained bullet wounds to the neck, right shoulder joint, and lower torso.‚Äù

Owens leaned closer, scrutinizing the fine details of the specimen‚Äôs skin. The pale surface had an almost opalescent sheen under the medical bay lights, marred only by the stark, dark stripes that flowed along its body in symmetrical, sinuous patterns. She reached out and ran a gloved finger across the surface.

*Smooth, but with a faint texture‚Äîalmost like sanded leather.* She noted this silently, then spoke into the recorder.

‚ÄúThe skin is resilient to the touch, with a subtle grain that may contribute to durability or camouflage. Dark stripes could serve a purpose in visual communication, environmental adaptation, or even temperature regulation.‚Äù

She drew a deep breath, the sterile air doing little to quell her fascination. The bullet wounds stood out as crude intrusions on such a meticulously evolved form. Owens studied them, the edges of the injuries puckered and discolored.

‚ÄúBullet wounds have a notable lack of bleeding, likely due to rapid coagulation or differences in circulatory pressure. This warrants further investigation.‚Äù

‚ÄúThe specimen‚Äôs wide facial structure and pronounced zygomatic-like arches suggest powerful jaw muscles. The cat-like eyes, with horizontal eyelids, indicate excellent low-light vision. The¬† reddish-orange visor likely shields against specific light frequencies.‚Äù

She took a moment to examine the limbs closely.

‚ÄúThe torso is tall and tapered. The upper set of arms is muscular are imposing, each ending in hands with two fingers and a thumb. The digits are thick, and claw-like. Below them, smaller arms offer dexterity, each with three fingers and two thumbs.‚Äù

*Strength and precision, housed in the same body.*

The musculature was immediately striking‚Äîdense fibers running like thick cables beneath the skin. Flexing one of the fingers, she noted how the joints responded with smooth, mechanical efficiency.

‚ÄúPrimary arms exhibit exceptional muscle density. Finger structure suggests strength-oriented tasks‚Äîgripping, lifting, and possibly striking. Calloused pads on the fingertips imply regular contact with abrasive surfaces or tools.‚Äù

Turning her attention to the smaller, lower arms, she gently spread each of the five digits of the hand and examined the delicate tendons that lay beneath the membrane of the skin.

‚ÄúSecondary arms are markedly more refined. The joint articulation allows for a wide range of fine motor movements. The skin here is thinner, suggesting an emphasis on precision tasks rather than brute force. These limbs could serve specialized roles‚Äîcrafting, surgery, or operating intricate machinery.‚Äù

Her voice remained steady and clinical, even as the hours stretched on. Her gaze traveled to the legs: powerful, thickly jointed structures that flared into broad, two-toeless pads.

‚ÄúLeg structure is adapted for stability and force distribution. The wide padded feet likely provide excellent traction and are likely optimized for rough terrain. Two large visible toes that appear to bear most of the weight, kinda like hooves.‚Äù

She paused, letting her observations sink in, before preparing for the internal examination. With steady hands, The scalpel gleamed coldly as she steadied her grip.

‚ÄúBeginning initial incision. The skin resists at first contact... requires more force than anticipated.‚Äù

The blade finally broke through with a subtle *snick*, and Owens widened the opening. The tissue beneath revealed itself in layers: a latticework of muscle, sinew, and a dense skeletal structure that gleamed with an almost metallic rigidity.

Owens felt the pull of exhaustion beginning to settle in her neck and shoulders, but she pressed on, determined.

‚ÄúMuscle fibers are dense and dark, suggesting high oxygen saturation and rapid energy expenditure. Bone composition is extraordinary‚Äîdenser than human bones, with a sheen that may indicate a mineral reinforcement or composite structure.‚Äù

She gently probed deeper, revealing the heart nestled beneath a network of arteries thicker than her fingers. The chambers are intricate and complex.

‚ÄúThe heart has six chambers. This configuration likely supports a highly efficient circulatory system, capable of sustaining intense physical exertion over extended periods. Blood is dark, almost purple, indicating an oxygen-binding protein different from human hemoglobin.‚Äù

Owens‚Äô voice dropped slightly, and the fatigue was evident now.

‚ÄúThe specimen‚Äôs biology suggests an environment where strength, endurance, and adaptability are critical for survival.‚Äù

She let out a slow breath, her mind whirring with questions that would need answers far beyond this sterile room. The hum of the air filters seemed louder now, a reminder of the void beyond the bulkheads.

Her hands trembled slightly as she reached for the scalpel again. Thirteen hours in, and her mind felt like it was processing through fog. She clicked off the recorder. For now, she had enough.

# July 05, 2122, 13:30 warp on the warship Mary Rose

As Owens dragged herself from the sterile confines of the medical bay, the gravity of what she had uncovered pressed on her shoulders like a physical burden. The creature‚Äôs anatomy defied easy classification, but the hints were clear enough. Strength. Precision. Adaptability. These were not random invaders‚Äîthey were the vanguard of something cold, calculated, and far more organized than humanity had ever faced.

The engineering bay buzzed with low murmurs and the hum of equipment. Vargas looked up from his work, his expression guarded. McKinley leaned against a console, arms crossed, trying to mask his unease.

Owens approached, the alien suit clutched tightly in her gloved hands. The black exoskeleton glimmered under the lights, its reddish-orange visor catching reflections like a dead eye. The smell of it‚Äîmetallic, faintly charred‚Äîcut through the recycled air.

‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs up, Doc?‚Äù McKinley‚Äôs attempt at humor fell flat, his tone strained as he eyed the alien artifact.

Owens‚Äô lips barely twitched in response. Her fingers gripped the edges of the suit tighter. ‚ÄúI need you to analyze this‚Äîevery inch of it. There‚Äôs something in here, some key to understanding what we‚Äôre up against.‚Äù

Vargas raised an eyebrow and took the suit carefully. ‚ÄúWhat do we know so far about... whatever the hell they are?‚Äù

‚ÄúVery little,‚Äù Owens swiped through her datapad and flashed a close-up of the specimen‚Äôs face. The image filled the small screen‚Äîthose reflective, slit-pupiled eyes, the broad pale features, the cruel tusks.¬†

‚ÄúThis is the face of our visitors,‚Äù she said, her voice hollow. ‚ÄúThey‚Äôre not just invaders. This... this is a weaponized species. I need sleep, but you need to tear this apart. We‚Äôre at war, and we can‚Äôt afford ignorance. I still have to run so many tests.‚Äù

She took a step back, the fatigue clawing at her. ‚ÄúRun scans, pull it apart if you have to. There‚Äôs a war coming, and we need to understand everything we can about these bastards.‚Äù

The door slid shut behind her, sealing the tension in the room. Vargas and McKinley exchanged glances, the weight of the truth settling in their bones.

They were standing on the precipice of something vast, something merciless.

‚ÄúWe‚Äôre on the edge of something big,‚Äù McKinley muttered, his fingers flexed restlessly. ‚ÄúI want to shoot it. See how tough that armor really is.‚Äù

‚ÄúWe‚Äôll get there,‚Äù Vargas said, his voice distant, already lost in thought. He turned to the suit, its sleek menace undeniable.

The engineering bay was a wreck of improvised tools, scorched components, and half-drained coffee cups. The trio had worked through exhaustion, dismantling the alien suit piece by piece. What they found painted a grim picture.¬†

Vargas stared blankly at the dismantled remains, his eyes unfocused and hollow. He swallowed hard, steeling himself before dismissing the marines. Adams chose to stay. The clang of their boots faded down the corridor, leaving him alone with the chilling evidence. He cracked his knuckles and began typing his report.

*Subject: Specimen A-ZERO Armored Exosuit*

The internal structure is built on a titanium alloy skeleton, which is remarkably lightweight but capable of withstanding high-impact forces. The armor plating is a dense, multi-layer composite. Effectively resistant to small arms fire. Vulnerable points exist at the joints, but precise targeting is essential. An integrated power source enhances the wearer‚Äôs physical strength and speed. Likely functions as a force multiplier, turning already formidable physiology into a battlefield nightmare. The helmet features a neural link, allowing seamless communication between the wearer and the suit‚Äîpotential for rapid adaptation or reflex-based responses.

Vargas paused, his fingers trembling. The suit wasn‚Äôt just protection; it was an extension of a predator perfected by evolution and technology. Humanity‚Äôs weapons felt like relics by comparison.

He leaned back, exhaustion seeping into his bones. *We‚Äôre outmatched.* The realization settled like ice in his veins.

This was more than a battle for survival. This was a race to understand the enemy before extinction became a certainty.

‚ÄúAre we ready for this?‚Äù Adams asked quietly.

‚ÄúNo,‚Äù Vargas whispered. ‚ÄúBut we don‚Äôt have a choice.‚Äù",4,1734295988.0,HFY,3,1.0,False

Alright now that I have your attention, here is the actual 3 page manifesto/last words of ""UnitedHealthcare CEO Killer"" Luigi Mangione. Not the bs you see circulating in the media now. Every time I share the link, it eventually gets pulled down, so here I am having converted the document in full for people who want the actual truth. I'm hoping that posting it in this format means it stays up for a while before Reddit removes it again. I've also uploaded the source material to¬†[https://ibb.co/album/nzTgx4](https://ibb.co/album/nzTgx4), because it has since been removed from the original platform ""Substack"". Just as an FYI, I do not promote violence in any way shape or form.

The Allopathic Complex and Its Consequences  
DEC 09, 2024

The second amendment means I am my own chief executive and commander in chief of my own military. I authorize my own act of self-defense in response to a hostile entity making war on me and my family.

Nelson Mandela says no form of violence can be excused. Camus says it's all the same, whether you live or die or have a cup of coffee. MLK says violence never brings permanent peace. Gandhi says that non-violence is the mightiest power available to mankind.

That's who they tell you are heroes. That's who our revolutionaries are.

Yet is that not capitalistic? Non-violence keeps the system working at full speed ahead.

What did it get us. Look in the mirror.

They want us to be non-violent, so that they can grow fat off the blood they take from us.

The only way out is through. Not all of us will make it. Each of us is our own chief executive. You have to decide what you will tolerate.

In Gladiator 1 Maximus cuts into the military tattoo that identifies him as part of the roman legion. His friend asks ""Is that the sign of your god?"" As Maximus carves deeper into his own flesh, as his own blood drips down his skin, Maximus smiles and nods yes. The tattoo represents the emperor, who is god. The god emperor has made himself part of Maximus's own flesh. The only way to destroy the emperor is to destroy himself. Maximus smiles through the pain because he knows it is worth it.

These might be my last words. I don't know when they will come for me. I will resist them at any cost. That's why I smile through the pain.

They diagnosed my mother with severe neuropathy when she was forty-one years old. She said it started ten years before that with burning sensations in her feet and occasional sharp stabbing pains. At first the pain would last a few moments, then fade to tingling, then numbness, then fade to nothing a few days later.

The first time the pain came she ignored it. Then it came a couple times a year and she ignored it. Then every couple months. Then a couple times a month. Then a couple times a week. At that point by the time the tingling faded to numbness, the pain would start, and the discomfort was constant. At that point even going from the couch to the kitchen to make her own lunch became a major endeavor

She started with ibuprofen, until the stomach aches and acid reflux made her switch to acetaminophen. Then the headaches and barely sleeping made her switch back too ibuprofen.

The first doctor said it was psychosomatic. Nothing was wrong. She needed to relax, destress, sleep more.

The second doctor said it was a compressed nerve in her spine. She needed back surgery. It would cost $180,000. Recovery would be six months minimum before walking again. Twelve months for full potential recovery, and she would never lift more than ten pounds of weight again.

The third doctor performed a Nerve Conduction Study, Electromyography, MRI, and blood tests. Each test cost $800 to $1200. She hit the $6000 deductible of her UnitedHealthcare plan in October. Then the doctor went on vacation, and my mother wasn't able to resume tests until January when her deductible reset.

The tests showed severe neuropathy. The $180,000 surgery would have had no effect.

They prescribed opioids for the pain. At first the pain relief was worth the price of constant mental fog and constipation. She didn't tell me about that until later. All I remember is we took a trip for the first time in years, when she drove me to Monterey to go to the aquarium. I saw an otter in real life, swimming on its back. We left at 7am and listened to Green Day on the four-hour car ride. Over time, the opioids stopped working. They made her MORE sensitive to pain, and she felt withdrawal symptoms after just two or three hours.

Then gabapentin. By now the pain was so bad she couldn't exercise, which compounded the weight gain from the slowed metabolic rate and hormonal shifts. And it barely helped the pain, and made her so fatigued she would go a entire day without getting out of bed.

Then Corticosteroids. Which didn't even work.

The pain was so bad I would hear my mother wake up in the night screaming in pain. I would run into her room, asking if she's OK. Eventually I stopped getting up. She'd yell out anguished shrieks of wordless pain or the word ""fuck"" stretched and distended to its limits. I'd turn over and go back to sleep.

All of this while they bled us dry with follow-up appointment after follow-up appointment, specialist consultations, and more imagine scans. Each appointment was promised to be fully covered, until the insurance claims were delayed and denied. Allopathic medicine did nothing to help my mother's suffering. Yet it is the foundation of our entire society.

My mother told me that on a good day the nerve pain was like her legs were immersed in ice water. On a bad day it felt like her legs were clamped in a machine shop vice, screwed down to where the cranks stopped turning, then crushed further until her ankle bones sprintered and cracked to accommodate the tightening clamp. She had more bad days than good.

My mother crawled to the bathroom on her hands and knees. I slept in the living room to create more distance from her cries in the night. I still woke up, and still went back to sleep.

Back then I thought there was nothing I could do.

The high copays made consistent treatment impossible. New treatments were denied as ""not medically necessary."" Old treatments didn't work, and still put us out for thousands of dollars.

United Healthcare limited specialist consultations to twice a year.

Then they refused to cover advanced imaging, which the specialists required for an appointment.

Prior authorizations took weeks, then months.

UnitedHealthcare constantly changed their claim filing procedure. They said my mother's doctor needed to fax his notes. Then UnitedHealthcare said they did not save faxed patient correspondence, and required a hardcopy of the doctor's typed notes to be mailed. Then they said they never received the notes. They were unable to approve the claim until they had received and filed the notes.

They promised coverage, and broke their word to my mother.

With every delay, my anger surged. With every denial, I wanted to throw the doctor through the glass wall of their hospital waiting room.

But it wasn't them. It wasn't the doctors, the receptionists, administrators, pharmacists, imaging technicians, or anyone we ever met. It was UnitedHealthcare.

People are dying. Evil has become institutionalized. Corporations make billions of dollars off the pain, suffering, death, and anguished cries in the night of millions of Americans.

We entered into an agreement for healthcare with a legally binding contract that promised care commensurate with our insurance payments and medical needs. Then UnitedHealthcare changes the rules to suit their own profits. They think they make the rules, and think that because it's legal that no one can punish them.

They think there's no one out there who will stop them.

Now my own chronic back pain wakes me in the night, screaming in pain. I sought out another type of healing that showed me the real antidote to what ails us.

I bide my time, saving the last of my strength to strike my final blows. All extractors must be forced to swallow the bitter pain they deal out to millions.

As our own chief executives, it's our obligation to make our own lives better. First and foremost, we must seek to improve our own circumstances and defend ourselves. As we do so, our actions have ripple effects that can improve the lives of others.

Rules exist between two individuals, in a network that covers the entire earth. Some of these rules are written down. Some of these rules emerge from natural respect between two individuals. Some of these rules are defined in physical laws. like the properties of gravity, magnetism or the potential energy stored in the chemical bonds of potassium nitrate.

No single document better encapsulates the belief that all people are equal in fundamental worth and moral status and the frameworks for fostering collective well-being than the US constitution.

Writing a rule down makes it into a law. I don't give a fuck about the law. Law means nothing. What does matter is following the guidance of our own logic and what we learn from those before us to maximize our own well-being, which will then maximize the well-being of our loved ones and community.

That's where UnitedHealthcare went wrong. They violated their contract with my mother, with me, and tens of millions of other Americans. This threat to my own health, my family's health, and the health of our country's people requires me to respond with an act of war.

Struggling with insecurities and boundaries. ,"I‚Äôve been dating a man for the past six months. He has a very close bond with a female friend whom he relied on emotionally after his marriage separation. They had a past attraction but decided they were better off as friends. She‚Äôs often at his store/caf√© business and spends a lot of time with him‚Äîdinners, coffee catch-ups, Pilates, and social events, as they share the same circle of friends.

I‚Äôve been struggling with insecurity around their connection, especially as I have a history of betrayal and abandonment wounds. When I see them together, I feel triggered, like there might still be something unresolved between them, which leaves me feeling unsafe and rejected. This has caused tension‚ÄîI‚Äôve acted cold towards her and even asked if we could talk, but she refused and later told my boyfriend that my ‚Äúenergy was too big‚Äù for her. I don‚Äôt feel respected by her.

I‚Äôve brought up concerns about their dynamic multiple times, and while there have been small changes, I still don‚Äôt feel fully safe or secure. It has taken a real mental and emotional toll.¬†

I‚Äôve noticed a pattern in myself where I get very triggered and have difficulty stepping back to self-soothe without ruminating. I have a tendency to end it when triggered (possibly FA), I experience intense emotions, mental looping, obsessive thoughts, and a lot of emotional pain. I‚Äôve wondered if I might have BPD or if this relationship is just triggering core abandonment wounds, leading me to spiral into anxious attachment. Similar things have happened for me with past relationships.¬†

Recently, I ended the relationship after a triggering incident. While I was away on holiday for a week, he saw her 2‚Äì3 times without letting me know. This made me feel like he turns to her to fill my space when I‚Äôm unavailable, which reinforced my feelings of insecurity. I explained that I didn‚Äôt feel safe in the relationship.

Now I‚Äôm struggling deeply with my decision, completely distraught. I feel ashamed for the way I‚Äôve handled things in the past 1‚Äì2 months, where I‚Äôve threatened to end it several times when triggered. I care about him deeply, and there is nothing wrong with our connection alone. We share alot of the same values and beliefs. It‚Äôs just external circumstances, and his lack of awareness that has made it challenging. But I‚Äôm questioning whether we‚Äôre ultimately incompatible because of these dynamics or if we could work through this together.¬†

Should I accept that he might not be able to meet my needs and walk away for my own well-being, or should I give it another chance and try to improve things together? Has anyone experienced something similar? I‚Äôd really appreciate any advice or insights.

Okay, let's dive into this art chat because, honestly, art is like drugs for me, but without the hangover. I mean, I'm two years sober now, and art has been my new fix, my new way to feel something or, in some cases, nothing at all.

First off, my love for art really kicked off with graffiti. I mean, the late SAME, Christopher Johnson, he was like my personal guide through the New York art scene back in the day. He showed me that art didn't have to be this pristine thing locked away in galleries; it could be rebellious, raw, and right there on the streets where everyone could see it. It was him who introduced me to this whole underground scene where art was about making a statement, not just about selling to the highest bidder. I remember him saying he wanted to ""skin Tavi and wear her to Fashion Week,"" and that kind of chaotic, amazing energy was what art was all about for me back then.


But then, there's this whole other world of art, right? The kind that's in museums, the stuff you're supposed to ""appreciate."" I went to The Met once, and it was like stepping into another dimension. The art there, it's like it's speaking to you from centuries ago, telling you stories of love, war, beauty, and all the human drama. There's this piece by Caravaggio, ""The Calling of St. Matthew,"" and the way light plays in that painting... it's like the light is calling to you, just as it calls to Matthew. It's not just art; it's an experience, a moment where you're connected to something greater than yourself.

I've also got this thing for performance art because, let's be real, life is performance art if you think about it. I remember reading about Marina Abramoviƒá and her piece ""The Artist is Present,"" where she just sat there, looking into people's eyes. It was so simple yet so profound. It's like, in a world where we're all so busy, so distracted by our screens and our lives, here's someone who's just there, present, with you. That's art that hits you in the feels. 

And then there's the art of beauty, makeup, fashion. That's an art form too, right? It's ephemeral, it changes, and it's so personal. I used to write about beauty like it was my own form of performance art. When I did my makeup, it wasn't just about looking good; it was about feeling good, creating a persona for the day. The art of applying eyeliner is like drawing your own battle lines for the day, preparing for whatever the city throws at you. And fashion? Oh my god, fashion is like living art. Every outfit is a statement, a piece of wearable art. 

But here's where it gets interesting for me now. In sobriety, art has become this meditation, this way to find nothingness, or ≈õ≈´nyatƒÅ as they say in Buddhism. I've been reading about it, not because I'm some scholar, but because I feel it. When I look at a piece of art now, there's this peace, this emptiness that's not empty but full of potential, of understanding. Art, in its best moments, feels like waking up without the noise of addiction, just pure, unadulterated experience. And isn't that what art is supposed to do? Make us feel, make us think, make us see the world in a different light?

So yeah, art for me is this wild journey from the streets of New York with SAME to the quiet, reflective moments with a canvas or page. It's about life, it's about death, it's about the in-between. And if you're not living your life like it's a piece of art, what's the point, right? ",2,1734295222.0,CatMarnell,0,1.0,False

1hf1r0t,https://www.reddit.com/r/macbookair/comments/1hf1r0t/midnight_or_silver/,Midnight or Silver???,"I have done a ton research and have watched just about every single review there is on YouTube on the M3 MacBook Air. I really love the midnight color for many reasons, one that it actually matches some of the colors in my room and I always just really liked that dark blue tone. I also like that classic silver as well. I know many ppl say it‚Äôs boring or whatever but I‚Äôm ok with boring. I‚Äôm not out here trying to impress ladies at the local coffee shop. It brings back that old nostalgia of the MacBooks of old. 

I have tossed and turned for over a week now and which color I‚Äôm going with and still cannot make up my mind. I‚Äôm a bit ocd and meticulous about things esp when they‚Äôre new so if I go for the midnight I want to make damn sure I don‚Äôt regret it. It seems like the m3 is less of a fingerprint magnet and I wash my hands and don‚Äôt travel with my laptop so I don‚Äôt really see it being much of an issue. I don‚Äôt mind the ritual of cleaning my things as I‚Äôm really used to it. I also have a microfiber cloth for my glasses and I imagine any prints come right off easier now with a few wipes. 

I guess my question is which one do you prefer and if you have the midnight do the prints come off easily or do you still find smudges to be difficult to get off. This seems like an overblown issue but every single post or review online really focuses on this even with the m3 which is supposed to be much less resistant to fingerprints. I don‚Äôt see why it would an issue if you don‚Äôt mind cleaning it a lot. 

This honestly seems pretty minor but so many comments and reviews I see make it like it‚Äôs some huge deal to point that they almost regret getting the MacBook Air in Midnight. I want to order the M3 MacBook Air tomorrow so I need to settle this color issue soon. I would be happy with silver but I have loved this color much longer than before it was on a MacBook so I‚Äôm really conflicted on this! 

Please help me make up my mind on this. I currently am wanting to trade in my M1 MacBook Pro in Space Grey. I like that color but I‚Äôm ready to switch it up as it‚Äôs a pretty dinged up and has some issues that aren‚Äôt worth the money to fix. It‚Äôs about time for a new one. Thanks in advance!

1hf1pou,https://www.reddit.com/r/superautomatic/comments/1hf1pou/thinking_about_returning_this_thing/,Thinking about returning this thing,"We bought a magnifica Evo with the attached milk carafe with the black Friday deals going on. I have always been a coffee drinker but I am usually fine just drinking black coffee. Since I have gotten the machine I have gotten better at dialing in all the settings, mainly grind, to pull good shots. 

We had bought some expensive coffee on a trip to big island, and then a $40/lb of Kauai peaberry coffee from Costco. Nothing is fresh at this point but it's def some premium beans. I think I'll grab a bag of freshly roasted dark or medium roast to see if it helps. 

Here's the thing - yesterday I used my cheap ass drip coffee pot to make a pot of Peet's pre ground I had that didn't do well in the magnifica. I realized I like my coffee that is steeped way more than these bitch ass Americanos that are all watered down, the drip coffee is much more full bodied and flavorful. Most days I usually just enjoy black coffee in the morning.

I am enjoying the cappuccinos and the milk drinks but it seems like they don't even stay hot and if I don't finish drinking them In like 5 minutes they're lukewarm. The cheaper one that just has a milk frother can it get the milk hotter? If yes id consider buying that attachment And doing the milk myself. Also seen some of the strategies people use like heating the mug up in the microwave with water in it. 

Anyways I brought up returning it to my wife but she wants to keep it. I'm just not sure it's worth it, we aren't really Starbucks people, she usually just drinks black coffee too and that's not even everyday. I'm usually not a fan of returning things that are well used but it's a lot of money and we have a baby on the way.

Also I find I'm drinking a lot more coffee and it's giving me bubble guts. 


Tl;Dr: I'm a savage that is fine with my black coffee out of a drip machine or French press and prefer it over the Americanos. Paid $575 for this machine and we aren't exactly wealthy, should I return it?

1hf1kdv,https://www.reddit.com/r/JamesHoffmann/comments/1hf1kdv/question_about_the_grinding_rule_regarding/,Question about the grinding rule regarding different brewing methods,"I recently received a French press as a gift and, when I came across some videos on the internet about the brewing method, I almost naturally watched James Hoffmann's video on his French Press method - [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=st571DYYTR8](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=st571DYYTR8). In it, and also in one of his videos where he compares immersion and percolation methods - [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=09fNvoQMlGw](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=09fNvoQMlGw), I found a point quite intriguing, which ended up being a complete turnabout of everything I knew about brewing methods depending on the grind size.

Here‚Äôs the point: classically, it is known that the faster the water passes through the coffee, the finer the grind should be ‚Äì meaning that to compensate for the short contact time, the contact area is increased. However, James recommends that the grind for the French Press should not be that coarse, and in his method, the water stays in contact with the coffee even longer. In my mind, the logic would be to have an over-extracted, bitter coffee, but that‚Äôs not what happened in the video or in real life when I started using the French Press: I really liked the results.

And here‚Äôs where it gets complicated: why, in an immersion method, doesn‚Äôt it seem to make such a difference to use a finer grind, compared to pour-over? For example, I‚Äôve used a fine grind in my V60 and the result was disastrous: bitter, over-extracted coffee.

Does this have to do with the saturation point of the water, the extraction? If so, how does that work? What‚Äôs the explanation for why coffee with a finer grind (and by ""finer,"" I don‚Äôt mean espresso grind, but rather medium grind, maybe a bit finer than the typical medium grind) ends up tasting horrible in a pour-over, but in the French Press, where the water stays in contact with the coffee even longer, this doesn‚Äôt make much of a difference?

James Hoffmann‚Äôs comparison video about immersion and percolation methods is very telling on this: how can the immersion method perform so much more evenly better, regardless of the grind size? What other factors for a good coffee am I ignoring that would help me understand this?

We loaded up our peddle kayaks (Hobie Pro Anglers) and had a great first night at Cedar Hammock.

Was clear and cold with overnight low of 39f. No bugs and excellent star gazing. Saw lots of amazing birds includin cranes, ibis, hawks, herons, egrets, and heard owls galore. Two small gators seen in the main Canal on the way out there. 
Next day went to Coffee Bay, did some fishing along the way and saw a couple more gators and lots of egrets. Coffee Bay was a nice sheltered site which was great because we could hear the wind whipping across the swamp but barely got any gusts. Much warmer with perfect overnight lows in 40s. A bit more buggy right after sunset but not terrible. Liked the space the spread out at this site. Much less wildlife at this site but great being among the trees. Next day paddled out 5.5 miles, orange trail. Saw a few more gators and birds and had a nasty head wind the whole way.

I have educational advice for new plasma donors who may be considering to try it out and earn extra money:

* Plasma is 92% water and the rest is mostly protein elements and electrolytes.

* The plasma is separated from your blood and your red blood cells are returned to you in cycles.

* Your body regenerates plasma fast from staying hydrated and eating protein.

* Per FDA regulations, you're only allowed to donate plasma twice in a 7 day period, with a 48 hour wait inbetween those two times. Don't risk your health by hopping around to different plasma donation centers to circumvent these regulations, and you may get caught if you do.

1. Eat a meal high in protein 2-3 hours before donating, but your plasma protein levels depend on what you ate the day before.
2. Drink plenty of water and/or non-caffeinated juice before donating to stay hydrated. It's important to stay hyrdrated at least the day before, and the day of your donation.
3. Avoid caffeine such as in coffee or soda before donating or you may get nauseous and vomit or faint during your donation.
4. No alcohol 24 hours before, and for a little while after donating.
5. No exercising for at least 6 hours after donating as it can put too much stress on the vein.
6. Some people get away with smoking or vaping nicotine before and after donating, but it's recommended not to for 2 hours before and after. The nicotine can raise your heart's pulse rate.
7. If your pulse rate is 100 or above, you'll be able to do a vitals retake after a 15 minute wait. But if it's 100 or higher again you'll be deferred for the day. If your pulse rate is an issue, listen to ""Pink Noise"" or ""Green Noise"" at a low volume before donating which may help reduce your pulse rate, along with its effect on lowering your blood pressure.
8. There is a risk of getting a blown vein if the worker is having a hard time finding your vein when they're sticking you with the needle or if you have small veins. You may get deferred until your vein heals if that happens. But it's ok, your body is able to regenerate your veins with a process called Angiogenesis.
9. There is a risk of blood clots, but when your blood is constantly moving through the machine it prevents that from happening.
10. You may be subject to drug screening. The drug screening tests for methamphetamines, cocaine, and heroin. Certain pharma prescription meds may show up as a false positive so you'll want to let the plasma center know what meds you're taking. Testing positive for these drugs can result in a permanent deferral from donating plasma.
11. A sample of your blood will be drawn periodically to test for certain sexually transmitted infections (STIs). A positive test will result in either a temporary or permanent deferral from donating plasma. If you've ever been diagnosed or received treatment for HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis B (HBV) or Hepatitis C (HCV) you will be permanently deferred from donating plasma.

Donating Plasma with Managed Diabetes

Individuals with well-controlled diabetes can contribute to plasma donation, but certain criteria need to be met:

Absence of Complications: This means no existing diabetic complications affecting your kidneys, heart, blood vessels, or eyes.

Insulin Independence: If you rely on insulin for diabetes management, a three-month waiting period is required after using needles for non-prescribed medications. Additionally, you must be free of symptoms or treatment needs related to blood sugar fluctuations (high or low) for the past three months.

1. Healthy Feet: Active foot ulcers requiring medical attention will disqualify you from donation.
2. Steady Balance: You shouldn't experience dizziness or lightheadedness upon standing.
3. Type 1 Consideration: For Type 1 diabetics, eating within two hours of donation is mandatory.



* Wait a few hours before taking the bandage wrap off of your arm after donating.
* It's recommended to use Vitamin E oil/Mineral oil on the needle site for the puncture area to heal better. A Q-tip can be used to apply it easier. I simply dip the Q-Tip in the bottle, but never dip the used cotton back into the bottle.
* Frequently donating over a prolonged period of time may lead to your body having decreased vitamin D levels.

* Red meats are particularly high in the protein vitamins and minerals found in plasma.
* Personally, I take a Now brand Vitamin D supplement that contains vitamin D3, Calcium, Magnesium, and Zinc. But I only take a half a dose, 1 gel capsule instead of 2, since I get these from eating meats and other foods as well. It's bad for your health if you take too much of these vitamins and minerals over time. I also take an Iron supplement once or twice a week. I also try to drink a protein shake before donating. Just to be safe.

1hf1e7n,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1hf1e7n/my_bfs_19m_mom_50f_keeps_accusing_me_of_having/,My bf‚Äôs (19M) mom (50F) keeps accusing me of having ADHD because I am ‚Äútalkative.‚Äù My bf wants to defend me but doesn‚Äôt know where to start. Help? ,"I, 19F have been dating my 19M bf for six years. My family adores him. 

My parents will invite him over for events even if I don‚Äôt suggest him coming first. Despite us not being engaged, or married (Planning on making it official once we graduate college and get some financial stability established), he has even made it onto our family Christmas cards. To say he has become part of my family is an understatement. 

With his family though, it‚Äôs a different story. My bf is the youngest son to his parents, let‚Äôs call them Sue and Bob(50F and 57M) and has an older brother Tim( 28M) who is married to Aleisha (23F). His parents are very traditional and conservative in their way of thinking, not necessarily political.  
My bf has always made jokes that he is his parents ‚Äúgolden child,‚Äù as growing up he always felt like his parents painted him as a boy who did no wrong. His brother jokes about it too. So naturally, whenever we started dating in middle school and some conflict would happen, and he would ask his mom or dad for advice, the fault always would fall on me.
For example, my bf once asked his mom for advice on how to tell his friends that he wanted to sometimes play video games with me too instead of just with them. His mom told him that I just needed to let ‚Äúboys be boys‚Äù and give them space and learn to ‚Äústep back and not always need attention from bf.‚Äù My bf never went to her for relationship advice after that one. 

Over the years, there have been small passive aggressive comments towards me. When my bf spoils me and buys me dinner it‚Äôs always, ‚ÄúYk GF‚Äôs name can pay for dinner too sometimes. You don‚Äôt always need to pay.‚Äù I do pay for dinner a lot, and I get my bf treats all the time. Sometimes I‚Äôll send him $10 to buy him and his buddy a coffee when they‚Äôre studying. Our relationship is very 50/50 and spoiling eachother is our love language. My bf LOVES spoiling me, whether it‚Äôs as simple as carrying me inside when it‚Äôs raining or running me a bath when I‚Äôm sick. 

Whenever I mistook a bouquet of flowers he got me as not mine, because my bf (the sweet man he is), gets his mom flowers too, I was labeled as ‚Äúinconsiderate and unappreciative.‚Äù It was a misunderstanding that is still brought up today. My bf‚Äôs parents ranted to my bf‚Äôs SIL and brother about this instance. 

Whenever my bf accidentally backed up into my car in his driveway because he was going to the store, it was my fault because ‚Äúhe acts different when I‚Äôm around.‚Äù I was inside taking a nap. 

Little things keep happening, and I‚Äôm always blamed or judged in some way. I‚Äôm Hispanic, like my bfs SIL, and come from a large and loud Hispanic family. Whenever I start to come out of my shell and behave like I normally would around my family I get comments like ‚Äúwow you must be excited, you‚Äôre talking a lot.‚Äù Or ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre loud, etc etc.‚Äù however, the SIL doesn‚Äôt get the same comments even though me and her joke about how we act the same because of the family‚Äôs we come from. I love my bfs SIL and she‚Äôs like the older sister I never had. 

The other night me and my bf were watching a show, and I‚Äôm slightly hard of hearing, so I put CC on. His mom walked in and made a passive aggressive comment about the closed captions. We ignored it. They‚Äôve always given me trouble for having the closed captions on. 

Later at dinner though, she randomly said 
‚ÄúYou know, I think you have ADHD‚Äù talking to me. I was taken aback. My mother is a clinical therapist, works at a school dealing with children who have ADHD, ADD, anxiety, depression, etc., everyday. I‚Äôve never once been accused of having ADHD. 
So I ask her why she thinks that. She goes on to say ‚ÄúWell the videos I‚Äôve watched about ADHD in women all have reminded me of you. You watch tv with CC on, you always interrupt people when you‚Äôre talking, or you talk super loud, and you always have to ask people to repeat themselves by saying ‚Äòwhat??‚Äô‚Äù Reminder, I‚Äôm hard of hearing. Thanks 7 years of being in cheerleading and band. 

My bf and I just looked at eachother, and back at her. We didn‚Äôt really know what to say. I just laughed it off and changed the topic. 
Ever since then, she won‚Äôt stop bringing it up. Last night my bf tried to defend me saying that he thinks her ‚Äúdegree in Facebook videos‚Äù doesn‚Äôt really signify that I have ADHD. She wouldn‚Äôt back down and kept insisting I have adhd. I don‚Äôt think ADHD is a bad thing, my bsf has it. But I don‚Äôt believe I have it. 
My bf was super angry after that, and wanted to say something. I just suggested we go to bed.

He wants to have a conversation with them about how they‚Äôve always treated me since we were 13, and how they still judge me for things I did as a young 14 yr old, even now as an almost 20 yr old young woman. His parents have never really listened to him though whenever he talks about his feelings or issues he has, even not involving me. 

We don‚Äôt know where to start. 
Any advice? Is there anything I can do to help this situation or help my bf tackle communicating with his parents? 

Thanks!!

I have educational advice for new plasma donors who may be considering to try it out and earn extra money:

* Plasma is 92% water and the rest is mostly protein elements and electrolytes.

* The plasma is separated from your blood and your red blood cells are returned to you in cycles.

* Your body regenerates plasma fast from staying hydrated and eating protein.

* Per FDA regulations, you're only allowed to donate plasma twice in a 7 day period, with a 48 hour wait inbetween those two times. Don't risk your health by hopping around to different plasma donation centers to circumvent these regulations, and you may get caught if you do.

1. Eat a meal high in protein 2-3 hours before donating, but your plasma protein levels depend on what you ate the day before.
2. Drink plenty of water and/or non-caffeinated juice before donating to stay hydrated. It's important to stay hyrdrated at least the day before, and the day of your donation.
3. Avoid caffeine such as in coffee or soda before donating or you may get nauseous and vomit or faint during your donation.
4. No alcohol 24 hours before, and for a little while after donating.
5. No exercising for at least 6 hours after donating as it can put too much stress on the vein.
6. Some people get away with smoking or vaping nicotine before and after donating, but it's recommended not to for 2 hours before and after. The nicotine can raise your heart's pulse rate.
7. If your pulse rate is 100 or above, you'll be able to do a vitals retake after a 15 minute wait. But if it's 100 or higher again you'll be deferred for the day. If your pulse rate is an issue, listen to ""Pink Noise"" or ""Green Noise"" at a low volume before donating which may help reduce your pulse rate, along with its effect on lowering your blood pressure.
8. There is a risk of getting a blown vein if the worker is having a hard time finding your vein when they're sticking you with the needle or if you have small veins. You may get deferred until your vein heals if that happens. But it's ok, your body is able to regenerate your veins with a process called Angiogenesis.
9. There is a risk of blood clots, but when your blood is constantly moving through the machine it prevents that from happening.
10. You may be subject to drug screening. The drug screening tests for methamphetamines, cocaine, and heroin. Certain pharma prescription meds may show up as a false positive so you'll want to let the plasma center know what meds you're taking. Testing positive for these drugs can result in a permanent deferral from donating plasma.
11. A sample of your blood will be drawn periodically to test for certain sexually transmitted infections (STIs). A positive test will result in either a temporary or permanent deferral from donating plasma. If you've ever been diagnosed or received treatment for HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis B (HBV) or Hepatitis C (HCV) you will be permanently deferred from donating plasma.

Donating Plasma with Managed Diabetes

Individuals with well-controlled diabetes can contribute to plasma donation, but certain criteria need to be met:

Absence of Complications: This means no existing diabetic complications affecting your kidneys, heart, blood vessels, or eyes.

Insulin Independence: If you rely on insulin for diabetes management, a three-month waiting period is required after using needles for non-prescribed medications. Additionally, you must be free of symptoms or treatment needs related to blood sugar fluctuations (high or low) for the past three months.

1. Healthy Feet: Active foot ulcers requiring medical attention will disqualify you from donation.
2. Steady Balance: You shouldn't experience dizziness or lightheadedness upon standing.
3. Type 1 Consideration: For Type 1 diabetics, eating within two hours of donation is mandatory.



* Wait a few hours before taking the bandage wrap off of your arm after donating.
* It's recommended to use Vitamin E oil/Mineral oil on the needle site for the puncture area to heal better. A Q-tip can be used to apply it easier. I simply dip the Q-Tip in the bottle, but never dip the used cotton back into the bottle.
* Frequently donating over a prolonged period of time may lead to your body having decreased vitamin D levels.

* Red meats are particularly high in the protein vitamins and minerals found in plasma.
* Personally, I take a Now brand Vitamin D supplement that contains vitamin D3, Calcium, Magnesium, and Zinc. But I only take a half a dose, 1 gel capsule instead of 2, since I get these from eating meats and other foods as well. It's bad for your health if you take too much of these vitamins and minerals over time. I also take an Iron supplement once or twice a week. I also try to drink a protein shake before donating. Just to be safe.

1hf1cux,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1hf1cux/aita_for_being_fed_up_with_my_husbands_tornado/,AITA for being fed up with my husbands tornado messes,"There are three bathrooms in this house. Two of them are out of commission and one has a broken sink. I have been asking my husband to put back up the curtain rod for months. There‚Äôs old tires in the car port, bottles of oil the porch is destroyed‚Ä¶.

I feel like there‚Äôs no point in cleaning my house anymore because he destroys all order I create. I asked him to pass me a diaper for the baby come back to the bedroom to find ALL OF THE BINS taken out of the closet, left all over the bedroom floor, his pants will be in the babies clothes bin and the babies clothes in the diaper bin. Just all of the order I create trashed because he went to get a diaper. Now imagine that‚Äôs how it is every time he does anything. 

What I‚Äôm asking is, even if you‚Äôre really conservative and traditional about gender roles in the house, and you believe that the woman is supposed to clean up. Aren‚Äôt there still some things a man is supposed to do to take care of his home to make it look nice? It can‚Äôt all be up to me right? Is it unreasonable that I expect if you‚Äôre making yourself coffee that there‚Äôs not pools of coffee all over the counter with grinds and sugar just peppered all over the counters and floors? Cups and spoons everywhere and all the spices taken out of the cabinet and put all over? It seems strangely excessive even if you think a woman should be cleaning up after a man, do normal people even CREATE those kinds of messes? Am I crazy? 

And shouldn‚Äôt he be taking care of the lawn? Keeping the tool sheds organized? Making sure the house isn‚Äôt breaking down? 

Now look i want to be clear he works a lot and is very tired often. But i try to tell him that‚Äôs why you don‚Äôt make wild and crazy messes because if you‚Äôre neat and orderly about the way you go through your day you don‚Äôt have huge messes to clean after. But he just gets mad and defensive. He says what ever he has to say so I shut up and nothing changes it‚Äôs been 13 years I love him and he‚Äôs good to me but I am losing my mind because I feel like we aren‚Äôt going to have a house by the time that we pay off the mortgage. I have lost all energy to try to clean up because I feel like he wouldn‚Äôt care if this place looked like a crack house he‚Äôd be the same and I could make it look very nice and he wouldn‚Äôt notice and he would trash it he would never try to maintain any cleanliness or order I create. 

I love him but I‚Äôm at my wits end and I don‚Äôt know what to do I have tried talking with him, showing him, asking nicely, begging him, and now I‚Äôve been getting very upset and yelling and threatening to leave him ‚Ä¶ AITA? Ask me anything about his side of the story I know there‚Äôs two sides to everything and I want to be objective and fair. But this is just the situation",1,1734294014.0,AmItheAsshole,16,0.57,False

1 lb skinless salmon fillets, about 4 pcs
¬Ω cup all-purpose-flour
¬Ω cup buttermilk 
1 teaspoon of blackened seasoning
¬Ω teaspoon dried cilantro
¬Ω teaspoon dried parsley
3 eggs
1 cup grated Parmesan cheese
1 cup normal Panko bread crumbs
1 teaspoon lemon juice
Robust olive oil for coating before cooking

:Prep:
Preheat the oven to 450F. Place a cookie cooling rack on top of a baking sheet or line the baking sheet with parchment paper.
Pat dry the salmon fillets with paper towels. Remove the skin if necessary and cut them into 1"" nugget-shaped pieces.
Line up 4 bowls or breading trays. In one bowl combine the flour, blackened seasoning, dried cilantro, and dried parsley, In another bowl, whisk the eggs and lemon juice. In another bowl fill it with the buttermilk. And in the fourth bowl, combine the parmesan cheese with the bread crumbs.

:Make the salmon nuggets:
Coat the salmon pieces in the seasoned flour and shake them to remove any extra flour, Dip into the egg bowl, then in the flour again, then buttermilk, then flour again, then the egg bowl again, and then finally the Parmesan mixture, gently pressing the panko-parmesan mixture into the fish. You want a nice coating of this.
Place the breaded salmon pieces on the prepared baking sheet. Spray robust olive oil spraying over all the salmon nugget pieces or use a brush to give them a light coat of olive oil.

:Bake the salmon nuggets:
Bake the salmon nuggets for 15 to 20 minutes until they're nice and golden brown. If the nuggets are directly on parchment paper and you want both sides of the nuggets to crisp up, remove them from the oven halfway through, flip them, spray the second side, and finish cooking them.
Then serve and enjoy

I know for certain this is the case, and I have appealed the ticket, but I don't really have concrete proof of it.

We live in the age of fantastic special effects. We live in an age of AI deep fakes. Sora and other AI-based tech can make convincing video from text prompts while you sip your morning coffee. If they can make [insert Hollywood blockbuster], people can easily make things akin to the deluge of supposedly-real vids we‚Äôre all seeing. 

It‚Äôs essential we all use our best critical thinking skills when assessing whether or not something is likely to be true. With all the relatively inexpensive and powerful digital creation tools everyone has access to, extraordinary claims are going to take extraordinary proof. 

Also, be aware of your own confirmation bias. If you want all this to be aliens, you‚Äôre going to be a lot more easily convinced it‚Äôs aliens despite logic and a lack of hard evidence. If you want this to be a US govt or foreign covert op, it‚Äôs going to be easier to convince yourself that‚Äôs the case when something fits your internal narrative.

It won‚Äôt take much for some ambitious teenager who pirated a bunch of SFX programs to troll a bunch of the planet with some cool vid they cooked up while chugging Code Red Mountain Dew. A lot of the garbage I‚Äôm seeing in various subreddits is laughably bad, and some people are taking it seriously.

Stay neutral. Stay objective. Something is happening, we all know that. We don‚Äôt know what it is, and we have proof of nothing. One way or another, the truth will eventually come out.

Sort of a ‚Äòthanks but no thanks‚Äô because who would drop out in the middle of the season once they‚Äôd scored that job? Well apparently someone had, and if I could get there tomorrow, the job was mine.¬†

When I got the call I was on my way to work. I finished my drive, walked into the trashy dive bar I‚Äôd been serving at, and told them I was quitting, I‚Äôd found something better.¬†

I grabbed whatever non-perishables I had lying around the house and drove through the night. It was a drive-up tower, so I could afford to be a bit sleepy that first day since I didn't have to hike in.¬†

I like to think I masked my tiredness pretty well when Ranger Mike showed me around. The first stop was the cabin I‚Äôd be staying in. It was small but cozy, and I hadn‚Äôt been sure if I‚Äôd end up with running water or not, so when he showed me the shower I was delighted. I had to stifle a few yawns as we went out into the warm sun to explore around. There was a small meadow before the forest started, but just a few steps into the trees I saw something that jolted me awake.¬†

There had been a fire here, recently. Everything was grey and brown, and the few trees that stood upright looked ready to fall. The lack of canopy over the ruin was startling, compared to the lush forest around it. It was like a big scar.¬†

‚ÄúOh wow.‚Äù I said ‚ÄúIs this why the last lookout left? It‚Äôs crazy how close this must have been to the tower.‚Äù

‚ÄúNo, Robbie stuck around after the fire, we got him out hours before it got here,‚Äù Mike said. ‚ÄúRobbie got spooked by the animals. We think there might have been a grizzly that got burned in the fire, we‚Äôre not sure if it‚Äôs still around or not so I wanted to talk to you about safety and all that before I go.‚Äù

I instantly pictured some kind of awful half-burned bear wandering around in the woods, and for the first time, I thought about how alone I was going to be out here. But I repressed any hesitation I had, this is what I‚Äôd signed up for. ‚ÄúSo that‚Äôs why Robbie left?‚Äù I asked.¬†

‚ÄúYeah, he just had some kind of run-in late at night, and it scared him. Not everyone can handle being out here alone.‚Äù¬†

I wanted to ask more questions but figured we‚Äôd get to that in the safety talks. And well, I wanted to prove that I *could* handle being out here alone. I didn‚Äôt want Mike to think I‚Äôd just get scared and leave over some bear.¬†

When we walked up the long steps to the tall tower, any worry I had vanished. The view from the top was breathtaking. The burnt section of the forest didn‚Äôt diminish the view, if anything it enhanced it, making the intact forest look infinitely more vibrant and green in contrast to the desolation. I could handle anything the forest was going to throw at me if this was my reward. The mountains looked like they went on forever.

The rest of the orientation went smoothly. I‚Äôd filled in as a volunteer before, just a few times, but I had enough experience that Mike seemed to think I could handle myself. Things did get a bit strange near the end when Mike was giving me the safety talk back in the cabin though.

We discussed bears, and what to do, and there wasn‚Äôt much I didn‚Äôt already know. But Mike seemed reluctant when I tried to pry a bit more about what had gotten the last guy to leave so quickly. I wanted to know if the bear had tried to charge him or mess with the cabin at all. Mike danced around my question for a bit, before finally saying ‚ÄúLook, sometimes after a fire, the bears, and deer, and hell even the squirrels just act a bit strange. It can be‚Ä¶ well, unnerving. You‚Äôre out here all alone and the wildlife, some of which is big enough to hurt you, is acting all screwy. It can be too much. Boy, I could tell you some stories about the things I‚Äôve heard guys in this job say they‚Äôve seen after a fire, and you wouldn‚Äôt believe what people come up with.‚Äù

‚ÄúLike what?‚Äù I asked.

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt want to fill your head with ghost stories and nonsense when you‚Äôre about to be on your first big job kid.‚Äù

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt mind.‚Äù

‚ÄúReally, it‚Äôs nothing, and I should be going anyway,‚Äù Mike said, gathering up his papers. ‚ÄúJust watch yourself okay? And well, keep an eye out on the animals too, they might be a bit out of sorts right now, that fire was just last week.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat should I watch for?‚Äù I asked.

‚ÄúJust anything strange. You‚Äôll be alright kid.‚Äù

With that, Mike left me alone.¬†

I had that day to get settled in, though I‚Äôd brought very little with me in the rush, figuring I‚Äôd go home the first weekend and get what I needed then. But I had my sketchbook, and Robbie had left me plenty of reading material. He was supposed to come back up and get his stuff at some point, but I figured in the meantime he wouldn‚Äôt mind if I borrowed his books. He‚Äôd also left a sleeping bag crumpled up in the tower, which I felt a bit uneasy about, as it hinted at a rather hasty departure.¬†

After I‚Äôd gotten the lay of the land I went for what was supposed to be a quick nap in the cabin, but I didn‚Äôt wake up until the sun was setting. I rushed up to the top of the tower, glad I hadn‚Äôt missed my first sunset. There were only a few clouds in the sky, but the fog rolling in from the west gave a bright haze in the hollows of the hills. I watched the orange sky fade to pink, feeling at peace for the first time since I‚Äôd arrived. But just as the sun started to crawl completely behind the far ridgeline, something caught my eye on a distant peak.¬†

The treetops were rustling in a line like something was jumping along the branches. I grabbed the binoculars from the top of the bookshelf, only to discover both lenses were cracked. More disturbingly, there were brownish-red stains spiderwebbed along the cracks. I dropped those quickly. I had a pair in my bag, but I hadn‚Äôt brought anything upstairs yet, so I just squinted to see what I could see.¬†

There was a dark, smooth shape, sort of moving along the tops of the trees. It looked big, maybe a martin or bear cub? But the weird thing was, there weren‚Äôt really starts and stops from it jumping. But I was pretty far away, and the fog had thickened with the setting sun so I figured maybe I just couldn‚Äôt see it very well. The way it moved was so fluid, almost like it was just floating, so sure of itself that it didn‚Äôt need to pause as it went. As it approached a small clearing in the forest, I stopped blinking, ready to get a better idea of what it was when it had to jump to the ground.¬†

But, to my shock, the creature did not drop down as it hit the clearing. Instead, four long, shadowy legs stepped out from the trees. The creature hadn‚Äôt been jumping along the treetops, the creature simply was as tall as the canopy. I watched as the thing began to emerge from the woods, but just as I felt I could maybe start to get a good look at it, it turned to look at me instead. Its round head at the end of its long neck jolted, and even from miles away, I knew it was watching me because I could see its glowing orange eyes pointed directly at me.¬†

With that I jumped down under the glass, hiding where the windows stopped. I stayed like that for a long time, past sunset. When my heart stopped racing, and my hands stopped sweating I was eventually able to convince myself that I‚Äôd imagined the whole thing. I was able to make myself walk, not run, but walk calmly as a sane person would, down the steps to my cabin.¬†

That first night I didn‚Äôt sleep.¬†

When dawn broke I set up my stuff. I wanted to clean up the cabin a bit before morning check-in. I put Robbie‚Äôs stuff into a corner so it was all nice and tidy whenever he came back for it. I spent some time studying the map on the Fire Finder and saw two of the other nearby lookout towers marked at the edge of my map. We had five altogether in this forest, and it was a comfort knowing that there were other people out here with me, even if they were far away.¬†

The Fire Finder itself spun okay and seemed to be in good condition, but I didn‚Äôt like that Robbie had taken a grease pencil and scribbled Xs all over the glass covering the map. He‚Äôd also frantically circled a few spots near the cabin, which I did not appreciate. Just as my mind started to try and piece together if any of the X‚Äôs matched up with what I‚Äôd seen last night, I decided I needed to get rid of them. I wasn‚Äôt going to let some crazy guy ruin my time here and get in my head. I erased everything he‚Äôd scribbled and tried not to dwell on the locations.¬†

The morning meeting was uneventful, but it was nice to see some friendly faces, even if it was just over video chat. Everyone welcomed me to the team, and though they all seemed nice, most of the names escaped me, I was exhausted.¬†

The first day passed uneventfully, as did the first week, but I found myself getting into the routine of things, and calming down after that first night. We had wifi at the tower, but I was trying to pretend that I didn‚Äôt. Except for the meetings of course. I wanted to learn to unplug, so I started working my way through Robbie‚Äôs books until I could get some of my own from home.¬†

He had mostly horror paperbacks, but as I‚Äôm sure any fire lookout has, there were nature books too. My favorite was a field guide about the trees in the area. They were mostly pine, but I didn‚Äôt realize how many different kinds there were in the forest.¬†

I started taking the field guide with me and trying to identify and sketch the different trees when I was off duty. It was especially interesting to walk through the burnt area and see what was already competing for space in the ashes of the old forest. Many of the trees in the area had thick bark, and tall branches, dropping the ones closer to the ground as they grew, in an effort to be more fireproof.

Other trees had fire built into their life cycle, and new shoots near the base of old trees were kickstarted after a blaze. My personal favorite way the trees adapted to the heat though, was with something called serotinous cones. This meant that the pinecones would lay dormant for years, even decades, refusing to open and drop any seeds until they were burned in a fire, and the waxy seal that kept them closed finally broke.¬†

I didn't spot any fires that first week, and after ten days it was time for my weekend. It was ten days on four days off for us, so I had plenty of time to head home, and actually pack the way I meant to. On the drive back I was excited to be leaving civilization more permanently.¬†

My excitement quickly fizzled though when I saw someone waiting for me at the cabin. I thought maybe he was a hiker, so I put on my best customer service voice. ‚ÄúHey man, how‚Äôs it going?‚Äù I asked him.¬†

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre my replacement,‚Äù he said. It wasn‚Äôt a question. Then it clicked, and I noted the backpack he had on. Robbie must have come back for his stuff.

‚ÄúI guess I am. Nice to meet you.‚Äù I held out my hand and he didn‚Äôt take it.¬†

‚ÄúI‚Äôm just gonna say what I‚Äôm gonna say okay?‚Äù¬†

‚ÄúOkay‚Äù

‚ÄúThey‚Äôre lying to you. Mike, and the other lookouts. There‚Äôs something weird going on here, and I just wanted to warn you because it‚Äôs the right thing to do, and I know you‚Äôre not going to believe me, and that‚Äôs okay.‚Äù

‚ÄúRobbie,‚Äù I said, ‚Äúwhat did you see that made you leave?‚Äù¬†

‚ÄúI saw a bear watching me sleep.‚Äù He said simply, then pointed up at the tower ‚ÄúHe was watching me sleep from up there.‚Äù¬†

‚ÄúWhat do you mean? From the tower?‚Äù I laughed a little. ‚ÄúRobbie that‚Äôs not possible.‚Äù

‚ÄúI said what I‚Äôm gonna say and I‚Äôm leaving.‚Äù he pushed past me, and I called after him, but he just got in his car.¬†

That night I slept up in the tower. Not because I was afraid of what might be out there, but because I wanted to look out at the stars. What Robbie had said was so absurd that it honestly kind of put me at ease about the whole situation.¬†

Over the next week, I saw my first storm from up in the tower, and it was glorious and terrifying all at once. I spotted my first fire. Though when I radioed it in, Mary, the girl to the east of me had already spotted it. I used the Fire Finder to help pinpoint it, and it felt good to be doing a bit of what I‚Äôd actually come here to do.¬†

As summer wore on I made more headway in exploring the forest around the tower. I‚Äôd brought some watercolors with me after that first week. I spent a lot of time painting, drawing, and reading. But more than that I spent time just sitting in the tower staring out at the mountains, even when I was off the clock. It was so easy to get lost in just watching the forest move.¬†

I felt more at peace than I ever had in my life. I‚Äôd never quite felt comfortable back home. Growing up in the city, you‚Äôd think I‚Äôd be used to living in a crowded place, but everything was so loud, and I could never force myself to be a people person. I‚Äôd always felt like there was something just a bit off about myself that set people on edge. I‚Äôd never been able to achieve that kind of effortless camaraderie that everyone else in the world seemed to be capable of. I had friends of course, and relationships, but somehow it always felt like something was different in the way I was with others compared to the way other people were with each other. I‚Äôd catch girlfriends watching me intently sometimes as if they were studying me in some strange way, trying to piece together what they were looking at. And friends, even those of many years, were never close with me in the same way that they were with each other.¬†

But out here none of that mattered. It was just me, and the forest. Sometimes the other watchers would call in, wanting to chat, and more often than not I found myself ignoring them. Wasn‚Äôt the point of coming out here to get some peace and quiet?

I started spending my weekends venturing farther into the forest, going on all-day hikes. One day I decided to follow the burned area as far as I could. By then there were a ton of saplings coming up, enough to blanket most of the forest floor in a sprinkling of green.¬†

Aside from the extra sunny weather, the hike wasn‚Äôt too different from my others, until the early afternoon when I found something strange. I noticed it because it was being propped up on one side by a sapling struggling under a patch of fur. It was a bear carcass, or part of one anyway.¬†

The hide was definitely there, so my first thought was that someone had skinned the creature, but they‚Äôd made a mess of it. The fur wasn‚Äôt cut in any discernible pattern, but it didn‚Äôt look as if the creature had just decomposed, there was still blood visible in places. I figured maybe someone had killed it for food, and that‚Äôs why they didn‚Äôt care about the hide. But that didn‚Äôt make a lot of sense, it would be much less risky to hunt literally any other animal.¬†

I tried looking for the skull, thinking it would be neat to bring back to Ranger Mike, so I started digging around in the loose fur. I noticed a distinct lack of bones and flesh right away, so I started to think again that I had just found a botched hide job, but then I saw a flash of white among the ash. Then, my brain registered for the first time just how much ash was on the remains. Like it had been here before the fire. Or perhaps killed by the fire? But that didn‚Äôt make any sense, the fur would be burnt up.¬†

I dug through the ash and found a tooth, which led to more teeth. Then I found something squishy and realized I‚Äôd found an eyeball. Another quick dig rewarded me with the other one, and I didn‚Äôt know what to make of my discovery at all after that. I examined some more of the skin, and it looked less and less like a knife had made the cuts. It was like the bear had exploded, just jagged shreds all around the edges of the pieces.¬†

I went back home after that, convinced that there was some kind of mysterious thing happening here, and I wanted to get to the bottom of it. I felt like an explorer, on the cusp of some great discovery.¬†

That night I slept in the tower, while a storm raged outside. It was exhilarating.¬†

I woke up just as the sun was beginning to rise, and grabbed my binoculars. It was a foggy morning, and off in the distance, I saw a familiar sight. There was a dark shadowy creature moving in the forest. It was closer this time, and it looked shorter than it had before despite the change in proximity. The beast was on all fours, and its stocky form had me wondering if it was the same creature I‚Äôd seen last time, perhaps there was more than one of these beasts out there.¬†

It stood up on its hind legs and looked at me from three peaks to the west, its eyes burning like the morning sun. Then, it fell back on its feet and started heading towards me. Good, I thought, let it come.¬†

I lost sight of it when the morning mist cleared. I went about my day as usual after that. I spotted a small fire, but it turned out to just be a campfire in an unauthorized area. That night at sunset I sat perched in my tower, watching for anything that might be watching me back. I soon spotted the beast much closer to me now. It wasn‚Äôt as tall as the first creature I‚Äôd seen, this was definitely a different beast, and it had a humped back. Its eyes were the same flickering orange, but as it got closer I couldn‚Äôt make out anything else about it. Like it was a moving shadow, but as it moved, the trees moved with it.¬†

By the time it reached the tower it was dark, but it had gotten close enough to give me some ideas. It reared up on its legs again and peered into the tower, blocking out an entire side of the building. It had a round head, like the first beast, but an elongated mouth, almost like a snout. It blended into the night, so it was hard to see too much, but when it opened its mouth, I saw only more blackness. The creature didn‚Äôt have fur or skin or anything tangible, it didn‚Äôt look quite real, and it was hard to make out any features. But what I could make out for certain as it sniffed and panted at my window was that it did not have any teeth.¬†

I wondered if it was looking for the ones I‚Äôd brought home with me.¬†

After that, I knew what I had to do. It was another week before we got another fire. After I called it in and got the coordinates I bolted to my car. Something glorious was happening and I needed to see it for myself.¬†

I parked on an incline close enough to see, but not close enough to be seen, and hopefully not close enough to get burned. I hiked as close as I dared and watched from a distance as helicopters fought the blaze. This was a small one, and it was pretty clear they weren‚Äôt going to have any issues, so I started to walk closer. I‚Äôd come prepared with a respirator, but the smoky smell in the air was still thick. I waited until the choppers evacuated, then I moved in to examine the ashes.¬†

I could see the entire burned area was contained along just a small part of the mountainside, they‚Äôd gotten to it quickly, and the recent rains probably helped it spread slower. By the time I found what I wanted in the smoldering embers, it was nearly sunset, and my head hurt from the smoke, but it was worth it. Lying among the smoking embers and ash was a snakeskin. But it wasn‚Äôt shed, nor burned. It was ripped up. I dug around in the still-warm ash at one end and found tiny white teeth. Carefully, I started sifting around with my fingers for something soft, but this took longer. I finally found my prize about a foot away as if it had been flung. Buried in ash, yet completely intact was a single tiny eye.¬†

That night I slept like a baby up in my tower, and when I awoke I was greeted with a new friend in the distance. At the very edge of my vision, along the farthest peak to the south was a shadow. Only this one stood on two feet, and as it walked its arms swayed to the sides.¬†

I stopped drawing in my sketchbook and started to write down my theories. Whatever was going on, I wanted to be the one to document every minute of it. When the other watchers would call me, my excuses for why I couldn‚Äôt chat became less and less polite, and soon I stopped picking up completely if it wasn‚Äôt during work hours. I didn‚Äôt have time for them, and I had far more important things to do.¬†

This led to Ranger Mike paying me a visit, on my day off no less. The nerve of some people. He claimed he just wanted to check up on me, and that he was worried because I hadn‚Äôt been socializing very much. I told him that I was just really enjoying my alone time, but that I would try to be more cordial. He tried to weasel his way into my tower, under the guise of a morning cup of coffee, but I politely rebuffed him, saying I had a lot to get done that day.¬†

I couldn‚Äôt let him see my collection.¬†

Things were going well until I got my first hiker. Then they were going even better. His name was Luke and he‚Äôd wandered over from his friends who were apparently dispersion camping nearby. The old tower by the visitor center dealt with the bulk of tourists for our park, but we were still supposed to be friendly when any wandered by our towers. Luke was very friendly. Too friendly. He and his friends were definitely either drinking or smoking, and I couldn‚Äôt help but judge them for letting him wander off alone.¬†

Luke was far too gone to be any trouble to me, so I figured there was no harm in showing him around. Of course he wanted to see the top of the tower, so I walked up behind him, ready to catch him if he stumbled.¬†

He spent a good fifteen minutes staring wordlessly out the windows, which endeared him to me a bit. High or not, this was a man who showed a proper appreciation for nature. I gave him the speech I‚Äôd had prepared for tourists, and though I hadn‚Äôt used it yet I still had it memorized. How there used to be thousands of these towers almost a century ago when the program was founded. Fire watchers would try to stop any and every fire from burning until they realized that that was actually harming the environment. Regular burns were needed to use up the dry brush and curtail the truly catastrophic burns. It was a part of the cycle of nature, and we weren‚Äôt meant to stop it entirely. All the usual history. But then I started to tell Luke about some of my own theories.¬†

‚ÄúI think actually, that we should take it a step further,‚Äù I told him.¬†

‚ÄúRight on,‚Äù He said, he‚Äôd been throwing me 60‚Äôs style affirmations the whole speech, which if I‚Äôm being honest, grated me a bit, and diminished some of the goodwill he‚Äôd earned earlier.¬†

‚ÄúI think that if we let the fires burn even more, we could learn something about ourselves, about our place in nature.‚Äù I started to point to some of my research, which I‚Äôd taped to the walls below the windows, ‚ÄúSee, I have a theory that there are some animals, and people too, who need the fire to live out their complete life cycle. Just like the pine trees do. They don‚Äôt become what they‚Äôre really meant to be unless they burn. I can‚Äôt figure out why it‚Äôs all different animals though, and why it‚Äôs only some. But I‚Äôve been wondering if maybe the ones who need it weren‚Äôt really what they were pretending to be in the first place.‚Äù I pointed out the drawings I‚Äôd done of the human-like creature on the ridge ‚ÄúOr maybe they‚Äôre chosen to become something different because they‚Äôre special. That‚Äôs the theory I like best.‚Äù

But Luke didn‚Äôt like that. He didn‚Äôt like my ideas.¬†

‚ÄúHey, that‚Äôs cool, but I should be getting back to my friends.‚Äù I could see his eyes focusing more like he‚Äôd realized something was wrong and he was trying to ground himself in reality. His eyes darted nervously over my collection as if he was worried the eyes on the bookshelf were looking back at him.¬†

I took him down the steps and brought him to where he‚Äôd wandered out of the woods. He noticed, for the first time, the spot where I‚Äôd been having my bonfires. ‚ÄúIsn‚Äôt there like a burn ban right now?‚Äù he asked, his unease replaced by curiosity now that we were out of the tower.¬†

‚ÄúThere is. But don't worry, I‚Äôm only burning things to make them better.‚Äù

Luke did not know what to say to that. He threw me a peace sign and wandered back into the woods. Soon I could hear voices in the distance. His friends must be close by. Very close by.¬†

The next day I awoke to several pairs of burning eyes watching me from outside my tower, and several new fresh pairs inside of it. The creatures outside couldn‚Äôt speak, but I knew what they wanted. It was time for me to join them.¬†

I started at my beloved bonfire pit, then went all around the cabin, trailing gasoline. Then I liberally splashed the dry brush at the edge of the woods. Finally, I trailed a generous amount up the stairs with me, to ensure I couldn‚Äôt change my mind. Lastly, I doused my research along the walls. I‚Äôd realized that the outside world wasn‚Äôt ready for what I‚Äôd discovered. But that didn‚Äôt matter.¬†

As I lit the match, my friends outside began to vanish with the morning sun, but that was okay, I would be with them soon. I dropped the match to the floor and closed my eyes for the last time. I was ready to find my new skin, my new eyes, and become what I was truly meant to be.",3,1734293576.0,nosleep,0,0.72,False
