I’m looking for someone to wander with, through museums and galleries, cozy cafes and hidden bars; someone who feels the same pull to explore the quiet corners and vibrant pockets of New York during its frostier months.

I’m a lifelong learner and a writer with a knack for turning aimless walks into adventures, for finding meaning in a piece of abstract art or in a perfectly crafted cocktail. My days are spent between work and words, and my nights are often given to the kind of wandering that makes you fall in love with this city over and over again. I savor long conversations about books and ideas, the kind of talks that stretch late into the evening, lingering like the last sip of something strong.

If you’re someone who finds joy in curiosity and good company, who’s equally happy getting lost in the Met or dissecting the menu of a new speakeasy, then let’s find some inspiration together. Whether it’s a chance meeting over coffee or a day spent gallery hopping, I’d love to share this city with someone who knows how to savor the little things that make it feel infinite.

I have read a lot of cozy books written by Japanese authors like; Morisaki bookshop, traveling cat chronicles, before the coffee gets cold (and the rest of the series), what are you looking for is in the library, guest cat, etc. I am kind of not interested in those at this time as I feel even though they are cozy they have a tinge of sadness in all of them.

Picture this: you’ve just sent a Bitcoin transaction, and you’re riding high on the crypto wave. But then… nothing. Your transaction is stuck in the mempool, languishing like an unread email in an ex's inbox. Panic starts to set in.

# The Mempool Maze: Why Transactions Get Stuck

To understand why Bitcoin TX Accelerate is a game-changer, let’s talk about the dreaded mempool. Think of it as a waiting room for Bitcoin transactions. When you hit ""send"" on your wallet, your transaction joins a queue where miners pick and choose which ones to confirm. The ones with higher fees? They get the VIP treatment. The rest? Well, they’re left to loiter.

The problem arises when the mempool gets overcrowded. Imagine rush hour traffic, but instead of honking horns, there are frustrated Bitcoiners staring at their wallets. That’s where Bitcoin TX Accelerate comes in.

# Meet Bitcoin TX Accelerate: Your Speed Boost Button

It’s like teleporting your transaction from point A to point B—instant crypto karma.

You’ve set a low transaction fee—maybe you were trying to save some Satoshis, or maybe it was an accident. Whatever the case, your transaction is stuck. Bitcoin TX Accelerate swoops in to rescue your Satoshis from the slow lane.

# How Bitcoin TX Accelerate Works

Using Bitcoin TX Accelerate is as simple as ordering coffee (minus the confusing latte art). Here’s how it works:

1. **Submit Your Transaction**: Enter your stuck transaction’s details, including the transaction ID (TXID). If you’re unsure where to find it, your wallet has you covered.

**Original Post:** [http://www.authorbettyadams.com/bettys-blog/humans-are-weird-thinking-pants](http://www.authorbettyadams.com/bettys-blog/humans-are-weird-thinking-pants) 

Commander Pulp woke from a delicious dream of eating a giant loaf of the richest bread when the steady thumping of a distant mill grew discordant. As the layers of haze cleared from his mind he realized that the sound was not a part of the dream at all, but came from outside his sleeping chamber. He reached over to nudge his sleep companion, only to find empty space and heaved a sigh. On such a thinly operated base it was no surprise that it was a struggle to find sleeping companions with truly compatible schedules, but it was still annoying to fall asleep with a comforting presence by your side only to wake up cold and alone. Commander Pulp gave a leisurely stretch and scented the air. The clock was filling the air with the first scents of dew, and none of the harsher volatiles that would wake him, so he didn’t technically have to be up for some time. He might try to get back to sleep and finish that dream loaf.

However he did feel fully rested and that odd thumping was going on outside his door, so he let himself slither off of his sleeping rock and onto the cool floor. The change in temperature on his paws sent a shiver through his scutes and he held his belly off the floor as he moved to the bathroom and began scrubbing his scales over the wall mounted brushes. A little detail work on his claws and snout and he felt himself ready to face whatever the early morning might bring. He exited his door and followed the thumping to the main corridor where the three humans currently assigned to the base were carrying massive bags of grain towards the main lab, and empty bags away. They seemed focused, expect for the new female, one Private Johnson, who was wearing clothing that was far too lose to be safe around machinery, and was moving with less coordination than the other two indicating that she had been roused from sleep for whatever emergency required the oddly timed loading of the grain.

Commander Pulp considered going to the lab to see what was wrong, it could not be anything too serious or he would have been deliberately woken, but decided that the current crew looked like they had it under their talon, and furthermore that he had no desire to cross the paths of the giant lumbering mammals carrying their mass in dead weight. So he scooted along the wall until he reached his office and pulled up a display. The lab in question had initiated a request for a test run of the new grinding system, however instead a test run being recorded, a full run had been. This had been followed by an emergency request for human support, to which all three humans had responded promptly. The grinder was now running an experimental load set to the smallest pre-determined load size.

Commander Pulp gave a yawn and made note to investigate the rather disturbing fact that the new grinding system could not, or at least could not easily and intuitively be shut off once initiated, a serious failure that needed to be addressed, in its due time, and settled down to watch the chaos with mild interest. He reached into a drawer for his special loaf stash, a bit of a let-down after that dream-loaf, and began chewing placidly. The grinder finished it’s predetermined cycle and the thumping from the corridor slowed down and stopped. The request for aid was canceled and Commander Pulp trotted out to observe the humans, mildly curious as to how they would handle this tail-tip of an emergency.

Grimes and the other human who had presumably been awake on night shift were standing together chatting lightly about end of shift duties and potentially getting a hot drink together when the other human, still in her too-loose for work clothing came out of the lab with a large yawn, holding a final empty grain sack loosely in one hand.

“Johnson!” Grimes called out cheerfully, “what to join us for some knock-off coffee like product?”

The female human stared blankly at the other two for such a long time that they began to shift uncomfortably, before she vigorously shook her head and gave another gaping yawn. Commander Pulp firmly tapped down the thought that humans were so cute when they gave their tiny yawns with their little mouths. Experience with Grimes had taught him that that was not an appreciated sentiment.

“Can’t do brain things in sleep pants,” Johnson muttered, rubbing her eyes. “Ask when the thinking pants are on.”

With that cryptic remark she turned and began to tramp back towards her quarters, presumably to find and put on her ‘thinking pants’ while the other two human laughed in amusement.

Commander Pulp darted forward eagerly to catch Grimes’s attention before he turned his mind back to his previous conversation.

“Commander,” Grimes greeted him with a tired smile. “Bit of a fracas this morning.”

“Yes, yes,” Commander Pulp agreed. “Tell me Grimes, I just overheard a bit of your conversation with Private Johnson, did she just imply that her thought processes are impacted by what clothing she wears?”

Grimes blinked in surprise and then nodded.

“You know this one though,” he said.

“I assure you,” Commander Pulp said, rocking back on his hind legs to make sure Grimes was aware of having his full attention, “I have never heard of thinking pants.”

“That is just Johnson’s special form of it,” Grimes said with a dismissive wave of a long hand. “You know how you guys can sleep anywhere really, but you prefer a nice rock nest, and a sleeping companion, and a blanket or two when it’s cold?”

Commander Pulp considered this and then bobbed his snout in a human ‘nod’.

“You are referring to the psychological benefits of crafting an ideal nest to sleep in,” he said.

Grimes and the other night shift human nodded in tandem, both smiling.

“For some humans the special clothes are a terribly important part of the nest,” Grimes explained. “Johnson, I am assuming from what I say, mind I never actually discussed this with her, uses very loose, soft natural-fiber weaves for her, let’s call them nest clothes, so these prime her brain for a sleep cycle. Then the coarser, tighter clothes of her uniform for instance prime her brain for thinking and working.”

“So in order to answer you question she needs her thinking pants,” Commander Pulp said. “Fascinating, to wear a part of one’s sleeping nest on your body.”

“Yup,” the other human said with a yawn. “Ya’ know what though Grimes? I think I’m gonna change my mind about that cup of fake coffee and go to my sleeping nest. This was a beauty of a topper for a long shift and I think I’ll go to bed early.”

“Do you too wear sleeping pants?” Commander Pulp asked.

The human laughed and shook his head.

“Don’t wear no pants for sleep,” he said, “like you lizard folk I prefer to keep my nest in one place and not wear it around on me. Night.”

With that the human turned and wandered off. Commander Pulp turned to Grimes with interest.

“I used to sleep nude,” Grimes informed him, seeming to intuit his question. “But aliens with scales and claws kept climbing into my bed at all hours so I switched to long pajamas.”

“That happened once,” Commander Pulp said with an annoyed huff.

Grimes rolled his eyes in that disconcerting way humans had.

“Once with you,” he corrected.

The floor began to vibrate with the approach of Johnson, presumably in her ‘thinking pants’ and Commander Pulp turned his attention from the now rather annoying conversation to determine what the practical difference was between the two clothing types.

We just purchased a Simpure T1-400 ALK system, which produces Alkaline water, and I’m wondering about using it with my Rocket machine. Previously I was using distilled water with third wave packets, but the taste was still a bit inferior to my old Breville Dual Boiler with fridge-filtered tap water. I tried adding a small amount of RO water to the Rocket (without any other water) and I think the taste is definitely better but still not as good as the tap water on the dual boiler. I think the fridge-filtered tap water produces coffee that has a smoother, richer flavour. Just wanted to ask about why this could be- and if anyone else is using RO water with their machine. If so, do you add anything extra or are you happy with the flavour?

I been on and off drinking spearmint tea for a bit *but* I always see a massive change in my hirsutism (slows down a lot!) when doing it consistently. 

*Anyway,* I’ve haven’t had it for a solid two months and my latest period has been real *f•cking* pain in the ass where I swear it’s been consistently 2 months. I didn’t track it but my last doctor appointment I had my period and I saw her on 12/4. I will track my next period because this felt like the longest ever then usual and I want information to give my doctor correctly. But overall, it was a consistent period — light, maybe a week of heavy periods, back to light and sometimes spotting, etc. I just wanted to be done though. 

So, I started drinking spearmint tea regularly to cut out coffee as I’m having stomach problems with the caffeine and also non dairy creamer. It’s been about a week & a half and I see the difference in growth in my hirsutism but today, my period has been ***VERY*** spotty, almost nonexistent. I think the worst is over 🤞

Has anyone else experience it regulating it and making it be more timely? I really want my period to not last so long. I do have an upcoming doctor appointment in March and I plan to chat with her because before that I had no period for like 2 months and now I’m being cursed with a consistent period that never goes away.

1ibicgz,https://www.reddit.com/r/exmormon/comments/1ibicgz/wife_spent_the_night_in_jail/,Wife spent the night in jail,"So - a few of you may have seen some of my previous posts highlighting the difficulties of my mixed faith marriage over the last 5 years since I 'came out' to my wife. Sadly, things turned for the worst over the weekend. Friday afternoon she saw my phone open to my reddit feed which includes faithful and non-faithful subs and other areas of interest. She was immediately triggered seeing some of the negative headlines and told me how uncomfortable all of that is for her. In short, she feels that I am choosing my obsession of church history/negative perspectives over her. My response is that I did not have a marriage crisis but rather a faith crisis. Reading reddit, going to lunch with new exmo friends is my way of processing and dealing with a very traumatic loss of faith - something TBM me would have never imagined. Yet, as many of you know, here we are. 

Her discomfort turned into some heated exchanges. I simply held my position that mutual respect for each other and some autonomy is the best way forward. I respect her beliefs and don't criticize her for attending the temple or spending hours and hours on her calling. I even attend church with her to try and give her some support. But, her inability to give me space to 'look at reddit' etc. feels very one sided and that she is trying to shot down some of my own relief valves for processing. I would never ask her to stop reading her scriptures or skip church.

Saturday night, we went to a nice restaurant to have dinner. The conversation reignited and before the appetizer hit the table, she had fled the restaurant, grabbed an Uber, and went home. 

I quickly followed suite, went home and didn't speak to her for \~18 hours. We went to church together the next day and didn't speak. I was waiting for her to say something. Nothing.

Finally, around 3pm Sunday, I ask if we're going to talk about it. I continued to hold my position of the need for mutual respect. Things escalated and she soon started moving out of our master bedroom to a spare bedroom amidst arguing her case that ""you're choosing your obsession over me"" and ""I don't respect your beliefs"" etc. 

TW: Domestic abuse...

Finally, at one point in the argument, she came at me and started swinging. I'm 6'2"" 215 lbs and easily blocked the few blows she threw. It was minor. But, it was the fourth time she's been physical with me. This time, I decided to call the police. 

I didn't realize the hornet's nest I kicked over. The police saw the evidence (it was on my security camera) and almost immediately put her in handcuffs and took her to jail. She spent last night in jail. My wife of decades together and multiple kids/grandkids spent the night in jail and I have been feeling horrible for all of that. 

I spoke to my therapist and a good friend who both believed I did the right thing. (The therapist has personally seen situations where getting physical can escalate to getting physical with a weapon/knife and has seen death as a result.) Fortunately, as a first time offender, she was eligible for a divergence program (basically some classes/therapy) and the charges will ultimately be dropped after 18 months. 

She came home from jail this morning, grabbed some of her stuff, and is staying with her family. 

I love this woman deeply - so please be sensitive to that with your comments. And, when church isn't in the way, things are GREAT. But, just like RMN ""checking in to see if we're thinking celestial"", the church is constantly in the middle of my marriage. It honestly makes me hate the institution. It has driven her into a cult mindset where ultimatums have been given on garments, what I can read, who I can be friends with, coffee, going to church etc. For a church that allegedly espouses free agency, its teaching often push members to do the opposite. 

Anyway - I'm writing to vent. I haven't told my family or hers out of respect for her privacy so reddit is one of my few outlets. And, frankly, you folks have been there for me in small but meaningful ways. I'm horribly sad, frustrated, and feeling a bit lost at the moment.

Now I found it again!,"I love hearing stories about other peoples' experiences with this game, so I guess I'll share mine. (Feel free to share yours in the comments)

I love Animal Crossing. I played the original on Gamecube. I got Wild World and loved it, too. I missed City Folk because we didn't have a Wii but I jumped at getting New Leaf.

Sadly, I thought I'd permanently lost my 3DS and all my games after a chaotic move about 11 years ago. I was heartbroken. I missed New Leaf the most. I enjoyed about 4 glorious months of working on my little town, lost it, and then missed it terribly.

I know it's silly, but there was almost an ""I'll never love again..."" feeling about it.

I got into PC games after that and I'm yet to get a Switch. I looked on wistfully when New Horizons came out, but by then I had my modded up Sims games to get through Covid with.

Then, a few months ago, I was unpacking some old boxes and I found it!

So here's what falling in love with this gem all over again has been like.

It's clear that I missed so much of this game. It's still new for me. I had never gotten to experience winter or spring. I love the winter music when it snows, the silver bells make my favorite AC soundtrack so magical. I got to do Toy Day for Christmas and nailed it. 

I had no idea how deep the upgrades went; I either never knew or I'd forgotten. In the past few months I got the final Nook store upgrade, the Gracie Gracie shop, the museum expansion and very recently, The Roost. I can't wait to play barista, but haven't drunk enough coffee yet.

I had no idea about the Welcome Amiibo update. It was a big surprise.

At first, I thought it was just a side thing for the amiibo cards. Nope. It added so much more and I love it. The MEOW coupons quests add some nice daily direction.

I'm keep laughing at seeing snippets of my 20 something self. The letters I've been shown by my favorite neighbors reveal the storyline of an obsessed mayor, who both adores and threatens her adorable neighbors.

Example:

*Dear Bunnie,
I always wanted a bunny as my buddy. Will you be my best friend? Your answer will determine how many fingers you will wake up with. Just kidding. (Actually serious)* ]:( 

Then there's the storyline between my Mayor and the second character, her crazy uncle Junkpan. I made her uncle in the game to keep all the items that are cool and interesting but doesn't fit her home's aesthetic. He lives in a broken down shack, surrounded by warning signs. Inside the shack it looks like the home of a conspiracy driven survivalist.

There is even an old collection of letters between Junkpan and the Mayor saved at the post office. My mayor is just trying to reason with her uncle Junkpan about his out of control bees. Junkpan sends back angry letters about the ""GUV'MINT"" trying to take away his bees. He accuses her of being the reason villagers move away, or in his mind, have been ""disappeared.""

Recently, Junkpan has put together his curated museum display of weird and wacky items that he calls ""THE TRUTH!!!""

I made a new character, cousin Flora, to focus on seasonal collections. Each room of her home will showcase a different season. She's also joining in on the crazy uncle Junkpan narrative as a desperate mediator. I'm having so much fun with my own silliness. 

I've been playing New Leaf daily now. I'm so happy with it. I'd never lost interest in the game and now it's back. This game unfolds its joys to the player slowly, so I'm still finding new stuff. I can't wait to get the Fortune Teller shop next.

I'm a bit sad that I never got to enjoy the Dream Suite. I built it but I can do nothing with it other than to look at it. I missed it's time and the chance to meet up with other players through Swapnote, but at least these aren't game ruining losses.

1ibi9x9,https://www.reddit.com/r/Paranormal/comments/1ibi9x9/an_experience_on_mushrooms/,An experience on mushrooms,"Hello everyone.

I think that after a few years, it's time to write down my only paranormal experience that I have not been able to explain away by some simple thinking. Back in highschool I used to have this friend called Morrison. He was this ADHD blonde kid with glasses that smoked weed and occasionally did LSD or other psychedelics. One day our school was canceled, and so as the stupid teenagers we were, we went to a coffee shop and he bought us this container of (Atlantis? I think is what the shrooms were called). This was my first time taking psychedelics, so I didn't know how risky it would be to take them in the big city. We ate them, they are super bitter but I chew and swallow, and we do groceries to have something to eat while tripping, and after a while it starts kicking in.

Sounds get distorted slightly, the floor tiles become slightly wavy and tree bark creeps it's way up to the sky like a river. Eventually we get very tired of walking while tripping and so we settle down on this park bench near the museum, taking in the sights the sounds and the smells, both in our own little worlds. 

As we sit there, this elderly couple comes walking up to us on the gravel path. It's a black couple, both looking above their eighties, and one of them has a cane to support them. As they pass us, the woman stops and waves, asking for our names and giving us a big smile. She looks like any typical black granny, white curls, eyes are a little bloodshot but she looks friendly and wise.

As the conversation continues, my friend and I are kind of glued to the bench, we are tripping and trying our very best not to seem suspicious, all we can do is stay put and answer her questions. She slowly starts to make weird comments, and reaches out to hold my hands, she starts telling me specifically that my name is not Isa, but [I forgot, some biblical name] and that I am an angel, and Morrison is my holy helper. She tells me which school I need to go to, that I have healing powers, that we will meet again in the future, that she can see great things in me as an angel, and all the while her husband is in the back nodding and smiling, repeating ""she's special!"" ""She's special!"" As if to say that he knows his wife is special, that she can read people. She gets uncomfortably close to my face, we really couldn't tell if she was real, if she knew we were tripping, we were stuck in confusion and fear...

After what feels like literal hours, they leave, giving us one last smile. Both of us sat petrified for what felt for another hour before both of us scurried to our bikes, rode them home and parted ways without saying a single word. 

This encounter felt so unreal and magical, comforting yet terrifying, that it was hard to believe it really happened... But then again the dose we took (20mg) was relatively average and besides small visual hallucinations it shouldn't have done anything, not hallucinate an entire goddamn couple. And both me and my friend saw this. She has literally been stuck in my mind for all these years, this encounter, I don't talk to Morrison anymore for three years now. So I guess it's a bit of a relief  that I can finally share it here.

In the recently-posted reels from Jenna's IG, there were a number of shares she posted that had to do with D/s. Between the Mommy fetish that Mils has, the stuffed bear stuff, etc., I'm getting BDSM vibes from this relationship. Jenna as Mistress, Mils as sub.

Nothing wrong with anyone's kink, except that poor Mils is sounding more and more emotionally fucked up than first presented. Fortunately, the idea of Jenna as a cruel, controlling Domme is kind of a joke. She's a (very bad) actress, yes, but the idea of her being the boss in this duo makes me think of David Hasselhoff that time he was drunk on the floor, trying to eat a sandwich, and just slobbering chewed burger all over the place.

We all know that Jenna's facade is ridiculous, but Mils seemed to have her shit kind of together. In the beginning. Now it's kind of falling away, and I think she and Jenna might make the perfect couple. Perhaps less than average intelligence + emotional dysfunction = Ms & ms Happy Home.

Also, I can't get beyond that projector thing looking like a garage door opener. I keep thinking they're living in a garage that's been converted to a man cave with neon beer signs, then converted into a teenage bear cave for Mils' teddy bear picnic. Occupied by a middle ager and an AARP member.

We met a few months ago, and things started painfully slow. We’d only see each other every 2–3 weeks, and her texting was so inconsistent that I straight-up asked if she even wanted to date. Importance context: she is from Bolivia and is on a student-visa while fully supporting herself and living alone in the country. So genuinely, it just seemed she didnt have the bandwidth. She reassured me, however, that while she was scared she wanted to see me, so I gave it time.

Then, quite suddenly, things shifted. Around the Xmas holidays (late December), she went from barely communicating to full-on love mode. She invited me to her place for the first time for New Years Eve, and after she was texting and calling more, saying she was available for me whenever I wanted, and even met my sister and nephews (she asked to meet them several times). The last 3 weeks felt incredible. I really started falling for her, and when I brought up making things official, she seemed open to it.

But just a week later, everything flipped.

This past Tuesday, she told me she was overwhelmed and needed to slow things down. She said it wasn’t because she didn’t like me (she emphasized that she really does), but because her life is “too much” right now. She’s in school full-time next month and *has* to graduate this semester or she’ll lose her visa and have to leave the country. She’s also working to support herself and still processing a 3-year relationship that ended 8 months ago.

She said she wanted to keep dating and stay exclusive but wasn’t ready to be my girlfriend. I told her I’d try to respect her need for space and let things flow, but honestly? I felt rejected. I started to feel the whiplash—going from being unsure if she was even into me, to her being all-in, to her now saying she needs to pull back.

We had plans for Friday, but she canceled and asked to meet Saturday. Then, on Saturday, she ended it. Over text.

She said she couldn’t handle the intensity of a relationship right now and didn’t want to commit to anyone. She made it clear in the text we’re done, and that she'd like to meet in person to answer any questions and discuss it in-person.

I was shocked and agreed (without any attempt to change her mind) to meet the next morning over coffee as she suggested, and she agreed. That was supposed to be yesterday but since then, she’s canceled or pushed it off multiple times because she is sick and throwing up (this seems legit, she sent voice notes and pics and she looks/sounds awful). 

I know its over. It *hurts* so bad - and the slow to hot to over has really fucked my mind and heart up. I really fell for her. I thought this was going somewhere. I let her in—introduced her to my family, shared my hopes, and tried to build something real. And now it’s over. Just like that. Over text. 

I don’t know what to make of it. Did I read this all wrong? Did she not like me like she said she did? Deep down, did she feel I wasn't the right guy? Or was it truly bad timing and too much going on in her life? I want to believe the connection was real, but the way it ended feels so abrupt and cold. I'm devastated. 

How do you move on from something like this? How do you let go of someone you still care about, even if the timing—or the relationship—wasn’t right?

So, I’ve been seeing this guy for a while, and we’ve been talking nonstop since December 19. He is part of our friend group for w while now, me my sister, him and another male friend. We’ve texted every day and night, never taking a break, and things were amazing. He’s sweet, playful, and we’ve grown really close. We even have this cute ritual where every Saturday, he sends me a baby devil sticker to keep me company while I sleep.

Our connection feels so natural. I’ve been in three relationships before and been on plenty of dates, but this time I felt like I had to lead things a bit. For example, on our first date which was this Friday(he asked me out for a coffee) I initiated the kiss. Let’s just say it was not our first kiss, we have kissed 3 weeks before after a party we went on together as a group. After the coffee we were taking a selfie, and he hugged me while holding the phone. We stayed like that for a moment, and I kissed his cheek, which turned into us making out. It was such a sweet, genuine moment, and I really thought we were on the same page. After that we met with the group and stayed out
till 3am. I was his first kiss, he hasn’t told me that directly but our friend has mentioned that in the past.

We’ve been flirty too. He’s mentioned before that he’d like to sleep with me, and I know there’s attraction. But suddenly, over the weekend, the morning after the date, his vibe has completely changed. He’s distant, not as playful, and doesn’t update me as much as he used to. I still text him, and he responds, but something feels off. His replies are dry and slow.

Yesterday it kinda got to a topic where his said he is overthinking and i asked if i can help. He just said it’s “his problems” that he must deal on his own but that he is thankful.

He still calls me “lil turtle” (a nickname he gave me that melts my heart) and said goodnight with a kiss emoji last night, but I don’t know if he’s just going through something or if he’s losing interest. I keep replaying everything in my head, wondering if I did something wrong, but I can’t pinpoint anything.

I hate not knowing where I stand. I’m 22, he’s 23, and I feel like we should be able to communicate, not play hot and cold like teenagers. If he’s overthinking something unrelated to me, why not just tell me? Instead, I’m left in the dark, frustrated and questioning everything.

I told myself I’ll give it until Wednesday to see if this weirdness passes, but I can’t keep acting like this doesn’t bother me. I like him a lot—I even daydream about us together—but I’ve been in situations like this before. If this behavior continues, I’ll lose interest. I know my worth, and I’m not going to be strung along.

What do you think is going on? Is he pulling away because he’s scared, dealing with personal stuff, or is he just not interested anymore? Should I bring it up directly, or just mirror his energy until he figures it out? I don’t want to come off as desperate, but I also hate feeling like this.

Having lots of relationship history with intimacy. Personally I don't have ANY intimacy experience on purpose and I don't want someone with LOTS of experience/relationship history. Also if you broke up recently that's also a big no for me. No one is an aid band duh.

I'm from Turkey and my ethnicity is Caucasian.

My personality type is INFP-A , I don't believe horoscopes or to any religion.

I'm a Concept/2D Artist. I draw character designs, potraits, any stuff I like.

I'm loyal, empathetic, protective, dependable and love to share every thought I have with my partner and also expect the same thing.

I love melancholy in general, I have couple of sad song playlists on Spotify.

My main hobbies are drawing, powerlifting and gaming. I also do some other stuff like playing electric guitar sometimes but who cares.

I like getting and giving attention in equal terms.

1ibi2to,https://www.reddit.com/r/SpecialtyCoffee/comments/1ibi2to/taking_the_helm_of_a_specialty_coffee_farm/,Taking the helm of a Specialty Coffee farm,"**Hello Readers,**

My family owns a specialty coffee farm, and I’m finishing my undergraduate studies this year. As I look ahead, I have ideas on how I want to scale and protect the farm—especially with global climate studies predicting that by 2050, coffee farms will face significant challenges due to shifting weather patterns.

Beyond farming, I’m working on launching a **roasted coffee bean brand** to create additional income for the farmers who hand-pick the cherries and to help combat the expenses and debt they take on during harvest season. My vision goes beyond just roasting and distributing beans—I want to build something deeper.

I also aim to **partner with coffee roasters worldwide** to:

1. Quickly immerse myself in the specialty coffee industry.
2. Push our beans—both green and roasted—into the global market (they already are, but now its my job to get them into the markets from scratch in order to ""prove myself"" as my family says.)
3. Connect with people, because I genuinely love people, and I know I can build something meaningful that brings others forward with me.

Sure, I could start a simple roasting and distribution business, but I want to **do more**. Right now, I feel like I’m just sitting in the ocean, but I’m ready to move.

The closest story I’ve come across in the coffee space is the owner of Kahawa Coffee, though I don’t yet know much about their product or sourcing.

For context, my farm produces **specialty coffee with cupping scores as high as 94**, offering **Grade 1, 2, and 3 beans** (AA-UG), grown at elevations of **1,700–2,100 MASL**.

Early 20s, have all my expenses paid for, a trust, a house to live in etc. We aren't wealthy but the whole point of my parents working hard and saving was so I don't need to stress about these things. 

But all I think about is how to cheapskate to the maximum, how to optimize investments, how to work more on the side. Recently secured a well paying first job, and I immediately just start thinking how I could do better. 

Buying anything feels like a scam!

Why go to a bar when booze is 10x upmarked? Might as well go to a reataurant. But why go to a restaurant? I could just grab a Subway. Why grab a subway? I can just buy the groceries. (Why buy the groceries? 🫠)

The only time I end up going out is a weekly coffee date. And even then I dont enjoy it much because I feel scammed. 

I study and I still work on the side for no reason like I'm doing nothing with the money.  I save a lot but the more I have the less it feels.

Part 4,"When they finally arrived back at the house, Nuria parked the car in the driveway and turned off the engine. Tim sighed, his feet throbbing from being crammed into the too-small shoes Nuria had insisted he wear. He glanced at her, hoping she wouldn’t notice his discomfort, but of course, she did.

As they stepped out of the car, Nuria leaned casually against the door, lighting a cigarette. She gave him a knowing look. “What’s wrong, Timmy? You look like you’re about to keel over.”

Tim hesitated, rubbing the back of his neck. “It’s the shoes. They’re, uh... not exactly my size.”

Nuria tilted her head, smirking. “Not your size? But they look so cute on you.” She flicked her cigarette to the ground and stepped on it. “Tell you what—you can take them off… after you’ve unloaded the car. Every single bag and box. Deal?”

Tim sighed, already knowing he didn’t have much of a choice. “Fine,” he muttered.

He trudged to the back of the car and popped open the trunk. There was a surprising amount of luggage, given that Nuria had claimed she’d already thrown out some of her old clothes. He started hauling everything out, piece by piece, feeling the pinch of the shoes with every step.

As he carried the final two bags toward the house, Nuria appeared in the doorway, leaning against the frame with her arms crossed.

“Oh, Timmy,” she said sweetly, though her tone carried a hint of mockery. “You don’t mind showing me to my room, do you? I want to see where I’ll be staying.”

Tim hesitated. “Can I at least change into my regular shoes first? These are killing me.”

Nuria’s expression hardened, and she fixed him with a pointed stare. “Timmy. Did I say you could take them off yet?”

Tim gulped, quickly shaking his head. “No, no, you didn’t.”

“Good,” she said, her voice softening into a syrupy tone again. “Then keep them on. They suit you.” She flashed him a sly, almost teasing smile and gestured for him to follow her.

“After you,” she said, motioning toward the stairs.

Tim led her up the staircase, carrying the last of her bags. His feet screamed in protest with every step, but he forced himself to push through. Once they reached the guest room, he nudged the door open with his shoulder and set the bags down.

Nuria stepped inside, glancing around with a critical eye. The room was neat and simple—a single bed, a wardrobe, and a small desk by the window. She wrinkled her nose.

“Well,” she said slowly, dragging the word out. “It’s... sufficient. For now.”

Tim couldn’t hide the slight frown on his face. “I did my best to keep it clean.”

She walked over to the bed and sat down, testing the mattress with her hand. Then she pulled a face of mild disgust. “How long have these sheets been on here?”

Tim blinked. “Uh... I don’t know. They’re clean, I promise. Maybe a week or three?”

Nuria raised an eyebrow, her lips curling into a smirk. “Three weeks, Timmy? That’s not clean. That’s embarrassing.” She crossed her legs and pointed at the bed. “Take these off and put fresh ones on. Now.”

Tim hesitated. “Fresh sheets?”

She tilted her head, her smile sharp. “Do I need to repeat myself?”

“No, I’ll do it,” he said quickly, moving to strip the bed. He could feel her eyes on him as he worked, her presence heavy in the room.

Once the new sheets were on, Nuria laid back against the pillows, making herself comfortable. She glanced over at Tim, who was still standing awkwardly by the door.

“You know,” she said, tapping her chin thoughtfully, “you should probably put my clothes away too. That way, you’ll know where everything goes when you’re done washing and ironing them.”

Tim blinked, taken aback. “Washing and ironing?”

Nuria nodded, smiling sweetly. “Of course. That’s part of the job, isn’t it? Or would you rather I handle it myself? That might be risky, Timmy. You don’t want me to ruin my designer pieces, do you?”

Tim opened his mouth to protest but stopped himself. He knew better by now.

Nuria’s smile widened as she watched him quietly move toward the wardrobe. “Good boy,” she said with a little nod. “You’re learning.”

He started unpacking her bags, carefully hanging her clothes in the wardrobe and placing her shoes neatly on the bottom shelf. His feet throbbed painfully, but he didn’t dare complain.

When he was finally finished, he straightened up and wiped his forehead. Nuria sat up, inspecting his work with a satisfied expression.

“Not bad,” she said. “You’ll get better with practice.”

Tim sighed, his patience wearing thin. “Is there anything else you need?”

Nuria stood up, stretching dramatically. “Actually, yes. It’s been a long day, and I’m starving. Let’s order something to eat.”

Tim’s shoulders sagged in relief. “Great. What do you feel like?”

She grinned, a mischievous glint in her eye. “Oh, I’ll decide. You’re paying, of course.”

Tim bit back a groan. “Of course I am,” he muttered under his breath.

When Nuria announced she was in the mood for pizza, Tim felt a flicker of relief. Maybe, just maybe, things would settle down now. She tilted her head toward him from her spot on the couch, one leg draped lazily over the armrest.

“What do you want, Timmy?” she asked, scrolling through her phone to find the nearest pizzeria.

“Uh, I’ll have a Hawaiian,” Tim said, sitting upright on the edge of the sofa. “Oh, and, uh… no mushrooms, please.”

Nuria gave him a sharp nod, her lips curling into a small smile. “No mushrooms. Got it.”

Tim felt an odd sense of hope. For the first time all day, she seemed agreeable, even polite. Maybe this wouldn’t be as bad as he thought. He relaxed a little, leaning back as she called the pizzeria.

Nuria’s conversation with the pizzeria was smooth and efficient. She rattled off the address and her order. When she hung up, she walked over and gave Tim a friendly look. “It’ll be here in an hour,” she said lightly, and for a moment, her tone wasn’t condescending or sharp—it was almost… pleasant.

Tim smiled faintly and settled into the couch, flipping through channels on the TV. He stopped at an action-packed series, something with superheroes and explosions—exactly his type of show. Just as he was getting into it, Nuria appeared in the doorway, her arms crossed, watching the screen.

She sighed dramatically. “Really, Timmy? This is what you watch? No way.”

Before he could respond, she grabbed the remote from the coffee table and switched the channel to a romantic comedy. “There,” she said, plopping down next to him. “Something we can both enjoy.”

Tim bit his tongue and decided to let it slide. It wasn’t worth the fight.

Nuria stretched her arms over her head and sighed again, this time with exaggerated satisfaction. “You know what would go great with this? A glass of wine. Be a dear and grab me one, will you?”

Tim hesitated for a moment, but then got up and went to the kitchen. When he returned with a glass of wine, Nuria was sprawled out across the couch, looking far too comfortable. She glanced down at his feet and let out a soft laugh.

“Well, well,” she said, pointing. “Looks like someone decided to ditch my shoes.”

Tim glanced down at his feet, now bare, and shrugged awkwardly. “They were too small. My toes were killing me.”

Nuria grinned wickedly, sitting up straighter. “Too small, huh? And yet, you wore them all day. That’s called dedication, Timmy.” She smirked, her tone dripping with mock appreciation.

Tim sat down carefully at the far end of the couch, trying to ignore her.

But Nuria wasn’t finished. “You know,” she said, her voice playful, “when someone lends you something, it’s polite to thank them.”

Tim blinked, confused. “I already said thanks.”

“Not to me,” Nuria said, shaking her head with a teasing glint in her eyes. “To my feet. After all, they’re the reason you had the shoes in the first place.”

Tim stared at her, unsure if she was joking or serious. There was an icy silence as Nuria sat there, her smile unwavering.

Finally, Tim sighed. “Thanks,” he muttered, barely audible.

Nuria leaned forward, cupping her ear dramatically. “What was that? My feet didn’t hear you, Timmy. Maybe you should get closer. You know, make it more personal.”

Tim’s jaw clenched. “This is ridiculous,” he said flatly.

Nuria’s smile faded slightly, replaced by a sharp, authoritative look. “Timmy,” she said, her voice low and calm, “you remember that this is a trial period, right? Six months. I want to feel comfortable here. And you… you can make that happen. Or not. It’s your choice.”

Her words hung in the air like a veiled threat.

Reluctantly, Tim slid off the couch and knelt near her feet. His face burned with embarrassment as he looked up at her. Nuria’s eyes sparkled with amusement as she leaned back, clearly enjoying herself.

“Go on,” she said softly.

Tim cleared his throat and, with all the enthusiasm of someone being forced into a chore, said, “Thank you.. feet”

Nuria let out a laugh, her head falling back. “That’s more like it,” she said cheerfully. Then, with a playful glint in her eye, she lifted her left foot and lightly tapped his nose with it. “You’re welcome, Timmy.”

Tim stood up quickly, brushing himself off, and sat back down on the far end of the couch, his face red. Nuria sipped her wine, looking utterly pleased with herself.

They watched the romantic comedy in silence for a while, though Tim wasn’t paying much attention. He was too busy staring at the clock, counting down the minutes until the pizza would arrive.

Finally, the doorbell rang.

Tim jumped up, eager for a break from the awkwardness. “I’ll get it,” he said quickly.

As he headed for the door, Nuria called out behind him. “Don’t forget to tip the delivery guy!”

Tim rolled his eyes but didn’t respond. He opened the door, and there stood the pizza delivery man, holding several boxes.

“Here you go,” the delivery man said cheerfully.

Tim handed over the cash, including a generous tip, and took the boxes. As he turned to carry them inside, he wondered what fresh chaos Nuria had planned next.

 

Tim opened the first pizza box and was greeted by the sight of a steaming pepperoni pizza. Without hesitation, he handed it to Nuria, who accepted it with a smirk and immediately took a slice.

But when he opened the second box, his face fell. The pizza inside was Hawaiian—his favorite—but it was piled high with mushrooms. So many mushrooms, in fact, that they seemed to spill off the pizza like an avalanche of unwanted toppings.

Tim stared at it in disbelief. “What... What is this?” he muttered, looking at the pizza and then back at Nuria.

She took a bite of her pepperoni slice, leaning back casually. “What does it look like? It’s your pizza. Eat up.”

Tim furrowed his brow. “I asked for no mushrooms. I told you no mushrooms!” His voice was tinged with both confusion and frustration.

Nuria shrugged, licking a bit of sauce from her fingers. “Oh, stop whining. You’re not a kid. Just eat it.”

Tim hesitated, staring at the offensive pizza. “But I don’t like mushrooms,” he said quietly, his tone almost defeated.

Rolling her eyes, Nuria leaned forward, grabbed a slice of his pizza, and held it up to his face. “You’ll survive. Open up.”

“No, really, I’m not hungry anymore—” Tim started, but before he could finish, she pushed the slice into his mouth.

“Chew,” Nuria commanded, her gaze steady and unyielding.

Tim reluctantly bit into the slice, grimacing at the taste of the mushrooms. He chewed slowly, his face a mix of discomfort and resignation. Nuria watched him intently, her expression smug, until he swallowed.

“See? That wasn’t so bad,” she said with a laugh, taking another bite of her own pizza.

Tim placed the box on the table and pushed it away. “I’ve lost my appetite,” he murmured.

Nuria didn’t seem to care. She leaned back comfortably, savoring her pizza, occasionally glancing at her phone. After a couple of minutes, she sighed dramatically. “Well, this is boring,” she announced.

Without waiting for a response, she picked up her phone and dialed. “Let’s see what Kelsey is up to,” she said, more to herself than to Tim.

As the call connected, her demeanor brightened. “Hey, babe!” she chirped into the phone. “You won’t believe the day I’ve had.”

Tim, feeling invisible, got up from his chair.

Before he could take a step, Nuria snapped her fingers sharply and shook her head. “Uh-uh, sit down,” she said firmly, gesturing for him to return to the chair.

Tim hesitated, then sank back into his seat, his face flushed with embarrassment.

Nuria’s conversation with her friend was loud and animated, filled with laughter and dramatic retellings of her day. Tim only caught fragments of what she said—most of it unflattering to him.

Tim shifted uncomfortably, staring at the untouched pizza in front of him.

After a few more minutes of chatter, Nuria suddenly turned to him mid-conversation. “Hey, Timmy,” she said loudly, “get me a glass of wine. And hurry up.”

Tim glanced at her, unsure if she was serious. The sharp wave of her hand confirmed that she was.

As he shuffled off to the kitchen, Nuria resumed her call. “Oh, that? Just my housemate,” she said with a casual laugh. “Or, you know, my little helper. Same thing.”

Tim returned with the wine, carefully placing the glass on the table in front of her. Nuria took it without so much as a thank-you, sipping it as she continued her conversation. She waved her hand dismissively, signaling for him to sit back down.

Finally, she ended the call and turned her attention back to Tim. “So,” she said, leaning forward slightly. “You didn’t eat much of your pizza.”

Tim sighed. “I told you, I don’t like mushrooms.”

Nuria rolled her eyes dramatically. “Oh, come on. You’re being ridiculous. It’s food, Timmy. Just put it in the fridge. When you’re hungry enough, you’ll eat it. Trust me.” Her tone was condescending, as if she were speaking to a child.

Tim clenched his jaw but didn’t argue. He quietly gathered the pizza boxes and headed to the kitchen, placing his unwanted pizza in the fridge.

When he returned, Nuria was stretched out on the couch, lazily flipping through channels.

“Clear the table while you’re at it,” she said without looking up. “I’m going to watch the rest of this movie. When you’re done, come back, and we’ll see if you can be useful for anything else tonight.”

Tim’s shoulders sagged, but he did as he was told. He cleared the table, rinsed the plates, and wiped down the surfaces. By the time he was finished, he was exhausted.

He returned to the living room and stood awkwardly by the couch, unsure of what to do.

Nuria glanced up at him and smiled. “You know, Timmy,” she said, stretching her arms above her head, “today was a great day. I’m really looking forward to tomorrow. You’ve done… okay so far.”

Tim blinked, unsure if that was a compliment or an insult.

“Anyway,” she continued, sitting up and brushing crumbs off her lap. “I don’t need you for anything else tonight. You can go to bed now.”

Tim opened his mouth to protest, but Nuria cut him off with a sharp look. “Go. Tomorrow’s an early day, and I want a nice, big breakfast to start it off right.”

Without another word, she turned her attention back to the TV, effectively dismissing him.

Tim stood there for a moment, staring at her, before finally turning and trudging upstairs to his room. As he climbed into bed, he couldn’t shake the sinking feeling in his stomach. This wasn’t how he had imagined sharing his home with someone.

The End.

I arrived the afternoon of 12/31, finished writing up after returning 1/14. In general the weather was fortuitously mild and lovely; crowds were mainly light; and staying near Senso-ji and traveling at this time of year meant we saw all the wonderful new years decorations at all establishments/homes and even on forms of transit like cable cars (!) as well as being able to observe hatsumode. No closing impacts at all on the trip from the NYE holiday except maybe for a lighter jazz schedule. I recovered from ankle surgery this fall so this was also my first stretch of really walking a ton, though I ramped up for a few weeks back weight bearing before the trip (my three month fall and surgery anniversary happened a week into the trip). This meant we took a lot of cabs, which I didn’t do at all on my first Tokyo trip years ago, and honestly they were quite affordable and could be ordered on Uber (I never downloaded the Go app though that’s advisable for ordering anywhere else). If you have tattoos I do recommend ordering tattoos covers ahead online and bringing them with you as nowhere I looked had them and I ended the trip never getting them, though it never ended up barring me from hotel onsens. My previous trip we went up into the alps (Nagano, Hida, Matsumoto) in addition to Kyoto/Nara/Kobe/Osaka, and having had a second trip, I really loved being on the coast and didn’t properly value the opportunity to see Fuji last time. Detouring for a regional fire festival, one of the top three, was also so worth it—in general I think seasonally specific things is part of where Japan shines. 

Started off with three Tokyo days from an **Asakusa** base. We arrived at Narita around 4pm on 12/31 and got our portable WiFi (next time I might just do an eSIM), though I foolishly didn’t exchange for the JR pass here (I should have!). Took the Sky express to Asakusa, which was very crowded, but fortunately got seats. We stayed at **Hotel MONday Asakusa** which is to the northwest of **Senso-ji** and the train but decided to walk the kilometer or so with our luggage, up through the stalls at Senso-Ji, and made dinner out of the various things on offer. It wasn’t quite as busy as it would get after midnight or the next day, but still lively! I had reserved the NYE countdown show at **Hub Asakusa** (charming, very lowkey but a good way to start the trip and they had little crackers at the tables which everyone pulled; we left around 12:30 and then started the year with an hour long Don Quixote trip at the 24 hr location lol.) First of course checked into the hotel and I sort of lay on the bed resting before getting ready to go out—it’s a long flight from LA.  Chose Asakusa in order to be by Senso-ji for Hatsumode and to be in a place less impacted by closures due to shrine visit busyness; boy were closures not a thing! 

January 1 we got a relatively late start and then went to pick up a kimono rental in Asakusa (took a minute to figure out which door to enter and to reconcile the reservation name and the name of the business, but got there). Getting the kimono on is a relatively lengthy process in a common dressing room and my mom was a bit skeptical but in the end I thought it was great—we did keep our sneakers on as we both have feet/knee issues, but we strolled to lunch at **Komagata Maekawa** for unagi and it was such a great traditional space and a really yummy meal (I probably would go for the less premium, less fatty eel next time though). Great view of the Sumida river and lots of families dining. Walking along the river in the sun before and after was such a treat! The rental place closed a little early for the holiday but we had time to go to the batting cages (discovered I can’t hit again) and to walk past Senso-ji again. Our hotel lobby showed a live feed of the crammed 1/2 am line for **Hatsumode** in the morning when we got back, it was long when we passed through again around 11 and then by our return at 3 you entered the line literally after leaving the subway station, it went the whole length of the stalls plus and you couldn’t pass through one side to another because it was blocked off though everyone was very orderly and polite. My mom and I just visited the small side temples which had lesser lines as we had both done the main temple on our previous visits. Very cool to see. Then dinner at **R lounge**  which was…fine but first we stopped at **subtone** record bar, near the main Asakusa pedestrian street but very very quiet. Absolutely a perfect bar, we got coffee and a DELICIOUS royal milk tea and were mostly ignored for the one other Japanese patron smoking a cigar at the end of the bar. Just so civilized. After dinner we stopped into an izakaya (CafeRest'CuznHomeground) with a tiki vibe near the hotel, I thought they had karaoke but that was upstairs however everyone was very nice and friendly. I am glad we made the lunch reservation but the dinner reservation was honestly not needed--we could have stopped in somewhere at random as places that might have been more interesting were open. I just had wanted the security beforehand of knowing we'd be fed and I do like rooftop spots.

Thursday January 2nd I reserved a train on the **Tobu Asakasu** line to **Nikko**, didn’t get it for too early because I’m just not an early bird but caught the 10:30 and honestly the 9:30 or 10:00 would have given a more leisurely trip; they were sold out by when I decided to consider changing though. This did give me enough time to realize the Nikko JR station doesn’t do JR pass exchanges however, so my mom and I took a taxi to Ueno station and exchanged it there with no line (booking the next few trips as well) and then took a cab to the Nikko train. It was definitely colder up there but not crazy busy so we were able to take the first bus that arrived and had juuust enough time to see the two main sites before they closed and to visit the Shinto shrine after. It’s quite something visiting the Tokugawa inner shrine and I’m sure absolutely beautiful in fall; while the grounds of the main shrine, and the decorations, are beautiful and imposing I found this one of the more sterile sites I’ve visited on my two Japan trips. Not sure if that came from the rush or from only visiting the main area and not staying longer in the area; I often find historical attraction day trips leave me more drained and less able to appreciate the site. I did want to visit Nikko and I’m not sorry I went but probably a less time crunched visit would feel more relaxed. We were taking the 6:20 return (so had about four hours) and ended up walking half the way back to the station before catching a blessed local bus just in time for my tired feet. Came back to Tokyo and had **Coco curry** right by Tobu station, then tried going to a karaoke bar I had seen in a Google map search but got distracted by the sign for another bar (the **At Home Bar**) on the way up and had a delightful time at a very different type of record bar, with a much more loquacious bartender who instantly fed us cake from another patron. Just a delightful visit. 

January 3rd we took the train towards **Naoshima** for a three night stay, this also didn’t leave crazy early but we got in around 1 to Okayama and had time to visit **Korakuen** garden and the rebuilt castle; took a cab from the station as Okayama’s cute streetcar line doesn’t go direct and again, saving my feet and time. So glad we did this, I loved the garden which is so well designed and the walk over the bridge to **Okayama castle** is very striking though one doesn’t really need to visit the inside as we did. On departing the castle a cab was just dropping off some passengers in perfect timing, and we went back to the station and used the JR pass to take the local train to Uno port at around 4:20, catching the ferry at about 6:20. This was a day without much in the way of proper meals after the nice hotel breakfast due to being on the go, but got 7/11 onigiri, walked from the ferry to rooms at **Quaint Hotel Naoshima**, visited the **I <3 U onsen** (tattoos fine!) and went to the perfect **Bar Queens-Q** for drinks. The perfect evening! And stopping in Okayama made the day feel full and not just a transit day (it’s definitely a long journey on the Shinkansen and then local train and then ferry). I wanted three nights on Naoshima to not be rushed and I’m so glad, it was really quiet but restful and nice to stay by the port. We had a little ritual of breakfast and coffee at **Akaito Coffee** and drinks/onsen at I  U and Bar Queen’s Q for the two nights/days in town and then transferred to **Benessee House Museum** for one night which was glorious, including the meal. January 4 we went to some of the **art houses** including the shrine and the Ando museum, and we visited **Chichu art museum** and **Lee Ufan museum** all by bus/shuttle. Ended up skipping the Turrell in the art house zone because it's not my favorite style of his installations and the timing for catching the return bus to the port area before sunset didn't seem to work out. Grabbed food at the basic Yuunagi (flounder), which was serviceable, and did the onsen plus Bar Queens Q again, and then Akaito again the next morning.

January 5 we did **Teshima** (took the first ferry at 9:20, missed the bus time to get back to the ferry so the desk called us a cab; I found Teshima’s installation very moving and enjoyed the rice field wander also. A pair of women did the trip by taxi in about an hour whereas we had three and took the local bus there. You could do it in the turnaround between the noon ferry arriving and the 1-something leaving though it would be a rush). After Teshima, took the guest bus to the museum hotel, checked in and then went up to the actual **Benessee House museum** and walked back at sunset. Didn’t take advantage of the extended hours as we were tired but did see Time Corridors late at night. Just very special! You could absolutely also do Naoshima’s museums in one day, but I liked not having to be back to back and having time to experience the island. I would go back for the triennial and to stay again 100%. 

From Naoshima we went for one night to **Miyajima** via Hiroshima; took the train a bit after noon to allow for the local train time and arrived in Hiroshima around 1:30. We sent our luggage on from Okayama back to Tokyo as the next three nights we would be in different places, god I love luggage lockers and sending luggage forward it’s just so much easier. We took the streetcar to **Hiroshima castle** and saw all the office workers doing Hatsumode together (first Monday after the new year holiday), very cute, but didn’t go into the castle. Then walked down to the peace park—I might just take a taxi next time there are underground passages most of the way and you’re pretty distant from the city in a lot of ways, but I think I wanted to approach the **Peace Park** organically. Saw the dome and wept instantly, and then spent an hour roaming the park’s monuments and weeping periodically. Just very moving. Didn’t go to the museum as I honestly don’t think I had the capacity for it emotionally (nor did we really have time). I would go back to do it in another day when I could just collapse after, as it is the park was very emotionally filling. Took the ferry direct from the peace park to Miyajima at about 3:30 and arrived at Miyajima around 4:30, staying at **Hotel Miyajima Villa** directly across from the ferry. I LOVED this hotel, great huge breakfast, ice cream and tea and music and cozy seating in the lobby and an onsen with a great view. They did have tattoo seals at the counter which I asked for but they said I could go without (I maybe didn’t express my tattoos as being large enough); the onsen stayed mostly empty on our visits so it ended up ok. Walked to see the Torii gate at night and it really is a beautiful site, also walked up to the pagoda before going to the one Machiya St restaurant that stays open til about 7:30, **Okonomoyaki Kishibe**. Mild wait but it was such a terrific meal and environment and all the guests put a sticker on a wall map for where they’re from, so charming. 

Didn’t get going super early the next day but the Torii gate wasn’t super crowded, then went up to the absolutely perfect **Daisho-in** temple and walked to the ropeway. Quite a hike! We didn’t plan to walk all the way to the sites up top due to the aforementioned ankle/knee issues (I think it would have pushed me too far), but in any case the winds were rising and they announced people should depart so we went back down and by the time we got halfway, they’d stopped people coming up (this was probably around noon). So we just snuck in the gorgeous views. Again, it would be great in fall or spring but it was still beautiful. I would go back for a long afternoon another time when doing that much up and down walking is more feasible and the time allows.

Walked from the ropeway back down to finally enter the shrine itself, which meant we got to see the Torii gate at midtide the night before, at low tide from the beach (it turned while we were there in the morning), and from the shrine as the tide was almost fully in. Gorgeous site, and the deer were really out all day both here and at the temple. We raced a bit from the shrine exit back to the ferry and to grab our bags from the hotel—that night we were going to **Kurume** for the **Oniyo** fire festival which gets properly going at \~8:45, so I honestly could have had us have lunch on Miyajima and leave at a more leisurely time which I wish I had done! Instead I was aiming for a 2:50ish train (they depart every hour for Kurume) and so wanted to take a specific ferry to catch the train back to Hiroshima station. Foolishly, because we hadn’t come in through the JR station across from Miyajima, I defaulted to the first train platform I saw—the streetcar, and didn’t make it the extra 200 or 400 feet to the \*actual\* train station with our \*actual\* planned train. The streetcar goes to the same destination so it wasn’t an unreasonable mistake but the journey is three times as long! So we missed the planned train and got on a later one in the unreserved seats. From here on out we only did unreserved tickets, it was never totally full and worked out just fine. But it was silly to rush so much for a specific train and then miss it! And we didn’t need to be in Kurume that early anyway really. Oh well.   


At Kurume station we took a taxi to Green Rich Hotel, which I booked to have an onsen but which wasn’t the most convenient location. We walked out to the nearby sushiro for dinner (it's not great sushi but I just love a conveyor belt) and then had the desk call a cab to go to the closest Don Quixote (to look for the tattoo covers) which was also near the train down to **Tamarategu shrine in Daizenji**, happily on the JR pass. A few other people on the train were going to the festival though not all that many; the shrine is a pretty easy ten minute walk north from the station and we arrived just before the initial torches were lit at 8:45. The shrine was busy for the fire festival but not packed! We could see pretty easily and as the night went on the crowd thinned so eventually we could follow whichever huge burning torch we wanted, and a very sweet young girl gave us some of the burned ropes (I also had a hole burned in my coat and absolutely had feather fluff coming out for the next two days!!). It was really amazing, I recommend it so strongly—it’s held every January 7 every year. There was a light drizzle but it ended and while it was chilly, staying near the fires does keep you warm! Well worth the change in plans. 

After the night in Kurume we used the JR pass to head up towards **Kokura** for a second night in a different Kyushu location, this was a very cold morning with some snow but by the time we hopped off in **Fukuoka** 15 minutes later the sun was out and we visited a bunch of temples. I would go back for the July festival race **Hakata Gion Yamakasa**, we saw one of the floats at **Kushida Shrine** and also visited the pagoda and giant Buddha at **Tochoji.** My mom really liked these sites and they’re nicely close together! I was a bit more tired but I did love Fukuoka station, very much tasty food but not an overwhelming size. After many temples we did a late ramen lunch at **Ichiran** ramen upstairs in the station. So filling, so fast, very yum. Then took the train to Kokura where I sort of collapsed at the hotel. Went out to admire **Kokura castle** and nearby shrine (very beautifully lit) and to view the Japanese garden illumination at the **castle garden**, which was beautiful but I didn’t realize you could only view from inside the tea house. We did see a gray heron take off while there! Then tried a karaoke spot but it had just opened and was empty, so went to a sake bar izakaya and then another karaoke bar where we made friends with two older Japanese guys and had a grand old time for an hour or so. One of the best bar outings of the trip! We explored Kokura more on foot and it seemed more easy to penetrate than Kurume.

The next morning we were heading back to Tokyo but first took a trip to **Mojiko** and then across the **Shimonoseki** strait to the **Karato** fish market; Mojiko is only half an hour from Kokura’s train station but it was certainly the coldest morning of the trip and when we arrived before 9 in Mojiko, pretty much nothing was open. We did take the ferry and wander the fish market which was nice however, the vendors in the outside area within the market were very friendly. As it was a weekday alas there was no sushi—it would definitely be worth going for the weekend market. And seeing how very close Kyushu and Honshu are was neat! Stopped at the convenience store in the station while waiting for the train back to Kokura and got incredibly delicious roasted sweet potato as a late breakfast, Kokura station was very light on early morning food vendors by the local train to Mojiko (and the local area of the station and the Shinkasen area are further apart than I expected). There was a nice walk up standing sushi counter near the Kokura Shinkasen tracks though and it was easy getting an unreserved seat—we did book for the travel through Jan 6 due to the new year holiday, but it wasn’t necessary otherwise. Plus the weather was clear enough to see Fuji beautifully well between Osaka and Tokyo. We got into at about 5 (leaving around 11 or 11:30), and had drinks with one of my work contacts whose office is in **Jimbocho** not far from Tokyo station. We took a cab (there was never any traffic somehow, and rates were really reasonable, usually under $10). Roamed a few of the specialized bookstores after including the train-only floor of **Shosen Grande;** I think some places there do specialize in translated fiction but none that were open so I ended up having to stop at a bookstore my last day to pick up a few reads after finishing what I brought. I would totally stay in this area another time, very cute. We took the metro and checked into our hotel the **Tokyu Stay Shinjuku** next, reuniting with our luggage; this was the least nice hotel of the stay (still fine, just without as many little touches) but had a good location. I decided I wanted yakiniku for dinner which in retrospect I kind of regret, I never enjoy it that much and it’s pretty expensive for what feels relatively inauthentic—a little izakaya would be better, but oh well. I thought this on my last trip as well I guess I just psy-oped myself again. Then we went to another great bar, after a jazz club I was aiming for was closed and another bar in the building was members only; some departing customers of the members bar ushered us into **Bar Sting** next door, which was quite fancy and lush. My drink of choice by this point was a China Blue which I strongly recommend!

Friday Jan 10 was our last full Tokyo day and I had booked a hair appointment as it’s \*way\* cheaper to get hair colored here than in NYC or even Baltimore, so I went to that at **Assort Tokyo** from 10-1 (getting a pretty full bleach) while my mom went to a Monet show at the museum of national western art in Ueno. She really enjoyed it! My hair salon was also incredibly friendly and efficient and a great experience, as someone who never knows what she’s asking for.  Assort was a few blocks away from our fancy lunch  reservation—lunch because it’s cheaper than dinner. We booked at **L’Eau** because I found it on the Michelin website and it seemed interesting, and the restaurant was incredibly unbusy for what was really incredibly plated and inventive food. I would go back and would recommend it! Food wise I suppose I wish I had found a great sushi spot for the trip, but a lot of the top places are so daunting to book that I just kind of quailed at it.   


From lunch we had 4:30 Kabuki tickets at **Kabukiza**, and as my dad had requested a knife we went to a knife store I found listed on Reddit (**Ginza Kikuhide**) that’s literally a block away from and directly looking at the theater, in a residential building. Very no fuss and easy and he takes amex and wraps it for you. That took about 15 minutes and we reached the theater at 4:15–ticket pickup is in the basement, down the subway escalator, if you’ve ordered ahead. I also booked the English translation pads. We weren’t sure if we would stay for all three shows, at a runtime of 4.5 hours, but they’re all so different and we ended up loving the traditional drama, the dance, and the modern adaptation of a historical show. Incredible experience. I loved the theater and the different customs of watching and the aesthetic of the productions and performances, and if there had been more time on the trip I would go back for the matinee to see another program. I’m big into theater, dance, opera, performance art etc and often go see dance/opera/theater abroad so it really suited me, and the information they give you makes it really seamless to watch and understand. Huge recommend. From there we walked to a tempura place, **Mochiku**, very expensive but delightful (the owners’ child was roaming around the whole meal, so YMMV but it was really charming). However I wish we had taken a cab from the theater to the restaurant, I had developed a blister (I think from weird compensating in my stride and maybe from swelling), and walking hurt by when the night was done—I accidentally got turned around going to the restaurant due to being distracted by the shops so we walked out of our way a bit though it wasn’t that far away. After a nice long set dinner we went to our final record bar of the trip (tears!), **Jazz & Bar Kiru** in the basement. Took a cab back to Shinjuku from there as we didn’t leave til 12:30. 

The next morning, Saturday, my mom was departing so we put our luggage at the hotel desk (I sent mine on to Haneda for Monday via Airporter) and walked to Shinjuku’s **Gyoen national garden** to enjoy the Japanese garden and sunshine, then picked up luggage and went to get Depachika food at **Isetan** for eating upstairs on the roof; realistically maybe we should have eaten at one of the spots at Shinjuku station, as the Depachika court was pretty crowded. Took a taxi from Isetan to Busta Shinjuku to drop my mom off for her Narita bus that we had bought tickets for, and I walked to the nearby building to take the **Odakyu line to Fujisawa/Enoshima** (right where the Romance line to Hakone departs—separately, going to Enoshima finally demystified Hakone travel to me, which has always seemed a little fiddly and daunting). The train to Enoshima was pretty full on a Saturday afternoon but I got a seat and it’s a relatively quick hour and a half with just one transfer and some cute local neighborhood views. Once off the train I walked down to the beach and watched all the kids playing with Fuji in the distance. It was warm enough that folks had their feet in the water and I can’t imagine how busy summer must get! The beach near the aquarium felt very chill and not crowded on a January, but the bridge walked to Enoshima was really very busy, as was the main street—just daytrippers, mostly I’m guessing from Tokyo though some tourists from China as well. I checked into my ryokan right off the shopping street, **Iwamotoro**, where the room view looks straight out onto Fuji—just heaven. I sat and read until sunset and then walked down the nearby side road to the beach to watch a magnificent Fuji sunset. Then I went down to the onsen and mercifully realized that when I gave a meal time on check in, it was for breakfast and not dinner which I hadn’t realized! After the onsen I wandered out to get food at a place that said online it was still open until 8:30 but was emphatically not seating when I arrived before 8; I had to speed walk back to the places on the outer road near the parking lots, where one was still serving food at 8, **Shimawarashi**. A real under the wire meal! Had some katsudon which was very appreciated in a ‘fear of not finding dinner is the best sauce’ way—was honestly being a little too cavalier about dinner though it worked out (and I could have traveled back over the bridge to town if needed).

Sunday I reserved to do Enoshima in full, taking it easy in terms of my start time because after another morning onsen Fuji reappeared so I did some more reading with my direct view (catching a group of paddle boarders returning—in summer doing the island circuit would be really fun!). I bought a day pass with everything included (elevators, cave, sea candle access, night illuminations at the garden) for 1500 yen, and it was again quite busy (weekdays are surely less so). Had a very good lunch at Yurantei on the path down towards the cave with a lovely view though Fuji was covered for midday, only reappearing around 3:30. I thought I could take the boat back from the cave area but didn’t check times and by the time I went to look at around 4:20 it was clearly done with, so I walked up and back (not as daunting as the escalator talk makes it seem), briefly stopping in at the **Samuel Cocking garden** after 5 — it doesn’t seem to light up right away so I honestly didn’t wait as I was now aware of the dinner time issue. Got a bowl of quite heavy tempura with shirashi at Amami, and finally went to the onsen cave at Iwamotoro, which was lovely. I think the onsens here technically didn’t allow tattoos so I tried not lingering too long or going when it was very busy, it didn’t create issues but note the Enoshima Island Spa is strictly no tattoos at all even if covered.   


Monday was my flight home at 5:25, so I took the train to **Hasedera** at around 950–I had two embarrassing transit mishaps that cost me about 20 minutes en route, I was two minutes late for the Enoshima island bus to the station and had to walk (it’s not a terrible walk, I just hoped to save myself the steps), and then on arriving before the train my Suica card was too empty and rather than hop on and deal with it on the other end, I tried to add money at the station and couldn’t manage to finish before the train pulled away. It was only 18 minutes or so until the next one, but a real unnecessary own goal. Walked from Hase station to Hasedera temple, which I LOVED, and then up to the big Buddha, which was fine but a bit less interesting as a visit. Then took the tram to **Kamakura** station and walked to **Tsurugaoka Hachimangu** shrine, which was all my schedule would allow—I would absolutely go back and stay at Kamakura proper. Also a word to the wise, I exited the tram at the no JR transfer side which was a mistake—I used the locker there for my backpack, but it’s on the opposite side of the way to the shrine and the Jr ticket booth, and you can’t buy tickets to Narita from the booth/machines on the west side plus you have to walk further both ways. Tsurugaoka Hachimangu was quite busy as was the shopping street, it has quite an approach plus a little island and mini Torii gate hill, though I didn’t stay too long. On my way back I stopped at a bookstore I had found on Google, **Shimamori**, because I was about to finish my book—they had a nice little selection of Japanese literature in English. Also popped into the nearby grocery store to get some food for my airport journey, and then took the train direct to Narita on the Yokosuka line; about 2.5 hours. It doesn’t leave very often but worth being on just the one train all the way imo! 

  
A few transit errors (not major, just misjudged) and a few days the timing was somewhat off, but overall really seamless--and just a great trip! Don't be deterred from what folks say about being in Japan over the new year period, but just schedule it properly. Also I can totally see how late foliage was this year, some trees in spots still had some leaves!",0,1738006733.0,JapanTravelTips,0,0.5,False

Over the past few days I have been through a pound of coffee with my Robot and Femabook a68.  No matter what grind setting I set on the A68 I am unable to push down on the handles and get about 10grams in a 90 seconds.  Everything was working fine before I recalibrated the grinder. 

Now I am wondering if this problem can be caused by calibrating wrong, a problem with the robot or beans.  Any thoughts.

When I first took over, I said I’d honour vouchers and loyalty cards from the previous management *for a limited time*. By August 2024, nearly all the old vouchers had been redeemed, so I put up a post on Facebook and signs in the window and by the till, letting customers know that we’d stop accepting the old loyalty cards at the end of September. I also offered to transfer any stamps from the old cards onto our new loyalty cards.

Yesterday, a woman came in, ordered a coffee, and handed me a fully stamped loyalty card from the previous management. The stamps were the old ones (I had deliberately changed the stamp design when I took over, knowing the policy would change after six months).

I politely explained that we’d stopped accepting those cards months ago. She got visibly annoyed and said I *should* honour it because she’s a “loyal customer.” I was confused because I’ve never seen her before—and I know all my regulars. I explained our policy, apologised, and even offered her a new loyalty card with an *extra stamp* as a goodwill gesture.

She doubled down, saying, “It’s just one coffee,” and insisted I make an exception. I told her that wouldn’t be fair to other customers who followed the rules.

She left annoyed, and now I’m wondering if I was too rigid. AITA?",14,1738006670.0,AITAH,32,0.94,False

1ibhw62,https://www.reddit.com/r/mypartneristrans/comments/1ibhw62/update_my_wife_passed_away_and_nobody_knew_who/,Update: my wife passed away and nobody knew who she really was,"Tw: death of a spouse 

I posted here about a month or so ago about my late wife (mtf) who had unexpectedly passed away. (here: https://www.reddit.com/r/mypartneristrans/comments/1hs98p2/my_wife_passed_away_and_nobody_knew_who_she/ ) There were a few people who said that I could continue to share about her here so here's an update:

Over a month in, it still doesn't feel real, but I'm getting.... used to it? Honestly even just the idea of me getting used to her not being here makes me want to vomit in and of itself. But each morning I wake up and look at her side of the bed and just sigh. I'm still crying most days. I didn't cry yesterday though which was weird. I have a picture of her as herself leaning on her pillow along with a few others on her bedside table.

I got her remains back and I kinda carry her around like a security blanket. I talk to her all day, and honestly I'm convinced she's listening. I'm in therapy, and I'm still trying to get our toddler into therapy. Thanks to the fantastic American health care system, I had to wait to get him changed onto my health insurance, and then I had to wait for his card to arrive in the mail, and now I'm waiting for a call back from the place I called to see if they have openings. It's a process. 🫠 Hopefully I can get him in somewhere soon. I think he's starting to actually feel the loss judging by his behavior lately, but doesn't know how to handle the feelings. I'm doing the best I can to help him talk it out to the extent that he can, and just letting him feel what he's feeling. We've been having a lot of easy/lazy days to help him hopefully cope.

I also joined a widow/widowers group anonymously, so I'm able to mourn her as herself because nobody knows me or her. It's been a huge help, that outlet.

We're also going to adopt some cats, and I'm going to name one of them after my wife - her true name, not her deadname. Only the few people who knew who she really was will understand the significance. I spoke to my therapist about it first to make sure she didn't think it would be detrimental to my mental health in the long run, but she was all for the idea. So I'm going for it. I think my wife would like the idea. I can just picture it, she'd get all bashful but I think it would make her feel loved and she'd be happy.

But now I'll be able to say her name as often as I want, out loud, without outing her. Talking about her and having to use her deadname most of the time has been awful. Honestly I just refer to her by pet names most of the time now to avoid it as much a possible.

I know this cat is no replacement for my wife, but she already has a soft spot in my heart because she's helping me out just by being around. My toddler gets along with both her and the male cat we're adopting, and so do I, so I think both coming to live with us will be good for us. Two months before my wife passed, our senior cat passed, so having kitties in the house again will be welcome.

Otherwise, I'm just kinda existing. I feel so empty without her. I miss her voice and her smile. I miss her hugs, her warmth, the way she'd get little eye crinklies when she smiled. I miss her sense of humor, I miss watching her horse around with our kid. I miss spending time with her. I miss holding her hand. I miss the way she would belly laugh when something cracked her up. I miss her scent. I miss the sound of her making coffee in the kitchen. I miss her infodumps about whatever she was interested in at the time.

I wear her wedding ring along with my own now, and I'm not taking them off anytime soon, unless I find a chain or something to wear hers like a necklace. I went back to work and it's weird that I'm expected to carry on like normal. The world keeps spinning and I don't understand because mine came to a screeching halt. I have empathy for anyone who lost someone, because just continuing my life after this has been excruciating. All I want to do is see her again, I think about her constantly.

I'm not afraid of death any longer. It just means I'll get to see her sooner. I'm not gonna do anything to speed the process up mind you - I'm going to stick around for our kid and now our cats, but let me tell you, the yearning to see her is unending. 

I miss her so much. She's my best friend, my soulmate, and she always will be. Thank you all for the kind words on my previous post. I read every single one, even if I didn't respond. They meant a lot to me, knowing that she was known.

1ibhv3p,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/1ibhv3p/recurring_headaches_cant_find_the_cause/,Recurring Headaches- Can’t Find the Cause,"I (26F) have had a habitual headache pattern for years at this point and I cannot for the life of me find the cause, besides the simple “stress” answer. Every single time I go back to work on Monday (or any other day after a break/time off), I get a headache. For awhile I thought it was caffeine. I drink coffee on weekends only, more as a “treat” as opposed to people who drink it during the week for energy. I thought I was just very sensitive to caffeine and was having a withdrawal headache every Monday after having coffee on Saturday/Sunday and then not having it on Monday. So I started drinking decaf only probably close to a year ago. I thought it might’ve helped for awhile, but I still seem to be getting a headache every Monday when I return to work. Honestly, I don’t LIKE going to work, but my job is not really stressful. I only work with one other coworker (who I like) and we have a very laid back environment. It ALWAYS happens the day I return to work- if I was off for an extended holiday break, vacation, regular weekend, etc. For example… Last Monday, I was off work for MLK Day, and did not drink any caffeine or decaf coffee- I did not get a headache being home. However, I got a headache on Tuesday after returning to work the next day. Why 😭 I have even started to wonder if there’s mold in my workplace or something, but I’ve never heard my coworker complain of any other similar issues and she’s worked here for 10 years longer than I have. I try to not put it in my head; it’s not like I show up on Monday just waiting for the headache to show up or something. I will just be sitting at my desk not thinking about it at all, randomly start to notice it at some point during the day and think “seriously?! again?!” I have anxiety but do not take any medications, supplements, etc. and don’t drink/smoke. Please give me your suggestions as to what may be causing these headaches- I can’t take it anymore every single week 😭",1,1738006521.0,AskDocs,2,1.0,False

TLDR in the end, don't want to spoil everything for those who might read through the whole thing.

I have been typed as two different types by all the different mbti tests I've done, xxFx and xxTx. I find the xxFx type of those two often a bit flaky, dramatic or irrational. I find the xxTx type of those two often lacking empathy and/or morals and being very out of touch of their own feelings.

I work in cybersecurity. In work environment I have been called organized and having an analytical approach and great ideas. I am also the one who says the ""harsh truth""(meaning bringing up issues that bug everyone in general, but have not been brought up, or telling someone that how they could improve their work). However, I am able to put those ""harsh truths"" in  a way that it has never made people upset, and on the contrary, have gotten very positive feedback for doing so as people rarely do that.

In my personal life I have been called a walking chaos, creative, childlike and intelligent. However, my brain works in a upside-down sort of way, which often makes me overthink simple tasks, such as making coffee, while tasks and concepts people often take longer time to understand come easily to me. For example, understanding what basic irony even meant as a word took me 15 or so years, while I was programming full on functional websites at the age of 8. 

On my freetime I like painting, composing music, reading research papers and articles from different fields, walking in the forest, travelling, reading fantasy and sci-fi, snowboarding, martial arts and playing video games. I wrote a book when I was younger and would like to get back to creative writing more. I also am quite good with languages, as I am bilingual since early childhood and can currently hold a conversation on 7 different languages(some of them might need a lil warming up tho haha). I enjoy debating with people(especially if they can back their statements with facts and teach me something new) and talking about hyphotetical ideas.

I definitely have flaws, such as lacking motivation with mundane tasks and my home can get a bit messy if I live alone and no one comes to visit for a while. I lack patience and can be either impulsive or indecisive when it comes to small, daily things(often ask others what should I eat since I cannot decide). However, I do not make big decisions or decisions that I know affect others just on a whim. Those situations I analyze thoroughly and usually come to the conclusion by myself.

I also have a complex, traumatic past (diagnosed with c-ptsd), but it rarely gets triggered anymore since I have been to therapy and worked alot on myself. I have ADHD and my friends joke about me being autistic. My therapist and friends have pointed out that I have hyper-empathy and that I see too much good in other people. Then on the other hand I am much more fine with hearing and seeing very brutal stuff than most people seem to be, even if just a minute ago I cried over a random sad old man whose grandkids didn't visit him. 

I enjoy spending time with people but also need lots of alone time. In social settings with my friends I am the wilder and talkative one, but amongst my relatives I get called the quiet and calm one. I can make friends and connect with people easily, and new people often confide in me, and my old friends often seek advice from me. However, I find myself socially awkward at times. 

If you got to the end: damn! You are amazing. 

TLDR:
Mbti tests have typed as xxFx and xxTx. ADHD, often stupid but apparently high IQ, artistic and impatient while also analytical and observant person with daddy issues wants to know what you would guess as their mbti type.

I haven’t made any new friends in NY since college. The ones we had kind of disappeared once they had kids. I enjoy exercise classes but no one talks to me & I’m not someone that reaches out to people. It makes me uncomfortable & when I do, they reject the invite. I take classes like barre, Zumba & some strength classes.

I also don’t drink alcohol so that cuts me off from a lot of social activities already. If you have a social event at a coffee bar I’ll likely do that but most people don’t do that. I also have different interests from most people. I like Broadway musicals & enjoy listening to the cast album. The only sport I like watching is figure skating. The music I would enjoy occasionally listening to is popular standards, the music I grew up listening to from my dad’s radio. I like just playing the classic MTV music videos from the 90s or 80s that they sometimes have on. I also get into watching murder mysteries so most of the time, I haven’t found people that share these interests.

Sometimes I end up discussing some of these topics with FB groups but no one I know in person. My friend WG, I met her in high school but I didn’t really know her until we roomed together in college. That’s when I discovered we don’t have any of the same interests. She ended up with other roommates after that & I never made any close friends after her. Then I just held onto her as a friend even though we weren’t close. I was convinced that maybe if I were to have a close friend, they couldn’t have a sister. Most girls with sisters are best friends with their sister & it’s impossible to have a relationship closer than blood. All my acquaintances like AT & CD ended up being WG’s friends from college. They never really bonded with me because our interests were completely different. Then I ended marrying a guy whose interests are closer to theirs than to mine. They were able to relate more to him & I was just there listening. It was nice that sometimes AT would bring party video games that allowed non gamers to get into it. 

I’m also kind of awkward. Like I have an awkward personality & it’s a bit difficult for me to make eye contact. This also makes communication difficult with new people or they lose interest in me fast. Sometimes I’m also intimidated to ask new people questions because I’m afraid I’m prying into their lives but I don’t think it’s the case but it’s a thing I struggle with mentally. Maybe when I get a job here, I’ll start feeling like I belong a little & will start socializing but right now I don’t.

I found myself becoming very rigid in my daily routines as far as order of operations go. For instance I would always do my morning routine in a certain order, do my chores in a certain order, etc. Sometimes I'd spend so long going through my ordered routine that I never even got around to doing the things that really needed to get done. 

So I tried a new technique. Every morning I wake up and write down my to do list item by item in a different sticky note, one task per sticky note. I fold them up and put them in a bowl and randomly draw to determine which task I will do next. I also sometimes throw in reward items (i.e. drink coffee, read, etc) based on what leisure activities I feel like doing that day. 

I went from accomplishing maybe 30% of my to list with my routine method to accomplishing 90% of my daily tasks with this method. It forced me to break out of my rhythm and puts back some excitement and unknown throughout the day. It also helps because it's much easier to break down large tasks (i.e. clean the kitchen) into smaller subtasks (i.e. load the dishwasher, change the trash). So when I draw any task it feels very doable. Whereas before I would drag my feet and feel overwhelmed by the sheer number of things I had to do. 

Anyway, this method might not be for everyone but if you're looking for a little eccentricity and to break out of a rigid routine, give it a try, you might have fun! It's become a game for me at this point and I have started adding dreaded tasks (i.e. update resume). When I pull a task my rule is I have to do it no matter what! 

Wdyt, has anyone tried this roulette style approach to getting tasks done? ",1,1738005944.0,ADHD,3,1.0,False

I am a 29M and up until 27/28, I had no issues at all. I am pretty athletic, gym, play sports and stay relatively healthy. No prior medical history. In March 2023, I was on vacation with my gf and was drinking a beer at a ski resort. Half way through, I had the most terrible right flank pain. I mean it was unbearable. A few weeks later, I went to a urologist and they did a CT scan as well as a renogram, where he concluded that I had hydronephrosis or Dietl crisis. The doc said to wait a year to see how it goes… over the past year it would be almost like flare ups. Usually caused by BEER, alcohol, over eating, or just eating something too greasy/oily etc. however sometimes even just something as minor as coffee. 

The most recent “flare up” I had was 4 days ago when I took a pre workout .. worked out then had a protein shake + dinner after. I had the most unbearable pain overnight and into the day (next day) I mean we’re talking almost 6 HOURS. I was rolling in bed, taking a shower, going into the tub .. basically doing anything to try to occupy myself.

I don’t want to say what I do for a living to stay somewhat anonymous but I have a high position at a large company and we had board meetings the day of my flare up. I had to skip out on an important day for the company where several members of the board and investors flew in for. Even though my colleagues backed me up, it was embarrassing and I knew I had to do something about my health.

I am scheduled in March with a good doctor in my area who performs laparoscopic robotic pyleoplasty. Has anyone done this surgery?  And why does the pain only come to me with things like beer and not soda or even junk food?? Really weird.

I made something that might help!,"I just wanted to share something I’ve been working on that might help you out. It’s an app I created called **NoCover**, and it’s all about helping small businesses make **extra, reliable income** through subscriptions.

The idea is simple:

* You offer perks your customers already love (like discounts, free refills, or exclusive goodies).
* They subscribe through the app for a monthly fee or yearly fee.
* You get recurring revenue every month with no extra work.

What’s cool is that it’s **totally free** to get started unlike Toast Loyalty, and there are **no invoices or hidden fees**—just money sent straight to you. Also, you guys get to create the subscriptions and what they include since we feel like you all know your customers best.

I think it could work really well for coffee shops because your regulars are already super loyal. Imagine offering something like “Unlimited Brew Refills for $15/month” or “20% off drinks every visit.” Stuff like that keeps your regulars coming back and spending more.

If this sounds like something you’d want to try, feel free to ask me questions here, DM me, or check out [nocover](http://nocover.io/).io. Honestly the website isn't great, but I'm really proud of how our app looks on the Apple App Store!

Would love to hear your thoughts or ideas—I’m still learning how to make this better! 😊

1ibhj62,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/1ibhj62/oatly_otly_nespresso_pods_are_available_for_sale/,OATLY ($OTLY) Nespresso Pods are available for sale in Canada now,"After the new CEO (Laurent Freixe) taking the helm - who knows Nespresso , Nescafe (especially coffee mate) business inside out, also targeting bringing growth back to Nestle - released recently a collaboration with Oatly : which is available to purchase in Canada as of today and US expected to be available by Wednesday.

As mentioned earlier in prior DD's, I find Oatly is the missing piece of Nestle portfolio with following rationale.

\-          Both European companies, similar/same regulatory framework

\-          Nestle tried peamilk with plant based, failed and delisted. They still look for alternatives. As the product add says, Oatmilk with earthy flavor complements coffee (especially high quality like Nespresso quire well).

\-          Coffee mate business is bleeding, based on the latest financial reports for 2024, Coffee-Mate sales have faced some challenges, particularly in North America, where there has been a noted decline. Partially this is because of overall market situation , but more importantly plant based.

\-          Many synergies possible : workforce, office consolidation, supply chain optimization and increase in distribution.

Repeating my numbers that I run before : Oatly as business can be absorbed quite quickly and easily with a big MNC having global footprint like Nestle (or others). A buyout will cut this corporate costs significantly based on synergies to be generated and Oatly articles will be just additional SKU’s in the assortment. In my opinion, this is also the reason why Oatly keeps reporting corporate (cost center) different than the three regions (P&L centers).

This corporate costs account for \~25M per quarter, almost 100M per year. This number can be up to a large extent saved by a smart merger. In addition, similar synergies will be achieved in the regions (sales force, production footprint, brand initiatives etc)… It would not be off to think 30-40% of SG&A can be saved by all the synergies can be achieved, which will be an EBITDA contributor of 100M to 130M.

Given the natural progress achieved by the management brought quarterly losses from 50M to 5M in 6 quarters (potentially zero or green in Q4), overall EBITDA on a hypothetical merger could be \~120M.

Given the growth potential that Nestle will bring in, a 20x multiplier will not be illogical. This will end up a 2.4B valuation.  Which will give rougly a 6x multiple versus today's prices.

Success of this collaboration may be sparking such buyout scenario... Let's wait and see , if this will come true or stay as a wish of the shareholders of oatly being punished for long...

I’m an 24F, 5’2”, 109lb Asian American and an avid rock climber (1-2 hr sessions 2-3 times a week). I don’t consider myself an unhealthy eater, but I’m also not a health nut either. I have diabetes entrenched in my family tree, with both of my parents (who are in their 50’s) with prediabetes, so the inevitable has occurred! 

The most telling symptom I’ve been having is excessive thirst, which seems to be a common “your prediabetes has turned into diabetes” symptom but as I’ve just been handed this diagnosis I may just be a rare case. While I don’t have a CGM, I was able to do a couple finger stick tests while visiting my parents:

- Fasting Glucose (~10 hr): 93 mg/dl
- ~3 hours after a meal (missed the 2 hour mark since I was on the road): 127 mg/dl
- Lab A1C: 5.7

Personally, these couple of data points aren’t enough for me to paint a larger picture. Being so young and really not someone you’d imagine having prediabetes, I’m reaching out for some guidance and help to navigate this Asian American curse. I’m frustrated at the classic advice of losing weight and exercising more and would love to hear a fresh approach. 

I want to be able to incorporate any changes into my existing routine, which means maintaining my cadence of exercising and swapping out ingredients but not sacrificing calories or food amounts. I’m also open to getting a CGM. 

More elaboration on my recent diet:
- Protein: chicken, seafood, tofu, beans, occasionally pork and trying to cut out red meat
- Carbs: Pasta, mixed white/red rice, tubers like taro and sweet potatoes, mung bean and rice noodles
- As many vegetables I can manage that’s not salad: Asian greens, kale, spinach, mushrooms, carrots, etc
- Snacks: yogurt and granola, fruit, crackers and cheese
- Dessert/sweets: I bake once a week for the climbing friends but will have one cookie as quality control
- Drinks: mainly water and tea, no coffee or boba, perhaps a sparkling water, no alcohol ",2,1738005650.0,prediabetes,5,1.0,False

Hi,

Just looking for a bit of advice on selling my honey really.  I do have a couple of shops that stock my honey but in the area I am in, there seems to be so much saturation with people selling honey at what I think is below the real value. 

I live in an area of Surrey where the average population is quite old and I think they still think this is the 1950's where honey should cost £3 a kg.  I recently saw a post on my local facebook group asking where to buy honey and about 25 people replied offering their honey at super cheap prices.

my problem is 

1. I'm not willing to sell my jars (250g) for less that £6
2. There is so much competition that even the some of the groups have banned honey for sale posts
3. There are a couple of well known people with beehives who everyone seems to buy from and not really willing to buy from anyone else.

I'm thinking that selling to more retail stores would be a good idea, but again there seems to be someone who is already supplying to most of the stores I approach.  
I have been mostly trying health food stores and independent food stores as well as delis and coffee shops but don't seem to be getting much traction

I was just really hoping for a bit of advice on how I can improve my honey sales.  I do produce a fair quantity so I pretty much have honey for sale all year round.

1ibh7v3,https://www.reddit.com/r/passive_income101/comments/1ibh7v3/launch_a_specialty_coffee_subscription_service/,Launch a Specialty Coffee Subscription Service,"Starting a specialty coffee subscription service can cater to the growing number of coffee enthusiasts who appreciate high-quality, artisanal coffee. This business would source premium beans from various global regions, offering customers a chance to explore unique flavors and blends each month.

# Concept Overview

This service would provide coffee lovers with freshly roasted beans delivered to their doorsteps on a regular basis. Subscriptions could be customized based on preferences such as roast level, bean origin, and grind type. The focus would be on sustainability and direct trade with coffee growers to ensure quality and ethical sourcing.

# Features and Functionalities

1. **Customizable Subscriptions**: Allow customers to customize their subscription based on their coffee consumption rate, preferred roast profile, and grind size.
2. **Rotating Coffee Selections**: Offer a monthly selection of different coffees from around the world, providing tasting notes and information about the farms where the beans are sourced.
3. **Brewing Guides and Recipes**: Include guides and recipes with each shipment to help customers brew the best cup of coffee possible.
4. **Gift Subscriptions**: Provide options for customers to purchase gift subscriptions for friends and family, enhancing market reach.
5. **Loyalty Program**: Implement a loyalty program that rewards subscribers with discounts, freebies, or first access to rare coffee batches.

# Business Model

* **Monthly Subscription Fees**: Charge a recurring fee for regular coffee deliveries. Offer different tiers based on the frequency and quantity of coffee delivered.
* **One-Time Purchases**: Besides subscriptions, offer customers the option to purchase bags of coffee or related products like mugs and grinders without a subscription.
* **Corporate Packages**: Create tailored coffee solutions for offices and businesses looking to offer premium coffee to their employees.
* **Educational Workshops**: Host coffee tasting and brewing workshops for a fee, either virtually or in person.

# Marketing Strategy

* **Content Marketing**: Use a blog or YouTube channel to share coffee-related content, brewing tutorials, and behind-the-scenes looks at coffee sourcing and production.
* **Social Media Campaigns**: Leverage platforms like Instagram and Facebook to showcase the unique aspects of each monthly coffee offering and share customer testimonials.
* **Partnerships with Coffee Bloggers and Influencers**: Collaborate with influential coffee enthusiasts who can help promote the subscription service to a wider audience.
* **Email Marketing**: Build an email list to notify subscribers about new selections, special offers, and events.

# Challenges and Considerations

* **Supply Chain Management**: Managing a reliable supply chain to ensure timely delivery of fresh coffee can be challenging, especially when sourcing beans from multiple international locations.
* **Customer Retention**: Keeping subscribers engaged and preventing churn by continually offering exciting new coffees and improving customer service.
* **Market Competition**: Differentiating the service from other subscription services in a competitive market requires a clear unique selling proposition.

# Conclusion

A specialty coffee subscription service offers coffee lovers a convenient way to enjoy high-quality, diverse coffee offerings from the comfort of their homes. With a focus on quality, sustainability, and customer engagement, this business model promises not only profitability but also a loyal customer base passionate about great coffee. This venture taps into the specialty coffee market trend and has the potential to build a brand that is both profitable and influential in the coffee community.",2,1738004957.0,passive_income101,0,1.0,False
1ibh6wu,https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/1ibh6wu/what_can_i_expect_from_adderall_ir_withdrawal_is/,What can I expect from Adderall IR withdrawal & is it really that bad??,"Long story short, I'm going to be visiting Korea for two weeks and due to holiday and technical delays, it's looking like my permit application to bring Adderall into the country isn't going to be processed in time. I'm doing everything I can to work with their narcotics office at the Ministry of Food & Drug but I'm not super hopeful at this point.

How bad is Adderall withdrawal and what can I do to cope in the meantime? I have a prescription for 15 mg. a day but only really take 10 mg. a day (and maybe an extra quarter of a pill if I need the boost) now that I work from home/for myself and don't need as much as before, so it's like my dosage is super high.

I will sometimes take 1-2 days off from Adderall but have otherwise taken it fairly consistently for the past 2 1/2 years. I know I can just rely on tea & coffee for energy but what worries me is that Adderall has done wonders for my anxiety and OCD which was my main struggle regarding my inattentive ADHD before being medicated. 

Maybe it helps that I won't need to work while I'm gone? Any advice or insight? ",1,1738004893.0,ADHD,2,1.0,False

1ibh1oa,https://www.reddit.com/r/Semenretention/comments/1ibh1oa/make_friends_with_women_on_sr/,Make friends with women on SR,"So I made a post on here about this topic in the form of a YouTube video cause I started a channel, but I figured I'd write my thoughts about this as well since this is something that's been on my mind the most since starting SR. This is something important people don't talk about on here. In fact, I see people on here talk about the opposite of what I'm going to say. 

I think it's important to be friends with women on SR. The reason I say specifically on SR is because I don't 
believe it's very easy to generally be friends with women when you are not retaining. 

If you are someone who wants to sleep around willy nilly, chances are you will not be friends with a woman unless you find her unattractive.

When are on SR, your standards are higher. It's not just about wether or not a woman you know is attractive or not, you are committed to retaining your seed & only releasing if it was TRULY worth it. 

First off though, your motivation for SR has to be higher then attracting women though. If you are on SR in hopes you attract more women, then SR is not gonna work out for you & secondly, you're pretty much in the category of someone who sleeps around willy nilly. You're just desperate for a chance to hook up. 

If you are someone like me who truly doesn't want a girlfriend anymore & wants to wait until the right person is in your life, being friends with women is crucial. 
Go out & socialize, go grab coffee with a woman without any intention of doing anything sexual, choose wisely, or make friends with groups of people & be friend the women in the group. Avoid dates & just hang out as groups of friends. 

Don't have a group of friends? Go out & socialize. On a weekend, go out to a coffee shop that might have open mic nights or karaoke nights or go to local concerts or clubs. Whatever it is, Just go to places where people hang out on the weekends.
Socialize & interact with everybody. Men & women. Make friends slowly but surely. Don't have an intention to get a girls number to ask out on a date, just get to know a girl for the sake of getting to know her.

You might find yourself in a group of new friends with attractive women. I believe it's important as a man to have the flow of feminine energy in your life. 

I see too many people on this sub hating on women on this sub because they do A, B & C. Learn to love people. If a women has red flags that would keep you from dating her, then simply don't date her.

That doesn't mean you have to avoid women. I think the idea that you should avoid women on SR is toxic. You don't have to be so lonely on SR. Just learn to control your lust. 

Yes there will be times that you might have impure thoughts while talking to some women & you might be tempted at times to do things you shouldn't. That's part of life. But the point is that you should learn to have the control to stay on SR because you know the benefits. When I get lustful thoughts, they go away. I don't let them linger for ever. 

Being horny is healthy. That doesn't mean that edging is healthy, I just mean that as someone who is on SR, the sexual energy you feel will be STRONG. That's how it's supposed to be. You just have to learn to control your urges. Also no ones perfect, SR isn't easy, be easy on yourself & just applaud yourself for being on a challenging path most people are too scared to face.

Go on a walk, go meditate, do breathwork, exercise, go take the energy out on something else & whatever lustful thoughts you had will disappear sooner or later. 

You'll learn to love women without needing to love them as you would with a girlfriend. 

The more I do SR the more control I feel that I have over my clarity for wisely choosing a partner in life. 

I know at the end of the day, I will make the better decision to keep these women I meet as friends unless they truly check the boxes for being qualified to date me.

I know that the woman I'm looking for to date is a not a common woman I run into everyday. So embrace being single. It's actually really nice. Being single doesn't have to be so lonely. 

The problem I see with a lot of people on here is that they start labeling every women that has red flags as a ""Jezebel"". Like they are all just full of pure evil. 
Everyone has evil in them. Yes there is plenty of evil in women, but you don't need to focus on the evil. Focus on the goodness in women. Acknowledge the evil in a woman so you can be cautious & not allow yourself to be deseaved into getting with a woman who's no good. 
But don't focus on it. Enjoy the beauty that is in woman. Enjoy there presence & how they make you feel while you are around them. Breath deeply & allow yourself to connect with them spiritually rather than physically. 

Get rid of the red pill hatful mindset. It's not going to do you any good. 

My favorite thing about SR is that I learned to truly love. I realized that I can love everyone. The love I would have for a hypothetical girlfriend or wife of mine is the same exact love I feel for my family & friends. The only difference is there is lust mixed in. I hadn't realized this until I started doing SR. My desire to have the perfect wife is gone. I no longer care. My priority is not to have the perfect woman in my life anymore. My true desire is to find a woman whom I can not only love, but also a woman who checks all the boxes of what I'm looking for in a partner. 

The only reason we as men & woman are drawn to each other is to have kids. I've realized that having kids & raising them one day is way more desirable than just having the ""perfect wife"".

I hope some of you may face learned something from this, good luck to you on your SR journey. Keep going strong 💪",18,1738004547.0,Semenretention,5,1.0,False

Great - now that that's all cleared up, let's get back to hearing what **YOU** feel!

I've ranked them in last place in order of difficulty in my Adversary breakdown, but that does not mean - by any stretch of the imagination - that they are to be underestimated!!

So tell me, fine people, what do you think?? Do you enjoy playing against the Swashbuckling Swedes? Find them difficult, or perhaps easy? What about the difficulty levels, which ones cause you the problems? Which cards, spirits or approaches do you find works best? What about those that don't work so well??

Get involved!!

The chamber immediately cracked and water got between the double wall, rendering it in my opinion unusable.

I have a support request out to see if I can get a replacement chamber since their [replacement parts](https://aeropress.com/collections/replacement-parts) website doesn't mention a replacement premium chamber. But also wondering if my clumsiness + the premium's fragility are not a winning combo, and I should accept the microplastics and get a regular plastic AeroPress.

Pretty sad about this since it was literally the first use and this is also my first foray into any sort of home coffee making.

I'm a beginner tea drinker and had some questions about what may be best for me! I read over the FAQ but was looking for some more specifics for me.

I'm a single guy who drinks Kirkland(Costco) Sencha-Matcha blend green tea bags. I am looking to step up my game to loose leaf! I had two main questions:

Best tea pot / brewing method for me?

* Single servings, convenient to brew, and friendly to Japanese-style green tea (Kirkland sencha & matcha I know I like)
* I'd also love something that looks cool. I love the color of jade, or some artwork on it would be a big plus. Clear glass could also be cool.
* My budget would ideally be $30-40 and under.
* I currently brew my teabags in a coffee mug, and if I wasn't able to drink out of the recommended tea pot, I'd love a teacup suggestion as well.
* I also drink Freshpak rooibos tea, I love it but not sure if I want to step in the loose-leaf rooibos game yet. So something that could potentially be good for loose-leaf rooibos would be nice as well, but not a deal-breaker



Lastly, any tea recommendations for me? I haven't done much research yet, because I don't have a teapot. All I really know is that I like the Kirkland Sencha-Matcha blend bags from Costco, and I think I'd be looking to continue drinking that as a blend?",1,1738004226.0,tea,1,1.0,False

Due to the dependence on gstreamer1.0-gtk4, CoBang is only available on relatively new version of Linux distros, like Ubuntu 24.10 and equivalent.

To be unified with Flatpak package (to be released tomorrow), CoBang now uses xdg-desktop-portal to ask for webcam access permission, instead of accessing directly to \`/dev/video\` devices. As a result, it cannot list multiple camera and cannot show device name (which is not returned by xdg-desktop-portal). Maybe in the future I will make CoBang have slighly different features when running outside and inside sandbox.

Chrome Coffee Works on 131 Pine Street is open daily from 7 a.m. to 6 p.m. and has been since late last year.   
  
On this Monday, Miguel, behind the counter, smiles and pours sweet smelling coffee into real coffee mugs for patrons walking in on an icy, snow covered morning in downtown Reno at this charming spot near the Pioneer Center.    
  
The sign above him lists black, green and herbal teals, pastries, breakfast burrito, bagel and affogato.  In terms of coffee, there’s drip coffee, espresso, Americano, Cold Brew, Cortado, Latte, Mocha, White Mocha and Chai.  It also indicates in 1950s type lettering “If you don’t see what you want, just ask! We can probably make it!”  
  
At the front of the counter, fresh croissants are begging to be ordered.    
  
Around ten or eleven, Miguel says it’s lawyers and courtroom workers who start arriving for a quick pick me up.  
  
For now, the food served here comes from other shops, such as the pastries from Beloved’s Bakery and Cafe and the breakfast burritos from Midnight Coffee.    
  
There’s also beers on tap and canned adult beverages.  
  
On Sundays, a DJ sets the vibe playing some vinyls for a crowd that has more time to relax.  
  
The Yelp reviews have been high, averaging 4.4, complimenting the well lit space, all the available outlets, the cleanliness and the espressos and lattes. A recent reviewer Megan S. who ranks as elite with 38 coffee reviews and counting wrote:  “ORDER: Gingerbread Oat Milk Latte“FUTURE ORDER: Rosemary Oat Milk Latte &/or Rosemary Lavender Latte!  
  
I can't resist seasonal options so super recommend the gingerbread latte while you can, but yay for herbal unexpected options!!! Thrilled to see the option for rosemary which I'm now realizing is also seasonal, so I'll be hurrying back for some more perfect microfoam babyyyyy  
  
Also yay for local beer on tap, beautiful ambiance & awesome service - such a welcome addition to downtown!”  
  
  
The Google Reviews are at an even higher average of 4.8.  
  
“Chrome Coffee Works is amazing! The building's aesthetics are super cute and the espresso and cold brew are really tasty! It's the first coffee I've had in years that doesn't taste overly roasted or burnt. Congrats on opening!” Jennifer Flynn recently wrote giving five stars.

i tried to overcome so many things at once today; eating lunch, eating a store bought chocolate cookie, and having a night snack were all a bit mentally difficult, but i did it. i also didn't exercise. i felt satisfied with myself.

but now i just feel like crap. i still count my calories, and i know damn well i didn't eat much. what's the point in trying to recover when i just *can't*?

i also feel like crap because i had two crackers left, and asked my sister if she wanted them, and she said no. she didn't finish her dinner either, and that made me feel bad. i made a post about my relationship with my sister on another ED subreddit. i feel like it just fuels my ED to get worse than get better. it's really fucked up.

I went online because I thought that the pharmacy might have given me the wrong medication by accident.  They didn't.  Both pills are supposedly the same medication at the same dose, but I reacted so differently to each one that I started tracking my symptoms.  Eventually reduced my dose because the second brand seemed way more potent and I couldn't handle it.

I understand that this will vary a lot for the individual but I thought other people might be interested to see how differently you might react to a different brand.  It's something you might want to keep in mind for yourself.

Through therapy we've also unpacked quite a bit and PTSD has been a diagnosis which I'm sure had been there quite a bit since my Marine Corps days 22 years ago. 

I'm wondering if there are any Houston Stroke survivors or surrounding areas that are willing to share their story.

My relationships have been impacted by this and I've had to make a decision to break it off so I can work on myself. I found myself trying to find meaning by helping others but I also found myself neglecting my own recovery both physical and mental. it was my ways of being in denial I guess. Sometimes my life feels pointless. I feel lonely even though I'm surrounded by people and stay active. I go to the grocery story, coffee shops, read, etc. and the emptiness enters at times, then there is the elation that comes back because I survived and then the cycle starts all over again.

If you haven’t read my last post here’s a quick synopsis, if you have just skip to the next paragraph. I (33f) wouldn’t let my husband (37m) be my sisters Alice’s guarantor for her passport because according to the outline (which I found out it says it on the application) my husband is not allowed because he is by law her brother… you know related by marriage. The only other option would be if he was a passport holder which he is not. Anyway she claimed I did it because I didn’t like her and that I would have let any one of our other siblings do it… that part gets juicy. Which she then blocks me on all social media and text. Christmas was coming I wanted to get her a gift because then she would have to speak to me again which is why I made the other post (all details are there). 

Anyway my husband and I went to visit my parents which 3 of my siblings live on property Alice being one of them. I told our Mom, Dad and other siblings I wouldn’t be speaking with Alice unless she apologizes because I didn’t do anything wrong except point out the obvious and even give her solutions. They all said they wouldn’t interfere or anything because it was between her and I. Well my baby sister (26f) and her babies came to pick my husband and I up at the airport and take us “home” we arrived and Alice was outside with everyone else ready to give us the big welcome which I managed to avoid a hug and hello from her, I wasn’t letting her just play it off. My husband and I went to the house we would be staying at and he talked me down cause I was ready to walk up to her door and knock and I would start crying asking what I did so wrong which would give her the upper hand ( god I love my husband I don’t know where I’d be without him). So each morning I would take my coffee and head over to the parents house and have coffee with Mom, we would talk and have a great time. She has a great set up so we can watch the babies (nieces and nephews) play while we chat. On morning 3 my husband and I were having coffee with Mom and Alice walks in (she did every morning, and I would just stare off at the children) and she says “I want to apologize to both of you, I was being a b!7(& and I couldn’t see how you were just trying to help cause to me the world revolves around me” yes those were her words! I was shocked and just said “I forgive you” because I mean I didn’t think I was going to get more than that. For the rest of the trip each morning she would come over and say “we need to bond” which I would say “it comes with time and effort, we can’t force a bond” which I mean after day 8 of the visit we started to bond sorta over hair products it’s something I guess. 

So the day we are leaving for the airport and I’m packing and cleaning up my baby sister comes over tablet in hands and she whispers “can your husband be my guarantor? I did some reading and there’s one spot he can sign off on” so I of course take the tablet and read what she’s talking about cause this would just send Alice into a tizzy but there right at the very end it says “must be a passport holder” which again knocks my husband off the list so I once again suggest 2 other people. My baby sister starts laughing and says “now I gotta block you” and we laugh for a long while before Alice happens to walk in and wants one last coffee before I leave, so we all meander over to moms with my suitcase. My husband, my baby sister and I all share a knowing glance because this has definitely bonded the 3 of us it’ll be an inside joke for years to come I’m sure. Alice and I hugged goodbye and have been messaging each other everyday I am hoping that means she’s growing. Oh and I didn’t end up getting Alice for secret Santa, our middle (32f) sister did and she came to me for ideas…. So Alice still got the painting, and I got our older sister (41f) and she loves the puzzles and craft supplies! ",3,1738003193.0,CharlotteDobreYouTube,0,1.0,False

So disappointed,"I love this machine but this just straight up sucks, contacting Breville today to get yet another replacement machine. This is more of a rant than anything but, I think it’s important to note since the bambino plus is widely recommended for beginners like myself. I’m likely getting the short end of the stick and just unlucky with my machines, and this is in no way an attempt to bash Breville or the bambino plus as a whole. I will also note that I clean my machines and backflush regularly and descale every 2-3 months.

First machine was perfect for about 3 months until a tiny internal piece came out of the steam wand and needed to be sent in. Stuff breaks, it happens, and Breville was awesome about it.

Second, brand new, machine was great for about another 8 months but succumbed to steam issues. Steam pressure and temperature decreased significantly causing milk steaming to be near impossible. Again, stuff breaks, Breville was awesome, and sent me another machine.

Third brand new machine, my current one, went from working perfectly to wildly inconsistent and now can’t pour a double shot in less than 50 seconds, no matter how coarse I grind. In the last 2 days I’ve changed up my entire routine in various ways, tried pulling blind shots to heat the group head (which I’ve never had to do before), cleaned/descaled, and have done basically everything except offer my soon to be born son as a sacrifice (if my wife is reading this, I’m totally kidding).

Imo this is still a great machine for beginners but, has its faults which is to be expected. For anyone who is considering the BBP don’t let my misfortune deter you but, if you do end up with issues, just know that Breville’s customer service is some of the best in the business and will help with your issues.

It never happened before but I am falling for a colleague of mine whos sitting right front of me everyday.

Short summary of him and I... I moved to a new country and started the work a month ago. I didnt know anyone, I was having very hard time at work. I was mentally and physically really struggling the first few days.

One day, he asked me to go to coffee with him and I shared my struggles with him. a few hours later he emailed me through work email to tell me hed be happy to hang out with me outside work if i need someone to talk to with his personal contact (I almost cried of happiness) then we started hanging out together both at work and outside work too.

we always eat lunch together, he always asks me if I wanna hang out after work for drinks, we even hang out on weekends too. but he has a long distance boyfriend of six years he seems very happy with him always talks about him with me and girls at work.

we have so much in common, we both started work around the same time, his boyfriend and I are both from kind of same country, we are the only gays in the team, we have many friends in common etc... 

I dont think he loves me on the same level as me, I think hes been just nice to me as I just moved to the new country, new company, he knows I dont have anyone to hang out with apart from him.

I dont want any awkwardness with him so I always accept whatever he offers, asks but I am getting close to the point it almost feels very painful to be this close with him as there seems almost no chance to be with him the way id love. I dont want to cause any drama to work, it feels so hopeless and painful but I would rather stay good friend for him without telling him how I really feel about him.

Has anyone had same experience at work? How do you stay calm at work? How did you get over it?

1ibgdct,https://www.reddit.com/r/hypertension/comments/1ibgdct/just_found_out_i_have_extremely_high_bp/,Just found out I have extremely high BP,"I am 38 years old, about 5'9"", 232lbs. I know I'm obese and have been for years. In September, I went for my first physical in about four years, and the practitioner said my BP was 140/90. I know that's elevated, but I was working on losing weight and reducing my salt intake anyway. So, in addition to my diet changes, I stopped drinking explicitly caffeinated beverages (coffee, energy drinks, etc.). I've been having trouble sticking with the diet plan, but I did successfully give up caffeine (except for the occasional diet cola). As of today, I'm down 11lbs from where I was when I started. I also don't currently exercise for the sake of exercise, but I am definitely going to start after what happened this weekend.

I went for a dental cleaning on Friday 1/24/25 and they took my BP as is their procedure. It came back 207/135. They tried two other machines and both produced similar results. They advised me to go to urgent care or the ER. I felt completely normal and asymptomatic.

I went to urgent care, and they got similar results on two machines, and a manual measurement as well. I had an appointment scheduled with a new PCP on Friday 1/31 already, so the urgent care practitioner told me to buy a monitor and record my numbers to show my doctor the next week. She mentioned she was reluctant to send me home with numbers so high, but since I was asymptomatic and was already planning to see my PCP, she told me to go to the ER if I developed any symptoms.

Needless to say, I became very anxious about the numbers (which I'm sure didn't help). From the time I got home around 2:00 PM I was searching the internet for explanations, causes, treatments, and at-home 'tricks' to bring the numbers down. Of course, nothing yielded meaningful results. I took my BP again that night at around 9:30 PM and it was up to 255/142, so I decided to go to the ER, even though I still felt asymptomatic.

The ER admitted me immediately, did an EKG, ran a kidney function test, checked for signs of a stroke or aneurysm, and everything came back okay. They gave me a couple oral medications (not sure what) to reduce my BP, and a potassium supplement; then monitored me for a couple hours. The numbers came down a little to about 185/115. The PA in the ER said that he didn't see any signs of immediate danger and I should follow up with my PCP ASAP. They were preparing to discharge me around 2:00 AM when I sat up and passed out.

Evidentially, the medication caused a sudden drop in my BP, and I had Vagal Syncope. I was only out for about a minute (so they tell me), but they decided to keep me and run some more tests. They gave me a CT scan, a chest x-ray, another EKG, gave me two bags of fluids via IV, and took some blood to run other tests, but didn't tell me what they did with them. After a long night of discomfort and little sleep, they told me everything came back okay and discharged me around 10:30 AM even though my latest BP measurement was 190/118. They prescribed 5mg of Amlodipine daily to get me through to my PCP visit.

I moved my PCP visit from Friday 1/31 to Monday 1/27 (this afternoon) and have been monitoring my BP which has been averaging around 210/125. Every time I see the number I panic a little bit and feel like I need to do something, but I think I've done everything I can do for now. I just have to see my PCP and get on a long-term regimen of diet, exercise, and medication.

This came as a big surprise and pretty severe scare. I expected my numbers to be higher than the normal 120/80, but how much higher still baffles me. Especially when I've made lifestyle improvements over the past four months which are supposed to help control BP. I'm sure my life-expectancy has been considerably reduced as a consequence of my high BP for who knows how long. But I find myself wondering if numbers this high are strictly a consequence of my weight and lifestyle, or if there are other contributing factors like underlying condition or disease.

Has anyone else been asymptomatic with BP consistently over 205/120, and been still discharged from the ER? I will be making drastic lifestyle changes in the coming days, weeks, and months, but what would the timeline be to get the BP back to something less extreme? Even something like 150/100 would be an incredible improvement over my current numbers. Sorry for the long story, but it's been a rough weekend for me.

  
TL;DR; BP measurements consistently around 210/125, but I'm asymptomatic. Went to the ER and they discharged me. Following up with my PCP today for a long-term plan.",10,1738002938.0,hypertension,14,1.0,False

She gave me the bear and I bought her a deep fried slice of cheesecake on a stick in return. That must have been our first date, maybe second if you count walking her home from class as a date. The teddy bear had always been here, even when she wasn’t, and she certainly wasn’t here now. I tossed the bear up and up again, catching it over and over in my outstretched hands as I laid on my bed thinking about what I’d done wrong. Toss and catch. Toss and catch. Toss and catch. The smell of her perfume is embedded in the fluffy fur of the bear. She must have sprayed it when I wasn't looking. Toss and catch. Toss and catch. Toss and catch. Maybe I should have made more time for her. Maybe I should have sent her flowers. Maybe I could salvage this if I came up with a damn good apology.

Maybe, maybe, maybe. Toss and catch. Toss and catch. Toss and catch. Maybe, maybe, maybe. The repetition, and general emotional exhaustion, lulled me into an unexpected sleep. The fragrant teddy bear lay nestled in the crook of my arm as I snoozed in a dreamless twilight with the light of my bedside lamp still illuminating the bedroom. Shifting slightly into a more comfortable position, the stuffed animal rolled away from my body and tumbled noiselessly over the edge of the bed and onto the carpet below. The slight change in pressure was just enough to pull me from my slumber. I rolled to the edge of the bed and reached down, down towards the floor to recover the bear and, hopefully, return to sleep in only a moments time.

That's exactly how it would have happened had I not laid eyes on a sight that made me feel more awake than any every cup of coffee I'd ever ingested, combined. There, beside my own outstretched palm, was another that did not belong to me. Nor could it have reasonably been mistaken for mine. This hand, which stretched out from beneath the bed skirt, was gnarled with burl-like knuckles and long gaunt fingers, adorned each with a cracked yellow fingernail. As I watched from atop the bed, the hand stretched slowly out, out, out until an entire spindly arm appeared. Flesh sagged about the bones within like Victorian drapery. It didn't occur to me that I should panic, so I didn't. I'd never been in a situation like this before-- I wasn't entirely convinced I was in a situation like this right now-- so the thought that I could scream or gasp or run away simply never entered my mind.

The calloused fingertips clutched the teddy bear around his soft middle and pulled it rather gently across the carpet until it disappeared completely into the chasm behind the bed skirt. The faint smell of perfume lingered in the air. The now empty space beside the bed was filled with two simple words, ""Thaaank yooouuu."" The voice, which was almost a whisper, echoed slightly from below. Even then, I did not panic. Then, more than ever, the soft sheets and doughy pillows called to me. I switched off the lamp, and my mind, and fell quickly into a deep and restful sleep.

*The buzz buzz buzz* of my cell phone awoke me the next morning. ""Hello?"" I yawned. The reply was far too loud and far too excited for whatever time it was. ""Yoooo, wake up! I'm outside and I brought bagels."" Brad was indeed outside and he was, in fact, carrying a brown bag full of bagels in his hands. He settled at my kitchen table and explained that he had heard about Lacy, through a series of he-said she-said type chains, and wanted to bring something he knew would cheer me up-- breakfast. Usually, he would have been correct. Except I hadn't thought of Lacy yet that morning and the mention of her name had the dual purpose of reminding me to be sad and disappearing any hunger I might have felt.

Not to mention that I had lost the teddy bear, my only tangible reminder of our relationship. Oh, shit. The teddy bear. I ran from my kitchen table into my bedroom and threw up the bed skirt, hoping to see the stuffed toy on the carpet beneath the bed. Nothing. Crawling on my hands and knees around my room, I checked every conceivable stuffed animal sized crevasse. Nothing. Brad watched from the doorway, half eaten bagel in hand. ""Whatcha doing?""

""You would not believe me if I told you,"" I replied.

""Try me,"" he said. Realizing that I must already look insane, I conceded that I may as well sound it too. We returned to the kitchen table where I regaled him with a detailed account of my encounter with the creature. He listened intently, throwing in the occasional ""mhm"" or ""oh, really?"" for encouragement. When I had finished my tale, I eyed him expectantly.

""Dude,"" he said, ""I mean this with, like, lots of love and stuff. I think you're just all tore up about Lacy and you had a nightmare. Or maybe it was one of those sleep paralysis demons or something. Ya know?""

We talked back and forth, back and forth, for ages. I swore it was real. He was adamant that I was experiencing some non-descript form of psychosis. Eventually, he convinced me that I had binned the bear in a fit of rage and rationalized its absence in a nightmare about a monster under my bed, all as the result of my intense emotions over the breakup. Say what you want about Brad, but he's a solid amateur psychologist. Anyway, the entire episode was immediately forgotten when Lacy texted me later that evening: *I miss you*.

Lacy and I spent the next few months rekindling our relationship. The fair was on again so we went and spent a bit of time making out at the height of the Ferris wheel. We went to the movies. To restaurants and bars. To parties. And, of course, we spent many a night at my apartment, away from the prying eyes of onlookers who may sneer at our open affection. Things between us were perfect. Absolutely perfect. The type of perfection that can only be achieved when you blissfully and intentionally ignore each and every glaring issue for the sake of enhancing an illusion.

She slammed the door of my apartment, setting the picture frames on the surrounding walls askew. ""You're an asshole, Ben. Do NOT call me!"" she screamed from behind the closed door before storming down the hall and away from our relationship, again. In that moment, I did the only thing I knew to do. I ran into my bedroom, threw myself onto my bed, and cried into my pillow like a princess locked in a tower. The sadness lasted an hour or so before it was replaced by red hot anger. Her face, smiling at me from the framed photo on my nightstand, made my stomach bubble. I grabbed the frame and threw it onto the floor, hoping it would shatter into unrecognizable pieces.

Hot tears streamed from the corner of my eyes into my sideburns as I stared at the ceiling, wishing a portal to space would open and suck me into the deep, black void where I'd never have to worry about love or romance again. Minutes ticked by one second at a time as I pondered the void, only pulled back to my miserable reality by a voice in the dark. ""Thaaank yooouu,"" it groaned into the room where silence used to be. I threw myself across the bed and peered over the edge, just in time to see the corner of the picture frame disappear, pulled under by the very tips of too-long fingers with too-long fingernails.

This time I remembered that I was a being with free will and, as such, I chose to panic. The tears on my face were replaced by cold sweat. The heaving sobs of moments ago were replaced by shallow breaths that did almost nothing in the way of oxygen circulation. My fingers wished desperately to flip the switch on my lamp and expel the menacing shadows from the room but they were frozen in place, clasped tightly around my legs as I laid in the fetal position above the comforter for the following six hours or so.

The next morning, when Brad arrived with bagels, I decided not to tell him about the picture frame, lest I be involuntarily committed to a psych ward. I'd searched beneath the bed on my own before his arrival and discovered not a single remnant of the frame or the photo within so, really, what was there to say, anyway? We ate our bagels, loaded as they were with heaps of cream cheese, in relative silence, punctuated occasionally by one or the other of us suggesting that I was better off without her anyway. This was true, of course. I was better off without her. Though, I forgot that almost immediately as soon as she reappeared on my doorstep a few weeks later.

The steam from the shower stuck to the mirror, which annoyed Lacy who was trying to apply eyeliner in preparation for the wedding we were set to attend that evening.

""What?"" she asked.

I pulled back the shower curtain to hear her better, ""what?""

She rolled her partially lined eyes. ""What did you say a second ago?""

I closed the curtain. ""I didn't say anything.""

She'd finished her makeup by now and was storming about the room like a whirlwind looking for this accessory and that. ""Ugh!"" she moaned, ""Where are my sandals? Have you seen them? I swear I left them right here next to the bed."" She knelt down and searched the entire perimeter of the bed, even checking the small space between the bedframe and nightstand. No sandals. I shrugged. ""I haven't seen them but we don't have time to keep looking. We should have left 20 minutes ago. Just wear your heels."" She begrudgingly complied and, within two minutes, we were off to drink too much and exhibit poor judgement in dance moves.

That evening, we stumbled through the front door, releasing one *tee-hee* and *ha-ha* after another into the dark apartment. We staggered towards the bed, shedding high heels and neckties along the way before collapsing into a puddle of giggles and fits. It was so nice to see her smiling. I didn't want her to stop for even a moment. I reached out to tickle her. Her laugh rang out like a windchime as she reached to push my hands away. ""Come on, Ben,"" she gasped between cackles, ""Stop! I can't breathe."" I intended to stop after just another moment but, before I did so, she wiggled out of my grasp and popped over the side of the bed. She landed on the carpet with a dull thud. I rolled onto my back and clutched my stomach, which shook from the force of escaped laughter.

It took a moment for me to quiet down enough to realize that she wasn't laughing anymore. ""Awe, Lacy. I'm sorry. I didn't mean to--"" The words caught in my throat as I leaned over the bed to help her up. The hand again. I recognized the bulging knuckles, this time clutched firmly around her ankle. She stared silently, as I did, tears welling in her wide eyes, as the face of the creature emerged from beneath the bed. Its saggy flesh hung about the face in sheets. Its pallid eyes, sunken deep within the skull, were set firmly on Lacy. It did not turn to look at me as it spoke. “Thaaank yoouuu.""

She let out a partial scream before she was dragged, almost in one motion, beneath the bed and out of my life forever. Of course, I searched desperately for any trace of her in the void beneath the bed, though I knew by now that what was taken by the creature was taken completely. I can only hope that, wherever she is, she is hugging the stuffed teddy bear and thinking of me.",17,1738002299.0,nosleep,6,1.0,False

The other day she started calling my phone while i was downstairs screaming at me about how she hates everyone in this house (i didn’t take it personally) and that nobody helps her with anything. she started screaming that she hasn’t eaten in 3 days and that she cant light her own cigarette or get her own coffee. so I went upstairs and asked her if she wants me to anything for her, she proceeded to tell me that she didnt want anything. also let me tell you that she had eaten lunch the day before (this happend in the morning/early afternoon). she refused to eat dinner the night before because I bought the food, and she wouldnt eat “my food” that i bought for the family because we literally didnt have anything else in the house. she very much refused even tho i brought her a plate so i feel like its not my fault she didnt eat. so when i was asking her if she needed anything she told me no again, and i told her i couldnt help her if she didnt tell me what she wanted, she said nothing.  my grandma came upstairs to bring her a cigarette and some coffee and while i was out of the room ahe decided to lock the door and say she was killing herself. i was trying to pick the lock, i couldn’t so i told her to open the door or i was breaking it and she started screaming at me that she hates me, and she always has, she called me a cun.t along with a bunch of other names. i started crying and said i wanted to kms (it was in the moment i wouldn’t do something like that) and she told me she hopes that i do. i left for the rest of the day and she convinced me to come back because the “kids missed me” (my brothers) and she bought me chinese food. i feel like im going insane, i dont think i love her anymore. i want to move out so bad but its way to expensive and i work in my home so i would need a new job that will probably pay less (im making a few dollars over minimum wage). i dont know what to do. sorry for all the typos im angrily typing this trying to convince myself to not just run away.

I can describe the relief I would need better.

[Presbyter Branko Zelen](https://preview.redd.it/t5uxphqrtkfe1.png?width=300&format=png&auto=webp&s=7f67a198534e47b0b6a3786aaa59e379480231a2)

Fr. Branko serves in Zemun at the Church of the Nativity of the Mother of God. He spends most of his days preaching—his church receives many visitors. Sometimes he catches a little rest and has a chat with his parishioners. He may sound like he’s joking, but if you look in his eyes you know that despite his jolly demeanor he has bigger fish to fry…

It all started of course with smiles and mutual friendly teasing with Ivan: You know, when I die, you’d better make sure I have a coffin with speakers for music! And have a halo painted on my portrait, and… don’t you dare forget the wings, or I’ll just quit… What do you mean, you’re first in line to die? No way, that wasn’t the deal! And give me my coffee. Don’t you see that guy’s waiting?” Kind-hearted conversations with parishioners salted by a good dose of Serbian humor are a good thing, really! “*That* guy” is actually Ivan’s godson Alexander from Mongolia, who hasn’t been to confession for a while, and apparently he’s learned and seen a lot during his time spent with his godfather.

It is never late, even in adulthood, to learn that what is most important is in Christianity, and to be reminded about those things. And God obviously uses every opportunity to deliver such reminders. So, meeting someone like Fr. Branko, who seems so light-hearted and full of joy, is one such opportunity to remember.

“**Little Christ”**

Fr. Branko relates:

I am not from this area, I am originally from Herzegovina, I was born and lived not far from Mostar. What? You’ve been there? A beautiful town, isn’t it? I was born in a village nearby. We once had a telephone line finally installed there, a single line for the whole village. That was something, I must say! The villagers used it maybe once a week, but it would be the talk of the village. Because without it, it would be: “Hi, neighbor, how’s it going?” often shouted across the whole village—but with this phone you could talk to someone as far away as Belgrade. I tell you, a massive-scale event! Nowadays we can’t talk like normal people without staring at the screen; but before, we could openly talk and look into each other’s eyes; we even used normal language and not some lingo.

***We had a wonderful life there: Orthodox, Catholics, and Muslim. We visited each other during our festivals, played football till we dropped and sang songs.***

All in all, we had a wonderful life there: Orthodox, Catholics, and Muslims. We visited each other during our festivals, played football till we dropped and sang songs. I served in the army, and I made the decision to become a priest while still serving in the army—but dear me, how one Captain had it in for me because of this! All sorts of insults, calling me a “little Christ”, and all that, especially when I refused to stay in the army any longer than was required of me. But yes, they promised much for that. Oh well! I became a priest anyway.

**A walk to the execution site**

Then came the war. Our country broke apart. The Serbs were slaughtered. I mean this literally. Do you know who threw us under the Croatian Ustase? Our dear fellow villagers—the ones with whom we sang songs, played football, and had birthday parties together! *And a man’s foes shall be they of his own household* (Matthew 10:36). They turned us in and we were shut up in a concentration camp. Well, it was more like a torture camp as there were about forty of us *standing* in a single cell. Awful stench. You don’t simply feel fear—it is verily imbedded in you. Slimy, disgusting fear. Once I came back to my senses one way or another, I said: “Brothers, let’s say east is that way. Let’s start praying now, got it?” At first, there were only a few who joined me, then there were more of us, and in the end, almost all present were praying, except for one or two. And I felt terribly sorry for those two, I tell you! One of them was a colonel of the Yugoslavian People’s Army, and so he simply couldn’t wrap his head around the fact that he is no longer being treated with due respect, and his former subordinates are jeering at him. How did this happen? It was only yesterday that they saluted him, bent double before him, caught his every word. But today—lo and behold: a “latrine,” a death row cell (that’s right, we ended up there!), shouts of “Kill the Serb!” And now some preacher is calling him to join in prayer… And so this wretch of a man died of horror.

We didn’t die, even though everything was heading in that direction. I was taken outside a few times—I mean, to be executed. Yes… But then Patriarch Pavle, God bless his soul, managed by some miracle (although this was for him and Christ a way of life!) to make arrangements with the Croatians for a prisoner exchange. Do you know what the exchange rate was then? One Serbian priest to two Croatian pilots! So, they exchanged me. They took me to Belgrade, straight to the hospital. Naturally, I didn’t feel too well.”

**Fr. Branko’s shame**

There I was, lying in my hospital room, and at one moment I am told, “Pavle himself is coming to see you, Fr. Branko.” Oh, I’m thinking to myself, here comes my chance to tell him everything I had on my mind. And I had a lot to unload after what had happened. So, I am preparing my speech. A fiery one.

The door opens, the Patriarch enters, small and stooped, but with clear eyes and a penetrating glance:

“Not all of us, Fr. Branko, are granted such an honor—to suffer for Christ’s sake. Not all of us my dear. Christ Is Risen!”

[Inside the church where Fr. Branko serves](https://preview.redd.it/egif7ulwtkfe1.png?width=300&format=png&auto=webp&s=a148825f2567020270e39c536a1123115ad619fb)

He said it in such a way that my jaw dropped, and all my fiery words evaporated. In such cases every word languishes, with all the nouns, adjectives, pronouns and interjections. What else can I say! Many tears were shed on his shoulder that day, yes! But later on, when I was driving Pavle to church, I made sure to drive him the long way around because I wanted so badly to spend as much time as possible with him and ask him questions. The poor man humbly submitted to my driving style and answered all of my questions, mostly naïve, of course.

Finally, we arrived at the Patriarchate. There was a very old elevator, maybe a hundred years old. So, we entered together. I weigh almost a hundred kilos, and the Patriarch, a real faster, is light as a feather. Pavle goes inside, and the lights in the elevator turn off with a zap. I burst in next and the lights—zap! and turn right back on from fright. His Holiness says,

“Listen, Fr. Branko, something’s unusual here. A sinful Patriarch enters and the lights turn off. A penitent enters and the lights turn right back on again.”

I stood there turning red from shame while the Patriarch just laughed.

**The best parishioners ever!**

[Serb Ivan Ivanov and his godson Alexander from Mongolia](https://preview.redd.it/fajamcmytkfe1.png?width=300&format=png&auto=webp&s=29e896aa6f96f1ef79e174bc7df5a82770e4b12c)

Then I was assigned to serve in the Republic of Srpska in Banja Luka. As a new priest, I went to meet my parishioners. Or, rather prospective ones. So, I was walking around the town and then I rang a bell at one house. An old man opens the door; a tough nut to crack, he stands at almost two meters, his door-wide shoulders block the entrance. He looks askance. I say to him:

“Hello, I am Fr. Branko, rector of the church. Do you have anything to say to Christ?”

The old guy takes my mug and spits right into it. I just stood there and let it flow. But what can you say in such case? But then I was given proof of Christ’s words: *Settle it therefore in your hearts, not to meditate before what ye shall answer: for I will give you a mouth and wisdom, which all your adversaries shall not be able to gainsay nor resist* (Luke 21:14–15). I heard myself saying:

“Alright, I understand, this was for me, and quite rightly so. But what about saying something to Christ?”

Something dropped to the floor behind the old man. It was his old wife, who had seen everything, and when she heard my answer she dropped to her knees. The old man changed color and backed away. Then, bam! he also dropped to his knees, grabbed my hand and kissed it:

“Forgive me, father! Forgive me, a fool!”

You know, I never had better parishioners at my church and I still remember them with love and gratitude. They always helped with everything they had, attended services, supported others, took care of our church—simply outstanding Christians. Such are our miracles. Or is this just ordinary Christian life? What do you think? I think that a miracle is actually a pretty ordinary thing, right? Ivan! Ivan Ivanov! So, where is that coffee, after all?”

**An ordinary thing in our neck of the woods**

[Fr. Branko Zelen](https://preview.redd.it/5bws6jr1ukfe1.png?width=300&format=png&auto=webp&s=2fb5304549b3f427885ebf291ba76206b2ead26f)

“Yes, now about the coffee. Do you remember the officer who was chasing me for being Orthodox? So, a zillion or more years later, I went to a bank in Belgrade. People were standing in line. I came up to the window and beyond it is the smiling face of a woman. I say my name, such and such, I want to receive my pension. She stares at me—no, she simply freezes.

“Wait, are you… a priest?”

“Well, yes, what’s the matter?”

“Father, like it or not I am not going to let you go! Do you remember so and so?” And she says the first and last name of that Captain.

“Sure I do.”

She shouts, “Wait a minute!”

Then she comes out and explains everything. It turns out that the Captain is her husband. He is, she says, on his deathbed. He’s a good person, but all his life he felt sorry about one thing: that long ago he chased away an Orthodox man named Branko Zelen.

“So now, father, I plead with you, and I am ready to do it on my knees: Go with me and see my husband—bring him consolation, please, and forgive him.”

Sure enough, I went with her. And the Captain simply lit up. He offered me coffee. He was lying on his bed, so full of joy. We spoke, of course. He asked me to forgive him:

“Forgive me, Fr. Branko!”

Of course I had forgiven him long ago. He confessed and received Communion:

“Now I am not afraid to die,” he said as he breathed a sigh of relief.

Soon afterwards he died, God rest his soul! A miracle is actually an ordinary thing. Especially in our Orthodox neck of the woods.

As I walk away from Fr. Branko I understand that the beauty of Serbia isn’t necessarily all about its hills and mountains, rivers and waterfalls. The heavenly Serbia, like Holy Rus’, is truly real—you can see it if you look carefully. And I am sure that God will help you take a good look.

I love Dexter. I was a fan up until season 6 and then it became terrible ever since. New Blood was truly God awful but I still watched it all and had somewhat high hopes for Original Sin. But Wtf is this prequel become...it honestly feels like high schoolers wrote it..it's lazy and I need to rant.


-Harry was pissed as fuck Dexter fucked up his contract killer kill and now he fucks up even worse with bringing a body to an active crime scene, and having evidence found. But now Harry doesn't give a shit and is like keep killing bud. 

-Why is half the police department dealing and doing stupid shit like going to gay bars and investigating a maybe possible serial killer of homeless people when the captains son is fucking kidnapped. They send laguarta and Harry away when they could easily be helping (OH but the mayor said Harry couldn't... stfu) the CAPTAINS KID IS KIDNAPPED

-Imagine writing this episode and making the captain have his kid kidnapped, maimed and the captain is actually responsible for some stupid reason but it's never mentioned in Dexter. You'd think at some point Dexter would be like hey Deb remember when i started working with dad and 10 minutes later I found out the captain was a killer. Kinda like this stuff with Brian MOser..oh wait I forgot everything. 

-I love the contrast of Dexter humorously dispose a body in a dump with quirky music to be followed up with an 12 year old getting his finger cut off. Amazing choices all around.

-Batista is fucking stupid. Dexter telling him to help the captains kid was the only part of this show I actually liked but wanted him to tell the entire police department to stop cracking jokes and drinking coffee and start actually investigating. I wanted Dexter to tell the gay cop to stop fucking dudes and get the fuck to work.

-i still can't get over this cop who's secretly gay. Is this going  anywhere  with one episode left? Probably not. This plot line only works if the gay cop finds out about Dexter's secret but Dexter is like yo I won't tell them you fuck dudes if you don't tell anyone how I fuck dudes. But this still won't make any sense and brings more questions.

-Flashbacks I fucking hate. Get chainsawed already. Acting in these flashbacks is worse than a soap opera.

-How do you not notice a condom wrapper on the floor and how do you eat cold spaghetti after being covered in garbage juice and body juice. Sick fuck. His truck is clean as hell but one perfectly Shiney condom wrapper is there for the chick to conveniently find. 

-even Dexter isn't retarded enough to not know to call the chick who blew you in a public restroom the next day. Oh thanks Deb I had no idea.

- pager stuff was stupid as hell. Thanks Masuka for helping with sending a coded message to the chick who blew me but can you get on the blood work of the severed finger of the missing kid?

-imagine writing this episode and thinking a child would have his finger prints in a system somewhere. Imagine writing this episode and thinking it would take 10 seconds to match fingerprints in a massive database in the 90s. I laughed out loud when Dexter said I'll get the bloodwork the next morning. Like I said, I feel like a high school kid wrote this show.

-What was the God damn point of Sarah Michele Gellar in this show? She's done nothing but complain about losing on the horses. I actually thought she'd be responsible for the missing kids cause she needs horse gambling money or some stupid shit. Is this going anywhere, is she going to do something other than obviously die or go to jail?

I'm sorry for ranting but this show could have been great if they just put a tad more thought and care into this.",0,1738002077.0,DexterOriginalSin,23,0.28,False

It started in the Mineral Wells area of the park.

According to [this account](https://www.lafire.com/famous_fires/1933-1003_GriffithParkFire/1933-1003_GriffithParkFire.htm), a man in a dark suit... speculated as possibly a ""Communist""... was seen running away from the initial site of the fire, which seemed unusually smoky for a brush fire, and a coffee can was found near the ignition point.  It's unclear how authoritative this account is, but it does seem to be a serious archive related to the LAFD, and it's linked from the [wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1933_Griffith_Park_fire).

According to the same account, there was at least one other idiot who set a fire in Fern Dell.

With all the above said, it seems to be the case that the backfires set by the groups of untrained workers in the park at the time may have made the fire a lot more destructive.

I would be interested in any other authoritative sources of this account.

1ibfyh8,https://www.reddit.com/r/decaf/comments/1ibfyh8/3_month_report_encouragement/,3 Month Report & Encouragement,"Currently caffeine free (after 15 years) for more than 3 months, wanted to give a quick report and some encouragement for those who are just starting on the journey or considering quitting.

**Pros**

* **Sleep**: Overall the biggest improvement has been sleep. I sleep better than I have in more than a decade. I actually often wake up at 3 or 4 in the morning, feeling fully alert and ready to go. In fact I think this may actually be the biggest contributing factor to the other benefits I’ve seen since quitting.
* **Mood**: I had some pretty bad problems with anxiety, hypochondria, feeling “overwhelmed”, and anger management. I genuinely felt helpless to control my emotional state a lot of the time and it was quite demoralizing. I almost started to think that I must have some sort of mental health problem, be it manic depression or something else. Since quitting I’ve seen a 90%+ improvement in this area. Sure I still get frustrated or worked up sometimes, but I always feel “in control” and can bring myself back down. I generally feel much more even-tempered and calm. It’s crazy to me how much I used to worry about anything and everything, I’m such a chilled out person compared to myself just a few months ago.
* **Productivity**: I used to have a procrastination problem. No more. I’m actually eager to get out and take care of chores, to-do items, little things that would normally annoy me or give me that apprehensive sense of “oh this is going to be such a PITA, can’t I just put it off until tomorrow/next week?”. It seems strange to me now that I would dread doing things that were so easy/took so little time to take care of. I’m also a lot more productive at work. I never get into that manic, hyper-“productive” (but not actually) state that caffeine would get me in - but I’ve since figured out that was mostly an illusion created by the drug and it really wasn’t helping at all.
* **Memory**: I had such a horrible problem with short and medium term memory that I had started worrying about things like early onset Alzheimers and such (probably also a product of hypochondria). My memory is way better now. I used to have to rely on my wife to remember things we needed to take care of, and now it’s the other way around! (I’m working on convincing her to quit as well - wish me luck!).
* **Impulse Control**: I used to have a big problem with impulse control, especially related to buying things. My budget has improved significantly since then as, just like with my mood, I feel much more in control.
* **Hoarding**: I realized since I quit that I had become something of a *minor* hoarder. In my caffeinated state, I would start all sort of “projects” - and leave them half finished around the house/my office. Along with a bunch of stuff that I thought I needed, but never used. Since 3 months ago, I’ve been on an almost non-stop purge. If I can’t find a very compelling reason to keep something I’ve had lying around for a while, it goes either on FB marketplace or in the trash. I literally just filled an entire 15 yard dumpster the other week of junk I had lying around. It feels so nice seeing everything so tidy now! 

**Cons**

* **Digestive Health**: While my GERD (which was pretty bad) has improved significantly, things haven’t been so great on the “other end”. I continue to struggle staying regular since I quit, and I’ve not yet returned to that incredibly consistent “schedule” that coffee had me on. I eat healthy with plenty of pro biotic foods, but I still have to take a supplement every day and find myself using laxatives maybe once a week. Hoping this improves and my body can re-adapt after 15 years of every day coffee. 

**Tips**

* **Teaccino**: It’s really a game changer. I make lattes with it in my espresso machine; dare I say, they taste better than the coffee ones I made previously. 
* **Tapering**: You should plan 2-4 weeks for tapering. Go from car, to half caf, then decaf, then nothing. 
* **Eliminate**: I have tried “quitting” before by switching to decaf. It does not work (for me anyway). IMO in order to maximize benefits you need to quit ALL caffeine - including soda, chocolate, and anything else that has even a little. The difference for me between “low-cut” and non was night and day.

Overall I’d like to really encourage those of you reading with this to either stick with it, or try it out - you have nothing to lose! After being sober for months, I find it crazy that doctors aren’t strongly recommending people with sleep problems and other issues related to caffeine quit before they seek other treatment. I was seeing a sleep specialist because I thought I had sleep apnea (I don’t) - neither they nor my GP ever once told me to quit!

A friend, 30F has asked my boyfriend out for coffee. There's no work connection or it's not like they hang out. Nor do I spend a lot of time with this 30F. My boyfriend 48M has said yes to her. I feel weird. This is the first time this has happened between them. However, she has asked him in the past but he was unavailable. For context: He has gone out to a dinner with other female friends and other situations that has made me uncomfortable. I guess I don't have guy friends that I've gone out to dinner with one-on-one, do lunches or hang out for evening around town.   Part of me knows this could be a insecurity but where is the line. He seems to never say no to these things and I never get the opportunity to say yes to another man (friend or not). ",1,1738001897.0,relationship_advice,16,0.67,False

1ibfu1e,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1ibfu1e/i_f_30_dont_know_what_to_do_in_this_situation/,I (F 30) don't know what to do in this situation with my husband (M 32),"I am now married to my husband (32m) of 4 months and been together for 3 years.. he was initially very funny and cheerful but later he started gambling and lost everything he had and lost everything I had to the last penny we saved up.. he changed a lot then.. I supported him with all I had.. I cooked for him, cleaned, washed his clothes, gave him all my savings, found a job for him.. I was with his at his hardest time of his life.. but it still gotten worse to be a point that I even thought of taking my own life bcs I thought that was more easier than leaving him, I loved him from the bottom of my heart and tbh I still have feelings for him.. however we ended things ( we did not legally get married, it's just church ceremony we did ) and he shifted to a PG and I am now living alone in the house.. 

I started using dating app soon after as a time pass just to get things off from my mind and I found this guy, lets call him M (30M), we started as a fling but later I started getting attached to him because he really care for me, he hold my hands, he listen to me, he give me importance and give his time for me.. he take care of me.. my ex husband never used to hold my hands or never even kiss me or never show any kind of affection or any love.. he had other things in his mind which I kind of understand but now I am with M, it feels like a breath of fresh air, we go out for coffee, talk, laugh and I feel this is the kind of life I wanted.. a simple, a normal life.. 

I am not a luxury person, I come from a low class family so I really know the value of money.. yet I gave all I had to my ex husband thinking one day everything is gonna be fine, but when we were done he texted me that I am the reason he lost everything and I am the bad luck in his life and he lost everything bcs I made a big deal whenever he lose money which is true bcs I really get anxiety whenever he lose the hard earned money I made.. after all I did for him, what I got at end is getting blamed.. 

Now I am really confused that should I give my marriage another shot? It's been only 4 months we are married, what will I tell my family? My society will blame me for everything.. or should I just do whatever makes me feel ok.. or should I just end things with M and focus of my marriage and try to get things together?? 

Did I fuck up everything?? I really don't know what to do or if I am doing the right thing.. I know it's too soon to be with someone again but I am not planning to fall in love with M, I just want to be normal and have a peaceful life, when M is with me I feel so cheerful and happy and life is easy with him.. so please help me.. what should I do? AITA to find someone this fast after ending my marriage??",8,1738001677.0,AITAH,8,1.0,False
