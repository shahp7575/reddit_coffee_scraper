1mk18uw,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1mk18uw,Turbo Moka,"Hello friends, I am Matteo the inventor of Turbo Moka from Milano, Italy.

Many months ago, I, like many Italians, was very disappointed to know that Bialetti was sold to an investment company and decided to re invent the Italian Moka. 

To do this I did not want to just redesign the perfect version of Alfonso Bialetti, but actually I wanted to evolve it for the modern times. The original Moka Express designed almost 100 years ago was perfect but never considered energy efficiency. 

This is what I have done with Turbo Moka, optimised the design of the water chamber for maximum transfer of heat via convection and radiation of the gas flame. The first concept was to incorporate fin technology and increase the surface in contact with the hot gas whilst maintaining the same area in contact with the water. The second concept was to shape the fins so that the hot air would spiral around the water chamber and stay more time in contact with the surface area of the water chamber. After many tries we patented this concept and started making the Turbo Moka in Milan.

The result is the same moka coffee but it uses 30% less energy and time. 
The turbo moka water chamber can be used with the original top moka of Bialetti. At the moment we only have the 3 cup size.

Would love to hear what you think and any questions i am happy to answer them.",1,1754576108.0,turbomoka,0,1.0,False

I ordered my usual, the $9 Biggby Bundle. I usually hand a $20, and ask for a $10 back with them usually putting the change in the tip jar. I did the same today and she said, ""it's actually going to be $10.60, so here's $9.40 back."" I said, for the $9 deal?"" And they're operating under tax is what racked it up. It was not tax. I asked for the receipt and the subtotal is clearly $10. $5.49 minus $1.49 is $4 and $6.99 minus .99 cents is $6. That's $10. I said this is straight up false advertising. They had no explanation and were rude and dismissive to me being upset over $1. I understand service workers don't care about the $1 either. It's not the $1, I promise you, Reddit community, I can afford the dollar. I understand that is a privilege that not everyone has right now. For me, it's the lack of explanation for the upcharge and false advertising. I am willing to obtain legal counsel to explore my options against Biggby Coffee for not honoring the displayed price and giving no written explanation as to why I was upcharged because I am straight up sick of corporations squeezing as much as they can out of little people. I service worker coming in before their shift for a coffee and a sandwich may not be able to eat that upcharge if paying with tips. Or honestly, let's say today I just pulled up with a $10 instead of my usual $20 bill, then I couldn't get my usual. Like to me, it's not the dollar. It's the fact that there is no expressed reason to me paying more, and when I brought it up, everyone treated me like a Karen.

How do you personally fix it?","We're a family of four in a suburban neighborhood.  Between food scraps and coffee grounds, we seem to be overindexed on greens.  To address this:

*  I've gotten in the habit of composting basically every piece of cardboard and paper/junk mail that comes through our house.  
*  When spring rolls around, I mow/bag all the leaves I've let hang out on the lawn over winter for bugs & pollinators.
*  In spring+summer, I bag my grass when I cut it and let it dry out before adding.   
*  Once I hit up a local woodworking shop and grab their excess wood shavings/saw dust.

A tree fell in a nearby park awhile back, was cleaned up and ground into chips and I'm toying with the idea of taking my wheelbarrow over and making that pile just a wee bit smaller.

Erin finding out cacao does exist in the most recent audiobook + my relisten of 11(Titan of Baleros) made me wonder about 2 things that I don't think have gotten resolved in the audiobooks yet:

1. Does Erin find out coffee trees exist as well?
2. Does Olesm ever find out Lism/council rigged the election/does that ever become general knowledge?

I know Lism gets something of a redemption of sorts, but he's still a POS as far as I'm concerned, but he seems to have largely dropped out of the story otherwise.

1mk15ue,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1mk15ue/the_eulogy_system/,The Eulogy System," “Well, this is a nifty bit of kit Ted, this is going to help a fair few people, well done chap!” Mr Long ruffled my hair as he walked back to dressing the body for that afternoon’s funeral at the crematorium. I was used to being his right hand man with these jobs but I had fallen into a bit of luck. I now work for myself , aspiring to go further in tech and research further into Ai systems so thought I’d make a bit of money before going back to university , hence I invented this programme , the eulogy system. During my days of working here, whenever I would talk to families of lost loved ones some people would say they struggle to put their grief and remembrance in a summary while others simply couldn’t find the words. So I thought, hey, if I can relieve that stress of such a difficult time for some families then I believe I am bringing something good into this world. By using some simple prompts and direction, maybe throwing in an odd memory or feeling alongside some simple information about the deceased, the system was able to formulate a sensible, meaningful passage which caught the attention of my old boss Mr Long. Which brings me to here, we now offered a service alongside the funeral cost at no extra charge, but it means I’m getting 10% of the funeral cost afterwards as part of my commission if it is used and with prices today I turn a tidy profit.

However , I think the system is starting to , well , I don’t really know but I don’t know how to stop it , anyway I digress let me explain. Also, to protect the Identities of our deceased clients I shall only be using first names and nothing more, despite the circumstances it doesn’t feel right exposing them.

I had spent 2 months here, rocked up to work like any other day. The funeral home was situated inside an old butchers shop with wide open windows no longer displaying selections of meat but a selection of coffins and flowers. Yellow sand brick faded over time leaving behind a sickly brown colour in need of a power wash that will never come. An oak door gave way into our reception area, the smell of cheap air freshener and formaldehyde hit you like a freight train as soon as you came through the door. Furniture either taken straight from a nursing home or modern enough to think it was from some stylist boutique, a confusing clash of time indeed. The lad who was doing my old job sat behind the desk, Errol, was scrolling through reels without a care as the volume was just a touch too loud. Something about listening to “Top ten Horror movie actors who suspiciously died in real life” or another urban exploring haunted locations didn’t sit right with me in this setting and found it somewhat inappropriate but Eh, Errol seemed nice enough.

“Morning Errol lad, you okay?”

“Shit” Errol threw his phone onto the desk and snapped to attention, indicating to me that he may have got a blocking of Mr Long for being on his phone already. “Morning Ted lad how are you mate? See the footy last night?”

 

“Yeah was a surprising draw to be fair, been a decent season for us so far but I know it’ll turn to shite next week as we usually do”

We both chuckled as I carried on into the back while Errol picked up his phone as unsubtly as possible. We never had loads to talk about but I seemed to find the only other Toffees fan in this town so at least we somewhat bonded over that.

I plonked myself down in my little makeshift office, not disturbing Mr Long as he was on a call to clients but did give me a delicate wave as I went past and opened my laptop. I whacked in the password and opened the programme to what I was expecting the blank prompt screen, however I was met with a fully written eulogy that had already been sent through to print. Odd. Very Odd. Must have been a Glitch in its system so I picked the paper out of the printer with a bit of a tug as it was an old crappy printer to read this:

“Alex was an odd bloke

Died doing what he loved, swimming

Such a shame the electrics system above fried and broke

As it fell in the water leaving nothing but smoke.”

 

What the hell? Don’t get me wrong it’s quite the rhyme but I never put this prompt in, nor had we had any Alex’s on our client list. What was even stranger it listed his death as today? Its highly unusual we would have something written up for the deceased that soon so I just put it down to a system fault and restarted the programme , thought little of it and chucked the paper in the bin. Low and behold the original blank screen was presented to me I was able to start inputting some info for the days funerals along with trying to figure out if this morning’s quip was a bug or glitch. The morning flew by and it was eventually time for lunch and kicked my legs up onto the desk and got out my phone to browse socials. I very quickly lost my appetite shortly after opening up Facebook and reading a news bulletin from our local council’s page.

Leisure centre forced to close today following very unfortunate accident in pool area today – more details will be released my police in coming hours

Additionally power in business area linked with leisure centre is down awaiting maintenance, apologise from croft cuts, Pemberton logistics centre and the Bear trap café.

 

My heart sank, surely this is just a massive coincidence. Yes. Had to be. Two unrelated articles with nothing to do with each other, an ounce of doubt still sat heavy in my mind as I closed social media and got on with the day. A slow day none the less which was unfortunate for me as it allowed me to dwell on the incident at the pool, I thought about going over to the bin a few times to get out the crumpled bit of paper but I couldn’t, instead I threw it into the incinerator in the crematorium next door and thought nothing more of it.

The next day rolled round and I walked to work as my car had decided to give up and die in my drive, leaving me to walk the mile and a half to work in the beautiful British weather we know as rain. I wish it was a light drizzle but it was the type of thin drizzle that soaked you to the bone and hit your face like tiny knives leaving microscopic slices behind. I came in through the door to the lobby to be met by Errol loudly playing some sort of shooting game on his phone.

Without looking up “Morning Ted you alright mate , raining outside today so I’d avoid walking out if your grabbing lunch from Tesco later”

“Yeah thanks for the heads up, much appreciated” I sarcastically replied and all I got from Errol was a quick thumbs up as his gaze did not divert from the screen. I put my things down in the office once more, tapped in the password and I was reluctant to open the programme at first, but as soon as I did a hand placed firmly on my shoulder. I can’t lie this did take me by surprise so I jolted in my seat in panic and spun round to meet Mr Long.

“Morning Ted hope your-“ he removed his hand from my shoulder examining it and continuing “Christ Ted your soaking , have a seat in the Incinerator room in a sec , its warm in there so you should dry quickly” . I nodded as he sighed and said in more of a whispered tone “listen Ted , we have a delicate case coming in soon and the family seem reluctant to cooperate with much as their grief is too heavy so you might have to work your magic with the system to come up with something tangible”

“Sure thing, I can try my best but it may not work as well with limited information but as I said I can only try”

“Brill, thank you Ted, guys names Alex, avid swimmer and family man, bit of an introvert, collected different cricket balls from….” Mr Long’s words became distorted and muffled as the colour began to drain from my face and I began to physically shake. Mr Long waved his hand in front of my face questioning “Hello? Ted you in there? You look a bit peaky lad, go get warm and I can provide your old uniform to wear for today” he handed me over a bundled collection of a white dress shirt, black suit and long deep blue tie, I was about to leave when the printer made a horrendous churning and grunting sound as it squeezed out another bit of paper, I took it out and with me to the crematorium and sat opposite the incinerator, a warm hug of heat tried to comfort me as I read:

 

Soph was quiet, never caused trouble of fuss

She was quite dull but my god could she bake

Till one day she went out and was hit by a bus

And now she’s as flat as a pancake

 

Once more I Panicked and realised the time was stamped as well as todays date and the time indicated was in half hour. Instantly I threw the paper into the fire and tried to block it out. Surprisingly I was most concerned at how jovial these glitches seemed, no compassion or care but as if someone found it funny like some sick joke. After a moment of contemplation I whipped out my phone and started looking for bus times, maybe this wasn’t a glitch and maybe I could stop it? I scrolled through different times and bus routes trying to find one that met the half hour space I had. I must have been looking much longer than I thought as I heard I violent screech and commotion from outside. I smartened up quickly slotting the wrong buttons into the wrong holes and throwing my tie on messily as I ran. Outside was a sight so grizzly I shuffled back and was sick in the large flower pot just outside the Crematorium, a beautiful rainbow of colour now turned a sandy beige with pops of carrot and sweetcorn. I am reluctant to go into the detail of what happened but I can assure you nothing about it resembled a pancake. The side of the green bus now pebble dashed with red. I was too late.

The street was blocked off and luckily all funerals that day were transferred to our sister location about 5 miles away so I was glad these families were not put out. Mr Long sent myself and Errol home and I’m happy he did or I would have had to have taken sick leave. I sat at home that night feeling responsible for something too grand and consistent to just be coincidence. In the panic I’d left my laptop at work so was unable to do anything now to stop it so I just sat up and waited for the next day to roll round so I could shut it down. I sat in my armchair for what seemed like hours watching as the deep blue sky leaked into purple, pink, orange until my alarm went off. I was still fully dressed and sleep deprived so made a black coffee in my travel mug to go. I rocked up outside and saw the nothing left but the tire marks from yesterday , everything else was back to normal and if you hadn’t of known would of thought someone had just been a bit heavy on the breaks. I walked in and must have been early as Errol was nowhere to be seen and Mr Long was in his office eating a bowl of cornflakes without a shirt on. I knew things were bad at home and just hope he hadn’t been kicked out and was sleeping here , I felt to awkward to ask and he would have been too ashamed if he had noticed me so thought it’d be wise not to bring attention. I paused as I entered the office to see that several had been printed out all with times already passed which I began to get frustrated by knowing that it was my fault, I shouldn’t have been so careless leaving it all hooked up still. However the last one made me pause for a moment:

We a gathered here to remember Mary

She was good and kind hearted every day and all night

However what happened to her was quite scary

When she was hit by bricks from great height   

 

Time stamped for 45 minutes time.

I racked my brain thinking of what I could do to save her as there was a chance, slim but a definite chance. It glared at me like a sick riddle till an idea popped into my head. They were renovating the Isaiah Hotel on the other side of town after the roof caved in following a storm. It was about a 30 minute run so I dropped the pile of paper and ran. I was wearing my brown slip on brogues so I just knew it was going to leave some blisters but the pain of those would not surpass the pain I would inevitably feel if I was responsible for yet another travesty. I ran faster than I thought my legs were able to carry me. I’m a portly gentleman so the fact I was able to run like this was a minor miracle, I had to stop every five minutes or so to take a strained puff of my inhaler before starting again. I felt the reverberations shoot up my legs into the rest of my body which made me feel painfully unwell. I reached the hotel and looked up to see it was enrobed with scaffolding and people either standing around sipping cans of monster or hurling bricks around , precariously near the top I saw a pile of bricks organised like a tiny red pyramid. It looks like I had arrived in the nick of time as walking below I saw a younger woman , headphones in without a care in the world walking directly below.

“MARY! LOOK OUT!” I started to run across the road to her, soon as she clocked on to me she looked in disgust as this big stranger hurtled towards her shouting her name.

“Aww get away from me you bloody weirdo!” she ran off in the other direction. Not the response I thought I’d get after saving her life, not that she knew what was planned. Behind me I heard the bricks fall followed by an “Ash Greg you fucking idiot, what have I said about leaving them there, someone could have been killed!”

 

I made my way back to the funeral parlour, sweating and panting as I Tumbled through the door. Still no sign of Errol. I must admit I felt smug, I found out a way to beat the system and now it was time to shut it down till I could find what was wrong with it. My smugness quickly depleted when I saw my screen up with the programme on, it simply read:

“You shouldn’t have done that, Ted”

An Ice cold shiver ran up my spine after reading those words, I didn’t have too much time to dwell in the fear though as the printer slipped out another bit of paper:

 

Errol was complicated, like a game of chess

He was destined for greatness, we would have raised a cup

Till stupid Ted stepped in and made a great mess

His surgery didn’t go to plan today, so he’ll never wake up

 

I froze. My stomach turned and sank. My heart followed too. What have I done?

 

The phone began to ring from Mr Long’s office, confirming the news I had just read. I sat at my desk and sobbed. This was all my fault, I’ve created this mess and I needed to stop it. Through tears I went back on my laptop and tried tirelessly to shut it down but, I couldn’t. I was met with obstacles and barriers of which I’d never seen , code which I hadn’t written and hope that was slowly grinded down to nothing by the end of the day , I failed , I just disconnected it and stuck it in my bag , at least now it wasn’t connected to the printer.

 

Some time had passed and even today Mr Long asks when the system would be back up and running, to which I tell him that I was still experiencing bugs with it, and with Errol’s absence I found myself slipping into my old role anyway so didn’t have time to tinker with it, not that I wanted to, to be honest. It was surreal seeing Errol in the place our clients would lie on that table, dressed in a beautiful pressed suit and football scarf I gifted to him to take with him to the next place. His family would come in too from time to time just to be with him. We wouldn’t normally let families come in as much as they did but we made an exception. I visited their home from time to time bringing flowers or just to keep his parents a bit of company which I think they appreciated. The new hire had started today and was using my makeshift office as they were doing more admin work for us too. A sweet young woman straight from college, Lyra. She was completely new to any of this but seemed to be quite on it with wanting to learn and get involved. However, as I write this I wish she wasn’t so enthusiastic.  She approached me near the end of shift –

“Hey Ted , fab day thank you so much for being so helpful I really appreciate it ! Random one I know, I found a laptop in there and thought ‘score!’ so I hooked it up and well… Well come have a quick look”

My vision went blurry and I could feel sick begin to bubble up from my stomach knowing exactly what she found. Open on the screen was the programme I tried so hard to destroy. I had a small fleeting feeling of relief when there was nothing on the screen, this feeling did not last long though as I saw there was a printed piece of paper, on the floor that had fallen from the printed tray. With shaky clammy hands I picked it up and held it up so I was able to see. Through welled up shaky vision I saw the words:

 

Tick Tock Ted.

I didn’t miss sugar at all for almost two months. The only time I *felt* like I couldn’t have it—rather than just not wanting it—was during social gatherings where some desserts are just too nostalgic to ignore.

I started looking into zero-calorie sweeteners. I wasn’t optimistic at first—Stevia left a bad impression—but after some research, I found monk fruit sweetener and decided to give it a shot. Holy moly… it’s *almost* sugar. There’s a slight fruity aftertaste and maybe a textural difference, but only if you’re really paying attention. For someone unsuspecting, like my sister who I made try it, it’s practically indistinguishable. It honestly feels like I’m cheating.

First,  I had Wrigley doing his job. Made a square of meadows,  and I watched a single extra grass tile appear outside of the new meadow.  Just the one. Like the grass was expanding. Did that to a few of them, and just one extra square ever appeared. Idk if it's  done it before and I just never noticed, but this time I saw it.

Second. So I'm  sure I'm not the only one that uses those two corridors between GG and SS to meet the water/meadow/forest count. 

I meet all the water needs for the tablet and bench by just flooding one of the corridors. Then I scoop it all out, clean out the dry grass and start laying down the green stuff.

This happened a couple of times in both corridors. A couple times, I put down grass balls, but Wrigley didnt do anything,  the arid earth just kinda...exploded and made that sound that trees make when you hit them with the Ultimallet, and all the tiles turned into meadow all at the same time. 

I have a mission that I give myself that the places that aren't meadow and forest,  I use a scarecrow to turn all the bad dirt into good dirt.  It looks better,  imo. Anyway, in each of those corridors, on two separate occasions,  when I put down a scarecrow,  the same exploding thing happened and turned into good earth.  But not all the squares did. In each one, about four tiles were the rocky earth or whatever it's  called (still working on coffee lol), in various places in the new earth. So I had to pick up the scarecrow and put it back down to get Wrigley to clean up those four squares.

Let's go to bed, come on, let's go. - Okay. - All right. Bedtime. Let's go, let's go, let's go. - Bret, turn off the TV. - After this game. You gotta get some sleep, buddy. If you pass your driver's test tomorrow, then you can drive a real car. Wouldn't that be somethin'? This is kinda like practice, Dad. Oh, well, this wouldn't be confusing or distracting. Come on, Dad. - Is this a problem for you? - Dad. - I'm so sorry. - You're gonna make me crash! I'm a pedestrian! I'm a pedestrian, look out! Don't hit the pedestrians! Oh, my gosh, I'm so sorry. Go to bed. Love you. Toby, shut the TV. All right, pal, it's just you and me, so you know what that means. Snack time. One for me. And one for you. Mm, I got my snack, buddy. Here's yours. Good catch. Activate tactical vest. Agent Toby Barks, do you read me? Agent Toby Barks, come back. Hold your horses, lady. I mean, reporting for duty, ma'am. That's more like it. How's that Bark Link working? I've made some modifications. Seems to be working great. I feel like I could ♪ sing! ♪ Great, hold that song for later. We have business to tend to. Oh, fine, I'm all ears. Agent Prescott will brief you at the mobile command unit. - Roger. - Gear up, and meet at the extraction point. Better get my tail movin'. It's go time. Yeah. Agent Barks, welcome to the party. Let's go. Don't have to tell me twice. All systems online. Looks like the team's all here. Agent Prescott, let's go. Meet Horrace the Horrible. He's big, he's nasty, and he loves money. He runs an evil faction out of an old nightclub on the edge of town. He's hired rogue hackers to spread a virus within the American banking system. His ultimate plan is to shut down Wall Street, creating an economic downswing worse than the Great Depression. He always rolls with a pack of very mean, very dedicated bodyguards. He is considered to be extremely dangerous. This man must be stopped. That's where Toby here comes in. The Horrible Compound is known for its tight security. Agent Barks can infiltrate the building and shut down the security system, allowing agents in through the undefended flanks east and west of the main building. - You be careful in there, Agent Barks. - Copy that. Have no fear, buddy. We're watching your every move. I got this, no problem, Jack. Toby, you've got company. Copy that. I can smell 'em. Activate stink canister. It stinks! Threat neutralized. Stinky job, but somebody's gotta do it. West wall is clear, repeat, all clear on the west wall. Nice work. Move in. Ray Ray, remember that vault job in Rhode Island? That's peanuts to this! - We're gettin' paid, boys. - Yeah! Third door on the left. That's the security hub, but be careful. You need to get by the main ""foryer."" It's foyer. That place is crawlin' with guards. - Double D. - A crawling joke? This is the big job! Soon, we will destroy Wall Street. Whoo, let's go! The markets will crash! Yeah! That's it, Toby, that's the main hub. You're doing fantastic. Now plant that virus, and let's go home. The country will crumble! It's time that we take over! Yeah! Okay, let's see here. - Come on, come on - Toby, look out. Two bogies headin' your way and fast. Repeat, two bogies! Yeah! Come on, come on, come on. Aw! - Look at this little guy! - Oh, somebody wants a belly rub! This must be Horrace's new dog. - Hey, he kinda looks like him. - Yeah, he does. - Don't tell him I said that. - Mm, no, I won't. Oh, boy, yeah. Better get goin'. Fools. Works every time. Those typing classes came in handy. What is this? I don't know. No. It's not responding! It's not. Sound the alarms! They're coming for us. Here's a little goin' away present, fellas. He did it. All their systems are down. Yes! Get Agent Barks out of there, and send in the cavalry. Toby, the back window to the rear courtyard is open and clear. No! All right. Woo-hoo! All right! Mission accomplished, baby! Yeah. Proud to know you, Agent Barks. Couldn't have done it without you. You gotta love it. One more bad guy off the Most Wanted list, one more dangerous raid with nobody hurt on either side. He's a fine agent, sir. Figured nothin' like a smoke show to add a little excitement to the dance floor. Hey, Toby. I figured I'd throw you a bone. This guy gets it. Hawk, you're the man. Thank you, but I gotta take that bone to go. Need to get back before my people wake up and notice I'm gone. Of course. Later, Toby. Agents, we were all just in the presence of greatness. We could all learn a lot from that dog. That dog is one of a kind. Wouldn't the world be a happier place if there were a million others just like him? Uh, yes, sir, Mr. Albright. Yes, sir, I'll have that report in by the end of the day today, sir. Yes, sir, no problem. Uh, no. No, no, fishing trip? No, sir, I haven't heard anything about that yet. This is the first thing I've heard. No... yes, sir, yes, of course, yeah. Absolutely, I can make that happen. Yes, sir. Okay, I'll see you at the office then, sir. Thank you so much. Great. Oh, boy. How am I gonna make this happen? Kids, let's go, come on! Let's move, move, move! Let's go, let's go, let's go! We're gonna be late. - Morning, Daddy. - Good morning, sweetheart. Wow, look at... That is a very, very festive outfit. Thanks, I like all the colors. - What's for breakfast? - Breakfast, um... ♪ Doughnuts! ♪ I got doughnuts. - Doughnuts are for breakfast. - Doughnuts are for breakfast, sweetheart! - Oh, wow, doughnuts? - Look at that! - Ah, sick! - I know, right? Oh, hey, I hear today's a big day. Yep, my boy's gonna ace his driver's test. Yeah, can't wait. Just me, the open road, Dad's beat up old Honda with the busted air conditioner. - Gonna be great. - That's a great car. You should be very lucky to have that car. - You're welcome. - Kate, the bus is here. Coming, Bretty. Bye, Dad, bye, Dave. Bye, sweetheart, I love you... okay. Hey, thank you for comin' through with those doughnuts. Big win. Yeah, I mean, I know it hasn't been easy without Diane. Can you believe it's been a year already? It's not getting easier, you're right. Well, if we get this promotion, you'll have less work, more money, more time to spend with the kids. - That's a good point. - And then I get to have your job. Uh, yeah, no, I don't think so. You're jumpin' the g\*n there a little bit, big guy. Well, rumor has it that Albright is ready to promote the both of us. We just need to seal the deal on this fishing trip. - Oh, the fishing trip. - It's great, right? No, it's terrible. It's a scheduling nightmare for me. I gotta find someone to watch the kids. Ted, you're doing this for those kids. It's for their future. You're fishing for their future. I guess I could call my sister. Oh! Oh, of course, yes, yes! Whatever you need, I'm there! Okay, okay. I-I'll... I'll get my stuff, and I will stop by after work. This is such a great surprise. I can't wait to see everyone! - Hello. - Oh. - Hungry? - Oh, no, thank you. Oh, come on! Look, it's juicy, take a bite. I don't doubt that they are, but I really don't... okay. So, what are you workin' on, huh? Oh, well, I was just making some modifications to the B Link. Oh, you mean the world's greatest invention? - You're a genius. - Thanks. Yeah. So, that's so top secret, I've always wondered, how do we deal with the plans for that sort of thing? Where-where do we keep those plans? Well, they're filed away. Why do you wanna know? Shop talk. Inside baseball. Chit-chat. You don't have clearance, so there's really no point in my telling you. I could get clearance. Brr, got cold in here. Oh, nice talk. All the key ingredients for an epic weekend with Auntie B. Well, I didn't think I'd be seeing you again so soon, huh? Really nice of you to help out. Well, it's a great opportunity for me to catch up with the niece and nephew before I blink and they're off to college. But there is one thing I wanna make very clear. The kids cannot know about what we do. If they were to ever find out, we'd be putting them in incredible danger. - Agreed. - Okay, good. Now, do you mind? I have to go to the bathroom. Stay! How was your driver's test? Um, it was great. I aced it, yeah. - Can we go for a ride? - Um, maybe tomorrow. Yes! - Hi, Auntie B! - I have missed you so much! - Auntie B! - Oh! Oh, Bret, you are now taller than me! How did that happen? Vegetables? Missed you too, Auntie B. Yeah, we did. Hey, today's not a holiday. No, I don't think so. What do you mean? Well, usually you only come on holidays. - Oh. - Dad's home. - Ha! - Dad, Auntie B's here! Ah, yeah, I know. Hey, you! - Hi! - Hi, sweetheart, my little sis. Good to see you, sis. She's here because she's gonna stay the weekend. Daddy has to go schmooze his boss on a fishing trip. Daddy, what does schmooze mean? It's like being extra nice to somebody so they'll be nice to you in the long run. Oh, so kinda like kissing up to your teacher but for grownups? Yes, that's exactly what it's like, Miss Smartypants. Geez. Hey. How'd the test go? Um, it was good, I nailed it. I have a ton of homework and a book report. I am so far behind. You know, actually, I should get on it right now. Well, that's a first. Anybody hungry? Come here you. You I gotta feed, I know I have to feed you. I guess this is the closest I'm gonna get to a car this summer. I could've swore I passed it. Come in. I'm not mad. But I was doing the laundry and I found this. Well, now you know. Why'd you lie? I didn't wanna let you down. Buddy... Making a mistake is not letting me down. Lying to me is. All right? Lying is like driving a car in reverse. Okay? I don't care how good you are at it, you're still going backwards. I was just embarrassed. Why? So what? I failed my first driving test. - Really? - Miserably. Like, not even close. What do I tell the other kids? Forget them. Your real friends won't care. I guess bad driving runs in the family. Yeah, we don't have to tell anybody else though, okay? That's our secret. - You okay? - Yeah. All right. If you fail the next one, I'm gonna k\*ll you. Gummy worms before bed? I like your style, kid, but I'm not so sure I can allow that. They're not for me, they're for you, silly. Really? Yes, you can use them as bait on your fishing trip. Oh, sweetheart, I appreciate that, but I don't think the fishies like candy as much as we do. No, look, they do. Fish are known to be attracted to the bright colors of the gummy worms. - Look at that! - Yeah, and it even says if you keep your line just above the water, it can catch the light. I guess it makes them all shiny. Well, you are my little Einstein. Thank you very much. Hey, you better hit the road if you're gonna get to the lake by daybreak. All right, all right. Listen, you have fun with your Auntie B, okay? - Sweet dreams and jellybeans. - And gummy worms. And gummy worms. Toby... here, buddy. I got a little something for you. Listen, I know my sister's here this weekend, but you and I know who's really in charge, okay? It's you. Thanks, buddy. - He understands every word I say. - Yeah, go have some fun. I have everything under control here. Don't even think about it, Toby. - What smells so good? - Oh! - Whoa! - Order up! I wish we could have breakfast like this every day. There's the genius! Workin' on your day off? Oh, Agent Lane! Everything okay? Oh, great, great, great, couldn't be better. Brought you some coffee. Cream, no sugar. - Just the way you like it. - Oh, thanks. Um... So how'd you know to track me down here? I'm a federal agent, it's what we do. I guess... guess that's true. Actually, I wanted a little time just me and you away from the office. Oh. - Go on... - It's about the B Link. The ability to translate barking into words. I mean, who knew that ""woof woof"" meant, ""How you doin', Charlie?"" Ha. You made it possible for man's best friend to actually be man's best friend. Well, the frequencies were always there. - It was just a matter of deciphering... - No, you! You made them talk. I didn't make them talk, Agent Lane. Dogs have been talking since the beginning of time. I just found a way for us to listen to them. - Well, listen to this... - What's this about? What if I told you that I could put $20 million in your pocket today and offer you a partnership in my new enterprise, Lane Technologies? Which will be worth billions for all of us very soon, I assure you. All you would have to do... Leave out the plans for the B Link, accidentally, casually, so I could take a few quick snaps of them, huh? - Okay, okay. - Uh-huh, yeah? That's a good joke. No, no, no, this is anything but a joke. I have an associate at the largest overseas tech company who is willing to pay a fortune for those plans. You really aren't joking, are you? You don't realize what you have here! You have invented the most important device of the history of mankind and animalkind. I mean, every little boy is gonna wanna come home and hear about the dog's day. Every little girl will be able to say, ""Fluffy, how you feeling?"" ""I ate a paperclip."" Or you could be on vacation and call home, and Bowser can say, ""I chased a burglar away."" The possibilities are endless for this invention and the marketing, the social media, the interactive games... We've got a goldmine! But I didn't invent the B Link to cash in. I invented it to help people. Well, it could still help people, only in a different way. - Not a chance. - Well, I don't think you understand... You know, why don't we pretend that this is all a big joke and act like it never happened, hm? Otherwise, I'm gonna report you so fast that your tie will spin right off your shirt collar. Ouch. So that's the way you wanna play it? Oh, that's exactly how I wanna play it. Okay, so it's all a big joke. Yeah, you owe me $5 for the coffee. Joking! Big joke. Enjoy your day, partner. All righty, we score big with the boss this weekend, we earn ourselves the Empress account along with a couple of promotions. Yeah, well, you're in luck, buddy, 'cause I can fish like a grizzly bear. I'll believe it when I see it. - Mm-hmm. - Oh, here he comes. Shall we do battle with Neptune, boys, hm? Test our mettle against man's oldest adversary? - Huh? - I think he wants to know - if we're ready to fish. - Oh, yeah, absolutely. - Bait me up, Teddy. - Yes, sir. I'm glad you boys could make it. You know there's a legendary fish in this lake? And I'm gonna catch it. The bad guys are getting smarter every day, so we've gotta keep one step ahead of them. - Are you ready? - Born ready, baby. Okay. This looks like a regular tennis ball, right? Right. All right, take a good chew. Yeah, one good bite and it's lights out for 30 seconds. It cuts the power and stops any signal of any kind. Snap into that bad boy, and everything within a 100-foot radius goes back to the Stone Age. Wow, that would come in handy when it's time to make a quick getaway. - Mm-hmm. Yeah. - I'll take it. Hey, what's in here? Oh, oh, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop. Um, this? This is the Crossbone, and it is, perhaps, my finest invention, but it is not ready yet, so paws off, please. - All right, all right. - Oh, yes, yes, yes. I give you the cam collar. - Hey, you're on TV. - Mm-hmm. We see everything you see. Wow. It's incredible, you really outdid yourself. Oh, you know. Eh? Look at that. That was a nice cast. Oh, hi! There's my favorite kids in the galaxy. Whoa... - Auntie B, are you okay? - I'll call for help. No, no, no, no, I'm fine. Just a little slip. Good, you scared me. Yeah, that was a pretty hard fall. That was nothin'. Whatcha workin' on there? I am glad that you asked. I know that your dad needs a little help around the house, and after you enjoyed breakfast so much, I said to myself, ""How can I ensure that my favorite kids in the galaxy have the most important meal of the day every day?"" And so I whipped up... - the Diner Drone! - ♪ Diner Drone ♪ The Diner Drone. I like the name. It is easy to use, so check it out. You see our funnels here, yes? So you just put in basic breakfast ingredients, like syrup... Or flour... your sugar, and I know you like that. And just a little bit of bacon, just a little. - Can I try one? - Crack away. All right, now we get to customize our settings. So scrambled. Scrambled, right? All right. Okay, and you might want to step aside a little bit. I've never really tested this thing out. And if it smokes, that's normal, so... Now basically, your standard ordinary breakfast takes approximately nine minutes to create from start to finish, but the Diner Drone accomplishes the whole thing in 18 seconds. Don't ask me how I do it, it's top secret. Oh! And just because it's a shame to waste food, - this is an after-school snack. - Thanks! Can you believe we get to eat breakfast like this every day? How did you do this in just a few hours? That's also top secret. What's the matter with these fish? I got good bait. Are they too good for my bait? They're just not bitin', sir. Thanks, master of the obvious. You know, I brought you two out here to see if you were lucky. Lucky, sir? I always say it's better to be lucky than good. In business, it takes a lot of luck to become successful, and there's no better judge of a man's luck than by how the fish bite. I see. Well, then, I say we change our luck, sir. - I don't follow. - Well, we've been fishing this exact same spot all day without so much as a nibble. I say we go fish that little point right there underneath those trees? I'll bet you that big, glorious fish is just sittin' under there in the shade waiting for us to come over there tomorrow, catch him, and put him inside your cooler. I like your moxie, Theodore. All right. Tomorrow morning, we hit that spot at dawn. Now let's make camp before it gets too dark. Yes, sir. Auntie B, why are we at an old, empty grocery store? Well, it's not the old, empty grocery store I'm after. It is the old, empty parking lot. - Hop out of the car, Bret. - Huh? Hop out of the car, switch places with me, mm? What is she doing? You are about to enroll in the Auntie B Driving Academy. Whew! So... ahem. The key to operating a motor vehicle is simple but very crucial. It's all about sight lines, my young friend. You are aware of everything in your environment at all times, including the ignition. Start the car. Yeah! Yeah... - Lane? - Hi. What are you doing here? Oh, nothing of any interest whatsoever. I... you know, I was just tryin' to catch up, and, you know, get ahead of the game. Heh. You know, success favors the diligent. That's what I say. Yeah? Oh, well, we're both very wise. So what are you doing here? - Same, just... work. - Oh, well. - Good for you. - Work to do. Good for you. A busy agent is a great agent. So, let's get back to it, shall we? - All right. - All right. - Later. All right. - Yes, much later. - Good night, Agent Prescott. - Good night, Lane. Yes, good night. Where was I? Baddies, bullies, charming sociopaths, cheaters, crackpots, creeps, crooks, deranged psychopaths... Ah-ha! Dangerous maniacs... and there he is. Sunny Wolf. Takes a big bad wolf to catch a chatty little dog. 100! 101! 102! Keep going! You got this, yeah! It's for you. Wolf here. Hello there, Mr. Wolf. This is Benedict N. Lane from Lane Technologies, and I have a rather lucrative offer for you, sir, for a man of your specific skill set and expertise. I'm listening. Oh, you're interested. What, you're throwing sharks at me? - That makes no sense. Makes no sense. - Come on, come on. - Move it or lose it, lady. - Oh, ho, ho! Oh, yeah! Who taught you how to drive, huh? Just my awesomely wacky aunt. Whoa! Hmm! - No, no, no, no, no! - Come on. - Oh. - Yes! Hey, come on! Well, your awesomely wacky aunt is quickly becoming your awesomely old aunt. I'm ready for bed. Oh, wow, look at this! Check out the masterpiece. That is really something. I'm getting sleepy too, Auntie B. Why don't we call it a night, and you go get ready, - and I'll tuck you in? - Okay. - I'm gonna head up, too. - Hmm. Thanks again for the driving lesson. You'll be on the road in no time. We'll try to get another lesson in tomorrow. Awesome. Night, Auntie B. Goodnight, Toby. Come on. Ah-ha. I'll grab the pooch, you get the old lady. Got it. Get off, you stupid mangy dog! - Bretty, I heard a noise. - So did I. Maybe Auntie B's just getting a snack. That doesn't sound like a snack. You stupid! - Toby! - Wait. It might not be safe out there. Grab his things to keep him quiet. You, you don't have to do this. - Stay. - Let's go. Come on, lady. Get in the van, lady. - Someone's got Auntie B! - Call 911! - Will you shut that dog up? - Yeah, yeah. Here, do you want the ball? Do you want the ball? - The phone won't work. - What? It won't even turn on. Someone must've cut the phone line. They're gonna get away! Not if I can help it. Stay here. I'm coming with you. - What was that? - I don't know! It won't start. It won't start! Well, did you try turning the key? Ah-ah-ah, don't make me snap it. Work, work, work. Whoo! Back in business. - What about the dog? - Forget about the dog. Let's get out of here before the cops come. Yeah, go! They're all gone. - Toby? - Toby! Where is he going? Hold up. Be careful, there may be aliens. I don't think it's aliens. Let's stay close. This is Agent Toby Barks requesting Agent Laura Prescott. Security clearance 1-1-5-6-2-4-5. Repeat, Agent Barks for Agent Prescott, security clearance 1-1-5-6-2-4-5. Do you copy? This is Agent Barks, do you copy? Does anybody read me? Hello? Code red, can you read me? This is not a drill. Repeat, this is not a drill. This just keeps getting weirder and weirder. Anybody? Anybody at all? Can anyone hear me? Answer. Uh, hi, guys. This can't be real. - Toby? - Uh, hi, guys. Toby, are you talking? No, I'm just... I... yes. Auntie B gets snatched in the middle of the night, thrown in to a van, our dog is talking to us, and we're in the middle of some kind of, I don't know, secret base. - Is this a secret base? - It's the Barkcave. Right, the Barkcave, makes sense. I know what this is. We're still sleeping. This is a dream, I'm dreaming. I already pinched myself six times. This is real. Kate's right, this is very real. Don't have time to explain it. Well, excuse me for being a little weirded out that my dog is talkin' to me right now. Look, I'm not just your dog. I'm a highly trained government agent. Your Auntie B and I work for a top secret organization. You've gotta be kidding me! So you're like a 00-doggie? Will you just listen? We're running out of time! Auntie B invented some real game-changing gadgets and someone must be after her. - Who do you think it is? - Well, only a few people know where to find Auntie B this weekend. Sadly, they all work for the agency. So, that means? That means someone from the inside double-crossed us. Computer, locate van make and model. Can't be too many of those on the road in this area. Computer, I need an engine sound match on a '96 Bounder. Activate the doggie ear. - That's them? - Bingo. That's the access road near the school. Shouldn't you call backup or something? I need to handle this myself. I can't trust anyone yet. You can trust us. I'm coming with you. Me, too. Oh, no, you're not. We're Auntie B's family! We're not just gonna sit around while someone breaks into our house and takes her. Absolutely not! Your safety has been jeopardized enough as it is. It's just too dangerous. Well, if you don't let us come, we'll tell Daddy and everyone will know that you're a secret agent. Ah, poop! - You're driving. - What? - You heard me. - I don't even have my license. Well, my paws don't reach the pedals, and we're tails-deep in a government emergency here. So I think we can make an exception. I believe in you. You're the man for this mission. Now, let's go before I lose the scent. You can do this. Be the road. The road and you. Hm. You got this, kid. Just focus on the yellow lines. My dog is giving my brother driving tips. Okay, what's it say, Kate? Um, okay, take a left up ahead. Left up ahead, got it. Now, 100 feet, turn signals. Come to a complete stop, check all directions for oncoming traffic. - Good, good. - Okay. Okay, slowly accelerate into the turn. Okay, now what? Um, take a right on Davison Ave. Take a right! Okay, got it. What's next? Um, that's where the signal ends. No way they're still gonna be there. Don't worry, I'll smell 'em the rest of the way. Huh? - Left! Go left! - What? Left! He said go left! - Straight! - Straight. I like that one, it's easy. Oh, brother. Oh, Bretty? I think they want you to pull over. Yeah, it's the fuzz. Pull over. Oh, man! Now I'm never gonna get my license. I'll be banned for life! Brett, relax! I'll do the talking. Okay, everybody, keep cool. Keep your cool. I got this. License and registration, please. Evening, officer. What seems to be the problem? I'm sorry, was I speeding? I really didn't think so. This is a 35, right? We had reports of a van speeding through a minute ago. Guess I got the wrong one. Oh, I see. Well, have a nice night, officer. Yeah, you guys take care. Stay safe! Wow, I gotta cut back on the overtime. I cannot believe that worked. Works every time, baby. All right, let's get back on the scent. Guys, it's Auntie B! Bingo! Nice spot, Kate! Okay, I need you two to stay in here. Let me guess, it's too dangerous for kids? No. Well, yes, but the truth is, I need you in here. Everything I see will be transmitted on that tablet. I may need you for some intel if I get in a jam, so be on the ready to haul out of here once I rescue Auntie B. Got it. It's go time. Paws in the middle! Barks! Auntie B! No, no, no! What do you mean... ...you couldn't get the dog? I could've hired a dog catcher for far less money and better results! If I knew we had to nab some secret agent dog, I would've asked for more money. Not some secret agent dog, a talking secret agent dog! Well, since you got half your job done, I will offer you half of the money, and you're still security until this whole thing is over. And if you have a problem with it... I'll just call my friends and tell them all about you. No problem. ""No problem."" Good answer. Will you stop squirming? Geez! ♪ Auntie B, Auntie B ♪ ♪ Oh my favorite money tree ♪ - Bazooka? - Mm. It's my favorite. Well, later. I came to you, and I offered you a deal, and you gave me a flat no, not knowing that I'm the kind of guy you never say no to. My mother used to call me ""tenacious."" She called me ""solipsistic,"" too. That was when I was six, and ""Mr. Smartypants"" when I was 27. But I'll show you, Mommy! I'll show all of you. You'll never get away with this, Lane! Oh, won't I? Is that your expert opinion? I think I already have! Because no one knows you're here. Ladies and gentlemen, I introduce to you Dr. Bonnie Barks! We're old chums and collaborators... for huzzum huzzum years. She's the new head of research and development at Lane Technologies, but you can call her... - Auntie B. - Oh, yay! You're all breaking the law! This man is a traitor to the United States, and you're just as guilty as he is if you don't free me at once! Oh, that's good, that's good, appeal to their consciences. You don't know that they're paid so much they don't have any. What do you want from me? Don't you know with that brilliant bulb of a brain of yours? I want that B Link! I want schematics, I want plans, I want data. I wanna know how to make that dog talk! Years of hard work and research just thrown away on consumerism? It's a real shame. Shame on you. My mommy used to say, ""Self, self, self, why don't you think about me?"" Well, I'm not giving you anything, not one shred of information. Well, then my associates are right here, and they are experts at extracting all the information I need. How you doin', Auntie B? What's that? I don't know, but it's blue. What does that mean? Well, all the people have been red dots, and Toby's a blue dot... So that means there's another dog? Toby, I think there's another dog, and he's coming your way. Don't do it. Don't... don't... What was that? Good ol' Angus must've found somethin'. Fan out, fan out and find out what that is. Uh-oh... Whoa! Whoa! Yes! Ow, ow, that was the dog. That was Toby! Come on, you imbeciles! Get me my talking dog! Activate Mr. Sandman. Ooh. Angus? Half-wits? What are you doing sleeping in the middle of the night? I was just resting my eyes. Geez. Mommy, I don't wanna go to school today. I'm afraid to ask this, but do I look like your mother? Get up, get up! Go, go, go! We're losing him! Go, go, go, go! - Go, go! - Sleepin' on the job. Aw, no! You brainless imbeciles let him get away! - We'll go find him! - We got it! No, no, don't go anywhere! I need you here. I gotta get this show on the road. All right, tighten security. Hire reinforcements. Do something to help me! I have to go have a little chat with our guest. Oh... Round up some g\*ons. We got a job to do. Sure thing! I'll just go put an ad in the crime paper! Well, we didn't get what we came for, but we made it out of there in one piece. But how are we gonna save Auntie B? Don't worry, kid. I have a plan. Good. A plan is good. At first I didn't know who I could trust within the agency. Now that we know Agent Lane's the crooked one, I can get by with a little help from my friends. I finally figured out what the B in Auntie B stands for... the best and the brightest! Oh, Bonnie, you truly are a genius. Oh, can it, Lane! Ooh, I am sincere. I speak from my heart's core. Look at these scientists! My scientists, the best that money could buy! The greatest minds in the universe! Nobel Prize winners! All of them working for what seems like an eternity trying to create what you have already created. You know, billions and billions of overseas dollars from my investors have gone into supporting them trying to do what you've already done. We attempted on every single kind of species. We tried a parrot. A goat. A bunny, a turtle, a mouse, a horse! Say ""not by the hair of my chinny-chin-chin."" All right, BLTs for lunch! We even tried a fish. We got the same results every time. Guess what? We got nothing! I thought the cat would work, I was sure! And we got something, we did. I thought every little child would wanna say good night to his own little kissy kitty cat, and I would be so rich! Ew, humans, gross! Please give me my space. You there, fathead, what's for lunch? Fathead, fathead! Fathead, fathead! I'm talking to you! Mouthy little furballs, aren't they? ""Fathead."" That really hurt. You were a good agent, Lane. I was not only a good agent, I was a great agent! I was an excellent agent! But Uncle Benny's got a mortgage. You see what I drive? Well, I guess for you making money is more important than helping people, but for me, it's the other way around. Oh, she's a wonderful woman. I can't say it with a straight face. You know, there's still a chance for you to give up peacefully. If you let me out right now, I'll tell the agency to go easy on you just because you've been so reasonable. How about that? That's very nice. Let me think about that. I may have to change my whole life's plan, but I will, sincerely, I will. Joking! Let's cut to the chase. This is your workstation. You have all the materials you need to make me a prototype of that B Link. And if you refuse... we'll pay a little call on your niece and nephew. And we won't be quite as nice to them... as we were to you. All right, Lane, you win. Cut me free, and I'll get to work. I said you were smart. All right, come on, cut her loose. You have two hours. Get to work! Prescott, Hawk. Toby, what's wrong? Auntie B's in trouble. Well, what are we waitin' for? Work fascinates me. I could sit and watch it for hours. You're doing a beautiful job. Just remember, clock's ticking. Welcome to the party. I want all exits on lockdown. Slanderella? Slanderella? - Huh? - Gimme a perimeter. Okay. Nobody in, nobody out. You and you. Follow me, boys. Well, it's ready. Oh, it's ready, that's good, that's nice. It's ready! Oh! Hand it over to Uncle Benny. You got what you wanted, now let me go. Oh, a deal's a deal, but let's just make sure this baby works. Fair is fair. Mm-hmm, knock yourself out. Voice activated and everything. Come here, Angus. Eh? Eh? All right, activate B Link. Hey, boss. What can I do for you? My baby! It spoke to me! We did it, we did it! Looks like they set up patrols along the perimeter. - We'll park offsite, sneak our way in. - Copy that. I'll pull up here, and we'll tuck in behind this building. Everybody know what they're doing? It's showtime. Yoo-hoo! Hey, lady! Lookin' for me? Oh, good! I was startin' to get bored out here. Really? Catch me if you can. Get him, get him, get him! Go! Yes, yes, that's right. 120% fully functional. Your buyers are going to be more than satisfied, and we'll be ready for mass production next month. That's right! Yes, yes, fantastic. Domo arigato. Enough, Lane! Let me go! You know what? I changed my mind. She's coming with us. Wait, what? You can't do that. I can do anything that I put my mind to now. What if something breaks, eh? We have nobody here to fix it, and I'm not going to let that happen ever again. Wait! That's right. Excellent, yes. Boys and girls, we need to vacate these premises immediately. So destroy any evidence that we were ever here, especially incriminating evidence. Nothing left. Lane Technologies sign, I'd like to keep that for my rumpus room if anyone has a stepladder. Now let's crate up Porky, shall we? And anything too heavy to lift, burn! All right, quick like bunnies! That's good. Quick like bunnies! Everything gone! - Who's that? - Looks like some kids. What do they want? Why don't you go and ask 'em? Hello, sir. We're raising money for my softball team, the Ladybugs, and we're going door-to-door asking local businesses for sponsorships. You kids can't be here. This is private property. We're so sorry, sir. I just got my license, and I promised my dad I'd take my sister around. She just loves softball. You know what? I love softball too. I do, I do, hold on. This is for you. - Really? - Oh, yeah, yeah, hold on. Oh, Buzz! Come out here, cheapskate! Pony up a few bucks for the kids, for their softball team. We are softball fans. Agent Barks, do you copy? Yeah, a little busy right now. Another canine is inbound. Not again. Hey there, pup. Boy, am I glad I can talk! Now, I can tell all the other dogs how I kicked your tail up and down this warehouse. Sunny Wolf, it's Angus. Got that little pooch you're lookin' for. Meet me in the back hallway. You know, your boss is a real crumb. We could use a guy like you on our side. You know, the good guys? Yeah, well, the bad guys don't seem so bad when they dole out a million treats. Good guys ever pay you a million treats? No, but at least I can go to sleep knowing I'm doing the right thing. Oh, I sleep just fine, little guy. On a big pile of treats. Well, end of the road, little fella. Just give up, before I unleash the beast on you. You asked for it. Angus, get him! What the...? Oh, I'm so glad you're okay! Not so fast. g\*ons, sic 'em. You're surrounded, both of you. Time to move in. Take this. Toby gave it to us, but we don't know what it is. The Crossbone. Auntie B told me all about this thing. Let's hope it works. Hey, kid, you think you can drive this monster? Like the wind, sir. That's what I like to hear. You're the extraction team. It's go time. Oh, you should've run while you had the chance. Look! Now I have two for one. You know... ahem. It took me a long time to develop the B Link. I couldn't make it work. It got so hot, I must've melted through a dozen prototypes. All the circuits would overheat. Darn thing would cook from the inside out. But I figured it out. Liquid nitrogen. But I had to be careful. Oh, yeah? Why's that? Well, if I use too much... it would freeze! Ah! Activate Crossbone. Agent Toby Barks. - Hey, hey, hey! - I've heard enough from you! I'm running away! Come on! Yah! You're trapped, Lane! There's nowhere else to run! You still have a chance to make this right, Lane. Trapped like a gray rat. Just... turn yourself in, and give up now. What did mother used to say? When cornered, use what you got. Yah! It's time to face the music. Won't get me without a fight. Come on, let's do this! And that's what I'm talkin' about. - Still got it. - Yeah, we do. Oh, hey, guys. See what we did? Well, go arrest them. Tsk. Wow. Yeah. Outstanding work. Check out the human popsicle. Oh, don't worry, he'll thaw out in a few hours. Or a few days. I don't remember. There's my family! Auntie B! Ah, look who's talkin' now! How about some petting? Oh, that feels good. I just don't get it. We've been out here since four in the morning, we've done everything by the book and still nothing. Wait a minute, what do you got there? Well, it's a little trick that my daughter taught me. Is that a gummy worm? Sure is! You wanna try it? Um, no, thanks, I'll stick to the real worms. - Suit yourself. - Hey, I'll try one. Yes, sir, sure. Here we go. It's, uh, create your own luck, right, sir? I like your attitude, Teddy. - Gummy me up. - There you go. - Thank you. - Yes, sir. Alrighty. Here goes nothin'. Oh! Hey... Hey, nice... nice cast, sir, that was a good job. - Thank you, Teddy. - Yeah. You know, I hear you can catch Bigfoot with Sour Patch Kids. Oh. I got one! I got one! - Come on. - Oh, yeah! Oh, yeah, that looks like a big one too, sir. Oh, he's a-fightin', help me out here, Teddy. Oh, wait, yes, sir. Oh, my gosh! That is a big one! Whoa, there he is! Hold on, I got him, I got him! - There he is! - Right here, right here! The legendary fish of Falcon Lake! And you caught him, sir! You caught him! Thanks to you and your gummy worms, Teddy. I tell you, it's innovative ideas like that that separate the good from the great. How about you come into my office Monday morning, and we talk about a promotion, hm? What do you say? Yes, sir. - All right. - Ahem. All right, Dave, you can come too. After all, you were here when we caught this glorious fish, so you must be at least a little lucky. How 'bout we call it an early day, huh? Pack it in, beat the traffic? Because I don't think we're gonna top this fella. - Yes, sir, great idea. - Good idea. I can't wait to surprise my kids! Nothin'. All right. Okay, we're just about ready to rock and roll. - Hey, everybody, Dad's home early! - Oh! Hey! Hi, sweetness, look at you! - You look so great! - Welcome back! Thanks, buddy. Wow, you're sharp too. What's goin' on here? You guys look so... This is Agent Prescott. - Call me Laura. - Wow! I'm sorry, hi. - I'm Ted. Nice to meet you. - Hi. Why-why-why are you guys all dressed up, though? - What's going on? - Funny you should ask that. Anybody see a pair of cufflinks? I know I put 'em down a minute ago, now they're gone. Hey, Ted! Can I borrow a pair of cufflinks? Um, why don't you go throw a suit on, and I'll explain everything on the way? Yeah, uh, okay. Welcome back, Ted. Cufflinks! Is that why... Yeah. He's gonna be fine. Thank you! Thank you so much, everyone! Thank you! And, so you're hearing that too, right? Yeah. Okay. Well, agents, you know what that means. What... What does that mean? Looks like our next mission. Agent Barks, you take the lead. Yes, sir. Agents, mount up!",1,1754575564.0,AgentTobyBarks,0,1.0,False

Hobbled into the dark kitchen to make my coffee (yes in the dark don’t judge)

It wasn’t until I was taking my first drink and opening my phone that I realized I was looking at two phones. In fact I was looking at two of fucking everything.

Queue the next 20 minutes of me spiraling about how I was gonna get to work and what I was gonna have to do. Even going as far as putting eye drops in just incase it was a really bad case of dry eye.

Ended up shooting my boss and my partner at work saying I was gonna be late I was having a fucking problem. 

It took like an hour to go away and I ended up having my dad drive me in to work just in case.

I did go up 500mg of my diamox at the beginning of the week so I’m not sure if it’s that or what. I’ve been on it for 2 years and I’ve never experienced this before.

# Galatians 1:6

* *I am astonished that you are so quickly deserting the one who called you to live in the grace of Christ and are turning to a different gospel.*

**What matters most in the Christian life is persistence**—staying committed through discouragement and difficulty. Some people start off strong but lose enthusiasm over time. That was the problem with the Galatians. Paul said, “I’m astonished that you are so quickly deserting the one who called you.” In another letter, Paul thanks God for the faithfulness of the people he’s writing to. But in this letter, he marvels at how quickly the Galatians lost their focus and dedication. When people wanted to follow Jesus, He said, “If you hold to My teaching, you are truly My disciples.” It’s the ongoing commitment to Christ that proves we are His followers. We must stand firm on the rock and cling to Christ, no matter what challenges come. Being steady and committed is a great strength.",1,1754575518.0,EnlightenUp,0,1.0,False

Let's go to bed, come on, let's go. - Okay. - All right. Bedtime. Let's go, let's go, let's go. - Bret, turn off the TV. - After this game. You gotta get some sleep, buddy. If you pass your driver's test tomorrow, then you can drive a real car. Wouldn't that be somethin'? This is kinda like practice, Dad. Oh, well, this wouldn't be confusing or distracting. Come on, Dad. - Is this a problem for you? - Dad. - I'm so sorry. - You're gonna make me crash! I'm a pedestrian! I'm a pedestrian, look out! Don't hit the pedestrians! Oh, my gosh, I'm so sorry.

How's that Bark Link working? I've made some modifications. Seems to be working great. I feel like I could ♪ sing! ♪ Great, hold that song for later. We have business to tend to. Oh, fine, I'm all ears. Agent Prescott will brief you at the mobile command unit. - Roger. - Gear up, and meet at the extraction point. Better get my tail movin'. It's go time. Yeah. Agent Barks, welcome to the party. Let's go. Don't have to tell me twice. All systems online. Looks like the team's all here. Agent Prescott, let's go. Meet Horrace the Horrible. He's big, he's nasty, and he loves money. He runs an evil faction out of an old nightclub on the edge of town. He's hired rogue hackers to spread a virus within the American banking system. His ultimate plan is to shut down Wall Street, creating an economic downswing worse than the Great Depression. He always rolls with a pack of very mean, very dedicated bodyguards. He is considered to be extremely dangerous. This man must be stopped. That's where Toby here comes in. The Horrible Compound is known for its tight security. Agent Barks can infiltrate the building and shut down the security system, allowing agents in through the undefended flanks east and west of the main building. - You be careful in there, Agent Barks. - Copy that.

That's it, Toby, that's the main hub. You're doing fantastic. Now plant that virus, and let's go home. The country will crumble! It's time that we take over! Yeah! Okay, let's see here. - Come on, come on - Toby, look out. Two bogies headin' your way and fast. Repeat, two bogies! Yeah! Come on, come on, come on. Aw! - Look at this little guy! - Oh, somebody wants a belly rub! This must be Horrace's new dog. - Hey, he kinda looks like him. - Yeah, he does. - Don't tell him I said that. - Mm, no, I won't.

Here's a little goin' away present, fellas. He did it. All their systems are down. Yes! Get Agent Barks out of there, and send in the cavalry. Toby, the back window to the rear courtyard is open and clear. No! All right. Woo-hoo! All right! Mission accomplished, baby! Yeah. Proud to know you, Agent Barks. Couldn't have done it without you. You gotta love it. One more bad guy off the Most Wanted list, one more dangerous raid with nobody hurt on either side. He's a fine agent, sir. Figured nothin' like a smoke show to add a little excitement to the dance floor. Hey, Toby. I figured I'd throw you a bone. This guy gets it. Hawk, you're the man. Thank you, but I gotta take that bone to go. Need to get back before my people wake up and notice I'm gone. Of course. Later, Toby. Agents, we were all just in the presence of greatness. We could all learn a lot from that dog. That dog is one of a kind. Wouldn't the world be a happier place if there were a million others just like him? Uh, yes, sir, Mr. Albright. Yes, sir, I'll have that report in by the end of the day today, sir. Yes, sir, no problem. Uh, no. No, no, fishing trip? No, sir, I haven't heard anything about that yet. This is the first thing I've heard. No... yes, sir, yes, of course, yeah. Absolutely, I can make that happen. Yes, sir. Okay, I'll see you at the office then, sir. Thank you so much. Great. Oh, boy. How am I gonna make this happen? Kids, let's go, come on! Let's move, move, move! Let's go, let's go, let's go! We're gonna be late. - Morning, Daddy. - Good morning, sweetheart. Wow, look at... That is a very, very festive outfit.

Oh, hey, I hear today's a big day. Yep, my boy's gonna ace his driver's test. Yeah, can't wait. Just me, the open road, Dad's beat up old Honda with the busted air conditioner. - Gonna be great. - That's a great car. You should be very lucky to have that car. - You're welcome. - Kate, the bus is here. Coming, Bretty. Bye, Dad, bye, Dave. Bye, sweetheart, I love you... okay. Hey, thank you for comin' through with those doughnuts. Big win. Yeah, I mean, I know it hasn't been easy without Diane. Can you believe it's been a year already? It's not getting easier, you're right. Well, if we get this promotion, you'll have less work, more money, more time to spend with the kids. - That's a good point. - And then I get to have your job. Uh, yeah, no, I don't think so. You're jumpin' the g\*n there a little bit, big guy. Well, rumor has it that Albright is ready to promote the both of us. We just need to seal the deal on this fishing trip. - Oh, the fishing trip. - It's great, right? No, it's terrible. It's a scheduling nightmare for me. I gotta find someone to watch the kids. Ted, you're doing this for those kids. It's for their future. You're fishing for their future. I guess I could call my sister. Oh! Oh, of course, yes, yes! Whatever you need, I'm there! Okay, okay. I-I'll... I'll get my stuff, and I will stop by after work. This is such a great surprise. I can't wait to see everyone! - Hello. - Oh. - Hungry? - Oh, no, thank you. Oh, come on! Look, it's juicy, take a bite. I don't doubt that they are, but I really don't... okay. So, what are you workin' on, huh? Oh, well, I was just making some modifications to the B Link. Oh, you mean the world's greatest invention? - You're a genius. - Thanks. Yeah. So, that's so top secret, I've always wondered, how do we deal with the plans for that sort of thing? Where-where do we keep those plans? Well, they're filed away. Why do you wanna know? Shop talk. Inside baseball. Chit-chat. You don't have clearance, so there's really no point in my telling you. I could get clearance. Brr, got cold in here. Oh, nice talk. All the key ingredients for an epic weekend with Auntie B. Well, I didn't think I'd be seeing you again so soon, huh? Really nice of you to help out. Well, it's a great opportunity for me to catch up with the niece and nephew before I blink and they're off to college. But there is one thing I wanna make very clear. The kids cannot know about what we do. If they were to ever find out, we'd be putting them in incredible danger. - Agreed. - Okay, good. Now, do you mind? I have to go to the bathroom. Stay! How was your driver's test? Um, it was great. I aced it, yeah. - Can we go for a ride? - Um, maybe tomorrow. Yes! - Hi, Auntie B! - I have missed you so much! - Auntie B! - Oh! Oh, Bret, you are now taller than me! How did that happen? Vegetables? Missed you too, Auntie B. Yeah, we did. Hey, today's not a holiday. No, I don't think so. What do you mean? Well, usually you only come on holidays. - Oh. - Dad's home. - Ha! - Dad, Auntie B's here! Ah, yeah, I know. Hey, you! - Hi! - Hi, sweetheart, my little sis. Good to see you, sis. She's here because she's gonna stay the weekend. Daddy has to go schmooze his boss on a fishing trip. Daddy, what does schmooze mean? It's like being extra nice to somebody so they'll be nice to you in the long run. Oh, so kinda like kissing up to your teacher but for grownups? Yes, that's exactly what it's like, Miss Smartypants. Geez. Hey. How'd the test go? Um, it was good, I nailed it. I have a ton of homework and a book report. I am so far behind. You know, actually, I should get on it right now. Well, that's a first. Anybody hungry? Come here you. You I gotta feed, I know I have to feed you. I guess this is the closest I'm gonna get to a car this summer. I could've swore I passed it. Come in. I'm not mad. But I was doing the laundry and I found this. Well, now you know. Why'd you lie? I didn't wanna let you down. Buddy... Making a mistake is not letting me down. Lying to me is. All right? Lying is like driving a car in reverse. Okay? I don't care how good you are at it, you're still going backwards. I was just embarrassed. Why? So what? I failed my first driving test. - Really? - Miserably. Like, not even close. What do I tell the other kids? Forget them. Your real friends won't care. I guess bad driving runs in the family. Yeah, we don't have to tell anybody else though, okay? That's our secret. - You okay? - Yeah. All right. If you fail the next one, I'm gonna k\*ll you. Gummy worms before bed? I like your style, kid, but I'm not so sure I can allow that. They're not for me, they're for you, silly. Really? Yes, you can use them as bait on your fishing trip. Oh, sweetheart, I appreciate that, but I don't think the fishies like candy as much as we do. No, look, they do. Fish are known to be attracted to the bright colors of the gummy worms. - Look at that! - Yeah, and it even says if you keep your line just above the water, it can catch the light. I guess it makes them all shiny. Well, you are my little Einstein. Thank you very much. Hey, you better hit the road if you're gonna get to the lake by daybreak. All right, all right. Listen, you have fun with your Auntie B, okay? - Sweet dreams and jellybeans. - And gummy worms. And gummy worms. Toby... here, buddy. I got a little something for you. Listen, I know my sister's here this weekend, but you and I know who's really in charge, okay? It's you. Thanks, buddy. - He understands every word I say. - Yeah, go have some fun. I have everything under control here. Don't even think about it, Toby. - What smells so good? - Oh! - Whoa! - Order up! I wish we could have breakfast like this every day. There's the genius! Workin' on your day off? Oh, Agent Lane! Everything okay? Oh, great, great, great, couldn't be better. Brought you some coffee. Cream, no sugar. - Just the way you like it. - Oh, thanks. Um... So how'd you know to track me down here? I'm a federal agent, it's what we do. I guess... guess that's true. Actually, I wanted a little time just me and you away from the office. Oh. - Go on... - It's about the B Link. The ability to translate barking into words. I mean, who knew that ""woof woof"" meant, ""How you doin', Charlie?"" Ha. You made it possible for man's best friend to actually be man's best friend. Well, the frequencies were always there. - It was just a matter of deciphering... - No, you! You made them talk. I didn't make them talk, Agent Lane. Dogs have been talking since the beginning of time. I just found a way for us to listen to them. - Well, listen to this... - What's this about? What if I told you that I could put $20 million in your pocket today and offer you a partnership in my new enterprise, Lane Technologies? Which will be worth billions for all of us very soon, I assure you. All you would have to do... Leave out the plans for the B Link, accidentally, casually, so I could take a few quick snaps of them, huh? - Okay, okay. - Uh-huh, yeah? That's a good joke. No, no, no, this is anything but a joke. I have an associate at the largest overseas tech company who is willing to pay a fortune for those plans. You really aren't joking, are you? You don't realize what you have here! You have invented the most important device of the history of mankind and animalkind. I mean, every little boy is gonna wanna come home and hear about the dog's day. Every little girl will be able to say, ""Fluffy, how you feeling?"" ""I ate a paperclip."" Or you could be on vacation and call home, and Bowser can say, ""I chased a burglar away."" The possibilities are endless for this invention and the marketing, the social media, the interactive games... We've got a goldmine! But I didn't invent the B Link to cash in. I invented it to help people. Well, it could still help people, only in a different way. - Not a chance. - Well, I don't think you understand... You know, why don't we pretend that this is all a big joke and act like it never happened, hm? Otherwise, I'm gonna report you so fast that your tie will spin right off your shirt collar. Ouch. So that's the way you wanna play it? Oh, that's exactly how I wanna play it. Okay, so it's all a big joke. Yeah, you owe me $5 for the coffee. Joking! Big joke. Enjoy your day, partner. All righty, we score big with the boss this weekend, we earn ourselves the Empress account along with a couple of promotions. Yeah, well, you're in luck, buddy, 'cause I can fish like a grizzly bear. I'll believe it when I see it. - Mm-hmm. - Oh, here he comes. Shall we do battle with Neptune, boys, hm? Test our mettle against man's oldest adversary? - Huh? - I think he wants to know - if we're ready to fish. - Oh, yeah, absolutely. - Bait me up, Teddy. - Yes, sir. I'm glad you boys could make it. You know there's a legendary fish in this lake? And I'm gonna catch it. The bad guys are getting smarter every day, so we've gotta keep one step ahead of them. - Are you ready? - Born ready, baby. Okay. This looks like a regular tennis ball, right? Right. All right, take a good chew. Yeah, one good bite and it's lights out for 30 seconds. It cuts the power and stops any signal of any kind. Snap into that bad boy, and everything within a 100-foot radius goes back to the Stone Age. Wow, that would come in handy when it's time to make a quick getaway. - Mm-hmm. Yeah. - I'll take it. Hey, what's in here? Oh, oh, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop. Um, this? This is the Crossbone, and it is, perhaps, my finest invention, but it is not ready yet, so paws off, please. - All right, all right. - Oh, yes, yes, yes. I give you the cam collar. - Hey, you're on TV. - Mm-hmm. We see everything you see. Wow. It's incredible, you really outdid yourself. Oh, you know. Eh? Look at that. That was a nice cast. Oh, hi! There's my favorite kids in the galaxy. Whoa... - Auntie B, are you okay? - I'll call for help. No, no, no, no, I'm fine. Just a little slip. Good, you scared me. Yeah, that was a pretty hard fall. That was nothin'. Whatcha workin' on there? I am glad that you asked. I know that your dad needs a little help around the house, and after you enjoyed breakfast so much, I said to myself, ""How can I ensure that my favorite kids in the galaxy have the most important meal of the day every day?"" And so I whipped up... - the Diner Drone! - ♪ Diner Drone ♪ The Diner Drone. I like the name. It is easy to use, so check it out. You see our funnels here, yes? So you just put in basic breakfast ingredients, like syrup... Or flour... your sugar, and I know you like that. And just a little bit of bacon, just a little. - Can I try one? - Crack away. All right, now we get to customize our settings. So scrambled. Scrambled, right? All right. Okay, and you might want to step aside a little bit. I've never really tested this thing out. And if it smokes, that's normal, so... Now basically, your standard ordinary breakfast takes approximately nine minutes to create from start to finish, but the Diner Drone accomplishes the whole thing in 18 seconds. Don't ask me how I do it, it's top secret. Oh! And just because it's a shame to waste food, - this is an after-school snack. - Thanks! Can you believe we get to eat breakfast like this every day? How did you do this in just a few hours? That's also top secret. What's the matter with these fish? I got good bait. Are they too good for my bait? They're just not bitin', sir. Thanks, master of the obvious. You know, I brought you two out here to see if you were lucky. Lucky, sir? I always say it's better to be lucky than good. In business, it takes a lot of luck to become successful, and there's no better judge of a man's luck than by how the fish bite. I see. Well, then, I say we change our luck, sir. - I don't follow. - Well, we've been fishing this exact same spot all day without so much as a nibble. I say we go fish that little point right there underneath those trees? I'll bet you that big, glorious fish is just sittin' under there in the shade waiting for us to come over there tomorrow, catch him, and put him inside your cooler. I like your moxie, Theodore. All right. Tomorrow morning, we hit that spot at dawn. Now let's make camp before it gets too dark. Yes, sir. Auntie B, why are we at an old, empty grocery store? Well, it's not the old, empty grocery store I'm after. It is the old, empty parking lot. - Hop out of the car, Bret. - Huh? Hop out of the car, switch places with me, mm? What is she doing? You are about to enroll in the Auntie B Driving Academy. Whew! So... ahem. The key to operating a motor vehicle is simple but very crucial. It's all about sight lines, my young friend. You are aware of everything in your environment at all times, including the ignition. Start the car. Yeah! Yeah... - Lane? - Hi. What are you doing here? Oh, nothing of any interest whatsoever. I... you know, I was just tryin' to catch up, and, you know, get ahead of the game. Heh. You know, success favors the diligent. That's what I say. Yeah? Oh, well, we're both very wise. So what are you doing here? - Same, just... work. - Oh, well. - Good for you. - Work to do. Good for you. A busy agent is a great agent. So, let's get back to it, shall we? - All right. - All right. - Later. All right. - Yes, much later. - Good night, Agent Prescott. - Good night, Lane. Yes, good night. Where was I? Baddies, bullies, charming sociopaths, cheaters, crackpots, creeps, crooks, deranged psychopaths... Ah-ha! Dangerous maniacs... and there he is. Sunny Wolf. Takes a big bad wolf to catch a chatty little dog. 100! 101! 102! Keep going! You got this, yeah! It's for you. Wolf here. Hello there, Mr. Wolf. This is Benedict N. Lane from Lane Technologies, and I have a rather lucrative offer for you, sir, for a man of your specific skill set and expertise. I'm listening. Oh, you're interested. What, you're throwing sharks at me? - That makes no sense. Makes no sense. - Come on, come on. - Move it or lose it, lady. - Oh, ho, ho! Oh, yeah! Who taught you how to drive, huh? Just my awesomely wacky aunt. Whoa! Hmm! - No, no, no, no, no! - Come on. - Oh. - Yes! Hey, come on! Well, your awesomely wacky aunt is quickly becoming your awesomely old aunt. I'm ready for bed. Oh, wow, look at this! Check out the masterpiece. That is really something. I'm getting sleepy too, Auntie B. Why don't we call it a night, and you go get ready, - and I'll tuck you in? - Okay. - I'm gonna head up, too. - Hmm. Thanks again for the driving lesson. You'll be on the road in no time. We'll try to get another lesson in tomorrow. Awesome. Night, Auntie B. Goodnight, Toby. Come on. Ah-ha. I'll grab the pooch, you get the old lady. Got it. Get off, you stupid mangy dog! - Bretty, I heard a noise. - So did I. Maybe Auntie B's just getting a snack. That doesn't sound like a snack. You stupid! - Toby! - Wait. It might not be safe out there. Grab his things to keep him quiet. You, you don't have to do this. - Stay. - Let's go. Come on, lady. Get in the van, lady. - Someone's got Auntie B! - Call 911! - Will you shut that dog up? - Yeah, yeah. Here, do you want the ball? Do you want the ball? - The phone won't work. - What? It won't even turn on. Someone must've cut the phone line. They're gonna get away! Not if I can help it. Stay here. I'm coming with you. - What was that? - I don't know! It won't start. It won't start! Well, did you try turning the key? Ah-ah-ah, don't make me snap it. Work, work, work. Whoo! Back in business. - What about the dog? - Forget about the dog. Let's get out of here before the cops come. Yeah, go! They're all gone. - Toby? - Toby! Where is he going? Hold up. Be careful, there may be aliens. I don't think it's aliens. Let's stay close. This is Agent Toby Barks requesting Agent Laura Prescott. Security clearance 1-1-5-6-2-4-5. Repeat, Agent Barks for Agent Prescott, security clearance 1-1-5-6-2-4-5. Do you copy? This is Agent Barks, do you copy? Does anybody read me? Hello? Code red, can you read me? This is not a drill. Repeat, this is not a drill. This just keeps getting weirder and weirder. Anybody? Anybody at all? Can anyone hear me? Answer. Uh, hi, guys. This can't be real. - Toby? - Uh, hi, guys. Toby, are you talking? No, I'm just... I... yes. Auntie B gets snatched in the middle of the night, thrown in to a van, our dog is talking to us, and we're in the middle of some kind of, I don't know, secret base. - Is this a secret base? - It's the Barkcave. Right, the Barkcave, makes sense. I know what this is. We're still sleeping. This is a dream, I'm dreaming. I already pinched myself six times. This is real. Kate's right, this is very real. Don't have time to explain it. Well, excuse me for being a little weirded out that my dog is talkin' to me right now. Look, I'm not just your dog. I'm a highly trained government agent. Your Auntie B and I work for a top secret organization. You've gotta be kidding me! So you're like a 00-doggie? Will you just listen? We're running out of time! Auntie B invented some real game-changing gadgets and someone must be after her. - Who do you think it is? - Well, only a few people know where to find Auntie B this weekend. Sadly, they all work for the agency. So, that means? That means someone from the inside double-crossed us. Computer, locate van make and model. Can't be too many of those on the road in this area. Computer, I need an engine sound match on a '96 Bounder. Activate the doggie ear. - That's them? - Bingo. That's the access road near the school. Shouldn't you call backup or something? I need to handle this myself. I can't trust anyone yet. You can trust us. I'm coming with you. Me, too. Oh, no, you're not. We're Auntie B's family! We're not just gonna sit around while someone breaks into our house and takes her. Absolutely not! Your safety has been jeopardized enough as it is. It's just too dangerous. Well, if you don't let us come, we'll tell Daddy and everyone will know that you're a secret agent. Ah, poop! - You're driving. - What? - You heard me. - I don't even have my license. Well, my paws don't reach the pedals, and we're tails-deep in a government emergency here. So I think we can make an exception. I believe in you. You're the man for this mission. Now, let's go before I lose the scent. You can do this. Be the road. The road and you. Hm. You got this, kid. Just focus on the yellow lines. My dog is giving my brother driving tips. Okay, what's it say, Kate? Um, okay, take a left up ahead. Left up ahead, got it. Now, 100 feet, turn signals. Come to a complete stop, check all directions for oncoming traffic. - Good, good. - Okay. Okay, slowly accelerate into the turn. Okay, now what? Um, take a right on Davison Ave. Take a right! Okay, got it. What's next? Um, that's where the signal ends. No way they're still gonna be there. Don't worry, I'll smell 'em the rest of the way. Huh? - Left! Go left! - What? Left! He said go left! - Straight! - Straight. I like that one, it's easy. Oh, brother. Oh, Bretty? I think they want you to pull over. Yeah, it's the fuzz. Pull over. Oh, man! Now I'm never gonna get my license. I'll be banned for life! Brett, relax! I'll do the talking. Okay, everybody, keep cool. Keep your cool. I got this. License and registration, please. Evening, officer. What seems to be the problem? I'm sorry, was I speeding? I really didn't think so. This is a 35, right? We had reports of a van speeding through a minute ago. Guess I got the wrong one. Oh, I see. Well, have a nice night, officer. Yeah, you guys take care. Stay safe! Wow, I gotta cut back on the overtime. I cannot believe that worked. Works every time, baby. All right, let's get back on the scent. Guys, it's Auntie B! Bingo! Nice spot, Kate! Okay, I need you two to stay in here. Let me guess, it's too dangerous for kids? No. Well, yes, but the truth is, I need you in here. Everything I see will be transmitted on that tablet. I may need you for some intel if I get in a jam, so be on the ready to haul out of here once I rescue Auntie B. Got it. It's go time. Paws in the middle! Barks! Auntie B! No, no, no! What do you mean... ...you couldn't get the dog? I could've hired a dog catcher for far less money and better results! If I knew we had to nab some secret agent dog, I would've asked for more money. Not some secret agent dog, a talking secret agent dog! Well, since you got half your job done, I will offer you half of the money, and you're still security until this whole thing is over. And if you have a problem with it... I'll just call my friends and tell them all about you. No problem. ""No problem."" Good answer. Will you stop squirming? Geez! ♪ Auntie B, Auntie B ♪ ♪ Oh my favorite money tree ♪ - Bazooka? - Mm. It's my favorite. Well, later. I came to you, and I offered you a deal, and you gave me a flat no, not knowing that I'm the kind of guy you never say no to. My mother used to call me ""tenacious."" She called me ""solipsistic,"" too. That was when I was six, and ""Mr. Smartypants"" when I was 27. But I'll show you, Mommy! I'll show all of you. You'll never get away with this, Lane! Oh, won't I? Is that your expert opinion? I think I already have! Because no one knows you're here. Ladies and gentlemen, I introduce to you Dr. Bonnie Barks! We're old chums and collaborators... for huzzum huzzum years. She's the new head of research and development at Lane Technologies, but you can call her... - Auntie B. - Oh, yay! You're all breaking the law! This man is a traitor to the United States, and you're just as guilty as he is if you don't free me at once! Oh, that's good, that's good, appeal to their consciences. You don't know that they're paid so much they don't have any. What do you want from me? Don't you know with that brilliant bulb of a brain of yours? I want that B Link! I want schematics, I want plans, I want data. I wanna know how to make that dog talk! Years of hard work and research just thrown away on consumerism? It's a real shame. Shame on you. My mommy used to say, ""Self, self, self, why don't you think about me?"" Well, I'm not giving you anything, not one shred of information. Well, then my associates are right here, and they are experts at extracting all the information I need. How you doin', Auntie B? What's that? I don't know, but it's blue. What does that mean? Well, all the people have been red dots, and Toby's a blue dot... So that means there's another dog? Toby, I think there's another dog, and he's coming your way. Don't do it. Don't... don't... What was that? Good ol' Angus must've found somethin'. Fan out, fan out and find out what that is. Uh-oh... Whoa! Whoa! Yes! Ow, ow, that was the dog. That was Toby! Come on, you imbeciles! Get me my talking dog! Activate Mr. Sandman. Ooh. Angus? Half-wits? What are you doing sleeping in the middle of the night? I was just resting my eyes. Geez. Mommy, I don't wanna go to school today. I'm afraid to ask this, but do I look like your mother? Get up, get up! Go, go, go! We're losing him! Go, go, go, go! - Go, go! - Sleepin' on the job. Aw, no! You brainless imbeciles let him get away! - We'll go find him! - We got it! No, no, don't go anywhere! I need you here. I gotta get this show on the road. All right, tighten security. Hire reinforcements. Do something to help me! I have to go have a little chat with our guest. Oh... Round up some g\*ons. We got a job to do. Sure thing! I'll just go put an ad in the crime paper! Well, we didn't get what we came for, but we made it out of there in one piece. But how are we gonna save Auntie B? Don't worry, kid. I have a plan. Good. A plan is good. At first I didn't know who I could trust within the agency. Now that we know Agent Lane's the crooked one, I can get by with a little help from my friends. I finally figured out what the B in Auntie B stands for... the best and the brightest! Oh, Bonnie, you truly are a genius. Oh, can it, Lane! Ooh, I am sincere. I speak from my heart's core. Look at these scientists! My scientists, the best that money could buy! The greatest minds in the universe! Nobel Prize winners! All of them working for what seems like an eternity trying to create what you have already created. You know, billions and billions of overseas dollars from my investors have gone into supporting them trying to do what you've already done. We attempted on every single kind of species. We tried a parrot. A goat. A bunny, a turtle, a mouse, a horse! Say ""not by the hair of my chinny-chin-chin."" All right, BLTs for lunch! We even tried a fish. We got the same results every time. Guess what? We got nothing! I thought the cat would work, I was sure! And we got something, we did. I thought every little child would wanna say good night to his own little kissy kitty cat, and I would be so rich! Ew, humans, gross! Please give me my space. You there, fathead, what's for lunch? Fathead, fathead! Fathead, fathead! I'm talking to you! Mouthy little furballs, aren't they? ""Fathead."" That really hurt. You were a good agent, Lane. I was not only a good agent, I was a great agent! I was an excellent agent! But Uncle Benny's got a mortgage. You see what I drive? Well, I guess for you making money is more important than helping people, but for me, it's the other way around. Oh, she's a wonderful woman. I can't say it with a straight face. You know, there's still a chance for you to give up peacefully. If you let me out right now, I'll tell the agency to go easy on you just because you've been so reasonable. How about that? That's very nice. Let me think about that. I may have to change my whole life's plan, but I will, sincerely, I will. Joking! Let's cut to the chase. This is your workstation. You have all the materials you need to make me a prototype of that B Link. And if you refuse... we'll pay a little call on your niece and nephew. And we won't be quite as nice to them... as we were to you. All right, Lane, you win. Cut me free, and I'll get to work. I said you were smart. All right, come on, cut her loose. You have two hours. Get to work! Prescott, Hawk. Toby, what's wrong? Auntie B's in trouble. Well, what are we waitin' for? Work fascinates me. I could sit and watch it for hours. You're doing a beautiful job. Just remember, clock's ticking. Welcome to the party. I want all exits on lockdown. Slanderella? Slanderella? - Huh? - Gimme a perimeter. Okay. Nobody in, nobody out. You and you. Follow me, boys. Well, it's ready. Oh, it's ready, that's good, that's nice. It's ready! Oh! Hand it over to Uncle Benny. You got what you wanted, now let me go. Oh, a deal's a deal, but let's just make sure this baby works. Fair is fair. Mm-hmm, knock yourself out. Voice activated and everything. Come here, Angus. Eh? Eh? All right, activate B Link. Hey, boss. What can I do for you? My baby! It spoke to me! We did it, we did it! Looks like they set up patrols along the perimeter. - We'll park offsite, sneak our way in. - Copy that. I'll pull up here, and we'll tuck in behind this building. Everybody know what they're doing? It's showtime. Yoo-hoo! Hey, lady! Lookin' for me? Oh, good! I was startin' to get bored out here. Really? Catch me if you can. Get him, get him, get him! Go! Yes, yes, that's right. 120% fully functional. Your buyers are going to be more than satisfied, and we'll be ready for mass production next month. That's right! Yes, yes, fantastic. Domo arigato. Enough, Lane! Let me go! You know what? I changed my mind. She's coming with us. Wait, what? You can't do that. I can do anything that I put my mind to now. What if something breaks, eh? We have nobody here to fix it, and I'm not going to let that happen ever again. Wait! That's right. Excellent, yes. Boys and girls, we need to vacate these premises immediately. So destroy any evidence that we were ever here, especially incriminating evidence. Nothing left. Lane Technologies sign, I'd like to keep that for my rumpus room if anyone has a stepladder. Now let's crate up Porky, shall we? And anything too heavy to lift, burn! All right, quick like bunnies! That's good. Quick like bunnies! Everything gone! - Who's that? - Looks like some kids. What do they want? Why don't you go and ask 'em? Hello, sir. We're raising money for my softball team, the Ladybugs, and we're going door-to-door asking local businesses for sponsorships. You kids can't be here. This is private property. We're so sorry, sir. I just got my license, and I promised my dad I'd take my sister around. She just loves softball. You know what? I love softball too. I do, I do, hold on. This is for you. - Really? - Oh, yeah, yeah, hold on. Oh, Buzz! Come out here, cheapskate! Pony up a few bucks for the kids, for their softball team. We are softball fans. Agent Barks, do you copy? Yeah, a little busy right now. Another canine is inbound. Not again. Hey there, pup. Boy, am I glad I can talk! Now, I can tell all the other dogs how I kicked your tail up and down this warehouse. Sunny Wolf, it's Angus. Got that little pooch you're lookin' for. Meet me in the back hallway. You know, your boss is a real crumb. We could use a guy like you on our side. You know, the good guys? Yeah, well, the bad guys don't seem so bad when they dole out a million treats. Good guys ever pay you a million treats? No, but at least I can go to sleep knowing I'm doing the right thing. Oh, I sleep just fine, little guy. On a big pile of treats. Well, end of the road, little fella. Just give up, before I unleash the beast on you. You asked for it. Angus, get him! What the...? Oh, I'm so glad you're okay! Not so fast. g\*ons, sic 'em. You're surrounded, both of you. Time to move in. Take this. Toby gave it to us, but we don't know what it is. The Crossbone. Auntie B told me all about this thing. Let's hope it works. Hey, kid, you think you can drive this monster? Like the wind, sir. That's what I like to hear. You're the extraction team. It's go time. Oh, you should've run while you had the chance. Look! Now I have two for one. You know... ahem. It took me a long time to develop the B Link. I couldn't make it work. It got so hot, I must've melted through a dozen prototypes. All the circuits would overheat. Darn thing would cook from the inside out. But I figured it out. Liquid nitrogen. But I had to be careful. Oh, yeah? Why's that? Well, if I use too much... it would freeze! Ah! Activate Crossbone. Agent Toby Barks. - Hey, hey, hey! - I've heard enough from you! I'm running away! Come on! Yah! You're trapped, Lane! There's nowhere else to run! You still have a chance to make this right, Lane. Trapped like a gray rat. Just... turn yourself in, and give up now. What did mother used to say? When cornered, use what you got. Yah! It's time to face the music. Won't get me without a fight. Come on, let's do this! And that's what I'm talkin' about. - Still got it. - Yeah, we do. Oh, hey, guys. See what we did? Well, go arrest them. Tsk. Wow. Yeah. Outstanding work. Check out the human popsicle. Oh, don't worry, he'll thaw out in a few hours. Or a few days. I don't remember. There's my family! Auntie B! Ah, look who's talkin' now! How about some petting? Oh, that feels good. I just don't get it. We've been out here since four in the morning, we've done everything by the book and still nothing. Wait a minute, what do you got there? Well, it's a little trick that my daughter taught me. Is that a gummy worm? Sure is! You wanna try it? Um, no, thanks, I'll stick to the real worms. - Suit yourself. - Hey, I'll try one. Yes, sir, sure. Here we go. It's, uh, create your own luck, right, sir? I like your attitude, Teddy. - Gummy me up. - There you go. - Thank you. - Yes, sir. Alrighty. Here goes nothin'. Oh! Hey... Hey, nice... nice cast, sir, that was a good job. - Thank you, Teddy. - Yeah. You know, I hear you can catch Bigfoot with Sour Patch Kids. Oh. I got one! I got one! - Come on. - Oh, yeah! Oh, yeah, that looks like a big one too, sir. Oh, he's a-fightin', help me out here, Teddy. Oh, wait, yes, sir. Oh, my gosh! That is a big one! Whoa, there he is! Hold on, I got him, I got him! - There he is! - Right here, right here! The legendary fish of Falcon Lake! And you caught him, sir! You caught him! Thanks to you and your gummy worms, Teddy. I tell you, it's innovative ideas like that that separate the good from the great. How about you come into my office Monday morning, and we talk about a promotion, hm? What do you say? Yes, sir. - All right. - Ahem. All right, Dave, you can come too. After all, you were here when we caught this glorious fish, so you must be at least a little lucky. How 'bout we call it an early day, huh? Pack it in, beat the traffic? Because I don't think we're gonna top this fella. - Yes, sir, great idea. - Good idea. I can't wait to surprise my kids! Nothin'. All right. Okay, we're just about ready to rock and roll. - Hey, everybody, Dad's home early! - Oh! Hey! Hi, sweetness, look at you! - You look so great! - Welcome back! Thanks, buddy. Wow, you're sharp too. What's goin' on here? You guys look so... This is Agent Prescott. - Call me Laura. - Wow! I'm sorry, hi. - I'm Ted. Nice to meet you. - Hi. Why-why-why are you guys all dressed up, though? - What's going on? - Funny you should ask that. Anybody see a pair of cufflinks? I know I put 'em down a minute ago, now they're gone. Hey, Ted! Can I borrow a pair of cufflinks? Um, why don't you go throw a suit on, and I'll explain everything on the way? Yeah, uh, okay. Welcome back, Ted. Cufflinks! Is that why... Yeah. He's gonna be fine. Thank you! Thank you so much, everyone! Thank you! And, so you're hearing that too, right? Yeah. Okay. Well, agents, you know what that means. What... What does that mean? Looks like our next mission. Agent Barks, you take the lead. Yes, sir. Agents, mount up!",1,1754575449.0,AgentTobyBarks,0,1.0,False

1mk0v4f,https://www.reddit.com/r/PowerCheck/comments/1mk0v4f/reveal_the_best_liquid_laundry_detergent_tide/,Reveal the Best Liquid Laundry Detergent Tide Ultra Oxi Worth It?,"Tide Ultra Oxi Liquid Laundry Detergent, HE Compatible, has become a staple in my household after giving it an extensive trial. With a variety of laundry products available, it’s easy to overlook this one, but I couldn’t resist trying something boasting built-in pre-treaters and a powerful stain-fighting formula. Here's my take on the experience of using this detergent for over a month of laundry days.

**A Strong Advocate for Stain Removal**

The standout feature here is the built-in pre-treaters that claim to tackle tough stains, and I couldn’t agree more. As someone who regularly deals with kids’ muddy uniforms and accidental coffee spills, this detergent quickly became my go-to. The stains didn’t just fade; they disappeared completely. Even grease stains on kitchen towels were no match. Pairing it with the HE washer further optimized its efficiency, as one capful went a long way in delivering spotless results.

[Check Tide Ultra Oxi Liquid Laundry Detergent price on Amazon.](https://alluringdeals.com/p/b0bnwf9ypl/)

**Odor Control That Actually Works**

Doing laundry for a busy household means odors can linger if the detergent doesn’t pull its weight. From sweaty gym clothes to damp towels, every piece came out smelling fresh. The formula’s ability to eliminate set-in odors rather than just masking them left me impressed. It’s like a giant breath of fresh air for clothes that refused to stay dirty-smelling.

**Efficient and Concentrated Formula**

Because Tide Ultra Oxi has a more concentrated formula, you don’t need to overuse the product. Each load requires only a small amount of detergent, which felt like a big win for value-conscious users like me. Not only does it save you money, but it’s also easier to store, considering how long the bottle lasts despite regular heavy usage.

**Upsides**

- Removes even stubborn stains without pre-washing  
- Leaves clothes smelling genuinely fresh  
- Works effectively with HE washers to save water and detergent  
- Long-lasting due to the concentrated formula  

**Downsides**

- The container design could improve; pouring can get messy  
- The sheer cleaning power might be overkill for lightly soiled clothes  
- Strong fragrance may not appeal to everyone  

**Comparing with Competing Products**

While other brands like Persil ProClean and All Free Clear are heavy hitters in the laundry game, this detergent holds its ground confidently. Compared to Persil, Tide Ultra Oxi is better at handling embedded odors, though Persil excels in delicate fabric care. All Free Clear is an excellent choice for those with sensitive skin, but it lacks the stain-fighting heft that Tide brings to the table. For families or active individuals dealing with constant stains, this detergent stands out as the all-rounder choice in terms of effectiveness.

**Quality for Price**

Laundry detergent is not something I’m usually willing to splurge on unless it’s worth it. While the price of this might seem higher than average, it more than pays for itself. The concentrated formula stretches farther, and the results justify every penny spent. You’re essentially investing in cleaner clothes, less hassle with pre-treating, and superior odor control, which feels like a smart decision.

Context: 
So my Gf is in the province went out with her niece and nephew by car to spend quality time for a  coffee or something to eat, they checked a certain place to hangout in google maps and they proceeded to go there. 

As they arrived the shop was closed and had to turn back but the street was too narrow and it was a dead end, so she decided to reverse on a empty lot between two houses so that she can drive forward instead of reversing. So as they were reversing in the empty lot they suddenly hit a water pipe that was not visable on sight, and it started squirting water. 

My GF panicked and left the scene so now she felt bad of it and iss worried if she should go back and have it fixed, lend money to whoever owns that lot to pay for damages, perhaps go to the Barangay and report her mistake. She is concerned that she may be reported if she was caught on video (cctv) and may file and complaint and she didnt want that. Whats the best course of action for this situation?

1mk0qtz,https://www.reddit.com/r/GERD/comments/1mk0qtz/anyone_else_have_these_symptoms_and_esophageal/,Anyone else have these symptoms and Esophageal Hypersensitivity?,"Hi everyone,

In May, I came home and felt sick. The next few days, I got heartburn and then a burning in my stomach that lasted for days at a time. It felt like pure acid in my stomach. Then I felt the acid and what felt like vomit come up to my throat while I was sleeping.  I took a PPI for 2 weeks from a virtual doctor, but then I lost my job and insurance. After 1 month or so, I was able to finally get back on insurance and back on PPI and Famotidine for 6 weeks. I had an EGD, and it came back completely normal. I have worked on changing my diet in the interim to very limited things and trying different supplements. I'm currently trying to wean off the PPI and just use the famotidine twice a day. The meds help a tiny bit, but I've continued to have symptoms throughout. 

I guess I'm wondering if you guys think this might be esophageal hypersensitivity now? I couldn't get a follow-up appointment with my GI until the end of September, so I'm trying to figure out what I can do. I'm debating if I should try an antidepressant at this point.

My symptoms currently include:

Burning throat

Sour or poop taste in back of mouth

Burning nose

clearing throat

burping (so much burping)

Ear pressure

White tongue

Clearing throat

Burning sensation in lips and mouth

Occasional reflux feeling after eating

Post nasal drip

  
On top of this, I also have been dealing with parosmia and dysgeusia where eggs smell and taste rotten and coffee smells like skunk.

Just figured I'd post to see if anyone can relate and has found an answer.

  
Thank you!

So, I’ve been having a hard time sleeping these days. Like, I go to bed tired but when I lie down, my brain just won’t stop thinking about random stuff. Sometimes I wake up in the middle of the night and can’t fall back asleep for a long time. It’s really frustrating because then I feel tired and slow the next day.

I try to do normal things — like not use phone before bed, don’t drink coffee late, and even try relaxing music — but nothing really works well.",1,1754574862.0,sleep,0,1.0,False

So you know how it’s believed that even trace amounts of gluten can trigger the same reaction as larger amounts in those who are sensitive? I’m wondering, does that apply to wheat as well? Or could I still enjoy small amounts of wheat, like what’s used in fried chicken? I know everybody’s body reacts differently but in my case the symptoms are very subtle.

1mk0psy,https://i.redd.it/3l4zdw0drlhf1.png,Basic Challenge Run: 25% Profitability,"As a challenge for myself, I wanted to attempt to see how different the game was at a 25% profit margin. For reference, the price of seeds is also reduced down to 25%, but everything else is the same price (e.g. buildings, tool upgrades, animals, etc.). Going into this challenge I knew I’d have to be more thrifty than I have been in the past - many strategies would not make sense because the cost of items was so skewed. One early strategy in particular I couldn’t rely on - smoking fish. Since 1.6 this has been a strong go-to for me for early game money. I use the broad threshold of “150 g base value” of fish to determine if it is worth smoking, as that is roughly the cost of buying coal from Clint in year 1. This makes sure I am not wasting a ton of coal smoking fish that have a value of 12 g as an example. Below are some details of my playthrough - Spring 1 of Year 2 seemed like a good natural stopping point.



Tools and the backpack upgrade are a struggle. I am used to having a lot more space, so waiting to upgrade the backpack means placing chests throughout the valley to store stuff and then having to ferry it back and forth. Despite what I read before, Strawberries are now only 25 g at the egg festival; so that’s a good early source of money to start. 



I was very lucky and found 3 ancient seeds on Spring 19 killing bugs. I’ll plant those and harvest them throughout the year; I won’t actually sell any ancient fruit in this playthrough but I’ll have it ready to plant in the Greenhouse when I make that upgrade. The smoker is not worthwhile as an early investment - I don’t want to spend 10,000 g when one of the best fish I can catch is only worth 112 g (Gold Catfish with Fishing level 10) to start. The payback on that will be long term.



Normally I don’t bother with fertilizer. Now that every penny counts, I am making sure to use it on my one-off crops to get that marginal extra benefit of additional silver and gold harvests. 



Bulletin Board Requests are Big Money - relative to the value of other activities, they pay particularly well and also give me friendship points with the villagers.



The game starts per normal, getting my farm cleared, gathering the spring bundle foragables, getting all my key crops in the ground. My first upgrade is the Watering Can on Spring 21, since it will be raining on the 22nd. I also built a Silo on Spring 21. 



Rare seeds are not a priority - while normally I would try to bank a bunch for my first fall, most will actually LOSE money since they cost 1,000 g from the travelling merchant. I’ll try to get 1 - 2 planted (for obvious reasons I won’t spoil).



I thought that preserves jars may be more beneficial than kegs in this playthrough; but it’s 25% after it’s been processed. So a standard Parsnip is 35 g, and pickled 120 g. At 25% it’s 8 g, Pickled 30 g. If you have empty preserves jars it’s still worth throwing things in there for the extra cash. 



Getting “Best Neighbor Award” on Spring 22 felt like winning 2nd prize in a Beauty contest. I needed that 500 g!  On Spring 23 I upgrade the Backpack to level 2 - Not having the 2nd row is too limiting and worth the investment to me. 



Since I am trying to fix up the community center, I am checking the Travelling Merchant every Friday and Sunday to try to save money. On Spring 26 I buy a Solar Essence. I will eventually find plenty in the deeper parts of the mine but this was modest enough in cost to make it worthwhile to me. 



On Spring 28 I buy the Fiberglass Rod. Once my plants are watered, Fishing is a good neutral energy activity I can take on to make a bit of extra cash on days where it’s not raining and I’m not in the mines (since I can eat fish when I am low on energy). 



By Summer 1, I have 3,783 g in my pocket, having earned a total of 12,981 g. 



I upgraded the Pickaxe on Summer 2 to Copper in order to dig in the mines a bit faster. This is my usual upgrade path as well. I plant blueberries, melons, and the other summer crops I need for the various bundles. 



On Summer 7 I spend 3,125 g buying a Truffle from the Travelling Merchant. This is painful in the short term (I am down to 783 g on hand), but allows me to avoid upgrading the barn to it’s maximum size for a long time while still completing the community center.



Now that I have a bait maker, time for some targeted fishing - Sturgeon up first, starting on Summer 8. I also unlock the Minecarts on Summer 11 allowing me to zip around the valley a bit faster. Back at the Travelling Merchant I buy a Sandfish on Summer 13. Now I can afford to wait on upgrading the Vault for some time. Eventually I’ll need some Eggs, so I start the Coop on Summer 14. I upgrade my Axe to Copper on Summer 16. 



Lots of Bulletin Board activity means I get an apple sapling from the Prize Machine on Summer 19. I also spend a lot of time fishing - using targeted bait, I catch 9 Sturgeon for 837 g (plus another 317 g from other random fish).



The Trout Derby prizes are handy, and easy with a bait maker. I end up catching a total of 44 trout over the 2 days, selling for 1,590 g. I end up getting 2 Quality Sprinklers which I’ll plug into my setup immediately to save energy watering. 



By Summer 22, I upgrade the Pickaxe to Iron and buy a Calendar. On Summer 27 I buy the price catalog from the bookseller so I have a better idea of the relative value of items from one another (up until now it’s been either intuition or checking the wiki). By now I’ve been mining enough that I have enough gold and silver to craft 20 total sprinklers, allowing me to fill out one scarecrow of crops. If I were to do this again, I think I probably would want twice as many crops going into the fall, as the incremental amount is so low that doubling the size would make sense in terms of my level of time invested. Lucky me - at the end of Summer, the Travelling Merchant has a Red Cabbage Seed for sale for 800. I’ll buy that and hopefully get it planted in the Greenhouse before the end of the year.



By Fall 1, I have 12,387 g on me, having earned a total of 52,722 lifetime. 



On Fall 2, I upgrade my Axe to Steel. I skipped doing this earlier because the Strange Rainstorm allowed me to get Fiddleheads without having to get into the Secret Woods. I catch some Tiger Trout, Walleye, and a Ghost Fish - I just need the Woodskip to finish the Fish Tank Bundle. By Fall 4 I have my Steel Axe, and catch the Woodskip to complete the Fish Tank.



I’ve started getting the Special Order Board Quests as well, which are good money for the effort. My first one is the Juicy Bugs Quest which I finish Fall 5, netting me an additional 3,000 g. I also find an Apricot in my Bat Cave (completing the Artisan Bundle). 



Fall 6 I finally buy the “Big Chest” upgrade from Robin allowing me to upgrade my storage at the farm, since my setup was getting a bit crowded. Fall 8 I start building a Barn. I complete the “Community Cleanup” quest on Fall 10, and unlock the Sewers on Fall 11. I buy 2 Cows, since I need more Animal Products for the Pantry bundles. I luck out with a Cactus Fruit at the Travelling Merchant on Fall 12, allowing me to finish the exotic foraging bundle. I upgrade my Hoe to Copper. 



Lots of Fishing now that I am mostly setup and looking to earn gold - on Fall 13 it rains and I catch 22 Catfish, 6 walleye, and lots of other fish, for a total of 3,315 g. In retrospect, I should have upgraded to the Iridium Rod earlier, and used the Quality Bobbers. The Upgrade to Iridium Quality fish makes a big difference in the value. 



On Fall 14 I start upgrading to a Big Barn, since I need a Duck to finish some bundles. I win the Stardew Valley Fair with 92 points (my lowest score in a while!). I gamble a bit and end up buying the Stardrop from the booth. 



On fall 17 I buy a Duck, and go fishing since it’s raining, catching 3,232 g of fish. On fall 18 I get to the bottom of the mines, and buy the Iridium Rod. I start fishing in the evening at the beach to catch Super Cucumbers. Since I haven’t had a place for tackle I have plenty saved up, so I go through 2 dressed spinners on Fall 19 - catching 33 catfish, 2 walleye, and 5 shad, for a total of 4,362 g of fish. 



On Fall 22 my first sweet gem berry is done, and I use it. Fall 23 I upgrade the pickaxe to gold. I buy the dehydrator recipe on fall 25, and immediately craft 6 to start chewing through a bunch of blueberries and other fruits and mushrooms I have banked away. I also get a Fish Smoker from the Prize Machine, and will start smoking higher value fish. I sell my other sweet gem berry for 937, a net loss. 



On Fall 26 I get a Pomegranate from the Travelling Merchant, and sell my first batch of dried fruit - 2,386 g. On Fall 27 I start building a big barn since it looks like I’ll need a goat. On fall 28 I buy a 2nd heater, since it’s going to get chilly for my animals (I received my 1st heater from an earlier bundle). Since it’s hard to see the Apples with my current tapper setup, I end up moving the apple sapling to under my peach tree for next year. 



By Winter 1, I have 4,654 g on hand, having earned 130,439 g so far. 



I find a Duck Feather on Winter 2, and buy a Goat on Winter 3. I also find a Snow Yam, letting me finish the Craft’s Room. I have been building kegs and storing them out in the open (who can afford a shed?), and my first batch of Pumpkin Juice is complete. I get 11,562 g from Farming, 12,840 g for the day. On Winter 4 I complete Robin’s Resource Rush and get 2,500 g, and go into the Quarry Dungeon to grab the Golden Scythe. By Winter 5 I feel I have enough cash to buy the final backpack upgrade. I also buy an Iridium Sprinkler from Krobus - I want to have 4 total in my greenhouse by the time I unlock it, and it’s a bit cheaper to buy them from him than to unlock the Vault. Now that I can smoke my fish, I start doing so as I am fishing. I sell 9 smoked sturgeon (and other fish) for 3,532 g. 



On Winter 6, Emily is kind enough to send me a bit of Wool in the mail - the last thing I need to finish the Pantry Bundle and unlock the greenhouse. I will still care and feed for my extraneous goat regardless. I keep fishing sturgeon and smoking them, netting over 5,000 g from fishing. I am saving up for the Vault now. 



On Winter 7 I have the greenhouse setup. I’ve been harvesting my ancient fruits and making seeds all year since I planted them, so I have a lot ready to go already. I plant 46 ancient fruit seeds, my red cabbage, and some coffee I’ve found in the mines.



By Winter 12, I buy a 3rd Iridium Sprinkler from Krobus, and finish the Vault to Repair the bus. Squid Fest the next day is easy because I have targeted bait, but the prizes are very handy. I sell my first batch of wine for 6,110 of a variety of different fruits I had tucked away. 



Winter 14 I head to the desert for the first time. I buy 10 beet seeds, and am lucky enough to win an Autopetter on Floor 47! This run has had all sorts of luck going for it; perhaps because of clean living. I’ve been storing Jade for some time and have swapped them into staircases (I think I had about 10 to start), and crafted a bunch of megabombs to clear out rocks. I eventually get down to floor 86 before calling it quits for the night, with 65 iridium ore. 



Winter 15 the Night Market starts. I fish for Sturgeon all day, then use the Seafoam Pudding I won earlier to fish on the Submarine. I craft quality bobbers in order to maximize the value of fish I catch. 



Winter 16 Qi sends me 10,000 g in the mail for getting past floor 25 in the Skull Cavern. I harvest the Red cabbage. I smoke the fish I caught the previous night, selling them for 5,395 g with many more remaining. 



On Winter 17 I finish the “Biome Balance” Special Order, getting 1,500 g (Lucky, it was too many Lake Fish - took care of that easily enough!). I also find a Lucky Ring panning at the Night Market (!).



Winter 18 I start constructing a Deluxe Coop since I will eventually need a rabbit. Smoking the backlog of Night Market fish nets me 8,381 g.



Continuing a streak of remarkable luck, the Travelling Merchant has a rabbit’s foot for sale on Winter 19. Sold! I create a cookout kit to make a fried egg, and I have completed the community center in year 1. 



After celebrating on the 20th, I finish the Mysterious Qi quest on the 21st. On the 27th working on the Cave Patrol for Bats I find a Prismastic Shard off of a Dust Sprite. I get 6,000 g for clearing the cave of Bats, and buy a rabbit. On the 28th I take the Prismatic Shard to the desert and call it a year. 



By Spring 1, Year 2 I have 48,492 g on hand, having earned a total of 306,652. 



As with many of my Saves, I took this on in an attempt to “Slow down, and really enjoy myself. You don’t have to get everything finished right away!”. That proved to be a false hope, as I seemed even more keen on squeezing every last drop of profit out of the farm in order to maximize my return. I got pretty lucky throughout, which certainly contributed to my ability to finish the Community Center in the 1st year. A variety of gold saving tactics proved helpful as well. I normally would build a shed for kegs, but felt that 35,000 g, 850 wood and 300 stone could be put to better use. Additionally - I never upgraded my farm house - the cookout kit is available at Foraging Level 3 and lets you cook all day. I find I don’t end up needing to actually cook that frequently, since I can do it in big batches. When I finally fried my egg on Winter 19, I also made a bunch of triple shot espressos, and a few odds and ends I had the ingredients for like Roots Platters. I was surprised how much I ended up fishing; having thought that would not be a worthwhile use of time early on given how little each individual fish was worth. It’s possible there were better uses of my time to earn money but that was what made sense to me in the moment. Going back, I probably would have Dehydrated *less* \- I built 6 in a flurry, and chewed through a ton of fruits and mushrooms very quickly. By the end, I didn’t have any worthwhile fruits to throw in my kegs, despite having 40 odd empty ones waiting. Like the Fish Smoker, 2 - 3 Dehydrators would probably go a long way - I felt with 1 Fish Smoker I was about 1 short of what would allow me to reliably smoke all the fish I caught in a given day while I was out fishing. 



That seems like more than enough for now - feel free to comment below if you have any thoughts or questions!

Review Here,"The Srempat GRCC002 14-Cup Carafe caught my attention when my trusty old glass coffee pot decided to betray me mid-morning. Coffee enthusiasts like me know the vital role a coffee carafe plays, so it wasn’t a decision I took lightly. This replacement carafe claims compatibility with popular Cuisinart coffee maker models like the DCC-3200 and DCC-2200, so it checked the initial boxes for what I needed. Over the past couple of weeks, I’ve tested it every single morning, determined to see if it lives up to the hype.

**Design and Build Quality**  
Durability and design come first to mind when describing this carafe. Crafted from borosilicate glass, the build feels exceptionally strong, and it’s noticeably more robust than my previous pot. I’ve already knocked it gently against the sink once (whoops), and to my immense relief, there wasn’t even a scratch. The condensation resistance touted in its specifications is legit—no unsightly streaks after pouring out my coffee. The black ergonomic handle also deserves praise. It has a subtle curve that offers a reliable grip, even when my hands are groggy from waking up at 5 a.m. Its round shape, paired with the modern aesthetic, seamlessly aligns with my minimalist kitchen vibe.

**Capacity**  
At 14 cups, this carafe has proven to be a savior for big family breakfasts or when I’ve had coworkers swinging by for brainstorming sessions in the morning. Unlike its smaller counterparts, it genuinely holds enough coffee to ensure everyone gets their caffeine fix. The markings are accurate too, which might seem small, but they prevent overfilling disasters. I don’t want to relive the day I filled my old carafe without proper markers—let’s just say, coffee was everywhere.

**Benefits**  
- Easy compatibility with popular coffee makers like the DCC-3200 and its variants.  
- Durable borosilicate glass holds up well under regular use.  
- Ergonomic handle does a great job of making pouring effortless.  
- Wide-mouth design and detachable lid simplify cleaning.  
- Dishwasher-safe, though I prefer the control of a gentle hand wash.  

**Ease of Use**  
One thing I immediately appreciated was how user-friendly this coffee pot is. The wide-mouth design is not just a talking point—it’s functional. Cleaning it out is so much easier compared to my old carafe, which always had frustrating nooks and crannies that trapped residue. The detachable lid is another thoughtful feature that simplifies rinsing. Plus, the dripless spout keeps my counters free from rogue spills (though my sleepy self sometimes still manages to overshoot the mug).

[Check Srempat GRCC002 price on Amazon.](https://idealcoffeeshop.com/price/b0ddc6bhwd/)  

**Negatives**  
- The carafe can feel a bit heavier compared to basic glass models, which might not suit everyone.  
- Only compatible with specific Cuisinart coffee maker models, so it’s not a universal fit.  
- The black lid and handle, while stylish, are prone to showing smudges and fingerprints.

**Performance Under Pressure**  
In terms of resilience, this carafe has already been through its paces. Daily exposure to hot liquids hasn’t dulled its clarity, and it retains heat better than expected. The spout design is precise—you won’t find stray drips making trails down the body after pouring. For someone who’s a stickler for reliability in small kitchen gadgets, I find it meets my expectations.

**Other Options**  
While exploring alternatives, I came across standard replacement carafes for similar coffee makers. A notable competitor is the official Cuisinart replacement carafe. While Cuisinart’s version also offers good durability, I found the Srempat pot to be superior in terms of design and weight balance. Another rival worth mentioning is the Black+Decker carafe, which boasts decent compatibility but falls behind when it comes to the sleek design and thermal resistance of this glass pot. The Srempat carafe also beats its alternatives in pricing, offering a solid product at a less intimidating cost.

**Price to Quality Ratio**  
This replacement carafe undoubtedly positions itself as a value-packed option for coffee lovers. Compared to pricier alternatives, it delivers both in aesthetics and functionality without breaking the bank. Plus, the longevity I’ve observed so far suggests it’s a smart investment for long-term use. If you’re looking to restore your coffee maker to its former glory without spending a fortune on official replacements, this carafe fits the bill nicely.

1mk0p7w,https://www.reddit.com/r/BadBosses/comments/1mk0p7w/hypocritic_micro_manager/,Hypocritic Micro manager,"Hi, just here to rant.
I joined a new company 4 months back. Its a MNC (in India). There is this senior manager guy (who is not my reporting manager) who irritates me everyday.

See, this guy is an old dude, 20 years experience in the IT industry, he is of the same office location as me. My reporting manager, who is also a senior manager (but only with 14 years of experience)is based out of a different city.
This guy is the second most senior in our team after our director. 

He always fabricates fake stories to scare people like saying that if we dont respond to manager's pings whatever is the time, we will be sent out of the team quoting that there used to be a 'guy' who was sent out like that...except that nobody else has heard about this so called 'guy'. More importantly he talks, when i say talks, he just talks so so much. 

Last week he clearly stated to our director that his team is struggling with bandwidth issues and needs someone from my manager to support their work. And on that same day, he and his reportee, both of them spent 4 hours on a side project which was clearly mentioned to be worked upon when we have some lean time (or down time). 

And he forcibly takes us on coffee breaks (good that he buys us coffee) and talks about how he used to be the best known employee till date, which made him climb ranks...
I am not an idiot, I have 5 years of experience and I am a senior analyst. Though this guy has no contol over me, he indirectly tell his reportee, who is of the same grade as me, to tell me to stay in the office for a minimum of 8 hours for 4 days a week (actually we dont have such a policy, company policy states that we can do a minimum of 5 hours a day, for 3 days a week). Whereas when I joined my manager told me that I can do 5 hours a day for 3 days a week and he doesn't care about all this as long as the work is done.

Simply put, this guy is being toxic with his fear mongering, lies, trying to control others...",2,1754574790.0,BadBosses,1,1.0,False
1mk0or8,https://www.reddit.com/r/BuiltToTest/comments/1mk0or8/investigate_if_the_best_ice_maker_lg_eau60783827/,Investigate if the best ice maker LG EAU60783827 really delivers,"The LG EAU60783827 Ice Maker Assembly has been part of my daily routine for several weeks now, and I’m here to spill all the ice — literally and figuratively. It’s not every day that I get this pumped about a refrigerator component, but this one genuinely sparked some interesting observations, both good and not-so-good. Whether you’re on the edge about replacing your auger motor or just curious about life inside a freezer, here’s what I discovered.

**Design and Build Quality**  
I was mildly impressed by how sleek the ice maker assembly is for something that hides behind closed refrigerator doors. LG knows how to make functional parts look stylish, even if they’re just for internal use. The white color matches a broad range of refrigerator interiors, ensuring it doesn’t look out of place. Made with durable materials, the ice maker feels like it can survive the continuous stress of dispensing ice day in and day out. The dimensions — 4 inches deep, 11.25 inches wide, and 14.37 inches tall — make it a compact yet robust addition to your freezer's ecosystem.

**Performance Under Pressure**  
Testing the auger motor was fascinating; it worked flawlessly to dispense ice without jamming or hesitating. Unlike the inconsistent ice dispensers I’ve battled with in the past, this motor efficiently drives the auger mechanism with smooth, reliable movement. While it claims to be engineered for exact specifications, I gave it no special treatment and threw my usual freezer chaos at it. Even after repeated use in high-humidity conditions, it maintained steady performance. Whether it’s crushing ice for summer slushies or dispensing whole cubes, it handles its job well.

[Check LG EAU60783827 price on Amazon.](https://vendm.com/p/b00lkokvqi/)  

**Ease of Installation**  
I found the installation process straightforward, provided you follow the owner's manual or have some background in repairs. For a non-pro like me, it was a solid two-coffee-morning project. Make sure you use proper safety precautions, like disconnecting the refrigerator before diving into this DIY adventure. While I prefer calling a professional for more complicated repairs, this one was manageable with just a bit of patience and the right tools. Pro tip: Always double-check the model number compatibility before purchasing.

**Winning Points**  
- Strong OEM design ensures a long-lasting performance.  
- Smooth ice dispensing with minimal jamming.  
- Compact build doesn’t take up unnecessary space within the refrigerator.  
- Replaces multiple outdated parts, cutting troubleshooting time.  

**Deficiencies**  
- Some users might find self-installation challenging if they’re not familiar with appliance repairs.  
- It lacks a more comprehensive guide for first-time DIY repair attempts.  
- The motor creates a bit of noise during operation, although nothing alarming.  

**Peer Products**  
Comparing this ice maker assembly to some competitors left me sneaking a smile. Many aftermarket parts struggle when it comes to maintaining smooth ice dispensing, often resulting in that dreaded freezer traffic jam. A popular alternative I looked into had a slightly quieter motor, but it wasn’t an OEM-quality build and had questionable long-term reliability. LG's part edges out standard replacements by offering durability and more precise engineering. That being said, if ultra-quiet operation is your top priority, you might want to explore specialty third-party options. Still, balancing noise levels with reliability makes this assembly the one I’d prefer keeping in my freezer.

**Cost-Effectiveness**  
While it’s tempting to cut corners and save money upfront, the longer-term performance of this ice maker assembly makes it a solid investment. Replacing it with a cheaper replica might save a few bucks initially, but sacrificing LG’s quality often leads to recurring repair costs. Considering its durability and robust engineering, it feels like you’re getting an excellent return on your initial expense while avoiding potential headaches.

1mk0lit,https://www.reddit.com/r/transtrans/comments/1mk0lit/my_honest_opinions_on_dating_trans_women/,My honest opinions on dating trans women.,"So I've been a cis man my whole life and recently the last 9 months or so started dating trans women I find a woman I vib with and go out on dates. For one reason or another things haven't worked out yet with anyone because of distance between us or schedules or just wanting different things in life. I only date one women at a time I don't juggle multiple women that's dishonest I believe. But here's the main differences I've noticed between dating cis women and trans women. 

1. Messaging. Cis women usually only respond with simple one word like ok, or sure or something like that trans women are usually more talkative and better at communicating especially in the initial stages of communicating. 

2. Trans women have realistic expectations cis women all want a perfect 10 and it seems will only settle for a guy who is a 7 or 8. 

3. Trans woman are usually looking for genuine connections where as cis women are usually looking for a sugar daddy to pay for everything 

4. Trans women appreciate kind thoughtful or romantic gestures more. 

5.  Trans woman are more fun it would seem as they enjoy going on picnics going out or just watching a movie together. Cis women seem to want every date to be extraordinary and magical and are less willing to say go grab a coffee and just talk. 

6. Sex. So I haven't had sex with all the women I've dated nor have I expected to either but when I have the sex is amazing with trans women we go hours and orgasm multiple times and they them more sexual and more horny than cis women who go like 20 mins and are done for a few days. . . . 

These are just my honest observations I know every person is different and can't fix people into boxes but as a whole I'd say dating trans women is the best relationship decision I've ever made and I hope I find a trans women that I can actually mesh with so well she becomes my wife someday. 

Any straight men out there that want to date trans women but are scared for one reason or another don't be you will be shocked at how much better they are than cis women. The social stigma is almost none existent too I thought at first people with gawk and stare at us when we were out but honestly that rarely happens, and when it does I just stare back her. Ask them politely what their problem is and they stop. 

And trans women thank you for being so open to dating regular guys I mean I'm 6' 180lbs I'm a supervisor and divorced 36 years old moderately handsome and cis women would just think of me as not worthy to grace their presence lol but trans women actually give me a chance and I have had such a wonderful time and really felt valued and respected as a man and i believe more straight men will start dating trans women as the quality of people are a lot of the times higher in that community. Not to knock all cis women though either again just my 2 cents. ",0,1754574521.0,transtrans,10,0.09,False

1mk0kv6,https://www.reddit.com/r/EverydayAppliance/comments/1mk0kv6/explore_best_cold_brew_coffee_maker_kitchenaid/,Explore Best Cold Brew Coffee Maker KitchenAid Worth the Hype,"Brewing a smooth, crisp cold coffee at home always felt like an unattainable art until I stumbled upon the KitchenAid KCM5912SX. As someone who can't start their day without a good cold brew, I found diving into the world of this cold brew coffee maker both exciting and practical. The promise of a luxurious homemade coffee experience intrigued me. Spoiler: there’s a lot to love, but not without a couple of hiccups along the way.

**Aesthetic and Build Quality**  
Right out of the box, the KitchenAid KCM5912SX radiates elegance. Its compact design, featuring brushed stainless steel and premium glass, felt both sturdy and high-end. Measuring 8 inches deep by 7.2 inches wide and 8.48 inches tall, it’s incredibly user-friendly for tight fridge spaces. Despite its manageable footprint, it still holds an impressive 38 ounces of coffee concentrate. While I appreciated the streamlined modern design, the weight of 6.57 pounds took me by surprise the first time I picked it up. It'll stay perfectly still on your countertop, but carrying it – especially filled – requires a bit of muscle.  

**Ease of Use and Features**  
Brewing coffee shouldn’t feel like a chore, and thankfully, it didn’t with this model. The KitchenAid cold brew system shines through its simplicity. Add your freshly ground coffee to the reusable stainless steel steeper, fill the glass carafe with filtered water, pop it in your fridge, and let it chill for at least 12 hours. That’s it! The steeper’s labeled fill-level indicators were incredibly useful, eliminating any guesswork from the brewing process.  

The built-in stainless steel tap was another thoughtful touch. Pouring a fresh glass of cold brew straight from my fridge felt oddly satisfying. And the carrying handle—simple but effective—makes it portable if you're feeling fancy enough to bring cold brew to a picnic or share a jug at family brunch. Mind you, this isn't a gadget designed for speed; the manual brewing style demands patience, but it rewards you with that smooth, rich coffee flavor.

**Advantages**  
- Reusable stainless steel steeper promotes sustainability.  
- Built-in tap ensures easy dispensing, avoiding spills.  
- Compact dimensions fit snugly into most fridges.  
- Glass and stainless steel materials preserve coffee flavor.  

[Check KitchenAid KCM5912SX price on Amazon.](https://ikerz.com/p/b07g4w8s7k/)

**Performance and Flavor Quality**  
After trying various ratios of coffee concentrate to water or milk, the results consistently impressed me. The flavor is deep, smooth, and rich, providing that full-bodied caffeine hit without the bitterness you get from some other manual methods. I couldn't resist experimenting a little – vanilla almond milk, oat milk, you name it! Every cup tasted like it came from my favorite boutique coffee shop. The claim of 19 servings per batch held true. For someone like me, who enjoys a daily cup, knowing that the cold brew concentrate stays fresh for up to two weeks is a game-changer.  

That’s not to say it’s perfect. The steeping process, though easy, takes at least half a day. Impatient morning caffeine-cravers – I’m looking at you here – might struggle to plan ahead.  

**Critiques**  
- Brewing requires patience; no instant gratification here.  
- The carafe can feel bulky and heavy when filled.  
- Cleaning the steeper can be tedious, with fine coffee particles sticking to it.  

**Competing Brands**  
It’s impossible to ignore the competition when buying a cold brew maker. For instance, the OXO Brew Cold Brew Coffee Maker offers a similar glass carafe system but incorporates an automatic draining brewing base, making post-brew cleanup slightly easier. However, OXO’s footprint is bulkier, and it lacks the portability charm of the KitchenAid. Likewise, the Takeya Patented Deluxe Cold Brew Coffee Maker is a strong alternative, being more lightweight and budget-friendly, but it sacrifices the premium design and taste purity delivered by this cold brew champion. If elegance and flavor integrity are your priorities, this model edges past these competitors.

**Financial Value**  
Investing in cold brew makers like the KitchenAid KCM5912SX does beg the question: is it worth the cost compared to, say, a weekly café trip? Personally, I’ve already tallied the savings. Buying jars of coffee concentrate at gourmet cafes can add up quickly. With this device creating premium-quality brews from the comfort of home, I easily justify the expense. The durable design assures me it won’t conk out anytime soon—sustainability for both the planet and my wallet.

1mk0hn1,https://www.reddit.com/r/HomeApplianceHelp/comments/1mk0hn1/evaluate_the_best_coffee_maker_keurig_k1500_for/,Evaluate the Best Coffee Maker Keurig K1500 for Office Use,"Testing out the Keurig K1500 has been a game-changer in my daily coffee routines, both at home and in a small office setup. Initially, I wasn’t sure if combining something built for commercial use into a personal space would feel overwhelming, but I quickly realized how well-designed and user-friendly this coffee maker is. What stood out immediately was the thoughtful balance between its robust performance and sleek design, making it suitable for environments with up to 15 people while still being manageable in smaller spaces.

**Design and Build Quality**  
The minimalist black finish feels premium without screaming for attention, fitting nicely on my kitchen counter without taking up too much real estate. With dimensions of 10.3"" x 12.4"" x 12.1"", it doesn’t dominate your countertop, yet it’s spacious enough to house its impressive brewing features. The 96 oz. water reservoir is a lifesaver; it means fewer refills, and the handle makes carrying it over to the sink super simple. Once, I accidentally dropped the water tank, but no cracks—props to the durable material here. The buttons on the interface are incredibly intuitive, and the indicator lights gently remind you of what needs attention.

**Performance**  
There’s no other way to say it—this coffee machine is a workhorse. I tested all four brewing sizes (6 oz., 8 oz., 10 oz., and 12 oz.) to see how consistent it is. Each cup was perfectly brewed without tasting diluted or too strong, but the star of the show is the “STRONG” button. Seriously, for those of us who sometimes need that extra kickstart in the morning or mid-afternoon, it delivers. The boldness in flavor is noticeable but not overpowering, elevating even average coffee pods to something delightful.

[Grab Keurig K1500 deals on Amazon—Check here.](https://cyberlyber.com/p/b07m67x3gn/)

**Quiet Brew Technology**  
One thing that bugs me about appliances is how loud they can get, but this coffee maker is remarkably quiet. It’s labeled as having ""Quiet Brew Technology,"" and I can confirm it is no empty claim. Whether I’m brewing coffee early in the morning before others are awake or during a conference call at work, the noise is barely noticeable. It's these small touches that make it more pleasant to use daily.

**Compatibility and Coffee Options**  
The sheer variety of compatible K-Cup pods is another thing that keeps drawing me back to this coffee maker. With over 150 options across multiple brands to choose from, I’ve discovered new flavors I would’ve never tried otherwise. Yes, you can experiment with hot cocoa, tea, or seasonal blends like pumpkin spice without skipping a beat. A friend even risked using a third-party reusable pod, and it worked fine, though Keurig probably doesn’t recommend it officially.

**Pluses**  
- Large 96 oz. reservoir means fewer refills, saving time.  
- The STRONG button genuinely enhances flavor without bitterness.  
- Brews at multiple sizes with consistency in temperature and taste.  

**Shortcomings**  
- It’s slightly bulkier than non-commercial coffee makers, so tight spaces might feel cramped.  
- Could offer more refined programmable settings for advanced users.  
- The STRONG feature doesn’t support larger cup sizes as well as small ones.  

**Competing Products**  
Compared to other single-serve machines I’ve tried in the past, like the Nespresso Vertuo or the Hamilton Beach FlexBrew, the Keurig K1500 strikes a slightly better balance of price and versatility. The Nespresso delivers higher-end espresso-style beverages but locks you into proprietary pods, while the Hamilton Beach model lacks the polish and attention to detail in user-friendly features like the strong brew button or a quiet brewing process. Keurig feels like a happy medium for families and small teams looking to keep a variety of users happy.

**Money’s Worth**  
In terms of day-to-day cost efficiency, I find that the Keurig strikes an excellent price-to-quality ratio. The variety of beverages, strong brewing capability, large reservoir size, and durability easily justify its investment. Over time, the cost per cup is reasonable, and the convenience factor of avoiding repetitive cleanup, thanks to single-serve pods, adds to the appeal.

1mk0gyp,https://www.reddit.com/r/ReviewedAppliances/comments/1mk0gyp/evaluate_the_best_coffee_maker_brentwood_ts213w/,Evaluate the Best Coffee Maker Brentwood TS-213W Worth Buying,"There was a time I needed a compact coffee maker that didn’t take up half my countertop and still delivered a decent cup of coffee to get my mornings started right. That’s how I ended up testing the Brentwood TS-213W. I'll admit, off the bat, it impressed me with its simple and minimalistic design. A clean white finish, paired with a lightweight build, makes it look like it belongs in any cozy kitchen setup. It’s also incredibly compact, fitting snugly into small spaces, which was a win for my already-cluttered kitchen. The simplicity is a breath of fresh air—no frills or over-complicated controls to deal with. For someone who gets overwhelmed with unnecessary choices, this coffee maker was easy to appreciate.

**Ease of Operation**  
Operating this coffee maker is probably one of the most refreshing parts of the experience. You add water, scoop in your coffee grounds, and push a button—boom, you’re brewing coffee. Whether you’re a Monday morning zombie like I often am or someone who can’t deal with complicated coffee gadgets, this is your friend. The reusable filter basket is another nice touch. It’s eco-friendly, saves money on paper filters, and is a convenient feature for day-to-day use. The built-in water level window, too, was a small but much-appreciated addition—it helps you keep track without fumbling around or guessing.

**Pros**  
- Compact and space-saving design  
- Easy, one-button operation  
- Comes with a reusable filter basket  
- Built-in water level window for added convenience  

[Check Brentwood TS-213W price on Amazon.](https://cncgn.com/p/b01cgc9axc/)  

**Coffee Brewing Performance**  
This little guy claims to be a 4-cup coffee maker, and I have to say, it lives up to that description. Whether you’re brewing just for yourself or a small group, it handles the job decently. The warming plate on the bottom keeps the coffee hot for a while, which is great when you get sidetracked (or just forget to pour your coffee on time, like I often do). However, let your coffee sit too long, and you might notice a slight overcooked taste, which isn’t uncommon with warming plates.

**Cons**  
- Can make coffee taste overcooked if kept too long on the warming plate  
- Lacks advanced features seen in larger machines  
- Drip performance can vary slightly with grind size  

**Build Quality and Durability**  
For four weeks, I used this machine every day before tossing it under the strenuous schedule of my in-laws during a weekend family visit. Despite the lightweight design, it stood up to frequent usage remarkably well. It’s mostly made of plastic, so it’s not something you’d describe as super high-end, but it managed fine without any cracks or performance issues under consistent use. It is entirely BPA-free, which is a comforting thought for those worried about health-related concerns.

**Competing Products**  
When compared to some budget drip coffee makers like those from Black+Decker and Mr. Coffee, the Brentwood TS-213W holds its ground surprisingly well. It doesn’t have all the bells and whistles like programmable timers or brew-strength selectors, but it does arguably deliver better simplicity and convenience. While the competitors feel more like jack-of-all-trades, this coffee maker focuses purely on delivering straightforward, minimalistic coffee brewing. Black+Decker, while offering features like delayed brew, takes up significantly more counter space—something you won’t worry about with this one.

**Cost-Effectiveness**  
Given its functionality and convenience, I’d say it’s a good budget option for small households or single users. It does cut corners on having extra features, but what it does, it does decently. For many, including myself, it balances the price-to-quality ratio fairly well. If you’re looking for a coffee maker for an affordable cost, this ticks the box nicely.

I only date one women at a time I don't juggle multiple women that's dishonest I believe. But here's the main differences I've noticed between dating cis women and trans women. 

1. Messaging. Cis women usually only respond with simple one word like ok, or sure or something like that trans women are usually more talkative and better at communicating especially in the initial stages of communicating. 

2. Trans women have realistic expectations cis women all want a perfect 10 and it seems will only settle for a guy who is a 7 or 8. 

3. Trans woman are usually looking for genuine connections where as cis women are usually looking for a sugar daddy to pay for everything 

4. Trans women appreciate kind thoughtful or romantic gestures more. 

5.  Trans woman are more fun it would seem as they enjoy going on picnics going out or just watching a movie together. Cis women seem to want every date to be extraordinary and magical and are less willing to say go grab a coffee and just talk. 

6. Sex. So I haven't had sex with all the women I've dated nor have I expected to either but when I have the sex is amazing with trans women we go hours and orgasm multiple times and they them more sexual and more horny than cis women who go like 20 mins and are done for a few days. . . . 

These are just my honest observations I know every person is different and can't fix people into boxes but as a whole I'd say dating trans women is the best relationship decision I've ever made and I hope I find a trans women that I can actually mesh with so well she becomes my wife someday. 

Any straight men out there that want to date trans women but are scared for one reason or another don't be you will be shocked at how much better they are than cis women. The social stigma is almost none existent too I thought at first people with gawk and stare at us when we were out but honestly that rarely happens, and when it does I just stare back her. Ask them politely what their problem is and they stop. 

And trans women thank you for being so open to dating regular guys I mean I'm 6' 180lbs I'm a supervisor and divorced 36 years old moderately handsome and cis women would just think of me as not worthy to grace their presence lol but trans women actually give me a chance and I have had such a wonderful time and really felt valued and respected as a man and i believe more straight men will start dating trans women as the quality of people are a lot of the times higher in that community. Not to knock all cis women though either again just my 2 cents. ",0,1754574137.0,ask_transgender,2,0.35,False

Hi there thanks for reading my post this is a very long post please read it in full before messaging me. 

I am posting many times because I really am very serious about finding someone! I have been on my own way too long now I do not mind where you are located 

This is a genuine post from a genuine user I really want to find someone 

If you are going to be rude or critical please just move on to someone else I’m really not interested I don’t know why some have to be so rude on here I have had some that get really rude and nasty in the replies i have received so far there really is no Need for it 

I am an English guy and I am currently living in France I have been here a few years now I absolutely love it but I’m now wanting to find someone to share my life with. I am very family orientated and family is extremely important to me 

I am seeking a serious relationship I know what I want in life. I have no baggage I’ve never been married before and no previous relationships in fact I’ve never really dated and I’ve never been on dating apps. 

I just haven't found a woman that is suitable enough for me yet to want to be in a relationship with 

I’d like to find a woman with similar morals and values and boundaries. I really want to be with someone that really appreciates the way I am I am seeking a nice woman with nice standards like mine. You’ll find out a lot about me on this post. And please have maturity and decency many thanks. 

I’m generally quite a shy guy face to face so this has made it hard meeting others especially women. I am not one of the lads and I also don’t have many friends I prefer quality over quantity when it comes to friends. I am a very polite patient guy. 

I also don’t like swearing I rarely use vulgar language on online chats or face to face  I am not that type of guy. I also don’t like those that think it’s okay to criticise others this is especially true with being friends. I am probably a bit posh and I would describe myself as being upper middle class.  

I am not one that is into partying I don’t like loud noisy environments I prefer quieter things. I am not one of the lads I have very few male friends. I’m not into bars or nightclubs they really are not my thing. I really like going  to nice restaurants museums a nice beach walking through a park 

I really want to have my own family one day so please be someone that is open to having children in the future I really do want to be a father in the future. I believe I’m very fertile 

I have been totally celibate by choice all my life I only want to be with one woman and share my body with one woman. It has never appealed to me to be with different women and I could never do anything meaningless This has also never appealed to me. I’ve never been tempted by anyone and I’d never just sleep with someone for the sake of it. I don’t view women as one thing and I never will 

I need a strong emotional connection with someone plus I’d have to get to know someone really well ideally friends first 

It really does not appeal to me to even date different women I’ve never been on loads of dates I’m not interested in meeting different women I just want to be with one that’s it just one. 

I do not watch online adult content I don’t want to use the actual word for it and I don’t smoke I don’t drink heavily and I’ve never touched any illegal drugs. I’ve got no bad addictions or bad habits I’ve lived a very clean life. 

I’m not seeking adult chats on Reddit so if you are looking for this please move on I am not that type of guy. 

I take good care of myself I regularly go to the gym and workout often doing intense cardio workouts I’m in very good health. I am a very strong swimmer I’ve always loved swimming doing lengths my favourite stroke is freestyle this is also my strongest I’d love to have someone that loves swimming and keeping active as much as I do. I also love going on long walks I do a lot of brisk walking  often around the coastline here 

I do love my food and I have been raised on home cooked food I love cooking I’m not bad at it and I’d again love to be with someone that also loves her food as much as I do. 

I love eating in nice restaurants too I’ve always been very passionate about this! I also love avocados they are so good for you 

I place a very high value on being intimate with someone it’s not something I just want to do with just anyone and I don’t just want to settle I’ve never just wanted to settle I’m seeking the love of my life someone really special someone I really want to be with. You would be the only woman I would want to come home to at the end of the day. I’d never have an affair or a fling and I’m not into ever having an open relationship. I could never cheat on someone I loved and cared about 

I am also someone that sound be very loving supportive kind sweet and caring to you. I will also be very physically affectionate kissing cuddling. 

Where I am in France is very close to the sea it’s an absolutely beautiful place to live France is a Beautiful country. The coastline in this area is beautiful there are some lovely beaches I’ve been to and we have the lovely île de re island nearby I have been there many times it’s also beautiful. 

France is a very peaceful relaxing calm country it’s certainly more peaceful than England. England was too much pressure for me way too stressful too I always wanted to go somewhere else from a very early age. France has amazing food a fantastic healthcare system nice weather in the summer and the winters are not that cold certainly not as cold as England was 

I also love yoga and Pilates both of these I find extremely relaxing they are so good for the body it’s amazing how good it makes you feel after 

I also love photography taking photos is another passion of mine I can easily go out all day and come back with loads of photos to share. I love technology too especially Apple I’m very passionate about it. I have a lot of technology that I use and I do have an iPhone 

I also love music I listen to a lot of classical music during the day at home and I am usually listening to classic FM UK which is classical music 24/7 for those that don’t know. I also love soft rock some of the bands  love are a-ha Keane Queen dire straits I listen to a lot of 70s and 80s music. I’ve seen most of my favourite bands live too I’ve been very lucky with that. 

I also love animals I have a dog she’s a two year old retriever these are the best dogs for me she’s absolutely lovely. I love being with nature too I love taking walks through forests and the countryside I find this very peaceful and relaxing thing to do. I love spending a while day doing this and going for some nice food after 

When it comes to drinks I love red wine it’s my favourite but I only have it in moderation I’ve had some lovely bottles of red wine here in France and some of it is also organic. They make a lot of organic food here in France I organic where ever possible as often as possible. 

I keep junk and fast foods to a minimum and have these as a treat I don’t drink tea and coffee that much I avoid caffeine and I don’t drink sugary drinks that often either. I am not vegan or vegetarian and I can’t ever see myself going either way.  

It’s very important to keep hydrated and I only drink mineral water at least 3L per day and will have more if I go to the gym and have a good workout I always make sure I get myself really sweaty when working out I feel so good after. 

I have to be honest and tell you that I don’t drive I have never passed my test having a car is way too expensive and i have never been that interested in driving. 

I also still live at home with my parents at the moment I’m not someone that likes living by myself plus the current cost of living especially in England made living by myself too expensive. 

I will also tell you that I am taking a break from work I am in a new country learning the language is my focus at the moment.
I’m not lazy or anything like that and I cannot cope with stress and pressure in jobs this is again why I’ve had trouble finding suitable work which was hard In England 

So onto to my physical appearance well I am 6ft 4 1.94m very tall and I have a rugby player build you would never lose me in a crowd! I have dark blonde hair and hazel eyes I have freckles on my arms and legs. I have very big hands and feet I am a uk size 13 shoe. 

I have a very natural body type with some stretch Marks in some places like I say I love being natural and my body is very natural. 

My body Is not lean muscular athletic I am natural I have a real man's body which has some fat on it. 

We have very strong genes in my family and we all look younger I don't look My age most say I look like I'm in my late 20s to early 30s. I have no grey hair and I'm not losing any of my hair. I have a full head of nice hair 

I’m not into being ripped and toned having a six pack has never appealed to me. If your seeking men that are a muscular physique then I won’t be for you please move on. 

I have a very deep manly voice which can be loud sometimes. I like to voice chat too rather than messaging so if you are comfortable with this I would prefer it. 

I have a naturally smooth chest arms and legs. I don’t fit in most baths and I have to sleep in a double bed. I love the fact that I’m very tall but it does have its cons I often get asked when I’m in shops to reach things on the top shelf! Plus I walk around the house bare foot and I’m always bashing my feet on things hehe 

I am not addicted to social media and I don’t aspire to look like men on it or those in mainstream films and reality tv shows. I am not politically liberal either. Id like to be with someone that is not obsessed with social media and you don’t watch reality tv. I don’t watch any reality tv at all. 

I have no tattoos no piercings and looking and keeping yourself natural is the best way to go I am a very natural looking man and body to go with it. this is what I believe and it’s how I’ve been raised too. I have no interest in ever having tattoos or piercings of any kind. I’d never have any cosmetic surgery 

I like natural looking women that have natural bodies and that don’t wear heavy makeup also no fake tan or fake nails or fake eyelashes and hair. I also like women that dress modestly and conservatively. I’d prefer someone with no tattoos and not too many piercings please. Also you don’t wear a bikini on the beach that is too skimpy. 

So if you like what you have read then please send me a message and mention red wine in your message! Please can you tell me what you love about being a woman in your message and your age and location and more about you please don’t just say hi or hello I’m unlikely to respond to messages with low effort!

1mk0dyc,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1mk0dyc/the_old_ways_signed_in_blood/,The old ways - signed in blood,"As the only daughter of the Clarke clan, I have been coaxed from a young age to marry a rich man. From preschool I have been pressured to be neat and to learn to cook well in order to be a good wife. 

My family imprinted on me that the most important day of my life is that of my wedding day. My mother always plucked a hair from my head on valentine's day and wrapped it around my ring finger. She swore that it was a good luck charm. This magical hair would draw a suitable partner to me and quickly at that. This was an extremely strange and uncomfortable thought for a little girl. I shrugged it off as yet another crazy superstition. 

This year I turned eighteen and she still insists on carrying on the tradition. When she wasn't looking, I tossed it into the trash. I don't believe in the ‘bad luck’ this act would cause. My future career prospects were more pressing on my mind.

I'm sure you've heard of the superstition that it's bad luck for a groom to see their bride before the ceremony on their wedding day. Especially bad luck to not have something old, something new, something borrowed or something blue. Even worse luck if it should rain on your big day.

The more logical people that I’ve met overlook such silly notions. Adults always make a huge fuss about matrimony. A tradition millennia old and ever present. A legal bonding of two people which changes nothing tangible at all. An excuse for a massive party. The planning, the stress, the tears, all for one day. The one day where you and your beloved stand at the altar in your white dress and black tuxedo. 

When the world shifts on its axis for the happy couple.

Soon my world would shift on its axis.

Unfortunately, not for any good reason - but from pure evil.

I would learn that superstitions, traditions and culture are immensely important to the Wilson clan. To an absolute fault. I would learn that the vow, “Until Death Do us part”, would forever send shivers down my spine. The madness that is about to ensue was catalysed by an invitation to my dear uncle’s wedding and the only proof of this subreddit. The madness being a perfect illustration of the detriments of the old ways.

Ways I had forgotten about until tonight.

**\*\*\*\*\***

Mom clumsily connected our old family laptop to the power outlet. The battery was so old and banged up that it needed to remain plugged in at all times to function. With the click of the power button, the machine heaved to life. 

*Poor thing.*

It was covered with scratches and dents. Plastered with glittery stickers from my Hello Kitty phase. I swear I could hear the ancient inner mechanics struggling and gasping with every passing moment.

With some assistance from my dad, we got our Zoom call up and running. The sunburnt face of my uncle Rodney took up the screen. The quaint dining area of his farmhouse looked like a super realistic green screen backdrop.

“Hi Uncle Rodney!” I chirped. 

I squeezed myself into the frame, pressing against my mother's arm.

“Hi Sugarplum!” He beamed back at me. He still treated me like his little niece.

His eyes wrinkled at the corners as he shot me the most sincere, heart-warming smile I'd ever seen on his face. A woman walked into frame.

She pulled up a dining chair next to him and held Uncle Rodney's hand.

“Everyone, meet Martha! Martha, meet everyone!” Rodney exuberantly introduced her to us. 

She smiled shyly back at us, waving weakly at the camera. Her long blonde hair pooled at her waist in waves like the locks of a mermaid. She had aquamarine-coloured eyes to match the watery aesthetic. They sparkled at us through the tiny screen - wild and lovely. 

I could imagine her perched on a rock out at sea, hair bellowing in the wind. Green strips of seaweed stuck in her hair, imitating bold highlights. A long scaly tail and beautifully decorated clamshell bodice. 

She was an absolute siren. 

*What on Earth was she doing with Uncle Rodney?*

“What the hell is a woman like you doing with a fool like my brother?” Yelled my father. Candidly speaking what was on our minds.

“Bill!” My mother gasped. She smacked his shoulder a little harder than my dad expected.

I could feel myself turning ruby red with embarrassment. 

Dad massaged his aching shoulder in silence.

“Don't mind my husband, dear. He lacks even the slightest bit of etiquette. His mother and I sometimes joke that he was raised by wolves.”

My mother always had a way to smooth things over. She was the queen of smoothing things over and sweeping other things under the rug. 

*Far* too well.

“Well, we don't want to take up too much of your time. We wanted to make a quick call to say hi and…” Uncle Rodney looked expectantly at Martha.

“Um…We're engaged!” she gleamed.

Suddenly the cracking sound of thunder spilled out of the laptop's speakers.

The screen went dark on their side.

“The power's cut out! Darn storm fried the circuit. I'm sorry about this guys…we'll keep you updated! And just…be happy for us, would ya?”

“We will, Uncle Rodney!” I yelled at the screen. 

“Love you guys!” he yelled back. 

“Byeee!” We sang out.

Then there was nothing but the melodic tone of the video call ending.

\*\*\*\*\*

The next week we received a blue envelope in the mail. I anxiously ripped it from our monstrosity of a mailbox. Dad had fashioned various animal skulls onto a wooden beam, totem pole style. 

My family is a strange bunch. My mother is a reiki healer (heals through your energy field and stuff - I know) and does part-time grocery deliveries, my dad is a mixed media artist creating all kinds of grotesqueries (coffee tables with Crash dummy limbs for legs or lamps adorned with shark teeth). 

Uncle Rodney is the groundskeeper at Elm Wood cemetery. He always seemed a bit too comfortable around death. Growing up I would get made fun for my eccentric family but it was nice that things never got boring in this family. Little did I know how true that statement would prove to be.

The blue envelope had a silver card inside embellished with white lace trim. It was an invitation to attend his wedding in Elm wood. In just a month's time. 

*Gosh, he barely knows this chick and now he's marrying her in four weeks!*

My head swirled with the absurdity of it all. At least they seem very much in love. Mom and dad seemed happy for them, with the right amount of weariness.

I thought of the venue handwritten on the shimmering invitation. The old church on Ringwood Road. The last time I was there was for pop-pop’s funeral.

My parents grew up in that small town of Elm Wood. We have very fond memories of visiting it from time to time. Summers spent at lake Agnes, winters huddled in log cabins watching shooting stars against the darkest skies, community potlucks filled with laughter. Just your typical close-knit rural town.

I smiled to myself, clutching the blue envelope to my chest. 

*It'd be really nice to visit again.* 

I paused my nostalgic thought as I felt the discomfort of something, not at all made of paper, pressing against my chest. I fished around the envelope's insides and grabbed a thumb-sized rectangle. It was tightly wrapped with what seemed like animal hair. I curiously removed the strands to reveal a small wooden tile.

A bizarre rune was burned into its surface.

**\*\*\*\*\***

Dad had been singing nonstop since we left home, approximately two hours and 17 minutes. Another one of his strange quirks was that he did not listen to the radio on road trips. He believed we should “be in the moment!” and “bond through song!”. He forced me to put my phone on airplane mode and to chuck my earphones into the boot. From time to time I'd check if my ears were bleeding from the sheer racket he called singing. 

“You might as well have thrown in a ball and chain since we *torture* in this family!” I yelled, furious at the circumstances.

We seemed to be driving along this winding road for eternity. The skies had grown overcast and full as we headed to a higher altitude. The palm trees of home morphed into giant evergreens that whooshed past in blurs of autumnal hues.

Then we passed a little sign, the only thing protruding from the ground besides the surrounding flora.

A sign reading “Welcome to Elm Wood: Population 333 666”. 

*What an odd number,* I thought.

It too whooshed past in a yellowy blur.

I rolled down the window excitedly.

We rolled onto the main road that split the city's economic hub into two. Redbrick stores and restaurants flanked either side of us accented by endless rows of string lights overhead. An old man swept Auburn leaves from the pavement outside his barbershop. 

His 1950s style outfit and handlebar moustache made it feel like we'd stepped through a time portal. He tipped his bowler hat warmly at us as we cruised by, then continued sweeping. The streets were so clean, the town so quaint and picturesque.

“Wow!” My mother exclaimed. “They've really polished the place up nicely! Oh, imagine what the cabin will look like!”

My parents had no living family left in Elm Wood aside from Uncle Rodney and some estranged cousin in an old age home. They booked a cabin not far from the town centre for the next two weeks. They decided to turn the wedding visit into a full on vacation. I fully supported their idea.

After about 20 minutes we pulled into a clearing in the woods. A charming log cabin stood before us, a creek rushed past its left. An inviting swing set sat to its right.

Dad was still fiddling with the front door, clearly struggling to get it open.

I hopped to my feet and inhaled the surrounding woody scent deeply. 

I exhaled happily, “Feels like home, doesn't it?”

**\*\*\*\*\***

Mother was smearing blood red lipstick on her lips in the bathroom mirror when dad's phone rang. 

“Hey Bill!” Uncle Rodney blared through the phone.

“Hey, Rod! How's it hangin’?” Dad replied. He was currently fighting with the tie mom got him for the rehearsal dinner. Dad never usually wore anything dressier than closed shoes. 

“Listen, I have some bad news. Martha's come down with something awful. She seemed okay this mornin’ but things took a turn for the worse. We're on our way to Mount Manson Hospital over in Lawson”

“You don't say? That's awful, Rod. Should we come through?”

“No, it's 30 miles out. I'll keep you all updated and I'm sorry about all the fuss with rehearsal dinner and everything, but we'll have to push out the whole lot.”

“Okay, Rod. Don't worry about anything, just focus on Martha right now.”

“Can’t stop worryin’ I'm afraid.”

“You're in our thoughts, Chief. Keep us posted.”

“Betcha.”

*Click*.

Mom stood in the doorway, halfway through a French bun hairdo. 

“What was that sweetie?” She mumbled with a Bobby pin gripped between her teeth.

“Martha's going to hospital, dinner's off,” he stated. Totally uninterested and already scrolling through a food delivery app.

“Pizza?”

\*\*\*\*\*

Uncle Rodney was still at the hospital when I decided to stop by his work. My parents had no qualms getting me out of their hair for a few hours and I’d grown tired of their antics all the same.

I know it's super weird but I actually really enjoy visiting the cemetery. I spent quite a few afternoons hanging out with Uncle Rodney here when I was little. 

It felt homely and sweetly nostalgic.

The wrought iron arch stood proud over the entrance. Tiny grey stones created paths that converged at a central bubbling fountain. This place always seemed like a little city in itself. The scattered family mausoleums looked like houses in an opulent neighborhood. The stone pathways, roads connecting the homes. 

The grass surrounding the graves was lush, green and perfectly manicured. Well kept wooden benches were thoughtfully placed every few feet. Little brass signs were riveted to them, representing the person or family the bench was donated in honour of.

My favourite place was the little chapel on the far end. The grass sloped off to an embankment, a wider part of the creek. A curved concrete bench stood overlooking the rushing waters. I'd often sit there and make little arrangements from the flowers that bloomed randomly between the graves or sometimes from bouquets left on headstones that were beginning to wilt.

I checked for the grave of Storm Lewis (D.O.B 2015 - D.O.D 2021). When I was a bit younger I remembered looking forward to seeing her grave. A rather morbid thought, I know, but she had a very caring mother who tended to her grave. 

With every passing holiday she'd clean it up and decorate it for her little girl. Last Halloween she carved orange & white pumpkins and placed them around the grave. She placed little bat decorations on the headstone and a plastic cauldron in front of it with dry ice. 

The previous December she stuck artificial candy canes into the soil, wrapped the headstone in tinsel & blinking fairy lights and placed a reindeer plushie next to the grave.

This particular visit a white, orange and red floral arrangement sat in front of the headstone. A garland displaying bright paper turkeys adorned the headstone itself. I smiled to myself and touched the headstone. Fairly apt for the first week of November. 

*I really hope she can see what her mom does for her.*

I turned my attention to the chapel again and flinched.

It looked like a woman was sitting there already. She hadn't been there a moment ago. Her blond locks swayed gently in the breeze. I back stepped, wondering if I should turn and run. Then in a split second, the woman was gone. 

Goosebumps appeared all over my shaking body.

*What was that?*

*I must have been seeing things.*

Uncle Rodney did tell me about *things.* The legends that he'd heard and the personal experiences he had working as the resident caretaker. All the typical ghost stories: A floating woman in white, a black shadow dog, a scratching sound seemingly coming from inside the newly buried coffins. All of which seemed to revolve around *night time*, though. He never mentioned an apparition of a blonde lady. And she looked so *normal,* so *real*.

A deep sense of dread twisted my stomach into knots.

*Why did this seem so important?*

**\*\*\*\*\***

The melodic ringtone of dad's phone cut through the silence of the night. It sounded like it could be in the room with me.

Our cabin was set up so their bedroom was cozied into the back left of the building and my room (a spare bedroom with a fold-out couch) was sat tightly on their right side. Though the exterior facing walls were constructed from thick ancient logs, the inner walls were paper thin modern drywall.

I blinked the sleep from my eyes and pressed my ear to the connecting wall.

I could hear the flick of a bedside lamp.

“God Rodney, it's the middle of the night,” Dad mumbled. His voice was thick and groggy. 

A gut wrenching wail erupted from his phone's receiver.

The sound seemed to seep through the connecting wall, coating my room in absolute dread.

I didn't need to hear anything else. 

I knew at that moment that Martha had passed away.

\*\*\*\*\*

The service was brief and beautiful. A handful of Martha's family attended the church and stayed for the burial. They were from out of town and needed to leave just as soon as they'd arrived.

Uncle Rodney went above and beyond with the gravesite of his beloved, planting tree saplings and flowers in delicate patterns around the grave. A freestanding wrought iron bird feeder stood next to her headstone. Apparently she'd been an avid lover of birds. 

It was extremely touching.

The day passed at superhuman speed. It finally felt like things were settling when we were gathered around the cramped dinner table at Uncle Rodney's. We ate straight from our Chinese takeout boxes. I didn't dare open my fortune cookie. It seemed…*inappropriate*. 

Spirits were oddly high around the table. Mom made light banter and Uncle Rodney even managed to crack a smile. I furrowed my brow as I chewed my dinner. 

*Was I the only one in mourning here?*

After a roar of laughter in response to a dirty joke, my dad inquired with Uncle Rodney, “So should I arrive at the church around 7 to help set up or what's the deal?”

My jaw dropped, chopsticks halfway to my mouth. My father has a pretty messed up sense of humour but this was going way too far. I looked to my mother, preparing for the verbal berating she was without a doubt about to unleash upon my father. 

But nothing. 

She merely added that she would do her best to get me out of bed on time the morning of the ceremony.

I couldn't believe my ears.

“This is a sick joke, guys,” I blurted. I pushed away my takeout. My appetite had been completely ruined.

“What are you on about, dear?” Asked Mom. No sign of remorse for her disrespect or any inclination of acting.

She was serious.

My head spun.

My eyes flicked to the other two adults seated around the table.

Each one’s face as deadpan as Mom's.

“I….need to go to bed,” muttered to myself. I nearly stumbled as my spiraling thoughts turned into literal vertigo.

“It's only 7PM?” My mother asked, worry clear in her voice.

“I can't be around you all right now!”

I clambered down the hall, vision fuzzy like it was whenever I had a high fever.

I collapsed onto my bed and let the darkness of my room swaddle me to sleep.

\*\*\*\*\*

*My eyes shot open at the sound of church bells ringing. I sat on an oak pew close to the pulpit. A giant stained glass window stretched out behind the priest and a dapper-looking Uncle Rodney. The early morning light poured through the stained glass, covering the congregation in a kaleidoscope of colour.*

*The priest clad in cream and gold vestments called upon the congregation to stand. A distant organ began to play a wedding march. We turned eagerly, peering down the aisle to catch the first glimpse of the bride.*

*The bride made her way down the red carpeted aisle, arms hooked with her proud father. She wore an elegant white satin gown with a skirt that jutted out all around her like a princess in a fairy tale. Her face was covered by a thick tulle veil, bordered with an intricate lace. The pair slowly made their way to the pulpit in time with the music.*

*Her father placed the bride’s gloved hand on Uncle Rodney's - symbolically giving her away into his care. The couple turned to each other, she curtseyed in front of Uncle Rodney and he lifted the veil off her face.*

*My breath caught in my throat.*

*That was no blushing bride.* 

*A greyed face looked out from under the veil. Her eyes were empty sockets, somehow still able to see her groom's face. Flaps of skin hung loosely from her decaying skull. The remaining ligaments and muscles contorted into a perverse imitation of a smile. Unmistakable Golden locks framed her ghoulish face and bounced as she recited her vows.* 

*I began to hyperventilate, looking around the church for any confirmation of what I was seeing. I only saw happy tearful faces, watching the ceremony unfold.*

*I turned back to watch the unholy union that was taking place at the chapel. My eyes met the empty sockets of the bride inches from my face. The holes where her eyes had been were overflowing with fatten maggots.*

*I screamed, clutching my hands to my face protectively.*

My eyes snapped open to the varnished knotty pine ceiling above my bed.

I glanced around me.

No church. No corpse bride. Just my room in the cabin.

The next 24 hours were a blur. I stayed in my room, staring out of the window. My parents would knock at my door and leave food for me on a tray. I refused to reply to them or eat. 

I sat curled into a ball on my bed, staring at the pale blue bridesmaid dress that hung off my wardrobe’s handle. The wedding was set to take place tomorrow. 

*How could they pretend this was okay?* 

*What would I see?* 

*Who or what would Uncle Rodney marry?*

My stomach twisted into knots at the thought.

A knock came at the door again. 

“Kayla, I'm coming in,” Mom called and pushed the door open.

I hid under my blanket, pretending I was asleep. Evidently I was not doing a good job.

The coils in my mattress squeaked as she sat next to me. She put her hand on my covered body and began to stroke my arm.

“I didn't think the time would come so soon, Buttercup, but I think it's time that I tell you about the old ways.”

**\*\*\*\*\***

“Back in your gram-gram’s time people didn't live a very long time. When a couple were to be wed it was such an incredible and special thing. It meant so much more than it does in modern times. 

Sometimes it was strategic and people were arranged to be married for financial or political gain. Or, sometimes, possibly a peasant girl was lucky enough to snatch a wealthy tradesman's heart. Prenuptial contracts took on a whole other life in those days…

Anyway, If you married into the right family it could mean the end of poverty for you. It could mean generational wealth: Not having to worry if your family would have to worry for food or shelter ever again, same for your kids, their kids and so on. 

So as I said, unions were extremely important. So important that if things went wrong, say the groom or bride passed away, the marriage would still need to take place. Remember the contracts I told you about? 

Sealed in blood, I'm afraid. 

Absolute. 

And these traditions…haven't left parts of the country”

I threw my blanket off in a huff.

“So what does that mean? Uncle Rodney’s supposed to marry a bag of bones tomorrow?”

“Well, no, he will be marrying Martha's spirit. The two of them were fully aware of this scenario should it arise.”

“And that thing in the invitation? The symbols?” I could hear my voice quivering as I spoke.

“This phenomenon is called a ghost marriage, sweetie. That rune is there to ward off…*other* spirits…that may *interfere*. Now, with the ceremony happening tomorrow I need you to follow my instructions.”

I just stared wide-eyed at my mother.

I scanned the room, looking for any sign of absurdities like pink elephants or fairies.

I was desperately looking for proof of my psychotic break.

“When dealing with the dead like this we need to be extremely careful. There are do’s and don'ts. Are you listening, Kayla?”

I looked at my mother incredulously.

Mouth still agape.

I managed a nod.

“Good. Things could get a bit hairy over the next few weeks if you don't do as I say. Listen carefully:

* After the ceremony you need to pour salt across the threshold to your room. 

* You need to lock and unlock your door three times before you go to bed and don't open it until morning, no matter who you think is asking you to.

* Keep the curtains shut after sundown.

Okay? Now say it back to me.”

I sighed and repeated a summarised version of her crazy rules.

“That should do it. And be kind to Uncle Rodney. This isn't an easy thing for him to do.”

**\*\*\*\*\***

The ceremony time had been moved to 6PM by my mother, apparently this was an auspicious number. 

This trip really brought the quack out of my family. 

We met in a round clearing further East. Uncle Rodney was waiting for us. He wore all linen, organic and beige. His shoulder length hair was slicked back from his face. His feet were bare and covered in the mulch of the forest. He held an A4 photograph of Martha tight against his chest.

My mother would be the officiant today.

My father and I stood awkwardly as mom wrapped a long strip of brown leather around Uncle Rodney’s wrists then around the photograph of Martha. She bound them together tightly with multiple knots.

She recited a strange shortened version of vows that she had Uncle Rodney repeat back to her. After no more than five minutes she pronounced the ghost couple husband and wife. A breeze kicked up a pile of dead leaves, causing them to crackle across the forest floor. The Earth's energy shifted. I could see tears beginning to form at the corners of Uncle Rodney’s eyes. 

My heart ached for him. 

I ran up to him, squeezing my arms around him tightly.

With the makeshift ceremony complete, we headed back to his house for a small ‘celebratory’ dinner. We decided to spend the night there to give him some comfort in company. Mom planned a buffet breakfast for the following morning. 

I was given the worn loveseat to sleep on in the lounge. The house was open plan, meaning the kitchen lounge and dining area were all practically squished into one room. The lounge opened onto the back porch via a glass sliding door. The back porch overlooked a wide expanse of forest.

Mom sprinkled salt around the couch since I wasn't in my room and told me to lock the sliding door like she asked. She duct taped a tablecloth to the sliding door as a makeshift curtain. She nodded as she confirmed that all the rules had been followed. 

“Now sleep tight, sweetie. I love you”, she cooed and kissed me on the forehead. *I wonder at what age she’ll stop doing that.*

“I love you too,” I responded and curled up on the springy mattress.

My eyelids drifted shut in the dark comfort of the room. Sleep came to me quickly that night.

A bluish hue shone behind my shut eyelids. I yawned, opening my eyes, fully expecting it to be morning already. 

Moonlight.

Moonlight had flooded the room with a fantastical blue. The off-brand tape holding up my makeshift curtain had come loose, causing the right corner of the table cloth to hang untidily against the sliding door. I could see the moon and trees clearly through the glass.

I rose to my feet and groggily made my way to the sliding door. I shuffled my feet thoughtlessly cutting a path through the grainy salt circle around my temporary bed. As I raised the tablecloth to stick back in place, movement in the woods caught my eye. Aside from the moonlit ground I could barely make out anything in the black treeline. I squinted, forcing my eyes to find the source of the movement.

That's when I saw it.

Or her.

A figure.

Standing still as a statue amongst the trees.

A faint voice called to me through the departing glass.

“*Kayla…*”

I slammed my hand against the part of the wall where I knew a light switch existed. It flicked on, bathing the room in a cool white. I looked back out the sliding door.

The figure was gone.

**\*\*\*\*\***

I managed to fall asleep after my midnight jump scare. In the morning I woke to the smell of bacon and flapjacks. Mom was hard at work lining the entire kitchen counter with various breakfast foods. I grabbed a crispy strip of bacon and chomped off the end. 

“How'd you sleep, honey?” She asked in a sing-songy voice.

“Not well, actually…” I trailed off.

She turned from the fruit bowl she was arranging. Her face was instantly concerned.

“What happened?”

“Nothing really. I just…the tablecloth came off in the night. I think I saw something outside when I went to put it back.”

Mom digested this information carefully then grabbed the salt pig off the counter.

“Grab a handful of this,” she commanded.

After last night, I would not question anything she asked of me again.

I took a scoop of salt from the ceramic holder and waited for her next words.

“Good, now throw it over your left shoulder. Look straight forward.”

I did as she asked. Feeling incredibly silly.

“Now spit over your right shoulder.”

I frowned. 

*Gross*.

I obliged. This was the most disgusting thing I'd done since wetting the bed as a toddler.

“That-a-girl. Now help me lay the table.”

Oddities seem to be our new family norm.

\*\*\*\*\*

Things seemed to calm after this. We headed home shortly after. Back home to palm trees, golden beaches and people in shorts & flip-flops. 

I still had a month until college orientation. I spent most of the day at home with dad while he worked on his projects in the garage. I took the opportunity to get a head start on my literature reading list.

My favourite place to read was on a beanbag in the TV room. I tucked my feet beneath me and turned to the second chapter of ‘Pride and Prejudice’. I slipped into the world of the book in my hands, happily allowing the minutes to pass when I began to hear an annoying creaking. The weather was fair with not so much as a breeze. Perhaps that tropical storm was coming sooner than reported. Or maybe dad was using some strange machinery again.

The creaking faded into the background as I immersed myself into the book once again.

“Kayla?”

“Yes”, I responded automatically and flipped to the next page.

“Kayla?” 

“Yes? I'm in the TV room!” I yelled over my book.

*What did mom want?*

My stomach dropped.

*Mom?*

*Mom wasn't home. She had appointments in town today. She wouldn't be back ‘til dinner time.* 

*But it sounded like she was down the hall.*

I shook my head. I must be hearing things. I snuggled into my beanbag and continued reading.

“KAYLA!” The voice yelled loudly now, directly into my ear. 

I shot up, dropping my book.

I sprinted straight out of the house and into the garage. Checking over my shoulder for anyone following me. Dad had a welding helmet on and earplugs in. He seemed to be in the middle of fashioning a metal sculpture of…a pineapple?

I whacked him against the head to get his attention. 

“DAD THERE'S SOMEONE IN THE HOUSE!” 

**\*\*\*\*\***

He threw off his protective gear immediately and grabbed the wooden baseball bat he'd recently decorated with thrift store dentures. 

I moved behind him as he made his way into the house, gripping the back of his hoodie. 

“COME ON OUT HERE!” He yelled, ready to confront whoever had invaded our home.

We stood in the entryway as we awaited an answer.

“COME OUT! I HAVE A WEAPON AND I'M NOT AFRAID TO USE IT!” He yelled into the emptiness of the house.

SLAM!

The front door slammed shut behind us.

I ran to the door handle, rattling it wildly. It wouldn't budge. We were locked in.

“If you don't get out of here I swear I'm going to call the police!” Dad gripped the baseball bat to the point that his knuckles were completely white and devoid of blood flow.

Our tropical climate suddenly ceased to exist, replaced by a frigid arctic cold. I wrapped my free arm around myself in a weak attempt to keep my body temperature up. Dad finally plucked up the courage to step further into the house. 

He peaked around every corner, still ready to swing at any potential threat. I knew deep down that whatever threat was in our home, would not be overcome by brute force. This was something else. The energy of it seemed to float upward from the floorboards, like fresh rain evaporating off hot tarmac. I could almost see its ghostly gaseous form dancing in the ether.

A click and whoosh of gas being ignited could be heard through the adjacent wall. The sound originated from the garage. I could recognize that sound anywhere. 

Dad's propane torch. 

Dad gasped, muttering to himself that he absolutely positively switched it off and that there would be no way to ignite it unless the intruder was outside. Then we heard the low roar of flames carpeting the garage floor.

We split up, frantically rattling windows, turning all door handles leading to the outside world. All to no avail. Dad grabbed his phone and tried emergency services. Impossibly, there was no service. 

A distinct smoky smell hit my nostrils, urging me to try harder in our attempts at freedom. Freedom? The basement window. The only unbarred window in the house, just slim enough for a child to slither through and call for help. Without a second thought I ran down the rickety wooden staircase to the sublevel two steps at a time. 

The grime covered window stared back at me in the far corner of the room, conveniently located above a wooden writing desk. I grabbed the closest heavy object I could find (a heavy duty clothing iron) and heaved it through the window. It crashed through the glass and landed with a hollow thump on the lawn beyond. I grabbed a nearby dust cloth and wrapped it around my fist and forearm. 

Now protected, I smashed the remaining fragments of glass out of the opening and clawed onto the green grass beyond. Black smoke now streamed from the garage and portions of the house. I attempted to unlock the front door from the outside but shot back as the metal door handle burned the sensitive skin of my palm. The fire had spread to the interior of the house already.

I began to scream. Urging anyone who could hear to assist and call the emergency services. A neighbour three houses down curiously peaked out their front drapes towards the source of the commotion. I could see his expression change from interest to pure horror in a split second. I saw him raise his cell phone to his ear as he stared awestruck at our house. 

Orange and red flaming tendrils crashed through the front windows revealing a smoke-filled dining room. Finally people began to gather, hauling hosepipes from their yards and buckets of water to the scene. My vision blurred with salty tears. 

Through my watery field of vision I could make out the shape of Dad laying collapsed in a heap on the wooden floor. There, standing next to him was a feminine figure, veiled and enrobed in white. 

**\*\*\*\*\***

Dad hadn't suffered more than smoke inhalation and some trauma from the entire affair. The damage was quite severe to our rental home though. The landlord had decent insurance that would cover the repairs but he politely asked us to pack our things and never come back.

Uncle Rodney had moved up here recently to be closer to us, among other reasons. With the assistance of his upper middle-class in-laws he was able to fund his new business venture: Clarke Landscaping and Tree felling. A brilliantly located entrepreneurial gig in the heart of a tropical city. 

With kindness and understanding he let us stay at his condo until we could get back on our feet. Days turned into weeks, weeks turned into months. After a year of tightening the purse strings and careful saving, my parents were able to put down a deposit on a two bedroom house 5 minutes over. 

With this new home my mother cleansed the space in every way she could think of: hiring priests, mediums and freelance ‘Ghostbusters’. We laid down roots in this cleansed sanctuary. Years passed without incident. 

This winter my boyfriend, Keith, and I will have been together for 7 years. Yes, we had the usual ups and downs but these 7 years have been absolutely magical. With the end of his training at a prestigious law firm on the horizon, Keith popped the question on my birthday. Mom and dad were absolutely thrilled. “We're going to have an attorney in the family!” She boasted. 

*Nevermind her only daughter's accomplishments*. 

To celebrate, she invited us for a 3 course dinner tonight. She insisted we bring nothing but ourselves. The air smelled like Christmas when we walked through the front door. Crispy ham, cloves and honey. 

 

“Hey sweets! Sit at the table, gonna bring the food to the table now”, mom called from the kitchen. 

Dad was already seated at the head of the table. He carefully rose to his feet, hugged the two of us then threw himself back down onto his seat. His knees had been giving him serious problems lately. That’s what years of recreational baseball gets you. Dad beamed with joy through the pain. My parents were so overjoyed for us.

Uncle Rodney arrived a few moments later apologizing for his tardiness. He evidently had an emergency tree felling job. Keith and I took our seats at the table and chatted idly with my boisterous father and his over-boisterous brother. Mom brought out bowls of soup as our starters, placing them on the table settings in front of us. Bright red tomato soup with half a cheese toastie perched delicately across the rim of the ceramic bowl. I practically drooled at the sight. We spent the night eating merrily. My heart felt full surrounded by old and new family. 

Our dessert seemed to be served from a decorative silver cloche. Mom made her way from the kitchen and placed it in the centre of the table. She exchanged looks with dad and Uncle Rodney. I flicked my eyes to Keith, telepathically communicating my concern at this exchange. 

 

“Thank you, lovebirds, for joining us tonight! We’re ever so happy for you and can’t wait to welcome Keith into our fold!

Dad clapped enthusiastically. Uncle Rodney hiccupped in response, face flushed red from consuming one too many glasses of wine. 

“Keith, I’m not sure if my daughter has told you but we are a very traditional bunch,” Mom lifted the lid of the cloche with finesse, “So we’ve taken the liberty to start your marriage off on the right foot! Just like the old days!”

I gripped Keith’s hand.

Upon the platter lay a sheet of parchment inscribed with calligraphic writing ending with two dotted lines.

Keith frowned with confusion. 

*How blissful ignorance can be.*

I looked into his eyes, tears beginning to form at the corners of my own. The trauma still fresh in my mind.

1mk0b5q,https://www.reddit.com/r/popheads/comments/1mk0b5q/friday/,Friday,"This morning I’ve had a hard decision to make. I decided to listen again to the song “TGIF,” by Katy Perry, for nostalgia purposes. Upon reading the comments, I found out about a song called: “Friday,” by Rebecca Black, which apparently back in 2011, when the song was released, it received a large amount of hatred. So much so that the original video was deleted, and subsequently uploaded again at a slightly later date. 

The hard decision is to decide which I dislike more - “Friday,” or “Iced Coffee,” by JoJo Siwa. It’s hard. Listening to “Friday,” it is the most literal piece I have ever heard, a “true” lyrical intellectual, it hurts to know the people who wrote this were adults, with years of lyricism experience, and this is what classified as lyrical intellectualism at this point in time. Mind you, judging by today’s musical standards, I’m hardly surprised, but still. 

I was seven when this song was released, and today was my first time listening to it. I have always been intrigued by songs collectively receiving mass hatred, because I’m not a “follower” of such. I make my own mind up. Objectively, however, this song was about as vague as it gets.

 Allow me to recite some of the lyrics - “Gotta have my bowl, gotta have cereal,” “partyin,’ partyin,’ (yeah) partyin,’ partyin,’ (yeah) fun, fun, fun, fun,” “yesterday was Thursday, Thursday, today it is Friday, Friday, we so excited, we gonna have a ball today,” “tomorrow is Saturday, and Sunday comes afterwards.” 

Such poetry. I’m highly disappointed she didn’t integrate mentions of Monday. I remember at university we were asked to write poetry about the days of the week, this heavily would have sufficed, I’m sure. Between this and “like the way you’re grinding my bean,” from the song “Iced Coffee,” by JoJo Siwa, I genuinely worry for not only the music industry itself, but for the respect of the art of lyricism.

Real Connections or Red Flags?,"So I recently stumbled into a very random corner of the internet and ended up signing up on one of those inmate dating sites. I wasn’t exactly looking for love, but curiosity got the better of me. The idea that someone behind bars might want to connect with people on the outside felt kinda wild but also human in a weird way.

I ended up messaging this guy who was doing time for a non-violent drug offense. His profile was surprisingly thoughtful. He wrote poetry, talked about books he’d read inside, and even mentioned how he missed the smell of fresh coffee. We exchanged a few letters (yeah, real mail), and he was polite, funny, and honestly more grounded than some of the dudes I’ve met on Tinder. No weird pressure or love bombing, just actual conversations.

That said, I started to feel weird about it after a few weeks. I was worried I might be getting too emotionally involved with someone whose real life I didn’t fully understand. Plus, I had no idea how common scams are on those sites, or if people pretend to be someone else. I didn’t send money or anything, but I still got a bit anxious. Has anyone else gone down this rabbit hole? Do these sites ever lead to real relationships or is it mostly just bad news waiting to happen?

yesterday in a facebook group local to me, someone said they drink coffee multiple times a day and are looking to cut back on caffeine. they were asking for alternative drink recommendations. i said aside from decaf or half caf coffee, refreshers are delicious and have less caffeine than coffee, but still some. i immediately had several people responding to me, claiming refreshers have more caffeine than coffee. i was confused because i have very severe reactions to coffee and would definitely know if i was drinking something with an even higher caffeine content.


someone claiming to be a starbucks barista chimed in and says “it’s true, refreshers have more caffeine than coffee. i constantly have to tell parents not to order them for their children.”


i pointed out that the app says a grande coffee has around 165 mg of caffeine while a grande refresher has anywhere from 40-55 mg and speculated that maybe they’re thinking 8 oz of concentrate has more caffeine than 8 oz of coffee? but nobody orders undiluted refresher concentrate from what i’ve seen. i asked for a source for what they’re claiming. 


everyone i responded to doubled down, saying its true that refreshers are WAY more caffeinated than starbucks coffee (aka at least 3x the amount of caffeine advertised). the barista even went on to say their coffee is “at least half watered down” and that “higher ups” have told her that the caffeine content in refreshers is more than coffee. 


if this was true, wouldn’t there be some sort of lawsuit by now? wouldn’t at least one kid be hospitalized? my middle school aged nieces drink refreshers and have the same reaction they’d have from a can of soda. 


now i feel like i’m being gaslit LOL. can someone please help me make sense of this?! 


(of course this is just a silly thing that doesn’t matter in the grand scheme of things, i’m just puzzled and feel like an idiot for recommending a drink that allegedly is more caffeinated than coffee lol) ",6,1754573643.0,starbucks,6,0.88,False

This masticating juicer is not just another gadget cluttering up the counter; it's a powerhouse that makes you rethink the beauty of slow, methodical juicing. I went into this expecting great things, and I have to say, after daily usage, it doesn’t disappoint. That said, it's not all perfect, but I’ll dive into the highlights—and pitfalls—below.

**Design and Build Quality**  
The first thing that struck me about the juicer was its sleek, metallic silver finish with a design that feels premium and robust. Although weighing nearly 18 pounds, it’s not exactly portable, but the heft gives it a durable, well-constructed vibe. Its dimensions (6.5 inches deep, 10.6 inches wide, and 13.39 inches tall) fit snugly on my counter without overtaking valuable space. The polycarbonate components feel sturdy and give confidence in their longevity. It isn’t flashy by any means, but it has a functional elegance that prioritizes utility over gimmicks.

**Efficient Performance**  
Juicing with this machine happens at 80 revolutions per minute (RPM), which is deliberately slow by design. This dual-stage masticating process keeps the produce cold and retains nutrients far better than high-speed centrifugal juicers. Testing this on kale, spinach, and carrots resulted in noticeably drier pulp compared to my last juicer. It extracts every last drop of juice, making me feel less guilty about not wasting food. The 150-watt motor, while powerful, runs surprisingly quiet. I can juice early in the morning without rousing the house, a massive win for anyone living with light sleepers.  

[Check Omega J8006 price on Amazon.](https://maisea.com/p/b01exfi1yo/)

**Usage Versatility**  
Calling this just a juicer would undersell its capabilities. On lazy Sundays, I’ve used the attachments to make nut butter, grind coffee beans, and prepare baby food for my little niece. Having such multi-functionality crammed into one machine is impressive because I’m all about reducing the number of appliances that I own. The inclusion of only one speed simplifies things and makes it beginner-friendly. Button controls ensure that even a distracted person like me won’t mess up configurations mid-operation.

**Ease of Cleaning**  
One of the scariest things about buying a juicer is the potential cleaning nightmare. With the Omega J8006, the pieces are easy to disassemble, which makes cleanup straightforward. I didn’t find it dishwasher safe, as advertised, which was a tad disappointing, but rinsing under warm water immediately after juicing works well. Keeping up with cleaning daily ensures no gunky buildup occurs.

**Merits**  
• Quiet motor lets you juice without distraction  
• High juice yield leaves minimal waste  
• Multi-functional for nut butter, grinding, and even baby food  
• Easy to disassemble for quick cleaning  

**Caveats**  
• Can feel bulky if you need to move it often  
• Not dishwasher-friendly despite claims  
• Slow juicing won’t work for everyone’s schedule  

**Competing Brands**  
While the Omega J8006 excels in nutrient retention and quiet operation, it faces stiff competition from other slow-speed juicers. The Breville Juice Fountain is faster and better for those pressed for time, though it sacrifices nutrient preservation. On the other hand, Hurom’s slow juicers have an even more sleek design but tend to be heavier on the wallet. Where the Omega J8006 shines is offering high efficiency for a reasonable price without unnecessary frills. It’s a trade-off between quick convenience versus long-term high-quality yields that you’ll need to weigh.

**Price to Quality Ratio**  
Given the kitchen real estate, feature set, and consistent performance, this machine is worth every penny. It represents a long-term investment for anyone serious about ditching store-bought juice. However, if you’re just looking for mild, occasional use, cheaper options might suffice. Still, for a home chef craving perfection in nutrient retention and fresh juice, it feels fairly priced relative to alternatives of the same caliber.

1mk05zz,https://www.reddit.com/r/HealthMomentum/comments/1mk05zz/could_vital_proteins_collagen_peptides_powder_be/,Could Vital Proteins Collagen Peptides Powder Be the Best Collagen Supplement? Review,"**Daily Use Impressions: Vital Proteins CP05havc Collagen Peptides Powder**  

So, I gave the Vital Proteins CP05havc Collagen Peptides Powder a whirl in my morning routine over the past month. Armed with a giant mug of coffee (and barely one eye open), I've been mixing this collagen powder into my drinks daily, and I've got thoughts—plenty of them. This product promises big things: improved skin elasticity, stronger nails, better hair health, and joint support, all in an unassuming, unflavored powder that blends into your beverages like a ninja. But is it the collagen hero it claims to be? Let’s dive in.  

**Form Factor and Convenience**  
The powder's presentation is top-notch. The container is compact enough to slide neatly into a kitchen cabinet but contains a full 9.33 ounces of product. The unflavored aspect caught my attention right off the bat—unlike other collagen powders that add unnecessary flavors or sweeteners, this one keeps things simple. Adding a serving to my hot coffee or a post-gym smoothie was effortless. It dissolved fully without leaving clumps or residue. No weird aftertaste, just smooth blending. A friend of mine used it in her tea, and it worked out just as well, speaking volumes about its versatility.

[Check Vital Proteins CP05havc price on Amazon.](https://healthquay.com/p/b09rqbhrct/)

**The Promise of Hair, Skin, and Nails**  
One major selling point of this product is its claim to improve your hair, skin, and nails. Personally, I did notice a subtle but real difference in my nails. They're less brittle and actually survived a week of aggressive keyboard smashing at work. My skin also feels smoother—almost as if my moisturizer is getting a power boost. While hair improvement is harder to gauge (especially in the chaos of daily life), my coworker swears her hair feels stronger and less prone to breakage since using the same collagen peptides.  

**Digestibility and Dietary Friendliness**  
Gut health can’t be ignored when introducing something new. Thankfully, the hydrolyzed collagen peptides in this powder are easy on the stomach. I didn't experience any bloating or discomfort, which is always a win with supplements like these. The product's Whole30 and Paleo-friendly certification matters if you follow specific dietary guidelines, plus being gluten-free and dairy-free caters to a broader crowd. I have a friend who avoids gluten religiously—she appreciated the inclusivity here.  

**Assets**  
- Effortlessly blends into hot and cold beverages without clumping.  
- Free from gluten, dairy, and sugar, appealing to various diets.  
- Noticeable improvements in nail strength and skin elasticity.  

**Shortcomings**  
- The container could use a scooper with better measurement markings—it was a guessing game at times.  
- While unflavored, there’s a faint undertone that might bother super-sensitive palettes.  
- It feels a bit pricey relative to some competitors offering larger servings per container.  

**Ingredients and Nutritional Sourcing**  
The collagen is sourced from grass-fed, pasture-raised bovine hides—bonus points for responsible sourcing. I’m a sucker for eco-conscious efforts, so this charged up my guilt-free supplement meter quite a bit. Knowing the ingredients are premium, with no artificial nonsense thrown in, is reassuring. The zero sugar per serving is also a big deal for anyone counting macros or aiming for healthy habits without sneaky additives.  

**Product Competitors**  
Compared to other collagen supplements like Sports Research Collagen Peptides Powder or Ancient Nutrition Multi Collagen Protein, this offering holds its ground. The key advantage here is the high-quality sourcing and unflavored formula. However, competitors often include additional ingredients like Vitamin C or Hyaluronic Acid, which might be useful if you're after more comprehensive skin or joint support. That said, I preferred the stripped-down, no-nonsense formula of this collagen powder for making it easier to match with a varied diet.  

**Value Proposition**  
Considering the results, there’s undeniable value packed into this container. It blends seamlessly with my daily habits. Sure, it’s not the cheapest supplement on the market, but the quality is apparent, particularly with the responsibly sourced ingredients. What you're paying for is less about the bells and whistles, and more about a straightforward collagen boost. For me, the investment is justified when my nails aren’t snapping every time I touch the keyboard.

I’m so glad that even if it takes time- we sit down, look one another in the eyes and talk things through.


I’m so glad we touch, kiss, & connect to feel our way through the things we experience together.


Im so glad our lives are strung together in quiet moments sipping, coffee, tea, or having a snack.
I’m so glad I spend my days as your passenger… holding hands with you. Listening to music, book/podcast, or even when your on work calls….


I’m so glad for it all.


I’m so glad that every single step and milestone of this relationship has taken place and played out in the tactile world….
That there’s scarcely a digital footprint of our love save for the rare moments I do post…..
Or what I’ve left here. It’s all a mere fraction of us.


I’m so glad our promises and memories don’t have a cloud, a flash drive, or device it’s all saved to….. because none of it took place while screens were glowing in our faces,…
Hiding in bathrooms or in stolen moments checking a phone, a watch, an iPad, a laptop.


I’m so glad for even the bad moments, the yelling, the slamming, falling into one another’s arms and crying on the floor, laying on the bathroom floor- we did all that, we suffered ourselves and one another- raw, unformed, reformed, broken, held together…. Right there in one another’s arms.


I’m so glad for the moments of isolation. Of disconnection. Of confusion. Of pain.
They drove us time and again. Over and over- back toward one another.
Seeking deeper and different ways of seeing and understanding one another.
It sparked the flames of curiosity and healing. We found both together and apart.

More than ANYTHING….
I’m so glad that all of this has only strengthened our bond. Our lives together. Our trust and faith in one another… that while we struggle - it’s only for the intensity of our bond and emotion for one another that demands more and more and more of one another.

But I’m SO GLAD.
I’m so glad it’s all with you.

I’m so glad that the truth I’ve known since I was 16 has been and always will be true…..
It’s always you.
It’s always me.
It’s always us.

And we will always do whatever it takes however long it takes to stay in one another’s arms.

It’s the scariest and most beautiful truth of my entire life story.

The things we’d do- the things we’ve done- both unspeakable and sacred……

And I’d do it all again without a seconds hesitation just to have you all over again. ",2,1754573394.0,Original_Poetry,0,1.0,False

1mk04cf,https://www.reddit.com/r/UsedAndRated/comments/1mk04cf/reveal_the_best_coffee_maker_for_pods_and_grounds/,Reveal the Best Coffee Maker for Pods and Grounds with Ninja CFP101,"Testing out the Ninja CFP100 Series has been quite an adventure. As someone who drinks coffee like it’s a full-time job, finding a coffee maker that fits my picky caffeine needs is no small task. This coffee machine is a combination of convenience and functionality, but of course, it’s not perfect. From single-serve pods to a carafe big enough for a small gathering, this machine has tried to cover all bases, and I’ve put it through the wringer to see just how well it performs. Here's what I discovered.

**DESIGN AND BUILD QUALITY**  
The first thing anyone will notice about this coffee maker is its sleek black design. It’s not just a basic coffee machine; it’s got a modern look that can easily blend into any kitchen setting. Its dimensions, 11.03"" x 9.9"" x 15.22"", mean it’s not exactly compact, but it doesn’t feel overwhelmingly bulky either. The build feels sturdy without being absurdly heavy at 8.8 pounds, making it relatively easy to move around when needed. Though I love the aesthetic, the plastic construction did leave me wondering about its durability. It’s functional, sure, but will it hold up after a few years of daily coffee wars? Only time will tell.

**BREWING OPTIONS**  
As someone fussier about coffee than I'd like to admit, I was over the moon to discover just how many options this machine has. It can handle both coffee grounds and pods, allowing for versatility. With 9 ground brew sizes ranging from a single cup to a full carafe, and 4 pod brew sizes (6, 8, 10, or 12 ounces), there's something for every coffee drinker. My mornings usually start with a strong travel mug-sized brew of rich coffee, but on weekends, it’s all about the full carafe of classic drip coffee. The 3 brewing style choices – Classic, Rich, and Over Ice – add a nice touch of customization. I especially loved the Over Ice brew; it doesn’t taste watered down like some iced coffee tends to.

[Check Ninja CFP100 Series price on Amazon.](https://kepmad.com/p/b0cmvd6jb1/)

**PERFORMANCE AND BREW SPEED**  
Claiming to brew faster than popular competitors like the Keurig K-Elite is bold, and thankfully, the Ninja CFP100 Series lives up to this. On most mornings, I need my coffee as quickly as possible – this machine consistently delivers. The thermal flavor extraction duo system is what really shines. It perfectly saturates the coffee grounds and maintains precise temperature control. Every cup tasted balanced and flavorful. However, the machine can get a bit loud during the brewing process, which startled my dog the first few times—something to note if you have a delicate morning routine.  

**ICED COFFEE GAME**  
Iced coffee lovers, rejoice. Brewing over ice is usually a hit-or-miss experience for me. Some machines end up making diluted, sad-looking coffee. This one, however, genuinely delivers. The Over Ice mode melts just enough to yield flavorful, robust coffee. I’ve tested it on 90-degree days, and the coffee held its ground (pun intended). No need to run to the drive-thru anymore!

**BENEFITS**  
- Dual function for both pods and coffee grounds  
- Multiple brew sizes accommodate everything from a small mug to a 12-cup carafe  
- Over Ice brew feature offers strong iced coffee  
- Faster brewing compared to comparable models  
- Convenient 60-ounce water reservoir  
- Dishwasher-safe components make cleaning effortless  

**AREAS OF CONCERN**  
- Noise during brewing might bother sensitive ears  
- The plastic build feels less premium compared to some alternatives  
- Takes up a decent chunk of counter space  
- Limited use for specialty coffee styles  

**EASY CLEANING MADE SIMPLE**  
Cleaning the machine became one of my favorite things about it—yes, cleaning! The Ninja CFP100 Series practically takes care of itself with its clean function. Dishwasher-safe parts are a huge win for someone like me who hates hand-washing tiny filters. The removable Ninja pod adapter is also a helpful feature, making it easy to deep clean when coffee grounds inevitably find their way into places they shouldn’t.  

**COMPETING PRODUCTS**  
In a comparison against competitors like the Keurig K-Elite, the Ninja has a clear edge with its ability to accommodate both coffee grounds and pods in the same machine. While the Keurig might have a slightly quieter operation and fewer options to overwhelm users, it lacks the full carafe feature that the Ninja offers. On the flip side, machines like the Breville Precision Brewer tend to feel more premium, with metal builds and additional brewing settings for coffee snobs like me. Still, the Ninja's affordability and solid performance make it a great middle-ground option for those not wanting to shell out a fortune.

**AFFORDABLE QUALITY**  
Considering all the features packed into this coffee maker, it’s hard to argue that it doesn’t deliver value. It’s not the cheapest coffee machine I’ve tested, but it’s a much more capable device compared to most single-serve pod machines. Knowing that you get both single-serve and carafe capabilities, the price feels fair – not a steal, but also not overpriced. For its versatility and ease of use, you’re definitely getting good bang for your buck.

**Sidharth Chaturvedi, the illustrator, has said the he was most looking forward to drawing the battle of the burning plains, and for another opportunity to draw Angela again.**

>*I've not yet read the later books in the series, so I can only go off what I've read online. I'd love to do another big battle, like the Burning Plains.

**Timeline:**

The Illustrated Edition of *Eragon* was announced on March 8, 2023. That same day, Christopher Paolini stated on Twitter that there were provisional plans to continue with the rest of the series ([1](https://x.com/paolini/status/1633515520443187200)). The Illustrated *Eragon* was published on November 7th. A few days later, in a Reddit AMA, Sidharth said he was interested in returning for *Eldest* but hadn’t yet been contacted ([2](https://www.reddit.com/r/Eragon/comments/17tkb76/hi_reragon_im_sidharth_chaturvedi_the_artist_for/k8yd84f/),  [3](https://www.reddit.com/r/Eragon/comments/17tkb76/hi_reragon_im_sidharth_chaturvedi_the_artist_for/k8ydaf4/), [4](https://www.reddit.com/r/Eragon/comments/17tkb76/hi_reragon_im_sidharth_chaturvedi_the_artist_for/k8yg7wx/),  [7](https://www.reddit.com/r/Eragon/comments/17tkb76/hi_reragon_im_sidharth_chaturvedi_the_artist_for/k8yq34v/)). Shortly after, on his book tour, Christopher confirmed that Eldest was ""100%"" happening ([8](https://www.reddit.com/r/Eragon/comments/1828v92/questions_and_answers_from_christopher_paolinis/)). In December he said that work would begin soon, and by February 2024 confirmed that it had started, with a 2025 release planned ([9](https://youtu.be/76lCd8ozBG8?t=837), [10](https://x.com/paolini/status/1739722376546546145), [12](https://thenest.owlcrate.com/posts/31315)). In June, Christopher said that he was reviewing illustrations, and by November referred to that work in the past tense ([13](https://youtu.be/7STktsbuie0?t=3445), [14](https://www.reddit.com/r/Fantasy/comments/1gvuffs/im_author_christopher_paolini_eragon_sequels_ama/ly5x6gv/?context=1)). On December 29th 2024, Christopher announced that the release date had been pushed back to 2026 due to the number of illustrations and revisions ([15](https://x.com/paolini/status/1873523720406642847)). Christopher has not spoken about the project since then (as of August 2025).

Running clears my head. Coffee keeps me steady. Lately, I’ve been thinking maybe both would be better shared with someone real.

I’m 33, 5'9"", moreno, fit build, working professional based around CAMANAVA. I’m not a car guy. I have an AUV for business use but I mostly move around on my motorcycle. Used to run at UP Oval, sometimes around Valenzuela or C4 road, but I’m open to trying other running spots if you have suggestions. Same with coffee. I usually drink my own brew at home but I’m down to check out new spots if the vibe is good. Lowkey mabango, if that matters. But if you have other activities in mind, I'm open naman.

I usually vibe better with someone younger than me. Gusto ko yung mga sweet, grounded, and chill lang kausap. Bonus na lang if 5'3"" or below at chinita, pero at the end of the day, chemistry pa rin talaga. Bago pa lang ako sa small business scene kaya okay din sa akin yung usapang ganun. Just not into networking or recruit-recruit type of business.

If you’d rather start your day with a run or end it with unhurried coffee and real conversation, maybe this is your sign. Let’s match pace and see where it goes.

1mk03j2,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoMoon/comments/1mk03j2/my_personal_vision_for_kendu/,My Personal Vision For Kendu,"**Introduction**

I just wanna start this out by saying I have only been invested in crypto for 14 months, I am not pretending to be a seasoned veteran. However, I do still have my own personal beliefs, I am 100% invested in Kendu and hold no other coins apart from a bit of ETH for gas fees. 

Whilst I hold Kendu and have full belief in the project, I would be lying if I said I haven't looked around multiple times, yet why do I stay? I stay because no other coin is doing anything even remotely on the same level as Kendu is, and definitely not at these levels.

Kendu's community strength is frankly insane, we are the strongest by far IRL and one of the strongest on social media. We have an insane Reddit, X and Stocktwits presence. We are also active on Instagram and Tiktok but admittedly not as much. 

For me though, I think memecoins will be evolving this cycle, I do not think social media efforts will be enough. We all know AI use is rampant, but so are bots and how can you tell if a community is legit or not when they could be using bots? Well you can't. 

Kendu does not use bots and you can tell this by interacting with people in the Telegram. But another sign is IRL efforts. IRL efforts cannot be faked and they give a project a lot of trust.

https://reddit.com/link/1mk03j2/video/d3wno2npmlhf1/player

Here are Kendu's current IRL efforts(I maybe forgetting some too):

*  Kendu Coffee - A coffee company that sells both caffeinated and decaf coffee farmed in Brazil
* Kendu Energy - An Energy drink company that sells both full sugar and sugar free versions, this is the only product that I have tried. It is GREAT
* Kendu Merch - t-shirts, caps, hoodies, you name it!
* Kendu Hotdog Stand in Florida
* Kendu animation - a team that is making a short, Japanese style, animation series about Kendu, they have released an episode so far!
* Kendu games - a board game made by 2 chads
* Kendu Creator- a 3d printable mask that can be used to make videos online, this means you can showcase your skills whilst still remaining anonymous
* Kendu Jewellery
* Kendu Beer - not out yet, but it is in the making and the prototype is out
* Kendu Video Games - made by professional developers, this is not out yet but we have seen sneak peaks it will be available on Steam and 15% of the profits will be used to buy Kendu for their treasury. We also have a chad called Baba working on a game and Kendu the May who works on simpler games!
* Tattoos - A lot of holders have Kendu tattoos, I have a massive amount of respect for these people. There is 1 that I cannot show though : )
* Murals - Spray painted art
* Kendu Entertainment, a glow in the dark pickleball tournament in India that is gaining lots of traction within the sport
* Kendu Street Team, they have visited 3 festivals in Florida with the most recent one being Florida Groves Festival. They give away Kendu Energy, merch and they also create murals! SO much more is coming soon
* Kendu Vapes
* Kendu Plushies
* Kendu Vendu - vending machines in Nashville Tennessee, but available for worldwide shipping
* Kendu Press 
* Kendu Hand Cream
* Kendu Discs
* Kendu Sneakers

**My Vision:**

I see Kendu revolutionising and evolving the memecoin game forever, just like Shib and Doge did before it. Kendu is setting a brand new standard and will be reaching and expanding into many countries and industries worldwide. Kendu is an umbrella for millions of people globally to work within and to expand their creative interests. Kendu has never been done before and it will rise to the very top. 

Kendu is decentralised, all of these efforts are done by the average holder, imagine how many IRL initiatives are sidelined rn until higher levels...There will be an absolute tsunami of ideas. I know it and tbh I think you do too.

54 years old 

Born in Scotland 
(No specific location given)

Worked transit for the UK army during the infection.

(Interview 1)

Alright, mate. My names Terry and I drove lorries for the army during the apocalypse… or whatever they’re calling it now.

The shipments were everything from food and supplies to weapons and vehicles. Got to deliver a few tanks once. That was cool.

When Z-day kicked off, I was in… England somewhere. I drove lorries for years before any of this. Had no idea anything was happening for a wee while though. Wasn’t until I drove through a village full of the bastards that I fully caught on to what was happening.

I stayed on the road for as long as I could. Finally made it to a military checkpoint and that’s when the asked me if I’d be a driver for them. All their soldiers were super busy with the cannibal uprising that they needed to outsource for all the odd jobs that needed done.

Had a few mates during the… fuck sake, what do we call this shite?

(Interviewer)
“Most people call it the ‘epidemic’.”

Naw, I’m calling it what it was. Anyway, during the zombie apocalypse, I had some mates who got brought in to the army to do some work. Like… contract work almost.
Some were builders, doctors, nurses, electricians, welders, chefs and drivers like me.

Some didn’t really have a choice. Either work for the army or take your chances with the meat munchers out in the quarantine zone. Easy choice.

I stayed in one of those survivor camps for a week or so while they got my paperwork done. Horrible. Everyone huddled together, crying, hungry and smelling of shite. Naw. That wasn’t for me.
Food was scarce for a while. That’s what I ended up delivering for a while. They tried to keep farms up and running but that failed almost instantly.

We got help from other countries. 
Nothing was allowed to leave Britain but we still got stuff brought in.
Those docks were a logistical nightmare. Everything and everyone was screened and questioned constantly.
Sometimes we would be sent fresh fruit and veg but by the time they were cleared for entry, they were already spoiled.
We started getting dried goods for while because of the hold ups. 

So I ended up delivering food for a while. It was those… what do you call them? Those bags of food that you take camping. Ready meal… something…

(Interviewer)
“MRE?”

Aye, them.
They keep for ages. Some company from… Sweden I think it was, were sending them over.
I was allowed to take some for myself to keep me going during my drives.
That ‘all day breakfast’ one was class.

(Interviewer)
“Did you ever have trouble doing your deliveries?”

Oh aye, all the time.
Road blocks, zombies and arseholes trying to rob you. Every day occurrence. 
For the first wee while, I had escorts. A few jeeps and whatnot full of soldiers that would help clear paths for me. After a month or so, I was on my own. All I had was a few guns.

(Interviewer)
“A few?”

Aye. I had a wee pump action. I kept it in the driver side door and I had a rifle in the cabin. One of them modern ones with a big magazine and a scope. Oh and I had this.

(Terry leans back and pulls out a pistol)

This saved my life on many, many different occasions.

(Interviewer)
“Could you please not wave guns around in here.”

What? You feared or what?

(Terry puts his pistol back in it’s holster)

How did you survive? Never shoot anyone or what?

(Interviewer)
“I was abroad during the epidemic.”

Right.
Well it wasn’t a good time. I’ll tell you that. 
I was beaten nearly to death once for the food I was hauling. Did you know that?
I had to walk nearly a hundred miles to get help.
Or the time I ran out of diesel surrounded by zombies.
Times when I get to a survivor camp with supplies and find nothing but torn up tents and walking corpses.

(Interviewer)
“Sorry, I… “

I still have nightmares, mate. And I’m one of the lucky ones. Most of my friends and family… all dead! 
You just saw this shite on the news and on social media! Typical wee arseholes, you see an atrocity happening on your phone screen and it’s all “aw, thoughts and prayers.” Who does that fucking help? You didn’t live through it! I spoke to that soldier you interviewed. He said you were just judging him the whole time. So don’t sit there, judging everyone you interview because we had to do awful things just to stay alive! 
I did shit! I saw shit!
You weren’t fucking there!

(Terry throws his coffee mug at the wall behind the interviewer.)

(Security is called.)

(Short interval is taken before resuming the interview)

(Interviewer)
“So it’s been about an hour or two. Have you calmed down any?”

Away and shite.

(Interviewer)
“I was wanting to address some rumours and stories about the infected.”

Like what?

(Interviewer)
“Have you ever heard of a Nightstalker?”

They’re real

(Interviewer)
“Did you ever see one?”

Aye. 
Scary bastard.

This was about… four or five years into the virus. A lot of them started to change like how they mostly start off blind but most of them got their vision back. Some got REALLY good vision cause they could see in the dark.

I started hearing stories from the soldiers about Nightstalkers. How they’re supposed to be ‘super zombies’ and that they take shit loads of bullets to put one down.  I thought it was a load of shite honestly. Till I saw one.

I was a good few miles from the nearest cordon and I needed a pish. Stupid decision, I know but I really needed to go. It was really late at night, probably around three or so in the morning. Really dark out and I was standing next to the rig taking a slash. Next thing I hear is the freakiest scream I’ve ever heard. Like a werewolf howl but like… possessed, if that makes sense.

I turned around through the trees, all I could see was two yellow eyes staring at me. I looked at it for a few seconds but then it took off running towards me. Pretty fuckin’ fast too. I got into the cab of the truck and locked the door. I heard the thing beating and scratching at the door while it was snarling and screaming the whole time.

I was able to get the truck going again and took off down the road. I swear I saw it running after me but I don’t think it followed for long. When I got to the next safe zone I looked at the side of my truck… big gashes in the metal. Four in a row and about an inch deep.

Aye. Nightstalkers are real.
If the virus could do THAT, then I don’t want to think about what else is out there.

Naw, I’m calling it what it was. Anyway, during the zombie apocalypse, I had some mates who got brought in to the army to do some work. Like… contract work almost.
Some were builders, doctors, nurses, electricians, welders, chefs and drivers like me.

Some didn’t really have a choice. Either work for the army or take your chances with the meat munchers out in the quarantine zone. Easy choice.

I stayed in one of those survivor camps for a week or so while they got my paperwork done. Horrible. Everyone huddled together, crying, hungry and smelling of shite. Naw. That wasn’t for me.
Food was scarce for a while. That’s what I ended up delivering for a while. They tried to keep farms up and running but that failed almost instantly.

We got help from other countries. 
Nothing was allowed to leave Britain but we still got stuff brought in.
Those docks were a logistical nightmare. Everything and everyone was screened and questioned constantly.
Sometimes we would be sent fresh fruit and veg but by the time they were cleared for entry, they were already spoiled.
We started getting dried goods for while because of the hold ups. 

So I ended up delivering food for a while. It was those… what do you call them? Those bags of food that you take camping. Ready meal… something…

(Interviewer)
“MRE?”

Aye, them.
They keep for ages. Some company from… Sweden I think it was, were sending them over.
I was allowed to take some for myself to keep me going during my drives.
That ‘all day breakfast’ one was class.

(Interviewer)
“Did you ever have trouble doing your deliveries?”

Oh aye, all the time.
Road blocks, zombies and arseholes trying to rob you. Every day occurrence. 
For the first wee while, I had escorts. A few jeeps and whatnot full of soldiers that would help clear paths for me. After a month or so, I was on my own. All I had was a few guns.

(Interviewer)
“A few?”

Aye. I had a wee pump action. I kept it in the driver side door and I had a rifle in the cabin. One of them modern ones with a big magazine and a scope. Oh and I had this.

This saved my life on many, many different occasions.

(Interviewer)
“Could you please not wave guns around in here.”

What? You feared or what?

(Terry puts his pistol back in it’s holster)

How did you survive? Never shoot anyone or what?

(Interviewer)
“I was abroad during the epidemic.”

Right.
Well it wasn’t a good time. I’ll tell you that. 
I was beaten nearly to death once for the food I was hauling. Did you know that?
I had to walk nearly a hundred miles to get help.
Or the time I ran out of diesel surrounded by zombies.

(Interviewer)
“Have you ever heard of a Nightstalker?”

They’re real

(Interviewer)
“Did you ever see one?”

Aye. 
Scary bastard.

This was about… four or five years into the virus. A lot of them started to change like how they mostly start off blind but most of them got their vision back. Some got REALLY good vision cause they could see in the dark.

I started hearing stories from the soldiers about Nightstalkers. How they’re supposed to be ‘super zombies’ and that they take shit loads of bullets to put one down.  I thought it was a load of shite honestly. Till I saw one.

I was a good few miles from the nearest cordon and I needed a pish. Stupid decision, I know but I really needed to go. It was really late at night, probably around three or so in the morning. Really dark out and I was standing next to the rig taking a slash. Next thing I hear is the freakiest scream I’ve ever heard. Like a werewolf howl but like… possessed, if that makes sense.

I turned around through the trees, all I could see was two yellow eyes staring at me. I looked at it for a few seconds but then it took off running towards me. Pretty fuckin’ fast too. I got into the cab of the truck and locked the door. I heard the thing beating and scratching at the door while it was snarling and screaming the whole time.

I was able to get the truck going again and took off down the road. I swear I saw it running after me but I don’t think it followed for long. When I got to the next safe zone I looked at the side of my truck… big gashes in the metal. Four in a row and about an inch deep.

Aye. Nightstalkers are real.
If the virus could do THAT, then I don’t want to think about what else is out there.

Alright, mate. My names Terry and I drove lorries for the army during the apocalypse… or whatever they’re calling it now.

The shipments were everything from food and supplies to weapons and vehicles. Got to deliver a few tanks once. That was cool.

When Z-day kicked off, I was in… England somewhere. I drove lorries for years before any of this. Had no idea anything was happening for a wee while though. Wasn’t until I drove through a village full of the bastards that I fully caught on to what was happening.

I stayed on the road for as long as I could. Finally made it to a military checkpoint and that’s when the asked me if I’d be a driver for them. All their soldiers were super busy with the cannibal uprising that they needed to outsource for all the odd jobs that needed done.

I am an atheist and I see hindus criticizing muslims and think don't I and other atheists do all those yet nobody questions us.

Conversion - I have personally convinced my younger brother, cousin sister, 2 ex girlfriends and current wife into atheism. I even converted my college roommate too. (When he joined college he was a devout Brahmin who does suryanamaskar and other rituals when he left college he was a total atheist even once used a large sheet with a diety's picture as a coffee table cover to keep our booze and beef fry on).

If love jihad rulings were secular I would be in jail.

Infact the fastest growing belief is not islam as many believe. It's irreligious (atheists & agnostics). Hindus will be a minority in India not to muslims but to atheists.

Political lobby - well there are no muslim parties that form government in any state. There are atheist parties who successfully do DMK in TN & Communists in Kerala. 

We have successfully made baba ramdev apologise publically and overturned millenium old sabarimala policy (funny thing is muslim and christian bodies supported you guys in sabarimala case).

Killing/Terrorism - To be clear I don't support any form of murder and most muslims also don't do terrorism or murder. But if you look at   the numbers more Indians have died in the hands of naxalites & maoists than Muslim terrorists. 

To be clear I am not a communist I am very pro capitalism & pro industry.

Not all atheists are naxalites like not all muslims are terrorists.

Mutual respect - Many muslims & christians are respectful to hinduism.

Most atheists look down on hindus. Many openly insult hinduism on a regular basis just check atheismindia sub. Christian or muslim subs mostly talk about their own religion, while posts insulting other religions are fewer.

Mods - don't take this down it's an open query. It's not a ragebait. Just curious why we atheists keep getting a free pass while muslims and christians don't.",1,1754572971.0,politicalhindus,6,0.56,False

1mjzx90,https://www.reddit.com/r/CoffeeMakerReviews/comments/1mjzx90/does_the_hamilton_beach_flexbrew_singleserve/,Does the Hamilton Beach FlexBrew Single-Serve Coffee Maker Review Live Up to Expectations?,"The **Hamilton Beach 49900 FlexBrew Single-Serve Coffee Maker** showed up in my kitchen as a compact, space-saving solution for hectic mornings. I have spent weeks brewing cups of coffee with this machine, and here's how it performed—not to sell you on it, but to share my honest experience.

**Compact Design Meets Functionality**  
My kitchen isn’t what you’d call expansive, so saving counter space is a constant goal. This coffee maker's slim design, less than 5 inches wide, slots neatly between my other appliances. Its black finish blends perfectly with modern decor. It’s portable too, so I easily moved it out of sight when hosting dinner parties. However, its build feels slightly light. While durable for daily use, the lightweight materials made me wonder about long-term robustness.  

**Brewing Versatility**  
What I love most is its flexibility. Whether you’re devoted to K-Cup pods or you swear by fresh coffee grounds, this single-serve machine accommodates both. Personally, I alternate between my favorite pods on busy mornings and freshly ground coffee on weekends. Brewing up to 10 ounces with pods or 14 ounces using coffee grounds, it caters to my caffeine needs without compromise. For people like my uncle, who often switches coffee preferences, it’s a win for all tastes. Here’s where you can discover more:  
[Grab Hamilton Beach 49900 at the best price on Amazon.](https://tastefulcoffee.com/p/b095hy42vf/)

**Touch-Sensitive Controls and Brew Choices**  
As someone who appreciates ease of use in a coffee maker, the touch-sensitive controls caught my attention. A light tap lets you adjust between 'Regular' and 'Bold' brew strengths. On a particularly tough Monday morning, I eagerly opted for the bold brew, and I have to say, it didn't disappoint. The brewing process feels tailored, but all the touch-sensitive features rely on gentle input, which might not suit everyone.  

**Fast Brewing for Busy Days**  
Time is everything in the morning rush, and this coffee maker delivers. It brewed an 8-ounce cup in just under 2 minutes—no fuss, just coffee. If you’re like me and always running behind, this feature alone makes the machine worth considering. That said, the brewing time does slightly increase if you opt for the bold brew strength, but I found the additional seconds manageable.  

**Advantages**  
The product boasts several features that genuinely solve everyday coffee needs:  
- Compact design to save counter space.  
- Flexibility to brew with pods or coffee grounds.  
- Speedy brewing for fast-paced mornings.  

**Areas for Improvement**  
Every product has room to grow, and this one is no exception:  
- Lightweight materials could be more robust.  
- Brew strength options may not be precise enough for die-hard coffee aficionados.  

**Ease of Filling and Cleaning**  
The water reservoir is another feature where this machine excels. A simple, easy-to-fill design makes brewing as much or as little coffee as you’ll drink straightforward. A handy water-view window ensures you add just the right amount of water each time, reducing waste. Cleanup, too, is a relatively smooth process. The reusable filter components reduce the need for throwaway filters, adding a touch of eco-friendliness. If only it came with a self-cleaning mode—it would’ve saved me those extra few minutes.  

**Rival Brands**  
In comparison to its competitors, such as Keurig's more premium models, this coffee maker cuts down the frills without sacrificing core performance. While the Keurig lineup offers higher build quality and a wider range of brewing options, they often take up more counter space and come at a higher cost. On the flip side, budget brands like Mr. Coffee provide similar single-serve machines but lack features like bold brew strength and touch-sensitive controls. The coffee maker carves its niche as an affordable middle ground.  

**Price to Quality Ratio**  
Given its robust feature set and daily convenience, this coffee maker presents good value for those on a budget. It competes well against pricier machines by focusing on essentials without overloading you with unnecessary complexities or gadgetry. Its lower price point compared to high-end competitors makes it an appealing option for anyone balancing affordability with functionality.

1mjzv5u,https://www.reddit.com/r/CountertopConfessions/comments/1mjzv5u/revealing_if_keurig_kmini_coffee_maker_truly_fits/,Revealing If Keurig K-Mini Coffee Maker Truly Fits Your Needs,"The Keurig 062151516236 has been part of my morning routine for weeks now, and trust me, I’ve put it through its paces. As someone who thrives on a good, fast caffeine fix, this compact single-serve coffee maker has a lot to offer—though it's not free from some quirks. Whether I'm at home squeezing it onto a slim countertop or using it in a cramped office breakroom, it seems built for people with limited space but unlimited coffee needs.

**Compact Design Befitting Small Spaces**  
This thing is seriously small—just under 5 inches wide. I've used keurigs before, but the dimensions make this one a lifesaver in tight corners. In my case, I have it perched on a narrow kitchen shelf. While its “Poppy Red” color also catches the eye (in a good way, if you like bold kitchen gadgets), what clinches it for me is the matte finish; it doesn’t scream for attention, even though it subtly demands it. Despite the compact size, the machine doesn’t skimp on features, keeping both form and utility intact.

**Effortless Functionality**  
Everything about this coffee maker feels intuitive. Filling the single reservoir with fresh water is straightforward, and choosing your brew size between 6-12 oz is as smooth as pushing a button. I love that it uses Keurig K-Cup pods, which are conveniently available in a ridiculous number of flavors. Although the machine claims you can brew your coffee in minutes, mine consistently delivers a fresh cup in under a minute—a critical time-saver during my morning scramble. For someone like me, who occasionally experiments with different coffee brands, compatibility with the reusable “My K-Cup” coffee filter was a pretty delightful discovery.  

[Check Keurig 062151516236 price on Amazon.](https://cookwareoutlet.com/p/b096yr1w7r/)

**Energy Efficiency That Stands Out**  
One of my favorite things is the auto-off feature, which kicks in 90 seconds after the brew finishes. I tend to forget to turn off appliances, so this small but meaningful addition is a win for both my energy bill and peace of mind. It's particularly handy in the office setting, where machines are often left running unnecessarily.

**Travel Mug Friendly Features**  
The removable drip tray is another smart touch. Although I mainly use standard mugs at home, I took this to an RV trip with friends, and it fit travel mugs up to 7 inches tall without a hitch. Plus, it caught accidental drips more effectively than I anticipated—no messy clean-ups needed. This was surprisingly effective when serving multiple people back-to-back, though you must refill the water reservoir each time since it’s designed for single-use brewing.

**Upsides**  
- Takes up minimal space—fits on virtually any countertop.  
- Compatible with universal reusable filters for DIY coffee enthusiasts.  
- Easy-to-store power cord prevents countertop clutter.  
- Auto-off feature adds a layer of energy efficiency.  

**Shortcomings**  
- Lacks a multi-cup reservoir; you need to refill for every brew.  
- Can feel limiting for households that drink coffee in high volumes.  
- Produces a faint plasticky odor early on, but this wears off after the first few brews.  

**Competing Products**  
Compared to its rivals like the Black+Decker Single-Serve Coffee Maker, the Keurig K-Mini stands tall in design and compact usability. The Black+Decker may feel a tad more affordable but doesn't offer the slim aesthetic nor the reusable filter compatibility, which I find indispensable. On the flip side, Keurig's lack of a multi-cup capability makes it less ideal than something like the Hamilton Beach FlexBrew, which offers dual brewing modes. Keurig’s time efficiency and portability, though, definitely secure it a solid spot for users like me who focus on compactness and speed.  

**Price Performance**  
When weighing the compact design, simplicity, and brewing consistency against its price tag, I’d consider this machine a solid ""bang for the buck."" Sure, it won't be a perfect match for large households, and water refills can get tedious. But for single users, couples, or office settings needing quick one-cup solutions, it’s absolutely worth investigating. Its combination of portability and energy efficiency gives it an edge over bulkier, more complex machines.

I'm finding things difficult but a lot of it's more mental/emotional rather than physical now, and I'm holding out hope on the fact that I know these first few weeks are always hard!

One of the long-term changes I'm struggling with at the moment is the drinking breaks. With any food consumption taking around 20 minutes and needing to stop drinking 30 mins before and not drink 30 mins after, any food break in the day means no drinking for 80 minutes. Once I eat, I'm always immediately thirsty. This means I basically dread eating and tend to only have two food breaks in the day (lunch and dinner broadly) and get the rest of my protein from liquids (clear protein powder drinks, protein water, and milky coffee).

I understand the reasons behind the need for these breaks but I'm wondering if this really is always a permanent change or if these times ease up at all over the months or even years? I'm also wondering if maybe a small sip of something right after eating would be a major issue? It doesn't take much to quench my thirst - in fact, when my post-meal timer goes off I grab a drink and take one or two sips and am typically satisfied despite feeling parched!

tl;dr:

1. Do you carry on the 30 mins no fluids either side of food forever or do many of you find this length of time is not necessary?

2. Would a small sip of squash or something right after eating be a big issue do you think?",1,1754572513.0,GastricBypass,3,1.0,False

Ever feel like you’re trying to juggle 27 things at once and it’s only Tuesday? 🙈 Yeah, me too! Life has a way of tossing demands at us like we’re in a game of dodgeball, and honestly, it can get overwhelming. But what if I told you there’s a way to swim instead of sink? 🏊‍♀️ Enter *habit stacking*—your new secret weapon!

**So, what is habit stacking?**  
It’s all about combining small, manageable habits into a single routine. Imagine this: instead of trying to squeeze a million things into your day, you stack them together and knock them out at once. Genius, right? 🙌 It takes less effort and can totally clear your mental clutter.

Here’s how to get started in just **10 minutes a day**:

1. **Identify Your Existing Habits**: What do you already do daily? Coffee in the morning? Brushing your teeth? Check! 
   
2. **Choose a New Habit to Stack**: Pick something you want to add, like meditating for 5 minutes or jotting down a few gratitude notes. 

3. **Link the Two**: Now, combine! “I’ll meditate while my coffee is brewing.” or “I’ll write in my gratitude journal right after brushing my teeth.” 

4. **Keep It Simple**: Seriously, don’t overthink this. In the beginning, less is more. Just focus on stacking 1-2 habits at a time.

5. **Track Your Progress**: Use an app or good ol’ fashioned pen and paper. Celebrate those tiny victories!

And just like that, you’re on your way to conquering the chaos! 🌈

Here’s why habit stacking is a game changer:

- **Less Overwhelm**: Instead of getting anxious thinking about a million tasks, you’re combining them into fun little bundles.
  
- **Boosts Productivity**: You’ll be amazed at how much you can get done without feeling like you’re drowning.

- **Creates Momentum**: Once you start stacking, you’ll want to add even more habits. It’s like a snowball effect—who doesn’t love that? ❄️

But hey, I totally get it—starting something new can feel intimidating. What if you forget? What if you mess it up? 🤷‍♀️ 

Here’s a little *life hack* from my own trials and tribulations: It’s okay to stumble! The beauty of habit stacking is that it's flexible. Some days you might nail it, other days you might just manage to sip your coffee and breathe. And that’s perfectly fine.

At the end of the day, it’s about progress, not perfection. So grab your life raft, and let’s get stacking! Who's with me? 🚀✨

Hey there, MaximizeMe fam! 👋

Ever find yourself drooping in the middle of the day, when suddenly your brain decides to hit the snooze button right after lunch? 😴 Yeah, me too. It's like clockwork. Just when I need my brain to be doing that “being productive” thing, it decides it'll just…take five. But what if I told you that **2 minutes** a day could turn that around? 

I stumbled upon this breathing technique that's supposedly backed by science (fancy, right? 🧐), and I thought, *Why not?* Couldn't hurt to try! So, I decided to give it a shot for a week. Here’s how it went down:

### Day 1: The ""Am I Doing This Right?"" Phase
I’ll admit, it was weird at first. You breathe in deeply—like you're trying to inhale all of 2023’s positive vibes—and then slowly breathe out. Inhale, exhale... and repeat. Seriously, I was half expecting a magical breeze to blow in or something.

### Day 3: The ""Hey, I Might Be Onto Something"" Realization
It started being kind of… relaxing? The usual post-noon zombification didn’t hit as hard, and I actually managed to finish an entire meeting without zoning out. Who knew oxygen was so underrated?

### Day 5: Wait, is it Happening?
By now, my coworkers were starting to ask what was up with my new zen spirit. My focus had kind of supercharged. It felt like someone upgraded my brain to the Premium Version™.

### Day 7: Feeling Like a Breathing Pro
Turns out, giving myself just **2 minutes** of focused breathing was like telling my brain, “Let’s get back in the game.” I noticed I wasn’t just awake in the afternoons—I was alert. And the best part? I didn’t need a gallon of coffee to make it happen. ☕

Why does this work? Well, when you breathe deeply, you increase oxygen flow, lower stress, and calm your mind. It's like a mini brain reset without any side effects (except looking slightly odd for two minutes—worth it!).

Now, I’m curious if any of you have tried similar tips for conquering the afternoon slump? Or are you thinking of giving this a whirl? Those 2 minutes might surprise you, just like they did for me. 🌀

My son starts Kindergarten on Monday— his very first school experience (no Pre-K, no daycare), and I wanted to ask you all something before I unintentionally become that parent.

I was thinking about giving his teacher a small “hi, here’s my kid!” note along with a gift (something like a coffee gift card, chocolate, and some classroom supplies, not a personalized portrait of her future student— I promise). The note would include a quick snapshot of who he is: what he likes, his personality, what helps when he’s feeling overwhelmed or being a bit of a menace, and what he’s still working on doing independently. It would be included in the gift basket, so I don’t expect them to read it right there in front of me.

He’s going through a lot of big changes right now (starting school, becoming a big brother, and recently moving to a new state) and I figured a little context might help his teacher understand where he’s coming from. I also 1000% don’t want to come across as expecting special treatment or adding to their already massive workload during the chaos of Meet the Teacher night.

So I’m asking you all: is this kind of note helpful? Sweet? Annoying? Overkill? I genuinely just want to be supportive and not silently stress them out even more.

Thanks in advance for your thoughts and everything you do. I’m already impressed by anyone who willingly chooses to hang out with 15+ five-year-olds on purpose.",0,1754572353.0,Teachers,3,0.5,False

1mjzpc4,https://www.reddit.com/r/alcoholicsanonymous/comments/1mjzpc4/here_we_go_again/,Here we go again,"In the summer of 2023 I started heavily drinking. I was with a girl who was not right for me, and life was generally not something I wanted to do anymore.
Her and I split in January, I remember it, driving around drunk off my ass crying, screaming, drooling. Thankfully found my way back to my house without killing anybody. That’s when the heavy drinking turned into a daily routine.
One morning I was piss drunk, as I would get prior to work, every morning. And I had lost my wallet in my drunken stupor the night before. I must’ve been making too much noise, cause my dad came in the room and met my collection of liquor bottles. He just helped me find my wallet, and went back to bed. Mind you it’s probably 5 in the morning. Little did I know, he took my car keys while helping me look for my wallet, and then when I went to stumble out of the house without my keys, he was down there, cup of coffee, telling me I’m not driving anywhere. I just accepted it, went back up to bed. Didn’t call work, just no call-no showed.
That was the first time I got sober. Three days of puking up stomach acid, making promises to myself, and my parents.
Only to break them down the line. The summer that followed was when I had my next drink. Everyone was drinking, we were at the beach. It seemed harmless, and it definitely was a good time. The next morning, I’d drink again. And I kept that up.
The following week I met my future wife, which slowed my drinking down a lot. Well, for a couple months.
We live together now, but when we first met we were a 3 hour drive away from each other. I started taking bottles and emptying them into my stomach on the highway.
That ended when I wound up totaling my car and getting it stuck in a ditch. That ironically was also the weekend I decided to move my life to be with my girlfriend. Probably not the smartest idea, but I did it and I was making it work.
Turns out it’s a lot easier to be a drunk when you’re not living with your parents.
So, two months into my new job, I fell over and broke my leg, drunk, at work. The day after I went to my first meeting. It was scary, really scary, but everyone was very supportive and interested in my story. 
So I was sober, for a few months. I stopped going to meetings pretty quickly, I probably didn’t even go to 20 meetings. Then I got a new job, had to, I was about ready to open a few more credit cards so that I could make bills. Luckily I have the best girlfriend, who helped me through that.
The new job opened the door to me drinking again. I have had a drink (probably closer to 5+) everyday since then. Until today.
Yesterday my roommate found me unconscious in the bathroom with my pants down. She called my girlfriend and my girlfriend came home from work early, to deal with me. She asked me when I started drinking again, and I told her, I told her I was ashamed, and sorry. I still am.
She didn’t deserve that. I can’t help but feel like it’s futile, like I’m just bound to relapse again.

Sorry, I just needed to share. Thank you.

1mjzoyn,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheBagCheck/comments/1mjzoyn/could_amazon_basics_hardside_checked_luggage/,Could Amazon Basics Hardside Checked Luggage Review Solve Travel Woes With Durability and Space?,"The first time I laid my hands on the Amazon Basics T16459-3, a 30-inch hardside checked luggage, I was struck by its sleek and professional design. As someone who travels frequently for both work and leisure, I’m no stranger to the wear and tear that luggage endures. This suitcase stood tall with its sturdy, scratch-resistant surface—a feature that immediately proved valuable after my first multi-leg trip. I accidentally scraped it against airport trolleys and conveyor belts, yet its exterior still looked impeccable. For those who worry about appearances post-travel, this design is a game changer.

**Durability That Delivers**  
Built for the rugged life of frequent travel, this luggage boasts a durable hard-shell structure that feels solid from the get-go. The scratch-resistant material doesn’t just serve cosmetic purposes; it actually adds to its overall longevity. Even with my overpacking tendencies (which I’m guilty of every trip), it held its shape without any visible stress marks. Moreover, at just 9.6 pounds, it’s impressively lightweight for its size. I’ve carried heavier suitcases with half the capacity, so this was like a breath of fresh air for hauling through terminals.

[Check Amazon Basics T16459-3 price on Amazon.](https://bagsby.com/check/b07fnskmst/)

**Spacious Interior for Packing Monsters Like Me**  
I’m the kind of person who stuffs ‘just in case’ outfits into my luggage, so the 97-liter interior capacity was a blessing. With dimensions of 20.5 x 12 x 30 inches, I managed to fit enough clothing for two weeks, along with my shoes, toiletries, and even a couple of souvenirs on the return leg. One standout feature is its expandable zipper, which allows up to 12.5% more packing space. Trust me, having that extra room came in handy when I picked up a chunky wool sweater in Iceland. The internal compartments are thoughtfully designed too—with zippered dividers and cross straps that kept everything organized and secure.

**Smooth Rolling Experience**  
Navigating crowded airports can be stressful, but maneuvering this suitcase through busy terminals was effortless. The eight multi-directional double spinner wheels glided like a dream. Even when packed to the brim, I could pull it alongside me with one hand while juggling a coffee and my phone in the other. The wheels didn’t squeak or feel flimsy, which has been an issue with other suitcases I’ve owned. These are smooth operators, perfect for anyone who values ease during their rush to catch a connecting flight.

**Reliable TSA-Approved Lock**  
Security while traveling is non-negotiable for me, especially with checked baggage. The integrated TSA lock added an extra layer of protection for my belongings. Naturally, I tend to triple-check that my valuables are secure, and knowing that this lock is TSA-compliant helped me breathe easy. Setting up the lock took only a minute and was straightforward—no fumbling through overly complicated instructions.

**Perks**  
- Highly durable, scratch-resistant exterior for rugged trips.  
- Spacious 97-liter capacity with expandable design for heavy packers.  
- Lightweight yet robust construction at just 9.6 lbs.  
- Smooth, multi-directional wheels for seamless navigation.  

**Flaws**  
- No external pockets for quick access items, which some may find inconvenient.  
- The glossy black surface can still show fingerprints over time, requiring wipes for maintenance.  

**Other Options in the Market**  
Being a bit of a luggage nerd, I’ve tried a few competitors in the same price range. The Samsonite Winfield 2, for example, offers solid quality but comes with a heftier price tag and weighs more, which might discourage anyone keen on minimizing lifting strain. Meanwhile, the Travelpro Maxlite 5 checks the lightweight box superbly but lacks the same durability against scratches. Compared to these, this luggage's blend of value and features strikes a winning balance that meets the needs of many modern travelers.

**Value Proposition**  
While I don’t pinpoint exact pricing due to market fluctuations, I will say that this suitcase sits comfortably in the sweet spot between affordability and premium feel. For anyone like me, who demands a blend of reliability, spaciousness, and ease of transport without breaking the bank, it’s a no-brainer. The thoughtful additions like TSA-approved protection and a polished, durable finish extend its appeal even further. If you prioritize getting your money’s worth, this product ticks all the right boxes.

1mjzifj,https://www.reddit.com/r/SIBO/comments/1mjzifj/stubborn_sibo_symptoms_after_xifaxan/,Stubborn SIBO symptoms after Xifaxan,"I had SIBO in 2018. It was horrible, I was throwing up all the time and I had unintended weight loss. Thankfully, I was able to overcome it with dietary and lifestyle changes. I also incorporated probiotics and it seemed to be cured up until recent years. I slowly started struggling with stomach problems that became worse and worse over time to the point where I suspected I had SIBO again.

I had all the symptoms you can think of. Constant abdominal pain, vomiting, gas, alternating diarrhea and constipation, excessive bloating where I felt 7 months pregnant every time I ate. If I ate something that was slightly triggering to my already sensitive stomach, I would have episodes where the pain would get so severe, it had me crying on the bathroom floor thinking I was going to pass out. I was even at risk of losing my job because I was calling out so much because of this. I became so scared to eat that I started fasting and eating very small, plain meals to break my fast. I cut out coffee (which gave me horrible caffeine withdrawals) and I started a low FODMAP diet. I lost around 15-20lbs since the end of last year. I tried what I did last time to cure it but it wasn’t working this time around.

My bloodwork, stool samples and CT scan all came back normal but my breath test detected SIBO, where both hydrogen and methane levels were elevated. I had to resort to antibiotics. I went through hoops to get Xifaxan since my insurance wouldn’t approve it. I recently finished the 2 week course and I can’t say I feel 100% better. During my course, my bloating decreased tremendously and I no longer was having diarrhea, but it seemed to have caused constipation. I’ve been having somewhat normal bowel movements but it’s still irregular most of the time. The Xifaxan also seemed to have cause irritation since I was still getting some stomach pain and nausea. I was also still experiencing excess mucus in my stool. What freaked me out was that I noticed blood in my stool on the last day of the antibiotics. I told my doctor about that and she wants to rule out any other issues, so I have to get a colonoscopy/EGD at the end of the month.

I read that Xifaxan clears good bacteria along with the bad, so I am currently taking probiotics to hopefully balance that out. It’s been about 2 weeks since I finished it and I’m finally able to eat somewhat normally now, but the bloating and mucus seems to be coming back. For the past few days, I’ve been waking up feeling so bloated and end up spending like 15 minutes in the bathroom just passing gas, no bowel movement (this was a problematic symptom before treatment). I’m worried that it was all for nothing. I’m not sure if I should be taking a specific strain of probiotic to help that but for now I’m just waiting to do my colonoscopy/EGD.

I feel like this has taken over my life for so long and I just want to feel normal again. I want to be able to go to a restaurant with my family and eat the foods that I used to enjoy so much.

Imagine zooming in and out on a map to explore job opportunities, not just by radius, but by neighborhood, commute, and lifestyle fit (maybe you want to see what jobs are available in the same plaza as your kid's daycare, or on the same block as their school). Then, instead of just reading a bland job post, you could actually see photos of the building, your potential office space, amenities like the break room or coffee bar, and even team or management photos.

This would help candidates visualize themselves in the role before applying, likely leading to more confident interviews and better fits overall.

For employers, it’s a chance to stand out visually and attract the kind of candidates who *choose* them, not just apply at random.

1mjzg3u,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1mjzg3u,Namma Bengaluru - A solo trip after heartbreak,"Just had the biggest heartbreak of my life. My 7-year-long relationship ended this July. The love of my life walked away and never really gave me the full truth. I didn’t look back. On his birthday after work I impulsively booked a one-way ticket to Bangalore, packed my bags, and left. It was also my birthday week. I felt suffocated and isolated.So I ran. Not because I was scared, but because I had switched into survival mode.

And honestly? Best decision ever.

I took myself on solo dates.
– Went to Rameshwaram Cafe at midnight
– Ate the crispiest dosa at Arogya Ahaar and had the best filter coffee
– Had an anxiety attack, walked it off, and found comfort at a random chai stall
– Met a little one who will someday call me Maasi
– Celebrated my birthday with myself and two closest friends
– Tried sushi and craft beer for the first time
– Got drunk and danced like crazy at BOHO Koramangala, and went on a long night bike ride.
– Ate ramen and sang on karaoke night (Full bollywood) at Bohemian, Indiranagar. 
– Met a sweet street dog named Giani while eating ice cream

One of my friends even made me the most comforting breakfast bowl when I had no appetite. That kindness... I’ll never forget.

I read my favorite book on a terrace under perfect Bangalore weather (Been sweating non-stop since I came back to Mumbai lol). I travelled back and forth alone by train...a huge step, since long train journeys to impromptu trips used to be our love language..very sacred.

There were cold moments, lonely ones too...
But strangely, I also felt free and maybe independent. Bangalore broke me and healed me. It took everything... and somehow gave me the closure I didn’t know I needed.

Already planning my next solo trip for 2026 : Leh-Ladakh circuit (a long-time dream). Darr lag rha hai but theek hai.

TL;DR – Solo trip after breakup. I found food, friends, freedom and a version of myself I missed.

1mjzd7o,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/1mjzd7o/6_months_today/,6 Months Today!!!,"Wow. I made my goal. I didn't even realize it until a minute ago after I wrote today's date on my to-do list for work. 

PROS

No innate desire to go back. On to 7 months. 

Mood is way more stable, even though I am at an age where my hormones are a bit wonky. 

Way less anxiety and depression, almost to the point of nonexistence. When they do pop in for a visit, their stay is relatively quick and painless. However, my husband is an alcoholic and his struggles and my interactions with him are a chronic stressor. 

I haven't been out sick with allergies, colds, stomach, etc. this entire six months. 

I exercise almost every day and my body looks fit and healthy. My cardiovascular system is well above average for my age. I get a lot of confidence and joy from being able to keep fit. 

My face looks way younger and thinner. Im 41, but someone who had nothing to gain told me she thought I was like no older than 32. 

Eyes are deeper blue rather than a tired, washed out color. 

I do not factor alcohol into my life. There are times I wonder about it, and its maybe two of the 6 million thoughts I have a day. 

In line with above, I realize alcohol isnt a primary coping mechanism. My psychologist helped me realize this last week. Now, when I am stressed or need time away, I go for walks or exercise or go walk around the mall or get a coffee and read.. I had a hellish week at work so far, and not once did I consider having some wine when the day was done. 

CONS

I socialize by attending barbecues or going to classes. I don't prefer big social outings, but then again, I never really did. I don't ""party"" for long hours. I mostly ignore this but I do sometimes get FOMO until I remind myself that the last 20 years of drinking was kinda the same: laugh about dumb shit, stay up too late, feel like shit, repeat. 

I feel criticized or belittled for my choices sometimes, like I am in the wrong for not wanting to ""spend time"" with people until 4 am. 

I am feeling disconnected from my husband, who spends his life working, drinking, and sleeping. We do things together like have dinner and cook once in a while, but I feel like I am moving toward a different direction while he stands still. I don't want him to drag me back to where we were. 

My sleep is still kinda all over the place. I usually wake up around 530 but not quite ready to start the day, so I toss and turn until like 7 or 730. That could have more to do with my diet and stress, but I am still working on keeping better sleep hours.

1mjzcvn,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortstories/comments/1mjzcvn/sp_liminal_spaces/,[SP] Liminal Spaces,"Mei noticed the glitch on a Tuesday.

The timestamp on the coffee shop surveillance feed jumped backward 37 seconds, then forward 94. To anyone else monitoring the citywide network, it would have registered as simple packet loss—the mundane hiccup of digital infrastructure. But Mei's brain didn't process time like others did. Where they saw continuous flow, she perceived discrete frames, each with its own temporal signature.

This wasn't packet loss. This was something else.

She tagged the anomaly and continued her shift at CivicEye, where her ""unique cognitive profile"" (their words) made her exceptional at spotting patterns in the endless rivers of surveillance data. They valued her abilities but kept her isolated in a sensory-controlled room—too many stimuli disrupted her processing, they said. Really, they just didn't want to accommodate her needs in the open office.

The next day, three more anomalies appeared. All in the same block of Westlake Avenue, all showing the same pattern: time stretching and compressing like taffy being pulled.

Mei created a private investigation thread. She mapped each anomaly, noting the precise coordinates and temporal shifts. After her shift, she took the light rail to Westlake.

The coffee shop looked ordinary—gleaming counters, bored baristas, the familiar blue glow of monitoring lenses in each corner. She ordered a tea she wouldn't drink and sat by the window, watching the time code tick in her augmented-reality glasses.

Nothing happened for 47 minutes. Then, as a specific combination of people entered and exited simultaneously, her glasses flickered. The timestamp froze, then jumped. In that moment, Mei felt a subtle shift—like the air pressure had changed.

She walked outside, feeling disoriented. Across the street stood a bookstore her map didn't show. Her glasses displayed no information about it—no name, no reviews, no data trail. The building existed in a digital blind spot.

Heart racing, she crossed the street. As she approached, her AR glasses glitched again, temporal markers scrambling. She removed them, blinking at the sudden clarity of unmediated vision.

The bookstore's window displayed a single sign: ""For Those Who See The Frames Between.""

Inside, she found not books but people—dozens of them, talking quietly, working at terminals, moving with purpose. No monitoring lenses watched from corners. No data trails followed their movements.

A woman approached, her movements exhibiting the familiar slight angularity that Mei recognized from her own reflection.

""You found us,"" she said. Not a question.

""What is this place?"" Mei asked.

""A pocket in time. A glitch in surveillance. We call them liminal spaces—places that exist between the frames most people perceive as continuous time.""

The woman introduced herself as Ellis. She explained that specific configurations of mass, movement, and energy could create temporary breaks in the surveillance network's perception—moments when time didn't register correctly.

""We discovered it by accident,"" Ellis said. ""Some of us experience time differently. We notice the frames, the pauses between moments that others process as continuous. We realized we could extend those pauses, create spaces within them.""

""How many?"" Mei asked.

""Thirty-seven across the city now. More appearing as we learn. Places where we can exist without being constantly tracked, categorized, optimized.""

Ellis showed her a map of the city unlike any Mei had seen—marked not with streets but with temporal coordinates, each indicating a liminal space where surveillance failed and time behaved differently.

""Some only last minutes. Others, like this one, we've stabilized for months. We're building something here—a different way of living.""

Mei thought of her sterile monitoring room at CivicEye, how they valued her perception but treated it as a malfunction to be contained. Here was a community that had transformed that same perception into liberation.

""The corporations think our neurodivergence is something to be harnessed or fixed,"" Ellis continued. ""They never considered we might use it to find the gaps in their systems.""

""What happens if they detect these spaces?"" Mei asked.

""They recalibrate, we adapt. It's becoming its own evolution. But we need more people who see the frames. People like you.""

Mei's AR glasses buzzed in her pocket—her shift started in an hour. She should go back, return to her role identifying anomalies for the system to patch.

Instead, she placed her glasses on a nearby table.

""Show me how to extend the pauses,"" she said.

Ellis smiled. ""Welcome to the spaces between.""

As she walked out hours later, Mei perceived the city in a different light. Behind the seamless illusion of continuous surveillance, she now recognized dozens of temporal pockets—small sanctuaries hidden in plain sight—places where people like her weren't anomalies to be isolated but pioneers of a hidden cartography.

Tomorrow, she would return to CivicEye one last time—not to monitor, but to create new glitches, expanding the map of liminal spaces where a different future was already taking root.",1,1754571402.0,shortstories,1,1.0,False
1mjzciy,https://www.reddit.com/r/ReviewTheRoom/comments/1mjzciy/what_makes_the_technivorm_moccamaster_kbgv_select/,What Makes the Technivorm Moccamaster KBGV Select a Top Coffee Maker?,"Testing out the Technivorm Moccamaster 53923 coffee maker has been quite the enjoyable experience for a daily coffee drinker like myself. Being someone who routinely starts the day with a cup (or three) of coffee, I put this machine to the test over several weeks, using it in different scenarios to gauge its usability, quality, and versatility. Let me just say, this coffee maker has a lot going for it, but it also has some quirks that potential buyers should know about.

**Design and Build Quality**  
There's something about this machine's Juniper finish that instantly elevates the look of my kitchen. It's both sleek and understated in design, giving a blend of modern minimalism and high-grade durability. The unit is fairly compact, with dimensions of 6.5 inches deep, 12.75 inches wide, and 14 inches high. It fits snugly on my countertop without taking too much real estate. The glass carafe and the metal accents feel durable, and I don't see this machine wearing down easily with regular use. What stood out the most is the independent heating element on the hotplate, which keeps coffee at just the right temperature without turning it into sludge.  

**Ease of Use**  
Navigating through this coffee maker is incredibly straightforward; with just one switch, I could brew a full 40-ounce carafe in mere minutes—4 to 6 minutes to be exact. That speed really caught my attention, especially on mornings when I'm rushing out the door. The selector switch for brewing either a half or full carafe adds flexibility for different occasions. However, the filter basket doesn't feel as intuitive as I'd hoped, as it took me some trial and error before getting it properly seated. Small gripe, but worth noting.  

[Check Technivorm Moccamaster 53923 price on Amazon.](https://ngadgets.com/p/b0bpjqs63w/)

**Brewing Performance**  
The Technivorm Moccamaster 53923 brews coffee that tastes exceptionally clean and flavorful, largely thanks to its pump-free design that heats water for ideal coffee extraction. I've brewed everything from dark roasts to light single-origin blends, and it seems to bring out the best notes each time. The consistency of the coffee is impressive—it’s like having a small café at home. However, the pour from the carafe could be better; the spout design occasionally causes drips, which can be annoying when you're trying to keep your counter spotless.

**Quiet Operation and Safety**  
One aspect I immediately appreciated is how quiet this coffee maker operates. There's no obnoxious humming or buzzing; it simply does its job without adding noise pollution to my morning routine. Safety-wise, the auto shut-off feature after 100 minutes is a thoughtful touch. Anyone else ever panic because they left an appliance running? Not to mention, the brew basket’s ability to stop the flow of coffee when the carafe is removed prevents accidental spills—a lifesaver for my slightly clumsy self.  

**Upsides**  
Here are a few standout positives from my experience:  
- Compact, elegant design with a Juniper finish that enhances kitchen aesthetics.  
- Pump-free system ensures optimal brewing temperatures for excellent coffee extraction.  
- Brew selector switch is handy for preparing just the right amount of coffee.  
- Independent heating plate keeps coffee warm without scorching it.  

**Negatives**  
While this coffee maker scores highly, a few pain points became evident:  
- The filter basket seating mechanism could be more intuitive.  
- Carafe spout design leads to occasional dripping when pouring.  
- It doesn’t come with reusable filters, so you’ll need to keep buying paper filters.  

**Competing Products**  
Compared to other coffee makers in its same price bracket, this machine holds up remarkably well. For example, I've tried the Breville Precision Brewer, which offers a wider range of brewing options but felt overly complicated in its setup. Meanwhile, the Bonavita BV1900TS delivers similarly good coffee but falls short in aesthetics and lacks the same robust build as the Moccamaster. Where this Technivorm model shines is its combination of simplicity, excellent brew quality, and long-term durability, all wrapped in a high-end package.  

**Bang for the Buck**  
At its price point, this coffee maker is a premium product, and its features justify the investment for avid coffee enthusiasts. Mind you, it's not the machine you buy if you're okay with a generic $50 coffee maker churned out at the local big-box store. What you get here is premium performance, a gorgeous design, and coffee that genuinely tastes better. For anyone who drinks coffee daily and appreciates the nuances of brewing, this coffee maker feels absolutely worth every penny.

1mjzbtr,https://www.reddit.com/r/Eloping/comments/1mjzbtr/anyone_here_planning_to_tie_the_knot_in_japan_as/,Anyone here planning to tie the knot in Japan as foreigners? Here’s what you need to know for 2025 and 2026,"**Background**

Over the past few years I have helped several international friends navigate Japanese paperwork for everything from tiny shrine blessings in Kyoto to official city - hall registrations in Tokyo. Each case showed me a slightly different wrinkle in the system, so I kept notes and cross-checked them with ward offices and embassies right up to August 2025. Below is the most complete, vendor-free guide I can write for anyone planning an elopement in Japan and wanting it to count back home.

**Choosing the right legal route**

Japan offers four main pathways. Two non-Japanese partners can hand in a bilingual marriage registration form, the kon’in todoke, at any city or ward office; once the clerk stamps it the marriage is recognised nationwide. A mixed couple - one Japanese, one foreign - uses the same form but must add a freshly issued copy of the Japanese partner’s family register, the koseki tohon, plus photo ID. Same-sex partners cannot obtain a national marriage yet, but more than fifty municipalities now issue partnership certificates that unlock rights like joint tenancy and hospital visitation; many couples pair that local document with a legal ceremony in their home country so the status travels everywhere. Finally, plenty of pairs handle all legalities at home and come to Japan purely for a symbolic ceremony, whether that means a Shinto blessing, mountaintop vows or neon-rooftop promises.

**Paperwork you need to carry**

For any fully legal route each partner brings a passport with a photocopy, a Certificate of No Impediment (sometimes called a single-status affidavit) that is less than three months old and - even if the ward office says it is optional - a birth certificate because requirements vary. Every non-Japanese document must be translated into Japanese, but self-translation is fine if each page is signed and dated. Two adult witnesses aged twenty or over must appear with ID; they can be friends or even willing strangers queued behind you. If one partner is Japanese the fresh koseki tohon is compulsory. Scanning everything to cloud storage before the flight means a lost suitcase cannot ruin the day.

**Filling out the kon’in todoke**

Download the bilingual PDF, print it and fill it out over hotel coffee instead of hunching at the public desk. Names belong in block capitals with a neat katakana version underneath. Remember that Japanese forms list the surname first, then the given name, so double-check every box before you commit ink to paper.

**What to expect at the counter**

On filing day head to the family-register window marked koseki-ka, hand over passports, translations, witness IDs and the completed form, then wait while the clerk flips through the bundle. If everything is correct the approval stamp usually lands within ten to thirty minutes. Certified copies of your Japanese marriage certificate cost only loose change, so it is smart to buy at least two. Before leaving ask for the document labelled Certificate of Acceptance of Notification of Marriage because banks, immigration offices and name-change authorities back home care more about that plain sheet than the decorative parchment you will frame later. By the time you step outside for celebratory ramen you are legally married.

**Making the certificate portable**

With the certificate in hand the follow-up is straightforward. Translate at least one certified copy back into English if your home country requires it. Legalise another copy with an apostille at your embassy in Tokyo - most embassies stamp documents the same day if you arrive early - or hire a courier service while you honeymoon elsewhere. Once home lodge the apostilled certificate with local authorities so the marriage is recognised everywhere from immigration desks to tax offices.

**A sensible timeline**

Four months before departure order the Certificate of No Impediment and check embassy opening hours so you do not arrive during a public holiday. Two months out finish translations, download the kon’in todoke and line up witnesses. One month before the trip print everything twice and confirm nothing has expired. During the week of filing scout photo locations and make sure the city hall is not closing for a local festival - Golden Week from 29 April to 5 May shuts many offices and surprises a lot of couples. On the day itself half an hour at the counter is normally all it takes.

**Real-world costs in 2025**

Submitting the kon’in todoke is free. Two certified copies cost about seven hundred yen in total. An apostille at the UK embassy sits just over seven thousand yen. A traditional Shinto blessing with kimono rental averages around one hundred thousand yen, while a photo permit for a well-known garden hovers near ten thousand yen. Even after adding flights many couples still spend less than they would on a registry-office ceremony and restaurant reception back home.

**Picking the right season**

Late March to early April delivers the famous cherry blossoms but also packed trains and dawn photo shoots. May and early June bring lush greenery, moderate prices and only the first hints of rainy season toward the end of June. Mid-October through late November lights up with red maples and comfortable temperatures, though locals love autumn too so venues book quickly. December to February offers crystal skies and snow-capped Fuji views but very short daylight, so hand-warmers and early ceremony slots become essential.

**Practical hacks from lived experience**

Print two sets of every document because public copiers accept only ten-yen coins and jam at the worst moment. Buy clear bubble umbrellas at Daiso for three hundred yen so drizzle cannot ruin photos. Slip chemical heat packs into kimono obi or suit pockets for winter shoots. Keep a small roll of double-sided kimono tape handy; it tames everything from flyaway lapels to bouquet ribbons.

That is the full process as of August 2025. If anything feels unclear or you learn a ward office has changed a rule, please comment so everyone stays up-to-date. Good luck planning your Japanese adventure and happy eloping.",5,1754571325.0,Eloping,1,1.0,False

 ## Key Features Analysis

The effectiveness of an interior car cleaner hinges on several key features, including its cleaning power, surface compatibility, ease of use, and protective properties. Understanding these features is essential for selecting the right product to meet your specific needs.

**Cleaning Power:** The ability of a cleaner to effectively remove dirt, grime, stains, and odors is paramount.

A powerful interior car cleaner should be capable of tackling a wide range of messes, from everyday dust and fingerprints to stubborn stains like coffee spills and grease. The effectiveness of a cleaner often depends on its formulation, including the type and concentration of surfactants and solvents it contains. High-quality cleaners will quickly dissolve and lift away contaminants without leaving behind a sticky residue.

**Surface Compatibility:** A good interior car cleaner should be safe to use on a variety of surfaces commonly found in car interiors, such as vinyl, plastic, leather, fabric, and carpet.

The cleaner should not cause discoloration, cracking, or other damage to these surfaces. It is important to choose a cleaner that is specifically formulated for the types of materials found in your car's interior. Some cleaners are designed for universal use, while others are tailored for specific surfaces like leather or upholstery. Always test the cleaner on an inconspicuous area before applying it to the entire surface.

**Ease of Use:** The cleaner should be easy to apply and remove, with minimal effort required to achieve satisfactory results.

Features like spray nozzles, applicator pads, and microfiber cloths can enhance the user experience. A cleaner that requires excessive scrubbing or leaves behind a difficult-to-remove residue can be frustrating to use. Look for cleaners that can be easily sprayed on, wiped off, and leave a clean, fresh finish.

**Protective Properties:** Many interior car cleaners offer added benefits beyond cleaning, such as UV protection, stain resistance, and conditioning.

UV protection helps prevent fading and cracking of interior surfaces caused by prolonged exposure to sunlight. Stain resistance creates a barrier that makes it easier to clean up spills and messes in the future. Conditioning agents help keep leather and vinyl surfaces supple and prevent them from drying out. These protective properties can help extend the life and maintain the appearance of your car's interior.

Key features of the best interior car cleaners include:

*   Effective stain removal
*   Safe for various interior surfaces
*   Easy application and removal
*   UV protection and conditioning
*   Low odor or pleasant scent

 ## Core Benefits

The right interior car cleaner can offer numerous benefits, from improving the appearance of your car's interior to protecting its value and enhancing your driving experience.

**Improved Interior Appearance:** A clean car interior not only looks better but also creates a more pleasant and comfortable driving environment.

By removing dirt, stains, and grime, an interior car cleaner can restore the original luster of your car's surfaces, making them look newer and more appealing. Regular cleaning can also prevent the buildup of dust and allergens, which can improve air quality inside the vehicle.

**Enhanced Resale Value:** Maintaining a clean and well-maintained interior can significantly increase your car's resale value.

Potential buyers are often impressed by a car that looks like it has been well cared for, and a clean interior is a key indicator of this. By using a quality interior car cleaner regularly, you can help preserve the condition of your car's interior and maximize its value when it's time to sell or trade it in.

**Health and Hygiene:** A clean car interior is a healthier environment for you and your passengers.

Dust, allergens, and bacteria can accumulate on interior surfaces, leading to respiratory problems and other health issues. An effective interior car cleaner can remove these contaminants, creating a cleaner, healthier space. Regularly cleaning your car's interior is especially important for people with allergies, asthma, or other respiratory conditions.

**Protection of Interior Surfaces:** Many interior car cleaners contain protectants that help shield surfaces from UV damage, fading, and cracking.

These protectants can extend the life of your car's interior and keep it looking its best for longer. UV protection is particularly important for dashboards and seats, which are often exposed to direct sunlight. Conditioning agents can also help prevent leather and vinyl surfaces from drying out and cracking.

 ## FAQs Section

**Can I use household cleaners on my car's interior?**

No, it's generally not recommended to use household cleaners on your car's interior. Household cleaners often contain harsh chemicals that can damage or discolor the delicate surfaces found in car interiors. These chemicals can strip away protective coatings, dry out leather, and leave behind a sticky residue. It's always best to use cleaners that are specifically formulated for automotive use.

**How often should I clean my car's interior?**

The frequency of cleaning depends on how often you use your car and the conditions it's exposed to. As a general rule, it's a good idea to wipe down interior surfaces with a damp cloth every week or two to remove dust and fingerprints. Deep cleaning, including vacuuming and using an interior car cleaner, should be done every month or two, or more often if you have pets or children.

**What's the best way to clean leather seats?**

To clean leather seats, start by vacuuming them to remove any loose dirt or debris. Then, apply a leather cleaner and conditioner specifically designed for automotive use. Gently massage the cleaner into the leather using a soft cloth, and then wipe away any excess with a clean, damp cloth. Finally, apply a leather conditioner to keep the leather supple and prevent it from drying out.

**Are all-purpose interior car cleaners safe for all surfaces?**

While many all-purpose interior car cleaners are designed to be safe for a variety of surfaces, it's always a good idea to test the cleaner on an inconspicuous area before applying it to the entire surface. This will help ensure that the cleaner doesn't cause any discoloration or damage. Pay close attention to delicate surfaces like suede, Alcantara, and certain types of leather, which may require specialized cleaning products.

\#saas #azure #ai #security #career

Hey, I’m Divin!

A while ago, I was helping a mate apply for jobs—and watched him drown in resume tweaks, endlessly trying to tailor his resume to vague job descriptions. He spent hours crafting cover letters without knowing if his experience even aligned with what the role needed. That’s when it hit me: there has to be a smarter, faster, more personalized way to do this.

I'm a cybersecurity engineer and indie developer based in Victoria, Australia. I love building products that help people, especially when those products leverage smart technology and a security-first mindset. Today, I want to share my journey building FirstImpressionAI—a SaaS product designed to make the job application process painless and effective through smart resume-to-job match analysis.

# FirstImpressionAI – What's the Vibe?

https://preview.redd.it/6h0e2y1r5ygf1.png?width=2700&format=png&auto=webp&s=ec26117bc0fb29d6a00e2c54a57bcadea925c198

FirstImpressionAI is an AI-powered application that lets users effortlessly create tailored, impactful cover letters and instantly analyzes how well their resumes align with specific job descriptions. What makes it unique is our smart resume-job match analysis, powered by GPT-4o. This feature became the heartbeat of the app.

https://preview.redd.it/6ohau8iu5ygf1.png?width=2648&format=png&auto=webp&s=62e466e803242b54426846422d8f0a9e277f0d7c

This isn’t just another ChatGPT wrapper. The smart matching became our secret sauce—giving users real, actionable insights they can't get anywhere else. It’s like having a career coach and hiring manager rolled into one AI experience.

More than the feature set, FirstImpressionAI embodies something I call **""Vibe Engineering.""**

# What is Vibe Engineering?

“Vibe Engineering” is more than a method—it’s a mindset. It's about building software where creativity, AI collaboration, and technical intuition guide every decision. From architecture to UI flow, from security to scalability, I let the vibe—and the data—lead.

This involved:

* 🧠 **Vibe Software Development:** I wasn’t just coding—I was collaborating with AI. I used GPT to help shape the UX and UI, refactor logic, and explore component structures that made the product feel right.
* ⚙️ **Vibe Infrastructure Engineering:** I co-designed a production-grade cloud architecture with AI's help—no shortcuts.
* 🔐 **Vibe Security Engineering:** With my cybersecurity background, security wasn’t an afterthought. I ran AI-assisted pentests, modeled threats across the app flow, and built security into the foundation.

https://preview.redd.it/04gib0ln5ygf1.png?width=1536&format=png&auto=webp&s=dda8a18d20143555ec846fceab27a8e36f65809d

# Why I Skipped MVPs and Built for Scale

Here’s my controversial take: building a scalable, production-ready product takes about the same time as building a “quick and dirty” MVP. The real difference is whether you plan smartly and build with the future in mind.

With Azure’s serverless infrastructure and a security-first mentality, I had:

* ✅ Auto-scaling baked in from day one
* ✅ Enterprise-grade security
* ✅ A clean, maintainable codebase
* ✅ Zero technical debt

Security and scale shouldn’t be afterthoughts—they should be your foundation.

# Tech Stack and Architecture – Built to Last

FirstImpressionAI is hosted entirely on Azure and designed to be production-grade from launch:

* **Azure Static Web App:** Global CDN + performant React frontend.
* **Azure Functions:** Serverless backend logic with GPT processing.
* **Azure Foundry:** Seamless GPT deployment, no DevOps headache.
* **Supabase:** Robust authentication and PostgreSQL database.
* **Stripe:** Easy, secure payments.

Here’s the simplified deployment:

    az staticwebapp create \
        --name FirstImpressionAI \
        --resource-group production-rg \
        --source https://github.com/
        --location ""Australia East"" \
        --branch main

# Security-First Mindset – From Day Zero

With my cybersecurity background, a ""security-first"" mentality was baked into every layer:

* 🔐 JWT-based authentication via Supabase
* ⚠️ API rate limiting at Azure Function level
* 🧹 Input sanitization + validation for all AI inputs
* 🛡️ Encrypted storage with automated backups
* 📉 AI-assisted vulnerability scans + threat modeling
* 📈 Real-time monitoring and alerting

This not only saved future rework but gave users immediate confidence.

# Growth Strategy – No Gimmicks, Just Sharing

My best marketing? Being real and building in public:

* 📹 YouTube walkthroughs of the smart match feature
* 📝 Blog posts about the architecture and vibe process
* 🤝 Active in dev forums, LinkedIn, and Reddit—sharing insights, not just links

It’s been organic but energizing. Turns out, when you solve a real pain with solid engineering, word spreads.

# Monetization – Clean and Honest

From day one:

* ✅ Free tier with 3 generations to feel the magic
* 💳 Paid tiers via Stripe for unlimited access and features

The conversion rates have been encouraging because the value is immediate.

# Future Enhancements – More Vibes Coming

* 📄 **ATS-Friendly Resumes** based on match analysis
* 📊 **Analytics Dashboards** to track your job fit trends
* 🤖 **Interview Prep AI** with custom question generators
* 🤝 **Recruiter Tools** and a 2-sided job marketplace

# Final Thoughts – Let’s Build the Future of Job Hunting

This project has been my creative playground, my technical dojo, and my passion in motion. I’d love to hear what you think—whether you're a job seeker, developer, or just curious about building with AI.

So I'm a relaxed guy who enjoys having deep conversations and having a good time. I'm a 6'5"" black guy based in London. Also, I can be open to a height difference and age although if you are like 40 it won't work so let’s be reasonable😭. 

In my 9-5 job, I'm working in tech as a data scientist/data engineer so I have the turtleneck. Unfortunately I can't beat the corporate allegations😂. I do enjoy working in London but I can see myself worling abroad one day for sure. The opportunity to experience new things appeals to me.

In my spare time, I love being active. I’m into football, hiking, gym, running, bouldering. It sounds like a lot but I find a way to live life in a wild way. I also love nature documentaries by David Attenborough for example💆🏽‍♂️. 

Right now, I’m looking for someone I can build a real connection with. I’m open to long distance if the energy feels right, but I’d love for it to eventually lead to something in person. This could be coffee dates, museum days, getting food together, or just wandering around the city.

The brace makes me feel so claustrophobic at night.  It's uncomfortable.  I can't sleep.  Last night I took some of the meds (that I was previously off) in a desperate attempt to knock myself out.  Only partially successful and still didn't sleep great.  

So, I am here humbly asking for all of your best tips and tricks for getting decent sleep!  🙏 

I was told yesterday I could sleep on my side with tons of pillows but I tried and that was even more uncomfortable.  I have an adjustable bed, so usually I'm elevating the feet all the way and elevating the head partway just for balance.

I typically run the cold therapy machine most of the night since it seems to help the knee be more comfortable in general.

I have a dark room, quiet, with white noise going (I love white noise for sleeping).  I'm not napping at all during the day.  No caffeine (just coffee first thing in the morning) or chocolate.

Last night I decided to try keeping my bed flat and just putting a few small pillows under the foot of the brace.  Ehhhhh no.  No better.

Should I try melatonin?  Hydroxyzine?  Sleep on the recliner couch where I'm sitting during the day?

My brace is at 60 degrees when it's unlocked, as of yesterday, but PT told me to keep it locked in extension at night.

I started at 240 lbs. One year later, I was 203 lbs. I didn’t follow a crash diet or some trendy program. I just stuck to intermittent fasting (5–9 PM eating window), trained hard, tracked my calories, and stayed consistent.

# Why Intermittent Fasting Worked for Me

Fasting until 5 PM helped me stop bingeing and mindless snacking. It limited how much I could eat just by default. I didn’t need willpower every hour. I just needed structure.

I wasn’t hungry in the mornings after the first week. Black coffee and water got me through. Once I hit the eating window, I focused on high-protein, whole-food meals that kept me full.

# Tracking Calories Made It Sustainable

I used a AI chat-based calorie tracking app to log everything I ate. Just typed what I ate like a text. Done in seconds. This helped me stick to the 2100-calorie target without burnout. I wasn’t guessing. I knew where I stood daily.

# Training: 6 Days a Week with Progressive Overload

I followed a Push Pull Legs routine, six days a week. No random workouts. I focused on progressive overload — lifting heavier or doing more reps every session.

I also used a workout tracking app to log sets and weights. It made progress easy to see. After lifting, I did 30 minutes of light cycling. Nothing crazy. Just steady cardio to stay moving.

# Results After a Year: 37 Pounds Lost, Muscle Gained

After 12 months, I was down 37 lbs. I looked leaner, stronger, and more athletic. My energy improved. My mindset improved. No shortcuts. No hacks.

# What Actually Worked:

* Ate only between 5 PM – 9 PM, every day
* Tracked 2100 calories/day with a chat-based calorie app
* Followed Push Pull Legs training, 6x/week
* Tracked every workout, pushed for progressive overload
* Did 30 mins light cardio post-lift
* Repeated this system for a full year

Fasting, calorie control, structured training — that’s it. I didn’t rely on motivation. I built a system I could repeat, and I stuck to it. Now it’s just how I live.",15,1754570484.0,intermittentfasting,19,0.86,False

If not, let me know. 

TL;DR I'm a SAHM to a toddler and keep shutting my husband's attempts for sex down and I dont know why when I want to have it.

I (30F) have been in a relationship with my husband (30M) for five years, married for almost 3 years. We have a 16mo daughter. I'm a SAHM and my husband owns a business. 

Our sex life was pretty hot and heavy in the beginning, then started to fizzle the longer we were together. After I got pregnant, sex was unappealing to me. I struggled with pretty intense morning sickness, then body aches and tiredness (I'm also anemic, so generally a tired person). During my whole 42 weeks of pregnancy, we had sex twice. I struggled a lot with intimacy and insecurity of my body as it changed. We were also first time parents with a lot of anxiety on how to survive with a newborn.

In hindsight, I feel like I was neglecting my husband emotionally. We were going through a rough patch of him working his winter job (which sucks but pays well) and me not working. The reason I left my job was because I was getting pretty far along in my pregnancy and I was uncomfortable with snow removal hours and work (I worked for a landscape company). 

It was a mutual decision that I would be a SAHM. I had some savings to rely on, but once my husband could work his own business in the no-snow months, we were financially comfortable. Childcare is expensive so we budgeted and planned. 

Our sex life continued being stagnant after the 6 week clearance. Think once every three months. I'm really struggling with being intimate with my husband. I dont even like him to see me naked or with no covering clothes. I struggled in the past with body dysmorphia, but this is just a different level. I've kept some of the weight after baby, about 25lbs, but my husband says I'm more beautiful than ever. 

 I take care of our kid, home, and pets. I feel like I'm living a groundhog day- 16 hours awake of the same thing. I can't financially contribute, but I try to do little things to show my husband that I care about him like making his lunch and coffee in the morning, leave notes in his lunchbox, make dinner for all of us so he can relax and spend time with our kid. It's super important to both of us to spend quality time with our child since we both grew up with divorced working parents. 

I know my husband wants sex but he would *never* ""beg"" or demand it. Every day he is very handsy and flirty, but I keep shutting him down for a variety of reasons, mostly being overstimulated from the day. I dont understand why I do this because I desperately want that intimacy again. He says he will be eagerly waiting when I am ready. 

How can I shut down my mom-mode brain and reignite our intimacy again? We dont go out much, but we are going to the Renaissance Faire this weekend, which we haven't done since before we got married and we're both really looking forward to it.

From the phone,you get your daily (or nightly) calls from Phone Guy (night 1-2) or Phone Pal (night 2-5).

Feeling tired?Drink a bit of coffee,and you' ll feel the energy into your body!When you' re tired,you move slowlier,see less and even have allucinations!For not talking about how dangerous is falling asleep...You can only drink 3 times per night,so be responsable!

Those faz-asses better leave you alone,'cause you also have a gun!(Better don' t tell them you have only 10 bullets).The weapon doesn' t damage the animatronics,but it stuns them and makes them stand back a bit!It' s particulary useful with the ones who come from the sewers,because they show their head before entering in the office.Shooting them,you make them fall to where they came from,so they won' t disturb you again (hopefully).You can also use it to keep you awake if you finished the coffee,but the shooting sounds attracts the animatronics!

Pay attention to the cieling,because some of those robot freaks like to crawl in the vents!
Unfortunately,those don' t have the same technology of the doors,so you have to block them in a more classic way.But there's a problem:animatronics have the bad habit to knock violently at the vent,and that block is pretty old,because after three times they knock,it breaks!In your drawer,you have lots of them,but it requires quite some time to build one!

Hello?Is anyone out there?I hope not,because if there is,they' re going to remain out there!The doors are the main way most of the animatronics use to sneak into your office,that' s why you can close them!Unfortunately,stuff like that costs energy,so try to block 'em only when you really need it,'mkay?

Fear of the dark?No worries!Next to the doors' button,there is another,who opens the lights in the hallyways near your room,so you can see what is coming after you!But anyways, they' re not infallible:if you don' t drink enough coffee, you' ll start getting hallucinations,and some of them will make the lights flicker...or even turn them off.

Yesterday at the grocery store, I saw something that really stuck with me. There was a teenage girl showing her father a yogurt she wanted, it was about $10. Instead of getting the one she actually wanted, he took something that was maybe $2 cheaper.

So I’m not sure if I’m just being petty or if I’m genuinely right to feel this way. I need some outside perspective because my close friends say I’m not wrong but I still feel weird about it.

There’s this friend. We’ve known each other since school and used to call each other best friends. But over time we grew apart mainly because she was toxic towards me. Her words would really get to me and I found myself feeling upset often because of her. So I eventually cut her off for a few years.

Recently we got back in touch and started talking again. Sharing reels gossiping and all that was funn. But whenever we fought it would get ugly. She’d say really hurtful things that stayed with me for a long time. I get that fights happen in friendships but hers always felt personal and left a lasting impact.

Anyway she recently moved to my city. When she first got here she didn’t ask any of her other friends for help. Just me. She stayed at my place for 3 to 4 days. I’m working and she’s a student now so I didn’t expect her to spend much but she didn’t even offer a single treat as a thank-you. If I were in her shoes I’d at least bring coffee or take the host out for a snack. My friends pointed out that her behavior wasn’t normal but I brushed it off.

During her stay she kept wearing my clothes every time we went out. I was excited on the first day to show her my collection which she’s always admired but then it became a routine. Day 2 day 3 again trying on and using my stuff like it was hers. I started feeling uncomfortable but didn’t say much because she was leaving soon.

She also used up a brand new Bath and Body Works body wash without asking and was using my Victoria’s Secret body lotion every day. Like hands legs the full body. These are things I personally save for special occasions. It felt like she didn’t respect that at all.

Now we both are busy and only meet once in a few weeks. She’s coming over again today and before even arriving she messaged saying “I’m not bringing anything. I’m going to use everything you have.” That really rubbed me the wrong way.

And this time she’s also bringing all her laundry to do at my place. Like loads of clothes for washing in my machine. I genuinely don’t know how to feel about that.

Before anyone says “Oh but you’re close friends it’s normal to help each other” here’s the thing. She doesn’t help me when I need her. A few weeks ago I was feeling really low and asked her to come over. She was literally in my area and still chose to go back to her hostel with some random excuse. So it feels one sided.

I was excited to go out with her today because I haven’t done anything social in a while but now all of this is making me feel used and resentful.

Am I overreacting? Or is this a valid reason to feel annoyed? I do believe friendships should have boundaries. Thoughts ?

1mjylwz,https://www.reddit.com/r/Rambling/comments/1mjylwz/i_remember_now/,I Remember Now,"When we first met, I thought she was smart. She seemed to be smart. She was really good at the internet .

We talked a lot about things, Hawaii, she had great ideas about doing things .

She promised to be my healer and play video games with me, we were going to play music together, draw comics together, she even said that we could watch YouTube tutorials on coloring together. Lots of things we were supposed to do together, we were going to have children, or maybe Foster children and teach them all how to play music. She plays piano, her mother was a piano teacher .

I was obsessed with her. She said the term was sapiosexual, meaning that you're attracted to someone because they're smart. 

I really did think she was smarter than me when we met, she was doing things with her phone, doing things on the internet that I'd never seen before. 

But as time went on, it was obvious that her lack of experience in the real world was costing her some points on the marry me for life scale. She just had zero experience in the real world and was very obstinate about it. She still wanted to do try to do things that she didn't have any experience at, she really sucked at them but insisted on doing them anyway, even though literally anybody on earth could have done it in a fraction of the time if she had left them .

But it's not the things that piss me off so much about her that I'm recollecting at the moment, I'm sitting here in my recliner, drinking coffee, thinking about how it was supposed to be. Because that's all we talked about, playing music, doing drugs, movies coming music, art, all the things that we wanted to do together .

We never did any of those things, I even set up the piano keyboard and got out the guitars and we played for a few minutes together and it was really fun, I mean it was really amazing. And we never did it again. 

It seems that no matter what I put in front of her, no matter how hard I tried, she was just intent on being unhappy and miserable all the time. No, I remember when I was suffering from depression, the symptoms of depression not the actual clinical affliction, I just happen to have something else that caused all things to feel that way. Anyway, that's exactly what it felt like, I didn't want to do anything that made other people happy because it wasn't making me happy. I don't know if I can explain that because I'm not a psychiatrist, but anything we try to do together she just somehow seemed to ruin it every time .

Sabotage. Right, I called her a sab it to her before. I have memory issues, so I can't remember half the shit that goes on, but I'm remembering now that we had all these things that we were going to do and we never did any of them and now I'm wondering why. 

Pretty strange, we never play the video games together even though she said that she would and I said it all up, she never touched it. Never played music together, even though I said it all up and she said that she would, we never did that either. Not seriously anyway, we just noodled around that one time and it never happened again. 

So I guess what I'm realizing is that she was just spending her entire life staring at her phone, watching these idiotic tick tock shorts and YouTube crap, just mindless crap .

So I guess the term safety of sexual is still applies to me, I learned something about myself, I like smart chicks I guess. But I don't think she qualifies, I think she was somehow pretending to be normal, but is actually a complete fucking dipshit and it just doesn't want to admit to it. 

I would have to admit that she shows real genius when it comes to just plain creative thinking, forward visionary thinking, she looks at things and figures them out and it's great, but when it comes down to execute, she's simply cannot understand chronological logistics for some reason .

For instance, here are some of the ideas that she has had that I absolutely love, but when it came time to try to execute on any of them, she sabotaged them every time. It's astonishing how brilliant she can be, then turn around and absolutely destroy things like a complete fucking retard for no reason. Just absolutely no reason at all, astonishing. Anyway, rambling rambling rambling, here are some of the genius ideas that she has had that I have been unable to execute, no matter how hard I try......

By school bus is cheap and turn them into flatbeds and sell them. Since school buses are not a hot item, they sell cheap, cut them down, sell the scrap, use the flatbed which are much more popular, or sell it, either way, that's a hell of a great idea. 

Building rental shacks on the lava flows in Hawaii. This is a great idea, another one that will never get executed for the same reasons as before, she just can't do anything in real life and actually sabotages anything I try to do in real life, so this would never happen anyway. 

Simply enough, buy houses, renovate them, rent them out, refinance them, and then repeat, this is a process called BRRR. You can just watch YouTube videos about it and it's actually pretty simple, that was the plan and we moved to Pennsylvania and it all fell apart because she's batshit crazy. I'll skip the details, but it has been an excruciating amount of wasted time, energy and money driving around looking at houses, doing all kinds of stupid shit when I should have been doing literally anything else. Fucking retard idiot stupid bitch. 

Sexy landscaping service. This is hysterically funny and brilliant at the same time, if you had a 5 second YouTube clip of hot chicks mowing your yard, your phone will bring off the hook and that's not even a joke. This is the smartest thing I've ever heard of. Yes, I want to see my old ladies thinking around in the yard half naked, sweating like a pig. I bet people will pay a lot of money to see that, that's a pretty sound business idea, yes . Someone probably already does it, now that I think about it.

* First aid kit in the linen closet
* Shampoo, conditioner, bodywash for shower.
* Welcome snack box in the room. A welcome note with QR code for internet connection
* Coffee and candy supplies in kitchen and full access to use all appliances. Emptied a rack in the fridge for the guests
* Fragrance free laundry detergent both for guest usage and for turnover preparation

I’m a 42 year old guy based in the midlands, just looking to build some real connections, whether that's casual conversation, shared interests, or friendships that grow slowly over time.

Life’s been a bit quiet and introspective lately, and while I appreciate my alone time, I do miss the feeling of really clicking with someone, the kind of conversation that flows naturally, whether it’s thoughtful, silly, or somewhere in between.

I'm into music, mental health awareness, meaningful chats, and finding the small joys in everyday life. If you're someone who values honesty, reflection, and a slower pace when getting to know people, we might get along.

Not necessarily looking for anything specific, just open to seeing where a connection goes. Whether that’s grabbing a coffee someday, talking about life, or exchanging messages now and then, I’m happy to start small.
