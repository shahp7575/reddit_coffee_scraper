It was in my earbuds for grocery shopping and then cleaning out my side of the garage to be able to get my car in before it snows. 

I about finished up right during the start of ""Dancin' in the Streets"", so I was cleaning myself up and making coffee, paying closer attention to the music. 

I've probably had this thought cross my mind before, but never got around to writing it down. 

**I apologize if this question has been asked a million times already.**

-

So right at 5:15 (Betty Board I'm pretty sure) Jerry's tone changes from the ""basic down sweep"" of the envelope filter to SOMETHING ELSE, which is then his tone for pretty much his whole solo and the jam. 

**What kind of effect did Jerry switch on at that 5:15 mark?** 

Could it be the Phasor?

Could it be a switch on the Mu-tron itself, changing from down to band-pass?

Could it be a switch to a different pickup (or set of pickups)? 

As the jam move on he gets a little louder and the effect I'm trying to find isn't as present. 

But from 5:15 to around 7:00 his down sweep envelope is modified into this feathery, soft-top, gorgeous thing that I cannot for the life of me come anywhere close to emulating. 

But I love it!

Thanks anyone who has any idea or even blind stabs in the dark on this one...

Plot 1: The FMC is being driven to a private university after receiving admittance in the mail. While she is checking in, she runs into a guy carrying a large stack of books and she helps him pick them up. He makes a comment about how fate brought them together and they should get coffee sometime. When she is walking away, the guy notices how strong her aura is and tells his roommates about the new girl on campus. I'm pretty sure she has no idea she is at a supernatural university, and she won't find out until her mates reveal themselves and tell her their supernatural types.

  
Plot 2: The FMC wakes up in one of her guy friends dorm rooms after being attacked, and the guy and his friends/roommates tell her that they are all supernatural and she is their mate. The thing I remember most about this scene was that one of her mates was a bear shifter and while she was freaking out about the new information, he laid down so she can pet him and one of the other guys in the room commented about how it was unfair. Another one of her mates heals her injuries and the last one refuses to show her his power.

I am a Single Mom. 31 and extremely depressed like never before.
My almost 2 year old son is a crybaby. He's crying and whining the whole day. My Partner left me in the middle of my pregnancy. I became homeless. Noone was there for me. I was such a beautiful blonde goddess and since I gave birth I turned into this ugly sagged face woman....

I've been depressed my whole life. Here and then but these years....
I feel like I am in HELL and my cute babyson is the monster that is taking my whole energy and gives almost nothing back except wrinkles thirst and hunger.

I haven't made love since my partner left me. And this was so important to me but I just can't go out or even try to trust someone after all what happened.

So.... please no comments like search for professional help. Just don't. I've tried and these people are not helpful. Most of them trap you and most people stay inside this ""mental help circle"" forever. 

I love my son but 95√∑ of the time is just trying to avoid him because my energy is already low. 
Coffee helps but I'd need at least 4 cups per day and I can't drink more than 2. Alcohol helps in the evening but I shouldn't drink because of stress that's not how I want my life to be. 

Please, no Yoga. Really it is not my thing. I just want help and love and food. I need a real husband. Unfortunately the Babyfather prefers the streets and I am still heartbroken. But I'm leaving the country soon and he didn't do anything to make us stay so that story is over.

I'm really sad. Crying every day. I'm bringing my son to child care for a few hours per day and during this time I'm cleaning and cooking and all the hours of work at home just to fetch this little endless power human and start all over again like a never ending circle of stress.

I hate being a mom. A single mom and I hope that I'm gonna just die in my sleep and that all what went through was just a nightmare. I want to wake up in heaven be kissed from my son. There in heaven he's calm cozy cute cool collected. A gentleman. And I am just relaxing and listening to the waves and enjoy the rays of sunshine. 

Sometimes it gets so sad and difficult that I am thinking of giving my son to his rich grandmother and just end my life. It's better to have a dead mother that a tortured one.

There's no solution
The only way is to spend as less time as possible with him until he gets ""easier"". And if he doesn't then I'll send him away. My life shouldn't be destroyed by someone that has obviously the DNA of someone that would leave his pregnant girlfriend alone in hell. 

The truth is bitter.

1. **Is it healthy to not have any sex/masturbate at all with PD?** I still get the occasional morning wood and get worried that symptoms might worsen if I don't release or stimulate my penis at all in 3 months. Could abstaining make the plaque build-up worse potentially? Is there a healthy regiment or methodology (using traction device/vacuums) that can provide benefit and/or release?
2. **Are cold showers / ice-plunges bad for PD?** I usually take cold showers for health purposes and take ice baths after weightlifting, I read in one of the stickies that heat therapy has shown some promise, could the opposite do harm?
3. **What foods/drinks are worth staying away from?** I noticed coffee being a stimulant might be harmful, is alcohol shown to be harmful? Are there any particular foods/drinks I should stay away from?
4. **Are there any remedies/supplements that are shown to be beneficial in the early stages of PD?** I've seen lots of discussions around OTC supplements and ointments on this subreddit, I've started taking some vitamin E and looked into creams but feel wary given the discourse around these being primarily ineffective. Is there any form of treatments or methods that people have found success with in the early stages of PD? I've seen that Cialis is typically prescribed, should I get some off the street and start taking it before I can get a prescription from my Urologist? 
5. **Any physical activities or garments I should avoid?** I bike a lot, wear boxer briefs/tighter underwear, and exercise daily doing lots of different things. Is there any particular activity or sport I should avoid? Is it better to ""free-ball"" and let my crotch area breath more at night vs. wearing boxer briefs? I've always had a slight downward bend in my penis, now that PD is creeping into my life I'm worried the restrictive clothes might exacerbate the bend. 

I think that's all I have at the top of my head right now, if there's anything else people would recommend, I'd appreciate any advice/tips from y'all üíô",1,1734112867.0,PeyroniesSupport,0,1.0,False

Short version: I‚Äôve been with my SD for close to a year now and I still adore him. He‚Äôs been out of town for weeks and won‚Äôt be back til after Christmas, though. We still message every day, but I‚Äôm a little short on cash so I thought I‚Äôd explore the idea of maybe meeting another guy.

My SD knows about this effort - and he‚Äôs been open from the very beginning about being OK with the idea. He‚Äôs supportive - but he has surprised me by being just a little touchy about it.  I guess he‚Äôs OK but not *really* ok with the idea. We talk about it a lot and I hope I‚Äôm not screwing things up.

Anyway‚Ä¶I met three guys for coffee. Two were awful - one lying about being married (come on‚Ä¶why lie?) and the other having no intention of providing for me. A year ago, I might have blindly fallen into bed with these guys, but I think I‚Äôm wiser now. 

Third guy is a hit. He‚Äôs nice, he‚Äôs generous, I enjoy my time with him, and in bed he‚Äôs quick & simple. I visit him a couple of times a week for a quick play time and if the timing works, he buys me dinner (on top of the allowance). He says he‚Äôs delighted with me and it‚Äôs good for me - but time with him isn‚Äôt like time with ‚Äúmy SD‚Äù. I guess I proved to myself that I won‚Äôt just fall in love with any random older guy. lol. 

I‚Äôve learned so much about myself - or my sexuality I guess - that I can guide him to get me off, or just enjoy the experience without the O for me. I feel in control! My confidence is so much higher!

New Year‚Äôs might be interesting if they are both in town. Anyone ever juggle two SDs at the same time? 

Another change I‚Äôm working on:
I stopped smoking weed! 

It made such a difference for my SD that I thought I‚Äôd do it, too. One week clean so far and I‚Äôm just hoping my sleep schedule goes back to normal. I‚Äôm not sure what it‚Äôs doing to my sex drive, though‚Ä¶let‚Äôs see if that straightens out because I‚Äôm all over the map now.

I‚Äôm thinking about everything I‚Äôve experienced and learned over the past year and how it‚Äôs been such a growth year for me. There‚Äôs a ‚Äúyear in review‚Äù post in my future, I think.

Rules of thumb and online calculators give much higher budgets than my own common sense does, so I‚Äôm trying to figure out if I‚Äôm just being overly cautious or if those rules don‚Äôt apply. 

Financial background: The attached Sankey is for all of 2023 to get an idea of monthly budget. I try to keep expenses and rent low and am happy with how much I saved. At the highest, I was paying $2k/mo for rent, and that was not too bad in terms of affordability. I think I could handle up to a $2.5k/mo housing payment without reducing retirement contributions and still generating acceptable post tax savings (I‚Äôd be willing to lower post tax savings by $10-20k for a home since that‚Äôs what most of that money is for right now anyway).

Current savings are in good shape: $130k in 401k, $45k in Roth IRA, $15k in HSA, $20k in HYSA (6 month EF), and $280k in post tax brokerage. I‚Äôd use as much as $200k of the brokerage for a down payment, with the rest kept for taxes, closing costs, early maintenance, other life expenses, etc. 

Rules of thumb say I should be looking at homes around $650k based on income (3 * ~$150k). Sounds lovely, right? But when I look at Zillow, even a $500k home feels way too expensive. With *40%* down(!), the monthly cost is often $3k+ according to Zestimate. Which seems like too much for me, even just $2500 would be 40% of my take home. And $500k doesn‚Äôt get much in my area.

I don‚Äôt get how anyone with my income could afford a $650k place, or even close to it. Am I just limiting my options by being too ambitious with savings? Should I worry less about post-tax savings, reduce retirement, etc? Or is 3x income suggestion just out of date/bad advice?",7,1734112052.0,MiddleClassFinance,13,0.82,False

\*\*\*This is a long one so buckle up\*\*\*

So, this all started with my sister filing for divorce in June. Her husband made substantially more than her and wanted to fight alimony payments, so I put a retainer in with a lawyer for my sister.

They had a trip scheduled to go to Germany that he made her save up for and of course when it was time to go she didn‚Äôt want to go so she asked if I would go with her. I dropped everything and with a three week notice I put in for vacation. Instead of using everything she saved up for I told her I would cover my expenses.

The¬†trip was going SO WELL until the night before our flight. The¬†airport was an hour away and we agreed to leave at 0700 which was 5 hours before boarding (1200 for those of you who don‚Äôt feel like mathing). About 15 minutes later she told me she wanted to leave at 0600 instead and I told her no, we agreed on 0700 and 4 hours (even to get through customs) was plenty of time.

Back to leaving: I told her no and she got pissy. She persisted and I dickishly said ‚ÄúIf you want to leave earlier, feel free to take public transport or schedule a taxi (Uber has the preschedule and it was a good 12 hours before 0600). I admit that I had a bit of an attitude, but with the constant back and forth I ended it with that.

Somewhere between 0550 and 0559 rolls around (I had my alarm set for 0600) I wake up to all the lights being turned on. Thinking I missed my alarm I hop up without checking the time and start grabbing last minute items and we are out the door by what is actually 0630. We got downstairs and I checked my watch, seeing what had happened I called her an asshole and walked to the bakery next door for food and coffee. Now, I had a red bull and a pastry I had planned on consuming on the road to the airport, but I was pissed. Due to the line and how long it took to get food we actually didn‚Äôt get on the road until 0715.

I found a petrol station close to the airport the night before to refill the tank and hop on the Autobahn like we had many times that week. With those multiple times, I drove that morning just like I had all week and hauled ass where there was no speed limit but made sure to slow down where there were posted limits.

Upon arriving for gas, I asked her to clean the trash out while I went in to prepay (not knowing it was something I didn‚Äôt have to do in Germany). I got back and started filling the tank and went to grab my phone out of the cup holder. I noticed she cleaned the trash out of her side, but not mine. I (honestly) politely asked her if she could get mine as well as I went in to pay. I came out ready to hit the road and noticed there was still trash‚Ä¶ I told her this is only slowing us down. Apparently, I rolled my eyes as I took the rest of the trash to the bin.

Arriving at the rental car return (Now 0815 ish) she got out of the car damned near before I had it in park, tried to open the back door (it was still locked), proceeded to vigorously yank the handle 3 or 4 times until I finally got it unlocked, and took her suitcase out. I got out and asked her with a slightly raised voice what her problem was to which she screamed, ‚Äúyou know what my f\*\*\*ing problem is, I‚Äôm going to the gate‚Äù. I told her very calmly ‚Äújust go then‚Äù. I point out that I said it calmly just because I knew that would piss her off even more.

Fuck this is taking a lot, and it isn‚Äôt even the only reason family get together was canceled. Fast forward through more of her yelling, cussing, and having a hissy fit as we get through customs and end up sitting at the gate an hour before boarding and come to find out she blamed everything on her period.

TLDR; Sister got divorced, I went on an international trip in place of her soon to be ex-husband, she cussed me out multiple times in a foreign airport and wouldn‚Äôt speak to me for over a month and eventually blamed it on her period, but never actually apologized.

¬†

Okay, part 2

In the midst of the divorce proceedings my new girlfriend (4 months at that point and before the Germany trip) opened her rent home to my sister and only charged her rent that would cover the cost of her mortgage. Now, my sister had many options to stay, but nothing in the town she worked at so it's not like paying rent was her only option.

¬†

Here is a conversation between my \[ME\] my sister (Sis) and my girlfriend (GF) after initiating a group chat in text because with the Germany thing and my sister having an attitude to my GF for some unbeknownst reason to anyone

Sis:

Here's my problem with \[GF\]:

I don't appreciate how you repeatedly alluded to me not putting the signed lease in your new mailbox. I don't just say I did something and not do it.

I find you to be a bit too controlling and frankly inconsiderate my time (e.g., on various occasions you said you would come by for X and it never happened).

I didn't appreciate that you wanted to include damages in a new lease after all of my things were moved in. I understand you want to protect your assets but how would I have been able to legally protect myself? There were so many existing holes and damages that you could have easily pinned on me if you wanted to.

Also, you told my mom that you've been trying to talk to me but you clearly haven't.

\*\*\* this\^ was a lie, my mom told me this never happened\*\*\*



And \[ME\]: you've known me my entire life. You know that I don't just say I did something and not do it. It upsets me that you didn't have my back on the lease thing. Maybe you did and I didn't know it. But \[GF\] kept insinuating that I didn't give her the lease.‚Äù

¬†

GF:

There is a misconception that I changed the cost of rent. That's not true at all. I agreed to $1200 through the end of the year (which barely covered my mortgage) and even said if you needed to extend that rate we could talk about it. I let you stay over a month for free, and paid the utilities during that time. I know how hard it is to go through a divorce and was genuinely happy to help. Yes, there was some trouble getting together to sign the lease. I work 60+ hours a week, it definitely affects my personal life. I'm also adjusting to my role as landlord. I was upfront with you about there being growing pains for me there.‚Äù

¬†

GF:

If you were worried about me adding damages to the lease, we could have talked through updating the language together.¬† I was so confused when I heard information from \[ME\] or your mom that you were not communicating with me directly. As soon as \[ME\] mentioned there was tension, I did what I could to correct it. I care about \[ME\] very much and admire the relationships he has with family (especially you, \[Mom\]). I never want to be the reason things feel strained.  
  
Yes, I suggested you may have put the signed lease in the wrong mailbox bc my outdoor cameras never caught movement at my mailbox and I never found the signed document. That lease was through December, I'm unclear why you would have signed it if you planned to move out in November?

¬†

Sis: No response

¬†

GF:

I understand not everyone agrees with how the situation was handled. I do think I was incredibly generous in the situation and wish I had been given a little more grace while learning to navigate owning rental property. I was actually originally updating the lease to reflect a November end date so Kristen wouldn't be breaking a lease by leaving early and not paying for the final month. I did start to feel nervous what might happen given the sudden shift in attitude so I wanted language to protect myself. I'd like to think everything I've said and done up to this point indicates a willingness to work together. \[Sis\], if you had talked to me more directly we could have made adjustments so everyone was comfortable. I thought it was so strange to only be hearing from \[Mom\]. I also would have come for a walk through if I had been given a little more notice.

\*\*Sister ran to mommy\*\*

Sis: There's definitely been some misconstructions about the price of rent and the lack of communication. I wasn't aware that the price was negotiable and $1,200 was barely affordable for me to begin with. I figured since you didn't get the lease and had talked about repairing the place then there would be no harm in leaving a month early.

As for communication, I was under the impression that you and mom had been communicating about the cleaning and returning the key and didn't see the need to be involved if things were already established. Aside from that, I've communicated with you about the utilities being scheduled to be turned on and off, as well as when the fence got torn down from the wind.

Over the week I've thought a lot about this... \[GF\] I don't think you're so much ""the problem"". From what I've been told, you've tried and want to be included in things with the family and I want that too. \[Me\], you have a tendency to push your family away when you're in relationships and that's what upsets me the most out of all of this. I do think \[GF\] provides that for you. And I respect that. But if it comes at the expense of you pulling away from family again then I don't support that one bit.

\*\*\*Thinking this was all settled\*\*\*

I got a random text from my sister a couple days ago.

Sis: ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre the one putting a wedge between us.‚Äù

\*\*\*WTF?!?\*\*\*

Me: I thought this was put to bed.

Sis: You're in \[Sis and GF‚Äôs town\] all of the time and don't ask to hang out or even say hi, you've both been invited to \[Family friend‚Äôs\] a few times and you don't go and have cancelled at least once. I know other family members have examples too and would love for them to chime in on this if you want their names‚Äù

Me:

‚ÄúHow about you tell everyone to keep my f\*cking name out of their mouths‚Äù

Sis:

\*\*\*Throws my attempt at suicide 4 years ago in my face saying she just wants the best for me followed by she didn‚Äôt want ‚Äúsome girl‚Äù to be the reason \[family\] loses me\*\*\*

Me: You need to contact the lawyer and tell them you're taking over payments for them and have them return whatever is left on the retainer I paid

\*\*\*Then I blocked her\*\*\*

¬†

The following day my mom sent this to the whole family:

‚ÄúDue to the circumstances, Christmas is canceled. If you already got the gifts for your secret santa, you can return them or go ahead and give it to your person. Sorry for the inconvenience.‚Äù

¬†

TLDR: My sister moved into my girlfriend's rental home under favorable terms but later clashed with her over lease misunderstandings, communication breakdowns, and perceptions of control. I tried to mediate, but the situation escalated when my sister brought other family members into the conflict. After an attempt to address grievances, my sister accused me of distancing myself from family and used my past mental health struggles against me, prompting you to cut ties. The fallout led my mom to cancel Christmas for the whole family.

¬†

Multiple family members are upset at me and are saying I‚Äôm the problem. So, AITAH?

We have reached our destination and you may unbuckle your seatbelts.

Thanks for sticking it out and reading through this.¬†



ChatGPT summary:

This all started when my sister filed for divorce in June. Her husband, who earned significantly more than her, wanted to avoid paying alimony. To help her, I paid for a lawyer retainer.

They had a trip to Germany planned, which her husband made her save up for. When the time came, she didn‚Äôt want to go, so she asked if I‚Äôd go with her instead. I agreed, dropped everything, and took vacation on short notice. I even offered to cover my own expenses so she could keep her savings.

The trip was going well‚Äîuntil the night before our flight home.

We agreed to leave at 7:00 AM for the airport (an hour away) to catch a 12:00 PM flight. Suddenly, she wanted to leave at 6:00 AM. I told her no. Four hours was more than enough time to get through customs. She kept insisting, so I snapped, saying, ‚ÄúIf you want to leave earlier, take public transport or schedule a taxi.‚Äù I admit I was annoyed.

At around 5:50 AM, she turned on all the lights to wake me up, despite my alarm being set for 6:00 AM. Thinking I overslept, I rushed to get ready, only to realize we left at 6:30 AM‚Äîthe time she originally wanted. Annoyed, I called her an asshole and walked to a bakery next door for food. We didn‚Äôt leave until 7:15 AM because of this.

On the way, I drove as I had all week‚Äîfast where there was no speed limit and careful in speed zones. At a gas station near the airport, I asked her to clean the trash from her side of the car while I pre-paid for gas. She only cleaned her side, so I politely asked her to get mine, too. She didn‚Äôt. Frustrated, I rolled my eyes and threw the trash away myself, which apparently upset her.

When we arrived at the rental car return (8:15 AM), she jumped out of the car before I‚Äôd even parked and angrily yanked at the locked back door to grab her suitcase. I asked what her problem was, and she screamed, ‚ÄúYou know what my f***ing problem is!‚Äù before storming off.

We got through customs and were sitting at the gate an hour before boarding. She blamed everything on her period but never apologized.

TL;DR for Part 1:

My sister and I went on an international trip. On the way home, she woke me up early, caused delays, and yelled at me multiple times. She blamed it all on her period but didn‚Äôt apologize.

Part 2: The House Drama

During her divorce, my girlfriend of 4 months offered my sister a rental home at a favorable rate‚Äîjust enough to cover the mortgage. My sister had other housing options but chose this because it was close to her work.

Things went south. Miscommunications about the lease and my sister‚Äôs attitude toward my girlfriend created tension. At one point, my sister claimed my girlfriend accused her of not turning in the lease and called her ‚Äúcontrolling.‚Äù My girlfriend defended herself in a group chat, clarifying that:
	1.	She let my sister live rent-free for over a month and paid utilities.
	2.	She had trouble coordinating lease signings due to her 60+ hour workweeks.
	3.	She wasn‚Äôt trying to change the lease terms unfairly‚Äîjust protect her property.

My sister then accused me of not defending her. Eventually, she left the house a month early, without proper notice, and involved my mom in the dispute.

The Final Blow

After I thought everything was resolved, my sister texted me out of the blue, accusing me of driving a wedge between us because I didn‚Äôt visit her or attend family events. I told her to drop it. She responded by bringing up my suicide attempt from 4 years ago, saying she didn‚Äôt want my girlfriend to ‚Äúbe the reason the family loses me.‚Äù

That was my breaking point. I told her to take over her legal fees and blocked her.

The next day, my mom sent a message to the family:
‚ÄúDue to the circumstances, Christmas is canceled. If you already got your Secret Santa gifts, you can return them or give them to your person. Sorry for the inconvenience.‚Äù

TL;DR for Part 2:
My sister clashed with my girlfriend over rental misunderstandings, dragged me into the conflict, and eventually accused me of distancing myself from family. She threw my mental health struggles in my face, leading me to block her. My mom canceled Christmas as a result.

1hdhrdb,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_tipstor/comments/1hdhrdb/hungarian_walnut_cookies_wont_judge_your/,‚ÄúHungarian Walnut Cookies Won‚Äôt Judge Your Sweatpants‚Äù,"Don‚Äôt let the sophisticated ring of Hungarian Walnut Cookies fool you into thinking this is one of those desserts that requires a master‚Äôs degree in pastry arts or a life-altering pilgrimage to Budapest. Nope. These little beauties are the kind of cookies that make you look like you know what you‚Äôre doing in the kitchen, even when you‚Äôre winging it with flour in your hair and a timer you forgot to set. And the best part? They take just 30 minutes. Yes, my impatient friends, a mere half-hour stands between you and buttery, nutty bliss.

I have a complicated relationship with baking. On one hand, I love eating baked goods. On the other, the process often feels like a chemistry exam where every ingredient has to be measured to the gram, or the whole thing explodes in a puff of disappointment. So when I heard about these Hungarian Walnut Cookies ‚Äî quick, easy, and minimal room for disaster ‚Äî I was intrigued. Could it be true? Could I actually whip up something ‚Äúclassic‚Äù and ‚Äúutterly delicious‚Äù without losing my sanity or setting off the smoke alarm?

The walnuts are like the unassuming friend in a rom-com who suddenly gets a makeover and becomes the love interest. Usually relegated to salads or lurking in the back of your pantry, walnuts take center stage in these cookies. Ground up and mixed with sugar and a hint of spice, they transform into a filling so good it deserves its own spin-off.

The cookie dough itself? It‚Äôs as tasty and tender as a love letter written by butter. You roll it out, cut it into little circles or squares, slap some walnut magic in the center, and fold it over like you‚Äôre tucking it in for bed. It‚Äôs ridiculously simple, which is good because my patience for dough-related precision is about as short as a commercial break.

These cookies are legitimately fast to make. None of this ‚Äú30 minutes of prep, plus three hours of chilling, plus 90 minutes of baking while you contemplate your life choices.‚Äù No, when these cookies say 30 minutes, they mean it. You can start with a vague craving for something sweet and nutty and, before your coffee even gets cold, have a tray of warm cookies ready to devour.

Let‚Äôs not forget their versatility. Are they perfect for last-minute gatherings? Absolutely. You know that moment when someone says, ‚ÄúI‚Äôll just swing by in 20 minutes,‚Äù and you realize you have nothing to serve except the questionable contents of your fridge? These cookies save the day. They‚Äôre also great for those moments when you‚Äôre alone on the couch, wearing sweatpants, and pretending that three cookies count as dinner. I‚Äôm not saying I‚Äôve done this recently, but I‚Äôm not¬†*not*¬†saying it either.

Now, about that ‚Äúgolden perfection‚Äù bit. Yes, the cookies bake up beautifully, but there is always the one rebel cookie that decides to burst open in the oven like it‚Äôs auditioning for a reality show. And you know what? That‚Äôs fine. Because even the ‚Äúugly‚Äù cookies taste amazing. Perfection is overrated. Besides, anyone who criticizes the aesthetics of your cookies doesn‚Äôt deserve them in the first place.

The one thing to remember is don‚Äôt get cocky. These cookies are easy, but that doesn‚Äôt mean you can throw caution to the wind and bake them on a whim while simultaneously texting your group chat and binge-watching your favorite show. Multitasking is how you end up with a tray of charred regrets. Stay focused. It‚Äôs only 30 minutes ‚Äî you can handle it.

In the end, Hungarian Walnut Cookies are everything they promise to be ‚Äî classic, quick, and utterly delicious. They‚Äôre the kind of dessert that makes you feel like you‚Äôve accomplished something impressive, even if all you really did was follow a simple recipe and not burn the house down. They‚Äôre buttery, nutty, sweet, and just a little bit posh‚Äî perfect for impressing guests, indulging yourself, or bribing someone into forgiving you for that thing you said during game night.

So, the next time you find yourself in need of a dessert that delivers big on flavor without requiring blood, sweat, and tears, give these cookies a try. They‚Äôll make you look like a culinary genius, even if the rest of your life is held together with duct tape and caffeine.

--------------------------------------------------------------------

Teeth whitening has become a popular option for those seeking brighter smiles. Many people have experienced significant transformations in their appearance after undergoing whitening treatments. The impact is often striking, boosting self-confidence and enhancing overall aesthetics. Let‚Äôs explore some real before and after results and what they mean for you.

One of the first things you notice in before and after images is the color difference. Teeth can range from yellowish or gray tones to a dazzling white. This change does wonders for the individual‚Äôs overall look. A bright smile can make you appear younger and more approachable. Here are some common observations seen in transformation photos:

- **Increased Brightness:** After treatment, most individuals notice a significant increase in the brightness of their teeth.
- **Even Color:** Many find that their teeth become more uniformly white, reducing stains and discoloration.
- **Enhanced Aesthetics:** A whiter smile often complements facial features, enhancing a person‚Äôs attractiveness.
- **Improved Self-Esteem:** Many people feel more confident showing their smiles post-treatment.

Different methods of teeth whitening yield different results. Professional whitening treatments, which are usually conducted at dental clinics, often show the most dramatic effects. These treatments utilize stronger bleaching agents that cannot be found in over-the-counter products. If you are considering professional whitening, prepare to be amazed by the immediate results. Many clients report significant changes in just one session.

Check The Details Here: https://prodentim.myofferdeals.com  
  
On the other hand, at-home whitening kits can also provide impressive results over time. These kits often contain lower concentrations of whitening agents, meaning the process takes longer, usually a few weeks. Regular users of these kits often share their before and after images showcasing a gradual change that leads to a smile they can be proud of. Here‚Äôs why at-home treatments appeal to many:

- **Cost-Effective:** At-home options tend to be less expensive than professional treatments.
- **Convenience:** You can use them whenever fits your schedule.
- **Control:** Many people appreciate the control they have over the duration and frequency of the treatments.

However, regardless of the whitening method, there are precautions you should take. Over-whitening can lead to tooth sensitivity or uneven results. Thus, it's essential to follow guidelines and consult with dental professionals. The ideal approach combines professional advice with personal care to achieve optimal results.

Check The Details Here: https://prodentim.myofferdeals.com  
  
Results from teeth whitening can vary based on several factors, including the individual‚Äôs dental health, the method used, and maintaining the whiteness post-treatment. Aftercare is crucial to sustaining your bright smile. Here are some tips to help keep your teeth white:

- **Regular Brushing:** Continue to brush your teeth at least twice a day with a whitening toothpaste.
- **Avoid Staining Foods:** Limit consumption of coffee, tea, red wine, and dark berries.
- **Regular Dental Check-ups:** Maintain regular visits to your dentist for cleanings and whitening touch-ups.

Seeing the transformations of those who have undergone teeth whitening often leaves a lasting impression. The before and after pictures showcase more than just color changes; they highlight the emotional uplift and newfound confidence that comes with a brighter smile. People often share their stories online, providing inspiration to those considering whitening treatments.

Check The Details Here: https://prodentim.myofferdeals.com  
  
The impact of teeth whitening is profound. Whether you choose professional treatments or at-home kits, the results can significantly improve your smile while giving you the confidence to showcase it every day. If you're on your journey towards a whiter smile, remember that your path may be different from others' experiences. Keep your expectations realistic, and track your progress with your own before and after photos to celebrate the transformation.

Isn't it worth considering how a simple change could enhance your life? As you contemplate your decision, remember the power a beautiful smile holds‚Äîand embark on your teeth whitening journey with excitement and positivity.

Choosing the Right Teeth Whitening Method for Lasting Results
-------------------------------------------------------------

When it comes to achieving a brighter smile, there are various teeth whitening methods available that can provide lasting results. Understanding which method is right for you can make all the difference. Here‚Äôs a comprehensive guide to help you navigate through your options.

Check The Details Here: https://prodentim.myofferdeals.com  
  
### Understanding Teeth Whitening Options

Teeth whitening options vary widely in their effectiveness, convenience, and cost. The most popular methods include:

- **In-Office Treatments:** Performed by dental professionals, these treatments use powerful whitening agents to achieve significant results in a short amount of time.
- **At-Home Kits:** Dentists often provide custom-made trays and professional-grade whitening gel that you can use at home. Results are typically observed over several weeks.
- **Over-the-Counter Products:** These include strips, gels, and toothpaste available in stores. They are convenient but may take longer to show results.
- **Natural Remedies:** Options like baking soda or activated charcoal have gained popularity, but their effectiveness and safety can vary.

### Assess Your Needs

Start by evaluating your goals. Are you preparing for a special occasion or looking for a long-term solution? Understanding your needs will guide your choice. Remember that results can differ among individuals, and what works for one person may not work for another.

### Consult a Dental Professional

Before embarking on a whitening journey, it‚Äôs wise to consult your dentist. They can evaluate the health of your teeth and determine the most suitable option for you. Some key factors to discuss include:

Check The Details Here: https://prodentim.myofferdeals.com  
  
- **Tooth Sensitivity:** Some methods can cause discomfort for those with sensitive teeth. Your dentist can recommend alternatives.
- **Stains vs. Discoloration:** Understanding the source of discoloration will help in selecting the right treatment.
- **Current Dental Health:** If you have cavities or gum issues, address these before starting any whitening process.

### Evaluating the Methods

Once you‚Äôve assessed your needs, it‚Äôs time to evaluate available methods. Let‚Äôs look at the pros and cons of the top choices:

#### In-Office Treatments

These treatments offer immediate results, often lightening teeth by several shades in just one visit. However, they can be more expensive and may require multiple sessions for optimal results.

Check The Details Here: https://prodentim.myofferdeals.com  
  
#### At-Home Kits

Professional kits tend to be effective and tailored to your mouth, leading to gradual and satisfactory results. They do require discipline and patience as results take longer to appear.

#### Over-the-Counter Products

Convenient and easy to use, these options are budget-friendly. However, they may not offer the same results as professional treatments and tend to work more slowly.

Check The Details Here: https://prodentim.myofferdeals.com  
  
#### Natural Remedies

While appealing to some, natural remedies often lack scientific backing and may not produce visible results. Always proceed with caution and do your research.

### Maintaining Your Results

Once you‚Äôve achieved a whiter smile, maintaining those results is crucial. Here are some practical tips:

Check The Details Here: https://prodentim.myofferdeals.com  
  
- **Practice Good Oral Hygiene:** Brush at least twice a day and floss regularly to remove surface stains.
- **Avoid Staining Foods and Drinks:** Limit intake of coffee, red wine, and tobacco to protect your smile.
- **Use Whitening Toothpaste:** This can help prevent new stains from settling on your teeth.
- **Schedule Regular Dental Cleanings:** Professional cleanings can help keep your teeth looking their best.

Choosing the right teeth whitening method involves careful consideration of your individual needs and dental health. By consulting with a dental professional and evaluating your options, you can confidently select a treatment that will lead to a brighter, more confident smile.

### Conclusion

1hdh8mj,https://www.reddit.com/r/Epilepsy/comments/1hdh8mj/young_adult_who_developed_epilepsy_in_need_of/,"Young Adult who developed epilepsy, in need of some advice","Hello everyone, i recently got diagnosed with epilepsy, and need some advice, as this might be a really long post, feel free to ask questions in the comments if you don't have the patience to read all this.

So, i guess i should start from the beginning, i've been healthy my whole life, i was that strange little nerd that would never go anywhere without a video game, but on the other side, i was also that athletic kid with a nice face, but low self esteem, i started to play video games when i was 7, started to really enjoy sports when i became a teenager, and never had big issues other than depression, i think it started when i was about 15, i didn't really do anything about it, didn't get help, nor talked about it, because i didn't want to be a burden, or make people think i was weak, i wanted to be the guy who helps without being asked to, not the one to receive help.

Between puberty and 18 years old, id have some times where i'd have a sense of d√©j√† vu, didn't know what it was, so i kept living my life normally while managing to not let depression impact my life.

after that, i took care of my studies and moved out my parent's house to start a paid internship for two years. these two years were the worst i think, a huge lot of happy things happened during those two years, but depression did its magical work, made me struggle with relationships, awkwardness in social situations, anxiety, fear of the future, failure, i was not diagnosed yet, had passed out 2 or 3 times during those 2 years, but i still didn't think much of it, my life was starting to go down even though nothing terrible had happened, i was feeling bad every day, i couldn't take it anymore, i started to have a hard time getting out of bed in the morning, stopped doing any form of exercise, started to eat a LOT of junk food, coffee or energy drinks ( hopefully i didn't gain that much fat ) and the worst part, i failed my internship because i was too tired to get to my internship on time at least three days a week, i also failed my last year of studies because i couldn't concentrate on anything other than video games ( the only thing that would make me forget how sad i was, and enabled me to have that brilliant  state called ""being in the zone"" that i used to have while doing sports with my friends ) this would be the first time i actually failed at something important, i was always the kind of guy who could be good at everything if i put my mind to it, may it be studies, getting my driver's license ( and actually driving xD ) sports etc...

but this failure would mark a big change in my life, i stopped studying and started to work as an IT administrator, moved out to another city to be with my girlfriend, wishing i could get the experience i lacked, tried to move on, but once again, i got betrayed by my own body, had a seizure right beside my girlfriend, and so i was diagnosed with epilepsy.

The months after my diagnosis were actually pretty normal if i don't include the tiredness that i was still suffering from, depression, and the anxiety that was starting to develop, i would only have a seizure twice a year or so, started on keppra, and it was actually really effective, but this shitty drug would absolutely destroy my mood, i started to become irritable, aggressive, and really sensitive, had some fights with my girlfriend, but she understood what i was going through. until the day i almost hit her, stopped myself from hurting her, and broke down in tears. i was a really patient guy before that, not really affected by emotions, the kind of guy you would go to if you needed advice without taking emotions in account.

so after this i asked my doctor to change my medication, and it worked out for me, my mood came back to normal, but since then ( 3 months ), i had at least 4 or 5 seizures, i had two times when i actually had 3 seizures in a row without waking up ( stayed in hospital for almost 24 hours ).

my last seizure was last week, but i only had one, and woke up before my girlfriend finished calling an ambulance, so i'm hoping this means i'm starting to adjust to the medication, the issue is that now, i'm not allowed to drive, i have a harder time finding a job because of this, since 75% of IT jobs need you to be able to.

I've accepted my condition and told myself i would probably have epilepsy until i die, or until it kills me,

now for the questions here's what i'm wondering :

\- How do you guys deal with the nausea, tiredness, or other side effects ?

\- What do you tell your friends or family when it comes to helping in case you have a seizure?

\- How do you know you're going to a have a seizure, or what are your triggers?

\- if you didn't start your life with epilepsy, how did you adapt your lifestyle ( what changed ? )

\- if you had epilepsy for a long time, what advice could you give me that only a person with epilepsy could understand ?

i know this post sounds really sad, but don't worry, i have a great girlfriend, family and friends are there for me, and i live for them.

if you managed to read all of this, thank you for your time, and have a fantastic day :)",4,1734110500.0,Epilepsy,0,1.0,False

an old friend from work (50F) and I have been catching up recently. they have been explaining to me that one of our old team members (40F) has just accepted a senior role in the office, the same role as what my friend has been doing for almost 20 years. my old boss had originally said that the position was supposed to go to an external hire yet my friend advocated for the current team member to take the role. boss agreed to it after months of pushing and the two of them now have the same job. 

for context, both my friend and I have worked with this team member. our team was always small so we were forced to work together closely. the three of us were  friends and would do things like go out for dinner or coffee on weekends, and would always buy each other cards on our birthdays. I moved away and the two of them became a lot closer to the point where they were best friends.

after almost 3 years of waiting for the senior role to open up, newly promoted team member finally gets in thanks to my friend and now suddenly hates my friend. saying things over text like, don't think we're friends because we aren't. or, I don't want you to do any favours for me (after many nominations for awards were sent on her behalf by my friend). many other rude things were said but I won't go too far into it. boss is now berating my friend about doing too much to celebrate people's achievements and saying that the celebration held for team member's promotion was ""too special"" and that she shouldn't have gone so far out of her way. this coworker and I also used to talk but she hasn't said a word to me since a month ago.

I just saw this celebration pack and thought I'd buy this from the website , took a week to deliver in Mumbai, quiet expensive at ~800 something Rs for 250gsm. 

Notes : it's not all bitter and not at all acidic, very very mild coffee. The caffeine hits are good , but i genuinely found it hard to identify any particular notes. The website mentioned it was a mix of all the best beans in country. Was exepecting something out of the world notes. 

Help me improve ? 
I brewed this using a moka pot , I tend to grind this using standard home kitchen grinder, medium coarse, living with parents temp, they'll kill me if I put a coffee burr on the kitchen counter. 
I put aeropress filter paper and tend to boil slightly longer , i ""boil"" the coffee and then hold the moka pot under tap for fizz steam, just theatrics i enjoy then I have my cup of coffee. 

I didn't hate this , but I was honestly expecting something mind blowing here. Would love to have suggestions and feedback on other brewing methods , cold brew, chemex , filter coffee type?

I have a friend who I've known for years since we were in elementary school who I am going to visit here for the weekend. 

Throughout our friendship, there have been times where each of us has been interested in the other, and those haven't exactly matched up concurrently. At one point when I was the one interested, she kept us as friends for the reason of not wanting to risk the close friendship we had if things went further and ended up not working out. After she rejected me that last time, nothing between us changed and we've still been a relatively consistent part in each other's lives through college in very different places. We didn't ever talk super consistently with each other and have lived our own lives, but always tried to make time to see each other for coffee or a meal whenever we were both back home. 

We now are both out of college and have moved to different places that are a little over an hour by plane from each other. I was dating a girl here for months, and she had continued dating a guy she met in college until the both of us broke up with our partners around the same time. Since then, we've Facetimed and texted each other more frequently. 

Since our breakups, I took her up on an offer she'd made while she was still with her boyfriend to come visit her in the city, and booked a flight out to see her. Originally, the offer was to stay with her, but upon moving into her place she realized that probably wasn't going to work with the size of her space and having a roommate, so I've gotten myself a hotel room. 

I was under the impression this was a platonic visit between friends where we'd hang out and tour around but would be lying if I said I hadn't wondered if it might be intended to be more. I've described this situation to a couple of my female co-workers who were curious about my trip who made that wondering turn into some real consideration. They were under the impression this was a pretty clear-cut case of her being interested, and there being an opportunity to move beyond being just friends. 

I'm not quite the best at these sorts of things which is why I'm now outsourcing to the internet to fuel the fire. I'm happy to add context if people are curious about things I'm not considering!",1,1734109419.0,dating_advice,2,1.0,False

I recently got my hands on the AeroPress XL Coffee Press, and I've been eager to share my thoughts. This unique 3-in-1 coffee maker has quickly become a staple in my daily routine.

The AeroPress XL takes the best parts of French press, pour-over, and espresso brewing methods and combines them into one smart design. I was impressed by how it made smooth, rich coffee without any grit or bitterness. Plus, it can brew up to 20 ounces at once, which is perfect for sharing or enjoying a larger cup.

https://preview.redd.it/o9k1owrgdn6e1.jpg?width=591&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=2e9a635dbd83abce4ed42a5f6e64e1be2d141122

I found the brew-and-serve carafe to be a nice touch. It's made of clear Tritan, so I can see my coffee as it brews. Pouring from the carafe is easy and mess-free.

One thing I really like is how fast and simple it is to use. The micro-filter lets me use finer ground coffee, which speeds up brewing. Clean-up is a breeze too - just a quick rinse and I'm done.

For someone who travels a lot, the AeroPress XL is a game-changer. It's light, strong, and portable. I've taken it camping and on work trips, and it's always delivered great coffee.

# Bottom Line

If you want tasty, smooth coffee without fuss, the AeroPress XL is a solid choice. It's easy to use, quick to clean, and makes great coffee. 

# Captivating Aromas and Bold Flavors: The AeroPress XL Coffee Press

I was blown away by the AeroPress XL's ability to create rich, smooth coffee. This bigger version of the classic AeroPress lets me brew up to 20 ounces at once, perfect for sharing. I love how it combines French press, pour-over, and espresso methods into one easy-to-use device.

The XL's patented design uses pressure and micro-filtration to extract pure flavors without bitterness or grit. I get a full-bodied cup that tastes clean and delicious every time. It's so good, I don't even need to add cream.

Clean-up is a breeze - just a quick rinse and I'm done. The durable plastic construction makes it great for travel too. While it takes a bit of practice to dial in the perfect brew, I think the results are worth it. The AeroPress XL has become my go-to for making fantastic coffee at home or on the go.

# Brew-and-Serve Carafe: Convenience in a Cup

I love how easy it is to make and serve coffee with the AeroPress XL's carafe. This clear Tritan container lets me brew up to 20 ounces directly into it. Then I can pour for myself or guests without any extra steps. It's great for entertaining or just having a bigger batch ready.

The carafe feels sturdy and pours smoothly. I don't worry about it breaking if I accidentally bump it. Clean-up is simple too - a quick rinse is usually all it needs.

One small downside is that the carafe doesn't keep coffee hot for very long. I sometimes transfer leftovers to a thermos if I want it to stay warm. But for quick brewing and serving, it's perfect.

Overall, the carafe adds a lot of usefulness to the AeroPress XL. It makes the whole coffee-making process faster and more convenient.

# The Richness of Choice: Unique 3-in-1 Brew Technology

I was amazed by the AeroPress XL's 3-in-1 brew technology. It combines French press, pour-over, and espresso methods in one device. This unique approach gives me more control over my coffee.

The mix of agitation and pressure with micro-filtration is clever. I can use finer ground coffee, which extracts flavors faster. The result? A smooth, rich cup without bitterness or grit.

I found the brew process quick and easy. Hot water pushes through the grounds, aerating them for fresh flavors. The paper filter keeps my coffee clean and grit-free.

This tech beats a standard French press. No more muddy cups or long clean-up times. I just pop out the used grounds and rinse. It's perfect for my morning rush or camping trips.

The AeroPress XL makes great coffee consistently. Its innovative design has changed how I brew at home and on the go.

# Effortless Sophistication: Better Than French Press

I've tried many coffee makers, but the AeroPress XL stands out. It's a game-changer for coffee lovers who want great taste without the hassle. Unlike a French press, there's no grit or bitterness in the cup. The XL brews up to 20 oz, perfect for sharing or bigger mugs.

What I love most is how quick and easy it is to use. Just add coffee, pour hot water, stir, and press. Clean-up is a breeze too - just pop out the used grounds and rinse. It's ideal for travel and camping trips.

The coffee tastes smooth and rich. The unique brewing method extracts pure flavors without the downsides of other methods. I've found I need less coffee to get a full-bodied taste.

While it's great, the plastic build might not appeal to everyone. But for me, the portability and durability make up for it. If you want fuss-free, delicious coffee, the AeroPress XL is worth trying.

# Pros and Cons

I've been using the AeroPress XL for a while now, and it's really changed how I make coffee at home and on the go. Here's what I've found:

I love that the AeroPress XL comes with a carafe. It's handy for serving and looks nice on the table. The 3-in-1 brew method really does make a difference ‚Äì I get a clean cup without any grit.

One thing to note is that it's mostly plastic. While it's BPA-free and durable, some people might prefer metal or glass brewers. But for me, the lightweight design is a plus, especially when I'm packing for a trip.

# Authentic Experiences: Customer Reviews

I've been using the AeroPress XL for a while now, and I'm not alone in my positive experience. Many users praise its versatility and the quality of coffee it produces. People love how it combines French press, pour-over, and espresso methods. They often mention the smooth, full-bodied taste without bitterness or grit.

Lots of reviewers highlight how easy it is to use and clean. Its portability is a big plus for campers and travelers. Some users say it's better than their old coffee makers. A few note that it takes some practice to get the perfect brew, but most find it worth the effort.

While most feedback is positive, a small number of users prefer other brewing methods. Overall, the AeroPress XL seems to be a hit with coffee lovers looking for a simple way to make great coffee at home or on the go.

And I am struggling so bad. I spend most of the morning trying to stay awake, downing more coffee than I usually do. I can't remember this schedule for the life of me simply because I didn't make it and there's no give to it to allow transition between activities and practically everything requires the other women in the shelter and we constantly have to do everything together. None of the supervisors announce anything beforehand. If I miss breakfast, it's because I slept through it. I've been written up twice for reading manga during bible study because I assumed the speaker was another woman at the shelter (doesn't help everyone has the same black jacket) and nobody announced anything beforehand and gave me time to get a bible and put my belongings aside.

No I don't. I was only allowed to look at the schedule in the manager's room for five minutes and sign a paper acknowledging I (really don't) understand it. There's no schedule anywhere else. I can't set reminders because your phone must be on silent (not vibrate) while you're in the shelter or dayroom. Maybe I'm slow or whatever. 

When I was housed I had my own schedule I'd honestly beat myself up over if I missed anything. I stuck to it to a T.

The Low-Down on Dog Bad Breath Chews: Why You Should Care
=========================================================

Let‚Äôs face it‚Äîwhen your furry friend greets you with enthusiasm, you want to bask in their joy. However, that joy can quickly turn sour if you're met with a wave of bad breath. Yikes! As loving pet owners, we often overlook this somewhat off-putting detail, yet it‚Äôs essential not only for our noses but for our pups' overall health too. Bad breath in dogs can be a sign of various underlying issues ranging from dental diseases to dietary indiscretions, and addressing it is crucial. One of the most effective ways to tackle this problem? Enter dog bad breath chews.

In this article, we‚Äôll dive deep into the world of dog bad breath chews, exploring why they‚Äôre essential, how they work, and what to look for in a product. Whether you‚Äôre dealing with a puppy whose breath could clear a room or an older dog whose oral hygiene has gone downhill, you‚Äôll find practical tips and insights here. So, grab a cup of coffee, settle in with your dog by your side, and let‚Äôs dig in!

Understanding Bad Breath: What Causes It?
-----------------------------------------

Before we can discuss solutions like dog bad breath chews, it‚Äôs vital to understand what causes that unpleasant odor wafting from your pup's mouth. Believe it or not, bad breath isn‚Äôt just about poor hygiene; it can signal serious health issues:

### 1. Poor Oral Hygiene

Just like humans, dogs need regular dental care. If you aren‚Äôt brushing your dog‚Äôs teeth‚Äîor at least providing dental chews that help scrape away plaque‚Äîyou could be paving the way for bacteria buildup that leads to gum disease and, ultimately, bad breath.

### 2. Diet Plays a Role

What your dog eats can significantly affect their breath. Foods that are rich in protein, especially if they're leftover scraps, can lead to foul-smelling breath. Also, some dogs might get a little too adventurous at the dinner table, which can result in digestion issues that generate bad odors.

### 3. Health Issues

Sometimes, bad breath can indicate a more serious problem. Conditions like kidney disease, diabetes, and gastrointestinal diseases can all produce distinct odors. If your dog's breath suddenly changes for the worse and it‚Äôs accompanied by other behavioral changes, it‚Äôs worth checking in with your vet.

### 4. Dental Disease

One common cause of bad breath is periodontal disease, a condition where the gums become inflamed due to plaque buildup. This can lead to tooth loss if left untreated. Keeping up with regular vet visits can help catch these issues before they spiral out of control.

So, what can you do to combat all those potential causes? Here‚Äôs where dog bad breath chews enter the spotlight!

Dog Bad Breath Chews: What Are They Exactly?
--------------------------------------------

When you think of dog bad breath chews, what comes to mind? Perhaps a crunchy treat that smells nice? Well, you‚Äôre not far off! Dog bad breath chews are specifically formulated treats designed to promote better dental health while fighting bad breath.

These chews not only freshen your dog's breath but also help reduce plaque and tartar buildup‚Äîtwo culprits in the battle against oral hygiene. Many of them contain natural ingredients that can aid in oral health while satisfying your pup‚Äôs cravings for something delicious.

### Why Choose Dog Bad Breath Chews?

You may wonder, ""Why use chews specifically?"" Here are several compelling reasons:

- **Ease of Use**: Unlike toothbrushes that can scare some dogs, most chews are easy to administer. Just toss it to your dog, and they‚Äôll do the chewing for you!
- **Variety of Flavors**: With a range of flavors available, from chicken to mint, there‚Äôs a chew that your dog will likely adore.
- **Multi-Functional**: Many of these chews serve multiple purposes‚Äîdental health, fresher breath, and even nutritional benefits!
- **Engagement**: Chewing keeps dogs occupied, which can be especially beneficial if your pup tends to get bored easily.

Choosing the Right Dog Bad Breath Chews
---------------------------------------

Not all dog bad breath chews are created equal, so how do you choose the right one? Here‚Äôs a handy guide to help you navigate this field:

### 1. Ingredients Matter

Always check the ingredient list. Look for natural ingredients rather than artificial preservatives or fillers. Some beneficial components to consider include:

- **Chlorophyll**: Known for its deodorizing properties.
- **Baking Soda**: Helps neutralize odors and clean teeth.
- **Seaweed**: Can help reduce plaque buildup naturally.

### 2. Size and Texture

Choose a chew that suits your dog‚Äôs size. Larger dogs may need tougher chews, while smaller breeds should have appropriately sized options. Additionally, a chewy texture is essential for scraping away plaque as your dog chomps down.

### 3. Veterinary Approval

When in doubt, go for products endorsed by veterinarians or those backed by research. This ensures they are safe and effective.

### 4. Avoid Harmful Additives

Be sure to avoid chews that contain harmful additives like xylitol, which is toxic to dogs. Always err on the side of caution!

### 5. Customer Reviews

A bit of research goes a long way. Check online reviews to see what other dog owners have to say about the effectiveness of the chews you're considering.

How to Incorporate Dog Bad Breath Chews into Your Routine
---------------------------------------------------------

Once you've found the right dog bad breath chews, how do you incorporate them into your pup's routine? Here's a simple approach to make it both fun and effective:

### 1. Set a Schedule

Determine when you'll give your dog the chews‚Äîdaily, weekly, or whatever works best for your dog‚Äôs routine. Consistency is key to seeing results.

### 2. Make it Special

Consider giving your dog a chew during specific times, like after their evening walk or as a reward for good behavior. This way, they'll associate the chews with positive experiences.

### 3. Monitor Usage

Keep an eye on how many chews your dog consumes, particularly if the treats have caloric content. Just because they love them doesn‚Äôt mean they should have endless amounts!

### 4. Pair with Other Dental Practices

Incorporate other dental hygiene practices alongside the chews. Regular vet check-ups and brushing your dog‚Äôs teeth (if they‚Äôll allow it) reinforce that you care about their oral health.

### 5. Evaluate Effectiveness

After a few weeks of regular use, assess the impact. Is your dog's breath fresher? Are they experiencing any dental improvements? Adjust accordingly based on your observations.

Alternatives to Dog Bad Breath Chews
------------------------------------

Dog bad breath chews aren‚Äôt the only game in town, so if they don‚Äôt quite suit your pup, what else can you do? Here are some alternatives that can help improve your dog's breath:

### 1. Dental Treats

Similar to bad breath chews, dental treats can scrub away plaque and freshen breath. Look for those that are specifically marketed for dental health.

### 2. Regular Tooth Brushing

As daunting as it may sound, regular brushing with toothpaste made for dogs is one of the most effective ways to keep their breath fresh.

### 3. Oral Rinses

Consider using dog-safe oral rinses that can help reduce bacteria in the mouth. Just be sure to choose products that are safe for canine consumption.

### 4. Fresh Water

Encouraging your dog to drink plenty of fresh water can help flush out food particles and bacteria, promoting overall oral health.

### 5. Healthy Diet

Feeding your dog a well-balanced diet that includes dental health-friendly foods can contribute to fresher breath. Crunchy kibble often helps scrape teeth clean and reduces plaque.

Dog Bad Breath Chews: Customer Testimonials
-------------------------------------------

Who better to tell you about the effectiveness of dog bad breath chews than fellow dog owners? Here are a few testimonials that highlight their benefits:

- *‚ÄúI tried everything for my Dachshund's breath, but nothing worked until we found these chews. His breath is noticeably better!‚Äù* ‚Äì Sarah, proud dog mom.

Conclusion: Fresh Breath, Happy Dog
-----------------------------------

Alright, folks, let‚Äôs circle back to the essentials. Bad breath in dogs is more than just a nuisance; it can signal underlying health issues that require attention. By incorporating dog bad breath chews into your pup's routine, you‚Äôre taking proactive steps to ensure their oral health and freshening their breath at the same time. Remember to choose the right product, keep an eye on their usage, and pair it with other dental hygiene practices for optimum results.

With a little diligence and the right tools, you can transform your dog‚Äôs breath from ‚ÄúWhoa, buddy!‚Äù to ‚ÄúWow, that‚Äôs delightful!‚Äù Not only will this lead to a healthier dog, but it‚Äôll also make those affectionate moments a lot more enjoyable for you both.

1hdgr8o,https://www.reddit.com/r/adhdwomen/comments/1hdgr8o/sharing_some_simple_tips_from_the_workbook_im/,"Sharing some simple tips from the workbook I'm writing, that really work for me.","I'd love to get started as a coach, focusing on ADHD, and I'm putting together a workbook targeted at people who feel like they're facing barriers. I found my passion! Managing my own ADHD without medication has meant I need to really focus on self-help routines that work for my brain. I've also learned a lot from this amazing community, the positivity and authenticity are wonderful.

Here are some tips that might help, if you're not already doing them:

* Acceptance: Observe where you're at in life without judgment (easier said than done). Notice areas you might want to make small adjustments, and write them down. This helps get them out of your head, and become more actionable.
   * I love this cheap writing tablet I found online. The writing shows up in pretty colors, and I can press a button to erase the screen and start again.
* The 2-Minute Rule: If you can finish something in a minute or two, do it now. 
   * Or do 2 minutes of a bigger task to get activation energy and help with the activity transition.
* Time Blocking with Rewards: Set a timer for 15-30 minutes, then after, a 5-minute dopamine break (like music, movement, or scrolling) - aka the Pomodoro technique.
* Visual Cues: Keep sticky notes in your high-traffic areas to keep priorities and reminders visible. Or go digital, use your calendar app for reminders. 
   * I use Ohai to help me manage my calendar and time, and remind me of important things. If you'd like a free month to try it out (no card on file), DM me for the link.
* A Simple Routine: I'm on the computer all day for work, so I built a weekly routine in Excel, one I knew I could follow, and I X off each box as I complete it. It helps me know what I'm supposed to be doing throughout the day, and I love the accomplishment of feeling like I'm on-track. 
* Better Mornings: I stopped trying to force myself to get up and get ready sooner (which wasn't working anyway). Instead, I finally figured out that not being a morning person, I still wanted to enjoy starting my day. Now, I get up much earlier than I used to, make coffee, and spend time reflecting with the Calm app, or just doing whatever feels right for the time. By the time I need to get started on work, I've already had a good day. Getting up earlier and pushing through feeling tired naturally adjusted my bedtime earlier to compensate.

 Long story short: I don't like the friendship I have with someone in my social group but don't know how to end things. Read on for context. 



I (31F) have been in a friend group with a very active group chat for the past 6/7 years. We've been friends since school, so that's around 15 years of on and off friendship. It's a group of 7 women and I'm closest to two of them. Let's call them Molly and Holly. We mainly use the group to chat about random stuff and plan events. The whole idea behind the group was so that no one feels left out, since there were many sub groups within the social group and some people (like me) felt sidelined. 

Molly is sort of the queen bee in the group and used to be my best friend. We both have very strong opinions and strong leader-type personalities. It was us two against the world back in our early 20s, but somewhere along the line that faded out.

I've always felt like a bit of an outsider within the social hierarchy of the group.Molly is a very competitive person, very judgy, she's the loudest in the room and a huge socialite. She's always up to date on everyone's business but keeps her cards very close to her chest. She's also a bit of a snob. None of these things bothered me when we were best friends, because we were young and dumb, and also I was in the inner circle so I didn't really see how judhy she can be.  Now that I see it from the outside I  feel I've outgrown her behaviour. Moreover she never makes an effort to spend time with me on an individual basis, like going for a coffee, and yet has time to meet other friends within the group, particularly Holly - who also used to be a good friend of mine and who I talk to often, but never asks me to hang out individually.

I'd say that for the past three years I've felt that if I were to meet Molly and Holly today I wouldn't be friends with them. We don't seem to share the same values and beliefs, but we've had so many years of memories that the friendship seems logical.

I've wrestled with the idea that maybe I don't want to remain friends with Molly, even though it makes me sad. My issue is that if I stop being friends with her by letting the friendship die the death it should have died years ago, I also have to stop being friends with Holly and the rest of the group... And that means leaving the group chat. 

I can't think of a way to do it where it doesn't turn into a shit storm. Should I just confront Molly?  People in the group are very loyal to her so it's unlikely I can leave the group but remain friends with others.


Any advice on how you would approach this? It's ver confusing and I don't really have anyone to talk to about it except my partner who can't stand Molly üòÖ

I was previously in relatively good health prior to when these symptoms started, although I was being evaluated by GI for weight loss, GERD, and various other GI symptoms. My only chronic diagnosis is hypothyroidism, which is controlled by taking Levothyroxine 25 mcg daily. I was diagnosed with GERD ~2012 and have been taking PPIs since then (have tried pretty much all of them), with little to no symptom improvement.

History:

In October 2023, I had an EGD done to investigate for any potential causes of my GI symptoms. Besides a small 2 cm hiatal hernia, there was nothing abnormal found and biopsies were all normal. I was told that a 2 cm HH is small, therefore, it would not be causing all of the symptoms I was experiencing. I was referred to a general surgeon in order to do further investigation to explore potential surgical options.

Fast forward to early 2024, I finally see this general surgeon, who wants to perform another EGD in order to place a Bravo pH-monitoring device. He had explained that his intention with this was to monitor the pH level in the esophagus to determine if there is any stomach acid being regurgitated, in which case a patient may be considered a good candidate for surgical repair of the hiatal hernia. I was extremely hesitant, as I didn‚Äôt like the idea of an implant in my esophagus, but I agreed because I was so desperate for an answer. At this point, I had lost around 20 pounds (I was already thin to begin with) and was struggling to eat daily. I was experiencing heartburn symptoms such as chest pain, burning feeling in the back of the throat, and awful reflux. The reflux that I have been experiencing lately isn‚Äôt like typical reflux, in fact, there is nothing being regurgitated at all. There is no stomach acid or undigested food, it is literally just air coming up, but it causes pain from my sternum all the way up my esophagus and it is audible to other people who are close to me. It is essentially impossible to eat, drink, or really swallow at all when this is happening. We scheduled the EGD + Bravo device placement.

In May 2024, I had the procedure done and was discharged the same day with no issues. Again, I was told there was nothing abnormal seen in my EGD besides the 2 cm HH. Immediately upon waking from anesthesia, I had this intense, aching chest/esophagus pain. I was told that this was just pain from the implant, which would be temporary and go away when the implant detaches itself from the esophageal wall. I carried a monitor around with me for 48 hours that was used to log symptoms (chest pain, heartburn, and reflux/burping) and documented each time I started and stopped eating, as well as each time I laid down and got back up. I struggled to eat for the next 5-7 days that the implant was attached, as it felt like this tugging pain in my throat where food was passing the implant in my esophagus, and eating worsened the chest pain quite a bit. I was told to call the surgeon back if I had any symptoms like trouble swallowing, severe pain, etc.

About 2-3 weeks after having this EGD, and about 1 week after I am pretty sure the implant had detached (I had stopped experiencing the throat/chest pain), I was still having trouble swallowing. I called the surgeon back and went in for a follow up, and he wanted to go over my Bravo pH data. He said that the times that I had logged symptoms did not correlate with the fluctuations in pH, basically saying that my symptoms are not caused by GERD, as he said mine was ‚Äúmild‚Äù compared to other cases. The dysphagia was never addressed and I was completely dismissed, so I went on with life and tried to forget about it.

In June 2024, I was experiencing ear problems (fullness and popping) on the left side and my dysphagia was progressively worsening. Because of the ear symptoms and this feeling of having a thick mucus in my throat/trouble swallowing, I worried that I may have had a sinus infection. I went to Urgent Care, where they suggested an X-ray because I had stated that I felt like there was something stuck in my throat. The X-ray showed just a tiny, 2 mm punctate that was indeterminate, so they were unable to tell if it was any kind of foreign object. Because I was not in serious pain and my airway was not obstructed, I was sent home and advised to follow up with my PCP.

I followed up with my PCP regarding the indeterminate X-ray, left ear symptoms, dysphagia, and globus sensation. He recommended that I see ENT, as he was concerned but felt that this was outside of his realm of knowledge. I went to see this ENT that I was referred to, which turned out to be the worst experience I have ever had with a doctor. He asked me questions about my diet, such as ‚ÄúHow many ___ do you have a week?‚Äù To which I responded that I have maybe 1-2 sodas a week, 1-2 alcoholic beverages, had completely cut out coffee, and drank tea daily. He immediately lectured me about how awful my diet was and told me that there was nothing wrong, I just needed to change my diet, and this was before even examining me. I asked how my diet would cause something to appear on an X-ray, to which he responded, ‚ÄúX-ray? I didn‚Äôt even look at that because I knew what it was, I see this all the time.‚Äù He then told me how he has patients with GERD complain that they feel like something is stuck in their throat ‚Äúall the time,‚Äù and how it was always just their diet causing the problem. I explained to him that I had already tried multiple elimination diets with no improvements, and I did not feel that my current diet was the issue, as I had already made modifications (cutting out coffee, spicy foods, acidic fruits like oranges, etc.). He then lectured me on how much caffeine tea has in it; mind you, I only drink herbal tea, which has zero caffeine. The box literally says Sleepy Time on it, but I didn‚Äôt argue any further because this guy was obviously an idiot. I ended up walking out of that appointment, cried on the way home, and went back to pretending I was okay because I had gotten no help, once again. I was so desperate and felt like there was nobody that could help me.

By the end of June, the symptoms had gotten progressively worse and I had begun experiencing actual pain (not just discomfort) when swallowing, specifically on the left side of my neck. I ended up going to the ER one night, where I was tested for strep, mono, Covid, RSV, flu, etc. with all tests coming back negative. I had a CT scan of my neck, which showed nothing but a small tonsil stone on the right side, which is not the side that I was having pain on. I was sent home from the ER with no answers and no help.

In July, I went back to my PCP, explained all that had happened so far, and requested a referral to a different ENT doc. I then went and saw this ENT doc, who was no more help than the first one. He ordered a few different types of barium swallow studies, which all showed normal anatomy, function, and motility. When he couldn‚Äôt give me an answer, I was referred to neurology, pain management, and Cleveland Clinic ENT. 

I saw pain management first, who prescribed Gabapentin and ordered an MRI to rule out cervical vertebrae injuries. My MRI was unremarkable. The Gabapentin seemed to help with the ‚Äúburning‚Äù feeling pain, but did nothing for the pain/trouble swallowing and neck pain. The pain specialist NP then suggested we try a Botox injection in the cervical muscles to release tension and hopefully decrease pain. (Still currently waiting on insurance to approve the Botox at the time of this post.)

The neurologist examined me and my test results thoroughly, ordered some blood work and another MRI, and was honest with me that she doesn‚Äôt think this is a neurological or neuromuscular condition. I agreed with her, but we will be performing those tests just to be sure, especially since nobody has found anything wrong up until this point.

The Cleveland Clinic ENT doc was by far the most helpful and empathetic doctor that I have had thus far. I was constantly being treated like I was crazy or overdramatic, and I was tired of being jerked around by all these doctors for over 6 months. He sat down and actually listened to my symptoms, asking me many questions about my history of GERD diagnosis and symptoms, PPI usage, and specifically how the ‚Äúreflux‚Äù feels. He then explained that I may have GERD, but the symptoms that were written off by other doctors may not be caused by the GERD, but actually by esophageal spasms. Especially because the regurgitation that occurs is only air, my Bravo study showed relatively mild reflux, PPIs had never helped, and I was experiencing the globus sensation and neck pain. He also mentioned hypersensitive esophagus, which would explain why I am having neck pain and pain when swallowing, even when there is not actually a pain stimulus. Neither of these are confirmed diagnoses, but because he was suspicious, he referred me to GI at the Cleveland Clinic and recommended that I have esophageal manometry performed. Esophageal manometry is the test often used to diagnose esophageal spasms, as it monitors and records the pressure in the esophagus to detect any changes/abnormalities. (At the time of writing this post, I am still waiting to see this GI doc, so the manometry has not yet been ordered.)

To sum everything up:

Symptoms:
Pain swallowing, globus sensation (constant), neck pain, difficulty swallowing (specifically with initiating a swallow), feeling like food/drink is taking longer than normal to travel down the esophagus, a ‚Äúclicking‚Äù sensation when swallowing (I feel this in the same place as the globus sensation), reflux of air, chest pain, throat/esophagus pain, shortness of breath (especially after eating), nausea, weight loss, heartburn, left ear fullness/popping, pain in the back of the head/neck (right at the base of the skull), and pain that radiates to shoulder and down the arms.

I have seen ENT, pain management, GI, emergency medicine, neurology, and my PCP. All blood work, tests, and imaging have been normal besides the 2 cm HH found on my initial EGD. I struggle to eat and drink, can hardly sleep, and had to drop multiple classes this past semester because I couldn‚Äôt keep up as my health was deteriorating. There has been no sense of urgency or even concern shown by many doctors I have seen, despite the fact that I have lost ‚Öì of my body weight and now struggle to stay over 100 pounds. I am desperate for answers, as my quality of life has been severely affected. Obviously, I am not asking for any medical advice from the internet, but please, if anyone has experienced similar symptoms or has gotten a diagnosis for these symptoms I would be extremely grateful for any insight you may be able to provide.

Because I was not in serious pain and my airway was not obstructed, I was sent home and advised to follow up with my PCP.

I followed up with my PCP regarding the indeterminate X-ray, left ear symptoms, dysphagia, and globus sensation. He recommended that I see ENT, as he was concerned but felt that this was outside of his realm of knowledge. I went to see this ENT that I was referred to, which turned out to be the worst experience I have ever had with a doctor. He asked me questions about my diet, such as ‚ÄúHow many ___ do you have a week?‚Äù To which I responded that I have maybe 1-2 sodas a week, 1-2 alcoholic beverages, had completely cut out coffee, and drank tea daily. He immediately lectured me about how awful my diet was and told me that there was nothing wrong, I just needed to change my diet, and this was before even examining me. I asked how my diet would cause something to appear on an X-ray, to which he responded, ‚ÄúX-ray? I didn‚Äôt even look at that because I knew what it was, I see this all the time.‚Äù He then told me how he has patients with GERD complain that they feel like something is stuck in their throat ‚Äúall the time,‚Äù and how it was always just their diet causing the problem. I explained to him that I had already tried multiple elimination diets with no improvements, and I did not feel that my current diet was the issue, as I had already made modifications (cutting out coffee, spicy foods, acidic fruits like oranges, etc.). He then lectured me on how much caffeine tea has in it; mind you, I only drink herbal tea, which has zero caffeine. The box literally says Sleepy Time on it, but I didn‚Äôt argue any further because this guy was obviously an idiot. I ended up walking out of that appointment, cried on the way home, and went back to pretending I was okay because I had gotten no help, once again. I was so desperate and felt like there was nobody that could help me.

By the end of June, the symptoms had gotten progressively worse and I had begun experiencing actual pain (not just discomfort) when swallowing, specifically on the left side of my neck. I ended up going to the ER one night, where I was tested for strep, mono, Covid, RSV, flu, etc. with all tests coming back negative. I had a CT scan of my neck, which showed nothing but a small tonsil stone on the right side, which is not the side that I was having pain on. I was sent home from the ER with no answers and no help.

In July, I went back to my PCP, explained all that had happened so far, and requested a referral to a different ENT doc. I then went and saw this ENT doc, who was no more help than the first one. He ordered a few different types of barium swallow studies, which all showed normal anatomy, function, and motility. When he couldn‚Äôt give me an answer, I was referred to neurology, pain management, and Cleveland Clinic ENT. 

I saw pain management first, who prescribed Gabapentin and ordered an MRI to rule out cervical vertebrae injuries. My MRI was unremarkable. The Gabapentin seemed to help with the ‚Äúburning‚Äù feeling pain, but did nothing for the pain/trouble swallowing and neck pain. The pain specialist NP then suggested we try a Botox injection in the cervical muscles to release tension and hopefully decrease pain. (Still currently waiting on insurance to approve the Botox at the time of this post.)

The neurologist examined me and my test results thoroughly, ordered some blood work and another MRI, and was honest with me that she doesn‚Äôt think this is a neurological or neuromuscular condition. I agreed with her, but we will be performing those tests just to be sure, especially since nobody has found anything wrong up until this point.

The Cleveland Clinic ENT doc was by far the most helpful and empathetic doctor that I have had thus far. I was constantly being treated like I was crazy or overdramatic, and I was tired of being jerked around by all these doctors for over 6 months. He sat down and actually listened to my symptoms, asking me many questions about my history of GERD diagnosis and symptoms, PPI usage, and specifically how the ‚Äúreflux‚Äù feels. He then explained that I may have GERD, but the symptoms that were written off by other doctors may not be caused by the GERD, but actually by esophageal spasms. Especially because the regurgitation that occurs is only air, my Bravo study showed relatively mild reflux, PPIs had never helped, and I was experiencing the globus sensation and neck pain. He also mentioned hypersensitive esophagus, which would explain why I am having neck pain and pain when swallowing, even when there is not actually a pain stimulus. Neither of these are confirmed diagnoses, but because he was suspicious, he referred me to GI at the Cleveland Clinic and recommended that I have esophageal manometry performed. Esophageal manometry is the test often used to diagnose esophageal spasms, as it monitors and records the pressure in the esophagus to detect any changes/abnormalities. (At the time of writing this post, I am still waiting to see this GI doc, so the manometry has not yet been ordered.)

To sum everything up:

Symptoms:
Pain swallowing, globus sensation (constant), neck pain, difficulty swallowing (specifically with initiating a swallow), feeling like food/drink is taking longer than normal to travel down the esophagus, a ‚Äúclicking‚Äù sensation when swallowing (I feel this in the same place as the globus sensation), reflux of air, chest pain, throat/esophagus pain, shortness of breath (especially after eating), nausea, weight loss, heartburn, left ear fullness/popping, pain in the back of the head/neck (right at the base of the skull), and pain that radiates to shoulder and down the arms.

I have seen ENT, pain management, GI, emergency medicine, neurology, and my PCP. All blood work, tests, and imaging have been normal besides the 2 cm HH found on my initial EGD. I struggle to eat and drink, can hardly sleep, and had to drop multiple classes this past semester because I couldn‚Äôt keep up as my health was deteriorating. There has been no sense of urgency or even concern shown by many doctors I have seen, despite the fact that I have lost ‚Öì of my body weight and now struggle to stay over 100 pounds. I am desperate for answers, as my quality of life has been severely affected. Obviously, I am not asking for any medical advice from the internet, but please, if anyone has experienced similar symptoms or has gotten a diagnosis for these symptoms I would be extremely grateful for any insight you may be able to provide. 

Does anyone with confirmed esophageal spasms and/or hypersensitive esophagus experience these symptoms? What paths were taken to reach a diagnosis? ",1,1734108671.0,HiatalHernia,0,0.99,False

I got some bad news the other day. My grandfather Leo from the Kenner side of the family had passed away. I knew he had been sick but I suppose my thoughts and prayers for him were lost in my busy undergraduate life. I think I took seeing him this Christmas for granted.

My mother volun-told me to have something to say about him at the funeral. I am not a successful public speaker, My sweat soaked through my t-shirt at my last research project presentation in my sociology class. The last thing I wanted to do was write and give a eulogy in front the families.

I sat down in my little cozy campus coffee shoe and started to bash keys on my laptop ‚Äì mostly unremarkable boiler plate kinds of things. I read it back to myself and I started to think it sounded downright disrespectful. It started to sound like a paper I'd occasionally have to write at one in the morning.

Maybe it was the particular roast of coffee I was drinking, maybe it was low din of a dozen conversations carrying through the air but it was probably the jaw grinding chirp of a smoke detector low on battery somewhere nearby but hidden from sight that really got me thinking about Grandpa Leo.

When my brother Ben and I were much younger, say in somewhere between seven and ten or so, we'd often visit Grandma Helen and Grandpa Leo in the summer for daycare or whenever our parents needed a break from us. My best memories of both of them are from those days and I suppose it is funny how I've kept their appearance from ten or twelve years ago as how they look and feel now even though they were in considerably worse shape a year ago when I saw them around Christmas.

Grandma Helen with her silver curly perm, cherry lipstick and perfume to match, and a light pleasant attitude despite her occasional bouts with a wobbly unsteady gait. She could warm up the deck of the Titanic with her smile and her habit of slapping her knees when crowing out her signature wheezing laugh. Despite her age, being senior to Leo by a few years, lifted a room like a blooming fruit tree in spring.

If Helen was the blooming side of a perpetual spring, Leo was the gray half frozen half melted slush dropping like elephant dung out of the wheel wells of your car. He always seemed to have his arms crossed across his chest and what dress in a camouflage of flannel matching wherever he was or was expected to be. His fading ashen charcoal pants matched the color and lack of care put into maintaining his paper thin comb-over. His eyes were usually either mostly closed or unfocused through thick glasses. Once he took up a spot on the couch or dinner table it was difficult to dislodge him. He rare spoke much, but when he did, everyone listened, partially because his roar lived up the lion in Leo, but also because he was terribly challenged at hearing.

All of his appearance matched the unsteady but rocky existence of that slush. He didn't care if he was frozen or melty but kick him and you'll soon need more ice for your foot. He was half here and half gone and I think that's how he liked to be as settled into old age. He was a veteran of three wars and as a successful electrical engineer, he had seen and done more things than maybe three life times worth and he was over living but didn't want to be totally rude or overt about it. Because I knew he could be rude, scary, down right dangerous.

A very specific memory was dusted off and dropped into the forefront of my brain. It was a nuclear bomb had gone off and flash fried all of my pleasant memories of spending time with Leo and Helen as a child. I realized there was a reason Ben and I stopped going there.

It had something to do with Quasar Quest breakfast cereal ‚Äì see it was this cereal which was a lot like Lucky Charms but had round and ringed spherical shapes for planets and stars instead of that bits that looked like punctuation like in Lucky Charms, and of course, sparkling marshmallow bits that resembled nebula, galaxies, and well, quasars.

The more I thought about it the more I recalled that Dad dropped us off with a box of it we begged him for from the grocery store he had to visit on the way to the Kenners. We had Grandma pour bowls for us ‚Äì I liked mine dry but Ben would always try to push mushy cereal in my ears while we sat on our bellies to watch the summer morning cartoon line up on their wooden cased antiquated tv set. Grandma sat with us in the den, reading magazines with reading glasses in her recliner chair while Grandpa was, well, in the adjacent room, his workshop surrounded by tools and his war memorabilia, enjoying what we later learned was his morning eye opener whiskey.

Of course, I should be honest, Ben tried to stick wet cereal in my ears but I would chomp as loudly as possible with my dry crunchy cereal in his ears ‚Äì among other forms of brotherly love. That day was no exception. What was exceptional was Grandpa Leo who stirred from his workshop and came to the threshold. Back lit by the workshop lighting, Leo stood there, staring at me as I chomped in Ben's ear. Leo, as I said, usually muted and expressionless, stood there red in the face might as well be shooting me with lasers from his eyes like I called him the string of nastiest words in the world.



‚ÄúHelen!‚Äù His eyes finally lifted off of mine to Grandpa who sat behind me in the corner, ‚Äúwhat the HELL are you and these kids watchin?‚Äù His voice cracked slightly at hell.



Helen peered down from her magazine, ‚Äújust some cartoons...why?‚Äù



‚ÄúWell, I heard Pete over there with his gosh darn cereal crunching then I heard...well...I'm not going to use that kind of language again in front of the kids, Helen.‚Äù



Helen hid a bit of a struggle moving herself from the chair to threshold where she whispered with Leo. I only heard the tail end of the conversation which ended with Leo agreeing to take his hearing aid out and shut the door. I saw Grandma Helen turn with eyes high and lips puckered together in distress as she weaved her way back to her chair, back into her magazines.

I remember asking her if I did something wrong because I had never seen him like that before and I had seen my Dad look that way a few times when he was mad at me so I had the fear smoldering.



‚ÄúNo, well, not Grandpa, he's both hard of hearing and very sensitive to certain sounds, but you shouldn't antagonize your brother like that. Eat your food in a civilized way, young man.‚Äù



I fished another couple of planets and comets into my spoon and shoveled them into my mouth like some super weapon out of Star Wars. I barely had enough time to make a fourth full chewing motion when I heard loud metallic bang from the workshop along with Leo's cursing roar of ‚ÄúGODDAMNIT!‚Äù



I was so started by the sound and Leo's voice the food literally dropped out of my mouth and back to the bowl. Ben and I gasped and turned towards Helen who's mouth hung open and eyes cinched tight, a face of terror masked with surprise and concern. Helen groaned as she flung her magazine to the floor and waddled over to the workshop door.



Within seconds all I could hear coming from the workshop was ‚ÄúTHEY ARE OFF!‚Äù I don't remember the in between probably because Grandpa Leo It's like, it's like a goddamn bell ringing in my ears and its not ringing. It's saying something. It's saying terrible terrible things...things I haven't heard since I was in war! It's the sound of nails on a chalk board and machine guns and the sound of...the sound of...the boys...the boys...Helen!‚Äù



Helen's foot pressed the door shut and she turned on the workshop's vacuum fan to cover up the rest of their conversation.

When she stepped back out her face was solemn and serious. ‚ÄúC'mon upstairs, finish your food there and then we come back and watch tv?‚Äù

I remember Ben resisting but given the chance I ran up those stairs to the kitchen with my cereal and proceeded to chew away. I was a bit nervous about it I remember that for sure but I was reassured as Ben and Grandma made their way up the stairs. I concentrated on eating for only a moment as Grandma walked in, Grandpa Leo was following directly behind her with six inch knife in hand.

I almost choked on my food as he came in wobbling, his hands clutching his ears and his war knife ‚Äì I couldn't tell you which kind.



‚ÄúMake it stop Helen! Whatever it is make it stop!‚Äù He had his eyes clamped shut as he gestured with the point of the knife towards his ear and then towards me.



‚ÄúLeo! Stop it! It didn't work before and I won't now!‚Äù



‚ÄúIt won't stop screaming in my head!‚Äù He cried out.



Helen made her way towards the phone, ‚ÄúLeo, we need to call...uh...someone...okay, this is the worst its been in...‚Äù



‚ÄúNo!‚Äù Leo was able to slice the code of the corded phone with one slash. ‚ÄúNo! It's telling me.‚Äù It's me what to do.‚Äù



‚ÄúWhat. What is it?‚Äù



‚ÄúIt's fading. It's fading. It's fading but it says. It says, Kill the Boys. Kill the Boys. Kill the boys.‚Äù He started to whimper.



I was already pressing my way deep into my seat wondering whether or not run, wondering if I should try to get help from Ben. But he was only two years older than I and it dawned on me that Helen would be easily overpowered even without the knife. As I said frozen in terror Ben scurried off into the house leaving me there alone.



Leo was in severe distress as he wobbled between the table and the cabinets and the fridge in a frantic circle. He chest heaved and his breath was short. His transitioned between clenched shut and bulging at me or Helen. His hands firmly cupping his ears but also grasping the shiny steel.



‚ÄúMake the sound again.‚Äù He said faint and breathlessly, ‚ÄúMAKE. THE. SOUND. AGAIN.‚Äù He commanded baring his teeth with a clenched jaw through guttural sounds in his chest and throat.



I had no choice. I still had the food in my mouth and I crunched the rest of it down just so I could squeak out, ‚Äú\*crunch\* what sound?‚Äù



His eyes sprung open and so did his mouth. He turned red like he was about to explode as he started to stick the point of the knife into his ear. His head jarred up and down like a mad bird. He made a cut and his face turned partially relieved as blood began to spurt out and down his neck and sleeve. His head steadied and his eyes began to focus. His eyes began to focus on me.

In a half second, his convulsions stopped and in a motion swifter than my he, he struck me with his free hand. I spit up the cereal into the bowl and started to cry. He picked up both bowls of cereal from the table and then stabbed the box with his kife and he brought them through the kitchen porch door to his gas grill. He tore out the grates and cranked up the gas burns to full and tossed the mostly full box and dumped the bowls into the grill before sticking the knife handle up in the dirt. He cirled like a dog before finding his chaise lounge in the sun and stared off into space with his ear still bleeding. I don't think he moved from that spot the rest of the day but I wasn't about to check on him as I fled to the bathroom, locked myself in, for the rest of the visit.

That was definitely the last time Ben and I stayed with them. As my exposure to them lessened and I aged my trauma had turned to ambivalence but I can definitely recall some of childhood terror.



Update:



I wanted to give an update to the bizarre story I posted about my late Grandfather Leo's apparent bought with some kind of severe misophonia. Well, that's Ben called it when I started asking him if he remembered that day while we were at the funeral. He said Grandpa, although simultaneously nearly deaf, even with hearing aids, had unusually strong reactions to certain noises ‚Äì mostly but not always repetitive human-specific or human initiated sounds like tapping pens, breathing, or in this case, chewing. He chastised me for not knowing this about him but also warned me against putting it in my eulogy.

Ben and I still try to one up each other and I had the perfect thing but I held it back for the moment because I didn't know exactly how to trip him up with it. In fact, at that point, I didn't know how to handle it. You see, I looked up the Quasar Quest cereal and there's definitely a reason it's not on the shelves anymore or why most people don't remember it.

Wikipedia had a short entry about it. Apparently it made a brief slash on the breakfast cereal scene in the late-90s, as I recall but the entire first batch of it was contaminated. Turned out the sparkling additive in the cereal was loaded with some kind of mycotoxin from a mold or fungus which had become more potent during the mixing and shaping process of the grain slurry of the hard cereal. The poison, though, not named on the page, lead to a number of severe hospitalizations and even possibly a handful of deaths across its distribution. It was also possibly highly carcinogenic as most mycotoxins turn out to be.

It's fortunate that Ben and I barely had a few bites but as I thought about it I couldn't help ignore a deeper stranger experience than connection of crunchy cereal and Leo's misophonia attack. We had eaten crunch cereals dozens of times there, a early as the previous week in fact, the only thing different was the apparently tainted cereal that day and my Grandfather's nearly homicidal or suicidal reaction to it which may have spared Ben and I injury or death.

When I finally posited the idea and the link to Ben he panned it and refused to back up some of my account of the incident but hey, what did he know. Or I, for that matter, know, I suppose trauma can do that and nothing loves justification quite like some trauma.

The funeral mass and eulogies went off without incident. Grandma Helen was stiff in her wheel chair and hidden behind window attire. The pallbearers included myself, Ben, my dad, my uncle, and two family friends. One of them, who just called himself Private Bazooka Joe, spoke to me a bit earlier in the visitation. He said he had served with Grandpa Leo in Leo's last tour in Vietnam.

He relayed that Grandpa Leo was controversially known as Sargent Spaz. He was very competent field mechanic and radio technician but anyone who served with him in his unit knew he was prone to fits of talking to himself, asking people to chew gum loudly, and rack the action on their rifles repeatedly when he was around.

Joe himself got his nickname because he was the unit's ‚Äúdesignated chewer‚Äù, their ‚Äúlone gumman‚Äù - there were a couple other puns not as memorable so they're not here.

Some people thought Leo was crazy, totally schizo, even in the rear areas, where those noises would not necessarily give away a position, he said. He told me it was crazy to NOT make those sounds around him. Private B Joe said he owned Leo his life and so did everyone else who served with him ‚Äì unless they were dumb enough to not listen to him when he told them move or duck. Leo had a radar or a premonition for incoming and even accidents. He was so eerily good at predicting shelling some in his unit, the ones who didn't listen, wondered if he was somehow in cahoots with the enemy.

The Private's reminiscence started to turn the gears of fear in my head but I shook them off. I was already somber and in the presence of death and trying to just properly put my apparently long suffering Grandfather to rest. As we started to move with the casket Amazing Grace with full bagpipes started to play as the grand doors out to the hearse opened.



Private Bazooka stood behind me and whispered almost in a non-whisper, ‚Äúthis was one the goddamn thing he could never stand. Nothing good ever came of hearing them. The damn bagpipes!‚Äù



‚ÄúNo!‚Äù I could hear and see Grandma Helen yelling and moving the most she had during the entire event as she spun around in her motorized chair trying to get someone's attention and decrying the funeral home's lack of attention to her specifications, ‚Äúthis was the one thing I promised him and you glorified hole diggers couldn't get it right! Turn this is off now!‚Äù



There were audible gasps that eclipsed the music. I'll be honest. I was focusing much of my effort holding up my end of the casket and this distraction was testing my strength. As I grimaced at the squeaky music and the building weight I couldn't help but stare at Leo.

To my bewilderment I watched in bated breath as something small, like the size of a mosquito crawled out of Grandpa Leo's ear and took off in the air. It was floating, not flying, like a speck of dust or dandelion fluff. It caught my eye for a moment, like you catch the odd eye contact glance down a super market aisle before it zipped towards my face.

I tried to duck and shake it away but I felt it. I felt it buzz into my ear. The buzz turned wet, like a wet tongue, like the wet cereal Ben used to poke into my ear. As flinched and fluttered about I caught sight of Leo again. He head was slightly turned towards me and I swear to the Lord Almighty I saw Leo wink and then sink deeper into a restful pose.

I stuttered and I stammered and then I apologized profusely. I almost dropped Leo. I lost my pallbearer duties and was relegated to escorting Grandma to her van in the procession. It was probably for the best as I could not shake what I saw. I could not shake the fullness of my right ear, the feeling I was underwater on one side of my head, the shock of Leo winking at me and the whatever flew in my ear.

Leo's burial was poorly attended by only a dozen or so out of the hundred who attended the interior part because it was a cold and very blustery day outside. We had to wait at three intersections in the cemetery for the metal signs pointing to name sections to stop swaying I couldn't help fidgeting with my ear as it seemed to warm, cool, go almost numb before growing hot again. I could hear impossible sounds like birds flapping their wings and the roar of a waterfall in that ear. Then the tapping started. It was subtle at first just barely audible over the priest's final words on Leo.

The tapping seemed to have no origin as it engulfed me and started hearing it in both ears. It was becoming so loud and seemed to becoming faster with each passing series of four taps. I must have looked crazy to the priest as I stood beside Grandma, my head spinning in every direction, in bewilderment, searching for the source of that sound. It was so loud that I was shocked no one else could hear it, no one else seemed to be looking for it.



‚ÄúPush her.‚Äù A whispering voice said in my head, vaporous, ethereal, slightly feminine but somehow unreal. ‚ÄúPush her down!‚Äù The voice came again louder, like some one cupping their hand and breathing words from ear into my brain. I shook my head and blinked away some tearing in my eyes and tried to compose myself.



‚ÄúPUSH. HER. DOWN.‚Äù This time it sounded like multiple voices came over the tapping sound. My heard jumped into my throat.



‚ÄúAnd in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ I need you to push Grandma Helen DOWN NOW.‚Äù The priest shouted loud over the wind. ‚ÄúPUSH HER INTO THE DIRT!‚Äù



‚ÄúWhat!?‚Äù I shouted in real time back.



‚ÄúPUSH HER DOWN NOW!!‚Äù Everyone in attendance seemed to shout at me.



I couldn't make the tapping nor the voices stop so I did it. I threw my entire body weight into toppling Grandma Helen from her motorized chair, right there in the cemetery. I fell backward to her side on my ass and lifted myself back up just in time to see one of the metal signs with the cemetery section stamped on them cartwheeling through the air like a razor boomerang right where Grandma Helen's head would have been. The sign, having no more lift, helicoptered to ground a dozen feet away or so.

I helped Grandma Helen back into her chair and Bazooka helped me right her chair. I was embarrassed for it all. I was scared for it all because no there would cop to actually yelling those things to me nor hearing any tapping. Nevertheless I was hero for saving Grandma from potentially fatal strike from the wind driven sign.

We finished burying Leo and Grandma insisted on no medical attention. That was a couple days ago. I got part of my inheritance in the mail. Grandpa Leo in his generosity left me a five figure sum, the war knife he once threatened me with and a handwritten letter dated apparently just after the cereal incident.

I won't relay the entire letter but the jist of it is he hopes I'll never understand the how, what, and why he was compelled to do what he did to me that day.



Update, probably my last:



I need help like right now. The only thing I could find on this thing in my ear is that its called a Cassandra Fly and it took me a week's worth of digging to find that out. I need to get it out. I can't take this anymore.

Aside from the nature of these audio and visual hallucinations and the misophonia ‚Äì what is the moral thing to do with this? Should I be listening to some kind of a repetitive sound all the time to try to invoke this power and potentially save as many as a I can?

The other day I had an attack and I was being compelled to grab a woman on the curb and I didn't, I just got her to turn slightly and she was still struck by a passing car. I stayed with her until the ambulance arrived. I think she'll be okay but I didn't act.

I can see why Grandpa had no hearing, I can see why he tried to dig this bug, this thing out of his ear with a knife. I can see why people thought he was insane. I wonder if he tried to kill himself. I wonder how many times.

I need help. I need to figure out what to do. I'm back on campus in my little coffee shop and they still haven't fixed that goddamn low battery smoke detector. That chirping is in my ear and my ear is telling something terrible is about to happen.

My ear is telling me someone is about to walk into this shop and either has killed many people or is about to. I still have Leo's knife. It is in my bag. The voice is telling, the whole coffee shop is telling me that I'll get one shot, one moment of vulnerability to land my strike and stop this person.

Just because it's been right before doesn't mean it justifies murder, right? Even if its right? Help me, I need help, I may just have a few minutes.

Grandma sat with us in the den, reading magazines with reading glasses in her recliner chair while Grandpa was, well, in the adjacent room, his workshop surrounded by tools and his war memorabilia, enjoying what we later learned was his morning eye opener whiskey.

Of course, I should be honest, Ben tried to stick wet cereal in my ears but I would chomp as loudly as possible with my dry crunchy cereal in his ears ‚Äì among other forms of brotherly love. That day was no exception. What was exceptional was Grandpa Leo who stirred from his workshop and came to the threshold. Back lit by the workshop lighting, Leo stood there, staring at me as I chomped in Ben's ear. Leo, as I said, usually muted and expressionless, stood there red in the face might as well be shooting me with lasers from his eyes like I called him the string of nastiest words in the world.



‚ÄúHelen!‚Äù His eyes finally lifted off of mine to Grandpa who sat behind me in the corner, ‚Äúwhat the HELL are you and these kids watchin?‚Äù His voice cracked slightly at hell.



Helen peered down from her magazine, ‚Äújust some cartoons...why?‚Äù



‚ÄúWell, I heard Pete over there with his gosh darn cereal crunching then I heard...well...I'm not going to use that kind of language again in front of the kids, Helen.‚Äù



Helen hid a bit of a struggle moving herself from the chair to threshold where she whispered with Leo. I only heard the tail end of the conversation which ended with Leo agreeing to take his hearing aid out and shut the door. I saw Grandma Helen turn with eyes high and lips puckered together in distress as she weaved her way back to her chair, back into her magazines.

I remember asking her if I did something wrong because I had never seen him like that before and I had seen my Dad look that way a few times when he was mad at me so I had the fear smoldering.



‚ÄúNo, well, not Grandpa, he's both hard of hearing and very sensitive to certain sounds, but you shouldn't antagonize your brother like that. Eat your food in a civilized way, young man.‚Äù



I fished another couple of planets and comets into my spoon and shoveled them into my mouth like some super weapon out of Star Wars. I barely had enough time to make a fourth full chewing motion when I heard loud metallic bang from the workshop along with Leo's cursing roar of ‚ÄúGODDAMNIT!‚Äù



I was so started by the sound and Leo's voice the food literally dropped out of my mouth and back to the bowl. Ben and I gasped and turned towards Helen who's mouth hung open and eyes cinched tight, a face of terror masked with surprise and concern. Helen groaned as she flung her magazine to the floor and waddled over to the workshop door.



Within seconds all I could hear coming from the workshop was ‚ÄúTHEY ARE OFF!‚Äù I don't remember the in between probably because Grandpa Leo It's like, it's like a goddamn bell ringing in my ears and its not ringing. It's saying something. It's saying terrible terrible things...things I haven't heard since I was in war! It's the sound of nails on a chalk board and machine guns and the sound of...the sound of...the boys...the boys...Helen!‚Äù



Helen's foot pressed the door shut and she turned on the workshop's vacuum fan to cover up the rest of their conversation.

When she stepped back out her face was solemn and serious. ‚ÄúC'mon upstairs, finish your food there and then we come back and watch tv?‚Äù

I remember Ben resisting but given the chance I ran up those stairs to the kitchen with my cereal and proceeded to chew away. I was a bit nervous about it I remember that for sure but I was reassured as Ben and Grandma made their way up the stairs. I concentrated on eating for only a moment as Grandma walked in, Grandpa Leo was following directly behind her with six inch knife in hand.

I almost choked on my food as he came in wobbling, his hands clutching his ears and his war knife ‚Äì I couldn't tell you which kind.



‚ÄúMake it stop Helen! Whatever it is make it stop!‚Äù He had his eyes clamped shut as he gestured with the point of the knife towards his ear and then towards me.



‚ÄúLeo! Stop it! It didn't work before and I won't now!‚Äù



‚ÄúIt won't stop screaming in my head!‚Äù He cried out.



Helen made her way towards the phone, ‚ÄúLeo, we need to call...uh...someone...okay, this is the worst its been in...‚Äù



‚ÄúNo!‚Äù Leo was able to slice the code of the corded phone with one slash. ‚ÄúNo! It's telling me.‚Äù It's me what to do.‚Äù



‚ÄúWhat. What is it?‚Äù



‚ÄúIt's fading. It's fading. It's fading but it says. It says, Kill the Boys. Kill the Boys. Kill the boys.‚Äù He started to whimper.



I was already pressing my way deep into my seat wondering whether or not run, wondering if I should try to get help from Ben. But he was only two years older than I and it dawned on me that Helen would be easily overpowered even without the knife. As I said frozen in terror Ben scurried off into the house leaving me there alone.



Leo was in severe distress as he wobbled between the table and the cabinets and the fridge in a frantic circle. He chest heaved and his breath was short. His transitioned between clenched shut and bulging at me or Helen. His hands firmly cupping his ears but also grasping the shiny steel.



‚ÄúMake the sound again.‚Äù He said faint and breathlessly, ‚ÄúMAKE. THE. SOUND. AGAIN.‚Äù He commanded baring his teeth with a clenched jaw through guttural sounds in his chest and throat.



I had no choice. I still had the food in my mouth and I crunched the rest of it down just so I could squeak out, ‚Äú\*crunch\* what sound?‚Äù



His eyes sprung open and so did his mouth. He turned red like he was about to explode as he started to stick the point of the knife into his ear. His head jarred up and down like a mad bird. He made a cut and his face turned partially relieved as blood began to spurt out and down his neck and sleeve. His head steadied and his eyes began to focus. His eyes began to focus on me.

In a half second, his convulsions stopped and in a motion swifter than my he, he struck me with his free hand. I spit up the cereal into the bowl and started to cry. He picked up both bowls of cereal from the table and then stabbed the box with his kife and he brought them through the kitchen porch door to his gas grill. He tore out the grates and cranked up the gas burns to full and tossed the mostly full box and dumped the bowls into the grill before sticking the knife handle up in the dirt. He cirled like a dog before finding his chaise lounge in the sun and stared off into space with his ear still bleeding. I don't think he moved from that spot the rest of the day but I wasn't about to check on him as I fled to the bathroom, locked myself in, for the rest of the visit.

That was definitely the last time Ben and I stayed with them. As my exposure to them lessened and I aged my trauma had turned to ambivalence but I can definitely recall some of childhood terror.



Update:



I wanted to give an update to the bizarre story I posted about my late Grandfather Leo's apparent bought with some kind of severe misophonia. Well, that's Ben called it when I started asking him if he remembered that day while we were at the funeral. He said Grandpa, although simultaneously nearly deaf, even with hearing aids, had unusually strong reactions to certain noises ‚Äì mostly but not always repetitive human-specific or human initiated sounds like tapping pens, breathing, or in this case, chewing. He chastised me for not knowing this about him but also warned me against putting it in my eulogy.

Ben and I still try to one up each other and I had the perfect thing but I held it back for the moment because I didn't know exactly how to trip him up with it. In fact, at that point, I didn't know how to handle it. You see, I looked up the Quasar Quest cereal and there's definitely a reason it's not on the shelves anymore or why most people don't remember it.

Wikipedia had a short entry about it. Apparently it made a brief slash on the breakfast cereal scene in the late-90s, as I recall but the entire first batch of it was contaminated. Turned out the sparkling additive in the cereal was loaded with some kind of mycotoxin from a mold or fungus which had become more potent during the mixing and shaping process of the grain slurry of the hard cereal. The poison, though, not named on the page, lead to a number of severe hospitalizations and even possibly a handful of deaths across its distribution. It was also possibly highly carcinogenic as most mycotoxins turn out to be.

It's fortunate that Ben and I barely had a few bites but as I thought about it I couldn't help ignore a deeper stranger experience than connection of crunchy cereal and Leo's misophonia attack. We had eaten crunch cereals dozens of times there, a early as the previous week in fact, the only thing different was the apparently tainted cereal that day and my Grandfather's nearly homicidal or suicidal reaction to it which may have spared Ben and I injury or death.

When I finally posited the idea and the link to Ben he panned it and refused to back up some of my account of the incident but hey, what did he know. Or I, for that matter, know, I suppose trauma can do that and nothing loves justification quite like some trauma.

The funeral mass and eulogies went off without incident. Grandma Helen was stiff in her wheel chair and hidden behind window attire. The pallbearers included myself, Ben, my dad, my uncle, and two family friends. One of them, who just called himself Private Bazooka Joe, spoke to me a bit earlier in the visitation. He said he had served with Grandpa Leo in Leo's last tour in Vietnam.

He relayed that Grandpa Leo was controversially known as Sargent Spaz. He was very competent field mechanic and radio technician but anyone who served with him in his unit knew he was prone to fits of talking to himself, asking people to chew gum loudly, and rack the action on their rifles repeatedly when he was around.

Joe himself got his nickname because he was the unit's ‚Äúdesignated chewer‚Äù, their ‚Äúlone gumman‚Äù - there were a couple other puns not as memorable so they're not here.

Some people thought Leo was crazy, totally schizo, even in the rear areas, where those noises would not necessarily give away a position, he said. He told me it was crazy to NOT make those sounds around him. Private B Joe said he owned Leo his life and so did everyone else who served with him ‚Äì unless they were dumb enough to not listen to him when he told them move or duck. Leo had a radar or a premonition for incoming and even accidents. He was so eerily good at predicting shelling some in his unit, the ones who didn't listen, wondered if he was somehow in cahoots with the enemy.

The Private's reminiscence started to turn the gears of fear in my head but I shook them off. I was already somber and in the presence of death and trying to just properly put my apparently long suffering Grandfather to rest. As we started to move with the casket Amazing Grace with full bagpipes started to play as the grand doors out to the hearse opened.



Private Bazooka stood behind me and whispered almost in a non-whisper, ‚Äúthis was one the goddamn thing he could never stand. Nothing good ever came of hearing them. The damn bagpipes!‚Äù



‚ÄúNo!‚Äù I could hear and see Grandma Helen yelling and moving the most she had during the entire event as she spun around in her motorized chair trying to get someone's attention and decrying the funeral home's lack of attention to her specifications, ‚Äúthis was the one thing I promised him and you glorified hole diggers couldn't get it right! Turn this is off now!‚Äù



There were audible gasps that eclipsed the music. I'll be honest. I was focusing much of my effort holding up my end of the casket and this distraction was testing my strength. As I grimaced at the squeaky music and the building weight I couldn't help but stare at Leo.

To my bewilderment I watched in bated breath as something small, like the size of a mosquito crawled out of Grandpa Leo's ear and took off in the air. It was floating, not flying, like a speck of dust or dandelion fluff. It caught my eye for a moment, like you catch the odd eye contact glance down a super market aisle before it zipped towards my face.

I tried to duck and shake it away but I felt it. I felt it buzz into my ear. The buzz turned wet, like a wet tongue, like the wet cereal Ben used to poke into my ear. As flinched and fluttered about I caught sight of Leo again. He head was slightly turned towards me and I swear to the Lord Almighty I saw Leo wink and then sink deeper into a restful pose.

I stuttered and I stammered and then I apologized profusely. I almost dropped Leo. I lost my pallbearer duties and was relegated to escorting Grandma to her van in the procession. It was probably for the best as I could not shake what I saw. I could not shake the fullness of my right ear, the feeling I was underwater on one side of my head, the shock of Leo winking at me and the whatever flew in my ear.

Leo's burial was poorly attended by only a dozen or so out of the hundred who attended the interior part because it was a cold and very blustery day outside. We had to wait at three intersections in the cemetery for the metal signs pointing to name sections to stop swaying I couldn't help fidgeting with my ear as it seemed to warm, cool, go almost numb before growing hot again. I could hear impossible sounds like birds flapping their wings and the roar of a waterfall in that ear. Then the tapping started. It was subtle at first just barely audible over the priest's final words on Leo.

The tapping seemed to have no origin as it engulfed me and started hearing it in both ears. It was becoming so loud and seemed to becoming faster with each passing series of four taps. I must have looked crazy to the priest as I stood beside Grandma, my head spinning in every direction, in bewilderment, searching for the source of that sound. It was so loud that I was shocked no one else could hear it, no one else seemed to be looking for it.



‚ÄúPush her.‚Äù A whispering voice said in my head, vaporous, ethereal, slightly feminine but somehow unreal. ‚ÄúPush her down!‚Äù The voice came again louder, like some one cupping their hand and breathing words from ear into my brain. I shook my head and blinked away some tearing in my eyes and tried to compose myself.



‚ÄúPUSH. HER. DOWN.‚Äù This time it sounded like multiple voices came over the tapping sound. My heard jumped into my throat.



‚ÄúAnd in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ I need you to push Grandma Helen DOWN NOW.‚Äù The priest shouted loud over the wind. ‚ÄúPUSH HER INTO THE DIRT!‚Äù



‚ÄúWhat!?‚Äù I shouted in real time back.



‚ÄúPUSH HER DOWN NOW!!‚Äù Everyone in attendance seemed to shout at me.



I couldn't make the tapping nor the voices stop so I did it. I threw my entire body weight into toppling Grandma Helen from her motorized chair, right there in the cemetery. I fell backward to her side on my ass and lifted myself back up just in time to see one of the metal signs with the cemetery section stamped on them cartwheeling through the air like a razor boomerang right where Grandma Helen's head would have been. The sign, having no more lift, helicoptered to ground a dozen feet away or so.

I helped Grandma Helen back into her chair and Bazooka helped me right her chair. I was embarrassed for it all. I was scared for it all because no there would cop to actually yelling those things to me nor hearing any tapping. Nevertheless I was hero for saving Grandma from potentially fatal strike from the wind driven sign.

We finished burying Leo and Grandma insisted on no medical attention. That was a couple days ago. I got part of my inheritance in the mail. Grandpa Leo in his generosity left me a five figure sum, the war knife he once threatened me with and a handwritten letter dated apparently just after the cereal incident.

I won't relay the entire letter but the jist of it is he hopes I'll never understand the how, what, and why he was compelled to do what he did to me that day.



Update, probably my last:



I need help like right now. The only thing I could find on this thing in my ear is that its called a Cassandra Fly and it took me a week's worth of digging to find that out. I need to get it out. I can't take this anymore.

Aside from the nature of these audio and visual hallucinations and the misophonia ‚Äì what is the moral thing to do with this? Should I be listening to some kind of a repetitive sound all the time to try to invoke this power and potentially save as many as a I can?

The other day I had an attack and I was being compelled to grab a woman on the curb and I didn't, I just got her to turn slightly and she was still struck by a passing car. I stayed with her until the ambulance arrived. I think she'll be okay but I didn't act.

I can see why Grandpa had no hearing, I can see why he tried to dig this bug, this thing out of his ear with a knife. I can see why people thought he was insane. I wonder if he tried to kill himself. I wonder how many times.

I need help. I need to figure out what to do. I'm back on campus in my little coffee shop and they still haven't fixed that goddamn low battery smoke detector. That chirping is in my ear and my ear is telling something terrible is about to happen.

My ear is telling me someone is about to walk into this shop and either has killed many people or is about to. I still have Leo's knife. It is in my bag. The voice is telling, the whole coffee shop is telling me that I'll get one shot, one moment of vulnerability to land my strike and stop this person.

Just because it's been right before doesn't mean it justifies murder, right? Even if its right? Help me, I need help, I may just have a few minutes.

¬†

I woke up to a Sunday morning Facebook message,‚Äù busy tonight?‚Äù,‚Äù Nope, Lucy¬†is with her dad, what‚Äôs up?‚Äù,‚Äù come over tonight, let the punky be happy‚Äù,‚Äù alright man, I‚Äôll come over after 7.‚Äù¬†¬†¬†¬† 	¬†

January 12, 2020, just over four years ago now. I‚Äôm in my rusted out, light blue, ‚Äô95 Toyota Corolla, freezing behind the wheel and waiting for the heat to kick on as I drive to the Speedway on the corner of 98^(th) and 35. The whole of the short drive to the gas station I‚Äôm having a conversation with myself, right out loud, breathing it alive into the frigid air, ¬†‚ÄùI know the house is fucked up, abandoned after a foreclosure, and now they‚Äôre squatting in it. Nothing new. It will be nice to see some old familiar faces and be back in the first place I genuinely called home in Minnesota- a lot has changed in 10 years, a whole fucking lot, man.‚Äù ¬†By the end of this embarrassing little monologue, championing my own personal growth against theirs, I‚Äôm sliding into the first parking space on the side of the little red and white building. My already severely beaten and scarred bumper takes another one for the team as it becomes one with the curb. Throwing her into park, I jam the keys into my pocket, and pop out of the car. Rusted metal wire that looks like stitching which holds the bumper in place bites into the calf of my pant as I brush past to enter the little superette, only to start immediately pacing the aisles searching for supplies that are the perfect merger between affordable (I mean cheap) and thoughtful (I mean cloying). A half-gallon of off-brand orange juice, sugar-free energy drink, two bags of sweet chili Doritos, (gotta make sure to get the vegan ones for ‚Äôinclusivity‚Äô even though they‚Äôre still dumpster diving for fun) and a pack of unfiltered Camel cigarettes. There is a skeletal man pacing the parking lot out front by the gas pumps, those telling sunken cheeks and eyes.‚Äù Meth heads, am I right?‚Äù The cashier, an unmemorable human being, nods then pushes the bag and cigarettes toward me. 		¬†

The small, cellophane wrapped rectangle feels like it can‚Äôt wait for me to undress it, so I oblige the moment I‚Äôm out the door. Fumble for a lighter in the cold, combust, inhale. For no reason I feel smug knowing I have never smoked a cigarette in my car. My fingertips are beginning to feel the deep kiss of the cold so after a few drags I deposit the butt into a coffee-colored slush puddle and saddle back up in old reliable. Put it into reverse and kick at the gas to get it moving, I find myself absentmindedly stabbing at the radio to get my favorite station, 740 AM-WDGY, buzzing through my blown-out speakers so I can disassociate to the oldies and seemingly teleport to my destination.¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† 				Twenty minutes later I‚Äôm fading back to reality as I try to find the spot closest to the house to park because not only do my wind chapped cheeks not want to brave the cold any longer than they must, but I am also in an area most people avoid after dark. Piled high on the sides of the road the snow packed manmade mountains make this difficult, so I gun it up onto one of the piles so that my car is practically at a 45-degree angle to the ground, but also sufficiently out of the street to allow enough room for me to not be sideswiped.¬† At this angle as soon as I open the door it slams itself into the ice-packed ground getting stuck so that I'll have to kick the shit out of it to dislodge it. I kick it twice with the bottom of my foot and I see the old paint splinter under the blows. Lock the door, unlock the trunk. Nestled between a mound of deliciously musty paperbacks and two glass gallon jars that once housed bar olives, there are three sleeping bags, the middle one swaddling a 1.75-liter bottle of Tito‚Äôs vodka, which I know will be emptied quickly. Bottle under arm, the trunk is slammed shut, and I half skate, half stagger down the icy street. Not a simple feat in the world's slipperiest soled pair of oxblood loafers.¬†

¬†I‚Äôm at the corner of 26^(th) and Cedar in South Minneapolis, the house abuts Little Earth,‚Äù the Native projects‚Äù, always seemed like a slap in the face to them, but it is not my place to rage for anyone but myself. The wooden fence is peeling light brown paint, you can see the grey, weathered wood beneath. A few of the crowns of the slats have been smashed or sheared off. The gate is hanging cartoonishly by one hinge, I push it open (SCReeeEEECH!) and ascend the three steps to the porch and front door. The door, it is not exactly closed, like someone had absentmindedly slid their hand across and down the wood as they entered, already engrossed in conversation, but not fully pulling it shut. There is loud music playing from behind the door, Misery (touted as ‚ÄúMinneapolis ‚Äòs oldest crust punk band ‚Äú), I can hear the scratch of the record player, its own personality. ¬†I toe the door wide open and step into a night that will stay with me forever.¬†¬†

As I step over the threshold, there‚Äôs a body looming in the entryway with its back to me, they spin around, looking spooked. We do not know each other. They relax and move aside when they see the bottle of alcohol I have in tow. I push past a dirty sheet that is tacked up in the doorway between the entryway hall and the kitchen. Some faces, both familiar and un, greet me from a semi-circle around a butcher‚Äôs block island in the center of the kitchen, I smile in response, saying nothing. I‚Äôm too busy taking stock of not only the sight, but the smell of all the crusty dishes piled over a foot high in and next to the sink.¬†¬†

‚ÄúAye Sarita!‚Äù I‚Äôm snapped out of the judgement as I hear my name from the dining room and my buddy, Galbo, bounds in to grab me. He‚Äôs a very tall and lanky, yet well-muscled, 45-year-old Brazilian, with a neon green cockscomb of a mohawk and the words ‚ÄúNIGHT‚Äù and ‚ÄúMARE‚Äù tattooed on his eyelids. He takes my belongings, sets them on a half-empty end table and scoops me around the waist, kissing me with hot cigarette breath. ‚ÄúChot time?‚Äù he asks me, fully knowing the answer as we‚Äôd spent a lot of our time together at the bottom of a bottle. We begin to pass the bottle around, taking pulls of vodka followed by swallows of orange juice. Another man I do not recognize is putting together a jigsaw puzzle on the dining table, someone else is sitting on a tattered armchair playing DJ, Galbo growls at them to put on ‚ÄúBorn to Be Alive.‚Äù¬†

‚ÄúPeople ask me why¬†  
I never find a place to stop¬†  
And settle down, down, down¬†  
But I never wanted all those things¬†  
People need to justify¬†  
Their lives, lives, lives¬†

You see, you were born¬†

An acquaintance named Amanda pours in from behind the dirty bedsheet and a blast of cold air rushes in around her, ‚ÄúHey, what‚Äôs up, what‚Äôs up, what‚Äôs up!‚Äù She always repeats herself like that, never interested in the answer.¬† She throws her backpack onto the dining table upsetting the strange man‚Äôs puzzle, he appears unfazed, and I realize that maybe he wasn‚Äôt actually doing the puzzle to begin with but was rather just situated in front of it. While she is rifling around in her very dirty knapsack, I go into the other room with Galbo and get caught up on what exactly is happening at the house these days. We have known each other almost two decades and his extremely thick Portuguese accent is still hard for me to navigate, but it makes me listen more intently. He tells briefly about how the house was foreclosed on and the previous owner just abandoned it, the old roommates stayed, and some new people filtered in and out, but after a while the home fell deeper into disrepair and it was evident from the outside. The neighborhood gangs knew the situation and used it to their advantage. One night some Natives from Little Bear¬†took it upon themselves to smash in the back door and commandeer the front room for a heroin selling outfit, this went on for three months before they went as quickly as they came.¬†¬†

After our quick rap sesh, we rejoin the group and begin to throw darts at a dartboard in the living room for a few minutes before Amanda appears with a plate of cocaine. We take turns passing a filthy dollar bill around for a few minutes before Amanda asks the room if anyone wants to buy more drugs with her. A voice pipes up, it‚Äôs the phantom jigsawer. A telephone call is made, and we all make our way upstairs to the living/sleeping quarters.¬†¬†

There are four bedrooms upstairs, two staircases- one on either end of the floor, and one bathroom. When I lived there many years ago, my room was at the back end of the house, next to the bathroom. Tonight, we are gathering at the front of the house, the bedroom directly above the living room. There is a lot of detritus on the floor and a coffee table that is wedged in front of a futon that doesn't look like it ever saw a good day. There is also a mattress in an alcove on the other side of the room. Latin American punk rock records litter almost every surface, or at least the album sleeves. Someone switches on a record player and it scratches, the needle is lifted and reset, Donna Summer starts playing, and the giant Brazilian begins to sing along, ‚ÄúI feel love, I feel love, I feel love‚Äù At this point I‚Äôm buzzing a little from the alcohol and feeling too confident from the coke so I start to sing along with my friend, ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs so good, it‚Äôs so good, it‚Äôs so good‚Äù I hear a sound of plastic tapping on plastic and know someone else is cutting out more coke, we pass it around again and smoke and sing and laugh together.¬† Maybe going home isn‚Äôt so bad after all.¬†¬†

Shortly after a younger white guy with dreadlocks, a green hoodie with the front pocket half falling off and a pair of brown Carhart work pants enters the room. I have never seen him before, but I can tell right away from his demeanor that he has the drugs. A moment later a young girl walks through the door, her I do recognize, and I am momentarily shocked- she is the now ‚Äúadult‚Äù younger sister of an old friend who ran in the same circles as the people I‚Äôm seated with now. ‚ÄúHi Sparrow, do you remember me?‚Äù ‚ÄúYeah, you were one of Alton‚Äôs friends, right? Sorry I don‚Äôt remember your name, but I know I know you‚Äù ‚ÄúYep, you got it! I haven't seen you since you were probably ten! My name is Sarah, crazy where you run into people‚Äù I laugh, and we chat a bit. She tells me she is a stripper now, which I could tell by the way she looked when she came in. I had, after all, worked in nearly every strip club Minneapolis had to offer to get through my 20‚Äôs. Never stripping, only waitressing. My friends always liked to joke about that since I moonlit as a Domme during that time as well. She didn‚Äôt have to be dressed skimpy for me to know, in fact, quite the opposite; pajama pants, disgustingly moist UGG boots, and a puffer jacket with a furry hood. It is the smell that really gives her away, the cheapest drugstore body spray struggling to cover up the smell of a blunt that has been put out and re-lit more than once. Despite my judgement, she is sweet and clings to me throughout the rest of the evening, as I am one of the only women and we share the connection of her brother.¬†¬†

After a few hours, the room is thick with both cigarette and marijuana smoke, the bags and bottles have run dry, and everyone is becoming restless. Sparrow and I exchange numbers, both knowing we‚Äôll probably never use them, and she takes leave with the dreadlocked boy who I find out is her beau. Amanda slinks away with Jigsaw man, and I am left alone in the room with my Galbo. I tell him that I am staying over, as I am too inebriated to drive, and I want to be responsible. It is past 3a.m. I dig a half-smoked cigarette butt out of a makeshift ashtray and light it in the pale dark of the room, I gag on the drag and put it immediately out. The room cools quickly, as it is no longer heated by our hot breath and wagging tongues, I crawl into the bed in the alcove. My friend is there and turns to put his arm over me, he is naked. I can feel his flaccid penis push onto my leg as we find the space in time to force ourselves to sleep and warm our bodies together like homeless dogs.¬†¬†

Almost as soon as my eyes shut for the last time, they are violently startled back open. BANG, BANG, CRAAAAAAAACK...‚ÄùMINNEAPOLIS PD!‚Äù...loud footsteps, yelling, the footsteps are bounding up the front staircase, my friend puts his hand over my mouth and pulls the stinking, woolen blanket completely over our heads, ‚ÄúSssshhh Sarita, it‚Äôs okay, don‚Äôt be afraid, don‚Äôt move, se liga que os gamb√© t√° vindo‚Äù Before I know it, the footsteps are in the room and I‚Äôm buzzing with electric fear like I have never known.¬† I‚Äôm going to die, here in this bed, I know it. I‚Äôm going to be shot as I lay here, and they‚Äôll say they were afraid for their life, and I will never get to say anything again.  I, with my Oxford collar, Oxford commas, and Oxford shoes, will be put down like a nuisance animal, because that‚Äôs what I am.¬†¬†

But wait, I‚Äôm not, and the covers are ripped off by a powerful hand as they shout, ‚ÄúThere are two more up here‚Äù to their compatriots downstairs. I‚Äôm being commanded to the floor, to get on my belly, face down in the garbage. Suddenly there is a cold and wet boot pressing down on me, between my shoulders, snow from between the grooves of the boot melting onto the hot skin of my back and dripping down either side of me. My hands are yanked back and together and placed in zip ties. There is a flurry of activity in the room as more cops than I could count at the time begin to tear it apart. My friend is right next to me on the ground, his hands in the same backward prayer pose, I turn my head and he is already looking at me, ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt be scared Sarita, they‚Äôre just pigs‚Äù he says to comfort me, but I can barely breathe, let alone comprehend a veiled kind word.¬†¬†

The cops are dumping the contents of my Louis Vuitton purse on the ground next to my shoulder, I know they are looking for drugs. To their disappointment, they find none, they do however, find ID cards with three different last names in my purse. I see the female officer showing this discovery to her partner. By this time, I‚Äôve caught my breath, and steadied my mind a bit, I know I‚Äôve done nothing wrong technically, I know the no-knock warrant they are serving is not for me, I know I have no drugs on me, I know my car insurance is up to date and I have never had as much as a speeding ticket. Before they can ask about the ID‚Äôs, a voice from the living room summons for us to be brought down to them.¬†¬†

We‚Äôre both yanked backward and up to our feet, the pigs guide us down the staircase to the dining table, the puzzle is still there, and I‚Äôm now placed at the table in front of it. My friend is taken to the living room, which I can see from my seat. Someone cuts our zip ties and places us in traditional handcuffs, the metal bites into my weak wrists. I laugh at this and the other people at the table look at me askance. ‚ÄúWhat could be funny?‚Äù I know that‚Äôs what they're thinking, but it‚Äôs nothing at all, just a nervous titter I couldn‚Äôt stifle. ‚ÄúDid someone tell a fucking joke?‚Äù one of the nastier looking cops grunts in my direction, I avoid his gaze and begin to stare into the jigsaw puzzle on the table.¬†¬†

I cannot tell how many officers are in the house, but I‚Äôve already counted five. They‚Äôre ransacking the place, ripping out drawers and tearing apart the couch cushions, not to mention the front door they kicked off its hinges which is laying neatly in the entryway letting all the winter air in. It‚Äôs around 8a.m. now. The cops in the front room are interrogating my friend because they are certain he is the Native American heroin kingpin who had been using the front room as his personal dope wholesale warehouse for the preceding three months. He is not, but they don‚Äôt know their assholes from their elbows, so they continue to press him.¬†¬†

I observe until I‚Äôm approached by two other cops, they‚Äôre holding my purse and ID‚Äôs, ‚ÄúWho are you?‚Äù ‚ÄúMy name is Sarah Leyba‚Äù ‚ÄúWhy do you have ID‚Äôs bearing the names Sarah Walter¬†and Sarah Zumbach? Are you a fugitive?‚Äù (Like I‚Äôd fucking give myself away if I were) ‚ÄúI‚Äôve been married a few times, what of it? Zumbach¬†is my maiden name, I was married to my first husband for a total of six months, so there‚Äôs the Walter, and my current husband is Leyba‚Äù They seem unimpressed with the explanation but don‚Äôt bother me again. All I can think is, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not going to make it to pick my daughter up from school today, what a horrible mother‚Äù Not that I was horrible for being handcuffed in a traphouse though, that did not matter to me at all. One of the men at the table has a warrant out for his arrest and they remove him from the table and the house, shoving him in the back of a cop car that I can see through a cracked side window.¬†¬†

The frenzy seems to be dying down, they are now making room on the kitchen counter and laying things out that they have gathered from around the house; a meth pipe, a pound of weed, a few used syringes, stray shells to a gun that no one could tell you the whereabouts of, a knife, a blowdart gun, a scale with coke residue on it. They‚Äôre still hassling my buddy because they can‚Äôt find any ID for him, so they start asking us at the table what his name is- we all answer the same ‚ÄúGalbo Ramisis‚Äù the cops seem annoyed because they think we are somehow in cahoots. What they stupidly don‚Äôt know is that he‚Äôs undocumented and they could have a field day if they really wanted. One of the officers signs the warrant and walks around waving it in the air. They leave all the paraphernalia on the counter, which surprises me. Almost as quickly as they came, they went.¬†¬†

After releasing us all from our cuffs, save for the man they stuffed into the back of their car, as what I am assuming was almost a trophy for them, they filed out and left the warrant with a few business cards on the stinking counter. ‚ÄúAt least they left the weed‚Äù says Jigsaw man, which garners a few strained laughs. We all begin to come back to life. I go upstairs to gather my belongings which had been strewn here, there, and everywhere. ‚ÄúTesticles, spectacles, wallet, and watch‚Äù I sing to myself as I put my shoes on and hold my car keys, they are wet from the snow that had been slopped all over the floor. I hear someone heaving the heavy, wooden door up from the floor downstairs and dragging it over to rest against the front wall, next to where it should have been doing its only job of providing entrance and exit.¬†¬†

I make my way back downstairs and ask if they need any help putting the house back together after Tornado MPD had ripped through. They declined my offer and we all said our goodbyes and hugged. I feel like together we had somehow defiantly beaten the police. I trudge back out into the snow, my shoes slipping on the ice. I carefully open the door to my rusty tin can and gingerly set myself down. (TURN) ‚ÄúWhat the hell just happened?‚Äù I whisper this to no one, and I can see the words escaping my lips as whisps of hot breath into the freezing air. I start the car, stab at the radio to turn on my oldies and again I am magically transported to 94, over by the Minneapolis-Saint Paul airport. Suddenly I snap to and gasp almost comically, ‚Äúwhat the fuck, What The Fuck, WHAT THE FUCK?‚Äù I repeat it over.¬†¬†

I finally pull into my driveway, in front of my little single-family home, in very manicured Eden Prairie. I walk up my front steps, to my own front door, on its own hinges and let myself inside. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs no place like home‚Äù I whisper this to myself and laugh idiotically. I had never felt at home in my own home until this very moment, my life had shifted, from the place I used to belong to the place I belong now- lightyears away, 12 miles down the highway. I put on the coffeepot and squeeze myself some fresh orange juice. There are no dirty dishes on the counter here.¬†",1,1734108504.0,shortstories,1,1.0,False

I got some bad news the other day. My grandfather Leo from the Kenner side of the family had passed away. I knew he had been sick but I suppose my thoughts and prayers for him were lost in my busy undergraduate life. I think I took seeing him this Christmas for granted.

My mother volun-told me to have something to say about him at the funeral. I am not a successful public speaker, My sweat soaked through my t-shirt at my last research project presentation in my sociology class. The last thing I wanted to do was write and give a eulogy in front the families.

I sat down in my little cozy campus coffee shoe and started to bash keys on my laptop ‚Äì mostly unremarkable boiler plate kinds of things. I read it back to myself and I started to think it sounded downright disrespectful. It started to sound like a paper I'd occasionally have to write at one in the morning.

Maybe it was the particular roast of coffee I was drinking, maybe it was low din of a dozen conversations carrying through the air but it was probably the jaw grinding chirp of a smoke detector low on battery somewhere nearby but hidden from sight that really got me thinking about Grandpa Leo.

When my brother Ben and I were much younger, say in somewhere between seven and ten or so, we'd often visit Grandma Helen and Grandpa Leo in the summer for daycare or whenever our parents needed a break from us. My best memories of both of them are from those days and I suppose it is funny how I've kept their appearance from ten or twelve years ago as how they look and feel now even though they were in considerably worse shape a year ago when I saw them around Christmas.

Grandma Helen with her silver curly perm, cherry lipstick and perfume to match, and a light pleasant attitude despite her occasional bouts with a wobbly unsteady gait. She could warm up the deck of the Titanic with her smile and her habit of slapping her knees when crowing out her signature wheezing laugh. Despite her age, being senior to Leo by a few years, lifted a room like a blooming fruit tree in spring.

If Helen was the blooming side of a perpetual spring, Leo was the gray half frozen half melted slush dropping like elephant dung out of the wheel wells of your car. He always seemed to have his arms crossed across his chest and what dress in a camouflage of flannel matching wherever he was or was expected to be. His fading ashen charcoal pants matched the color and lack of care put into maintaining his paper thin comb-over. His eyes were usually either mostly closed or unfocused through thick glasses. Once he took up a spot on the couch or dinner table it was difficult to dislodge him. He rare spoke much, but when he did, everyone listened, partially because his roar lived up the lion in Leo, but also because he was terribly challenged at hearing.

All of his appearance matched the unsteady but rocky existence of that slush. He didn't care if he was frozen or melty but kick him and you'll soon need more ice for your foot. He was half here and half gone and I think that's how he liked to be as settled into old age. He was a veteran of three wars and as a successful electrical engineer, he had seen and done more things than maybe three life times worth and he was over living but didn't want to be totally rude or overt about it. Because I knew he could be rude, scary, down right dangerous.

A very specific memory was dusted off and dropped into the forefront of my brain. It was a nuclear bomb had gone off and flash fried all of my pleasant memories of spending time with Leo and Helen as a child. I realized there was a reason Ben and I stopped going there.

It had something to do with Quasar Quest breakfast cereal ‚Äì see it was this cereal which was a lot like Lucky Charms but had round and ringed spherical shapes for planets and stars instead of that bits that looked like punctuation like in Lucky Charms, and of course, sparkling marshmallow bits that resembled nebula, galaxies, and well, quasars.

The more I thought about it the more I recalled that Dad dropped us off with a box of it we begged him for from the grocery store he had to visit on the way to the Kenners. We had Grandma pour bowls for us ‚Äì I liked mine dry but Ben would always try to push mushy cereal in my ears while we sat on our bellies to watch the summer morning cartoon line up on their wooden cased antiquated tv set. Grandma sat with us in the den, reading magazines with reading glasses in her recliner chair while Grandpa was, well, in the adjacent room, his workshop surrounded by tools and his war memorabilia, enjoying what we later learned was his morning eye opener whiskey.

Of course, I should be honest, Ben tried to stick wet cereal in my ears but I would chomp as loudly as possible with my dry crunchy cereal in his ears ‚Äì among other forms of brotherly love. That day was no exception. What was exceptional was Grandpa Leo who stirred from his workshop and came to the threshold. Back lit by the workshop lighting, Leo stood there, staring at me as I chomped in Ben's ear. Leo, as I said, usually muted and expressionless, stood there red in the face might as well be shooting me with lasers from his eyes like I called him the string of nastiest words in the world.



‚ÄúHelen!‚Äù His eyes finally lifted off of mine to Grandpa who sat behind me in the corner, ‚Äúwhat the HELL are you and these kids watchin?‚Äù His voice cracked slightly at hell.



Helen peered down from her magazine, ‚Äújust some cartoons...why?‚Äù



‚ÄúWell, I heard Pete over there with his gosh darn cereal crunching then I heard...well...I'm not going to use that kind of language again in front of the kids, Helen.‚Äù



Helen hid a bit of a struggle moving herself from the chair to threshold where she whispered with Leo. I only heard the tail end of the conversation which ended with Leo agreeing to take his hearing aid out and shut the door. I saw Grandma Helen turn with eyes high and lips puckered together in distress as she weaved her way back to her chair, back into her magazines.

I remember asking her if I did something wrong because I had never seen him like that before and I had seen my Dad look that way a few times when he was mad at me so I had the fear smoldering.



‚ÄúNo, well, not Grandpa, he's both hard of hearing and very sensitive to certain sounds, but you shouldn't antagonize your brother like that. Eat your food in a civilized way, young man.‚Äù



I fished another couple of planets and comets into my spoon and shoveled them into my mouth like some super weapon out of Star Wars. I barely had enough time to make a fourth full chewing motion when I heard loud metallic bang from the workshop along with Leo's cursing roar of ‚ÄúGODDAMNIT!‚Äù



I was so started by the sound and Leo's voice the food literally dropped out of my mouth and back to the bowl. Ben and I gasped and turned towards Helen who's mouth hung open and eyes cinched tight, a face of terror masked with surprise and concern. Helen groaned as she flung her magazine to the floor and waddled over to the workshop door.



Within seconds all I could hear coming from the workshop was ‚ÄúTHEY ARE OFF!‚Äù I don't remember the in between probably because Grandpa Leo It's like, it's like a goddamn bell ringing in my ears and its not ringing. It's saying something. It's saying terrible terrible things...things I haven't heard since I was in war! It's the sound of nails on a chalk board and machine guns and the sound of...the sound of...the boys...the boys...Helen!‚Äù



Helen's foot pressed the door shut and she turned on the workshop's vacuum fan to cover up the rest of their conversation.

When she stepped back out her face was solemn and serious. ‚ÄúC'mon upstairs, finish your food there and then we come back and watch tv?‚Äù

I remember Ben resisting but given the chance I ran up those stairs to the kitchen with my cereal and proceeded to chew away. I was a bit nervous about it I remember that for sure but I was reassured as Ben and Grandma made their way up the stairs. I concentrated on eating for only a moment as Grandma walked in, Grandpa Leo was following directly behind her with six inch knife in hand.

I almost choked on my food as he came in wobbling, his hands clutching his ears and his war knife ‚Äì I couldn't tell you which kind.



‚ÄúMake it stop Helen! Whatever it is make it stop!‚Äù He had his eyes clamped shut as he gestured with the point of the knife towards his ear and then towards me.



‚ÄúLeo! Stop it! It didn't work before and I won't now!‚Äù



‚ÄúIt won't stop screaming in my head!‚Äù He cried out.



Helen made her way towards the phone, ‚ÄúLeo, we need to call...uh...someone...okay, this is the worst its been in...‚Äù



‚ÄúNo!‚Äù Leo was able to slice the code of the corded phone with one slash. ‚ÄúNo! It's telling me.‚Äù It's me what to do.‚Äù



‚ÄúWhat. What is it?‚Äù



‚ÄúIt's fading. It's fading. It's fading but it says. It says, Kill the Boys. Kill the Boys. Kill the boys.‚Äù He started to whimper.



I was already pressing my way deep into my seat wondering whether or not run, wondering if I should try to get help from Ben. But he was only two years older than I and it dawned on me that Helen would be easily overpowered even without the knife. As I said frozen in terror Ben scurried off into the house leaving me there alone.



Leo was in severe distress as he wobbled between the table and the cabinets and the fridge in a frantic circle. He chest heaved and his breath was short. His transitioned between clenched shut and bulging at me or Helen. His hands firmly cupping his ears but also grasping the shiny steel.



‚ÄúMake the sound again.‚Äù He said faint and breathlessly, ‚ÄúMAKE. THE. SOUND. AGAIN.‚Äù He commanded baring his teeth with a clenched jaw through guttural sounds in his chest and throat.



I had no choice. I still had the food in my mouth and I crunched the rest of it down just so I could squeak out, ‚Äú\*crunch\* what sound?‚Äù



His eyes sprung open and so did his mouth. He turned red like he was about to explode as he started to stick the point of the knife into his ear. His head jarred up and down like a mad bird. He made a cut and his face turned partially relieved as blood began to spurt out and down his neck and sleeve. His head steadied and his eyes began to focus. His eyes began to focus on me.

In a half second, his convulsions stopped and in a motion swifter than my he, he struck me with his free hand. I spit up the cereal into the bowl and started to cry. He picked up both bowls of cereal from the table and then stabbed the box with his kife and he brought them through the kitchen porch door to his gas grill. He tore out the grates and cranked up the gas burns to full and tossed the mostly full box and dumped the bowls into the grill before sticking the knife handle up in the dirt. He cirled like a dog before finding his chaise lounge in the sun and stared off into space with his ear still bleeding. I don't think he moved from that spot the rest of the day but I wasn't about to check on him as I fled to the bathroom, locked myself in, for the rest of the visit.

That was definitely the last time Ben and I stayed with them. As my exposure to them lessened and I aged my trauma had turned to ambivalence but I can definitely recall some of childhood terror.



Update:



I wanted to give an update to the bizarre story I posted about my late Grandfather Leo's apparent bought with some kind of severe misophonia. Well, that's Ben called it when I started asking him if he remembered that day while we were at the funeral. He said Grandpa, although simultaneously nearly deaf, even with hearing aids, had unusually strong reactions to certain noises ‚Äì mostly but not always repetitive human-specific or human initiated sounds like tapping pens, breathing, or in this case, chewing. He chastised me for not knowing this about him but also warned me against putting it in my eulogy.

Ben and I still try to one up each other and I had the perfect thing but I held it back for the moment because I didn't know exactly how to trip him up with it. In fact, at that point, I didn't know how to handle it. You see, I looked up the Quasar Quest cereal and there's definitely a reason it's not on the shelves anymore or why most people don't remember it.

Wikipedia had a short entry about it. Apparently it made a brief slash on the breakfast cereal scene in the late-90s, as I recall but the entire first batch of it was contaminated. Turned out the sparkling additive in the cereal was loaded with some kind of mycotoxin from a mold or fungus which had become more potent during the mixing and shaping process of the grain slurry of the hard cereal. The poison, though, not named on the page, lead to a number of severe hospitalizations and even possibly a handful of deaths across its distribution. It was also possibly highly carcinogenic as most mycotoxins turn out to be.

It's fortunate that Ben and I barely had a few bites but as I thought about it I couldn't help ignore a deeper stranger experience than connection of crunchy cereal and Leo's misophonia attack. We had eaten crunch cereals dozens of times there, a early as the previous week in fact, the only thing different was the apparently tainted cereal that day and my Grandfather's nearly homicidal or suicidal reaction to it which may have spared Ben and I injury or death.

When I finally posited the idea and the link to Ben he panned it and refused to back up some of my account of the incident but hey, what did he know. Or I, for that matter, know, I suppose trauma can do that and nothing loves justification quite like some trauma.

The funeral mass and eulogies went off without incident. Grandma Helen was stiff in her wheel chair and hidden behind window attire. The pallbearers included myself, Ben, my dad, my uncle, and two family friends. One of them, who just called himself Private Bazooka Joe, spoke to me a bit earlier in the visitation. He said he had served with Grandpa Leo in Leo's last tour in Vietnam.

He relayed that Grandpa Leo was controversially known as Sargent Spaz. He was very competent field mechanic and radio technician but anyone who served with him in his unit knew he was prone to fits of talking to himself, asking people to chew gum loudly, and rack the action on their rifles repeatedly when he was around.

Joe himself got his nickname because he was the unit's ‚Äúdesignated chewer‚Äù, their ‚Äúlone gumman‚Äù - there were a couple other puns not as memorable so they're not here.

Some people thought Leo was crazy, totally schizo, even in the rear areas, where those noises would not necessarily give away a position, he said. He told me it was crazy to NOT make those sounds around him. Private B Joe said he owned Leo his life and so did everyone else who served with him ‚Äì unless they were dumb enough to not listen to him when he told them move or duck. Leo had a radar or a premonition for incoming and even accidents. He was so eerily good at predicting shelling some in his unit, the ones who didn't listen, wondered if he was somehow in cahoots with the enemy.

The Private's reminiscence started to turn the gears of fear in my head but I shook them off. I was already somber and in the presence of death and trying to just properly put my apparently long suffering Grandfather to rest. As we started to move with the casket Amazing Grace with full bagpipes started to play as the grand doors out to the hearse opened.



Private Bazooka stood behind me and whispered almost in a non-whisper, ‚Äúthis was one the goddamn thing he could never stand. Nothing good ever came of hearing them. The damn bagpipes!‚Äù



‚ÄúNo!‚Äù I could hear and see Grandma Helen yelling and moving the most she had during the entire event as she spun around in her motorized chair trying to get someone's attention and decrying the funeral home's lack of attention to her specifications, ‚Äúthis was the one thing I promised him and you glorified hole diggers couldn't get it right! Turn this is off now!‚Äù



There were audible gasps that eclipsed the music. I'll be honest. I was focusing much of my effort holding up my end of the casket and this distraction was testing my strength. As I grimaced at the squeaky music and the building weight I couldn't help but stare at Leo.

To my bewilderment I watched in bated breath as something small, like the size of a mosquito crawled out of Grandpa Leo's ear and took off in the air. It was floating, not flying, like a speck of dust or dandelion fluff. It caught my eye for a moment, like you catch the odd eye contact glance down a super market aisle before it zipped towards my face.

I tried to duck and shake it away but I felt it. I felt it buzz into my ear. The buzz turned wet, like a wet tongue, like the wet cereal Ben used to poke into my ear. As flinched and fluttered about I caught sight of Leo again. He head was slightly turned towards me and I swear to the Lord Almighty I saw Leo wink and then sink deeper into a restful pose.

I stuttered and I stammered and then I apologized profusely. I almost dropped Leo. I lost my pallbearer duties and was relegated to escorting Grandma to her van in the procession. It was probably for the best as I could not shake what I saw. I could not shake the fullness of my right ear, the feeling I was underwater on one side of my head, the shock of Leo winking at me and the whatever flew in my ear.

Leo's burial was poorly attended by only a dozen or so out of the hundred who attended the interior part because it was a cold and very blustery day outside. We had to wait at three intersections in the cemetery for the metal signs pointing to name sections to stop swaying I couldn't help fidgeting with my ear as it seemed to warm, cool, go almost numb before growing hot again. I could hear impossible sounds like birds flapping their wings and the roar of a waterfall in that ear. Then the tapping started. It was subtle at first just barely audible over the priest's final words on Leo.

The tapping seemed to have no origin as it engulfed me and started hearing it in both ears. It was becoming so loud and seemed to becoming faster with each passing series of four taps. I must have looked crazy to the priest as I stood beside Grandma, my head spinning in every direction, in bewilderment, searching for the source of that sound. It was so loud that I was shocked no one else could hear it, no one else seemed to be looking for it.



‚ÄúPush her.‚Äù A whispering voice said in my head, vaporous, ethereal, slightly feminine but somehow unreal. ‚ÄúPush her down!‚Äù The voice came again louder, like some one cupping their hand and breathing words from ear into my brain. I shook my head and blinked away some tearing in my eyes and tried to compose myself.



‚ÄúPUSH. HER. DOWN.‚Äù This time it sounded like multiple voices came over the tapping sound. My heard jumped into my throat.



‚ÄúAnd in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ I need you to push Grandma Helen DOWN NOW.‚Äù The priest shouted loud over the wind. ‚ÄúPUSH HER INTO THE DIRT!‚Äù



‚ÄúWhat!?‚Äù I shouted in real time back.



‚ÄúPUSH HER DOWN NOW!!‚Äù Everyone in attendance seemed to shout at me.



I couldn't make the tapping nor the voices stop so I did it. I threw my entire body weight into toppling Grandma Helen from her motorized chair, right there in the cemetery. I fell backward to her side on my ass and lifted myself back up just in time to see one of the metal signs with the cemetery section stamped on them cartwheeling through the air like a razor boomerang right where Grandma Helen's head would have been. The sign, having no more lift, helicoptered to ground a dozen feet away or so.

I helped Grandma Helen back into her chair and Bazooka helped me right her chair. I was embarrassed for it all. I was scared for it all because no there would cop to actually yelling those things to me nor hearing any tapping. Nevertheless I was hero for saving Grandma from potentially fatal strike from the wind driven sign.

We finished burying Leo and Grandma insisted on no medical attention. That was a couple days ago. I got part of my inheritance in the mail. Grandpa Leo in his generosity left me a five figure sum, the war knife he once threatened me with and a handwritten letter dated apparently just after the cereal incident.

I won't relay the entire letter but the jist of it is he hopes I'll never understand the how, what, and why he was compelled to do what he did to me that day.



Update, probably my last:



I need help like right now. The only thing I could find on this thing in my ear is that its called a Cassandra Fly and it took me a week's worth of digging to find that out. I need to get it out. I can't take this anymore.

Aside from the nature of these audio and visual hallucinations and the misophonia ‚Äì what is the moral thing to do with this? Should I be listening to some kind of a repetitive sound all the time to try to invoke this power and potentially save as many as a I can?

The other day I had an attack and I was being compelled to grab a woman on the curb and I didn't, I just got her to turn slightly and she was still struck by a passing car. I stayed with her until the ambulance arrived. I think she'll be okay but I didn't act.

I can see why Grandpa had no hearing, I can see why he tried to dig this bug, this thing out of his ear with a knife. I can see why people thought he was insane. I wonder if he tried to kill himself. I wonder how many times.

I need help. I need to figure out what to do. I'm back on campus in my little coffee shop and they still haven't fixed that goddamn low battery smoke detector. That chirping is in my ear and my ear is telling something terrible is about to happen.

My ear is telling me someone is about to walk into this shop and either has killed many people or is about to. I still have Leo's knife. It is in my bag. The voice is telling, the whole coffee shop is telling me that I'll get one shot, one moment of vulnerability to land my strike and stop this person.

Just because it's been right before doesn't mean it justifies murder, right? Even if its right? Help me, I need help, I may just have a few minutes.

The Goddess Hestia clearly expresses her dislike for Freya, recalling how she threatened the lives of Lili and others in order to manipulate Hestia, as well as mentioning the damage done to Bell. In a very explicit way, Hestia makes her hatred for Freya clear, saying that she will despise her for all eternity.

However, Hestia also questions Freya:  
**""Why are you so obsessed with Bell? Is it because you're the goddess of love? Or do you really love him with all your heart? What makes you take such risks? What is the real purpose of all this?""**

Despite all these questions, Freya doesn't give any answers.

# 1-3. About the War Game:

Hestia asked Bell if he wanted to leave the decision in the hands of the person most affected by the whole incident, i.e. the person who had suffered the most and therefore had the greatest right to decide what to do.

#1-4. At 1:15, after Freya says ""As you wish"", there was originally one more sentence:

    ""Although I'm not sure what you mean by 'true'.""

# 1-5. Scene in which Hestia shouts ""Let's fight in the War Game!"":

In the original material, this scene was described as:

    ""A cry that resounded through the heavens, a declaration that echoed throughout the world.""  

However, the adaptation made it sound much more ordinary and unimpressive.

# 2. Continuation of the story with Ryuu:

As the plot approaches Ryuu, she is holding a small fragment of wood - a piece of her old wooden sword, which has been broken.

She decides to set off for the ""City of Forges"" in the east, in search of a certain ""someone"" to carry out a mission. This journey is motivated by three reasons:

1. **By a man with white hair**.
2. **By a silver-haired woman**.
3. **For herself**.

It's a final ritual that she must fulfill.

# 3 Adaptation at the beginning of the story:

The opening features dialogues between the town's citizens, but has undergone some changes.

In the original version, there were clearer mentions of people's reactions to the *War Game*. This news quickly spread outside the city, causing a major impact in various regions.

Reactions varied:

* Some, confused, asked: **""What's going on?""**
* Others, indignant that their memories had been manipulated, complained: **""This punishment was the minimum!""** or **""It still seems too light a punishment!""**
* However, most people were lost, not knowing what the outcome of all this would be.

Even the merchants, who would normally take advantage of such a rare opportunity, were more concerned with the balance of the city than with profits.

Not even the gods escaped this tension. Their usual irreverent behavior had completely disappeared.

# 4. The reason why the Loki Family didn't take part in the war, apart from the Guild's interference mentioned in the anime, includes other reasons given by Loki

**4-2**. If all the members of the Loki Family took part, this Game War would no longer be a dispute between the ""Family of the Goddess Hestia"" and the ""Freya Family"", but a battle between the ""Loki Family"" and the ""Freya Family"", with the addition of other irrelevant participants. This would completely alter the nature and purpose of the conflict. Goddess Hestia even argued, ""Can't we just send a few people to the fight?"" However, the Guild quickly banned this proposal on the grounds that it would be nothing more than a public performance, which would damage the event's image in the eyes of other nations. Since the contest bears the name ""Game War"", the appearance of fairness must be maintained, or at least that was the Guild's official explanation. Naturally, the Goddess Hestia protested, saying: ""But my fight against Apollo was even more unfair!"" However, she was immediately silenced with the reply: ""That's your fault for not making the effort to gather allies.""

In addition, Loki was also unmasked by the Goddess Hestia. While it's true that the Guild ordered the ban, Loki was actually also under the influence of Freya, who had a trump card against her, such as the ""eagle feather cloak"" mentioned in the first season. Because of a previous ""agreement"" with Freya, Loki was unable to participate. In addition, among the gods present at the meeting, there were Freya's sympathizers, including male gods who had already had relations with her in the past. Even though their memories had been manipulated, they still had a blind devotion to her and did everything they could to prevent Loki from taking part. These ""traitors"", who were not detailed in the anime, will be further developed in future stories.

**4-3**. The Assembly of the Gods has been held several times, but Freya has never attended. Her stance was a way of demonstrating that, regardless of the outcome, she would ""accept anything"".

**4-4**. Ais is the person most tightly bound by a contract in this Game War. But what exactly does this contract consist of? The details can be found in the spin-off. In the spin-off, Ais asked for Ottar's help to train, and on that occasion incurred a debt of gratitude to Freya, which is now being repaid. Although it was technically just a verbal agreement, Ais could, in fact, break the deal. However, due to her personality and her deepest desires, she is unable to betray the promise she made.

- Freya's official reason for stopping Ais is the fear that Bell will grow up even more if he finds her.  
- But in reality, Freya is jealous and doesn't want to see Bell and Ais together again. From the start, Freya didn't like it one bit when Ais trained Bell on the wall.

------

# 5. The meeting between Finn and the Guild leader took place in the same place shown at the beginning of this season, where Hedin argued with Bell

**5-2**. After Finn declared that his members would not accept the decision and that he himself had no intention of convincing them to accept it, he demanded that Royman present a convincing justification. However, Royman replied that he didn't need to explain himself or convince anyone. He said:

    ""You are the two greatest forces in Orario, known as the 'Two Titans of the City'. Just like the former most powerful factions (Zeus and Hera), you must continue to maintain a delicate balance and dominate Orario!""  

Based on the principle that *""there is no way we can allow the two largest factions to clash directly in a War Game, resulting in a situation of mutual defeat""*, the Guild decided to intervene and ""cool down"" the dispute.

The choice to hold the conversation in secret, in a coffee shop, was because Royman knew that this decision would certainly provoke revolt. Within the Guild itself, there were already many opponents of this decision. If Finn took the matter publicly to the Guild, it could make matters worse and put even more pressure on Royman, who was already suffering from stomach pains due to the stress. If this led to him falling ill, it would be a complete waste of time. So Finn reluctantly agreed to the secret meeting.

However, for Finn, all this was irrelevant. Regardless of the justifications given, he simply couldn't accept the decision.

**5-3**. Finn stated that the purpose of holding the War Game was precisely to avoid increasing casualties and deaths. However, Royman replied sarcastically: *""And you still have the nerve to say that?""* He argued that the adventurers' verbal promises are basically useless - every time the Guild has relied on the adventurers' words, it has always resulted in some incident with injuries or deaths. In fact, casualty-free occasions are extremely rare.

Royman pointed out that the situation this time was particularly serious and was on the verge of getting out of hand. Most people had lost their common sense due to anger, and Bete was nominally cited as an example. He was incapable of keeping his cool in such circumstances. Royman even mentioned that on the occasion when Freya's charm was broken, only the intervention of Finn and the others managed to contain the situation before something more serious happened.

**5-4**. However, in Finn's eyes, these justifications sounded like ""belated apologies"". For him, the Guild had always had an ambiguous attitude towards the War Games, often turning a blind eye to what was happening and, in some cases, even encouraging the conflicts.

There were reasons for this: firstly, it was better to organize War Games than to allow direct combat within the city; secondly, the War Games helped to alleviate grudges between the gods. In addition, there was an implicit purpose: to use the War Games as a means of stimulating the growth of adventurers.

Bell, from the Hestia Family, was the perfect example of this.

**5-5**. Royman declared that, with the imminent mission to defeat the Black Dragon, they couldn't afford to lose any first-class adventurers. Finn argued that if they didn't take part, the Hestia Family's defeat would be inevitable. However, Royman replied coldly: *""So what? At the end of the day, all that's going to happen is one adventurer switching Families! From the point of view of the city's overall strength, it won't have any impact.""*

This response reflected Royman's bad habit: a way of thinking that over-prioritized the ""big picture"" while completely ignoring issues of morality and empathy. As an administrator, his stance was extremely logical and perhaps the most sensible decision for someone concerned about the future of the netherworld. However, at the same time, it was a point of view that could hardly be accepted as legitimate or just by society.

**5-6**. Unable to convince Finn completely, Royman finally revealed his ""card up his sleeve"": a broken dagger. The conversation between the two went as follows:

    - Finn: ""Apart from her, were there any other results?""  
    - Royman: ""Only a few remaining artifacts were found."" 
    - Finn: ""And where?"" 
    - Royman: ""In the 'cracks' between the 60th and 61st floors. That's all I can reveal for now.""  
    - Finn: What about the key?  
    - Royman: ""It hasn't been found. At least, neither Zeus nor Hera have had any success.""

Royman then conditions the delivery of complete information on Finn's promise not to take part in the War Games. He adds that this information is detailed enough to allow the Loki Family to **plan an attack on the site**.

**5-7**. Royman had deliberately suppressed information about the floors below the 60th. He intended to wait until the Loki and Freya Families could unite in a similar way to the old Zeus and Hera Families, before launching an offensive. If the information was correct, the 60th floor - or ""Ice Garden"" - was extremely dangerous, to the point where it would be risky for the Loki Family to try to conquer it alone. However, these two Families lived in constant rivalry and were now about to enter into a major confrontation.

Faced with this scenario, Royman considered that, rather than allowing the two sides to destroy each other, it would be better to disclose confidential information and try to avoid conflict. It was essentially a choice between two evils, opting for the lesser.

The importance of this information was such that Finn couldn't simply ignore it. At least Riveria certainly wouldn't remain silent. As soon as she heard about the exchange of information, she would do her best to prevent the Loki Family from getting involved in the War Game, even if it meant coming into conflict with the other members of the group.

**5-8**. Finally, Royman said that, without a doubt, they had to defeat the Black Dragon. There was no one better suited to the task; after them, there would be no other heroes with the same potential. Completing the *Three Great Missions* was an incredibly arduous and heavy task, but it was also unavoidable.

Royman made it clear that when the time came to face the Black Dragon, Finn should take on the role of commander. He should no longer think of himself as ""just any old adventurer"". After giving this final warning that they should not get involved in the War Game, Royman ended the negotiation and left the coffee shop.

**5-9**. The dialog between Finn and Hedin has also undergone changes in the anime. The main difference is that it was originally Finn himself who suggested helping Liliruca, not Hedin.

# 6. The Apology Conference

The so-called ""Apology Conference"" was portrayed with fewer characters in the anime. In fact, some members were missing, such as the three members of the Miach Family, the members of the Takemikazuchi Family and even Mord was present at the scene in the original material. The place turned into chaos, with everyone emotionally shaken.

# 6-2 The Comical Dialogue in the Middle of the Tension

During the ""Apology Conference"", there was a very chaotic and comical exchange of lines that was omitted from the anime. Here's an iconic excerpt:

    ""Please, just punch me!""  
    
    ""That's just a way of satisfying yourself to assuage your guilt...""  
    
    ""So, what should I do to redeem myself?"" 
    
    ""Do seppuku.""  
    
    ""STOP IT! Sakura! Mr. Bell! I'll do seppuku instead of you!""  

... And so on.

# 6-3. Reactions to Bell's Speech

After Bell encouraged everyone to get back on their feet, everyone's reaction was something like:

""Bell... From now on, I'm going to create a ton of elixirs... and I'm also going to try, once again, to create the universal elixir, even though I've never succeeded so far!""

""Until I have a premonitory dream that's good, I'll keep sleeping, even if it's painful!""

These lines show how Bell has managed to renew the motivation and determination of everyone around him.

# 6-4. Change in the Order of Revealing the War Game Rules

The rules of the *War Game* were only revealed much later in the original, but here there was a change, and they were presented right at the beginning.

# 6-5. Bell's Status Update

In Bell's most recent status update, the skill values achieved were surprisingly high. He also acquired a new skill called **""Vanadis Tevere""**, which includes the following effects:

* **""Protection of Purity""**: Activated when affected by charms or seduction skills.
* **""Very high increase in all skills""**: Provides a significant increase in attributes when suffering seduction effects.
* **""Automatic HP and MP recovery""**: Allows Bell to constantly recover his stamina and mana.

Although this ability has some more situational effects, the ability to constantly regenerate mana is extremely useful.

# 6-6. Lili's New Skill

Adding something that was previously forgotten: after her last evolution, Liliruca obtained a new ability called **""Command Call""**.

Basically, this ability works like a voice amplifier. When she speaks at a sufficient volume, her message can be transmitted over a wide area. What's more, members of the same family can sense and respond to these communications.

This ability will play an important role in the future.

# 7. Preparations for the War Game

Everyone began to prepare for the War Game. Welf, determined to forge a new Magic Sword, spent his days locked away in the workshop. Although the ""Magic Sword of Welf"" from the previous season doesn't break, its power varies according to the strength of the user, which led him to create a **Crozzo Magic Sword** with a more stable and consistent power.

Mikoto and Haruhime are also trying their best to improve their status and skills. Mikoto went to train with Takemikazuchi, while Haruhime sought training with Aisha. Both are doing everything they can to become stronger.

Lili, for her part, has managed to gather information about the enemy, much of it provided by Eina. However, the diagnosis is clear: **the enemy is too strong**. The group basically has no viable strategies against them.

The Freya Family has

* **157 official members**;
* More than 5,000 people, including non-combatants and followers.

Among the adventurers:

* There are **numerous level 3 and 4 adventurers**, all extremely skilled.
* Adventurers of **level 5 or higher** are a case in point.
* In addition, the number of healers in the Freya Family is **the highest in all of Orario**.

In short, even if the Freya Family were split up, it could still easily form **twenty medium-sized families** of considerable strength. The difference in power compared to the alliances of other groups is completely evident.

In addition, there is detailed information about several first-class adventurers, including accounts of Ottar's exploits.

# 7-2. Finn and Lili's Strategy

Finn told Liliruca that this was such a difficult battle that even a hero would **want to give up**. He said that she should use all possible means, without hesitation, to achieve her goals. After that, he threw up the parchment he was holding and said he would teach her.

# 7-3. Participation of the Hephaestus family

The Hephaestus Family also took part in the match. However, among the members, only Tsubaki is level 5. Despite her generally relaxed, optimistic and fearless personality, even she couldn't contain her trembling at the seriousness of the situation.

# 7-4. The Position of the Ganesha Family

Within the Ganesha Family, there were voices of opposition to the decision not to take part in the battle. However, Captain Shakti explained that, as guardians of the law and ""police"" of the city, it was their role to act as arbiters in the conflict. This meant **intervening at the political level**, ensuring that outside forces didn't take advantage of the situation to interfere in Orario. That's why they decided not to take part in the fighting.

# 7-5. The Elven and Dwarven Gods: Modi and Magni

The main gods of the Elves and Dwarves, Modi and Magni, are mentioned here. They appear in the 9:53 scene as two of the male gods. These two are Freya's supporters and deliberately delayed the Assembly of the Gods. Deep down, they don't want Freya to lose, preferring her to remain a ""queen"". That's why they interfere so that the alliance between the factions doesn't get favorable conditions.

For this reason, even if the Guild didn't give specific orders, they would do anything to prevent the Loki Family from entering the battle, cause unrest within the factions' alliance or even attack Bell directly. They are, essentially, traitors.

However, they are unable to convince their own Families not to take part in the war, and end up having to fight, even against their will, while they mourn their situation. This leads Miach and others to mock them, saying that it's their own fault.

# 7-6. The Goddesses' response: Hathor enters the conflict

Outraged by the behavior of these gods, the goddesses decided to act. They appointed Hathor, a fertility goddess, as the representative of the alliance of goddesses. Under her leadership, they became involved in the conflict.

# 7-7 Asfi and her desire to fight alongside Bell

Asfi, in a rare moment of vulnerability, revealed her personal desire: she wanted to fight alongside Bell and his group. However, Hermes, who didn't want to lose his position of neutrality and be restricted by a possible defeat, decided that his Family would not take part in the war.

In addition, the Assembly of the Gods had decided on the rules of the game, *hide-and-seek*, which led to the exclusion of Asfi as a participant.

# 8. Njord and Demeter's Help in the Little Meow's Case

In the segment in which the little cat curls up under the covers, there is a spotlight on the other two members of the tavern group. They comment that some of the establishment's employees have even asked the gods **Njord**, Chloe's god, and **Demeter**, Lunoire's goddess, to intervene and convince the little cat to change her behavior or even her faith.

# 9. The Training of Bell and the Twins

Bell and the twins began a training program focused on adapting Bell's body and mind to her new level. Reaching level 5 is equivalent to facing bosses walking through the dungeon, which makes this adaptation crucial. Without this balance between body and mind, the adventurer can end up being ""overwhelmed"" by the abilities of his own status.

In addition, Haruhime, who had also risen in level, saw the power of her magic increase significantly. This required her to take part in the training as well. In this context, Bell, receiving the effect of Haruhime's enhanced magic, temporarily reached level 6. Without proper control, he could turn into an ""uncontrolled beast"". For this reason, the twins, who are already level 6, were chosen to help Bell adjust and control his strength.

The training took place directly in the courtyard of the base camp. The twins argued that going back and forth to resting places or making preparations would be too time-consuming. However, the price for this was the massive destruction of the courtyard, which was left in a deplorable state after the training sessions.

# 10. The Location of the War Game: An Island-City in Ruins

The location chosen for the War Game was an island with the ruins of an ancient city. On the west side of the island, there was a large temple where Freya and her Family were stationed.

# 10-2. The Rules of the War Game and the Limits of the Gods

During the discussion about the rules of the War Game, it was mentioned that the gods could resist certain attacks or situations. Takemikazuchi commented that he had forgotten to check how far this resistance would be valid. It has been clearly established that releasing divine power is forbidden, just as Freya is forbidden from using her charms. But in the case of Takemikazuchi, known as the ""God of War"", the question of how this would be counted is somewhat ambiguous. To what extent could his abilities be considered fair?

Hestia asked Takemikazuchi to what extent he could resist going up against the Freya Family. He replied: **""Against second-rate adventurers, I can handle twenty at once. Against a first-class one, I can probably throw one away with ease.""**

This response left the other gods with a queasy expression, to the point where they let out a sarcastic comment, something like: **""Why don't you go straight to the front line and fight, then?""**. After this, the discussion moved on to the details of planning and positioning the forces.

# Final Impressions

This episode was very good. As a transitional episode, it managed to prepare the ground well for the impact of the War Game to come.

* There was plenty of new soundtrack.
* The introductory information was explained clearly. The only criticism would be the excess of quick cuts between scenes, which gave it a slightly confusing feel.
* The build-up of tension and emotion before the battle was very well done.
* Orario exists, in essence, to deal with the adventurers' three great quests. After the joint failure of Zeus and Hera, the situation is at a point where neither Loki nor Freya can be ruled out. Therefore, the Guild is determined to do whatever it can to avoid a direct conflict between the two families.

Freya's flower is lilac, which means ""first love"". This relates to the title of the episode and future events.

The content of volume 17 ends here, but there is still a final chapter that serves as an epilogue.

It's a deep dive into Freya's psychology, focusing on her emotional journey while chasing Bell (as Syr). This chapter explores Freya's thoughts and feelings throughout this process.

In my opinion, Freya's introspective moments are extremely important. Without them, the character's development becomes very superficial... In this way, she runs the serious risk of being reduced to a caricature of ""forced love"".

Perhaps she'll be adapted for anime in the future. I'll wait to see if the anime makes any changes and includes this part.

Overall, this episode was not bad, especially at the end, where the atmosphere of preparation for battle was very well conveyed, bringing that sense of excitement and emotion.  
I particularly liked the part where Lili motivates the alliance of the factions. Compared to the novel version, the scene in the anime gave a more intense sense of leadership, almost as if Lili were the reincarnation of a legendary ""hero"" from the past.

1hdg89o,https://www.reddit.com/r/nespresso/comments/1hdg89o/nespresso_denies_vertuo_pop_warranty_claim/,Nespresso Denies Vertuo Pop+ Warranty Claim Despite Repeated Failure (with Video Proof),"I bought this machine in July 2024 from Amazon and maybe 2 months into ownership, it started to fail regularly. I use the machine every morning, so it doesn't sit idle, and I wipe down the insides after each use.

It has been descaled 2x and cleaned monthly, per their manual, since ownership. After each failure, it would typically start working again, so I tolerated this issue for much longer than I should've.

This last week it failed repeatedly, so finally fed up, I contacted Nespresso via chat and explained the situation. They needed to see it over a video call, so I obliged, connected, and of course in the 2x we test ran it, it worked as it should.

I then turned the camera to my computer and showed several of these videos attached to the customer service person. They acknowledged the failure, but in a run around way, told me it needed to fail on a call before anything could be done.

I was advised to clean it and to descale it, which I literally just did beginning of this week, and told to call back if it failed again. Sure enough, not 5 minutes after the call ended and I tried to brew my morning coffee, it failed.

Conflicting with the service manual's recommendation of a monthly cleaning, she told me to clean it once a week.

The machine clearly has something wrong with it, yet Nespresso will not make it right and honor their warranty. I'm posting here to help warn others of their unwillingness to address what's clearly a faulty machine. Sadly with service and product backing like this, this will be my last Nespresso product purchased.

Hello! I'm a passionate and adventurous soul with an insatiable curiosity for the world. I thrive on new experiences, whether it's exploring distant lands, indulging in diverse cuisines, or simply enjoying a cozy movie night at home. Life, to me, is a series of wonderful adventures, each one a chance to learn, grow, and share with those around me.

### Interests
- **Travel Enthusiast**: I have a deep love for travel and have been fortunate enough to do a bit. I can‚Äôt wait to go on my next adventure.

- **Movie Buff**: Films are a window into other worlds and perspectives. There's nothing quite like getting lost in a good movie and then discussing it in-depth with someone who shares the same passion.

- **Social Butterfly**: I believe that life is best lived in good company. I cherish my friendships and love meeting new people. Whether it's a casual coffee date or a relaxed evening with friends, I'm always up for socializing and making new connections.

- **Food Explorer**: Trying new foods is one of my greatest joys. I have a curious palate and love trying new food. From street food vendors to fine dining restaurants, I enjoy the full spectrum of culinary experiences. 

- **Board Game Aficionado**: There's something magical about gathering around a table with friends or family for a board game night. I enjoy a wide variety of games, from strategic games to cooperative adventures. It's a fantastic way to challenge the mind and foster camaraderie.

### What I‚Äôm Looking For
I'm searching for someone who shares my zest for life and is ready to embark on new adventures together. A genuine, kind-hearted, and open-minded person who values honesty and communication. Someone who appreciates both the thrill of spontaneous travel and the comfort of a quiet movie night in. If you love to laugh, have a positive outlook on life, and are excited to explore new horizons, I'd love to get to know you.

Life is an incredible journey, and I'm eager to find a partner who is as excited as I am to experience it all. Let's create memories, discover new passions, and enjoy every moment together. If this sounds like you, don't hesitate to reach out. I can't wait to meet you! üòä

I switched up my routine this time.  Been waking up early to run, have coffee/reading time.  Have been taking a probiotic and magnesium.  I'm not sure if it's all or some of those things, but it's working and I'm so happy.

Yesterday wasn't a great day by any means, but drinking wouldn't have helped in any way.  I don't expect every night to go perfect, but doing it sober will definitely help it to happen more often than if I was drinking.

I was really in love with my last partner but we weren‚Äôt a good fit and now I moved to a new city at 23. I‚Äôd say 90%didn‚Äôt make it past 2 dates and just wasn‚Äôt the vibe on my end. I think I‚Äôve been so picky but I‚Äôve liked 2 guys in the last two years and 1 turned into a 3 month relationship which didn‚Äôt work out and another one about a month of really fun dates but then he said he wanted to stay friends till he was emotionally available again and I was like no thanks hahaha 

But anyways. I think it‚Äôs been fun to meet all these people. Sometimes exhausting. I‚Äôm average looking but it was overwhelming when I first got on apps. 

I‚Äôve had 4 boyfriends since I was like 14. All of them were friends before I started dating them. I think these numbers are normal I haven‚Äôt been engaged or want to end up with anyone yet. 

In my eyes it‚Äôs extremely rare to find that love. I have loved one person and he was everything I didnt think I wanted but needed at the time.

1hdfrn7,https://i.redd.it/vf79q7od5n6e1.jpeg,Fujii Kaze in Manila - Post Concert Experience,"After a year of [ranting if may magdadala kay Fujii Kaze dito sa Pinas](https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/12lrrik/comment/jg8hilt/) nung di tayo sinama sa ""Fujii Kaze and the Piano Asia Tour"" that time, finally nangyari na this year with the help of Ovation Productions. Here's some of my notes from the show.

**What I Noticed**

* Maiksi ang pila sa fastfood stores kahit around peak or rush hours, might be the benefit if falling on a weekday and hindi full house ang concert na pupuntahan.
* At my section, either pantay or mas marami ang attendee na foreigners/Japanese compared to locals. Kind of challenging lang if need mong icommunicate yung fan projects katulad ng pagset-up ng sticker para sa colored flashlight and informing when to use it. *Time to learn Japanese for future use.*
* Malamig sa loob ng arena. Pero kung hindi ka nakapagdala ng jacket at nauuhaw ka, hinay-hinay sa pag-inom ng malamig na tubig para hindi makadagdag sa ginaw na nararamdaman + less chances of rushing to the CR para umihi.
* Iba talaga ang feeling kapag alam mo lahat ng songs na nasa setlist ng concert, than attending a concert na ang alam mo lang ay yung pinaka-hit song/s ng artist.
* Like every other concert na napuntahan ko, mahaba na ang pila sa merch booth and less items na lang ang available **after the show**. Buy merch before the show starts.

**Show Highlights**

* **Hedemo Ne-Yo:** >!Yung papaiyakin niya mata niya while singing the chorus, tapos napunta sa paghubad ng hoodie as the song ends.!< What a rollercoaster plot twist lol
* **Seishun Sick:** Took a video of the crowd using his phone; saan kaya niya napost yun?
* Some of the comments in other subreddits saying that his show is a lowkey church worship session, and I cannot agree more:
   * Pagkatapos kaming biritan, sesermunan kami bigla ng *""Say goodbye to all of your unhealthy ego, pride or attachments""*
   * ""Please be happy, Manila. Everything starts with your mind, your heart, your feeling. Please be happy and content. Contentment is the key to happiness. Please be feeling good, please think only good, speak only good, do only good. You only be good.""
   * ""Don't be embarrassed to be cute""
   * ""Please love yourself, I'm sure you do. You don't have to seek love outside of you. You got a lot of love inside of you already. It's more than enough. You are love, you are love**d**, and you are love itself.""
* ""Gwapo, gwapa, talaga? Talaga.""
* One thing na hindi ko lang bet sa setlist is **Hana**, one of my most favorite songs pa naman kaso hindi ko gusto ang areglo. Hopefully gawing stripped-down if he'll perform it again here.
* The dancers! Yung dance performance nila while Fujii's away from the stage doesn't feel like filler at all.
* Sobrang beautiful nung moment na nagpipiano si Fujii ng **I Have Nothing** habang kinakanta ng crowd yung lines ni Whitney before transitioning to **Shinunoga E-wa**; Sana may another round ng *Fujii Kaze and the Piano* tour, tapos idaan niyo sa Pinas. Kahit magpiano lang si Fujii, kami na kakanta.
* Bilis niya ring mag-adjust sa mga Pinoy. As he delivers his first interaction with the crowd, para pa siyang batang takot sa lakas ng sigawan ng mga Pinoy, then fast forward to the end, just casually saying **""What a greedy bitch""** after the crowd chanted ""we want more"" before singing the ending chorus of *Sayonara Baby* on piano **ü§£**

**Last Thoughts**

Watching a concert on a weekday is not recommendable, unless its a must watch talaga for you. Grabe din ang puyat na inabot ko, 1AM na ako nakatulog tapos need kong magising by 5AM for work. üò≠ Pero it's not big of a concern naman for me since sulit na sulit ang experience na inabot ko from that show.

Bottomline: Watching a concert on a weekday? Better make it worth it para no regrets.

1hdfriu,https://www.reddit.com/r/OffMyChestPH/comments/1hdfriu/the_guilt_of_having_supportive_parents/,The guilt of having supportive parents,"Some days I wonder if I just feel this way because I‚Äôm overwhelmed by the support they‚Äôve given me. But I think it all really boils down to the fact that I can‚Äôt do so much for my parents right now and they extend every help that they can. I‚Äôm a graduating college student and has been living in Manila for a month now. Weekends are fixed for family time, so they expect me to at least go back home every Friday evening and stay until Sunday evening. However, it‚Äôs December and events are literally ‚Äì everywhere. My supposed Friday night travel to my parent‚Äôs house became a 4:00 AM Sunday travel, only for me to go back to my house a few hours later again. I don‚Äôt give my parents any reasons to doubt ‚Äì I‚Äôd say. They know everything that I‚Äôm up to, even the 2:00 AM coffee shop aral that I do and the friends that I go out with. I have their full trust and support, and I really feel it every single day. 

Today, I just informed my dad that I‚Äôll not be going home this weekend and for the next weekend. My schedules are packed with both work and school events (and also personal errands), and I have no choice but to attend. My dad suddenly told me that we‚Äôre really getting  older and he‚Äôs getting older because now, we live a life of our own. I felt really sad and I can feel that in his voice too, but I‚Äôm trying my best not to cry even tho I‚Äôm the most iyakin person ever. I told him na ayaw ko talaga pumunta but it‚Äôs the least I can do for my manager because they‚Äôve been really supportive with my entrance exam reviews and OJT. At least, I can be with them on these events because they‚Äôre doing me so much favor and they‚Äôve been asking me so many times to attend. He told me na it‚Äôs okay and he will pick me up na lang so I‚Äôll be safe, just make sure lang daw na I‚Äôll stay sa bahay kahit for hours lang :( I feel really bad because my parents are really supportive and they‚Äôre growing old ‚Äì and I‚Äôm also getting older now and can‚Äôt be with them at all times. He also told me to work hard for my entrance exam review and titiisin daw muna nila ni Mama to be away from me for another four years because it‚Äôll all be worth it, and God knows how I much I want to cry when he told me that at least he‚Äôll get a lawyer daughter after another four years. I miss being home everyday just doing nothing with my parents but laugh. I love them so much and I‚Äôm expressive with my feelings (I hug them every day) and they‚Äôre telling me the past few days that they miss their anak daw na palaging nakadikit sa kanila. I‚Äôm grateful for having supportive parents and I hope I can get back to them (tho I do, but these material things are nothing compared to spending time with them). I want to go home now but I have an event at morning until late at night and it‚Äôll be impossible for me to make it to these events considering the traffic. God, I miss my parents. I hope they live a long life so the day will come na I‚Äôll not be guilty na because every sacrifices they did for me will be worth it. I love you, parents. Thank you making home feel like home. I promise to make it all worth it in the end. ",3,1734106638.0,OffMyChestPH,1,1.0,False
