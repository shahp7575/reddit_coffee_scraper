After clearing that out, I remembered that a chunk of them came from a meal delivery service that also sends out recipe cards (SimplyCook here in the UK, they send you spices/seasoning and the recipes, you buy the ingredients as appropriate so you're not surprised by expiration dates). So I went through those too—turns out I had a thick enough pile to be a really chunky edition of InStyle magazine. I found the 4 that I was interested in/had in date meal prep kits for, and the rest have gone in the recycling!

It's not a huge amount of improvement, but I have most of a shelf in a cupboard back—and found the manual for the coffee maker that I gave to my parents at the weekend as well.

1gpjadz,https://www.reddit.com/r/Gastritis/comments/1gpjadz/healed_after_1year/,Healed after 1year,"I was cured after one year. It all started when I occasionally felt the need to vomit after eating, along with pain in the upper middle of my chest. I didn't take it seriously and continued my normal routine until, one to two months later, I found that I couldn’t eat anything without feeling extremely nauseous. 



My problem was my daily diet, which mostly consisted of Dr Pepper,Pizza, Fast food made the mistake of not changing my eating habits and continued consuming whatever I wanted. I lost over 20 kg, going from 75 kg to 55 kg within a few months. 



Two months ago, I started eating only rice, potatoes, and eggs. I also stopped drinking coffee and soft drinks because I can’t walk straight due to the pain. Unfortunately, I often made the mistake of drinking coffee anyway, which delayed my recovery. 



Three weeks ago, I had my gastroscopy, and everything turned out fine. Now I’m back to full health and can eat and drink whatever I like. A few weeks ago i was very close to go  to the hospital because I was in so much pain that I could barely stand up straight. Healing clay and chamomile tea helped me significantly.



I am truly grateful for this experience. I was so afraid that something was seriously wrong, and now that I have recovered, it feels like I’ve been given a second chance at life.",2,1731413506.0,Gastritis,1,1.0,False

One greater drink than caffeine  
A godly nectar, evermore  
A sweeting brown, from golden core  

Your scent is like a lullaby  
Your taste a gift from heavens high  
Where my fatigue is like a shroud  
You raise me up on woolly cloud  

You're blessed with sugar, laced with milk  
And sooth my throat like flowing silk  
When i am still in slumb'ring haze  
It takes one cup to state my case  

Oh coffee, you're a gift divine  
To honor you, i'll build a shrine  
Espresso, latte, carved in stone  
And cappuccino takes the throne  

Oh, every day would be a fight  
Would i not have you by my side  
If made at home or for a dime  
I'm struck with awe to call you mine  

And once my body's dead and cold  
My spirit feasts in brown and gold  
And when i rise toward the skies  
I'll drink you still in paradise  

Oh coffee, coffee, sings the choir  
When i wake up, you light my fire  
Oh coffee, coffee, praise the lord

It started with a simple hello, a spark that I never thought would catch fire. Her words were crisp, laced with a wit that seemed effortless. She had a way of typing that made you feel like she was there, leaning in, sharing a secret meant only for you. Her laugh, captured in voice notes and written in strings of ""haha"" and ""lol,"" was unrestrained, bubbling over through my screen. And when she laughed, the world I inhabited a silent space, lit only by a screen seemed to come alive.

Her photos, scattered like breadcrumbs in our chat history, painted a picture of a girl with a thousand moods. She had a quiet, piercing beauty, the kind that sinks deep, embedding itself in your bones. There was that picture she sent one morning, just after waking up, hair tangled, eyes heavy-lidded with sleep her expression so vulnerable and pure that I saved it without thinking, afraid that if I didn’t, the moment would disappear.

Our conversations stretched into nights that bled into dawn, spilling secrets and dreams. We talked about everything and nothing at all: from books and music to the color of the sky at her place that day, to why she thought coffee was overrated and why I thought she was wrong. We played with words, spun our own stories, built a world where only she and I existed a digital kingdom nestled within our screens.

And then, slowly, things started to change. A missed message here, a curt reply there. The warmth that had once wrapped around our every exchange faded, leaving an emptiness that felt colder than silence. I’d replay our voice notes, watch the videos she’d sent of her favorite places, hear the way she’d say my name, soft and unguarded. The ache grew, lingering long after our conversations ended, haunting me with flashes of what we once had.

It’s strange how a person you never met can make you feel so complete and then hollow, like they’ve stolen something essential from you. She’s everywhere now, in the quiet moments when I close my eyes and hear her voice, in the spaces between my breaths. I still check my phone, hoping for a message, a sign that maybe, just maybe, she’s thinking of me, too.

But all that’s left are ghosted messages, a mind plagued with fragments of memories of what I once had, and a silence that echoes with everything she once was. I wonder if she feels it too the hollow ache, the absence of something beautiful.",4,1731412621.0,nairobi,0,1.0,False

After we broke up, she got married, had a son(5y) and we both moved on. We kept in touch occasionally, but on my birthday in October, she called unexpectedly. I joked that it would be nice if she wished me in person and to my surprise, she asked me to meet her at the airport that evening. I thought she was kidding, but she was serious so I went.

Over coffee, we had a long chat and she opened up about her marriage troubles. After that, she returned to Bangalore, but the next weekend, she came back to Hyderabad nd we spent the weekend together. I felt uneasy that she left her son with her husband, but she explained that he needed to share more of the family responsibilities.

Her husband had an affair with her cousin, someone she grew up with and trusted, which has left her deeply hurt and struggling with depression and even suicidal thoughts.

We spent the day watching shows at a hotel. I mentioned some NSFW Reddit pages where people share personal stories, hoping to help her relax and maybe find peace with her husband. I didn’t intend to restart anything between us, as I haven’t dated anyone since we broke up. I took the breakup hard and decided against marriage.

Unexpectedly, she joked about us trying some things we saw on Reddit and one thing led to another. Since then, we’ve been meeting on weekends nd she puts in a lot of effort to visit me either flying or taking long bus rides. She recently told me she used to think I wasn’t ""marriage material,"" but now sees me as the right person for her. She’s even started divorce proceedings but respects that I’m not ready for marriage. She suggested we enjoy life as partners with no pressure.

Her husband knows about what's going on between us now (whether you want to call it an affair or something else) and surprisingly, he's okay with it.

She’s planning to come back to Hyderabad next week and mentioned wanting to explore some fantasies Part of me feels drawn to her, especially given the effort she’s making. But I also feel like things are moving too fast, and I’m unsure about where this is going.

Now it's time to buy more and Amazon has confused my decision by offering me a liquid alternative, ""My Normal Keto"" brand a blend of allulose, monk fruit and stevia. 

There is also a powdered version. I don't do a lot of baking. I primarily use stevia in coffee and tea. And I like the way stevia sweetens my tea , but I wasn't satisfied with how it tastes in my coffee.

Any advantage to powder vs. liquid?

So I 22M am kinda in a dilemma. A few weeks ago, I was asked by the NGO I work at to meet up with an influencer 22F to shoot some content for a company we had worked with previously. Approaching the time, she sends a message saying her train was late. I replied, and she arrived, she sent a message saying she needed a toilet visit before meeting up. We were 3 from the NGO and her. It was quite casual, and I felt the conversation flowed really well. It was mostly her and me talking, while the other girls were there for the content shooting.

This was on a Saturday evening, and she had plans to go out that evening. She kinda invited us to join her, but I had work the next day. It seemed quite difficult for us to stop the conversation, but she had to leave because her friend was waiting for her. The next day, I sent a text trying to recruit her to our NGO, and asked her if she came home safe. She responded quite positively, and surprisingly fast. Through all this, she was in no way formel, and everything seemed quite casual, more than I am used to. We talked about her previous work, how unsafe the nightlife can be etc.I know she is single, and the chance of us having to meet through anything work related is nonexistent. She is a decent sized influencer, having worked with some of our bigger companies in our country. 

Saturday, 2 weeks after we last met, I texted her

Me: ""Hey xxx

I hope I don't overstep any boundaries, but I left our last meeting with a feeling of a good, and interesting dialog, and was wondering if you had time, and wanted to continue over a cup of coffee or tea?  
Of course with full understanding of rejection of any kind""

She replied in the same minute  
Her: ""Hey xx, that sounds like fun!""  
Her: ""Yes, very much, where was it you were located? xxx area?""

Me in a meeting, not realizing she had already responded, but 5 minutes later; 

""I'm in xx area, and don't mind coming to your area""  


""As it seems, I am available xxxday, xxxday and xxxday next week?""

  
Me 30 hours later  
""Howdy xx

I am unsure if you just lost interest, or just forgot to return, but I am definitely still interested in meeting up""



The project she had my help with just finished and released today, so it feels kinda weird being left. I kinda want to reach out one last time to ask if she is okay, and such, because the times I've texted her, she was been so quick to respond on the same minute, so going hours would be understandable, but days?

He calls himself a “mug-preneur” and believes that this business model is one of the easiest ways to earn money online. But can you trust his claims? Can you really earn money from selling mugs? Let’s take a closer look.

**You're here because you're looking for a way to make money.** [Here's a link](https://www.twopagesites.com/beastpreneur-page?sl=beast) **to another business model you should consider. I rent leads to business owners for monthly recurring income. You can** [watch a video about it here](https://www.twopagesites.com/beastpreneur-page?sl=beast)**.**

[Go here to see my no.1 recommendation!](https://www.twopagesites.com/beastpreneur-page?sl=beast)

# How Does Dave Kettner’s Mug Business Work?

Dave’s approach to making money with mugs is simple. He doesn’t handle inventory, and he doesn’t ship anything himself. He relies on a print-on-demand service to produce and ship the mugs when someone places an order. This eliminates the need to invest in inventory or manage shipping logistics.

Here’s how it works:

1. **Find Winning Slogans**: Dave suggests going to Amazon to find popular mugs with phrases that are already selling well. He recommends searching for mugs targeted at specific occasions or demographics, such as “funny mugs for 40th birthday” or “mugs for new mothers.” The key is to look for mugs that have lots of positive reviews and higher price points, as these are likely to be winners.
2. **Design Your Mugs**: Once you find a winning slogan, Dave recommends using a mobile app called Word Swag. The app allows you to type in text and generate unique designs for the mug. After picking a design, you upload it to a print-on-demand platform called IconEcom. From there, you pair the design with a plain white coffee mug.
3. **List and Optimize**: Once your design is ready, you list it on platforms like Etsy or Amazon. Dave emphasizes the importance of keyword optimization to take advantage of the traffic these sites already generate. By stuffing your listings with popular search terms, you can increase visibility and drive sales.
4. **Test and Repeat**: Dave advises that success comes from testing. He suggests uploading a variety of designs and tracking the performance. Cut the designs that don’t sell and double down on the ones that do. Additionally, you can expand your products by adding designs to other items like T-shirts or pillows, all through the same platform.
5. **Leverage Holidays and Events**: Sales for certain types of mugs will be seasonal. For example, you can expect a surge in sales around graduation season for “best grad” mugs, or around Father’s Day for “best dad” mugs. While these seasonal spikes can bring in big profits, the rest of the year may not be as predictable.

# What’s Included in the Printable Profits Program?

If you’re interested in learning how to launch your own mug business, Dave offers a course called **Printable Profits**, created in partnership with Anik Singal, the CEO of Lurn. The course is an eight-module masterclass that covers everything you need to know to start and grow your mug business.

Along with the course, you get access to the **Printable Profits Private Community**, where you can ask questions, get support, and collaborate with other entrepreneurs who are building similar businesses.

The course costs **four payments of $397**—a total of **$1,588**. This price gives you access to the full training, as well as support from Dave and Anik.

# What Are the Benefits of This Business Model?

# 1. No Inventory or Shipping Management

One of the main advantages of this business model is that you don’t have to worry about managing inventory or handling shipping. Print-on-demand services handle everything from production to delivery, allowing you to focus on marketing and growing your business.

# 2. Low Startup Costs

You don’t need to invest in expensive inventory upfront. Instead, you only pay for the mugs when a customer places an order. This makes it a low-risk business model, as you don’t have to worry about unsold products or holding stock.

# 3. Scalable

The business can scale easily. Once you find a few winning designs, you can keep adding more mugs and expand into other products. The process is mostly automated, which means you can run the business with minimal time investment.

# 4. Passive Income

If you create successful designs, this business model can generate passive income. Once your mugs are listed and optimized, they can continue to sell without you needing to do much work. You just need to monitor the performance and make adjustments as needed.

# What Are the Drawbacks of Dave’s Mug Business?

# 1. Inconsistent Sales

Sales may not be consistent throughout the year. While you can expect big sales around certain holidays or events, there may be lulls in sales during other times of the year. It’s important to be prepared for slow periods and find ways to maintain consistent income.

# 2. Legal and Ethical Concerns

One of the main concerns with this business model is whether it’s ethical to copy slogans and designs from other sellers. Dave suggests using successful phrases from Amazon, but some people may find it ethically questionable to directly replicate someone else’s work. It’s important to be cautious when creating your own designs and ensure that you’re not infringing on anyone else’s intellectual property.

# 3. Competition

Since this is a print-on-demand business model that anyone can use, there’s a lot of competition. Other people using the Printable Profits program or similar courses may end up creating the same designs as you, which can lead to copycat products flooding the market. This can make it harder to stand out and make sales in the long term.

# 4. Dependence on Platforms

If you rely on platforms like Amazon or Etsy for sales, you’re at the mercy of their algorithms and policies. If these platforms change their rules or visibility algorithms, it could affect your sales. Additionally, there are fees associated with selling on these platforms, which can eat into your profits.

[Go here to see my no.1 recommendation!](https://www.twopagesites.com/beastpreneur-page?sl=beast)

# Is the Printable Profits Course Worth It?

The Printable Profits course is a comprehensive guide to starting and growing a print-on-demand mug business. If you’re interested in this business model and want step-by-step guidance, it could be a good investment. The course provides valuable insights and strategies to help you find winning designs, optimize your listings, and grow your business.

However, it’s important to consider the potential drawbacks before committing. The business model may not be suitable for everyone, especially those looking for consistent, long-term sales. There are also legal and ethical concerns when copying slogans or designs, so it’s important to proceed with caution.

# Final Thoughts

Dave Kettner’s mug business model offers an easy way to get started with online sales, but it’s not without its challenges. The key to success is finding winning designs, optimizing your listings, and continuously testing new ideas. However, the business may not be as passive as it seems, and sales can be inconsistent.

If you’re looking for a low-risk, low-cost business that you can scale, this could be a great option. But if you’re concerned about the ethical implications of copying designs or want a business with more consistent income, you may want to explore other options.

Ultimately, the decision to invest in the Printable Profits course is up to you. If you’re comfortable with the risks and potential rewards, it could be a good fit. Just be sure to do your research, and consider whether this business model aligns with your values and goals.

I am planning to make the Warm Date Cake recipe from the Gjelina cookbook for my birthday. The sauce calls for 2 1/2 tbsp of bourbon. I'm not a drinker, so I don't keep alcohol around, and don't really want to buy any just for this cake.

I do really enjoy coffee, though and am thinking I could substitute the bourbon with either prepared or powdered espresso. Here's the sauce recipe :: 

  
5 tbps \[70 g\] unsalted butter

2 cups \[400 g\] packed dark brown sugar

1 \[240 ml\] heavy cream 

2 1/2 tbsp bourbon \[they didn't include a conversion\] 

  
Any thoughts on how that might impact the way the sauce comes out? I guess my main question is \~ based on this recipe, do yall think it would make more sense to add espresso powder for taste, or if it makes sense to make a cup of espresso and add it in liquid form? 

The quantity seems kind of small to make that much of a difference, but I wasn't sure if maybe the alcohol does a thing with the other ingredients, similar to how leavening agents work in cake. Thanks! ",1,1731411786.0,Baking,0,1.0,False

We’ve been dating for three months. Do you think she has attachment issues?,"Hello folks, we’ve been dating for 3 months. We had some up and downs but none of them was a big deal until yesterday. We both work at same university and yesterday she called me to drink coffee together but I was going to home when she called me. And when I get home I texted her that I am sorry that we couldn’t meet today ( meanwhile we ate our lunch together.) after that she said she doesn’t want to talk to me and she said she feels alone because I don’t give attention to her. The problem is we both work really hard and that’s why I have to use my time efficiently. I go to her place at saturdays and after work in a weekday. Other times, we spent time together at lunch or if we have enough time we drink coffee together. But problem is she doesn’t want me to go when we meet. At last Saturday, I told her I have to go and she said “no, please stay” and insist it. I did. When I have to go she starts kissing me for 3-4 minutes. If I leave when she insist about it, she becomes sad but before she never told me that. Yesterday she said she didn’t want to talk to me and I said okay I’ll come there and we’ll talk. She refused and after 30 minutes she accepted. I’d never do that but I remember when she told “if I want something, I want you to do vice versa” that’s why I insisted it. Anyway. She said we don’t share common things other than sleeping together. I don’t agree with this but I don’t know if she is right or wrong. She is pushing 30 and she still cuddles a squishmellow to sleep. She also bited me really hard multiple times while we were making out and she said, “it’s the only way I know how to express my love. Me and my brother used to bite each other.” I said I don’t like this and she stopped doing it. Usually she acts really mature and even more mature than me but I feel like she has attachment issues.

What do you think is Haruka's morning routine?

Here's my personal take:

I think she wakes up very early, because she's anything but lazy. She goes straight for her coffee, which she drinks black.  
To stay as strong as fit as she needs to be Sailor Uranus (and also as F1 driver and runner), she needs to exercise. But we never ever have seen her exercise. Why? I think she does this first thing in the morning - when most people are just waking up, Haruka already has a workout under her belt.

She does not take ages to get ready, but one does not wake up with those perfect eyelashes and carefully tousled curls either. Her wardrobe is less compact and minimalistic than one would believe, as she has a wide variety of girly and masculine style clothes, not to mention the athletic gear, and all that takes space.

I imagine her breakfast as quite simple and sensible, and not sweet (even when the other senshi are downing milkshakes, Harumichi are demurely sipping on coffee or tea). we usually see Haruka eating and drinking Western-style foods (e.g. in Eternal), not Japanese, so I imagine a breakfast of wholegrain toast with a protein, and maybe a fruit.

She avoids looking at her phone during breakfast, but prefers to read the newspaper, a book, or quietly reflect on the previous days' events or the day ahead whilst looking out of the window (I don't write speaking with Michiru as something tells me Michiru wakes up a little later).

The coffee shop itself is great, it has a pool table and an arcade table for people to play while passing the time.

12.) Conscious chemist sun drink sunscreen  
13.) Cera ve moisturizer 
_________

1.) Loreal Hyaluron moisture shampoo-   
My hair type - Dry frizzy ends, scalp on oily side. In short, very thin ,frizzy hair. Suffered from major hair loss.
• This shampoo AMAZED me. Surpassed my expectations. Was sceptical to buy it due to insane marketing + I couldn't risk hair breakage bec I'm on a hair regrowth journey but it's worth the hype. Makes hair very silky, soft and manageable. There's a visible difference, you can feel your hair very smooth and frizz free after using it. Only a small product can produce good foam and the smell is very mild and non irritating. My biggest concern was hair fall but this causes none. Me & my bestf both suffered from hair loss bought this together nd LOVED it. Even my mom who doesn't care about shampoos used it and experienced the change and now abandoned the shampoo she was using before. This is the best shampoo I've used so far.

2.) Minimalist 0.1% Retinol- This was gifted to me. As a Tret user, it was average for me. It didn't really make any difference in the skin, only tret is able to do it for me. But it gives a good glow nd makes the skin soft. Imo you can start with this retinol nd then proceed to use tret.If ur looking specifically for retinol then I think it's a good investment. Smell is also mild, chemical like, not irritating at all.

3.) Dot & key facewash - 
My skin type- Used to be oily when I started this product but now after using tret, it's combination.
 • I used it when my skin was TERRIBLY breaking out. It was one of the products in my skin care during treating my skin. And it worked great for me. Doesn't leave the skin too dry. Is affordable. Smell is very mild, almost doesn't smell. Idk if it contributed in making my skin better but for sure it didn't cause problems or break me out. Go for this one if ur pocket is tight and I trust this one with my skin.

4.) Bblunt hair mask- I've frizzy ends but not damaged- frizzy, like frizz is manageable. But this DOESN'T help at all. In fact it produces more frizzz makes my hair ends jhaadu type, very very dry, even conditioner is not able to help my hair the day i use it. Absolute waste of money. 

5.) Aqualogica foam facewash - Very bad. Leaves the skin TOO dry. Hated this product since day 1. I started breaking out after using it. Rips the skin off natural oils. Even a lil product produces alot of foam and makes skin TOO DRY. Would never advice anyone to use this.

6.) Deve herbes rosemary essential oil- Been almost 2-3 months using it, so not much time. But it has helped my baby hair to grow longer in short span of time. I use 5-6 drops w parachute coconut oil every week. Smell is TOO strong but it might be due to authenticity of product, so not complaining. I got it for ₹300 from amazon. Love it. 

7.) Aqualogica moisturizer - Very light on skin. Works great for summers. The only problem is I was breaking out madly since I started using this &. Aqualogica foam face wash so idk which one caused it. But assuming it's innocence, then it's a good product. Quantity is also worth the price. Doesn't feel heavy on skin, gets absorbed quickly. Gives a very beautiful dewy look. 

8.) Vaseline cocoa body moisturizer - This is my HG when I wanna smell edible. I LOVEE it's smell. It smells like coffee and dark chocolate. If u wanna use a moisturizer that actually moisturizes your body and makes ur skin soft, I think it's not the first choice, bec it doesn't really give that moisturized skin look. It's good only for it's smell. I use it as a base then top it off with vanilla fragrance.

9.) Dr sheth kesar & kojic acid sunscreen - Thick consistency. Worked pretty fine. No white cast. Gets absorbed quickly. Doesn't feel heavy at all. Gives okay okay protection. It's average but not worth the price.

10.) Elmolim moisturizing lotion- This is not a popular moisturizer, bought it from Pharmacy but had to review it since I love it. It's price is ₹275. Ingredients are great. It's neither too light or too heavy on skin. Gets absorbed quickly and leaves skin hydrated nd nourished. Works amazingly for restoring skin barrier in winters. As a tret user. I love it. Value for money

11.) Mamaearth Onion shampoo- Bought it back in 2020 when I had no knowledge of haircare and this was all over YT. Surprisingly it worked for me and minimized my hair fall. I paused using it for a bit then when I started again my hairfall was WORSE(also might be due to head & shoulder shampoo) but it was very bad. So I discontinued using it. I used to use it as a first cleanse then double cleanse with head & shoulders. Mixed feelings about it. 

12.) Conscious chemist sunscreen - Tbh it's not been long since I bought it but it's been working good. I like the consistency, v mild smell. Isn't heavy on skin. No white cast. Blends beautifully on the face. Worth the money. So far so good.

13.) Cera ve Moisturizer- This thing FIXED me. Literally fixed my tret induced extremely dry skin. If somebody has used high dose of tret they know the consequences. I started directly with 0.1% and w no moisturizer 💀 so I had burns in my skin and it got very dry, flaky, used to burn ALOT. Then I ordered Cera ve and it single handedly repaired ny skin barrier.

I am a host lives here accommodation and rent out 1 room that can sleep 3. Double bed and single fold out bed added when required.
I also have another bedroom listed but this is unavailable by default for a few months. 

I am unsure how to review these guests.

I received a booking enquiry for 3 people for 1 night. They stated they needed my other room. I informed them that the listening for that room was unavailable for bookings and the room they were enquiring about was the double bed and fold out bed for the price of 100AUD.

The pre approval expired

Some days later I received a booking request for 3 people with a comment ""hi we will will be checking in at 5-6pm thanks!"" These messages are common as I do ask for eta on check in.
I approved the request.  Sent the usual thank you for booking see you soon blah blah message. 
I didn't realise it was the same guest, regardless it wouldn't have changed anything. I did not reclarify the bed situation.

Guest messages day of check in ""can I sleep in the living room?""
I informed them due to this being a shared spaces this was not possible
They replied ""I see""
I then realised it's the same guests that asked for 2 rooms but it's close to check in and I'm driving home from work so don't communicate further. 

Guest arrives just before I am arriving home and  come out to say
""Do you live here?""
Me: ""Yes I do, as described in the listing it's me and my pets here, welcome, once you have settled in I'll show you around""

I mention it twice in the description and of course it is the listing type.
They want to see my chickens and ducks out the back garden as I offer 2 eggs per guest each morning. They tell me they love the garden and poultry and throw the ball for my dog. 

Sometime later I ask if everything is OK as I'm going to get fuel and want to make sure they have everything before I go
Everything is ok they tell me

I get back from this and the booking guest knocks on my bedroom door visibly upset.

She tells me she has made a mistake and they do not want to share 3 to a room can they pay me cash for the other room. I apologise for their situation and tell them the room is not available. I suggest they check out and go to a hotel if they are uncomfortable. This is a husband and wife and another woman. The booking guest tells me she didn't tell her husband the room situation and he is uncomfortable to sleep with the other lady and please can they have the other room. Again I say the room is not available and explained why (not relevant to the story)  
I say again the hotel room option and they declined. They tell me the house is perfect otherwise.

I then say if you want to sleep in the lounge room I wake up at 430am and access this space. I do not want you to have an uncomfortable sleep or be woken by me getting ready for work making my lunch. 

They agree to this. 
So the husband ends up on the fold out bed in the dining/kitchen area which is open plan with the living room. 
They are all very polite with me, everyone is apologetic for the situation myself included. 

In the end I did not use the kitchen and rearranged my morning schedule to avoid disturbing the guest in the kitchen/dining/ living spaces. I also felt uncomfortable moving around while a person sleeps or is in bed.

So I end up with a crap sleep overthinking getting a 2 star review for this. Not going to the gym. Buying coffee, breakfast and lunch out for my long work day ($$$$!).

Medication: Levothyroxine, Venlafaxine, Carbamazepine and Quetiapine (BP2 and Hypothyroidism)

Hi!

First off just to note I am no longer driving due to how unsafe this has become. 

I just wanted to see if anyone had experienced anything similar as it is terrifying. I can be completely rested and today I had just finished a coffee and felt fine. Then it feels like I am so tired my eyes are going cross eyed, double vision and nothing I do (windows, radio, eating, speaking to people) will work to keep me awake. Only option is to pull over and I literally fall asleep/pass out immediately for 5-20 mins and can carry on? Or get out my car for 10 mins?

I can feel it coming on so I am able to pull over but it is not safe for me to drive even so. I am really upset/frustrated with myself as this takes away my freedom but it is the right thing to do.

I am on the list to see a sleep consultant and I do have an underactive thyroid which I take medication for and is in normal levels. My sleep routine is pretty standard 8 hours and I usually feel very rested! I have been told by my partner I sometimes do a weird clicking/sucking noise in my sleep and grind my teeth so I am hoping the sleep consultant can help and maybe that could be the cause.

Anyone had anything similar or any tips for avoiding this?

Thanks in advance

Allow me to debunk!,"I saw the thread on the other sub about Big Gorl Alvin’s recent video comparing Samantha Jo to Alex. I watched BG Alvin’s video so I could speak about it.  BG Alvin and the Big Gorls over on the other sub seem to feel that SamJo is vastly superior to Alex.  I thought some clarity was needed so I have prepared a little presentation that shows the many ways Alex and Samantha Jo are actually more similar than different. 

It’s not my intention to malign or denigrate Samantha Jo.  I have been following her loosely (hatewatching with a degree of fondness)  for many years and, based on my personal observations, I have come to the conclusion that SamJo is just as much of a lying, deceptive, lazy, entitled, junkfood-addicted, materialistic, over-consuming, moneygrubbing twit as Alex is. She just hides her faults MUCH better.  Sam is very good at using all the right words to describe her intentions but her follow-thru record is not good. In case you are not familiar with Samantha Jo, here’s a very brief recap of recent events:

On June 30, SamJo announced that, 2-3 weeks earlier,  she had stopped taking Zepbound, (the GLP-1 medication she had been taking for 8-9 months resulting in 90lb weightloss) She said she quit the medication cold turkey without consulting with her Dr. because she felt the drug was worsening her chronic depression.    She admitted that her weightloss journey was not perfect and that she used the drug as a “tool” to help with head hunger and food noise but that she rarely worked out and still struggled with binging and that she has not “fixed her relationship with food” Nonetheless, she felt that she would not regain the lost weight.

On August 22, less than 8 weeks later, Sam announced that she is pregnant and in her 2^(nd) trimester, she’s due in February.   So she most likely  got pregnant the first part of May, 6-7+ weeks before she went off Mounjao.  Sam says “Do people get annoyed by the term “Oopsie Baby? Because this is an Oopsie Baby” 

[Sam loves quirky Christmas ornaments, Just Like Alex](https://preview.redd.it/m0ukdwq54g0e1.jpg?width=687&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=e80559719d9ebf1bf8a9ad774c3fc0dbcc9be716)



It’s  clear that Sam was not being responsible with birth control since she got pregnant while using multiple prescription drugs that should NOT be taken during pregnancy- Mounjaro and Vyvanse.  Alex has been loudly criticized for taking Prozac during her pregnancy, stating that she felt that her mental health was important enough to stay on the medication…SamJo stated she will continue to take Vyvanse, an amphetamine, during her pregnancy because she needs it to control her binge eating.

Sam admits that she spent most of the first trimester in bed and that she lied to her 1 million+  YouTube subscribers to hide her pregnancy but feels that was a “good lie”  She also admits that she’s “grieving” the loss of her weightloss regimen and her “old life” but she’s confident that her new life as a mother will be different but just as  great.  She says she’s  been crying a lot during her pregnancy.  Sam tells us on Aug 22 that she’s currently around 225 lbs which she knows is obese and that her Dr told her she should only gain 15-20 lbs during this pregnancy.

During her pregnancy and after her baby was born, Alex stuck to her Sunday, Tuesday, Thursday posting schedule pretty closely, only missing a couple of posts all year.  Since Sam’s pregnancy announcement in August, she has only posted  6 “vlogs” to YouTube, all of them sponsored:

To summarize, both gorls (and many other influencers) have the same faults, same bad habits and lie just as much as the other.  Sam just announced that, after less than a year in her current apartment, she will be moving again soon.  She moves a  LOT. Every time she ends up giving away, throwing away or donating most of the obscene amount of clothing, furniture, decor items, kitchen stuff (including appliances) etc that she's purchased since moving in and buying all new stuff at the next place.

Since she was the only female in our office, everyone used to take care of her with respect, including me. To summarize, I noticed that she had an interest in me. I was not into this thing, however, I started dropping her to her home, and on the way, we used to go to cafes to have coffee together. She started opening up herself to me, like her past etc. However, every second day I used to ignore her because I was not ready for this thing, as she was from a completely different background - Eastern European, and I'm from South Asia.

Every time we went to a cafe, she used to show her intentions that she wanted to visit different places. Even though I understood it, I used to ignore what she was saying. Once I ignored her for a whole month in office, without any chit chat etc. But after a month, I started dropping her again. Last Wednesday was the last time I dropped her home. While sitting in the cafe, I realized that probably it was my last chance with her, and she had made up her mind. Again, I ignored her few signals, and then we went back to our homes. This was the first time she didn’t shake hands with me, even though I brought my hand in front of her.

The reality is that I always liked her because she was so kind and beautiful. I loved each and every moment I spent with her. And I realized it more when I lost her. Now she doesn’t reply to my messages; she ignores me in the office. I requested her if we could meet for 10 minutes only, and that I wanted to tell her something. She agreed; we went to a cafe. I opened up my heart and thoughts to her. I told her that I loved each and every moment I had spent with her and wanted to continue. She completely ignored me, as if we had nothing between us, and asked me if she had ever given me any message like this.

I am so sad; I am actually in pain. I have contacted her again one time, but she doesn’t reply back to my messages anymore. It’s just one time after that.

**Story time**: Let’s rewind to some time in 2022 when a 'seasoned' vet with rose-tinted spectacles figured it would be a good idea to drag a bunch of starry-eyed rookies from the RWG Discord into the merciless cosmos of EVE Online, all with the noble goal of playing this game 'casually’. Spoiler alert: We got blown up a lot and most of those rookies found EVE to be as welcoming as a porcupine in a balloon factory. But hey, fast forward a year and a half, and we’re still here, still playing, and still loving every brutal, chaotic moment that EVE has to offer us.

As it stands right now, we’re still a small, tight-knit community with a passion for squeezing the most fun out of our small-gang focused content in the limited free time most of us have. With work, families, and all the other real-life stuff that keeps us busy, finding the right kind of player to join our merry band is crucial, so we’ve been pretty selective with recruitment whenever we have opened up over the past year.

We’ve been doing pretty well though, dedicating a couple of nights a week to group shenanigans. Typically, we hang out and do all of the usual corp stuff that others do, but on a smaller, cosier scale.

However, we particularly enjoy diving into Faction Warfare—often rotating it once a week or every other week as a group activity. And of course, there's always some small gang roaming mischief for kicks.

Mostly though with our community, we treasure the peace and quiet of being a smaller group with that warm, fuzzy, close-knit vibe and lack of big-corp politics and all of the headaches that come with it. That being said, we realise we’ve still got a little room to grow, so we’re on the lookout for a couple of well-suited players to join our space family.

If you’re up for some potentially epic adventures with a misfit crew that’s like a bargain bin version of the Guardians of the Galaxy minus the talking raccoon, come check us out. Rift Watch might just be the EVE home you’ve been searching for!

**What We Offer**: 🎁

* **High-Sec Based Corp** *(Everyshore Region)*: Close proximity to Jita, Hek, and Dodixie but with great access to low-sec. Yeah, we're in the suburbs.
* **Timezone**: EU, Typically mon-fri between 17:00-23:00 eve time. *(sporadically on weekends)*
* **24/7 Discord Access**: Stay connected with the gang anytime, anywhere via our active Discord channel. We promise endless friendly banter, spontaneous gaming sessions, and a few groan-worthy jokes.
* **Welcoming Group**: A small, friendly bunch in our 20s, 30s, and 40s, with zero interest in being a political null-sec mega-corp. We’re more like a chill coffee club, but with lasers.
* **Group Nights**: Typically 2 nights a week for scheduled group/corp content (Mon/Thurs). For everything else, we wing it. Plus, extra chaos courtesy of our NPSI friends.
* **Diverse Interests**: A community full of well-mannered nerds who also enjoy PC gaming outside of EVE too - if that interest you.
* **Rotating Content**: PvE (Homefronts, Missions, Mining, Escalations) and PvP (Faction Warfare, Roams, and additional NPSI fleets). Basically, all the fun stuff.
* **Everyone Has a Voice**: We save room for suggestions and improvements! Round-table style, so you can bring new events and content to the table, and even lead them if you want. Democracy, baby!
* **Growth Potential**: Open to members helping to shape and grow the group as we dive into more interesting content together. Be a builder, not just a bystander.
* **No SP or Subscription Limits**: Whether you’re rocking 2m SP or 100m SP, Alpha or Omega, we are happy to have you so long as you bring your enthusiasm, willingness to engage, and a knack for learning on the fly. We're not looking for the best, just those willing to give it their best shot!

**What We Are Looking For**: 🕵

* **Social Vibes:** Friendship is the best ship in Eve, or so they say. If you’re happiest playing in a smaller team, with less of a mega-corp kind of vibe, and more of a cozy pub crawl through space then maybe—just maybe—check us out. If being part of a tight-knit group where friendship and fun matter more than ISK and stats, I can promise you, you’ll fit right in. Come for the social, stay for the explosions!
* **Voice Comms Enthusiasts**: PvP, PvE, or just shooting the breeze, you’ll get the most out of us by jumping on voice chat. Trust me, we have a real nice bunch and it’s not even half as scary as your last blind date.
* **Active Players**: If you like to log in a few evenings a week and dive into group chaos, hang out and socialise then you're our kind of space cadet. You don't need to be a hardcore player, casual is fine so long as you join in.
* **Self Sufficiency**: We’re more than happy to support you, train you and learn with you, but babysit you, we will not. Everyone is here to 'game' so we really want folks who can both create and enjoy content together as part of our team. We’ve got corp and NPSI activities to supplement your fun so it's all on you to put on your big-boy pants and take those first baby steps.

**TL;DR**: 🥱  
Now if you’ve skipped the above and jumped straight to the TL;DR, you’re in luck because you obviously saw the clues on how to get your free bajillion ISK from us, right?... Right?

Jokes aside there's no TL;DRing today guys. Buckle up for some serious scrolling back up to the top because we're dead serious about finding that special breed of player, someone who’s down for all the goodies we’ve listed. But hey, if that’s not your cup of tea, no hard feelings. We’re not for everyone, and that’s cool. Thanks for stopping by though!

Two months ago I found a screenshot of a conversation between my fiance and a girl, explicite content, her name was saved as cupcake heart emojis. As I sat there in the middle of the night on the couch I felt dead, dissociated, all my suspicions came true in one forgotten screenshot, the same person he told me so many lies about. It all started when I kept finding him awake before me, probably did not even sleep, phone next to him with missing calls that were piling up as I make our morning coffees, but ofcourse I don't ask who it is because I trust him and respect his privacy. With time, it clicks in my mind more and more, the language he uses, degrading to women, this man does not see more then sexual objects.the way he mentions all his exes, his sexual conquests, this man's identity is only related to how much women are attracted to him...I build courage after one the many fights he starts out of nowhere and ask for access to his phone, he finally says yes after he hears the determination in my voice, it was all fake I was too deep in love, that calmed me, there is nothing to hide if he lets me in, he loves me, he would never hurt me. The calls kept ongoing, the many nights where I wake up alone because he went hiding in the other room, his excuse was that he was having an identity crisis because loving me was too intense for someone with ASPD, he needed to reflect on his choices, I didn't make him safe,loved enough, but how when all my time,emotions,finances and intellect were devoted to him. Who's the person calling? An ex, an experiment went wrong, a guy named Raul that was stalking him. Why not just end it and block him? He knows too much and it is a delicate affair. Ofcourse it is not my place to tell you how to solve the issue, you know better as long as you uphold you promises to me, I love you and trust you. And thus we go until I built the courage, took his phone and checked the gallery and there it was, the screenshot of my nightmares. I go the bed with a cigarette in my hand and look at his sleeping body, I study this body that I worshiped for so long, he wakes up I ask him to pack his belongings and leave but he fights the verdict, he wants explanation and morals dictated at the moment that yes he deserves an explanation, he says she is an ex who is stalking him, barely knew her for a few months. I believe him, because ofcourse my brain is flooded with love, this man has become my life, he is beautiful, angelic, delicate and he says no one would love me like he does. A little voice iny head told me to find who she is. I steal the number, I call her and behold she is his girlfriend of six years. I am still with him, the story is blurry and I can't keep track of the lies. I don't know why I am still with him? I cry all the time, nothing feels real, everytime I try to leave he pulls back in, more lies perhaps, I can't tell anymore.",6,1731408720.0,Infidelity,5,1.0,False

MCAS is an immunological condition in which mast cells, a type of white blood cell, inappropriately and excessively release chemical mediators, such as histamine, resulting in a range of chronic symptoms, sometimes including anaphylaxis or near-anaphylaxis attacks. Primary symptoms include cardiovascular, dermatological, gastrointestinal, neurological, and respiratory problems.

[Mast Cell Activation Syndrome](https://www.aaaai.org/conditions-treatments/related-conditions/mcas)

>H1 and H2 histamine receptors are two main classes of histamine receptors that are involved in many different bodily functions:                                             

>●H1 histamine receptors.                                                   
These receptors are found in many tissues, including immune cells, smooth muscle, and endothelium. They play a role in regulating vasodilation, bronchoconstriction, and atrial muscle contractility. H1 receptors are also involved in cellular migration and nociception. Antihistamines that bind to H1 receptors are often used to treat allergies and allergic rhinitis, such as hives, itchy skin, itchy eyes, runny nose, and sneezing.  

>Commonly used H1 antagonists currently available in the United States are cetirizine, levocetirizine, desloratadine, loratadine, and fexofenadine.                                                   

>●H2 histamine receptors.                                                  
These receptors are mainly found in gastric parietal cells but are also present in vascular smooth muscle, neutrophils, suppressor T cells, the CNS, and the heart. H2 receptors are primarily involved in stimulating gastric acid secretion, which is closely linked to the development of peptic ulcers. H2 receptors also modify airway mucus production and vascular permeability. Antihistamines that bind to H2 receptors are often used to treat upper gastrointestinal conditions caused by excessive stomach acid, such as gastroesophageal reflux (GERD) and peptic ulcers. 

>Commonly used H2 antagonists currently available in the United States are cimetidine, famotidine
and nizatidine.

>Mast cell stabilizers are medications that can help treat a range of symptoms by limiting calcium flow across the mast cell membrane. This prevents the release of vasoactive substances and degranulation. 
Mast cell stabilizers are often prescribed in combination with histamine blockers. These medications include Cromolyn, Ketotifen, Lodoxamide, 
Nedocromil, Pemirolast, and Epinastine hydrochloride.

>Other medications used are included here:[Mast Cell Activation Syndrome](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/mast-cell-activation-syndrome)

It may be a Histamine Intolerance (HI) instead or MCAS. Because histamine intolerance involves the mast cells, it is often confused with mast cell activation. The difference, however, is that with MCAS, mast cells secrete multiple mediators in addition to histamine—whereas in histamine intolerance, the mast cells release only histamines and nothing else.

If your Allergist is unable to perform the necessary tests, you may need a referral to an Immunologist.

Many people recommend an elimination diet or a low histamine diet. 

[Mast Cell Activation Syndrome and Diet](https://patient.uwhealth.org/healthfacts/8114)

Diamine oxidase (DAO) is an enzyme that breaks down histamine in the gut, and DAO supplements may help with symptoms of histamine intolerance. 

When using DAO, it is important to first lower the histamine levels. Therefore, we recommend following a low-histamine diet for at least two weeks before starting DAO. After these two weeks, you can begin taking DAO three times a day (breakfast, lunch, dinner) while still following a low-histamine diet.

Diamine oxidase is an enzyme that helps break down excess histamine in your body. More research is needed to establish effectiveness and dosage, though current studies report no adverse effects.

I would research H1 and H2 histamine blockers. There are plenty that are available over the counter. It's recommended to take double the normal dose, one dose of each antihistamine, morning and evening. Many people have recommended cetirizine or Xyzol for H1 and famotidine for H2. 

My symptoms didn't completely line up with MCAS initially. My symptoms have continued to get worse with dry, itchy, watery, and goopy eyes and reactions to certain foods after eating. I started drinking my favorite hazelnut coffee I haven't had in nine months because I switched brands. Now I'm having MCAS symptoms. I'm itchy, sneezing, and have a runny nose after eating or drinking things that don't agree with me. I'm allergic to the fillers in my thyroid medication.

I was taking Cetirizine for H1 and Famotidine for H2. One dose of each morning and evening. It caused worsening tachycardia and adrenaline or histamine dumps. I was also extremely nauseous. That never happened before. I switched to taking one dose of each Cetirizine and Famotidine in the morning only.

I learned that in some people, MCAS symptoms are too severe that OTC medications don't work. And/or we're allergic to the fillers in the OTCs. That's what happened to me. I was prescribed Ketotifen and Fluticasone for MCAS recently.

>Our data confirm that histamine receptors blockade may be an effective target to successfully treat long-COVID. Our finding supports the underlying role of MCA in the pathophysiology of long-COVID.

[Antihistamines improve cardiovascular manifestations and other symptoms of long-COVID attributed to mast cell activation](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10388239/#:~:text=Our%20preliminary%20data%20clearly%20show,29%25%20of%20the%20treated%20patients.)

>Some individuals who contract COVID-19 are experiencing symptoms like extreme fatigue, brain fog, chest pain and palpitations, shortness of breath, headaches, sleep disruptions, GI issues, and even rashes that continue on for weeks after the initial COVID-19 infection has cleared up - and in many cases these are even lasting for months, or years. These symptoms tend to also worsen after any sort of physical or mental exertion. The medical community has termed this “Long-COVID” or “COVID Long-Hauler Syndrome.” In fact, a surprising rate of about 30% of COVID-19 patients experiences these long-term symptoms after the initial COVID infection. It also resembles the symptom list of those living with Mast Cell Activation Syndrome (MCAS).

>The prevalence of MCAS is similar to that of severe cases within the Covid-19-infected population. Much of Covid-19’s hyperinflammation is concordant with manners of inflammation which MC activation can drive. Drugs with activity against MCs or their mediators have preliminarily been observed to be helpful in Covid-19 patients. None of the authors’ treated MCAS patients with Covid-19 suffered severe infection, let alone mortality.

[Covid-19 hyperinflammation and post-Covid-19 illness may be rooted in mast cell activation syndrome](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7529115)

>Studies are now suggesting that there is a connection between long haulers and MCAS, finding that the symptoms of long haulers occur because the COVID-19 virus actually triggers mast cells to activate (MCAS) and the subsequent cytokine storms. “Long COVID’ describes post-COVID-19 syndrome when symptoms persist for more than 12 weeks after initial infection with no alternative diagnosis. Both mast cell activation syndrome and long COVID cause multiple symptoms. It is theorized that COVID-19 infection could lead to exaggeration of existing undiagnosed mast cell activation syndrome, or could activate normal mast cells owing to the persistence of viral particles.”

1gpi0p0,https://www.reddit.com/r/espresso/comments/1gpi0p0/struggling_with_dialling_in_gaggia_classic_sage/,Struggling with dialling in [Gaggia Classic / Sage Smart Pro],"Hey folks,

I’ve been arguing with my coffee machine for a couple of years now and I’m at my whits end with it! I’ll note that it was a gift so we didn’t go in knowing what we’re doing. But I do love coffee and I’d like to get the hang of it. 

I got a fresh bag of beans from our local and dialled in using 17g in 32g out. At the start of the bag, this was working nicely, taking about 25 seconds with a nice crema and very smooth flavour. 

In the last few days, nearing the end of the bag, using the same settings, weight etc. the flow just now pours out and finishes in less than 10 seconds. 

I have adjusted the grind setting from 5 to 1 and it doesn’t seem to have made any difference (inner burr is set to 2). The shot is very sour with little to no crema.

The steps we use are as follows:

1. Heat machine with portafilter in for about 10-15 minutes. 
2. Dry out portafilter and grind in beans. Beans are in the hopper and I use the timer to get the weight. 
3. Use needle thingy to break up the clumps and make the surface appear like soft sand.
4. Use the spiny thing to even the level of the grinds.
5. Use the tamper to press the grinds down using a firm pressure (like screwing in a sort of stiff screw)
6. Put portafilter in and pour shot. I eyeball the level it gets to as we don’t have a scale that fits under the cup. When I’m properly trying to dial it I weigh the output. 

Things we’ve tried:
1. Setting the grind finer.
2. Increasing the dose to 18g 
3. Decreasing the dose to 16g
4. Back washing the machine.

Things I think it could be:
- Beans in the hopper are changing in texture so I should weight out the dose in beans each time rather than putting a load in the hopper. 
- Beans in the bag over the week are changing in texture. I should buy smaller bags. 

Other than that I’ve tried reading online/ watching YouTube but I think I need some help troubleshooting! 

Many thanks! 

Edit: Just thought I’d add that we don’t want to buy any additional equipment at this point. I’m not sure it would be an equipment issue as we sometimes get the good pour, so I think it’s a process issue. But let me know your thoughts! ",1,1731408554.0,espresso,2,1.0,False
1gphx9r,https://i.redd.it/o76yodi89g0e1.jpeg,"Three Month Update - Reformer Pilates, Daily Non-Negotiables, and 10,000 Steps","Hello my fellow petites! 

I made a post here a couple of months ago regarding some recent sustainable changes I’d made in my lifestyle and their overall impact on my health/fat loss as a petite girly, and I’m just jumping in again with a check-in three months in to my new routines. 

Photos shown are from the 12 August 2024- 12 November 2024, and in that time I’ve lost 7.1kgs (15 and a half-ish pounds for my non-metric besties) and have noticed some pretty amazing changes to my physique, and cannot stress enough the positive impact on my mental health. 

Summarily, my current routine focuses on being less restrictive with respect to food and less intense on cardio, and instead focusing on sustainable, simple swaps or tasks that I can complete easily to ensure I am keeping myself accountable that I see as daily non-negotiables:

1. Drinking 2+ litres of water daily 
2. Getting at least 10,000 steps daily
3. Substituting soft drink/soda and coffee based bevs after 12pm with green tea
4. Taking my lunch hour outside every day
5. Committing to a skincare routine twice per day (AM and PM) 
6. Committing to a bodycare routine once per day. 
7. Closing my rings on my Apple Watch every day

I also originally started doing reformer Pilates around three times per week, but have increased my classes to anywhere up to five classes in a week because as my form improves, my enjoyment does too! I also am making a more considered effort to reduce alcohol intake daily. 

I am logging what I’m eating out of curiosity but this isn’t make or break for me and I’m not aiming for a specific macro or caloric target. At home my partner and I eat mostly whole-foods because we are boycotting our major supermarkets, meaning we source a lot of our proteins/vegetables/legumes direct from markets or independent grocers, so we’re really mindful of what we’re consuming and we don’t really have processed food at home. 

Overall I’m just impressed by the SUSTAINABILITY of it all - I always thought that fat loss and physique changes were the by-product of extreme dieting (abs are made in the kitchen rhetoric) and over-exercise. Now, I’m eating more (and better) than I ever have, moving my body in a way that brings me joy, and committing to my “self-care first, body goals second”, which has led to this before and after!",122,1731408118.0,PetiteFitness,19,0.99,False

A bit about me: I’m a Lutheran, but I’m really open-minded and don’t try to change anyone’s beliefs (not a problem if you aren't a Christian). 
I’m a creative person and I love anything to do with the arts. Drawing and painting are my favorites, and I often find myself wandering through art galleries or sitting in theaters, enjoying the atmosphere.

Books are a big part of my life too, especially classic literature or philosophy. I’m also a dedicated coffee lover (it’s definitely a passion!).

I’m love taking walks through parks, getting some fresh air, and staying active. And one of my favorite things is chatting with people about all kinds of topics, whether it’s something deep or just the little beautiful moments in life.

If any of this resonates with you, I’d love to hear from you! Don’t be shy, just send a message! :D",1,1731407807.0,asexualdating,0,0.99,False

I was surprised when I first used it, because the tamper was being blocked by the sides of the basket before the coffee puck was fully compressed. After that, I put the tamper in with the baskey empty and this is how it looks like:

I know that space left, according to the tamper lines, it should still be enough headspace, but isn't it too little margin to dial in the dose? I mean, the risk of not filling the basket enough and having a puck that is not correctly tamped, is high.

I’m moving to Cardiff soon, and I’m hoping to connect with some new people before I get there! I’m 36/M, currently living in Aberystwyth, and I work in the NHS as a healthcare support worker.

When I’m not gaming, I’m usually exploring the outdoors—whether it’s hiking along the coast or discovering new trails, I’m all for it. I’m also into live music and try to catch as many concerts as I can (I’m a Glastonbury regular!). If anyone’s into gigs or knows the best spots in Cardiff, let me know!

For UN/WHO meetings: Nations area makes sense, not just for convenience but for the informal networking. The real discussions often happen over coffee at Le Fix or evening drinks at Mr. Pickwick's.

For budget-conscious stays:

* French side (Ferney-Voltaire) is actually closer to the UN than downtown Geneva, and significantly cheaper
* Cross-border buses are reliable now
* Your per diem goes about 30% further

What I've learned works:

* Book well ahead for major sessions
* Mon Repos/Eden area if you can - walking to WTO meetings while others sit in traffic is worth the premium
* John Knox Centre for longer stays or tight budgets

What to avoid:

* Locations requiring multiple bus changes
* Overpriced tourist spots near the lake
* Last-minute bookings during major conferences

Worth noting: Ferney has some excellent options. Good hotels, decent restaurants, and you're 10 minutes from the UN. The Saturday market there is quite good too.

Yeonse Milk Cream Bread is a consistently popular product that is no exaggeration to say it is CU’s trademark.



Starting with whipped cream flavor, Yeonse Bread has expanded its lineup with various flavors such as yellow cheese whipped cream bread, melon whipped cream bread, and pistachio, and is continuing its popularity by collaborating with Chef Kwon Seong-jae to continue the black and white chef trend.


The Yeonse Milk Chestnut Tiramisu Cream Bread is sold for 3,400 won. As soon as I opened the product, the coffee aroma unique to tiramisu stimulated my nose. As befitting its reputation, the bread was filled with cream. 


It seemed to use the cream from the chestnut tiramisu, but the richness and sweetness were reduced and the chestnut aroma was full. Also, the chocolate bread, chestnut cream, and the faint coffee aroma were very harmonious.

1gphnyc,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1gphnyc/aita_for_distancing_my_partner_44m_from_his/,AITA for distancing my partner (44M) from his friend (43F) and still wanting to end my relationship?,"A bit of context: when I (35F) was very young I had a bf who caused me serious harm, which later led to PTSD, for which I am currently in therapy. When my bf was very young he was so introverted that he hardly socialised with anyone as a child, which has impacted on his social skills. 

Since my past relationship I lost interest in romance, until I met my current bf (4 years ago), let's call him Paul, who I found to be a wonderful man. We have common nerdy interests and he has a very kind soul. After being friends for a while, he finally kissed me and we started a relationship. Well, from that very first kiss he started mentioning in a very sexually explicit way a friend of his (let's call her Anna), with whom he just kissed 30 years ago in the first party he was invited as a teenage, telling me out of the blue very graphic, unpleasant details. At first I thought it was inappropriate but I didn't want to be the jealous type and besides I have male friends, so I tried to play it down and didn't say anything. In fact, when I met her (she lives in another state, more than 500 km away) I liked her. But when he kept mentioning her like that I confronted him, he told me that he didn't realise he had mentioned her so much, and apologized. When I asked him whether he was in love with her he literally said: ‘I don't know’. I told him to go away and that we would talk again when he had a clear thought about her and me, and then he said that he was very nervous and that of course he knew he wasn't in love with her, that when he had coffee with her it was like having coffee with any other friend, but that they were very close friends and would remain so. 

I found out then that every time I thought about it I felt very bad and had inappropriate behaviors such as drinking too much, so I looked for help with a therapist. I told Paul about it all and he wanted to go to therapy too, because he felt that his lack of social skills were hurting me. Apart from Anna, he had been clumsy, saying things like ‘this girl is average-looking to me, just like you’ (according to him, he was nervous because I asked him who she was) or e. g. if someone wrote a nice comment about my texts on the internet (I am a writer) he would ask me if I had written the comment myself. In any case, the psychologist confided that I had nothing to worry about, he was just socially awkward and wanted just to show off, so that he would appear to me as an experienced man (his remaining experiences with girls have been disastrous). Besides, he stopped having coffee with her when he had to go to the city where she lives for work. Anyways, I really started to feel bad was when I realised that this friendship, which might have been close 30 years ago and he displayed it to be still very close, is now limited to happy birthday/happy Christmas/happy New Year messages. He stopped having coffees with her without my asking him to, but kept writing her on the sly when I thought he had cut off all contact. So I told him I didn't understand how he couldn't distance himself from such a low-maintenance relationship when he knew it triggers my PTSD (he's seen me go to the bathroom to throw up and then be unconscious by a happy birthday message in which she was being very generous with heart emojis), especially since I'm working in therapy and it most likely wouldn't be a permanent distancing. 

As a result, he cut off all contact with Anna. I thought it would be a relief, but I don't feel at ease. Tbh, in the reverse case, I would have had no trouble distancing myself from a friend from my teenage years with whom I have so little contact nowadays if that triggers serious reactions in my partner, who has been abused. So I've asked him for a break, but I don't think I want to be with someone like that. Everyone tells me that I'm overreacting and should keep working on it in therapy (I started 3 years ago), but the messages behind my back and all the heart emojis have been a before and after. I think this transcends my PTSD and is an issue of broken trust.

However, I fear that I may be TA for wanting to break a long friendship because of my insecurities and also for wanting to break off my relationship with him, even though he has agreed to my wishes... I feel really bad, so please be honest but gentle: AITA?

1. **Us:** A couple of mid 30s, no kids, no pets  
2. **Reason for going:** ALL the beauty treatments. I'm serious. 1-2 clinics/spas a day. That is ALL we are going for, a true med-vacation. Most of our clinics will be on Gangnam daero. Picture this: Getting some laser treatments, ordering delivery to the hotel, lounging in bed watching netflix.   
3. **Dates**: Dec 12-16, it will be freezing balls. We do not want to explore, walk, etc.   
4. **Modes of Transportation:** Subways when convenient. Abgujeong station is right under Andaz and Samseong Station is under Park Hyatt. We'll taxi if a walk is more than 6-7 mins from destination.

**Things we don't care about:**   
1. breakfast quality  
2. Centrality - we will be doing zero exploring except when going for coffee or dinner. 

**Things we do care about/have questions about:**   
1. Construction noise at Park Hyatt - Is there still any going on? Will there be any during our dates? Since we'll be in the room most of the time, this will be a dealbreaker.   
2. Sauna/spa amenities - which one is nicer?
