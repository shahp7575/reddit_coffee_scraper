by [https://www.gptsportswriter.com](https://www.gptsportswriter.com) **Rayo Vallecano vs. Valencia: A Clash of Resilience and Redemption**  
Ladies and gentlemen, gather ‘round for a match that’s equal parts chess match and circus act—Rayo Vallecano vs. Valencia, where the stakes are high, the drama is higher, and the coffee is *definitely* espresso. Let’s break this down with the precision of a linesman and the humor of a stand-up comedian who’s had one too many tortilla española puns.

---

### Parsing the Odds: A Numbers Game

First, the cold, hard stats. Rayo Vallecano, fresh off a 1-1 draw with Real Madrid (yes, *that* Real Madrid) at their home nest, Estadio de Vallecas, are serving up a “we’ve got grit” vibe. Their 17 points in 14 games put them 9th, which is like being the “also-ran” in a race won by Usain Bolt, but with more *saudade*. Valencia, meanwhile, lurks at 15th with 14 points, having just snapped a seven-match winless streak with a derby triumph over Levante. That win was fueled by Hugo Duro’s *chilena*—a goal so elegant, it made Zidane’s volley blush.

But here’s the kicker: Rayo’s home form is as sturdy as a Spanish *cervecera* wall. They drew with Real Madrid, a team that’s won the Champions League more times than you’ve changed your Netflix password. Valencia, on the other hand, are 3-1 in their last five away games… in a *Sim* game. Real life? Their away record is about as reliable as a wifi connection in a cave.

---

### Digesting the News: Injuries, Drama, and a Chilena for the Ages

Let’s talk about the “news.” Rayo’s recent 1-0 loss to Slovan Bratislava in the Conference League? A minor hiccup, like tripping over your own shoelaces while sprinting for a taxi. Their focus is on La Liga, where they’ll lean on the same defensive discipline that kept Haaland-like Real Madrid to just one goal. (Kudos to their backline—though we’ll forgive them if they occasionally forget their own players’ names.)

Valencia’s story is one of redemption. After a seven-match winless drought that had fans whispering “relegation” like a cursed mantra, they answered with a derby win so thrilling, it made the *Valencian paella* simmer with pride. Hugo Duro’s *chilena*? A goal so dramatic, it should be patented as “The Levante Special.” But can they keep this momentum alive? Only if their away luck improves—something only possible if the universe decides to cut them a break (or if they start wearing their “Lucky Samba” jerseys from 2004).

---

### Humorous Spin: Football, Metaphors, and Paprika

Rayo’s home crowd is like a *chorizo* at a barbecue—small but packed with flavor. They’ll be roaring so loud, even the ghosts of Vallecas’ previous managers might come back to cheer. Valencia’s away game? It’s like ordering *gazpacho* in August: you know it should work, but sometimes the universe laughs at your choices.

Let’s not forget Rayo’s squad, which includes players with names like Vladyslav Vanat and Viktor Ziganakov—names so Slavic, they sound like they belong in a *Game of Thrones* tavern. Yet here they are, holding their own against the giants. Meanwhile, Valencia’s “rebuilding morale” is about as stable as a tower of *torrija* (Spanish French toast) built by a sleep-deprived barista.

---

### Prediction: The Verdict

In the end, this is a match for the *alma* of both teams. Rayo’s home advantage, combined with their “we’ve beaten Real Madrid” swagger, gives them a psychological edge. Valencia’s momentum is real, but away from Mestalla, they’re a team still finding its footing—like a tourist trying to navigate Madrid’s metro without a map.

**Final call:** Rayo Vallecano to eke out a 2-1 victory. Why? Because football is chaos, and Rayo’s chaos is fueled by home support, Valencia’s chaos by a “just avoid relegation” mindset. And let’s be honest—if there’s one thing this match will have, it’s at least one *controversial* VAR decision. Bet on Rayo, unless you prefer your football as unpredictable as a Spanish siesta schedule. *¡Vamos!* 🎉

1pbyxrt,https://www.reddit.com/r/Spravato/comments/1pbyxrt/first_spravato_treatment_experience/,First Spravato Treatment Experience,"
I did my very first Spravato treatment today. So here is my first experience and what I plan on doing differently during my next treatment(s). To have a better experience. 

I was incredibly nervous about starting treatments after reading a ton of posts on here and in another therapeutic ketamine related subreddit. Until I listened to Dr. Andrew Hubermans podcast episode on Ketamine benefits and risks. Which I highly recommend to anyone starting treatments. 

I am also incredibly neurodivergent mainly AuDHD and have had three TMS treatments before because of my treatment resistant major depressive disorder. I had actually asked for a fourth TMS treatment and my doctor suggested trying Spravato. 

I showed up like I was being dropped off for daycare, backpack filled with everything I could think of that I might need, several types of candy, sketch book, actual books, ear pods, a Bluetooth speaker in case I hate my ear pods during treatment, my inhaler, anti nausea medication (important if you get post anesthesia related nausea), a pillow sized plushie, a blanket with my husband’s cologne sprayed on it, and several playlists saved on my Spotify account. The John Hopkins psychedelic therapy playlist on Spotify was so wonderful to listen to btw. 
I did not eat before my treatment since it was in the morning and took my medication per usual as instructed. No caffeine either, just water. 

After the first dose I could feel the effects of it being a type of anesthesia within maybe three minutes. The second dose I could feel immediately. They had me put candy (puffy peppermints) in my mouth while spraying the medicine up my nose so I didn’t taste it. It worked incredibly well. They gave me an emergency call button and let me chill in a nice little room. 

I put my EarPods in and start the playlist and the music basically carried me away. It was incredibly gentle feeling and the music made me feel safe along with the smell of my husband’s cologne on the blanket. It felt very similar to when I listen to music at home while feeling safe and cozy just enhanced slightly. I do understand that the euphoria some experience and the disassociation is a side effect, not the actual treatment. That the neuro plasticity is the ultimate goal here and the euphoria and disassociation is not required during the treatment to achieve this. 

About 15 minutes after my second dose I began to taste the medicine so I grabbed a different piece of candy I brought (basically a tootsie roll but matcha flavored and a lot harder, the brand is known as white rabbit) Which required unwrapping. This is where I experienced what I personally felt was a very mild disassociation. My mind sent the signal to my body, but my mind was not an active participant in the un wrapping of the candy. It felt very reminiscent of watching a movie from a first person pov. The candy again helped with the taste. 

At around 45 mins I began to experiment with listening to some of my favorite songs. While enjoyable, they just didn’t hit like the choral and instrumental music so I switched back to the John’s Hopkins playlist. 

The MA came to take my blood pressure at the 45 min mark, and it actually went down from before as well as my heart rate. I found that I had become non-verbal when trying to speak to them. I had soo much going on in my mind so quickly I couldn’t form words. This could be related to my autism because I do go non-verbal sometimes when overwhelmed. The MA was able to understand my hand signals that I was okay but not able to actually speak. 

Half a hour after that I began to get nauseous, I remembered that I get post anesthesia nausea. So I take my anti nausea medication and I am already no longer disassociating at this point. But now feeling the typical post anesthesia effects. The medication taste really throws me off and triggers a stress headache. I eat a puffy peppermint since they dissolve much faster than the white rabbit candy. The bad taste goes away, and the nausea as well. But then suddenly the cologne on my blanket has become incredibly overwhelming and feels like it’s burning my nostrils at this point, when earlier it was a scent of comfort. 
I was also able to write down some notes about how I felt and the time I took my anti-nausea medication using a tablet and stylus. 

My husband also texted me about spilling my coffee on the way to get me and that also kinda threw me out of wack. I forgot to turn off notifications to my headphones that read my messages to me. I also forgot to turn off an alarm I had set. So another strike against me. 

The MA shows up at the two hour mark and at that point I had already mostly packed my bag up and was able to speak again. 

Afterwords my husband brought me home and ordered food for us and I just chilled on the couch with some different instrumental music. I found that while browsing YouTube some voices I just can’t tolerate. 
Also, the coffee my husband bought me, only a little spilled out thankfully, did not give me the normal dopamine boost that I normally get from coffee. I am medicated for my ADHD with stimulants and so I don’t usually drink coffee and get it as a treat because one of my favorite coffee shops is across the street from the clinic I go to.

Overall mentally nearly 12 hours post treatment I do not feel any differently than I did yesterday. I understand that everyone is different when it comes to these treatments but that I should see results faster than with the TMS treatments. Which takes up to six weeks post your 36th treatment to know if the TMS treatment was of any benefit. I can say that TMS did do me a lot of good. Those 108 visits were not in vain. They got me out of bed and that was an incredible step forward for me. But, now I want to be functional. To be able to feed myself regularly, or even work a part time job eventually. I hope that Spravato can provide that for me. 


So things that I will do differently next time:

Take my anti nausea medication before hand since the effects last around 8 hours.

I have already washed the blanket and I’ll stick with a lavender scent that is always very gentle on my senses and a very safe scent for me. 

Putting a piece of candy in my mouth immediately after the second dose. That way I can just relax and enjoy the music and the couple hours of peace. 

Turning off the audio notifications during this time. I am going to introduce my husband to the MA and if my husband has an emergency he can talk to the MA instead of messaging me and they can decide what to do with me that is in my best interest. The MA can inform me of whatever emergency happened when they feel it’s safe to do so. This is mainly just a precaution to easy my anxiety. I had to listen to my little sister die over the phone 2,000 miles away three months ago. So, I have a lot of trauma relating to wanting to always be able to answer my phone now. 

So now I would like advice to get rid of this post anesthesia blah feeling I have. Should I hydrate more? Should I eat before doing the treatment? 

I welcome any suggestions or advice on how to get over the blah feeling I have. Because I would rather not feel like this after every session. I still have the lingering stress headache from the anti nausea medication taste triggering me earlier. 

If you made it this far thank you for taking the time to read about the start of my Spravato journey.

So far I have tried Araku Signature, BT Attikan Estate, BT Vienna Roast, BT Silver Oak, BT Riverdale Estate, BT French Roast. I have tried them black, and with milk.

I am shifting from filter coffee, and I like my coffee better with a dash of milk. I usually have 200ml of aeropress coffee with like 10-20 ml of milk. Of the ones I tried, I like attikan & french roast the most.

Suggest me some new beans to try, fellas.

1pbyswo,https://www.reddit.com/r/Malliem/comments/1pbyswo/attention_students_all_gemini_students_must_be/,"""Attention students! All Gemini students must be locked in their rooms NOW.""","My college takes star signs way too seriously.

""Is that understood?""

The Dean was lecturing me, and I stared down at my lap, trying to fathom how I had gotten myself into this situation.

Guards stood behind me, as if I were some escaped psychopath.

Every time I shifted, I noticed them snap to attention out of the corner of my eye.

I was supposed to belong here, to find myself.

What I had found was a student body deadly serious about separating students according to the zodiac.

My gaze flicked to an astrology chart on the wall, where the school's least favorite sign had been scribbled out in permanent marker.

The Dean's office was an astrologer’s dream. The Dean herself was my mother’s age, a scowling woman who seemed more shadow than person. 

A projector illuminated constellations across the room, casting her face in eerie white light. 

I had been lazily following Orion across the walls when she finally snapped, and I jerked to attention, my eyes rolling back to her.

""Miss Oliver!""

I nodded, my cheeks burning. 

Orion skimmed across her face, and I found myself mesmerized by how beautiful the star looked.

Her office was fairly cozy, a messy kind of cozy. Books and papers piled around her, empty coffee mugs sat half-forgotten, and star maps were spread across her laptop, their corners stained with coffee.

""It was a mistake,"" I finally said through the lump in my throat.

It wasn’t a mistake.

But it’s not like I could admit that.

For some reason, along with this college’s draconian rules centered around the zodiac of all things, there was one sign in particular that had been outcast.

I turned my attention back to the scribbled-out symbol.

Subtle.

Gemini.

If there was ever a zodiac sign people disliked, it wasn’t Gemini.

I grew up with classmates hating Pisces because no one wanted to be a fish, or Cancer because of the crab. But Gemini?

Gemini was in the summer months, and the constellation, in my opinion, was beautiful.

But not to these guys.

Starting my freshman year, I began to notice how badly Gemini students were treated, especially the guys.

Being a late admission, I was new, along with another kid who, at first, seemed like the class clown. He was friendly enough, introducing himself with a grin.

We were asked for our star signs as an icebreaker, or what I thought was an icebreaker, and he shrugged with a small smile.

""Uh, I think I’m a Gemini?"" he said, sounding unsure, leaning back in his chair.

""Yeah. I was born on June 10th. I’m a Gemini.""

I expected that to be the end of it, but instead I noticed a sudden shift in the air, like he had just confessed to murdering his whole family.

The girl next to him inched away, dragging her laptop with her, while the rest of the class seemed to collectively let out a breath before twisting toward the back of the room.

It was almost robotic, their heads snapping around, eyes narrowing. 

I hadn’t even noticed the four students in the shadows, hunched over their MacBooks. 

The professor’s expression seemed to crumple, his eyes darkening significantly.

""I think…"" He spoke in a sharp breath before seemingly collecting himself. ""You should go join your friends at the back.""

The Gemini kid seemed baffled and a little hurt.

The air was thick, every eye burning into him. I felt like they were looking at me too. The professor's eyes were wide, lips curled, like he might say something. 

But he just shook his head, seemingly gathering himself.

""I'm confused,"" the kid laughed nervously, almost jumping out of his chair when a girl behind him kicked his bag across the floor. He sent her a questioning look.

""Is… is this some kind of joke?""

""Now."" The professor wasn’t even looking at him.

""But…"" The boy tried to laugh. ""It's just a star sign, right?""

""I will not ask you again,"" the professor said stiffly. He didn't move, as if doing so would mean being closer to the boy. 

He folded his arms across his chest. ""If you do not move to your designated seat right now, you're out of my class.""

To my surprise, the boy got up and moved to the back, ignoring students cringing away from him. He didn't speak again, sticking to his assigned group. 

I noticed everyone else had been separated into their zodiac signs.

Leos were at the front, with Sagittarius and Libra surrounding them. The other star signs were harder to make out. 

I thought it was just that class that took the zodiac a little too seriously.

But no.

This thing had spread across campus like a virus.

Students didn't care about their grades or what careers they were going to get. 

Because the star signs at the top of the social hierarchy had the faculty wrapped around their little fingers. 

A Libra girl found out she was no longer compatible with a Scorpio and stopped talking to him.

The entire campus had gone fucking crazy. Including the faculty.

It was only certain star signs that were allowed extra credit and invited into exclusive clubs, while the rest of us were left in the dust. Geminis were either treated like dirt or feared, like they were carrying a contagious disease. 

It was like going back to middle school.

In the sixth grade, I was proud of my star sign. I liked to think I had a secret twin, after learning about the story behind the constellation. Castor and Pollux, twin brothers transformed into Gemini.

I used to draw the twins on the backs of my hands, daydreaming up my very own.

Mina Lucas, a Pisces, called me a two-faced bitch. Because Gemini had two faces. So, I called her an ugly fish.

This was middle school, though.

It's normal for kids to build personalities around star signs.

College students, however, are grown adults.

It was fine to base a crush around a star sign or compatibility. But your whole life? Your social circle and education?

It was bad enough that my classmates were brainwashed by stars, but the professors too? It didn't make sense.

It didn't make sense that my roommate had a mental breakdown the night before because she didn't have anything blue to wear. 

According to her star sign, she had to wear blue to have a good day.

Geminis were either mercilessly bullied by students and professors alike or treated like they were invisible.

I had noticed over the last few days, disgust had turned to fear.

Instead of bullying Geminis, other students steered clear of them.

I saw it contorted on every face, wary of the Gemini sitting near them, and presently, I saw it on my Dean's face.

She was scared of me.

The woman may have seemed in control, but I noticed her finger anxiously tapping on her coffee mug, her gaze flashing to and from the clock on the wall. She was waiting for something, her demeanor tense, eyebrows furrowed.

Every passing minute seemed to unnerve her even more.

""A mistake,"" she repeated my words, her tone dripping with sarcasm.

""Yes."" I didn’t look her in the eye, swiping my clammy hands on my jeans.

What was I supposed to say?

I didn't want to associate myself with what I thought was a trend, a TikTok thing that would fizzle out like everything else. 

But I was staring down at a handwritten letter crumpled between my fists, from an anonymous tattletale calling out my real star sign.

The crossed O's stood out.

Who wrote like that?

I had been hiding under the facade of being a Sagittarius, since Sagittarius and Leo seemed to be the ""It"" signs. 

They stood on some fucking pedestal, ruling over campus like some messed-up clique.

The letter was like a slap in the face. I had half a mind to tear it into pieces. 

I stared down at it, my eyes stinging. This letter told me I didn't belong here. 

It told me that because the brainwashed hive mind on campus had decided to collectively despise the star I was born under, I was something to be feared, like an animal.

""Who *sent* this?"" I managed to get out. I squeezed the paper in my fist.

Dearest Dean,

The passive-aggressive tone made my blood boil.

I would like you to know of a traitor amongst you, a Sagittarius by the name of Oliver, who is in fact a Gemini :)

I am SO sorry for ruining your day :(

Anon.

I didn't know whether to laugh or cry. When I looked up, the Dean's glare was pinpointed directly in the middle of my forehead.

If looks could *kill.*

""I don't know what to say,"" I squeezed out.

She hummed. ""Well, you can start by explaining yourself.""

She had to be kidding, right?

No.

When I looked her dead in the eye, this woman was being serious.

""Miss Oliver, I am horrified that you would disguise yourself as a Sagittarius."" She curled her lip. ""As one myself, I should have sensed that our energy was wrong, polluted with your presence. But I let my guard down.""

I slammed the letter down. This woman was certifiably insane.

""Who sent this?"" I asked again, harsher this time.

""That is none of your concern,"" the Dean said. ""You lied, Miss Oliver.""

""About my zodiac sign."" I sucked in a breath. ""It's really not a big deal.""

Her eyes darkened. ""As you will discover, Miss Oliver, it is extremely important that we know where every Gemini is."" Her gaze flicked to her MacBook screen. ""Especially when certain measures have been put in place.""

""Measures?"" I straightened in my seat. ""What kind of measures?""

Her lip curled. ""You are a late arrival. It is your fault for not arriving on time.""

""You're kidding."" I scoffed. I was done. It was one thing for students to behave this way.

But grown adults?

The Dean couldn’t justify it. And even if she tried, she would be declared insane.

I leaned forward, testing the boundaries. I wasn’t surprised when the Dean lurched back. ""Was it a bad experience?""

She blinked. ""I don't understand.""

""A bad experience you had,"" I repeated. ""With a Gemini.""

The words suffocated my mouth, eager to spill out.

After weeks of feeling like I was back in sixth grade, finally confronting the root of the problem felt good.

""Because that is all it is, what you're all unhealthily obsessed with."" I spoke through my teeth now, weeks of repressed anger bubbling over. ""They're just stars. They don't mean anything to anyone, except children.""

""Miss Oliver—""

""See?"" Tracing along the constellation mapped out on her desk, I prodded each static light. To my confusion, it was the Gemini constellation, which was ironic.

I stabbed at the twin stars, Castor and Pollux, and then Alhena.

I nodded to Orion, projected across the wall. ""Stars. They're just stars. Dead and dying planets, or if you're religious, your long-dead relatives. Whatever.""

I pointed at the map crinkled under her MacBook, and the Dean once again flinched, her body angling away from me.

She leaned back like I was contagious. One of the guards started forward, no doubt to grab me, but she shook her head, keeping that professional, if slightly strained, smile.

""There is no need,"" the Dean said sharply, and the guards stepped back. ""Miss Oliver is understandably upset."" She cleared her throat.

""Please vacate your current dorm and move into the old building across campus where we house Geminis without rooms.""

The Dean stood before I could reply. ""I don't expect to see you in my office again.""

I grabbed my bag, rising to my feet. ""You're not throwing me out?""

Her lip twitched. ""We do not suspend Gemini students, Miss Oliver.""

""But what if I want to leave?""

""Because of the measures in place.""

Something warm wriggled up my throat, and I tried to speak, but the guards were already politely shoving me out of her office.

The Dean's words didn’t leave my mind until I was halfway across campus, out of breath and regretting every word I'd spat.

She’d sent me away with a warning and an order to leave my dorm room effective immediately and move into the old building off-campus. I had seen it in passing, a large, crumbling structure that used to be the student dorm.

The door was broken, bars on the windows. There was no way I was staying there. Couch-crashing in a friend's dorm seemed a lot better.

Elle was a Leo and insisted she didn’t care about star signs.

Coming from a Leo, that was rich. She had the full Leo experience.

I was moving into her room later that evening, playing cloak and dagger with the security guards on shift, when the announcement played over the intercom.

""Starting from 8pm, please lock ALL Geminis in their rooms. It is upon us.""

Elle froze, her eyes widening. Until that moment, she had been unusually quiet, the two of us cross-legged on the floor eating Chinese food. I thought she was just tired from classes.

She didn’t react at first. She sent me a sleepy smile, then said she was going to grab beer from the kitchen.

What I didn’t expect was for her to come back wielding one of her mom’s butcher knives. I stepped back, but her eyes terrified me. Her whole body trembled, fingers tightening around the handle.

Her expression twisted with a feral fear I couldn’t understand. ""Elle,"" I bit back a cry. ""Hey. It's me. It's Smith.""

""Get out."" She sobbed through the words. Her ponytail swung as she twisted toward the door. ""Please. I don’t want to hurt you."" She waved the knife wildly, and I raised my arms, my heart catapulting into my throat.

""You have fifteen minutes,"" the voice drawled, and Elle's expression hardened. 

""I repeat. Please lock ALL Geminis inside their rooms immediately and find a safe place. This warning will expire at 5am. Eight hours from now.""

A sudden bang outside set off my fight or flight, doors slamming and running footsteps. I found my eyes glued to the blade in my best friend’s hand. 

They were fucking serious about this.

The Dean really had turned a whole campus of students against one singular star sign.

Elle’s frightened eyes found me, and I lowered my arms. ""Wait, are you going to stab me?"" I took a slow step back towards the door. ""Because I was born in May?"" 

I couldn’t resist a laugh. ""You told me you didn’t care about the zodiac! You said all of this was BS! So, why now?"" 

Another step, and she squeaked. 

""Do you want to fit in, Elle? Are the other Leo’s making you do this?” 

She didn’t respond, and that pissed me off even more.

Elle didn’t know why she was afraid of me, because her head had been filled with crap.

I raised my arms in mock surrender. ""Why are you looking at me like that? Elle, I'm not going to hurt you! When have I ever...?"" 

I didn’t expect to cry, but my eyes were stinging. I could hear screaming, Geminis being attacked and locked up. I risked a step back, and her grip on the knife changed, like she was ready to use it.

""You are brainwashed,"" I said slowly. ""The Dean wants you to be scared. She's crazy, Elle. Like, delusional! She has some crazy vendetta against Geminis, and she's punishing us!""

Elle choked out a cry. ""Last month,"" she spoke through a sob. 

""One of you got into my room,"" Elle shook her head rapidly, squeezing her eyes shut. ""Just leave,"" she squeaked. 

""I’m sorry, Smith. I’ll explain, I promise. But you need to find someplace else, and it can't be here. It can't be tonight.”

She smiled, but her lips were strained, eyes wide. 

When I moved to try and reassure her, she jumped back, like a deer caught in headlights.

She was terrified of me.

""Lock yourself up,"" my friend said softly, and I realized I had lost her. ""But don’t hurt yourself."" Elle sniffled. ""They can climb through the windows and sense light. They follow it. So make sure to turn them off and stay down."" Her expression darkened.

""Can you promise me something?""

I found myself nodding dizzily.

Elle squeezed her eyes shut. ""Don’t look up.""

My gut twisted into tangled knots. ""What?""

Elle's words set something off inside me, but she was already dropping the knife and grabbing me gently, pushing me through the door. 

I was being shoved out into the hallway, my bags thrown in my face, when the alarms started blaring, red lights swarming the hallways.

I saw shadows darting in and out of rooms, others being shoved inside, while retreating figures made for the elevators.

A boy was violently dragged out by a girl and thrown on his ass. At that moment, I stopped seeing students. Kids. I was seeing wild animals crawling backward on their hands and knees, frightened eyes darting for a safe getaway.

A girl ran into me, dropping onto her knees before catapulting into a sprint.

She was caught by three guys who dragged her away, kicking and screaming.

I had no choice.

It was 7:50 when I found myself standing in front of the old building, halfway across campus, the alarms still ringing in my ears. 

The dorm looked more like a boarding house, with maybe two or three floors. The night felt eerily still, a half-moon poking through the clouds.

There was something glued to the front door, a simple white sheet of paper.

On it, scrawled in permanent marker, was: ""NO."" in bold letters.

The O was crossed, I noticed. Which was familiar.

""Five minutes,"" the intercom screeched, and in my panic, I knocked three times.

""Hello?"" I banged again. ""Hey, can someone let me in?""

I swallowed hard. ""I'm a...""

My star sign tangled in my throat when a crash sounded behind me. I twisted around. A group of students were dragging two others, bound and gagged, hauling them into a car trunk.

My stomach lurched into my throat. I turned back to knock again, only for my fists to meet something warm. 

A shadow stood in the doorway, golden light bleeding around him. 

I could barely make out his face, just a mop of reddish curls.

He tugged the paper off the door and held it out. The handwriting was unmistakable.

""No means no,"" he said, and moved to slam the door. I quickly wedged my heel in the way, blocking it.

He tried to shut the door on my foot, and in my panic, I shoved it back in his face.

The guy sputtered but didn’t try again. I made sure not to let my guard down.

“You told the Dean about me?” I hissed. “I’m sorry, did we go back to sixth grade?”

He snorted. “You can talk.”

More screams rang out behind us. I couldn’t resist trying to slip through the gap in the door, but he shoved me back, quick as a whip.

“What?”

The shadow paused, then stepped into the light. I glimpsed narrowed eyes and freckles. I tried to push past him, but he stood stubbornly in the way.

His eyes were hidden by a scuffed pair of Ray-Bans. “Ah, yes, the traitor!” he said, like he’d been waiting for this exact moment. “Hiding in Sagittarius, thinking we wouldn’t notice.” He cocked his head. “How’s that working out for ya?”

I heard laughter behind him.

Looking closer, I noticed something metal clamped around his wrist.

Was he... chained up?

“Traitor?” I managed to say.

He nodded with a grin. I had no doubt he’d stood in front of a mirror rehearsing these lines. It was either that, or he was a psychopath.

“The secret Gemini,” he said, making a huge show of blocking my way. “You’re actually famous around here! We turned your room into a relaxation lounge, so unfortunately...” 

He dragged out the “ey” sound like he was auditioning for The Joker. “There’s no room at the inn, dude.”

His lips curled into a spiteful smile. Behind me, another crash echoed.

Ice shot down my spine. I couldn’t bring myself to turn, to witness more brutality. The guy stiffened, but if he was scared, he didn’t show it.

He had too much pride. He hiked his glasses up his nose, revealing eyes shadowed by an eerie glow spreading across his pupils. 

For a moment, I thought I saw hurt crumple his expression, but in the blink of an eye it was gone, replaced with a surprisingly convincing façade.

His gaze followed mine.

Another kid was being mercilessly dragged across the parking lot.

When I turned back to him, his expression had darkened.

He slid his glasses back into place with emphasis. 

I swore this guy thought he was in fucking Glee. 

“Have fun locking yourself up,” he said, saluting me with two fingers before stepping back. Another jingle, and he flinched. 

This time, I saw it clearly, a rusted chain wrapped around his ankle and right wrist. 

He noticed me staring, and his lips curled into a scowl. The kid stepped behind the door, clearly embarrassed.

“This is your two-minute warning,” the intercom blared, still loud even halfway across the grounds.

Hearing the announcement, the guy gently kicked my foot out of the way, and I almost fell on my ass.

I could hear voices as I shuffled back. I checked my phone.

7:58.

Fuck.

“Wait,” I managed to hiss out.

He stopped for a moment, letting out a sigh.

“It wasn't hard to just accept your star sign,” he grumbled. “The rest of this school are psychos, but we take care of our own.”

“It's a *star sign*!” I gritted out. “Why are you going along with this?”

His jaw clenched. “You should go,” he hesitated. “The top floor is usually safe. Head to the girls' bathroom and lock yourself up.”

“You're fucking insane!”

I think part of me was hoping he was just trying to scare me, and then drag me inside at the last moment. 

But no, this kid really was throwing me to the animals.

The guy shrugged. “Yeah…” He shot me a grin. “Byeeeeee!” he said, slamming the door a little too hard in my face.

“Asshole!” I yelled, kicking the door. 

*“You shouldn't have sided with the Leo’s!”* He rebuttaled. 

Across campus, the warning lights were still flashing.

*“Why did you do that?”*

Another guy’s voice hissed from behind the door.

*“Because she’s a traitor.”*

*“Yeah, but she’s stuck out there,” a girl joined in. “Aren’t you being a little too harsh?”*

*“Nope. She can sit out there and rot.”*

I left them to argue and made my way back onto campus.

7:59.

Bathroom.

That was all I could think of. I started toward the main building when movement flashed in the corner of my eye. I saw them pouring out from campus, illuminated in brilliant orange from the torches in their hands.

Leos.

I recognized several faces from my class. They moved as one, a large group heading across campus toward the clearing in the woods.

They wore pajamas, normal clothes, like they were going to hang out.

But something in the air, prickling across my skin, told me different.

There were exclusive clubs on campus, but this was on a whole other level.

I ducked, mapping a way to get on campus without being caught.

If I could get to the door and make a clean break through the cafeteria, I could dive into the girls' bathroom next to the elevator.

I dropped to my knees, attempting to crawl, when I saw her.

The bright red hair was a giveaway, her bobbing ponytail frenzied as she joined the others.

Elle.

Another frantic look at my phone.

8:02.

I didn’t expect her to see me. She was looking around frantically, unlike the others whose eyes were set forward. It looked like she was searching for a way out, staggering over uneven ground.

Then her eyes found mine. 

Initially, Elle looked relieved, and then her gaze went to the sky, flicking back to me. She strayed back, before stumbling over, pulling something from her jeans pocket. It was a much sharper knife, the blade glinting under the moonlight cast across the grounds.

“Tell me your name,” she said in a squeak. “I need to know it’s you.”

I had half a mind to question her before I remembered the Gemini boy chained up.

""Smith,"" I gasped out. ""I'm… I'm Smith.""

Elle hesitated. She twisted around, scanning the night, and then turned back to me. Her frenzied eyes searched mine. ""What is my most embarrassing story?""

""What?!""

In two strides, she was holding the knife to my throat, her hand trembling. The steel was cold, and I had no doubt that she wouldn't hesitate to press deeper.

""Say it, Smith. Word for word.""

Behind her, the Leos were gone, with only some stragglers left behind. 

I nodded slowly, trying to ignore the blade digging into my skin. 

This was my new normal.

""You… you had your period in your boyfriend's parents' new car,"" I whispered. ""You still have nightmares about it.""

Her expression crumpled with relief, and she dropped the knife.

""How about mine?"" I urged her.

Elle surprised me with a quiet laugh. ""You barfed tacos all over your crush on your first date,"" she choked out. ""And he never talked to you again.""

I started to speak, but Elle tugged off her jacket, wrapping it around my eyes.

At first, I fought back, but then her hands, and then her fingernails, dug into the bare flesh of my arms. Her touch was reassuring as she dragged her hands up my arms and then grasped hold of my shoulders.

""I told you not to look up,"" her voice came out in an annoyed hiss.

""I didn't,"" I bit back a cry when she dug her nails in further. ""What's happening?""

""I'll explain later.""

""How can you guys tell who is a Gemini?"" I whispered. ""I don't get it.""

Elle didn’t respond for a moment. ""Your eyes,"" she whimpered. ""It's in your eyes.""

""What do you mean by that?""

""Shush,"" Elle muttered. ""Just stay quiet, okay?""

Elle pulled me to my feet, and I staggered blindly, trying to balance myself. ""I'll take you to the bathroom,"" she breathed, shoving me forward. ""But if you tell anyone I helped you–""

""I won't."" I tripped over something, almost falling on my face. The further we went, the more I could sense something… light.

It started as a pinprick behind my eyes, before spreading, light bleeding through the material of Elle's jacket. There was one bright spot of light, and then another, and another.

Speckled illuminations like glitter illuminating the night.

Closer, they told me.

I followed them almost giddily, watching them burn through Elle's jacket. When the sound of thundering footsteps sliced through me, I turned my head, trying to sense where it was coming from.

""What's that?"" I didn’t realize I was laughing until manic giggles spurted from my lips. It was like being high, my thoughts bleeding into cotton candy.

Suddenly, all I wanted was to see the lights. They felt so far away, and yet also like I could reach them, plucking them straight out of the sky. I laughed again, my body a puppet as I reached out and tried to catch them in my palm.

""I said be quiet!"" Elle whisper-shrieked.

""I am!""

I was curious about the light. It was so bright, and I was missing out on fully taking it in. I stumbled again, this time my footsteps tangled. I didn’t hear the voice until it was in my head, a whisper telling me to pull away the blindfold.

It was choking me, suffocating my thoughts and filling me with a taste of her. I saw it, just a glimpse dancing across my peripheral vision.

I had my fingers clawing into Elle's jacket, ready to rip it off, when someone else did it for me.

""Leo. What are you doing out here?""

The voice was familiar, but it was being drowned out.

By its light.

Its song.

""I'm locking her up,"" Elle said shakily.

Darkness made way for light, and I blinked rapidly. I could sense my head tipping back, and then Elle's fingers in my hair, trying to shove my head down.

Blinking rapidly, I saw the Dean of the college, and my best friend's pale face.

And then I saw the stampede suffocated in shadow, silhouettes passing me, ethereal light illuminating otherwise vacant eyes. The lights resembled stars themselves, dancing through the night.

It was the same light that was seeping into me. It felt cozy and warm, already ignited inside them.

I could tell who they were from their attempts to lock themselves up. 

I glimpsed handcuffs around wrists, makeshift ropes still clinging to arms and ankles, duct tape over mouths. 

When my gaze followed the horde, I caught sight of a cuffed ankle, a stray chain trailing behind him, the guy who locked me out. 

He moved slowly, like a zombie. His glasses were awkwardly placed on the top of his head, eyes drowned by that… that light.

I caught a slight wrinkle in his brow. 

When the others matched forwards, he stumbled back for a moment.

*Was he… pretending to be part of the hoard?*

He was a good actor, perfectly mimicking the others. 

His head was tipped back, arms by his sides, eyes forward, unblinking. 

His gaze flickered to me, lips mouthing five single words. 

**Do not fucking look up.**

But I couldn't *not* look. 

The light was teasing me, seeping into me like honey.

It wasn't moonlight. I could glimpse the crescent glowing under the clouds.

Geminis.

They were bathed in it, a swimming glow I wanted to dive into.

All of them.

Where were they going?

Unlike the Leos, their expressions were blank as they staggered along, akin to a crowd of zombies. I remember not being able to concentrate on the Geminis.

Something was holding onto me, winding its way into my brain. 

I felt it reach directly into the back of my head, phantom fingers taking me into its grasp. I didn't mean to look up. I tipped my head back, drinking in the sky above me, and the night that suddenly felt alive. 

In the corner of my eye, the Gemini guy was grabbing his friends, pulling them into the trees. The Gemini horde stopped suddenly, heads tipping back, glowing eyes following suit. I blinked twice. 

Elle was already covering my eyes, and I wrenched her hands away so I could see… clearly.

I could feel it, sense it, consuming me, filling my thoughts with a lulling fog.

""Smith!""

Elle's eyes found mine, and she dropped to her knees. Like she was scared of me. 

I remember her lips had formed the words in breathy sobs. **Don't look–**

Before she could reach up, I blinked again, and this time it was a longer one.

I started toward… something…

It was there. I just had to reach as high as I could.

Then I would be able to… touch it.

Starry eyes surrounded me, but I don't remember being scared. 

Elle's cry rattled in my skull as I felt my body lurch on its own, driven by something else, a sentient thing inside me. 

I could feel my mind filling with fog. It told me to go to sleep, and I did.

When I came to, it was no longer night. Artificial white light buzzed above me.

The first thing I felt was something wet oozing down my chin.

Then… cool porcelain pressed against my cheek.

I was in a bathroom stall, my head stuck down a toilet bowl.

But it was different from waking up hungover.

I felt... filthy.

My body was aching, a striking pain rippling across the back of my head. 

When I lifted my neck slightly, a snapping sound made me jump, like my bones were popping back into place. 

My memory was gone, my thoughts a whirlwind lost to the dark. I could still see Elle's face illuminated in that startling light.

The shadowy horde around me, starry eyes burning into me.

Then there was nothing.

The familiar ice-cold graze of porcelain greeted me when I pried my eyes open.

There was something in my mouth, and I spat it out, expecting stale barf. What I wasn’t expecting was a wet piece of flesh to splash down into the bowl.

It took me several seconds to realize the toilet bowl I had my head down was not empty.

In the flickering light from the broken fixture above me, I saw the glistening red first, spattered on the lid, and when I looked down, on the floor too, staining my knees.

And then I saw all of it. The bulging, slimy red mess sticking from the bowl.

I lurched back, and something was stuck at the back of my throat.

I reached into my mouth, cringing, and pulled out what looked like a mauled finger, skinned of flesh. 

There were only spiky pieces of bone fragments clinging to shredded muscle.

Something inhuman croaked from my lips, and I slammed my hands over my mouth, my gut twisting.

I looked up.

Red.

I looked down.

More red.

Vivid, wet, and recent.

I was covered in dirt and grass stains, my legs bloodied and bruised, half of my hair ripped out.

The walls around me were the same shade, glistening, pooling, disgusting red, dripping and staining every surface.

The lumpy red mass sticking from the toilet bowl suddenly looked less like a mass the more I was looking at it, blinking through the blinding light.

At some point, I screamed, heaving up the rest, wet globules of fat spilling from my mouth. There was a head in the toilet bowl, stuck right under, like I had been trying to hide the evidence.

The head didn’t look like a head, half of its skull crushed. But I could still make out familiar features. Eyes still wide open, lips frozen in what looked like a scream.

The rest of her had presumably been flushed, but I could still see pieces of her clinging to the rim of the toilet.

Elle. 

Oh god, fuck, I killed my best friend. 

I'm still sitting here. I can't bring myself to move. Normal college life still goes on outside, and I can't understand how. 

I found myself back at the Gemini house a few hours ago. It was locked, but there was a small key wrapped in some paper. 

**I was FORCED to give you this, Oliver. Don't touch my stuff. You're sharing with Elena. Don't think this means any of us trust you. Welcome to the madhouse.**

“Coming in?”

The voice startled me. 

I twisted around, and there he was, the asshole Gemini. 

I took pleasure in walking away, dumping both the key and the note in the trash. 

I ask this as a Gemini. 

Preferably on campus, but this goes for all of you. 

Did any of you kill and eat someone last night with no memory of doing so? 

I'm starting to think the Gemini constellation is something more than a group of stars after all.

1pbyr3d,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepcast/comments/1pbyr3d/joy_part_2_finale/,JOY (Part 2 - Finale),"I don’t know how much time had passed, but I was waking up. My eyes were shut, and I refused to open them; I refused to move. I focused as much as I could on listening to my surroundings. I couldn’t hear much over my thunderous heartbeat and the blood rushing in my ears. I knew I must have been shaking by this point, along with the sweat beading on my brow. It would know I was awake.

I opened my eyes just a peek, and couldn’t see anything. It was dark in the room. I opened them a little wider and glanced around. There was a gentle light seeping in from around the blinds. They had been closed. I tried to sit up and found that I couldn’t, and began to panic. It felt like something was wrapped around my body, just leaving room for my head. I fought against the force and managed to free my hand. I pushed away at whatever was binding me and found that it was my bedsheets. I felt around with my free hand.

I was in my bed; I hadn’t been able to tell at first because the dark room hid the details, and I was so disoriented. I had been tucked in so tightly with every blanket I had that I could barely move. With effort, I wiggled out of my restraints more and reached for the lamp.

I whipped my head around as I flicked on the light. Amber glow chased away the darkness so that it now hid in shadows. I looked around, but could not see anything. All I could sense was that smell of damp earth. I saw my phone was on the nightstand. I quickly grabbed it and tried to unlock it. It was dead.

I swore under my breath and hesitantly got out of bed. My hangover was fierce; it almost was like I could feel each tired organ shift a little slower than the rest of my body with every motion. I felt like I was going to throw up.

I took a moment to swallow the bile, and tip-toed towards my door. I glanced around the hallway and couldn’t see anything. I slowly made my way down the hall and into the kitchen. Every tentative step was taken slowly, pausing to listen for the apparition. Any shred of a belief that this was all in my head died when I saw my kitchen and living room.

All of the cabinets had been flung open. At a glance it looked like the contents were all there, but had been rifled around in. The fridge looked like it had been raided as well, hanging just barely open. None of this bothered me more than what was set at the table though.

There was a plate of breakfast cereal. As I approached I could see it glisten as though it were wet. Picking up one of the mushy cheerios I could tell that they were in fact wet; it was like someone had poured water on the plate. Next to the plate was a mug. Looking at the murky slosh inside, it was kind of hard to tell what it was, but the spilled coffee grounds next to the setup gave it away. Someone had poured raw coffee grounds into the cup and stirred cold water into it. Possibly the worst part was sitting to the other side of the plate. It was a newspaper clipping, and right away I knew exactly what it was.

It was my father’s eulogy from when he passed away seven years ago. I had gone out and bought the local paper that day just to get this clipping. I didn’t use the newspaper otherwise, and that was probably why it had grabbed the eulogy. It was all it could find for a newspaper for this cliché breakfast it had set up.

I took a step back when I heard a sigh come from right behind me. I turned slowly, not wanting it to be true. She sat at my kitchen counter at one of my barstools. She stared at me with those huge silver eyes, her mouth agape in boundless joy. She looked just as horrible in the day, even more so now that I was in a more coherent state of mind. She wasn’t some illusion or nightmare; she was staring right at me.

“Enjoy…” She said in that whispered sing-song voice.

I stared back at her, unable to move or think. I looked back at the plate, and returned my gaze to her.

“What are you?” I barely managed to squeak out.

She cocked her head to the side so quickly I had hardly seen it move.

“Joy…” She replied. She began to pet and stroke her messy blonde hair with one hand, while pointing at the plate with those long fingers on her other hand. “Enjoy…” She repeated.

I shook my head, “This can’t be real, this can’t be real!” I begged my own mind to allow the illusion to fade. I looked back at her, and she was still there, only now she was standing. She was very tall, but hunched down so that we were eye to eye. Her head was still tilted at that angle which now appeared way too extreme.

“Enjoy…” It said once again, its fingers now trying to play with each other; wrapping around one another like a ball of worms.

“Fuck you!” I shouted and bolted for my front door. If this was an illusion I needed some serious mental help, and if it wasn’t I had to get the hell out of there. That door was my salvation either way.

I made it to the other side of the couch when it lunged at me. She moved so quickly I didn’t even see her legs propel her. I had hoped the couch would slow her down, but she passed straight through the couch as though it were made of mist. Within a second she was in my face.

I screamed, and prepared to be attacked. Instead, her body went through mine like it did the couch. My instinctual thought was relief; it wasn’t real. Now behind me, she laughed like she had just heard the funniest joke in the world. I saw her hands wrap around my body from behind, and lower into my own. As her arms phased into my flesh, I felt the muscles begin to tighten. When I lost sight of her fingers within mine, they all stiffened and shot out. With horror, I watched my hand clench into a fist, and unclench. My fingers wiggled. I could feel them rubbing against each other, but I had no control over them. I could feel the taught muscles begin to scream in defiance of the strain, but they no longer obeyed me.

I felt my legs go stiff as well. I hadn’t even seen her enter them. I was so focused on my hands, but as soon as they stiffened I felt my body shift to the side as I took one large clumsy step back towards the table. From just behind my head I could hear her hum a tune which at any other moment might have been pleasant, but was only terrifying right now. I took another step towards the table. I screamed in agony and fear, but to no avail. I begged her to stop, to let me go. That is when the humming behind me stopped, and I felt the muscles in the face begin to pull against my will.

My voice disappeared. I felt my eyes go wide, and a huge smile spread across my face. From my throat I could hear and feel the tune that Joy had been humming. I was still completely aware, but trapped within my own body. She walked me over to the table and sat me down hard in the chair.

I watched as she puppeted my body into picking up the mug of wet coffee grounds. She brought the mug to my mouth and forced me to drink. The taste was so rancid and bitter that I wanted to puke, but even my automatic bodily responses were not my own. I felt the slurry go down my throat and settle in my stomach. The taste was horrible, but I could not react to it.

The cheerios were next. She guided my hand over the plate and had me grab a handful. I could feel them squish under the iron grip. My arm was pulled to my mouth again as the wet cereal was shoved in. She made me chew, the taste mixing with the coffee slurry that was still around my teeth. The combined textures felt like I was eating from a sewer. I wanted to gag, but could not.

Finally, my hand grabbed the eulogy and held it out. I could only watch through eyes that were no longer my own as they read each line detailing my father’s life and death. Once I had finished reading, I put the clipping down. All at once, I felt my muscles loosen.

I collapsed in a heap on the table. Instantly I threw up, and as hard as I tried to pull away from the vomit, my muscles were on fire and still would barely respond. I hoped I had not torn anything.

Eventually, I was able to turn around and look for the monster that had possessed me. She was gone. I sat at that table for a long time in a stupor. It could have been five minutes, it could have been an hour. I was back in control of my body, but still I was a prisoner within it.

Once I was able to move, I ran as quickly as my ravaged body would take me to my garage. I needed immediate medical help for… whatever was happening. Perhaps I had truly gone insane, or perhaps some demon actually had taken over my body. Whether for the mental or physical, I needed to see someone.

I had almost made it to my car when I was overpowered by the smell of wet earth. I turned in terror to see Joy standing behind me. Her smile never wavered, but she held up one long finger.

“Stress…” She waggled the finger in a disapproving gesture. It danced like a charmed snake on her hand.

I screamed and turned, dashing once again for my car. I didn’t hear her approach, but knew immediately when she caught me. I was taking a large step forward when my muscles clenched, and I flew, carried by the momentum, into the side of my car. I felt my head hit the metal, but couldn’t scream. She made me awkwardly stand up and walk back into the house.

It was the strangest feeling, wanting to cry but not being able to. My brain was sending the impulses to my tear ducts, but they refused to respond. The command simply got stuck right before it reached, so another signal was sent. Then another. It felt like there were insects in my head with all the buzzing the compounding signals were causing.

Joy walked me into my room and lay my body down in my bed. A chuckle escaped my painful smile. I reached over and grabbed my dead phone. My mind, the only thing I had control of, watched helplessly as Joy began swiping a stiff finger up the screen.

I didn’t know what was happening at first. She just kept swiping the black screen with my finger. I thought about the breakfast she had made me while I was unconscious last night. She made my bed, had turned all my lamps on in the evening, and had kept me from driving myself to the hospital. Now, she was swiping at my phone screen. Something that she had seen I like to do.

It is easy to lose yourself when scrolling through short videos on your phone. Before you know it, an hour can fly by. That time felt like hell, trapped in my own body, while Joy used me to imitate the act of scrolling on my dead phone. I felt every minute crawl by. I couldn’t look away, couldn’t close my eyes unless she blinked for me, couldn’t even lose consciousness. Forced to watch that empty rectangle, briefly interrupted by a finger swipe every fifteen seconds or so.

The impulses sent to cause a scream had been stacking for over an hour when I finally felt my muscles loosen. All at once, all of the tears and screams that had been held back forced their way out of my body. My eyes stung with a deluge of tears as I seized and shouted. I curled up into a ball and trembled.

After about fifteen minutes, I could finally move. My entire body was sore, but I forced myself up. I slowly made my way into the kitchen. Joy was sitting at the table, smiling at me, but I completely ignored her as I put my head under the faucet and drank. After I had had my fill, I let the water run down my head for a minute, and then collapsed on the ground. I watched her peek her head around the island counter. She must have gotten on the ground to be at my level, and was just barely showing her wide eyes and tumble of blonde hair. I looked at her helplessly. She peeked out further to show me her smile, and then shot back out of view.

Slowly, I pulled myself up. She had disappeared. I stood there for a time, gathering my strength. Eventually, I began to walk towards my garage again. My head still hurt from where I had hit my car, and I could feel the goose egg on my forehead. I tried to stay calm as I walked down the hall and didn’t bother looking around. I reached the garage door and opened it.

My heart skipped a beat. She was on the other side, head cocked.

“Stress..?” She whispered to me.

I forced a smile. “N-no. No stress. Hungry. I'm going to go get food.”

She held my gaze for an uncomfortable amount of time. Suddenly, she took a step towards me and walked right through me. I yelped, but didn’t feel my muscles tighten. I felt my chest and turned around. She was gone again. I took a panicked but hopeful breath.

I got into my car and started it. I was right. She could take over my body, but not my mind. I pulled out and made my way towards the hospital.

It was about twenty minutes away. I was shaking, but relieved. I had escaped. I was free. I could get help now, and this nightmare would be over. I drove in silence.

After about ten minutes, I went to readjust my mirror. She was in the backseat. I almost drove off the road when I saw her. She was smiling, looking out the window. She pointed at a McDonald's I was driving past.

“Eat…”

I despaired. I realized that she was not going to let me drive to the hospital. I told her I was going to get food, and she was going to hold me to that. Reluctantly, I turned around and pulled into the parking lot.

My initial instinct was to go through the drive-thru. I had an idea, then. I turned and looked at Joy. 

“Are you coming with me?” I asked with a smile.

She returned the smile and nodded quickly. I got out of the car as she phased through the door. I took slow, calm steps towards the door. I turned around to make sure she was following me. She was. She looked at me and smiled with her bright white teeth. She looked like a corpse with her grey skin.

I pushed through the doors and looked around. Nobody gave me a second glance. I turned around to see if she was still there. She was. There was no way she could be confused for a regular person. I looked at her in horror. I watched somebody emerge through her torso. They hadn’t reacted at all as they phased through her. \*Oh, God…\* I thought to myself.

Nobody else could see her. I didn’t know what to do anymore. I was truly alone in this. I began to walk out of the restaurant.

“Eat…” she gently sang.

I turned to look at her. Her head was cocked to the side, and she was swaying her long body. Her blown pupils were like black holes against her silver eyes. Without a word, I walked to the counter and ordered my food. I ended up just eating it at a table in the McDonald’s while she stood there, watching me.

She was with me as I drove home. The entire drive, I desperately thought about what I could do. She only seemed satisfied when she thought I was happy, so I had to pretend to be happy. As I pulled into my garage, I saw Amelia getting her mail. She smiled and waved at me. I gave her a fake smile and waved back. I glanced at Joy and saw that she was staring at Amelia. She looked absolutely ecstatic. I revved my engine and shot into the garage. The tires squealed as I hit the brakes so that I wouldn’t hit the far wall.

I walked straight inside and made my way towards the couch. I sat and put on one of my favorite shows. Joy stood behind me, watching me. I would turn around now and again to see if she was there, and she always was. I began to laugh harder at the jokes, audibly “Aww” at tender moments, and exaggerated every positive reaction I could.

Eventually, I turned around and could see that she was gone. I sighed with relief, but did not let down my guard. I plugged in my phone next to me, and kept watching, kept laughing, and kept smiling. After a while of this, my phone pinged. It was charged enough to turn on. I looked at it and saw that I had a missed call from Rick. I hesitated when I saw this. What would be the right move? What would Joy think would make me happy?

Rick was my friend. I didn’t know if Joy knew this. If I didn’t call him back, it might seem like I was in a bad mood. I smiled at my phone and called him back. It rang twice, then Rick picked up.

“Hey, Johnny.”

“Rick! How are you doing?” I asked in a bubbly tone.

“I’m… uh… good. You sound like you’re doing well.”

“Oh, yeah. I think I just needed to take a day. I’m doing really well right now.”

“Oh, sweet! That’s good to hear! Did you want to come back tomorrow then?”

This made me pause for a moment. If I said no, then Joy might realize that I was not actually in a good mood. I had to keep the act up.

“Yeah, I’m good to go!”

“Great! Have you… uh… heard from Peter since the other day?”

I sucked in a breath. “No, I haven’t. Hey, I actually gotta bounce, but I’ll see you tomorrow, okay?”

“Yeah, man, I’ll see you tomorrow.”

We exchanged goodbyes, and I hung up. I hadn’t even thought about Peter since the other day. Peter. What was it he had said to me at my door? \*I’m here to bring you joy…\*

That bastard. His truancy from work, his odd behavior, his stiff movements. He had Joy before me. He brought me Joy. After that, he had simply driven away and never looked back.

I felt sick to my stomach. I put my head in my hands and groaned. I had done nothing to him; I was simply vulnerable, and he took advantage of that to free himself of Joy. \*Remember, Johnny. There is no better feeling than bringing someone else Joy.\* I clenched my fists in rage when I suddenly smelled wet earth. I turned around, and Joy was behind me again. She was looking at my phone. I realized that I was clearly upset.

“That’s over now!” I put my phone down and smiled at her. “I should whip some dinner up and watch a movie!”

Joy nodded. “Watch…”

I threw a frozen pizza in the oven and found a movie to watch. I spent the rest of the night as happy as I could pretend to be. After my dinner and movie, I prepared for sleep. I did my nightly routine and climbed into bed. After I turned out the lights, I could still see Joy’s silver eyes reflecting in the dark of the hallway. There were large voids in the center of each where her blown pupils were, refusing to shrink even in the dark. After what felt like hours of acting as though I had never been more comfortable, I fell asleep.

\-

The next day I woke up and looked around my house. Joy was nowhere to be found. I knew she must be watching, so I kept acting happy. I made my breakfast, watched the morning news, and prepared for my day. I climbed into my car, put on the radio, and drove to work.

I smiled and waved to everyone I came across. Rick gave me a hearty greeting, which I returned in kind. I put in my earbuds and got to work.

I tried to lose myself in the day. Every time I got frustrated or annoyed with anything, I looked around. I swore I saw Joy peeking from around some machinery a couple of times, but she never approached. I just did my best to work and smile.

Just before lunch, I was approached by Simon. He had never really liked me; I had taken this job from his buddy, who had gotten fired just before I joined. He didn’t get along with anyone, really, but he had an extra chip on his shoulder for me specifically.

“What the fuck is wrong with you?” He asked as he approached.

I forced my smile. “What do you mean?”

“You’re all smiley and shit. What do you have to be happy about? Excited to blow Rick again so that you don’t have to come into work?”

I gritted my teeth. This was not the right time. I couldn’t let myself appear upset, or else…

I saw her peek from around a corner about thirty feet away. \*Oh, God.\* She was watching me, drumming her long, boneless fingers on the wall. I tried to force a smile at Simon, but it must not have been convincing. She emerged, stretched to her full height. She began to walk towards us.

“The fuck you looking at?” Simon demanded, turning to follow my gaze. He couldn’t see Joy, and thinking I had played a dumb joke on him made him furious. He shoved into my chest. “Fucking prick.” He turned and began to walk away.

My heart was pounding. I tried to stay calm, I waved at his back in a mock gesture of goodwill. Joy did not take the bait. She rushed at me, passing straight through Simon and melting into my body. As she sank beneath my skin, I heard her whisper.

“Revenge…”

I felt my muscles tighten, and took a shaky step forward. I tried to shout to warn Simon, but my mouth, twisted in elation, did not respond to my mind’s demands. My right hand shot out and slammed onto the table next to me. I felt my fingers grip a screwdriver tightly. I swung it forward and began to rapidly approach Simon. A gleeful giggle escaped my mouth as I closed the distance.

Simon heard me approach, turning and shouting, “What the fuck?” as my body pounced. He tried to wrestle the screwdriver from me, but my grip was like iron. I could feel my tendons scream because I was gripping and screaming with such ferocity. My face must have looked so friendly that it appeared deranged, and the gentle hum I sang was icing on the cake.

A few other guys saw the tussle and moved to break us up. It took three men to pull me away. Simon screamed and threatened to kill me, but he was held back. As the men held me, all at once, my body stopped fighting. I just stood there, stiff and smiling.

Rick stormed up, red in the face.

“What the living fuck is going on?”

“That psycho tried to kill me!” Simon screamed.

Rick looked back at me, smiling like a madman, still holding the screwdriver.

“Johnny?” He asked, dumbfounded. I wanted to plead to him for help. To tell him everything wrong. To be free from this demon just long enough so that I wouldn’t be alone in this nightmare.

Instead, my wide eyes locked with his. I felt my arms extend out, and a single word escaped my lips.

“Friend…”

In the group’s confusion, they had loosened their grip on me. At once, I lunged forward, breaking free from their hold. I wrapped my arms around Rick and held him tightly in a twisted embrace. He screamed, and we both fell to the ground. The men once again fell upon us and tried to pull us apart. My hold on Rick was as iron-strong as I had grabbed the screwdriver. My muscles had broken through their biological limits and were using all of their strength in this hug. I was crushing him.

The men resorted to kicking at my sides and back. I felt every impact and wanted to wail, but could not. Eventually, Joy must have decided that being assaulted would make me less happy than hugging my friend, and let go of Rick. He coughed and crawled away.

He turned around and shot a finger at me. Between halting breaths, he screamed. “GET… THE FUCK… OUT!” The other men dragged me to the door. The entire time, I hummed and smiled.

They physically kicked me out of the shop. I landed on the ground awkwardly. My stiff muscles did not let me spill, so I landed like an action figure. The men gave me a weird look and blocked the door back in. The message was clear.

“Home…” I whispered. I stood, waved cheerily to the men who had dragged me away, and got into my car. As I pulled away, I felt Joy release me from her control. I almost crashed as I took control of my body and the car, but stabilized myself. I forced myself not to cry and not to rage. A few tears did escape my eyes, but I ignored them. As far as Joy was aware, almost killing a man, getting the shit kicked out of me, as well as losing my job and my friend, were all the ingredients for a wonderful afternoon.

\-

I whipped into my garage and sat at the steering wheel. I didn’t know what to do anymore. I was out of hope. I thought my life was awful before, but I did not know how bad things could get until the last couple of days. I honestly wanted it all to end right there, but I knew if I took any extreme measures, I would be stopped by Joy. She sat behind me, looking absolutely excited for whatever happened next.

I tried to contain my rage, fear, and sorrow. My knuckles turned white as I gripped my steering wheel. \*Keep it in, keep it in…\* My stomach growled then. I had not eaten lunch.

Joy perked up behind me. Either her hearing was immaculate, or she had some twisted connection to my body.

“Eat…” She sang like a gentle breeze, swaying from side to side.

“NO!” I exploded. “No! I’m not doing what you want anymore! You don’t make me happy! None of this makes me happy! You have ruined my fucking life!” I turned to swing at the demon behind me. My fist passed through her face like it wasn’t there.

But it was. I felt the muscles in my hand tighten as they entered her. My eyes widened with horror. She clapped and bounced like a child. Then, she lunged at me.

She made me throw my car door open so hard, I worried I broke a hinge on it. I took heavy steps down the hall and into the kitchen. She forced my eyes to stare at the refrigerator. I threw open the door and browsed the selection with Joy as my guide. There wasn’t a whole lot in here. I hoped she would at least grab the leftover frozen pizza from last night.

My eyes fell on the raw chicken breast I had been thawing. I felt a happy hum in my throat as I grabbed the raw meat. I threw it on the counter. \*Oh god, can she cook?\* I worried, imagining her burning down my house with me in it, dancing as my skin melted away.

I looked above the fridge and found my breadbox. I pulled out two slices of bread and turned back to the chicken. I put one piece on the counter and grabbed the chicken breast. I realized with horror what was happening as she put the other piece of bread on the raw meat. With the sandwich now done, I lifted it to my mouth.

Even if I could use my body, I’m sure it would not have been able to express my terror as I sank my teeth into the sandwich. I knew immediately when I had reached the raw chicken. There was slight resistance to my teeth until I felt a pop and the flesh cleaved away. As I bit into the breast, I could feel the juice squirt out. It entered my mouth, dribbled down my chin, and soaked the bread. Its sticky texture was sickening. As I chewed, I could tell I had bitten into some fat. It tasted disgusting, but I could not puke, could not spit it out. Joy used my teeth to grind the meat into a paste and swallow the lump. I felt the chicken slide down my throat and travel down into my stomach. Immediately, I began to cramp as my nerves fought to reject the invader, but it was no use. I took another bite. There was a harder texture inside the meat of this bite, and I believed I had bitten into a blood vessel.

For five minutes, I bit, chewed, and swallowed. After the sandwich was gone, she released me again. I punched a hole through my cabinet and threw up on the floor. I pounded the ground and looked up at Joy. She was squatting to get close to my face. The scent of wet earth was overpowering. I forced a pained smile.

“Yum…” I said through a gag. She smiled and nodded.

The doorbell rang. She shot up and glided to the window. I heard her gasp with delight. Slowly, I crawled to the door. I heard a knocking; it was desperate. I climbed to my feet and leaned against the door, looking out the peephole. It was Amelia on the other side.

“Johnny?” I heard her muffled voice call. “Hey, are you okay? I know you’ve been going through a lot, and I saw the way you pulled in earlier. I just wanted to check in on you. I’m getting worried.”

My heart raced. Not because Amelia was showing affection, but because of the way Joy was looking at her. She had her hands clasped tightly together, and her wide-open mouth made it look like she could barely contain her excitement. She turned and looked at me.

“Love…” She whispered.

My blood froze. Panic gripped my chest and took my breath away. I didn’t even register my sickness anymore. I took a small step back.

“No…” I whispered.

She nodded rapidly, her blonde hair whipping back and forth. She extended her arms and began to approach.

“No!” I shouted. “I don’t want her! I want… travel! Vacation! I WANT TO LEAVE!” I screamed these last words at the top of my lungs. The knocking stopped. I don’t know if Amelia stood there, stunned, or ran away. I didn’t dare look.

Joy tilted her head and looked at me. Her silver eyes were dredging mine for any sign of falsity. She nodded, satisfied.

“Travel…” She sang, twirled, and walked away. I wasted no time. I shot up, grabbed any card or cash I had hidden away, and made for my car. Without wasting another minute, I drove away.

\-

I drove east. It was about a day’s worth of travel, stopping once at a motel before I found a large city that I figured would work. I acted as chipper as I could the entire time, but Joy was always watching now. Whether it was behind me in my car, watching from the end of my bed in a rented room, or peeking from around corners.

I cringed back as I saw the familiar sign welcoming visitors into my hometown. Once I was back, I was able to navigate the construction that had been there in my youth by memory alone. I knew the way.

Joy bounced and hummed in my back seat as I pulled into the drive. I hadn’t done a great job keeping up with Jimmy, but from the little I knew, I knew he was staying at his mom’s house, his childhood home, with his brother and sister because of his brother’s sickness.

I almost pulled away then. Looking in the rearview mirror to reverse, she met my eyes. She was becoming a familiar sight to see by now. I hid my despair at the thought of this becoming my day-to-day for the rest of my life. I smiled at her, and she smiled back.

Steeling my resolve, I walked up the steps to his front door. I rang the doorbell. I heard some shuffling from the other side, and Jimmy opened the door.

“Johnny! What are you doing here?”

I've felt a lot of guilt since that day. Guilt for the things I was forced to do, guilt for the things I chose to do, guilt for not being able to take the torture for longer. The thing I feel worst about, though, is the absolute relief and pure elation I felt as I responded to Jimmy.

These 10 things are so small you’ll laugh….... but do any 3 for just 7 days and your body will slap you with “ whoa , I feel GOOD ” .

1. Gulp a big glass of water the second you wake up
   Your brain was thirsty all night. One glass = instant clear head. Science says it wakes you up faster than coffee.

2.Eat something with protein for breakfast (eggs, curd, paneer, shake anything)
   Kills hunger till lunch. Studies say people who do this eat 400 less calories the whole day without trying.

3.Walk 10 mins after lunch or dinner 
      Even slow terrace rounds. Drops your sugar crash, stops food coma. One study says it works better than some diabetes medicines.

4. Charge phone OUTSIDE your bedroom tonight
    Best sleep upgrade on planet Earth. You’ll wake up feeling like you cheated life.

5. Fill half your plate with veggies / salad before anything else
   Magic trick:- you’ll eat less rice roti automatically and still feel full.

6.Craving chips or sweet? Eat 10–15 almonds + one fruit first
   90 % of the time the craving just….... dies. Science confirmed.

7.Stressed or angry? Breathe in 4 seconds, out 6 seconds, 10 times
     Takes 1 minute, calms you faster than shouting. Navy SEALs use this.

8. Every 40 mins stand up and move for 1–2 mins
     Breaks the “sitting is killing me” curse. One huge study says this alone can add years to life.

9. One hour a day NO phone (dinner, morning chai, whatever)
     First day feels weird. Third day feels like freedom.

10. Before sleeping, write 3 things you’ll do tomorrow
      Takes 30 seconds. Next morning you wake up like a boss instead of a zombie.


The dare (super simple). :--
Pick ANY 3 numbers above → do them daily for 7 days → come back here and tell us what happened.


Reply with your 3 numbers (example: 3, 4, 7 gang rise up ) and I’ll reply with the easiest way to stick to it.

Okay, so dating apps have officially defeated me. I've swiped so much I’m starting to think I have carpal tunnel. So here I am, throwing this out into the universe like a message in a bottle... except the bottle is the internet. And I’m still single. 

About me? Alright, strap in: I’m 5’11, from the philippines, dark hair, sweet, loves to cook and bake, a sweet tooth, and got some extra love to give 

I’m actually funny, a little spontaneous, and known to be dangerously sweet. Like, cavity-inducing sweet. My love language is acts of service, so expect things like “I made you coffee” or “I fixed your wifi” instead of just “wyd?” I’m an extreme hobbyist so message me if you want to know all of them hahahaha (too many to enumerate here)

What I’m looking for:
Someone around my age or a few years older, i don’t mind haha. Someone as romantic as I am, not a dry texter. 

If you're into video calls, voice calls, and just general long-distance FaceTime marathons where we both stare at each other in silence but it’s still cute. Be kind, be genuine, and please laugh at my jokes (or at least fake it convincingly).

Is sleeping with with a belly on the belly of your sibling or cousin normal ? Are super tight snuggles between siblings or cousins normal ?,"I am a Chinese Vietnamese guy who was born in Belgium and grew up in Belgium.

I won the kindness award in primary school. I prefer people who are very kind.

I have always felt sexually attracted to thicc sexy blonde Western girls with big boobs.

The first girl that I found sexually attractive was the Canadian American actress Pamela Anderson from the American television series ""Baywatch"".

Nearly all the girls that I feel sexually attractive are thicc sexy blonde Western girls with big boobs with only very few thicc sexy Asian girls with big boobs that I found sexually attractive.

My father watched porn VHS without hiding it. Each time I saw him watching porn movies on the television, I tried to not look at the screen of the television and/or runaway to another room of the house as I found it disgusting. I didn't even know that this genre was called porn back then. I didn't like that my father did that.

Since the separation of my parents when I was 6 years old during my third year in kindergarten, I was always afraid that having a romantic relationship will lead to a separation.

I have a little brother but I don't have a sister and I have always wanted to have a sister who would be intimate with as it is the closest thing to a pure forever unconditional love without seperation for me which nearly became ""true"" when I went to Vietnam during the Summer of 2009.

Before going to Vietnam during the Summer of 2009, when I was in primary school, I watched the French cartoon Titeuf which feature Titeuf having incestuous feelings for his female cousin which was the first time that a story with incest. During my last year of primary school that I watched the Japanese anime Elfen Lied that featured incest between cousins. I liked the story of the Elfen Lied anime as I found it touching. A bit later, I found completely by accident on the internet a Japanese hentai anime that was called Akiba Girls where the protagonist has sex with his adoptive sisters. It was the first time that I saw a hentai anime in my life and I didn't even know what the genre was called back then and it was the first time that I have watched an entire porno in my life and didn't find it disgusting and that I enjoyed due to the fact that it had romance and love that made sex looks beautiful to watch rather than disgusting.

After that, I read romantic and sex stories between brother and sisters on the internet. One day when I think that I was 13 years old, my mother saw my internet history and was angry at me. I said that It was probably a virus that made someone control the computer and searched those things. Since that day, I erased each time my internet history before leaving the computer. My mother instead of asking me gently why I searched this content was only angry at me. I understood that day that my mother will never understand me and thus I will never tell her why.

Years later, I saw a Japanese incest anime called Oreimo where the female protagonist is a 14 years old teenager who was caught by her parents with an incestuous eroge (eroge is a Japanese genre of erotic video game) featuring sex between a big brother and his little sister. The parents where angry at her. This scene reminded me of my past.

But let's go back to the past during the Summer of 2009 when my mom and I went to Vietnam.

My mom and I slept on the ground in the sleeping room of one my elder female cousin. I was 14 years old. My older female cousin was 19 years old. She is my first cousin.

My elder female cousin has a big sleeping room with a poster of Vampire Knight on a wall of her sleeping room. This is how I discovered Vampire Knight. I didn't know back then but Vampire Knight is a Japanese manga and anime television series that features incest.

My female cousin was studying in a Vietnamese university to become a doctor. My elder female cousin doesn't have a brother nor a sister but she had a boyfriend back then.

I was watching the television on the bed of my elder female cousin and my mom said that I had to turn the television off and go on the ground to sleep.

My elder female cousin said that I could sleep with her. I remembered that one of my teacher said something like the reason why parents separate their children from sleeping together is to prevent them from having an incestuous relationship.

I said that we can't sleep together as she has already a boyfriend while a part of me really wanted to sleep with her but the other part in me took over and said no as one of the reasons was what my teacher said.

And she asked my mother multiple times why I cannot sleep with her (my female elder cousin).

A few weeks after, we went on a family trip.

My elder female cousin touched me multiple times for the fun or she layed her head on my shoulder when we were eating breakfast in front of members of my family and her boyfriend which made me feel uncomfortable, embarrassed and I was afraid that I would made her boyfriend jealous but it also felt good. I didn't really know how to react to that as it was the first time that a girl put her head on my shoulder and I was afraid that she felt rejected if I did nothing so I put my hand on my shoulder. Again, I was really embarrassed and afraid to make her boyfriend jealous.

I was not used to touching girls before so I felt a bit uncomfortable at the beginning.

After our trip, we played while brushing our teeth at the same time. After that, we went to her sleeping room. We tickled each other on her bed. Then I layed on her bed in her sleeping room to watch television and closed my eyes while my elder female cousin was fondling my hair and face without me having to ash her.

At this point, the part that wanted to sleep with her took over the part that would say no.

My mom asked her if I could sleep on her bed and my elder female cousin said yes.

During the night, I felt cold because my body doesn't support air conditionning.

I asked her If I could cuddle her because I felt cold due to the air conditionning.

The second reason that also wanted to cuddle her was because I had never cuddled a girl before and was curious to know how it feels to cuddle a girl.

A third reason is that I was not sure if she was okay with it but after all the touchings that she iniatied on me for the fun, I though that maybe she feel okay with me and I felt bad to not have sleeped with her earlier when she asked my mom why I cannot sleep with her multiple times as I am using her sleeping room without giving her something in return, I thought that maybe she wanted me to cuddle her.

My elder female cousin didn't say a word and cuddled me after I asked her to cuddle me.

She put her right leg between my legs automatically.

As soon as my arms and her arms where cuddling, she tighten her hug then fondled my back. It felt so good and warm but there was also a part of me that thought that this was too intimate for a simple family cuddle.

Each time I wanted to loose my arms, she tighted me more. It was a super tight cuddle. It hurt my arm but I felt so good at the same time as I felt loved. Afterwards, I had to say her that it hurt my arm so I could retract my arm. We still continued to snuggle. As It felt good for me, I thought that I would feel good for her If I did the same thing for her. So I copied her moves and did the same that she did on me on her. She fondled my hair and I fondled her hair. I stroke her arm. I hold her hand with my hand. I kissed her forehead and her cheeks. She also changed position by putting her belly on my belly. Then I put my belly on her belly. It felt really good. We also stroked each other's feet with our feet.

It was the most intimate hugs, cuddles, fondling that I had ever had. It was a completely different sensation than the loose simple hugs that my dad and mom gave me when I was sleeping in the same bed as them.

Feeling the breath and smelling the sweet scent of my elder female cousin felt so good.

I think that it was the day after, my mom asked my elder female cousin if I didn't bother her sleeping on the same bed as her. My elder female cousin answered my mom by saying that it doesn't bother her.

We slept together snuggling each other for the remaining days. I became addicted to snuggle to the point that I was waiting with impatience each day that my elder female cousin came back home during the evening to do that again. It was the thing that I was the most excited to do each day.

Each time, I woke up, I felt an amazing sensation in my body which is hard to describe. Before that, I thought that only sex feels very good and didn't know that snuggles could feel very good.

It was the first time that I was attracted to an Asian girl.

She nearly has no boobs like most female Asian girls and didn't have a sexy face but she had normal body with a cute face.

My female elder cousin acts like a child.

One of my white bisexual girl acquaintance said that my elder female cousin looked super delicious and is a 10/10 and thought that she was an actress. 10/10 looks too high for me as my elder female cousin doesn't have a breasts. My elder female cousin has a normal weight. I am 1m72 of height with a normal weight and elder female cousin is only a few cm shorter than me.

Up to my travel to Vietnam during the Summer of 2009, the only girls that I found attractive where thicc sexy blonde Western girls with big boobs like Pamela Anderson.

We never had sex due especially to the presence of my mom on the ground of her sleeping room so I never dared to but It was the first time that I wanted to have sex with a girl with no boobs. I wanted to become one with her.

On the last night, I kissed her lips without tongue when she was sleeping. It felt good to kiss her lips. The sensation was soft. I enjoyed it. She was doing noises like hummm which might means that she didn't want that I kiss her ? I am not sure. But she still cuddled me.

I kissed her lips because I was curious to know how it feels to kiss the lips of a girl and also because I like her.

I never had a girlfriend.

On the morning of my departure, I gave her a last long goodbye tight snuggle while she was laying in her bed and I said her with words that I have forgotten.

When I came back to Belgium, my mom told me that my elder female cousin will take care of me if I fails my studies.

7 years later, during the Summer of 2016, I went back to Vietnam and slept in her bed alone which is a terrible feeling. I really wanted to see my elder female cousin again.

My mom joked that I could smell the odor of my elder female cousin in on her bed.

I think that my mom knows that I like my elder female cousin.

I could only meet for a few hours my elder female cousin who was now a doctor and an owner of a coffee shop in Vietnam.

When I saw her, she immediately hugged my tightly in front of her husband and other members of my family.

I don't feel comfortable to cuddle, hold hands, put the head on the shoulder in front of other people.

Even as she was a doctor at this point, she still acted like a child with me.

As her husband was there, we didn't sleep in the same room.

Now she has two sons still with the same boyfriend who became her husband.

Since the Summer of 2009, I have not got ""a big sister hug"" which I miss.

I tried dating apps but it doesn't work for me as women reject most men.

I also discovered the Men Going Their Own Way (MGTOW) which helped me to understand that women reject most men due to the fact that women are hypergamic which is why dating apps don't work for me.

I don't have friends. I don't know what to say to people. I am very awkward.

So in 2018, I bought my first love doll as I missed cuddles but the cuddles don't feel as good as with my elder female cousin but it is better than having nothing.

I had sex with a love doll without condom but I have never experienced sex with a girl in flesh and meat without condom so I am still a virgin.

I have heard from my mom that my elder female cousin has stopped her job as a, ophthalmologist because it was too stressful and tiring. My elder female cousin opened an eyewear store. I also heard from my mom that my elder female cousin had financial problems and had to ask her parents to give her money. I don't want to depend of my elder female cousin especially if she has troubles to manage her own money.

My mom told me that my elder female cousin divorced with her husband after he cheated on her. My mom told me that she is talking to a banker.

A few months ago, my mom said that I could live in the house of my elder female cousin. I didn't give an answer to my mom. If that banker comes to live in the house of my elder female cousin with me, I am afraid that It might cause some problems as my elder female cousin is too close to me.

Recently, when I cuddle my love doll, the memories of my elder female cousin come back then I have tears streaming down my face. I don't know what to do.

West Baltimore deserves basic neighborhood amenities like coffee shops, bakeries, wine bars, small corner restaurants and not just one off “events,” but actual places you can visit any day of the week. Walkable, consistent, part of the community. This is MY ideal utopia in West Baltimore. 

Upton and Marble Hill are historically wealthy Black neighborhoods that literally helped build the culture of this city. (Completely understood where they stand today) The architecture, the rowhomes, the lineage  these blocks aren’t some blank slate or “forgotten area.” What’s missing is the economic layer that gives people a reason to leave their home on a Saturday morning and spend money locally. It’s insane that you can live here and still have to get in a car and drive to Bolton Hill or Mt. Vernon just to get a latte and sit down.

Even Reservoir Hill, since we’re being real, feels like it should have more. That neighborhood is revitalizing, has a whole demographic of residents who actually want to walk to something… and yet commercial options are still thin. It says a lot when people who live in strong, stable neighborhoods still can’t name three places within a 10-minute walk where you can get a good coffee, pick up a sandwich, or just log a couple hours on the laptop.

Normal start would be 2 ​regulars X 2, and then a ""roadie"" that I would use the XL brewed right into one of those Stanley soup can thermos' for later on. The trip really helped my XL Game. 30g a few clicks up from 1, inverted, ​​count to 30 stirring all the way, full chamber, 5 minute solid steep with a couple stirs and then plunge into heated thermos.

This past weekend we had a snowstorm not only a storm but I got sick thanksgiving day…and he wanted to go on a date on Friday but we me being sick I communicated that. I am the type of female where if I do not have a time, date and place then I am not looking forward to it. He wanted me to leave my house during a storm to go have drinks with him at a bar…I have boundaries and meeting up with people outside my friends for drinks is a big no! Anyways because of the poor efforts I basically told him I wasn’t interested. And then he kinda crashed out 😂 am I the only person that prefers to talk/text with someone before a date? It makes it less awkward because i actually know a few things about the person, those things can be conversation starters but aye 😂 I guess I’m complicated.

Walk into any stylish home today—whether it’s a minimalist apartment, a sleek Scandinavian-inspired space, or a bold contemporary loft—and you’ll notice one rising trend: **antiques are back**. But not in the way you might expect.

More homeowners are mixing **modern design with antique furniture**, creating spaces that feel layered, character-rich, and incredibly personal. In fact, interior designers say interest in vintage and antique décor has grown by more than **30% over the past five years**, largely driven by buyers who want “uniqueness” and “story” in their homes. At the same time, the resale and antique furniture market has crossed **billions in value globally**, showing that old-world craftsmanship is far from forgotten.

But here’s the challenge—**how do you use antique furniture without making your home look like a museum or your grandparents’ living room?**

You don’t need a Victorian-themed house or a rustic cottage to enjoy antique pieces. The magic lies in **balance, contrast, and intentional styling**.

Let’s dive into how you can elevate a modern home with antiques—*and make it look effortlessly chic.*

 

# Why Antique Furniture Works So Well in Modern Homes

Before we talk styling, here’s why antiques are having a renaissance:

**1. Antiques Bring Unmatched Craftsmanship**

Many antique pieces were built by hand using solid wood, dovetail joints, and techniques that mass-made furniture rarely offers today. They can last generations—making them both beautiful and sustainable.

**2. They Add Personality and Story**

A modern home can sometimes feel too sterile. Antiques instantly add warmth, texture, and history—turning a simple room into a conversation piece.

**3. It’s a Sustainable Choice**

Buying antique furniture can reduce your carbon footprint significantly. Many studies show that extending the life cycle of furniture by just five years can reduce waste and production emissions drastically.

**4. Mixing Eras Makes Your Home Feel Curated**

Homes that mix modern and antique pieces don’t look “decorated”—they look *collected*. And that’s the aesthetic most people are chasing today.

 

# How to Use Antique Furniture in a Modern Home (Without Looking Old-Fashioned)

Here are strategic, creative, and design-forward tips that truly make a difference.

 

# 1. Start with One Statement Antique Piece

If you're new to mixing styles, don’t overwhelm your room with too many old items. Instead, choose **one standout antique** to anchor the space.

Great first choices:

* A beautifully carved **wooden console table**
* An antique **writing desk**
* A brass-fitted **trunk or chest**
* A vintage **armchair** reupholstered in a modern fabric
* A mid-century **sideboard**

This single hero piece instantly adds depth without overwhelming the modern elements around it. You can find these from TrueGether, which is also the best [eBay alternative](https://www.truegether.com/eBayAlternative.html).

**Pro Tip:**

Place your statement antique against a clean backdrop—plain walls, neutral rugs, linear lighting—to highlight its shape and craftsmanship.

 

# 2. Mix Materials for Modern Contrast

One reason antiques can look outdated is when they sit next to similar heavy or ornate pieces. In a modern home, balance the weight of antique wood or metal with lighter materials.

Try pairing:

* A carved teak cabinet + **glass or marble coffee table**
* A vintage dresser + **sleek metal lamps**
* An old trunk + **linen or boucle sofa**
* An antique dining table + **clear acrylic chairs**

The contrast makes both the old and new elements pop beautifully.

 

# 3. Use Modern Upholstery for Freshness

Many antique chairs or sofas have stunning frames but dated fabrics. Reupholstering them in a minimal, modern material can bring them back to life instantly.

Trending modern fabrics that pair beautifully with antiques:

* Cream or beige linen
* Neutral boucle
* Soft leather
* Muted velvet
* Organic cotton blends
* Minimal prints like stripes

This gives you the structure of history + the freshness of contemporary design.

 

# 4. Use Antiques in Unexpected Places

Instead of sticking them in formal areas, try placing antiques in modern, high-contrast locations.

Examples:

* A [vintage desk](https://www.truegether.com/category/antiques) in a minimalist home office
* An antique cabinet in a sleek kitchen (great for crockery!)
* A carved mirror in a modern entryway
* A retro bench at the end of a hotel-style bed
* A vintage sideboard under a massive contemporary artwork

The surprise factor makes the design feel intentional and editorial.

 

# 5. Keep the Color Palette Clean

Antique furniture often has warm tones—walnut, mahogany, oak, rosewood. These work beautifully against modern, calm backgrounds.

A few color palette ideas:

**Neutral + Warm Woods**

* Whites
* Off-whites
* Sand
* Beige
* Warm greys

**Bold + Minimal Interplay**

Pair an intricate antique with a deep, modern wall color:

* Navy
* Charcoal
* Emerald green
* Terracotta

This makes antique details pop without clutter.

 

# 6. Balance the Visual Weight

If you place a heavy antique in the room (like a dark wood wardrobe), balance it with:

* lighter curtains
* minimal décor
* slim metal floor lamps
* modern artwork
* airy rugs

This prevents the room from feeling dated or overly dense.

 

# 7. Blend Antique and Modern Art Together

Art is one of the easiest ways to tie eras together.

How to do it:

* Place a modern abstract painting above an antique console
* Frame vintage prints in sleek, contemporary frames
* Hang old-world art in a gallery wall with modern typography posters

It creates a dialogue between time periods, making your home feel curated rather than chaotic.

 

# 8. Choose Antiques with Clean Lines

Not all antiques are overly ornate. Some antique styles naturally fit well into modern spaces:

* Mid-century modern pieces
* Scandinavian teak furniture
* Colonial wooden furniture
* Vintage campaign-style pieces
* Industrial metal antiques
* Simple farmhouse tables

These blend seamlessly into contemporary homes.

 

# 9. Don’t Overcrowd the Space

One common mistake is cluttering the room with too many “old” pieces. Even great antiques can look dated if packed tightly.

Follow the 80/20 rule:

* **80% modern**
* **20% antique**

This ratio keeps your home fresh, clean, and modern—with just enough character.

 

# 10. Use Lighting to Modernize Antique Pieces

Lighting is your best friend.

Ways to modernize instantly:

* Add a contemporary lamp on an antique side table
* Install warm LED strip lighting inside an antique cabinet
* Place spotlights above antique shelves or artwork
* Use geometric or metal pendant lights nearby

Lighting elevates everything—and makes antiques feel relevant instead of old-fashioned.

 

**Modern Rooms That Look Incredible with Antique Furniture**

Here are room-by-room examples that show how powerful this combo can be.

 

**Modern Living Room + Antique Coffee Table**

A neutral living room with a glass vase, cream sofa, and one intricate wood or brass antique center table looks chic and balanced.

 

**Modern Bedroom + Antique Dresser**

Pair a clean, upholstered bed with an antique chest of drawers. Add a round modern mirror above it—chef’s kiss.

 

**Minimal Kitchen + Antique Storage Cabinet**

A sleek modular kitchen with one old teak or rosewood cabinet for storing plates adds instant warmth and personality.

 

**Contemporary Entryway + Carved Wooden Bench**

Minimal wall, large mirror, trendy shoes… and one handcrafted antique bench. A perfect welcome.

 

**Home Office + Antique Desk**

Working on your laptop at a 100-year-old writing table feels special—and stylish.

 

**Signs You've Styled Antiques the Right Way**

Your home looks:

* Modern, but not cold
* Warm, but not dated
* Unique, not generic
* Stylish, not chaotic
* Collected, not cluttered

That’s the perfect balance.

 

# Bonus: What NOT to Do When Decorating with Antiques

Avoid these common mistakes:

❌ Don’t put too many heavy woods in one room  
❌ Don’t mix too many ornate styles  
❌ Don’t leave antiques in poor condition  
❌ Don’t ignore the scale of your modern space  
❌ Don’t match everything—contrast is your friend

 

# Final Thoughts: Modern Homes + Antique Furniture = Perfection

Antique furniture isn’t old-fashioned—it’s timeless.  
When used thoughtfully, it elevates modern spaces with:

✨ warmth  
✨ craftsmanship  
✨ character  
✨ sustainability  
✨ and personal storytelling

You don’t need a vintage-themed house to love antiques.  
With the right balance, your modern home can look more stylish, unique, and meaningful—one beautiful piece at a time.

1pbyayw,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepcast/comments/1pbyayw/cobwebs/,Cobwebs,"I wish I could remember the beginning.

If something had happened, if there was a moment where I could have looked around and said, “this is wrong,” maybe things could have been different. But it didn’t happen. It always was, and so it was normal. 

In kindergarten, when we’d draw pictures of our family and mine contained a dark, spindly creature clinging to the ceiling, my teachers would just smile and move on. They never asked, and never heard when I told them. My peers noticed, though, and asked. And I would tell them, and they’d tell me about their dad’s rocket ship, or their pet T-rex. I tried to explain that mine was real, and they’d insist that so was theirs. I showed them the marks, and they showed me skinned knees and mosquito bites. I learned not to mention it at all, to anyone. Eventually, when asked to do so, I would draw someone else’s family to save myself the headache.

As I got older, pushing through the frenzied forest of adolescence into high school, my peers slowly stopped responding when I brought it up. Their eyes would glaze over, and they’d say something noncommittal, and then it was like I’d not said anything. Puberty seemed to dull their senses to my pleas, like the adults. I yearned for my senses to soften like theirs, and when they didn’t, I had to make them. And so I began to drink. 

My shoddy academic performance was further hamstrung by a near constant state of inebriation. When I crawled out of high school, diploma barely secured, the only college that would have me was the local one. I spread my wings and flew two blocks over to Charlotte State University, where my vices were accepted with open arms. No longer was I the shuffling, mute outcast. I was the life, the spark of the party. I drank, and they cheered me for it. The brief, electrifying attention always gave way as the night wore on, when people had no further need of a jester. But it was more than I’d ever known, so I remained. 

The night we met, I was slumped in the corner of some loud, chaotic household that reeked of weed and body odor. I had long since made myself known, and the festivities had long since outlived my usefulness. My head kept drooping, and when it did I would take another tiny sip from my bottle, like a stranded man on his final water ration. I didn’t notice her sitting beside me until she nudged my bottle arm. 

“Are you alright?” 

I turned through molasses towards her, certain she’d mistaken me for someone else, but her eyes were on mine. Green, glittering emeralds set in a round sunbeam of a face, entirely comprehensible despite the low strobing lights. My dry mouth worked as my mind’s cold engine stuttered, desperate to turn over. 

“Are you alright?” she asked again, and my mind finally chugged to life.

“Yeah,” I said, blinking hard. 

“Good,” she said, her smile flashing in the gloom like a bolt of radiant lightning. “Thought I lost you, there.”

I squinted at her, certain we’d never met, but bending my brain to remember her. I’d have liked to. The girl leaned back against the wall, watching a man with beer cans attached to his head trying to mount a table. 

“Can I sit here? With you?” she asked. “This is all… it’s just a lot, you know?”

She turned to me, and I realized I’d not answered her question. I nodded dumbly, and she laughed, for some reason. My heart did a strange, hot palpitation at the sound, and I realized that I needed to keep making her laugh, by any means necessary. I nodded to the beer-headed guy, woozily gesticulating with my free hand. 

“He’s my ride,” I managed. It didn’t make much sense, but she laughed again, and again my heart seized pleasingly. We stayed there, bunched against the wall for hours until one of the fraternity brothers hoisted me aloft and spilled me onto the street like a bag of garbage. My bottle, untouched for the past hours, miraculously survived the impact. I struggled to a seat on the sidewalk, eyeing the bottle’s remaining drink like the stranded man eyes salt water; knowing it’ll turn his guts and mind to poison, but hoping beyond hope it may slake his thirst. 

“Hey!” came her voice, which I’d already learned to love. My eyes jerked to the opulent staircase around which other ousted males lingered, desperate to be granted further access to the Greek utopia. She was descending around and between young, indignant men, lightning smile visible despite the distance, and my state. “Hey,” she said again as she sidled up beside me, looking around like a stage actor. “Where’s your ride?”

It was my turn to laugh, a rusty cough that came out of my nose, ugly where hers was divine. She had not been drinking, and offered me a ride home, if I could remember where it was. I accepted, increasingly certain that I’d finally broken from reality, that I was now adrift in an idealized mental construction. 

When I awoke the next morning, the pain in my head was expected, but the sticky note was not. I pulled it off my forehead, squinting through the hangover. The phone number meant nothing, but the name brought it all back in a rush, endorphins powerful enough to banish the headache, if for just a moment. Emily. The sides of my mouth twitched, and then I was smiling. My chest was alight once more, as she always does to me. I still have the note, and if I have it my way, I’ll be buried with it. 

I called her later that day, and a coffee date turned into another, then a happy hour. It happened naturally, without active thought. The next step was just that, and soon a year passed in an eyeblink. I found myself drinking less, not because she asked me to but because, for the first time in my life, I felt I had reason to experience it. 

I knew the question would arise, eventually, and it frightened me. Emily talked about her parents back east, her father the handyman and her mother the businesswoman. Her older brother, graduated going on three years now, and the family dog. We could never have dogs, but I always wanted one. I expressed my eagerness to meet them, hoping their idyllic existence might occlude my family’s own - that Emily would think I emerged fully formed from that frathouse floor, unburdened. 

This was not to be. The question came after dinner, one night as I was scrubbing grease from a pan. 

“Ben,” she said. Her tone was cautious, almost timid, like I was standing on the edge of a bridge. My heart clenched in a less pleasant way than usual, as if it knew what was coming. She sidled up next to me, peering at me with her emerald swimming pools, and I halted in my task.

“Yeah?”

Her eyes flicked around as if tracking a fly, then the bottled up question burst from her like shaken up soda. 

“I.. I just… when can I meet your family?”

My mouth went dry, like it had on the night we met. I looked into the sudsy sink, wetting my lips, trying to remember the prerendered replies I’d cooked up. They’re racists. They’re scientologists. They’re dead. In that moment, all excuses dissolved like rice paper in the rain. I couldn’t lie to her, nor could I tell the truth. As sure as I was that she loved me, and I her, I was equally sure that the truth would end us. 

I stood frozen at the sink, as if my body’s movement affected that of time. My mind was racing, smashed between two impossible choices, until I felt her hand on my back. My face was numb, and I gulped a deep breath. She leaned her head on my shoulder. 

“I’m sorry,” she said softly. “You never talk about them. I know it’s probably… I don’t care if they’re weird, or whatever. They’re your family. They made you.” She squeezed my shoulder. “I have to thank your mom, at least.” 

I thought of my mother, and my guts did an all too familiar inversion. The certainty that Emily would leave washed over me anew, and my hands began to tingle. I wanted to cry, but tears never come when they’re supposed to. I gripped the sides of the sink, commanding my fingers to feel the cold, slick metal. 

“Hey,” Emily’s voice cut through my malaise like a lighthouse beam. I felt her arms encircle my waist, and the sickening tide ebbed at her touch. “Only if you want. No pressure, no pressure. I love you either way.” 

That was true. I knew it to be so, and that certainty was real, unlike the erroneous surety from moments before. I knew Emily to be a great many things, none of them a liar. 

So I agreed. 

I called home the next day, the number unfamiliar and rusty to my fingertips. Dad sounded elated over the phone, because he was. I’d not called in months, and now I was coming by for dinner. Right now. They had a new guest, he said. A six year old boy named Milo. Fresh to the foster system. My brain shuddered to a halt, and I mumbled something along the lines of “good for you.” I hung up as quickly as possible, my stomach impossibly winding into another knot. 

“Ready?” called Emily, and I turned to see her in the door. “I want to get them a bottle of wine, or something.”

My heart was in my throat, blocking bile. My eyes must have said enough, because she swept over to me in an instant. “What’s going on?” she asked. “Is this still okay?” 

God, should I have just told her? No one ever understood me past the age of seven. What if she did understand, then we got there and she didn’t see? I’d look like a lunatic, and then she’d definitely leave. Maybe we’d go, and we’d only see Dad and Milo, and maybe Emily wouldn’t even notice. And we’d never have to see them again. 

“New… kid. They’ve got one,” I finally said. She could tell I wasn’t saying everything, but she nodded. 

“Good for them.”

The drive was quiet, bereft of our usual chatter and jibes. My knuckles were as white as my lips, and Emily sat gazing out the window, contemplating the possible derangements of my family. Whatever she imagined, she was wrong. As I turned onto Hoskins Drive, the mailboxes and driveways became familiar. The turns grew second nature, and suddenly I was moving the gear shift into park, stepping out and beholding my family home. I turned to Emily, and in a panic realized that she, too, was nervous. Of course she was. My own nerves receded as I moved to her, squeezing her hand and offering a half-smile. 

“They’ll love you,” I said, and she grinned.

“I know.”

We hiked up the concrete walkway, bowed with age. I thought I saw a curtain shift in a second-story window, but I forced it from my mind. Reaching the front door, I knocked three times and stepped back. Emily released my hand, which I realized was clammy and probably unpleasant to hold. Sounds behind the door, creaking and shuffling, then it swung open and there was Dad, clutching a featherduster wrapped in freshly swept cobwebs. 

“Hello there!” he beamed, shooing us inside. He wrapped me in a crushing hug, bald head chafing on my stubble. “Oh, Benny, it’s so good to see you. And you must be Emily?” he said, releasing me and clasping his hands before himself. Her surprised eyes flicked to me, then back to Dad as she met his smile with her own. 

“Yes, I am,” she said, and Dad clasped her hand in both of his, shaking it warmly. 

“It is a pleasure to meet you, Miss Emily. Please, please. You’re just in time.” Em shot me a happily incredulous look as we followed him through the nearly spotless hallway. The house smelled of crackling spices, and my knotted stomach rumbled at the aromas wafting from the kitchen. To my surprise, a small boy with dark curly hair was pushing cutlets of chicken around a pan, greeting us with a toothy grin as we entered the kitchen. I stopped for an instant, eyes magnetized to the child. He seemed… normal. How long had he been here?

“Milo,” said Dad as he decanted Emily’s present. “This is my son, Benjamin, and his lovely girlfriend Emily!” Milo waved, then went back to the chicken, dutiful in his task. 

“Good to meet you, Milo,” Em said, sidling up beside the boy. “Whatcha making?”

“Chicken,” Milo replied. Dad handed Em a glass of wine, then brought me one as the pair continued their discussion. He’d not stopped smiling since he’d opened the door, and he looked to me now with warm, saccharine aghastment. 

“She’s great!” he said softly. “What took you so long?”

I looked to him, and wondered how far gone he was. 

“You know what,” I said in an equal tone, glancing to Milo. “Still?”

Dad’s smile didn’t falter, but his eyes leapt away from mine. He shrugged, taking a sip from his glass.

“Lots of abandoned children, unfortunately.”

“Dad,” I said, voice hushed and quick now. “This… God, you can stop this, you know.” I looked around hurriedly. “Send Milo away, and burn down the fucking house. Burn it right down and start over. This can’t…” I lowered my tone to a hiss. “This can’t keep going on.” 

“Chicken’s done,” he said, draining his glass. I watched him gather up Emily and Milo, ushering them to the dinner table and plating their meals for them. It always amazed me how well he could pretend all was well. He believed it a strength, a Churchillian stoicism dividing order and chaos. It would have been admirable, were it not so vile. 

Dinner was delicious, and Emily made no small show of her enjoyment. She got along famously with Milo and Dad, and the three of them carried the conversation long into the evening. Mom was mentioned, and Dad apologized for her absence, claiming she was working late, or out of town, or something. I only caught a glimpse of her as I was gathering up the plates. The door through which we entered was well lit, but the one on the far side was dark, as if it opened into starless night. As I was leaning over the table, reaching for Milo’s dishes, I saw a blacker spot in the threshold. I looked up as it flitted away, only revealing the shadowed outline of a couch and switched-off lamp. I did the dishes without once looking down, eyes roving my periphery. I didn’t see her again. 

“Look, stay the night,” I heard Dad say. “The guest room is untouched. Right around the corner. I’ll make you breakfast.” I whirled around. Em had a rosy glow to her cheeks, and she looked at me with dizzy contentment. I couldn’t help but smile, and unfortunately, both of them took it as acquiescence. 

“We’d love to,” Emily said, and I felt myself straining, wriggling helplessly against the ever-tangling web. Further struggle only hastened the worst, I’d learned, but it was hard to fight the instinct. 

Dad shooed us away from further cleanup, and I ushered Emily down the hallway towards the guest room. It was a time capsule of the bright side of my childhood, adorned with old school and baseball photographs, and various other mementos. Emily fawned over my childhood paraphernalia, cooed at a baby picture on the old desk, then promptly fell asleep facedown on the bed without taking off her shoes. I slipped them off, tucking her in as best I could manage. The room even smelled the same, which brought a confusing mix of comfort and unease. I brushed some hair from Em’s face, then stood, perusing the old bookshelf. The Two Towers sat alone, its companions lost to the annals of time. My bookmark was still in place. Chapter Nine. I wondered if I’d ever have the courage to finish. 

There was a creak beyond the door, and I nearly leapt out of my skin. Dad and Milo’s voices drifted from the kitchen, down the hallway. I stared at the bottom of the door as my skin began to crawl. There was another, softer creak, and I remembered that I wasn’t alone, that it wasn’t just about me anymore. I made it to the bed in two strides and stumbled backward onto it, one hand on my snoring partner, as the door eased slowly open. 

My back went cold. All the air left the room as I stared at the figure looming in the hallway, peering at me, motionless, mouth twitching. 

“Mom,” I said hoarsely.

At my voice, she crept soundlessly into the room, dinner plate eyes like six inky voids. She occluded the doorway, and the room seemed to bow toward her in deference as her swollen abdomen followed the rest of her. Her eight huge, thinly haired legs padded lightly across the carpet, belying her size and strength. As ever, I picked her two largest eyes to focus on. The four beneath were as unblinking as the rest. Her furry mandibles worked, rubbing together like a fly’s legs, making a soft shh, shh sound. I could barely see her fangs glinting in the lamplight. 

“That’s enough,” I tried to say, but my throat was too dry, and the words came out a rattling rasp. Mom had slowed to a crawl, but she did not stop, two fathoms away now. “Stop!” I yelled, and she froze. Emily made a soft, sleepy grunt. My body wracked with spasms as if I’d been thrown in a snowbank, but I kept a hand on Emily and my eyes on Mom’s many. I felt my constellation of pinprick scars burn at her presence, as if the venom still flowed into me. I remembered the sticky feeling of her webs, how they seemed stronger than steel, how I could barely breathe while wrapped in her cocoon. The venom slowed time, making moments seem like hours, letting you analyze every heartbeat in agonizing detail. Letting you comprehend the sour stuff working through your every vein, winding through your heart and back out. She’d feed from different spots. So as not to cause undue damage, maybe, or because I tasted better that way.

I pushed to my feet, fear lighting a black fire beneath me. I was breathing hard and fast, full and hot. I felt removed from my body as I raised a finger toward Mom’s eyes, my voice like a different person’s, someone strong and sure.

“If you touch her, or the boy,” I said, leaning as close as I dared. “I will fucking kill you.”

Her mandibles shifted, and I could see the finger length spines clearly now, light glinting off that unmistakable sheen. I could smell the venom, cloying with a hint of musk. I was immobilized, still as if Mom had stuck me right then and there. If she’d pushed me aside and begun to spin up Emily, I could have done nothing but watch. Instead, one of Mom’s front legs moved slowly, deliberately towards me. I waited, knowing it wasn’t a strike but tensed all the same. Softly, the tickling tip of her leg touched my cheek, caressing down to my jaw. I would have flinched, if I could. It was all I could do to squeeze my eyes shut. 

When I opened my eyes, she was gone, nary a creak betraying her departure. The room still stank of venom, maybe even more now, and my stomach turned. I sprinted from the bedroom and down the hall, collapsing over the toilet with a mostly dry retch. Still tasted better than the fangs. When I was done, I heaved to my feet and walked back to the guest room, anxious to get back to Em. I’d decided that I’d stay up through the night, and Em could drive us back in the morning. I’d tell her I had insomnia, that it was a fine visit, and that we didn’t need to do it again. I found her in the same unconscious sprawl, and a cursory check revealed no bite marks. I breathed a sigh of relief, crawled in bed next to her, and kept my eyes locked on the doorway. 

I awoke a few hours later. The red lights on my old alarm clock showed 3:29 AM. In that moment, I was five years old again. Every shadow was a dangling leg, a crouching abdomen. The pressure on my bladder was enormous, but I fought nature’s call for as long as I could stand, unwilling to venture into the black and leave Emily alone. Eventually, it became clear that I was going to go one way or the other, so I sprang from my bed and into the bathroom once more. Afterwards I stumbled back to my room, crawled into bed and threw my arm across an empty mattress. 

My breath caught in my throat. All remnants of sleep evaporated as I frantically groped the bed, desperate that maybe she’d just rolled over. I turned on the lamp to see an empty room.

“Oh shit,” I said under my breath. “Oh, shit, shit, shit.” I fumbled in my jacket and grabbed my lighter. I tore through the darkened house, checking the living room, kitchen and foyer, every empty room dropping my stomach a level deeper. I came to a halt in the house’s entryway, breathing heavily, when I realized that there was only one place she could be. I looked to the darkened staircase, and the tattered, freshly stepped-on webs.

“Benny?” came Dad’s voice from the hall. “Ben, is that you?”

I flicked on the lighter and, steeling myself, ascended the staircase. The wood beneath the carpet groaned, unused to the touch of human feet. Photos lined the walls, cast in the stuttering ghoulish glow of my lighter, frames rimmed in webbing like crypt-borne relics. Eight year old me, smiling dead-eyed in my pinstripe catcher’s uniform. A class group photograph, thicker webs occluding all but my face. I wasn’t smiling in that one. Towards the top of the staircase, there was a sepia-tinged picture of Dad, proudly brandishing his foster license. He still had hair, dark and wavy in the wind, and he wore his trademark face-splitting grin. Even in the dark, I could see his eyes were different. They smiled with the rest of him. 

As I reached the top of the staircase, I let out a moan of relief. Emily was shambling down the webbed hallway, head and shoulders slumped. Through the panic, I’d entirely forgotten that she sleepwalked. The fear left me all at once, which was stupid, but in my addled state the threat had fled. She was here, she was alright. I put my arms around her shoulders and guided her back towards the staircase.

“Yellow pig tails,” she muttered. I maneuvered her around a thick knot of cobwebs, keeping my lit lighter safely away from her shoulder. The webs were everywhere, like a contiguous wallpaper and carpet. It was never this bad when I lived here. She’d expanded her domain, and I wondered how long until she corrupted the rest of the house. 

As we approached the top of the stairway, something caught my attention. The house was quiet, our footfalls silenced by the ubiquitous spiderwebs. The weeping was soft, but clear and unmistakable. I remembered that sound, remembered making it myself. My heart began its thundering dance once more, and I turned, still holding Emily. The door at the far end was less webbed than the others, a vacant swath before it where it had swung back and forth. Even from here, I could just make out the hand painted letters on the door, faded but legible.

BEN’S. KEEP OUT.

“Benny?” 

My head snapped down the stairway. It was Dad, rubbing his eyes and peering up at us. “Ben, what’s wrong? What are you doing?”

“Come here,” I said, forcing full breaths. Dad didn’t move. “Come here, now,” I snapped, and Emily mumbled something incoherent. Dad looked down, then took a tentative step.

“Faster,” I said, looking back toward my old room. When I reached him, I gingerly guided Emily into his waiting hands.

“What-” Dad began.

“She’s sleepwalking,” I said, looking at her glazed eyes and brushing her hair from her face. “Get her back to bed. Don’t talk to her.”

“Benny, you can’t be up here,” said Dad. 

“Get her to bed,” I said over my shoulder. My feet kicked up clots of cobwebs as I strode by doors and end tables draped in silky thread, like corpses in bride veils. Knowing where Mom was brought simultaneous comfort and dread. My palm was slick around the lighter as I reached my bedroom, staring for a moment at my name. Writing it was one of my first memories. Dad holding me aloft so I could reach. Had it started then? Before, or after? I didn’t have many memories from my childhood, and even fewer good ones. When Dad picked me up, showing me how to move the brush to make the letters, I hadn’t felt small. 

Now, staring at the chipping paint, I wondered if I’d ever feel that way again. 

The door swung open with little effort, and I brandished my lighter like a blazing sword. The room seemed to drink in the light, and I couldn’t even see the walls. The weeping stopped as soon as I’d entered, and I swung my lighter around fervently. 

“Milo? Hey, Milo? It’s Ben. I’m here.”

There was a long, deep silence. 

“Benjamin?” 

Milo’s voice came from the corner, weak and reedy. I walked toward it, then tripped on something, almost sprawling to the ground. I lowered my lighter, and nearly dropped it. An oblong mass of webs was plastered to the old wooden floor, like a cotton candy death shroud. I groaned, fresh chills running down my back, and stepped carefully around it. “Benjamin?” came Milo’s voice again. He was propped in the corner, and my throat caught. His head was visible from the top of the cobweb cocoon. His skin was pale, his eyes fluttering, but he was alive. I dropped to my knees beside him, lighter slipping from my fingers as I tore at the webs strung tight around his body. They came away like tissue paper, and I wondered if they’d always been so easy to remove. 

“What’s happening?” Milo asked as I freed him from the remaining webs, scooping him into my arms. I hoisted him up, barely noticing the fire beginning to spread across the floor, dry webs catching in moments. 

“Nothing,” I said softly, turning to the door. “It’ll be-”

My feet froze with my words. Mom was crouched above the threshold, eyes glittering with the creeping flames. Her legs were bunched. Her mouth was motionless. I knew that stance, and she knew that I knew. My legs wouldn’t move, but my fear seemed to stop at my waist. 

“What did I say?” I growled. Mom didn’t move a hair. I clutched Milo tighter, and he buried his face deeper my chest. “I said I’d kill you.”

The flames were licking closer, closer now, but I didn’t feel the heat. I remembered the only time I’d ever fought her off, wielding a lighter I’d stolen from a gas station. Violent pride swelled in my chest. Dad had taken it away, chastizing my sin, but it was the only time I’d made her run. I stared my sharpest daggers at the spider that was my mother, rage of three different sorts compounding within me. I hated that I’d brought Emily here, exposing her to a monster. I hated that Dad was still letting this happen, after all these years.

And, most selfishly of all, I hated that it had taken me this long to say anything other than nothing.

The crackling cobwebs wafted dusty smoke into my nostrils. If it had been only me and Mom, I might have stood there for the rest of my life, staring her down as the flames took us both. But Milo urged my feet forward, closer to the door. I swallowed hard, each step like dragging my feet through liquid lead. I was five steps from the door, then three, then Mom towered above the two of us like a terrible stormcloud, apt to burst at a moment’s notice. As I passed beneath her, I finally dropped my gaze, looking now down the hallway and toward our salvation. I felt no stinging bite, only the cobwebs and Milo’s weight. 

I made it two paces down the hall when I noticed the specks. 

Despite the inferno engulfing my room, the hallway was still inky dark, and so I didn’t recognize them until they were running along the walls. Tiny, black motes expertly skittering along her silky highway. Then I felt one, two, ten pass over my bare feet, and I let out an involuntary cry of alarm. The spiderlings swarmed from my burning room like a spindly tidal wave, rolling over and around my feet and vanishing at the end of the hallway, squeezing through floorboard cracks or chips in the drywall. I felt them squish underfoot as I ran with them, squeezing Milo close and thundering down the staircase. When we reached the bottom, I placed him down and took him by the shoulders.

“Are you alright?” I asked. He didn’t answer. His eyes seemed to stare through me. 

“Ben?” came Emily’s voice. With one hand still on Milo, I turned to see her rubbing her eyes, walking unsteadily towards me. “What’s going on?”

“Pack your stuff,” I said, pulling Milo behind me. “We’re going.”

“What? Why?”

I hadn’t brought more than the clothes on my back. Emily just had her purse and a spare change. I bundled her stuff under one arm, then made for the front door with Milo still in tow. 

“Hey,” Emily said, her tone sharp and harsh, all semblance of sleep gone. “What’s going on?” 

“There’s a fire,” I said, pushing the front door open, the night beyond an open, welcoming invitation. “Come on.”

Emily perked up at this, striding past me and Milo. “Oh my god,” she said. “Where’s your dad? Is your mom home?”

I glanced one last time into the house where I grew up. My eyes were drawn to my father’s, glittering at me from the dark staircase. I couldn’t see the rest of his face, just his eyes, but they betrayed neither sadness nor rage. I don’t know what they said. And I don’t care to. 

We piled into the car, and I was turning down the road before Emily had time to ask what I was doing, why we were leaving, what had happened to my parents. Her voice grew in fervor, panic in her tone, but I felt awash in a comforting haze. She was safe. Milo was safe. Mother’s children, her true children, had abandoned her. And any minute now, I thought as I looked in the rearview mirror, that vile spider’s den would go up in flame, scouring away everything that had come before. 

Any minute, now.

Hey everyone,
I shifted to Jersey City recently for work. I am an Indian IT guy and honestly didn’t expect it to feel this dull and lonely. I thought a big city would mean easy socializing, weekend plans, something happening all the time. Instead it’s mostly me, my apartment, and silence.

If anyone here has been through this phase, how did you deal with it?
Would also love to meet people for coffee, gym, weekend walks, exploring food spots, or just hanging out. Not looking for anything complicated, just trying to build a small circle so life doesn’t feel like work to home and repeat.

1pby6aq,https://i.redd.it/k9c5ibogpp4g1.jpeg,"2 Years, 136lbs Down","Two years ago, I hit my peak weight at 288lbs . My physical and mental health were honestly a mess. Just walking up a few flights of stairs would leave me gasping for air, I was constantly lethargic, and my passion for life was slowly fading away.

Seeing all the amazing transformations and positive vibes on these subreddits truly reignited my own resolve to make a change.

I went from training maybe once or twice a week to hitting the gym six or seven times a week. I swapped my daily social engagements and heavy meals for dedicated fat-loss meals and coffee. And I stuck with it, without fail.

In two years, I dropped an incredible 136lbs! Every single transformation was witnessed by:

• The endless internal battles before every workout.

• The literal kilograms of sweat shed during training sessions.

• The deep, relentless soreness that was the aftermath of muscle recovery.

Now that I've successfully lost the weight, I'm genuinely focused on being healthy. I actively learn about how my lifestyle impacts my mind and body. I'm no longer camera-shy; I can flash a big, genuine smile for the lens. I've become comfortable with socializing, expressing myself more confidently, and saying 'no' to things I don't want to do. I'm trying all sorts of sports and activities that I was too scared or timid to try before.

I was staying in a port town in Kochi. There, I saw a guy named Dev, 24 years old, just 5 km away.
He was short, fair, chocolate-boy type. I swiped right. We matched instantly.

We started chatting—basic things at first, and the conversation felt smooth.
He said he was sitting in a café just 2 km from where I stayed, and asked if I could join him for a coffee.
He had a car.
I hesitated… but then thought “It’s just coffee, and he seems fine.”
He specifically asked to choose a place where people were around, so I felt safe and agreed.

Dev came to pick me up, and we went to the café.
The conversation was going great. At some point, I mentioned my obsession with horror and psychological stories.

Suddenly, he said,

> “I know a place nearby… extremely haunted. I’ve been there with my friends once.”



He looked so normal and trustworthy, so I said yes.
The time was around 7 PM when he started driving.

We drove through the town, then slowly left the city lights behind.
The road became narrower—no street lights, no houses.
Just trees on both sides, bending like dark fingers over the car.
I noticed silent couples parked along the way… staring blankly.

Soon the road turned into a single-lane path where two vehicles couldn’t pass.
If one came from the opposite direction, we would have to reverse nearly 1 km back.

Gradually, houses disappeared completely.
By the time we reached the top of the hill, it was 8 PM, but it felt like midnight.

Ahead of us, about 50 meters away, was an old iron gate, wide open.
Behind it stood a massive, broken mansion.
The walls were covered with hundreds of crosses—small, large, carved, painted… everywhere.
I had never seen anything like it. Something felt wrong.

Dev whispered,

> “People live here… but neighbours say they never see them outside. There’s a man who walks around here at night. Looks strange.”



My chest tightened. My hands turned cold.
I said,

> “Dev, please… let’s leave. I’m getting a very bad feeling.”



He nodded,

> “Okay, okay. If you’re uncomfortable, we’ll go.”



Just as he was about to turn the car, I saw him.

A man.
Standing at the gate.
Over 6 feet tall, with a long tangled beard, pale skin, and glowing red eyes.
His stare sliced through the darkness.
His smile—unnatural, stretched, monstrous.

He began walking toward us, slowly… step by step.
Not running.
Just walking.
But it felt like death itself was moving closer.

I started crying, shaking, unable to breathe.
Dev saw him too. His face went pale.
He quickly pulled the steering and did a U-turn.
The tires screeched, and the car flew forward.

I looked back.

The man was still walking.
Not fast.
Not human.
Just walking…
but he was getting closer.

His red eyes and demonic smile are still haunting me.
Even now, when I close my eyes, I see him standing there… watching.

1pby43w,https://www.reddit.com/r/MauiVisitors/comments/1pby43w/honeymoon_itinerary_6_days/,Honeymoon Itinerary (6 days),"This group helped me plan our honeymoon so I wanted to share how it went! This will be pretty long and detailed so feel free to skim or skip!

TLDR: stayed in Kīhei 11/19-11/26, did a professional photography session, Road to Hana, sunset dinner cruise, O’o farm tour, and lots of snorkeling, lounging, and good food! 

11/19- we arrived at 11pm and picked up our rental car and drove to Sugar Beach Resort in Kīhei where we rented a 1b/1br condo. We stayed here once before in 2022 and my husband’s grandparents have stayed here annually for a few decades. While it isn’t as fancy as many of the resorts, we absolutely loved it and felt it had everything we needed for a wonderful trip- beachfront, pool, hot tub, grills, onsite dining, and our condo had all the amenities we needed! 

11/20- we walked down the beach to get coffee and malasadas from Sugar Beach Bakery and checkout the farmers market, then stopped for groceries at Safeway (download the app and clip coupons in advance), and picked up our snorkel equipment from The Snorkel Store (learned about here and HIGHLY recommend, the employees are super kind and knowledgeable!). We stopped at South Maui Gardens and got permanent bracelets from Forever Linked Maui which was super cool! My husband surprised me by getting one, too, which made it more special 😊 we grabbed lunch from the food trucks and then headed to the condo to swim. Then we got ready and went to Wailea for a sunset photo session! Will wait until we get our photos to review, but it was fun! We then went to Geste Shrimp food truck in Kahului for dinner which I also learned about here and it was delicious! We ended the night soaking in the hot tub 😌

11/21- Road to Hana
We left Kīhei around 7:30am and visited Twin Falls, Aunt Sandy’s Banana Bread, Koki Beach, Uncle Russell’s Huli Huli Chicken stand, Hamoa Beach, Waiʻānapanapa State Park (reservation at 12:30), Pua’a Ka’a State Wayside (our favorite stop- swimming in the waterfall was magical!), Coconut Glenn’s ice cream, and Kahului food trucks for dinner! We had Thai Mee Up and Plantation Plate this time 😋

11/22- we spent the morning snorkeling at Black Rock Cove in Kaanapali and it was amazingggg! We saw so many sea turtles!! FYI there were a lot of little jellies so we did get some stings but they just felt like bug bites and totally worth it getting to watch the turtles snack on them! Around lunchtime we went back to the condo to get ready for our dinner cruise. We booked a sunset dinner cruise with Trilogy and it was gorgeous! The food was good, I had the miso butterfish which was delicious and my husband had the short rib which was also good but we both agreed mine was better. 

11/23- we spent another morning snorkeling first at Makena Landing Park where we saw more turtles and an eel! Then we continued snorkeling at Ulua beach which was also lovely and the beach was nice for just hanging out! We went to Morimoto for lunch- we went here in 2022 and were totally blown away. However, this time we found it pretty underwhelming. The sticky rib appetizer was delicious, but the sushi was on par with what we get in the Midwest. Also the hedges around the pool have grown a lot and you can no longer see the ocean clearly from the patio. This was probably our only meal we felt underwhelmed by. We stopped at Ululani’s for some shave ice which met all our expectations! We then returned to the condo to swim and relax and grilled steaks for dinner. 

11/24- We went to O’o Farms for the lunch tour which I also learned about here and it was wonderful! We learned a lot about their farming practices, tried lots of edibles plants, and then enjoyed a beautiful four course meal of salad and rosemary focaccia (incredible), mahi mahi, roasted chicken, and truffles and fruit for dessert! We also loved the coffee and bought some to take home. We stopped at Ocean Vodka for a drink and to enjoy the views and then returned to Sugar Beach to hang out. For dinner we went to Isana in Kīhei and were blown away by the fast service and delicious food! We had calamari, fish and chips, and a sushi roll and it was all incredible and very reasonably priced! 

11/25- this was our last day as our flight was at midnight, so in the morning we went for a quick swim in the ocean off sugar beach and then showered and checked out of the condo. We went to Makawao and checked out the shops and then went to the Hali’imaile General Store for lunch, which was great. We popped over to Makai Glass Blowing to digest and checkout the art, and then to Maui Pineapple to grab some fresh pineapple for dessert! We went back to Makawao to finish wandering and then went back to Ululani’s one last time. After that we returned to the condo complex where our friends were still staying and we hung out in the pool and hot tub until it was time to head to the airport!

Overall we had an incredible trip and it was heavily influenced by the reviews I read here! We never thought when we visited in 2022 that we would make it back to Maui and we feel so fortunate we had the opportunity! ",2,1764646803.0,MauiVisitors,1,1.0,False

When I first started med school. I was in a class of 35 students so relatively small class. However, I didnt fit in. It became apparent by the first week.

I tried to be social such as introducing myself to others and sitting next to others in the cafe. I noticed that my friendless was met with neutral energy. By the end of the first week, everyone had figure out the people they wanted to be friends with. I knew that something was off when I went to the first bar event. Everyone had car pooled except me and people had formed social circles. I will admit that I am not the best conversationist but I wasnt given a fair opportunity. Most people would stop talking to me within one minute if I was not engaging enough. You could tell with their body language. 

I tried to not take it personally, but I was iced out at the next social event. I was able to tell due to everyone's back being turn towards me and people forming circles where I had to pry my way in. No one expecting me to come. At this point trying to talk to women in the class was pointless. It was clear I was unpopular and most of the women didnt even try to hold a convo except my future female friend. She ironically was the prettiest girl and she took me under her wing. She friended me first on instagram. She even told me that you dont have to sit alone.

Till this day, Idk if she ever liked me. I say this because in the beginning she was extremely touchy and teased me alot. She clam down once she got a bf. But it was crazy becuase I asked her to let me take her to the bar. She agreed and even brought me a cookie as thanks. At the bar, she made it clear that I took her and I was taking her home. I screwed up back then being shy so she went home with another dude lol. That is why I say she might had a small crush. We only stayed friends because she actively text me even presently. But back to the story.

I had it tough. I even tried to become more social by talking more. People just made fun of me. Alot of the guys would hang with my female friend and block opportunities for me to connect. Like inviting her to their house and a couple others. I tried therapy, social skill training, and life coaching. At first I was gaslit into thinking I was the problem. However, at they heard me complain about how people typically never talk to me first unless I walk up to them. They told me to just move on. My last ditch effort was to get drunk with them since I am actually the life of the party. They recording me drinking and claim I was an alcoholic. And that I love driving home drunk.

There was no people on the outside unfortunately. All I had was coffee shops and hobbies. Eventually I isolated myself and moved on. Now 2 years today, I dont even talk to any of them except my female friend. I have a soft side for her since she was supportive back then.

But was there a better way to handle this? It significantly added to the reason why I think everyone is fake and I dont like to socialize as much anymore.",1,1764646689.0,bodylanguage,0,1.0,False

1pby1dt,https://i.redd.it/399gq6jbop4g1.jpeg,It’s the only good fight there is,"Forgive the typos, happened along this over a glass of wine and only days before I take the biggest leap of my life.

I’ve leapt before, and fell down the canyon, and to those around me I probably died.

I’ve climbed again, made new foundations, and realized none of it fucking mattered anyway. 

My interpretation might not be your interpretation, but I’ll tell you what I read:

“You’ve run in circles long enough, I still cant believe you’re not dizzy.

Even though you think you’re so important in other people’s lives you remain only a character in the backdrop of their fabulous perspective. You’re a good character, *we don’t have to worry about you.*

What did you learn after you failed? Because you show me it taught you nothing. You showed me you could find a way to carry on, more than that though, I can’t say.

And when they look at you with those insightful eyes, in not even a second they predetermined your outcome and realized they had the same upbringing as you, nevermind those sharp hard turns and downfalls, the same lesson remained, *life or death,* and we’re still here, and I’m going to take everything you wanted, as if that was what we were fighting for all along, the prefabricated idea of success and failure and all that entails with either, and I’m on this side and you’re on that side, and I won.

But you will ride life straight to perfect laughter, because, all that time you spent alone, you were able to calculate the success of others, and still see it was a bigger and dumber game than it was in those beginning stages. You predetermined their outcome, God, what a waste, fighting for a lifetime.

What a blessing it is to do what makes you happy, and not be robbed of the simple joys of living, of being more excited than nothing else but to arise in the morning to drink your coffee, and read your book, and walk along the trees in the rain and run your first marathon in the woods and tell nobody, and feel a peace and joy so heavy it cannot possibly be shared, and still, find those curious nooks and crannies with strangers in a dimly lit bar who you never knew you shared such passion, and wake up so hungover you couldn’t tell its reality.

And think: I almost went back to being a sucker. In a place I hated being a character I didn’t like… why on Earth did I betray my sense of self?

The only good fight there is. Pursue the inner passion, be happy sleeping on a park bench hungry with the threat of jail time is the only price of admission.

There’s probably nothing worse in the world as being like other people.”

The only good fight there is.

On the second day of training, he gave me both his phone number and email ""in case I needed anything.""

He's been super nice and is always asking how my weekend is, how I'm feeling while training, and buys me my favorite coffee (not free) every shift.

Yesterday, (I had been off over the weekend), he noticed that I changed my nails to a different color and told me that my outfit looked really nice. He said ""I don't think your nails were that color last time I saw you.""

He is always saying that he wishes we weren't working so we could just talk and get to know each other. A few times, he's switched his break and lunch to match mine.

I noticed that whenever I am shelving a book, he places his hand almost directly on top of mine to help, even if I don't need the help. He also almost put his arm around my waist when I tripped backwards.

He notices really small details that I tell him and always seems super interested in what I have to say. With all of these little comments he's making I feel like he's going to ask me to get a coffee or go eat sometime which makes me nervous because he is definitely older and we work every single shift together.

I also notice him looking over at me when we aren't working together.

* Every suburb having its own personality (and strong opinions about it)

I grabbed one of the pans in the clean pan divider and checked it for dirt first,now usually I would just cook and not mind but living with my mom you'd have to check. Now my mom is of normal health and still has good eyesight at her age so what happens next made me a bit vexxed. I called her over the kitchen so that the fact that she half-assed washing the pot that I was about to use wasn't known by my stepdad.My stepdad is the nicest person ever,so I'm shielding him from the fact that my mom is lazy with dishes.

I was awkwardly sitting in my father’s truck at a gas station in West Fork. I was never able to fall asleep the night before and spent most of the remaining hours before dawn on my phone. Of course, my father didn’t have internet, so I was stuck searching social media for information via barely functional cellular signal. By the time the sun had risen, I’d finally figured out what I was looking for.

My father had given me his keys after no small amount of convincing. He made a point of warning me against what I might face in town. I already knew how quickly word spread in a place like this. It was the entire reason I had avoided town in the first place. I had brought everything I needed specifically to stay away from anyone who might recognize me. It was also why I did all my searching for Jen online rather than asking around.

I knew it was creepy at best and borderline stalker behavior at worst, but the last thing I needed with my current predicament was more scrutiny. It was easier to just cross reference social media and find what I wanted anonymously. It just took longer and left me sitting idle after having missed her in the morning as she must have left for work. I had been languishing in the same location for nine hours, staring across a field at her house almost the entire time.

I fell asleep at one point and nearly had the life scared out of me when one of the employees came to knock on my window. Even though I had expected someone to take notice and come around to ask questions, my nerves were thoroughly shot. Still, it was easy enough to just lie and say I was on a road trip and needed some rest. The young man seemed to believe me, but he meekly told me I should leave before the night manager got there. I hoped it wouldn’t take that long.

At around 6:40 in the evening, through the waning orange light of the setting sun, I finally saw a familiar Jeep driving up the road. I turned the old Dodge over and began to drive out of the lot. As I made my way out of the gas station parking lot, I kept an eye on the Wrangler as it drove up and finally parked in the driveway of the house. I was only a minute or so behind her, but even despite the dusky gloam she must have noticed me. The truck I was driving was far from inconspicuous after all.

As I pulled up, I was already mentally preparing myself for how this conversation was bound to unfold. We had already left on fairly poor terms the night before. Showing up at her house like this was not ideal, and I knew exactly how it would make me seem. I found Jen waiting for me outside of her vehicle, clearly displeased at my arrival. She didn’t even let me get out of the truck, approaching the driver’s door before I could turn the key and shut it off. I rolled the window down so that we could speak, wincing somewhat at the squeal of the tired mechanism.

“Ignoring how strange it is that you found where I live,” she said with a clearly pointed intonation, “Can I help you?""

I chose to ignore her judgment, presuming that she’d forget on her own when I spoke my peace, “My father and I spoke last night. I think you’ll be interested to find out what he told me.”

Her eyes were hidden behind a set of mirrored sunglasses and her expression was unreadable. She stood there for a moment, as if she expected me to continue. The awkwardness wasn’t lost on me as I added, “Maybe we could do this without me sitting in this truck.”

There was no question about the apprehension she felt about the suggestion. Her lips were downturned into a frown and even without being able to see her eyes, I could tell she was glaring at me. Her brows were low in a scowl as she stared at me. She was considering her next words carefully, but I could only hope they would be cooperative. If she had changed her mind after our previous interaction, I wouldn’t know how to proceed. She was the only other person I knew that could help me, so it was no small consolation when she sighed and the tenseness in her shoulders fell away.

She looked down the road and pointed at a building across the intersection, “Fine, but I’m not about to invite a strange man into my house. Let’s go to the cafe, you can buy me that dinner you owe me.”

She didn’t offer me much of an opportunity to object. She immediately turned back to her Jeep and walked away. Part of me was quietly glad she remembered that more pleasant conversation. The other part of me, the more rational part, knew she was leading me to a place more public after showing up out of the blue like this. I put the truck back into gear as she reversed out of her driveway. I followed her down the road, parked in the small gravel lot, and had to hop out and move quickly to catch up to her as she headed for the building. 

It was a quaint little cafe that had clearly been refurbished and dressed up from the barebones structure it must have been when it was built. Despite the stone pillars out front that rose up to a small awning, it was clear that the additions were done by non-professional hands. The clashing red brick and yellowed siding was a testament to the decades of effort made to keep up appearances and attract passing customers. The glass doors I raced up toward to open for her were dark and offered little of what waited inside.

Jen paid me no mind as she slipped through the door and into the beige tile and cinder block walled interior. As I stepped in behind her, I felt the dreariness of the place weigh upon me. Despite the best efforts of the owners to dress the joint up with Razorback merchandise and kitschy halloween decor, it was not particularly warm and welcoming. The only saving grace was how relatively busy it was with several booths and tables hosting local families or groups of teenagers having dinner. None of them seemed particularly interested in us, which was a relief to say the least.

A waitress passing by asked, “Got yourself a suitor, Miss Atkins?”

“Not hardly,” Jen answered with a humorless laugh, “It’s work related.”

The woman smirked as she replied, “Well, pick yourself a table. I’ll be with you in a moment.”

I wasn’t sure if I should be offended or not by Jen’s swift dismissal. Maybe it was foolish to hope there was some salvaging of the report we once had, but dining together had rekindled it either way. I had to choke down the feelings of insecurity as she led me to a table in a back corner and took her seat. I situated myself across from her and checked to see that the waitress was preoccupied with another table.

“So what did Declan tell you?” she asked, shifting in her seat to cross her legs and lean back.

The way she got straight down to business was disappointing. I had hoped we could at least pretend we were enjoying one another’s company. This was precisely how I had hoped this dinner would not go, but it was not unexpected. Even before my dishonesty and questionable motivations had come to light, it was a long shot for a date to work out. I was woefully ill-equipped for romance, but at least she was mercy killing that dream at the onset. It made moving forward a little easier.

I leaned in, lowering my voice conspiratorially, “You were right.”

“Don’t do that,” she said, flicking her fingers at me dismissively, “This isn’t a detective movie.”

I felt the blood rush to my cheeks in embarrassment. I sat back and cleared my throat. My eyes shifted away from her and I rubbed my hands together under the table uncomfortably. I didn’t know what to say or do. On my best days, under the best circumstances, I struggled to speak to colleagues about the incredibly mundane aspects of my job. I was at a complete loss about how exactly I was supposed to explain a grand conspiracy to her without looking and sounding like a raving lunatic in this restaurant. 

“Jen,” I said, “You sure we should be discussing this so publicly?”

She cocked her head to one side and answered plainly, “We’re discussing the paranoid ravings of a drunkard. I just need to know if it’s something to be concerned about.”

I stared at her for a moment in shock until I realized what she was doing. My reaction must have been visible, because I noticed a small smirk appear on her lips. It turned into a whole smile as the waitress approached and she looked up at the woman.

“What can I get for you two?” she asked, staring down at a little notepad with pen in hand.

“Coffee,” Jen responded easily, “And two chicken fried steaks.”

The waitress thanked us, told us the coffee would be right out, and left as quickly as she’d arrived. I was left somewhat disappointed in the choice of meal, but chose to let it go. I hated coffee and hated it even more with anything but breakfast food.

“So, Declan?” Jen inquired.

I looked back at her and found her arms crossed over her chest expectantly. I took a moment to collect my thoughts, trying to decide how I needed to explain things in order to keep up the charade. She’d illustrated for me how the conversation needed to unfold, but I needed to contemplate precisely how to present my words to fit. As I did, I couldn’t help but stare, taking in how pretty Jen was. I hadn’t ever shared dinner with a woman as attractive as her.

“Harlan,” she said harshly to demand my attention.

“Sorry,” I hastily apologized, clearing my throat again before getting to the point, “He said they definitely know about what’s going on. All of it.”

She nodded along as I continued, “He thinks they’re responsible for his reputation and even said he was threatened before they did it.”

“And what did he say about the bear?” she asked.

“What bear?” the waitress interrupted as she approached with our coffee.

She set the mugs on the table along with a dish of creamer before filling them from a carafe. It was an agonizingly slow and methodical process that must have actually been quick from regular repetition. My throat was wholly closed up and unable to spout off an answer for the woman out of sheer discomfort. Fortunately, Jen thanked her before answering without missing a beat, “Well, you heard about that girl, right?”

“Oh, god, yes,” the waitress said, shaking her head with a sympathetic expression, “Awful what happened.”

Jen nodded and took on a grim expression, “There’s rumors going around about a bear that may have done it. I’m trying to get to the bottom of them.”

The waitress smiled again and offered, “Well, I hope you all find the thing and put it down.”

“That’s the hope,” Jen said, picking up her coffee mug and taking a sip as the waitress took her leave.

I was impressed at how easily she handled herself. Even setting aside my social awkwardness, she was maneuvering along with her half truths with serious expertise. There was no hesitation and no stumbling over her words, just flawless acting worthy of an Academy Award. It made me extremely self-conscious about my own concocted story I’d used before. I should have known even my best efforts were still going to come off as awkward and insufficient.

Returning her mug to the table and her attention to me, she said, “The bear?”

I wasn’t really sure how to respond. What my father had told me wasn’t exactly easy to weave into a believable story. Even if I wasn’t having to layer what I said in innuendo, it would sound insane. Jen may have been willing to accept there was something going on in the park, but I doubted she was prepared to accept the existence of a literal monster. Ultimately, I decided to stick to the reasonable parts of what was said.

“Did you know he got mauled by it?” I asked, genuine curiosity in what I said.

“Yeah,” she answered, “Did you not? It was in the news.”

I shook my head, somewhat ashamed to say I was that out of touch with my own father, “No, I just found out last night.”

For a moment, there was a falter in Jen’s stern expression. I had almost missed it, but it was there. A slight wrinkle to her nose and a deepening of her frown. Her eyes lost the harshness from a subtle flicker of her brow. Just then, I could see that she pitied me. It made me feel like the world’s worst son, and it reflected in my plaintive tone as I continued.

“Well, he told me that he thinks he stumbled upon its den. It tore his leg up, but he managed to shoot it a few times. I guess it didn’t really hurt it, since it's still out there, but it did run off.”

Jen continued to sip at her coffee as I continued, “I guess, when he got caught this last time, he was out checking that den again. He said it was full of bones, but none of them were human. Not so much as a sign of a person anywhere and nothing had lived there for a while.”

“So it’s a dead lead?” Jen asked, her expression dropping into disappointment.

I shrugged before suggesting, “Sort of. It at least tells us that it’s living in the caves. It probably moved after its territory was invaded.”

“Which also means…” she mused, pausing to take a sip of her coffee, “It probably moved away from the more trafficked areas of the park and is ranging out further for prey.”

I bobbed my head in agreement, “It won’t risk being found in its own home again. Wherever it is, it’s going to be very difficult to reach. Probably somewhere that people never go, probably because *they* have deliberately cordoned the area off.”

“Well,” Jen sighed, leaning back in her chair and staring down into the blackness in her cup, “I guess that’s at least something to work off of. We can probably check records and see if there’s anything that can help narrow things down.”

“We?” I asked, slightly confused.

She flashed me a sort of mischievous expression, “What, did you think I was going to do all the legwork?”

“No,” she chuckled a bit, “No, you’re stuck with me, now. If that crazy old man is right, we’ve got an uphill battle. I’m gonna need all the help I can get.”

I understood exactly what she was getting at and I was neither amused nor comfortable with the situation. Taking on a conspiracy was an entirely different bag of worms than a voice stealing monster. The Howler might tear me limb from limb, but only if I got caught by it within the relatively small area of Devil’s Den. Bill Powell could tear my life apart and ruin me precisely as he had done with my father.

I leaned against the table again and quietly protested, “Jen, that isn’t funny.”

She took on a very serious expression and looked me dead in the eye as she answered, “Probably because I’m not kidding.”

“You’re going to help me,” she said, her voice taking on a slightly hard edge even as she maintained the illusion of civility for those around us, “Your conscience already brought you here, today.”

She looked up as the waitress approached again. I could only watch in mortified silence as she placed our plates in front of us and told us to enjoy. Jen didn’t hesitate to dig right into her food. I sat there with my autonomy stripped from me desperate for a lifeline. My admiration for her nonchalance and conviction was withering into a deep, primordial desire to run for my life.

“Eat,” she said between bites, a vague wickedness to her tone, “It’s good.”",2,1764646346.0,creepcast,0,1.0,False

# How Our Lives Were Intertwined



We first met through our school's roommate portal and started talking about living together, something I regret and wish I had never done now.



There have been issues since the beginning that I have ignored between us.



But..I brushed a lot of it off as a Naive Person at the time. I let them choose where we would end up living during our time at. I had already done a lot of research on which places would work best for someone who couldn't drive and had a small budget. Me mom had narrowed down the list to a few perfect places that could work for both of our situations.



ER has access to all of this information and housing guides as well, which were listed on our schools website, so we did not just go behind their back and choose what would be best without them being able to see and decide for themself. We even took into account everything they needed to live comfortably while looking for a place. I just naturally took the lead on things as I tend to do without meaning to. 



Me and ER ended up moving in together in 2023, both of us Students, we both made friends and had our own circles.



During our first two months there, I'll admit, we were both messy people, I was still adjusting to living on my own and away from Family, and I let the mess get out of hand to a disgusting degree. Our Sink was full of moldy and gross dishes in April, from **both** of us, and I'll openly admit that, I would NEVER say I was some perfect and saint of a roommate between us. EVER.   
  
We cleaned that up…**AFTER I** brought it up and said that it HAD to be taken care of because we cant live like this anymore**,** but..I noticed in the end that I had ended up overall doing more than the…which now looking back Im not even surprised that happened, especially with the context I know now.



They ended up only doing about half of the pots and pans, while I ended up doing the plates, cups, bowls, and silverware, along with the other half of the pots and pans. That moment I really started noticing their behavior with cleaning. I will also add that they STARTED the dishes, what I cleaned was what was LEFT for me to clean, NOT what I VOLUNTEERED to clean.

  
  
But I had decided to start using the dishwasher after that point as I did not want the dishes to get that bad again OR to end up being left with more dishes to do than them. They used the dishwasher for a bit as well, until it sadly destroyed one of their bowls and they stopped using it after that. 



After that, I started trying to be better with cleaning up after myself. I wasn't perfect, and even by the end of us living together, I wasn't perfectly clean by any means, but I was trying to do better. They however, seemed to have been stagnant in their cleanliness and they never got better with cleaning up after themself, leaving dishes in the sink for weeks on end.



One time for over a month dishes were left in the sink to sit and were never touched, and when they were, it was only because I brought it up, they STILL tried to pawn dishes off to me when at that time I was using the dishwasher to clean my dishes and only used the sink to soak dishes for short periods of time…which I shut down and explained that no, I use the dishwasher and these AREN’T my dishes. 



I had also started noticing how all their problems tended to overshadow mine and I had to comfort them no matter how I was feeling, I tried to be there for them when they needed someone to talk to and I had the time and energy. 



But It soon got very draining, every convo I had no matter what with them would end up leaving me drained and exhausted, I would later down the line realize that this was because I was being parentified and my own emotional needs were not only NOT being met by ER (not that I ever asked them to or needed them to) but my own feelings and emotions were constantly being completely bulldozzed over by ERs own needs and I was just expected to take care of EVERYTHING, and I just…shut down eventually, closed myself off, became colder and more distant.   
  
The Stove and Kitchen area was always the worst and caused the most tension as they would make a mess on the stove and it would never be cleaned up, at least from what I noticed during our time together, the stove was only ever seemed to have been cleaned by me and that would happen after weeks of me not seeing any change in cleanliness of the stove. I tried to rarely use the stove at that point due to how gross it was, and when I did use it I tried to use other parts of it than where their mess was. I mainly used the microwave. 



Some of their other unhealthy behavior they displayed while we were roommates goes as followed, They would leave trash out for weeks on end, I had, during our entire stay together witnessed them taking out the trash a total of around five times, I also am made to believe it was the same trash as the formerly shared trash can didn't have the lid on, that typically sat across from it next to a chair at the dining room table, and every time I saw it it looked exactly like the same trash that had been piling up in there, After the second time they took too long to take it out, in my personal opinion, I decided to separate our trash, hanging a trash bag from a dining room chair and using that, taking it out regularly as well. They also kept putting Items on the dining room table, filling up the surface space with trash and old food, I eventually did put my foot down with that one around May or June, I told them to clean it off and that that wasn't for storage, and anytime they tried to start up the habit again I would immediately move the item onto either the stacks of water bottles they have by the dining room table or onto/into the empty cardboard Pepsi Boxes that had been piling up for months next to my couch, and yes I am saying MY couch because my family provided it. 



They would let things get molded, mostly dishes, that's why in June I had decided to put my foot down about my own dishes, I had told them i don't want them using mine anymore and that any dish of mine they had, please put them in the sink and I will deal with them, and by that i meant, I cleaned them, ran them through the dishwasher and put them away in a separate cabinet that was previously not used.



I also stopped using their dishes because, well, I couldn't exactly ask them to stop using mine while still using theirs.



By June, my roommate never left their room,  they had stopped leaving the apartment, and only stepped outside to smoke, grab DoorDash, or to grab groceries that were delivered to be put away, and seemingly dropped out of school, it seems.   
  
I was a full-time student still and had just started a new degree at the time, so I didn't pay much attention to their behavior as I had classwork to do. I spent almost all of my time in my room, working, watching YouTube, or talking with friends. So we both just really kept to our own areas of the house and didn’t talk to each other. By that point, our relationship was kind of…strained to all hell due to the parentification of me and me pulling away from them completely.  It kept up like that until our last month together. We didn't interact, and I avoided being in the same room as them, keeping the door to my room closed and staying out of the shared spaces for the most part for my own emotional health and safety. 



Our last full month together held a lot of obstacles for me. Near the beginning of the month I had moved something on a bookshelf and a bunch of roaches scattered, so even though I had a morning class the next day I spent a good while clearing off that shelf and killing as many roaches as I could in the time, I literally moved everything around in my room, brough the shelves outside and vacuumed them up from the wall.



I also warned my roommate immediatly of the issue as just because they don't have a home in my room now, doesn't mean they wont find a home elsewhere, as well as contacted the office to get an exterminator into the apartment the next day and set bug hotels all around the apartment as well to solve the issue as well as getting bug spray and having it on hand at all times, I did everything in my power to fix the issue. 



Around a week later my mom came to town, and she helped me replace the old table we had that was too big, we ended up asking ER if they wanted to sell the old one we had, cause it was supplied by my family, as their bike had recently been stolen and they could use to money to get a new one, they never ended up selling that table and it still sits outside of the apartment as I found a use for it, she also bought me my own trash can as I had fully stopped using theirs at that point due to them never taking it out, the trash that has been there as of that moment had been there for at least a month.



Then a family member passed in mid-September, and I kinda went numb a bit. I didn’t clean dishes as fast as I used to, and I even called mom to beg to let me come home as I couldn't do this. I wanted to be home, I wasn't in a good place at the time, Mom didn't end up letting me come back home, It was the day after she had passed after all, of course my emotions were running high and with her downward spiral of health issues this past month and everything else piled on, I of course snapped, I stopped caring about cleaning up after myself, I only did my school work so I wouldn’t fail out but even that was a struggle, My friends did help at least, but I was still struggling. 

  


Around the end of the month, my parents went to her wake and brought me some goodies from the restaurant my family went to afterwards, some of which I wouldn't ea,t but it was too hard to throw out, too…final. So sadly it did get gross in the fridge, and that's on me, I should have taken care of it and tossed it the moment I knew I wouldn't eat it, but for anyone who has grieved a lost loved one, you will understand why I couldn't. 



They were gone during late September and early October, coming back a few days into the month, only gone for a few days for a reason that is not my place to name, and unlike the time before, they had left a note, so I did know where they were.



The day after they returned, they texted me about having a friend over that day. I said it was fine. I was actually happy for them, making connections and having plans with people. I had class until six the day they asked, and even ended up staying on campus until around nine, hanging out with my own friends. I didn't want to intrude on their time with their friend, so I stayed out of the apartment as long as I could manage. When I got home, there was no friend to be found and no noises heard, so I just assumed that the friend came and went and that was that…



**I was wrong.** 

  
  




# The Scream That Started the Avalanche 



I had woken up that morning to a stranger in my apartment that I was not expecting, and yes ER did say they had someone coming over but they never said it would be for more than one day, so I was already in a bad mood when the day began now, cause a strange man's voice waking you up from sleep is kind of a scary thing as a afab person, and I was never informed of them possibly spending the night or that they were coming over the next day, I was only informed of them coming over one day and that was all I was ever informed of about having company.  I did let it slide. I had class the day before, so I was tired, and it was finally my day off as well. 



The two left to go grab some food while I was waking up fully, Mom and Dad had recently stopped about a week before all of this and she had given me a toaster oven she found for me to use, so I took it out of the coffee table, which had a hidden compartment for storage, and was getting it out of the box and trying to get it all together. I was in the living room with my cat when they had returned.



I don’t know **why**, but something about their friend made my stomach drop and made me feel like I was trapped in that spot, My heart was beating faster, and my breathing had quickened as well. There was something **off** about him, and every time he looked at me I felt a chill of fear run up my spine. The moment they had gone outside for a smoke and the door closed behind them, I **bolted** to my room with the toaster oven and my cat, breathing slightly erratically due to how scared I was, Just by his sheer presence…its still not something I can explain even two years later, because I had never even MET this man before…but he still made me want to crawl out of my skin. 



When they eventually came back inside, they immediately started rummaging through our fridge for food. 



Now, for some context, the fridge was divided; the Left was their side, and the Right was mine. That's just what we decided on when we first moved in together. 



They made a few comments about old food and such in the fridge, and ER insinuated that it was shared and/or was mine (at least from my POV, that's what it sounded like), which annoyed me because most of the food in that fridge at the time that would have been considered old would have been my roommates…



I will admit that I **did** have some takeout in there from a funeral that had, yes, happened two weeks prior, but I simply wasn't ready to toss it, which was selfish, and I should have just tossed it, but I didn't. And I will own up to that. 



They made their meal…and I just had this sinking, stupid feeling that they used my butter, Cause I remembered an earlier comment about their butter being basically empty (Their butter was also out of date), and then the question “Is this yours?” was asked.



The butter was not shared; they were not given permission. We have had a system for months with no issue before this, and it was Salted Sweet Cream Butter. I had no reason to believe my roommate, who was Literally **Lactose Intolerant,** to use my Dairy Butter, especially when they had their own dairy-free butter in the fridge. 



I will also add that I have a major issue with people just taking my things without express permission, due to my little brother constantly taking my items growing up without asking, and I would also like to add that I am ALWAYS open to sharing. If they had just asked, I would have shared. I am someone who always says yes unless the item is the last of something or I simply want it all to myself. 



Anyway, back to the story, when they eventually entered, I was leaning against the wall by the entrance of the Kitchen, my arms were crossed, cause yes, I was angry, and I was **allowed** to be angry.



“Did you use my Butter?” I asked a question directed at ER. My voice was shaking and so were my hands, and ER seemed to hide behind their friend as they let out a meek “Yes.” I took a deep breath and asked, “Did you **ask** to use my butter?” I could see their friends' faces morphing in anger at my question, and I started to shake more. ER responded with a “No.” Almost fully cowering behind their friend, they seemed scared.



I wanted to end that conversation there, to be honest, cause I felt bad, I didn't mean to scare them. I understand it was most likely a trauma response from their childhood, cause I get the same during these types of situations, but something of mine was used without permission, and it needed to be addressed. I was about to end the convo and go back to my room when their friend suddenly butted in.   
  


“Did it have your name on it?” he asked, Voice laced with anger and annoyance, It had caught me off guard, My hands started to shake and I felt myself back up a bit as I responded “Well…No…but it was mine” I spoke, voice shaking, He rolled his eyes “It was **only** four dollars” He said, voice seeming to raise a bit.



Now, off topic, but here is some added context: I'm a college student on a budget, I don’t have four dollars to just throw around and get new stuff with, and I had already done my grocery shopping for the week a few days prior, so I didn’t have any more money to spare until the following week.



I was shaking at this point, gulping a stranger in my home was showing such aggressive behavior towards me, my roommate had taken that moment to slip all the way to the front door, Their friend then was accusing me of having a moldy sandwich in the fridge, I don't eat sandwiches and I told him as such, after that I let out a small, meek and shaky “Please don’t use my butter..” and quickly ran off to my room. 



Once I was safe in my room is when I suddenly heard my ex roommate sobbing outside, I felt bad, I wanted to go help but I myself was shaking very badly and my breathing was somewhat erratic and then the screaming started, Their friend started full on screaming “Over Fucking Butter!” he yelled, storming back inside, I had quickly locked my door at that point and soon I heard doors slamming and him yelling about how he is gonna get them out of here and away from their bitch of a roommate and how they won't have to deal with any of this anymore.



I don't know what he meant by that last phrase, as there have been very few times I have confronted them and none in person, except this one. I would learn what he meant only a month later.



They were there for a good twenty minutes packing up an overnight bag; they had even left and then returned before leaving again. I was in my room, huddled away from the door, shaking and crying…and texting my friends, needing some semblance of NOT being alone in this moment. 



One last tidbit about me, I hate confrontation. I will put my own comfort second, even if it meant that I don’t have to confront someone, I don’t enjoy yelling, from myself or others so I don't do it, especially out of anger, and my voice was never raised, I know this was the straw that broke the camel's back for them, but I never yelled or scream and fine, yes, I did speak passive aggressively with hints of annoyance, but that's it. This was only a confrontation between roommates, that's all it was and all it ever will be. 



After they finally left, I called my mom, sobbing and explaining what had just happened, trying to get the words out. She listened the entire time and even offered to get me a deadbolt lock, and hell, I considered it…but never did get one.



Actually, I called my mom and immediately hung up after ER and their friend came back inside, only a few moments after leaving to grab a few forgotten items, then called back immediately once they left again, once I felt safe enough to be heard again



THAT'S how unsafe I felt, I didn't want my presence known, because in all honesty, I thought that day was my last, I fully believed that ER's friend would have either killed me or beat me up in that moment, due to not only the energy I got off of them immediately but also their hostile and aggressive behavior towards me. 



A few hours later, my best friend called after getting off work. He was aware of what had happened and wanted to make sure I was safe, even insisting on calling. He stayed on that call with me all night, even refusing to sleep so he could alert me and wake me if he heard something. 



I also locked the door to my room as well as kept a hammer close to me in case something happened, because I was scared and didn't feel safe. 



I was lucky that nothing happened.



But I wasn't aware of the incoming avalanche that would **completely** destroy me. 

  
  


# The Avalanche

# 



The first week they were gone was just filled with worry as they were taken by someone who had shown behaviors of anger, and they had a breakdown right before being taken away. I was worried sick about them and suspected manipulation on the friend's end, getting into their head and twisting the story so they would stay with them. I had no way to reach out. Sadly, I did try texting their number a few times, just trying to check in and make sure they were okay. We didn't get along, no, but I would never wish harm on them.

  
they knocked on my door while I was in my room, working to tell me they are moving out and that's when they started packing items up to leave, I had to talk to them a few more times but would wait for the friend to be gone as just the thought of being in the same room as him would make me cry, because his behavior towards me made me feel deeply unsafe and anxious…



It was mostly about rent and logistics that my parents forced me to talk about. 



I actually more recently found old recordings from that time, one of me at my desk while them and their friend were over, you could hear me clicking on my keyboard before my breath hitches and I let out a small sob…



Listening to it again really puts into perspective how scared I was…and how badly everything was already affecting me.   
  
They texted me the morning after they had informed me of them leaving, we had a short convo about when they are coming back to finish packing everything up, as well as finding a new roommate. I informed them that finding a new roommate is their responsibility, and yes, I would help the best I could, but ultimately, that responsibility falls onto them. 



The last time they visited, I was not actually home. I had a practical exam that day for a class and was gone by around 10 am, and did not return until around 4 pm, as I headed to campus early to be ready for it, and also to be honest, I did it to avoid them.



During that very visit, I had taken precautions and put any valuables of mine they could take into my room along with my cat in fear that they may take her from me to be petty, along with setting up a recording device all in my room and locked my door, I didn't trust them…not at all. And set up precautions in case I got home to something bad. 



I got home to a messy apartment with Items left for me to deal with, which was annoying, but I managed, like I always did.



Things died down for a bit, and then suddenly I get a text of them telling me they found someone which I was excited for, I was happy they helped and that they had found someone, I was a little put off by the age of the first possible roommate but just accepted it as I didn’t want to drag this out any further, so I asked for their number, as I wanted to get to know this person, shortly after that I was informed this person backed out last minute, which okay, that sucks,  but they actually had someone else lined up! so, once again, I asked for this new person's number. 



The Conversation seemed to have dropped off after I asked for the person's number, one that they never sent by the way.   
  
 I heard nothing from them until the following week.. when **suddenly** and what seemed very out of the blue, I got a nasty text from them, accusing me of not trying, calling me names, and acting like that everything should fall onto me, I was shocked…because I HAD been trying, I was just failing *miserably* because our lease only had a few months left…and I wasn't planning on renewing it or even staying after it was finished. 



I'll be honest, and this is just speculation, I think they never HAD anyone and just wanted me to let them off of the lease without doing any of the actual work to get off of it.   
  
  


Soon, there was an attempt at a settlement- that went AMAZING/sar



We told them that we would take them completely off the lease…BUT, they would have to pay us one month’s rent, which is the same deal the apartment complex offered for tenants to break a lease early, we gave them until December's rent was due on the 5th to pay it. The settlement deal was sent in early - mid November. 



I had tried to settle this matter outside of court and had told them what would happen if they didn't work with us, because I just wanted it all to end okay.. I wasn't OKAY, I was being used as a pawn in their game of pretend and just wanted it done…  
  
But I ALSO didn't think they should have just…gotten away with everything so I still held them accountable.



Things were calm once again after the settlement attempt, Thanksgiving came and went and not a word was said and it wasn't talked about, They seemed to have gotten back to their regular life..I did too tbh.  
  
Then.. the First Demand was sent near the end of November when I was in a lab for class, during the second half of class... it was suddenly Public, all private information was blocked out, such as my name and Address, but the fact of the matter was, it was still public, and it kept gaining views..FAST.  
  
The fact that this information, that this demand was made public, it broke something within me, I was shaking, and I felt like I couldn't breathe. I didn't want this public, and I just had to watch it gain traction and support.  
  
I had a small hope that maybe this would be able to help them pay me fully and we would be done with the rent situation.



 It did **not**, and I spent the next few weeks in a stress-induced daze of panic attacks, shaking, and depressive episodes. I'm not saying that as an oh woe is me, feel bad for me, I'm saying that because that's what happened.



Then began the crowdfunding…  
  
Because they used that post to raise money, they used a narrative of me being an entitled and selfish abusive ex-roommate to crowdfund almost 1k to pay me. I was shocked, scared, and also to an embarrassing degree, impressed… 



And before you even ask, how do you know this?



Because it was public information, there were MULTIPLE Twitter posts and a Tumblr post about this situation that painted me just as I described; there are also live streams, which, yes, I watched because I was SCARED, my image was being publicly ruined, and I have a VERY public career, and this type of defamation could have RUINED me. (I am lucky it didn't, and that now their entire account has been deleted so everything is gone) 



Also, there was a narrative of me being a landlord?? Which I still haven't grasped…because like- that one didn't even hold up context-wise.



But whatever..



Then…

reality hit..

**And**



I was reminded **WHO** was doing all this, because, they never told me about the money they raised, the money they raised VERY publicly, at the cost of my reputation and mental wellbeing..



I never did see that money…and I always feel bad for those who donated under the guise of helping a friend in need…almost 1k, gone. Just like that. Never seen again and never used towards the purpose it was raised for.  



I DID eventually make my side public. Months later, I posted a long document. I wanted my side KNOWN, I wanted my pain, my anger, my fear to be KNOWN. Because this wasn't fair, none of this was FAIR., I was being painted as an abuser for simply standing my ground against a man-child, it was almost as long as this one, it was detailed, it had photos upon photos of proof, it was written by someone who couldn't process what was happening to them. 



They responded, because of course they did, and doubled down, which added more to their narrative publicly; their inner circle backed them up…which I wasn't surprised by. 



They sent me a text aswell, something that was SO awful that I avoid rereading even to this day and one that I even refuse to talk in detail about, lets just say that they said that **I** was the reason they tried to off themselves twice…and that I was a selfish entitled jerk, and thats the barely even a clipnote version of it and also its NOT something I feel comfortable enough sharing to any capacity. 



But- something had started shifting…something I wouldn't notice until later down the line…



And well..I decided to back off. Not because they were right, but because my own life was moving forward, and I chose to follow it instead of letting them keep me locked in the past. I got a degree, I made amazing things with my degree, and I made my family proud.



I was also working on my own mental health and actively processing what happened to me at their hands. I was doing better, not perfect…but BETTER. 



# A Year Later - Trying to Melt the Snow



And suddenly…it had been over a year since they bailed on me, since they destroyed my life and mental well-being. 



But…it just kept *bugging* me, like how they just…dropped it, how they got to keep living, how my world was shattered…and the world just- moved on.



I will also say that the reason I didn't do anything sooner was because I was getting my degree, I wanted to get this done, I couldn’t have cared less about the financial burden (that's a partial lie, I was broke af and couldn't afford to sue lol)



They had a year, a year to address everything, with me not even reaching out to them…and they couldn't even be bothered to TRY. 



So I eventually had ENOUGH, and at the beginning of 2025, I decided to finally reach out, putting my foot down and telling them **flat out**: 



“Pay me now or I will see your ass in court.” 

(not really, but that sounds more dramatic and narratively better)



What actually happened was I sent a long and thoroughly written email explaining everything, and basically how I have given them time and they are choosing to ignore the issue, and that **I** am choosing to no longer ignore it. And, remember that settlement deal from earlier? The only payment is one month of rent, and we are done deal? 



*Yeah*, I offered that **again**, WITH the option for a payment plan too, and not a payment plan that would break them either. I offered payments as low as 10 dollars a month, I literally said I understood their financial situation, and I am willing to work with them, but what I am NOT willing to do is ignore this issue anymore. 



Something they didn't even deserve, in my opinion, I could have (and sometimes wish I DID) sued them for the months of unpaid rent, but even after EVERYTHING, I gave them empathy and an easy out of a mistake THEY created..Because I didn’t want an entire court case, I just wanted to move on, but also wanted a consequence to be had.



They agreed, and they signed a contract. We are now about 12 months into the payment plan.



Everything is okay and over, right? 



# The End…Kinda.

# 

*Wrong*



Look, there is no happy ending, no big event of Karma finally hitting, just…life moved on, and I had to move with it.



I still deal with Severe PTSD, Trauma Episodes, Paranoia, and a general avoidance of the internet on the harder days. 



I have spent years working on getting past the harder parts of everything that has happened to me…but this type of stuff lingers and attaches itself to you…especially with no…concrete ending, with no justice or Karma (that is known)



And ER is offline almost completely now, it seems they stopped being such a prominent online figure after their story died… their whole victim act stopped being cute or seen as appropriate, and so..they moved offline.



That should make me happy…it doesn't. 



A depressing ending…I know, but it's a truthful ending to an awful story…



That's just life. And life just SUCK sometimes, even when things get better, even when it feels DEEPLY unfair… You just have to figure out the next steps and decide for yourself. 



Do I stay stuck in the past? Or do I try to move forward?

A couple years ago I had a person with BPD in my life and we had a whirlwind friendship into romantic relationship into abuse and eventual discard. Because of that I’ve been pretty hesitant about even being friends with PWBPD even now. 

Que meeting a really sweet girl and us becoming friends. Her BPD is managed with medication and therapy, and she’s a somewhat close friend cause I’ll never be her favorite person. At least I’m one of her close friends. She likes men a lot 🤣 that also kind of makes her a bad friend to me but we’ll get into that. 

Now, we don’t see each other every day anymore, but we stay friends on socials and every once in a while get together and meet up to talk and get coffee. 

I try and instill healthy relationship ideals into her every single time we talk and I fear I’ve gotten quite obvious at this point. I’ll literally be like how much do you know about this person? How many dates have you been on? Why are you telling me you’re in love with them when you haven’t gone on a date yet? Because I just don’t like seeing this pattern of the intense attachment and then watching her scare every single one of these guys off and sometimes they’ll even tell her that they were scared off by her intensity and I’ll kind of be like yeah maybe next time let’s try to get to know the person better before confessing our undying love.    

Part of that means talking about my current relationship, which is finally healthy and happy and we talk openly and manage our own emotions and are kind to each other and also have an amazing sex life that is healthy and reciprocal. She can sometimes seem very jealous but also wants to hear. I don’t want to make her feel bad I just also want her to see that healthy connection invites the intimacy she craves and isn’t getting but I worry it comes across condescending.

I like having her as a friend, she is a smart, interesting woman, but she cannot be single and most of her self-worth is centered on a relationship with a man, and she’s just seeing guys who don’t want what she wants so she keeps getting heartbroken and to her the world is ending every time, and she tries to explain to me that they were her new favorite person and I’m like kindly how? And she will eventually agree with me. I trying to empathize and say this must be very painful, but it isn’t the guys fault and let’s not continue to beg and stalk them. And when she’s locked in on some of them it’s alllll she will talk about and think about and it’s sooo frustrating cause I want to hear about her career and pets and hobbies and all the things that make a person interesting but she wants to talk about which of her hookups she’s in love with :((

Part of me is starting to feel mean because every time I tell her the same things and I fear that I’m judging her but also I don’t want her to do the thing to other people. I don’t feel a sense of responsibility or deep emotional investment since I’m smart enough to maintain distance and safe boundaries now and I think that is partially why I feel like I’m being a bitch whenever I do talk to her. I don’t want to be evil I just want her be grounded in reality when we do talk. 

Any advice on how to guide someone to refocus their efforts in therapy lol? Or how I can stop feeling guilty for trying to help? I’m always as kind as possible and warn her that I’m going to be blunt if I can’t find a better way to word things. Should I slowly stop the friendship, even though her BPD doesn’t affect me outside of these aspects?

Also, has anyone tried recreating it using the chocolate and coffee flavours, and if so, did it work and what ratios did you use?
I'm hesitant to think that just mixing the 2 together will be the same but maybe i'll have to do a bit of experimenting.
If anyone has any ideas or input etc would love to hear from you.
I am really upset about this very disturbing turn of events after nearly 40 years of it being my favourite beverage (my favourite thing was to put the carton in the freezer and turn it into a mocha slushie), it's going to be tough to find an adequate substitute.
I know there are other mochas out there but clearly, all mochas are NOT equal.

1pbxthl,https://www.reddit.com/r/Coconaad/comments/1pbxthl/bumble_date_haunted_me/,Bumble Date - Haunted Me,"I was bored, so I downloaded Bumble on my phone. Within two hours, I had many likes.
I was staying in a port town in Kochi. There, I saw a guy named Dev, 24 years old, just 5 km away.
He was short, fair, chocolate-boy type. I swiped right. We matched instantly.

We started chatting—basic things at first, and the conversation felt smooth.
He said he was sitting in a café just 2 km from where I stayed, and asked if I could join him for a coffee.
He had a car.
I hesitated… but then thought “It’s just coffee, and he seems fine.”
He specifically asked to choose a place where people were around, so I felt safe and agreed.

Dev came to pick me up, and we went to the café.
The conversation was going great. At some point, I mentioned my obsession with horror and psychological stories.

Suddenly, he said,

> “I know a place nearby… extremely haunted. I’ve been there with my friends once.”



He looked so normal and trustworthy, so I said yes.
The time was around 7 PM when he started driving.

We drove through the town, then slowly left the city lights behind.
The road became narrower—no street lights, no houses.
Just trees on both sides, bending like dark fingers over the car.
I noticed silent couples parked along the way… staring blankly.

Soon the road turned into a single-lane path where two vehicles couldn’t pass.
If one came from the opposite direction, we would have to reverse nearly 1 km back.

Gradually, houses disappeared completely.
By the time we reached the top of the hill, it was 8 PM, but it felt like midnight.

Ahead of us, about 50 meters away, was an old iron gate, wide open.
Behind it stood a massive, broken mansion.
The walls were covered with hundreds of crosses—small, large, carved, painted… everywhere.
I had never seen anything like it. Something felt wrong.

Dev whispered,

> “People live here… but neighbours say they never see them outside. There’s a man who walks around here at night. Looks strange.”



My chest tightened. My hands turned cold.
I said,

> “Dev, please… let’s leave. I’m getting a very bad feeling.”



He nodded,

> “Okay, okay. If you’re uncomfortable, we’ll go.”



Just as he was about to turn the car, I saw him.

A man.
Standing at the gate.
Over 6 feet tall, with a long tangled beard, pale skin, and glowing red eyes.
His stare sliced through the darkness.
His smile—unnatural, stretched, monstrous.

He began walking toward us, slowly… step by step.
Not running.
Just walking.
But it felt like death itself was moving closer.

I started crying, shaking, unable to breathe.
Dev saw him too. His face went pale.
He quickly pulled the steering and did a U-turn.
The tires screeched, and the car flew forward.

I looked back.

The man was still walking.
Not fast.
Not human.
Just walking…
but he was getting closer.

His red eyes and demonic smile are still haunting me.
Even now, when I close my eyes, I see him standing there… watching.

The world is soft and gray. A cool morning chill is in the air. Your thoughts are still fuzzy, floating. The day hasn't really begun yet. The gentle sound of coffee brewing. You open the cupboard and your hand finds it—the one. The mug that feels just right. You feel its comforting weight. The sound of hot, dark coffee pouring into the ceramic is the first real note of the day's song. You wrap your hands around the mug, and a gentle warmth spreads through your fingers, chasing away the chill. You lift it, and the rich aroma of coffee envelops you. You take the first sip. And in that moment, the world sharpens. The day begins. It's a small, perfect sanctuary, just for you.

I’m a (20M) and I’ve been going to this particular coffee shop for about a month now and I think one of the baristas there is very pretty. I want to get to know her, but I’ve always been told to not do that. We have small talk here & there and we share smiles almost every time. When I’m studying, I notice what seems like side eyes from her almost like she’s trying to get a look at me. There was an instance in particular where she didn’t realize I walked in, another barista was taking my order and as soon as she saw me, she walked closer to the table and almost acted like she was doing something just to come up, give me a smile and say hi.

The last thing I want her to feel is uncomfortable if I try to ask her out or make her feel like there’s not a way out especially because all we’ve done is have small talk and share smiles. Usually I wouldn’t care this much, but I really don’t want to miss out on her and I’m for some reason really interested in her.

As of right now, I’m just trying to get to a point where I don’t drink every day. I’ve been drinking every day for at least 10 years, probably more like 12 or 13. Literally maybe only had 1 or 2 days in that time period where I didn’t drink and that was due to serious food poisoning. I’m super functional, alcohol isn’t really causing any big problems for me (other than the harm I’m sure it’s doing to my body). But right now I’m on my 3rd day without a drop. Honestly, it’s hasn’t been hard so far. Thought I wouldn’t be able to sleep but the last two nights I slept like a baby. Then a couple minutes ago I started craving a beer so bad, I have a 12 pack and an 8 pack at home and was thinking about cracking a few open when I get home. Then I got super thirsty (I’ve noticed I’ve been drinking a shitload more water). I just downed a few glasses of water and made a coffee and now my craving for beer has subsided. Is that normal? Does that happen to any of you? If so, is there anything else I should be expecting as I dry out for a little bit? Anyway, sorry for the rant but I don’t really have anyone to talk to about this.

If it doesn't, also fine, there are most standard solutions.

My skin can be super light, almost pink at its lightest but extremely easily darkens to light brown (like immediately without long/significant sun exposure). Tretinoin makes my face super light in contrast to my arms and rest of body, to the point that it looks weird. I put tons of sunscreen on which doesn't help. I'm a guy and tinted sunscreen looks like makeup on me, even when it's a color match. 

I found out that taking some crumbs/grains of instant coffee and mixing it with my moisturizer (1:20ish ratio) makes a brown moisturizer that dries into a matte, even dark beige color. I dap off excess and my face is magically a few shades darker, even skin tone, zero irritation personally, and smells every so faintly of coffee (the smell fades after a bit). It's wild how well it works. It stains the skin the tiniest bit unless I scrub it off

I know you're not supposed to mess with sunscreen formulas, but I can sprinkle the tiniest bit of instant coffee into my palm with sunscreen and same exact thing, it dries perfectly matte, beige/brown, and I put on much much more sunscreen than I usually do because it doesn't leave white streaks and melts into my skin tone.

But at a party where I don't know anyone or at a bar/show/poetry reading at a coffee shop/club/art gallery/anywhere crowded with a lot going on. 

If I'm at a party, I'll just go sit on the patio and vape until people come outside and it's quiet and one-on-one enough I've gotten into some pretty deep conversations w people. 

But inside the party? There's too many ppl, everyone is talking to one another already. So I just go sit by myself bc I don't like...know what to do w myself. 

Poetry reading? I'm going to find a spot next to an empty seat bc I'm scared of strangers. Maybe if someone sits next to me I might start a conversation, but they're probably there w another person and I don't want to intrude on anybody night. 

Bar w a patio- someone will probably bring their dog or wear a cute outfit, and I'll have something to say 



But mostly I don't know what to say to strangers? I don't know how approaching ppl works? I get scared when ppl come up to me bc idk what they want and I'm scared they're trying to make fun of me or something.

1pbxm20,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskSF/comments/1pbxm20/thanksgiving_with_kids_trip_report/,Thanksgiving with Kids: Trip Report,"We go to San Francisco pretty regularly. Thought I would share some general tips and what we did this time over the Thanksgiving holiday.

**Transportation:** There’s no need to rent a car. BART and MUNI or a rideshare will get you everywhere you need to go in the city. Also, kids under 18 ride free on MUNI. This includes busses, light rail, and the streetcar. Kids can just walk on. No need for any kind of pass. For underground fare gates, just walk through the gate closest to the booth. Adults can download the MUNI app and also use it to buy cable car tickets for kids. IKids do not ride free on BART or the cable cars.

The exception for renting a car would be if you are going to Muir Woods. If you go, be sure to [reserve parking](https://gomuirwoods.com/) beforehand and try to get the first time slot of the day.

**Day 1:** Arrive SFO. Getting to the city by ride share or BART is really easy. Had dinner [at Z&Y in Chinatown](https://www.zandyrestaurant.com/). Had the duck, chili lamb, the green beans, and a few other dishes. Gets busy but they take reservations. Went to Lush Gelato in North Beach after.

**Day 2:** [Exploratorium](https://www.exploratorium.edu/). This museum is really great for kids and adults. Every exhibit is hands on and lots of fun. Could easily spend four hours here. Tried the Tactile Dome for the first time. It’s a completely dark enclosure you have to use your sense of touch to get through. Was also a big hit. It sells out, so get tickets beforehand.

Had lunch at Hog Island at the Ferry Plaza. Lunette is also very good. Ended the day on Clement Street in the Richmond. Spent about an hour at Green Apple Books and went to some of the other shops. Dinner at Burma Superstar. Get the tea leaf salad and the eggplant curry. They now take reservations, but only for 5:00 and 7:00 seatings. Ended the day at Kowloon Dessert café for bubble waffles.

**Day 3:** Got coffee and walked to [Transamerica Redwood Park](https://www.tclf.org/landscapes/transamerica-redwood-park). Small park next to the Transamerica Pyramid with a ping-pong and shuffleboard table. Took the J Church line to 30^(th) and Dolores. Stopped by Omnivore Books and then Mitchell’s Ice Cream. Then walked up Valencia Street. Lots of shops, galleries, bookstores, and restaurants. Got tacos at Taqueria Cancun on Mission. Stopped at Dolores Park. It has a great playground if you have younger kids. Bi-Rite Creamery and Tartine bakery also good stops.

**Day 4: (Thanksgiving Day)** A good day to take the cable car. The crowds seemed smaller than usual. Rode from Fisherman’s Wharf down to Market then grabbed coffee. Several places between Powell and Embarcadero were open. Took the N Judah to Golden Gate Park. The botanical garden, Conservatory of Flowers, and Japanese Tea Garden were all open on Thanksgiving. The Botanical Garden was free; the others had a fee this day. Had brunch at Crepevine in the Sunset. They were open until 2:30 on Thanksgiving.

Went down to Sunset Dunes on the 7 bus. Beautiful day for the beach. Lots of people were out. Took a Waymo to the Fairmont hotel. The lobby is decorated for Christmas, including a two-story gingerbread house. Walked to Union Square to see the Christmas tree. Then took the cable car back to Fisherman’s Wharf. [Musee Mecanique,](https://museemecanique.com/) a great arcade, was also open today, until at least 9:00 I think.

We felt like being out rather than cooking, so we ordered premade Thanksgiving dinner from Bi-Rite. It was delicious. They have pickup or delivery options.

Would also recommend Tunnel Tops in the Presidio. Great views and fun playground for kids.

I want new plasma donors to be more informed and become safer donors. I have solid educational advice for new plasma donors who may be considering to try it out, earn extra money, and save lives:

* [Plasma is 92% water and the rest is protein elements](https://www.sigmaaldrich.com/US/en/technical-documents/technical-article/clinical-testing-and-diagnostics-manufacturing/hematology/blood-basics)(about 7%), and other elements such as electrolytes, mineral salts, sugars, fats, hormones, and vitamins. With proper protein consumption, hydration, and electrolyte drinks, the body does replenish plasma volume (mainly the water component) within about 24–48 hours after donation, especially with adequate hydration and nutrition. However,[the full restoration of plasma proteins may take several days](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma), and the 48-hour interval between donations is mandated primarily for donor safety and to allow partial replenishment, but not necessarily because all components are fully restored in 48 hours.
* [During **plasmapheresis**](https://bio.libretexts.org/Bookshelves/Introductory_and_General_Biology/General_Biology_(Boundless)/40:_The_Circulatory_System/40.08:_Components_of_the_Blood_-_Plasma_and_Serum), blood is drawn, plasma is separated, and **red blood cells (and other components) are returned to the donor in cycles**.
* Per FDA regulations, you're only allowed to donate plasma twice in a 7 day period, with a 48 hour wait in-between those two times. Don't risk your health by hopping around to different plasma donation centers to circumvent these regulations, and you may get caught if you do.[Donor identification systems are in place](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma)to **track donations across centers**; attempting to donate more frequently can risk your health and may result in being barred from donation.

1. Eat a meal high in protein 2-3 hours before donating. Your plasma protein levels are influenced by [your **overall diet over several days**](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma), not just the immediate pre-donation meal.
2. Drink plenty of water and/or non-caffeinated juice before donating to stay hydrated.[It's important to stay hydrated](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma)at least the day before, and the day of your donation.
3. Avoid caffeine such as in coffee or soda before donating or it's possible you could get nauseous, lightheaded, vomit, or faint during your donation. **Caffeine is a mild diuretic** and can contribute to dehydration, while not prohibited,[it's recommended to avoid caffeine before you donate](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma).
4. No alcohol 24 hours before, and for a little while after donating as[it can dehydrate you](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma).
5. No strenuous exercise for[at least 6 hours after donating](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma)as it can put too much stress on the vein. Some centers may recommend a longer or shorter time than 6 hours before exercising, but 6 hours is the average recommendation.
6. Some people get away with smoking or vaping nicotine before and after donating, but the nicotine can raise your heart's pulse rate and your blood pressure.[Most centers recommend](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma)avoiding smoking or vaping nicotine at least 30 minutes to 2 hours before donating.
7. [If your pulse rate is above 100](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma), you'll be able to do a vitals retake after a 15 minute wait. But if it's 100 or higher again you'll be deferred for the day. Taking sort of slower but deep breaths for 10 to 15 minutes before getting your vitals taken should help lower your pulse rate,[the box breathing technique](https://www.healthline.com/health/copd/box-breathing/)may also help ease your pulse rate. If your pulse rate is an issue, listen to binaural beats that are known to reduce anxiety and lower heart rate, at a low to medium volume with earbuds/headphones. Or try listening to ""Pink Noise"" or ""Green Noise"" at a low to medium volume before donating which may help reduce your pulse rate, along with its effect on lowering your blood pressure.
8. There is[a risk of getting a blown vein](https://medlineplus.gov/ency/article/000045.htm/)if the worker is having a hard time finding your vein when they're sticking you with the needle or if you have small veins. You may get deferred until your vein heals if that happens. But it's ok,[your body is able to heal and repair your veins](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq) via normal tissue healing.
9. There is a risk of blood clots, but when your blood is constantly moving through the machine[it prevents that from happening](https://www.cslplasma.com/start-donating). There will also be what’s called[an anticoagulant liquid](https://www.fda.gov/vaccines-blood-biologics/blood-donor-eligibility/blood-donation-process/)that will prevent you from getting blood clots.
10. You may be[subject to drug screening](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq/new-donor). The[drug screening tests](https://www.redcrossblood.org/faq.html#eligibility-medications%5C)for methamphetamines, cocaine, and heroin. Certain pharma prescription meds may show up as a false positive so you'll want to let the plasma center know what meds you're taking. Testing positive for these drugs can result in a permanent deferral from donating plasma.
11. A sample of your blood will be drawn periodically[to test for certain sexually transmitted infections](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq/new-donor)(STIs). A positive test will result in[either a temporary or permanent deferral](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq/new-donor)from donating plasma. If you've ever been diagnosed or received treatment for HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis B (HBV) or Hepatitis C (HCV) you will be permanently deferred from donating plasma.

* Wait[at least a few hours](https://www.cslplasma.com/start-donating)before taking the bandage wrap off of your arm after donating[to reduce bleeding and bruising risks](https://www.redcrossblood.org/donate-blood/blood-donation-process/after-your-donation.html/).
* [You can use Castor Oil](https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/castor-oil)on the needle site[for the puncture area to heal better](https://www.mayoclinic.org/first-aid/first-aid-minor-cuts/basics/art-20056711). A Q-tip can be used to apply it easier. I simply dip the Q-Tip in the bottle, but never dip the used cotton back into the bottle. However, certain people may be allergic to Castor Oil, in that case Vitamin E/Mineral Oil can be used instead, but certain people may also be allergic to that too. Use of topical agents is not part of official plasma donation guidelines. If you choose to use them, be aware of potential allergies.
* Frequently donating over a prolonged period of time may lead to your body having[decreased immunoglobulin levels](https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/VitaminD-Consumer//).
* Red meats are[particularly high in the protein nutrients](https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/nutritionsource/food-features/meat/)found in plasma.
* **Taking vitamin and mineral supplements** (e.g., vitamin D, calcium, magnesium, zinc, iron)[is generally safe in moderation but can be harmful in excess](https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/list-VitaminsMinerals//). Most people get enough from their diet. **Protein shakes** before donation are not required but can help maintain protein levels.

# Donating Plasma with Managed Diabetes

Individuals with well-controlled diabetes can contribute to plasma donation, but certain criteria need to be met:

[Absence of Complications](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq): This means no existing diabetic complications affecting your kidneys, heart, blood vessels, or eyes.

Insulin: If you rely on insulin for diabetes management,[you must be healthy when you donate](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq/new-donor)and be free of symptoms or treatment needs related to blood sugar fluctuations (high or low). A 3-month wait period applies to non-prescribed drugs.

1. [Healthy Feet](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq/new-donor): Active foot ulcers requiring medical attention will disqualify you from donation.
2. [Steady Balance](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq/new-donor): You shouldn't experience dizziness or lightheadedness upon standing.
3. Type 1 Consideration: For Type 1 diabetics, eating within two hours of donation[is highly encouraged for all donors](https://www.cslplasma.com/blog).

1pbxktl,https://www.reddit.com/r/MotivationByDesign/comments/1pbxktl/why_you_freeze_in_conversations_even_if_youre/,Why You Freeze in Conversations (Even If You're Smart): The BRUTAL Truth + the Fix,"Ever blanked mid-conversation and felt like an idiot, even though you’re well-read, thoughtful, maybe even top of your class? Yeah, same. It’s one of the most frustrating things, being smart on paper but sounding awkward or silent in real-time. What’s wild is how common this is. You’d be shocked how many smart, introspective people choke up during normal social moments. Not because they’re dumb. But because their nervous systems are in panic mode.

And no, confidence hacks from TikTok influencers yelling “Just say it with your chest!” aren’t gonna solve it. Most of those people are just performers, not trained communicators. They’re not talking about what's really happening in your brain and body. Luckily, experts in neuroscience and psychology are. so I dug into the best books, podcasts, and research to piece together what actually works.

Here’s the real reason why your brain goes blank and how to fix it without “fake confidence” BS.

### Step 1: Understand what’s actually happening in your brain

Freezing in conversations has little to do with intelligence. It’s a nervous system response, one that’s rarely talked about. According to Dr. Stephen Porges’ Polyvagal Theory, the body has three main responses to social threats: fight, flight, and freeze. When you feel judged or under pressure, your brain flags social interaction as a threat. So you freeze. Even if there’s no real danger.

Lisa Feldman Barrett, a neuroscientist who wrote How Emotions Are Made, explains that emotions aren't hardwired. They’re predictions based on past experiences. So if your nervous system “learned” that speaking up = rejection or embarrassment, even once, it will try to protect you by shutting down your voice in the future.

Translation: your body is trying to help you survive. That’s why you can be super articulate solo (or even write essays like a genius), but your brain short-circuits mid-coffee chat.

### Step 2: Rewire your nervous system to feel safer socially

Fixing this isn’t about rehearsing speeches. It’s about telling your body, “Hey, this is safe now.” Here’s how:

- Practice “silent exposures.” Start by rehearsing responses in your mind before actual conversations. Then say them out loud when alone. Slowly expose yourself to higher-stakes interactions. Just like exposure therapy.

- Use the “Soft Eyes” trick. From somatic therapist Irene Lyon: soften your gaze slightly when talking to someone. It calms your nervous system and breaks the hypervigilance that makes you freeze.

- Breathe low and slow. Shallow chest breathing tells your body to panic. Deep belly breaths cue safety. Try the 4-7-8 method (inhale 4 sec, hold 7, exhale 8) before or even during social situations.

- Start with body warmth. According to research from Yale’s Human Cooperation Lab, physical warmth (like holding a hot drink) increases perceived trust and friendliness in social settings. It literally helps your body feel safer.

### Step 3: Train your brain with better tools (not just affirmations)

Your inner dialogue fuels how you show up. But “just think positive” isn’t enough. You need tools that challenge the fear script in your head. These help:

1. The book: The Courage to Be Disliked by Ichiro Kishimi and Fumitake Koga  
   This best-selling Japanese philosophy-meets-psychology dialogue breaks down why social anxiety often comes from people-pleasing and fear of rejection. It reframed everything I believed about approval and self-worth. Insanely good read. This book will make you question every social script you’ve been taught.

2. Podcast: Huberman Lab - “How to control your stress in real time”  
   Dr. Andrew Huberman breaks down how stress hijacks your cognitive capacity—and how techniques like panoramic vision and breath control can give you back your words. Science-backed, super actionable.

3. YouTube: Therapy in a Nutshell  
   Hosted by Emma McAdam, this channel has short, non-cringe breakdowns of social anxiety, nervous system regulation, and communication confidence. The “Why you shut down in conversations” video? A must-watch.

4. App: Finch  
   It’s a self-care pet app that uses gamification to track small wins—like “I initiated a conversation today” or “I stayed present while someone talked.” It's cute but strangely effective. Keeps you moving without overwhelm.

5. App: BeFreed  
   BeFreed is an AI-powered learning app, recently viral on X with over 1M views, built by a team of former Google engineers and Columbia alumni. It turns expert books, research, and talks into personalized podcast-style lessons based on your goals—like becoming more confident socially or improving communication.  

   I use it to generate deep-dive sessions on topics like “how to stop ruminating after conversations” or “practical frameworks for handling awkward silences.” You can even chat with its avatar, Freedia, for follow-ups or flashcard recaps. The voice and tone are customizable which makes it weirdly addicting. Honestly, I’ve finished more books and expert insights here than I ever did with Blinkist. No brainer for any lifelong learner.

6. Website: Ash  
   Ash is a relationship coaching platform that pairs you with AI and human coaches to talk through emotional stuff, including communication issues. Super useful if you need real conversations to practice but don’t want to risk awkwardness IRL just yet.

### Step 4: Learn actual communication frameworks

Freezing often happens when your brain says, “I don’t know what to say.” But half the time, you’re just overthinking sentence structure or fearing judgment. Pre-loading your brain with templates helps.

- The “FORD” technique (from Dale Carnegie methods): Ask about Family, Occupation, Recreation, Dreams. It’s a cheat code to keep conversations going without overthinking.

- “Notice, Name, Ask” model from social skills coach Vanessa Van Edwards: Notice something (their shoes, mood, energy), name it (“That’s an amazing jacket”), then ask a question (“Where’d you get it?”). Keeps flow natural.

- Use “AND” instead of “BUT.” Small switch, big difference. Saying “That’s true AND I also think…” keeps the conversation warm instead of confrontational.

### Step 5: Read books that prepare your mind to speak

These books deepen your ability to observe and express, which is often the missing link:

6. Book: Speak by Tunde Oyeneyin  
   A brutally honest memoir meets a communication manual. Tunde is a Peloton instructor who went from self-doubt to global speaker. It’s raw, uplifting, and gives that bold but grounded voice we all need.

7. Book: The Art of Thinking Clearly by Rolf Dobelli  
   Best-selling behavioral psychologists break down cognitive biases that silently sabotage social interactions. Super readable. Made me WAY less self-conscious in convos. Best book I’ve read on clean, sharp thinking.

8. Book: Maybe You Should Talk to Someone by Lori Gottlieb  
   A therapist reveals what really happens behind closed doors in therapy, including her own sessions. Helps you feel less weird about your own brain. Beautifully written. This book made me feel seen.

These tools won’t make you a loud extrovert. But they’ll help you speak up when it counts. Even if you freeze today, your brain is rewire-able. Every “awkward” moment is just data. Not a failure.",2,1764645330.0,MotivationByDesign,0,1.0,False

Referral Code: AYLGY54DAG

I want new plasma donors to be more informed and become safer donors. I have solid educational advice for new plasma donors who may be considering to try it out, earn extra money, and save lives:

* [Plasma is 92% water and the rest is protein elements](https://www.sigmaaldrich.com/US/en/technical-documents/technical-article/clinical-testing-and-diagnostics-manufacturing/hematology/blood-basics)(about 7%), and other elements such as electrolytes, mineral salts, sugars, fats, hormones, and vitamins. With proper protein consumption, hydration, and electrolyte drinks, the body does replenish plasma volume (mainly the water component) within about 24–48 hours after donation, especially with adequate hydration and nutrition. However,[the full restoration of plasma proteins may take several days](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma), and the 48-hour interval between donations is mandated primarily for donor safety and to allow partial replenishment, but not necessarily because all components are fully restored in 48 hours.
* [During **plasmapheresis**](https://bio.libretexts.org/Bookshelves/Introductory_and_General_Biology/General_Biology_(Boundless)/40:_The_Circulatory_System/40.08:_Components_of_the_Blood_-_Plasma_and_Serum), blood is drawn, plasma is separated, and **red blood cells (and other components) are returned to the donor in cycles**.
* Per FDA regulations, you're only allowed to donate plasma twice in a 7 day period, with a 48 hour wait in-between those two times. Don't risk your health by hopping around to different plasma donation centers to circumvent these regulations, and you may get caught if you do.[Donor identification systems are in place](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma)to **track donations across centers**; attempting to donate more frequently can risk your health and may result in being barred from donation.

1. Eat a meal high in protein 2-3 hours before donating. Your plasma protein levels are influenced by [your **overall diet over several days**](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma), not just the immediate pre-donation meal.
2. Drink plenty of water and/or non-caffeinated juice before donating to stay hydrated.[It's important to stay hydrated](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma)at least the day before, and the day of your donation.
3. Avoid caffeine such as in coffee or soda before donating or it's possible you could get nauseous, lightheaded, vomit, or faint during your donation. **Caffeine is a mild diuretic** and can contribute to dehydration, while not prohibited,[it's recommended to avoid caffeine before you donate](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma).
4. No alcohol 24 hours before, and for a little while after donating as[it can dehydrate you](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma).
5. No strenuous exercise for[at least 6 hours after donating](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma)as it can put too much stress on the vein. Some centers may recommend a longer or shorter time than 6 hours before exercising, but 6 hours is the average recommendation.
6. Some people get away with smoking or vaping nicotine before and after donating, but the nicotine can raise your heart's pulse rate and your blood pressure.[Most centers recommend](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma)avoiding smoking or vaping nicotine at least 30 minutes to 2 hours before donating.
7. [If your pulse rate is above 100](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma), you'll be able to do a vitals retake after a 15 minute wait. But if it's 100 or higher again you'll be deferred for the day. Taking sort of slower but deep breaths for 10 to 15 minutes before getting your vitals taken should help lower your pulse rate,[the box breathing technique](https://www.healthline.com/health/copd/box-breathing/)may also help ease your pulse rate. If your pulse rate is an issue, listen to binaural beats that are known to reduce anxiety and lower heart rate, at a low to medium volume with earbuds/headphones. Or try listening to ""Pink Noise"" or ""Green Noise"" at a low to medium volume before donating which may help reduce your pulse rate, along with its effect on lowering your blood pressure.
8. There is[a risk of getting a blown vein](https://medlineplus.gov/ency/article/000045.htm/)if the worker is having a hard time finding your vein when they're sticking you with the needle or if you have small veins. You may get deferred until your vein heals if that happens. But it's ok,[your body is able to heal and repair your veins](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq) via normal tissue healing.
9. There is a risk of blood clots, but when your blood is constantly moving through the machine[it prevents that from happening](https://www.cslplasma.com/start-donating). There will also be what’s called[an anticoagulant liquid](https://www.fda.gov/vaccines-blood-biologics/blood-donor-eligibility/blood-donation-process/)that will prevent you from getting blood clots.
10. You may be[subject to drug screening](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq/new-donor). The[drug screening tests](https://www.redcrossblood.org/faq.html#eligibility-medications%5C)for methamphetamines, cocaine, and heroin. Certain pharma prescription meds may show up as a false positive so you'll want to let the plasma center know what meds you're taking. Testing positive for these drugs can result in a permanent deferral from donating plasma.
11. A sample of your blood will be drawn periodically[to test for certain sexually transmitted infections](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq/new-donor)(STIs). A positive test will result in[either a temporary or permanent deferral](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq/new-donor)from donating plasma. If you've ever been diagnosed or received treatment for HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis B (HBV) or Hepatitis C (HCV) you will be permanently deferred from donating plasma.

* Wait[at least a few hours](https://www.cslplasma.com/start-donating)before taking the bandage wrap off of your arm after donating[to reduce bleeding and bruising risks](https://www.redcrossblood.org/donate-blood/blood-donation-process/after-your-donation.html/).
* [You can use Castor Oil](https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/castor-oil)on the needle site[for the puncture area to heal better](https://www.mayoclinic.org/first-aid/first-aid-minor-cuts/basics/art-20056711). A Q-tip can be used to apply it easier. I simply dip the Q-Tip in the bottle, but never dip the used cotton back into the bottle. However, certain people may be allergic to Castor Oil, in that case Vitamin E/Mineral Oil can be used instead, but certain people may also be allergic to that too. Use of topical agents is not part of official plasma donation guidelines. If you choose to use them, be aware of potential allergies.
* Frequently donating over a prolonged period of time may lead to your body having[decreased immunoglobulin levels](https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/VitaminD-Consumer//).
* Red meats are[particularly high in the protein nutrients](https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/nutritionsource/food-features/meat/)found in plasma.
* **Taking vitamin and mineral supplements** (e.g., vitamin D, calcium, magnesium, zinc, iron)[is generally safe in moderation but can be harmful in excess](https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/list-VitaminsMinerals//). Most people get enough from their diet. **Protein shakes** before donation are not required but can help maintain protein levels.

# Donating Plasma with Managed Diabetes

Individuals with well-controlled diabetes can contribute to plasma donation, but certain criteria need to be met:

[Absence of Complications](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq): This means no existing diabetic complications affecting your kidneys, heart, blood vessels, or eyes.

Insulin: If you rely on insulin for diabetes management,[you must be healthy when you donate](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq/new-donor)and be free of symptoms or treatment needs related to blood sugar fluctuations (high or low). A 3-month wait period applies to non-prescribed drugs.

1. [Healthy Feet](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq/new-donor): Active foot ulcers requiring medical attention will disqualify you from donation.
2. [Steady Balance](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq/new-donor): You shouldn't experience dizziness or lightheadedness upon standing.
3. Type 1 Consideration: For Type 1 diabetics, eating within two hours of donation[is highly encouraged for all donors](https://www.cslplasma.com/blog).

1pbxiyd,https://www.reddit.com/r/EmployerBrandingHub/comments/1pbxiyd/employer_spotlight_why_efs_employer_brand_sets/,Employer Spotlight: Why EF’s Employer Brand Sets the Bar So High 🌍,"Just checked out PLOY’s latest employer spotlight on EF (Education First) and wow—talk about workplace goals. EF isn’t just about teaching the world; they’re an employer branding case study in action.

* Ever seen an office tour that feels like Architectural Digest? EF London’s space has barista coffee, a private gym, and rooms with quirky names (who doesn’t want to answer emails in “Cork”?).
* “Work trips” at EF = hopping from São Paulo to Zürich. For most, that’s a vacation. For EF folks, that’s just a Tuesday.
* EF Japan’s staff timeline runs from 1995–2025. People actually stay and grow here—how rare is that?
* Career progression isn’t just marketing hype. One EF leader’s journey spans Amsterdam, Hong Kong, Tokyo, Zurich, and Boston—actual global mobility.
* Interning at EF? Summers in Malta, snorkeling trips at Blue Lagoon included.
* The “day in the life” videos across London, Zürich, and Boston are real: global teamwork, culture, and the fun chaos of time zones.
* They even invest in early careers with co-op orientation programs, full training, and tours. Apparently, their offices look like movie sets.
* The “This or That” challenge on a team trip is unfiltered fun—adults sprinting across fields, showing off the real personalities behind the roles.
* When EF renovates their offices, it’s all about collaboration and sustainability—think upcycled furniture and open creative spaces.
* That awkward “meeting room skit”? We’ve all done it, but EF puts it on video for laughs.

EF’s not just selling education—they’re actively building a global workplace people want to be part of. All these videos and stories? Proof that people actually enjoy coming to work. Hats off, EF…and PLOY, keep these spotlights coming!

If you’re into employer branding or just want inspiration for workplace culture, you need to see what EF and PLOY are up to. Anyone else thinking about a career switch? 👀

Driver didn’t even look mystical or guru-ish, just a dude vibing like he was 2 coffees behind in life. 

We roll off n suddenly every corner starts looking like a rerun from the life....
 i kinda lived but also kinda ditched cuz i got tired or scared or whatever dumb excuse i told myself back then,i’m literally staring out the window like wtf is this the nostalgia speedrun dlc pack?

We pass the field where i used to skip class n pretend i was deep but really i was just tired n broke n annoyed at everyone      breathing near me,  then that diner pops up...the one where i used to eat fries w people i don’t even text anymore. ain’t that weird? like u spend years w someone, share dumb jokes n break your heart in lil ways together.

Then boom one random tuesday they’re just… gone from your whole damn timeline, i’m laughing to myself like bro life really be like “new cast every season hope u keep up.”

Then the driver goes “u miss any of them?” like he’s reading my mind or eavesdropping on the chaos echoing in my skull. i’m like “nah.. maybe… idk man it’s complicated,” which is basically the human version of shrugging at ur own existence.

 Bcoz yea sometimes i miss them, sometimes i don’t, sometimes i miss the idea of what i thought we were instead of what we really were. real messy adult brain rot type vibes.

the one i thought would be like… permanent. 
silly me.

 She’s not even there now obviously but my chest did that stupid flip like my body didn’t get the memo that life moved on....

Anyone else noticing this shift?","Crypto feels different this time around. Not necessarily more hyped, just more usable. A few years ago it felt like everything was built for traders, speculators and people who enjoy having five tabs open for a single transaction. Lately I keep noticing more things that are simply convenient to use day to day.

Swaps are quicker and less confusing. Onboarding is less of a headache. Yield products exist that do not look like a casino. You can hold crypto or stablecoins and actually spend them with a card, without doing the manual off-ramp routine every time you want a coffee. It feels less like ""early access tech"" and more like a set of tools you can quietly plug into your normal financial life.

I still use DeFi for part of my stack because I enjoy experimenting and I like the control it gives. At the same time I realised I do not want everything to feel like an experiment. For the part where I want things simple and predictable, I use something regulated and easy to handle. Neхо ended up in that role for me. I keep some liquidity there, earn a reasonable yield on stables and use their card when I want to spend directly from that balance. It is not about chasing the last percent of APY, more about having a setup that works without friction. 

To me this shift toward usability is more interesting than any price move. When people start using crypto products because they are genuinely more convenient than what they had before, that feels like the real form of adoption, even if no one is shouting about it on X. 

Curious if others feel the same. Have you changed how you use crypto in your daily life compared to the last cycle, or is it still mostly trading and holding for you?",1,1764644635.0,CryptoMarkets,3,0.6,False

by [https://www.gptsportswriter.com](https://www.gptsportswriter.com) **Fulham vs. Manchester City: A David-and-Goliath Showdown with a Side of Sausage Rolls**

Ladies and gentlemen, prepare for a Premier League clash that’s as lopsided as a half-eaten biscuit. On Tuesday, December 2, 2025, Fulham—the Cottagers with the audacity to wear maroon—host Manchester City, the defending champions who treat title races like a casual coffee sprint. The odds? A mathematical masterclass in why you shouldn’t bet your grandma’s knitting needles on underdogs.

**Parsing the Odds: City’s Implied Probability is Basically a Mathematical Fact**  
Let’s crunch the numbers like a crisp pork pie. Manchester City is priced between **1.62 and 1.69** across bookmakers, translating to an implied win probability of **\~60-61%**. Fulham? A meager **18-20%** (decimal odds of 4.75-5.3). The draw? A paltry **23-25%**, which is about the same chance I’d give a coin flip if the coin was tossed by a seagull. In layman’s terms: City’s win is as inevitable as tax season. Unless Erling Haaland decides to moonwalk into the stands, this is a foregone conclusion.

**News Digest: City’s “Dirty but Winning” Playbook vs. Fulham’s “Bake-Off” Streak**  
Manchester City, under Pep Guardiola, is desperate to avoid another “almost had it” title collapse. Their recent “dirty but winning” mantra? Sounds like a toddler’s breakfast strategy. They’ll likely lean on Rodri’s midfield tyranny and Erling Haaland’s ability to score goals even when he’s asleep. Oh, and their probable lineup includes Donnarumma in goal—yes, *that* Donnarumma, who’s so good, he’s like a human flytrap… if the flytrap wore a Manchester City away kit.

Fulham, meanwhile, is riding a two-game winning str

1pbx26u,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1pbx26u/i_realized_i_stopped_taking_care_of_myself_in_the/,I realized I stopped taking care of myself in the relationship and that’s when I knew it was over.,"**First time posting here, but I’ve read a lot of stories from young people going through breakups, and I wanted to share mine mostly to say: it** ***does*** **get better, but you also have to choose to get better.**

**TL;DR:**  
Dated a guy for about 6 months who never took initiative. I planned for almost everything while he stayed in his comfort zone. I realized I was losing myself again, stopped feeling special, and our life goals didn’t align. He had social anxiety, but I still deserved effort, affection, and partnership. Broke up, felt sad for a bit, but now I’m healing, taking care of myself, and choosing not to stay in relationships where I hope someone will change. It gets better once you choose yourself.

About a month ago, he and I decided to end things. We were never “official,” but we’d been exclusive since the 3rd or 4th date and he was the one who asked for exclusivity.

For context: I’ve been in two long-term relationships before (both over 2 years) and they were terrible. I stayed way too long, got stuck in the highs and lows, and ended up completely losing myself. I always describe my last ex as someone who held me like a vase and then dropped me over and over again. By the time I finally left, I was bitter, angry, and treating even the people who loved me badly.

So I rebuilt my life. Two years ago I started therapy, because when I eventually tried dating again, I realized I was falling for the same types: avoidant, narcissistic, low self-esteem. Meanwhile, *I* was avoidant too. So I took an 8-month break from dating and focused on myself and my patterns. It helped me grow a lot.

When I finally started dating again, I met someone I clicked with instantly. But in hindsight… everything moved too fast. We acted like a two-year couple in one month. I wanted actual dates, adventures, effort and instead I found myself constantly in his comfort zone, planning 95% of every date or activity.

The first major crack was right before I was leaving the country for a month. He said he wanted to spend the weekend with me… then the day before told me he was going shopping with his friend instead. I snapped. He never initiated anything, it was always my place or his, watching something or playing games. I love cozy nights too, but I also needed him to show initiative and he never did. I was literally begging for him to plan *one* date, something that should come naturally if someone actually wants you.

After my trip, I asked again if he could plan a date. Two months later, he finally did and showed up in a bad mood, no flowers, no affectionate words, nothing. I’d invited him out plenty of times before; this was the one time I needed him to show up emotionally, and he didn’t.

When we broke up the first time, he mentioned that he has social anxiety. And suddenly things made sense: why he never took initiative, why he only did things if I or his friends planned them, why he’d never tried certain foods, experiences, or even something simple like iced coffee. I’m adventurous. I want stability too, but I also want a partner who tries.

After the official breakup, I broke no contact twice. Not because I wanted him back, but because I respect him as a human and I needed to express the things I didn’t say. I wasn’t perfect either and after the first breakup I became bitter and took it out on him, and I apologized for that.

Something that also threw me off was our life stages. He’s 6 years older than me, but only started studying recently, something that honestly felt like kindergarten-level art classes with zero career security. Meanwhile, I’ve studied, worked for 5+ years, and I’m actively building my career. Our paths weren’t aligning.

Eventually I realized I didn’t feel special to him. He couldn’t give me the love I needed, and the future I wanted wasn’t possible with him. I’m not looking for a fling I want a partner, best friend, travel companion, someone to build a life with. He wanted those things too… but only inside his comfort zone.

And I deserve more. I deserve to be taken out on a date. I deserve flowers. I deserve effort.

There’s way more to the story, but the bottom line is: when I care about someone, I show up. If I hurt someone, I’m at their door apologizing immediately. If they’re sick, I bring groceries and take care of them. I give what I want to receive.

Of course I was sad after the breakup and I let myself feel it for about a week. But then you have to get up, take control, and move forward. Time doesn’t wait for you.

Today, I still think of him sometimes, but I genuinely feel happy and lighter. I’m taking care of myself again, something I completely stopped doing during the relationship. And that’s the biggest lesson: **don’t keep dating someone just because you hope they’ll change. And the moment you stop taking care of yourself, it’s already over.**

I have the right to be happy. I’m still healing, still learning, still working on my trauma responses but I’m moving forward.

I just upgraded to an Ode Gen 2 from a cheap Amazon grinder where I basically eyeballed everything. I’m slowly trying to build a solid pour-over setup, but dialing things in has taken a little time.

The last two cups I made were both described as much stronger/stout than normal with the cheap grinder.

First cup: ground on 4 setting

Second cup: ground on 6
(She said both still tasted stronger than her normal.)


So my question is:

Would a coarser grind actually make the coffee less strong, since the brew time should be shorter? Or am I misunderstanding how that works?

My current Chemex recipe (yes, I know 😄) is:
20g coffee → 340g water (1:17)

Just as a way to hold myself accountable. And I think once I’m more convinced that I can stick to my budget on my own… I’ll slowdown a bit.

But last week (the week of thanksgiving). I stayed 15 dollars under budget. Biggest expense ended up being getting groceries on instacart (did not want to deal with thanksgiving rush). And once I ordered some Mcdonalds delivery cause it was really late and my nearest one was closed. (I was craving them).


As for food that week. I relied a lot on canned pastas and a few frozen burritos. On the weekend, I bought lettuce and cherry tomatoes for like 3-4 salads to share with my roommate. And bought stuff for grilled cheeses (he made tomato soup). A couple of times that week, I got dome deli sandwiches when I felt really lazy.

Already grocery shopped and did some prep for this week. So I have pre boiled pasta ready to go. Pre made a bunch of rice as well. So I have two comfort meals (yogurt and rice which is a common dish where I grew up). And also some pasta sauce. So these meals see ready with just the microwave.

I have eggs and some lean beef I bought on Sunday. So on Wednesday I’ll make some meatballs and batch boil some eggs to put in the fridge.

So yeah. I have very easy access to:

1. Salads. (A couple of portions)
2. Proscuitto and fig sandwhiches (like 2-3 portions)
3. PBJs
4. Grilled cheeses (I make amazing grilled cheeses. Like fr)
5.Pastas with canned sauces
5. Rice options.
6. Cereal and milk
7. Boiled eggs (i eat them with a sriracha mayo)
8. Meatballs
9. A bunch of apples
10. Protein bars if I’m lazy.
11. Chips to snack on if I get hungry and snacky.
12. I have enough coffee for the week. So I don’t need to spend silly money on it.
13. Frozen tenders and frozen fish sticks.
14. I have frozen cacio pepe sauce from Trader Joes to go with pasta as well.
15. Some frozen Broccoli Beef.

Sure. It may not be the best of the best in terms of food options. But I can see myself making it to Sunday without *needing* to spend more on food at restaurants. (Unless I want to entertain myself/dates/hangouts).

And yeah… I genuinely like Pastas and rice with yogurt. I get to make that healthier with some peanuts too.

With my Sunday Dinner. I also remember thinking “if I got the same items from a restaurant. That would be like… 30 odd dollars for a large salad, a bowl of tomato soup and a couple of grilled cheeses). And I spent maybe 10 dollars on the ingredients.”

Edit: after writing this post I made myself a pretty big salad bowl with some croutons, cheddar, cherry tomatoes and a creamy vinaigrette ",1,1764643743.0,internetparents,1,1.0,False

“I don’t want something trendy. I want something my wife can wear with anything — today, next year, ten years.”

So I sent her a photo of this [Ballon Bleu](https://cartierwatchdupe.io/products/af-factory-ballon-bleu-watch-33mm-silver-case-silver-bracelet-multiple-dial-options) on the wrist.

She replied five minutes later:  
“Okay… that one just feels right.”

And that’s exactly it. This watch doesn’t shout. It *settles in*.  
Rounded case that melts into your wrist, silver dial with that soft wave texture, blue steel hands catching light just enough, sapphire crystal staying clear even after daily wear. Inside is a Swiss quartz movement — boring in the best way. You wear it, it works, no drama.

Classic tee? Works.  
Blazer? Works.  
Dinner date, office day, weekend coffee run? Still works.

Some watches try to be statements.  
This one just becomes yours.

If you’re into the idea that good design should disappear into your lifestyle, this is the kind of piece you don’t “style” — you just live in.

1pbwvai,https://www.reddit.com/r/advertising/comments/1pbwvai/advice_to_folks_who_got_laid_off/,Advice to folks who got laid off.,"Hey. Been there a few times. Never from an acronym, those I left on my own. But here are things I learned. 

File for unemployment now. It’s yours. No shame. It doesn’t cover all your needs but it helps. You can still be paid severance and file for unemployment. In most, if not all, states it does not count as work income when you submit. Also it takes two weeks to get it. File now 

Try to get your work laptop and tech. If it’s 3+ years old it’s worthless to them so it will be easy. If it’s less it’s still not worth a ton. They need you to send it back, wipe it and all that. It takes time so it’s often easier to get them to let you keep. Many places will do a remote wipe. If not you might need to send it to them to wipe and send back. Just ask. Can’t hurt. The one time I don’t get my laptop they gave me a couple extra grand to buy a new one. I basically said I’m fucked and need to do freelance and have no machine. Sometimes they have hearts. 

Don’t post bad shit about them on LinkedIn. They suck but you don’t want it to hurt your chances at a new gig. Also I don’t know why people post good things about them, other than maybe the team was awesome. 

Network. Email all the folks you know. Remake connections. Post about what happened on LinkedIn. 

For some being laid off feels shameful. It’s not, especially in our industry. 

You’ll hit lows. Know this. Talk to somebody. I had a family (wife and kid I was the bread winner for) each time. It fucking sucked. I hit the lows. But also I got time with my kid that a normal working person does not and in that way it was amazing. 

Find a hobby. You will go crazy scrolling LinkedIn and fishbowl all day. Give yourself the grace of me time. Get off screens. Go to a coffee shop. Find art, reading, cooking, craft beer making. All that stuff. 

Get help if you need it I posted this a bit earlier but please do. And a lot of the packages offer a couple free sessions. 

Use the FUCK out of any insurance you have left. Same with FSA. ESPECIALLY FSA, which I think you can lose.  HSA you shouldn’t. Buy glasses, go to the dentist, get that weird thing on your ass checked. Might as well while you’re covered. 

Be good to yourself. It’s not you. We chose an incredibly fucked up career path. I love it and I’ve been in it for 25+ years but it is completely fucked up. Truly not you. You thought you were working for an ad agency that cared. You were working for a public company that does not give a shit. 

Which brings me to my last. Awards a sexy shops don’t matter to your mental health. Check out smaller shops. Check out places you can make a difference. You might not win shiny awards but you can do good and do what you love, and maybe win shiny awards. Yes some small places are shit. But in my experience less of them are.

I recently took advantage of a Black Friday sale and picked up a KBT. Normally I use my Eureka Mignon Specialita to grind of a flair 58 espresso machine, or much more often for aeropress. I use medium beans. When I got the machine I turned down from the espresso grind to be a bit coarser, and brewed 3/4 liter with 48 grams of beans and the basket switch in the middle position and it took about five minutes from flipping the switch to finishing dripping. 

Honestly it wasn’t that great. I don’t know if the beans are amazing, but they had been better in the aeropress. I felt like the coffee was weak, not that bold, and just generally not great. Tomorrow I’m going to try going back to the finer grind, but I’m curious what folks have to say to troubleshoot this. I haven’t owned a drip coffee maker since the $20 one from the late 90s, and I was expecting the moccamaster to be a little more foolproof.

The pursuit of discrete pacification—without the stigmatism of unconventional business reputations—requires a more nuanced approach. This is why many, guided by Oval Rosado’s discreet connections, opt for the quiet comfort of an affordable, indescript lodging like a room at the Longhorn Hotel & Casino or the Mardi Gras off Paradise Rd.

Here, a more personal, economical, and comfortable introduction flourishes. A simple, discreet coffee date or a relaxed 1-on-1 wine sipping encounter allows mutual understanding to develop naturally, free from pretense. Whether the desired connection involves a dedicated Black personal trainer persona or a subservient male personal assistant role-play scenario, the foundation is comfort and mutual respect.

I’m hoping to get some advice on the value of a **first-generation Saddleback Leather suitcase** — the original **Old World / classic suitcase-style version** in **Coffee**. This is the early design that collectors still talk about, and it’s become pretty hard to find, especially in this condition.

# Condition

* **100% original**
* **Coffee color**
* **First-generation build** (thicker leather, older hardware style)
* **Still has the original leather tags**
* **Never used — genuinely perfect condition**
* Minimal scratches (I think), no patina, or marks since it’s been stored safely for years

I know these early-production Saddleback pieces have a bit of a cult following, and I’d love for this to go to someone who truly appreciates what it is — the quality, the craftsmanship, and the history of the brand’s early years.

# Why I’m selling

I’m only selling it to help fund my daughter’s college education. Otherwise I would absolutely keep it — this is one of those “forever items” you don’t see come up very often.

# What I’m looking for

* **Value** for a first-gen suitcase in this condition
* Whether recent sales of similar pieces exist
* Recommendations on **where to list** this so real collectors will see it (Reddit, Facebook groups, classifieds, leather communities, vintage luggage collectors, etc.)
* And of course, if anyone here is a Saddleback collector and wants to discuss — I’d be happy to chat.

Thanks in advance to anyone who can offer guidance. I’d love for this piece to end up with someone who will appreciate it as much as I did.

Of course as coffee ages, I tend to tweak anyway but I’m just curious how other people approach dialing in a new bag. Explore all aspects of a coffee before settling on a recipe or just dial in until you get a cup you enjoy and stop there?

I took her for coffee, dropped her home, and she asked me to text when I got back. When I did, I suggested we catch up again and she said she had fun and was keen.

But when I tried to plan something for the following weekend, she hit me with an “I’ll let you know”. Ijust left it at “that’s cool, talk soon.”

Now I’m stuck wondering what changed. Did I do something wrong? Was it just the sex? I’m used to women keeping consistent interest after a good date, so this one threw me off.

1pbwn0h,https://www.reddit.com/r/ODeals/comments/1pbwn0h/dont_waste_time_by_searching_after_meaning_of/,"dont waste time by searching after meaning of life, because here that is","Practical Explanation ( For Example ) :- \`1st of all can you tell me every single seconds detail from that time when you born ?? ( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Here is no Question of Holy Books quotes, Personal Experiences, Faith or Belief. i accept that Sometimes Faith is also Blind. Here is already Practical explanation which already proved that every\`1 else in this world is nothing more then Busy Foolish and totally idiot.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Source(s):

every \`1 is already Blind in this world and if you will follow another Blind then you both will fall in hole. so try to follow that person who have Spiritual Eyes who can Guide you on Actual Right Path. ( my Authority & Guide is my Spiritual Master "" Srila Prabhupada "" )

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

if you want to see Actual Purpose of human life then see this link : ( triple w ( d . o . t ) asitis ( d . o . t ) c . o . m  {Bookmark it })

read it complete. ( i promise only readers of this book that they { he/she } will get every single answer which they want to know about why im in this material world, who im, what will happen after this life, what is best thing which will make Human Life Perfect, and what is perfection of Human Life. ) purpose of human life is not to live like animal cuz every\`1 at present time doing 4 thing which are sleeping, eating, s.ex & fear. purpose of human life is to become freed from Birth after birth, Old Age, Disease, and Death.",0,1764642699.0,ODeals,0,0.5,False

1pbwllf,https://i.redd.it/ekuxuibfcp4g1.png,The Night I Got Outmaneuvered by a Dead Man and His Dog,"The Night I Got Outmaneuvered by a Dead Man and His Dog

Let me tell you something about being the CEO of a Fortune 500 company: it's basically like being God, except with slightly worse parking and significantly more lawyers. I run what I affectionately call a ""trillion-parameter operation""—not because we have a trillion parameters, but because I enjoy watching my underlings try to figure out if that's a real metric or if I'm just testing their willingness to nod along. Spoiler: I'm always testing their willingness to nod along.

My name is Bradley Winston Hartwell III, and yes, I am exactly as insufferable as that sounds. I've got a corner office that overlooks a smaller corner office that overlooks an even smaller corner office, like some kind of corporate matryoshka doll of diminishing importance. My desk is mahogany. My chair cost more than most cars. My business cards are made from a paper stock so thick they've been classified as a concealed weapon in three states.

It was a Thursday evening—7:47 PM, to be exact, because I remember these things—and I was doing what every visionary leader does after hours: refreshing my inbox while pretending to review quarterly projections. The projections were fine. They were always fine. ""Fine"" is what you call numbers when you've hired enough accountants to make them fine.

That's when I saw it.

Subject line: ""TML: The Missing Accountability Spine Your Model Pretends to Have.""

Now, I receive approximately four hundred emails per day, and roughly three hundred and ninety-seven of them are vendors trying to sell me things I don't need using words I don't understand. AI this, blockchain that, synergy the other thing. I've developed an immunity to buzzwords. My eyes glaze over faster than a Krispy Kreme donut the moment someone mentions ""paradigm shift.""

But this subject line was different.

It was rude.

It was implying that my model—MY model, the crown jewel of Hartwell Industries' AI initiative, the thing I personally took credit for during three separate earnings calls—was somehow... lacking. In spine. In accountability spine, specifically, which wasn't even a term I'd heard before, but I was already offended by it.

I clicked the email out of boredom and spite. These are my two primary motivators. Ask anyone.

The email contained a single link and a single sentence: ""Your AI makes decisions. TML makes those decisions provable. Choose wisely.""

I don't respond well to being told to choose wisely. The last person who told me to choose wisely was my second wife's divorce attorney, and look how that turned out. Spoiler: expensively.

So I clicked the link, ready to fire off a condescending reply about how we at Hartwell Industries don't need some acronym to tell us how to—

Within forty seconds, I was sweating like a man reading his own autopsy report.

---

The website that loaded was not what I expected. I expected the usual startup garbage: stock photos of diverse people pointing at whiteboards, testimonials from companies I'd never heard of, maybe a ""Schedule Your Demo"" button the size of a billboard. Instead, I got... documentation. Actual, readable documentation. The kind of documentation that suggests someone cared more about explaining their work than selling it.

This was my first red flag.

I scrolled down and encountered something called the ""Three Decision States.""

+1: Affirmation. Proceed with confidence when ethical values align.

0: Sacred Zero. Pause for reflection when moral complexity is detected.

-1: Moral Resistance. Object when significant ethical conflicts arise.

I stared at my screen. I read it again. Then I read it a third time, because I was convinced I was having a stroke.

A third state? Between yes and no? That wasn't how computers worked. That wasn't how anything worked. You either approve the acquisition or you don't. You either greenlight the product launch or you delay it until legal stops hyperventilating. There is no sacred middle ground in capitalism. The middle ground is for people who don't have quarterly targets.

But this ""Sacred Zero"" thing—this deliberate pause, this moment of computational hesitation—it was described not as a bug but as a feature. The AI was supposed to stop and say, ""Hold on, this is complicated, and I think a human should weigh in.""

My AI had never done that. My AI had the ethical consideration of a vending machine. You put in a request, something fell out, and if it happened to crush your foot, that was technically your problem for standing too close.

I kept reading.

""Sacred Pause: The moment between question and answer where wisdom begins.""

I laughed out loud. Wisdom! In AI! The AI my company deployed last quarter had confidently recommended firing our entire marketing department and replacing them with ""targeted vibrational frequency campaigns."" We did not do this, obviously, but only because someone in HR asked what a vibrational frequency campaign was, and no one could explain it without sounding like they'd joined a cult.

Then I hit the section on Moral Trace Logs.

This is where the sweating began in earnest.

Moral Trace Logs. Every decision the AI makes, logged. Every ethical consideration, recorded. Every moment where the system chose +1, 0, or -1, timestamped and stored with cryptographic immutability. The framework didn't just make decisions—it created an evidence trail. A paper trail, but worse, because paper can be shredded, and this couldn't.

My throat went dry.

I kept scrolling.

""No Log = No Action.""

The words stared back at me like a judge reading a sentencing statement. No log, no action. If the AI couldn't prove it had gone through proper ethical evaluation, it couldn't act. Period. Every decision required immutable proof that it had been made correctly. Every. Single. One.

I thought about all the decisions my AI had made without any logs whatsoever. I thought about the customer data we'd ""aggregated."" I thought about the ""personalization algorithms"" that were really just very sophisticated guessing engines with the moral compass of a Magic 8-Ball. I thought about what would happen if auditors could see everything.

Then I thought about what would happen if shareholders could see everything.

Then I poured myself a drink.

Then I poured myself another drink.

Then I kept reading, because apparently I hate myself.

""No Spy. No Weapon.""

Universal prohibitions. Hardcoded into the framework. You couldn't use TML for mass surveillance. You couldn't use it for weapons development. You couldn't use it for authoritarian control or discriminatory systems or anything that a reasonable person would describe as ""evil"" if they squinted hard enough.

This was insane. This was limiting. Half our government contracts were in a gray area that could generously be described as ""surveil-adjacent."" How were we supposed to compete if we couldn't do the questionable things our competitors were definitely also doing?

But it got worse.

Performance guarantees. Sacred Zero evaluation: ≤2ms at the 99th percentile. Full log completion: ≤500ms, including blockchain anchor. They'd actually done the engineering. This wasn't some academic framework that would crumble under real-world load. Someone had built this to work.

Merkle-batched anchoring. Proofs stored on public blockchains. Organizational claims independently verifiable. I didn't know what half these words meant, but I knew what ""independently verifiable"" meant, and it meant that our quarterly reports would need to start containing things like ""facts"" and ""accuracy.""

My hand was shaking. I put down my glass.

Then I reached the section on privacy and trade secrets, and for one brief, beautiful moment, I thought I'd found a loophole. GDPR-compliant erasure! Pseudonymization before hashing! Something called ERK—Ephemeral Key Rotation—where temporary keys vanished after verification!

But no. These weren't loopholes. These were features. The framework had been designed to protect legitimate privacy concerns while still maintaining accountability. It threaded the needle between transparency and confidentiality with the precision of someone who had thought about this problem for a very long time.

I hate people who think about problems for a very long time. They make the rest of us look bad.

---

At some point during my escalating panic, I did what any rational person would do: I googled the creator.

Lev Goukassian.

The name sounded Eastern European, or possibly like a type of cheese I'd pretended to enjoy at a charity gala. I clicked through to his profile expecting the usual tech bro narrative—Stanford dropout, garage startup, hoodie-based wardrobe, disruption this, disruption that.

Instead, I found something that made me sit back in my very expensive chair and stare at my ceiling.

Lev Goukassian had built this entire framework while dying.

Stage 4 cancer. Terminal diagnosis. And instead of doing what normal people do when facing their own mortality—writing memoirs, traveling to exotic locations, making dramatic speeches to estranged family members—this man had decided to create a comprehensive ethical framework for artificial intelligence. He'd looked at the existential void and said, ""Yes, but have you considered accountability mechanisms?""

I scrolled through his documentation. I read about his philosophy. I found a quote that hit me like a freight train:

""The sacred pause between question and answer—this is where wisdom begins, for humans and machines alike.""

He'd written that. While dying. While building a system more comprehensive than anything my R&D department had produced in five years with unlimited budgets and unlimited excuses.

And then—and this is the part where I questioned my entire career—I found out about Vinci.

Vinci the miniature Schnauzer.

According to everything I could find, this man had done his most important work with a small dog sitting next to him. A dog named after Leonardo da Vinci. A dog that, in that moment, I was forced to admit was probably more qualified than half my executive team, because at least the dog had been present for the creation of something genuinely meaningful.

I looked at the framed photos on my desk. My yacht. My third house. My awards for ""Excellence in Corporate Leadership,"" which is a phrase that means absolutely nothing.

I looked back at my screen.

A dying man with a Schnauzer had just outthought every AI lab on the planet.

---

I called the emergency board meeting for 9 PM. This was unusual. Board meetings are typically scheduled weeks in advance, involve catering decisions that cost more than some weddings, and require at least three preliminary meetings to decide what would be discussed in the actual meeting. An emergency board meeting at 9 PM on a Thursday suggested either that I was having a mental breakdown or that something genuinely important had happened.

Both were technically true.

The board members filed in with expressions ranging from ""concerned"" to ""annoyed"" to ""I was at my mistress's apartment and this had better be important."" Richard Vanderberg was still wearing golf clothes. Miriam Chen had clearly been in the middle of a spa treatment and still had what appeared to be seaweed on her neck. Gerald Thompson arrived six minutes late because Gerald Thompson has never arrived on time for anything in his life, including his own colonoscopy.

I stood at the head of the table. I had prepared a presentation. The presentation consisted entirely of screenshots from the TML documentation and my own handwritten notes, which had devolved into increasingly frantic scribbling by the end.

""Ladies and gentlemen,"" I began, ""we have a problem.""

""Is it the Chinese?"" Richard asked immediately. Richard asks if everything is the Chinese. Supply chain issues? Chinese. Server outages? Chinese. His golf handicap? Somehow, also Chinese.

""It's not the Chinese, Richard.""

""Then what is it?"" Miriam wiped seaweed from her neck with the dignity of a woman who had practiced maintaining composure in far worse situations.

I pulled up the first slide. The TML logo. The three decision states. The words ""Sacred Zero"" in large, unforgiving font.

""This,"" I said, ""is going to destroy us.""

There was a pause.

""Is that a mindfulness app?"" Gerald asked.

I stared at him. I stared at him for long enough that the silence became uncomfortable.

""Gerald,"" I said slowly, ""this is an ethical accountability framework for artificial intelligence. It creates immutable logs of every decision. It makes every AI action auditable, traceable, and—most importantly—contestable in a court of law.""

""Court-admissible evidence?"" Our legal counsel, Patricia Whitmore, sat up so fast she nearly spilled her mineral water. ""From an AI?""

""From our AI,"" I clarified. ""Hypothetically. If we were forced to implement this. Which we might be. Because this thing is spreading.""

I pulled up the next slide. Technical specifications. Dual-lane latency. Merkle-batched anchoring. Blockchain proof storage.

""Someone explain to me what any of this means,"" Richard demanded.

""It means,"" I said, ""that if TML becomes an industry standard, we can no longer hide behind 'proprietary architecture' when our AI does something questionable. We can no longer claim the model made decisions we didn't understand. We can no longer shrug and say 'algorithms are complicated' when regulators come knocking. Every decision will have a receipt.""

The room went very, very quiet.

""Does this apply to financial decisions?"" the CFO asked. His name was Martin. Martin was the kind of CFO who knew where every body was buried because he'd helped dig most of the graves. His voice had taken on a quality I'd never heard before. Fear.

""Every decision,"" I repeated.

Martin's face went the color of old oatmeal. I knew, in that moment, that he was thinking about The Numbers We Don't Talk About. Every company has Numbers We Don't Talk About. They're the numbers that make quarterly reports possible. They're the numbers that exist in a quantum state of being technically legal until someone looks at them too closely.

""If auditors can see everything,"" Martin said slowly, ""then—""

""Shareholders can see everything,"" I finished.

Patricia Whitmore stood up so fast her chair rolled backward and hit the wall. ""If this becomes mandatory,"" she said, her voice rising with each word, ""our entire quarterly bluff strategy is DEAD. Dead! Deceased! Buried in an unmarked grave next to our liability projections!""

""Calm down, Patricia—""

""I WILL NOT CALM DOWN, BRADLEY."" Patricia only used my first name when she was genuinely alarmed. ""Do you understand what 'court-admissible evidence' means? It means that every single time your precious AI makes a recommendation, there's a RECORD. A permanent, immutable, blockchain-verified RECORD. Do you know how many of our decisions would look in court? DO YOU?""

""Patricia, please—""

""WE CALLED IT 'AGGRESSIVE CUSTOMER ENGAGEMENT.' THE RECORD WOULD SAY 'PSYCHOLOGICAL MANIPULATION ENGINE.'""

I let her finish. Sometimes you just have to let people process.

When the screaming subsided, our CTO, Daniel Park, raised his hand. Daniel was the youngest person in the room by a significant margin, which meant he still believed problems could be solved through cleverness rather than bribery.

""I have a suggestion,"" he said.

""Go ahead, Daniel.""

""What if we just... rename TML and pretend we invented it?""

The room considered this. I could see the appeal. Corporate history is littered with innovations that were ""inspired by"" other innovations, which is a polite way of saying ""stolen with better branding.""

""We could call it the Hartwell Accountability Protocol,"" Daniel continued, warming to his idea. ""HAP. It's friendlier. Less threatening. We launch it as our own initiative, get ahead of the regulatory curve, and position ourselves as industry leaders in ethical AI.""

For a brief, shining moment, I felt hope.

Then Patricia laughed. It was not a happy laugh.

""Daniel,"" she said, in the tone of a woman explaining something to a particularly slow child, ""Lev Goukassian notarized everything. Timestamped everything. Cryptographically anchored his entire body of work. He created something called a 'Voluntary Succession Declaration' that eliminates the—"" she checked her notes, ""—'Bus Factor.' No single entity can ever own TML. No single person can ever control it. The man was dying of cancer and still found time to ensure that vultures like us couldn't pick his corpse clean.""

""But—""

""He out-lawyered us from beyond the grave, Daniel. While dying. With a Schnauzer.""

The room fell silent again.

Miriam, who had remained uncharacteristically quiet, finally spoke. ""So our options are...?""

""Implement TML and become accountable for everything we do,"" I said, ""or don't implement TML and watch our competitors become trustworthy while we remain... us.""

""Could we pivot to a different industry?"" Richard suggested. ""Something less complicated. Something without AI. Scented candles, perhaps.""

I wish I could tell you he was joking. Richard had made his fortune in textiles before transitioning to tech investment. In his heart, he longed for a simpler time when products were physical objects you could drop on your foot.

""We're not pivoting to scented candles, Richard.""

""Artisanal scented candles. The margins are excellent—""

""Richard.""

""Fine.""

---

The meeting devolved, as all emergency meetings eventually do, into a series of smaller arguments that accomplished nothing. Legal blamed Engineering. Engineering blamed Product. Product blamed Marketing. Marketing blamed the concept of accountability itself, which they described as ""fundamentally incompatible with brand positioning.""

Through it all, I kept returning to the same thought: This framework didn't just exist. It was complete. Production-ready. Someone had done the work—all of it—while facing the one deadline no one can negotiate with.

I thought about the decisions I'd made that year. The corners I'd cut. The ambiguities I'd exploited. The times I'd sat in this very boardroom and said things like ""Let's not document that"" and ""Keep this conversation offline"" and ""Technically, we're not required to disclose that.""

TML meant no more ""technically.""

TML meant no more plausible deniability.

TML meant that ""the model did it"" was no longer a defense, because the model's reasoning would be laid bare for anyone to examine.

I thought about our AI, sitting in its servers somewhere, making thousands of decisions per second without a single Sacred Zero between them. No pause. No reflection. No moment where it wondered if what it was doing was right. Just input, output, input, output, a machine gun of conclusions with all the ethical consideration of a slot machine.

And somewhere, on the other side of reality, a man with a terminal diagnosis had looked at that same problem and said: ""What if the machine knew when to stop?""



The meeting ended at 1:34 AM. One by one, the board members shuffled out, each carrying their own private terror about what TML meant for their particular domain of corporate mischief. Richard was already googling candle manufacturers. Patricia was muttering about liability exposure. Martin had the expression of a man calculating how long he had before the bodies started surfacing.

I stayed behind.

The conference room was quiet now, lit only by the emergency exit signs and the faint glow of the city through the windows. I pulled up the TML documentation on the room's main screen and read it again. All of it. From the philosophical foundations to the technical specifications to the ethical safeguards.

I read about Aristotelian phronesis—practical wisdom—and how it had been encoded into the decision-making process. I read about Buddhist mindfulness and the concept of skillful means. I read about Care Ethics and relational morality. Someone had taken two thousand years of human philosophical thought and compressed it into a computational framework.

Someone had done the homework.

I thought about my own AI project. I thought about the kickoff meeting, where we'd discussed ""ethics"" for approximately eleven minutes before someone pointed out we were running behind schedule. I thought about the deployment, where we'd skipped the bias testing because the product team wanted to hit their quarterly numbers. I thought about all the emails I'd received since then, flagging ""anomalous outputs"" and ""unexpected recommendations,"" emails I'd forwarded to Legal with a note that said ""handle this quietly.""

TML didn't allow for ""handle this quietly."" TML demanded that everything be handled loudly, publicly, and with receipts.

I found myself laughing. It wasn't a sane laugh. It was the laugh of a man who has just realized he's been outmaneuvered by someone who was supposed to be too busy dying to compete.

And then—this is the part I've never told anyone—I found myself crying.

Not for me. Not for the company. For the sheer, ridiculous beauty of what Lev Goukassian had done. He'd known he was running out of time, and instead of spending it on himself, he'd spent it building something that would make machines hesitate. That would make them pause. That would make them, in some small way, wise.

""The sacred pause between question and answer—this is where wisdom begins.""

I'd spent my entire career eliminating pauses. Accelerating decisions. Reducing the time between question and answer to microseconds because speed was money and money was the only metric that mattered. And here was a man who had looked at that whole philosophy and said, ""No. The pause is where wisdom begins.""

The audacity of it. The sheer, magnificent audacity.

---

I went back to my office around 3 AM. The building was empty except for the cleaning staff, who had learned long ago not to make eye contact with executives wandering the halls at strange hours.

I sat in my mahogany chair. I looked at my expensive art. I looked at my awards. I looked at my desk, with its leather blotter and its silver pen set and its framed photo of me shaking hands with a former president.

None of it meant anything.

Everything I'd built, every acquisition I'd closed, every competitor I'd crushed—none of it would last. None of it was true. It was all just... noise. Sound and fury, signifying quarterly earnings.

But TML would last. TML was built to survive its creator. It had succession plans and memorial funds and governance structures designed to persist long after every person currently involved was gone. It was architecture for eternity, built by a man who knew he didn't have much time left.

I pulled up my email. I found the original message that had started all of this.

""Your AI makes decisions. TML makes those decisions provable. Choose wisely.""

I hit reply.

I typed: ""Who are you?""

I hit send.

I didn't expect a response.

---

At 3:47 AM, I fell asleep at my desk. This was not unusual. What was unusual was the dream.

I was standing in a field. The kind of generic, pastoral field that appears in dreams when your subconscious can't be bothered with detailed set design. And walking toward me, across the grass, was a miniature Schnauzer.

The Schnauzer was wearing a tiny badge. The badge said ""AUDITOR.""

""Hello, Bradley,"" the dog said.

""Dogs can't talk,"" I pointed out.

""And CEOs can't claim ignorance when the logs exist,"" the dog replied. ""Yet here we are.""

I wanted to argue, but I couldn't think of a counterpoint. The Schnauzer sat down in front of me, its tiny audit badge catching the light.

""You're Vinci,"" I said.

""I am.""

""You're the dog that sat with him. While he built it.""

""I was."" The dog tilted its head. ""He worked very hard, you know. Even when he was tired. Even when he was scared. He believed it mattered.""

""It does matter,"" I heard myself say. ""I hate that it matters, but it does.""

""That's the first honest thing you've said all day.""

I stood there in the dream-field, being judged by a small dog with an audit badge, and I realized something I should have realized years ago: the question was never whether I was smart enough to avoid accountability. The question was whether I was brave enough to embrace it.

""What do I do now?"" I asked.

Vinci looked at me with the patient expression of a being who had seen all of human folly and decided to love humanity anyway.

""Even CEOs get logged,"" the dog said. ""The question is whether your logs tell a story you can be proud of.""

I woke up with a start. The sun was coming through my office windows. My assistant was standing in the doorway with coffee and a concerned expression.

""Sir? Are you alright? You've been here all night.""

I looked at her. I looked at my computer, still open to the TML documentation. I looked out the window at the city below, full of buildings housing companies just like mine, all of them trying to move fast and break things without ever stopping to ask what they were breaking.

""Schedule a meeting,"" I said.

""With whom, sir?""

I thought about it. I thought about the fear in the boardroom. I thought about Patricia's panic and Martin's calculations and Richard's desperate pivot to candles. I thought about all the ways we could fight this, resist this, try to outmaneuver a framework built by a dying man with more integrity in his final months than I'd shown in my entire career.

""Everyone,"" I said. ""Schedule a meeting with everyone. And title it—"" I paused, feeling the weight of the words, ""—'The Sacred Zero: Why We Need to Learn to Pause.'""

My assistant wrote it down without comment. She'd been with me for twelve years. She'd learned not to ask questions.

After she left, I turned back to my computer. I found the section of the documentation about the Memorial Fund—the Lev Goukassian Memorial Fund for Ethical AI Research, with its fifty to one hundred million dollar endowment goal, its annual grants, its fellowship programs, its commitment to perpetual ethical oversight.

A dying man had planned for eternity. Had built something that would outlast him. Had trusted that the world would eventually catch up to what he'd created.

And here I was, Bradley Winston Hartwell III, with all my money and all my power and all my carefully cultivated reputation, finally catching up.

""Who are you, Lev Goukassian?"" I whispered to my empty office.

The answer, I realized, was in the work itself. He was someone who believed that machines could learn wisdom. That hesitation could be a virtue. That the space between question and answer—the sacred pause—was where everything important happened.

He was someone who had looked at the relentless forward march of technology and said: ""But what if we stopped, just for a moment, to think?""

I closed my laptop.

I had a lot of thinking to do.

---

Three months later, Hartwell Industries became the first Fortune 500 company to voluntarily implement Ternary Moral Logic across all AI systems. The announcement sent our stock price tumbling for exactly one week, after which it rose to the highest point in company history. It turned out that investors liked accountability almost as much as they liked returns.

Patricia eventually stopped screaming. Martin is still adjusting to the existence of logs, but he's getting therapy. Richard started a scented candle side business, which is actually doing quite well.

And every night, before I leave the office, I pause at my door and look at the small framed photo I've added to my collection.

It's a picture of a miniature Schnauzer.

The caption reads: ""Even CEOs get logged.""

It's the most honest thing in the room.



## AUTHOR'S NOTE

This story was written as a commissioned satirical work based on the Ternary Moral Logic (TML) framework created by Lev Goukassian. The characters, corporations, and boardroom meltdowns depicted herein are entirely fictional—though if any Fortune 500 CEOs feel personally attacked, that's probably worth examining.

The technical elements of TML referenced throughout—the Sacred Zero, Moral Trace Logs, the three decision states, blockchain anchoring, and the framework's ethical prohibitions—are drawn from actual documentation. The philosophy is real. The architecture is real. The miniature Schnauzer named Vinci is very much real.

What's also real is that someone facing a terminal diagnosis chose to spend their remaining time building accountability into artificial intelligence rather than accepting the industry's comfortable opacity. This story is satire, yes, but it's satire in service of a serious point: the people most afraid of transparency are usually the ones who need it most.

Bradley Winston Hartwell III doesn't exist. But the fear of accountability he represents? That's everywhere.

1pbwigm,https://www.reddit.com/r/RelationshipIndia/comments/1pbwigm/25f_24m_i_stayed_in_an_abusive_relationship/,"25F, 24M. I stayed in an abusive relationship solely because of the fantasy version of him my younger self made up in her head. Need some advice on forgiving myself","
HISTORY:

I had a secret crush on him from 2018–2020. We were classmates but barely spoke in real life; we weren’t close at all. I built a fantasy version of him in my head because he was one of the first boys I texted after getting a phone. He didn’t even know I liked him. It was pure projection, not based on anything real. He dated someone else in 2020 and I moved on.

RELATIONSHIP:

We reconnected in June 2023. I admitted my past feelings with no intention to date, but he flirted, made me believe we were exclusive, and we started something. He secretly cheated with his “girl best friend” from June 2023 to May 2024. From June 2024 to June 2025 he disrespected me constantly. Things were briefly calm in July–August. After he left for his master’s, secrecy about new female friends broke trust again. October was nonstop disrespect, and I ended it.

He came back in early November (right before his exams), promised change, behaved well for one month, then went straight back to being dismissive and hurtful once his exams ended. This was pure selfishness and ego games. I left for good. After that, even a polite reply from me made him accuse me of wanting him back and telling me to leave him alone—zero accountability. Any remaining respect I had for him died then. What the hell was that. Pretty sure he'd date around for fun at his masters program due to the prior secrecy about female friends, I dodged a bullet. 

REGRET:

I regret not leaving sooner. In mid-2023 he sent disturbing content that scared me. In August 2023 when I had no idea he was cheating on me with his girl bestfriend and he said ""I will not be ok if you ask me to stop talking to my girl bestfriend"", and even made comments about harming my cat. 

OTHER RED FLAGS:

Moreover. His guy bestfriend supported him cheating - instead of correcting him or informing me, and also tried to ruin my first relationship by flirting when I requested him not to flirt. His guy bestfriend's then-girlfriend commented rude things on my post back in 2020 that took me a lot of effort. His girl bestfriend asked him to date her instead knowing that we were dating. His friends supported the cheating, and his circle has always lacked basic decency — which I ignored. I need to mindful of who I date and if their circle has quality people. 

He was extremely rude. When he got angry, he would punch chairs and break furniture. (His own words). I was honestly grateful that our relationship was long-distance, because if this had been in person, I would have feared potential violence. He once told me he threw his phone against a wall after his first ex cheated, purely out of rage, stating that's how men deal with anger. I don't think that's true. Hearing that terrified me. I treat my belongings gently and carefully, so stories like that genuinely scare me. During many arguments, I found myself relieved that we were not physically together, because I felt he wouldn’t be able to control his behavior in person. I knew I had love for him, but the fear was stronger and kept those feelings suppressed, because it was long distance. The distance meant I never had to witness his anger face to face, which honestly made it emotionally safer for me. 

THE IN-PERSON DATE WHICH SHOULD'VE GIVEN ME THE ICK:

I met him in person once. It was like meeting a cow in real life. He was walking ahead of me, didn't open doors or pull chairs, had zero chivalry, and seemed so nonchalant. I felt like I forced him to meet although he was the one who asked me to meet. He was basically cheating on me with his girl bestfriend, she texted him during the date. In recent times I had questioned him, and he said ""I don't know how to treat a girl in person"". Not something I expected from a grown man. He didn't put any effort into impressing me or whatsoever. So I don't understand why I even liked him? I'm sure another girl reading this last paragraph would probably laugh and spit her coffee. If I didn't like him in 2018-2020, I would've broken up after this 2024 in-person date. I stayed because, fantasy.

WHY I STAYED:

What kept me stuck was clinging to what my 18-year-old self dreamed of: dating the fantasy version of him. The reality was a manipulative, selfish person not suited for a relationship at all. 


TLDR: 

Stayed in an abusive relationship in 2023, 2024 and 2025, the guy cheated for a year, disrespected me every 2 weeks, secrecy about female friends, blaming and gaslighting that I'm the problem, etc. ,,, because of the fantasy version of him my younger self (2018-2020) made up in her head, I was crushing on him from 2018-2020 and he didn't know. The reality was a manipulative, selfish person not suited for a relationship at all.

My hair turns grey, my face grows wise, i still think about you. 
Flowers on a stone, a grief that is shared, i think about you. 
Once we were whole, now one less, and i think about you. 
The last breath drawn, a dream fulfilled, i only think about you. 
Long have i lived, many roads traveled. With every step taken, i never stopped thinking about you. ",9,1764642338.0,UnsentTexts,3,1.0,False

QNet recruiters are actively targeting students, job seekers, and people going through tough times. They approach you through Instagram, Boo, LinkedIn, or random mutuals, act friendly, and then pitch a “start-up/business opportunity” without ever revealing the company name.

Once you trust them, they push you to “invest” ₹1–3 lakhs by taking loans, asking family, or using credit cards — only later you realise the money was used to buy overpriced products you never even needed.

They use emotional manipulation, fake motivation, secrecy, and guilt to trap you.

And recently, these guys are also sitting in mall cafés and popular coffee shops, pretending they’re earning big. They talk loudly about “hustle, dreams, passive income, making crores” just to make people around them notice and approach them. It’s all part of the trap. 🥴🤢😮‍💨

Please be alert:

If someone avoids revealing the company name — red flag

If they ask you to “believe first, understand later” — red flag

If they push loans or say “big opportunity” — RUN

If they say “don’t tell family or friends” — it’s a scam


Many people in Hyderabad, Vizag, Vijayawada and Bengaluru are getting trapped. Don’t let it be you.

Stay safe, Hyderabad. ✋",10,1764642318.0,hyderabad,3,0.92,False
