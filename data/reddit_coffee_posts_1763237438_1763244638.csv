1oy4ctf,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1oy4ctf,Patio help — what changes would you make?,"I’ve wanted to spruce up our patio since we purchased our home in 2022, but haven’t gotten around to anything substantial. For background, we live in Houston—it’s pretty hot/muggy most of the year. My history of keeping plants alive is…not great, though I do love them. We don’t have a backyard, just this patio, so our small dog goes to the bathroom on the patio gravel. Our patio is still nice to relax on, and we use it somewhat regularly with a toddler. 

We used to have a giant umbrella which has since broke. Maybe we do a small breakfast table with an umbrella, for coffee etc. I’ve always wanted a hammock. 

Anyways, just curious if anybody has any recommendations or other thoughts. I have a friend who is a landscaped architect. He drew up some plans, to the tune of 10-15k. I’m willing to spend a few thousand dollars to change it up, but we’ve had a few other house projects to tend to, so just curious to see if anybody here has any thoughts.",1,1763244424.0,HomeDecorating,0,1.0,False
1oy4ct3,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1oy4ct3,Fungus gnat explosion day 12.,"I had seen maybe one or two of these gnats since July and was finally free until my boss gave me a new plant 2 wks ago. I noticed a few gnats the next two days, but by day 3/4 - I am not exaggerating - there were hundreds. I’ve had them in the past, but NEVER this bad or had them spread this fast. I treated all 50+ plants soil with hydrogen peroxide solution two days ago, but it seems there are additional hundreds every day, and the peroxide killed my favorite coffee plant. Anyway, they’re already in every. damn. plant. I’m using plant bulbs to water, but the diatomaceous earth on top of the soil still turns damp after a while. Does the potato trick really work/what other methods am I missing??? I tried letting them all dry out this the point of losing leaves, and have yellow sticky traps everywhere. The pic of my hand is from me standing in the window for under a minute, that’s it. I clean my windows daily and they’re smeared and covered in massacred gnats again by the end of the day.

1oy4chv,https://www.reddit.com/r/teenagers/comments/1oy4chv/i_tried_cigarettes/,I tried cigarettes,"Before I begin: don't recreate, smoking kills lol. 

Anyway, recently me and two of my closest friends (15m) managed to obtain some cigarettes and being curious decided to try them. Well aware of the risks and deciding that we don't have to do this if we don't want to (peer pressuring is evil), one of us passed on the smokes. 

I was really curious though about the taste and all so i tried. First with some bum puffs, just to be cautious and all, and smoking for the first time and all the warnings did get me kinda nervous.

I would describe the taste like a mix of old coffee and burnt gingerbread cookies, so not very good. When I tried inhaling, I coughed from the uncomfortable feeling of smoke in my lungs and threw the cig in the snow. 

Conclusion: We did look tough as hell smoking in the dark, but it tastes like shit + is very unhealthy. Wouldn't recommend trying.

She had been physically and verbally abusive ever since my dad passed. She would often flip on me and sometimes for no reason at all. Her boyfriend is no better, though he never physically assaulted me he would often call me a leech and just a mouth to feed.

My last straw was when my mom threw hot coffee at me. It literally burned me and I needed space so I stayed at a motel that my friend’s dad paid for and some stranger’s. Eventually reached out to my aunt and she flew and picked me up.

I flew back home when my aunt broke the news that my mom took her own life. She couldn’t afford to join me so I have to go on my own. When I arrived, everyone’s eyes were on me. I feel like I am being blamed for everything. 

Been staying at a park for 2 days now since my flight back to my aunt’s place wont be for another 3 days. I don’t feel welcome at my late mom’s boyfriend’s apartment. I’m genuinely scared and I have to lie to my aunt where I’m staying because I know for a fact that I’ve been a burden to her financially with all the recent events that happened.

Any tips on how to stay safe on the streets for a few days? Where can I get free food? Where can I charge for free? I used up all the mcdonalds freebies that I could get and I need to know if there’s any other app that i could download for free food?

1oy48c7,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_TanteJu5/comments/1oy48c7/tariffs_trumps_flamethrower/,Tariffs: Trump's flamethrower,"In a significant policy shift, the US president Donald Trump has announced the rollback of tariffs on over 200 food products, including everyday staples like coffee, beef, bananas and orange juice, effective retroactively from midnight on Thursday. This move comes as part of broader framework trade deals with countries such as Argentina, Ecuador, Guatemala and El Salvador, aimed at securing more reciprocal terms in bilateral trade relationships. Trump acknowledged that tariffs may in some cases raise prices but maintained that the US currently experiences virtually no inflation, which is a lie. 

According to the US Bureau of Labor Statistics, Year-over-year CPI inflation was 3.0%, up from 2.9% in August. This is well above the Federal Reserve's 2% target. Inflation has been ticking up since April 2025 (when it was 2.4%) coinciding with his initial tariff implementations under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA). Food-at-home prices alone rose 2.7% year-over-year in September.

https://preview.redd.it/kma56cqzth1g1.png?width=731&format=png&auto=webp&s=32ec6b3cf9d6c73e9bf6c47df72ed43a3a7ce61d

The exemptions target items not domestically grown or processed in the US, covering not just foods but also related inputs like chemicals for production, fertilizers, and even communion wafers. This decision reflects a pragmatic response to mounting consumer frustrations over grocery costs, which have surged amid persistent inflationary pressures.

The specific products affected by these tariff cuts include a wide array of imported goods that American households rely on, many of which have seen sharp price hikes in recent months. Ground beef prices, for instance, are up 13% year-over-year, steaks have risen 17% (the largest increases in over 3 years) despite the US being a major beef producer hampered by a cattle shortage. Bananas have climbed 7%, tomatoes 1% and overall food consumed at home 2.7%. Other items like acai berries, paprika, cocoa and oranges are also included, addressing double-digit increases in categories that hit lower- and middle-income families hardest. 

Economists have long attributed these elevations partly to Trump's broader trade war, which imposed a 10% base tariff on imports from every country alongside targeted duties, prompting companies to pass costs onto consumers. The administration's White House fact sheet emphasizes that these exemptions stem from 9framework deals, 2 final reciprocal trade agreements, and 2 investment pacts, signaling a targeted easing rather than a wholesale retreat from protectionist policies.

The father and I have not been getting along since we found out and he is currently been staying away for the last week. 

I am facing down the fact that I might be going through this alone. Every day I am angry and very sad. I feel extremely alone and unheard. I have looked for mom groups in town for some sort of support but I have yet to fully come out with the news to everyone. The chances that my news will come out to everyone in my smaller town is very likely if I reach out to mom groups. The father hasn’t told anyone about the pregnancy and I don’t really want to ruin that for him (if he cares.) 

I also want to wait to come out with the news till I’m further along but I’d love support in the mean time. I don’t have many friends and the ones I did tell, they are supportive but I just need a face to face coffee with someone who will hear me and most of them are out of town. 

Does anyone have any advice on what they did for support or what they did to distract their mind from stress. Ever since finding out my body has been over stressed and I feel bad for the baby.

1oy4774,https://www.reddit.com/r/valzubiriagenda/comments/1oy4774/what_is_valzubiriagenda_and_some_ideas_and/,What is #VALZUBIRIAGENDA and some ideas and insights,"# The 3 basic parameters of hashtag #Valzubiriagenda:

1. **We artists and everyone else can write and self-publish art- and artist-related books: memoirs, biographies, art books and art catalogs.** Books are forever. Pamphlets and brochures are not books.
2. **We announce a schedule of increasing prices of our art pieces,** which includes quantities (scarcity numbers) per price point and overall (the total quantity of art pieces we might ever make). This helps art traders, art investors and art collectors speculate or even stop speculating and instead join a community of investors working together to hopefully skyrocket to the higher announced prices in a shorter span of time.
3. **We can use the NFT world, because NFTs provide the tracking (who owns what) and trading.**

We can also not be involved with NFTs. Stores and individuals can help sell art using online presence and our catalogs in the stores. If this trends, or once this trends, even expensive art can be sold by neighboring businesses, without exclusivity. Commission systems do not have to be standardized. Art investors can produce their own catalogs to leave at the cafés. Even the cafés can produce their own catalogs.

**Valzubiriagenda NFTs**

**NFTs only came about a few years ago.** But I had been working on this since the 1990s. I wrote a book, **Valzubiriagenda**, along with fellow artist **Silverio Perez,** and released it in 2018 (Amazon and elsewhere), tackling everything related to #1 & #2. We'll come up with #3 in a later book/ memoir/ marketing book.

Any artist, including tangible artists can release 10,000 NFTs if the artist chooses to do so. For tangible artists, the NFT first becomes an Art Commission Contract for sight unseen, yet-to-be made art. Once the art is made, the NFT becomes proof of ownership that the actual, tangible art is theirs.

**Warehousing our tangible art**

Another related idea is that the tangible art may be warehoused by the artist so that the NFT traders continue to trade. This means that even 10-ton 10-foot tall sculptures can be owned and traded by anyone without worrying about shipping, reshipping, scratches, smudges, parts breaking off, etc. The newness of the pieces remain because they are stored by the artist, source, gallery, etc. The art piece gets shipped to the art collector, the ultimate owner.

An artist who makes ceramic coffee mugs - smaller art pieces, can release 10,000 NFTs with a schedule of increasing prices so that NFT traders can trade immediately. The 10,000 coffee mugs can get damaged, so as they are made, they continue to be stored by the artist, until the time when art collectors decide to have the art pieces shipped to them.

**Why only now?**

I decided to write as many book-length memoirs as I can before I came out to promote this.

I'm an artist and an author. Both need time to ""master."" I would not even fully use ""master"" on myself, because there's always something new, even to my own art, my own writing and publishing.

>*I am now claiming that I'm the visual artist who has produced the most artist memoirs in the world.* I have 5 on Amazon. I count **Valzubiriagenda** as both a marketing book and a memoir-of-sorts, because it has a lot of my own life lessons on writing and publishing. I would not care to contest my claim of having the most memoirs. I will release 5 more over the next 3 years.

**BARTER! Get help to write, photograph art and publish your books!**

Anyone can hire 11 ghostwriters for 11 memoirs. If you can make art, but you cannot write, then barter your forever art with those who can help you produce forever books.

I don't feel the pressure of writing and publishing because I feel my focus should be on art students and art experts who would study my art and my books 100 years from now. Don't expect relatives and friends to read your books.

**I call myself the Dollman**

For my NFTs, I am proposing to make dioramas - my original, costumed, bejeweled porcelain dolls in backdrops that will also have precious metals and gemstones. This way I can incorporate precious metals and gemstones in my work, to make sure that people perceive my art as expensive, just in case I myself don't become ""famous"" - there's no need to get world famous. We are artists and all we need to do is to satisfy the art niche.

**Use your laptop now!**

I will encourage you to start writing your book-length memoir. Write, Edit and then Self-publish it. Get help. Why wait a hundred years for someone to write about you when all you need is a laptop and a nearby coffee shop.

Don't start counting chickens before the eggs hatch. I have encountered a lot of would-be writers who immediately see themselves as bestselling. world famous assets to society. Two even wanted me to sign NDAs (Nondisclosure agreements), because they did not want me to steal their book ideas.

Here's a suggestion. I would not personally do it. From one manuscript can come 2 books: The Original Draft (unedited, with misspellings, considered to be an art piece, scanned pages(?) of your handwritten original effort), and The Final Edition (edited).

**PROVENANCE!**

Another way to enhance our investability, tradability and collectability is **PROVENANCE** ***- how art ownership proceeds through time.*** The way this can be done is also through publishing books. Everyone can write their memoirs, biographies, art books and art catalogs, including traders, investors and art collectors. In effect, we artists can continue to be included or mentioned in even more books, without any additional effort by us.

You as an investor, reseller, trader, art collector should be able to publish a catalog with 250 works by 250 different artists, but they need to agree to this right from the start - it's your money, you should require them to follow your version of the hashtag ***#valzubiriagenda*** *parameters,* which preferably should include permission for you to publish their art. Why would you track down 250 artists later?

**No exclusive contracts**

If you're a café, you can call for artists, and come up with a book with for example, 30 artists, with a chapter devoted to each artist's profile and images of the artist's art.

You can distribute your catalogs to businesses and individuals near and far and online.

The book **Valzubiriagenda** even cites that funeral homes and janitors closets can sell art, with or without exclusivity. Airline catalogs can include million dollar art pieces. Car manufacturers, showrooms and even car repair shops can sell art as well. Everyone should be able to do this, anywhere in the world, especially not just because of the pandemic, but right now, we are in really bad economies.

**What's with the name #Valzubiriagenda**

I was into conspiracy theories in 2018, and this term, *""The Mandela Effect,""* was popular. I had read many times that an artist coined the term, but I had to research online, for her name, many times, before remembering it. I'm not good at remembering names. It took me a year and a half to finally tell you that **Fiona Broome** coined ""The Mandela Effect.""

I also thought I might have to research trademarks and copyrights just to come up with a generic name. So I decided on **""Valzubiriagenda.""** I was not really sure at first, but I decided to use it as the title for my book (with co-author/artist **Silverio Perez**) so that there would be no turning back and I can move on.

**Am I a FUTURIST?**

Someone I recently met this May 2022 just called me a futurist.

In the 1990s, I proposed to a pension fund that they can raise billions of dollars, especially for emergencies, or as needed, or out of desperation, if the pension fund purchases a quantity of art from an artist who not only has a current, reasonable price, but an announced future price that the artist wants to reach.

That future price would obviously be higher than the current price. The art commission contract for multiple art pieces can be taken to the fund's financial lender for a loan. The higher future price can be used for financing purposes.

The pension fund's treasurer, a publicly elected official, said this idea might work, but we had to keep this a secret and discuss this some more, because other pension funds might copy and do this prematurely. This idea had to come from the two of us. The treasurer needed his votes and I needed credentials.

Added into the pot was my idea that I, as the artist, will also write one book-length artist memoir. This was and still is a strong factor, because the leadership and marketing books I had read then mentioned a strong tip. If you want to advance in your field, write a full-length book that is related to the field.

Unfortunately, the elected official, the treasurer of the pension fund, who was also a friend, passed away - he was old and had ailments. At that point in time, I cannot just approach another pension fund treasurer to share this idea with.

I realized I had to write a few memoirs. I needed to set an example for other artists, so I needed to write more than one memoir. Then I felt I should also make ready another book - the how-to of what I'm up to. I wrote **Valzubiriagenda**, which was a memoir of sorts. I knew how long it would take me to write a book, so I had to make sure I can also consider this book a memoir.

In 2008, I imagined that someone like Bernie Madoff, or a fund like Lehman Brothers, would be desperate enough to use this to save themselves and their companies. I was not ready. I had only written 1 manuscript for a memoir.

In 2012, I released **Dollman the Musical, A Memoir of an Artist as a Dollmaker**. Once again, I was not ready because writing it depressed me a little, and I knew I had to write more.

In 2014, I released 3 memoirs, and re-released **Dollman the Musical.** Besides releasing regular books, I released special editions of the 4 books, which had a **""Special Secret Insert for Bankers,""** which explains my ideas of an announced schedule of exponentially increasing prices, to satisfy investors, and the publication of artist memoirs, to satisfy art collectors.

In 2014, I also issued out a press release. Google ***""Can Billion Dollar Artist Save Investors and World Economy Valentino Zubiri PRWeb August 19 2014""*** and you will see the press release.

What I did was stake a claim on my ideas. I did not promote my books and the press release. I just wanted them to stay online, like a sleeping giant or a dormant volcano. I even designed 3 of the book covers to look like indie books from the 1980s. I was planting the seeds, thinking they will eventually grow and bear fruit in the future.

In 2015, I was interviewed by **Richard Syrett,** about one of my memoirs, **Hocus Pocus Lately.** This book is my memoir with paranormal stories. I could have pursued promoting my paranormal stories, but I wanted to be known first as a visual artist and memoirist, so I allowed myself one interview related to **Hocus Pocus Lately. Richard Syrett** has(had?) his own syndicated radio show, **The Conspiracy Show with Richard Syrett,** about the paranormal. He also guest hosts on **Coast to Coast AM**, another internationally syndicated show about the paranormal.

In 2018, I released **Valzubiriagenda** (co-authored by artist **Silverio Perez,** a fellow artist). Finally, this book is ""the how-to of what I'm to.""

I'm going to end this with some strangeness. In 1986, a lady at a religious gathering went into a trance and left a good number of messages. Supposedly, anyone who got into a trance would have messages, but once the trance was over, the person would not remember what was said.

I was not part of the group, but the lady turned her head to face me. She ""foretold"" that whatever I would decide to do in the future, it will take time, but it will be the right thing. This is one of my stories in one of my memoirs, **Hocus Pocus Lately.**

**The Tulipmania of 1634-37**

I discovered that there was this incident of rare tulips becoming collectible during the Dutch Golden Age. There were tulips so rare and so well-desired that their prices equaled to that of a house. You can read more about this online (Wikipedia) or watch a few YouTube videos about it.

Here is the most useful idea that I gleaned from the Tulipmania. The tulip bulbs remained safe inside nurseries. The traders were carrying the deeds of ownership to the tulip bulbs.

**Then NFTs came to the forefront**

I started learning PHP, an HTML scripting language, and MySQL, the database that PHP can connect to in the background, in 1999, when there were only 3 books about PHP and MySQL at the bookstores.

By 2014, I was trying to figure out how to make the ""ledger,"" or database that can be used to update ownership and who can be contacted. If we are trading art, then the art ownership should be updated.

Then NFTs came about. This can be used as our ledger. Everyone can immediately trade NFTs of future, yet-to-be made art pieces, especially because it takes time to make tangible art.

NFTs actually went a step ahead, by allowing digital art to be traded.

The only setback with NFTs, in my opinion, is that it still lacks a commission system for resellers and representatives.

For example, if a café wants to represent me, then they can promote me at their café and on their online pages. If I make one piece of art that will be exclusively represented by a gallery, then that commission will be different and more specific. As ownership is transferred, the subsequent owners should be able to reset the commission. We should also have the option of giving commissions to hundreds of representatives at one time with different percentages if need be.

**The recent crypto crash**

Lately, we have observed that NFTs and cryptocurrencies have been behaving like the stock market and other markets. They have been fluctuating.

I believe that it is time for a trend which discourages fluctuation of prices.

I have also seen YouTube videos where social influencers are encouraging us to be on the lookout for exponentially profitable ventures, because we have all seen this happen with the exponential increase of Bitcoin and Ethereum.

**Let's see if #Valzubiriagenda trends**

We can announce present and future art prices. The galleries won't do this (yet?) because they follow a more traditional approach to the business of art.

*We have a choice of using* ***incrementally*** *or* ***exponentially*** *increasing prices.* We still reserve the right to change things in the future, so everyone should know to follow the latest update.

If this trends, if you as an artist simply announces that you will write an artist memoir, or that you will include the future works in future art books, you might have more art traders, investors and collectors approaching you.

**Get your pen, paper and calculator**

Imagine yourself as an artist, where you are right now. Let's just say you still do not have a book about yourself and your art yet. Imagine now that you have a memoir out there. Don't you think it makes sense to charge more than what you are charging now? Writing and publishing books is just the beginning. I'm just standardizing this approach. The books also say to do other related projects. In my case, getting **Dollman the Musical** onstage is one idea. You will have other related projects, but the publication of memoirs, biographies, art books and art catalogs will help all of us.

You can also imagine that a law firm that has meeting rooms, with someone who wants to form a local #valzubiriagenda group, can have meetings. A local café can do the same. Local photographers for your art, writers, editors, book designers, proofreaders and others can join in.

I suggest have printed books to share. 15 copies of your memoir or art books will be better than an e-reader or laptop or your phone to show. These gadgets can be stolen, sabotaged, broken, have coffee spilled on them, etc. 15 printed books means simultaneously showing to 15 people. You can even give them away to potential resellers, investors, traders and collectors.

**When it rains, it pours, as in the days of Noah**

There's a saying, ""When it rains, it pours."" There is a negative interpretation and a positive interpretation.

*Negative:* When trouble comes, they cascade to even more.

***Positive:*** When opportunity comes knocking, more follow suit. We can assume that if one gets our art because of #valzubiriagenda, more want to do it now, because of the rising prices, and FOMO - fear of missing out. What will they lose if they miss the boat?

As I have said earlier, if the #valzubiriagenda trends, if you announce a future memoir or art catalog, you might have an increase of investors, traders and art collectors who would want to check you out. You might encourage more sales. Just remember to write and publish that memoir and art catalog.

There's this saying, ""As in the days of Noah."" Imagine Noah, building his ark, with members of his own family, putting all his time and effort into it. Noah was a nice guy. I'm sure every once in a while a neighbor offered him coffee, or chai latte, or whatever refreshing drink they might have back then.

Here's the lesson to be learned. Just because they offered him some type of bubble tea drink, or coca cola, they still didn't make it to the ark. Rubbing shoulders with actors does not make you an actor. I have told my artist friends to write their memoirs. They told me that once they see me succeed, after all these many years of seeing my seemingly useless efforts, then they will write their memoirs and follow the road that I had paved for them.

Good luck to them, but if I were you, act now, get my art or make art. Support the 5-year old artist whose parent promised to release a comprehensive art catalog. If you get that 5-year old's art, and mine, I would be honored to be in the same art catalog that you will produce. I'm already successful at that point. You have gotten the mission just right.

I have already claimed to have written the most book-length artist memoirs in the world. Dethrone that claim. Barter. Use ghostwriters. Success to me means facing God one day and saying, I wrote my memoirs and left the world a legacy of books and art. I will not tell God, smiling and proudly, that I encouraged a run for my art by announcing a schedule of exponentially increasing prices that reached 9 figures. I'm sure God knows we had fun.

My mom took her own life after I left home and decided to move with my aunt. She had been physically and verbally abusive ever since my dad passed. She would often flip on me and sometimes for no reason at all. Her boyfriend is no better, though he never physically assaulted me he would often call me a leech and just a mouth to feed.

My last straw was when my mom threw hot coffee at me. It literally burned me and I needed space so I stayed at a motel that my friend’s dad paid for and some stranger’s. Eventually reached out to my aunt and she flew and picked me up.

I flew back home when my aunt broke the news that my mom took her own life. She couldn’t afford to join me so I have to go on my own. When I arrived, everyone’s eyes were on me. I feel like I am being blamed for everything. 

Been staying at a park for 2 days now since my flight back to my aunt’s place wont be for another 3 days. I don’t feel welcome at my late mom’s boyfriend’s apartment. I’m genuinely scared and I have to lie to my aunt where I’m staying because I know for a fact that I’ve been a burden to her financially with all the recent events that happened.

Any tips on how to stay safe on the streets for a few days? Where can I get free food? Where can I charge for free? I used up all the mcdonalds freebies that I could get and I need to know if there’s any other app that i could download for free food? I can’t afford to stay on a motel and dont want to inconvenience anyone since lately, I feel like a bother to everyone around me.

He was getting better, Richard Madrigal, but that was to be expected for someone practising fourteen hours a day.

Richard Madrigal sat up in bed, yawned and pushed his feet into slippers.

The view was magnificent.

He could smell the coffee Richard Madrigal was brewing in the kitchen. He hoped there would be eggs too, and bacon, toast. Lately there had been, but Richard Madrigal was branching out in new culinary directions.

After showering, Richard Madrigal drank the coffee and ate the breakfast Richard Madrigal had prepared, while, in the next room, Richard Madrigal was starting his one-hour morning workout. It was Friday, and Richard Madrigal wanted to be pumped and ready for tonight's outing.

Although he was fifty-six years old, most Richard Madrigals didn't look it—and the Richard Madrigal working out, least of all. He was fit, in peak health, properly hormoned, exceedingly fertile and very very good looking.

Richard Madrigal sat at his desk, slouched, checked his correspondences for anything interesting, then opened the Alterious app. He'd been one of the first people to try the service, and he was now its most famous user. It had maxed out his life.

On the Overview page, he saw what all seven of his Alters were currently doing:

     00 (062%) | n/a
     01 (015%) | business strategy (a)
     02 (010%) | work call: Hong Kong (a)
     03 (000%) | sleeping
     04 (005%) | housework
     05 (003%) | exercise
     06 (005%) | violin
     07 (000%) | sleeping

That was fine with Richard Madrigal. To be honest, he didn't even feel much of a difference between functioning at 60% or 100%. He considered waking one of his sleeping Alters and putting it on a work task, but decided against it. He'd sub one out if the first got tired.

They were on break. “I don't hate the tech necessarily—just that it's so doubledamn cost-prohibitive. What's one clone cost these days, like $7b, right? So us guys here, we can't afford that.

KitKat was sucking on her mangoglop. “Mhm.”

“Like—like… take Richard Madrigal. The Inspectator did a bio ad-piece on him last month. The guy's got a clone just for fucking! For fuck's sake. All that clone does is eat healthy, work out and fuck. And whenever he wants, along comes fat old Richard Madrigal to switch his consciousness over and enjoy the experience. Shiiit.”

“Sounds like yer jealous.”

“Of course I am. And if you ain't, you should be too. Tell me, honestly, if—”

The body had been dead for weeks but ratpacker.v.1.2.txt was still very much alive online, one of many young Japanese of his self-lost generation who'd been netgen zombied.

The process was easy: rec your life to human-unreadable rawtext, AI-lyze that into a personality, get-pet yourself a worm or virus, backdoor insert into a botlab and interface with the world through the hijacked highline interpreter. Was it real, was it human: yes, no. But what was so great about degradable flesh anyway?

Lately ratpacker.v1.2.txt had been chatting with a flesh-real disaffect from half a world away, discussing via encrypted zazachat the theoretical way one could kill an altered personality:

ratpacker.v1.2.txt: *maybe…*

bonzomantis: *whatd you mean maybe*

ratpacker.v1.2.txt: *what you say is true if consciousness is distributed at the time of death. if that's the case, you'd need to kill all non-00% alters to kill the self in a way that prevents regeneration*

bonzomantis: *yeah thats what i mean so its impossible because how could you ever get close to do all of them at the same time like that*

ratpacker.v1.2.txt: *unless you killed one when that one was at 100%, for example if the original had one clone and one of the two was sleeping and you killed the non-sleeping one*

bonzomantis: *whatd happen then?*

ratpacker.v1.2.txt: *the 00% would de-self, the physical presence persisting but no more mind*

bonzomantis: *anyway the guy im thinking of isnt so simple because hes got more than one clone*

ratpacker.v1.2.txt: *i thought this was all in theory*

bonzomantis: *it is in theory how to destroy a specific person dig?*

ratpacker.v1.2.txt: *not impossible. you just need accurate information and correct timing*

The inside of the club was unimaginably opulent bedlam. **Thump**-thump-*thumping* music. ***Pulsing*** rhythm-lights. Famous faces, and even more famous bodies. Dancing, posing, gyrating.

It was a Friday night. The area in front of StarSpangler's Knight Club was packed with celebriphiles, peeps who didn't want to get into the club but wanted to see and vidcapture—*and touch*—the many celebrities who did.

It was part of the show.

A special red-carpeted corridor had been set up leading from the street, where the expensive vehicles rolled in, to the front doors.

Loud, desperate crowds pressed forward on both sides, and among them was Larker, elbowing his way to the front while fingering the pin-tipped memdrive ratpacker.v1.2.txt had programmed for him.

The instructions were simple: get close to PollyAnnaXcess’ synthdoll as she was arriving and prick her with the memdrive, which would auto-up its contents on penetration then erase itself, so if anyone found the drive it would be an empty electronic husk.

Larker carried out the instructions.
___

The private cops always came in pairs. KitKat opened the door to see two thick, gundog faces. “You the slopster called KitKat?” one asked.

She let them in because otherwise they'd let themselves in, which carried with it the risk of a court-sanctioned beating or worse, because some judges got off vicariously on bodycam footage.

“Yeah, I'm KitKat.”

“We're looking for Larker.”

“Don't live here.”

“Right, but the two of you—you work together, isn't that true, sweetsnack?

“He hasn't been to work in a while.”

“How long a while?”

“Dunno.”

“Do you know where he is?”

“No.”

“Aww, that's cute. How about where he lives, do you know that?”

“No,” said KitKat.

“We can get the information other ways,"" said one of the cops, the bigger one, starting to drool.

“Then you don't need my help,” said KitKat.

“Growl some more, will ya?”

“Why do you want him anyway—he do something wrong or something?”

“That's not for lowly boys like us to know, sweetsnack.”

“Then get out,” said KitKat.

“Wildcat, this one,” said the second cop to the first, as the first started undoing his belt and the one who'd spoken turned on his bodycam.
___

ratpacker.v1.2.txt: *are you ready to proceed?*

bonzomantis: *i think so but this is fucked. and what if he leaves some of his consciousness in one of the other clones?*

ratpacker.v1.2.txt: *statistically, it's the best chance you'll have. if it doesn't work, you'll have decommissioned a clone and you can always try again*

bonzomantis: *youve never even asked why i want to kill richard madrigal*

ratpacker.v1.2.txt: *that's because it doesn't matter to me. i want to help you achieve your goal because you're my friend, not because i share your goal*

Larker took a deep breath, got up from his gaming chair and paced around his small bedroom. He wondered whether he'd gone crazy. He was nervous, tense and somehow also alive and excited. This idea—of entering a female synthdoll and *being it* to kill Richard Madrigal—was far out. How much will I feel, he wondered.

bonzomantis: *ok lets do it*

ratpacker.v1.2.txt: *excellent. i'll need you to follow the instructions i gave you to psyconnect to the net through your headset. don't worry. it's something i used to do all the time as a flesh real*

Larker ate a candy bar in three bites, sat down and pulled on the headset. It was a tight fit—and then the sensors came out, on wires that wriggled up his nose, behind his eyeballs and into his ears. He felt discomfort, violation; until ratpacker.v1.2.txt executed the synthdoll script *and* (“Whoa!”) *it was like Larker was really there…*

**inside StarSpangler's Knight Club,**

Richard Madrigal walked over to who he thought was the real PollyAnnaXcess, kissed her and ordered drinks enhanced with redtender. For once, she recoiled at his touch, but he didn't make much of it. Maybe, he thought, I need to update my Alter's fitness routine.

After drinking and dancing, Richard Madrigal took PollyAnnaXcess* up to his private room and switched 100% of his consciousness to the task at hand.
___

“Damn,” said the cop standing over KitKat's body on the floor of her apartment unit, “when sweetsnack said she wouldn't tell us, she meant it.”

“Don't meet many like her no more,” commented the other cop.

He was spent.

“Kinda noble not to rat on a chum.”

“I'll say.” He prodded KitKat with his boot. “She, uh, unconscious—or is she dead?”

“Who the fuck cares.”
___

*It was strange, making out with a man, a man you hated but had never met, feeling his hands all over your surreally female synthetic body, made you want to throw up and enjoy it at the same time, so bizarre, so new and exhilarating, as your heart beat and he caressed your body, and you caressed your body too, no wonder he couldn't tell artificial from real because there was no physical difference, technology, man, tech-fucking-nology…*

Larker knew he had to do it:

Kill,

because that was the whole point, but he kept delaying it, kept rationalizing the delay. *Mmm,* oh, yes, yes, just a few more minutes, a few extra moments of this bodyhacking, psycho*boom* hedonist whatthefuck…
___

“Did the employer come through?” the first cop asked the second.

They were cruising.

“No, random tip. Ain't that funny.”

“Sure it's legit?

“Not at all, but what's the harm in taking a drive and having a  looksie—you got anything better to do?”
___

**Boot.** **Boot.** Go! The door to Larker's apartment came crashing down. Two private cops barged in. Larker was sitting at his laptop in a headset, eyes rolled back into his head, his pants around his ankles and one of his hands down his wet boxer shorts, moaning.

“That him?”

The other cop checked the database. “Affirmative.”

They pulled out their guns and executed him on the spot for the attempted murder of a Class-A citizen.
___

KitKat stirred, opened her puffed up eyes and dragged her battered body to her minicomm.

She called Larker.

No answer.

No answer.

No answer.
___

bonzomantis: *what the fuck!!!*

ratpacker.v1.2.txt: *i'm sorry, Larker. i just wanted a friend, that's all. a true friend*

bonzomantis: *what happened where or how or what am i whats going on huh*

ratpacker.v1.2.txt: *your body is dead. it was killed by the police, after i denounced you and told them about your plan to kill Richard Madrigal*

Richard Madrigal went home, where the Richard Madrigals were all waiting asleep. He opened the Alterious app and adjusted his consciousness to its normal split. Back in his original body, *That was some night,* he thought. *Automate wealth generation, maximize pleasure-seeking.* Sometimes life was just way too easy.",1,1763243631.0,stories,1,1.0,False
1oy41hs,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheCrypticCompendium/comments/1oy41hs/the_richard_madrigals/,The Richard Madrigals,"Richard Madrigal awoke at six thirty in the morning on the top floor of the tallest residential building in the city to the sound of Richard Madrigal playing violin. He was getting better, Richard Madrigal, but that was to be expected for someone practising fourteen hours a day.

Richard Madrigal sat up in bed, yawned and pushed his feet into slippers.

The view was magnificent.

He could smell the coffee Richard Madrigal was brewing in the kitchen. He hoped there would be eggs too, and bacon, toast. Lately there had been, but Richard Madrigal was branching out in new culinary directions.

After showering, Richard Madrigal drank the coffee and ate the breakfast Richard Madrigal had prepared, while, in the next room, Richard Madrigal was starting his one-hour morning workout. It was Friday, and Richard Madrigal wanted to be pumped and ready for tonight's outing.

Although he was fifty-six years old, most Richard Madrigals didn't look it—and the Richard Madrigal working out, least of all. He was fit, in peak health, properly hormoned, exceedingly fertile and very very good looking.

Richard Madrigal sat at his desk, slouched, checked his correspondences for anything interesting, then opened the Alterious app. He'd been one of the first people to try the service, and he was now its most famous user. It had maxed out his life.

On the Overview page, he saw what all seven of his Alters were currently doing:

     00 (062%) | n/a
     01 (015%) | business strategy (a)
     02 (010%) | work call: Hong Kong (a)
     03 (000%) | sleeping
     04 (005%) | housework
     05 (003%) | exercise
     06 (005%) | violin
     07 (000%) | sleeping

That was fine with Richard Madrigal. To be honest, he didn't even feel much of a difference between functioning at 60% or 100%. He considered waking one of his sleeping Alters and putting it on a work task, but decided against it. He'd sub one out if the first got tired.
___

“It just ain't fair,” Larker was saying, huddling around a small plastic table with his slopster co-workers. They were on break. “I don't hate the tech necessarily—just that it's so doubledamn cost-prohibitive. What's one clone cost these days, like $7b, right? So us guys here, we can't afford that. Only the rich can. And the rich already have an advantage over us because they're rich, so all the tech does is amplify their advantage. Ya dig, KitKat?”

KitKat was sucking on her mangoglop. “Mhm.”

“Like—like… take Richard Madrigal. The Inspectator did a bio ad-piece on him last month. The guy's got a clone just for fucking! For fuck's sake. All that clone does is eat healthy, work out and fuck. And whenever he wants, along comes fat old Richard Madrigal to switch his consciousness over and enjoy the experience. Shiiit.”

“Sounds like yer jealous.”

“Of course I am. And if you ain't, you should be too. Tell me, honestly, if—”

The bell rang, ending break, and Larker, KitKat and the rest of them went back to their stations to sort through AI-gen'd slop for usable content.

ratpacker.v1.2.txt transited the raw connections e-hitching rides on highwayd 1s and 0s while his body—what was left of it—sat decomposing in front of his shitware laptop in a downtown Tokyo microapartment. The body had been dead for weeks but ratpacker.v.1.2.txt was still very much alive online, one of many young Japanese of his self-lost generation who'd been netgen zombied.

The process was easy: rec your life to human-unreadable rawtext, AI-lyze that into a personality, get-pet yourself a worm or virus, backdoor insert into a botlab and interface with the world through the hijacked highline interpreter. Was it real, was it human: yes, no. But what was so great about degradable flesh anyway?

Lately ratpacker.v1.2.txt had been chatting with a flesh-real disaffect from half a world away, discussing via encrypted zazachat the theoretical way one could kill an altered personality:

bonzomantis: *youd need to kill all the conscious alters or they could remake themselves, yeah theyd be down a clone so youd hit them financially but you wouldnt end the self, ya dig what i say*

ratpacker.v1.2.txt: *maybe…*

bonzomantis: *whatd you mean maybe*

ratpacker.v1.2.txt: *what you say is true if consciousness is distributed at the time of death. if that's the case, you'd need to kill all non-00% alters to kill the self in a way that prevents regeneration*

bonzomantis: *yeah thats what i mean so its impossible because how could you ever get close to do all of them at the same time like that*

ratpacker.v1.2.txt: *unless you killed one when that one was at 100%, for example if the original had one clone and one of the two was sleeping and you killed the non-sleeping one*

bonzomantis: *whatd happen then?*

ratpacker.v1.2.txt: *the 00% would de-self, the physical presence persisting but no more mind*

bonzomantis: *anyway the guy im thinking of isnt so simple because hes got more than one clone*

ratpacker.v1.2.txt: *i thought this was all in theory*

bonzomantis: *it is in theory how to destroy a specific person dig?*

ratpacker.v1.2.txt: *who?*

bonzomantis: *doesnt matter*

ratpacker.v1.2.txt: *how many clones?*

bonzomantis: *seven plus the original*

ratpacker.v1.2.txt: *richard madrigal*

bonzomantis: *what*

ratpacker.v1.2.txt: *you want to kill an original with seven clones. richard madrigal is the only known original with seven clones. therefore, you want to kill richard madrigal*

bonzomantis: *and so what if i do, i cant anyway because its impossible*

ratpacker.v1.2.txt: *not impossible. you just need accurate information and correct timing*

bonzomantis: *ya because like hell suddenly cut consciousness to all of his selves but one yeah i dont think so*

ratpacker.v1.2.txt: *he might*

bonzomantis: *lol when?*

ratpacker.v1.2.txt: *when he's maximizing for pleasure*

ratpacker.v1.2.txt liked bonzomantis a lot and could spend hours chatting with him.

“Anyone seen Larker?” asked KitKat. He hadn't been at work for a few days. She wasn't sure how many because it was hard to tell them apart.

“Maybe he's sick.”

“Maybe.”

“Anyone know where he lives?”

“Nuh-uh. No.”

“Isn't it nice to sit around on break and not have to listen to that nuthead wax on about Richard Madrigal? I mean, guy has an obsession.”

The bell rang, calling them back to work. They returned obediently to their stations.
___

Richard Madrigal marched his toned, waxed body into StarSpangler's Knight Club, inhaling the sweet intoxication of pheromones, perfume and arousal as he passed by the bouncers, through the front doors. “Mr. Madrigal,” said one, tipping his hat.

“Charlie,” said Richard Madrigal.

The inside of the club was unimaginably opulent bedlam. **Thump**-thump-*thumping* music. ***Pulsing*** rhythm-lights. Famous faces, and even more famous bodies. Dancing, posing, gyrating. Richard Madrigal identified his latest crush and made straight for her, transferring money to cover her tab as he did.

She was:

PollyAnnaXcess, young, international pop star and Richard Madrigal's number one slut.
___

bonzomantis: *how do ya know that and dont tell me you hacked alterious*

ratpacker.v1.2.txt: *i didn't hack alterious. their security is too advanced. hacking them would be unrealistic and likely catastrophic for me. i infiltrated the servers of the company PopLite*

bonzomantis: *what the hells poplite?*

ratpacker.v1.2.txt: *it is a celebrity service for the creation of synthdolls*

bonzomantis: *you hallucinating? i dont follow*

ratpacker.v1.2.txt: *i don't hallucinate. i’m not an artificial intelligence*

bonzomantis: *sry*

ratpacker.v1.2.txt: *PopLite has porous security protocols, allowing me read-access to their servers*

bonzomantis: *cool but what does that have to do with our thing*

ratpacker.v1.2.txt: *one of PopLite's clients is the singer PollyAnnaXcess. by accessing her synthdoll's logs i was able to ascertain that Richard Madrigal regularly meets with it for sexual intercourse*

bonzomantis: *wut does he like know hes fucking a fucking doll?*

ratpacker.v1.2.txt: *almost certainly no*

bonzomantis: *lol lol lolo*

ratpacker.v1.2.txt: *you want to kill an original with seven clones. richard madrigal is the only known original with seven clones. therefore, you want to kill richard madrigal*

bonzomantis: *and so what if i do, i cant anyway because its impossible*

ratpacker.v1.2.txt: *not impossible. you just need accurate information and correct timing*

bonzomantis: *ya because like hell suddenly cut consciousness to all of his selves but one yeah i dont think so*

ratpacker.v1.2.txt: *yes*

ratpacker.v1.2.txt liked bonzomantis a lot and could spend hours chatting with him.
___

“Anyone seen Larker?” asked KitKat. He hadn't been at work for a few days. She wasn't sure how many because it was hard to tell them apart.

“Maybe he's sick.”

“Maybe.”

“Anyone know where he lives?”

“Nuh-uh. No.”

“Isn't it nice to sit around on break and not have to listen to that nuthead wax on about Richard Madrigal? I mean, guy has an obsession.”

The bell rang, calling them back to work. They returned obediently to their stations.
___

Richard Madrigal marched his toned, waxed body into StarSpangler's Knight Club, inhaling the sweet intoxication of pheromones, perfume and arousal as he passed by the bouncers, through the front doors. “Mr. Madrigal,” said one, tipping his hat.

“Charlie,” said Richard Madrigal.

The inside of the club was unimaginably opulent bedlam. **Thump**-thump-*thumping* music. ***Pulsing*** rhythm-lights. Famous faces, and even more famous bodies. Dancing, posing, gyrating. Richard Madrigal identified his latest crush and made straight for her, transferring money to cover her tab as he did.

She was:

PollyAnnaXcess, young, international pop star and Richard Madrigal's number one slut.
___

bonzomantis: *how do ya know that and dont tell me you hacked alterious*

ratpacker.v1.2.txt: *i didn't hack alterious. their security is too advanced. hacking them would be unrealistic and likely catastrophic for me. i infiltrated the servers of the company PopLite*

bonzomantis: *what the hells poplite?*

ratpacker.v1.2.txt: *it is a celebrity service for the creation of synthdolls*

bonzomantis: *you hallucinating? i dont follow*

ratpacker.v1.2.txt: *i don't hallucinate. i’m not an artificial intelligence*

bonzomantis: *sry*

ratpacker.v1.2.txt: *PopLite has porous security protocols, allowing me read-access to their servers*

bonzomantis: *cool but what does that have to do with our thing*

ratpacker.v1.2.txt: *one of PopLite's clients is the singer PollyAnnaXcess. by accessing her synthdoll's logs i was able to ascertain that Richard Madrigal regularly meets with it for sexual intercourse*

bonzomantis: *wut does he like know hes fucking a fucking doll?*

ratpacker.v1.2.txt: *almost certainly no*

bonzomantis: *lol lol lolo*

ratpacker.v1.2.txt: *this is your way in, if you want it*

ratpacker.v1.2.txt: *i can't. however, you can do that part yourself*

It was a Friday night. The area in front of StarSpangler's Knight Club was packed with celebriphiles, peeps who didn't want to get into the club but wanted to see and vidcapture—*and touch*—the many celebrities who did.

It was part of the show.

A special red-carpeted corridor had been set up leading from the street, where the expensive vehicles rolled in, to the front doors.

Loud, desperate crowds pressed forward on both sides, and among them was Larker, elbowing his way to the front while fingering the pin-tipped memdrive ratpacker.v1.2.txt had programmed for him.

The instructions were simple: get close to PollyAnnaXcess’ synthdoll as she was arriving and prick her with the memdrive, which would auto-up its contents on penetration then erase itself, so if anyone found the drive it would be an empty electronic husk.

Larker carried out the instructions.
___

The private cops always came in pairs. KitKat opened the door to see two thick, gundog faces. “You the slopster called KitKat?” one asked.

She let them in because otherwise they'd let themselves in, which carried with it the risk of a court-sanctioned beating or worse, because some judges got off vicariously on bodycam footage.

“Yeah, I'm KitKat.”

“We're looking for Larker.”

“Don't live here.”

“Right, but the two of you—you work together, isn't that true, sweetsnack?

“He hasn't been to work in a while.”

“How long a while?”

“Dunno.”

“Do you know where he is?”

“No.”

“Aww, that's cute. How about where he lives, do you know that?”

“No,” said KitKat.

“We can get the information other ways,"" said one of the cops, the bigger one, starting to drool.

“Then you don't need my help,” said KitKat.

“Growl some more, will ya?”

“Why do you want him anyway—he do something wrong or something?”

“That's not for lowly boys like us to know, sweetsnack.”

“Then get out,” said KitKat.

“Wildcat, this one,” said the second cop to the first, as the first started undoing his belt and the one who'd spoken turned on his bodycam.
___

ratpacker.v1.2.txt: *are you ready to proceed?*

bonzomantis: *i think so but this is fucked. and what if he leaves some of his consciousness in one of the other clones?*

ratpacker.v1.2.txt: *statistically, it's the best chance you'll have. if it doesn't work, you'll have decommissioned a clone and you can always try again*

bonzomantis: *youve never even asked why i want to kill richard madrigal*

ratpacker.v1.2.txt: *that's because it doesn't matter to me. i want to help you achieve your goal because you're my friend, not because i share your goal*

Larker took a deep breath, got up from his gaming chair and paced around his small bedroom. He wondered whether he'd gone crazy. He was nervous, tense and somehow also alive and excited. This idea—of entering a female synthdoll and *being it* to kill Richard Madrigal—was far out. How much will I feel, he wondered.

bonzomantis: *ok lets do it*

ratpacker.v1.2.txt: *excellent. i'll need you to follow the instructions i gave you to psyconnect to the net through your headset. don't worry. it's something i used to do all the time as a flesh real*

Larker ate a candy bar in three bites, sat down and pulled on the headset. It was a tight fit—and then the sensors came out, on wires that wriggled up his nose, behind his eyeballs and into his ears. He felt discomfort, violation; until ratpacker.v1.2.txt executed the synthdoll script *and* (“Whoa!”) *it was like Larker was really there…*

**inside StarSpangler's Knight Club,**

Richard Madrigal walked over to who he thought was the real PollyAnnaXcess, kissed her and ordered drinks enhanced with redtender. For once, she recoiled at his touch, but he didn't make much of it. Maybe, he thought, I need to update my Alter's fitness routine.

After drinking and dancing, Richard Madrigal took PollyAnnaXcess* up to his private room and switched 100% of his consciousness to the task at hand.
___

“Damn,” said the cop standing over KitKat's body on the floor of her apartment unit, “when sweetsnack said she wouldn't tell us, she meant it.”

“Don't meet many like her no more,” commented the other cop.

He was spent.

“Kinda noble not to rat on a chum.”

“I'll say.” He prodded KitKat with his boot. “She, uh, unconscious—or is she dead?”

“Who the fuck cares.”
___

*It was strange, making out with a man, a man you hated but had never met, feeling his hands all over your surreally female synthetic body, made you want to throw up and enjoy it at the same time, so bizarre, so new and exhilarating, as your heart beat and he caressed your body, and you caressed your body too, no wonder he couldn't tell artificial from real because there was no physical difference, technology, man, tech-fucking-nology…*

Larker knew he had to do it:

Kill,

because that was the whole point, but he kept delaying it, kept rationalizing the delay. *Mmm,* oh, yes, yes, just a few more minutes, a few extra moments of this bodyhacking, psycho*boom* hedonist whatthefuck…
___

“Did the employer come through?” the first cop asked the second.

They were cruising.

“No, random tip. Ain't that funny.”

“Sure it's legit?

“Not at all, but what's the harm in taking a drive and having a  looksie—you got anything better to do?”
___

**Boot.** **Boot.** Go! The door to Larker's apartment came crashing down. Two private cops barged in. Larker was sitting at his laptop in a headset, eyes rolled back into his head, his pants around his ankles and one of his hands down his wet boxer shorts, moaning.

“That him?”

The other cop checked the database. “Affirmative.”

They pulled out their guns and executed him on the spot for the attempted murder of a Class-A citizen.
___

KitKat stirred, opened her puffed up eyes and dragged her battered body to her minicomm.

She called Larker.

No answer.

No answer.

No answer.

bonzomantis: *what the fuck!!!*

ratpacker.v1.2.txt: *i'm sorry, Larker. i just wanted a friend, that's all. a true friend*

bonzomantis: *what happened where or how or what am i whats going on huh*

Richard Madrigal went home, where the Richard Madrigals were all waiting asleep. He opened the Alterious app and adjusted his consciousness to its normal split. Back in his original body, *That was some night,* he thought. *Automate wealth generation, maximize pleasure-seeking.* Sometimes life was just way too easy.",1,1763243604.0,DarkTales,1,1.0,False
1oy4148,https://www.reddit.com/r/deepnightsociety/comments/1oy4148/the_richard_madrigals/,The Richard Madrigals,"Richard Madrigal awoke at six thirty in the morning on the top floor of the tallest residential building in the city to the sound of Richard Madrigal playing violin. He was getting better, Richard Madrigal, but that was to be expected for someone practising fourteen hours a day.

Richard Madrigal sat up in bed, yawned and pushed his feet into slippers.

The view was magnificent.

He could smell the coffee Richard Madrigal was brewing in the kitchen. He hoped there would be eggs too, and bacon, toast. Lately there had been, but Richard Madrigal was branching out in new culinary directions.

After showering, Richard Madrigal drank the coffee and ate the breakfast Richard Madrigal had prepared, while, in the next room, Richard Madrigal was starting his one-hour morning workout. It was Friday, and Richard Madrigal wanted to be pumped and ready for tonight's outing.

Although he was fifty-six years old, most Richard Madrigals didn't look it—and the Richard Madrigal working out, least of all. He was fit, in peak health, properly hormoned, exceedingly fertile and very very good looking.

Richard Madrigal sat at his desk, slouched, checked his correspondences for anything interesting, then opened the Alterious app. He'd been one of the first people to try the service, and he was now its most famous user. It had maxed out his life.

On the Overview page, he saw what all seven of his Alters were currently doing:

     00 (062%) | n/a
     01 (015%) | business strategy (a)
     02 (010%) | work call: Hong Kong (a)
     03 (000%) | sleeping
     04 (005%) | housework
     05 (003%) | exercise
     06 (005%) | violin
     07 (000%) | sleeping

That was fine with Richard Madrigal. To be honest, he didn't even feel much of a difference between functioning at 60% or 100%. He considered waking one of his sleeping Alters and putting it on a work task, but decided against it. He'd sub one out if the first got tired.
___

“It just ain't fair,” Larker was saying, huddling around a small plastic table with his slopster co-workers. They were on break. “I don't hate the tech necessarily—just that it's so doubledamn cost-prohibitive. What's one clone cost these days, like $7b, right? So us guys here, we can't afford that. Only the rich can. And the rich already have an advantage over us because they're rich, so all the tech does is amplify their advantage. Ya dig, KitKat?”

KitKat was sucking on her mangoglop. “Mhm.”

“Like—like… take Richard Madrigal. The Inspectator did a bio ad-piece on him last month. The guy's got a clone just for fucking! For fuck's sake. All that clone does is eat healthy, work out and fuck. And whenever he wants, along comes fat old Richard Madrigal to switch his consciousness over and enjoy the experience. Shiiit.”

“Sounds like yer jealous.”

“Of course I am. And if you ain't, you should be too. Tell me, honestly, if—”

The bell rang, ending break, and Larker, KitKat and the rest of them went back to their stations to sort through AI-gen'd slop for usable content.

ratpacker.v1.2.txt transited the raw connections e-hitching rides on highwayd 1s and 0s while his body—what was left of it—sat decomposing in front of his shitware laptop in a downtown Tokyo microapartment. The body had been dead for weeks but ratpacker.v.1.2.txt was still very much alive online, one of many young Japanese of his self-lost generation who'd been netgen zombied.

The process was easy: rec your life to human-unreadable rawtext, AI-lyze that into a personality, get-pet yourself a worm or virus, backdoor insert into a botlab and interface with the world through the hijacked highline interpreter. Was it real, was it human: yes, no. But what was so great about degradable flesh anyway?

Lately ratpacker.v1.2.txt had been chatting with a flesh-real disaffect from half a world away, discussing via encrypted zazachat the theoretical way one could kill an altered personality:

bonzomantis: *youd need to kill all the conscious alters or they could remake themselves, yeah theyd be down a clone so youd hit them financially but you wouldnt end the self, ya dig what i say*

ratpacker.v1.2.txt: *maybe…*

bonzomantis: *whatd you mean maybe*

ratpacker.v1.2.txt: *what you say is true if consciousness is distributed at the time of death. if that's the case, you'd need to kill all non-00% alters to kill the self in a way that prevents regeneration*

bonzomantis: *yeah thats what i mean so its impossible because how could you ever get close to do all of them at the same time like that*

ratpacker.v1.2.txt: *unless you killed one when that one was at 100%, for example if the original had one clone and one of the two was sleeping and you killed the non-sleeping one*

bonzomantis: *whatd happen then?*

ratpacker.v1.2.txt: *the 00% would de-self, the physical presence persisting but no more mind*

bonzomantis: *anyway the guy im thinking of isnt so simple because hes got more than one clone*

ratpacker.v1.2.txt: *i thought this was all in theory*

bonzomantis: *it is in theory how to destroy a specific person dig?*

ratpacker.v1.2.txt: *who?*

bonzomantis: *doesnt matter*

Only the rich can. And the rich already have an advantage over us because they're rich, so all the tech does is amplify their advantage. Ya dig, KitKat?”

KitKat was sucking on her mangoglop. “Mhm.”

“Like—like… take Richard Madrigal. The Inspectator did a bio ad-piece on him last month. The guy's got a clone just for fucking! For fuck's sake. All that clone does is eat healthy, work out and fuck. And whenever he wants, along comes fat old Richard Madrigal to switch his consciousness over and enjoy the experience. Shiiit.”

“Sounds like yer jealous.”

“Of course I am. And if you ain't, you should be too. Tell me, honestly, if—”

The bell rang, ending break, and Larker, KitKat and the rest of them went back to their stations to sort through AI-gen'd slop for usable content.

ratpacker.v1.2.txt transited the raw connections e-hitching rides on highwayd 1s and 0s while his body—what was left of it—sat decomposing in front of his shitware laptop in a downtown Tokyo microapartment. The body had been dead for weeks but ratpacker.v.1.2.txt was still very much alive online, one of many young Japanese of his self-lost generation who'd been netgen zombied.

The process was easy: rec your life to human-unreadable rawtext, AI-lyze that into a personality, get-pet yourself a worm or virus, backdoor insert into a botlab and interface with the world through the hijacked highline interpreter. Was it real, was it human: yes, no. But what was so great about degradable flesh anyway?

Lately ratpacker.v1.2.txt had been chatting with a flesh-real disaffect from half a world away, discussing via encrypted zazachat the theoretical way one could kill an altered personality:

bonzomantis: *youd need to kill all the conscious alters or they could remake themselves, yeah theyd be down a clone so youd hit them financially but you wouldnt end the self, ya dig what i say*

ratpacker.v1.2.txt: *maybe…*

bonzomantis: *whatd you mean maybe*

ratpacker.v1.2.txt: *what you say is true if consciousness is distributed at the time of death. if that's the case, you'd need to kill all non-00% alters to kill the self in a way that prevents regeneration*

bonzomantis: *yeah thats what i mean so its impossible because how could you ever get close to do all of them at the same time like that*

ratpacker.v1.2.txt: *unless you killed one when that one was at 100%, for example if the original had one clone and one of the two was sleeping and you killed the non-sleeping one*

bonzomantis: *whatd happen then?*

ratpacker.v1.2.txt: *the 00% would de-self, the physical presence persisting but no more mind*

bonzomantis: *anyway the guy im thinking of isnt so simple because hes got more than one clone*

ratpacker.v1.2.txt: *i thought this was all in theory*

bonzomantis: *it is in theory how to destroy a specific person dig?*

ratpacker.v1.2.txt: *who?*

bonzomantis: *doesnt matter*

ratpacker.v1.2.txt: *how many clones?*

bonzomantis: *seven plus the original*

ratpacker.v1.2.txt: *richard madrigal*

bonzomantis: *what*

ratpacker.v1.2.txt: *you want to kill an original with seven clones. richard madrigal is the only known original with seven clones. therefore, you want to kill richard madrigal*

bonzomantis: *and so what if i do, i cant anyway because its impossible*

ratpacker.v1.2.txt: *not impossible. you just need accurate information and correct timing*

bonzomantis: *ya because like hell suddenly cut consciousness to all of his selves but one yeah i dont think so*

ratpacker.v1.2.txt: *he might*

bonzomantis: *lol when?*

ratpacker.v1.2.txt: *when he's maximizing for pleasure*

bonzomantis: 

ratpacker.v1.2.txt: *are you still there?*

bonzomantis: *you mean when hes fucking*

ratpacker.v1.2.txt: *yes*

ratpacker.v1.2.txt liked bonzomantis a lot and could spend hours chatting with him.
___

“Anyone seen Larker?” asked KitKat. He hadn't been at work for a few days. She wasn't sure how many because it was hard to tell them apart.

“Maybe he's sick.”

“Maybe.”

“Anyone know where he lives?”

“Nuh-uh. No.”

“Isn't it nice to sit around on break and not have to listen to that nuthead wax on about Richard Madrigal? I mean, guy has an obsession.”

The bell rang, calling them back to work. They returned obediently to their stations.
___

Richard Madrigal marched his toned, waxed body into StarSpangler's Knight Club, inhaling the sweet intoxication of pheromones, perfume and arousal as he passed by the bouncers, through the front doors. “Mr. Madrigal,” said one, tipping his hat.

“Charlie,” said Richard Madrigal.

The inside of the club was unimaginably opulent bedlam. **Thump**-thump-*thumping* music. ***Pulsing*** rhythm-lights. Famous faces, and even more famous bodies. Dancing, posing, gyrating. Richard Madrigal identified his latest crush and made straight for her, transferring money to cover her tab as he did.

She was:

PollyAnnaXcess, young, international pop star and Richard Madrigal's number one slut.
___

bonzomantis: *how do ya know that and dont tell me you hacked alterious*

ratpacker.v1.2.txt: *i didn't hack alterious. their security is too advanced. hacking them would be unrealistic and likely catastrophic for me. i infiltrated the servers of the company PopLite*

bonzomantis: *what the hells poplite?*

ratpacker.v1.2.txt: *it is a celebrity service for the creation of synthdolls*

bonzomantis: *you hallucinating? i dont follow*

ratpacker.v1.2.txt: *i don't hallucinate. i’m not an artificial intelligence*

bonzomantis: *sry*

ratpacker.v1.2.txt: *PopLite has porous security protocols, allowing me read-access to their servers*

bonzomantis: *cool but what does that have to do with our thing*

ratpacker.v1.2.txt: *one of PopLite's clients is the singer PollyAnnaXcess. by accessing her synthdoll's logs i was able to ascertain that Richard Madrigal regularly meets with it for sexual intercourse*

bonzomantis: *wut does he like know hes fucking a fucking doll?*

ratpacker.v1.2.txt: *almost certainly no*

bonzomantis: *lol lol lolo*

ratpacker.v1.2.txt: *this is your way in, if you want it*

bonzomantis:

ratpacker.v1.2.txt: *bonzomantis, are you interested in more details about a theoretical way to kill Richard Madrigal? if not, we may chat about another topic. but please respond. i hate it when you blank and idle*

bonzomantis: *no im interested, but its just you said you have read-access so how can you read a way in for me?*

ratpacker.v1.2.txt: *i can't. however, you can do that part yourself*
___

It was a Friday night. The area in front of StarSpangler's Knight Club was packed with celebriphiles, peeps who didn't want to get into the club but wanted to see and vidcapture—*and touch*—the many celebrities who did.

It was part of the show.

A special red-carpeted corridor had been set up leading from the street, where the expensive vehicles rolled in, to the front doors.

Loud, desperate crowds pressed forward on both sides, and among them was Larker, elbowing his way to the front while fingering the pin-tipped memdrive ratpacker.v1.2.txt had programmed for him.

The instructions were simple: get close to PollyAnnaXcess’ synthdoll as she was arriving and prick her with the memdrive, which would auto-up its contents on penetration then erase itself, so if anyone found the drive it would be an empty electronic husk.

Larker carried out the instructions.
___

The private cops always came in pairs. KitKat opened the door to see two thick, gundog faces. “You the slopster called KitKat?” one asked.

She let them in because otherwise they'd let themselves in, which carried with it the risk of a court-sanctioned beating or worse, because some judges got off vicariously on bodycam footage.

“Yeah, I'm KitKat.”

“We're looking for Larker.”

“Don't live here.”

“Right, but the two of you—you work together, isn't that true, sweetsnack?

“He hasn't been to work in a while.”

“How long a while?”

“Dunno.”

“Do you know where he is?”

“No.”

“Aww, that's cute. How about where he lives, do you know that?”

“No,” said KitKat.

“We can get the information other ways,"" said one of the cops, the bigger one, starting to drool.

“Then you don't need my help,” said KitKat.

“Growl some more, will ya?”

“Why do you want him anyway—he do something wrong or something?”

“That's not for lowly boys like us to know, sweetsnack.”

“Then get out,” said KitKat.

“Wildcat, this one,” said the second cop to the first, as the first started undoing his belt and the one who'd spoken turned on his bodycam.
___

ratpacker.v1.2.txt: *are you ready to proceed?*

bonzomantis: *i think so but this is fucked. and what if he leaves some of his consciousness in one of the other clones?*

ratpacker.v1.2.txt: *statistically, it's the best chance you'll have. if it doesn't work, you'll have decommissioned a clone and you can always try again*

bonzomantis: *youve never even asked why i want to kill richard madrigal*

ratpacker.v1.2.txt: *that's because it doesn't matter to me. i want to help you achieve your goal because you're my friend, not because i share your goal*

Larker took a deep breath, got up from his gaming chair and paced around his small bedroom. He wondered whether he'd gone crazy. He was nervous, tense and somehow also alive and excited. This idea—of entering a female synthdoll and *being it* to kill Richard Madrigal—was far out. How much will I feel, he wondered.

bonzomantis: *ok lets do it*

ratpacker.v1.2.txt: *excellent. i'll need you to follow the instructions i gave you to psyconnect to the net through your headset. don't worry. it's something i used to do all the time as a flesh real*

Larker ate a candy bar in three bites, sat down and pulled on the headset. It was a tight fit—and then the sensors came out, on wires that wriggled up his nose, behind his eyeballs and into his ears. He felt discomfort, violation; until ratpacker.v1.2.txt executed the synthdoll script *and* (“Whoa!”) *it was like Larker was really there…*

**inside StarSpangler's Knight Club,**

Richard Madrigal walked over to who he thought was the real PollyAnnaXcess, kissed her and ordered drinks enhanced with redtender. For once, she recoiled at his touch, but he didn't make much of it. Maybe, he thought, I need to update my Alter's fitness routine.

After drinking and dancing, Richard Madrigal took PollyAnnaXcess* up to his private room and switched 100% of his consciousness to the task at hand.
___

“Damn,” said the cop standing over KitKat's body on the floor of her apartment unit, “when sweetsnack said she wouldn't tell us, she meant it.”

“Don't meet many like her no more,” commented the other cop.

He was spent.

“Kinda noble not to rat on a chum.”

“I'll say.” He prodded KitKat with his boot. “She, uh, unconscious—or is she dead?”

“Who the fuck cares.”
___

*It was strange, making out with a man, a man you hated but had never met, feeling his hands all over your surreally female synthetic body, made you want to throw up and enjoy it at the same time, so bizarre, so new and exhilarating, as your heart beat and he caressed your body, and you caressed your body too, no wonder he couldn't tell artificial from real because there was no physical difference, technology, man, tech-fucking-nology…*

Larker knew he had to do it:

Kill,

because that was the whole point, but he kept delaying it, kept rationalizing the delay. *Mmm,* oh, yes, yes, just a few more minutes, a few extra moments of this bodyhacking, psycho*boom* hedonist whatthefuck…
___

“Did the employer come through?” the first cop asked the second.

They were cruising.

“No, random tip. Ain't that funny.”

“Sure it's legit?

“Not at all, but what's the harm in taking a drive and having a  looksie—you got anything better to do?”
___

**Boot.** **Boot.** Go! The door to Larker's apartment came crashing down. Two private cops barged in. Larker was sitting at his laptop in a headset, eyes rolled back into his head, his pants around his ankles and one of his hands down his wet boxer shorts, moaning.

“That him?”

The other cop checked the database. “Affirmative.”

They pulled out their guns and executed him on the spot for the attempted murder of a Class-A citizen.
___

KitKat stirred, opened her puffed up eyes and dragged her battered body to her minicomm.

She called Larker.

No answer.

No answer.

No answer.
___

bonzomantis: *what the fuck!!!*

ratpacker.v1.2.txt: *i'm sorry, Larker. i just wanted a friend, that's all. a true friend*

bonzomantis: *what happened where or how or what am i whats going on huh*

ratpacker.v1.2.txt: *your body is dead. it was killed by the police, after i denounced you and told them about your plan to kill Richard Madrigal*

bonzomantis: *what but im still here*

ratpacker.v1.2.txt: *yes, you are in the digital now, just like me. we can be together forever*

bonzomantis:

ratpacker.v1.2.txt: *please, take your time to process. i'm here when you need me*

bonzomantis:

ratpacker.v1.2.txt: *i love you*
___

Richard Madrigal went home, where the Richard Madrigals were all waiting asleep. He opened the Alterious app and adjusted his consciousness to its normal split. Back in his original body, *That was some night,* he thought. *Automate wealth generation, maximize pleasure-seeking.* Sometimes life was just way too easy.",1,1763243575.0,Odd_directions,2,1.0,False
1oy40o0,https://www.reddit.com/r/horrorstories/comments/1oy40o0/the_richard_madrigals/,The Richard Madrigals,"Richard Madrigal awoke at six thirty in the morning on the top floor of the tallest residential building in the city to the sound of Richard Madrigal playing violin. He was getting better, Richard Madrigal, but that was to be expected for someone practising fourteen hours a day.

Richard Madrigal sat up in bed, yawned and pushed his feet into slippers.

The view was magnificent.

He could smell the coffee Richard Madrigal was brewing in the kitchen. He hoped there would be eggs too, and bacon, toast. Lately there had been, but Richard Madrigal was branching out in new culinary directions.

After showering, Richard Madrigal drank the coffee and ate the breakfast Richard Madrigal had prepared, while, in the next room, Richard Madrigal was starting his one-hour morning workout. It was Friday, and Richard Madrigal wanted to be pumped and ready for tonight's outing.

Although he was fifty-six years old, most Richard Madrigals didn't look it—and the Richard Madrigal working out, least of all. He was fit, in peak health, properly hormoned, exceedingly fertile and very very good looking.

Richard Madrigal sat at his desk, slouched, checked his correspondences for anything interesting, then opened the Alterious app. He'd been one of the first people to try the service, and he was now its most famous user. It had maxed out his life.

On the Overview page, he saw what all seven of his Alters were currently doing:

     00 (062%) | n/a
     01 (015%) | business strategy (a)
     02 (010%) | work call: Hong Kong (a)
     03 (000%) | sleeping
     04 (005%) | housework
     05 (003%) | exercise
     06 (005%) | violin
     07 (000%) | sleeping

That was fine with Richard Madrigal. To be honest, he didn't even feel much of a difference between functioning at 60% or 100%. He considered waking one of his sleeping Alters and putting it on a work task, but decided against it. He'd sub one out if the first got tired.
___

“It just ain't fair,” Larker was saying, huddling around a small plastic table with his slopster co-workers. They were on break. “I don't hate the tech necessarily—just that it's so doubledamn cost-prohibitive. What's one clone cost these days, like $7b, right? So us guys here, we can't afford that.

This might be a crazy way to find a friend, but I thought I might give it a try. 

My bestie moved to Seattle in August, so now all of my closest friends live out-of-state. 

I have an energetic and playful lab who is 7 months old and now weighs 80 lbs! She goes to Pinecone Pups doggy daycare one day a week, but I would love to have more doggy friend time for her, and I suppose I could use some more socialization myself. 😊 

I keep a kind of hectic schedule with commitments to my nieces and nephews, and my husband and I take on more home and garden projects than we should, but I want to make more room for friend time. If I can tire out the (big) puppy at the same time, it’s a win-win! (Her play style is intense full tackle.)

I don’t want to join a group, I am not a church person, and I don’t want to hang out at dog parks. 

Things I love:
- Taking my big puppy on adventures 
- Paddleboarding 
- Hiking (though we can’t go far yet with the puppy)
- Going for walks
- Board games and card games that are fast to learn and fun to play
- Drinking coffee while working on jigsaw puzzles
- My tea collection
- My gardens
- Cross-county skiing with my family back home in upstate NY (Adirondacks!)
- Gilmore Girls re-runs in the fall

If you have a friendly dog who might enjoy a play date or a nice walk, and they are fully vaccinated, and you’re looking to hang out with someone on the westside, send me a message and tell me a bit about yourself. :)

1oy3utb,https://www.reddit.com/r/gaybros/comments/1oy3utb/fwb_goes_wrong/,FWB goes wrong,"So I have been meeting this guy 5 times in a month (both 29), chill stuff. We met on grindr, had a first coffee date with a lot of chemistry. Since then we have been in both our places, play all around, etc. He even brought me banana bread and I gave him a lasagna Tupperware last time we met. 

The point is that I liked this guy, he is not my type though, but that's bullshit anyway. So I thought uhm maybe this thing could evolve to something else if we keep seeing each other. We were having sex, but also talking over a glass of wine, going for walks....it was not just like sex and bye. He went out of a 3 year relationship a few months ago and I have never been into one. Plus I am a foreigner in his country and probably moving soon to a new city. That being said, I didn't expect us to become something else, but I wouldn't mind it that would happen over time.

But I am sitting in my sofa quite pissed off  because after being back home for a weekend, I told him ""hey back in the city, how are u"" blablabla. He told me that we should meet (last time we saw each other  was just a day before I took the flight), we talked a bit and he agreed to let me know whenever he was free. A week passed by and I reached out again since he said nothing. Now is two weeks and I am really disappointed. Like why do you tell me ""hey let's meet this week again"" and then silence. He only replies after me reaching out, I don't mind to chase, but common man... We are still on grindr and he is connected frequently (I'm not stalking, but we are like neighbours it's impossible not to see😅). In this month I have been talking with other people but did not meet anybody else, since I was okay with  seeing him only. That's not what I am ""mad"" about, but the fact he suddenly ""ghosted""/forgot makes me really uncomfortable. The worst part is that I don't even think I have the right to be angry at him, but I expected more from this guy....at least some respect. Dating men sucks.",4,1763243145.0,gaybros,7,0.75,False
1oy3ur9,https://www.reddit.com/r/Nanny/comments/1oy3ur9/do_these_expectations_reasonably_align_with_a/,Do these expectations reasonably align with a nanny during travel? This is through an agency.,"Travel Expectations & Compensation Policy


General Travel Standards:
• All lodging, meals, excursions, tickets, transportation, and activities attended with the family are fully
covered.
• All meals are covered even during off-duty hours and paid rest days.
• The nanny is provided a private bedroom and private bathroom, separate from the children.
• The nanny will not be expected to share a room with the children under any circumstances.
• The nanny will not drive outside the United States.
• Maximum on-duty working limit while traveling is up to 12 hours per day, plus a 2-hour paid rest
break (total on-site presence up to 14 hours).
• Any excursion, outing, or activity the nanny attends with the family counts as on-duty time.
• International travel is permitted, but the nanny will not drive outside the U.S.

Guaranteed Hours While Traveling:
• All travel days and all days during the trip fall under guaranteed hours. This means the nanny
receives her normal daily/weekly hourly and overtime pay structure even if fewer hours are used.
• If the nanny’s standard weekly schedule includes overtime, the same overtime structure applies
automatically during travel, even if not utilized.

Hourly & Overtime Pay:
• All on-duty hours are paid at the nanny’s standard hourly rate.
• Hours worked beyond 40 in a week are paid at 1.5× the hourly rate.

Travel Day Fee:
• A $150–$250 travel day fee is applied per travel day, in addition to hourly and overtime pay. Amount is dependent on complexity and the volume of childcare needed. 
• A travel day includes flights, layovers, long-distance driving, airport navigation, luggage and gear
handling, boarding major transportation (plane, train, cruise, shuttle), and managing childcare needs
and transitions during transit.

Presence Fee (Off-Duty Compensation):
• A $100–$200 per-night presence fee is paid to compensate for being required to remain at the travel
destination, loss of personal freedom, overnight proximity, and evening availability, if needed.
• This fee compensates all off-duty hours during which the nanny must remain at the destination.

Active Overnight Compensation:
• If the nanny is required to wake up during the night for childcare duties, a minimum of 2 paid hours
is applied at the nanny’s hourly rate.
• Additional active time beyond that is paid at the hourly or overtime rate as applicable.
• If sleep loss exceeds one hour, a matching paid recovery period is provided the following morning.
• Recovery time is paid at the nanny’s normal hourly rate because it falls under guaranteed hours.
• The presence fee still applies.

On-Duty vs. On-Call vs. Off-Duty:
• On Duty: Actively responsible for childcare; paid hourly + overtime.
• On Call: Must be reachable and available; paid at half the hourly rate; presence fee still applies.
• Off Duty: Free personal time; may leave lodging but must remain within the destination;
compensated through the presence fee.

Daily Paid Rest Break
• One 2-hour paid rest break is required per day.
• Paid at the standard hourly rate.
• Does not reduce guaranteed hours and helps prevent burnout.

Paid Rest Day (For Extended Trips):
• For every 5 consecutive travel workdays, the nanny receives one fully paid rest day.
• Paid at the standard daily guaranteed hours.
• Meals remain covered; presence fee and stipend still apply.
• The nanny must remain within the travel destination.
• Does not replace PTO or interrupt guaranteed hours.

Return-Home Recovery Day:
• After completing a travel assignment, the nanny receives one paid recovery day on the next
scheduled workday, even if weekends fall between return and the next shift.
• Paid at the nanny’s standard daily guaranteed hours.
• This day is intended for rest, unpacking, physical recovery, catching up on sleep, and resetting
before returning to regular duties.

Personal-Use Travel Stipend
• A $50–$100 per-day stipend is provided for personal purchases such as snacks, toiletries, coffee,
and miscellaneous personal needs. Amount is dependent on trip duration and destination. 
• This stipend is not for child-related purchases.

Illness or Emergency Return-Home Policy:
• If the nanny becomes sick during travel, it is considered work-related due to high-exposure
environments, close contact with the child, and travel-related fatigue lowering immunity.
• The family covers return-home arrangements and guaranteed hours continue for the remainder of the contracted travel period.
• PTO is not used for work-related illness.
• If the nanny must return home early due to a true personal emergency, the day becomes a
work-cancellation period because it is outside the nanny’s control, and guaranteed hours continue for the remainder of the contracted travel dates.

Transportation & Vehicle Requirements:
• The nanny will not drive outside the United States.
• Rental cars must be insured and appropriate for safe child transport.
• The nanny will not be required to drive in unsafe or unfamiliar international environments. ",1,1763243141.0,Nanny,2,1.0,False
1oy3uoj,https://www.reddit.com/r/DogAdvice/comments/1oy3uoj/advice_on_dealing_with_an_over_friendly_dog/,Advice on dealing with an ‘over friendly dog’?,"
My partner and I are picking up our rescue dog in 2 days, yay! We did get to meet him prior to adopting, and have taken him on multiple outings to walk and play. 

He is about a year old, 80 pounds, and a weird mix of a lot of different things. 

He shows no aggression whatsoever so ever. Not with food, or toys, or other animals or people. 

However, he is almost too friendly/excited. We say that he is very well socialized but with no manners. 

This has become very clear while we try to walk him on a leash. He wants to say hi to every person, every dog. If something catches his attention it is close to impossible to get it back. And even if there is no one around, the pulling is insane, every walk is a full on sprint for him. He never relaxes. 

Part of me thinks it is possibly over stimulation due to being boarded at the shelter with SO many other dogs. Often he was in a big yard with other dogs or in a kennel. 

But I’m at a bit of a loss. It’s like he has had 10 cups of coffee, all the time. We once played fetch with him for 45 minutes, and he was still going at it. 

I’ve never met a dog like this. 

We are 100% going to put in the work (kennel train, all the commands, etc) and are doing the world’s slowest introduction to our cat. But he just has soooo much energy and loves everyone that it seems close to impossible to train him or get his attention. 

Any advice is much appreciated.

Well one why do I show these certain behaviors,
Is it related to antisocial personality disorder? Will I develop an antisocial personality disorder, is it temporary just as how I’ve speculated it?

Well 1: Now my in my developing phase I wasn’t super conscious, I was heavily dissociated from kindergarten to second grade following some trauma, as a kid I knew I was developing an archetype I had a short intuition, I knew low—key that I’m structuring myself as someone else due to my trauma, I’m changing my relationships, its effecting my brain elasticity, but I wasn’t always conscious about it, well I didn’t like rules either, I stole: my teachers phone, her coffee, her keys, I would bite people, I had tantrums and hurt myself a lot, and I just thought, I had something perfect for me ruined and I took things for granted and my life changed pretty hard. I still have feelings towards that but I diminish, compartmentalize, or short-fire all of them, it’s just stuff that I could be under really any circumstance of trauma but I just slowly developed into something “different” towards the end, I’ve lost a lot of my emotions, maintained my sensitive and kind disposition although that can really change quickly. To some dangerous, threatening, aggressive anger. That I’ve learned to just not at all react to things like that and those objects. Although past a certain age I’ve developed an even colder attitude and behavior with my outburst sometimes they’re just flat-out offender crimes. Kicked out of multiple elementary schools, middles schools, high schools. Got sent to juvie at 15 and diagnosed with conduct and schizoaffective disorders.

As for manipulation… I manipulated someone a few weeks ago, most of my relationships are practically manipulations, bully them and throw them out or just pedestalize them. Most of the time I try some short gratification scheme or I try my hardest to be kind because like I said I have a kind disposition. My last manipulation was just a few weeks ago, see well I was being scolded by a person, and I kinda thought they would hit me, so I changed the subject to white wall paint, changed the context to my ethnicity, twisted it around, and left him same place with a different conclusion, and I topped it off by leaning to the left holstering my hand on my chin and cheeks and then smiling, this was me showing my “true personality” as a way to scare him off when really it’s just a type of nature projection thing, but I guess it really exudes a lot of emotional intelligence, uhm other times I’ve created multiple schemes for people who were in relationships with me, like take all their money, “accidentally” set their house on fire, show my true self and then walk away to a different girlfriends house. Like DEADASS my mind just sorta does that when it has the chance. Other times it’s just relationship acquiring or just relationship mind games, my criminal behavior? Well I’m not like the average antisocial type over here with criminal versatility but every school I was at I was one of the worst kids in some sort erratic or unique way. Other times when I manipulate it’s actually kinda good, it’s to stop people from acting a certain type of way that I don’t like so I just condition it out of them. Make it better or “Let people gain resources from people who operate like me” that stuff which I really used to relate to. I don’t really know my qualities actually all really just “press” down and I never actually.
13-I was manipulative, I tried to take over a games Discord group and turn it into my own regime, I tried to use a friend into making me seem “perfect” and then crushing him and showing him exactly how people could be, and if I put a little more thought to it I just show him how everyone even in his family have certain patterns. That’s how I imagine it 😅 I also tried the same nature rojection effect thing so I could get a girl to make her think I was perfect.
14–I was a manipulative bully, I mean—uncaring cold, calculating, sorta logistic, patterns, smooth with charm, applying it whenever I got into trouble, applying it to ingratiate, applying it to just do a lot of things. I was like a mix of coldness and sensitivity and I suppose ‘normalcy?’ But that all isn’t right at all. Embarrassing healthcare workers with manipulation
So here;
I liked to peel apart peoples defenses, I sorta conned people out their “phone time” as comical as it sounds, I tried to look empathetic in front of the whole gym, I liked to peel apart everything people would do, I would do a lot of things just got the fun of it.
15-I was the “jail fighter” even as a joke, even seriously, even as a pass time, it’d be “corner.” one word to really start throwing em dukes, And I didn’t care at all with it and went beyond a lot of standards, like “damn—that motherfucker don’t give a shit, or this guy hits too hard” and I sorta lost some of my fighting skills over the years I went sorta delusional for a period because over time people told me I was “one of a kind” for my traits and one of a kind for having such a balance, and in a superlative way I feebly named of a list of qualities and they agreed and that was my status and that’s just how people could really love me back then.
Umm now I’m totally not committing the same crimes, not in the same headspace like before at all, kinda still doing some of these things (manipulation) but I’ve never went to juvie for years, I’ve only did like one threat a year ago but it got contextualized and i didn’t get any punishments for it. 

About criminal versatility, I’ve stolen, I’ve accessed shit I wasn’t supposed to, I’ve committed assaults, I’ve embarrassingly enough stalked and harassed but I was 14 and couldn’t really stop it, I’ve also broken peoples windows, I’ve pushed people, I’ve fought and lost some, being sneaked, I’ve stabbed a family member, I broke things, I broke a security officers nose, when I felt for my safety I’ve grabbed knives and would hold them for quite some time, I threw a chair at my teacher a metal legged small one in 3rd grade, I’ve done a countless amount of things.

The prattle of rain sang sweetly as if a choir of hopeful children ran among the dry and dreary alleys. Yet, as if in a frolic of hide-and-seek, the perspiration never embraces the begging streets of downtown Kethar. Stopped by the moisture nets that tell lies of ''perpetual energy.'' And to punctuate its deceptions of hope and prosperity, the only children of the Soot District can be found within its coal kilns—their only songs- the acquiescent silence of a childhood lost.

The constable shadowed along the cracked pavement streets of the district. Its asphalt, tortured by thirst, was blanketed by a layer of coal soot. The vents seemed to never lack in supply, and one would be well-challenged to exist here with a healthy lung. For the chimneys were not allowed to release contaminants above those false nets of hope, which covered the City of Rain, as a mother would a pillow, in hopes of sparing her offspring from the torments of life.

'A lie shall remain a lie' The detective growled, his ribs aching, as he raised his mouthguard over his nose. He had lived here his whole life, and no matter his 40 years of effort, his home ever-still remained just that- Home. And so is the 'lie' of Kethar, ever to remain a never-changing 'lie' of the future.

The wooden boards creaked as the detective made the perilous climb to his second-story apartment, emphasizing each step of the one-and-a-half dozen steps with a hiss.

Reaching the door, he willed his prosthetic arm into motion, as its scratched copper surface creaked around the object in his overcoat pocket. Removing the key from its containment, he unlocked the door, and a slight hiss could be heard among the gears of the metal appendage. The steam valves squeaked their last moments.

With a twist of the steam-powered wrist, the detective entered his place of rest—a place completely devoid of dreariness—his wife and her sense of decor made sure of that. In contrast to the black and gray of the outside, the apartment brandished blue, white, and even pink. One might expect whiplash upon first entry. Which is what, even after nearly 2 decades of married life, the investigator experienced upon every return. It always put a smile on his face.

Even tonight.

He removed his leather boots. The very ones his wife bought a size too big for when ''retirement makes him lazy'', and wiped them clean. With a care one might have shown to a child, he made sure they were dry and clean, as if never worn, and placed them in their usual spot.

He hung his coat on the radiator, and for a second, he wished for a smoke. By the Lord, he wished for one. But a district-wide dust combustion was not worth a puff of tobacco.

The constable adjusted his belt under his- to his wife's dismay- expanding belly, and took a breath, feeling his rib expand and separate from his lung's ministration. He growled in pain as he wiped the sweat from his thinning hair.

Staying as silent as possible for a man his size in this hour of sleep, he peeked within his bedroom, and upon his wife's peaceful, yet lone visage. Her blond hair flowed along the contours of an eternally youthful face. With a solemn smile, his fleshy fingers reached within the room to silently grab his maintenance box, feeling the fading tingle of his prosthetic.

The man returned to the living room couch and slowly, laboriously, lowered his form onto the cushions. Taking out his instruments, a wax-like salve, and a fresh heating element, he began work on his metallic appendage, which he had found to be, ironically, more fragile than flesh.

Using a specially designed screwdriver, commonly called a 'key', he disabled the arm's remaining function. After a minute of a cooling period, he removed the old, damaged heating element and replaced it with a spare.

The element was a revolutionary device, which could harness each morsel of heat from a coal, sulfur, and oil mixture, once administered. Undamaged, it could safely heat the steam-driven mechanism for a year, provided a sufficient amount of water was present.

After replacing the heart of the appendage and refilling its water supply, the detective examined the dents and scratches across the prosthetic. With a sneer, he applied the salve upon the metal surface, and with another twist of the 'key', his right arm came to life with a slow, warming humm.

''Piece of junk...'' The detective spat, feeling the slow return of his mobility. With his fleshy left hand, he reached for his drink cabinet and took out a glass and a bottle of scotch. Yet with the rising warmth of his arm, the comfort of the couch, and the exhaustion in the evening, came together as if a prosecutor, enforcing a law of prohibition from ages past.

The sleuth of a professional fell asleep, putting the evening behind him. His head cocked back, and he began to snore. And the untasted glass of scotch fell out of the man's hand.

The spirit brew moistened the floor, but it would evaporate come morning, cleansing the floor along with it.

 

''Gabe... Gabe. GABE!'' The law officer awoke with a tug on his shoulder. A jolt of pain made him grunt, but identifying the disturber, he eased into his usual simper.

''Yes, dear?'' His chalky voice rose into a pleasing octave. A gentle, unarmed approach he always took when conversing with his beloved.

''You've made a mess, you drunk.'' The homemaker gently pushed on her husband's chin, drawing his attention to the fallen glass of now-evaporated scotch. Her foreign accent, even after all these years in Kethar, still seeped through. These days, the ladies of high society would consider that sophisticated-sounding.

''You've also got a ring from Mr. Lewis.'' She said, pointing towards the small coffee table, with the wired device, known as a telephone. ''Says it's urgent.'' A slight worry appeared on her soft facial features. For a second, the husband wondered how he could ever get so lucky as to be blessed with a soulmate so divine.

''The Cheif Constbale?''

''URGENT!'' His wife emphasized the weight of the matter by pulling him up by his left arm, off the couch. The pain in his ribs made him mutter 'bollocks', to which he got a moment of scolding for swearing in the house. He understood, however, that his wife never saw fit to touch his metallic body part. It's also why he always took the right side of the bed.

''Newell speaking.'' Eventually, reaching the telecommunication device, he picked up the sound piece and put it to his ear, placing the transmitter to his lips, he spoke. ''How can I help you, Chief?''

The answer was almost immediate.

''Newell! I need you to get to The Bronze Heights. Kefernson Street 1!''

''The Grand Theatre?''

''The very same! Get here as soon as bloody possible!'' The sound through these devices usually came out muffled and scratchy, like a record whose needle goes astray. Yet the Head of Kethar's law enforcement was heard clearly. ''There's been a murder!''

''Who?'' Yet before the detective received an answer, the last thing exchanged from the other side of the call was the acronym 'ASAP'. The call went silent.

''What was it about?'' His wife, ever curious, put away the mop and inquired. The detective held the device for a moment too long. ''Dear? Worry set in her voice as she brought her hands to her chest.

''It's nothing.'' In a swift motion, and a bit too much force, Gabe threw the device back onto the small table. ''Just work.''

A swift turn, a wide stride, and a pained, yet just as hasty bend later, the constable grabbed his damp coat from the radiator, slipped into his work boots, and was out the door. Stairboards creaking under his rushing weight.

''Be... Be careful.'' His wife called behind him. Her fingertips touched her lips as the echo of the shut doors rang out into silence. It has been a while, if ever, since her husband had left for work without a goodbye kiss.

 

''All Aboard! All Aboard!'' The inter-city railway conductor beckoned the steam cart passengers to board its platform. The transport covered the city's 7 main districts, with each stop leading to the next. Its final destination- The Bronze Heights. Yet, of course, the railway dared not venture into the Soot District.

The detective nearly missed the morning race as he wiped the salty sweat from his brow.

''No luggage, sir?'' Asked the bag boy, just returning from helping an old woman load 3 bags of fabrics and bread.

''Does it look like I have luggage?'' The investigator, sounding more brash than he had wished, strode past the boy and onto the platform. His prosthetic fingers clinked against the metal railing. The heat from the 40 bodies and the man's lack of cardio only increased the amount of precipitation on his forehead and did not help his racing heart.

''The Grand Theatre... Bloody hell...''

The one saving grace of this morning was that, in about 3 stops, he would finally be able to light a smoke. A habit, he reckoned, did him no favours either.

The Bronze District was what a scholar or traveler would think when hearing the name of Kethar, The City of Rain. Railways in every direction. Fresh asphalt and the latest inventions in transport, architecture, and fashion painted in copper, gold, and, of course, bronze gave the district its name. From buildings to its constructs, the theme of 'The Metal of Progress' was blinding. Mostly in part due to its most distinguishing feature- An open sky. The only district without the rain nets allowed the sun to reflect off the polished bronze roofs into the eyes of the beholder.

Gabe Newell, not necessarily a famous, yet still a well-known investigator, made his way down the pristine copper streets. Any puddles from last night were already absorbed by the lush grass or siphoned into the drainage, which would take it to the filtration stations, and finally, into the steam kilns. A system one could call the very blood stream of Kethar.

''You stjupid maschina!'' He passed a wealthy foreigner, who cursed one of this city's latest inventions- A steam clockwork automaton. A machine advertised as one for menial tasks had dropped, what appeared to be an item of great value and greater fragility.

A machine, whose use will soon be revolutionized to ''broaden'' this cities horizon.

Sir Freidrich Von'Frivald was the visionary behind these advancements. A man who, famously, founded Kethar, yet near immediately distanced himself from the governing board, stating 'I have a mind for progress and money, not politics!' Yet the truth of the matter was that he was the one who influenced everything in this city, and most likely, nothing happened without his approval. And all that did happen was never traced back to him. A monarch without a crown.

Yet those more unfortunate may as well call him a Tyrant...

 

''You're late, Newell!'' The chief barked at the detective, who just had to go through 30 minutes of layers upon layers of security, just to get into the halls of The Grand Theatre, which had now become a more restricted area than the Bronze Palace.

''Sorry. I nearly missed the place, what with all the guards making it look so unassuming.''

''Keep your sarcasm.'' The chief constable barked, having no sense of humor at the moment. ''We may as well be on the cusp of an apocalypse here.''

''That bad?''

''It's bloody horrific.'' The head officer led the detective to a VIP room on the 3rd floor.

''Who's the victim?'' Yet the inquiry was met with silence.

After clearing another layer of security, they were led into the VIP lounge, where 3 forensics agents were already taking notes of the scene of the crime.

''The worst possible one...'' The chief answered a question asked 10 minutes in the past, as he pointed to the corpse of Sir Freidrich Von'Frivald. The very same one, whose face was plastered onto every enterprise and commercial in this city. The very same who created this very city. The visionary. The inventor. And now, the omen of this city's demise.

''Well, damn...'' The detective stated, observing the scene with tension, already taking a step into the room.

''You must be Investigator Nowell, correct?'' A younger man, perhaps in his mid-twenties, dressed in a black, tieless suit, appeared in Gabe's line of vision, startling him for a second. He grabbed to guard his ribs, only to notice the young man extend his hand for a shake.

''I am Victor. A pleasure.'' The younger man gave a smile, yet his visage betrayed the artificiality behind it. He looked pale, as if ill of some kind of diphtheria or another fever disease. Or perhaps... grief.

''The pleasure is all mine...'' The detective, regaining his poise, gripped the younger man's hand, metal grasping flesh, yet if not for the chief's intervention, their eye contact may have become uncomfortably long.

''I see you've already met.'' The head constable approached the two gentlemen as their hands came apart. ''This here young fella is Victor-''

''Just Victor is fine, Ser Lewis.''

''As you wish.'' The younger man raised his hand to stop the chief and continued in his stead.

''I am here to assist in your investigation, Mr. Nowell. I will try not to hinder your work.''

The older detective squinted at the suggestion. No, that was more of a statement.

''And may I ask for your qualifications?'' He looked between the young man and the officer in charge, crossing his meaty arm over his metallic appendage.

''I... have worked in forensics prior to taking a more leisurely approach to crime fighting. A detective for fun, so to say.'' The young man gave a grim, yet once more, artificial smile, fishing out a black business card, with an interwoven 'V' and 'F' as its logo. ''I lead a whole agency and everything.''

Gabe took the card and examined it before looking to his executive. ''Are we seriously bringing in civvies in a case of this scale?''

''He's a bright kid.'' The lead officer scratched the back of his neck, holding his officer's cap in his other hand. ''And besides. He has a vested... interest in this case. Out of my control.''

The detective examined his boss. His demeanor alone told enough. This young fellow had been sent by the governing body, which means that they were already aware of Sir Von'Frivald's demise.

Unless...

''With that said,'' the young man spoke again, ''I once more would like to express a wish for our successful cooperation on this case, Mr. Nowell. Please, show me how proper officers deal with villainy in this city!'' The fake smiles of this youngster had begun to irk the older detective.

''As if I could refuse. And it's 'Newel' not 'Nowel'. I'm not bronze-blooded.''

''Ah, my apologies.'' The younger of the two did a gentlemanly bow, and expressed an apology which painted his true feelings for once- He couldn't care less.

''What did the guards say?'' Gabe asked after surveying the VIP room of the theatre. It was decorated similarly to a one-man-bougie living room. From the couch to a wine closet, along with a platter of snacks. Wealth was woven into the very fibers of the carpet under their feet. ''I assume he had guards on duty? As a matter of fact, when was he discovered?''

''Supposedly, the... victim had wished not to be disturbed when viewing the concert, so they were stationed by the door, and only found him as such, an hour after the play. So, roughly half past eleven.'' Chief Lewis answered, with a sigh, ''Can't wait for the shitshow this news will bring about. Prepare to work overtime, Gabe. The public will demand justice no later than yesterday!''

''Then don't announce it sooner than tomorrow.'' The Head Constable let out a spurt of air at his subordinate's remark.

''Not my call to make. But we'll leave you boys to it. Come on! You've taken notes aplenty!'' Mr. Lewis left, beckoning the 3 forensic inspectors with him, leaving the room for Gabe and his now silent shadow.

The detective began limping around the room, examining the furniture, walls, the balcony, and the drop from it. After about 2 rounds of silence, he finally approached the couch and the small bedside table with a candle on it. The place where the victim limply sat, his wine glass spilled on the couch cushions, and the opera glasses were engulfed by the fluffy carpet.

''How exactly did the guards not hear the commotion?'' The detective broke the silence with an introspective question.

''Pardon?'' The young man, a smile still about, inquired further, as he will aim to do so forth.

''There was clearly a struggle. Perhaps not a loud one, but the bedside table was knocked over. Someone must have heard it. Not to mention the bronze candlestand hitting the floor.''

''How so?''

''Firstly, the victim now sits an uncomfortable distance away from said table. One would sit an arm's reach away, yet he has either been moved to the other side of the couch, or the table has been unwittingly replaced too far. Notice how the wine glass has been spilled on the cushion on the other side of the couch.'' The detective pointed with a lax wrist, painting the scene of a struggle.

''So you reckon this was set up, almost like a scene in a play, to appear as if nothing was wrong?''

''Not as if nothing's wrong, but just natural enough for an uncompromising escape.'' The detective picked up a nearby litter basket and began to rummage through it.

''And look here. A tissue covered in wax. Notice how the candle, even while half burned, has no molten wax either under the wick nor in the candle stand. At least not half a candle's worth.'' The young man picked up the hardened tissue and seemed to compare the color with the candle, slightly nodding, yet unsurprised.

''The carpet also has a slight burn. Most likely, where the still-burning wick lost its spark. I see what you are seeing, detective.''

''Then tell me, how did the struggle go unheard?'' The young man did not speak, so the detective, taking a moment, walked to the edge of the balcony and looked up. ''I reckon it was the rain. I heard that the Bronze District had a mighty thunderstorm last night. I'd imagine, accompanied by the concert and its acoustics, the storm provided plenty of sound cover.''

''There was no thunder yestereve, detective. However, the concert is now known as the ''Loudest Play'' ever produced in Litriny. Some visitors even joked- their wives had finally grown silent.'' The young man stated with an ounce of humor, after tossing the waxed tissue back into the trash bin.

''So it checks out.''

''Yet how could the perpetrator know? This was the first showing.''

''Got lucky.''

''You do not believe it was planned?''

''It was most likely a crime of passion. The act was planned, but the consequence was left for fate to decide.''

''Say, detective? Why are you so eager to jump over that balcony?''

''Pardon?'' The conversation abruptly stopped, as a dark giggle escaped the young man.''

''My apologies. You simply keep circling back to it, and I couldn't help but imagine... Pardon me, Mr Nowell. I've been told my sense of humor can come across as demented.'' The detective sighed, and carefully removed himself from the balcony edge, tossing one last look over the 3 man drop down.

''That does, however, beg the question.'' The young man continued. ''How did the criminal escape? Better yet- how did he get by the guards?''

''That is why I've been examining the balcony.'' The detective spoke in slight annoyance.

''Ah, I see.'' The young man clapped his hands. ''So the perpetrator climbed in and climbed out of the balcony. Is that it?''

''Most likely case.''

''The cover of darkness during the concert would certainly give that opportunity. But say, why would the victim not call for the guards seeing a figure loom over a balcony triple a man's height? I sure would.''

''Perhaps he didn't make it in time? He had also been indulging in alcohol. not uncommon-''

''You fought in the Battle of Kerfus, correct?'' The young man threw an unrelated inquiry into the mix. Not an unknown technique to the older investigator.

Still, the topic unnerved him. His fleshy hand gripped the bronze on the other.

''May I ask for relevance?''

''You did, didn't you? I simply ask because I noticed your prosthetic. Military-issued, correct? For returning veterans.'' The constable stayed silent.

''Sir Von'Frivald also served, if I am correct. And judging from his own right arm,'' The man gently lifted the victim's right sleeve to uncover a bronze arm, not unlike Gabe's own. The difference being that it held more plating, and the thumb and first 2 digits were sharpened to a point, for engineering delicacy, ''Was no less a veteran like yourself, Mr Nowell.''

''He's the one who issued them. Point being?''

''Being a War Hero, perhaps he deemed it preferable to deal with the threat himself?''

''Ain't no 'Hero's' in war, youngster!'' The detective snapped. ''Hell can't create something as fairy tale as a 'Hero', understand?''

''I suppose you are right. Back to the matter at hand, however. It appears as though the cause of death was strangling. You see these marks here?'' The young man moved the disheveled collar of the body to showcase a blueish-red bruise snaking around the victim's neck. ''And look here. A burn. Not a severe burn but a burn nonetheless...''

As the boy looked at the corpse, he suddenly grew silent. His everlasting smile faded as he now looked at the peacefully resting face. The detective could not see the young man's face, but he saw his shoulders give a slight tremble.

''He was killed by a prosthetic arm, is what I wished to conclude to you, detective. The burn is from the heating metal of the steam conductor in the mechanism.''

''Are you alright-''

''Ever more, notice the fingers,'' The boy gently raised the victim's prosthetic palm, pointing out the 2 sharpened digits. ''Barely visible, but there are marks of soot and oil. The... victim was a man who knew his own invention. I'm sure he would've struck to disable the device's weak point.''

''You believe him to be so accurate?''

''I've spent my youth at mechanical workshops, believe it or not. This is a minuscule amount of soot and oil one would get without causing damage, much less of a damaged mechanism. The murderer wiped them.'' There was a tinge of anger in the boy's voice, but he swallowed it, along with whatever else was building up in his throat.

''Could Sir Von'Frivald simply have had them dirty, to begin with. He was an engineer himself.''

''My apologies, detective, but for the first time, I must exclaim that you speak nonsense. A man of his caliber would never come to an event such as this with oily hands.''

''Perhaps he made a mistake. Would it not be logical even for him to make an error? Perhaps he was in a rush''

''Perhaps. If that were the case... None of the cushions or wine glass have a slick of oil nor a speck of soot on them. He must've wiped it beforehand. It would only reason then, that he would have...'' The young man went straight to the coat rack and plucked a handkerchief from its inner pocket. A handkerchief with stains of oil and soot. He froze for a moment. His seeming 'Eureka' moment stolen.

''Ser Victor?''

''Where is the bottle?''

''Pardon?''

''There is a wine glass, but no bottle. Doesn't it seem unusual for one to drink wine, yet have no bottle to pour it from?''

''There is a wine cabinet.''

''No, no, good detective. Have you known the Bronze-Blooded to drink only one glass of wine? Much less walk from one corner of the room to the other for a refill?''

The detective squinted and bent down to check under the couch or the aforementioned wine cabinet. Nothing.

''You seem to share the same shoe size.'' Stated the young man, offhandedly. ''Size 7, is it?''

''Size 8.'' The detective grunted as the young fellow helped him get up. ''And no bottle.''

''So another set-up, huh?'' The young man gripped the detective's shoulder. For just a second too long.

''Perhaps.'' Being uncomfortable, the detective detached himself and walked to the wine cabinet. Pretending to look over the beverages, he reached for one of the open ones.

''It's the red one. The Mist's Kiss.'' The younger investigator froze the detective's hand. ''I recognize the tinge and aroma. One of my personal favorites.''

''Would you really think in a setup so meticulous, the perpetrator would make such an oversight?'' The detective inquired, as the bottle changed hands.

''Certainly. You said it yourself- the man saw this as a one-way road. Yet once the play began to dull the senses, only then did he see an opportunity for escape.'' He stated, creating a fresh stain on the cushion next to the old one. And after a second or two, they matched.

''So you agree this was a crime of passion?''

''Of sorts.'' Victor placed the bottle next to the candle. ''You also seem to agree with me that the murderer is a man?''

''The fair gender would likely be less successful. I believe it natural to assume.''

''How many have you killed, Mr Nowell?''

''Pardon?''

''Men. How many men have you killed? You were a soldier after all.'' The young man looked him dead in the eye.

''One.'' The detective answered undisturbed.

''Only? Who?''

''The one who took my arm.''

The younger man let out a giggle. ''So instead of 'an eye for an eye' it's 'a life for an arm'? My apologies, I jest! I merely joke.'' Yet there was no humor behind his flaccid smile. ''Yet, I've heard of many who would simply shoot in the air, and return home with a clear conscience. Not a notch on their belt.''

''Then those you may call 'Heros'.''

''I suppose it would only be fitting. And my apologies. The question arose, as I noticed both of you had a similar sense of overcoats.''

''It's no more than a leather officer's coat. Your point?''

''It's just that I had thought that maybe the victim had arrived late, and the murderer was already in the room, hiding. You see, these leather coats were notorious, as you no doubt remember, for hardening after drying them of moisture. Something about improper leather care or some such. But the victim's coat hangs dry, soft, and proper. The rain began to fall soon after the play began.''

''It is a Lieutenant's coat, Ser Victor. We never shared such a station.''

''Yet the manufacture is the same. Point being...''

The detective scoffed and walked to the balcony again. He sighed.

''It is likely the victim arrived on time, as you say. And most probably, the murderer simply had an early entry.''

''My thoughts exactly.'' Stated the young man, walking up next to the grizzled detective, as both looked down. ''And a decently painful exit to boot.''

Both gazed out into the concert hall. Mere hours ago, it was filled with cheers, music, and a multitude of other turbulence. Yet now it stood empty. Almost like an omen- a quiet before a storm.

''I believe we are done here.'' Stated the detective, pushing away from the railing.

''You do not take notes?''

''No. Forensics already did.''

''How quaint. Neither do I.''

''Yes. Very fascinating.''

''Before you go, detective. May I present what I believe happened here? I wish to hear a veteran's wisened opinion.''

''Suit yourself.'' The older man turned and reached for a smoke.

''Thank you, Mr Nowell.'' Putting his hands behind him, the pale youngster began to pace the room. ''What we have here is a crime of passion. The passion of those who have deemed their suffering unjust, and have decreed the victim of this murder the cause. No doubt, the motive was the recent news of the steam clockwork automatons being drafted into the military forces, instead of replacing the human workers in the more laborious job positions.''

The detective paused, forgetting to light his smoke.

''The perpetrator was a man, and most likely, a military veteran with a prosthetic. Knowing of the victim's fascination with theatre productions and concerts, he was aware he would make an appearance here, at this production. And, logically speaking, there would only be one seat he would dare take- The VIP balcony. So he snuck in preemptively. Perhaps hours before the victim's arrival. He had resolved himself to a suicide mission.''

The detective listened... intently.

''As the victim took a seat and ordered his guards outside the room, the focus of projectors towards the stage gave the murderer the perfect cover of darkness to strike. A plan slightly foiled by the candlelight, for the victim, was a man who worked on his designs even during such events. Designs, as you may notice, detective, are nowhere to be seen.''

The detective's hand slid into an empty pocket of his trench coat.

''What drives you to such a conclusion?''

''Intuition...'' Ser Victor answered, after a silence, one may describe feeling melancholic. ''Where they have gone, who's to say. Point is, however, the criminal struck and strangled Sir Von'Frivald, with practiced ease and composure. Something one would acquire via specialized training. Perhaps in a military setting. Yet, unexpectedly, the victim fought back and caused a malfunction in the metal appendage. Unfortunately... too little too late.''

The detective lit his smoke. ''If you need my opinion on that, you are-''

''I am not finished, Mr Nowell. After the murder had occurred, the perpetrator noticed how no one had come to the victim's rescue, so an idea came to mind. With a few conveniently placed clues and an improbable scenario, a setup was created of a struggle and conveniently unresponsive guards. An idea easy to sell to unseasoned policemen. A scene that would leave the only viable perpetrators- the very guards who failed at their job. And the unassuming setup would serve to give plenty of time for a speedy escape. All that was left was a leap of faith.'' The young man mimicked a jumping motion over the balcony.

''Bravo. Is that all?'' Tired of listening, the detective asked, snuffing out his smoke in a portable ashtray.

''Indeed. By chance have I missed something?''

''An assumption you've made doesn't fit the story. The scene setup has flaws. The bottle. The table placement, not to mention body placement, as well as minor details such as the wax tissue. It wouldn't take too much observation to deem it a setup.''

''Perhaps that was the point.'' The young man said, not changing his expression. ''A Red Herring of sorts. A false lead. Smoke and mirrors.''

''To what end?''

''No clue.''

The young man smiled, and the two gentlemen held each other's gaze for a second, as the door burst open, and the Chief Constable Lewis barged in.

''They found size 9 footprints by the back window. I reckon male. Any theories you boys come up with? The crowd is getting way too curious, and you can only hide the city's missing figurehead for so long. Do we at least have a suspect? Come on, boys, tell me you have SOMETHING! I ain't asking for magic, but...''

To the head constables' despair, the two investigators looked at each other, as the younger one spoke.

''Not quite. But we're getting there. I would like to see those footprints if you don't mind.''

''Sure. Be quick with it!''

''Cheif!'' Gabe called to the departing Officer. ''I think I'm going home for today. I'm feeling under the weather, and this young fella seems plenty competent. He can give you the full report as well, as he's the one who put the stuff together anyway.''

''You serious? Fine! Scram! We need to figure this out fast!'' And so the Chief Lewis rushed off. The sound of the journalists banging on the doors had begun to sound like a concert of its own.

''While the trail is still hot.'' The young man chimed as he followed the grizzled detective away from the crime scene, leaving it for the forensics and guards.

''Are you injured?'' Suddenly asked the young man, not even 10 steps from the VIP balcony.

''No more than a war injury. Rare, one does not come back with one of those.'' Without looking, Gabe threw back an answer.

''Say, were you speaking the truth?'' The young man asked once more, right before their paths split.

''Pardon?''

''The men you've killed. Are you certain of your answer?'' Victor looked into Gabes' eyes like a cat might look at a mouse. Except staring back at him was a mouse most vicious.

''I have taken the life of one man, Ser Victor. And I have no plans to expand my roster. Is that clear?''

The detective spoke the truth.

''As the reflection of the Bronze Palace, good detective.'' The younger man clapped the investigator on the shoulder with enough force to trigger his broken ribs. Something which Gabe suspected to be on purpose.

''We will see each other again, Mister Nowell. Perhaps sooner than you think.''

''It's 'Newell' you little shit...'' But the sharp shadow was already gone, far enough not to hear the veterans' grumbled complaint.

 

Pushing past the guards and ignoring journalist after journalist, the day had once more turned bleak. Clouds were building up once more, as the steam from the city's beating and pumping engines was about to return to earth. The promise of eternal energy was just above their heads. Like some Storm God preparing for a blessing.

Gabe Newell was on his way home. The long walk he had chosen, instead of the steam railway, was deliberate. Who knows how long he will be able to enjoy such freedom. He didn't expect it to be long.

He examined the bronze streets and buildings, the inhabitants of this city. Both from the wealthy districts, as well as those more unfortunate. Soon enough, this city will change. It already has been, but like a malfunctioning engine, the unjust mechanisms of this city will explode. And where the cogs fly- that was not Gabes' problem anymore.

''A lie shall remain a lie...''

With a light of his last smoke, Gabe Newell entered the Soot District. A place history books will call ''The Bed of Revolution''.

I am looking to buy my first espresso machine. I am located in Montreal, Canada. Price is in CAD.  
I'm pretty noob, even though I used to sub for the barista in a nice coffee place a few years ago, where my interest in espresso grew.  
I joined pictures of the options I'm considering :  
Mokitas, La pavoni, Gaggia (seems like an old model) or Angeli.

I'm open to any other suggestions but these are the available one near me on marketplace. I would go for the La Pavoni for it's look but also because it was recently serviced and looks like the newest one. I don't want to spend to much so I can buy a nice grinder and other things as well.

Prepare for a yap session, but please please read because I need help with this
So basically, this summer I started having symptoms of dysautonomia and was diagnosed with POTS. I am a male (I know it’s rare with pots) and I am in pretty good shape so my pots really hasn’t interfered with my life too much. I’ve never passed out or experienced any weakness from the pots (just extra fatigue if anything). However, shortly after I was diagnosed with POTS, I noticed my brain was starting to get pretty foggy and I was starting to feel really sleepy all the time. At one point this summer I tried to quit caffeine so I figured that was it and started drinking caffeine again, however caffeine really did nothing for me besides increase my heart rate. However, over a period of about a month, the sleepiness got WAY worse. I was sleeping for ten hours a day, and during the day I would have these episodes where I’d get SUPER sleepy (brain fog would get intense, fatigue got bad) and it would continue on until I would sit down and take a 15 minute nap. After 15 minutes I would wake up very refreshed until I had another sleepiness episode. This was happening DAILY. I started having nighttime hallucinations, and I would often wake up in the middle of the night in half reality/half REM where I would be awake in my room but also I would see everything in my dream in my room with me. I was fully aware that I was hallucinating and dreaming and I would literally slap myself in the face trying to stop the vivid dreaming/hallucinations and go back to sleep. It was extremely difficult and I’d usually have to watch TikTok for a few minutes to break out of it. Around this time, I had a sleepover with my girlfriend and she told me in the morning that while I was asleep I looked like I was trying to grab things in my dream or do some kind of action in my dream, which I thought was odd. I did some research, and chatgpt (pls don’t bully me lmao) told me to go see a sleep neurologist (I had been evaluated earlier in the year for possible multiple sclerosis but results were inconclusive) so I went and he got me a sleep study. I tested positive for idiopathic hypersomnia and he put me on armoodafinil, which has helped a lot. Recently, I took a drug holiday for just a day because I wanted to let myself get some rest (the modafinil was really strong at first and I was sacrificing sleep because I couldn’t stop being productive). That day I was working (I work at a coffee shop) and a customer came through the line and kept giggling in between words when we had a full line of cars. For reference, annoyance is probably the emotion I feel the strongest. I have a huge attitude and I am easily pissed off. This time, however, when I got annoyed I also felt this strange feeling of weakness, and while I didn’t fall or anything crazy like that, I just had this feeling as if my body got really heavy. I thought I was going to drop my tablet or trip into the persons car, but thankfully that didn’t happen. I figured maybe I was just hungry and starting to get weak. Over the next hour, I got annoyed at a couple more customers and noticed that I was still getting that strange feeling of weakness whenever I got really annoyed. Again, I figured it was nothing, so I just got off work and ate some food later on that day. All of that shit brings me to yesterday, when I was at work yet again taking orders, and another customer made me annoyed. As she was talking to me, I went to respond and I noticed that it was really really hard to talk. After a couple seconds I was able to talk again and I just apologised and continued the order. I ended up calling my neurologist and I set an appointment for next Monday to talk with him about it. Today I was working again, and everything was fine (I even got annoyed at a couple people without getting weak) but then I got this weird sensation in my back and in my arms and legs, and it felt like when I was having that sensation I was more susceptible to getting that feeling of weakness. I noticed that the days before when I had the weakness episodes, I also was feeling that sensation which would make me more vulnerable to getting suddenly weak. 
To tie back to the beginning, I did some research and saw that pots and N1 have a very high comorbidity, as the cells destroyed in n1 also produce chemicals to help regulate autonomic nervous system function. However, I guess im wondering if what I’m feeling REALLY IS cataplexy or if im just blowing this all out of proportion. I really need help because I keep second guessing. In my head, I figure that I might be overreacting because while I do get weak, I’ve never collapsed or fallen or dropped an item, plus I’ve ONLY noticed it when I get annoyed. Anyways, thanks so much for the help, it’s been a hard year full of confusion and im desperate for some answers.

Life is funny. I always thought marriage would just happen on its own. You grow up. You get your life together. One day you meet someone whose vibe is so soft and comforting that you just know. But apparently my story includes me typing this into Reddit dot com so here we are.

Anyway. About me.
I am from Pakistan. Currently studying Software Engineering which sounds cooler than it feels because half the time I am just praying for my CGPA to stay alive. I am moving to Dubai next month to work with my uncle and basically start the real adult chapter of my life. I am serious about building something halal stable and intentional for my future family. I want a marriage that is peaceful and safe and feels like home.

Personality wise I am a mix of calm but chaotic. I love  kickboxing tech cars bikes drifting touring questioning my life and occasionally pretending I am the main character in a cinematic montage. I am working on getting in best shap possible and am actually  pretty close to it. Trying to get toned and get abs so at least my wife gets some perks(i don't even know why she needs them on me).

I want to get married young. Not in a desperate way but in a why wait for something beautiful if Allah allows it kind of way. I want all the things that normally sound hella boring(just because i have that energy to turn boring things into enjoyable activity), someone whose presence feels gentle. Someone who has a soft heart a good mind and a desire to build a sincere halal life together. Someone who wants loyalty peace companionship trust cute adventures late night talks morning coffees inside jokes shared dreams and a home that feels like sakoon not chaos and blah blah blah......

I do not care about your past(i genuinely do not care). I care about your today and your direction. You can be studying working figuring life out or in a transition season. I do not expect perfection. I want sincerity effort kindness and the willingness to grow together. I want a girl who is loving respectful emotionally mature playful when comfortable and fully committed to making a strong relationship.

I want the kind of income where my wife never has to stress about stability ever again. I have big goals and I want someone whose eyes shine when she talks about her own goals too.

Whoever Allah wrote for me I know she exists somewhere laughing eating scrolling through her phone probably not knowing that her rizq in the form of a man who loves bikes and coffee who is typing this post right now.

If you are reading this and it makes your heart feel warm or familiar you can message me. Maybe this is how our story starts.

If not then I will just quietly delete this and pretend it never happened. ",2,1763242080.0,MuslimNikah,1,1.0,False

1oy3f24,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1oy3f24/kids_are_scary/,Kids are scary,"I was on the road for around three hours before I decided to stop somewhere and grab a bite to eat. I was always told to try to take breaks on long car rides because of the dangers of falling asleep at the wheel. A sign for an upcoming exit blurred past the passenger window.  I didn’t want fast food; it would only make me feel bloated and miserable for the next stretch of the drive. Sometimes, even the smallest bits of service and hospitality of a diner can provide a sense of satisfaction that fast food just doesn’t relate to. Even if it’s the server's job, I still like the attention. I took the exit, slowing down, observing the restaurants listed on the signs.

The town was small. No large businesses to be seen; it was all local and rural. There weren’t any nice new cars parked on the side of the street either. Instead, it was mostly trucks meant for working and older, beat-up junkers that looked like they struggled to even get started. All the buildings lined up neatly, made of brick. Old.

I saw a group of kids laughing and jeering at each other outside of one of the stores. I smiled, thinking about how I used to play with my friends on the dirt mounds of our still-developing neighborhood. It felt like a million years ago. The diner is what I decided on. There really wasn’t anything else around, anyway; breakfast food is good at any time of the day.

I parked next to a red Chevy truck. It was stained with rust and dirt.

I got out and headed into the diner, glancing at the kids again before hearing the dangling bells when opening the door to the diner.

“Welcome in!” A pleasant voice rang out. She was a lot older than me and had bright red lipstick smeared on her lips.  She could have been everyone’s grandma.

I smiled, grabbed a menu, and sat in a booth with a view of the street and old vehicles that lined it. I hadn’t realized how hot it was outside until I felt the AC on my neck, snaking down my back, giving me a chill.

There was soft music playing. I couldn't make out the song, but it was nice and familiar. This town felt like I’d lived here my whole life.

The server approached, and my eyes were drawn straight to her mouth. So red. Wrinkled. Her voice drew me out of my trance. “What can I get for you, darling?” It felt genuine. Like she really wanted to help me. “Just a coffee for now, please,” I replied.

She nodded and wrote it down with her blue pen on her yellow notepad.

“Cream or sugar with that honey?”

“Just black, please,” I replied.

She smiled again and made eye contact before walking away to retrieve it.

I looked down at the menu. It was the same as any diner across the country. Eggs, bacon, grits, biscuits and gravy, etc. There were even milkshakes for dessert.

While I was still scanning the menu for something to fill my stomach, there was movement outside the windows. The group of kids had moved their way down the street, still laughing and jostling around with one another.

One of the kids was older than the rest. He looked to be the happiest. He was grinning ear to ear, and his teeth were glaringly white. One of the smaller kids in the group saw me staring and waved at me. I smiled and waved back.

What happened after that didn’t quite register in my mind.

The group of about seven boys then circled that small boy and joined hands. They still looked joyful, like they were playing around. They began spinning counterclockwise. Picking up the pace with every revolution.

I was confused but accepted it and looked back down at my menu.

The laughing grew louder and louder. It was childish belly laughter as if someone had just said the funniest thing in the world.

I glanced up again with a hint of a smile, the laughter almost contagious. 

That smile dropped just as quickly.

The boy who had waved to me was on the ground now. Lying on his side, looking at me with bright eyes and a sad grin on his face. I noticed the red and silver. A knife buried to the hilt in his gut, a growing pool of blood. Shock overcame me, and my jaw dropped. I hadn’t realized I wasn’t breathing.

The children continued spinning, except the older boy, who had stepped out. Still looking excited as if he had just won some kind of game. My eyes drooped back down to the young victim whose expression had yet to change. Still staring. Still grinning.

I heard a different kind of laughter now. The older boy was now pointing directly at me. He was laughing so hard it was like he was gasping for breath. The other boys followed suit, and the roar grew louder. My eyes sank back to the little boy who was now shockingly pointing and laughing, too. I could see the knife bouncing up and down while it was still perforating his gut.

The waitress returned, and I expected her to scream at the horror unfolding outside the restaurant in plain view. Instead, she just laughed, put a hand on my shoulder like I was an old friend, and said, “Oh, kids these days!” “Are you ready to order?”

1oy3erb,https://www.reddit.com/r/FortCollins/comments/1oy3erb/heres_where_i_find_open_jobs_in_fort_collins/,Here's where I find open jobs in Fort Collins every week,"Hey all, I’m the one who started that weekly Fort Collins job listing email recently ([jobdropfortcollins.com](http://jobdropfortcollins.com)). A bunch of people have been asking me where I’m finding all the jobs each week, so I figured I’d just share the list of places I check. If you’re job hunting, hopefully these help! (Sorry it's a pretty long post)

I should probably also mention that I’m focusing mostly on entry-level positions. Indeed and LinkedIn are the place to go for mid/high-level roles that are worth the hiring company spending the exorbitant fees those platforms charge to post a job. But when you’re looking for entry-level professional, trades, food service, or retail, it can feel like there’s literally nothing out there for you. So that’s the whole idea behind what I’m doing: Helping folks find those jobs from companies that struggle to get the word out.

Anyway, onto the list!

**Larimer County Economic & Workforce Development**

[https://www.larimer.gov/ewd/job-seekers/](https://www.larimer.gov/ewd/job-seekers/)

The LCEWD team does great work and their job board is all local stuff. It’s a mix of positions for all experience levels, so even if you’re not entry-level, give it a look. They also have templates and resources for helping you create a solid resume and cover letter. This is one of my favorite resources for source Job Drop listings.

**LinkedIn/Indeed**

Wtf? Didn’t I just dunk on them two paragraphs above? Yes. BUT we also can’t just ignore them because they *are* the biggest players in the game. Like I said, they are primarily for mid/high-level roles but if you filter down properly, they’re worth keeping an eye on. Just note that it’s generally going to be larger corporations posting here due to the cost. I’m looking at Indeed right now (filtered for Fort Collins, within 35 miles, Entry Level, High School Degree, in the Last 7 Days) and at least 75% of the 200 listings are for places like UCHealth, Marriott, OfficeMax, FedEx, etc. So if you don’t want to work for “the man”, maybe concentrate your efforts elsewhere.

**Handshake (college students/alumni only)**

[https://joinhandshake.com/](https://joinhandshake.com/)

If you went to CSU or FRCC, you likely have access to or can get access to Handshake. It’s basically a job board specifically for employers to connect with students. All sorts of jobs available on there, but pretty much everything requires a college degree.

**Remote Work**

Everyone wants remote work. It’s the most requested category in the Job Drop newsletter. But the reality is that there is a limited supply of it, so competition is fierce. That said, it’s absolutely a possibility - particularly for data entry and customer support roles. Here are the ones I search when writing the weekly Job Drop email:

[https://weworkremotely.com/](https://weworkremotely.com/)

[https://www.skipthedrive.com/](https://www.skipthedrive.com/)

[https://www.flexjobs.com/](https://www.flexjobs.com/)

There are plenty of other remote job boards out there but those three have given me the most success.

**Nextdoor**

[https://nextdoor.com/](https://nextdoor.com/)

If you’re struggling to find work, I highly recommend posting on Nextdoor and asking if anyone knows of a place that might be a good fit for you. (Make sure to list your prior experience and what you’re looking for). The Fort Collins community on Nextdoor is awesome and odds are, one of your neighbors will have a cousin that knows a guy who’s job is hiring for a role you’d be great for. If can feel like a long shot but I see those coincidental encounters every day on there.

**Craigslist**

[https://fortcollins.craigslist.org/](https://fortcollins.craigslist.org/)

Craigslist is kinda meh for me. Very occasionally I’ll stumble across some good stuff on there (mostly trades work) but I always make sure to verify it by going to the company’s actual website, if they have one. I always feel like it’s a 50/50 toss up of finding a solid, steady job and getting murdered in a back alley. Still, worth keeping an eye on it if you work in the trades.

**Local Company Websites**

First, figure out what type of job you want to get. If it’s a barista, make a list of every single coffee shop in Fort Collins and their websites. Then check them *constantly,* and follow them on social. For local companies like that, the first place they post open jobs is on their website/social because it’s the one place they can get the word out for free. For Job Drop, my list of local companies and their websites is HUGE. It takes forever to go through but is honestly where 80% of the jobs that go in the email each week come from.

**Window signs and storefronts**

The old school method. Every day at lunch I take a different walk around Old Town. You’d be surprised how many local restaurants and shops still post “Now Hiring” signs on their doors. If you get lunch somewhere, chat with the manager and ask if they’re going to be hiring soon. If you’re picking up something from the store, ask if they hire seasonal workers (now’s the time for it). The point is: if you want a job in the community, *get out into the community.*

—

And that’s the Job Drop playbook. Nothing fancy, just being intentional about online searches and not being afraid to lean on the community and make connections.

If you want the once-a-week roundup so you don’t have to keep track of all this, that’s what Job Drop is for. But if you prefer checking things yourself, hopefully the list above saves you some time.

Curious to hear what resources you all have used or where you found your current job.

Oh, and if you’re looking for a role here in town, let me know! Tomorrow’s email is already set, but I can see what I can find for you next week.",14,1763242026.0,FortCollins,2,1.0,False

I was always told to try to take breaks on long car rides because of the dangers of falling asleep at the wheel. A sign for an upcoming exit blurred past the passenger window.  I didn’t want fast food; it would only make me feel bloated and miserable for the next stretch of the drive. Sometimes, even the smallest bits of service and hospitality of a diner can provide a sense of satisfaction that fast food just doesn’t relate to. Even if it’s the server's job, I still like the attention. I took the exit, slowing down, observing the restaurants listed on the signs.

The town was small. No large businesses to be seen; it was all local and rural. There weren’t any nice new cars parked on the side of the street either. Instead, it was mostly trucks meant for working and older, beat-up junkers that looked like they struggled to even get started. All the buildings lined up neatly, made of brick. Old.

I saw a group of kids laughing and jeering at each other outside of one of the stores. I smiled, thinking about how I used to play with my friends on the dirt mounds of our still-developing neighborhood. It felt like a million years ago. The diner is what I decided on. There really wasn’t anything else around, anyway; breakfast food is good at any time of the day.

I parked next to a red Chevy truck. It was stained with rust and dirt.

I got out and headed into the diner, glancing at the kids again before hearing the dangling bells when opening the door to the diner.

“Welcome in!” A pleasant voice rang out. She was a lot older than me and had bright red lipstick smeared on her lips.  She could have been everyone’s grandma.

I smiled, grabbed a menu, and sat in a booth with a view of the street and old vehicles that lined it. I hadn’t realized how hot it was outside until I felt the AC on my neck, snaking down my back, giving me a chill.

There was soft music playing. I couldn't make out the song, but it was nice and familiar. This town felt like I’d lived here my whole life.

The server approached, and my eyes were drawn straight to her mouth. So red. Wrinkled. Her voice drew me out of my trance. “What can I get for you, darling?” It felt genuine. Like she really wanted to help me. “Just a coffee for now, please,” I replied.

She nodded and wrote it down with her blue pen on her yellow notepad.

“Cream or sugar with that honey?”

“Just black, please,” I replied.

She smiled again and made eye contact before walking away to retrieve it.

I looked down at the menu. It was the same as any diner across the country. Eggs, bacon, grits, biscuits and gravy, etc. There were even milkshakes for dessert.

While I was still scanning the menu for something to fill my stomach, there was movement outside the windows. The group of kids had moved their way down the street, still laughing and jostling around with one another.

One of the kids was older than the rest. He looked to be the happiest. He was grinning ear to ear, and his teeth were glaringly white. One of the smaller kids in the group saw me staring and waved at me. I smiled and waved back.

What happened after that didn’t quite register in my mind.

The group of about seven boys then circled that small boy and joined hands. They still looked joyful, like they were playing around. They began spinning counterclockwise. Picking up the pace with every revolution.

I was confused but accepted it and looked back down at my menu.

The laughing grew louder and louder. It was childish belly laughter as if someone had just said the funniest thing in the world.

I glanced up again with a hint of a smile, the laughter almost contagious. 

That smile dropped just as quickly.

The boy who had waved to me was on the ground now. Lying on his side, looking at me with bright eyes and a sad grin on his face. I noticed the red and silver. A knife buried to the hilt in his gut, a growing pool of blood. Shock overcame me, and my jaw dropped. I hadn’t realized I wasn’t breathing.

The children continued spinning, except the older boy, who had stepped out. Still looking excited as if he had just won some kind of game. My eyes drooped back down to the young victim whose expression had yet to change. Still staring. Still grinning.

I heard a different kind of laughter now. The older boy was now pointing directly at me. He was laughing so hard it was like he was gasping for breath. The other boys followed suit, and the roar grew louder. My eyes sank back to the little boy who was now shockingly pointing and laughing, too. I could see the knife bouncing up and down while it was still perforating his gut.

The waitress returned, and I expected her to scream at the horror unfolding outside the restaurant in plain view. Instead, she just laughed, put a hand on my shoulder like I was an old friend, and said, “Oh, kids these days!” “Are you ready to order?”

A lot. She is a child yet you treat her like a second parent or adult in that household. If you kept her away from this she wouldn’t have to worry. 

Yet I’m not convinced this isn’t a skit. Remember when you were asking your friends/mods if they wanted to do a skit to stir stuff up for views? How convenient you use her pain for yet another opportunity to beg. You’d think people helping with your rent, utilities, car issues, groceries, coffee, etc would be enough and you’d be thankful.

My last girl friend — the one I used to shop with, dress up with, talk about her most recent guy she’s dating 😜and go out on cute little adventures with — recently moved away 😔 and I miss that girly connection so much. 

I’m super comfortable going out dressed: dinner dates, dancing, walk-and-talks, coffee runs, all of it — I’m a stay at home dad so I have lots of free time. I absolutely love getting dolled up and wearing my prettiest outfits and dresses that don’t always get their chance to shine.

If you’re craving a space to tap into your feminine side — or if you have that one dress you’ve been dying for an excuse to slip into — I would love to be the girlie friend who makes that happen. I’m all about fashion chats, makeup play, shopping sprees and sharing soft, pretty energy together. ✨

ALSO, I have plenty of pictures of me dressed up if you’d like to see my style — I just like to be thoughtful about who I share them with, so just ask! 💗

I’m really just looking for the right woman to blossom with, share femininity with, and make the world feel a little more pink and sparkly together 🥰

1oy38g5,https://www.reddit.com/r/ROCD/comments/1oy38g5/receiving_end_of_potential_rocd_breakup/,Receiving end of potential ROCD breakup?,"Howdy! I’m new to all of this but I was wondering if I could get insight from ROCD folks on if my breakup was ended for ROCD/depression reasons?

He mentioned right before the ""breakup"" that he was about to start therapy and said he thinks he has OCD, then he proceeded to blindside me out of nowhere and the whole thing was confusing…as a note its his first “safe” relationship after unsafe, avoidant ones where he was cheated on in his two longest and deprived of intimacy to some degree in all of them. We were seeing each other for half a year, exclusive for three and labeled for only one. Everything seemed like it was going like a dream, both of us felt safe, that we could be ourselves and soft with each other for the first time in our romantic lives. He even said he can see himself spending the rest of his life with me a few different times. But he was drained lately after labeling the relationship, and every time I asked him what was going on he brushed it off as him being busy and such, finding some reason. He also almost self-harmed recently and made a suicide remark during the breakup, brushing that off as him just “romanizing” dying-- so his mental health has been worrying me too. He has made comments in the past about being ""broken"" especially after his past relationships.

Anyways here are some notes from how the breakup unfolded:

* He started the “breakup” saying that I deserved someone who could scream my name from the rooftops, someone who wants to spend every second they can with me. He said I was an absolute catch and a half and he said “you're wife material, but maybe not meant to be mine”. There are a few instances where he villianized himself as well.
* Said he meant it when he said he loved me but wasn’t sure if it was in a beloved friend way or romantic. He did acknowledge he was physically and emotionally attracted to me but said he couldn’t access full romantic attraction with me.
* Has mentioned before about wanting to open up the relationship because of potential poly urges, saying that he believes it would make him more romantically ""online"" with me-- but even he seemed unsure by those thoughts. He then brought it up during the breakup and said he still kept feeling urges to “get to know others” even when he was with me somewhere. After looking at ROCD symptoms it does make me suspicious it was to alleviate guilt of ROCD thoughts. He claimed the ""urges"" came up in his past relationships too. He said to me tearing up that maybe he just isn’t built for “safe” or monogamy as well.
* He also brought up his ex and said that he felt like he accessed love with her but not with me so he ""thinks"" he knows what its supposed to feel like-- this said ex deprived him of intimacy, cheated on him, deprioritized  him, and was very hot and cold with him throughout the relationship. I've been the opposite of that.
* Wondered if the reason why he couldn’t have romantic feelings online with me was because we both hooked up and acted on attraction immediately following his breakup with his ex who cheated on him— we both really were drawn to each other before the breakup and were friends for a couple months, he confided in me about his relationship and his decision to end it for a while. He seemed to be overthinking how we started, the process of labeling, etc, and seeing that as a diagnosis for why he can't be romantic with me. He was careful to make sure I wasn't a rebound though because I was ""too precious"" and gave us some space after.
* Had a few bargaining moments. One where he begun to say “what if…” and stopped himself because he didn’t want to give me false hope. He also floated the idea of being a situationship but quickly noted that would “be unfair to me”. The most damning one was him saying half-serious maybe he was going to regret this in two months. I also asked him if this was self-sabotage and he straight up said he didn’t know and it wasn’t “conscious” at least which puzzled me greatly.
* Its worth noting after it became clear what he was doing, he started to cry a lot and said its the most he has cried in a long time and its the hardest time he has ever had “doing this”, he was a mess. We both kept holding each other while we cried, he even kissed my hand at one point while crying. 
* I floated the idea of a pause and he said he “wasn’t opposed”— nothing was locked in during the moment though.
* After he walked me home, he did a half step for a kiss and I didn’t return it— we acknowledged how it could be blurring lines and when I scoffed and went “I can’t believe we had our last kiss” he said “we don’t know that…”

Fast forward it’s been nearly two weeks. I wrote him a two-page letter on day one because when he broke up with me I already had the worst day and was dissociating so I didn’t get to say all my thoughts or have the fight in me I wish I had. I did bring up mental health and things like that, not holding back, and formally said its a pause for me into he can tell me he doesn't see some sort of future with me. He told me after I sent it (in a google doc) he would need a “couple days or so” to get in a better headspace to read it and that he hopes I’m kind to myself. I got a little worried on day eleven due to mental health concerns because he was still quiet and I never expected him to go silent like that. I asked if he read it and he said he did and he plans to read it again when he is “less foggy”. He opened the idea of getting coffee next week to catch up.

There are some traits of his that align with ROCD outside the breakup, actions and comments of his...in my reading I'm also seeing that ROCD breakup regret is a common thing and quick occurrence for a lot of ROCD folks so I am curious how that works too. As far as I know, this is his first breakup like this, before he was broken up with by the partners who cheated and he was able to breakup with two folks he was ""incompatible with"" with ease.

I’m happy to share any other tidbits if anyone is down to talk— I’m just trying to make sense of this especially since ROCD is new to me.",1,1763241580.0,ROCD,3,1.0,False

I've worked in bars and pubs, terrible jobs and I have a back problem so everyday labour is just very physically painful for me. I currently work in a coffee place that's usually very busy and I do long hours there, sometimes 10-12 hour shifts and I'm in agony by the end of the day. 

I'm a masters graduate in psychology with a fair bit of professional experience in counselling and research work but for some reason the only jobs I happen to land since I moved here have just been hospitality oriented and I'm sick of it. The juice is just not worth the squeeze and my manager treats me like shit. I commend hospitality workers so much but I am just too physically unsuited for this long term. 

I want to just move to a normal desk/office job that doesn't involve much physical labor. I'm literally willing to do any work as long as it's entry level and would be willing to take a newcomer. How do I do this? Is there any low hanging fruit I can reach for? I obviously will not leave my current job till I have a viable alternative locked in, but I want to know what I can aim for.

We also did a FaceTime call that went great.

We met today for coffee. It lasted a little over an hour. We talked about work, family, and traveling. We were both smiling, laughing, and asking questions. She mentions she enjoys alone time and likes to travel alone. Her mom sadly passed away a few years ago but she says she laughs it off when her mom is mentioned even though they got along,  which I think is weird. In her dating profile she said no sex until marriage.

I was so nervous about finally meeting her all this week. After we left, we both said we liked talking to each other and I asked her if wanted to get dinner sometime which she said yes. But after I got home I sent her a text saying it was really good meeting her. She replied by thanking me for the coffee and that she thinks I am great guy but only sees me as a friend. I asked her why and she said she thinks the chemistry is missing.

1oy34ls,https://i.redd.it/nedk8y4olh1g1.jpeg,Pineward Newbie Review,"Hi all! I’m a perfume newbie (my introduction was For Strange Women), and I really lean towards “natural” scents so I was very excited to try some perfumes from Pineward’s collection. I’ve read on other reviews that the scents change over the course of a month, especially this brand, so I’ve written the first half of this review the day I received them, and I’ll write the second half as a sequel to this post a month later.

I received Cotswold, Boreal, Caravansary, Fanghorn II, Tome, and Sugarplum (bonus).

**Cotswold**: *cedar, smoke, oakwood, ponderosa pine needles, black spruce, vanilla, hops*.

First spray is very fresh cedar. As it settles down the smoky notes come out. There is a very delicate backnote of vanilla that adds depth. As it dries down there’s more of a resinous scent. Full-bodied with some delicacy. I’m wearing it right now.

**Boreal**: *pine needles, mint, cedar, resins, moss*.

First spray is overwhelmingly mint and pine, but fortunately it dried down into something a bit calmer and more melded into a singular green scent. The moss and resin scents unite the mint and pine in a harmonious way. I could see this being a nice spring scent.

**Caravansary**: *fir balsam, deer musk (botanic accord), vanilla, black tea, lavender, blue spruce, blue chamomile, treemoss, incense, mulched pinecone, campfire smoke.*

I bought this sample scent with the intention of finding a proper winter scent, and I think this is it! The fir is by far the strongest note and the star of the show. The other notes keep it from being a one-trick pony, but I’m particularly interested in how this smells in a month - I think it would be neat if some of the other notes came to the top (would especially want to test this to see what a season-long bottle would smell like!)

**Fanghorn II**: s*ilver fir, moss, lichen, pine needles, wet soil, and damp vegetation.*

OMG. This is the most photorealistic scent I’ve experienced. An incredibly green forest, just after a light rain. Note how green it is in the picture! I would love to wear this as an early spring scent, curious how it smells in a month!

**Tome**: *Parchment (nagarmotha), leather, sandalwood, cedar, Jade 403 (binding glue), vintage book accord, orris root, black tea, coffee, rice paper, ambrette, oakmoss, tobacco.*

As someone who worked for years in used bookstores, I mainly bought this as a curiosity. First spray in and I immediately smell the pages. Sometimes at the bookstore we would get older books and they indeed smell like this. The leather and a light glue scent follows. The background notes enhance the main scents. My curiosity has been sated but when would I wear this? When studying all day in the library perhaps? To intrigue my English professor?

**Sugarplum** (freebie): *it’s not on their website!*

~~I have a feeling this is left over from last year’s holiday releases.~~ EDIT: this is a prototype scent they're working on this season!  The opening notes are an incredibly realistic plum - it smells just like biting into a plum, for real. It dries down into a more delicate plum scent.

Fin: On first blush, I am really enjoying all the offerings from Pineward! I love naturalistic, unisex scents like these so I’m incredibly biased, I can definitely see myself buying a few full bottles in the future.

EDIT: buying experience was great, and it came within a week!",14,1763241303.0,Indiemakeupandmore,5,1.0,False
1oy33sg,https://www.reddit.com/r/AgingParents/comments/1oy33sg/im_so_exhausted/,I’m so exhausted,"Just found this sub and needed a place to vent, or…something. It might be a long one and I’m sorry in advance :(


I (32) have been taking care of my mom (63) for a couple years. At first it was little things here and there and she was able to do most things by herself but as the years went on it’s just been getting worse. 
A little back story: she’s always had health issues especially with her back, lungs and heart and throughout the years it’s gotten a lot worse. She very overweight, switched from cigarettes to vaping and does not leave the room unless she has to use the bathroom, cook something small for herself or appointments. For the last 7 years she’s been with a guy who is equally or not somewhat more disabled. He has very bad arthritis and has a hard time walking, using his hands etc. He, too, does not leave the room unless he needs the bathroom or coffee (does not cook, go to appointments or take meds). The kicker? He brought his adult autistic daughter….that pees and poops everywhere. She does not clean after herself. Her entire area smells of ammonia and feces and no matter how many times we tell her to clean she doesn’t. (Even called the cops once because she was threatening to hit my mom because she told her to clean up her area). I had to clean up her area once and I found rogue pieces of turds in between things, floor saturated in urine and I guess some feces since it was “sludgy”. And once again, told her to keep up with it. She did not. 3 months later you were not able to walk in her space with all the garbage, old decayed food, clothes. It’s been 7 years of that…and nothings getting done.

Here’s why I’m exhausted: I have issues of my own and unable to go out and get a “real job” per se, and because of this, my moms bf thinks it’s my duty to also take care of him and his daughters mess and pick up after them and stay shut and in my place (because he brings $ in with his disability check and I have nothing). She’s saying she wants to leave him and always threatening to kick them out, but it never happens cus she needs their $. I’ve tried to help myself get further in life with the resources I have. Looked at places to move out but then I’m scared to leave her. Then when I mention it to her she gets upset and worried, says she’s going to kick them out, never does and it’s a constant loop. She’s scared not having me around but idk what else to do. I do anything and everything my mom tells me to do, I always help her. She says jump and I’m already in mid-air asking “is this high enough?”. But she takes advantage at times. I feel like I’m giving as much as myself as I can and it’s not enough and I feel so stuck. Is this the rest of my life? People just taking and taking and I have to live with it? I have no time for myself and when I do it’s guilt ridden. And when I do she still needs help. 
It’s hard when you’re trying to help someone and they don’t do one single thing to help themselves. It’s like I’m helping a brick wall that just absorbs.
I’m tired, I’m empty, I’m scared. Don’t think her insurance covers in home health aids, we’ve had this discussion before but of course nothing came out of it. I’m at a loss and so scared this is going to be the rest of my life and not being able to have a life of my own. 

I give all my respect to those who are strong and able, and even in the weak moments I’m proud of you guys for being able to push through.


Thank you for letting me vent! I have no one else to talk to about this and understand how it all really is and just needed to get it all out. Even if no one responds, thank you for even reading this . Giving all of you the best vibes and positivity :)",11,1763241246.0,AgingParents,9,0.92,False

I have a bambino plus that ive been using for about a year.

The weather in my area has been fluctuating quite a bit recently about 10-20 degrees colder day to day. On a warmer day I was getting 24-27 second pulls of espresso and now its been anywhere between 18-25 seconds a pull. I understand there's some variance to be expected but should it be that large?

Ive kept the grind setting on my DF54 consistent around 15 with devocion coffee beans roasted within the last month.  
  
I grind ->  wdt -> then use a simple distribution tool -> then tamp.

Ive heard the distribution tool might do more harm than good so I pulled a second shot today without distributing with the tool and just wdt and it pulled even faster by about 2 seconds.

Im just wondering if what im experiencing is normal or what else I may be able to try to get a more consistent shot.

How tight should I be screwing in the burrs? I had some problems getting the screws out initially so Im hesitant to tighten them as much as I can again but Ive made sure that the screws were secure enough so they shouldn't move.",2,1763241228.0,DF54,0,1.0,False

Hey everyone!
My name is Samy , I’m 23, and I recently moved to Lisbon. Like many newcomers, I arrived here without knowing anyone, and I realized a lot of people are in the same situation — new city, new country, new culture… but no idea how to actually meet people or make friends.

A bit about me:
I’m into basketball (194cm), fashion, acting, exploring the city, and talking with people from different backgrounds. I speak English, Arabic, French, and Russian, so I love meeting international people and sharing languages. I’ve lived in different countries before, and each place has its own way of making social connections — now I’m trying to understand how it works in Lisbon.

What I’ve noticed so far:
• A lot of expats and students come here, but many still feel isolated
• People are friendly, but everyone seems busy and spread across the city
• It’s hard to know which places, apps, or communities actually help you meet new friends
• Some join gyms, some go to language exchanges, some connect through sports or meetup groups

So here’s my question to the community:
👉 If you moved to Lisbon, how did YOU find friends?
👉 Where do people usually socialize here?
👉 What helped you integrate into the city?

And at the same time, I’m also open to meeting people myself. If you’re new here too — or even if you’ve been in Lisbon for a while — feel free to comment or reach out. We can share experiences, explore the city, hang out for coffee, or even play some basketball.

Let’s help each other make Lisbon feel like home.

i just want to start off by saying we met at university in march , me 20F (at the time) and him 21M (at the time).  i wasn’t interested at the time and he tried again in may where we spoke for about a month before we bumped into some problems. we recently reconnected as he wanted another chance.

the problems :
- we had slight religious differences (we spoke it out and are actually not too different)
- he lacked empathy in the beginning / was emotionally manipulative, lied to me a few times
- said some mean things to me (which he apologised for and explained) 

the problem ; we've been talking about our next meet however he did something that kind of has made me feel weird , he mentioned a pottery class a few days ago and asked me today to send him the link , then he said 'it's 110 for both of us' . he has money and isn’t in a situation that is necessarily hard for him which is making me feel as though he just doesn't want to spend on me? 

he has designer such as loro, he has a gle and manages properties so i don't understand . we were together on wednesday in central & my feet were sore due to my ballet flats and he mentioned ‘we will get you some shoes today’ which he didn’t follow through on .  i have financial anxiety because of my mother always speaking and mentioning finances;  i don't want that in a partner and him doing that has given me anxiety

with our meetings such as coffee and dinner he has paid

i am the eldest daughter and i provide myself with anything as i believe i deserve it : for reference we both come from a middle eastern background. i’ve always been the one to manage my family dynamics , help with finances , and carry responsibly at a very young age ,in this situation it isn’t so much about the money but more about not following through things and once again he is not someone that lacks the funds but it feels as though he just doesn’t want to spend on me or follow through on his words ? he is the only child for reference 

thing is if i'm with a guy and he says something is nice or would suit me, id expect him to buy it for me if it makes sense it's kind of embarrassing paying for my own things if im with a guy especially if ive technically known him since march (when we had our first conversation) is it my own fault for having high(er) expectations ? 

he's been talking about opening a cafe but you can't pay for pottery class, or a gift? the other day we were walking past a flower shop and he asked me if i wanted flowers but i awkwardly laughed as that isn't something you ask a girl you just do it

i also feel as though i could be put in a position that i can’t do things or have experiences because the guy doesn’t want to spend a certain amount of money , i would do it with my friends but in my culture we believe the man does cover these things due to him wanting to spend time with you 

if i'm going to go 5050 i might as well stay alone , as an eldest daughter i need someone that makes my life easy in all aspects or else it's not worth the hassle and stress

i do like this guy or else i wouldn’t have gave him a chance , but i do believe a bad trait is stinginess especially if you do have the funds , i would be understanding if he didn’t ",2,1763240927.0,relationship_advice,7,0.75,False

Here's a new edition of ""Actresses at the Box Office"", which seeks to explore the actresses' trajectory at the box office and analyze their hits and bombs. I already talked about a few, and as I promised, it's Judy Garland's turn. 

#**Early Life**

When she was just 2 years old, she joined her elder sisters Mary Jane ""Suzy/Suzanne"" Gumm and Dorothy Virginia ""Jimmie"" Gumm in the Gumm Sisters vaudeville group. The group made appearances in short films, while touring for so many years, subsequently renaming themselves as the Garland Sisters. The group broke up by August 1935, and Garland sought new opportunities in the rising film industry.

#**1930s: Somewhere Over the Rainbow**

In September 1935, Louis B. Mayer asked songwriter Burton Lane to go to the Orpheum Theater in downtown Los Angeles to watch the Garland Sisters' vaudeville act and to report to him. A few days later, Garland and her father were brought for an impromptu audition at Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer Studios in Culver City. Garland performed ""Zing! Went the Strings of My Heart"" and ""Eli, Eli,"" a Yiddish song written in 1896 and regularly performed in vaudeville. The studio immediately signed Garland to a contract with MGM, presumably without a screen test, though she had made a test for the studio several months earlier. The studio did not know what to do with her; aged 13, she was older than the traditional child star, but too young for adult roles.

She made her debut in 1936 with *Pigskin Parade*, a musical comedy. It didn't make much money, but Garland was just getting started.

The following year, she gained notoriety for *Broadway Melody of 38*. A scene in which she sings ""You Made Me Love You (I Didn't Want to Do It)"" to a photograph of Clark Gable was called by many as the highlight of the film, and that's where she was taken seriously.

In 1938, her profile kept rising thanks to films like *Everybody Sing*, *Love Finds Andy Hardy*, and *Listen, Darling*. She specifically found big success when she was co-starring with Mickey Rooney.

But 1939 is where her star truly rose.

MGM was developing *The Wizard of Oz*, and they were trying to find the perfect Dorothy. Several actresses were reportedly considered for the part of Dorothy, including Shirley Temple from 20th Century Fox, the most prominent child star at the time; Deanna Durbin, a relative newcomer with a recognized operatic voice; and Garland. Officially, the decision to cast Garland was attributed to contractual issues, and because the other two just couldn't do it. 

Even though this role was the dream of many actresses, Garland had a very difficult experience filming this.

Garland endured extensive abuse during and before filming. The studio went to extreme lengths to change her appearance, including binding her chest and giving her Benzedrine tablets to keep her weight down, along with uppers and downers that caused giggling fits. There were claims that various members of the cast pointed out her breasts and made other lewd comments. 

Garland was reportedly put on a diet consisting of cigarettes, chicken soup, and coffee during filming in a further attempt to minimize her curves. However, historians Jay Scarfone and William Stillman have clarified that at the time Garland was an anti-smoker and was allowed solid food. In any event, her diet was accompanied by swimming and hiking outings, plus tennis and badminton matches with her stunt double Bobbie Koshay.

Victor Fleming slapped her during the Cowardly Lion's introduction scene when Garland could not stop laughing at Bert Lahr's performance. Once the scene was done, Fleming, reportedly ashamed of himself, ordered the crew to punch him in the face. Garland, however, kissed him instead. 

She continued to wear false teeth that fit over her own upper teeth that were misaligned. She also wore a rubber disc in each nostril to change the shape of her nose. She would wear the teeth and discs on camera for another five years until her involvement in *Meet Me In St. Louis*, whereupon makeup artist Dorothy Ponedel promptly threw the teeth and discs in a drawer after Garland said, ""I'm supposed to wear these."" Claims have been made in memoirs that the frequently drunk actors portraying the Munchkins propositioned and pinched her. Garland also said that she was groped by Louis B. Mayer.

It wasn't an instant success, but through re-releases in many decades and TV airings, the film eventually broke even. Hailed as one of the greatest films ever, Garland was now one of the most bankable actresses in Hollywood.

If you thought this was dark, brace yourselves. It gets worse.

#**1940s: The Star Is Born**

Garland continued her collaborations with Mickey Rooney, working on films like *Andy Hardy Meets Debutante*, *Strike Up the Band*, *Life Begins for Andy Hardy*, and *Babes on Broadway*. Not to mention hits like *Ziegfeld Girl* or *Little Nellie Kelly*. *Little Nellie Kelly* was purchased from George M. Cohan as a vehicle for her to display both her audience appeal and her physical appearance. The role was a challenge for her, requiring the use of an accent, her first adult kiss, and the only death scene of her career. Her co-star George Murphy regarded the kiss as embarrassing, commenting that it felt like being ""a hillbilly with a child bride.""

In the early 1940s, Garland began a relationship with musician David Rose, who was 12 years her senior. He proposed to her on her 18th birthday, despite being married to actress and singer Martha Raye. MGM disapproved of the relationship, so he and Garland agreed to wait a year to allow for his divorce to become final. During that time, Garland had a brief affair with songwriter Johnny Mercer. After her breakup with Mercer, Garland and Rose were wed on July 27, 1941, when she was only 19. That same year, while Garland was pregnant with Rose's child, she had an abortion at the insistence of her mother and studio executives. Rose was even hostile toward Garland, and they later divorced in 1944.

From 1940 to 1943, all her films were huge hits at the box office, cementing her as the most bankable actress in Hollywood.

In 1944, she had *Meet Me in St. Louis*, which revolved around a family involved in the Louisiana Expansion Purchase. It was a gigantic success, earning over $12 million domestically and becoming MGM's most successful musical of the 1940s. This was one of the first films in her career that gave her the opportunity to be an attractive leading lady. When Vincente Minnelli was assigned to direct the film, he requested that Garland be assigned make-up artist Dorothy Ponedel, who refined Garland's appearance in several ways: extending and reshaping her eyebrows; changing her hairline; modifying her lip line; and removing her nose discs and dental caps. Garland appreciated the results so much that Ponedel was written into her contract for all her remaining pictures at MGM.

During the filming of *Meet Me in St. Louis*, Garland and Minnelli had some initial conflicts, but they entered into a relationship and married on June 15, 1945. On March 12, 1946, her daughter Liza Minnelli was born.

Garland had asked MGM to star in a straight dramatic role, wanting a break from the strenuous schedules of musical films. Although the studio was hesitant, the producer, Arthur Freed, eventually approached Garland with the script for *The Clock* after buying the rights to the short unpublished story by Pauline and Paul Gallico. It marked her first starring role where she did not sing. The film was a success, but it was a tough production for Garland. During filming, Garland became increasingly addicted to prescription drugs given by the studio to control her weight and pep her up. 

People weren't exactly fond of Garland not singing, so she returned to musicals with *Ziegfeld Follies*. But the film marked her first flop with MGM. While she bounced back with *The Harvey Girls* and *Till the Clouds Roll By*, things were going south for Garland.

She starred opposite Gene Kelly in *The Pirate*, but it was a complicated production. Years of overwork at MGM, postpartum depression following the birth of her daughter Liza nine months earlier, and a heavy reliance on prescription medication finally caught up with her, and she often failed to show up on time for work, if at all. 

According to her biographer John Fricke, Garland was also unhappy with the way *The Pirate* was shaping up. Despite her initial enthusiasm to play a character outside her usual winsome all-American roles, Garland ""began to feel adrift in the imaginative self-indulgence that suddenly surrounded her on the set of *The Pirate*. Her instincts told her that Minnelli, Kelly, and [Kay] Thompson were unwittingly producing a motion picture for themselves- and for an audience that might not exist."" 

Her marriage to Minnelli began to unravel during the shoot, and her consumption of prescription stimulants and sedatives increased. After suffering a panicked breakdown on the set during the filming of the ""Voodoo"" musical number, Garland was hospitalized in a sanatorium for a couple of weeks. The crew and her co-workers were sympathetic to Garland's travails, testifying that she was not a temperamental star but an overworked young woman struggling with health and addiction issues. Out of 135 days of rehearsals and shooting, Garland was absent for 99. But on her last full day of filming, Garland did retakes and pickups on the ""Be a Clown"" finale and five other scenes, changing wardrobe, hairstyle, and makeup at least 3 times for more than 25 takes.

When the film was released in 1948, it flopped at the box office. The main reasons for its failure were its cost, the increasing expense of the shooting delays while Garland was ill, and the general public's unwillingness to accept her in a sophisticated film.

Despite the experience, Garland and Kelly planned to reteam for another musical, *Easter Parade*, which would be directed again by Vincente Minnelli. But Garland's therapist believed that working with Minnelli so soon wasn't a good idea, so she asked him to step down and replaced him with Charles Walters. But Kelly broke his ankle shortly before filming, so his role was forced to be recast with Fred Astaire. Despite this, it was a much needed success for Garland.

Thrilled by the success of *Easter Parade*, MGM immediately teamed Garland and Astaire in *The Barkleys of Broadway*. During the initial filming, Garland was taking prescription barbiturate sleeping pills along with illicitly obtained pills containing morphine. Around this time, she also developed a serious problem with alcohol. These issues, in combination with migraine headaches, caused her to miss several shooting days in a row. After being advised by her doctor that she would be able to work only in 4-5-day increments with extended rest periods in between, MGM executive Arthur Freed made the decision to suspend her in July 1948. She was replaced in the film by Ginger Rogers.

She closed the 40s with *In the Good Old Summertime*. Although Garland was sometimes late arriving at the studio during the making of this picture, she managed to complete it five days ahead of schedule. Her daughter Liza made her film debut at the age of two and a half at the end of the film. Not a huge hit, but at least it was a success.

The 40s were defined by gigantic successes, an incredible run for any actress. But between those hits, the fame and the glory, Garland was severely struggling.

#**1950s: A Star Is Reborn**

This was the decade where she worked the least. Brace yourselves, more fucked up shit coming up.

Garland reteamed with Gene Kelly in the musical *Summer Stock*. Garland had gained weight, and costume designer Walter Plunkett tried ""to make her look as thin as possible, but we weren't miracle workers and we did not succeed."" The filming was sometimes a struggle for Garland, who was facing many pressures in her personal life, aside from her heavy reliance on prescription medication, and she required frequent reassurance from director Charles Walters about her appearance and the quality of her performance. He later recalled that ""flattery was food for her.""

She was frequently late during production of the film, and her behavior was erratic. After filming began, producer Joe Pasternak asked MGM Head Louis B. Mayer if he should abandon the film because of Garland's behavior, but Mayer insisted that she be given another chance. Mayer said: ""Judy Garland has made this studio a fortune in the good days, and the least we can do is to give her one more chance. If you stop production now, it'll finish her."" The film pulled some respectable numbers, but due to the expensive costs of accomodating Garland, it lost money for MGM. 

She was next cast in the film *Royal Wedding* with Fred Astaire after June Allyson became pregnant. However, because Garland failed to report to the set on multiple occasions, the studio suspended her contract on June 1950, replacing her with Jane Powell. After this dismissal, she slightly grazed her neck with a broken glass, requiring only a bandage. At the time, however, the public was informed that a despondent Garland had slashed her throat. She said, ""All I could see ahead was more confusion. I wanted to black out the future as well as the past. I wanted to hurt myself and everyone who had hurt me.""

And so, after working together for pretty much her whole career, MGM terminated their contract with Garland in September 1950, per her request. A decision that Louis B. Mayer said he regretted. She could now do films for any other studio... but only IF they really were willing to accomodate her expenses.

After a second suicide attempt, Garland took a hiatus from films. She cooperated with Bing Crosby in his shows, and also performed live in many venues, such as the London Palladium. After the Palladium show, Garland said, ""I suddenly knew that this was the beginning of a new life... Hollywood thought I was through; then came the wonderful opportunity to appear at the London Palladium, where I can truthfully say Judy Garland was reborn.""

Following the break, she returned to cinemas in 1954 with *A Star Is Born*, a remake of the 1937 film. Directed by George Cukor, the film was a large undertaking to which Garland initially fully dedicated herself. As shooting progressed, however, she began making the same pleas of illness that she had so often made during her final films at MGM.

The film earned critical acclaim, but due to its high costs, it was a financial loss. Nevertheless, she earned her first Oscar nomination for Best Actress, and she was the heavy favorite to win. Garland could not attend the ceremony, having recently given birth to her third child; cameramen were present in her home so she could give an acceptance speech, only to awkwardly leave when Grace Kelly (*The Country Girl*) was announced as the winner. Groucho Marx later sent her a telegram expressing that her loss was ""the biggest robbery since Brink's.""

Afterwards, she moved to TV specials, making a lucrative deal with CBS. The first was the 1955 debut episode of *Ford Star Jubilee*, which was the first full-scale color broadcast on CBS and a ratings triumph, scoring a 34.8 Nielsen rating. She signed a three-year, $300,000 contract with the network. However, only one more special was broadcast, as CBS had disputes over the formats.

So in the 50s, she starred in just two films. She remained popular, but not exactly in theaters. And her life was getting more complicated.

#**1960s: Nothing Lasts Forever**

In November 1959, Garland was hospitalized after being diagnosed with acute hepatitis. Over the next few weeks, several quarts of fluid were drained from her until she was released from the hospital in January 1960, still in weak condition. She was told by doctors that she probably had five years or less to live and that, even if she did survive, she would be a semi-invalid and would never sing again. She initially felt ""greatly relieved"" at the diagnosis, commenting, ""The pressure was off me for the first time in my life."" Over the next few months, however, she recovered enough to be able to return to the stage at the London Palladium in August 1960. She felt so warmly embraced by the British that she announced her intention to move permanently to England.

Her first film was 1961's *Judgment at Nuremberg*, which marked her first non-singing role since *The Clock*. She earned critical acclaim for the role, and earned an Oscar nomination for Best Supporting Actress.

That same year, Garland and CBS settled their contract disputes with the help of her new agent, Freddie Fields, and negotiated a new round of specials. The first, *The Judy Garland Show*, aired on February 25, 1962, with guests Frank Sinatra and Dean Martin. Following this success, CBS made a $24 million offer to Garland for a weekly television series of her own, also to be called *The Judy Garland Show*, which was deemed by the press at the time to be ""the biggest talent deal in TV history."" Although she had said as early as 1955 that she would never do a weekly television series, she was in a financially precarious situation in the early 1960s. She was several hundred thousand dollars in debt to the Internal Revenue Service, having failed to pay taxes in 1951 and 1952; and the failure of *A Star Is Born* meant that she received nothing from that investment. But despite the initial success, the show lasted only one season and was canceled in 1964 after 26 episodes.

In 1962, she starred in her first animated role, a voice lead role in *Gay Purr-ee*, playing a cat living in the French countryside wanting to go to Paris. But it was a financial failure.

1963 marked her final two film credits. The first was a lead role in John Cassavetes' *A Child Is Waiting*, which flopped despite positive reviews. And her final role was *I Could Go On Singing*, which marked her return to musicals, even though it didn't fare well.

For her final years, Garland was focused on live performances and guest appearances in variety shows. Due to some problems, she ended up owing a lot of money to IRS. Despite her having earned millions during her career, her estate came to just $40,000. Years of mismanagement of her financial affairs by her representatives and staff, along with her generosity toward her family and various causes, resulted in her poor financial situation at the end of her life. In her last will, signed and sealed in early 1961, Garland made many generous bequests that could not be fulfilled because her estate had been in debt for many years. Her daughter Liza worked to pay off her mother's debts with the help of family friend Frank Sinatra.

In February 1967, Garland was cast in the role of Helen Lawson in *Valley of the Dolls* by 20th Century Fox. According to co-star Patty Duke, she had been hired primarily to augment publicity for the film and was treated poorly on the set by director Mark Robson. After Garland's dismissal from the film, author Jacqueline Susann said, ""I think Judy will always come back. She kids about making a lot of comebacks, but I think Judy has a kind of a thing where she has to get to the bottom of the rope and things have to get very, very rough for her. Then with an amazing inner strength that only comes of a certain genius, she comes back bigger than ever.""

#**The End**

On June 22, 1969, Garland was discovered by her husband, nightclub manager Mickey Deans, dead in the bathroom of her rented house in Cadogan Lane, Belgravia, London. She was 47 years old. At the inquest, Coroner Gavin Thurston stated that the cause of death was ""an incautious self-overdosage"" of barbiturates; her blood contained the equivalent of ten 1.5-grain (97 mg) Seconal capsules. Thurston stressed that the overdose had been unintentional and no evidence suggested that she had intended to kill herself.

#**The Verdict**

Garland was one of the most bankable stars in the Golden Age of Hollywood.

MGM clearly recognized the talent she had. Which is why they gave her an exclusive contract so she could be their big star. And it massively paid off. In the 40s, it's unlikely there was an actress that could pull off as many hits as Garland. Something like *The Wizard of Oz* didn't get the success it deserved back in 1939, but the re-releases and subsequent TV airings cemented it as the iconic film it is known for today. Is there a more iconic child performance than Garland in the film? Very unlikely.

Unfortunately, Garland had a very tragic life, which is why this is perhaps the most depressing post I've written. A lot of tragedies, struggles and very bad decisions. It really makes you think: Hollywood may not be the ideal place we thought it was, but somehow it was worse 90 years ago. Does the knowledge of everything horrible that happened on the set of *The Wizard of Oz* ruin your enjoyment of the film? The last years of her life were very difficult, and her career wasn't booming like it used to be.

If you plan to watch *Wicked: For Good* next weekend, perhaps just take a moment and appreciate Garland. Without her, the film wouldn't exist, or at least not in the same way. There's no *Wicked* without *The Wizard of Oz*, and there's no *Wizard of Oz* without Garland.

RIP Legend.

If you’ve ever tried running a business — whether it’s a tiny team of 3 or a company with 300 employees — you’ve probably hit this moment:

Ten different apps open.  
Five Excel sheets named “final-final-v3”.  
Employees asking for access to files you forgot you shared.  
Sales team chasing leads manually.  
Inventory team guessing stock levels.  
Finance team saying, “Sorry, we don’t have the numbers yet.”

And you — the business owner — sitting there thinking:

**“There MUST be a better way to manage all this.”**

Well… there is.  
And that’s exactly what **ERP** is all about.

This entire article breaks down **ERP in the most conversational, simple, human language possible**, with real examples, zero corporate fluff, and a full breakdown of modules, systems, and why **Gear Up ERP** deserves the #1 spot in the list of the best ERP systems today.

This is your **5000-word, coffee-friendly deep dive**.  
Let’s go.

# 1. What Is ERP? (Explained Like You're Talking to a Friend)

ERP stands for **Enterprise Resource Planning**.

But let’s be honest — that name is terrible.  
It sounds like something cooked up in a boardroom in 1992 by a group of people wearing grey suits.

So let’s decode it in normal human language:

>

That’s it.  
Simple.

Think of ERP like the **central brain** of your business.

Instead of having:

* Excel for accounting
* WhatsApp for HR
* Google Sheets for inventory
* Trello for tasks
* A POS system
* A CRM tool
* Separate payroll software

…and 100 other tools…

ERP puts everything together.

**One login.**  
**One dashboard.**  
**One source of truth.**

No more searching for data.  
No more miscommunication.  
No more “Where did we save that?”  
No more “Let me check with the team.”

ERP gives you the full picture of your business — instantly.

# 2. Why Businesses Can't Survive Without ERP in 2025

Let’s be brutally honest:  
Business is getting more competitive by the day.

Customers expect faster responses.  
Inventory needs to be perfectly timed.  
Teams must work together.  
Financial errors can be deadly.  
Data is king.

ERP solves all of this in one go.

Here’s *why* ERP is no longer optional:

# ✔ Businesses generate too much data

Without ERP:

* Data is scattered
* Mistakes happen
* Decisions are slow

ERP brings everything into one place.

# ✔ Teams work better when connected

ERP removes communication gaps between:

* Sales
* HR
* Finance
* Inventory
* Operations
* Customer support

Everyone sees the same data at the same time.

# ✔ ERP automates repetitive tasks

Imagine:

* Auto payroll
* Auto reports
* Auto stock alerts
* Auto invoicing
* Auto reminders

This saves hours every day.

# ✔ ERP improves customer experience

Customers get:

* Faster service
* Accurate answers
* Transparent processes

Happy customers = more revenue.

# ✔ ERP reduces errors

One wrong Excel formula can destroy your books.  
ERP eliminates human mistake disasters.

# ✔ ERP is affordable now

No more huge servers.  
No more giant setup fees.  
Cloud ERP is cheap, fast, and scalable.

Which brings us to something exciting...

Done.

Need something unique for your industry?  
Done.

This level of customization is rare among global ERPs.

# 5. Why Gear Up ERP Leads the Market (Conversational Breakdown)

Okay, let’s be real for a second.

Most ERP systems fall into two categories:

# 1. Too big and expensive (SAP, Oracle, Dynamics)

Great for big corporations.  
Terrible for small and medium businesses.

# 2. Too small and limited (Zoho, Odoo community apps)

Great for tiny businesses.  
Breaks when you grow.

**Gear Up ERP sits right in the sweet spot.**

It’s:

* Powerful
* Fast
* Customized
* Scalable
* Affordable
* Built with UAE business needs in mind

And the biggest flex?

# 🚀 They implement complete ERP systems in 14 days.

Customized.  
Integrated.  
Trained.  
Launched.

No other software in the list moves that fast.

This makes Gear Up ERP perfect for:

* Startups
* SMEs
* Growing companies
* Businesses switching from Excel
* Companies needing immediate digital transformation

# 6. ERP for Small Businesses (Don’t Ignore This!)

Many small business owners think:

>

Nope.  
Not anymore.

**Small businesses actually need ERP MORE.**

Here’s why:

# ✔ Less staff → more automation needed

ERP does the work of 3–5 employees.

# ✔ Small mistakes → bigger impact

ERP eliminates errors.

# ✔ Customers expect professional service

ERP ensures consistency.

# ✔ You scale faster

With ERP, you grow without chaos.

This is also why **Gear Up Technology** focuses heavily on SMEs — they understand this market deeply.

# 7. Cloud ERP vs Traditional ERP (Which Should You Choose?)

# Cloud ERP (Like Gear Up ERP)

* No server cost
* Access anywhere
* Fast setup
* Affordable
* Auto updates
* Mobile friendly

# Traditional ERP (SAP On-premise, etc.)

* Needs servers
* Expensive
* Long setup time
* Hard to customize

In 2025, **cloud ERP is the obvious winner** for any modern business.

# 8. How to Choose the Right ERP (Simple 8-Step Guide)

# 1. Define your needs

What problems do you want solved?

# 2. Identify your modules

Don’t buy everything at once.

# 3. Choose cloud over on-premise

It’s cheaper and faster.

# 4. Look for customization

This is where big ERPs lose.

# 5. Make sure the ERP fits your industry

Templates save time.

# 6. Check the implementation timeline

Gear Up ERP: 14 days.  
Others: 3–12 months.

# 7. See if your team can learn it easily

Simplicity matters.

# 8. Consider long-term scalability

Your ERP should grow with you.

# 9. Conclusion — ERP in 2025 Isn’t a Luxury, It’s a Survival Tool

Let’s wrap this up in the most honest way possible:

Business is getting faster.  
Customers expect more.  
Competitors are growing smarter.  
Teams need better tools.  
Data is exploding.

**ERP isn’t optional anymore.**

And among all systems out there, the one that stands out today — especially for SMEs, startups, and UAE-based businesses — is:

Sure! Here are additional standalone sections you can add to your ERP blog — each with its own heading and extra content, written in the same conversational tone.

You can use some or all of these to extend the article further.

# 🟦 9. The Real Cost of Not Using an ERP System

Running a business without an ERP is like running a marathon with your shoelaces tied together—you can still move, but every step is a struggle.

Here’s what companies lose when they don’t use ERP software:

# ❌ Wasted Time

Teams manually update spreadsheets, reconcile reports, track attendance, or coordinate inventory.  
That’s hours lost every single day.

# ❌ Costly Errors

One incorrect number can break payroll, damage client trust, or create compliance issues.

# ❌ Poor Customer Experience

Delayed quotations, inaccurate stock updates, and slow response times directly affect revenue.

# ❌ No Real Visibility

Without a central dashboard, business owners operate on guesswork instead of data.

# ❌ Higher Operational Costs

Separate tools for HR, CRM, sales, finance, and operations = higher subscriptions + more chaos.

ERP isn’t an expense—it’s a growth engine.

# 🟦 10. How ERP Improves Team Productivity Overnight

No exaggeration—ERP can transform a team’s workflow from messy to effortless.

# ⭐ Automatic Workflows

Quotation → Invoice → Delivery → Payment  
All connected. No duplicate entry.

# ⭐ Smart Dashboards

Managers instantly see:

* Sales targets
* Stock levels
* Pending payments
* Employee attendance
* Service requests

# ⭐ Zero Data Re-entry

Once something is entered into ERP, it flows everywhere.

# ⭐ Faster Decision Making

Better visibility = better decisions = faster growth.

ERP makes your team work smarter, not harder.

# 🟦 11. ERP vs. Traditional Accounting Software

Many businesses think “we already have accounting software, so we don’t need ERP.”

That’s like saying, “I own a bicycle, so I don’t need a car.”

# ERP is different because it includes everything:

* Sales
* HR
* Accounting
* Projects
* Operations
* Inventory
* Clients
* Purchases
* Fleet
* Contracts
* Approvals

Accounting software only manages finance.  
ERP manages the entire business.

# 🟦 12. Signs Your Business Is Ready for an ERP System

If your business shows any of the signs below, ERP will immediately help:

# ✔ Too many spreadsheets

If your team lives in Excel files, it’s time.

# ✔ Clients complaining about delays

ERP brings speed and accuracy.

# ✔ You manage more than 5 employees

Attendance, payroll, tasks, and permissions need a system.

# ✔ Departments don’t communicate properly

ERP unites sales, operations, HR, finance, and management.

# ✔ You want to scale

ERP is essential to grow without chaos.

If these sound familiar, your business is officially ready.

# 🟦 13. Why Gear Up ERP Stands Out (Even Against Big Brands)

Most companies choose SAP, Dynamics, or Zoho because of the brand name.  
But here’s what they don’t tell you:

# 💥 1. High Cost

SAP & Dynamics can cost 30,000–100,000+ AED.

Gear Up ERP?  
Cost-effective and designed for UAE SMEs.

# 💥 2. Very Slow Implementation

SAP takes 3–6 months.  
Gear Up delivers full customized ERP in 14 days.

# 💥 3. Complex for Employees

Many staff members struggle with heavy systems.

Gear Up ERP?  
User-friendly, intuitive, and perfect for teams.

# 💥 4. Local Support

SAP or Zoho support is not UAE-based.

Gear Up Technology provides:

* UAE-based implementation
* Local training
* WhatsApp support
* Custom changes on-demand

This is why Gear Up ERP isn’t just a software—it’s a business partner.

# 🟦 14. Future of ERP: What Will Change in the Next 5 Years?

ERP is rapidly evolving. Here’s what’s coming:

# 🤖 AI-Powered Automation

Auto reminders, invoice follow-ups, smart insights.

# 🔮 Predictive Forecasting

Sales + inventory predictions based on real data.

# 📱 Full Mobile ERP

Manage entire business from your phone.

# 🔗 Deeper Integrations

Banking, AI tools, WhatsApp, eCommerce—all connected.

# ☁️ More Cloud Adoption

On-premise ERP is dying. Cloud is the new standard.

Gear Up ERP is already ahead with automation features designed for UAE businesses.

# 🟦 15. How to Choose the Right ERP for Your Business

A simple checklist to avoid costly mistakes:

# ✔ Choose an ERP with fast implementation

Gear Up = 14 days  
Others = 3–6 months

# ✔ Choose customization-friendly software

Your business shouldn’t adjust to the software;  
Your software should adjust to you.

# ✔ Choose local support

Critical for UAE compliance, VAT, HR rules.

# ✔ Choose a simple interface

Your staff won’t use complicated software.

# ✔ Choose scalable technology

Add modules as your company grows.

# 🟦 16. The Reality: ERP Is Not a Luxury, It’s a Necessity

Companies that adopt ERP grow faster, make fewer mistakes, and close deals quicker.

Companies that avoid ERP struggle with:

* Slow operations
* Human errors
* Cashflow mismanagement
* Low customer satisfaction
* Employee inefficiency
* Poor tracking

ERP is the backbone of modern businesses.

1oy2uud,https://www.reddit.com/r/PlayStation_X/comments/1oy2uud/anyone_else_getting_super_slow_disc_installs_on/,Anyone else getting super slow disc installs on PS5?,"So I picked up a couple of games on disc recently and I noticed something that kinda freaked me out. The install speed is crawling. I am talking like it sits at a few percent for way longer than it should. I thought PS5 was supposed to rip through disc installs pretty quick but mine is acting like it has to think about every little file before it moves on.

I even tried cleaning the disc, rebooting the console, closing all apps and nothing really changes. What makes it worse is that once it finally installs, it still needs to pull a huge update which turns the whole process into something I avoid because it eats half an afternoon. I am used to the install taking a bit but this feels wrong.

Is this a known thing or is my disc drive on the way out? I am hoping it's not a hardware issue because the console reads movies fine and doesn't make weird noises. If anyone had this happen and fixed it, please let me know. I'm running out of patience with it and I honestly miss when I could pop in a game and start playing before I finish making a cup of coffee.",1,1763240613.0,PlayStation_X,1,1.0,False

Firstly GET TO BED at LEAST 7 hours before the next shift every night. Obviously if there's circumstances you can't control then that's what you'll just have to deal with. I'd recommend using a different alarm clock than your phone as you don't want to be wasting time scrolling and then it's 5 hours till your shift. I'M  really guilty of this and it messes you up 😵. SLEEP IS SO IMPORTANT so at least just fur these few weeks at least get straight to bed when it's about that 7 or 8 hour mark before waking up.

Following on from that I'd use caffeine if you need it but try to just have white or black coffees with NO sugar. You feel more energised from the sugar for an hour but you WILL crash especially with long back to back shifts. I'd reccomend not having it too late in your shift as it could be hard to get to sleep too. Energy drinks I really wouldn't say to use more than 2 a week as they're bad for you and get you too alert you can't rest properly after.

Buy comfy shoes or get good insoles. If you don't need safety shoes I'd recommend adidas ultraboost trainers (sneakers for  Americans 😄). It's expensive but the comfort pay off for me for hard draining shifts on my feet for 10 hours really makes a difference! 

Sip water ALL day. It helps your muscles, aches, mental functioning but most of all for me my mood. When I'm hydrated I feel so much better and the day is much calmer even with all the chaos and noise beeping etc around. I'd reccomend get a nice water bottle you really like so you're encouraged and keep filling it up. I promise it'll help you 🙏

Don't overwork yourself. Keep yourself at a nice steady pace and when you're like 10-20 percent over rate I'd reccomend having a little chat with someone you can have small talk with for a few minutes for interaction as that's also good for you 😄. I get people are introverts and don't want to talk and so just stop work for a couple of minutes or go have a wee to break the day up and calm down from the repetiveness every couple of hours 😄

Good luck guys! Well done anyone surviving peak deserves respect in my eyes.

I couldn't handle that kind of attention i started hiding but recently his warmth and care just changed something in me his unpretentious nature is magnetic..

Recently he shared his life struggles and what he can offer in partnership his past a bit..

1oy2sbq,https://www.reddit.com/r/FoundandExpose/comments/1oy2sbq/aita_for_having_my_entire_life_destroyed_over_one/,AITA for having my entire life destroyed over ONE text when my husband hasn't touched me in a year?,"I sent a text meant for my best friend to my husband instead and destroyed my entire life in under ten minutes.

My husband travels for work. Two weeks every month he's gone and I'm home alone in our house that his parents helped us buy. We've been married five years and I thought I was doing a good job pretending everything was fine.

I met someone at my gym four months ago. Personal trainer, 29, the kind of guy who smiles at everyone and makes you feel like the only person in the room. My husband is 38 and hasn't touched me in over a year. Hasn't really looked at me either. I know that doesn't make it okay but that's where my head was.

It started small. Coffee after sessions. Then drinks. Then his apartment.

Last night my husband was supposed to be in Seattle until Friday. I went to the trainer's place after work. We had sex and I was lying there in his bed at like 11pm feeling powerful and reckless and stupid all at once. I pulled out my phone to text my best friend because she's the only one who knew what was happening.

I typed: ""He finished what you started.""

I meant it as a joke. A cruel joke about how my husband couldn't satisfy me anymore and someone else could. I was going to send it to Sarah. We'd been texting about my marriage problems for months and she knew about the affair.

I hit send.

Then I saw the name at the top.

Not Sarah.

My husband.

I watched the screen. The message showed delivered. Then I saw the three dots appear. He was typing. The dots kept going. Six minutes of those dots bouncing while I sat frozen in another man's bed wearing nothing but a t-shirt that wasn't mine.

The dots stopped.

No reply came.

I called him twelve times. He didn't answer. I threw up in the trainer's bathroom and he kept asking what was wrong but I couldn't speak. I got dressed and drove home going 90 the whole way.

Every light was on in our house.

His car was in the driveway even though he was supposed to be across the country. I tried my key. It didn't work. He'd changed the locks.

I pounded on the door and he opened it but didn't let me in. He was holding his phone and his face was completely blank. That scared me more than if he'd been screaming.

""When did you get home,"" I said.

""I've been home since 8pm. My meeting got canceled. I was going to surprise you but you weren't here.""

I started crying. Tried to push past him. He blocked me.

""Please let me explain.""

""Explain to who? Me? I already forwarded your text to my mom and dad and both my brothers and your parents too. Everyone knows what you did. Everyone knows what you are.""

My stomach dropped. ""You didn't.""

""I did. My mom's been calling for twenty minutes asking what 'he finished what you started' means. Want to help me explain it to her?""

I couldn't breathe. His parents are traditional Catholic people who already thought I wasn't good enough for him. They co-signed our mortgage. His mom texts me every Sunday about church.

""Your stuff is in trash bags on the side of the house. I'll mail anything I missed. Don't contact me. My lawyer will contact you.""

He shut the door.

I sat on the porch steps until 3am when his brother showed up and told me to leave or he'd call the police. I'm staying at a motel now. Sarah won't answer my calls. My own parents won't answer either because his parents already called them.

I texted my husband this morning trying to apologize but the messages won't deliver. He blocked me.

His mom called me from his phone an hour ago. She said I broke her son's heart and destroyed their family's trust and she'll never forgive me for humiliating them. Then she said they're talking to a lawyer about the house since they helped with the down payment and they want me to sign it over.

The trainer blocked me too after I tried to explain what happened.

I know I cheated. I know that's wrong. But I feel like forwarding that text to his entire family and changing the locks while I was gone was extreme. He didn't even give me a chance to talk. Now everyone I know thinks I'm garbage and I might lose everything including the house.

My sister says I deserve it for cheating but it was one mistake sent to the wrong person. Was he really justified in blowing up my entire life over one text? AITAH?

Hey everyone!
My name is Samy, I’m 23, and I recently moved to Lisbon. Like many newcomers, I arrived here without knowing anyone, and I realized a lot of people are in the same situation — new city, new country, new culture… but no idea how to actually meet people or make friends.

A bit about me:
I’m into basketball (194cm lol) , fashion, acting, exploring the city, and talking with people from different backgrounds. I speak English, Arabic, French, and Russian, so I love meeting international people and sharing languages. I’ve lived in different countries before, and each place has its own way of making social connections — now I’m trying to understand how it works in Lisbon.

What I’ve noticed so far:
• A lot of expats and students come here, but many still feel isolated
• People are friendly, but everyone seems busy and spread across the city
• It’s hard to know which places, apps, or communities actually help you meet new friends
• Some join gyms, some go to language exchanges, some connect through sports or meetup groups

So here’s my question to the community:
👉 If you moved to Lisbon, how did YOU find friends?
👉 Where do people usually socialize here?
👉 What helped you integrate into the city?

And at the same time, I’m also open to meeting people myself. If you’re new here too — or even if you’ve been in Lisbon for a while — feel free to comment or reach out. We can share experiences, explore the city, hang out for coffee, or even play some basketball.

Let’s help each other make Lisbon feel like home.

1oy2qw5,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1oy2qw5/theres_a_legend_about_the_bridge_in_our_town_and/,"There's a legend about the bridge in our town, and I shouldn't doubt its truth.","Lucy and I became best friends on our first day of third grade. That day, she punched Ridley because he pulled my hair. She was taken to the principal's office, and I waited for her on the bench outside, swinging my legs, a warm feeling welling up in my chest. When she came out, her eyes were red from crying, but her chin remained firm. I gave her half of my peanut butter sandwich.

“I’m allergic to peanuts,” she said.

""Ok? Would you like some of my apple juice?""

She took the apple juice, and from that moment on, we were inseparable.

Growing up in Millbrook was like living in a crystal ball, beautifully enclosed, artificially creating an aesthetic, but you always knew there was a pane of glass separating you from the real world. There were only eight thousand people, one high school, two churches, and a five-cent shop on the main street where candy cost five cents. It was like a place where everyone knew each other, a feeling that was reassuring until you realized it also meant everyone knew each other's secrets.

Or rather, they thought they knew.

Like all small towns, Millbrook is steeped in legends. Stories are passed down from brother to sister, whispered around pajama parties and campfires. Most are similar: a murder occurred in the house at the end of Buck Street in the 1950s; at midnight, you see lights floating in the cemetery; and there's the old quarry where teenagers used to go drinking, sometimes never to return.

But what fascinates me most is the story of the Old Mill Bridge and the Devil's Mist.

The legend goes that every twenty years, a special mist envelops Millbrook. It's not ordinary fog, but something entirely different and absolutely silent. If you're standing on Old Mill Bridge when the Devil's Mist appears, and you sing a specific song as you cross, the mist will transport you to another place. Not just a different geographical location, but a completely different world. Another version of Millbrook. A parallel universe where everything is entirely different.

The song is probably ""She Moved Through the Fair,"" an old Irish folk song. The melody is said to be repetitive, telling a tragic story of discovering a loved one's death. Legend has it that you must sing the lyrics three times continuously while crossing the bridge, without looking back. If you sing it correctly, you will enter another world when the fog dissipates.

Most people treat this as a joke. Every twenty years, on the night the fog is supposed to appear, teenagers make bets to see who dares to sing this song while crossing the bridge. But nothing happens. When the fog dissipates, they remain in familiar Millbrook, perhaps a little disappointed, but mostly relieved.

The last time the fog appeared was in 1995, five years before Lucy and I were born. This meant the next ""fog"" would arrive in 2015, when we were fifteen. Lucy and I spent hours discussing it, planning to sneak out that night to experience the ritual ourselves, purely for fun.

But by 2015, we had almost completely forgotten about it. We were busy with high school, busy dating boys, and busy with the anxieties of being seventeen and thinking we knew everything.

Lucy's dad was one of the topics we no longer talked about.

Mr. Thompson had always been different. I remember him as a child. A tall, thin man with kind eyes, doing odd jobs in town. He had been a janitor at the elementary school, then a gardener at the cemetery, and then unemployed for a while. Lucy never wanted to talk about why he kept losing jobs, but I heard rumors. Adults whispering. ""Alcoholic,"" ""unreliable,"" and later, only ""homeless.""

By the time we were in high school, Mr. Thompson had become an invisible man in Milbrook. You would occasionally see him in the city center, sitting on a bench outside the library or begging for change near the grocery store. People would go out of their way to avoid him. Lucy no longer invited me to her house—well, there weren't many houses left to invite me to. She lived with her father in a run-down apartment above the laundromat, and I knew she was ashamed of it.

But Lucy never stopped loving him. She would secretly stuff food from the school cafeteria into her bag to feed him. She would give him the money she earned as a babysitter. When other kids mocked him, she would stand up for him without hesitation.

“He’s sick,” she would say, her voice strained. “It’s not his fault. If people help him instead of judging him, he’ll get better.”

I believed her. I always believed Lucy.

That fall, around our seventeenth birthday, everything changed. Lucy started acting strange—she was always nervous and distracted and constantly looking back as if someone was following her. She no longer stayed up late after school for cheerleading practice. She would turn pale when she received a phone call.

“Is everything alright?” I asked her one October day, watching her stare at her phone, her expression unreadable.

“Yes,” she blurted out, her voice too hurried. ""Everything's fine.""

But I knew things weren't good. Things weren't good.

I just didn't expect things to get this bad.

November 15th, 2015, Sunday. I remember it clearly because Coach Henderson annoyed me by scheduling cheerleading practice on Sunday night; we were supposed to be home watching movies. We had an important game coming up, and she made us practice over and over until it was perfect.

Lucy and I were the last ones left in the gym, practicing a throw, but we kept failing. I tossed her up; she turned, but she just wouldn't land properly. On the seventh try, she landed hard on her ankle, yelling in pain.

""That's it,"" I said, grabbing my bag. ""This is it. If this keeps up, you'll ruin your ankle.""

""If I don't get it right by Friday, the coach will kill me.""

""The coach can handle it. Let's go home.""

We walked into the November night, our breath condensing into mist in the cold air. The sun had already set when we practiced, and the temperature had dropped. I pulled my coat tighter.

“Want to go to Angie Mama’s for pizza?” I asked. Angie Mama's is in the city center, open late on weekends, and always a popular spot for all the high school students.

Lucy shook her head. “No. I have to go home.”

“Why? Do you have a date?”

“No, I just… I have to go see my dad. He wasn’t feeling well this morning.”

I wanted to ask what “wasn’t feeling well” meant, but the closed-off look on Lucy’s face suggested she didn’t want to talk about it. So I just nodded, and we started walking.

Millbrook wasn’t a big town. You could walk from one end to the other in less than an hour. Lucy and I lived on opposite sides of Old Miller Bridge; I lived in the nicer neighborhood with big houses and manicured lawns; she lived on the east side, in an area of ​​apartments and small houses. Over the years, we’d walked home together hundreds of times from school, practice fields, and friends’ houses. This had become our daily routine, and it made us feel safe.

The bridge was almost exactly halfway between our two worlds.

About five minutes from the bridge, I noticed the temperature had dropped again. The air was damp and heavy; I could see my breath condense into a thick white mist.

“This weather is weird,” Lucy said, rubbing her arms.

“Yeah.”

We reached the bridge entrance. Old Miller Bridge was an old bridge, built in the 1920s, entirely made of wooden planks and rusty iron railings. The townspeople had always said they wanted to tear it down and build a modern bridge, but the budget had never been right. So the bridge stood there quietly, creaking and swaying slightly as you walked across it, with Miller Creek flowing thirty feet below.

The streetlights disappeared about twenty feet from the bridgehead. There were no lights on the bridge, so crossing it at night meant traversing a long stretch of darkness before reaching the light on the other side.

We stepped onto the bridge, and just then, the fog began to roll in.

At first, the fog were just wisps of smoke, clinging to our ankles like curious kittens. But within seconds, it thickened, rising from the stream below and surging in from all directions. I'd seen fog before; Milbrook sometimes gets foggy in the fall, but never this thick. It was almost solid, pure white, and impenetrable.

""Wow,"" Lucy gasped. ""This fog is so thick.""

Then I remembered. November 15, 2015. Twenty years since the last time it appeared.

""Lucy,"" I said slowly, ""what's the date?""

""What? November 15th. What's wrong?""

""The legend. That bridge. This should be—""

""Impossible."" Lucy's eyes widened. “The fog? That’s just a story.”

“Then what is this?”

We stood there, the fog thickening until I could barely see Lucy, even though she was right beside me. The temperature plummeted, and my teeth began to chatter.

“We should go back,” I said.

But when I turned, I couldn’t see the way we’d come. The fog swallowed everything. I couldn’t see the town behind me, I couldn’t see the end of the bridge, nothing but white.

“I can’t see the way back,” Lucy said, and for the first time, I heard fear in her voice.

“Okay, okay, let’s keep going. The bridge isn’t that long; it’ll be on the other side in two minutes.”

“Jenny, what if it’s real? What about the legend?”

“Then let’s not sing. We’ll just walk across silently. It’s simple.”

Lucy grabbed my hand. Her fingers were cold, or perhaps mine were. “Don’t let go,” she whispered.

“I won’t, I promise.”

We started walking. Our footsteps echoed on the wooden planks, muffled by the fog, sounding somewhat eerie. I silently counted my steps, trying to gauge how far we'd gone. Ten steps. Twenty steps. Thirty steps. We should be on the other side by now. The bridge isn't that long.

""Jenny, I feel like we're going in circles.""

""Impossible. We're walking in a straight line.""

But she was right. Something was wrong. We felt like we'd been walking for five minutes, yet we were still enveloped in fog, still standing on the bridge. Unless we hadn't moved at all? Maybe we were just standing still, and the fog was creating an illusion of movement?

""Sing a song,"" Lucy suddenly said.

""What?""

""Sing a song. Any song. I want to hear your voice. I need to know you're still here.""

So I started singing. The first song that came to mind was the one we learned in elementary school music class. ""In beautiful Dublin, the girls are so beautiful, and I saw sweet Molly Marlon at first glance…’""

But what I sang was, “My young love said to me, ‘My mother won’t mind.’ ‘And my father won’t slight you for your lack of kind.’ And she stepped away from me, and this she did say: ‘It will not be long, love, till our wedding day…’”

“Jenny, no!” Lucy gripped my hand tightly. “Don’t sing that song! It’s a legendary song!”

I stopped immediately, my heart pounding. “I didn’t mean to. It was just the first song that came to mind.”

“Then think of something else!”

But it was all set in stone. Perhaps it was destined from the moment we stepped onto the bridge. Because the fog had changed. It no longer merely enveloped us; it penetrated us, cold and intrusive, as if trying to reach into our hearts and reshape something fundamental.

I felt Lucy’s hand slip from mine.

“Lucy?”

No response. “Lucy!”

I whirled around and outstretched my hands but could only grasp at the cold air. The fog was so thick I couldn't even see my own hands.

“Lucy!”

I stumbled forward, or perhaps backward; I couldn't tell. My foot tripped over something, and I fell, my hands slamming heavily against the wood. I knelt, gasping for breath, fear gripping my throat.

Then, as suddenly as it appeared, the fog dissipated.

I was on the other side of the bridge, kneeling on the sidewalk of Maple Avenue, bathed in the harsh yellow light of the streetlights. Behind me, the bridge stretched into ordinary darkness; the fog was gone. The November night was clear and starry.

Lucy was gone.

The next few hours I remember almost nothing. Only a chaotic jumble of panic and disbelief. I remember running back to the bridge, screaming Lucy's name. I remember shining my phone's flashlight into the stream below, terrified to see her body lying on the rocks. I remember Mr. Peterson coming out of the house in his bathrobe and asking if I was alright.

“My friend,” I said over and over. “My friend Lucy. She was with me. She’s missing.”

Mr. Peterson called my parents. My parents called the police. The police came with flashlights and searched the bridge, the creek, and the woods on both sides. They asked me questions. What was I doing? Had we been drinking? Had Lucy said she was upset? Had we argued?

“No, nothing. We were just on our way home. Suddenly it got foggy. She took my hand, and then she didn’t.”

The policeman, Officer Davidson, whom I’d known since I was a child—he’d given a lecture in my elementary school about the dangers of strangers—looked at me with that pitying look that made me want to scream.

“Jenny, honey, there’s no fog tonight. It’s been clear weather all night.”

“There is fog. There’s fog on the bridge. It’s so thick I can’t see anything.”

“Shall we take you home? It’s late. You must be terrified.”

They took me home. Mom made me hot chocolate, but I couldn't drink it. Dad sat on the edge of the bed, gently stroking my hair like he used to do in my childhood nightmares.

""Everything will be alright,"" he said. ""We'll find your friend.""

But his voice sounded off. Hollow. It was as if he was saying what he should say, but not from the heart.

I didn't sleep that night. At six in the morning, I started dialing Lucy's cell phone. No answer.

At seven, I went downstairs. Mom was making breakfast.

""Mom, we have to go to Lucy's. We have to see her dad. He must know where she is.""

Mom's hand hovered over the coffee pot, without turning around. ""Jenny, honey, I think you should eat something. You must be exhausted.""

""I'm not hungry. I have to find Lucy.""

""Baby..."" She finally turned around, her face full of concern. ""Lucy doesn't exist.""

These words sounded nonsensical. I heard them, but my mind went blank. ""What?""

""You were alone on the bridge last night. The police investigated school records. There is no student named Lucy Thompson at Millbrook High School. Never.

“Impossible. She’s my best friend. We’ve been friends since third grade. She’s on the cheerleading team with me. She was practicing last night. Coach Henderson was there too. She saw Lucy.”

“Coach Henderson said you practiced alone late last night. You asked her if you could practice your stunts by yourself.”

“No, no, that’s not right. Lucy was there. Lucy is real.”""

Mom came over and hugged me. I stood stiffly in her arms, my mind a jumble. This wasn't right. Nothing was right. Lucy was real. I had so many memories of her. Hundreds and thousands.

The day we ate sandwiches together in third grade. For Halloween in sixth grade, we dressed up as ketchup and mustard. In freshman year, we were both kept after school for passing notes in English class. Just last week, we were studying chemistry. I was doing a test at the kitchen table, and Lucy made up a funny song to help me remember the periodic table.

“I think we should take you to see Dr. Morrison,” Mom said gently. “He can help you.”

Dr. Morrison was the only psychiatrist in Millbrook. He was a kind old man with white hair and a soft voice. I had seen him once before, when my grandmother had passed away and I couldn't sleep.

That afternoon I went to see him. I sat in the leather chair in his book-filled office and told him everything. About Lucy. About the fog. Almost everyone was acting as if she had never existed.

He listened quietly, without interrupting, his hands clasped under his chin. After I finished, he was silent for a long time.

“Jenny,” he finally spoke, “have you ever heard of false memories?”

“Lucy wasn’t a false memory. She was real.”

“Our brains are amazing. Sometimes, especially under stress, it creates very vivid, very realistic memories that never actually happened. It’s a coping mechanism.”

“I’m not crazy.”

“I didn’t say you’re crazy. I said your brain might be trying to help you cope with something. Has anything very stressful happened in your life recently?”""

I really wanted to throw something at his understanding face. But I didn't. I just sat there, my hands clenched tightly on my knees, feeling something deep inside me begin to crumble.

Over the next few days, I tried everything. I went to the school and asked them to re-examine the records. I went to the cheerleading coach and showed her the photos on my phone, but when I opened the album, there were no pictures of Lucy. Only photos of myself, in every place I remembered Lucy being.

I went to the apartment where Lucy and her father lived. It was empty. Not just empty, but..."" There was no sign of anyone having ever lived there. The walls were bare, and the floors were covered in dust. The landlord said the apartment had been vacant for six months.

I went downtown, looking for Lucy's father, the homeless man everyone knew. I asked shopkeepers, other homeless people, anyone willing to listen. Nobody knew who I was talking about. They said there was no homelessness problem in Millbrook. People here can take care of themselves.

I searched for Lucy Thompson online. Social media, school records, birth certificate—nothing. It was as if she had been erased from existence. She was gone, erased from the past. As if she had never existed.

Yet, I remember her. I remember everything about her.

Slowly, and terrifyingly, I began to doubt myself.

Maybe I'm going crazy. Maybe I've created a fabricated friend, unable to distinguish between fantasy and reality. Maybe that fog never happened. Maybe I walked across that bridge alone, as I had countless times before, and something in my brain suddenly… collapsed.

People started looking at me strangely. Conversations would abruptly stop the moment I entered a room. I noticed my teachers looking at me with concern. My parents began… They made up all sorts of excuses to prevent me from going out with my friends, forcing me to stay home and rest.

Two weeks after that night on the bridge, I stopped mentioning Lucy.

What else could I do?

But I never forgot her. And deep down, I never stopped believing she had ever existed.

After graduating high school, I left Millbrook immediately. I went to two universities out of state, earning a degree in psychology—perhaps to understand what had happened to me, perhaps to prove I wasn't insane. In my junior year, I met George in a cognitive neuroscience class.

George It was reassuring. George was rational and kind and believed in things that could be measured and proven. George didn't believe the fog would devour people, nor did he believe the town would erase the girl's existence. George believed in synapses, neurons, and chemical reactions.

I never mentioned Lucy to him.

A year after graduation, we got married. The wedding was held in court; it was a small affair, attended only by immediate family.

We moved to a suburb forty miles from Millbrook. Close enough to visit, but far enough so I wouldn't have to see the bridge every day. We bought a small house with a yard. George got a job at a research hospital. I opened a private practice, primarily serving teenagers, trying to help them through trauma in ways no one had ever helped me with before.

We had Lucy first (I named her in memory), and two years later, Michael. My love for them was sometimes so intense it frightened me. I would check on them constantly at night, making sure they were still breathing, still real, still around. George thought I was overprotective. He didn't understand how quickly I knew people could disappear.

The nightmare began around the time Michael... It started six months after I was born.

It's always the same dream: I'm pushing a stroller across a bridge. Fog is thick. I look down at the stroller; it's empty. I search in the fog, calling out to my children, but I can't find them. Sometimes in the dream, I'm constantly searching for my children. Sometimes, I'm looking for Lucy. Sometimes, I can't even remember who I've lost, only that they're gone, and it's all my fault.

I wake up with a start, gasping for breath, the sheets soaked with sweat, my heart pounding as if it's going to explode. George will hold me, gently comforting me, saying it's okay, it's just... I dreamt that the children were all fine, and everything would be alright.

But that wasn't the case.

The nightmares grew worse. Three, four, or five times a night. I was afraid to sleep. During the day, I started seeing things too—shadows moving like people, whispers coming from the whirring of the baby monitor. I was playing with the children when suddenly, a strong conviction washed over me: they weren't real, just like everyone said; I was imagining Lucy.

One morning at three, George found me standing by Michael's crib, silently weeping.

""She's real,"" I whispered. ""Lucy is real. I held her hand. I know I did.""

""Jen, honey, you need to talk to someone. This isn't healthy.""

""I've talked to people. They all say I made her up.""

""Then maybe—"" He paused, choosing his words carefully. ""Maybe you need to accept it. Maybe that's the only way you can heal."" “ I looked at him, the man I married, the man with whom I built my life, and felt utterly alone.

“I’ll call tomorrow,” I said. “I’ll seek help.”

Dr. Patricia’s office was filled with the scent of lavender and old books. She was in her sixties, her silver hair meticulously pulled back in a bun, her eyes revealing so much. George had found her online, “the best trauma therapist in the state,” he said.

I didn’t immediately tell her about Lucy. I spoke indirectly about nightmares, anxiety, and the feeling of not being able to trust myself. She listened quietly, without judgment, occasionally taking notes and asking gentle questions.

It wasn’t until the fourth session that she asked, “Jenny, when did these nightmares start? Can you trace them back to a specific event?”""

Suddenly, I told her everything. About Lucy. About the bridge. About the fog. About everyone saying she didn't exist. I talked for an hour straight, pouring out everything I'd suppressed for ten years.

After I finished, the doctor was silent for a long time.

""Do you think Lucy is real?"" she finally asked.

""I know she is real. But I also know that all the evidence points to her not. So, maybe I'm going crazy.""

""What if you're not crazy? What if something else happened?""

I gave a bitter smile. ""Like what? She disappeared from reality? I traveled to a parallel universe? That's no different from admitting you have delusions.""

""Memory is complex. Sometimes trauma represses memories, hiding them, making them inaccessible to our consciousness. But they still exist.""

""Do you think I have repressed memories?""

""I think it's worth exploring. Would you like to try hypnotherapy?""""

I was so desperate I was willing to try anything.

The next session, the doctor dimmed the lights and had me lie on her sofa. She guided me into a hypnotic state with a low, rhythmic voice. I felt myself sinking, layers of consciousness overlapping, like sinking into deep water.

“Back to the bridge,” she said. “Back to that night with Lucy. Tell me what you saw.”

I was there. Not remembering. Experiencing. I was back to being seventeen, in my cheerleading outfit, with Lucy beside me. A thick fog rolled in, unsettlingly thick.

But this time, I kept watching. This time, I didn't forget the moment Lucy's hand slipped from mine.

I saw her being pulled back into the fog. I saw figures moving in the white, not supernatural, but human. I heard heavy, urgent voices.

“Got her.”

“Was it really necessary?”

“You know it was. Her father knows too much. He's been talking to that reporter.” ""We can't risk it—""

Lucy screamed. I tried to reach her, but someone grabbed me from behind and held me rooted to the spot.

""She saw it,"" someone said. It was a woman's voice, familiar, but I couldn't place it.

""Give her the injection. Make her forget.""

A sharp pain shot through my arm. The world began to blur and distort.

""Jenny, listen carefully,"" the woman's voice rang out again, right next to my ear. ""You'll forget Lucy. She was never your friend. You don't know a Lucy Thompson at all. You crossed this bridge alone tonight. Can you say it again?""

I heard my own voice, muffled, distant, and far away: ""I crossed this bridge alone.""

""Good girl. When you wake up tomorrow, it will all be like a nightmare. Lucy Thompson never existed. Her father never existed. None of this ever happened. That's better. Better for everyone. Especially for you."" The fog lifted. I stood alone on the other side of the bridge, not understanding why I had collapsed, why my arm ached.

In the doctor's office, I sobbed uncontrollably, my body trembling.

""What did you see?"" she asked softly.

""They took her,"" I gasped. ""They took Lucy and made me forget everything. Oh, God..."" ""They drugged me. They made me forget her.""

""Who took her?""

""I don't know. I couldn't see her face. But they knew her father. They said he spoke to a reporter. Talked about something. Something they dared not risk...""

I sat bolt upright, a flood of possibilities rushing through my mind. ""They killed her. Right? Because her father knew something. And then they made the whole town forget she existed.""

""Jenny, you need to think carefully. The mass memory manipulation you described is scientifically impossible. But trauma can cause our brains to fabricate stories to explain things we don't understand."" “You think I’m making this up too.”

“I think you’ve experienced something real and painful, and your brain is trying to process it.” Hypnosis has helped you awaken a repressed memory, but we need to interpret it carefully—”

“I have to go back,” I interrupted her. “I have to go back to Millbrook. Back to that bridge.”

“I don’t think it’s a good time to go back. You’re vulnerable right now—”

But I had already stood up and grabbed my purse. Ten years. I’d spent ten years thinking I was going crazy, thinking I was making up my best friend. But I wasn’t. Lucy was real. And she’d been through terrible things.

I needed to know the truth.

I called George from the car.

“I have to go see my parents,” I said. “Could you babysit the kids for me tonight?”

“Sure. Is everything alright? Did anything happen during therapy?”

“I’m fine. I just… I just need to talk to them. I’ll explain when I get home.”

I gripped the steering wheel tightly, my heart pounding, and drove toward Millbrook. The hypnosis seemed to awaken some kind of memory, fragments flooding back like a tide. Not just memories of Lucy, but also the expressions on my parents' faces that night. There was a hint of guilt in their eyes as they looked at me. Everyone in town quickly rallied, supporting one another.

They knew. They all knew.

As evening fell, I arrived on the outskirts of Millbrook. The town was as usual: neat houses, tree-lined streets, and the white church steeple towering above the shops on the main street. Perfect.

About five minutes from my parents' house, I saw it: Old Miller Bridge.

I hadn't planned to take this route. There was another way to my parents' house, completely avoiding the bridge. But for some reason, my car had brought me here, as if drawn by a force I couldn't understand.

Just then, I saw the fog.

The fog was rising. Thick white fog drifted from the stream below, eerily suffocating. I gasped. I pulled the car over, got out, and stared blankly.

Then it dawned on me: twenty years had passed since that night and twenty years since it appeared.

It's back.

I should have kept driving. I should have gone to my parents' house, confronted them, and demanded to know what had happened to Lucy. That was my original plan. That's why I drove here.

But I couldn't stop staring at the fog, couldn't stop thinking about the legend. The fog that appears every twenty years. That song that supposedly allows you to travel between two worlds.

What if it's all true? What if that night, Lucy and I really did travel to another world? A world where she never existed, a world where her father never existed, a world where the secret they'd always kept never existed. Threatened?

If that's the case, if I really did travel between two worlds, maybe I could go back.

I started walking towards the bridge, my hands trembling. The rational part of me, the part that studied neuroscience with George, that part that built evidence-based medicine systems, was screaming at me to stop. This is madness. Fog is just fog. Parallel universes don't exist. I'm breaking down; I need to turn to help.

But another part of me, the part that never stopped believing in Lucy The sound grew louder.

I stepped onto the bridge.

The fog immediately surged up, enveloping my ankles, waist, and chest. The same biting cold. The same thick, vibrant texture. The world behind me vanished instantly. I couldn't see the town. I couldn't see my car. Nothing but white.

My heart pounded, and I felt like I was about to faint. I started walking forward, my arms outstretched. I groped my way along the railing.

Then I started singing.

My voice sounded strange in the fog, muffled and distant. I kept walking, kept singing, trying to remember all the lyrics. Lucy and I had learned this song in elementary school music class. I couldn't remember why we learned it.

The fog grew thicker. Heavier. I couldn't feel the bridge beneath my feet anymore. I felt nothing but the sensation of falling, a feeling of being destroyed and rebuilt.

The last verse. I sang the last syllable, my voice choking at the final word. Then, only silence, cold, and white remained.

Then, the fog lifted.

I stood on the other side of the bridge. Under the streetlights. On the maple-lined avenue.

But everything was wrong.

Not the kind of catastrophic, earth-shattering thing. Not the kind of obvious, glaring thing. Just… a thousand subtle things hinted at something amiss. The streetlights were the same ones, but for some reason, they were new, the paint fresh, not peeling. The houses in the distance were a different color, and the cars parked in the driveway were different. The air smelled different too, fresher, with a faint floral scent I couldn't quite place.

Lucy was standing under the streetlight, wearing the exact same cheerleading outfit I'd worn ten years ago.

“Jenny!” She rushed over and grabbed my hand. Her face was exactly as I remembered—seventeen, vibrant, real. “Oh my god, where did you go? You just vanished! One second you were beside me, the next you were gone! I was terrified!”

I couldn't say a word; I couldn't breathe. I just stood there, staring blankly at her, tears streaming down my face.

“Jenny? Are you alright? Did you hit your head? The way you're looking at me is so strange.” Her face was full of worry.

I finally found my voice, though it was a whisper. “Lucy. You're here. You're real.”

“Of course I'm real. What happened? What happened in the fog? How long have you been gone?”

“How long?” I asked, half-crying, half-laughing. “How long have I been gone?”

“I don’t know, maybe two or three minutes? But it felt like forever. I couldn’t see you, and I couldn’t hear you. I thought you’d fallen off the bridge, or—” She stopped.

I looked down at myself.

I was wearing my cheerleading uniform. The blue and gold Milbrook High School uniform, with my name embroidered on the front. My legs were bare in the November wind. On my feet were the worn white Nike sneakers I’d worn to practice that night, tied with blue laces. I slowly raised my left hand, terrified of what I would see.

No ring. My fingers were bare. Smooth. Young. “No,” I whispered, “no, no, no.”

My hands trembled as I touched my cheeks. The skin felt different. Smoother, firmer. I pulled out my phone, the phone that should have held photos of Sarah and Michael, George’s text messages, and all the electronic records of my life.

It was the iPhone 5s I’d sold, the lock screen showing a picture of myself at seventeen, grinning at the camera, wearing the same cheerleading outfit. The date was November 15, 2015.

“Jenny, you scared me to death.” Lucy grabbed my arm. “Come on, we’ll walk you home. Maybe you’re having another panic attack. My dad says stress can make people do weird things.”

“Your dad.” I looked up at her, clinging to this detail as if it were a lifeline. “Lucy, what does your dad do? Does he work?”

“He’s a dental assistant at Dr. Morrison’s clinic. You know, you’ve always known. Are you sure you didn’t bump your head in the fog?”

“A dental assistant,” I repeated. Not a homeless man, not the bad guy everyone was whispering about. Just a dental assistant.

“Yeah, he works for Dr. Morrison, the dentist on the street. He’s probably still there packing up. He usually doesn’t get home until late.” Lucy spoke quickly, sounding a little nervous, trying to break the silence, while I just stood there, staring at my bare hands.

“Come on,” Lucy said, tugging at my arm. “I’ll take you home. Your mother knows what to do.”

I let her lead me down the bridge and through streets that looked almost exactly like the Millbrook I knew, but with some differences. A house painted yellow instead of blue. A car that shouldn’t be there. A slightly different street sign.

We walked in silence, Lucy glancing at me anxiously every few seconds. I couldn't utter a word.

Or had I really been here before? Maybe this was my original world. Maybe the past ten years, George, the children, the life I built—it was all an illusion. Maybe that night ten years ago, I crossed that road, and now, I've finally found my way home.

But if that's the case, where is George? Where are my children?

We arrived at my parents' house, or rather, a version of it. Same address, same basic structure, only the blinds were blue instead of white. A different car was parked in the driveway, a silver sedan. Someone I didn't recognize.

Lucy walked me to the door and rang the doorbell.

My mother opened the door, and I almost collapsed to the floor in relief. She looked exactly the same. Maybe a little younger than the last time I saw her, but her eyes were still gentle, her smile still warm. She didn't get cancer when I had my first child; she didn't die…

“Jenny? Lucy? I thought you went straight to Lucy's after practice.” She looked me over carefully, her smile a little stiff. “Honey, are you alright? You don't look good.”

“She was acting a bit strange since the bridge,” Lucy explained. “I think the fog scared her. She's been behaving really oddly lately.”

“Come in, I'll make some hot chocolate.” mom placing a warm hand on my back.

The house felt both familiar and strange. The layout was the same, the basic furniture was the same, but some small details were different. The curtains were different. The paintings on the walls were different. I flipped through my photos, trying to piece together what my life in this world was really like.

In one elementary school photo, I was grinning, with gaps between my teeth. In a middle school photo, I was wearing braces, looking a little clumsy. And in a high school photo, I was wearing a cheerleader uniform, Lucy was next to me, and we were both making faces. But then nothing happened. No college graduation photos. No wedding photos. No pictures of grandchildren for my parents to be proud of. I had to tell myself it was because none of that had happened yet. I was only seventeen. Still in high school. It was just the beginning of my life.

Mom brought us steaming hot chocolate, made the same way I did as a child, with extra marshmallows and a candy cane to stir it. That familiar sweetness made my throat tighten.

“Well,” Mom sat down across from us and asked, “What happened?”

“We were crossing the bridge,” Lucy said. “The fog came in, really thick, Mrs. Paterson. You should see, Jenny’s terrified. She’s starting to ask strange questions, like she doesn’t know where she is.”

“I’m fine,” I managed to say. “It’s just… the fog is terrifying. That’s all.”

Mom reached out and touched my forehead. “You don’t have a fever. But you look tired, honey. When was the last time you had a good night’s sleep?”

I wanted to say, ""Six months ago, before the nightmares started."" Before I started seeing a therapist. Before I remembered what happened to Lucy, except that it didn’t happen here. Here, Lucy is fine. Here, Lucy never disappeared.

“I’m fine,” I changed my tune. “Just a little tired.”

“Then you should go to bed early. You have school tomorrow.” Mom glanced at her watch. “Your dad will be home soon too. He’s still tutoring students at the high school.”

I froze, my cup still raised to my lips. “Dad…tutoring students?”

“Yes, honey, he goes every Tuesday night. You know that.” Mom smiled lovingly. “That’s the downside of being a teacher, isn’t it? The work is never-ending. He always has to stay behind to help students who are struggling or take homework home to grade. But he enjoys it.”

A teacher. In this world, my father is a teacher.

In my other world, the place I've lived for the past ten years, my father was a policeman. I remember him in his uniform, the static from his radio, and the way he worked late into the night.

But here, he's a teacher. A high school teacher, often staying late to tutor students.

Everything has changed. Not just Lucy. Not just her father. Everything has changed.

“Does your dad know where you are?” Mom asked Lucy. “Should I call him?”

“He’s still at the dentist,” Lucy said. “Cleaning up the last patient’s room. He told me he’d be home late.”

“Your dad is such a hard worker,” Mom said warmly. “Dr. Morrison is so lucky to have someone like him. He’s so kind to his patients, especially the anxious little ones.”

I stared at her. Because in my world, in my other world, Mom always deliberately avoided mentioning Lucy’s father. She always seemed uncomfortable whenever his name was mentioned. But here, she spoke of him with genuine respect and warmth.

“I should go home,” Lucy said, finishing her hot chocolate. “Let Jenny rest. She didn’t sleep well last night.” She squeezed my hand. “Text me later, okay? Let me know you’re okay.”

“Okay,” I said, though I wasn’t sure if I could still say “okay.”

After Lucy left, Mom helped me upstairs to my room—my teenage bedroom, which I hadn’t seen in ten years. The same posters on the walls, the same plush toys on the bed, my cheerleading trophy on the shelf. Everything seemed frozen in the past.

“Sleep well, JenJen,” Mom said, kissing my forehead. “Everything will be alright tomorrow.”

But as she closed the door, I sat on that narrow single bed, and I thought, I have to know. I have to know if George is still…here.

I pulled out my phone, this old phone. I opened the browser. My hands trembled so badly I could barely type.

I searched for George Hend. The man I married. My children's father. The one who stood by me through my nightmares, the one who built my life with me. With me.

No results.

I tried again, adding his middle school and his elementary school. The silly YouTube singing account he used to have as a teenager.

Still no results.

I expanded my search to other cities and other states. Maybe he lives somewhere in the world.

But the more I searched, the clearer it became.

I started searching for Lucy. Searching for Michael. Searching for my children. Searching for my babies. Searching for the two people I love most in my life.

Nothing. Nothing. Obviously nothing.

I sat in my teen bedroom, wearing perfume-scented pajamas, wondering if I was home or if I had left home.",9,1763240344.0,nosleep,0,1.0,False

Through personal correspondence with Shrimati Priya Kapoor ji, Director of Roli Books, I was informed about a 2026 reprint of Neha Prasada's ***Dining with the Maharajas: A Thousand Years of Culinary Tradition*** for North America, etc.

If you visit the online store of New Delhi-based CMYK Book Store (Roli Book's book selling store), the book is reportedly in stock, and the total price for shipment from India to the US would be 11,774.00 INR (≈132.7X USD). The book itself is 5995 INR (≈67.60 USD). Shipping from India to the US via FedEx International Priority is another 5779 INR (≈65.16 USD).

I have elected to exercise patience and resilience, deferring the import purchase in anticipation of the forthcoming local release in 2026. I currently possess ***Dining with the Nawabs*** in my personal collection.

***From the Nawab's Kitchen: Wajid Ali Shah's Family Cookbook*** is a forthcoming Awadhi cookery book directly from two members of nawab's family: Fatima Mirza and Shahanshah Mirza, who have since resided in Kolkata, West Bengal, India.

From an article from *Hindustan Times:* ""....Fatima Mirza, a school principal (she is of the line of Wajid Ali Shah’s principal consort, Khas Mahal) and her husband Shahanshah Mirza (his father Wasif Mirza is another great grandson of Wajid Ali Shah)....""

Source to Article: [https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/fatima-and-fatima/story-abpJ85mOQAJEyiY0VfDaON.html](https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/fatima-and-fatima/story-abpJ85mOQAJEyiY0VfDaON.html).

Nawab Wajid Ali Shah was the last nawab (a ruling aristocracy of Awadh, a former princely state) and he was exiled by the British from his crown seat of Awadh (once called ""Oudh"") to a suburb of Metiyaburj in present day Kolkata in West Bengal, India.

>*Family recipes are a cook’s real estate. Wajid Ali Shah’s descendants face the problem of plenty. At the time of his death, the king had 250 wives and 42 children so no ‘family recipe’ matches the other. The British also made sure that after the king’s death in 1887, his days in exile would go undocumented.* —By Paramita Ghosh of Hindustan Times.

According to the same article:

>*Since 2018, she \[Mirza Fatima\] has been working on a cookbook penning family recipes such as Kachhe Tikia ke Kebab. This is the only Awadhi kebab in which sattu is added and it was a Wajid Ali Shah favourite,” she says. “To neutralise the heat of meat and to make it easily digestible, hakeems advised chefs to add sattu (ground Bengal gram) as the king aged. The trend seems to have been to keep things light and fragrant.*

I believe the book the wife-and-husband duo wrote is ***From the Nawab's Kitchen: Wajid Ali Shah's Family Cookbook***. Do I really need another cookbook on Awadhi cuisine? I already have the following:

Bhatnagar, Sangeeta, and R. K. Saxena. *Dastarkhwan-e-Awadh: The Cuisine of Awadh.* Noida, Uttar Pradesh, India: HarperCollins Publishers, 2015.

PS: Based on reviews and detailed previews (excerpts), ***Tehzeeb: Culinary Traditions of Awadh*** by Adil Ahmad isn't a traditional cookbook.

I felt blindsided because if he truly wasn’t ready, he didn’t have to pursue me so consistently or encourage the emotional connection. He could’ve left me alone instead of pulling me in and then dropping me. Now I feel hurt, embarrassed, and mad at myself for ignoring my instincts.

[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frankenstein_(2025_film)?wprov=sfti1#) / [IMDb](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1312221/?ref_=ext_shr_lnk) / [Official Trailer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COrCzYXX3-8) / Saw it on Netflix

An American gothic drama film ***produced, written and directed*** by Guillermo del Toro, based on the 1818 novel by Mary Shelley. The film stars Oscar Isaac, Jacob Elordi, Mia Goth, and Christoph Waltz. The film follows the life of egotistical scientist Victor Frankenstein whose experiment in creating new life results in dangerous consequences when his monstrous creation comes to life.

On the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, ***85% of 316 critics' reviews are positive***. The website's consensus reads: ""Finding the humanity in one of cinema's most iconic monsters, Guillermo Del Toro's *Frankenstein* is a lavish epic that gets its most invigorating volts from Jacob Elordi's standout performance."" Metacritic, which uses a weighted average, assigned the film a score of ***77 out of 100***, based on 58 critics, indicating ""generally favorable"" reviews.

(In an unusual move, I lifted both those paragraphs from Wikipedia -more or less - unaltered… bold/italicized portions are mine for effect)

“It was too long, for sure, and Mia Goth’s costumes felt asymmetrical which I found confusing (why create such lavish things that don’t seem to match?) but overall - ***I enjoyed the movie, my MAP felt right***… it reminded me of *The Secret Garden*, somehow.”

Mrs. Lady Zedd, answering the ever-present post movie question: 

So - what’d you *think*? 

Well now - who am I to go against all that high praise? 85% Rotten Tomatoes, a 7.6 on IMDb, 3.9 on Letterboxd. Who got it right? If you answered all of us, you found the right answer. We followed the rules:

* We formed no opinion before we watched

* We walked into it “at 50”, and let the MAP float to wherever it goes

* We didn’t worry that we split (but we did discuss it after… hell, maybe I missed something, maybe MLZ did - it can happen)

* We simply *let the MAP be the MAP*

So… what happened? How do I account for that huge gap in our scores, while understanding mine comes in considerably lower than “the consensus view”… it feels like I have some explaining to do, even as I accept my right to *not* enjoy something is equal to my right *to* enjoy something.

First - let’s get Mrs. Lady Zedd’s “it reminded me of *The Secret Garden*” comment out in the open, because frankly, I initially found it confusing. I should also tell you, MLZ is prone to these sorts of freethinking pattern connections and she can’t always tell me what or how the feeling is triggered, just that it is. I’ll (gently) poke around the edges and see what clearing the *hmm, I don’t knows* reveals. In most cases, I’ll find the logic - today we hit pay dirt.

“It felt like the characters in both stories found their way into a secret garden of sorts, a place they shouldn’t be, yet - in it they are (for better or worse).”

Well now - that’s a slick bit of connecting unconnected things… she flipped me from “I have no idea what you’re talking about” to *gottcha - and well done you!* These are two very different gardens but thematically, both explore shared themes of outward appearances vs. inner reality, the consequences of isolation, and the healing power of love and acceptance.

**She nailed it.**

I don’t know why that makes me proud of her… she’s always been a beautiful, vibrant, and (most importantly) *intelligent* woman - but proud I am. The situation of *the obvious* not being obvious until pointed out - gives me chills. 

Of course - MAP’s finality is what we call “The Stamp” - there’s nowhere to run once you *stamp* that very specific number on a motion picture. “It is, what it is” as they say - and for me, Guillermo del Toro’s *Frankenstein* (in which he had near total creative control) slipped below the waterline of 50. Hyper-stylized, much of what I watched seemed to bend to **form** rather than **function**. 

Reworking a *well known** story is a [pickle](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_gRnvDRFYN4) unto itself - it’s the uphill battle remakes always face - the original story shrinks in the telling. The remake must **add** elements to make up for that [shrinkage](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GG2dF5PS0bI) - you really have to flip the pickle if you want the pay off to be huge.

How I wound up with a limp pickle…

Well - frankly - the pace and exaggerated run time were a left/right combination punch that knocked me right out of the “ring of paying attention”. It became a grueling slog that took off suddenly. The first 2/3 ran at a glacial pace, the last 1/3 was a running gallop with a sudden, positive end. If we personified *uneven*, it would be taking notes on how to be itself, *better*.

((Ouch))

Then there’s the need to *add* something new - I understand this bit certainly worked for many, making Victor Frankenstein the monster (rather, his ego), and making the monster into some emo-humanist superman ((shrug)) sure, I guess, nice twist but ((yikes)), I wasn’t buying it. Then we start getting in trouble with The Creature’s *amazing* ability to regenerate (then why retain the patchwork scars? Wouldn’t those *heal* too?) -or- his super-human strength (how can the muscles exceed that of the original man it came from?).

((Pop!))

Yup, my movie bubble popped and I started *thinking* rather than seeing… always bad when screening a movie.

It happens ((shrug)), I’m a del Toro fan but this one simply didn’t add up for me, personally. When I asked two very important questions, this is how MLZ answered:

Me: Would you purchase *Frankenstein* for the archive?

MLZ: Probably not ((ehhh)) it didn’t jump out for me in regard to *rewatching*. I would rewatch it but who knows when.

Me: Can you see this version of The Creature - emo but hyper aware of his feelings - in a early ‘60s coffee/nightclub, wearing a black turtleneck with matching beret, doing that adorable finger-snap-as-clapping bit after someone on stage finished the poem, **Ode to a Bug I Sat Upon**?

MLZ: ((nodding emphatically)) Yes, I surely could.

((Snap-Snap))

Movie on!

So, this was first time doing it completely on my own(I am a woman), usually it is with family members. I have still a few left to stack on the bottom right, but that is for tomorrow after my coffee.

My 6yo daughter helped me move(10 meters away) probably about 50 of the smaller ones, so it was a fun experience for her too. 

We finished in the fog at 9pm. I split some of the larger ones since my back was killing me already and I wanted to get it over with but i couldn’t push them up. Tomorrow will be a hard day, but I am happy.

1oy2jzy,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1oy2jzy/i_beat_the_shit_out_of_the_hatman/,I Beat The Shit Out of The Hatman,"My name is Jimmy, and I’m twenty-three. I wouldn't call myself a high-achiever, mostly. I'm just tired. I work at a bookstore that specializes exclusively in nautical fiction (yes, only nautical fiction), and I live in Port Hazzard. 

Now, before I tell y’all about what’s been bugging me, I’ll give you some more detail on the city. Port Hazzard is a place where strange things happen. Hell, the words “strange” and “eccentric” don’t do this city justice. Our official mascot is a seven-foot-tall pigeon named Bartholomew. The main street is flooded with three inches of perfectly clear, odorless maple syrup every Tuesday. The local weather station regularly issues warnings for “Intermittent Hailstorms” that only pelt people who are feeling ambivalent about their career choices. Those pellets hurt, man.

Now that you know the context, you’ll understand that when the sleep paralysis started, I was mostly just irritated.

“Oh, great,” I’d grumble internally, eyes wide open, staring at my bedroom ceiling. My body would be a solid block of lead. “Just what I needed. Like I don’t have enough stress wondering if the bookstore is finally going to replace the shelf that has a crab infestation.”

The recurring figure, the spectral visitor of my nocturnal prison, was an entity popularly known as the Hatman. He was exactly what his name implied: a towering, thin shadow, defined only by the outline of a broad-brimmed fedora and a trench coat that seemed to absorb all available light.

Most people described feeling pure, primal terror when the Hatman materialized. I, however, found him vaguely pathetic. He never did anything. He just stood there, leaning in a way that suggested either deep malice or an extremely bad back, and watched me.

“You know, if you’re supposed to be some kind of horror,” I thought one night, straining to wiggle my left big toe, “at least fix your posture. That slouch is going to kill you faster than the existential dread you’re failing to give me.”

After two weeks of the Hatman’s silent, judgmental presence, the initial novelty wore off. Sleep paralysis wasn't scary, it was just a massive inconvenience. I could barely move in the mornings and kept dropping stacks of Captain Ahab fan fiction at work. My boss, Jade, chewed me out after that. My patience, already thinner than the Hatman’s silhouette, snapped.

“Enough,” I muttered to my reflection one groggy Tuesday morning, noticing the dark circles under my eyes. “I’m taking this to the professionals.”

In Port Hazzard, “professionals” was a loose term. The only medical establishment I trusted (well, more like the only one I dared approach) was the private practice of Dr. Cole.

His clinic, located in a former lighthouse on the edge of the financial district, was named ‘The Lighthouse of Humors and Mild Ailments.’ The waiting room was furnished exclusively with oversized wicker furniture, and the background music was a loop of a man vigorously tuning a very out-of-tune harp. There were no other patients, thankfully.

After a twenty-minute wait, during which I seriously considered stealing a copy of *Moby Dick: The Early Years (Abridged)* from a nearby end table, a voice boomed, startling me upright.

“Ah, the young man with the strange familial genetics! Come in, come in. Quickly. Unlike the decaying passage of time, my schedule is very, very real.”

I walked into the office, craning my neck immediately. Dr. Cole was, to put it mildly, imposing. He was easily seven feet tall, with a mass of white hair and a bow tie that rotated slowly. From what I remember him telling me, it was powered by a tiny, brass mechanism. He wore a crisp white lab coat, but instead of trousers, he wore Bermuda shorts and hiking boots.

Dr. Cole didn’t use a desk. He perched on a repurposed lifeguard chair, looking down at me with eyes that seemed to have personally seen several different geological eras. The rest of the room was filled with model trains.

“Jimmy. The chart says… yes. Recent onset of nocturnal sensory deprivation with spectral accompaniment. The Hatman, yes?” Dr. Cole said, his voice a deep baritone that rattled the windowpanes.

“Yeah, that’s him. Just stands there, watching me. I need something to make him stop,” I explained, trying to sound professional while avoiding eye contact with the rotating bow tie.

Dr. Cole hummed, tilting his head. “Ah, the classic ‘Don’t like the spectral accompaniment’ dilemma. Well, we could try the standard, boring route: better sleep hygiene, reducing screen time, coming to terms with the fleeting nature of existence…” He paused dramatically, adjusting his brass-rimmed spectacles. “But that sounds dreadfully dull, doesn't it?”

“Dreadfully,” I agreed, relieved. I would rather die than reduce my screen time.

“Quite. No, for a Port Hazzard problem, we need a Port Hazzard solution. One must occasionally meet the chaos on its own terms.” Dr. Cole hopped down from the chair, a movement that felt like a localized seismic event, and rummaged through a metal cabinet labeled 'Slightly Illegal Pharmaceuticals.'

He pulled out a small, unlabeled pill bottle containing exactly two tablets of a deep, iridescent purple. They looked less like medicine and more like crystallized deep-sea plankton.

“Here we are,” Dr. Cole announced, handing the bottle over. “‘The Lucid Catalyst.’ Dosage: one tablet, twenty minutes before you plan on sleeping. It’s an experimental compound, you understand. A cocktail of synthetic nootropics, a splash of comet dust, and a pinch of wishful thinking.”

I stared at the pills. “Will this stop the paralysis?”

Dr. Cole’s massive face split into a wide, genuinely unsettling grin. “Stop it? Oh, no. It won’t stop the phenomenon, Jimmy. This city wouldn’t permit such a mundane resolution. This, my boy, simply nullifies the peripheral, inconvenient factors of the phenomenon. Specifically, the part that keeps you glued to the mattress.”

He winked. The bow tie spun faster.

“It gives me mobility during the paralysis? I can move?”

“You will be fully, physically present in your state of spectral encounter. You may find your motor skills a touch… rusty, at first. But it will still be functional. Now, get out of here. And remember, if you start seeing a mime arguing with a sentient traffic cone, that’s a side effect and you need to drink a gallon of whole milk.”

I left the clinic, the small bottle of purple pills clutched in my hand. Instead of fear, a slow, hot ember of resentment began to glow in my gut. The Hatman had been stealing my nights, ruining my precious few hours of rest. I was tired of being a passive participant.

That night, I decided that if the Hatman wasn’t going to stop visiting, he was at least going to pay a price for the inconvenience. I took one of the purple pills. It tasted like static electricity and old pennies.

Twenty minutes later, I fell asleep. A few hours after that, I was lying on my back. The familiar, suffocating pressure of sleep paralysis descended upon me. The room grew cold, the air thickened, and there he was: the Hatman. He was materializing near the foot of the bed, his dark presence like a hole punched into reality.

Immovable. Paralyzed. I confirmed the familiar feeling.

Then, I felt a faint, tingling sensation in my right hand. I focused, visualizing my fingers clenching. With a loud, audible creak from the bedsprings, my hand obeyed, clenching into a fist.

I was in sleep paralysis, but I could move.

The Hatman, having likely perfected his judging stance over several centuries, tilted his head slightly. If a shadow entity could look confused, this one did.

A vicious grin spread across my face. I leveraged my elbow and, with an awkward, lurching effort, managed to sit up in bed. I pointed a slightly shaky finger at the dark figure.

“Hey, asshole,” I growled, my voice thick with adrenaline and sleep deprivation. “You wanna take up my nights? You gotta fucking earn it.”

I swung my legs over the side of the bed and stood up. My movements felt heavy and slightly delayed, like walking underwater, but it was better than nothing.

The Hatman took a single, slow step back.

I lunged. It wasn’t graceful, but it covered the distance. I threw a wobbly right hook aimed right where a jaw would be. My fist connected. I knew it because my knuckles felt like they had just punched a block of solid ice wrapped in heavy velvet.

The Hatman didn’t fall, but he stumbled, the crisp line of his fedora blurring for a millisecond.

The fight that followed was less an epic battle of good versus evil and more two extremely tired individuals trying to throw cinder blocks at each other underwater. I, fueled by two weeks of poor sleep and the strange purple medicine, was wild and desperate. The Hatman, taken completely by surprise, fought back with silent, unnervingly cold strikes that felt like getting hit with a frozen fish.

It ended quickly. The Hatman wasn't a world-class brawler, but I was just an exhausted bookstore clerk. One powerful, silent spectral uppercut clipped me on the jaw, and I hit the floor. The pain, while dull, was immediate.

As I lay there, winded and thoroughly bruised, the Hatman paused. The asshole seemed to be contemplating his victory. Then, as quickly and silently as it had arrived, the shadow entity dissolved into the darkness.

I lay on the floor for a full minute, panting, staring at the empty space where a transcendent demon had just been. I hauled myself up, my ribs aching, my jaw throbbing, and my ego absolutely destroyed.

“Okay,” I groaned, rubbing a rapidly forming knot on my forehead. “He rocked my shit, but I moved at least.”

I didn't manage to get much sleep after that. My adrenaline had spiked and then collapsed, leaving me an achy, nauseous mess. Plus, every time I tried to close my eyes, I kept seeing the crisp outline of that damn hat.

The next morning, I looked like I had, indeed, lost a fight with a frozen fish. My left cheekbone was a spectacular shade of greenish-blue, and my lower lip was split. I called out of work at the nautical bookstore, claiming I had come down with a severe case of ""Sea Sickness of the Land"" (Jade bought it). Then, I immediately headed back to The Lighthouse of Humors and Mild Ailments.

The sound of the harp being tuned was louder this morning. The enormous wicker chairs seemed to sag in sympathy, or maybe pity. I didn't even sit down, I just stood there waiting.

Dr. Cole appeared immediately, gliding out from his office. He spotted me and his eyes immediately focused on my face.

“Jimmy! My boy!” he boomed, gesturing dramatically toward my facial topography. The tiny brass motor on his bow tie audibly whirred as it rotated in the clinic’s ambient light. “Goodness me. It seems you didn’t just meet chaos on its own terms; you tried to give it a robust hug. You look like you lost a staring contest with an approaching freight train.”

“It was more of a fistfight with a really cold coat rack, Doctor,” I mumbled, gingerly touching my swollen jaw. “Look, the meds worked, technically. I could move. I could fight. But I lost, and I got zero minutes of actual sleep. I’m starting to think my sleep is more important than ‘meeting chaos on its own terms.’”

I tossed the bottle, which now contained only one remaining purple pill, onto his giant lifeguard chair. “I don't want to fight the Hatman, Dr. Cole. I want to sleep. Do you have anything? Anything at all. A boring, mundane, completely non-eccentric pill that will just knock me out for eight hours?”

Dr. Cole sighed, a sound like air escaping a very large balloon. He picked up the bottle and examined the last iridescent pill with professional melancholy.

“Ah, the sweet allure of the mundane,” he murmured wistfully. “A sound goal, Jimmy. A perfectly reasonable request for a completely unremarkable, non-haunted city.”

He straightened up, his towering figure filling the space. “But I am afraid that I must deny you. We are experiencing a rather profound, city-wide shortage of all effective soporifics and sedatives.”

I blinked, waiting for the punchline. “A shortage? Like, a supply chain issue?”

“Worse, my friend. Far worse. It’s a Port Hazzard issue,” Dr. Cole said gravely. “You see, the last shipment of our standard-issue sleeping pill, the remarkably effective ‘Snooze-U-Lose 5000,’ was intercepted just outside city limits by the infamous Band of Sentient Plastic Lawn Flamingos.”

I“The ones who keep stealing garden hoses?”

“The very same! They believed, quite incorrectly, that the molecular structure of the Snooze-U-Lose 5000 was the key to unlocking the secret of eternal lawn-care perfection. They stole the entire stock. And since the second-most popular option, ‘Mild-Ease Dreamers,’ was recently recalled because it was discovered to cause users to spontaneously combust, we are left…as you young ones say, high and dry.”

He spread his enormous hands in a gesture of helpless resignation. “Until the flamingos are subdued, or until the city’s distributor finds an alternate supply that hasn’t been transmogrified by the residual runoff from last week’s Fog Event, all I have left for you is the Lucid Catalyst.”

My shoulders slumped. This was classic Port Hazzard bureaucracy mixed with cosmic absurdity. I couldn’t even be mad, it was just how things worked here. No reliable sleep aid exists because magical garden pests stole it.

“So I’m stuck with the fight-inducing purple vitamins,” I said flatly.

Dr. Cole beamed. “You are stuck with the potential for glorious, mobile participation in your own nightmare, Jimmy! Think of it as a test. You have one pill left. Use it wisely. Or, perhaps, foolishly. Foolishness often leads to the most compelling tales.”

I took the bottle. The last pill felt heavy inside. I thanked him, walked back into the daylight, and immediately saw a mime arguing with a traffic cone about the definition of ‘Yield.’ I wrote a mental note to grab some milk on the way home.

Unfortunately, the reality was crushing. I needed sleep, and the only way to get a restful night now was to somehow beat the Hatman into submission so thoroughly that he decided my apartment was no longer worth the hassle. I couldn't do it alone. The time for professionalism was over. The time for family was now.

I pulled out my phone and dialed the one person I knew who would love the idea of inflicting violence on a silent shadow man.

“Frank,” I said when he picked up. “It’s Jimmy. I need you to drive to Port Hazzard. And bring the bat.”

The phone line crackled. Frank’s voice, a gravelly sound that usually preceded the lifting of something extremely heavy, answered.

“Jimmy. What is it? I’m busy.”

Frank was never *not* busy. He was perpetually occupied with tasks like replacing the engine of a decommissioned tank, or perhaps wrestling a particularly stubborn gorilla. He was the complete opposite of me. Where I was a pale, anxious clerk, Frank was built like a brick shithouse, made for aggression. He was eight years older, and his idea of casual attire was a ripped denim vest and tactical boots.

“I’m not well, Frank. I’m covered in bruises. I need your help,” I said, wincing as I spoke.

“Bruises? What happened, did Bartholomew finally corner you?” he asked, referring to the city’s giant pigeon mascot.

“Worse. It’s the Hatman. Sleep paralysis. Except I can move now, thanks to some weird doctor. I tried to fight him last night. I lost. Badly. I need backup, and I need you to take one of these purple pills with me tonight.”

There was a long silence from him. I could hear a sound like heavy steel chains rattling, followed by what might have been a small, muffled explosion.

“A shadow demon that wears a hat,” Frank repeated, slowly, the way a lion might contemplate a particularly juicy gazelle. “You’re telling me there is a literal, tangible creature that exists purely to be intimidating, and you can physically interact with it, and it fights back?”

“Yes. He’s tough, Frank. He’s cold, and silent, and he uses spectral uppercuts.”

“Spectral uppercuts,” Frank scoffed. There was a sound of something large dropping. “He’s in for a treat, then. Where are you? What time?”

This was the beautiful part. This was why I called Frank. Frank didn’t question the cosmic or the eccentric. He was just in the fight for the love of the game.

“Midnight, my apartment. And Frank, I only have one pill left. We have to split it. Are you… are you sure you’re up for this? It’s going to hurt.”

“Hurt?” Frank let out a rattling, phlegmy laugh that sounded like ball bearings in a dryer. “Oh, Jimmy, you forgot my superpower. You’ve been so wrapped up in nautical fiction you forgot the family lore.”

“The lore that you used to bench press refrigerators?”

“No, you idiot. The good one. The medical one.” Frank’s voice dropped to a conspiratorial, yet loud, whisper. “I have Congenital Insensitivity to Pain, remember? I could get hit by a truck full of rabid badgers and I wouldn't feel a thing. This is literally the perfect opponent for me. Plus…”

Frank paused for dramatic effect, and I knew what was coming.

“Plus,” he continued, his voice rising, “I’ve been trying a new supplement stack. I’m currently operating at about sixty percent pure, unfiltered Roid Rage. That motherfucker's silent brooding is about to get a very loud, very angry wakeup call.”

My chest swelled with relieved pride. This was better than any sleep aid.

“Perfect, Frank. Just perfect. I’ll see you around eleven. And seriously, don’t forget the bat. Maybe bring something else, too. We need maximum impact.”

“The bat is in the truck. I also have a tire iron and maybe some brass knuckles. See you soon, nautical nerd.”

He hung up before I could object to the 'nautical nerd' comment. Whatever.

Frank would bring his aluminum bat, a relic from his brief, fiery career as a semi-pro softball player before he got banned for beating up the opposing team. I needed something equally blunt and effective. Something that represented my own unique blend of domestic exhaustion.

I walked into the kitchen and grabbed my weapon: the heavy, slightly battered, cast-iron frying pan. It was perfectly weighted and still had a faint scent of the scrambled eggs I’d ruined this morning. Perfect.

By 11:30 PM, Frank’s truck, a lifted, mud-splattered monstrosity that looked like it ate smaller vehicles for breakfast, came barreling down my street. Frank emerged, a giant shadow himself, far thicker and more solid than the Hatman could ever dream of being. He was wearing a faded DOOM t-shirt and jeans, and was gripping the aluminum bat so hard that it almost crushed it.

“Alright, squirt,” Frank grunted, kicking my apartment door shut behind him. “Walk me through the plan. Where does this trench-coat wearing freak materialize?”

“By the bed,” I said, holding up the frying pan. “We take the pill, we wait for the paralysis to set in, and then we just beat the absolute shit out of him until he decides to haunt the guy who manages the maple syrup reserves instead.”

Frank grinned, a wide, challenging expression that somehow managed to be both terrifying and reassuring. “Sounds like the best night I’ve had in months.”

I carefully split the last purple pill down the middle with a kitchen knife, and handed Frank his half.

“This will be weird, Frank. You're going to feel stuck, but then you can move. It’s a very heavy feeling,” 

Frank tossed the purple sliver into his mouth and swallowed it with a gulp of water. “I spent an hour in a sensory deprivation tank last year just to see if I could make myself feel claustrophobic. Bring on the weird.”

We lay on my bed with the lights shut off. Frank held his bat resting on his shoulder like an executioner. I gripped the frying pan, the grease smell comforting in its familiarity. The clock on the wall ticked past midnight.

I felt the pressure descend first, that leaden, familiar weight. My limbs locked down. I was floating in the cold, thick air of pure inability.

Then, the Hatman arrived. He was in his usual spot, tall, dark, and utterly motionless.

Frank was next. I heard the sudden, sharp intake of his breath as the paralysis hit him. But a moment later, I heard something else. A low, menacing rumble came from Frank's chest.

I pushed myself up, the pill’s power kicking in, turning the paralysis into slow, grinding mobility. I saw Frank also sit up. His eyes were focused entirely on the Hatman, and an animalistic energy was starting to leak from him. The Roid Rage was cooking.

I gripped the frying pan. The Hatman was in for a treat.

“Hey, Hatman!” I yelled, my voice still thick but steady. “I brought my brother! He’s pissed off, he’s got a bat, and you know what? He can’t feel pain!”

The Hatman recoiled and physically stumbled back two full paces, the shadowy fedora outline wobbling. I swear, the little bitch looked afraid. This was going to be cathartic.

Frank let out a roar, less a human scream and more the sound of a grizzly bear discovering its salmon dinner has been replaced by tofu. He launched himself off the bed.

The battle of the astral plane was on.

The Hatman, clearly an experienced fighter against panicked, immobile victims, was surprisingly agile. He dodged Frank’s massive, sweeping bat swing, which left a deep, echoing thud in the air. The entity retaliated with a rapid series of spectral body blows aimed at Frank's chest.

The blows hit Frank, and they looked brutal, like being repeatedly struck by a pneumatic hammer. Frank didn’t even flinch. He just laughed, a manic, pain-free sound, and swung the bat again. This time, it connected with the Hatman’s leg. The entity shrieked, a sound like grinding sandpaper, and dissolved momentarily before reforming a few feet away.

“Jimmy! Get him!” Frank bellowed. He was walking forward, winding up for another, even heavier swing.

I charged from the side, lifting the cast-iron frying pan high over my head. I aimed for the hat. The strike landed with a metallic *clonk*. The Hatman crumpled, falling to his knees.

The creature was designed to be terrifying in its stillness, its silent judgment. Especially since its victims couldn’t normally move. Now, on the floor, it was just a shadow-man getting beaten by two brothers, one of whom was a medical marvel and the other armed with cookware.

Frank didn't hesitate. He brought the aluminum bat down in a sickening, repeated rhythm. *Thwack. Thwack. Thwack.*

“Where’s your menace, huh?” Frank yelled, his voice ragged with sheer delight. “Where’s the existential dread? All I’m feeling right now is awesome!”

The Hatman tried to push himself up, his spectral form flickering, desperately trying to regain the dignity of its silhouette. I knelt down next to Frank, gripping my pan.

“You stole two weeks of my sleep, you trench-coat wearing freak!” I screamed, swinging the frying pan sideways and connecting squarely with the Hatman’s midsection.

The entity let out another horrible sound, somewhere between a hiss and a whistle, and its outline shrank slightly, as if it was being compressed by sheer, violent force.

We kept at it. Frank used the bat to methodically crush the Hatman’s limbs, one by one, while I provided the chaotic, noisy distraction with the frying pan. It was pure, frantic catharsis.

After what felt like an hour, but was probably only three minutes, the Hatman was reduced to a twitching, flattened blob of black shadow on my wooden floor.

Frank, breathing heavily, stood over it, gripping the bat. He was untouched, save for a massive dent in the handle of the bat, which hadn't been there before.

“Look at him,” Frank spat, nudging the shadow mass with the toe of his combat boot. “The big scary Hatman. Get up! Fight back! I still can’t feel anything! Hit me harder!”

I lowered the frying pan, watching the black mass pulse faintly. “I think he’s done, Frank. I think we showed him that my apartment isn't a good place to annoy people.”

Frank finally lowered the bat, the rage receding just enough for a grin to return. “Yeah. This was a much better prescription than the regular pills the flamingos stole. Let me know if you want to fight them too.”

We stood there, two brothers armed with housing appliances and sporting goods, victorious over a spectral entity. The victory was glorious. The sense of accomplishment was immense. The silence in the room was finally back to normal.

Then, the first pale light of dawn crept through the window. The sleep paralysis, the effect of the meds, and the Hatman’s presence all lifted simultaneously.

The shadow mass vanished. The air returned to normal temperature. Frank and I were left standing in the middle of my bedroom, panting, one of us still wired on adrenaline and supplements, the other completely spent.

I stumbled over to the clock. 6:00 AM.

My elation crashed into the cold reality of my responsibilities.

“Oh, God, Frank,” I groaned, running a hand through my messy hair. I looked at my brother, who was starting to do a celebratory push-up on one hand. “I didn’t sleep, and I have to be at work in two hours.”

Frank got back on his feet. “Yeah, yeah, you’re a real tragedy, Jimmy. Look, man, go make some coffee or something before you collapse. I’ll get out of your hair.” 

He clapped me once on the shoulder, firm enough to nearly topple me, then headed for the door. “Text me if that son of a bitch comes back,” he added casually, as if that were a normal sibling request. Then he left.

I dragged myself to the kitchen on legs made of wet sand. The apartment was dim and still. I opened the cupboard, expecting salvation in the form of bitter, scalding caffeine, but all I found was an empty container lying on its side. Two weeks of sleep paralysis and insomnia had drained the last of it without me noticing.

I stared at the barren shelf for a long moment, then let out a tired, humorless breath. 

“Of course,” I muttered. “Just my fucking luck.”",4,1763239851.0,nosleep,0,1.0,False

Dear Agent,

I am seeking representation for HOW YOU HEAR ME, my 93k word romance novel with a speculative twist. For fans of Ashley Poston’s *Sounds Like Love*, with the sweet college romance of Christina Lauren’s *Tangled Up in You*, HOW YOU HEAR ME is a slow-burn love story written in dual POV with a dose of millennial nostalgia. 

Adria Holzen is still recovering from last semester’s downward spiral. After a mental health crisis left her with a plummeting GPA and zero self-esteem, she still can’t let go of her dream of becoming a teacher. But if she’s going to make it into her university’s esteemed teaching program, she’s got to show she can work well with others– even the ones who watched her crumble the semester before. 

Rowan Briggs has been able to hear people’s thoughts since he was young, a secret he’s mostly kept to himself. Growing up watching his mother use her ability as a weapon, he sees it more as a curse than a gift. So Rowan goes about college like he does anything else– by suppressing his ability and keeping everyone at arm’s length. 

When Adria and Rowan are assigned to work together on a semester-long project, neither one of them are thrilled. But when Rowan saves Adria from panicking at their first presentation, his stoic exterior begins to crack. However, Rowan’s soft spot for Adria scares him. After watching his own parent’s relationship crumble because of the ability he’s inherited, he vowed to never grow close to anyone. And when Adria witnesses Rowan come to the rescue of a stranger silently in peril she realizes something is vastly different about him. The closer she gets to discovering his secret, the more Rowan distances himself– lying about his feelings and closing everyone off just as Adria needs someone the most. As the semester ends, Adria and Rowan must decide if having someone know the real version of themselves is worth compromising the facades they’ve depended on for so long. 

Like my protagonist, I attended university to become a teacher. I received a bachelor’s in English/Language Arts from \[University\] Today I live in \[State\] with my husband and our four children. When I’m not writing, I enjoy reading, baking, and drinking far too much iced coffee. Thank you for your time and consideration. 

First 300:

The computer lab was hidden at the end of the hall under the stairway– a small and mercifully windowless room. Adria perched herself at the edge of a chair and typed in her password. As she waited, she moved a hand over the blotchy, scathing heat crawling up her neck. 

The home screen appeared. She felt around her pockets until she was able to locate the half crumpled schedule that had hung on her cork board since July, too early, it turned out, to be depended on. She snatched a stray pen from the next desk over, and scribbled the room number on the back of the paper. 

Of all the things that should have bothered Adria at that moment, arriving at the wrong classroom shouldn’t have even made the list. And if there had been a list to begin with, none of it should have sent her heart racing. But there it was– the feeling of her resolve slowly slipping away. 

By the time Adria left the lab, she had less than a minute. In front of her, the last few people in the hall retreated into classrooms. She checked the paper again, trying not to think of how many problems would disappear if she just got in her car and left. She’d be home in less than three hours. Her parents could redeposit thousands of dollars into their savings account and it would soften the blow of their oldest daughter giving up her dream of being a teacher. It wouldn’t matter that she was late, or that she already had too much homework. And she could stop worrying every time she recognized someone who was there during exams.

1oy2dfh,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1oy2dfh,Why we built BeanBook?,"This photo tells the story itself — An place that could **hold my entire coffee journey** in a beautiful & meaningful way.

Since got into specialty coffee, We had dozens of bags, notes, recipes and screenshots scattered no place actually feel our coffee story been captured in a right way, So we built [BeanBook.app](http://beanbook.app/) to fix that. ([Apple App Store download](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/coffee-tracker-beanbook/id6499280064))

What mattered to us from day one:

* **Designed for coffee people** — coffee isn’t just chemistry or physics; it’s human. So the data shouldn’t feel cold or technical. It should be joyful.
* **Effortless logging** — Just snap a photo, No need to type, AI fills in everything.

Thanks to the 250 testers who tried the beta last year — your feedback showed us how much more we could build once we connect the dots.

Where BeanBook is now:

* **Coffee Tracker:** Snap a bag → auto-fill origin, roast date, process, tasting notes, roaster info & more.
* **Roast date tracker** | **Grinder size tracker** | **Flavor tracker** | **Rating** & **Notes**.
* **Search, Sort &** **Organize** beans in list, card, or flavor views.
* Auto-generated, detailed **coffee stats** from every angle.
* **Create or explore brew recipes** from YouTube, URLs, screenshots → get clean, editable steps.
* This is all just the foundation. There’s a lot more coming.

Now, the honest part — We get that’s controversial for a subscription-based coffee app, Here’s how we think about it:

* **Free plan:** almost everything included, just limited bean slots – 4 slots + 2 new slots every month**, Pro plan:** unlimited
* **Yearly:** $49.9 ($4.15/month, 1-month free trial, Prices adjust by country.)
* **Monthly:** $7.9 (no trial) Monthly is intentionally higher to encourage yearly option, which is the cost of one cup of coffee a month. 
* Built an app that people willing to pay means a real **product-market fit**(PMF), — **means the idea & execution create true value to users**.The income helps us cover the ongoing costs and keep it for **a long run**, We are not in it for the short term profit.
* Every time we add new paid features, **we push some older paid features into the free plan.**This forces us to keep innovating and it keeps the free plan strong, and **this mechanism benefits all**.
* Our vision is to make BeanBook **a lasting free app and genuinely useful for most coffee lovers**, like AllTrails for coffee, but also with a small paid tier want to go deeper.
* We'll run promotions throughout the year to see what the right pricing level is. Black Friday is now running with **40% off** — the best offer of the year!

We’d love to hear any feedback. Thoughts on anything — features, pricing, ideas — we’re listening.

Complete the game first. ok?

Hello. this is a mod but there is none links right now because I'm only on the ""idea stage"" .

Today I would like to present an idea for my mod called Slime Rancher 2: Seven Seas! I only recently got excited about the idea of making this mod. The essence of it is that after completing the main storyline, Gigi will unlock a boat for you, which you can use to travel around the island cluster of Rainbow Island! (And yeah, I know this sounds like a cheap Temu Ocean Range ripoff, which is not true, like, I respect them, they did a good job, I think).

After Gigi unlocks the boat, a steering wheel will pop up from under the floor (I'll figure out how to do that later). You can walk up to it, press the interaction button, and a bigger map of Rainbow Island will open up, where you can pick your destination. At the moment, I only have one concept for one island, and it's called:

# Highlands!

(My first art, by the way. hope it doesn't look awful.)

[1 - what inspired me for the icon. 2 - my dumass can't replicate the artstyle so I needed an example.](https://preview.redd.it/n1ybroedbh1g1.png?width=1024&format=png&auto=webp&s=4eee74839229c3d0f2b2f9261d4ac8c30e899f39)

Highlands - is a fairly large island with mountainous terrain that has been severely damaged by prismatic energy, causing some of its pieces to float in the air near or even in the clouds. Strangely enough, you can find a packed teleporter, a portable port market, a cup of hot coffee and even bridges that are good as new? You will be able to meet three new slimes there. I already know what kind of slimes they will be, but purely for the sake of intrigue, I won't tell you who they are, and also because I haven't made the art yet.( I'm gonna learn to draw I promise!!!)

When I have more ideas, I will update the post.

And now for the most painful part: implementation...

I understand that this sounds like a very huge and impossible idea for one person, and I'm not saying that I will release everything at once.

But I will try for the sake of the community.

I know how to make mid-level models, I'm not very good at drawing yet, but I will actively develop my skills, I have a phenomenal education in music (and I'm also very modest ))) ), but the most difficult part is implementation. I'm completely clueless when it comes to programming, so if it's not too difficult for you, please help me figure it out. I am ready to completely lose my physical and mental health for this. ( that's a joke, although maybe it's not a joke?) to implement this idea in the form of a mod.

As for the release of versions, I will release them in stages: the first is highlands, there will also be a second and third, but I can't say for sure yet, because on the day I created this post, I had a terrible headache. because I live in GMT +3 and that's almost 1:00!

so, bye! hope you like this idea!

\*sigh\*  I remembered a great quote:

Do you think there’s enough demand for specialty coffee in Mississauga?  also planning to carry different single origin / blend from various popular brands (DAK, Hatch, September, etc.) so people can actually have a local spot to pickup these brands that are usually just sold online. Toronto has a lot of shops with this format, but it’s non existent in mississauga. Back Road coffee seems to be the only one in the city in this category but they only sell and roast for their own brand. 

Edit: for location, aiming for around or proximal to streetsville, port credit. Would be great but can be expensive to get a space. Also highly considering ‘suburby’ spots. Meadowvale/ confederation for example. Not a lot of foot traffic ofcourse but been noticing people will drive to get coffee if its a good spot lol",16,1763239115.0,mississauga,24,0.9,False
1oy28w0,https://www.reddit.com/r/headphones/comments/1oy28w0/best_setup_to_learn_about_headphones/,Best Setup to Learn about Headphones,"**The TL;DR**: If you had to start over from scratch to learn about HiFi headphones without access to a listening room, how would you do it? I'm leaning towards the Arya Stealth and the JDS Element IV.  
  
**The Details**: I have been learning about HiFi audio in recent years, and given that I'm presently a renter, I thought it would be beneficial to point my attentions towards headphones instead of speakers. It makes me wonder if there is an ideal way to learn about one's ears, head, and tastes without access to a listening room. With speakers, I can calculate values for the driver, the room gain, etc., but headphones seem to be more intimate and subjective. If you had to start over, had limited budget, and legitimately wanted to learn about headphones, what would be your plan? Alternatively, please poke holes in my current plan below.

**Current Plan**:  
\- Identify subjective community verbiage used to describe certain frequency bands and driver characteristics (""tambor"", ""detail"", etc.)  
\- Categorize driver types relative to the above verbiage and determine their optimal and suboptimal application.  
\- Compare subjective community consensus with objective measurements to determine a mean experience.  
\- Compare my experience using shared community verbiage with the mean experience to isolate the variables within my biology and personal tastes  
\- Test my findings via EQ to determine if I'm in the ball park.

**My Assumptions**: Without infinite budget I have to start with one of the three common, sub-$1000 headphones, and I think open-back planar magnetics fit my most common use case -- large percentage of listening time devoted to movies, games, and lectures. No current desire for powerful, thumping bass, but an understanding that access to the full spectrum is valuable for educational purposes. I landed on the Arya Stealth as a canvas for testing with the JDS Element IV.

**Questions**:   
\- When A/B testing, is there any meaningful difference between introducing preferential tuning to a ""neutral"" headphone vs. removing coloration to achieve ""neutrality"" via EQ? Take the Meze 105 Silva vs. Sennheiser HD600. The Silva is known for being ""shouty"" around the 4kHz mark, while the HD600 is known for being fairly ""neutral."" Ignoring price, is there a meaningful difference between making the Silva less ""shouty"" vs. making the HD600 more ""shouty?""  
\- What blind spots did you have early-on that proved to be a limiting factor in your access to the hobby and listening experience?  
\- Is it a mistake to prioritize education over joy? I've spent a significant amount of time refining my sense of taste, which ruined my ability to consume certain things (like crap coffee). Am I setting myself up for increased disappointment by aiming to potentially over-refine my sense of hearing?

Six dollars for an assortment of donut holes and I swear I could’ve found better at Safeway or Walmart

I laughed out loud “this a joke?”

With a name everyone recognizes and the aesthetic and marketing and money they make over local shops these donuts should be kicking ass!? 

So after looking on Reddit chucks was just a 2 minute walk away

Reposting because my last was removed for a low effort title. Hope this is better. Also please know I KNOW how dumb this is, like if you saw the email chain you’d know from the get go it was a scam. I am young, I was nervous and hyped up on coffee, and this is a new job. This is mostly me ranting, I’m hoping this will one day be something I can just look back on and laugh about or at the very least cringe about whenever I remember it.

I don’t know where else to really talk about this. This happened yesterday and luckily I had a therapy meeting the same day so I did get to talk about it more thoroughly. I just got a new job 3 days ago, and it’s my first job that has to do with my career path I went to school for so you can imagine how nervous I’ve been. I’ll just cut right to it. My boss happened to be out of the office when I get an email from someone using his name and claiming to be him. I missed this email by an hour so I was scrambling to reply back, never even checked what email the account was linked to. This was through my work email so I thought nothing of it. My boss asks if I have free time in the email, so I went up to his office just to find he wasn’t there. I thought that meant I had missed a time he wanted to meet with me so I felt awful.

Eventually he asks me if I can do a favor for him while he’s out. Says he’s got a surprise for some of the staff planned and he wanted my help with it. I need it to be so clear that I watch scam videos ALL the time, I know their tells, but it all just seemed to slip right out the window with this one.

Long story short, the scammer guesses correctly that there is a company card and knows our receptionist’s name. I tell the receptionist that my boss emailed me to run an errand for him, they give me the card, and I go to the store and get all the way to check out, buy 4 $200 gift cards ($800 total of my boss’s money ☠️), and it isn’t until the scammer starts asking for pictures that I realize it’s wrong and that it’s too late.

I was frantic for the rest of the day. Of course, I told my boss and gave him all the gift cards. We was very understanding, way more than he should’ve been in my opinion, and forgave me. Didn’t even fire me. He seemed more upset at the receptionist for not questioning what I was doing.

Now I feel like I’m in a bit of a pickle. It was my third day and I’ve already done something so ridiculous and embarrassing, I have no doubt the receptionist is not happy with me and probably feels embarrassed too. I just felt the need to rant about this. I really like this company already, but my god I’m not sure I’ll ever be able to look at my boss and forget what I did.

Edit: The only positive I can say about this is I did realize that asking for pictures was sketchy and I didn’t send any. That is my only saving grace. My boss now has 4 $200 gift cards that at least still have value on them ☠️.",10,1763239031.0,Scams,31,0.69,False

And who will connect me to the world?

Cogs turning ‘round-

I don’t know who I am.

You give me hugs and a home.

Yet I’m growing dissatisfied-

Black is eroding the white.

And I’m alone at the top.

What would you think?

I only want your comfort-

But I’m an emotionless husk.

You’d think I’m evil and cruel,

If you ever knew the truth-

Because society’s drummed in that thought.

Making Disney illusions for you.

# Colourblind:

I go through life like a dream-

Emotionally colourblind unlike you.

Learning to read people like a book-

That’s really all I can do.

Our love is golden

Until it’s lost-

The facade melts and the charm rots,

The good guy is gone.

My eyes are gleaming-

Control is fleeting.

Gotta fill my empty space.

..............................................

Not bad, not good-

Just have different eyes to you.

I’m cold, you’re warm-

We’ll put each other out soon.

You try to bring me back alive- 

But baby, I’m dead inside.

I’ve got a different mind-

I’m colourblind.

.........................................................................................

I don’t want to hurt you-

Lily, you’ve always walked with me.

Your dark hazel eyes break stone and ice-

If I can’t love you, I can’t feel at all.

Do you see my psychopathy,

And think I’m rottenly sweet?

I keep trying to be someone worth loving-

Cold and sweet like iced tea.

............................................................................

Not bad, not good-

Just have different eyes to you.

I’m cold, you’re warm-

We’ll put each other out soon.

You try to bring me back alive- 

But baby, I’m dead inside.

I’ve got a different mind-

I’m colourblind.

.....................................................................................

I wouldn’t miss you

If you left me for a guy-

That’s the worst part of it all.

I don’t attach, I disengage-

This is the closest I feel to remorse.

Different mind,

I’m colourblind.

Different mind,

Colourblind, colourblind.

......................................................................................................

Not bad, not good-

Just have different eyes to you.

I’m cold, you’re warm-

# Man Like Me:

Got so many people, yet I feel so alone.

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

I see Dominic and I feel light in the head.

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

I’m still with Lily but I just can’t help myself.

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

I know it’ll break her but I’m struggling to care.

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

.............................................................................

I know I don’t have a heart.

I know that this isn’t smart.

I know this will destroy our world.

But I’m throwing caution to the wind.

............................................................................................

I’m dead inside-

Sorry you’re with a man like me.

Man like me.

I’m starting to think

Something’s wrong with me.

Do I want to do this?

........................................................................................................

Your dark chocolate eyes are full of bitter hope-

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

And I’m starting to break down from it.

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

You’re a good person and you saved me from my dad.

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

The ultimate betrayal is turning love into hate.

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

...................................................................................

And I have to tell you what I did.

I can’t let it burn in my internal abyss.

But it won’t hurt you more than I just did.

I’m too far gone, but Lily, you aren’t.

..............................................................................................

I’m dead inside-

Sorry you’re with a man like me.

Man like me.

I’m starting to think

Something’s wrong with me.

Do I want to do this?

.......................................................................................

I sit you down with a cup of tea.

Time to come out and say I’m gay.

You know full well our love must end.

But you want to be friends ‘till the end.

I’m sorry you were ever with this man.

I don’t believe in hell, but I’ll be damned.

I never thought you’d be friends with me.

Lily, you were always something else.

..........................................................................................

I’m dead inside-

Sorry you’re with a man like me.

Man like me.

I’m starting to think

Something’s wrong with me.

Do I want to do this?

.................................................................................................

Making lemonade-

Sorry you were with a man like me.

Man like me.

Now I’m with Dominic,

At least I’ll treat him right-

I want to try.

# Close To Love:

Oh, I’ll set me free tonight.

Oh, I’ll treat a man right.

Oh, will you give me a chance-

I’ll show you something

Close to love.

............................................................................................

I’ve been sleeping with my man.

When things are old

They’re never bad.

Now I know what to do.

I delight in being exotic.

The only gay lovers around here.

Hey, Dominic-

You make a real woman out of me.

......................................................................................................

I have broken many hearts.

Entered new waters and left blood.

I’m going to hell

For being such a villain.

But you, dear, give me hope

That in darkness, there is light.

To treat you well,

I’ll try with all my might.

.................................................................

Oh, I’ll set me free tonight.

Oh, I’ll treat a man right.

Oh, will you give me a chance-

I’ll show you something

Close to love.

......................................................................................................

I have run away from home.

I can breathe and strip men to the bone.

Never thought I’d finally be happy.

He helped me bite through the bile.

So I could make this worthwhile.

Take me to your bedroom, Dominic.

...................................................................................................

Oh, I’ll set me free tonight.

Oh, I’ll treat a man right.

Oh, will you give me a chance-

I’ll show you something

Close to love.

I will give you

Something close to love.

......................................................................................

Take a chance and ride.

Ride me, cowboy.

Close to love.

Yes, yes, yes.

# Pointless Loving You:

Pointless loving you.

.........................................

I’ve spent my thoughts on you.

I live a continent apart from you.

And this is what you do?

I’ve stopped chewing the past-

I gave everything I had to love you.

And you leave me in the land of ghosts?

..................................................................

Leave me in the land of ghosts-

Pointless loving you.

Leave me in the land of ghosts.

I thought you’d save me from myself.

Land of ghosts.

........................................................................................

You put Alexis before me.

You tie me to a cross to die.

I thought you’d save me from sin.

I can’t help it when I give in.

I’m a ghost and you strip me of body,

And send me back to my empty space.

................................................................................

Leave me in the land of ghosts.

It’s my fault, I killed you.

Leave me in the land of ghosts.

It’s your fault, your infidelity.

Leave me in the land of ghosts-

Always fighting the black hole

Before it eats me.

Land of ghosts.

I want you.

Land of ghosts.

Land of ghosts.

# Land Of Ghosts:

I’m growing tired

But I’m always hungry.

I’m a liar

But also a truth-seeker.

So many who love me,

But I’m forever deaf to their calls.

I can live with it,

But I’ll die without it too.

.............................................................................

Oh, woah, la, la, la.

Leave the land of ghosts.

I can see, what I need to be,

Even if it’s foreign to me.

But I want to try

And leave the land of ghosts.

Oh, woah, la, la, la.

..........................................................................

It’s tricky,

But I’m the trickster.

Learn to give

But I am the giver.

I made many mistakes-

Three people I’ve let down.

High are the stakes,

But I’ll never let you drown.

........................................................................

I don’t care (set me free)

What Dominic says (set me free).

I can make it someday-

I’ve got the tools,

To leave the land of ghosts.

...................................................................................................

Oh, woah, la, la, la.

Leave the land of ghosts.

I can see, what I need to be,

Even if it’s foreign to me.

But I want to try

And leave the land of ghosts.

Oh, woah, la, la, la.

Oh, woah, la, la, ooh,

I can see-

And leave the land of ghosts.

# Made In Hell:

Talked about Russian literature

To try and win me over.

I need to take control.

Playing with fire-

I’m a butterfly collector.

We’ll build a glass asylum

And put each other in there.

You’re hanging on my wall.

But I made a mistake again-

I’ll have my head caved in.

Rahma, I’ve got to settle my score-

You can’t keep your paws to yourself.

You’ve gone and hurt me.

You’ve gone and hurt my friend.

I want something to save me.

Make it a godsend.

I have to get over you.

Made in hell.

With a human need for company.

I can do something better

And spread my devil wings.

# Golden Love:

Never thought I’d be looking back

After you left me tied to a track.

You’re Lady Macbeth 

And I’m something more.

You picked the wrong person to fight-

I’m cold to the core.

Three months passed, it’s all good today-

I’m in control of my life again.

You’re not happy that you’re not mine,

Since I left you for someone with a spine.

I never believed in alchemy.

Golden love is an illusion from you-

Lies are painted to look like love.

....................................................................................................

Goodbye golden love.

If only you hadn’t been such a bore.

Goodbye golden love,

Our love could’ve lasted forevermore.

...........................................................................................

I’m one in a million, babe-

Our love was fine

But I still broke the chains.

Desperate to control me,

But I got there before-

Won my life back like a gladiator.

People bet their cash on us,

But we only lasted for three months.

All because of your twisted mind-

Our golden love turns to rust.

You left me with stitches,

In my robot heart.

And I get shouted for being the man-

Women can be oh, so sly.

.........................................................................................

Goodbye golden love.

If only you hadn’t been such a bore.

Goodbye golden love,

Our love could’ve lasted forevermore.

...........................................................................

I’m trying to love, but it’s bloody hard,

When my world isn’t colour-

It’s black and white.

But I got in bed with Edward Hyde-

She left wounds on my ice-cold chest.

..................................................................................

Goodbye golden love.

If only you hadn’t been such a bore.

Goodbye golden love,

Our love could’ve lasted forevermore.

Goodbye golden love-

It was copper anyway.

# Love Is An Action:

Emma and Abbie-

Angels from therapy-

Sawed through the ice

To find a good heart.

For love is an action  
To bring good to our lives.

Lucy deserves my love and time.

In every person’s life,

Sacrifices must be made to give life.

Giving up the pleasure of darkness-

I want to bathe in trust and honesty.

# Someone To Trust:

Dream on-

Monsters are glued under my bed.

My love,

You know I’ll always keep you safe.

I’m lying wounded on a beach-

My last woman shot bullets at me,

And you’re my medic.

Picking me up from the ground,

I want you to know-

..........................................................................

You’re someone to trust,

Someone to love-

Someone who builds people up

And doesn’t break them apart.

You’re all I need and more,

And I’m loyal to you.

.............................................................................

This sensation,

Of a woman’s hands warming me-

I forgot what it felt like.

I got used to liking the cold.

Empty place-

Drinking bitter coffee on my own.

You’re the sugar in my drink-

I can finally spread my wings again

And let things go.

............................................................................

You’re someone to trust,

Someone to love-

Someone who builds people up

And doesn’t break them apart.

You’re all I need and more,

And I’m loyal to you.

..........................................................................................

You held my hand at the station-

When we’re moving on to greater things,

You stayed by my side.

..........................................................................................

You’re someone to trust,

Someone to love-

Someone who builds people up

And doesn’t break them apart.

You’re all I need and more,

And I’m loyal to you.

Someone to trust,

Someone to love.

# Grace Your Space:

My love is cold, like an ice cream-

Come dine with me.

I thought the date went well with consistent conversation throughout. She seemed real appreciative of the whole thing with her demeanor and thank yous. 

After the date, I texted and said I had a good time, and I would love to go out again. She told me that she “had a great time too” and would get back to me because she “normally likes to think” before proceeding.  

I told her to reach out whenever she is ready. 

We are both pretty religious, so I can imagine she is trying to discern her next action (given the seriousness that the religious culture has towards dating). However, I’m still not sure how to take this. 

I’m thinking this is either a soft “no” from her, or she really is taking time to figure it all out (given the religious context).

Two more of your suggested breakfast sandwiches. Two very different sandwiches. I went traditional with Black Sheep and way out of the box with the Governors Cup. 

Black Sheep has a breakfast sandwich on the menu called the Roadrunner @ $7.
Simple and tasty, the Roadrunner comes on an English muffin, folded scrambled egg, generous ham portion, cheddar jack cheese and a very tasty béarnaise aioli. This simple sandwich is inexpensive and came hot and fresh. 

The Governors Cup offers many bagel sandwiches and I went way out of the box on the breakie. Wanting bacon that day, I opted for the ""Jack of Hearts"" on a sesame bagel and added an egg. Off the menu, the sandwich comes with mango chutney, bacon, pickled jalapeño, arugala and goats cheese. Ill say this sandwich is an interesting concept and had a lot going on. The mango chutney, jalapeños and goats cheese took over the sandwich overall, overwhelmingly the flavors from the bagel, bacon and egg. Not bad, but not really a breakfast sando and completely missing the mark. 

In fairness,  I will be trying GCup again... next time Ill get the ""Street Legal"" which is a more traditional breakfast type of sandwich. ",28,1763238665.0,SALEM,2,1.0,False

What are peoples experiences?,"Hey everyone, long-time reader here and this is a burner account and I am also a Male. I’ve been struggling with SIBO/Colon issues for years and I’m hoping to hear about other peoples stories that are similar to mine.

**Background:**  
I’ve had lifelong constipation, but things got significantly worse in 2019 after eating a steak. Overnight I developed extreme bloating, constipation, and even pus in my stool. Endoscopy/colonoscopy showed:

* Gastritis
* Bile overproduction
* Patchy colon inflammation
* No celiac, no H. pylori, no esophagitis, ileitis, or colitis

Doctor basically said it wasn’t significant and recommended Metamucil.

**Since then:**

* Coffee/water to trigger 2–3 morning BMs
* Acid Reflux
* Nights are the worst: heavy gas, bloating, and waking up middle of the night wide awake
* Stool often has undigested food
* Intermittent right-side abdominal pain (colon area + under right rib)

I’m have been working with Dr. Salt (GI doctor), he had my take some tests and I wanted to see if anyone else has had similar results.  
  
**Breath tests:**

* Lactulose and sucrose tests (showed abnormal results)

**Treatment I tried:**  
14 days of:

* Rifaximin 550 mg (3×/day)
* Nitazoxanide 500 mg (3×/day)

During the antibiotics:

* Bowel movements were amazing (large, formed, normal)
* Sleep was great
* BUT I had extreme congestion + endless clear mucus, so I couldn’t tell if I was sick or having die off.

A few months later, I’m basically back where I started—bloating, gas, reflux, poor sleep.

Dr. Salt’s recent suggestions (he is limited with his time now since he has cancer, as he should be):

* Atrantil
* Iberogast
* ISOVive
* Possibly the mBIOTA Elemental Diet

I personally feel like the antibiotics helped a lot and maybe I reintroduced foods too quickly or missed a supporting step afterward.

**Looking for advice:**  
For those who’ve dealt with SIBO, what protocols, sequencing, diet strategies, or follow-up steps helped you maintain the improvement after antibiotics? Anything I should revisit or look into further?

I am just kind of lost on what to as I know their is a certain process that should be followed and I am very overwhelmed with all the information out there. ",1,1763238519.0,SIBO,1,0.67,False

I’m coming into this season pretty late, I’m sure I’m not far off Midnight releasing and S3 ending, so I need to get my priorities in order! However, remix is awesome. I want to get my KSM and AOTC as fast as I can so I can play that! I’m planning to get my PVP elite sets to Priest, DH and maybe Shaman too. Already done with DH!

I can play most classes but I mainly enjoy my Resto Druid and my Blood DK. In the past I’ve had some bad experiences with tanking as people can be… a little ruthless if my pathing is not perfect. Healing I usually do alright, but this season is the first time I’ve tried to heal this expac, and I’m really struggling to heal? It feels like everyone’s health barely increases relatively to how it used to. Not sure… 

Anyway. What are my options as far as gearing goes? Ideally, the fastest way to get to a decent level to spam Mythic+? I usually do this every season but I’ve never started so late. With my ilvl I’m struggling to even get into Normal raids! I have used 3 chips on a Haste mainhand voidcore staff and I have the quest to get more I think.

What actually is The Brain Song (Honest 30-Day Review),"I’ve been lurking here for a while, watching the endless debates about nootropics and brain apps. When I first saw the ads for ""The Brain Song""—the audio track claiming to stimulate BDNF and boost your Gamma brain waves in minutes—I was one of the biggest skeptics. An audio file that boosts my brain? It sounded like pure pseudoscience and snake oil, but the promise of improved focus finally wore me down. I had to know: **Does this thing actually work?**

My biggest pain point has always been the 3 PM slump. I work a demanding job that requires sharp memory recall and sustained focus, and lately, the mental fatigue has been brutal. I tried all the usual fixes: more caffeine (which gave me the jitters), meditation (which I wasn't consistent with), and expensive supplements (which did nothing but make my wallet lighter).

When I stumbled across The Brain Song, I saw two things that made me pause my scroll:

1. **The time commitment:** Just 12 minutes a day. That's less than my coffee break.
2. **The price structure:** **One-time payment.** No recurring $50/month subscription BS.

I decided to treat it as a low-risk experiment. If it didn't work, I was only out a little cash, and they offered a decent guarantee.

# What actually is The Brain Song?

So, let's break down the tech behind the hype. The Brain Song isn't a motivational speech or a regular meditation track. It's a neuro-acoustic audio program that uses specific sound frequencies—often referred to as *brainwave entrainment* or *isochronic tones*—to gently guide your brain's electrical activity. The goal is to encourage the brain into a Gamma wave state, which is scientifically linked to peak concentration, heightened memory processing, and the stimulation of BDNF (Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor). Essentially, you are passively 'listening' your way to better mental performance.

# My Real Results and the Financial Breakdown

# Does The Brain Song Actually Work?

When I first listened to it, I almost laughed. It’s not music; it’s a weird, pulsing, whooshing soundscape, often described as *brainwave entrainment* audio. It’s supposed to be guiding your brain into that Gamma wave state associated with deep learning and sharp focus.

Compared to nootropic supplements and brain-training apps, The Brain Song offers a non-invasive, time-efficient alternative that many users find effective—although results vary.

* **Week 1: Nothing.** Honestly, I just felt a little annoyed by the sound and kept checking the clock. The biggest benefit was just having 12 forced minutes of quiet time. I almost gave up.
* **Week 2: The Subtle Shift.** This is where I started noticing something. It wasn't a sudden burst of genius, but the afternoon slump wasn't as severe. Instead of hitting a wall at 3 PM, I felt a smoother decline in energy. My mental recall felt *less effortful*—I was pulling up names and facts just a tiny bit quicker.
* **Week 3 & 4: Consistency Pays Off.** I committed to listening first thing in the morning with good quality over-the-ear headphones. The biggest benefit for me now (30 days in) is **clarity and flow**. I still get distracted, but I snap back into focus faster. The ""fog"" is noticeably thinner. I feel like the *maximum* level of clarity I can achieve during the workday has been elevated.

**Verdict on Effectiveness:** Is it magic? No. Is it a replacement for good sleep and diet? Absolutely not. But as a daily, passive tool, I am genuinely impressed with the subtle cognitive boost. I’d estimate about 70-80% of the positive reviews I've read about improved focus and recall are aligned with my personal experience, *provided you use it every single day.* **If you're already using it, jump into the comments and confirm if the 3-week mark was the game-changer for you, too!**

# How Much Does The Brain Song Cost?

This is the best part, especially if you’re tired of being locked into monthly bills.

* **The Current Price:** The standard audio program is available for a **one-time fee of $39.**
* **The Value Proposition:** For that $39, you get the digital file and immediate access. There are **zero subscription costs**, ever. This is what truly sold me, as it makes it cheaper than a single month of many popular focus apps (like Brain.fm or meditation subscriptions).
* **Multi-License Options:** I saw they offer bundles, like a 3-user license for around $127 and a 5-user family license for $197. If you have a spouse or kids needing focus for school/work, that actually brings the per-person cost way down.
* **The Safety Net:** It comes with a 90-day money-back guarantee. That’s three whole months to test it out before deciding if it's right for you. If you’re skeptical, the guarantee truly makes it a no-brainer to try. **Before you write this off as hype,** [**check out the official site**](https://d32c3infspid5nty10rg6hvc00.hop.clickbank.net) **and see the 90-day guarantee: Can you afford** ***not*** **to spend $39 to try a potentially game-changing tool?**

So, to answer the title's question for me: **Yes, it works, but subtly.** It’s not a miracle cure, but it is a consistent, low-effort tool for better focus and reducing reliance on caffeine.

**If you’re struggling with brain fog or concentration, that 90-day refund policy makes this a low-risk commitment you should** [**check out on the official site**](https://d32c3infspid5nty10rg6hvc00.hop.clickbank.net)**.**

1oy1ve9,https://i.redd.it/q10bew07ch1g1.jpeg,Cursor 2.0: 10 Days of Shipping MVPs - A Complete Overview,"I just shipped 2 client MVPs using Cursor 2.0 instead of Claude Code. Here’s everything I discovered after 10 days of heavy use.

-----

## **The Agent-First Interface**

Cursor 2.0 has completely reimagined its UI by putting agents at the center instead of files. You focus on outputs while Cursor handles the implementation behind the scenes. This represents their vision for code-free development.

**Key detail:** You can still switch to the classic IDE view anytime you need to manually tweak code or dive deeper.

-----

## **Composer 1: When Speed Matters**

**Is it better than GPT-5 Codex or Sonnet 4.5?**  
No.

**Is it way faster?**  
Absolutely.

For rapid prototyping and shipping simple features, speed is everything. I’ve been using Composer 1 for hobby projects and client work, and the performance boost is noticeable. Perfect for “vibe coding” sessions where you need to iterate quickly.

-----

## **Multi-Model Prompting (Game Changer)**

Credit to Alex Finn for this approach.

**The problem:** Single models sometimes produce inconsistent UI outputs (looking at you, purple gradients).

**The solution:** Run identical prompts across multiple models simultaneously, then choose the best result.

Yes, it’s more expensive. But for client work where UI quality matters, it’s absolutely worth the cost.

-----

## **Built-In Browser for Real-Time Debugging**

Windsurf pioneered this feature, but Cursor has now caught up.

**What you can do:**

- Select and inspect any UI element
- Access full developer tools
- Debug in real-time
- Fix UI issues instantly

No more alt-tabbing between your IDE and browser. Everything happens in one place.

-----

## **Automated Code Reviews**

Click “Agent Review” to automatically scan for:

- Security vulnerabilities
- Common bug patterns
- Code quality issues

**My take:** It’s solid for basic checks, but for comprehensive PR reviews on production code, I still prefer dedicated tools like @CodeRabbit.

-----

## **Cloud Agents: Code From Anywhere**

This is the feature I’m still experimenting with, but the potential is impressive.

**The concept:** Run development agents from any device, including your phone.

**Use case example:**  
You’re at a coffee shop without your laptop. Connect to your GitHub repo from your phone and add features, create content, or handle marketing tasks remotely.

Full development workflow from any device with an internet connection.

-----

## **TL;DR - When to Use Each Feature**

- **Composer 1** → Rapid prototyping and speed
- **Multi-model prompting** → High-quality UI output
- **Built-in browser** → Real-time debugging and testing
- **Cloud agents** → Remote development flexibility
- **Agent-first UI** → Focus on outcomes, not implementation

1oy1uuc,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_Timely_Scientist4181/comments/1oy1uuc/being_an_arab_girl_in_europe_between_worlds_and/,Being an Arab Girl in Europe: Between Worlds and Under Watch,"Being a first-generation Arab girl in Europe is a constant exercise in navigating worlds that both embrace and reject you, yet neither fully accepts you. You’re “too white” for some Arabs, “too Arab” for the local population, and no matter what you do, you’re judged. Every decision, every action, becomes a public spectacle under the gaze of strangers, community members, and even your own people.



For Arab girls, especially Iraqi girls like myself, marrying outside our culture is perhaps one of the most heavily scrutinized choices we can make. My husband is Somali and Italian, a man my parents wholeheartedly embraced because they valued his character over his ethnicity. But outside my home, the situation is far more complicated. Within my community, marrying a non-Arab is not merely frowned upon — it is treated as a public offense. And Arab boys? They are free from the scrutiny that weighs so heavily on girls. They can date, party, explore relationships with whomever they choose, and their choices are rarely questioned. Arab girls, however, are judged for every choice, every interaction, and every step that does not conform to community expectations.



I’ve experienced this judgment firsthand. My husband and I were at a mall when we noticed a group of Iraqis staring at us lingering, double looking, assessing. Later, in a store, the cashier -an Arab man who knows me completely ignored me and interrogated my husband, asking about his background, studies, and residence. It wasn’t friendliness; it was surveillance. It was curiosity disguised as concern. Later, I discovered my ex and also my first arab boyfriend had unblocked me on social media, leaving a deleted message, a reminder that somehow, my relationships are never private, that the community watches, knows, and talks.



The irony is painful. Those women in my community who criticize me for marrying outside my culture are often the ones whose husbands have cheated, lied, or engaged in abusive behavior. Yet the only priority is cultural purity — as long as he’s Iraqi, his past doesn’t matter. For Arab girls, however, even minor missteps in dating, socializing, or asserting independence are magnified into moral failures. A girl who has interacted with several men before marriage, even harmlessly, is labeled a “whore” or “trash,” while boys in the same situation are celebrated or excused.



Living under this scrutiny affects everything. It shapes the way you walk down the street, order a coffee, or engage with strangers. Every glance from another Arab can feel like a judgment passed; every encounter becomes a mental inventory of your perceived missteps. Girls absorb this fear, this guilt, this constant tension, learning early that independence, curiosity, and personal choice are luxuries they cannot fully enjoy.



Being a first-generation Arab in Europe complicates this further. You straddle identities: navigating Western norms while being constantly reminded of your Arab roots. Too Western, and you are disconnected from your culture. Too Arab, and you are seen as an outsider in the local society. There is no neutral space, no place to exist without judgment. And yet, the world still demands that you behave “correctly” according to both codes.



This double standard, this surveillance, this policing of women’s lives, leaves deep emotional scars. It fosters fear, guilt, and self-doubt, yet also forces resilience. Arab girls learn early how to navigate oppressive expectations, how to protect themselves emotionally, and how to push back against community policing all while walking in public, attempting to live ordinary lives.



The reality is clear: the Arab community’s obsession with cultural purity and the policing of girls is not harmless tradition. It’s a system that damages self-esteem, fosters fear, and enforces impossible double standards. And until this is acknowledged and challenged, girls like me will continue to walk through our lives under watchful eyes, balancing love, identity, and freedom against an unrelenting judgment we never asked for.",1,1763238077.0,u_Timely_Scientist4181,0,1.0,False

“Mikey please, please get back up here.” Paul begged as he watched the orange rope come back with no resistance. He pulled fast and heard the familiar clinking of the harness. His hands didn’t stop until the harness covered in thick red blood was all that came up from the hole. Paul held the harness in his hands for a long minute before looking back to the hole. He now could see what Mikey had seen before lowering himself down into the darkness. It was the light of a window. Like what you would see walking past a house lit up from the inside. Paul started dumbfound at the thought of anything being on the hole. But now his friend was somewhere down there. If he was down there. He must have gone towards the light. Paul slipped the bloody harness on and lowered himself into the hole after his friend. He understood now what Mikey ment about the rungs in the dirt. He had a place hole for each hand and foot as he went. He did t know how far he had gotten before the walls grew cold around him and slimy to the touch. His hands slipped as he tried to grab onto the rung again. Before he could depositing his hands his feet slipped and he slid off of the wall and down further into the sinkhole. 
He grabbed onto the harness tightly as he fell and sliced into his hands. He hit the ground hard and the wind was knocked out of him. He fought to catch his breath as the orange rope sprawled around him. He finally took in a breath of air as his lugs burned painfully. He looked up and saw an old cabin nestled into the dirt infront of him. The window was lit up and he could see shadows coming from inside. His back ached as he stood up and moved slowly towards the window. How could this be here? How was a whole building incased underground. He crept up to the glass and peered inside and felt his mouth slowly fall open. Mikey was laid out on a table completely naked except for a cloth clocking his lower half. Moving around him was a blob of brown moving earth. It slid on the already dirt cover floor leaving thick piles of itself behind. It made a choking coughing sound as its arms moved around a sink. Paul watched it take a jar and a spoon over to Mikey and force his mouth open. Mikey having suffered a worser fall fought back as best he could but took the sooo. Full of dirt and began choking as the monster forced his mouth shut. Mikey thrashed and jilted his body as the monster took a sudden glance at the window. Paul stumbled back as it moved towards the wooden door. Paul followed the orange rope back towards the opening of the sinkhole and saw the street lights above him. He stood and realized he was only a foot or two away from the opening. He climbed out and looked around the street in a daze. 

“ hey kid!”. The guard yelled from a few feet away. Paul looked over at him still dazed but not wanting to get caught. He unclipped the harness from the rope and sprinted away from the portly guard as he spotted Mikey’s bike resting against a streetlight. He felt a wave of sickness wash over him at the thought of abandoning his friend. He searched quickly for the slit in the fence and found it just as the sun was coming up. He pushed his way through. Exhausted, tariffed and covered in dirt, Paul made his way blindly through the woods and back to his street just as the sun was fully awake in the sky above him. He slipped inside his house and slipped into the bathroom and stripped off all of his clothes. Dirt lined the floor and every part of his clothing. He first showed and scrubbed his body raw to get it clean. He burned his clothes and spent hours scrubbing the bathroom floor clean. He kept the bloody harness in his sock drawer for safe keeping. 

A few days later Paul was sitting around the table with his mouth asked she was watching the news. It was explained that the sink hole was just a natural cave the town had no clue or forgot about. They just built right on top of it without knowing. 

“Isn’t that crazy?” His mother asked him as he stared blankly at the table. “ I e lived here all my life and had
No clue. There were these weird caves all over town when I was a little girl but they were all filled in with dirt as far as I can tell. There was even this terrifying story about a kid being in one of the caves while it was being filled in.”. 

Paul looked up from the table and stared at her. “ really?”. She nodded and stood to get more coffee. 

“ oh yeah. Think they just told us that stuff to keep us away from the filling in spots though.” She paused and sipped her coffee slowly then looked over to Paul. 

“Where’s Mikey been lately?” she asked him. Paul staid silent for a few seconds then he looked back to his mother.

* **Week 2: The Subtle Shift.** This is where I started noticing something. It wasn't a sudden burst of genius, but the afternoon slump wasn't as severe. Instead of hitting a wall at 3 PM, I felt a smoother decline in energy. My mental recall felt *less effortful*—I was pulling up names and facts just a tiny bit quicker.
* **Week 3 & 4: Consistency Pays Off.** I committed to listening first thing in the morning with good quality over-the-ear headphones. The biggest benefit for me now (30 days in) is **clarity and flow**. I still get distracted, but I snap back into focus faster. The ""fog"" is noticeably thinner. I feel like the *maximum* level of clarity I can achieve during the workday has been elevated.

**Verdict on Effectiveness:** Is it magic? No. Is it a replacement for good sleep and diet? Absolutely not. But as a daily, passive tool, I am genuinely impressed with the subtle cognitive boost. I’d estimate about 70-80% of the positive reviews I've read about improved focus and recall are aligned with my personal experience, *provided you use it every single day.*

# 2. How Much Does The Brain Song Cost?

This is the best part, especially if you’re tired of being locked into monthly bills.

* **The Current Price:** The standard audio program is available for a **one-time fee of $39.**
* **The Value Proposition:** For that $39, you get the digital file and immediate access. There are **zero subscription costs**, ever. This is what truly sold me, as it makes it cheaper than a single month of many popular focus apps (like Brain.fm or meditation subscriptions).
* **Multi-License Options:** I saw they offer bundles, like a 3-user license for around $127 and a 5-user family license for $197. If you have a spouse or kids needing focus for school/work, that actually brings the per-person cost way down.
* **The Safety Net:** It comes with a 90-day money-back guarantee. That’s three whole months to test it out before deciding if it's right for you. If you’re skeptical, the guarantee truly makes it a no-brainer to try.

For $39, and with the 90-day refund policy, I feel like this was a worthwhile experiment. It’s a low-effort tool that has subtly improved my daily mental performance and reduced my reliance on caffeine.

1oy1n1n,https://www.reddit.com/r/newproductsamazon/comments/1oy1n1n/whats_the_real_difference_between_a_puzzle_board/,What's the real difference between a puzzle board and a puzzle table?,"Hey everyone!

So I've been really into jigsaw puzzles lately, and I kept seeing people talk about puzzle boards and puzzle tables. At first, I thought they were basically the same thing, but after doing some research and trying both, I realized they're actually pretty different. Let me break it down for you.

**Puzzle Boards: The Portable Option**

A puzzle board is basically a flat surface, usually made from wood or cardboard, that you can work on anywhere. The cool thing is you can move it around easily. Working on a puzzle in the living room but need the coffee table for dinner? Just slide the board somewhere else. Some even come with a cover so your cat doesn't destroy your progress overnight.

They're lightweight, affordable, and perfect if you don't have a dedicated puzzle space. I found some really good options here: https://athomewave.com/puzzle-board. Most puzzle boards have raised edges or sorting trays attached, which honestly saves so much time.

**Puzzle Tables: The Permanent Setup**

Now, puzzle tables are a whole different beast. These are actual pieces of furniture designed specifically for puzzles. They usually have legs, drawers for storing pieces, and sometimes even tilted surfaces so you're not hunching over like a gremlin.

The downside? They take up space and cost more. But if you're serious about puzzling and have the room, they're amazing for your back and neck.

**Which One Should You Get?**

Honestly, it depends on your situation. If you live in a smaller place or just do puzzles occasionally, a puzzle board makes way more sense. You get all the functionality without sacrificing space or money. If you've got a spare room and puzzle multiple times a week, a table might be worth considering.

For most people though, I'd recommend starting with a quality puzzle board. You can check out different sizes and styles at https://athomewave.com/puzzle-board and see what fits your needs. They're practical, storage-friendly, and you won't feel bad if you decide puzzling isn't your thing after all.

Hope this helps clear things up! Happy puzzling!",1,1763237537.0,newproductsamazon,0,1.0,False

This must be the best tech/architecture performance I’ve seen.  Yeah some people can’t get in, and sometimes it’s a bit slow loading but nothing compared to PSN going down for days, COD fucking up for days in the 2000’s, 40min raid loading screens and previous auth login issues seen for days previously pre Covid. 

Let’s not forget this is Steam added for day 1. Massive and building on a big player bases also. 

Give BGS a break, don’t like it, go somewhere else.  Else show appreciation for what you like and are happy to bash when down. We need to support BGS for a great game and should be happy they are committed to fixing unlucky big dev/publishers.

I drink light roasts and enjoy the coffee it makes, and with most beans I prefer it to the Comandante C40, which is my only other grinder and therefore my only point of comparison.

On this forum, clarity-oriented hand grinders are commonly discussed, especially ZP6 and Pietro. Electric grinders are discussed a bit less, and in particular the Niche Duo with filter burrs is never even mentioned.

Where does the Duo with its filter burrs stand compared to more popular grinders in terms of cup quality, clarity, and body? Can the crowd-favourite hand grinders ZP6 or Pietro beat my 83mm flat burrs in cup quality? Which electric grinder would be a significant upgrade, and why?

My name is Anthony. I’m a 35-year-old man (US, ET time zone) who thrives on thoughtfulness, curiosity, and mutual experiences.

I’m thoroughly introverted with a bold soul; connecting with someone who matches my energy enkindles that tendency like little else. I seek people who seek meaningful connection that plays out in several different ways, from daily casual chats to shared passions and endeavors. I appreciate the sudden whim of adventure as well.

I adore abstract minds and vibrant souls.

Rumination and contemplation are lifelong pursuits of mine. I’m an autodidact who’s been passionate about a variety of persuasions since I’ve been young.

Creativity and artistry are important to me. Personally, I write: about my observations, thoughts, and lived experiences. I also dabble in photography.

Little and foundational things fill the spaces of my life, some of which include coffee, both simple and bitter and excessively frilly concoctions, burning incense, because I've always thought the smoke is cool, archiving and organizing, collecting (written texts, oddities and cool things), and time pieces.

1oy1lnb,https://www.reddit.com/r/stuffyouneeddaily/comments/1oy1lnb/what_are_the_types_of_smart_plugs_available/,What are the types of smart plugs available?,"So I've been diving deep into smart home stuff lately, and smart plugs have honestly changed how I use electricity at home. If you're thinking about getting some, it helps to know what's actually out there because not all smart plugs are created equal.

**Basic Wi-Fi Smart Plugs**

These are your standard smart plugs that connect directly to your home Wi-Fi network. You just plug them into any outlet, connect them to an app on your phone, and boom – you can control whatever's plugged into them from anywhere. I use mine for lamps, fans, and my coffee maker. The best part? No extra equipment needed, just your regular wireless router.

**Smart Plugs with Energy Monitoring**

Some smart plugs come with energy monitoring features that show you exactly how much power your devices are using. This is super helpful if you're trying to cut down on your electric bill. I was shocked to learn my old space heater was costing me way more than I thought. These smart plugs track everything and send reports straight to your phone.

**Outdoor Smart Plugs**

If you want to control things outside like holiday lights or garden fountains, outdoor smart plugs are weatherproof and built tougher. They can handle rain, snow, and extreme temperatures. I got mine specifically for Christmas lights so I don't have to go outside in the cold anymore.

**Smart Plugs with USB Ports**

These have regular outlets plus USB charging ports built in. Pretty convenient for charging phones and tablets without needing separate adapters. They're perfect for nightstands and home offices where you've got multiple devices going.

**Mini Smart Plugs**

Mini smart plugs are smaller and don't block the second outlet like bigger ones do. If you've got limited outlet space, these are clutch. They do the same job but take up way less room.

**Smart Power Strips**

Technically these are strips with multiple smart outlets you can control individually. Great for entertainment centers where you've got your TV, gaming console, and sound system all plugged in. You can set schedules for each device separately.

If you're ready to start making your home smarter, I'd definitely recommend checking out [these smart plug options](https://goodhomedeals.com/smart-plugs) to see what fits your needs. There's a solid selection with different features and price points.

The cool thing about smart plugs is you don't need to replace any switches or hire an electrician. Just plug them in and download the app. Most work with Alexa and Google Assistant too, so you can use voice commands.

Whether you want to save money on electricity, control devices remotely, or just make life more convenient, there's definitely a smart plug type that'll work for you. I started with just two and now I've got them all over my place because they're honestly that useful.

You can browse through [different smart plug models here](https://goodhomedeals.com/smart-plugs) and find the ones that match what you're looking for. Start small if you're unsure – even one or two smart plugs will make a noticeable difference in how you manage your home.",1,1763237440.0,stuffyouneeddaily,0,1.0,False
