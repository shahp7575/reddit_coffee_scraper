So on Sunday, Dec 8th I decided to reschedule my NCLEX exam to the 26th that was suppose to be on the 11th because I felt like I needed more time. Also to save my voucher I received from my school (non refundable, non transferable). I was on the phone with my cousin when this all happened. I made sure I confirmed it on the website  and everything, in fact I even made that extra muscle to click back to it when it took me back to the dashboard. I even screenshoted the page where it showed the time and location because I wanted to let my impatient father know that I rescheduled it because I really needed more time to study. * I took a peek in my email and saw an email from Pearsonvue; didnt bother to look at it because I knew it was the confirmation.

Busy week with events passed, I was ready to go back in the study grind. I was at the coffee shop and casually checked my emails to see that confirmation again. But guess what. It was a ‚Äúreminder‚Äù email for my 11th Exam. At this point it was already the 15th of December. Hands shaking and panicking I made phone calls to Pearsonvue. then to the BVNPT then had to wait the next day to call Pearsonvue again just to tell me that ‚Äútheyres nothing we can do, since it is marked as ‚Äúno show.‚Äù Feeling defeated‚Ä¶ I went ahead and paid that $200 fee.

They still told me to pay the fee, but i emailed back about an additonal $300 is a lot of money to me right now.

Many people long for a brighter, whiter smile. If you‚Äôre one of them, you may have heard about Zoom teeth whitening. This popular cosmetic dental procedure is known for delivering impressive results in just one visit. Imagine walking into a dental office and leaving with a dramatically transformed smile. Let's take a closer look at the exciting before and after experiences associated with Zoom teeth whitening.

Before you undergo the procedure, it's common to wonder how effective it really is. Many patients have documented their journeys, showcasing stunning transformations. These before and after photos tell it all. Most of the time, the difference is striking, and it boosts not just their smiles but also their confidence. In fact, research shows that 75% of people said they would prefer to have a smile that‚Äôs bright and white over the perfect haircut or a nicely dressed outfit.

So, what can you expect from the Zoom teeth whitening process? Here‚Äôs a quick rundown:

Check The Details Here: https://prodentim.myofferdeals.com  
  
- **Initial Consultation:** Before starting, your dentist will assess your teeth and discuss your goals. It‚Äôs important to have realistic expectations.
- **Preparation:** Your teeth will be cleaned to remove any plaque or debris. This step is essential for achieving optimal results.
- **Application of the Whitening Gel:** A protective barrier is placed on your gums, and the whitening gel is applied to your teeth. The gel contains hydrogen peroxide, which works to break down stains.
- **Activation with Special Light:** The dentist uses a special light to activate the gel, helping it penetrate the enamel for a deeper whitening effect.
- **Finishing Touches:** After the treatment, the gel is removed, and you‚Äôll receive aftercare instructions to maintain your bright new smile.

The actual whitening procedure usually takes about 45 minutes to an hour, and many patients notice immediate results. The whitening process can brighten your teeth by several shades‚Äîsometimes as much as eight shades whiter in just one session!

But the before and after journey doesn‚Äôt just stop at the dental office. Maintaining your new smile is crucial for long-lasting effects. You may be tempted to indulge in your favorite foods and drinks, but remember that they'll affect your teeth. Staining agents like coffee, tea, red wine, and dark sodas can counteract your whitening treatment. It's advisable to avoid these for at least 24-48 hours post-treatment.

The Benefits and Risks of Professional Teeth Whitening Treatments
-----------------------------------------------------------------

Professional teeth whitening treatments have become increasingly popular for those looking to brighten their smiles. The appeal of these procedures is strong, but like any cosmetic treatment, they come with their own sets of advantages and potential drawbacks. Understanding both sides can help you make an informed decision.

One significant benefit of professional teeth whitening is the effectiveness of the procedure. Unlike over-the-counter whitening kits, treatments performed by dental professionals utilize stronger whitening agents. This means you can achieve noticeable results in just one session. Generally, you may experience:

Check The Details Here: https://prodentim.myofferdeals.com  
  
- **Immediate Results:** Many clients notice dramatic changes after just one appointment.
- **Customized Treatment:** Dentists can tailor the procedure to fit your specific needs and tooth sensitivity.
- **Long-lasting Effects:** With proper care, the results can last for a year or longer, making it a worthwhile investment.

Another advantage is the safety factor. When you opt for a professional treatment, you are under the care of a trained dental expert who can assess your dental health beforehand. This ensures:

- **Proper Diagnosis:** Your dentist can identify and address any underlying issues, such as cavities or gum disease, before proceeding.
- **Controlled Environment:** The treatment is carried out in a sterile environment, minimizing the risk of complications.
- **Expert Guidance:** Dental professionals can provide valuable aftercare advice to help maintain your results.

However, there are potential risks associated with professional teeth whitening treatments. Being aware of these can help you weigh your options carefully.

Check The Details Here: https://prodentim.myofferdeals.com  
  
Firstly, sensitivity is one of the most common side effects. During and after the procedure, you may experience:

- **Increased Tooth Sensitivity:** Many patients report temporary sensitivity to hot or cold temperatures after whitening.
- **Discomfort:** The use of strong bleaching agents can cause discomfort, particularly if you have pre-existing dental issues that increase sensitivity.

Financial costs are another downside. Professional whitening can be more expensive compared to store-bought alternatives. Depending on the dentist and treatment method, the costs may vary widely. Here‚Äôs what you might expect:

Check The Details Here: https://prodentim.myofferdeals.com  
  
- **Initial Consultations:** Many dental clinics charge for the initial assessment.
- **Procedure Costs:** The actual whitening treatment can range significantly based on the chosen method.

Moreover, maintaining your results may require additional expenses. After the treatment, your dentist might recommend touch-up appointments or special maintenance products to prolong your bright smile.

While rare, adverse reactions can occur. Some patients may experience:

Check The Details Here: https://prodentim.myofferdeals.com  
  
- **Gum Irritation:** The bleaching agents can irritate the gums if they make contact during treatment.
- **Uneven Whitening:** Depending on the condition of your teeth, results may vary, leading to uneven color.

Before deciding on professional teeth whitening, it‚Äôs crucial to consult with your dentist. A thorough examination and discussion about your dental history can help assess whether the treatment is right for you. They can explain the different methods available, such as in-office treatments or at-home kits supervised by a dentist, and help you choose what fits best for your needs.

Professional teeth whitening treatments offer significant benefits including quick, noticeable results and enhanced safety compared to DIY options. However, they also come with risks such as tooth sensitivity, financial considerations, and the possibility of uneven results. By discussing your options with a professional, you can ensure your choice is both safe and effective, allowing you to enjoy the smile you desire.

### Conclusion

Seeing those stunning transformations in ""zoom teeth whitening before and after"" photos is inspiring for anyone considering a brighter smile. Many individuals have experienced substantial improvements, gaining confidence and joy in their appearance. The treatment offers noticeable results in just one session, making it an attractive option for those wanting to enhance their smiles quickly.

However, while the benefits of professional teeth whitening are remarkable, it‚Äôs essential to weigh them against potential risks. Some people may experience temporary sensitivity or gum irritation following the procedure. Being aware of these risks allows you to make informed decisions about your dental care. Consulting with a qualified dentist can help you understand what to expect and how to maintain your whitened teeth.

Ultimately, zoom teeth whitening can be a life-changing experience, delivering impressive before and after results while boosting self-esteem. If you‚Äôre ready to enhance your smile, consider professional whitening as a viable option. Ensure you choose a reputable provider to minimize risks and maximize results. With the right care and attention to your oral health, you can enjoy a bright, radiant smile that you can proudly share with the world.

1hiexjm,https://www.reddit.com/r/starbucks/comments/1hiexjm/all_problems_are_top_down/,All problems are top down,"I‚Äôve worked for Starbucks for over three years now and I‚Äôm leaving soon to open my own coffee trailer, bc why not? I‚Äôm not leaving in a huff, I have actually adored my time with the company, so much that I wanted to move up. 

That never materialized and I could go off on how favoritism rules Starbucks hiring and promotion tactics these days, but I‚Äôd rather focus on the company‚Äôs big issues- which almost all come from the top down. 

Starbucks is a corporation. A huge, unthinking, uncaring conglomerate of busy bodies who never or rarely actually worked in a store, yet emerge every few months to make your life as a barista harder. 

Corporate is filled with fools- simply put. There is so much waste as the corporate level and the first thing the new ceo should have done was slash jobs in those departments giving the least yet earning the most. 

Why oh why do we keep selling product that does not sell well?

Why can we not get a decent choice of like three donuts to compete with Dunkin, instead of our ‚Äúfancy‚Äù cake monstrosity of a donut that tears your stomach up it‚Äôs so greasy?

Why are we still selling berry parfaits when we only get two every two days? Either invest in the damn things and pump up production a bit and maybe, you know, advertise the things we have on the menu, not just whatever promotional tie in the corporate dunces have made a deal over?

Why didn‚Äôt take us months and months to discontinue the chicken sandwich that got maple sauce all over the inside of the oven?

The biggest thing I don‚Äôt get is why we don‚Äôt advertise and invest in our lunch offerings more. Corporate seems happy to sell what they sell of what should be a vital part of our food investors, yet mostly sits untouched bc people can never expect them to be in stock. 

Concentrating on lunch foods we already have and are pretty good could help beat the afternoon slump and give Starbucks a boost in sales without having to spend too much capital on new food investment. Just advertise what you‚Äôve got good and get rid of what sucks. 

Why oh why do the corporate dunces spend time when they visit my store debating where the fricking straws should go, not actual meaningful conversations with staff about what could be run better?

I‚Äôm not leaving because of any one of these issues. I just happen to be able to get the capital together to start my own thing and would rather slave away for myself and see rewards for my work I put in- even if it‚Äôs just a bit better money wise, that‚Äôs still more comfort for me and my family with less oversight by people who shouldn‚Äôt be overseeing anything. 

This new ceo guy obviously means well, but it‚Äôs a bunch of lip service so far. He talked about getting the time for a
Brewed coffee down to 30 seconds‚Ä¶ which is how it is at many stores already. Maybe he was trying to take credit for a bigger roll out of vertica machines, but I‚Äôve seen no evidence of that. If you have your brewed coffee stickers coming out at their own station, it‚Äôs pretty easy just to quickly grab them and doesn‚Äôt take much time. 

If we want to serve customers quicker, maybe quit putting things on the menu that take longer to cook- like the wraps, which I think are overstuffed with potatoes and could be smaller to cook quicker. 

Anyway, I‚Äôm not a genius or anything and there could be a lot of reasons I‚Äôm not seeing here, so let me know if I‚Äôm way off on any of these issues. 

I‚Äôd especially love to know which items you would take off or add to the menu. ",0,1734681050.0,starbucks,0,0.5,False

1hieot2,https://www.reddit.com/r/Herpes/comments/1hieot2/sharing_my_experience_with_genital_herpes_and/,Sharing my experience with genital herpes and soliciting volunteers to try a herbal supplement,"I will quickly share my own experience, which leads to my asking for volunteers to validate my hypothesis about the effectiveness of a natural herbal supplement.

My first genital herpes outbreak should have been Sept 2023.¬† ‚ÄúShould‚Äù because it was a small lesion right at the pubic hairline and went unnoticed as a herpes OB, just a painful sting when I showered which felt like I accidentally tugged a pubic hair.¬† When I noticed the skin was breaking a few days later, I went to a general physician who said it was folliculitis.¬† It healed and I thought nothing of it.

Fast forward to March 2024 and I had another ‚Äúfolliculitis‚Äù.¬† I was a bit wary this time of something different, but again the same physician said that it‚Äôs not something else, even when I asked if it could be something like herpes.¬† I had my doubt, and kept observing the area, and I noticed another small red dot appearing the next morning which looked like the formation of a tiny blister.

I went to a dermatologist who said it‚Äôs likely herpes because of the multiple spots with what looked indeed like a blister for the latest one. ¬†He prescribed a 6-day course of acyclovir, and I after a week or so, the skin basically healed.

So the first ever OB to the 2^(nd) one was about 6 months, and I stopped taking my rigorous daily morning ground flaxseed after confirming I have herpes.¬† For 3 years prior to my first OB, I was ingesting about 40-45 grams of ground flaxseed every morning.¬† Great source of omega3, and great for my bowel movement.¬† But could it have been a trigger for genital herpes which has been with me for some time?

Anyway, I was hoping the next OB would be far away or never, as I quit having flaxseed.¬† Just around 2.5 months later in early June, I had another OB.¬† A small dot appeared in the afternoon, which wasn‚Äôt there the last time I peed 2 hours prior.¬† A feeling of dread came over me, and I started the course of antivirals knowing that the earlier they are taken, the more effective they are.¬† Worked like a charm, the single blister that was forming started to shrink the next day, dried up and scabbed by day 3-4 and by the time I finished my antivirals, the skin was basically healed.

Again in 2 months, another spot was emerging.¬† Started the antivirals right away.¬† And then in 2 months, the same thing.¬† This last time though something was different.¬† After the blister was gone, after about a week, I started noticing a tingling sensation in the pubic area when I showered.¬† I don‚Äôt feel itchy and don't have the urge to scratch, but when warm water runs over the area, there‚Äôs this tingling sensation.¬†

This must be what I read about others sharing their experience of prodromal syndromes.¬† So my body is fighting the virus after the course of the antivirals, even with the blister gone and skin healed.¬† It‚Äôs almost as if by letting the antivirals whack the virus down, I did not let the body wage a decisive battle against the virus, and so it keeps wanting to come back, unlike my 2^(nd) OB which was a full 6 months after the first one.

Having this sensation for a good 3 weeks, I thought about this problem.¬† By not letting my body fight the OB, my body did not rev up its immune system and relied on the antivirals to do the job, which led to frequent recurring OB.¬† They did not appear to be very serious (small dot of blister), but the latest one with the very noticeable prodromal syndromes suggest that I am getting ever more reliant on the antivirals.¬† Should I keep taking antivirals on a long term basis?

I personally hate to be on Western drugs on a prolonged basis, and prefer to see if there are natural products which can help.¬† (FYI, I am living in Asia, so ready access unlike in Western countries).  It‚Äôs just that I feel more confident of ingesting something on a regular basis being a natural product than a synthetic one.¬† For example, I do not take statin for my cholesterol but red rice yeast extract, which the active ingredient has a similar chemical structure to statin.

Anyway, coincidentally I have been helping my friend promoting a natural herbal supplement which in high dosage is a known anticancer product.¬† It is a fungus which grows from wood indigenous only to Taiwan.¬†

Please do your search for Antrodia cinnamomea to read up on the reports on its health benefits.¬† Since it revs up the immune system, and I have access to it, I was thinking whether it would help me in my herpes battle.¬† After a bit of searching, some Traditional Chinese medical recipes do indeed prescribe this fungus as treatment.

So I started taking a low dosage, around 50mg, every morning.¬† As a comparison, cancer patients would take in 2 grams per day, if not more for aggressive cancers.¬† This is about 3 weeks into my prodromal syndrome, and about 3 days after taking the supplement, an OB started.¬† This OB was slightly up the pubic hairline than my first OB.¬† With the blister forming on top of the hair follicle, it was easy to pull and burst the blister.¬† This happened around day 5.¬† What I noticed was that the lesion as a result of the blister breaking was not as red and raw and not stinging when I showered.¬† A small dot of blister showed up around this time as well, but did not grow in size.¬† I was careful not to break it.¬† Around day 7 another dot showed up.¬† So all in all, 3 spots in this OB episode.¬† The 2 blisters never broke, became smaller, scabbed and healed.

Over this time, I have been taking the daily 50mg of the herbal supplement.¬† I am biased to believe that it was effective for me, in that the lesion was not as raw and the blisters did not break and healed.¬† It is fair to say that I have not had enough episodes to really conclude that Antrodia cinnamomea was truly effective.  I do believe that traditional chinese medicine can be very effective in some sustained longer term ailments.  Whether this is it, I really want to find out.

However, I think I have enough OBs to tell me that the normal course of antivirals is not enough, and that I either have to take a longer course at each OB or I should take them for a prolonged period of time.¬† I simply do not want these to be options.

My guess is that there are quite a number of you other there with similar experience, and perhaps share my thoughts on looking for natural herbal products instead of synthetic drugs.

Therefore, I am soliciting 20 volunteers who would like to try Antrodia cinnamomea and see if it makes a difference to your outbreak or prevent outbreaks from happening. ¬†This is a fairly expensive herbal material (due to the wood being only grown in Taiwan and that‚Äôs dwindling).  That said, if this indeed works for some people, the cost is less than a Starbucks coffee a day, which is still more expensive than a drug like acyclovir.¬† My friend is interested to know if my theory has basis, so that we can also help others and not just cancer patients.¬† True, saving cancer patients‚Äô lives is important, but many tend to stick with chemo or radiation therapy and not go down parallel treatments on their own, which their doctors would always advise against.  If only 5% of herpes patients find this suitable, that's still a very large number of people who can benefit.

So for those who truly have a problem now that do not appear to be addressed by antivirals (or those who do not want to be reliant on them) and want to explore using natural herbal products, please message me about your situation.¬† For example, if you only have a OB once a year, then probably taking this supplement will not tell us anything, and so please reserve this for those who need it and can provide valuable feedback whether the theory is correct with a 30-day course.¬† We will be able to provide 20 volunteers free of charge a 30-days worth of supplement.¬† What we ask in return is feedback on taking it, whether it is nothing, good or bad.

A disclosure at this time.  We would welcome people buying the supplement after positive feedback, I am not going to lie.  Now, this is a separate issue, and there is no strings attached to providing material to the 20 volunteers.  The only thing we ask is honest feedback on their experience to report back on this forum.  
  
There are other suppliers of the herbal supplement, and those who partake in this informal assessment are free to buy those on their own, as I said no strings attached.  That said, I only trust material from my friend, as I understand his production and extraction process and therefore confident that material from him is for real.  Being an expensive supplement, there's a lot of fake products out there.",1,1734679925.0,Herpes,1,0.67,False

When my now husband first came around, that was the first time that I saw them react a little more aggressively towards someone's religion. My DH had told me that LDS members get picked on and often times hated but I didn't really fully understand that. My family wasn't being hateful, they were concerned that I was going to be overly pressured to convert. Which in there defense, did happen for a period of time.

To be completely fair my DH had been excommunicated prior to us meeting and had hopes to rejoin the church at a later time, while all four of his children remained in the church. Today, me joining is more of a dream come true to him rather than something that is likely to happen. The phrase ""flirt to convert"" really rubbed me the wrong way and I told him if he felt that way he should just marry within the church. Luckily my husband and I can joke and laugh about a lot of things and have a great understanding of one another. I could not be happier to call him my husband.

To be supportive of him and the kids, I partake in bible lessons and try to be supportive in their beliefs. I no longer get the screams when I make myself a cup of coffee or tea, and receive fewer questions if I so choose to have a drink at a restaurant. I spend time on my own trying to understand the Gospel and see if I can relate to any of it. I'm worried about how things will be if/when we have children. And part of me is more willing to convert, even if it's not genuine, to prevent the fights down the road.

Our youngest is about to get baptized and he just finished his missionary lessons, which I think every child should have to do since 8 is very young to truly be baptized by their own choice in my opinion. And it has me wondering a few questions to better understand the members and to further my own journey.

Questions to the members:

* If you weren't raised in the church, do you think you'd join on your own?
* What have you had to give up by being a member/ converting?
* Do you feel a huge divide between members and non members?
* Is there any point in joining the church if you don't think you will ever get to a temple recommendation?
* Have you ever had to make a loved one wait outside while you were getting sealed at the temple? Did that affect your relationship?
* Do you feel like the church has changed for you while being a member, if so how?
* Do you feel like you have to agree with everything the church stands for to be a true member?
* Have you ever felt hated/ threatened because of your faith? Why/ How?
* What helps you keep your testimony?
* This last question is for my daughter. In a non cheesy way how do you allow your questions to be asked when family is coming down on you hard with religion?
   * I've notice ever since she has been baptized that she has been pulling away from the church. And I want to support her but also do not want to be a negative influence on her faith. From the things she has felt comfortable enough to share with me it doesn't sound like she has a testimony at all. I tend to at a certain point redirect her to talk to her father since I can't answer all those questions. But it seems like when she does religion is pushed on her in a way that isn't reaching her. It puts me in a really difficult situation.

There is a kitchen counter in the common area as well as a couch area with a coffee table. Both not really suitable as a work station.

On the other hand location is really nice and this option is about half as expensive as other options nearby. Main selling point is starlink.

The bedroom has two beds, and I asked the owner if they could replace one of the beds with a desk. They said no as they don't have a desk and would not know where to store the bed..

Any creative solutions here? Is there a way to convert a bed into a desk?",1,1734678153.0,digitalnomad,7,0.6,False

I prefer to talk about how I feel when live in DaLat more than tourism spots to visit. 
First of all, the weather is cool, not as cold as winter in the North of VietNam, in the early morning 20 Dec 2024, it is around 13¬∞C, upto 20¬∞C in mid-day, for a person who has some health problems like me, I enjoy living without air conditioner, my nose feels good with the weather here, also the city is not polluted
Second, I enjoy a lot of good foods here, food here is not the best of the country, but with the good weather, plus friendly + harmless people, I always enjoy good coffee, local foods, going out without worrying about anything, I have never lost anything here during 2 years live here.
Third, I can easily access to nature site, area if I want to without any struggle, of course I have a bike
So DaLat is a city for those who like to enjoy the weather (DaLat is likely little Europe to some people), want to spend time with nature and enjoy little beautiful things in life. If you have a chance come to DaLat and need a friend show you around, send me a message through my Instagram: @dalattripadvisor

He refuses to use the bathroom outside for some fucking reason, had him maybe three days? He's used the bathroom outside maybe 3 times. I've had to clean up after him so much and I'm not left alone and he keeps wanting to play and bite me and cause problems and bark at my cats and scream because I have my door shut even when my dad is RIGHT there and my dad isn't helping AT ALL and I'm so sick of it. My dad already bothers me so much ""Make me coffee!"" ""Look at the cat!"" ""Help me with my computer!"" and I'm just trying to DO MY SCHOOL. Like, now it's not just that, now its ""The dog pood!"" ""The dog peed!"" ""take the dog out!"" and the dog is such a sweet boy, he just wants to play and love, but he's like. idek how old. a couple months? the lady didn't tell us. and I want to cry and rip my skin off because I have to put this GOD DAMN kennel together. Like. I'm 15. I was expecting him to look at the puppy and say ""Nah, we can't have a dog rn Alger"" but NO he said yes and it's HELL. I don't want to hate my dog. I want this to be something I can get over and get better in time. But oh my god. I'm a teenager. I already can barely keep my room clean, now its covered in blankets, pillows, toys, and news paper. and my dads complaining about that. and im having to study for my GOD DAMN drivers test. that i have to take tomorrow. I haven't even been brushing my teeth anymore. I wake up. Get up. Clean up whatever god forsaked fucking mess that dog has made. and start my school work. which gets interrupted every around 2 hours for that dog. or my dad. or both. or my cats. and we cant rehome him, dad wouldnt do that. id feel bad, but honestly it might be better. kms sounds better /nsrs. i literally cant even make myself take care of me right now. fucking school, my dog, my cats, my dad, my drivers test, AND having to brush my hair, teeth, and shower?? Yeah, no. What the fuck am I supposed to do? Like, I can't ask my dad to take care of the dog more, he's literally sick rn. I might when he's feeling better idk

edit,, to just add more because im just crying now  
I got him in the kennel and it was really easy to put up, but it has to go in my room. My room is already pretty small. I had plans for how my room was supposed to be decorated, but now that's been entirely ruined. Because I have to have a dog kennel in my room. I think I hate dogs. Or atleast, owning them. I'm a teenager, my life is already so fucking full I feel like I can't have any time to myself anymore. I can't even fucking change clothes everyday. Stuck at home. Doing school. Drawing. Helping my dad. Helping my dog. My room is smaller than it was supposed to be, but that was okay. I still had a plan. I still was happy with it and had plans for how it would go. Now it's ruined. I feel like the only good parts left in my life are my cats, which don't want to be around me right now because of that DOG, and my partner. I feel like the only joys in my life have been taken because i have responsibilities. My dad is 80 now, because he had me when he was in his fucking 60s. So he doesn't even take care of me. The only thing he does is offer to make me food, which I'm rarely even hungry anymore. Because I have chips in my room. Which I eat. All day. Because it's easy to reach and I don't have to leave my room. and I can't even enjoy shit, because when I AM having fun with my friends, it's at night, and since our house is SO fucking small because he HADDDD to move and he HAD to be so FUCKING CHEAP with EVERYTHING building this place the walls are PAPER FUCKING THIN, and his bed is DIRECTLY on the wall next to my room, and I CANT DECORATE MY ROOM, TO FILTER THE SOUND, he hears me. Apparently only when I'm enjoying my life though! Because anytime he needs me and I YELL, asking WHAT HE NEEDS, he doesn't hear a thing! Notta! Nothing! I just want my space. I want to be left alone. I don't want to be taken care of, and I don't want to take care of others. I don't want to hate my dog. I want to love him, and enjoy him, but everything he does just makes me angry. He wants to play! I want to sleep. He won't use his toys, he wants to bite me. I want to sleep. The literal only peaceful moments I get are when he's asleep. And it's JUST my dad and me, which is hell. ""We need to be there for eachother and help eachother!"" You mean I, need to help YOU? Because all you can do is make me toast. And need my help. and ask me to take the dog out, and to clean up the dogs mess, and to get the dog, and to get my cats, and to clean my room, and to sweep the floors, and to clean up after my cats. You don't tell me to shower, you don't remind me to brush my teeth, you BARELY remind me to do my school, I don't even know anything about my school. at all. I have no idea whats going on. and I'm supposed to go to college! ""Make sure you're paying attention in school, you'll have to take an entrance exam for college!"" Wow, thanks dad. He's told me like, 4 times today to study for my FUCKING drivers exam. I have adhd with no medications. I've been studying right before I go to bed. I know all the signs, and mosstt of the laws? I think? IDFK. I just want to go to sleep. And I can't even do that! My dog always barks, and whines, and yells, anytime I get in bed. I've had him what, three days now? Maybe? I literally don't have the mental strength for this shit. I don't know how to train a dog. I don't know how to take care of my dad. I don't know how to do my school. I don't know how to pay attention. I don't know how to clean my room. I barely (don't) know how to drive. I barely know how to be a good friend, or person at that.

I can't hangout with my friends, I can't do my school, I can't even fucking take care of myself, all because I have to take care of my dog first. And my dad is sick?? I guess?? I guess that's stopping him from helping?? All he does is put the dog in the dog fence area outside, doesn't even put out the food and water. He waits for me to wake up and do it hours later.

1hie27c,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1hie27c,Another New Couple in Town!," Ok, yes, I got bored...so I gave my gay sim, Hayate Shimada (green shirt) a boyfriend, Shouta Ikeda. Please don't mind the obviously-unfinished house...I've been trying to save up simoleans so that I can get the island castle and finally move on to the next level üòÖ.

 Hayate works as a DJ, and is actually shy, compared to his boyfriend. Shy, and introverted (but loves/enjoys being a DJ). When it comes to dates, or being with a special someone in general, he lets Shouta take the lead because he has no idea what he's doing. Lol!

 Shouta is a scientist, and is the opposite of his boyfriend. He can be flirty, but ever since he first met Hayate, he's only ever really flirty with him, and adores him. He's also a sm*ker, but mainly to relax since his job can get a bit stressful, and he's bisexual. Dates with Hayate are always an adventure, and he falls harder for him, daily. And luckily, Hayate doesn't mind the sm*king, as long as Shouta is careful and doesn't ruin his health.

How they met: simply, by accident while getting coffee and ending up late for work (not that either of them complained). Shouta, being Shouta, offered to take Hayate out, sometime, and...well, they've been together since.

1hie1li,https://www.reddit.com/r/maraudersvent/comments/1hie1li/snapes_abuse/,Snape's abuse,"So, I am a Snape fan but even in this community I noticed certain differences in how we perceive Snape as and how we feel about him. I shall tell you about how I perceive him and feel about him, so you readers get a heads up before going down this post. I shall warn you beforehand that if you do not agree with me and still react, it is almost 10 to none percent of a chance that I will change my mind about how I think and feel about Snape.

In my eyes, Snape is a victim down to the marrow of his very bitter bones. In my eyes his whole life was miserable, made by other people around him that hated his existence simply for existing. I'm not saying all characters but his dad and James Potter. So if you don't think Snape is a thorough victim, then please be mindful that you chose to read this post yourself.

I shall start this piece by the top 10 signs of child abuse:

**Poor personal hygiene or scruffy/messy appearance.**  
One of the most common indicators that a child or vulnerable adult is being neglected is that they are consistently wearing dirty, scruffy, or otherwise unsuitable clothing. This can mean anything from clothing that has holes in, to clothes that don‚Äôt fit.

Similarly, if an individual is consistently unhygienic, this is also an indicator that their basic needs are being neglected. Smelling badly, having rashes or other skin conditions that might indicate poor hygiene, and having consistently unwashed or matted hair could all be signs of neglect.

**Bruising, scratches, marks, cuts, or burns in non-accidental injury sites.**  
A non-accidental injury site is an area of the body that would not normally be affected by an accidental injury, such as the tops of the arms or the neck. It‚Äôs common to fall off a bike and graze a knee for example, but if you notice bruising around the tops of an individual‚Äôs arms and they can‚Äôt give a reasonable explanation for why they have such marks, this could be a cause for concern.

You should be especially concerned if an individual has gone to lengths to avoid any marks, bruises, cuts, burns, or scratches from being noticed, or if their explanation does not seem consistent with the injury.

**Anxiety or extreme shyness around certain individuals.**  
Some people are naturally shy and display symptoms of anxiety around strangers, but you should pay close attention to any uncharacteristic displays of anxiety or shyness. This is especially true if an individual acts shy or anxious around someone they know, or someone they have previously had a normal relationship with.

Some of the signs of anxiety might include choosing not to speak or not being able to speak, acting restless, refusing to share personal information in the presence of other people, or showing extreme apprehension to be around certain individuals.

**Aggression**  
It isn‚Äôt normal for people to act aggressive without good reason, especially not in public places or if such behaviour is uncharacteristic of them. Unexplainable or unnecessary outbursts of aggression, whether this involves shouting and screaming or violence and rage, should be treated as a cause for concern.

**Sudden, unexplainable changes in attitude or behaviour.**  
We all get different mood swings within reason, but if you notice sudden, unexplainable changes in a person‚Äôs behaviour and they do not want to give a reason why, or if they simply refuse to acknowledge any change in their attitude, this could point to a cause for concern.This might involve a child who is normally quiet and well-behaved suddenly becoming loud, disobedient, and attention-seeking, or vice versa.

**Having a knowledge of inappropriate topics.**  
While it isn‚Äôt uncommon for children to know about sex and inappropriate adult topics, it is unusual for them to have an in-depth knowledge of such topics. This is especially the case if it seems as though the child is talking from personal or eye-witness experience.

Likewise, even for adults, there are some topics that are inappropriate, so if an individual starts to display an in-depth knowledge in support of radical or extremist views and beliefs, this could also be a sign of a safeguarding concern.

**Overtly sexual behaviour**  
In adults and children of all ages, it is not appropriate to display overtly sexual behaviour. This is especially true if individuals are trying to coerce other people into joining in with their behaviours, not appearing to realise the issue with their behaviour, or refusing to stop when they are asked to.

**Insecurities and choosing to cover up the body or certain parts of the body.**  
Many of us have insecurities about certain parts of our bodies, but some individuals might not feel comfortable exposing any part of their body or might have issues with a certain feature of their body, due to low self-esteem from emotional abuse, or insecurity stemming from physical or sexual abuse.

Similarly, hiding one area of the body consistently could be an attempt to conceal any injuries or scars related to abuse that an individual does not want anyone to ask questions about.

**Having a poor relationship with family members.**  
Family relationships can sometimes be strained for a variety of reasons, but you should pay close attention to those who have consistently bad relationships with their family members. Children who do not seem to have a bond with their parents should be a particular cause for concern.

Similarly, take note of individuals who always have a negative outlook on otherwise normal situations and continually place blame on one member of their family even though it might be clear to you that both parties are to blame, or that the accused person is innocent.

Family relationships can be tenuous things, but if you suspect the issue runs deeper than a single bad argument, this could be a sign of an abusive relationship.

**Depression and withdrawal, not enjoying activities.**  
We all get low moods sometimes, but it is not common for individuals to be depressed without a reason. For example, if a loved one dies and we are experiencing grief, this is a reason to justify why we might be feeling depressed.

However, if an individual seems consistently depressed and withdrawn, or if they stop enjoying activities they used to, this could indicate a number of different problems at home, and abuse should never be ruled out as one of these issues.

A verifiable safeguarding course can teach you all of the most common signs and indicators of abuse and neglect, including how to respond to concerns and the correct processes for reporting your safeguarding worries.

Alright, to the next bit of my long list of Snape's abuse. I love writing this by the way, in case others ask why I dive so deep in this. Anyway, moving on:

**Poor personal hygiene or scruffy/messy appearance.**

\- Snape is described as having greasy black hair, sallow skin (giving him a pale and unhealthy look), hooked nose, black cold eyes, yellow unkempt teeth, face in perpetual disdain, cold voice and commanding yet unsettling presence.

People see this as ugly but I (like many snape fans) see this as signs of abuse. Snape is a child of magic. He created spells, altered potions, he might as well be magic. Yet he states his father hates magic, his father hates him as well as James Potter that despised his existence. To a certain point of not being wanted, one won't go through the trouble of making  themselves look presentable. Most of his features basically needs care to be fixed.

Brushing teeth, eating vegetable to make his skin glow, wash his hair often, his nose won't be looking that BIG if his face was fuller so again, he needs to eat. Nor would he be thin if he ate enough food. Man basicall starves himself.

**Bruising, scratches, marks, cuts, or burns in non-accidental injury sites.**

\- Only thing I can add here is that spells had to be tested to see if they worked. Headcanon being that the spell that Snape created like Sectumsempra, ws teted on himself.

**Anxiety or extreme shyness around certain individuals.**

\- We see this perfectly described in ch33. Him hiding behind the bushed is shyness, he was even emberassed about his clothing but of course Petunia has to be the bigger brat and look down upon a younger boy through her tone. He's also anxious when he became defensive at the accusation of spying. In his house where he is a fault, he won settle for being blamed of doing something wrong outside as spying. His shyness only grew in his youth with Lily. Blushing every now and then.

**Aggression**

\- Snape shows that agession with the snark we so often come across. Whether it was the snarky comment against Petunia, James and Sirius on the train. Even in Hogwarts when he tries to put his foot down around Lily but she won't let him truly do that. I am hinting at the Mulciber conversation. His agression only grew and stayed, aiming it sadly at the children. I just want readers to know that other teachers were either worse or just as worse as Snape by the way.

**Sudden, unexplainable changes in attitude or behaviour.**

\- That would be two moments. Snape becomes more infected with purist ideas by his roommates (NOT FRIENDS) and another moment would be when he changed to the good side. He threw away all the trauma to simply ask Lily for the forgiveness by keeping her child safe. Those were moments he changed with a sudden rush of emotions. We all know why he changed for Lily but the heaped up anger he had within his own student years in Hogwarts is also a sudden rush of emotions. A genius like him crumbles under a sudden weight of emotions, only to be built up stronger than before.

**Having a knowledge of inappropriate topics.**

\- That would be Dark Arts. Which isn't as bad as people make it out to be. People talk about maybe 2 or 3 characters that went bad in the past, yet the Dark Arts existed for more than centuries. I am even surprised there wasn't a villain ever century, but sure. People will focuse on an amount that one can count on 1 hand than the bigger picture but whatever I guess. He created spells too. Sectumesempra for example had to be created for a dark (defensive) reason. It's not like it was created to walk someone's pet out in the park. He had a dark image, a goal and a cruel result he felt remorseful enough to sweep it under a rug. But that mind of his can go dark at certain moments when he is pushed in a corner. It then shows those inapropriate topics. He can't talk freel about this over some cup of coffee. Hence inappropriate.

**Overtly sexual behaviour**

\- Guy was virgin. That's it. Some people might sexualize this part but it isn't that deep honestly. He loved Lily, let her live her life, was an indirect cause of her death, felt guilty, and was busy playing a spy. That life of his has no space for war nor does that war allow him to be freely minded either. He wouldn't want to drag another person in his bitter life when the woman he appreciated got killed.

**Insecurities and choosing to cover up the body or certain parts of the body.**

\- He is completely covered up in black. Aside his face and hands, nothing else insvisible. If he weren't potions teacher, I bet he would even wear gloves. I don't know how Death Eater position could be affected if he worse something more colorful, it would work even in his favor if he tried to sweet talk his way to other students like many other teachers. But no. For a reason he keeps himself fully clothed and in black. Only other person that come close to being fully covered and wearing darker tones constantly is Minerva McGonagall and she's a widow.

Sure, people might say ""Oh, but he's a human. He can choose whatever color he wants"" No, not really. If one teaches children, they tend to be more cheerful. When I go teach my class of kids, I like to wear colorful for them. It makes me more friendlir and approachable as their teacher. That he deliberately choose Black, be standoffish from students to the point many hate him speaks on its own. He may not be insecure about his body, butabout himself perhaps. He was ridiculed for his body his whole youth after all.

**Having a poor relationship with family members.**

\- His dad, his mom, and no other family member ever exists in the poor kid's life.

**Depression and withdrawal, not enjoying activities.**

\- He does nothing else aside keeping people safe, aiding Dumbledore at his own expense and many other things at his own expense. He never did truly do something for himself. Not a vacation, party or activity to scooch in with. His life was basically one and all torment and all that negativity does have an everlasting effect on an adult. People that downplay this by saying ""Oh, but Harry was bullied but he didn't join DE"". I have many cursed things to say but I believe I'll be banned if I say it in this post. It's like these fans sometimes share half a braincel. That's it.",1,1734677179.0,maraudersvent,0,1.0,False

In this chapter's cover story, Hold'em gets a hold of Tama after beating Speed with the help of his SMILE-lion Kamijir≈ç (I think that was the name, but I'm going with my memory here, it might be wrong) and its fire-breathing capabilities and uses the girl as hostage to extort Yamato for her belongings.

Who? Who would have thought a couple of chapters ago that the cover story would turn out as the most interesting plotline of the arc??

The pattern continues and as Yamato reaches her next checkpoint, she finds some trouble. Now she only needs to meet another member of the 9 red scabbards before leaving to her next destination.

I find this part of the cover story hillarious for a lot of reasons. But before discussing them, there's something the appearance of Hold'em brings to the table and shouldn't be avoided: What happened with the Beast pirates after Kaid≈ç's defeat?

It was never told. Usually at the end of such an arc (Nation-wide power struggle the Mugiwara pirates help settle for one side or another. The most common kind of arc, I believe), there's a ""clean up"" step in the country and the losing faction is taken care of.

* Crocodile and his officers arrested by Marines.
* Eneru departs for the Moon and his priests are set to ""cloud drift"".
* Hody and his comrades are put in jail.
* Doflamingo and his crew also arrested by Marines.

But the Beast pirates were completely forgotten by the narrative and because of that, now that one of them comes back to the story, how should we interpret it?

1. Are the surviving Beast pirates (whoever they are) regrouping in Wano, getting ready to cause more trouble now that its saviors are gone because despite all the hatred, Wano's new ruling class left them completely unchecked???
2. Is Hold'em acting on his own as a lone escapee to the new Wano authority that dealt with all other Beast pirates appropriately even though we weren't told??

We can't know, but for now, I'll just assume it's option 2, because option 1 would be... Actually, option 1 would fit perfectly in the kind of writing One Piece has been getting this past decade, but I still refuse to lose hope.

Any way, by the looks of it, Speed was one-hit-KO'd not putting up a fight at all. Who let her join the Beast pirates and promoted her to Shin'uchi?? She's useless.

""No, Katakuri, don't be so harsh with poor Speed. She was surely ambushed by Hold'em.""

Well, the fact that Tama is not hurt indicates Hold'em took Tama before roasting Speed. So, her defeat can't be blamed on the surprise element. But even if she actually had been ambushed, then what good is her 350¬∫-wide panoramic vision she used to boast about if she's not going to notice being ambushed??

And what was Yamato doing exactly during all that? I mean, look at ther. She looks helpless! WTH?? She was strong and resolute during the Wano arc. Why is she panicking now as Chopper in front of any unexpected event??

And what about Hold'em? Every other outlaw in Wano took the smart decision not to confront Yamato. Let's be real. She's in all likeliness the strongest individual in the whole country right now and very well-known by everyone in it. And yet Hold'em decided to pick a fight with her.

Even in the case he ambushed Speed, he still ambushed Speed rather than Yamato. Why??? But that isn't everything. He's asking for their belongings, as though they would carry much of worth. We don't know whether he's trying to find an escape out of Wano or has adopted the life of a bandit there, but in any case, what is he expecting to steal from Yamato??

Hold'em, better than anyone, should know he already has the most valuable good in his hands. He had already kidnapped Tama once in order to use her to tame animals. Why is he using Tama as a hostage now and not as the thing to grab and run??

Everything is so silly here and then there's also Komachiyo's disappearance. He is not in the picture now. Conveniently erased from the action. But I found an explanation to all of this. Don't get your hopes up, it's not a good explanation as the scene won't make any more sense, but it's an explanation nonetheless:

With this cover, Oda wanted to make a homage to the Wizard of Oz. So, in the picture there are the four protagonists of the story:

* Speed represents the cowardly lion. We know she withstood Kaid≈ç's attack before and still had strength to run back to Bakura for plot convenience. But now, she's frozen in the ground unable to help Tama. She needs courage just like the cowardly lion.
* Hold'em represents the scarecrow. He should know way better, and yet he's making every wrong decision he can (in a single panel). As the scarecrow, a brain would do well to him.
* Yamato represents the tin man. She's just there doing literally nothing. It''s her friends and companions, who went on a quest to help her, who have been attacked and yet Yamato can't find an ounce of empathy within her to help them back. She clearly needs a heart that lets her have feelings just as the tin man.
* Finally, Tama represents Dorothy. She's been literally and figuratively taken away from her homeland (Kuri to Udon) by riding in Speed's back, being involved in Yamato's adventure and held hostage by Hold'em, and needs to find the way back. Just like Dorothy who was taken from Kansas to Munchkinland by a tornado.

[Ch. 1133 p2, p3 & p4](https://preview.redd.it/usvhcnj04y7e1.jpg?width=3345&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=43be12ffe7f622a9eeaa02184ca30cfc2584b23a)

The chapter starts with these three pages that are basically a repeated flashback. Save for Spandine talking to the journalists and Robin drawing Ohara in the map, two things that are completely irrelevant for the story, everything in the flashback we already knew.

Robin had it very rough in her childhood because the government demonized her and offered good money for her head. She could never rest or feel safe and everyone turned on her to earn her bounty. Not a single new relevant detail.

If a couple of chapters back we had a panel to remind us of who Hajrudin is, then now we got three whole pages to let us know who one of the protagonists is, because obviously we don't know the protagonists of the story.

Any way, let's talk about those two things.Why is Spandine reporting to the journalists? Telling them a sob story. I mean, How bad in the head should the whole world be if they read on the newspapers ""Marines raze a whole island to the ground because there were some criminals living there and an 8-year-old criminal sinks the evacuation ship for the people who just lost it all in the Marines' bombing"" and their concern is with the 8-year-old criminal???

Spandine isn't blaming Robin for what happened to Ohara. He's admitting a Buster Call was conducted in the island. He's blaming Robin for the sunken ships alone. It's ridiculous.

But even more ridiculous than that it's the fact that of all people, Spandine is the one speaking to journalists. Who is he identifying as???

World Economic Journal:

>""Director Spandine, head of the supersecret government agency of elite spies and assassins, now not-so-secret-anymore and not-known-until-now as Cipher Pol 9, reported that a child by the name of Nico Robin escaped them during the Buster Call that leveled the island of Ohara.""

He's supposed to remain unknown and specially not related with the World Government in any way. What is this joke?

Also, why would the island itself be removed from maps?? What's the point? The island still exists, it's just the settlement that doesn't. I'm sure merchants and anyone sailing a ship would like to know there's an island there so that they don't stumble upon it, think they reached somewhere else and start doubting their course and conequently sailing based on false information messing their whole travel.

What about all the maps of West Blue that already existed? They they go house by house throughout the world taking them?

What's the problem with people knowing there is an island there? It's not like they've put a secret laboratory like in Punk Hazard or Egghead, it's just a deserted island now, so why?? The only thing they're accomplishing with that is creating a perfect haven for pirates to hide in a place the world think doesn't exist.

Furthermore, didn't Spandine just report to the news about the whole incident in Ohara??? Who's in charge of the strategy?? Is it Sengoku? Is it a gorosei?? Either tell the world about Ohara, or make them believe it doesn't exist, but you can't go both ways! XD

Summarizing: Inside a repeated flashback that brings no relevant information, there's still two new things that would be nothing but an embelishment that make no sense by themselves and even less when combined.

[Ch. 1133 p5](https://preview.redd.it/9e1tyix54y7e1.png?width=1108&format=png&auto=webp&s=58ab0b85ea857e71d660a87a0c452371dc16d24a)

""The island is massive!"" sure. Just look at the rainbow's width arriving at the port and also in the same picture with the whole island.

The Great Erik arrives at a small dock, ""Western village port"", and lies on sea clouds, ""of course"". Some giants are there to greet them while worried by their lateness.

The name of the port confuses me a bit. I don't think it means ""the port of the Western village"" because the other Mugiwara pirates are there too and they were at Elbaf village not a different one named ""Western"". But then it should mean ""the one port in the village that's to the west"", implying that there is more than one port: one to the west and at least one other somewhere else. But why would a small village located on the tree-tops need more than one port? A single port is already quite a stretch, if you ask me. Especially considering how during the previous arc, the Giant warrior pirates along with Shanks were hanging out at the ""land of the dead"". Why didn't they invite Shanks' crew over to their village if they're good friends? What would have they done had they needed to set sail immediately? Hike the mountains across the whole island, climb the tree and get to the port at the edge of the tree-tops to get to their ship?

Anyway, I don't know who wrote that ""of course"", Oda or the translator, but whoever it was... It makes no sense. It couldn't possibly be obvious under no circumstance that there would be sea clouds between the branches and leaves of the Adam tree. Those are only supposed to be so up in the sky not there. Also, we can see mountain-wide waterfalls coming out of the leaves. Actual water, not sea clouds. If anything, actual rivers should be expected up there and not sea clouds.

I get why those giants were worried by the pirates' lateness. It took them a really short time to go from Elbaf to Egghead (they read newspapers about Luffy as soon as morning, got to Egghead during the same daytime and left and partied before dusk. However the way back took them more than 2 full days. They were truly late. For no logical reason. However, wouldn't it be more reasonable to wait for them at the shores of the island where they'd be able to see them coming? For all they know, the pirates could have been partying at the bar at the shore for two days. So, either they weren't that much worried or they're very dumb.

[Ch. 1133 p6\_7](https://preview.redd.it/jcrckfx84y7e1.png?width=2203&format=png&auto=webp&s=8e31cc8931aad939b38ee0e1b5b56f5323bc4554)

More panels of Mugiwara pirates amazed at everything they see. Gerd and Goldberg fly on a small boat that floats because it has island clouds at the tip of the rows. They land at the port and meet with Hajrudin, Stansen and Rodo.

I really don't know what else to say. A flying boat. Just like that. Because it has a small line of island cloud... ¬øsomehow glued? to the oars. Imagine Pagaya's face if he could see this. A sky engineer like him and the expertise of every other engineer in Skypiea ever humiliated by some giant barbarians that don't even know what the rainbows in their homeland are. Years of designing and building by Eneru and a lot of workers to make a ship that could fly powered by Eneru's electricity and hundreds of dials, when all they needed to do was put some island cloud on a stick. Easy peasy. How did that never occurred to them?

There's one good thing to this flying boat, though.

https://preview.redd.it/ui5dkxs25y7e1.png?width=791&format=png&auto=webp&s=2dfa85d893ba2a91df66d60210f111650575e92e

It's just a small boat and this will never surely never again be found on a big ship, but to see Oda remembers triangular sails exist after... I don't know, 20 years? When was the last time a ship had triangular sails? Arlong's ship?

And look! At the cliff, there's some kind of hidden building that goes underground. These spaces already appeared last chapter. I wonder if that's going to be explored or it's just a random detail.

And... Wait. If Goldberg has the Sunny in his hands and Gerd has the other Mugiwara pirates in hers (you can see one of her elbows bent towards her knees), who is rowing the boat?? Is there a cloud monster inside rowing those six oars for them too???

More Bonney and Lilith shoehorned page after page. This time Lilith is even used to show amzement at ""all the technology"" at Elbaf. But let me tell you one thing, Lilith, it's only TECHNology if someone developed a TECHNique to create it. Rainbows, clouds and ¬øbubbles? aren't technology just because they exist. And why is she amazed? Elbaf is the closest island to Egghead. Didn't Vegapunk know about his neighbours?? By the way, where are the bubbles Lilith speaks about? Don't tell me she's amazed at something she already knew from before??

And then there's that guy in the bottom right panel shouting ""The climate here is perfect for all this!!"" He's like super thrilled as well. WTF?? You live there. You see that every day. Why are you shouting like your pop idol just came out from behind a curtain?? This is Oda doing exactly this to his own manga:

https://preview.redd.it/2mqlke165y7e1.jpg?width=600&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=301bd7878979cc552358d73d08316249a248bbf6

But the scene makes no sense at all! Last chapter Gerd had already arrived at the village with the others. Why are they now flying to the village? Or to another part of the village? Why aren't they just walking? They walked all the way from below the tree-tops, they walked all the way to the village and now they're taking a flying boat to move through the village?? Where did they take that boat from??

And look!! There's the 5 of them now! Hajrudin and Stansen who arrived by the rainbow, Gerd and Goldberg we just saw in the flying boat and... RODO!! He's here. Crucified even!! But BY WHO??? Who the hell crucified Rodo and brought him here??? He was left beaten at the forest. Goldberg couldn't bring him because he's carrying the Sunny. Gerd didn't either. He's not even at the flying boat. HOW DID HE GOT HERE?? It's nonsense!

And... I'm sorry, but I can't help it, look at Hajrudin! Please, stand up, do the same pose he's doing, with his knees and ankles bent, his torso leaning ot his back, and now tell me why would anyone stand like that?

[Ch. 1133 p8\_9](https://preview.redd.it/fegggj1b4y7e1.png?width=2196&format=png&auto=webp&s=d7ea3aa49a0c98e7aaa5e981ff7be4d3d40dd828)

Hajrudin and Gerd tell about how Big Mom's defeat was received in Elbaf. Someone amoing Luffy, Zoro, Nami and Usopp is surprised. The whole village seems to be looking forward for a great feast, but Robin wants to go meet Saul right away and the others go with her. Gerd takes them to the school. Robin doesn't want to bother anyone, but Luffy insists and the giants are so understanding they hold up the feast.

So, why would anyone of those four be surprised about Big Mom being defeated??

We can see the big unnecessary stone gates in the top-left corner of the big panel. So they were in the village of Elbaf after all. So what's that about Gerd and Goldberg coming in with the flying ship??? Gerd was already there by foot last chapter!

Goldberg's shield is asleep for now. I wonder if it's supposed to be a homie. A present, maybe from Big Mom at some point or Mother Carmel even?

There's among the crowd a kind of cloaked shady guy at the bottom-left. But maybe she's just a regular citizen and I'm simply aching for some plot.

There's a bear too. Is it an actual animal or a statue? Difficult to know, but I guess it's just a statue. The other animals in the below level were much bigger than giants.

The narrator clarifies now, that it wasn't the Western port, it's the Western village and with this I've had ENOUGH. Look, Oda, make up your damned mind already! For most of the manga, the name ""Elbaf"" referred to a village somewhere in the New World. ""Elbaf mura"" („Ç®„É´„Éê„ÉïÊùë) in japanese to be more precise. It means exactly ""Elbaf village"" and this is the way Dorry and Brogy referred to it. At some point the word ""Elbaf"" alone, without saying village or anything else, was also used. I believe it was during Big Mom's flashback, quite recently, that the concept of ""Warland"" was introduced. To me, it looked like an epithet, you know? Like ""Little Garden, land of the giants"", ""Elbaf, Warland"" or ""land of war"", but it's okay if it already meant that ""Elbaf"" was somewhere in a place by the name of ""Warland"", a village in an island, even though that wasn't specified either.

Some chapters ago, we were told the island is named Warland while the country is named Elbaf and that's... okay I think, despite it's pretty weird to tell someone about your village rather than your country when that someone doesn't know of your country or where your village is and even more so if your country and your village share the same name. But, whatever. As long as things were consistent, I didn't complain. There's a village by the name of Elbaf inside a country by the same name in an island named Warland. Cool. But now, now, it turns out Dorry and Brogy's village is not Elbaf. It's the ""Western village"". WHY? What reason is there to create an inconsistency like this out of the blue??? Everything would have worked as fine if the name of the village had remained Elbaf. What's the point of this?? Why no editor asked him about this? ""Hey! How come the village is not called Elbaf any more? Did you forget it was the name of the village? No problem, it's normal for this to happen every now and then, let's just fix it. I know because as the editor of this manga it's my job to know this inside out and notice theese things to be there for the author if he accidentally slips"". But no.

Gerd takes the Mugiwara in the flying boat. I still don't get how that's supposed to work. It's one thing to suspend disbelief to accept there can be a house atop a colossal cloud the size of a county. And it's a completely different thing to accept a tiny thread of cloud supports a whole boat, cargo and passengers and moves them through the sky. Also, even if we take levitation for granted just because, imagine the amount of rowing that'd be needed for the boat to move a little.

You see? How much rowing is required for the boat to move depends on the rate between the boat's mass (plus cargo, passengers, whatever) and the mass of the water the oar moves. In water, the amount of water an oar can move weighs way less than the boat and so you have to row quite a bit to get some movement. If the boat moved through thick mud, a lot less rowing would be needed for the boat to move (every stroke of the oar would require much more force, though). If the boat sails through air, which is not only a lot lighter but also way more ineficcient to move with an oar, you could be rowing all day at full speed and get nothing.

In fact, it should be as difficult as trying to use the oars as a bird's wings to take off. The clouds should only be helping (and that's already a lot of credit to them) to not fall. But the lift would be entirely on you. That is not possible with a pair of oars even if it's just one person trying, imagine a whole boat! Back in Skypiea Oda knew of this and he provided with dials to act as propellers for this very reason.

On another topic, the bit about Luffy saying he has to greet Saul I think it's a call back to how Ace also wanted (and did) meet with Shanks after becoming a pirate and thanked him for having taken care of Luffy.

However, this little (or not so little, we don't know yet) detour is the most anti-climatic and mood-killer development ever. The giants of the village are all very fired-up to feast for their ""leaders"" return and suddenly they have to not have their party because some foreigners want to run some errands first. And we and them (the giants) we'll surely have to pretend later that this never happened and that we can pick up exactly were they left off now as if nothing happened. Right? So... What do you think Dorry, Broggy, Hajrudin, etc are doing now? Sitting at the tavern, with all that food getting cold but not taking a bite, looking at some magic wristwatch they might have wondering when will Luffy come back. Getting bored, reflecting about life in silence as they try to pretend time's just stopped by now, slowly realizing it's not, thinking how are they going to shout and laugh and cheer later as they eat and drink with the same enthusiasm they would have done right about now if their mood has been murdered by the author, pondering whether they'll just fake it or be honest with the Mugiwara upon their return and tell them to eat in quiet as the party's been called off because no one feels like it anymore.

You know what? Actually, I'd be a lot more interested in reading what's going on in that tavern right now than what's coming in the next pages.

[Ch. 1133 p10](https://preview.redd.it/9c6dtn8d4y7e1.png?width=1096&format=png&auto=webp&s=28bf0535f1efff1af4ebac627495b4646df3de0c)

Gerd and the Mugiwara finally arrive at ""Warrior's springs"" where the Owl library is. It's a beautiful lake under a giant branch of the Adam tree with a beach made of... ¬øbark? Luffy impulsively tries to go first and meet Saul, but Nami stops him to let Robin meet with his friend first.

A page ago we were told Saul was at the library so Gerd was taking the Mugiwara to the school. It follows logically that Saul's in the school's library. Specially considering this very page Gerd explains to Usopp that giants study too. Hence the school. But then we arrive and there's no school. The building's named ""Owl library"". So, either, the library is a separate building that's not actually the school, or there's no school and giants study at the library. Or maybe they don't study anymore as of this page... Also, about the waterfall, where does all that water come from?

You know what?  IT'S FINE. I don't care. There's a beach because small bits of bark are acting like sand and there are waves because the waterfall obviously creates them. And that is the most and best explained things we've had for 200 chapters, easily. So, even if some things are still lacking, when I read this I just want to cry HALLELUJAH!

None of this changes the fact the last panel of the page is one of the ugliest ever.

[Ch. 1133 p11 & Ch. 1131 p17](https://preview.redd.it/dqimq6pg4y7e1.jpg?width=2207&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=d21a2a02c33d734073529dbbc6743b01ec743338)

A giant woman heads for the protagonists hurrying to tell them Saul fell annd Luffy, Sanji, Chopper and Usopp get all worked up over it, even complaining about it. But the giant points at Saul and Robin says it's alright and goes to Saul alone.

This is nuts! This already happened two chapters ago when Robin wasn't even on the island. How is this possible??

I'm going to ignore things like how did they know when exactly was Robin coming? how could Saul not be seen from up above before the flying boat landed? or how did the giant woman know she had to call for help specifically to them? This is clearly a set up to mimic the way Robin and Saul first met and we must believe that woman was simply in cahoots with Saul. Okay, but why is he doing this to begin with??? I mean, would you do this?

Imagine you have a long-lost friend, someone very dear to you, someone to whom you are a parent figure in some way, and you think or at least you hope that someone is being brought to your town by other people you're acquainted with in a rescue mission. They're not preparing a reunion for you. No one's leading her into a big surprise. In fact, she might not know about you being alive or there to begin with and certainly you read in the newspapersabout her more than likely escape from a very dangerous situation but can't possibly know whether she's alive or even in a good condition. She might be severely wounded for all you know.

Would you wait secluded in a naturally hidden place for her to find you or someone to take her to you waiting for the time to enact this theatre play? Isn't this the most retarded decision making we've read here in the last... Who cares? No, it's probably not. We've had a lot of shit, now that I think about. This might be just average.

Luffy, Sanji, Chopper and Usopp's panel too. That is just a theatrical reaction. Not what they'd normally do. Or at least I hope that's not what they'd normally do. It's definitely not what they used to do. When Cricket collapsed in front of them after attacking them, they genuinely cared for him immediately even though he was no one to them. So, every character is acting by the wisdom of plot convenience to fit this scene Oda thought would be nice to have, for some reason.

And I wonder, was this Oda's intention from the beginning? (Not the actual beginning, but like from the beginning of the arc at least) Or is this the only way he's come up with to save some face after writing Saul's fall as a cliff-hanger two chapters ago and then realizing wherever he wanted to go with that it was a very bad idea and that he had to reroute it? Because this is the only explanation I can think of for this second fall of Saul.

After 1331 Saul had fallen. Not in the same way he did this chapter. He could not possibly be enacting this weird way to meet Robin again and have the girl cry for help to... no one. Oda could have just done as though the ending of two chapters ago never existed and had Saul reappear in the story in a more logical way. After all, he's already retcon'd the whole village of Elbaf, he retcon'd Saul's death even... surely he could retcon that little bit too, right? No. It occurred to him that wasting a whole chapter reminiscing of a flashback that was already told just for the sake of it was an amazing idea.

[Ch. 1133 p12 & p13; Ch. 392 p8, p9 & p10](https://preview.redd.it/cgazbekm4y7e1.jpg?width=2400&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=a37bb6057377955691240964b43626c44b1565f5)

For these two pages, Robin and Saul just see each other. There's not much to comment about them. So I threw in some pages from ch. 392 that Oda replicated here in order to re-enact that scene. Please feast your eyes in the beautiful drawing of the past.

If anything, I find it curious that he replicated it even to use the same sound effects in the same place: the ""za za..."" above Saul in the top panel for the waves in the shore or the breeze maybe, I don't know much about japanese onomatopoeia \^\^"", the ""ooooo"" under Saul in the bottom panel for the scare, but he changed the ""tatata..."" I believe it's for Robin walking on the sand, to ""suta suta..."". Maybe that is because despite he's drawing it to be visually the same, Robin is now not walking on true sand but on tree bark? So it sounds differently. If that's the case, then this is a very nice detail. One I imagine most people wouldn't ever notice nor care. But it's the kind of things I enjoy.

[Ch. 1133 p14 & p15](https://preview.redd.it/071c44fr4y7e1.jpg?width=2208&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=5416d720e77d1f43d695364a614fc68c8fe59709)

They start talking, we see Saul lost a leg and the reminiscing of the flashback we already knows continues with the breif addition of how Saul survived.

And here I thought Oda wanted to create this scene to give Robin and Saul a beautiful moment in some way, but turns out this was just an excuse to whitewash Vegapunk, bolster the importance of the previous arc and Vegapunk's speech specifically and try to justify Saul's retcon'd death. The audacity!

So, let's talk about this because I won't stand for this bullshit.

Robin and Saul finally reunite with one another and the first thing they speak about are trivial matters?? ""Hey, did you hear Vegapunk's speech the other day? It was so interesting, huh? Oh, he sure passed down Ohara's message"". HELL NO! Last time they saw each other, Robin saw Saul be frozen to death and Saul saw Robin be completely alone and vulnerable in the middle of a Buster Call to target her with a Marine Admiral next to her. So, how about something more like this:

""Oh my god, Saul, you really are alive!! I'VE MISSED YOU SO SO MUCH!""

""I've missed you too, Robin! I'm so sorry I couldn't help you back then. I can only imagine how horrible all these years have been for you. But... how did you get out of Ohara alive??""

And after they've cried of joy, hugged till their arms are numb and talked about everything that's truly important and relevant, then a week later MAYBE they can look at the camera and start sucking Vegapunk's dick, figuratively speaking. But not the first thing they do.

And if Oda doesn't want to bore us with an emotionall scene where we can see Robin is a human being and has feelings, that's okay. All of us accepted long ago that Robin would never again have any meaningful interaction with her friends, because otherwise she would have said and explained so so many things that she didn't for the sake of plot convenience. But don't use her like this either. Do not rape her character to blow your own dick and validate the mess that was the previous arc and Vegapunk's inconsequential speech. This is disgusting and shameful.

And now let's talk about Saul's retcon. Because this is as much an explanation as we're going to get so now we're not guessing, supposing or speculating any more. It's time to pass judgement to this.

In some way, what Oda did here is kind of clever. Saul melting because of the heat of the fire, thus reverting back to life before being truly dead is not just a possible outcome, in all likeliness that is exactly what happened. So, he's telling us a truth to justify the retcon, and because it's a truth suddenly you may even be convinced that there was no retcon and Saul really never die and there was nothing to complain about in the first place!

Oda is making great use here of what he chooses to show us and what he chooses to hide from us. In fact, there's already a detail that tells us he's not being completely honest and is making shit up: Saul says he woke up in the sea. Melting because of the heat is one thing, but being magically transported to sea it's a different thing. Yes, Saul should have melted by the heat and immediately after he should have also burn to death if he was unconscious, or alternatively he should wake up right there where he was frozen and get away from the fire willingly.

But what Oda is not telling us so that we focus in the sole thing that makes sense, is that after waking up, even if he did so in the sea, the Buster Call should still be ongoing. Marines should be roaming the island looking for possible survivors or more documents to destroy. Specifically, Aokiji should be very aware that his ice could melt and surely after seeing Robin off, he would have returned to Saul to check whether he was truly dead or was precisely melting. I mean, Aokiji said Saul was his best friend (or a very good friend at least), without better things to do and surely not feeling like arguing with Akainu about destroying the evacuation ship, he would return to his friend to confirm whether he had killed him or not. Otherwise, how is Saul supposed to have left Ohara alive? Or at least have survived there until the Marines left. It's impossible. It makes no sense.

Moreover,

[Ch. 433 p17](https://preview.redd.it/ibnwvtyu4y7e1.png?width=1066&format=png&auto=webp&s=3ed33874f389d13d76967031b15645235ea57fe3)

In chapter 433, Aokiji clearly speaks about Saul as a dead person. I wonder if he did it explicitly even, because in the original text of the last panel of this page, Aokiji doesn't say exactly what it says in this translation, but he speaks about having a duty after <someone's> life. This might be an explicit reference to Saul being alive no more, or he could be referencing having to watch over Robin's life. It's not clear to me. Partly because my japanese knowledge is super limited, but partly too because japanese can be spoken in a very criptic way as though you were being revealed a mystical prophecy by an oracle in riddle form and for japanese-speakers that's just tuesday. Regardless, Aokiji spoke here at all moments as though Saul were dead. Specially when he says that now Saul isn't there, the duty to watch over Aokiji befalls on him. That's not something you take responsibility for, specially in fiction stories, unless the one who had that responsability has died.

[Ch. 1133 p16 & p17](https://preview.redd.it/81pssdlx6y7e1.jpg?width=2195&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=69aa96508754ea8f46fe7ad261826514712db386)

Robin makes Saul notice that, despite everything in her life was terrible, she ultimately followed Saul's advice: she stayed alive and found some friends. She also asks for praise, Saul praises her and both cry.

Actually, the bit about finding friends isn't true, though I think it should be. These two pages annoy me. A lot. And I'm aware of what I just said about the previous two, but believe me, these two are even worse.

I get what Oda is trying to do here by showing Robin in this light: vulnerable, lowering her emotional defenses, regessing to a childlike state, seeking validation... He's trying to give some depth to the character, to humanize her a bit. And I really appreciate it but... this comes late and it's wrong and poorly executed.

First of all, Oda wouldn't have the need to do this if he hadn't murdered Robin's character before. Robin already had a character pre-time skip. Only to come back from it almost entirely devoid of such a feature. Her whole character was replaced with an emotionally ice-cold mannequin with a twisted and morbid sense of humor. Something she wasn't before, I might add.

But most important of all, because these tears, this overcoming the pain and this realization of her success in doing what Saul asked her belong to this moment:

[Ch. 398 p17 & p18](https://preview.redd.it/h6otqyp07y7e1.jpg?width=1570&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=c64adb2170f688a763cdc2685d212838b67ecb14)

and to this moment alone. That is one of the most cathartic moments in the whole manga serving as an inflection point to one of the most loved arcs. The moment Luffy declares war on the world government JUST so that Robin can speak freely without fear for them. Luffy (and the rest) raided Enies Lobby just to hear it directly from her words. Whether she was truly okay with her situation or not. And if she was, then that's okay, but is she wasn't they'd move heaven and earth to rescue her. And that's when she realizes she's found the friends Saul told her she would eventually find and it's only then that she's able to move on.

And now, two years of in-story time later, out of the blue we get this re-enactment of that realization, completely unprompted, unrequired by the situation, in a situation of absolute lack not just of epicness or narrative tension, but anything actually, there's literally nothing going on. Even the faintest shred of a plot we were having that's having a big feast with the giants was abruptly interrupted like an advertisment in the middle of a movie to have this moment rehashing one of One Piece's ""greatest hits"" in a graceless way, while using it as an excuse to justify a retcon and exalt a previous fiasco just for the sake of... I don't know. Giving the chapter a highlight, maybe?

I find this insulting towards Oda's own past work and can't begin to express how terrible it feels to me. My mind is blown by the comparison. Just thinking about what we had and what we're getting nowadays.

But, hey! The retcon is real, this encounter between Robin and Saul is happening and to me that begs for at least one question. Let's see... Turns out Saul lived and escaped (with lots of books of Ohara's scholars even!). The Marines reaction to Saul's giant body being nowhere to be found was:

Marine high-ranking officer 1: ""The body of giant Jaguar D. Saul, who was charged with treason and collusion with Ohara's scholars can't be found. Do we declare him missing in action and issue a bounty for him?""

Marine high-ranking officer 2: ""Better not. Let's just assume he's dead and move on. I'm tired of this shit.""

So, after that, Saul was effectively one of the freest people in the world thanks to the World Government not giving a shit about him. And now he claims to have missed Robin so much. He cries a lot too. But the facts are:

\- He didn't go to see her arrive to Elbaf even though he knew she would.

\- He didn't go with the other giants to help her at Egghead, even though he knew she was in such danger.

\- He, for 22 long years has read newspapers with news of Robin suffering hell on earth every single day of her life and did NOTHING.

He stayed comfortably hidden in Elbaf, reading those newspapers with a hot coffee in his hand saying to himself ""I should help Robin, that poor little girl I love and care so much for. Maybe once I'm done reading all these books I saved from Ohara. Oh look! There's still a heap of them left. It's too bad... They're so tiny I can barely read anything at all, I have to really force my eyesight. Well maybe in 50 years or so I'll be done. Then I'll do something about Robin. She deserves to be happy. :) ""

All he had to do was get a hair cut, put on different clothes and look for her under the safety that no one is actively looking for him and he's basically dead to the world. Donquixote Dofla'emon, one of my favourite characters post-time skip is a living proof that a little costume works wonders in this world. So it shouldn't have been a big deal. But no. Saul did nothing. And if I were Nico Robin, rather than looking for praise from him I'll be expecting a very thorough and convincing apology from him. Because Saul spoke to her about some wonderful friends she'd make in life, but in this retcon'd reality he was surely not one of them.

Finally, to end this review that turned out way longer than I wanted it to be, I want to discuss something less dramatic if possible.

[Ch. 1133, clockwise from top-left: p10, p14, p16, p17 & p13](https://preview.redd.it/mfxdow647y7e1.jpg?width=1885&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=7784c044dc24582184bea34719326add40051e7b)

As you can see, we first had a very beautiful picture of this place with a library sitting in a huge branch above the lake surrounded by more branches/ground and other buildings. But then EVERYTHING was erased because Oda wanted to draw panels identical to the ones in chapter 392. After that... Well, you see that behind Saul and to his right, sometimes there is something, sometimes there isn't, but never again the library, the huge branch above nor the waterfalls we were specifically talked about. Now it's not just Nami's sword that goes missing from panel to panel (it still does), entire landscapes appear and disappear.

At least Lilithh and Bonney don't appear in last panel. It's something I suppose.

Safe for work mental health tangent: 

I must preface this by saying that I am very much safe and in a sound state of mind right now. I posted this because stuffed animals help me emotionally regulate when the human world overwhelms me. Sometimes, formidable waves of anger, defiance, regret, or guilt knock me off my feet. The defeat fills me with an urge to lash out, burn bridges, or isolate myself from the outside world‚Ä¶ but instead, I seek comfort from my fuzzy, little buddies. Admiring their permanently etched smiles reels me back to the land of sanity and reason. I recognize my stuffed animals might not be ‚Äúreal,‚Äù but they are an externalization of my introspective coping mechanisms, e.g. an everlasting optimism with the strength to weather my psychological storms.

I didn't mean to snarl. Snarling meant I was slowly becoming exactly what they wanted. But when Kaz Delacroix strode into Bolivia House‚Äôs basement carrying a metal tray with my mediocre 'lunch', I couldn't resist playing into their game. 

My head snapped up, an animalistic hiss escaped my mouth, drool seeping down my chin. It was becoming progressively harder to stay human, when my surroundings were akin to a dungeon.

Fuck, I was so hungry. 

Thinking about Nin‚Äîabout her malleable flesh that was so salty and yet sweet‚Äîwas fucking with my head. 

I needed to eat, but my body was rejecting everything ‚Äì even Nin. 

According to the moon freaks, the more I refused to accept their position as king, the less likely my body was going to survive. The chains wrapped around my wrists and ankles were cruel. 

In the cult‚Äôs anticipation of my transformation, I had been stripped of my clothes, leaving me shivering in my boxer shorts, forced onto my hands and knees. I was hot, then cold‚Äîboiling, then freezing to death‚Äîcaught between my humanity and whatever was running rampant in my blood. 

I was also trying really hard not to think about the custom-made crown on my head, melded to my skull. 

The cult woman, who introduced herself as Isadora, promised I would be re-educated into a perfect, merciless King who would rule the town.

I asked her why Bolivia House residents were being targeted, and that's how I ended up in chains. I was strapped to a surgical bed, for what I guessed was a moon lobotomy, but apparently, asking too many questions was cause for removing my clothes and chaining me to the wall. 

The person I least expected to be the one to perform my mental reconditioning was my best fucking friend. 

I didn't realize how truly weak I was until I tried to get up, tried to lunge at Kaz, who loomed over me, only to flop onto my stomach, my head spinning, my body contorting, moving, under my skin. 

It started a few days ago‚Äì when I woke up after Kaz killed me. Somehow, the bones in my body were moving, coming apart and snapping into place, writhing around like fucking puzzle pieces. 

I managed to control it through sheer will, squeezing my eyes shut and clinging onto the people who mattered the most, ignoring my unraveling thoughts. 

The moon was already there, picking away at my skull, ready to fill my brain and intoxicate my thoughts. 

So, I blocked her out. I was under the slightly childish assumption that, ‚ÄúIf I cannot see it, then it can't hurt me.‚Äù

Unfortunately, I couldn‚Äôt keep my composure when my roommate knelt in front of me, cradling my cheeks. For a fleeting moment, I believed he cared, believed he might actually break me out. 

But then I saw his eyes filled with her, polluted and bright and drowning his pupils. Imogen once told me we were beautiful, and I think I believed her. 

She was coping with her physical transformation, trying to kid herself into believing that we were not monsters. 

But Imogen was right. The pale light dancing in my iris and transforming my face into a grotesque thing of beauty was something I could hold onto. But Kaz? Fuck. I found myself intoxicated by that light in his eyes, every full moon. 

I really tried to accept that this version of my best friend was beautiful too.

But now, I was just staring at a hollowed-out corpse still bleeding moonlight. 

It wasn‚Äôt just his eyes. Kaz‚Äôs face had begun to contort, caught in some freaky transition between human and something else. I could see the feral parts of him, the monstrous parts igniting in his bones. 

The way he crouched, primed on his toes, head inclined, like a wild animal assessing its meal. It was still him, and yet bathed in that intense light filtering through the skylight, I couldn't call him human. 

When he tipped his head back, tendrils of moonlight creeping across the whites of his eyes and spider webbing under his skin sent my own body shuffling back, jerking against his iron grip around my face. This is what we were, I thought dizzily. What Nin saw when she looked at us. Except back then, I could still delude myself into believing I was human. 

Kaz made me realize I wasn't. Perched in front of me, a child's skull resting on his head of curls, beads of red running down his moonlit skin, Kaz Delacroix was no longer human. When his lips pulled back into a grin, I glimpsed incisors, sharp and unnaturally long, extending from his gums.

‚ÄúYou've gotta be fucking kidding me.‚Äù
 
I couldn‚Äôt resist a laugh, which sputtered into a cough. 

I spat blood, and his hands glided across my face, gentle fingers caressing my cheeks. When I was a kid‚Äîor rather, when I was eighteen and discovering myself‚ÄîI fell for the asshole from the second I met him. 

Maybe not in the way you would think at first. I firmly believed that soulmates existed. Freshman year, I was the frat boy standing on one leg in the pouring rain for my hazing ritual. 

Eighteen-year-old Kaz Delacroix walked past me, his eyes glued to his phone, thick reddish curls poking out from under his hood. I asked him for water. It was kind of an inside joke with the frat guys; we asked passersby for water, and then hurled insults at them when these kids refused. 

After an uncomfortable silence, he paused, walked over to me, and handed me his half empty bottle of orange soda. 

He barely even looked me in the eye, shoving it in my face, muttering, ‚ÄúKeep it.‚Äù

I snatched the bottle. ‚ÄùI said water.‚Äù I snapped, downing the whole thing. 

‚ÄúSoda is all I've got.‚Äù

I wasn't allowed to talk to other kids, unless I was insulting them. 

‚ÄúWhatever.‚Äù

Instead of taking the bottle back, he threw his Adventure Time sweater over my shoulders, immediately taking me off guard. It took me a moment to register this kid actively trying to help me, before I snapped. ‚ÄùI don't want your corny fucking sweater.‚Äù I spat, stumbling on one leg. 

That was a lie. I was freezing to death, and Kaz‚Äôs corny fucking sweater was instant relief. The next day, I must have been either drugged or suffering a head injury, because I stood in the exact same place, struggling on one leg, despite my successful acceptance into the group. 

Kaz appeared again, and to my surprise, he had two iced coffees. I told him to fuck off, because I was an asshole, and he invited me back to his dorm to play video games. 

Three weeks later, I came to the humbling realization that my boys were fucking idiots, and I was just looking for company. I moved out of the frat house and crashed with Kaz.

And now look where we were. Twenty three years old, and my boy was a King.

When I tugged away, unable to resist a hiss, his hands went to the chains wrapped around my wrists, slipping his fingers under the metal prongs slicing into my flesh. ‚ÄúI'm sorry, Rowan.‚Äù Kaz sighed. ‚ÄúIf it were up to me, you wouldn't be down here.‚Äù

He left me for a moment, and came back, dragging along a half-dead version of Nin.

‚ÄúIt's not her,‚Äù he said, shoving Nin to her knees and plunging a blade into her heart, taking it for himself. 

I had never felt territorial, more so always thought it was an animal thing. But when Kaz stuffed her heart into his mouth, I felt my mouth twitch, my nose flaring, a sudden, overwhelming urge to lunge forward and snatch it from him. 

When she bled out, I was already ravenous, my body in control of my mind. 

I barely thought about it, already chewing through her torso and straight into her stomach. Kaz watched me, his lip curled. 

‚ÄúIt's one of her copies from the house,‚Äù he said, when I dove forwards like a fucking dog, mindlessly scooping up scarlet slew and stuffing it into my mouth. Kaz observed like a proud father. ‚ÄúI'm not allowed to give you fresh Nin until you transform, Rowan.‚Äù

I didn't reply, couldn't reply. My mouth was having a fucking orgasm.

""Well, how about this?"" I snapped, straining against the chains. I dropped half of the emaciated head I'd been chewing on. Nin‚Äôs brain was my favorite. It tasted like chicken, mixed with all these different spices I couldn't name. ""You pull yourself together and let me go‚Äì we grab Imogen and then Nin, and get the fuck out of here.‚Äù

Kaz‚Äôs expression darkened. ‚ÄúYou do realize she's the only thing keeping us alive, and you're trying to push her out.‚Äù

I choked on a laugh, pushing away my meal. 

I was no longer hungry. 

‚ÄùAlive,‚Äù I said bitterly, spitting out a bone. I could already feel my body rejecting the meal, my gut twisting into knots. ‚ÄúSure.‚Äù

‚ÄúRowan.‚Äù I hated that Kaz wasn't as brainwashed as I thought. His eyes were alert, not staring straight through me or hollowed out. Which meant he had willingly let her into his head. ‚ÄúAnswer me this,‚Äù he whispered. ‚ÄúThen I'll leave you alone.‚Äù

‚ÄúEnlighten me,‚Äù I said, a bitter smile tugging at my lips. I tried to get up, but my body was too weak. Kaz ran his fingers through my hair, jerking my head up for me. I wasn‚Äôt expecting the sudden, writhing agony crawling up and down my spine, biting every muscle. 

Over the last few days, I had come to realize that movement equalled pain, and this was like an electroshock rattling my whole body. I screamed, a raw cry escaping my lips. 

My head snapped back, and I could feel my spine protruding from my flesh, the bones snapping and reshaping, the sickening pop of each one reforming, contorting under skin that was starting to tear. When Kaz reached out to help, I shuffled away, biting back a sob. 

I was coming apart, chunks of my flesh peeling away.

‚ÄúGet the fuck away from me,‚Äù I gritted out, half-aware of my voice dropping into a growl that wasn‚Äôt mine. ‚ÄúGo on! Explain to me how chaining me to a wall and ‚Äòre-educating‚Äô me into a possessed freak could possibly be a good thing.‚Äù

To my surprise, Kaz didn't meet my gaze. Instead, he stared down at the floor. ‚ÄúDo you remember our first death?‚Äù

I focused on breathing, wrapping my arms around myself. 

If I stayed breathing, I could stay human. I had to stay human. 

‚ÄúHow could I not?‚Äù I deadpanned. ‚ÄúI got a fucking knife through my head.‚Äù

Something in Kaz‚Äôs expression twisted, and my brain was suddenly on fire. 

‚ÄúNo.‚Äù His voice was soft, and his hands once again held my face, soothing me, pushing soaking strands of hair out of my eyes. More pain. This time in my skull, scorching pain rattling the back of my head. Like a blade had been forced through my skull, twisted into the meat of my brain. I didn't realize that I was sobbing, screaming, until my roommate wrapped his arms around me. 

It was a ploy, and I knew it was, because once he was close enough, so was she, bleeding from him, pooling moonlight dripping from his skin. 

Her melody filled my head once again, three single bell chimes, and the world crumbled. 

The floor underneath me shattered into oblivion, and I was falling, coaxed by her words dripping from my roommate‚Äôs lips. 

I could sense her dipping into my brain, delving into my memories, entangling herself inside each one. 

Kaz forced my head up, and the movement sent my body into a frenzy once more, my gaze risking her light‚Äì and she was so beautiful. 

For a confusing moment, I could smell everything, taste every morsel on my lips, stuck to the back of my throat. 

I could smell the humans upstairs‚Äì sense their hearts beating in a frenzy, a vivid, blurred heartbeat thudding in the back of my skull. 

So mesmerising, I found myself reaching forward, my chained hands trying to cup her into them, pulling her from the sky. 

‚ÄùNo, Rowan,‚Äù her voice bled through Kaz‚Äôs.‚ÄùI mean our first death.‚Äù

The memory felt sweet, like a whole lifetime ago.

I was in the back of Kaz‚Äôs car, the slow, lulling movements and the white noise hissing from the radio pulling me in and out of slumber, my head bouncing against the window. 

It was pitch black outside, and I followed a stray raindrop down the glass pane. Imogen was next to me, her head comfortably nestled in the crook of my neck. Kaz was driving, every so often twisting around and shooting me a tired smile. 

‚ÄúYou okay?‚Äù His voice was a low murmur, beaten by a yawn. 

I groaned, pressing my cheek against the cool glass of the window, trying to find some semblance of comfort. Sleeping in a moving car was impossible‚Äîmotion sickness had always stuck with me since I was a kid. 

Imogen drooling on my neck wasn't helping. ""That‚Äôs the last time we spend the weekend with your parents. No offense, but your dad is a sociopath.""

Kaz chuckled, but he'd been unusually quiet the whole ride home. ""He's‚Ä¶ unique.""

""Unique is too nice."" I was about to remind Kaz of his father‚Äôs interesting views on his son‚Äôs relationships when Kaz suddenly slammed on the brakes, hissing through his teeth. I lurched forward, my seatbelt snapping me back just as Imogen jolted awake with a startled shriek. Kaz stopped the car, and I leaned forward in my seat. 

‚ÄúWhat?‚Äù I said, catching his frightened eyes. Kaz was gripping the wheel for dear life. ‚ÄúWhat is it?‚Äù

But I could already see it- a silhouette dancing in the dark. Through a thick layer of fog that I had barely noticed, a shadow was standing directly in the middle of the road. 

Imogen planted her face in my lap. ‚ÄúOh my god, it's a deer. You guys are so unserious.‚Äù

I shot her a look. ‚ÄúHow many deers have you met with human legs?‚Äù

‚ÄúHumans with deer legs exist,‚Äù Kaz whispered, tapping nervously on the wheel. ‚ÄúHave you seen Narnia?‚Äù

‚ÄúMr. Tumnus was a goat!‚Äù Imogen hissed back. 

‚ÄúThey're the same thing.‚Äù

‚ÄúYes, but it's not a human with goat legs,.‚Äù I said, ‚ÄúIt's a deer with human legs.‚Äù I heaved out a breath. ‚ÄúIt's Slenderwoman.‚Äù

When Imogen responded with panicked whispering, I gently shifted her aside, unbuckling my belt. Kaz told me to stay in the car, but something drew me forwards, the glow of a perfect full moon reflecting from the fog. I hesitantly jumped out of the car and found myself face to face with‚Äî a girl. 

She was my age, adorned in a long white flowing dress, ratty blonde curls obscuring her eyes. The girl was barefoot, her legs smeared with dirt. 

‚ÄúWait.‚Äù Imogen stuck her head out of the window. ‚ÄúIsn't that Nina? She's in my economics class.‚Äù She hesitated, and I heard the gentle thump of her sneakers hitting concrete. ‚ÄúWhat is she doing?‚Äù

Relief flooded through me, and I quickened my pace. 

‚ÄúSo, she's not Slenderwoman?‚Äù I hissed. 

‚ÄúNo! She's from my classes. Nina is like, so cute. She usually keeps to herself.‚Äù

So, if she wasn't a ghost girl or an urban legend, why did she look‚Ä¶like *that* The girl was swaying side to side, completely out of it.

‚ÄúHey,‚Äù I said softly. ‚ÄúHey, are you, uh, are you all right?‚Äù

When she didn't reply, staring straight through me, a shiver ran down my spine. 

‚ÄúOkay, zero offence and zero judging,‚Äù I said, ‚ÄúBut why are you barefoot in the middle of nowhere?‚Äù

Still no response. 

‚ÄúRowan, can you get her in the car?‚Äù Kaz shouted. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôll take her back to campus.‚Äù

I turned back to an anxious looking Kaz, his wide eyes lit up in the car headlights. 

I could have sworn that a different light- thinner, almost like a spider‚Äôs silk, was dancing across his face, before hitting the car window. I blinked, shaking my head. ‚ÄúWait, why do l have to grab the crazy girl?‚Äù

He grinned. ‚ÄúBecause you got out first.‚Äù

‚ÄúAsshole.‚Äù 

I ignored his laughter, gently pressing my hand on the girl‚Äôs shoulder, coaxing her towards the car. She followed, to my surprise, climbing in the back seat, her eyes still devoid of life, like staring into two blank stars. When I was leaning over her to buckle her seat belt, her body jolted suddenly, her eyes widening, a terror I didn't know or understand streaking across her face. 

It hit me like a wave of ice water that this girl was scared‚Äì scared of something that wasn't me, or Kaz and Imogen. 

Her frantic eyes searched the night enveloping us, unseeing, and I made the grand mistake of lightly touching her. 

I only reached out, grasping for her wrist, and her whole demeanour switched.

In the half a second it took for her half-lidded eyes to meet mine, she was swinging her fist directly into my jaw, hard enough to knock me back. 

The girl scrambled out of the car. ‚ÄúWhat the fuck?‚Äù She blinked rapidly, her lip wobbling, like she had zero idea where she was. ‚ÄúWhat the fuck are you doing, trying to kidnap me?‚Äù

‚ÄúWoah.‚Äù I held up my hands. ‚ÄúHey, it's cool! It's all right! You were in like, an, uh, a fugue state, and we were trying to help.‚Äù

The girl narrowed her eyes. ‚ÄúYou were trying to kidnap me.‚Äù

I bit back a nervous laugh. ‚ÄúNo, that's not‚Äî‚Äù I swallowed my apology. ‚ÄúYou do realize that you're in the wrong too, right?‚Äù

Kaz started towards her to try and calm her down, but she was already twisting and walking away, directly into the fog. 

‚ÄúAll right, nice knowing you!‚Äù I yelled, nursing my jaw. ‚ÄúI hope you get eaten by a cryptid!‚Äù 

‚ÄúRowan!‚Äù Imogen chastised, like I was a child. 

She dragged me back into the car, like I was the one being the inconvenience. 

Irony was a beautiful fucking thing. 

Our new roommate, who was due to be moving in, in the morning, had a familiar face. 

For a split second, I wasn't sure whether to laugh or cringe with second-hand embarrassment‚Äîon her behalf, of course. 

She had cleaned up pretty well. I was already regretting not shaving and at least getting dressed before answering the door. 

In Imogen Prairie‚Äôs words, I resembled a ‚Äòsewer rat‚Äô when I didn't groom myself. 

The girl was unrecognisable. 

Gone was the disheveled specter resembling a ghost who almost killed us. 

Now, she wore casual jeans and a sweater, a leather jacket thrown over the top. I could read her almost instantly. 

This girl definitely Googled, ‚ÄúWhat do I wear to a room viewing?‚Äù Adorable.

She actually thought we cared about her outfit. Wild strawberry blonde curls, once dangling in her face, were now tamed into a tight ponytail, highlighting what I had failed to see the night before: an angular nose and freckles speckling pale cheeks.

""You,"" she said, her lip curling. It was a crazy way to greet a potential roommate‚Äîespecially when that potential roommate was your former victim. 

I caught a flash of amusement flicker across her eyes when I subconsciously rubbed my still-sore jaw. I noticed her gaze lingering on  my pajama pants and made a point of wrapping my robe tighter around myself. 

She snapped out of it, her eyes meeting mine. ""You tried to kidnap me last night.""

I folded my arms. ""I wasn't the only one, you know."" 

‚ÄúYou were the one who grabbed me.‚Äù

I resisted the urge to roll my eyes. Kaz said I had to be polite, but this girl was already pushing buttons I didn't know I had. Everything about her pissed me off.

The girl inclined her head. ‚ÄúSo, you're admitting that you did try to kidnap me.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou were barefoot in the middle of nowhere, so naturally, we wanted to help you,‚Äù I said. When she opened her mouth to shoot a rebuttal, I was already on a roll. ‚ÄúYou willingly climbed into our car and punched me in the face,‚Äù I deadpanned. ‚ÄúIf anyone should be apologizing, it‚Äôs you.‚Äù 

I stepped back, unable to resist waving at her. ‚ÄúThe room is closed. We‚Äôre no longer accepting applicants.‚Äù

Her expression darkened. ‚ÄúI can explain.‚Äù

‚ÄúYeah, well, we don't accept cryptids, sweetheart.‚Äù I winked at her, sensing her patience wearing thin.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry, what?‚Äù

I leaned against the doorframe, folding my arms. ‚ÄúWhat were you doing last night, may I ask? You know, when you dove in front of my roommate‚Äôs car like you were escaping a cult.‚Äù I laughed, and catching her sudden frantic gaze, I caught myself.

‚ÄúWait,‚Äù I said, mocking a gasp. ‚ÄúYou escaped a cult?‚Äù

Something in her expression seemed to twist. She curled her lip. ‚ÄúThat's none of your business. I came to see the room, and by law, you're obligated to let me in.‚Äù

I sucked my teeth. ‚ÄúOkay, yeah, but you could be a brainwashed cult member.‚Äù

‚ÄúSo could you!‚Äù she exploded, and bam, her true colors were igniting. ‚ÄúAren't you a former frat boy?‚Äù

I rolled my eyes. ‚ÄúOh no, my dark past  as a college freshman has been revealed.‚Äù

She was definitely enjoying her gotcha! moment. ‚ÄúSo, you were in a cult.‚Äù 

I couldn't resist a grin. ‚ÄúI was a frat boy dude. I'm not the one in an actual cult.‚Äù 

‚ÄúI'm not in a cult,‚Äù she spat. ‚ÄúI was dumped by my ex, and I had to walk home.‚Äù

I nodded slowly. ‚ÄúSounds like something someone in a cult would say.‚Äù

I caught her doing the breathing technique, forcing a smile. 

‚ÄúOkay,‚Äù the girl said, ‚ÄúRobbie‚Äì‚Äù

‚ÄúRowan,‚Äù I corrected her. 

‚ÄúI know we got off on the wrong foot.‚Äù 

‚ÄúYou slam dunked me in the jaw.‚Äù

She ignored me, and had the audacity to roll her eyes. ‚ÄúI'm sorry for punching you in the face, Roman.‚Äù 

Okay, she was doing it on purpose. 

‚ÄúRowan,‚Äù I corrected her, again. I mockingly inclined my head. ‚ÄúYou don't sound sorry.‚Äù

‚ÄúI am, though.‚Äù The girl‚Äôs smile widened. ‚ÄúIf I could go back, I would make sure to break your nose.‚Äù

Somehow, against all odds, she had won. I quickly decided that I would rather stick my head in the microwave than have this girl as a roommate. 

Bolivia House was chill vibes, and this girl was neither chill nor vibes.

‚ÄúAll right, then! Well, aren't you just a ray of sunshine,"" I said, my voice dripping with sarcasm. ""Goodbye!"" 

I slammed the door shut in her face, only to turn around and nearly collide with Kaz, who stood there with a towel wrapped around his head, fresh from the shower.

He shook his hair, running a hand through thick curls. ‚ÄúWho was at the door?‚Äù

‚ÄúAmazon.‚Äù

Any other day, Kaz would question it, but he was also high as fuck, so the guy just nodded, tugging the buttons on his new shirt. ‚ÄúWhat do you think? Too formal?‚Äù

With him so close, I got a face full of weed-breath.

I shrugged. ‚ÄúIt's a shirt.‚Äù I nodded at his lack of pants. ‚ÄúYou're half dressed.‚Äù

Kaz groaned, like wearing pants was the equivalent of climbing Mt. Everest. He ran back upstairs, tripping over the last step.

‚ÄúYou didn't see that,‚Äù he shouted in a breathy laugh, his figure disappearing down the hall.

‚ÄúI did.‚Äù

‚ÄúFuck off, Rowan!‚Äù

The girl knocked again, this time louder. 

‚ÄúDon't answer it,‚Äù I stepped in front of the door, ‚ÄúI'm being  completely serious when I say the devil is standing on our doorstep.‚Äù 

Kaz came running back downstairs, completely ignoring me and opening the door. This time, I was surprised to find a second person: Imogen Prairie, a blur of blonde curls and thrifted Prada, who looked ready to strangle me.

‚ÄúRowan.‚Äù She was smiling, so Imogen was mad. ‚ÄúDo you not know how to open a door?‚Äù

I caught the new girl‚Äôs slight smirk. ‚ÄúI was sleeping.‚Äù

‚ÄúHe was just talking to me ten seconds ago,‚Äù the girl spoke up. She was definitely acting. ‚ÄúHe slammed the door in my face.‚Äù

‚ÄúDuuuude, what the fuck,‚Äù Kaz, who was hanging over me, muttered in my ear.

‚ÄúIt's the girl who jumped in front of our car last night,‚Äù I nudged him. ‚ÄúShe almost killed us.‚Äù

‚ÄúWait, seriously?‚Äù

Imogen either didn't notice or didn't care. I was betting on the latter. Imogen treated potential female roommates like stray cats. She maintained a wide smile, her hands entangled with the new girl. 

‚ÄúI‚Äôm so sorry, Nina.‚Äù Her laugh was a little too high, and judging from Kaz‚Äôs side-eye, the two of us were dead men walking. ‚ÄúAs you can see, my roommates lack basic camaraderie, so you can just ignore them for now.‚Äù 

Like a hurricane, Imogen pushed past the two of us, dragging the new girl inside. She stopped in the hallway, shoving us against the wall. 

I opened my mouth to yell ow, but was promptly gagged. Imogen‚Äôs hands smelled like mint.

‚ÄúOkay, well, reintroductions!‚Äù She prodded Kaz in the chest a little too hard, and I caught the new girl trying not to laugh, which sent bubbles of laughter creeping up my throat. Immie broke into a determined grin. 

""Guys, this is Nina Lockhart!‚Äù Before I could cut in to remind my roommates that they were inviting in a child of the devil, Imogen held up her hand to shut me up. ‚ÄúNina, this is Charlie Delacroix. Also Kaz. He's a stoner vegetarian, and he's, like, obsessed with video games and manga. He's also our unofficial/official cook. Kaz is like a big brother.‚Äù

Kaz looked mildly offended, but  he didn't speak in fear of getting his head ripped off.

Imogen pulled me to her side. ‚ÄúRowan Beck.‚Äù She said my name like I was an enigma, and the new girl‚Äôs eyes flicked to me. 

She was already judging me, and Imogen hadn't even properly introduced me yet. 

‚ÄúI won't say anything about Rowan, except that he always has to be right, is totally into obscure black-and-white noir movies that literally nobody else watches, and one time he suggested we have a threesome after winning a 48-hour game of Monopoly.‚Äù 

Kaz made a noise that I thought was a laugh, but it sounded more like he was choking. When the new girl‚Äôs eyes widened, and she quickly averted her gaze, Imogen followed up with an awkward laugh. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm kidding! Rowan is a good boy, I promise.‚Äù

I could feel an uncomfortable heat spreading across my cheeks. Imogen didn't have to call me out like that, but she was also kind of maybe right. It wasn't just my drunken suggestion. 

We did fuck on the couch, like three weeks earlier, completely sober, and I was definitely having conflicting feelings about my roommates. I was twenty-one, and they were my first real relationship. 

If you could call it that. Kaz was seeing another guy, and Imogen was a free spirit, so neither of them wanted to label it. I think I did want to call it something, which sucked because neither of them saw it as serious. That was a miscommunication on my part. I had a thing about expressing my emotions. 

Blah, blah, blah‚Äîmy dad left when I was a kid, blah, blah, blah‚Äîunresolved trauma and an inability to get close to people. That was, until those two came along and ruined my whole ‚ÄúI don't give a fuck; I'll sleep with anyone‚Äù attitude. 

Catching feelings sucked, especially when the two people you were maybe kind of fucking falling in love with, were fine with the whole roommates-with-benefits vibe. 

A heavy silence stretched on for way longer than necessary as I watched the color drain from Imogen‚Äôs face, realizing what she had just said. If I was going down, she was going down with me. 

The new girl straightened up, her gaze flicking to me. She looked‚Ä¶ intrigued. Which was odd, considering Imogen had just introduced me as a sex-obsessed sociopath.

‚ÄúNina.‚Äù Imogen was sweating. She was looking for someone to blame, which was crazy, because she didn't have to expose our private lives within the first minutes of meeting our new roommate. 

This was her fault, and I was secretly enjoying watching her squirm. ‚ÄúI'm so sorry, I didn't mean to make you uncomfortable! I joke a lot when I'm nervous, and I'm really nervous, and I say things that I don't mean‚Äîand I know we like, barely know each other, but my roommates are actually like, super nice‚Äî‚Äù

‚ÄúIt's Nini,‚Äù the girl corrected. She was laughing, which wasn't what I expected.

‚ÄúOr Nin,‚Äù I blurted, without thinking, and this time, her eyes challenged me. ""If you want to shorten your name even more.‚Äù

I didn't mean to sound like a dick, but judging from my roommates faces, I did. 

I caught her smile when Imogen grinned at her, and then her side-eye at Kaz. 

She was definitely looking both of them up and down. But to my surprise, they were under her spell. Kaz and Imogen had zero idea of her manipulative ways. 

Imogen‚Äôs eyes were a little too bright, Kaz‚Äôs frown pricking into a smile. 

This girl was trying to steal my fucking roommates right in front of me. 

I held her gaze, flashing her a cheesy grin. 

She responded with a slight curl of her lips.

A silent declaration of war.

Against my wishes, Nini moved in as our new roommate. 

Initially, I kept my eye on her. Whenever she and Kaz were getting too close, or when she spent too much time with Imogen, I inserted myself into the conversation, shooting her a smile that she rebutalled with that infuriating little smirk. 

I even made a poster, sticking it on the wall above the sink. 

NO FRATERNISING. I wrote, in permanent marker. 

NO FUCKING.

 NO ‚ÄòFRIENDS WITH BENEFITS‚Äô

NO ORGIES.

NO EXCUSES.

Nini pointed it out the next morning, and had the audacity to laugh. 

There were multiple things about Nini Lockhart that drove me crazy. 

For one, she was so secretive, locking herself in her room and refusing to let anyone inside. I was still curious about the night she jumped in front of our car, but every time I crept into her room to investigate, the girl was always behind me, gently pulling me back. 

Nini rolled her eyes. ‚ÄúI'm sorry, does privacy not exist in this house?‚Äù

I shrugged. ‚ÄúIf you've got nothing to hide‚Äì maybe.‚Äù

I left her, convinced I'd won, before a stuffed animal thwacked me in the back of the head. 

‚ÄúOw!‚Äù

I ducked and grabbed the toy to lob it back at her, but she slammed the door in my face. 

I added ‚Äúabuse‚Äù to the long list of reasons I did not like her. 

She always left the refrigerator door open, blasted music in her room when I was trying to sleep, and selfishly bought groceries only for herself‚Äîacting surprised that the world didn‚Äôt revolve around her. Nini was also getting too close to Kaz and Imogen. 

I started stalking her, insisting on joining her for breakfast, and even inviting her to watch movies just to keep her away from my roommates. 

This girl acted innocent, but I wasn‚Äôt fooled by her theatrics. One night, she invited me to cook dinner with her. 

She spent the whole time following the wrong recipe‚Äîyet she insisted she was right and refused to admit defeat, even as I read the correct one out loud, right in front of her. I didn‚Äôt realize I was enjoying myself until she burst out laughing, losing her composure, which set me off as well. 

We both ended up caught in painful hysterics‚Äîuntil Kaz stuck his head through the door and told us to be quiet.

But I still didn't like her. 

Nin was tolerable. 

We played Monopoly, and she was of course a sore loser, flipping the board when she realized I was winning. Nin was a selfish, entitled, insufferable brat, and yet somehow I couldn't keep away from her. 

I found myself talking to her when I didn't mean to talk to her, making snide quips at everything she said, in hopes of her throwing back a rebuttal. I didn't know what it was, and how I felt, because this was different to Kaz and Imogen. 

With them, it was like a craving, a need to be wrapped around them so they would never let me go. Nin felt natural, a slow moving thing that I wasn't sure I wanted to label. 

After a drunken night, however, I had no choice but to label it.

Waking up naked in Nin's bed, her head resting on my shoulder, I realized I'd broken my own rules. As I tilted my head back, my eyes caught a giant oil painting of the full moon taking up the whole ceiling. 

So, Nin had a thing for the moon?

Sitting up, her head sliding onto my chest, I found myself staring at every angle, every crater, every stage of the moon. There were newspaper clippings taped to the walls, black-and-white photos of people with their faces scratched out. 

Something snapped inside me, my blood running cold. 

""What the... fuck?""

When I tried to move, I couldn't.

‚ÄùSee?‚Äù

The moon bled into my mind, a sweet melody entangled in my thoughts. 

‚ÄùYou don't remember this, do you, my darling?‚Äù Her voice dripped with spite, with unbridled triumph. ""How on earth could you forget your first death?‚Äù

I was suddenly far too aware of the real world, where my body was working against me, molding me into a monster, my limbs contorting. 

She was biding her time, dragging me through my memories, while her light entangled around my bones. This time, they didn't snap back to normal. 

Instead, they were reshaping, reforming themselves, a rattling cry escaping my lips that felt unreal. 

The memory splintered before blooming into another. 

This time, I was handcuffed to Nin's bed. 

I ripped out of my restraints and stumbled downstairs, where Kaz and Imogen were tied up back to back in the lounge. She had already marked them, carving symbols into their skin‚Äîand looking down, they covered my arms too.

Before I could help them, I was violently shoved against the wall, a knife pressed to my throat. 

Nin was so close, her lips grazing mine. The moon was fucking with me. 

Before the false memory could take full control, I screamed, anchoring myself to reality. But the moon tightened her iron grip. ‚ÄúI will make you a deal,‚Äù she sang into my head. ‚ÄúI will show you your first death, and you will let go and take your place on the throne.‚Äù

Her voice grew louder over the sound of my body splintering apart.

‚ÄúDeal?‚Äù

Reality slammed into me, and I was on what was left of my hands and knees, staring up at her, gasping for breath, my cries growing into ragged growls, my jaw prying wider and wider. 

When my spine snapped back, agony became something else entirely. I could feel her seeping into my skin, spiderwebbing across my eyes and slipping through my lips and ears.

I wasn't aware of my mouth moving; my voice was no longer mine, my body was her puppet.

‚ÄúYes,‚ÄùI managed to croak, my voice splintering into a sob.

The moon did show me, like she had been dangling this forgotten memory in front of me the whole time. It was sharp and quick, a series of flashes like a rewinding VCR.

There were four shadows standing on our doorstep.

Kaz stood next to me, his eyes wide. Imogen was hiding behind me, Nin grasping hold of my hand. I didn‚Äôt realize how right she felt, entangled in my fingers, until she squeezed my wrist reassuringly.

‚ÄúLeave,‚Äù Kaz spoke up, directed at the shadows. ‚ÄúSorry, but we‚Äôre not interested.‚Äù

I stepped forward to slam the door in their faces, but the BANG shattered my ears.

Kaz dropped to the ground, and I was petrified.

BANG.

Imogen crumpled into a heap, and Nin screamed.

I couldn‚Äôt move, couldn‚Äôt breathe, as one shadow stepped forward, and I felt ice-cold metal protruding into my forehead.

What‚Äôs funny is that I didn‚Äôt even feel my first death‚Äîhow pathetically human it truly was. There was no cult, no knife through the skull, no sacrificing my shadow to appease a starving god. 

No, it was so human. I was in the wrong place at the wrong time. I waited for the memory to end, for the moon to pull me from my own mind and force me to keep my side of the deal.

But she didn‚Äôt. I could still sense her, bleeding inside me.

And yet the memory did not stop.

‚ÄúRowan!‚Äù

Nin‚Äôs cry cut through the darkness, and I could feel myself being dragged through‚Äîdirt? My eyes were open, but I couldn‚Äôt move, my gaze fixed on a perfect full moon. Nin‚Äôs hands were wrapped around my ankles, and with another pull, I was slipping into ice-cold water, my body half-submerged in the town lake. I could see Nin, her shadow dropping beside me. 

But I couldn‚Äôt feel her hands cradling my face, her breath tickling my cheeks. ‚ÄúStay with me,‚Äù she whispered, slapping me across the face. ‚ÄúI'm going to save you, all right? All of you. I promise.‚Äù Her voice broke. ‚ÄúYou just need to trust me, okay?‚Äù

Nin brushed my hair out of my eyes, her fingers tip-toeing across my skin.

‚ÄúTrust me.‚Äù Her eyes didn‚Äôt make sense, so bright, yet devoid of life. ‚ÄúI know if won't make sense right now, and I know you'll hate me, but you're going to be okay.‚Äù she kept repeating it to herself, her hands slick with my blood, forcing me to look at her. 

Nin leaned forward and kissed me, her shaky breaths grazing my lips, her trembling fingers forcing my eyes open. 

When she rolled me onto my side, there were claw marks in the dirt, symbols I couldn‚Äôt read carved into the grass. She scooped up Kaz into her arms‚ÄîKaz, with a bullet hole in his head, his limp arms dangling‚Äîand threw him into the water.

Gathering up Imogen, a blur of blood-stained curls and fluffy pajamas, she dropped her in too. I was next. 

Nin was gentle with me, rolling me into the shallows, my body slipping under the water.

‚ÄúHow selfish,‚Äù the moon whispered into my head. ‚ÄúLook at what she did to you! She gave you to me, sweet boy. I wouldn‚Äôt be here without her.‚Äù

The moon's words grounded me back to the real world.

This time, I had an audience, and I didn‚Äôt even hear my own screams, my wails for death, the sound of my muscles tearing apart.

‚ÄúDo you not hear me, Rowan?‚Äù The moon‚Äôs voice was soft, sultry.

‚ÄúShe gave you to me. Body, mind, and soul.‚Äù

She saved us, I thought, my thoughts spiraling.

But that... wasn‚Äôt true.

Nin didn‚Äôt fucking save us. She turned us into monsters. 

‚ÄúExactly.‚Äù The moon‚Äôs voice was soothing, almost motherly. ‚ÄúHow dare she, hm? Does she even realize what she‚Äôs done? And to throw away her own memories to stop her own pain! Sweet Rowan, how could she be so self-centered?‚Äù

She wanted to‚Ä¶ forget?

‚ÄúYes. Nina asked me to purge her memories, taking away everything, even knowledge of her own involvement. She carved your souls into the ground, into the walls of your home, allowing me, when the time was right, to send my followers to take what was mine.‚Äù

Nin‚Äôs scream echoing in my head.

‚ÄúYes! Please bring them back!‚Äù

The moon‚Äôs confirmation snapped something inside me.

I felt myself go limp, my head hanging.

‚ÄúI can make you a King, Rowan,‚Äù the moon sighed.

She laughed, feeling so real, whispering directly into my skull.

‚ÄúSorry. You don‚Äôt want to be a King. Which is a pity.‚Äù

I couldn‚Äôt move my mouth anymore, my body screeching for mercy.

Changing.

Contorting.

I held onto human words, which began to tangle.

You gave her what she wanted, I thought, the chains wrapped around my limbs‚Äîlimbs that felt bulging, wrong, and monstrous‚Äîsnapped apart. 

It was so hard to think straight. Suddenly, my thoughts were blurred and dancing, a hellish red glow streaking across my writhing vision. 

‚ÄúOf course,‚Äù the moon said. ‚ÄúI will grant anything.‚Äù

Let me‚Ä¶

Fuck.

I couldn‚Äôt think. Couldn‚Äôt think. Couldn‚Äôt‚Ä¶

Let me fucking die.

The moon was in front of me, so bright, so beautiful, a being I couldn‚Äôt comprehend. Her hands were gentle, grasping my face that was no longer human, no longer mine, moving slowly, gripping under my chin and the top of my head. In a single jerking movement, she forced me to look at her.

‚ÄúThe reluctant King wants to sleep, hmm?‚Äù

Yes. 

Her hands disappeared, and my eyes were full of light.

So... beautiful.

‚ÄúThen let go, child.‚Äù

I did.

And in those seconds it took for me to give in, every part of me‚Äîbody, mind, and soul‚Äîevery last fleeting part of myself I was holding onto‚Äîsplintered. 

The second chain snapped, and I was on my hands and knees again, but this time I was whole. Her light bathed me, and I reveled in it, in her, having the grace to offer me a place next to her, where I would rule.

By her side.

‚ÄúYou are going to make her suffer,‚Äù the moon sang inside my shattering mind.

The words contorted my brain, and when my lips split open, elongated sharp points spiked my tongue. My brain was boiling, my body going hot and cold‚Äîuntil I was screaming, hysterical bubbles of laughter climbing up my throat. I couldn‚Äôt think, but thinking was bad. 

I wasn‚Äôt allowed to think.

Yes.

Tipping my head back, my bones snapped into place, and my vision filled with light, an animalistic snarl ripping from my lips. 

My final thought was raging fire, unbridled pleasure warping my brain into hers.

Yes.

I was going to be King. 

And‚Ä¶ yes.

I‚Ä¶ was going to make her suffer.",1,1734675937.0,Malliem,0,1.0,False

Firstly I just want to say that I am changing everyone‚Äôs actual names! And some personal details about myself and other that I think maybe too obvious?? Lmao Disclaimer?? This story has to do with alcoholism to some degree?? 

1. About me - I‚Äôm in therapy for the last year, been somewhat regularly taking my meds. I have BPD + honestly probably been depressed since I was 5. I‚Äôve recently I think come to terms that I don‚Äôt keep friends in my close circle, that my friendships are always more one sided than it should be. Which is mostly why I‚Äôm here, and I finally feel ready.  Okay let‚Äôs get started

2021 - I‚Äôm in my very early 20s and I start dating a MAN who‚Äôs 37! After honestly not long I was basically start living with him. Let call him Ed, Ed opened up a store at the beginning of 2021. (Growing up my dad opened up a store - so I do kinda know the ‚Äòlife‚Äô of opening a business/store) so it‚Äôs been barely 2 months and everything is perfect! He hires this girl lets call her Jenny - he texts me right away saying, ‚Äòhe‚Äôs hired this girl, she lives across the street, she‚Äôs crazy, she just got back from Jamaica and has cornrows (you know you do you,, but like the you know you know) I‚Äôm going ask her to come up for a coffee (we..?? He lives above the store) *at this point I don‚Äôt really know as well as I thought I did.. i guess I was just really na√Øve or just really young.. I immediately felt werid about it but I was like he thinks she‚Äôs crazy‚Ä¶. When we met RIGHT AWAY I could sense idk tension weirdness something! Ed, myself, and her are chatting - she isn‚Äôt working just stopping by- it‚Äôs really werid she‚Äôs almost ignoring/ acting like I‚Äôm not there + like trying to talk her self up. But also like flirting with MY BOYFRIEND! And I‚Äôm right away like ohhh she‚Äôs one of these girls. He asks me to be nice to her and like friendly to her she just came back from Jamaica for the 3 months ( I guess the best way to describe this- I‚Äôm half Jamaican, she‚Äôs full white European. Now she‚Äôs returned she‚Äôs magically become Jamaican?? So k guess I‚Äôm Parisian now? Like wtf! God writing this just makes me mad like I wish I said something at the time 

Okay I‚Äôm going to stop here // there‚Äôs soo much to more to say and barely touching the tip of the ice burg! I really wish I could be more angry and I want to be. Because she‚Äôs has never taken accountability for anything, constantly putting me down while raising herself. I really don‚Äôt want to bring this into the new year. She is an alcoholic which I found out later on, but unfortunately didn‚Äôt believe it till probably when me and my ex broke up. Jenny and I have counted our friendship, sometimes I really wish I didn‚Äôt. 
If there‚Äôs some out there that thinks they can help me pls pls pls comment I‚Äôm soo desperate I never comment on post videos TikToks famous people anything never on here
