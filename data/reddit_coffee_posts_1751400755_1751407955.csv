“I’m coming! I’m coming!” Sararah shouted at the door that had been pounded on for three minutes and twenty seconds—the exact amount of time it had taken her to accept they weren’t going away.

 “For the love of all that’s unholy!” She had learned a long time ago not to answer the door during the day, as nothing good was on the other side. Be it salespeople, the building’s super, kids selling cookies, or even the cops, none of them could do anything if she refused to open the door.

But the pounding continued, and she knew that if she didn’t get them to stop, the neighbours would be filing their own complaints. **“STOP!”** she snarled. That had usually been enough to send whoever it was on their way.

Sure enough, there was a pause, and the silence rang in her ears. “Sarah,” said a commanding male voice just before the pounding resumed in earnest.

*“ALRIGHT!”* she screamed, throwing the door open. Whoever it was would regret their life choices of the day. She would—

She froze. In front of her stood a stunning older man with tanned skin and windswept, salt-and-pepper hair, a neatly trimmed beard, and a seafoam green Henley shirt unbuttoned just enough to expose a glowing silver medallion against his sun-darkened skin.

No tan lines. His frame was a medium build, but it was clear he was no stranger to a workout. Even his forearms had definition. The beige knee-length cargo pants were creased as if he’d shaken them out and pulled them on, but she could forgive that when the rest of the package was so yummy. She finished her perusal, taking in the tight calf muscles that flowed down into the slightly darker beige canvas loafers on his feet. *Yes, please.*

She noticed the rolling suitcase behind him just as he chuckled. “You certainly don’t waste any time, do you, Sarah?” he asked, now sounding slightly familiar, though she still couldn’t quite place him. At least, not until she looked up again and met a matching set of eyes that mirrored her roommate’s eye.

“Oh, skit!” Her eyes widened in horror, and her hand flew to cover her mouth. “Mister Cromwell!”

“Warren, please. I take it I beat Julie here, then?”

It took Sararah a hot second for her brain to reboot. “Who?”

Warren’s smile was another thing he shared with his daughter. “Pepper’s mom. She was up in Maine when I called her yesterday afternoon, and she said—” He paused and looked over his shoulder as someone from farther down the hallway walked behind him, bumping his suitcase in the process. “Do you mind if I come in?”

“Of course! Please!” She stepped back and waited for him to wheel his suitcase into the room. “Wha-what are you doing here?”

“I told you I was coming.”

Sararah was about to argue that claim when she realised he was heading into the living room. That wouldn’t have been so bad if not for last night’s drinks and the takeout boxes still piled around the sofa, with her more recent snacks and open beer balancing on the half-crushed pizza box on the coffee table.

She’d promised Pepper that she’d clean up the mess today, but hadn’t planned on starting until later this afternoon … like two seconds before she went out on her first callout for the evening. Unless someone was prepared to pay a premium (or another equally good reason), her mornings had always been dedicated to the many soaps she streamed.

She rushed past him, shifting her mass to almost ooze by in her hurry to beat him to the small space she shared with his daughter. Her hands made a wild scoop of everything, using the pizza box as a makeshift shovel to collect the rest. “Give me a minute to clear…”

“Sarah, it’s fine. Well, maybe not fine, but it’s obvious you weren’t expecting visitors.”

“Yeah, no,” she agreed, as Bailey, Pepper’s cat shot out of Pepper’s room and made a beeline for their visitor, rawwing as if she were impersonating a badly tuned motorbike.

“Hey, you,” Warren purred, going down onto one knee to pat the cat, who immediately drove his head into Warren’s shin and proceeded to rub himself along every inch of whatever he could reach. “I missed you too, buddy-boy. How’s the cold treating you?”

 “You do know it’s summer, right?” Sararah muttered under her breath. Pepper’s views on ‘the cold’ were annoying enough, without having to listen to them in stereo.

By the time he looked up again, Sararah had the room semi-tidy.

“I hear you’ve been able to cure him of his habit of helping himself to food on the table,” he said, his hands still stroking and rubbing the cat’s thick fur. “You’ll have to tell me how you managed that.”

Sararah thought back with a grim smile to the day Bailey had been stupid enough to *attempt* to steal her food while Pepper was at work. It was hour three of day one … and it hadn’t ended well for Bailey. “We came to an … understanding,” she hedged. *He didn’t eat my food, and I didn’t eat him.* As she collected everything up, she utilised her shifting to put a cleaner across the surface of the sofa and spread a quilt across the seats for Warren to sit on. “Please,” she said, using her elbow to gesture for him to take a seat. “I’ll get rid of all of this and be right back.”

When she returned, he was reclining comfortably on the far end of the couch, clearly waiting for her to join him. Given the apartment only had a three-seater couch in the living room, Sararah slid into the seat at the other end from Warren. “Why are you here?” she asked, as Bailey jumped up onto the middle cushion and then strode to Warren, taking up residence in his lap and rubbing his face against the skin that the unbuttoned Henley exposed.

Honestly, Sararah had never been more jealous of a cat in her life … even if it was Pepper’s dad.

“Because I’ve spent a lifetime following my instincts, and after your call yesterday, those instincts were screaming at me to get my butt to New York City. You called me out of the blue, tried to coach me into having Pepper put on our medical information ‘just in case’, then blew me off when I asked for more details surrounding it.”

He shook his head, his hands stroking the cat. “I’d have been on the last flight last night, but by the time I organised one of the other commanders to take my shift for a few days, that one had already left. Julie was up in Maine when I called her, and she said she was just leaving with a delivery for Philly. That’s about a ten-hour run give or take, plus unloading time and getting across to New York City, so I figured it’d be a coin-toss which of us got here.” He grinned. “I win. Lucky me.”

“You could have just called me back…” Sararah hedged, growing more uncomfortable at the way the Watch Commander sobered and drew back in his seat, his eyebrow arching sharply at her. Bailey immediately meowed and head butted his throat for attention, but Warren ignored her with what had to be years of practice.

“Perhaps, but now that that is a moot point, I have but one question for you right now, Sararah,” he said, crossing his feet at the ankles. “Do you want to wait for Julie, so you only have to explain once, or do you want to explain what you know to me, using me as a practice run before the real inquisitor arrives?”

All this time, Sararah had thought the man who led whole teams of lifeguards would be the person to give her the harder time. “The real inquisitor? But I thought … you…”

Warren snorted. “Don’t get me wrong,” he said, returning his hand to Bailey’s neck and back. “Neither conversation is going to be enjoyable from your perspective, but Julie is a Pitbull when it comes to Pepper’s safety. Always has been, and as much as I love that woman to death, there’s a reason Pepper and I breathed a sigh of relief whenever her hauls took her out of state. Too much of Julie’s attention when she’s on a roll can be a bad thing.”

“And yet you called her anyway?”

Warren’s lips parted into a broad smile, making him all the more handsome. “Hell, yeah. Otherwise, I’d be in the hot seat instead of you. Does it look like I have *‘Crazy’* tattooed across my forehead to you?”

“I could arrange it.”

“What?”

“Nothing.”

“So, what’s your preference?”

Sararah looked at the ceiling for guidance, then decided to wait for Mrs Cromwell. Better to do it once, and once only, though she was still at a loss as to how to explain any of it in a way they’d understand without invoking the veil.

And Pepper would kill her for that. “You might as well get comfortable, Warren. We’ll wait.”

“Your funeral.”

*I'm definitely looking for someone to enhance my life, my marriage is good, but it could be better, it could always be better, right? The thing is though, we seem to have fallen into taking each other for granted, feeling too comfortable, lack of effort has now pushed way to feeling a little invisible, plus we have older kids who will probably fly the nest within a few years, and so im unsure how we'll navigate just being a couple.*

**Things that i like:**  
*Lazy mornings, people watching, the warm sun on my skin, fresh coffee, the smell of freshly cut grass, rum (spiced or dark), teasing, exploring castles and forests (not hiking), long drives in the countryside, 90's alternative music, cooking and trying new foods, psychological films, late nights and early lazy mornings, drawing/sketching, dogs.*

**Things i dont like:**  
*One worded responses, going to bed early, cats, twats riding scooters, being out in the cold, crowds of people, being stuck behind slow walking people, cold showers, noisy people in the cinema, dancing.*

**My bad points:**  
*Over thinking, i have been called intense before, and i have a tendency to take things to heart.*

**Fun fact:**  
I was once called for jury service, and i would love to do it again. 

*I make no apologies for being who i am, the older i get, i seem to care less about what people think or say these days.

GM's Perspective: A Day to Remember

This session was special. Not just because it marked the end of a major arc in our campaign—but because it was the first time our full party met in person.

Here’s a quick look at what happened both in-game and in real life, from my perspective as GM.

# The Day Before

Viktor arrived a day early. I picked him up from the station, and we immediately hit a pizzeria where he devoured a Rumošova pralinka and saved three more for later (priorities!). That night we stayed up watching *Dredd* and *Robocop 2*—perfect pre-session ritual.

I already had confirmation that the full crew would be coming. I’d spent the day prepping maps and encounter materials, hoping everything would click. I knew Jaro had an ear infection but was determined to show up anyway. I prayed nothing would go wrong.

# Game Day: Chaos and Stew

I woke up at 6:30am to start cooking the goulash. Around 8:00, I called Fero, who didn’t pick up, so I moved our sync to 10:00. Meanwhile, the goulash was coming along nicely. Viktor eventually woke up and, being the gracious host I am, I told him to clean the kitchen while I picked up Fero.

On the way, Viktor called me claiming he broke his leg. I nearly crashed the car—turns out he just wanted a Red Bull. (Typical.)

Fero called back and offered to grab snacks. While he shopped, I was dodging traffic trying to reverse into the tight little alley behind the store.

# The Gathering

By 10:00, three players and I (GM) had gathered. The pre-game chatter was long—but worth it, since most of us were meeting in person for the first time.

I insisted we revisit the endgame plan written back in April and reconcile the in-universe timeline with the changes brought on by a year of gameplay and multiple far-flung missions. Nostalgia hit hard—we remembered great moments from past sessions.

# The Great Debate: Where to Penetrate the Black Sun

Then came the *big* point of contention: how to penetrate the Black Sun.

We had two competing schools of tactical thought. Viktor argued for entry through the sphincters. Jaro insisted the eye was the correct path. Everyone joined the discussion. Every possible orifice was analyzed. I was smiling on the inside—that’s exactly why I made the map the way I did: so you'd argue.

# Bread, Sausage, and Shadows

Then Maťo (Erius) arrived—our long-lost son—bringing divine homemade bread baked by his wife.

I reheated the goulash and made a mountain of sausages and rolls. The sausages disappeared almost immediately.

While the group finalized their assault plan, I had to leave briefly with Jaro to pick up my wife at the airport. I left Maťo, Viktor, and Fero to get to know each other. When we returned, we relocated the session outdoors under the shade, near a swing, with snacks, laptops, and a gaming table.

# Entering the Black Sun

By the seventh hour of the “entry debate,” my internal smile had faded a bit. But we finally had a vote—and the Eye School won (sorry, Viktor).

When the mission began, the immersion was *instant*. I didn’t know what to expect from this finale—but not this. There was a profound sense of scale. Every moment came alive.

I’ll describe the in-game events in the next post, but just know: the descent into the Black Sun aboard the ship brought the vessel to 50% integrity at one point. The players’ smart play and accumulated bonuses from earlier adventures saved them. I made sure their long-term decisions had real payoff—they *felt* the weight of everything they’d done over the campaign.

Then came the kicker: upon entering the core, Xan triggered a catastrophic, completely unexpected move. I nearly shit myself—and I think they saw it. But then… he rewound time. Right before it all fell apart.

What followed was a cascade of events that brought us to the final moments of the game. The players’ plan—brilliant and dangerous—nearly destroyed the world. But it managed to slow the transformation of a being that would have annihilated Corellon in the Distant Realms. They shoved that being into a portal—alongside Alder.

At that moment, Alder was faced with the decision that would seal not only his own fate, but the fate of his mysterious patroness. He chose life. And with that, he changed both her destiny and Corellon’s… and rewrote the deep traumas that had defined him since childhood.

Then came something none of us expected.

Chlodovík made a final choice: he took his own life. He believed he didn’t belong in this world. Maybe there were deeper reasons tied to his strange encounter with the will-o’-the-wisp… things we’ll never fully understand. Some stories end in silence.

We shared epilogues—what happened after, what might happen next. The game ended just as night fell, around 9 PM. There was laughter, and I’ll admit, there was also grief.

We packed everything up and said our goodbyes. Viktor, who stayed the night, rode with me and my wife to drop off Fero. The whole drive back, we talked about the campaign. Processing. Remembering. Grieving.

Later, Viktor and I watched *28 Weeks Later*, still emotionally hungover. The next morning, we talked about the story over coffee. Then we took Viktor to the train station. Even then, he was still disappointed they didn’t enter the Black Sun through the ass.

Once he was already on the train, he messaged me—he forgot the three slices of pizza in the fridge. Some things never change.

I didn’t write the session log right away. I’ve been quietly sitting with it, letting it sink in.

But the day itself? That was as much a part of the campaign as any journal entry. Now, it’s time for that final entry. The mission itself.

# THE FINAL JOURNAL

At dawn, the heroes of “Last Hope” gathered in the Astrarium to launch their attack on the Black Sun.

They were worried—but ready. Each had spent the last eight days in preparation.

* **Xan**, with his new wife, finalized the construction of his alternate body and upgraded the *Astral Canary*.
* **Alder** maintained the fortress and coordinated with Venus for the coming assault.
* No one really knew what **Chlodovík** had been doing, other than working in his new lab. The truth came out at the launch ramp: he had hastily married a young woman named Adria.

The *Astral Canary* had been reshaped into a massive, needle-like ship. Onboard: the disguised King, Verenestra, Leopold—and, of course, the *Steel Butterfly*—a man carrying a soul destined to become the End of the Universe… unless it could be turned against the Black Sun. Also on board, the Mind Flayers that would protect them from psionic dangers.

The ship was crewed by the best minds and warriors the Empire had to offer.

Before launch, Xan sent a magical farewell to his wife: “I love you.” The wives of the heroes watched silently from the hangar observatory. The attack plan was top secret—even the people didn’t know the time of the assault.

# The Reunion in Deep Space

Mid-flight, the *Astral Canary* rendezvoused with **Erius**, now grizzled and hardened, leading his Infernoques and the redeemed souls he had rescued from Hell. His heart remained good.

Once the party realized how strong their Solar Dome defenses had become (originally designed to power their superweapons), they chose to bring Erius into the assault force instead of leaving him on defense.

Using dream-based attacks, they assassinated the enemy's interdimensional navigators. Then their ally **Zoldar**—in a questionable stroke of brilliance—used his new elemental magic to replace the enemy’s water supply with raw sewage.

# The Final Approach

Their first stop: Venus’s sanctuary, orbiting the Black Sun. They tracked the Sun in metareal space and landed on her planet—Alder’s patroness, now at the center of the coming storm.

In Alder’s visions, Venus had been bleak but colorful—its skies filled with titanic tombs floating like planetary monuments. In reality, the tombs orbited the dead world in silence. No sky. No color. Just bone-white emptiness.

Atop the central pyramid—once seen in dreams as gilded and awe-inspiring—there was no angelic statue with a shifting face. Only a single headless and armless monument grew out of a throne, surrounded by mournful reliefs.

Reality itself seemed to fracture here, and no one could tell what was real and what was illusion—or whether both were happening simultaneously.

Venus welcomed them sincerely, but with sadness. She supported their mission and they discussed the plan. Xan requested her blessing. She gave it. Among the carved reliefs, they noticed a familiar face: Alefron. Did he smile at them with sorrow—or did they only imagine it?

# Toward the Black Star

They said goodbye. Then, onward—toward the Black Star.

It’s impossible to describe its scale. It filled their entire field of vision. So vast it no longer appeared round—its horizon was too far for light to reach uniformly. No features on its surface looked natural. Nothing that massive should exist, let alone warp space around it.

The *Astral Canary* surged forward. The journey to the surface would take them across millions of kilometers—and even deeper inside the star, another eight million more.

As they approached the “eye,” its magnitude became incomprehensible. To rally the crew, **Alder** gave a speech: how even the smallest beings—insignificant against such cosmic horror—could defy it with the work of their own hands. As he spoke, the ship plunged downward.

# Breach

They fired projectiles that disrupted the star’s metareal field. Their plan: allow a small object (the ship) to stay inside while forcing the Black Sun—too vast to fit through—outside of local meta-continuity. This was their chance.

The captain, aided by the party, dodged flares and violent storms in the solar plasma. With careful piloting, they reached the edge of the surface.

There, **Alder’s father** and his archmages activated a wide-scale illusion, masking their ship from the enemy fleet.

As they neared the surface, **Venus turned to face the Black Star**. She screamed—and from her mouth shot a burning ray of unimaginable force, carving a vast crater in the star's flesh all the way down toward the core.

The *Canary* dove in. The heat, the resistance, the chaos—it was all too much. The ship took damage. But they pressed on.

# The Descent

They hid briefly inside the ""glass"" of the star’s eye. There, Alder crafted a lure—something born from his knowledge of the Distant—that attracted the predators lurking in the eye away from them.

Then, onward again. When they had to dive into the bone marrow of the star, the **Guardian of the Black Sun** caught up. A monstrous entity—amalgamated from the corpses of countless space-drifting dragons.

In a moment of insane courage, **Alder and Erius** launched themselves from the torpedo tubes, armored and shielded. They survived the blast. Then, using a reality-bending spell, they **banished** the creature from existence.

They regrouped and pressed forward. Their massive device cleared the way, obliterating obstacles as they went.

# The Core

Eventually, they reached the core.

A *Temporal Stalker* began to form—something sent to erase them before they could act—but **Xan destroyed it** using their prototype weapon. Then, the very walls of the star began to crush inward, trying to prevent their passage.

At that moment, the **King** arrived in his mecha, *Hyperion: Bloodstorm*, and forced the way open.

**Alder turned to Flumph, the Cherry Blossom**, and gave the order. The gentle creature smiled sadly, said farewell—and melted into the door to open it from within.

They entered.

# The Heart of the Star

Inside, they saw a strange archipelago of islands, each displaying moments from someone’s life—memories, frozen in time.

In the center hovered a single island: a great tree stood tall, surrounded by laughing children, and a figure shifting form to entertain them. Joy filled the air.

Nearby: something like a **sleeping, burning infant**—a dwindling solar spark.

Xan recognized it. This was likely the dying ember of the original sun—kept alive, barely, by Corellon… or what little was left of him.

Beneath them pulsed a massive structure—a **splitting stellar nucleus**, like a dividing cell. It suggested that the Black Sun **intended to reproduce**.

At the top of the great tree stood Corellon’s **corrupted avatar**, bow in hand.

Xan was the first to approach the barrier surrounding the floating island at the heart of the Black Sun’s core. Now awakened as a living Imperial Saint, he wielded power beyond mortal means—and shattered the veil.

The moment the barrier collapsed, a volley of devastating arrows struck Xan’s body, loosed by the corrupted avatar atop the tree. The floating memory-islands began to dissolve into a writhing mass of mouths, tendrils, and eyes beneath.

To everyone's shock, Xan rewound time by a few seconds, sacrificing his own well-being to give the party crucial insight.

# The Soul of a God

The group explored the remaining fragments—interacting with ghosts and scenes from Corellon’s forgotten past. Each interaction peeled back layers of his corruption, forcing him to confront not just what he had become, but what he had allowed himself to become.

When the barrier fell again, they kept their distance—500 feet from the island—and tried communication instead. They realized the island itself, the tree, the dancing children, and the shapeshifting spirit were all fragments of Corellon’s original innocence. A memory. A relic of a god's former self.

Through a powerful blend of argument, compassion, and a perfect elven dance, they convinced Corellon to awaken the child—the solar spark—and to join in a final joyful dance… and let the fire consume them both.

# The Fire of Rebirth

The newly awakened sun ignited. All was flame.

Xan blocked the exit with his body, immune to the solar storm, shielding the others until they escaped back to the ship. The reborn sun-child danced in the firelight behind them.

But time was running out.

They brought forth the *Steel Butterfly*, barely holding his form. The spells that bound him were failing. His transformation into an apocalyptic being was imminent.

Using power drawn from the Solar Dome, they activated the Revaut Device—a portal to the soul of the Black Sun, already escaping into the Distant. There, **Alder** finally stepped into the Distant Realm himself, face to face with the cosmic truth he had long suspected.

There, he remembered the fae’s offer:  
He could sacrifice himself and save his Patroness—or live, and let her perish.  
But now he understood. He could trade places with her.

# The Last Goodbye

Alder chose life.

As the Steel Butterfly gave in to his nature—transforming into a storm of annihilation that tore through the Black Sun's ancient corrupted god-form—Alder whispered farewell. He told his Patroness he had always been faithful… but this was goodbye.

Then he plane-shifted.

He returned home—to his wife, who had collapsed crying behind the house, terrified he wouldn’t survive. For the first time since childhood—maybe even since before birth—he saw the world not through Venus’ eyes, but his own. He embraced his wife. He promised he would never leave her again.

And the others saw him vanish.

# Echoes

**King Hurion** had to abandon his beloved mecha *Bloodstorm*. The Black Sun was collapsing into a black hole—there would be no going back. But that didn’t stop the king from sending out every probe he could, searching for Hyperion’s trace.

The crew escaped aboard their battered ship, fleeing the dying star… into the future.

Most of them, at least.

**Chlodovík**, perhaps always knowing he didn’t belong to this world or this time, took his own life in his cabin. He had sabotaged his cloning system. He left behind a mystery—what role did the fae’s prophecy play? We may never know.

His last will left his estate to his new wife and her father. All his titles went to his unborn child.

# Epilogue

With the Malhamite Challenge overcome, the Empire of this parallel was blessed with victory and a new age of divine favor.

* **Chlodovík** was given a hero’s funeral.
* **Alder** became a full paladin of Saint Dreja, dedicating himself to his growing family and duties.
* **Xan** returned to his household and oversaw the burgeoning cult around his sainthood—along with some dice, and… other interests.
* **Erius** returned to his post in Hell. For his extraordinary deeds, the devils reduced his service by several months. With Alder’s support in the Avernus Fortress, it wasn’t quite so unbearable.

# The End

So ended the *Saga of Last Hope*.  
But the men who carried it?  
Their legend will never end.

Currently on week 3 of 60mg, began on 30mg

I’ve been on elvanse for just under 2 months and the difference I’ve found is ridiculous. Before starting them I had both family and friends warn me to be cautious, with a family member of mine having a bad experience with them so my expectations weren’t high. But I’ve found my experience to be the opposite and have been insanely productive, new found interests, completing projects and emotions all regulated! 

Although there were a few ups and downs in the beginning with feeling nauseous and dizzy and tight chest, these passed with time. 

That’s not to say I don’t have a few issues currently. I’ve lost some weight since starting the medication, 8kg, which on one hand is great and I feel a lot better in myself but can’t help but worry if it’s too much too fast. My appetite has been vastly different and around mid day I can’t bring myself to eat. However I am very active and since starting elvanse my need to stress eat has disappeared.

My blood pressure has also increased quite a bit too, resting heart rate increased. I’m just worried I won’t be able to stay on the medication long term if it keeps increasing. Especially because it’s helped so much in a short time.

Follow our protagonist on a journey of healing and found family, as well as terrifying and profound explorations of the nature of humanity and sentience.  Lieutenant Cruz will have to adjust to life in the sticks of the Jovian system, build relationships with her colleagues, and still manage her weekly caseload of digital crimes.  A.I.s and humans alike will feature prominently in a story where the characters must weigh the measure of non-human life.  And behind the innocent facade of this backwater mining port lurks something new and dark that's eating out the heart of Ursa Miner Station.

Be prepared for snark, LGBTQ+ themes, occasional violence, and lots of cyber-everything in a relatively hard sci-fi shell!

Setting: *This tale is set in the world of tomorrow; one shackled to the problems of today. A world bound by the laws of thermodynamics, where faster-than-light travel is the stuff of science fiction and teleportation is a mad fever dream. This story takes place in the next century, where late-stage capitalism and increasing reliance on genetic and cybernetic optimization has produced a mistrusted transhuman minority class. This is a world where the promise of a better tomorrow has been broken to pieces, where science couldn't lift humanity beyond our nature, or even beyond our solar system.*

*This is a setting where scientist Ray Kurzweil's 'law of accelerating returns' clashed with economist Jacques Turgot's 'law of diminishing returns' and lost, badly. This is a universe where, even as humanity invented better tools and thinking engines at ever faster paces, it bunched up against insurmountable bottlenecks in computation, molecular nanotechnology, and synthetic intelligence. The limits of our material science and engineering form a wall in the road to singularity. A wall that humanity runs into headlong, with a profound crash.*

*Moore's law peters out as transistors plateau at the size of atoms. Quantum computing, once hailed as the new savior of computation, increasingly peaks within the same order of magnitude as neurons. Experiments in growing neural networks beyond certain thresholds result in profound trans-human psychosis. Attempts to bootstrap AI into godlike intelligence either implode under their own complexity in spectacular examples of chaos theory made manifest, or else become so alien to baseline humanity as to appear functionally sociopathic.*

*Simply put, intelligence and computation hit local maximums. Peaks in optimization increasingly constrain human engineering. Within these bounds, technological advancement slows to a crawl. New substrate architecture or software code are the niches where creativity flourishes, but even these are merely shallow pools from which humanity desperately laps novel improvements. Commodification of new computing technology stalls out, and investments in future development are fraught with risk and low expectations of reward.*

*The result? Sluggish but inevitable system collapse. Where humanity previously surged from Earth on waves of subliminal chemical rockets and fusion engines, surfing the tsunami of accelerated scientific development, we now stagnate. The collapse of the tech bubble and the following economic crash precede years of armed conflict, leaving humanity scattered across the solar system in an aborted diaspora. In a society where life is cheap and everything else is expensive, an increasingly cyber-civilization wars with itself as unmodified humans retaliate against a future that left them behind.*

*This is a world in which technology has improved by leaps and bounds, but where people are still chained to the economic systems we 'enjoy' today. It's a world where unmodified (or 'baseline') humans find their abilities increasingly obsolete, and their skillsets ever less competitive in job markets filled with made-to-order AI. In this world, in defiance of the saccharine dreams of futurists and transhumanists and tech-cultists everywhere, utopia remains a fantasy. In a time when technology has advanced to the point of human-mind uploading and interplanetary travel, capitalism is still king.*

*The creaking, ad-hoc system flounders at the straining limits of its decaying reach. Oligarchs and mega-corporations feud over the isolated clusters of civilization among the void. A pseudo-government, formed to reign in the remnants of armed conflict and underground factions, finds itself policing a semi-lawless frontier beyond the core planets. Code Enforcement Officers desperately try to stem the tide of malware, hackers, and evolving synthetic life undermining the digital systems on which humanity relies. But don't worry; even in the darkness of the future, for the beleaguered digital cop, there will still be coffee.*",1,1751407344.0,Cyberpunk,0,1.0,False

Every so often, life can give us one of those sucker punches that plummet us into a funk. The aftermath can leave us feeling listless with no real desire to do much more than to curl up into a ball. Getting into a funk often happens when we least expect it or when we are ill prepared to deal with it. And, when it is left unchecked, we can spiral into a major bout of depression and despair.

**What can you do to refocus and renew from a devastating situation? How can you convert your negative emotions into more positive and productive ones?**

# Have Faith

Out of every challenging moment comes an opportunity for growth and renewal. While key times of the year like the new year or your birthday may motivate you to toy with self-improvement notions, your greatest positive changes often come from the hardest knocks in life. No matter how dark it may seem, have [**faith**](https://www.agegracefullyamerica.com/the-power-of-faith-insights-for-successful-living/) in your ability to overcome and prevail.

# Take Time to Reflect

Whatever sparked your funk, take time to evaluate and learn from this [**adversity.**](https://www.agegracefullyamerica.com/overcoming-adversity-how-to-rise-above-challenges/) As you go through your recovery, you will most likely be hit with a diverse range of emotions, including denial, anger, fear, resentment, helplessness, and sadness to name a few. Acknowledge these emotions. Give yourself time and space to delve into what just happened, how you felt about it, and what you might have done differently. Own up to the reality of the experience and embrace any lessons to be learned.

# Make a Commitment

You have choices. You can wallow in your negativity or choose to practice positivity. In all, getting out of a funk is up to you. Despite the sucker punch, catch your breath and take the necessary steps to move forward. So much more in life is awaiting you if you will only give it a chance.

# Be Good to Yourself

A key part of healing from a devastating experience is to [**take care of yourself.**](https://www.agegracefullyamerica.com/self-care-the-greatest-gift-to-yourself/) Be your best protection and avoid the negativity of people and situations that will only bring you further down.

Even when you least feel like it, get up, get dressed, and get going. Make it a point to do something small to get out of the house. This might include running an errand to the supermarket or the bank or meeting a friend for coffee.

**Take in the fresh air and sunshine.**

Use the natural benefits of air and sunlight to replenish your soul and revitalize your body. It’s amazing what a good walk in nature can do for your spirits.

**Give yourself time outs.**

Instead of keeping yourself so busy that you (hopefully) forget your woes, do the opposite. [**Take time for yourself.**](https://www.agegracefullyamerica.com/make-room-for-alone-time/) Set aside downtime to just breathe, meditate, and relax. It will be far more beneficial than stuffing your feelings that will most likely resurface at a later point.

**Take a trip.**

To clear your mind and gain a different perspective, take a fun trip to some place you have never visited before. Make it your adventure to explore new possibilities and to change up your story.

**Carve out time for exercise.**

Exercise relieves stress and improves moods. Do some sort of exercise each day to give yourself that emotional lift. Spending time walking, biking, running, working out at the gym, playing tennis or other such activities can make all the difference in the world for your mental outlook.

**Focus on positive affirmations.**

Transform your negative thoughts to positive ones by starting your day off right. Take a few moments each morning to acknowledge the good in life. Focus on your blessing, including your own exceptional talents and accomplishments.

**Go back to the basics.**

Eat healthy food, drink plenty of water, and get adequate sleep. To improve your emotional health, it is essential for you to take care of your physical well-being.

**Do something you love.**

Engage in fun activities that stimulate your mind and get your creative juices flowing. The excitement of doing something that is new, rewarding, and enjoyable can activate the feel-good chemicals in your brain.

# Refocus on the present:

Use this technique to relax and center yourself.

# Revitalize for a new tomorrow:

Be good to yourself.  Surround yourself with a select group of friends and family members who can offer you a blend of encouragement and support. Intentionally, let go of the past, live in the present, and make plans for a better future. The ultimate control of your journey rests with you, so make it one worth traveling.

I was given a pile of secondhand 100% polyester voile curtains, which have been sat in my studio/ shed for a month or two. Most are fine, a couple were falling apart. This last one, washed today, completely disintegrated and had a fair few of these little guys trapped in the header tape.

Hoping that they lived fulfilling lives and had passed on before I got the curtains, and we're all good.

But my concern's that if they were alive before the trip in the washing machine, that they might be harmful for other items in my shed.. especially if they're to blame for the state of this curtain.. I mean, who eats polyester?!?!

They're teeny (I guess 2/3mm), back kind of resembles a coffee bean.

1lpeidl,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/1lpeidl/i_forgot_how_to_date/,I forgot how to date,"I (30m) have huge difficulties getting into the game again. In the past I used to be the romantic type, in and out of relationships, but now after some heartbreak and long abstinence, I'm really struggling.

Some context, sorry if it gets long: 

I had a long relationship of 7 years which ended 5 years ago. Main reason was she moved to another country and I didn't come with her.
Back then she was the love of my life, we met back when we were both going to school, and it took me a very very long time to even think of trying to date again.

After it ended COVID happened, half a year later I tried Tinder and I even had Sex with someone, but I couldnt even finish as I felt like I was cheating on my ex-girlfriend.

I instead decided to focus on my studies, got a job and since then work and stuff was going great, but that's it. I let myself go, gained 30kg, have very little hobbies to pursue and from an outsiders point of view I would call myself overall quite boring.
Also what I noticed was, that I developed having very little emotion, be it joy or sadness. I felt quite hollow inside.

3 weeks ago I was at party from my volunteer work and got quite drunk. Another girl (23F) was also there who I knew from working together. The plan was after food and drinks to head in the city to find a party. I asked if she wanted to come too but she said she needs to go home first, but might come after.

I ended up with a guy in his appartment and I asked her if she wanted to come too, it was long past midnight, and she actually came. We were sitting on his couch, he was actually quite annoying and talked A LOT, and I was sitting next to her, when suddenly she started holding my hand.
In my drunk mind I didn't think much of it and when it came time to go home I offered if she wanted to split a cab.

So I ordered an Uber and while waiting for it, we started making out. So much that we didn't even see him standing right next to us and he called my phone to get our attention.

The cab ride was not very long, she got out with me and we again kissed on the street for a really long time until she headed home, sun came up and we both had things to do in a couple of hours.

When I woke up I couldn't realize what had happened. The following week I couldn't eat, hardly slept, always had butterflies in my tummy and I was furious I couldn't remember much from that evening except us kissing.

We planned to meet up the following weekend at a music festival in the city.

We hardly wrote with eachother but I think she is not that much of a writer and neither am I.

At the music festival we were walking around, watched a few bands and a bit later we went somewhere quiet to talk. We were sitting on the ground when she said she had a headache from the heat so I gave her a massage and we kissed again. From then on we were holding hands and I could sense that she really liked being next to me.
I brought her to the metro stop for her to get home and again, had a long kiss goodbye.

That was two weeks ago and I haven't seen her since.

At least the butterflies stopped being there all the damn time and I could finally focus on work again.

When we write she is very open and flirty. I suggest times to meet up but she said she doesn't want to go on a long date until her exams are over. So I suggested going for some coffee which she would like to do but still no date fixed yet.

Finally today I got some free tickets to a concert in 2 weeks and she agreed to come which I am looking forward to.

But until then I am really struggling what to do.
I just found out she got out of a relationship very recently, the ending was a bit messy as they lived together snd she moved in with her parents again. So maybe that's why she is a bit reserved?

She sometimes doesn't respond for hours and I get into a negative Spirale ""oh man she doesn't want to meet up anymore"" but don't do anything about it.
I dont know what to write to her.
I don't know how to catch her in some free time to go out for some coffee or ice cream or whatever.
I have no date ideas.

I would really appreciate some advice on the next steps and what your thoughts are on this situation is.


Omg this text got so long, I admire everyone who powers through it. And sorry it's not the best English, it's not my first language.


But to finish on something positive:
This first kiss woke me up again. Since then I groom myself more, I am much more active, going out with friends and doing sports. I feel emotions again. I feel alive again.
And even if it doesn't work out, I finally found the spark to better myself.",1,1751406509.0,dating_advice,1,1.0,False

The starting dose is 18mg so very low but there was no massive silence or emotional moment but there were changes and I’ve come to realise that I was literally riddled with adhd and never knew until 41 years old. 

From the first day the tablets have reduced my anxiety by 50%, that itself is so freeing. The constant running conversation intrusive thoughts in my mind haven’t stopped but they have dramatically reduced. When I speak to people I can actually focus on what’s being said and respond without thinking ‘ what should I say next ‘ no massive bursts of energy but tasks have become so easier as in ‘ I need to do …. I do it almost immediately and job done . 

I feel a little more confident in myself now I’m not constantly on edge or over thinking . Every day has been different in terms of how long it’s lasted but it has worked. 

I eat slower . Always have eaten fast so this I’ve enjoyed . I still feel hunger and eat but haven’t snacked or binged since I started that tablet . I have no urges to do it. 

I speak clearer and slower. I jump less in conversations. That makes me also feel more confident 

I’m calmer. I’ve felt happy each day. 

I did have a huge headache on the second day and for me I’m not stopping my x2 coffees each morning but I do make sure I have a protein breakfast 20g. No nausea no palpitations no blood pressure issues .

I know it’s early days . I almost worry what if today it doesn’t work?! 

I look forward to what 36mg will do when I increasing this weekend. 

While I didn’t have that magic emotional moment I have had many clarity moments of just how much adhd was affecting me and I didn’t even know I had it.

1lpefpp,https://www.reddit.com/r/CreepCast_Submissions/comments/1lpefpp/the_final_recital_finale/,The Final Recital (Finale),"Part 5 (Finale): Coda

Movement I: Fermata in Silence

The last echo of the broken note still clung to the rafters, even after Wellers had turned and walked away. I stood there, surrounded by emptiness. The chandeliers above no longer shimmered. The hush was heavier than silence, thicker than dust.

I looked out across the audience. The red velvet seats had returned to stillness. No more clawing shadows, no mouths stretched into forever. Just rows upon rows of perfect emptiness, as if no one had ever occupied them. As if the things I had seen, felt, feared… had never been here at all.

But one chair drew my eye.

Front row, center-left. Seat 7. Claire's seat.

No one sat there now. But the cushion bore the faintest indent, the shape of someone having sat with poise, stillness, care. Pressed into the velvet was a ghost of a presence, more intimate than anything else in the hall.

I stepped down from the stage, my hand trailing along the keys one last time. They were cold now. Lifeless. No voice left in them. Just polished wood and quiet dust.

Down the aisle I walked, past where the shadows once writhed. Towards the corridor Wellers had vanished into, the door parted just enough to suggest invitation.

As I walked through, the ground beneath my feet had begun to crack. Hairline fractures like veins in skin, running beneath the surface. The sconces lining the corridor flickered as I entered, not from power loss, but like they were deciding whether to stay.

I moved slowly. The hush of the hall followed me into the corridor, but here it was different—denser. Almost syrupy. Like I was walking into soundlessness made solid.

The corridor twisted subtly with each step, just wrong enough to feel it in my bones. Paintings lined the walls—portraits of men and women in recital dress, all expressionless. The further I went, the more warped their shapes became: limbs too long, necks too thin, eyes that didn’t point the same direction.

And then, I saw her.

Claire.

Or what looked like her.

She was seated in the painting, hands resting in her lap, dark hair tucked behind one ear, a blue dress like the one from the recital. But this wasn’t the frozen poise of performance. This was different. She was looking at me. No…through me.

The brushwork shimmered like wet paint. I stepped closer. Her eyes seemed to change as I did—widening, softening. There was recognition in them. Sorrow. I raised my hand, fingers trembling. I didn’t want to touch it. I just needed to see if she would stay.

I blinked.

She was gone.

The frame was empty. Just aged canvas now, the ghost of a portrait that hadn’t ever been. I stood in front of it for a long while, unable to breathe. Then I heard footsteps—soft, steady—from up ahead.

Wellers.

I turned and followed.



Movement II: A Door in the Score

I found him standing at the end of the corridor—motionless—his hands folded behind his back like a curator admiring a painting. Before him loomed a tall door of polished black wood, inlaid with a mirror that didn’t reflect a thing. No light, no room, no me. Just a yawning pane of stillness. Like it hated the concept of its existence.

He didn’t look at me when I approached.

“This is the quietest part of Bellmare,” he said softly. “She breathes slowest here.”

“What is this door?” I asked.

He tilted his head slightly, as if listening to some distant instrument tuning itself. “A mirror, Mr. Goodpray. But not to what’s in front of it.”

I stared at the door. It pulsed slightly. Like it was waiting.

“I have a question,” I said. “Back when I first arrived. The rooms without names. You said you preferred not to disturb them.”

“Wellers did say that,” he replied, tone mild. “A gentleman should never pry where he isn’t invited.”

“But what were they?”

He smiled faintly. “Rooms don’t like to be watched. Some contain echoes. Some… house rehearsals that never ended. Some doors open inward.”

He finally turned to look at me. “You’d be surprised what still lingers when the music stops.”

His eyes, dark and glasslike, held no warmth. But no cruelty either. Just something deep. Old.

“You talk like you’re part of this place,” I said.

“Wellers has been many things,” he answered, almost wistfully. “Concierge. Usher. Custodian. Mouthpiece.” He placed a hand gently on the doorframe. “But never the composer.”

“And who is?”

“The one who listens. Who gathers. Who waits for the final note to fall.” He glanced at me. “But not all music is meant for endings. Some… simply linger.”

My breath had fogged slightly, and I hadn’t noticed until now. The hallway behind us seemed longer than it should have been. Like we’d stepped outside of something. Or beneath it.

I touched the cold metal handle. It trembled faintly under my hand, though I couldn’t tell if it was my own pulse or the door’s.

“Wellers,” I asked, quietly. “Is there a way out?”

He regarded me. “That depends. Some find freedom in silence. Others in crescendo.” He paused. “But you, Mr. Goodpray—you’ve already given the performance. The question is what you do after the curtain falls.”

We stood before the mirror door. It didn’t show us. Just a pitch-black depth. Like staring into a river without bottom.

“Well then,” he said, and his voice barely rose above the breath of the hall. “Shall we proceed?”

I nodded, though everything inside me screamed not to.

And together, we stepped through.



Movement III: Recitativo

We didn’t step into a room. We stepped *out* of one.

Beyond the mirror, the world shed its shape. Not dark, not bright—just absence, stretched into suggestion. The corridor was gone, replaced by something less built and more remembered. Space didn’t hold here. The ground shifted and pulsed beneath us like walking on water. Walls curled like parchment soaked in time.

We were walking, but nothing moved.

Memories blinked into view, then vanished. A field I’d never walked in. A woman who looked like Claire but wasn’t. A recital hall where the ceiling bled stars. A cracked piano in an old train car. Children’s laughter from a mouthless choir. A woman playing a violin.

“None of this makes sense,” I muttered.

“Wellers never promised it would,” he said beside me.

“You aren’t Wellers.”

A pause. “No.”

I stopped. The air stood still. “Then what are you?”

He turned his face to me, and in the not-light of this place, it blurred slightly. Like a portrait not fully dried.

“I’m the third son of a man who plucked the stars,” he said softly, as if the words were old and tired. “I was composed before the bell was first struck. I listened. I learned.”

His voice was Wellers, but not *just* Wellers.

“Music was born to echo,” he said. “So I became echo. Song. Refrain. I learned to wear men like overcoats. They walked me into churches, into concert halls, into cities built on sorrow. I listened to their notes. I remembered them.”

“And Wellers?”

“He let me in,” the voice replied. “Long ago. In grief. In yearning. He wanted to remember something so badly that I stayed to help him.”

“What did he want to remember?”

There was a hush, like a page turning. “A girl with hair like copper chords. She played violin in the hollow before the Hollow.”

Silence settled. I didn’t push further.

We passed a window—though nothing lay beyond it—and in the ripple of its not-glass, I saw a painting. Claire’s face. Not her living face, but one painted by someone who missed her more than they understood her. She was smiling—but it wasn’t for me. Or maybe it was. I blinked, and the image evaporated. The world here didn’t hold its shape unless I looked at it.

“You said you listened,” I said again. “But why *me*? Why now?”

He didn’t stop walking. “Because you played.”

“That’s it?”

“You played the grief in your bones,” he said, almost gently. “And places like Bellmare remember songs like that. You gave your mourning shape. That makes you more than an audience.”

I wanted to be angry. But there was no room for rage here.

“Why didn’t you take me earlier?”

He turned his head just slightly. “You weren’t ready to let go.”

The path beneath us flickered like piano keys pressed by invisible fingers. Each step sounded not like footsteps, but notes played in a room with no walls.

“Is Wellers… still alive?” I asked.

“For a time. Long enough. He served the hall well. Carried its quiet for decades. A good host.”

“And now?”

A small smile touched the corner of Wellers’ borrowed mouth.

“He’s fading. The song is softer now.”

I swallowed the lump in my throat. “And Claire? The real Claire?”

A longer pause this time. The silence felt like a drawn breath just before the crescendo.

“She passed through,” the voice said. “But she was not taken. Some spirits write themselves louder than I can erase.”

I didn’t know whether to thank it or mourn again.

We walked a little farther, and the non-existent path finally formed into something definite. A door. Wooden, carved with a wreath of thorns around a single keyhole. No handle. No reflection.

The thing wearing Wellers looked at me.

“This next part,” he said, “you walk alone.”



Movement IV: Interlude for Two

I stepped through the door and into home.

The apartment smelled like rain and dust on the sill. It wasn’t just any place—it was ours. Claire’s scarf hung on the hook beside the kitchen. One of her books lay open on the coffee table, spine cracked in that same way it always had. The window was cracked an inch, the curtains breathing in and out like lungs trying to remember how. The walls were warm with afternoon gold. The kind that comes just before a storm, when the air thickens and memories slip through the cracks. I half-expected to hear the kettle whistle from the kitchen, or the soft thump of her feet padding across the floor.

Instead, there was only music.

It came from the piano, just out of view, in the far room. Gentle, slow. Each note held too long, like it didn’t want to let go.

I turned the corner.

And there she was.

Claire. Not in blue. Not in black. Not some twisted reflection from Bellmare’s throat. But her. Hair loose and dark, falling like a ribbon down her back. She wore an old grey cardigan with a hole in the sleeve. Her fingers moved across the keys with grace—not performance, not compulsion. Just music. Just being.

She didn’t look up, not at first.

I stepped closer. “Claire?”

She finished the song, let the silence land gently, then turned. Her eyes met mine. And for a moment, the ache in my ribs untwisted itself.

“Hi,” she said.

I couldn’t speak at first. My breath had caught somewhere between the years.

“I—I’ve missed you,” I managed.

“I know,” she said, and smiled, sad and warm. “I’ve been with you the whole time, you know. Even when you couldn’t see me.”

I knelt beside her, not daring to touch her.

“Was it all real? The Hollow, the hall, the music?”

Her eyes moved to the piano. “Some places are made from grief,” she said. “And some scores stay because we keep playing them.”

“I tried to save you.”

“I know,” she whispered. “But I didn’t need saving. You did.”

A silence hung between us like a last note waiting to fade. Her hand reached out—not to touch, but to hover just above mine, as if contact would break the illusion.

“You can let go now, Liam,” she said.

“I don’t know how.”

She blinked slowly, like a curtain falling.

“Then just *try*.”

I did.

And when I opened my eyes again, she was gone. The piano was empty, the keys still warm. The sunlight had dimmed, and the room had folded itself back into memory. As I stood, I felt the absence land quietly in my chest—not jagged like before, but soft. Bearable.

Behind me, a shadow crossed the doorway.

“Wellers,” I said.

He nodded once. The same suit. The same stance. But no smile.

“To leave,” he said, voice still too calm, “there must be a price.”

“I’ve paid,” I said, without hesitating. “I’ve played. I’ve wept. I’ve given her up.”

He tilted his head slightly, something ancient flickering behind his eyes.

“Yes,” he said, voice richer now, more layered—like a choir echoing inside his chest. “You have. And I do not keep what was freely given.”

He stepped aside, revealing a new door. One I hadn’t seen before, even in dreams. There was no sound behind it. No music. Just wind, and the scent of soil and ash.

“Wellers is resting now,” the voice added, quieter. “He heard enough songs for one life. Maybe too many.”

I looked back once more at the piano. The room. The absence. Wellers.

Then I walked through.



Movement V: Final Refrain

The door didn’t creak as it opened. It breathed—like something sighing its last.

I stepped through into air that was far too still.

The sky was grey, but not with storm or smoke. It was the kind of sky where the world forgets to turn. Dorset Hollow lay before me, or rather, what remained. The town had been consumed. Not freshly. This wasn’t the aftermath of a sudden fire. No—this had happened decades ago.

Charred timbers stuck out from cracked sidewalks like bones. Vines and ivy choked storefronts whose signs had long since faded to memory. The post office was caved in. The diner was gone entirely, only the metal skeleton of the *DIN(N)ER* sign left—its last flicker long gone.

The silence was total, but not empty. It felt cleared, like the stage had been finally struck after the final act. I walked through the ruins, boots crunching cinder and glass. No one followed. No voices, no notes. Just the wind.

I passed the statue—now collapsed, overgrown, eroded to the knees. No piano. No scarf. Just a stone base lost to time. But it was the church that stilled me.

Saint Cecilia’s stood at the end of the street like a forgotten sentinel. Its steeple was cracked, but not broken. Its sign hung crooked, the lettering barely legible.

*“Sing unto Him, ye who mourn.”*

The windows were blackened from the inside. Not just soot. Scorched glass, melted and warped, like they’d burned in a fire that never touched the rest of the building. And behind them, even in daylight, there was that same impossible glow. Like flames from a time far gone. I didn’t go inside. I just stood there a while. Not praying. Not asking. Just listening. And the church, mercifully, was silent.

I found my car where I’d left it. It shouldn’t have still been there, not after however many years had passed. But it was. Dusty, but intact. The keys laid on the hood.

The drive home was long, but uneventful. Roads uncoiled beneath my tires like ribbon being drawn back from something. Towns flickered past, alive and indifferent. Gas stations. Trees. Traffic lights. The world had kept going.

And now, so would I. 

When I stepped into the apartment, the scent of old life greeted me. Mail piled by the door. A coat left hanging. Silence. The same silence from Bellmare, but not possessed. Not suffocating. Just quiet.

I crossed the room, past where her photo still sat—framed in silver, smiling in spring. I didn’t touch it.

Instead, I went to the piano.

It had been under a sheet since the day I stopped playing. Not out of spite. Just… pain.

I took a breath, and peeled the cloth back.

Dust swirled, catching the amber light of the setting sun. The keys were yellowed slightly. The wood dry. But it was whole.

I sat down.

No voices whispered. No shadows reached for me. No notes forced themselves into my hands. Just silence.

I placed my fingers on the keys. And then, for the first time in years, I played.

Not for her. Not for anyone watching. Just to let something go.

The melody was soft, simple. I don’t even know where it came from. But it felt like closing a door.

When I finished, I left my hands resting on the keys.

In the hush that followed, I almost imagined I heard someone whisper “thank you.”

But no one was there.

And that was okay.

I'm hoping this post reaches people who either already meet up locally or would love to, but haven't found the right crew yet. Think of it as a club, collective, or even just a hangout that could occasionally turn into something more social (or romantic?) if the vibe’s right. No pressure, just connection.

If you're tired of big bar scenes and want something a bit more creative and grounded, let's start something better.

Drop a comment about what you're into, or if you already know of meetups in the area—I'm down to join or help start new ones. We can do public meetups in coffee shops, libraries, or safe shared spaces to start. Let’s get a mix of people who want fun, creativity, maybe even some sparks.

1lpedjl,https://www.reddit.com/r/CharlotteDobreYouTube/comments/1lpedjl/aita_for_reconsidering_my_relationship_because_my/,Aita for reconsidering my relationship because my partner is too frugal?,"I came to Reddit because I am at a loss for words for the umpteenth time with my currently relationship of a few years (off and on). I always listen to and watch Charlotte’s videos on YouTube, as it’s been a form of interpersonal therapy in a way. 

So here it goes: 
Aita for considering different routes in life as opposed to what my partner wants because they are too frugal? I “Billy” , and my partner “Mike”, have worked through many hurdles to make life happen together. Mike is too frugal in every sense of the word, both financially and emotionally. Where any suggestion they mention, is seen as the most beneficial for our future. However, anything I request or think of dreaming about, merely adds to the stress or pressure for him to perform…when he is battling his own inner qualms and trauma triggers. 

I am by no means a perfect individual, I do stress, become irritated, and have my own personal inner battles as well. I know love is a matter of perspective, choice, style, and commitment. However, I have come to consistently feel stifled, that my emotions need to be kept secret (even if he asks me to discuss them), in fear of how he may react or feel in response. Saying I love you is met with (too much, tone it down). Talking about simple treats like food or coffee is seen as a waste (unless he suggests it). Friendships are seen as a waste of time as they don’t contribute anything to our future together (unless they are friends who show up when it’s important).

I admit I am definitely a person who likes to indulge in simple pleasures like treats, or casual outings. But I by no means am irresponsible with my priorities. I work close to 60 hours weekly to support the home, works a full time job managing business platforms from home. 

I have no time to relax, because I am needed to also help when I get home to show support for the business (which I am happy to do). However, I Billy am consistently seen as triggering when I don’t immediately act, I.e take too long of a rest period. I have no days off unless I request them. 

He works very hard, sometimes way too hard at anything he does. I am happy that he puts so much passion into things. But we no longer do any of the things that brought us together over the years; from video games, to random treats at the store, as they are no longer a priority. 
Intimacy is another rocky path. I’m not insecure in the sense that I can’t handle a wandering eye or hypothetical hall passes. But when intimacy with me is feeling like a chore, and he is never in the mood….yet he can suggest potential fun with others regularly, while he isn’t in the mood to talk about giggity with me when I bring it up. I feel less than desirable. I constantly look at myself in the mirror and wonder what’s wrong with me, why am I not desirable? I don’t feel ugly, but I constantly feel I am not truly wanted… 

I always make him feel better about his self image that he harps on regularly, even if he is by no means unattractive… but he only shows interest when he has outside validation. Yet says my “need” to be around people and feel wanted has been the most harmful to our relationship. So I’ve distanced myself from any and all friends of many years…

I feel like I’m giving up my body quite literally, my heart, my mind, my work, my friends, my hobbies, all just to show him that I am all in this till the end… 

But I feel in the end, he will just never truly see me, only what he feels should be our priorities.

I apologize in advance for how chaotic this is worded. My mind has been racing. He does frequent Reddit, so it’s possible he will see this at some point; when that happens, it will truly be over. But either way, I no longer have the energy to do much living beyond work, or at all… I can’t save him, or myself from the heartache. Please be kind.

For a moment I forgot where I was. But after coming back to my senses, the air had changed. It was thicker—not because of humidity or heat, but like I was underwater. Sounds were muffled, my breath was slightly strained. I looked back out into Dorset Hollow, but it was still there. Silent, slow-moving, waiting. The streets were empty as always, but now—for some reason, I knew people were there. 



I walked past stores that sold nothing. A flowershop with dead tulips in the window, a tailor with no mannequins. Even a post office where mail slots were nailed shut. But then I saw it again.



The *DIN(N)ER* sign was flickering like it didn’t have anywhere more important to be. I walked in, if only for the sense of normalcy it would provide. That was naive of me. The same waitress stood—with the same cherry-red lips that her smile stopped at. 



I didn’t ask for any, but she poured me coffee. “Sleep well, honey?” she asked.



“Not really.”



She didn’t say anything to that, but placed a napkin near my cup. Someone had drawn some music notes on it in pen—the same three notes from my dream.



“You know this song?” I asked.



“It knows you.”



I didn’t ask her to explain.



I wandered deeper into town after I downed my coffee. The Hollow itself wasn’t big, but it was deep—like a painting where the shadows would lead you to another. Roads looped back onto themselves, houses kept repeating, but with slightly different, barely noticeable features when I passed them again. I tried to escape this town, just to see if I could, but every road led back onto itself and every sign became circular.



There were no cars, no wind, no animals. I was drawn by the smell of fresh bread to a bakery, but the door was locked. The sign outside simply wrote “Recital Tonight—7PM”



I passed a bookstore that I hadn’t noticed before, or maybe it just wasn’t there before. There was a single book displayed behind the window. Its title, in silver ink on a blue face, said “The Audience Remains”. 

I walked in. There was no bell, just a hush that sank into my soul. Sat on the counter was a woman who must have been the clerk. She didn’t react to my entry or presence.



The shelves were full of books that were bound in some strange leather. It was too dry, too smooth. Most of them had no titles. Some were filled with nothing but blank pages, some with nonsensical piano scores. I opened one and it had, written down to the very bottom of every single page:



LIAM GOODPRAY

LIAM GOODPRAY

LIAM GOODPRAY



I slammed it shut and looked up. The lady behind the counter hadn’t moved an inch, her back still turned to me. But then I noticed it. She was humming. The same three notes. I left before she could turn around.



I needed more coffee. So I went back to the diner. It was quieter now though, the indoor lights were dimmed slightly and the red glow of the *DIN(N)ER* sign was noticeably faded. The young man was sitting in his booth. Same flannel shirt and same thousand-yard stare. He nodded to me as I entered and then pointed to some kind of bulletin board near the register. 



“I didn’t know you were famous,” he said.



I looked. It was a recital poster. In an elegant, silver-penned script at the bottom was the Bellmare Hall crest. But the person on it wasn’t me. It was Claire.



She was mid-performance, at that same piano from the hall. Her black hair was tucked behind one ear on her tilted head. The dress she was wearing was the same blue as the flash I had seen yesterday in the concert hall. Her expression was the same one she had when she got lost in the music—poised, serene, beautiful.



But the date at the bottom of the poster, between the crest and the picture, read “March 3rd, 1953”.



“That’s not me,” I said, barely holding back tears.



The man simply looked at me and shrugged. “Sure looks like you buddy.”



I stared harder at the poster, and just for a second, I could see it. My hands on the keys, my face superimposed onto hers. But then it was gone. Just Claire again.



I blinked and some tears made their way through. “That’s not me. Just someone I knew. Someone who’s gone.”



He looked at me again, with no emotion behind it except maybe tiredness. “Lots of folks think they recognize someone in these old posters. Faces change, blurs overlap. But she’s always there, the lady in the blue dress. Always seated in the front row, always smiling like they’re playing a song that she composed.”



I stepped forward and had my face maybe a few inches away from the poster. More details emerged—details that shouldn’t have been there. A necklace I gave her on our third anniversary, a scar on her hand from that time she broke a plate.



“This can’t be real. She’s never been here. She wasn’t even born in the fifties.”



“Time’s funny in this town, especially around Bellmare,” the man said, looking at his coffee. “Sometimes it doesn’t flow, sometimes it sits still, waiting.”



“For what”



He took a sip of coffee. “You.”



I stepped out of the diner, my heart pounding in my chest like a wild animal in a cage, and my hands squeezed so tight it felt like I was holding glass. I didn’t know where I was going, but I just had to walk. 



A poster from 1953. With Claire on it. This had to be some twisted joke. A prank that the whole town was in on. But I couldn’t explain the necklace or the scar, or how her face almost became mine for a second. 



I kept walking. Went right past that damnable bookstore. I’m praying it gets burned to the ground. Right by those stupid houses. Shadows followed me in the windows like angels of death, but they would be gone once I looked at them. And the sun seemed to be setting, but only in the spots where I stood. Maybe I’m just going crazy.



I just kept walking. But then I noticed it—past the hollow buildings and shaded windows. A small church, rooted in ivy and fog. Its white steeple pointed heavenward. The door hung open, inviting me in. The sign out front was faded, but I still made out the lettering:



*Saint Cecilia’s—Est. 1897*



Beneath it, scratched into the wood:



*“Sing unto Him, ye who mourn”*



I stepped inside. The temperature dropped immediately. It wasn’t just cool, it was freezing, like an arctic crypt. I could even see my breath. The air smelled like damp wood and it had a sharp, metallic undertone that I couldn’t make out. The interior was dimly lit, but it was still intact—untouched by time. Pews were lined up like a tightly-knit army and a simple altar stood at the opposite end of the door. A modest piano sat to the side of it, much different than the one in Bellmare. This one didn’t seem to be calling me to play. 



On the walls were stained-glass windows, but the colors seemed too dark. I thought it was just dust, but then I noticed that there was no sunlight behind the glass, despite the fact that it was the afternoon. It was more like they reflected the glow of a dying blaze: strong, impactful, but otherwise ending.



I moved further in. The floor creaked sadly beneath my feet, as if it was mourning itself. On top of the pews, candles were lit, leaking wax down the wood—leaving fresh impressions upon the cushions. There wasn’t a soul in sight, but I saw the hymnal. It laid upon the altar, pages yellowed and stained. One stood out—fresh ink was written on it, blacker than black. It read:



*“Requiem for the Empty: For the grieving and the chosen”*



Beneath that title was a list of names. A couple dozen perhaps. They didn’t mean anything to me, after all, they were just names. But then I noticed the dates beside them. They ranged from the early 1900s all the way up to 2018. Each had a title.



*“Harold Carr (1902)—Died during performance”*

*“Benjamin Mandol (1907)—Checked in, hasn’t checked out”*

*“Jonathan Bale (1912)—Playing still”*



And right there at the very end:



*“Claire Halden (2018)—Admitted. Not recovered”*



I stared in shock. This couldn’t be the same Claire. My Claire. Halden was her last name, but this is impossible. Then I noticed something off about the page. It was strangely warm. I turned around without even thinking. Nothing behind me but the dripping wax. But then I saw the floor.



The impressions of bare footprints on the dust led from the altar to some corner in the back near the confessionals. I followed. The door of the booth was open, just a bit. I didn’t step in—I couldn’t. Not when I saw what was scratched onto the inside of the door:



*“It’s not her. Not really”*



Then from behind me, where the piano lay—three haunting notes. 



That was enough. I left quickly. Not running though, I didn’t want to feel like prey, but every step had more effort put into it than the last. I eventually had to force myself to go further, like something behind me was forcing me to stay. I didn’t look back, not even once.



Back in town, the sky had dimmed. It wasn’t sunset, not yet, but the light was dying. Shadows stretch farther than they should have been able to. A nearby clock read 4:22 p.m, but I don’t think time was behaving correctly anymore. I passed the town square and noticed a statue. It wasn’t a war memorial or a founder’s statue or anything. It was a man seated at a piano. His arms stretched and bent wrong, fingers melted into the keys. No name or plaque adorned it, but wrapped around his throat like a noose was a blue scarf. And a lavender bouquet laid at his feet. I continued onward.



I made it back to the hall just after 5:00 p.m. The doors were already open, beckoning to me. Inside, the chandeliers were lit, and the air held a hush—like an auditorium right before a conductor lifts their baton. Mr. Wellers stood waiting in the lobby, same suit, same smile. 



“You’ve seen her, haven’t you?” he asked. The way he said it was too casual, like he’s said it a thousand times before.



“I’ve seen…something,” I replied.



“Mr. Wellers finds that it often helps to look,” he said, hands folded. “But not too long. Reflection is a doorway, Mr. Goodpray. But some doors, once opened, don’t shut.”



I stared at him. “You speak like a preacher. Or maybe like…something else is speaking for you.”



His lips curled ever so slightly, into something not quite a smirk. “Wellers is but a humble mouthpiece,” he replied. He then paused, tilted his head, and stared right through my soul. And then, in a voice not his own, “But the tune is me.”



Nope. That’s it. That’s the line. I backed away, but he didn’t move, didn’t follow. He just bowed his head.



“You should rest,” he said, his voice back to his Louisiana tone. “The performance begins at seven sharp.”



I tried to go to my car, but my legs had other ideas—pretty soon, my brain followed their lead. Instead, I climbed the stairs back to my room. The passage there seemed longer than before, deeper even. My door was open even though I distinctly remember closing it. Inside, a suit was laid on the bed. Black cashmere and silk, cleanly pressed, spotless. Under the amber lights, it shimmered like the night sky. Beside it lay a single lavender and a slip of paper. I picked it up. In the same damn handwriting as the letter that started this whole mess, it read:



*“Bellmare Presents: One Night Only*

*Liam Goodpray, Pianist*

*Those who play, remain”*



Outside, I heard the wind whisk their way through the branches, like whispering voices. And beneath it, music. It wasn’t a melody I knew, but one I could understand. It had a purpose. Shape. But then, it exploded from everywhere. The bed, the desk, the walls, even the windows. I leaned closer to one, drawn in like a sailor to a siren. A reflection began to form in the glass, but it was not my own. 



Claire. In that blue dress, sitting in the front row of the concert hall, just as the young man said. Through the reflection, her eyes met mine. She was smiling—not kindly, nor cruelly. Just knowingly. And then, a nod.



The clock in the wall struck 6:55. I reached for the suit.



Time to play.

I went decaf for 1,5 year. My migraine went from 6 attacks per year (I´ve tracked since 2020) to 0 attacks. Also, my teeth grinding at night stopped and I don´t experience bite marks on the inside of my cheeks anymore. Before skipping caffeine, it used to be a bit painful waking up all groggy and heavy with a light headache. It usually disappeared before the first cup of coffee and I also got so used to it that I didn´t truly realize how I felt before I suddenly felt better and lighter.

My daily intake before quitting was 1 and sometimes 2 cups in the morning, and with occational diet coke. After quitting, my intake was very occasional, maybe 1-2 cups of coffee or cokes per month. I always felt the highs and never any side effects. Back then I didn’t know that chocolate contains caffeine, but I started buying chocolate more often instead of savory snacks :-)  

**Serious Withdrawel symptoms**

Then one year ago I slowly increased my intake of coke and coffee as well as adding energy drink, summing up to 2-3 times per week. None of the above positive health effects vanished and I honestly thought I was not addicted… From coffee including decaf I got a bit of shaking everytime I drank it. This did not happen with coke or energy drinks.

This whole year, however, I have been seriously tired, brain fogged, my body felt like lead, sooo heavy and weighted down, difficulties to read in the morning (like when I have had a migraine attack) and I have taken long naps every single day, some times several naps that did not freshen me up what so ever.  I went to my doctor who took me very seriously and ran multiple blood tests all showing absolute healthy results. During the six Winther months I also got sick with fever etc. 14 times, and I am usually never ever sick. So six months after my first appointment I went to see the doctor again, complaining about the insane exhaustion and now adding that I feel depressed. This time I was absolutely not taken seriously, since I had just become pregnant which usually leads ti increased tiredness. The blood samples were however run again with same results as last time.  

I have occasionally consulted Chatgpt who suggested that my symptoms could be severe withdrawal symptoms. While I accepted that it may be part of the problem, I did for some reason never realize that it was the root cause of my severe health issues. On the contrary, I thought I was dealing with the exhaustion by accepting to drink caffeine once in a while.

The penny dropped 2 weeks ago, when I got severe hangover the day after drinking 1 energy drink (no alcohol) and 2 cokes. And the following days were hell. Haven´t gotten ANY caffeine or decaf coffee for 1,5 weeks now, and this is the first time IN A YEAR that I feel like myself. Actually the same energy and productivity everyday as if I had been drinking energy drink.

Before we moved she got a painting when clearing out one of her friend's basements. She kept it in our living/dining room space and said she would hang it up. She never got around to it but I just kind of assumed it was because we were moving soonish and she didn't want to go through the hassle of hanging it up, taking it down, then hanging it up again when we moved. 

When we moved to our current place we were both slow with unpacking - I definitely left some boxes out for a month or two before getting around to them. When I went home in December I asked my roommate to deal with her stuff that was still in the shared space since it had been nearly four months by then. When I came back all of it was gone except for one bin and her painting, which she said she was going to hang up but hadn't gotten around to yet. Later in the year (I honestly can't remember when) I asked her about it again and she said she was going to hang it up when her LD boyfriend visited (he had already visited like 4 times and he's visited I think twice since she said that.)

Last week I finally snapped and asked her when she was going to move her last bin, the painting, and her suitcases that had been there for a month. She said she'd move the bin and throw out the suitcase but wanted to keep the painting in the common room. I was surprised because she said she was going to hang it up for a year at this point and when she asked if I was okay I reflexively said yes to avoid a fight. It's been a week and I'm realizing I don't like it. It's an imitation painting of Blue Monday and it's honestly kind of depressing to look at first thing when you wake up. I feel slightly bad but frankly I don't like the painting and at this point I feel like I've built up some aversion to it as a symbol of her treating our common area like a storage closet. I don't understand what she wants for the space since we only brought 4 chairs and a coffee table (both of which she wanted to get rid of) and has had an aversion to buying furniture.

# 

Have you ever wondered why everyone from fitness influencers to busy parents is obsessing over this simple breakfast dish? The **Chia Seed Pudding Recipe** has quietly become the go-to morning meal for those seeking both convenience and nutrition.

This isn't just another health trend that'll disappear in a few months. This pudding represents a perfect marriage of ancient wisdom and modern nutritional science, delivering sustained energy and incredible health benefits in every spoonful.

What makes this breakfast so special isn't just its nutritional profile – it's the creamy, satisfying texture that rivals any indulgent dessert, while actually nourishing your body from the inside out.

# Ancient Seeds, Modern Superfood Status

The story behind the **Chia Seed Pudding Recipe** takes us back thousands of years to the heart of ancient Mesoamerica. The Aztecs and Mayans didn't just eat chia seeds – they considered them sacred fuel for warriors and messengers.

The word ""chia"" actually comes from the ancient Mayan word for ""strength."" These tiny seeds were so valued that they were often used as currency and offered to the gods during religious ceremonies.

# Historical Significance:

* Aztec warriors sustained themselves on chia during long battles
* Mayan runners carried chia seed mixtures for endurance
* Ancient civilizations recognized chia's ability to provide lasting energy
* Seeds were traded as precious commodities across empires

Fast forward to today, and science has proven what these ancient cultures intuitively knew – chia seeds are nutritional powerhouses packed with omega-3 fatty acids, fiber, protein, and essential minerals.

# The Science Behind the Perfect Texture

Creating the perfect **Chia Seed Pudding Recipe** isn't as simple as mixing seeds with liquid and hoping for the best. The magic happens at the molecular level, where the seeds' unique properties transform your mixture into creamy perfection.

Chia seeds contain mucilaginous fiber, which means they can absorb up to 12 times their weight in liquid. This creates that signature gel-like texture that makes the pudding so satisfying and filling.

[**Ready to master the perfect texture technique? Get the complete Chia Seed Pudding Recipe here →**](https://nyrecipefood.com/chia-seed-pudding/)

But here's where most people go wrong – they don't understand the timing, ratios, and techniques that separate a mediocre pudding from an absolutely divine one.

# Texture Secrets That Make the Difference:

* Optimal seed-to-liquid ratios for different consistencies
* The critical resting periods for proper gel formation
* Temperature considerations that affect final texture
* Mixing techniques that prevent clumping
* How to achieve restaurant-quality smoothness at home

# Quality Ingredients: The Foundation of Excellence

Not all chia seeds are created equal, and this distinction can make or break your pudding experience. The source, processing method, and storage of your chia seeds directly impact both nutrition and texture.

# What to Look for in Premium Chia Seeds:

* Organic certification ensuring no pesticides
* Uniform size and color indicating quality sourcing
* Proper packaging that maintains freshness
* Clear origin information from reputable suppliers
* Seeds that expand consistently when hydrated

The liquid you choose is equally important. Whether you prefer plant-based milk, dairy, or even coconut water, the fat content and temperature affect how the seeds absorb and create that perfect creamy consistency.

# Beyond Basic: Understanding the Nutritional Powerhouse

The **Chia Seed Pudding Recipe** isn't popular just because it tastes amazing – it's because it delivers sustained energy that keeps you satisfied for hours. Unlike sugary breakfast options that cause energy crashes, this pudding provides steady fuel throughout your morning.

# Nutritional Benefits That Keep You Coming Back:

* Complete protein with all essential amino acids
* Omega-3 fatty acids for brain and heart health
* Soluble fiber that supports digestive health
* Calcium, magnesium, and phosphorus for bone strength
* Antioxidants that fight inflammation

The slow-release energy from chia seeds means you'll avoid the mid-morning energy dip that sends most people reaching for another cup of coffee or sugary snack.

# Mastering the Art of Flavor Balance

Creating an exceptional **Chia Seed Pudding Recipe** requires understanding how flavors develop and intensify over time. The beauty of this breakfast is how simple ingredients can create complex, satisfying taste profiles.

The key lies in layering flavors and understanding how different ingredients interact with the chia seeds' natural nutty taste. Some additions complement the earthiness, while others provide bright contrast that makes each bite interesting.

# Making It Work for Your Lifestyle

The genius of this recipe isn't just in its nutrition – it's in how perfectly it fits into modern life. Busy mornings become stress-free when your breakfast is already prepared and waiting in the refrigerator.

# Lifestyle Benefits:

* Prep multiple servings in advance
* Customizable to dietary restrictions
* Portable for on-the-go mornings
* Kid-friendly when made with the right techniques
* Budget-friendly compared to other superfood options

# Common Mistakes That Ruin the Experience

Many people try making chia pudding once, get disappointing results, and give up entirely. The truth is, there are specific techniques that separate success from failure.

Understanding the timing of when to add different ingredients, how long to let the pudding set, and which mixing methods prevent common texture problems makes all the difference between a gritty disappointment and a creamy delight.

# Your Path to Pudding Perfection

Ready to transform your mornings with this ancient superfood made modern? The complete recipe includes exact measurements, timing guides, and professional tips that guarantee perfect results every time.

Don't let another morning pass by settling for empty calories or skipping breakfast entirely. Your body deserves the sustained energy and incredible nutrition that only a perfectly crafted chia seed pudding can provide.",1,1751406014.0,u_RecipesSalma,0,1.0,False

We’re a group of five visiting Athens for the first time this July. After spending days deep-diving into Reddit, blogs, and travel sites and refining everything with the help of ChatGPT I’ve built a detailed itinerary that blends cultural highlights, chill time, and some classic Greek food into a hopefully fun, scenic, balanced experience.

We’ll rent a car from Monday morning to Thursday evening (Aramis Athens, FDW included, 180€ - any red flags here?).

A few things I’m still unsure about:

* **Aegina vs Hydra**: I picked Aegina for proximity and price, but still not 100% sure it was the right call.
* **Delphi**: It looks interesting but adds 5+ hours of driving. Could squeeze it into Thursday instead of a relaxed day in Athens, but not sure it’s worth it.
* **Any local insights on can't-miss spots or hidden gems** (churches, food, scenic places)?
* Any tips regarding the weather and how to deal with the high temperatures at the moment?

Would love your feedback. Anything from logistical issues to “you *have* to try this spot” is super appreciated!

Thanks in advance and happy to share the final version if anyone’s planning a similar trip. 😊

1lpe6st,https://www.reddit.com/r/PCOS/comments/1lpe6st/metformin_changed_my_life/,Metformin changed my life!,"I see alot of negativity about metformin on here, so I thought I'd share my success with it. I've only been on it for two or three weeks, yet I've noticed pretty drastic positive changes. 

The first, is that it eliminated my extreme hunger. For about a year, I've been constantly thinking about food. The only time I felt full was when I literally ate so much I felt sick. Every day felt like a battle, I'd be walking to the kitchen and back to my bedroom, pacing as I tried to resist the urge to eat. I found a few things that kinda helped, like berberine and my ADHD medicine. But still, both didn't really help that much. I still would be constantly thinking about food. But now, I feel like my appetite is normal again. Food no longer is taking over my life and every waking thought. 

The second, and most important thing is that it drastically improved my energy. Before I got on it, I was largely bedbound or housebound. I spent most of my time lying in bed doing nothing. When I want to hang out with friends, I would normally need to drink coffee just to be able to do it. I'd start getting super out of breath just walking short distances. But ever since I got on the metformin things have been very different! I walked 4 miles the other day after not walking that much for almost a year, and only needed one day to recover (normally doing that would cause me to need weeks or even months to recover). I'm able to get up to 15 minutes exercise almost every day for the past two weeks. And also, I'm able to just do so much more with my day in general. Like, I've been able to cook and do chores and keep up with basic hygiene alot easier now that this fatigue has somewhat lifted. 

I'm now super excited for the future. While I still am fatigued more than the average person I feel like I will finally be able to live a life that's more worth living. And, I wanted to share this story because I know there is alot of negativity about metformin or drugs in general on here. The stomach side effects can be pretty intense, but at least for me they have started to go away. I thought I'd just offer another perspective. ",5,1751405736.0,PCOS,0,1.0,False

My heart rate gets rapid, I can feel my face burning and my palms get sweaty, and I have an internal battle fighting over whether I should speak or not. Either I decide against it, or by the time I've decided I should speak the conversation has moved on so I then decide against it again. On the very rare occasion when I do pluck up the courage, I can hear my voice shaking and I sometimes struggle to properly formulate sentences or project my voice so that people can actually hear me.

This mostly happens at work in meetings but also during casual conversations during coffee breaks. It's got to the point where I don't join the coffee breaks anymore because that's less embarrassing than going but sitting there and not saying a word. 

The odd thing is that I wouldn't say I get overly anxious about doing presentations or having to speak in front of people when I've been explicitly asked to, it's more speaking spontaneously that I really struggle with.

I think a lot of this stems from thinking I'm going to say something stupid, or not 'knowing' anything about the topics being discussed, as in I don't share many interests with my colleagues. I guess I don't feel like I belong at my work and therefore don't want to draw attention to myself.

On the day of my coming-of-age ceremony, my two brothers brought home a seven-year-old orphan girl.

For her, my eldest brother slapped me across the face.

My second brother shouted at me in fury, “Get out! Don’t ever come back!”

I said nothing. I picked up my suitcase and left.

They thought I was just throwing a tantrum and would come back after a few days.

Enjoying the rare peace and quiet, the two of them took that orphan on a trip abroad—to Norway, the place I had always dreamed of visiting, just to see the Northern Lights.

Many days later, when they finally returned, they were shocked to learn that I had joined a ten-year closed medical research program.

I could never go home again.

That night, everything fell apart for them.

…

The day I booked my one-way ticket just happened to be Easter.

Dr. Vale walked me out of the research institute and gently reminded me, “You’ll depart in seven days. Willa, if there’s anyone you can’t let go of… say proper goodbye to them.”

Spring had reached Nordland, but the air was still bitterly cold.

I stood on the side of the road for a long time.

In the end, I pulled out my phone and called my brother, Jude.

After all, we had been siblings for over twenty years.

No matter how badly things had turned out, we should at least share one final meal.

But he declined my call several times, and eventually, he just shut off his phone.

Bracing myself, I dialed Ethan, my eldest brother.

This time, after a long wait, he finally picked up—reluctantly, like he was granting me a favor.

Afraid he’d hang up, I instinctively spoke faster: “It’s Easter today. Could we… maybe have dinner together at home?”

Then I remembered the housekeeper had taken leave to go home for the holiday, so I quickly added, “I’ll make the chocolate. Strawberry-flavored… Melody likes that.”

Melody was the orphan girl my brothers had adopted.

His voice on the other end was cold and impatient.

“Thanks to you, Melody is still in the hospital. What makes you think you deserve an Easter dinner with us?”

I pretended not to hear the disgust in his tone.

“Then maybe… I could bring the chocolate to the hospital? We could eat together there?”

I had never spoken so humbly before.

Ever since Melody came into our lives, Ethan, Jude, and I had been fighting for years.

Even at the worst of times, I had never bowed my head.

But this time…

Maybe this goodbye would be forever. None of us knew if we’d ever see each other again.

He didn’t respond.

After a long silence, it was Melody’s soft, childlike voice that broke the tension: “Willa’s strawberry chocolate made tastes really good.”

I replied immediately, “Then I’ll make some and bring it over.”

Afraid they’d change their minds, I hung up before they could say anything else.

Chapter 2

After hanging up, the wind stung my eyes.

I bought ingredients on the way home, rushed to make the chocolates, packed them into a box, and hurried to the hospital.

There was only a small dining table in the room—barely enough to fit three people if they squeezed in.

Ethan looked up at me.

Before he could say anything, I set the box down and quietly took a seat by the window.

Out of the corner of my eye, I saw him pause for a moment in surprise.

But it only lasted a second.

Soon, he went back to unwrapping a piece of chocolate for Melody.

The chairs were hard, so Jude grabbed a pillow to place behind Melody’s back.

She was young and loved sweets. She stuffed several strawberry chocolates into her mouth in a row.

Eating too fast, she started coughing softly.

I couldn’t help glancing over.

Jude immediately began patting her on the back.

Ethan quickly stood and poured her a glass of warm water.

They scolded her gently, pretending to be stern, “Slow down—who’s even fighting you for it?”

It was such a familiar scene.

Except the one sitting in Melody’s place used to be me.

I was lost in that moment and forgot to look away.

Ethan handed Melody the glass of water. Perhaps sensing my gaze, he looked over.

The warmth and concern in his eyes vanished the instant they met mine, turning cold.

Honestly, it stung more than I expected.

I quickly lowered my head and stuffed a piece of chocolate into my mouth.

But it caught in my throat, and I couldn’t stop coughing.

Ethan said indifferently, “Should I pour you a glass of water too?”

Something tightened in my chest. I forced myself to stop coughing.

Soon, the warm harmony among the three of them filled the room once again.

Melody ate happily, then spoke in her muffled little voice: “Last week in literature class, we learned about the Northern Lights. They say you can see them in Norway in winter. When I grow up, I want to go see them!”

Ethan patted her head. “Why wait till you grow up? It’s no big deal. We’ll go this year.”

Jude chuckled. “Ethan and I both have vacation time at the end of the year. We’ll take you.”

My hands trembled slightly and I nearly dropped the chocolate on the floor.

Their conversation was so lively that in less than thirty minutes, they had even booked their plane tickets.

Melody was thrilled. She bounced excitedly into Ethan and Jude’s arms.

After a while, she seemed to remember I was still sitting there. She tilted her head and asked, “Sister, do you want to come too?”

I remembered I had to leave and figured I should at least tell Ethan and Jude.

So I said casually, “No. In a few days, I’ll be traveling far away with Dr. Vale…”

Ethan interrupted impatiently, “There’s no need to tell us these things.”

I was planned to tell them that I might not be coming back for a long time, but as these words reached my lips, I swallowed them back down.

Then Ethan turned to me again, as if something had occurred to him.

“Melody wants to be discharged tomorrow.

“She was hurt because of you, so it’s inconvenient for her to stay elsewhere. I was planning to ask the housekeeper to prepare a guest room…”

Before he could finish, I spoke quietly, “She can have the master bedroom. I’ll move out.”

Ethan fell silent mid-sentence.

It was as if he hadn’t heard me right.

He stared at me for a long moment, disbelief written all over his face.

“…What?”

Chapter 3

Jude froze for a moment, then frowned.

He probably thought I was just being petty, so his tone turned impatient.

“You don’t have to do this. We know how small-minded you are. Once Melody’s better, she’ll move back out.”

I looked at them seriously. “Let her move in. She’s still young and needs looking after. It’s troublesome for you both to keep running around. Besides, I haven’t stayed at home much these past few years. The master bedroom suits her better—”

Bang.

Ethan suddenly tossed the food box onto the coffee table. The sharp thud cut my words off.

His expression had turned grim, clearly thinking I was just putting on a show again.

Melody yawned after finishing her meal and asked Ethan to read her a bedtime story.

Jude began tidying up the table.

Ethan helped Melody lie back in bed, grabbed a storybook, and sat beside her to read.

Just like all those countless times over the years—I became the outsider once more.

I stood, picked up my bag from the chair, and said, my throat aching slightly, “I’m heading out.”

No one responded.

Jude quietly wiped the table, and Ethan continued reading in a gentle voice.

As I walked past Ethan on my way to the door, his gaze stayed on the book, his head lowered.

I couldn’t see his face, couldn’t read his expression.

Right before stepping out of the room, I caught the last line he read: “And so, Snow White was cast out of her home...”

Suddenly, I remembered all those years ago, when our parents had died so suddenly in the fire.

Ethan had held me tightly, his eyes red with grief.

He had used that same warm voice, trembling as he comforted me: “You still have me and Jude. As long as we are here, Willa will always have a home.”

Liar.

My nose stung unexpectedly.

That night, I rushed back to college and buried myself in the lab, trying to wrap up the experiment I had been working on.

Only seven days left.

Within those seven days, I needed to finish everything related to both my studies and personal affairs in Nordland.

I worked through the night.

The next morning, I took a short nap, then returned home.

I had to clear out the master bedroom for Melody.

As I packed in the guest room, the housekeeper muttered angrily while helping me fold the bedsheets.

“How can the real owner end up in the guest room, while someone outside the family takes the master bedroom?”

I began packing books and clothes into suitcases and answered quietly, “It’s fine. I won’t be staying much longer anyway.”

Just then, a cold voice spoke behind me.

“Where are you planning to go?”

Chapter 4

I turned around.

Ethan had appeared at some point and was now standing behind me, his expression icy. His gaze landed on the suitcase I had just packed.

Jude leaned against the doorframe, his face equally cold.

Melody had followed them in, staring intently at my suitcase.

She was still young—too young to hide her emotions. The flicker of hope in her eyes was plain to see.

For a brief moment, I almost told them the truth.

But then I remembered Ethan’s impatient remark: “You don’t need to tell us these things.”

And suddenly, I didn’t dare to say anything more.

If I left without telling them, at least I could pretend that they didn’t know, not that they didn’t care.

In my coat pocket, my hand clenched so tightly that my knuckles ached.

I forced a casual tone. “Just moving things to another room. We agreed Melody would have the master bedroom.”

Ethan’s expression softened a little.

But then his voice turned heavy again. “Melody wouldn’t have to live here, if you haven’t shoved her down the stairs just a few days ago. Do you think we’d actually feel safe letting her live under the same roof as you?”

I instinctively replied, “Then I’ll move back to campus.”

Whatever softness had crept into Ethan’s expression vanished in an instant.

I really hadn’t meant to provoke him.

I just didn’t want to cause them more trouble before I left.

Melody blinked, looking innocent. “But this is your room, sis. I can’t take it.”

I spoke calmly. “Don’t worry. Once I leave, I won’t come back.”

Melody’s lips curled up before she could stop herself.

Realizing her mistake, she quickly lowered her head, guilt flickering in her eyes.

Ethan snapped, “Who do you think you’re threatening?”

Jude sneered. “Move out if you want. No one’s begging you to stay.”

I said nothing more and turned back to my packing.

After more than twenty years in this house, there was just too much left behind.

I couldn’t take everything, so I only chose the essentials—and the things my parents had left me.

By the time I finished, I had filled two large suitcases.

Dragging them behind me, I headed for the door.

Ethan’s furious voice rang out behind me: “If you’ve got the guts, then don’t ever come back!”

I dragged the heavy suitcases down the stairs and stepped outside the front door.

Behind me, Ethan’s voice followed, bitter and angry: “After all these years of drama, maybe now we’ll finally get some peace. Just don’t come crawling back after three days like you always do!”

I had planned to grab an umbrella.

But those words caught in my throat, so I stepped straight into the downpour.

The rain came down so hard, I was soaked in seconds.

By the time I reached the front gate, the rain had blurred my vision completely.

And Ethan’s raised voice still echoed behind me: “From now on, whoever dares to let her back in—can leave with her!”

Chapter 5

My eyes were so blurred I couldn’t open them.

For a moment, I couldn’t tell if it was rain or tears.

My clothes were soaked through, and red had begun to seep from my sleeve.

It was probably from the scabbed wound on my arm tearing open again when I had dragged the suitcase downstairs.

But I didn’t feel any pain—just a numbness spreading through my whole body as I pulled my luggage out of the neighborhood.

At this hour, I wasn’t sure if the dormitory gates at college would still be open.

In truth, I didn’t even know where I was going.

Melody came running after me, crying in a deliberately exaggerated voice, “Sister! Sister!”

Then I heard Ethan’s anxious voice trying to stop her.

“Don’t you know your own condition? What if you catch a cold in the rain?”

For a second, I almost thought he was talking to me.

In that brief moment of confusion, I faintly heard the words that followed: “Jude, tell the housekeeper to warm some milk for Melody.”

I tugged at the corners of my mouth, wanting to laugh but unable to.

Maybe it was because I had barely slept last night and had rushed over this morning to pack.

And now, after getting drenched in the rain, my vision darkened.

Just as I was about to collapse, a strong hand caught me.

At the same time, the rain that had been pouring down on me suddenly stopped.

I struggled to lift my head, and after a moment, I finally made out who it was—it was Farell, a senior from same academy.

His car was parked just ahead in the downpour.

Without saying a word, he took the suitcase from my hand and tossed it into the trunk.

Ethan sneered coldly behind me. “Leaving so decisively... turns out you’ve got quite the backup now.”

He must have followed me just to watch me struggling in this mess.

Farell took one look at me, drenched and pathetic, and his expression turned furious. He spoke up in my defense.

“With brothers like that, why even bother acknowledging them? You’re leaving in a few days anyway—”

I panicked and cut him off quickly. “Farell!”

He finally fell silent.

He opened the car door and shoved me inside without giving me a choice.

Out of the corner of my eye, I saw Ethan’s face darken in an instant.

“Farell, what are you trying to do?”

Farell sneered, his voice full of contempt. “You’ll figure it out soon enough.”

My heart leapt into my throat.

Ethan stood frozen in place, unable to react for a long moment.

By the time the car was about to leave, he finally rushed forward to pull open my door.

But Farell had already climbed in and locked the car with one swift motion.

Through the rain-splattered window, I could barely make out Ethan’s lips as he shouted: “Willa, get out of the car!”

His expression was full of anger, but there was something else mixed in too—something I couldn’t quite understand.

I only knew that by now, my leaving probably meant nothing to him.

Not to him, and not to Jude either.

I closed my eyes and refused to look at him again.

The car pulled away, and in the rearview mirror, Ethan remained standing in the rain for a long, long time.

Farell was still furious as he drove. “They threw you out in the pouring rain when you’re injured. I really don’t get why you keep going back to them just to suffer.”

I turned to look out the window at the sheets of rain pouring down like a waterfall.

After a long silence, I spoke softly. “They used to be really good to me.”

Farell didn’t believe it.

We hadn’t met until college, so he had never seen Ethan and Jude treat me kindly.

My eyes misted over, and I repeated myself earnestly.

“I mean it. They really were good to me.”

Chapter 6

As far back as I could remember, our parents were rarely home.

They had poured everything they had into medicine research and medical experiments.

Every time they left, it was for months, sometimes years.

The ones who took care of me growing up were not just the hired help—they were my two older brothers, both eight years older than me.

When I was six and had just started elementary school, the teacher announced a parent-teacher meeting for first graders.

With our parents far away, I rushed home and cried under the covers.

Fourteen-year-old Ethan came into my room late that night to check if I had kicked off my blanket. When he lifted it, he found my tear-streaked face.

He held me close and wiped away my tears like Mom used to do.

Then he patted my back and whispered, “It’s okay. I will go to the meeting for you.

Mom and Dad are busy, but your brother will never be too busy.”

The next day, he skipped school to attend the meeting, only to be scolded by my teacher for diching classes.

When he rushed back to his own school, his soccer coach called him to the field for extra training.

After school, when I didn’t see him waiting for me, I ran to his school and found him still training on the field.

The sun was blazing, and I was so worried he’d get heatstroke that I nearly cried.

He ran down from the stands, grinning playfully to calm me down.

“This is nothing. The sun’s nice and warm. I like it.”

We ate from street vendors and walked home under the moonlight.

When we got back, the housekeeper had taken the day off.

Jude had already made a steaming hot dinner. The moment we opened the door, the aroma filled the house.

He was standing in the kitchen, holding a fork and knife. He poked his head out and said, “Wash your hands. Time to eat.”

Jude had always been quiet and gentle.

Whenever I came home with a scraped arm from playing too roughly and tried to hide it, he would silently roll up my sleeve and clean the wound with iodine before bandaging it.

When he finished, he would glance up, probably about to scold me.

But seeing me biting my lip, clearly nervous, he would just sigh softly.

Then he would reach out, ruffle my hair, and say, “Be more careful next time.”

I was always wild and restless as a child, never learning to behave.

And each time, he would quietly clean me up again.

Every time I saw the worry in his eyes, he’d just sigh and say, “Be more careful next time.”

For all those years when our parents weren’t around, Ethan and Jude were like my parents and my protectors. They watched me grew.

Until I turned twelve and saw the northern lights on TV.

Ethan promised to take me to see them during the New Year holiday. Jude even booked three plane tickets.

But the next day, tragedy struck—our parents passed away suddenly.

Chapter 7

Before the accident, our parents had been on the verge of successfully developing a heart medication they planned to sell at low cost.

When word of this got out, it provoked the wrath of pharmaceutical companies.

In the early hours of New Year’s Day, an arsonist set fire to their lab.

They had stayed there all night, trying to finish the final phase of testing in time to help patients.

By the time Ethan, Jude, and I rushed to the scene, all we found were two charred corpses.

That was my last memory of my parents.

To this day, I still struggled to recall what their faces were supposed to look like.

There was someone else who died in that fire—a young woman in her early twenties, one of their students.

She had just gotten married, and her child wasn’t even a year old. Her husband had already passed away.

When her burned body was found, her hand was still tightly clutching a necklace engraved with her daughter’s name.

It took Ethan and Jude six years of relentless searching to track down that little girl in an orphanage.

Fate has a way of playing cruel tricks.

Seven-year-old Melody was brought into the Preston family six months later.

In the evening, I went to a bar with my classmates and happened to run into the director of the orphanage. After drinking, he blurted out his words and burst into tears.

That was how I learned the truth.

The real Melody had died of heart failure at the age of three.

The girl brought to our home had been an orphan suffering from liver failure, unable to afford treatment.

The orphanage director had taken pity on her and passed her off as Melody, so my brothers would cure her instead.

When I rushed home, I caught Melody once again smashing one of my things.

It was a photo of the five of us, taken before our parents passed away.

The frame had shattered on the floor, glass in pieces.

Just like all the times before, Melody crouched down to pick it up, then held up her hand with a pitiful expression, showing a small cut to get Ethan’s sympathy.

I couldn’t take it anymore. I stormed over, yanked her away, and lost control.

“Get out!” I screamed.

It was the first time Ethan looked at me with a cold, furious expression.

Even Jude, who was always calm and quiet, looked disappointed.

“Willa, enough is enough. You can’t keep acting like this.”

I told them everything I had heard.

I saw the panic on Melody’s face.

At least her illness had been treated.

But a fraud had no right to keep living in my house, clinging to my brothers, or breaking my things again and again.

But Ethan only responded with anger.

“Willa, is it so hard for you to accept Melody? She was the daughter of our parents’ most cherished student. Her child is the only blood tie and emotional connection they left behind.”

“How can you say such things and feel no guilt?”

After that, things between us never returned to peace.

Then a month ago, Melody used her same old trick and broke the medical research award I had just received.

I chased her to the stairs, completely losing control, and slapped her.

She deliberately fell down the stairs, and when I tried to catch her, I ended up falling too.

I hurt my arm badly and struggled to get back up.

But before I could even speak, Ethan slapped me across the face.

It was the first time.

Even Jude, always so gentle, was furious as he shouted: “If you can’t live with us anymore, then just get out!”

They took Melody to the hospital and left me behind—wounded too, but alone.

They had promised to take me to see the northern lights.

But ten years later, that promise now belonged to Melody.

Chapter 8

I pulled myself out of the memories.

Farell, who was driving beside me, handed over a tissue.

I stared blankly for a moment before realizing that my eyes were already wet.

The moment I agreed to join Dr. Vale’s ten-year closed research program, I thought I had already let go of the past.

Only now did I realize that even recalling those memories still made my eyes well up.

It was fine. It was okay.

People always needed a little more time to forget and move on.

I returned to campus, moved into the dorm, and kept busy finishing my nearly completed thesis.

The next day, while Farell and I were on our way to the library, we ran into Ethan and Jude again.

They had brought Melody with them. She had probably decided on a whim to visit the university library for fun.

Ethan was now a research advisor. At only thirty years old, he had already become an associate professor.

So, it wasn’t strange to see him there.

I acted like I hadn’t seen them, found a seat, opened my laptop, and continued writing.

But Melody dragged them over and sat not far from me.

I could hear the soft laughter of the girl from time to time.

Ethan looked a little uncomfortable and tried to quiet her a few times, but she kept chattering away.

Jude gently reminded her, “Behave yourself.”

That line triggered a sudden memory—how Jude used to sigh and say the same thing to me when I was little: Behave yourself.

I finished the last part of my thesis, clicked save, and felt a bit suffocated, so I got up to get a drink of water.

When I came back, Melody was already holding my laptop.

Ethan and Jude had gone to the bookshelves to look for something.

Melody was alone with my computer, moving and clicking the mouse with practiced ease.

A surge of panic twisted my gut—I lunged forward and snatched the laptop from her hands.

She immediately flung herself backward, hitting her forehead on the chair, then screamed and burst into tears.

Students reading nearby all turned to look.

With trembling hands, I opened the recycle bin and retrieved my thesis file.

When I opened it, everything I had worked on for nearly half a year—pages of writing and data charts—was gone.

All that was left was a grinning face made from punctuation marks.

That grotesque, toothy grin stared back at me from the screen.

My mind buzzed.

Then Ethan arrived in a hurry and, without asking anything, snapped at me: “Willa, why did you push Melody?”

Chapter 9

Jude helped Melody up, his face visibly displeased.

More and more people were gathering around.

Farell, who had been browsing by the shelves, hurried over when he heard the commotion.

He glanced at my laptop screen, then at my face, and quickly understood what had happened.

“Your thesis was deleted?!”

Ethan’s furious expression froze for a moment.

He walked over and looked at my screen.

After a long pause, he frowned. “That’s not possible. Melody, she…”

“Let’s go,” I said, cutting him off without hearing the rest. I turned to Farell calmly.

How strange.

I should’ve been furious—should’ve screamed at Melody like I had so many times before.

Should’ve lost control and maybe even slapped her again.

Should’ve gotten into another pointless argument with Ethan and Jude, who always shielded her.

But at that moment, all I wanted to do was leave.

I had argued with them for four years.

Dozens of times. Every single time ended the same way.

Now, I didn’t want to fight anymore.

After all, I only had a few days left before I was gone for good.

I picked up my laptop and walked out of the library.

Ethan followed behind.

I heard his voice—still cold, but with a hint of unease: “I’m in charge of this thesis project. I’ll give you another week.”

I replied quietly, “That won’t be necessary.”

I didn’t have another week.

I continued walking toward the end of the corridor.

And then, unexpectedly, Ethan caught up to me and grabbed my arm.

The man who had barely spoken a word to me for years now suddenly reached out.

“Willa, what’s going on with you lately?”

His voice carried an anxious undertone.

But I didn’t look back.

I simply reached out and gently pried his hand away.

As the elevator doors opened, Jude stepped in and blocked the door from closing.

He looked at the laptop in my arms and said awkwardly, “Give it to me. I’ll try to recover it for you when I have time in a few days.”

He had studied computer science and now ran a tech company.

Something pricked lightly in my heart.

Over the past few years since Melody arrived, it had mostly been Ethan who clashed with me or lashed out.

Jude, with his quiet and gentle nature, hadn’t often fought with me.

I stared at him in silence for a long time.

Until he spoke again.

“Melody’s still young. If she really did delete it, she probably didn’t mean to.”

So that was it.

He was worried I’d hold a grudge.

Worried I’d lose control again and push her down the stairs.

And here I thought—just for once—he might finally take my side.

I curved my lips into a bitter smile at my own foolish hope.

I reached out and pressed the elevator’s close button.

That once-restless heart of mine had finally calmed.

So calm it had turned into still, lifeless water.

It seemed…I wasn’t even sad anymore.

As the elevator doors slid shut, I said softly, “It’s fine. No need.”

Jude reached forward, probably trying to stop the doors, but he was too late.

In the final moment before they closed, I thought I saw panic and helplessness flash in his eyes.

A fleeting image and then the elevator closed completely.

Perhaps… it was just my imagination.

Chapter 10

The next day, after wrapping up everything at college, I went over my luggage one last time.

At noon, I treated a few of my roommates to a meal—as a way of saying goodbye.

But just as I walked out of the restaurant, Jude suddenly called.

I answered, only to be met with silence for a long moment.

I thought maybe he had pocket-dialed me.

I was about to hang up when he finally spoke.

“When are you coming home?”

I froze.

For a second, I wondered if he meant to call Melody instead.

Still, I replied, “College’s been hectic lately. I probably won’t go back.”

But Jude didn’t let it go. “What about tonight?”

I had no idea what was suddenly going on with him.

So I just made something up. “I’m meeting some classmates tonight.”

Another long silence.

Then he spoke again, a bit awkwardly. “Today’s mine and Ethan’s birthday.”

I was caught off guard.

For years, I’d been the one planning their birthdays.

I’d buy the cake, book the place, start picking out gifts more than a month in advance.

Ethan was always busy with his students. Jude was swamped with work and never cared much for celebrations.

It was always me who prepared everything and dragged them into a party, forcing them to act surprised.

But this year...

I had genuinely forgotten.

I didn’t know what to say. After thinking for a while, I only managed a quiet, “Sorry.”

It came out sounding distant and formal.

Another silence.

Then Jude’s voice came through again, hoarse this time. “Come back for dinner. I’ll cook.”

I didn’t really want to go.

But he added, “The housekeeper took Melody to her night tutoring session.”

The wind outside was biting cold.

In the end, I agreed. “Okay.”

This really would be the last dinner.

When I arrived home, Jude was in the kitchen preparing food.

As the sun set, I saw Ethan standing out front, smoking by the gate.

It was freezing. Under the streetlamp, his pale face looked almost bluish from the cold.

For a brief moment, I wondered if he was waiting for me.

As I approached, he seemed to choke on the smoke and coughed twice.

There wasn’t much left to say between us anymore.

So I reached for something casual. “You should probably cut back on smoking.”

Ethan didn’t say anything, but he immediately stubbed out the cigarette.

I was slightly stunned. I hadn’t expected him to actually listen.

When I stepped inside, Jude poked his head out of the kitchen, a knife and fork still in his hands.

“Wash up, time to eat.”

My eyes suddenly stung.

At the table, Ethan started talking about going to Norway to see the northern lights.

From countries like Thailand, where they supposedly have cheap penthouses for a fraction of a price that you would have to pay in American cities, the costs of groceries in Russia, where you can buy a whole week of food for few bucks, or that one meal big ass meal in Guangzhou which was only dollar and fifty cents. 

Do people seriously think that the people of those countries get paid the same amount as them? It’s always presented in such glory, almost as that these places are literal paradise on earth. Like no, Bob, just because you got Banh Mi for a dollar in Hanoi doesn’t mean Vietnam has better living conditions than your country (sorry if this sounds bad, I am not saying that for example US is better or worse, but I think you understand what I mean).

Feeling at ease where I can sit for hours without distraction, extreme bliss where I cannot stop smiling and feel so enthusiastic and loving for no reason, and extreme terror and panic where I don't know what is real anymore.

After experiencing all this, I've come to the conclusion that toughts are just hormones in your body, those hormones get triggered by beliefs, and when you have invested enough energy into a belief it becomes muscle memory and so it feels automatic.

Literally, whenever I eat clean, without anything that strongly stimulates my nervous system like coffee or greasy foods, I feel I don't necessarily need to sit for meditation.

Let me continue ([1](https://www.reddit.com/r/SGIWhistleblowersMITA/s/44CwUkxoVs),  [2](https://www.reddit.com/r/SGIWhistleblowersMITA/s/NSBibOhKaG)) interacting with my friend over the hedges and respond to his post last week “They’re going after the kids HARD for this 10K goal!”

Dear Secret-Entrance,

Let's chat some more about your analysis of the contents of the June 2025 *Living Buddhism* pub. You dismissed the article [The Courage to Listen: A Discussion with Youth about the Key to Introducing Young People to Buddhism](https://www.worldtribune.org/2025/the-courage-to-listen-2/) with a “you think it would be all about these kids and their lives but of course it’s not. It’s about how they were sucked into the cult and how they suck others into the cult.”

As I have shown in my prior posts, we have already learned quite a lot about “these kids and their lives.” And we now learn even more about their thinking. 

The interviewer asks Kenneth whether he feels that his generation is respected and listened to. The question goes to the heart of the generational divide. According to [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generation_gap), there is source material going back to 624BCE trying to grasp the phenomenon and challenges of established and rising generations! Although it is of no matter to S-E, this article demonstrates, SGI-USA is actively taking the issue to heart. If Secret-Entrance is an indication of r/sgiwhistleblowers sentiment, there is no sense of responsibility toward empowering future generations to inherit the future.

Secret-Entrance, I don’t know what your political viewpoints are but here in the United States one political party became sclerotic and lost the ability to hear from younger generations. This topic has to me, you, and everyone during these perilous times.  

Kenneth next acknowledges a gap between the younger and older generations:

>Younger generations are seen as soft, but I think that discredits what we go through and prevents us from being heard about the things we are struggling with. In the SGI, at least for me, I feel respected. I feel like the focus is on us to change the world.” 

The question now shifts to what is key when introducing young people today to it. Secret-Entrance, according to your preoccupation and obsession about the SGI, you seem to believe that our activities to introduce others to SGI Buddhism rank among the top crises facing humanity today. 

Ella mentions, “Trust is a really big thing. Being genuine and showing your care for someone is so important.”

My therapist has introduced me to the “Internal Family Systems” (IFS) therapy developed by Dr. Richard Schwartz. As a result of multiple situations in my life triggered by HS, [addictive personality](https://health.clevelandclinic.org/addictive-personality), dissociative disorder and such, I began developing, according to my therapist, “multiple parts” in my mind as a survival mechanism. 

As I am becoming healthier, I find myself not needing those protecting parts as much and I’m better able, as Ella stated, to “trust” and “be genuine.” Adding to that list, let me polish my ability to be more present, engaged, and authentic. It’s hard, ongoing work!

Oh, S-E, snarky sarcasm is an easy weapon to hurl--as [Teddy Roosevelt](https://www.trcp.org/2011/01/18/it-is-not-the-critic-who-counts/) once lectured. But maybe you can lead the charge at WBers, S-E, to take on more difficult and relevant discussions and plow some new soil for the sake of a rising—and hurting—generation that our country needs to lead us in the future?

Eamon now states: 

>Many youth are ambitious and want to do many things, but they hold themselves back based on their self-limitations. People are seeking to unlock their potential and overcome their obstacles, but they don’t know how and often don’t trust organized religion—or organized anything! 

To that, Ayu adds: 

>Our generation grew up on the internet, so there’s a lot of things that we are taught not to trust.

In my district we have several youth about ten years younger than me. Although the gap is just a few years, they are very different from me, Guy, Emily, John, and Veera; they are cut from a different bolt of fabric. Look at Frida, Toni, and Toni’s BF José. Once they believe in something, such as Laverne & Shirley’s restaurant and BandB/Conference Center, they work unstintingly with unbelievable dedication. And Jack, although not a top-tier athlete, puts as much effort into training and teaming as anyone. It’s that two-step again: trust leading to dedication.

Secret-Entrance, religion is in the public space, it’s an open market—highly competitive and “may-the-best-idea-win.” I get it, you don’t like the SGI. But what are you leading people *to*? What are you adding to the marketplace? What does your sub put forward as new and fresh? For example, how are you and WBers addressing the needs and aspirations of Gen Z?

Secret-Entrance, there’s a *lot* more that I have to say about your reductive treatment of a single article. But I want to cover some fresh territory starting with tomorrow. Have a pleasant day.

Yours,
JulieSongwriter

File a report?,"Im really mad. I live in really close proximity to my neighbors because it’s like a townhouse set up. So last month I go to the bank, then to the store, then I go on my roller skates around this more isolated area around where I live. I come home and got notified an AirTag is found near me from 6pm to 10pm. The problem is it’s me, my keys, and my phone. That’s it. I don’t use a purse. It showed me a map of where I went. The map was correct. I was out from 6-10pm and I was with my sis some of the time. The issue is she doesn’t own an AirTag. I have no new devices, no one at home has an AirTag. So at 2am my sister is sleeping and this thing is moving. It’s moving sporadically that same day all over the street. It’s close enough so I can play the sound. I try, it doesn’t connect. So then it says I can connect to it? The greenthing. I go to the window and see nothing. I thought maybe my neighbors put an AirTag on their dog because that would make sense? But it’s not making sense that they took the same route as me. But at 2am it’s going all over the street down the block up the block… while I was at home. 

So then I forget it. Today it shows again. It followed a slightly different path but it showed almost half the route I took to go to this coffee shop with my sister. Mind you I go with her a lot, but it stopped tracking at about the halfway mark of our walk there? So I’m really at a loss. I keep trying to play the sound but it’s too far to connect, close enough to come up though. My neighbors dog cries and howls when they leave it alone but it’s also not a puppy so idk if the animal theory makes sense? I didn’t see them out with the dog on a walk but why is this happening. Again I don’t have a purse or anywhere that someone could slip an AirTag unless it happened long long ago and only now flagged. 

I also didn’t take my AirPods nor did my sister to get coffee so that’s odd. She’s had the same
Phone as well. Nothing shows up for my sister. It only shows for me so that also doesn’t add up. Lastly it says it’s not reachable even when the scan feature shows up. I’ve walked around my room to try and connect plus walked outside nothing. Lastly I only have screenshots of the last time it showed under unknown devices because my phone got rid of it since it was a month ago I guess??",0,1751404935.0,AirTags,1,0.5,False

1lpdpx4,https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/1lpdpx4/emotionally_abusive_roommate/,Emotionally abusive roommate,"Okay so I am going to tell a story of my situation with my roommate of how we went from hopeful friends to a turn for the worst.

First, this is a random person I met on the internet and wholeheartedly thought I could trust. Right off the bat I warned this individual that I had borderline personality disorder (heavily managed and working on things to the best of my ability), two cats that are wacky, and that I am a morning person. Let's just fast forward to the event that triggered everything. I had an unregulated moment in the kitchen in the morning of the 19th of June (unaware the roommate was home) obviously they were scared. However, when I apologized and took responsibility for that; I was met with legal threats, judgement on my character based on my one BPD moment (I was already feeling shame for...), accusations, and that I was the one that was being a manipulative person.

Rewind to before moving in, I was in the process of moving in I was under a severe amount of stress from everything (queer-disabled-climate researcher). I met this roommate. Despite my stress I wanted to be roommates with them and help them out. Their identity had been stolen, and they needed a place. I offered ALL the help I could possibly give, sacrificing my own comfort. After moving in I noticed the lack of towels/hand soap/dish soap/trashcans/etc. I purchased all of it. On top of that I paid the entire 2.3k of move in costs in hopes that the roommate would pay me back, they are slowly paying me back but have certainly moved that deadline multiple times. Even more so I just got a new car, so I was in the process of giving the roommate my old one because I wanted to help with their work commute. With the new car I assisted the roommate multiple times with driving 40+ min to help them with transporting large pieces of furniture, one event of them demanding I hurry at 6am because they miscalculated how much time they had (granted I was bought a coffee).

So, with everything I did to help, to be called manipulative and 'using' them was a knife to my heart and a trigger of my trauma. I decided to take back the car because they were just being mean. I was hurt and scared. I decided to be petty at one moment and take back the toilet paper that I had also paid for, and the next morning put it back because it led to a nasty fight. This fight was more because they did not like that I played music in my room in the morning, when they asked me to stop playing music, I tried to take my power back and said 'no'...that did not end well. So to recap, Thursday I had an unregulated moment, Friday I was cornered and felt the need to fight back for myself (toilet paper/music moment), and for days I stayed at a friend's place because I am so scared of what they will do to me, I mean they speak in such a calm voice and say ""I want the best for you"" but then consistently criticizes my character. I am simply hurting, and the trauma response is building.

Fast forward to the 29th, I had just gotten back from Seattle pride and was in a great mood. I walk in and the roommate is home, I try and mind my own business, and they start playing music in the kitchen and sing somewhat loud but (tolerable). I had decided to play my own music because this felt passive (normally they have their Air Pods on, so this was ODD), they sang louder, and I turned up my music. I felt like things were passively escalating and decided to leave (slamming the door) and to leave the unsafe space. That was the end of Sunday.

Now Monday is when things take a turn, I had spent the day trying to find a way to make a comprise. That Friday weekend I decided to terminate the lease; I figured it'll be 2 weeks till I have to move so why not propose a truce. This is what I wanted to communicate: look I want this hostility to end how about neither one of us plays music that is/enters the communal space, the microwave/convection oven/soaps/water filter can be Switzerland (those are all things I had taken back that were my possession). However, when I texted this roommate that I wanted a truce, they called it being manipulative (without even hearing my ask) ...I was at this moment in a full-on rage, I noticed that I was spiraling and being triggered. BPD is very difficult, and I was aware of this, instead of going bpd, I decided to use my sound system to play music, they sent a text saying it was good music. Here is when I decide to play psychological horror but y'know legal and safe. I played the 'crab rave' song, after 15 minutes of crab rave on repeat, they turned the power off (breaker in their bedroom), I responded by playing it on my phone in my room, from 8pm-10:30pm. To be fair that song was actually calming for me. After that I went to bed.

Next morning I was met with hostility once again and I decided to play the crab rave song for 1 hour. they turned the power off once again. I was scared and this person was getting in my head. Well, I only played it for an hour and then did some work, wasn't even playing music and they turned the power off. Here is my breaking point of deciding to reach out for legal help, I was in therapy, and I asked them to stop, they turned the power off AGAIN. This entire thing is killing me. I have more important things to deal with in life than a petty dominating emotionally abusive roommate. PLEASE HELP. Landlord says it's a personal issue, wtf.

I am exhausted. I have a master's research project linked to NASA. I have cats. I have trauma. I’m doing my absolute best to be emotionally responsible and accountable — and I’m being punished for it while they play the “calm and rational” card.

They’re now telling my friend that is cat sitting for me that they “wish me the best,” while turning off my power, labeling me manipulative, and backing me into emotional corners.

(Since this was removed from the mainsub I'l just slap it here)

With mirror dungeon 5 about to go away, I decided to finally have a go at a solo run before md6. I was mainly inspired to do this by [Q-Hatred's](https://www.youtube.com/@Q-Hatred) videos.

I decided to do the run with maid Ryoshu, since she had both an evade and attack weight. I uptied her to 4 and Red Eyes Open to 3 for the run. Her main weakness was being pretty easy to stagger, which happened quite often. I didn't have all the best solo support passives, so I just went with the best ones I had. I propably should have used Tingtang Hong Lu for extra damage instead of Fanghunt for extra bleed mitigation, but Fanghunt had full rest bonus. Of particular note is Barber Outis, as a healing support passive that Maid Ryoshu could fuel on her own.

Despite only going for 5 floors it was really damn difficult, and took about 25 resets on the succesful run, almost all of those on 60 cost unfocused encounters. That run succeeded mostly because i got really lucky, an ego resource generating gift in rewards (coffee and cranes) and got lucky with 2 ? nodes that came up before I had to fight anything on that particular floor, first kqe-1j-23's event where i wrote dumbass to fight him and easily got full sp and fueled Barber Outis' passive without taking much damage and then I got Homeward (the painting that heals on encounter start) which helped a lot. I had to reset a lot on G-corp soldiers before I had the idea to use superbia for overclocked Contempt Awe, which turned of my gluttony fatality and gave 7 protection on the next turn to build up skill slots. After that I got coffee and cranes for ego resource generation and was able fuel my egos (all but Forest for the Flames required envy).

It really was a staggering difference between focused and unfocused encounters. Pretty much every focuded encounter was made easy by an evade, barring the couple times I had to reset due to getting unlycjy with the 5% early in a turn. Unfocused encounters were nightmares. After the firsty floor, once I had coffee and cranes the few unfocused encounters I had mostly didn't require resets, on floor 3 while on my way to show Nelly who is the real chief buttler I got through the dead rabbits without much trouble. They got their revenge on floor 4, where it took me over 15 resets to get through. I jsut get getting staggered and dying no matter what I did, trying to corrode into Contempt wasn't enough, I couldn't stager enough rabbits to survive turn 3 no matter how many egos i used, what finally worked was overclocking Contempt on turn 1 then overclocking both Red Eyes to corrode into Red Eyes Open on turn 3. I finally managed to both stagger/kill enough rabbits to heal enough to survive and then went to Shock Centipede with no envy and very low sp and won easily.

After that scare I picked Miracle Bogak, which I knew to be really easy, since the whole floor is just 1 long focused encounter.

All in all it was somewhat fun (not taking into account raging against the rabbits) and challenging, but definely only for pretty stacked accounts. Other than taking a limbillion unopposed attacks in unfocused encounters, md events become pretty difficult to succeed in, since only 1 sinner is propably going to have sp. Might be worth using the shop heal to fill Tingtang Hong Lu's sp to do checks with him.

My bike was stolen today (7/1) from the Market / Exchange St pocket park, next to Bard Coffee. It was locked, but I was naive to think that someone wouldn't cut a cable in broad daylight with plenty of people around in 45 minutes.

It's a very conspicuous bike, meaning not easy to paint or hide. It's an uncommon brand. Grey Espin.

Another thing - it's an e-bike and you need a special pack to charge it.

I guess someone could chunk it for parts, or try to resell it, or just huff around when the battery dies.

Last, the park may not have had any nosy people to ask why you were cutting a cable, but there are cameras. Police report has been filed. It has a serial number, a Tile, and it's registered in several places.

tl;dr - we'll probably find you, if not the bike.

If anyone sees someone cruising on a grey e-bike that is NOT a small black woman with long flowing hair :), would you be so kind as to send me a DM? Maybe I can point the police in the right direction.

Help what do I do?,"Hi! This is more of a “help! I need your advice” rather than an AITA type of post. 
Sorry if my English is bad, I live in a small village with Slavic language. 
My husband (35) and I (30) live together in a small house with one small guest room and our animals. So the fact is that we have the space to accommodate two adults. 

My brother (26) and his partner (22) , lets call him BB,have been staying with my brothers MIL (from hell) let’s call her Karen , in the neibouring city, so we are very close. They also have a dog ( from hell) let’s call it Bitchdog . 

A month ago they decided they’ll move to the capital city of our country because there are more job opportunities.So, they stopped renting their own apartment and move in with Karen in order to save up the money and afford the move. Their plan was to stay with her for two months. They arranged everything (movers, contract for the new house, new jobs starting dates etc) on the 1st of August. 
Today they got in a big fight with Karen and called me to ask if I could accommodate them and their bitchdog for a month. 

I am very hesitant and need advice because:

1. They allready knew Karen is psycho, and has crazy expectations of them, treats them like slaves in the house, shouts and cries when something she wants doesn’t happen… yet they chose to go stay with her. Their reasoning was “she offered,we didn’t ask” … I believe that’s terrible reasoning, and since they knew what they where getting themselves into, they should be at least prepared to de-escalate fights, instead of fuelling them by getting Karen angry. 

FYI they fought over a hot bath. In our country the water gets hot after turning the heater on for 1 hour. Karen asked her son BB to turn the heater on before she came back from work, so that she could have hot water to bath. BB slept all morning and forgot about it, completely. After waking up he left the house to meet up with friends and go for coffee. His mother called to ask about the heater and he said he couldn’t do it since he had left the house allready. Karen lost it on the phone and started shouting at BB how he was a disappointment etc. When brother finished his shift in the afternoon, he met with BB to return to the house where they met Karen. AT that point Karen had turned super saiyan and was yelling and crying. They got mad about Karen throwing an unfair fit and treating them like children and that’s when they decided to call me.  This is not a one time scenario, Karen is literally cou cou but still I feel like they could have de escalated the situation since they know she is mentally unstable… or just not have agreed to stay with her form the beginning.

2. BB quit his job 2 days ago because he wanted to rest before the move. I 100% agree with wanting to rest after working non stop for so long. But I am confused as to why they wanted to stay with Karen in order to save up money, but also stop trying to make more money to save. 

3. My husband and my brother have a typical relationship, not friends but kind to each other. Very different people but can share a conversation . On the other hand, my husband and BB have never had a good relationship due to being coworkers in the past and having issues at work. My husband is not happy to spend time with BB since day one, but will attend family gatherings etc because I have asked him to try . Husband was not excited about the possibility of accommodating BB for a month but understood why i struggled to say no, since I love my brother and really want to help out. Even though husband said it’s okay I can see it in his eyes he does not like it at all. (Especially since BB isn’t currently working meaning he will spent possibly the majority of time in the house) 

4. Karendog is a very aggressive animal and I fear about the animal dynamics in my house . Since my dogs and cats are well trained, have only known each other , and have a very nice family style relationship. Will having an aggressive dog in the house disrupt the system and never be the same again? 

5. I feel like there is an overall pattern of not committing when it comes to my brother and especially BB. They make choices that as soon as things get hard they quit. I explained to him that even if they come and stay with us, there will still be tension and possible disagreements,and we will definitely get under each other skins because it’s not just 3 or 5 days of living together but 1 whole month ! that’s a lot!  But he felt like I wasn’t supportive or didn’t love him for saying these things. I think he is still very immature but I don’t want to hurt his feelings by saying that. 

Overall I haven’t said yes or no yet, I asked them to think things through, try to make up with Karen, and stop trying to expect of her to treat them fairly and as a loving parent. I told him that “strings attached” will come with asking or accepting help. I told him that if making up with Karen still doesn’t work out we can discuss how to accommodate them. 
I feel terrible for not helping out right away…

1lpdi6f,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1lpdi6f/aitah_for_moving_out_to_put_my_mental_health/,AITAH for moving out to put my mental health first after living with my bf for 2 years?,"Hello all! I am 22F and my boyfriend is 44M. Yes we have a large age gap. We have lived together since July 2021, and we had been dating maybe 8-9 months before we moved in so next month will be 2 years of living together and about 3 years of being together in general. This post will be a bit long but please read everything if you have the time. 

Due to our large age gap I was very worried about living together, but honestly it was much better than I imagined for a while. He lived with his mom who had cancer and he was taking care of her, I was living with my alcoholic mom and when his mom passed he had to find a new place to live and he invited me to join and I jumped at the chance thinking it’d be amazing. Or so I thought. He is very hygienic himself and good at keeping the house cleaned, he definitely does more household chores than me, he was understanding of the fact that I was moving out of my moms house so I definitely needed help navigating the ropes of living alone-ish. We have a good system. We split rent, when I cook he does the dishes, he does all of the laundry so I fold and put it away, I buy our cats food so he scoops the litter boxes, things like that. 

Anyway; If you didn’t do the math already, we were 19 and 42 when we began dating. Both of our birthdays are coming up. Pretty crazy. Honestly I thought it would be a fling of a few weeks and nothing more but here we are. Despite our time living together going better than I thought it would, it’s also going worse than I thought. Not that he necessarily does anything wrong, but a lot of things I just dislike because of my personal preferences. He buys a majority of things in bulk because it’s cheaper - such as toiletries, dry food, snacks, dog/cat treats, sugar and coffee, etc. Which makes sense and it’s great to always have backups but most of our home is full of boxes of stuff and clutter and I hate it. no matter how many times I’ve expressed annoyance and spent hours cleaning and organizing, it ends up the same way. Then I feel I shouldn’t even bother and I begin to contribute to the clutter too because I just don’t care any more. 

He is also quite clingy, he wants to spend every waking moment together as we have been for a majority of our relationship because he was single for like 10 years before me. I’m not a fan of that. I find it very important to maintain individual activities/hobbies and being self sufficient in a relationship, but he thinks there is nothing wrong with being codependent. I unfortunately just allowed this behavior without speaking up because any time I did he made me feel guilty by saying things like “I just missed you, I just love you, I just want to be with you and spend time with you,” etc and I’m like well shoot.. how can I be upset that you enjoy my company? Idk but it is overwhelming sometimes… We also have cameras in every room of our home except bedroom and bathroom, and I originally was ok with this to keep an eye on our pets and everything, plus we don’t live in the best area - but then I discovered that the maybe 5 times in the past 2 years that I invited friends over, he listened to our entire conversations on the cameras and argued with me because my friend brought up how cute a guy she’s talking to was and I said “yeah”. 

Every time I stand up he asks what I’m doing or where I’m doing, any time I take a phone call he will join in the conversation in the background even though he can’t even hear the other person, making it hard to focus on that other person - or if he doesn’t do that he asks “what was that about” as soon as I hang up. If I say “nothing important” he’s like “oh okay fine then” He gets sad and mopey if I want to go to the drive through down the street without him. Or if I want to hang out with friends or family without him. If I manage to, he expects to know where I am and who I’m with (which is fine) but when I tell him like, “hey I’m hanging out at my friends [name] house for a little bit!” he will be like “why don’t you ever want to tell me what youre doing or who you’re with” and I’m like, UH, I just did! but it seems like he wants every little detail with timestamps of everything I do or else he acts weird. 

Again, due to our age gap, there’s not many hobbies or interests we have in common. All he talks about all day long is the news and trump and elon and crypto and stocks etc. I have a nice amount of money invested into crypto myself so it’s not any new information and it feels like an annoying buzzing in my ear all day long. All day every day just the same conversations. He has ADD and is one of those people that quite literally speaks every thought he has, and he has no problem cutting people off mid-sentence to get out whatever he wants to say. CONSTANTLY. I’ve begun to hardly even speak because of it feeling pointless as I know he’s just gonna talk over me anyway, then he gets upset because I never talk to him lol. Damned if I do, damned if I don’t. 

In the past year I have become severely depressed, lethargic, I have no motivation whatsoever, I’ve gone from 120lbs to 210lbs, I never leave the house because it seems like a chore rather than fun, I went from having like 15 close friends to 2 that I never really see because he makes it an issue EVERY TIME, I hardly see my family despite living a few streets away from them, I don’t have any hobbies anymore, everything feels stale, suffocating, boring, annoying, and bland just to name a few. 

Soo, due to all of this I have decided to move out and get my own apartment. I really feel it is the best option for me to better myself mentally and physically. So I can be on my own eating/sleeping schedule, take part in my girly hobbies, talk to and hang out with girlfriends without having to report everything back to someone, etc. I told him this about 2 weeks ago. I got approved for an apartment today which I have yet to tell him. He has been nonstop trying to talk me out of it, belittling me, telling me how awful and lonely it will be, how much more money I’ll be spending (realistically maybe an extra $200-500 a month than I do now since we split bills, which seems very worth the peace to me) telling me how I’m not gonna have anyone to help me with laundry or household chores or with my pets, and even downright begging me to please not go, saying if I cared or loved him at all I would stay, that it’s going to ruin our relationship, things like that. I’ve told him I don’t want to break up but I am not happy with the current living situation and I just need a change. He proceeds to tell me how he tries to do things with me but I never want to. Or he asks me “what do you think you can do at an apartment alone that you can’t do here” and it is making me feel awful and guilty that I’m finally putting myself first but I feel like I just NEED this. I miss the person I was 3 years ago, it was the last time I remember being truly happy. It might ruin our relationship and I feel awful and selfish but at the same time I feel I’ve been more than fair these past 2 years pretty much sacrificing my entire personality to keep him happy.

Every time I go out all I see is tall buildings and flyovers. I feel like throwing up. 
It feels like some sort of dystopian world. 

Recently I visited some relatives who live in the village and oh my god, i had the best time of my life in those fifteen days. 
Everything was so calm and pretty. I could finally stand on the ground and see the whole sky without anything blocking it. 
But I was bored. I had nothing to do the whole day. 
I realised I couldn't live there for the rest of my life. What if I need chocolate mousse at midnight? I couldn't even find a decent coffee there just that Nescafe instant coffee that tastes like pee. When I was menstruating i couldn't even find a decent chocolate there.

I'm a big Pineward fan and I've been super impressed by how they incorporate sugary, foodie elements. Ponderosa is one of my most worn perfumes (and one my boyfriend wears a lot!) despite initially striking fear in me with butterscotch and cookie notes. I spent a probably weird amount of time smelling these throughout the day and taking notes, so I'm making my best attempt at translating those into coherent thoughts to share!

**Cocoa Tabac** *(cocoa, tobacco, amber):* Something about this smells fruity to me when first applied? Like that specific cherry pipe tobacco vibe. Rich and warm. I wouldn't have labeled this a cocoa scent, but the darkness and powdery, slightly sweet amber contribute to a cocoa powder feeling. Smelling it again fifteen minutes later, it's notably lighter, shedding the intensity of its heavy and chewy texture. My brain continues to tell me something smells a little fruity and woody, maybe that's my interpretation of the amber? I was nervous about this one due to not being thrilled with Coffee Tabac. It's basically a list of my favorite notes, but came across a little too bitter, sharp, and tobacco-focused. This is different, I really enjoy this!

**Cordial** *(cherry, cocoa, brandy):* Opens with the dreaded cherry cough syrup scent but quickly grows dark and chocolatey. A syrupy, boozy, sweetness emerges. This is the closest one to a straight up gourmand in my opinion. Over time it shifts to become less obviously cherry-focused or sugary and shares the spotlight with dark, chocolatey, boozyness. Sweet, warm, fruity, dark, and woody? I sniff my wrist again about an hour and a half later and it's even less sugary and more dark, possibly woody? Still a noticeably sweet cherry-chocolate combo!

**Edelwood** *(zdravetz, cedar, spice):* My brain yells ""patchouli!"" but I think that's just due to a damp, dirty, herbal, woody vibe. This is SO interesting. Delightfully spicy and absolutely WOODSY. Like, the overall feeling of being in the forest with trees and flowers, not just smelling some wood. Within about twenty minutes it feels brighter and less ?? damp ?? I'm not sure how else to describe it or what was causing that feeling. Something about this reads incensey to me. An hour later it's even more bright but still warm and spicy, giving it a sunny feeling.

**Pottsfield** *(bitter orange, honey, spice):* This starts out super bright and feels slightly herbal or medicinal? My brain doesn't know what to make of this one. Fruity but not in a warm, sweet, friendly way. Crisp and a little bitter. Mildly sweet, spiced honey peeks through over time. Once it stops storming, I'm curious about taking this for a test drive in hot weather because I'm not getting the deep, sticky quality that honey blends can bring to the table. I think my skin is amping oranges and giving this a warm weather vibe.

**Pumpkivus** *(pumpkin, brown sugar, vetiver)*: I was afraid of this one but I can tell upon first spritz this is lacking the cloying qualities that scare me away. It's very dark and earthy. Like, an authentic Halloweeny witchy scent. Warm, sweet, a little spicy. But I cannot stress enough that this is not in the realm of pumpkin spice lattes. This seems to be natural pumpkin and vetiver focused. About an hour later, the sugar recedes even more and this feels leathery? But still enjoyable!

**Winesap** *(apple, wine, patchouli):* I was the most afraid of this one and its apple note, since Sturbridge is the only scent I tried from Pineward that I REALLY disliked. I come a lot closer to enjoying this but my brain can't seem to shake the apple = autumn candle association. For some reason this sort of smells like a pastry to me? I absolutely get tart booze, crisp apples, somewhat dirty patchouli, but! It's also sweet and almost doughy or savory? I don't know what's wrong with my nose. Almost an hour later I smell my wrist again and I'm actually surprised by how much more I enjoy it?? A tart, fruity, woody, patchouli. Like I'm shocked by the transformation into enjoyable woodsy patchouli fruit snacks??

In conclusion, I appreciate all of these! Even the ones I was nervous about! I'm not crazy about Pottsfield but it wasn't bad. I would trade my first born child for a full size of Edelwood. The rest fall somewhere in the middle. This was a fun experience, I'm curious to hear other people's thoughts and see where this goes! I would buy more of Edelwood and Cocoa Tabac in a heartbeat!",12,1751403630.0,Indiemakeupandmore,2,1.0,False

I mainly use instant coffee because I'm able to have so much more customization with it ( adjust amount of water I want, can have whenever, wherever fast, can have hot, cold. Etc.) and I've used two brands throughout my journey: cafe bustelo espresso and Maxwell house, both there instant coffee versions. 

Maxwell has been the one I like the most as when I drink it I feel way more energized physically and mentally, however sometimes I will have cafe bustelo to switch it up a bit and I notice upon drinking it my head feels clearer but I feel really tired and groggy like I want to take a nap. 

I have done research and done the same caffeine amount for each, I made sure all other variables were in check. (Rest, hydration, low stress) and it seems that only cafe bustelo espresso makes me feel this way. I also notice other espresso drinks I get at restaurants, coffee shops make me feel this way to compared to just normal black coffee.

I'm sure I have adhd as I've always had symptoms of it ever since I was little, but this seems really specific as I can drink the same amount of coffee (caffeine wise) in each and have two completely different affects. Just curious into why this might be.

I also really like espressos, so it actually makes me kind've annoyed that it does this.

But if that’s what you’re here for, you can skip this post—because what I’m about to share is 100% ethical and surprisingly simple.

Quick note before I dive in: English isn’t my first language, so I used AI to help rephrase this. But everything you’re about to read is from real experiences.


So, I started working at an electronics store as a sales rep. Not my dream job by any means, but it was a start. To be honest, I had zero passion for it. I wasn’t trying to be the top seller, didn’t bother studying the product info, and I wasn’t chasing commission. I was just… showing up.

There was this senior salesman at the store who clearly didn’t like me. I didn’t like him either, to be fair. I figured it was because I was new and he was partly responsible for training me—a job he definitely didn’t want. But what happened next completely changed not just our dynamic, but my entire approach to people.


One lazy shift, I randomly landed a big sale. Pure luck—the customer basically sold himself. But afterward, the store manager pulled me aside and said:

> “That’s impressive for a newcomer. I think you’ve got real potential here.”



I can’t explain why, but those words hit hard. That sale wasn’t because I was skilled—I just got lucky—but hearing that kind of belief in me? Something clicked. From that moment, I started memorizing every bit of product info I could, and suddenly I wanted to be good at this job. I wanted to prove him right.

One day, during a break, I asked myself:
“Why do I suddenly care so much?”

And it hit me. It wasn’t the money. It wasn’t the job. It was that compliment. Just a few sincere words flipped a switch in my brain. I didn’t want to lose that feeling of being seen, of being acknowledged.

So I started to experiment.


There was this guy from the cleaning crew who worked at our store. Always looked miserable, barely talked to anyone, just kept his head down. But I noticed how hard he worked. So one day, I walked up to him after his shift and said:

 “You did a great job here, man. I wish more people were as honest with their work as you are.”



His whole face changed. From drained and annoyed to smiling—genuinely. And not just that… he started working with more energy, more pride. He even started chatting with me regularly, like something had been unlocked in him. All because someone finally noticed him.



Now back to the senior sales guy—the one who didn’t like me. One day, I saw him close a really difficult deal. No one batted an eye because, well, that’s just what’s expected from him. But I decided to swallow my pride and told him:

> “That was impressive. That customer was tough, but you handled it with some sharp persuasion skills. Respect.”



He gave me that “waiting for the sarcasm” look. But when I didn’t follow up with a joke or jab, just stood there, sincere—he just said “thanks.” No attitude behind it. Just a simple, honest thank you.

After that? He warmed up. He became more open. Eventually, I asked him to grab coffee and teach me a few of his sales tricks. He did. And those tips? They worked. My performance improved, the manager noticed, and I made sure to give full credit to my senior for helping me.

He appreciated that. A lot. And from that moment on, he became my biggest supporter at work. We even became friends outside the job.


Now, I know what you're thinking:
""So you're just buttering people up to be liked?""

No. It’s not about being fake. It’s about learning to see people. To notice the effort no one else sees. To recognize who someone is trying to be—and reflect that back to them in your words.

That’s what makes people drawn to you.

Here’s the key: make your compliments genuine and specific. Don’t just say, “cool shirt.” Say, “You’ve got good taste—picking that shirt shows you really get how to pair colors.”

Make it personal. Make it real.

If you want to get better socially, start here. Notice people. Validate the version of themselves they’re trying to become. You’ll be shocked how fast they gravitate toward you—not because you're manipulating them, but because you made them feel seen.",0,1751403538.0,socialskills,11,0.44,False

2) Descend from the mountaintop of third-wave enlightenment with condescending/smug responses like, “you’re doing it wrong”, “your technique is terrible”, “with a grind like that, you might as well throw the grinder in the trash.”

1lpd6n7,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1lpd6n7/my_bf_41m_cant_forgive_my_infidelity_37f/,My bf (41M) can’t forgive my infidelity (37F),"So here’s a long one.

I met my bf almost two years ago, obviously at first everything was perfect, but then issues started to arise. We both have some childhood traumas (don’t we all?), with his being exceptionally heavy. Long story short - after few months of dating and living with this guy (he just started staying at my place at some point which I was perfectly fine with) I realized I am being mistreated. He was cold, distant, criticizing me all the time and I found myself doing anything I could just to avoid any conflict. I am a slightly damaged person so I just went with it, as any normal person would (right?). But at some point things went downhill real fast. I started doing weird shit while drunk - I went through his phone and told him about it, I rubbed against a friend of his friend and one night I made out with a guy and my bf saw it (for context - we live in this tiny, tiny district in a quite a big town and have a local pub that I live above so if I get drunk there and do stupid shit it’s pretty easy to catch me red handed).

My bf went crazy which makes sense. It didn’t help that the guy I made up with is a neighbour of mine and also a coach of local football team’s goalkeepers (my bf is a huge fan of said team). All hell broke lose, which is understandable, and at some point of the night my bf left the place and it was pretty clear that the relationship is over.

I woke up hungover and messed up, but there was this sense of relief that surprised me. At first I was very apologetic towards my bf (not asking him to forgive me, but just apologizing sincerely about hurting him) but after few hours it dawned on me that it was not about fancying another guy but about breaking free from the abuse.

Since then onwards I was really happy about how things have turned out. I wasn’t happy about HOW I managed to get out, but was happy with the result and was exploring crazy depths of anger towards the guy who mistreated me. It felt like a new beginning.

My then-ex went through various stages of grief which made me block him everywhere.

But then I started to realize I miss him. I have never ever went back to an ex. The thing with me is that after I’m done - I’m done for good. But with this guy - I unblocked him and after a while asked him to meet me.

It turned out that after the break up he went straight back up to therapy. He was fully owning the situation, he took the blame even for my actions, saying he knew that was my way to save myself.

Then he asked me for a second chance and as hesitant as I was at first - over time I saw the real change in him. When we first met he was emotionally available and sweet and then it went away. But there it was again. And it has been this way for past three months. He really did change. There was no sorts of abuse on his part. I know I might sound naive, but guys, psychology has been an interest of mine for years, I’m insightful and smart and this guy has really put effort into allowing himself to be vulnerable and caring.

At the same time though I was dealing with a lot of shit work wise. I own a coffee shop that has been struggling and I am crazy in debt and stressed beyond comprehension. I withdrew myself emotionally within past couple of months.

I had no idea about the toll it took on him. I knew we drifted apart and I started to feel anxious about it but at the same time I was 100% focused on trying to come up with ideas how to save my business. But two night ago I told him I’m worried about the distance that starts to show and all of a sudden he told me that it’s because he can’t forgive me the cheating.

I got angry with him. To me it felt like it came out of nowhere and so I went to bed angry and then woke up to him with his stuff packed and him telling me he wants to leave.

We had our share of ‚I’m leaving’ dramas so as much as I was hurt - I thought it’s something to be resolved. But I called him tonight and he told me he can’t be with a cheater and it doesn’t matter why I did it - the fact matters. And he said it’s humiliating to be seeing the guy I cheated with on a daily basis from our windows. He completely downplayed his role in what happened this spring. On the other hand he expressed how pushed away he felt (including intimacy) and he was pretty adamant about break up being final.

And now I find myself crying my eyes out on my balcony because I really care for this guy and I want to keep fighting. But I need outsider’s perspective. Is there any point in trying? What can I say/do now? I do care for this guy a lot, life without him seems scary and cold and strange.",1,1751403311.0,BreakUps,10,0.67,False

This is actually a county park with large, well-spaced drive-in sites (reservation required). It was in the mid 80's during the day and barely hit 70 at night. It was also pretty humid and ended up raining in the late evening, although it was relaxing to listen to in my tent.

* Tent - Kelty Discovery Trail 2
* Dinner - Red curry noodles from Trader Joe's
* Dessert - S'mores clusters from Trader Joe's
* Breakfast - Peanut butter and banana sandwich with a coffee

I did some hiking at four state parks in the area including Ralph Stover State Park (pictures above), which is adjacent and connected to Tohickon Valley Park via trials. Overall, it was a great time although the weather could have been better. I'm definitely going to invest in a fan for future trips in this kind of weather.

To replace it, I went with a Gaggia Classic Pro. This turned out to be a really TERRIBLE choice. Makes perfectly fine coffee, but five of the little red lenses that tell you if it's on, ready to brew and ready to steam broke. The seller (Whole Latte Love) was very nice and sent me replacements for free, but I've had to open it up three times in less than four months. 

They contacted Gaggia who were breezy and dismissive and said ""guess you better stock up on those lenses!"" and offered no explanation as to why this would happen (the machine never moves, and all I do is make two coffees a day). The seller has agreed to take the machine back and refund my money, which is generous of them. It's not THEIR fault that this thing is poorly made.

So now I'm left with the choice of what to buy next. Obviously Gaggia is off the list, since they did not care at all that their little plastic bits were cheap and crummy and kept breaking. I don't need a grinder as I bought a new one of those (from Breville with a discount they offered me when my old machine broke and couldn't be repaired).

Breville is an obvious choice. I have one of their microwaves too. Their stuff is well made and supported. But it's also made in China which I'd prefer to avoid if I can.

Have you ever heard a note lingering in the silence, faint but unyielding? Like a summons from some unseen conductor? It’s not a melody you know, nor a score you stumbled upon by chance. More like you were a restless instrument, untuned and wandering, until you found yourself playing the exact chord you were destined for. That’s how this symphony began.



I hadn’t played a piano since Claire passed away six years ago. She taught me everything: sheet music, posture, patience. Where to loosen up and where to hold tension. She had this heavenly touch when it came to music, soft but deliberate, like her fingers could feel the notes. She was an angel not only in her personality, but in her music.



How I wish it remained like that. Alas, she got diagnosed with cancer. Brain cancer…terminal. It was sudden, and very soon she started to fade. Her eyes lost their glint, her fingers their skill and precision. Eventually, she had to be hospitalized before it all came to an end. In her last few minutes, she told me to keep playing in her memory. I promised her I would as I felt her pulse disappear, holding her hand.



I couldn’t keep my promise, just looking at the keys had me hearing her ghost in every note. I didn’t get rid of the piano, though. It would be like throwing away the last piece of her soul. I kept it covered in a sheet like an unburied corpse. It simply sat there, mourning. Like me.



Then one morning I came into my kitchen and found a letter on the table. I was curious how it got there, but didn’t pay much mind at first. I went to inspect it. It was thick and yellowed, like aged parchment that was just unearthed from a crypt. My full name was written in precise, cursive script—*Liam Goodpray*. No stamp, no return address.



The first thing I noticed was the smell. I must’ve been imagining it, because it smelled faintly like Claire’s favorite perfume, some lavender one, but slightly more metallic. It must be her death getting to my senses. I opened the letter and read the text laid bare on it, in the same handwriting of the front.



*“To Mr. Liam Goodpray,*



*You are cordially invited to perform at the Bellmare Concert Hall, located in our old town of Dorset Hollow. One night, one recital*



*Pay: $50,000 cash*



*Mr. Wellers awaits you.”*



Just that offer was written, by a name I’ve never heard before, and some faded map at the back. No phone number or email or anything. I actually laughed out loud. Fifty grand in cash? For a single performance? It had to be some sort of trick or scam. But there was nothing there except an address. Would I go there and just get carjacked or something? 



I’ll be honest though, it piqued my curiosity. I didn’t decide to take the offer, though. Not at that point. I simply placed the letter back on my kitchen table where I found it.



I dreamed of Claire that night. She was onstage, but not dressed for it. Not in the blue dress she used to wear to her performances. Just herself. Tall, lean. She sat there barefoot in black jeans and a faded Nirvana shirt. Her black hair fell to her shoulders. Her eyes, those deep blue eyes. The kind you look into and can never see the bottom.



She was playing something I didn’t recognize. It was beautiful, yet impossible, like trying to comprehend the full scale of the universe. The music sounded like the concept of grief. Pure, unadulterated grief. Grief so deep it was sacred.



She simply looked at me and said, “Don’t go.” No fear or worry, just pleading.



I woke up shaking, and there, laid on my nightstand, was the letter.



I did my daily morning routine and jumped into my car. After that dream, I just wanted to see Dorset Hollow, despite Claire’s pleas. I wasn’t going to perform or even touch that piano, I just wanted to see. At least that’s what I told myself.



The drive took five hours. Back roads all the way. Halfway through, the GPS gave up, so I had to follow the map that was printed on the back of the letter. It was so faint that I could barely make it out. It looked like it was trying to disappear, like it didn’t want to be followed.



The trees grew thicker the closer I got. The road narrowed and the sounds of nature got ever the more hushed. Soon, I could hear nothing but the sound of my engine, but even that started to fade into obscurity. Every bend in the road I took made the sky grow more gray, more dreary, even though there were no clouds. Then I reached the sign.



*“Dorset Hollow: A Place for Quiet Reflection”*



The town looked preserved. It wasn’t old, wasn’t abandoned, just looked like time had eventually stopped flowing here. Buildings stood straight, yet hollow. The windows were clear, but dark, like they were reflecting moonlight rather than basking in the afternoon glow. The strangest thing was that I didn’t see anyone walking around, yet I knew they were there.



Then I saw the diner. It was simple, modest, but it felt comforting. It looked like it was out of a show and just said *DIN(N)ER*. Clever. I hadn’t eaten all day, so I pulled in.



The interior looked like it was from 1965. Checkered floors, red booths, even an old jukebox. It smelled like coffee and bacon, with a little bit of floor polish mixed in. Three other customers were seated, an older couple and a guy who looked to be my age. They all looked at me when I entered. They weren’t startled or surprised, just..aware.



I sat down at an empty booth and the waitress came over. Her hair was in a tight ponytail, her lips too red for this tired town. Her smile was perfect, but it didn’t reach her eyes. They looked almost hollow.



“You headed to the concert hall?” she asked as she handed me the menu.



“How’d you know?” I said, wondering what made it obvious.



She shrugged and looked in some general direction. “Not many folks come by here unless they’ve been invited.”



I told her my order but she didn’t write anything down. A few minutes later, she brought me a feast fit for kings. Black coffee and a plate with scrambled eggs and toast. It tasted exactly how breakfast used to taste as a kid. Simple, warm, a little too perfect.



The young man looked at me from his booth. “You play?”



I hesitated a bit before answering, “used to.”



He nodded, like he heard that a million times, before responding, “that’s good enough for Bellmare.”



I forced a smile at him. “You been?”



But he didn’t answer. Just went back to staring at his food.



I reached for my wallet, but the waitress rushed over to stop me.



“It’s covered,” she said.



“By who?”



She just gave a small shrug and said, “Mr. Wellers takes care of his guests.”



“Nice guy”, I thought to myself, before tipping her $5 and leaving for Bellmare Hall. It stood at the edge of the town, where the trees became forest. It didn’t fit the town—too big, hollow, imposing. It was made of what looked like marble and stone, like a cathedral for worshiping music. Vines grew up its massive walls like veins, ivy curled around lanterns that still burned, tall stone arches held doors twelve-feet high.



Yet a man stood waiting on its stairs. He was unnaturally tall and scarily thin, fitted into a charcoal-gray suit, and adorning a black top hat under a few tufts of white hair. It was like today was his funeral and he forgot to attend.



“Mr. Goodpray,” he said, Southern drawl straight from the bayou. “Mr. Wellers welcomes you.”



His smile was polite, inviting, yet practiced. It didn’t reach his eyes.



“You’re Mr. Wellers?”



He nodded. “Some call me that.”



“Is that what *you* call you?”



He titled his head to the side and let out a slight smirk, like he was amused by my question. “Mr. Wellers prefers to keep things proper.” 



That didn’t answer anything, but I let it go.



“The folks at the diner said you covered my meal,” I said.



“Wellers takes care of his guests,” he responded and grinned. That grin again, it felt off. Like he imitated it from people he watched, rather than actually feeling anything. He then motioned to the doors and opened them for me. “Shall we?”



As I stepped foot into the building, I almost had a double-take. It was beautiful. The lobby was lit by crystal chandeliers, with red velvet carpets adorning every footstep. The walls were paneled with dark, polished wood that reflected so much light that it hurt to look at for too long. But then we entered the concert hall.



You know that show *Dr. Who*? The hall was like the TARDIS. Massive. Bigger than it should be, judging by the size of the building from the outside. Rows upon rows of empty seats faced the stage. There laid upon it, like the crown jewel of the town, was the piano. A black lacquer, full grand, in perfect condition. It was like it was never played, but still waiting for centuries to perform.



It wasn’t Claire’s piano, I knew that for sure. But something about it seemed so familiar, so comforting. It simultaneously raised the hair on my arms and made my heart skip a beat.



I stepped toward it slowly. 



“She’s a piece of beauty,” Wellers said behind me. “Specially made for this hall.”



“She looks…” I paused, searching for the right word. “Hungry.”



He chuckled softly. “Music’s always been a hungry thing. Takes what you give it. Sometimes more.”



There was something in his voice. It had a weight to it, a surety. Maybe it was grief. Like he was mourning something yet to happen.



I turned to face him. “You sound like you’re giving a eulogy.”



“Do I?” he said, smooth as ever.



I blinked. That struck me wrong.



“You.. usually refer to yourself in the third person,” I said. “But just this moment, you didn't.""



He paused, then smiled and said, “Mr. Wellers finds it…easier that way. Keeps things separate.”



I was about to question him on that, but he quickly gestured towards the piano and said, “You’ll have time to prepare. The recital is tomorrow”



“You sure? It doesn’t look like anyone usually comes.” I turned towards the empty rows of seats. But out of the corner of my eye, I saw something. A flash of color. A flicker of blue in the far corner of the front row. But the instant I looked directly at it…there was nothing there.

I grew up in a family where breakfast was usually just a cup of milk or coffee. I am so used to that routine at this point that I have a cup of coffee in the morning, have only one meal a day, very rarely eat twice in a day. 

I have had an issue with how full I feel if I eat a proper meal and my mother has noticed that I can do small snacks throughout the day. It’s been very difficult to get to my goal weight (48) because I feel due to not eating enough, anything I eat is being stored for later exertion. I walk almost 10k-12k steps everyday and go to the gym 5-6 times a week. 

I do not know if this is an ED because I have just lived like this for so long. Not a crazy fan of food/eating in general but I do like to cook meals that I enjoy. I am a vegetarian as well so options can be limiting. 

While I do enjoy cooking a lot, I think I become lazy to eat the food. It is a problem because I want to start building muscle but I realised that I’ll need to consume a good amount of protein before I start doing so. 

Anyone who can relate and have overcome this issue can be of great help!! Thank you <33333

He is 30 and very…. 30… he makes jokes that I would consider offensive. A couple years ago I had had enough of his BS and called him out on how I didn’t have a relationship with him and that he doesn’t have a say on my gender. Today he came over and I didn’t know. My parents want us to get along, they want us to be a family again. So I decided to sit on the deck with him and my parents. At the very end of what I would consider to be a “decent meeting” , since I kept my mouth shut at any offensive shit, at the very end he gets up and misgenders me and asks me why I am there. A I live at this house B I wanted to sit on my patio and drink coffee C he could have asked me to leave like a grown up “I want to talk to mom and dad privately.” 

But no, instead, my attempt at trying to stablize anytning was seen as the very opposite. So there goes me trying to build any relationship with him ever again.

I enjoy the preparation of espresso coffee and feel now is the time for me to upgrade my setup.

I am looking to purchase a good quality grinder to see what difference that makes to my shots with the Express first. I will probably upgrade my machine then in the next few months.

1lpcsvl,https://www.reddit.com/r/teenagers/comments/1lpcsvl/i_moved_away_from_home_to_make_friends_and_it/,I moved away from home to make friends and it made everything worse,"For the record, this is mostly a past issue ( like barely 2 months ago?) but I've recently been interacting with a lot of new people and it's making me think about this stuff to try to make sure it doesn't happen again and I've been getting pretty upset over it. Again.

I  used to live away from home for college (I'm 18) and had 6 roommates, but also a ton of other people would kind of he there all the time? Like this one guy and another girl. Then the second semester i had mostly the same roommates with 3 new ones but the others would still spend every day there. 

So, at any given time there was typically 10ish people in my apartment not including me. I've always been an introvert, and keep to myself. But I really wanted to bond so I wouldn't lonely away from home (This arrangement lasted 2 semesters so 8ish months) and tried super hard to hang out with them. 

I never felt fully included, but around month 5 things got a lot worse. 

It started when they gave me a list of all my flaws they wanted me to change (I was on new antidepressants which were working really well and I was being super social). It was stuff like—My sarcasm makes them think I'm mean, I get really loud when I'm excited, I'm 'uninviting' to their guests. 

For more info, by guests, they're referring to the 4-5 guys that they would have over in the middle of the night when I was trying to sleep. (All girl apartment fyi). They were NEVER quiet, always rapping Justin Bieber, cooking full meals, playing card games, drinking, etc. 

And I do have a dark sense of humor but it always felt like a double standard because they would make jokes WAY darker with each other but if I said the exact same thing a day later, the conversation would come to a halt. 

A few days after that, I was so upset I stopped talking to anyone, just stayed in my room. I would wait for them to go to bed to make myself dinner. Then when one of my roommates ran into me she asked if I was okay because I had been ""weirdly quiet lately"". 

Another big issue was this girl (I'll call her Jane for the sake of this) who I used to be really close with. Jane basically used me for food, funding, and would sleep in my bed without taking my feelings into account. During finals week I was also on my period- I paid for us to do something to hopefully relax us, but it ended in this fight where she kept calling me a bitch and said she didn't regret it because it was true. 

The VERY NEXT DAY she showed up at my apartment, smiled at me, and sat on my couch to do her homework. Day after day after day. She said she was friends with my roommates but she doesn't know anything about most of them. I wouldn't even have an issue with it if they invited her, but they didn't.

There were times when I would come home and she would be in my kitchen because they let her in and then everyone else left. I would start leaving my own apartment to feel comfortable and when I would ask my roommates if we could stop having her over they just said I needed to be civil and since Jane wasn't causing problems, I shouldn't either. 

Even when I pretty much gave up and would fully ignore Jane, they would still tell me i was being rude because it was clear i hadn't let things go and was making the atmosphere tense. I even asked once if they thought i deserved to feel comfortable in my own apartment and they said yet but followed it up with saying Jane also deserved to feel comfortable in our apartment. (And as much as she didn't know much roommates, they didn't know her either. Not her parents names, the city she was from, ect.) 

Then, there's all the other stuff... During spring break I stayed home alone while they all went places. I was violently I'll (told no one) and still managed to clean the entire apartment for everyone, plus make a ton of ice (we used it all super fast and had no ice maker just a small tray). 

When they all got back it was less than 24 hours before the sink was full of dishes, drying racks were everywhere, I was tripping on shoes, and the stove was disgusting. 

I was accused of ""hogging the ice""? Because I was taking up too much space in the freezer and it seemed like I made it for myself and no one wanted to touch it? 

I would ALWAYS do my dishes before leaving the kitchen, even if my own food got cold. I kept my shoes in my room, I never had my laptop or water bottles anywhere else but I was included in this roommate meeting where everyone discussed the importance of keeping the common space clean (nothing changed after said talk). 

I also got in trouble for using my waffle maker. I bought it and the mix but allowed everyone to use it. I made waffles one day and then cleaned the counter (3 of them were in the room and saw) then the next day there was a text asking who used it last and if I could clean properly. (Side note, the cups in the sink had mold from them being left before spring break)

There was this one night during finals where everyone was drinking and playing music and I was having an extremely bad day, so like usual, I stayed in my room until most of them left. I had Bluetooth on and went to make myself dinner, telling my mom I was really struggling (borderline tears) (it's 10pm maybe?) and get a text from the one roommate who stayed in saying (verbatim) ""hi - so you’re talking kinda loud (these walls are very thin) if you can just lower your voice a little that would be fantastic!!!!""

That same roommate also left the windows open all the time (we shared a bathroom) and would get super upset that I slammed the doors (which were very sturdy wood) at 3 am. But she would open them right before bed (letting mosquitos in) and I would shut the door in the dark and the wind snapped them shut. That wasn't a good answer I guess. 

There was this cup I wasn't allowed to use (one roommate specifically asked me not to) but everyone else used it all the time. I would use several coffee mugs for my water instead (since we only had that one tall glass and I hated walking into the kitchen every 30 minutes) but then they got upset that I would take multiple mugs. 

A few weeks after spring break, my respiratory infection came back. I was running a 103 fever and skipping classes on doctors order, but when I asked someone to go to the pharmacy with me (not even for, just with) they all said they were busy. I said okay and on the way out joked if they needed anything, then got an actual list— Reeces peanut butter cups, tea, popcorn, chips, and eggs. Because 

One roommate SWORE up and down that she and I were going to go to this place we had both been dying to see and I was super excited. Then she booked the trip with someone else and left without even telling me (I found out through her Instagram) 

That roommate spent a lot of time in my room for like a week straight and I would have the others knock on my door to come in, realize she wasnt there, then leave. 

We had this ""ranking"" system which was kind of a joking thing where if we passed tests we got put higher and if we did stupid stuff like breaking a bowl we got put lower. My name disappeared from it and when I asked to be out back on, they wouldn't. But a few days later Janes name showed up. Along with the guys who I never even met except through the walls at 4 am OR when a roommate would text me to ask me to let one of the guys in while I was the only one home. (Which I did, but hated.) 

Before classes ended and everyone went home they went out and had a huge roommate dinner celebration (about 13 people, pretty much the people from last semester and this one) and again, I found out on social media.   

So, now, it's been about 2 months since I've gotten home and I see them traveling acrose the country to visit each other and post happy birthdays to each other on their stories (my birthday passed with only one of them remembering.). I watch them talk in the group chat every single day, and keep up their posts but never make any. 

I just keep wondering what I did, you know? How was I more likeable depressed than when I was being treated and genuinely felt happy? I focused so much on every single work I spoke, my volume, my tone, just trying to make them like me. I drank with them even though I thought it was disgusting, I would go with them to buy their cigarettes even though I don't smoke, I would clean their dishes, put away their shoes, proofread their homework.

1lpcrke,https://www.reddit.com/r/Hemochromatosis/comments/1lpcrke/low_iron_diet_for_hemochromatosis/,Low iron diet for hemochromatosis,"I wanna share a low iron diet for hemochromatosis from a person with indeed low iron levels since I think people should help each other and learn from each other. 

Basics: An average person should eat 15mg iron per day and 1-2mg of them should get absorbed by the body. A person with hemochromatosis absorbes 3-4mg, so twice as much. I read that with hemochromatosis the recommendation is to eat less than 6mg iron per day and less than 1mg of that should be absorbed. Less than 0,5mg would be even better. 

The diet: 

 Breakfast: 4 slices of toast — two of them with butter and lettuce, two with honey

Lunch: Noodles, salmon, and vegetables (radishes, lettuce, cucumber, carrot)

Afternoon Snack: 1 banana 

Dinner: A bowl of Skyr with blueberries, flaxseeds, peanut butter, and walnuts

Drinks: 2–3 cups of coffee or black tea with milk, usually consumed during meals

Calculation iron: 4,8 mg 
(Breakfast: 1,3 mg/ lunch: 2 mg/ Afternoon snack: 0,3 mg/ dinner: 1,2mg)

From the 4,8 mg iron you eat only around 0,28 mg would be absorbed based on calculations. (Diet has not much iron, not much vitamin c, a lot of things that inhibit the amount being absorbed). 

Summary: 

Average human recommended: eat 15mg iron and 1-2 mg absorbed

Hemochromatosis recommended: eat <6 mg iron and absorbed <1 mg or <0,5mg

My diet: 4,8 mg iron and absorbed 0,28 mg

With hemochromatosis you absorb twice as much as a normal person (3-4mg instead of 1-2mg) but my diet only gets you 14-19% of the normal iron intake.

1lpcqdx,https://www.reddit.com/r/WestVirginia/comments/1lpcqdx/ryan_trahan_50_states/,Ryan Trahan 50 states,"Alright I'll be more specific for context. 

Ryan Trahan is a YouTuber with 20 million subscribers, fairly popular on the platform, he's doing a series where he and his wife stay in 50 states in 50 days and the goal is to raise money for Saint Jude. The goal is to pick the ""coolest Airbnb in America"" and have chosen bespoke locations and found something special about each state.


Until they reached West Virginia. 

How does everybody feel about the fact that Ryan Trahan didn't even bother to learn the name of the town he stopped at in the West Virginia video? He picked the most boring listing in our state (no offense if it's your place, it's a nice place but not WOW cool compared to a Frank Lloyd Wright house) to sleep at and the only thing they praised in the entire video was a coffee shop in Maryland? 

They were like an hour away from Harpers Ferry and like a whole bunch of local West Virginia coffee shops used book stores historical sites all that stuff and they didn't even name drop the pizza place that they ordered from.

It's been a fun series to watch but it's really kind of disappointing and sad that when they got to our state they didn't seem to give a crap.

There's no footage of them driving through the beautiful mountains, probably went right through Charleston, didn't have to worry about anything bad making the trip take longer so plenty of time to stop and smell the roses but instead they trudged through.

1lpcp8y,https://www.reddit.com/r/FriendshipAdvice/comments/1lpcp8y/i_cant_handle_having_friends_apparently/,"I can't handle having friends, apparently.","For the record, this is a past issue ( like barely 2 months ago?) but I've recently been interacting with a lot of new people and it's making me think about this stuff to try to make sure it doesn't happen again and I've been getting pretty upset over it. Again.

I  used to live away from home for college (I'm 18) and had 6 roommates, but also a ton of other people would kind of he there all the time? Like this one guy and another girl. Then the second semester i had mostly the same roommates with 3 new ones but the others would still spend every day there. 

So, at any given time there was typically 10ish people in my apartment not including me. I've always been an introvert, and keep to myself. But I really wanted to bond so I wouldn't lonely away from home (This arrangement lasted 2 semesters so 8ish months) and tried super hard to hang out with them. 

I never felt fully included, but around month 5 things got a lot worse. 

It started when they gave me a list of all my flaws they wanted me to change (I was on new antidepressants which were working really well and I was being super social). It was stuff like—My sarcasm makes them think I'm mean, I get really loud when I'm excited, I'm 'uninviting' to their guests. 

For more info, by guests, they're referring to the 4-5 guys that they would have over in the middle of the night when I was trying to sleep. (All girl apartment fyi). They were NEVER quiet, always rapping Justin Bieber, cooking full meals, playing card games, drinking, etc. 

And I do have a dark sense of humor but it always felt like a double standard because they would make jokes WAY darker with each other but if I said the exact same thing a day later, the conversation would come to a halt. 

A few days after that, I was so upset I stopped talking to anyone, just stayed in my room. I would wait for them to go to bed to make myself dinner. Then when one of my roommates ran into me she asked if I was okay because I had been ""weirdly quiet lately"". 

Another big issue was this girl (I'll call her Jane for the sake of this) who I used to be really close with. Jane basically used me for food, funding, and would sleep in my bed without taking my feelings into account. During finals week I was also on my period- I paid for us to do something to hopefully relax us, but it ended in this fight where she kept calling me a bitch and said she didn't regret it because it was true. 

The VERY NEXT DAY she showed up at my apartment, smiled at me, and sat on my couch to do her homework. Day after day after day. She said she was friends with my roommates but she doesn't know anything about most of them. I wouldn't even have an issue with it if they invited her, but they didn't.

There were times when I would come home and she would be in my kitchen because they let her in and then everyone else left. I would start leaving my own apartment to feel comfortable and when I would ask my roommates if we could stop having her over they just said I needed to be civil and since Jane wasn't causing problems, I shouldn't either. 

Even when I pretty much gave up and would fully ignore Jane, they would still tell me i was being rude because it was clear i hadn't let things go and was making the atmosphere tense. I even asked once if they thought i deserved to feel comfortable in my own apartment and they said yet but followed it up with saying Jane also deserved to feel comfortable in our apartment. (And as much as she didn't know much roommates, they didn't know her either. Not her parents names, the city she was from, ect.) 

Then, there's all the other stuff... During spring break I stayed home alone while they all went places. I was violently I'll (told no one) and still managed to clean the entire apartment for everyone, plus make a ton of ice (we used it all super fast and had no ice maker just a small tray). 

When they all got back it was less than 24 hours before the sink was full of dishes, drying racks were everywhere, I was tripping on shoes, and the stove was disgusting. 

I was accused of ""hogging the ice""? Because I was taking up too much space in the freezer and it seemed like I made it for myself and no one wanted to touch it? 

I would ALWAYS do my dishes before leaving the kitchen, even if my own food got cold. I kept my shoes in my room, I never had my laptop or water bottles anywhere else but I was included in this roommate meeting where everyone discussed the importance of keeping the common space clean (nothing changed after said talk). 

I also got in trouble for using my waffle maker. I bought it and the mix but allowed everyone to use it. I made waffles one day and then cleaned the counter (3 of them were in the room and saw) then the next day there was a text asking who used it last and if I could clean properly. (Side note, the cups in the sink had mold from them being left before spring break)

There was this one night during finals where everyone was drinking and playing music and I was having an extremely bad day, so like usual, I stayed in my room until most of them left. I had Bluetooth on and went to make myself dinner, telling my mom I was really struggling (borderline tears) (it's 10pm maybe?) and get a text from the one roommate who stayed in saying (verbatim) ""hi - so you’re talking kinda loud (these walls are very thin) if you can just lower your voice a little that would be fantastic!!!!""

That same roommate also left the windows open all the time (we shared a bathroom) and would get super upset that I slammed the doors (which were very sturdy wood) at 3 am. But she would open them right before bed (letting mosquitos in) and I would shut the door in the dark and the wind snapped them shut. That wasn't a good answer I guess. 

There was this cup I wasn't allowed to use (one roommate specifically asked me not to) but everyone else used it all the time. I would use several coffee mugs for my water instead (since we only had that one tall glass and I hated walking into the kitchen every 30 minutes) but then they got upset that I would take multiple mugs. 

A few weeks after spring break, my respiratory infection came back. I was running a 103 fever and skipping classes on doctors order, but when I asked someone to go to the pharmacy with me (not even for, just with) they all said they were busy. I said okay and on the way out joked if they needed anything, then got an actual list— Reeces peanut butter cups, tea, popcorn, chips, and eggs. Because 

One roommate SWORE up and down that she and I were going to go to this place we had both been dying to see and I was super excited. Then she booked the trip with someone else and left without even telling me (I found out through her Instagram) 

That roommate spent a lot of time in my room for like a week straight and I would have the others knock on my door to come in, realize she wasnt there, then leave. 

We had this ""ranking"" system which was kind of a joking thing where if we passed tests we got put higher and if we did stupid stuff like breaking a bowl we got put lower. My name disappeared from it and when I asked to be out back on, they wouldn't. But a few days later Janes name showed up. Along with the guys who I never even met except through the walls at 4 am OR when a roommate would text me to ask me to let one of the guys in while I was the only one home. (Which I did, but hated.) 

Before classes ended and everyone went home they went out and had a huge roommate dinner celebration (about 13 people, pretty much the people from last semester and this one) and again, I found out on social media.   

So, now, it's been about 2 months since I've gotten home and I see them traveling acrose the country to visit each other and post happy birthdays to each other on their stories (my birthday passed with only one of them remembering.). I watch them talk in the group chat every single day, and keep up their posts but never make any. 

I just keep wondering what I did, you know? How was I more likeable depressed than when I was being treated and genuinely felt happy? I focused so much on every single work I spoke, my volume, my tone, just trying to make them like me. I drank with them even though I thought it was disgusting, I would go with them to buy their cigarettes even though I don't smoke, I would clean their dishes, put away their shoes, proofread their homework. I just don't understand?",1,1751402167.0,FriendshipAdvice,0,1.0,False

I found her attractive, asked her number and after a week of texting, I asked her to get coffee to “get to know her better.” She replied enthusiastically but said she’s traveling for three weeks, unless I am free the next day for a quick coffee.

Since then we have been texting every few days with her letting me know how her trip is going and she is set to come back tomorrow.

She asked me over text what I would be up to for the 4th of July as our convo naturally headed in that direction. I told her to let me know if she’s looking for plans and that “it would be fun to celebrate with her” to which she told me “Yes that sounds fun! Let me figure out what’s happening tomorrow when I’m back and I can let you know when I’m free 😊”

I’m pretty sure she doesn’t see herself as a mentor, she’s never talked about her work to me, and we’re in different fields. But I still don’t know if she realizes I was trying to make a move, or if she just sees me as a friend.

So where does that leave me? My main question though is, any ideas for what to do with her on the 4th? We’re both in DC, but I don’t have my own place to invite her to and I don’t want to go to a place to see the fireworks.",1,1751402040.0,Advice,4,1.0,False
1lpcn73,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1lpcn73/the_old_wolfgangs_dry_goods_building_is_gone/,The Old Wolfgang's Dry Goods Building is Gone,"My earliest memory of the old Wolfgang’s Dry Goods building, on 30th street, is a blurry mess of primary colors and flashing lights, metallic clangs and the sticky-sweet smell of stale popcorn and spilled soda.  It was occupied by Wham! Arcade then, in 1992, when I was six. My brother liked the arcade a lot more than I did.  I was a nervous kid, and I much preferred playing Super Mario Brothers on my Game Boy, alone in my room, to the loud rows of flashy machines with joysticks I could never grasp right.

I remember the little boy with the curly red hair asked me to play.  I’d seen him at Wham! before; he was a strange, quiet kid with eyes that never seemed to focus right.  My brother told me the boy was the son of the arcade’s owner - a surly, pudgy, perennially sweaty man who sat behind the prize counter, glaring. 

I agreed to play Mortal Kombat with the boy.  He led me to the console and popped in a quarter; we picked our characters, my heart began to race and my sweaty hands slipped and slid on the buttons, and I think I lasted thirty seconds before the game growled “fatality!” 

“Haha, you suck!” howled my brother, from the Alpha Magician machine.  

I hung my head in shame.  The little boy with curly red hair smiled kindly, though.  He extended a hand.

“Good game,” he said.  Then he froze in place, like a grinning statue.

I realized he expected me to reciprocate.  “Good game,” I responded.

\*\*\*\*\*

My next memory of the old Wolfgang’s Dry Goods building occurred five years later.  Not long after the red-headed boy handed me my ass at Mortal Kombat, Wham! Arcade went under.  A boutique selling willowy, flowery women’s clothes opened in the space; less than a year later, the store front had been abandoned.  Eventually, a used music shop took over the empty space.  Chip and Scratch’s CDs and Records.  There were dusty old albums displayed in the windows, and an infrequent flow of scruffy, greasy-haired men in pea coats in and out the doors.

My karate dojo was down the street.  Kostas, a thirteen-year-old brown belt, loved terrifying us younger kids with scary stories he’d lift from Short and Shivery and try and pass off as true.  

“This one’s real, though,” he insisted that day.  “Cross my heart and hope to die.  It happened to my Sunday school buddy’s cousin’s friend from soccer.  You know the record store across the street?  Chip and Scratch?  It’s haunted.”

A green belt snorted.  “You still believe in ghosts, Kostas?  That’s sad.”

“That’s *sensei* to you, Carrero.  The building was built in, like, 1900 by a guy named Wolfgang Stoude.  He had a store and sold random crap.  Wolfgang’s Dry Goods.  But later on, during prohibition, his real business was a speakeasy.  That means he sold illegal alcohol.”

“We know what a speakeasy is, Kostas,” said another boy.

“It’s sensei.  And yeah, he sold illegal alcohol in the basement of Wolfgang’s Dry Goods.  There was a secret door to go down there.  You couldn’t get in without the password.  And everybody used to say that old Wolfgang Stoude didn’t just keep liquor in the basement.  It’s where he buried the bodies of gangsters who pissed him off.”  

Kostas paused for effect.  I breathed deeply, in and out, trying to slow my racing heart.  I didn’t like horror stories.  

“My buddy’s cousin’s soccer friend was a dude named Kevin.  Before the record store opened, when the building was empty, he and a group of guys broke in because one of their brothers dared them to.  The other guys said it wasn’t even scary.  But Kevin got weird after.  Once, he asked my brother’s cousin if he knew ‘the man with suspenders and a hat’ following them.  But there was no man there.”

I wiped my sweaty hands on my karate pants.  I wanted to escape to the bathroom, but I didn’t want the guys to think I was a pussy.  

“He’d talk to people no one could see,” Kosstas continued.  “Ghosts.  Or, he’d run out of class randomly, screaming about a man with a gun.  He told my buddy’s cousin he woke up in the middle of the night, and there was someone on his chest trying to strangle him.  They wanted him to go back, he said.  Back to the abandoned Wolfgang’s Dry Goods building, to the basement.  Finally, he gave in and went.  And…”

Kostas paused again.  I twitched.  I wanted to cry.

“And then… he died!”  He announced dramatically.  “Kevin died.  He dropped dead in the middle of a soccer game.  My buddy’s cousin ran to him.  Kevin’s last words, before his eyes closed forever, were ‘please don’t let the man with the hat take me.’”

I slept with the lights on for a month.  

\*\*\*\*\*

My third memory of the old Wolfgang’s Dry Goods building takes place rather recently.  The storefront had been abandoned, again, for awhile - since the owner/operator of Gino’s Gyros was sent on a trip upriver, courtesy of the feds, for insurance fraud.  

I found the front door unlocked, as the property manager assured it would be.  My mission: scout a location for Tomato Tart, the second Neapolitan-style pizza joint by chef and Instagram influencer Kylie J.  Kylie was a friend from culinary school; she already ran one phenomenally-successful restaurant in the city and was ready to open her second, with me as the sous chef.

The old Wolfgang’s Dry Good building was… actually, it was quite nice.  It had an art deco feel - checkered tile floor, ornate geometric designs cut into the wood of the bar - combined with that of an Irish pub.  We’d need to do some remodeling, put in a pizza oven.  But the kitchen was spacious and already equipped with a large, walk-in fridge and freezer.  

Between the fridge and freezer, there was a door.

A narrow, wooden door - cut into the white plaster walls of the kitchen - with a green-tinged, metallic knob and fancy carved patterns to match the art deco bar outside.  There was a brass-colored placard at eye level, with a calligraphic word carved into it: PASSWORD.

*Password.*  With a whoosh of consciousness, I was eleven years old and in my karate dojo, listening to Kostas spinning a bullshit tale of his friend-of-a-friend kicking the bucket on the soccer field, pursued by invisible 20’s gangsters.  I breathed in the faintest whiff of stale popcorn and sticky spilled soda.  I suddenly wanted to be as far away from the abandoned restaurant as I could get.  

Then, I remembered I was a nearly forty-year-old man, not an anxious kid.  

I took some pictures for Kylie, then shut off the lights and locked the door behind me.  *Fitting*, I thought.  *I’m back at the scene of my humiliating Mortal Kombat loss, the site of my biting childhood failure.*  The last few years of my life, I’d marinated in failure.  

I started west, towards the subway overpass.  Well.  Maybe it all was a sign my days of failure were over.  As soon as we nailed down a location, I’d be Kylie J’s right-hand man.  The train rumbled into the station overhead.  

“You’re gonna tank this restaurant like you tanked yours, Jon” a sharp voice snapped, right behind me.

I whirled around.  There was no one there. 

\*\*\*\*\*

As it turned out, Kostas was full of shit.  

After sending the pictures to Kylie, I curled up at a Yemeni coffee shop with my laptop and an iced adeni chai.  My return to the old Wolfgang’s Dry Goods building had inspired me to fact-check Kostas’ dumb karate class story.  A seventh-grader dropping dead during a soccer game would be a rare enough occurrence to make the news; I skimmed old archives, Google’d key words, and posted the story on the local subreddit.  

Old newspapers and obituaries gave me nothing.  No hallucinating little soccer player named Kevin, tragically struck down on the field.  On Reddit, though, a user build-a-bae posted a Letter to the Editor published in her hometown Connecticut paper, from 1993.  She’d kept it because she thought it was funny.

**Always Know Where Your Kids Are**

*My sister-in-law, a psychiatric nurse in New York City, recently related to me the tragic tale of a sixteen-year-old girl, Rebecca.  Young Rebecca, like many young people, fell in with the wrong crowd at school.  Her new friends’ lives were consumed with drugs, Dungeons and Dragons, and heavy metal music.  And soon, so was Rebecca’s.*

*On Halloween, this clique of young people broke into an abandoned store.  They did drugs, then performed a ritual with an ouija board.  Harmless fun, Rebecca’s friends insisted.  But only days later, Rebecca became convinced something was constantly behind her.  She asked her mother if she saw the “man with thousands of eyes.”  She described a creature with goat horns and hooves, who stared back at her from inside the mirror.* 

*Then one night, Rebecca ate dinner with her mother.  She stood abruptly and, face twisted in fear, whispered “the goat man wants me to come with him.”  Then, she collapsed.  The paramedics couldn’t revive her.  She’d died of a sudden heart attack.*  

Aside from a few details, this supposedly true story was a carbon copy of the one Kostas told in karate class, years later.  He must’ve heard it somewhere and adapted it to take place in our little corner of the city.  

Not only was Kostas a liar, he couldn’t even come up with his own material. 

Another Redditor chimed in.  User WeaponizedBlonde7171 recalled another version of the same tale - presented to her, as something that *really happened* to a brother’s co-worker in a Faraway City, by her high school sex ed teacher.  

*She said this guy broke into a comic book store to have unprotected sex with his girlfriend*, WeaponizedBlonde7171 wrote, *and he got syphilis.  The syphilis made him go crazy.  Like, he hallucinated all the time.  He’d ask if anyone else saw the big, blue tiger.  He thought a monkey was following him around.  Finally, he broke into the same comic book store again because, deep in his psychosis, he thought it would cure him.  And he actually got better!  Then, he relapsed and died.*  

*Y’all.  This story made me a virgin until COLLEGE.* 

I realized then: the horror story that scared eleven-year-old me senseless was an urban legend.  Typically, multiple versions of an urban legend exist; the basic structure is the same, with enough wiggle room for the teller to improvise the details, based on their own or their culture’s experiences and fears.  Kostas’ mistake? He made his story too local.  The power of urban legends is that they always happen in an unspecified, faraway place.  Kostas’ utilization of the old Wolfgang’s Dry Goods building made his tall tale all too easy to fact-check.

“Hey Jon, the restaurant will burn, and you’ll drag her down with you!”  The same sharp, harsh voice in my ear.

I sprung to my feet and did a 360.  I was alone, save for the bored-looking girl behind the counter, completely involved in her phone.  Something moved in the corner of my eye.  A black cockroach, ducking back into a hole in the wooden baseboards.  

I took that as a sign it was time to pack my things and go home.  As I walked out the door, I could’ve sworn I caught the scent of popcorn and sugary cornstarch.  I trembled.

\*\*\*\*\*

My meeting with my old friend Leona didn’t put me in a better mood.

Two weeks had passed since I set foot back in the old Wolfgang’s Dry Goods building.  Kylie said she liked the pictures.  She wasn’t sold, though.  The place was too close to the noisy train tracks.  If it were any other location, I’d have been frustrated to the point of blind fury.  The rent was considerably cheaper than we had any right to expect, anywhere in the city. 

That particular location, though?  I’d be lying if I said it didn’t give me the heebs.

I’d heard the scratchy, disembodied voice three more times.  

The first time, I was at work at TGI Friday’s, alone in the break room, guzzling a Red Bull before returning to the line.  

“You’re a fat, old loser,” the voice hissed in my ear.  “Nearly forty years old, Jon, and this is all you have to show for yourself?”

On the floor under the lockers, two cockroaches scurried around each other and into a discarded Ramen cup.  I tossed my drink and ran.

The second time, I was at the park with my kids.  Theo bonded with a beagle in the dog run while Kassidy flew higher and higher on the swings. 

“It’s your fault you lost the house.  When they learn that, they’ll never forgive you.”

Panic seized up in my chest.  Was I schizophrenic?  Experiencing a side effect of alcohol withdrawal related to my 38-day-old abstinence from the stuff?  I made a mental note to call my GP on Monday.  I gathered the kids and told them it was time to leave, bribing them with the promise of gelato.  

The third time was later that same day.  I’d just gotten off the train, having completed the last leg of the epic trip to return my kids to their mother in the suburbs.  As I walked back to the one-bedroom apartment I sublet, I passed by a lively dive bar.  Unpretentious, the sort of place where weekend warriors played lousy pool and sung tone-deaf karaoke.  

“You should go in,” the voice taunted.  “Everyone knows this bullshit AA thing isn’t going to last.”

I whirled around, fists clenched.  My invisible friend could scare me in the break room all it wanted, but if it thought it could screw with my sobriety, it had another thing coming.  

But - as I’d come to expect - I was alone on the street.  Alone, except for a dark horde of cockroaches in the gutter, crawling around a discarded kebab sandwich.  

\*\*\*\*\*

“Have you noticed more roaches out lately?” I asked Leona.  “It’s January.  They’re supposed to stay in their hidey-holes until June.”

Leona shrugged.  “Not really.”

Leona Burrell agreed to meet me at a Starbucks by my apartment.  We’d been friends for years, ever since our days at L’Petit Rose French Bistro - her, the night supervisor; me, the twitchy new line cook.  When Kylie finally settled on a location for Tomato Tart, I intended to hire Leona on as the general manager.  

“That location, the one you told me about,” Leona said, “I know it.  I don’t want to work there again.”

“The old Wolfgang’s Dry Goods building?  You worked there before?""

She nodded.  “Yeah.  Back in 2004.  Toddy’s Bean Town?  It was a coffee shop, with a kinda Central Perk from Friends vibe. I worked as a barista there for a few years in my 20’s, until it went out of business.  It was fine.  But one of my co-workers got a stalker.”

Something cold settled on my skin at the word *stalker*.  “Like an ex-boyfriend?”  I asked Leona. 

“Boyfriend is stretching it,” Leona said.  “He was a customer, this harmless-looking dude.  They went on one date.  She didn’t feel a spark; he - well, he started popping up everywhere.  Her college campus.  Her apartment.  Even her mom’s house.”

“Did… did the police ever get the guy?” I asked, wiping my sweaty palms on my jeans.

She rolled her eyes.  “Stalking laws were trash in the early 2000’s.  And she died.”

My heartbeat accelerated like a rollercoaster.  “He killed her?”

“Not exactly,” Leona said sadly.  “She had a brain aneurysm, a genetic thing.  But I’m pretty sure the stress of the situation didn’t make it better.”

“I’m sorry,” I told Leona.  I didn’t know what else to say.  *You ever hear the urban legend where*… seemed inappropriate.  

We sat in silence for a moment, sipping out coffees.  

“There was an arcade in that building once, too,” Leona said finally.  

I frowned.  “You knew Wham! Arcade?”

“Yeah.  Wham! Arcade, that’s what it was called.  The kids I baby-sat were obsessed.  I’d always end up getting roped into losing a game to this little boy, David.  The owner’s son.”

“The kid with curly red hair?” I asked, cringing involuntarily at the memory.

“Yep.  He was a real-life arcade wizard,” she said.  “I never saw him lose a game.  I’m glad he had something though, poor little guy.”

“What do you mean?”

She eyed me like I was the most oblivious person in the world.  “Jon, you seriously didn’t notice?  I was ten, and I picked up on it.”

“Picked up on what?”  An uncomfortable sourness curdled in my veins.

“He was skinny, like malnourished skinny.  And there were always bruises all over him.”

\*\*\*\*\*

I hadn’t looked at my Reddit post in weeks.  After my coffee with Leona, though, I had an irresistible impulse to check in and see if any other Redditors had chimed in with added perspective.  

Because.  Because… I didn’t know.  I couldn’t say the words, not even to myself.  *I’m a nearly 40-year-old adult and father.  I’m not a nervous kid.*  

Reddit, though?  Reddit delivered.  Oh, did it ever deliver.  

First, user BoilandBass3500 had done some research.  He gave us all the full history of the old Wolfgang’s Dry Goods building.  

*Construction was begun in 1912 and finished in 1913,* he wrote.  *Wolfgang Stoude, the original owner, ran a dry goods store there until his death in 1928.  His son took over the business, but it went under during the Great Depression, and the building remained an empty, poorly-maintained bank property until it was purchased by Bluebell Properties United in 1940 and leased to a Walgreen Drug Store.  The Walgreens closed in 1974.  The building housed a disco club for a short time, then a men’s clothing store.*  

*From 1983 to 1993, Wham! Arcade occupied the store front.  After the arcade was unexpectedly abandoned, a series of businesses opened and closed in the spot: Laura’s Boutique (1995-1996), Chip n’ Scratch Records (1997-1999), The Bar on the Tracks (1999-2002), Toddy’s Bean Town (2002-2004), Loew & Ludwig Coffee (2004-2005), Hammadi Kebabs (2005-2010), Amato Pizzeria (2010-2011), The Grey Cat Tearoom (2011-2012), Big Time Natural Foods (2012-2013), Larsen’s Market (2013-2015), The Dog Place (2015-2016), Black Rain Bakery (2016-2017), Bubbles Tavern (2017-2018), The Acai Lover (2018-2019), The Nut House (2019-2020), Kawaii Boba (2020-2021), Just Grilled (2021-2022), and Gino’s Gyros (2022-2023).*  

I counted.  Twenty-three businesses in total.  Since 2010, only one lasted longer than a year.  That was a lot.  Even in the fickle, high-risk-high-reward city entrepreneurial scene, that was a lot. 

After that, Redditors posted a series of urban legends - different, now, from the first few I’d read.  These urban legends didn’t take place in an unspecified locale, far away.  Each and every one centered on the old Wolfgang’s Dry Goods building and the twenty-three businesses that had operated and failed there.

User ICaughttheFlyingSausage: Oh crap, not that place.  My dumbass friend dated a girl whose brother worked at the grilled cheese shop.  The brother told her the building had been built on top of an ancient Native American graveyard.  He swore ghostly Native American warriors were chasing him around the city.

User TurboGerbil1925: This hippie chick my ex-boyfriend used to smoke weed with told him it was built on a faerie circle.  Apparently her boss pissed off the other side.  I think she worked there when it was a natural foods store?  Anyways, the boss had some sort of a mental breakdown.  I think he ended up dying.  

User RunnerintheNight42: LOL Wut?  You know a serial killer used to be a cook at the pizza joint, right?  He’d lure chicks to the basement and seal their bodies up in the walls.

User LoloPanda: I heard the woman who ran the Grey Cat Tearoom was a witch.  When her business failed during the recession, she put a curse on the store.  That’s why no business ever succeeds there for longer than two years.  

User AtticCat1290: This is a throwaway.  Can you DM me?  I think we should talk in person.

I didn’t know what to make of all these accounts - or how they related to me, or the voice, or the cockroaches I kept spotting, or Leona’s victimized coffee shop co-worker, or little red-haired David, the arcade owner’s son.  So I ignored AtticCat1290’s request.  I turned off my computer.  I went to CVS and invested in a can of Raid.

\*\*\*\*\*

Long past midnight, I jerked awake.  I felt something small and itchy brush against my leg, or maybe my eyes snapped open because my spidey-senses alerted me I wasn’t alone.  Through my bedroom window, the city lights cast a pale, silvery column across the floor.  A small, fast-moving blotch jutted into the light, then disappeared in the darkness.  

I sat up in bed and reached for my light.  Wispy, disorganized legs skittered across my hand.  I jerked back as I pulled the chain.

My room was coated in cockroaches.

Hundreds of cockroaches.  Cockroaches clustering in the windows, up the walls, stacked in corners.  Thousands of tiny legs sprinting across the floor.  Quivering feelers, flitting wings, cockroaches piling on top of each other and mating and fighting and scaling the walls and skittering across the ceiling.

I closed my eyes and screamed.  I screamed until I couldn’t breathe.

I opened my eyes, panting and gasping for air.  The cockroaches were gone.  

Then, the voices started.  There were many of them now - male and female, guttural and nasal, vicious whispers and mocking taunts.

*How did you get so fat, Jon?  You’re a slightly better father than you are a businessman, but that bar is practically on the floor.  Your face looks like a French bulldog crossed with a rat.  You’re such a loser.  Do you fully comprehend how embarrassed your parents are to have spawned you?  Thank God your brother’s successful, or they’d probably kill themselves in shame.  Your ex-wife is better off without you.  Your kids are better off without you.*  

I couldn’t take it anymore.  I stood up, threw on jeans and a sweatshirt, grabbed my laptop, and ran out of my apartment.

*If you want us to go away*, a sing-song female voice cajoled, *you know where to find us!*

I took refuge in a 24-hour diner.  Kylie had sent me a message.  *Went to see the potential location by the river,* she’d typed.  *The plumbing doesn’t work.  Surprise!  You’ll never guess how much money this low-life property manager had the absolute gall to quote me.  Let’s talk more about the place you saw tomorrow.  I’ll deal with the noisy train so long as the toilets flush.* 

She was warming up to the old Wolfgang’s Dry Goods building.  The place where twenty-three businesses failed.  The cursed location, claimed by faeries and ghostly Native American warriors, where a serial killer buried dead girls in the basement walls.  

I logged onto Reddit and messaged AtticCat1290.  I asked when and where she wanted to meet.

\*\*\*\*\*

AtticCat1290, Claudia, met me at a hipster-ish coffee shop.  

Claudia was a bony blonde in her mid-thirties; a bank assistant manager.  She had a prominent nose and wide-set eyes, and her skin wrinkled in a way that gave the impression of rapid, recent weight loss.  She picked at her nails as we spoke, her eyes darting to and fro.

“You think the old Wolfgang’s Dry Goods building is haunted,” I said.

She pursed her lips.  “I don’t know.  Haunted might be the wrong word.  I’d say… it chose me.  The place chooses people.”

I nodded. 

“I used to walk by the building on my way to the train,” she explained.  “Back when the grilled cheese shop was there, I’d stop for a coffee and a breakfast sandwich a couple times a week.  I got friendly with this young guy who worked there… a kid named Sam.  We’d talk about TV shows and baseball.  Well one day, Sam disappeared.  His co-worker told me he’d had a mental breakdown. I felt sad, but there wasn’t much I could do.  It’s not like we were besties.”

Something tugged unpleasantly on my id.  *My dumbass friend dated a girl whose brother worked at the grilled cheese shop.*  The Reddit thread.  The guy who’d been chased by ghost warriors.  

“I kept on going to the grilled cheese place, and then when it shut down, the gyro place,” Claudia continued.  “I… I can’t explain what happened.  Just, I’ve always been nervous about doctors and hospitals and medical stuff.  I had allergies when I was a kid; I was poked so many times I developed a lifelong fear of needles.  But that all happened years ago, and I thought I’d gotten over it.”

She took a deep breath.  “Suddenly, one day, I started seeing these… these people in white scrubs with caps and masks.  Standing there, on a street corner or subway platform, staring at me.  Sometimes, holding a cartoonishly huge syringe with a giant needle.  No one else could see them but me.  At first, they kept their distance.  Then, one appeared in an elevator.  Then I woke up to a giant man in scrubs standing over my bed.”

I trembled.  Goosebumps rose on my arms.  

“I see cockroaches,” I told her.  

She raised her eyebrows.  “Are you scared of bugs?”

“Not exactly.”  I took a deep breath.  “I used to co-own a restaurant.  Diego’s Hideout.  Mexican fusion.”

Claudia looked confused.  I decided to not feel offended she’d never heard of my restaurant.  She’d been honest with me, I could be honest with her.

“We were successful.  Ridiculously successful.  A couple people complained they’d seen roaches in the dining room, but I didn’t think it was an immediate problem.  It was the city in the summer.  There’s roaches everywhere.  Then one morning I walked into the kitchen, and the entire place was crawling with cockroaches.  The were all over the floor and walls and the dishes in the sink.”

My body twitched.  Words couldn’t do justice to the physical, icky sensation of watching those legs and feelers and crusty wings writhe and clutter. 

“We had to shut down for two weeks,” I continued.  “Word got out why, and we never recovered.  Turns out, no one wants to eat at the roach restaurant.  We went bankrupt four months later.  Oh, and to make things even better - I’d just taken out a mortgage I could no longer afford, and my wife and I lost the house.  She left me.  I started drinking while the sun was still up.  And now, I’m seeing roaches everywhere and hearing psycho disembodied voices.”

Claudia stared at me, considering.

“They wanted me to go back,” she said finally, firmly.  “The creepy figures in scrubs wanted me to return to the building - the gyro place - and then go down to the basement.  I didn’t want to do it.  The gyro place shut down, and I didn’t want to be hanging around an abandoned store front.  But they wouldn’t stop.  The doctors and nurses with masks and syringes - they were everywhere.  At my job.  In my apartment.  So, I did it.”

Her eyes flickered in remembrance.  I suddenly thought of the wooden door in the kitchen, the art deco piece politely enquiring after a password.

“There was an arcade in the basement,” Claudia said.

It took me a second to process her words.  “An arcade?  The whole building used to be an arcade.”

“Yeah, well, apparently they left the games in the basement.  All these old 80s style machines.  I could only get one to work: a fighter game, like Mortal Kombat.  The gist was, you played an adventurer battling it out with Native American spirit guardians to find a buried treasure in an old graveyard.  It was actually really racist.  And I lost in about two seconds.  As soon as I lost, though… it was over.”

“Like, you stopped hallucinating?” I cut in, suddenly caught up in a wave of hope.

She sighed.  “Yeah.  But… it might be more complicated.  Because that kid I talked about?  Sam, the sandwich shop guy who had a mental breakdown?  I learned later that he’d died.”

\*\*\*\*\*

I couldn’t pick the lock on the old Wolfgang’s Dry Goods building while it was still light out.  No way that wouldn’t get me a free night in a jail cell.  So I waited until four in the morning, chugging Red Bull at the deli until the last of the bar patrons stumbled to the subway, leaving me alone on the street.

If the nameless spirits of the Wolfgang’s Dry Goods building wanted me to play video games in the basement arcade, then video games I would play.  

The lock snapped open in seconds.  I found my way through the abandoned restaurant with the flashlight on my phone.  Steeped in darkness, the once-welcoming atmosphere had become gloomy and imposing.  The wood-paneled walls trapped the blackness.  The geometric, art deco carvings threw jarring shadows.  

I wandered into the kitchen, up to the little wooden door between the fridge and freezer.  I tried the greenish, metallic knob.  It didn’t so much as jiggle.  The door was locked.  Locked, it appeared from the inside.

I stared into the placard.  PASSWORD.  

The basement, where Wolfgang Stoude kept his bootlegged alcohol.  Where, apparently, the arcade’s owner had stashed his collection of consoles.  I recalled Wham! Arcade closed suddenly - no warning; just a chain on the door one morning.  *The poor little boy*, Leona said.  Little David, the kid with curly red hair.  

PASSWORD.

“Good game,” I said to the door.  

There was a snap, then a creak.  The door popped open.  I pulled it wide, and found myself staring down a set of wooden stairs.

I smelled stale popcorn and sticky-sweet spilled soda.  As I climbed carefully down the stairs, I heard metallic trills and jaunty, computerized music.  Bright lights flashed, multicolored, against the walls.  And then, I was there.

It was just as Claudia said it would be.  Just as Wham! Arcade once had been.  Rows of giant computer consoles with dancing graphics and greasy joysticks.  

The first game I came to was called Nephilim.  It looked like a fighter game; the sides decorated with disturbing images of eye-covered men and goat-headed women.  Next to Nephilim sat Speakeasy, a shooter game.  Prohibition-themed, you had to fire at hat- and suspenders-wearing thugs come to steal your stash.  Across the room, a pastel-colored Pac Man-esque game: Escape from the Zoo.  Instead of PacMan ghosts, you got chased by blue tigers and purple monkeys.  

I didn’t question how the flashing lights and dancing graphics were even possible, as the electricity in the building had been shut off for months.

I walked down the rows, passing FaerieQuest and The Grey Witch’s Cat and an extremely kid-inappropriate (and generally problematic) game called Rear Window, in which you had to stalk a girl through a series of obstacles.  Then Homicide 911, where you were tasked with picking up enough clues to jail a serial killer before he murdered again.  Beside that, I spotted Graves of our Ancestors, decorated with moderately-offensive Native American imagery.  I guessed this was the game Claudia had played.  

I pressed buttons and looked for coin slots.  But the only game that worked properly, the only one I was allowed to play, was the game furthest from the door on the right.

HOSPITAL NIGHTMARES!!  It was called.  According to the graphics, it worked a bit like Frogger.  I needed to avoid mad scientists trying to inject me with serum.

As soon as I grasped the joystick, my hands began to sweat.  I felt my heart pounding in my ears as the bouncy music swelled.  I shook as I tried to remember which button did what.  *People are staring.  I’m going to fail.  Just like I always fail.*

A melancholy trill from the game.  “Fatality!” A computerized voice croaked.  

I stepped back.  Watched my pathetic avatar collapse to the ground while a ghoulish doctor laughed maniacally.  

There was peace in failure.  *Now, I can go back to my room and play Super Mario Brothers to my heart’s content.*

\*\*\*\*\*

I don’t remember leaving the basement arcade, or taking zigzagging trains home, or collapsing into bed.  The next day, I awoke past noon from the best sleep of my life.  I didn’t see any more cockroaches, or hear the voices.  I worked a shift, then made plans with Kylie, then went to an AA meeting.  

I texted Claudia a couple times.  I told her she was right, an operating arcade had been squatting in the old Wolfgang’s Dry Goods building’s basement.  

For days, she ignored me. 

Then today, someone texted me back.  Claudia’s sister.  She told me Claudia was dead.  Sudden cardiac death, a heart attack in her sleep, secondary to some structural problem she hadn’t known she had.  I offered the sister my condolences.  I said I’d only known her for a short time, but Claudia was there for me when I needed honesty and direction, and for that I’d eternally be thankful.

I tried really hard not to think about the fact that she’d died the exact same night I’d broken into the old Wolfgang’s Dry Goods building and gone down to the arcade in the basement.  

Or that her time of death was uncomfortably close to the time I must’ve lost miserably at the Hospital Nightmares game.

\*\*\*\*\*

All right.  So.  Um… not sure what to say here.

This is Jose, Jon’s brother.  I found this account on my brother’s computer.  If you’re reading this, I’m really sorry to break it to you, but Jon passed away three weeks ago.  We’re still waiting on autopsy results, but we think it was an aortic aneurysm rupture.  

I’m tempted to say my brother must’ve been losing it.  That he was suffering from either an undiagnosed mental condition or a brain tumor.  But his Reddit post is still up.  And… and I don’t know.  This is all too weird for me.

Basically, I see the situation, as Jon saw it, as thus: the old Wolfgang’s Dry Goods building is haunted by a supernatural entity.  This entity chooses people.  It latches onto them, stalks them, casts horrific hallucinations, plays off their fears and insecurities.  It lures them in, then leads them along a breadcrumb trail to the arcade in the basement.

Here’s where it gets tricky.  The quarry - my brother Jon, or Claudia before him - plays one game.  What they’re playing for is the life of the *previous* quarry, against a game based on the previous quarry’s specific narrative and hallucinations.  Claudia lost her game, so Sam the sandwich guy died.  Jon lost his game - the game with a killer hospital and insane doctors - and Claudia died.  Following this logic, I’m left to assume the building claimed another quarry after Jon.  That new quarry found their way to the basement, where they played a game against… I don’t know, a giant cockroach or something.  They lost the game.  Then Jon died.

It’s the stuff of fairy tales.  An entity that… collects people.  Takes possession of their fears, and their stories, and keeps them locked in a basement in the form of 90’s-style arcade games.  

I’d say it’s all a stupid urban legend.  

Except.  Except - 

The old Wolfgang’s Dry Goods building is gone.  It caught on fire - accidentally or intentionally, no one is sure, and no one particularly cares - and by the time the firefighters got there the building was beyond saving.  There were no old arcade games found in the basement.  The basement was empty.  However, the crew cleaning up the debris made a gruesome discovery, sealed into the basement walls. 

A small corpse.  The remains of a five to seven-year-old child, shoved into the insulation and plastered over, hidden away for years and forgotten.  The child’s cause of death was likely related to a giant crack in the skull.

A DNA test revealed the dead kid to be David M.  It’s suspected he died at the hands of his father, Wayne M, who owned the Wham! Arcade in the 80’s and 90’s.",7,1751402037.0,nosleep,0,0.99,False

1lpcm0f,https://www.reddit.com/r/venting/comments/1lpcm0f/please_be_honest_about_why_im_hard_to_like_not/,"Please be honest about why I'm hard to like? Not trying to play the victim, I swear. (Click if you enjoy teenage drama, lol)","For the record, this is a past issue ( like barely 2 months ago?) but I've recently been interacting with a lot of new people and it's making me think about this stuff to try to make sure it doesn't happen again and I've been getting pretty upset over it. Again.

I  used to live away from home for college (I'm 18) and had 6 roommates, but also a ton of other people would kind of he there all the time? Like this one guy and another girl. Then the second semester i had mostly the same roommates with 3 new ones but the others would still spend every day there. 

So, at any given time there was typically 10ish people in my apartment not including me. I've always been an introvert, and keep to myself. But I really wanted to bond so I wouldn't lonely away from home (This arrangement lasted 2 semesters so 8ish months) and tried super hard to hang out with them. 

I never felt fully included, but around month 5 things got a lot worse. 

It started when they gave me a list of all my flaws they wanted me to change (I was on new antidepressants which were working really well and I was being super social). It was stuff like—My sarcasm makes them think I'm mean, I get really loud when I'm excited, I'm 'uninviting' to their guests. 

For more info, by guests, they're referring to the 4-5 guys that they would have over in the middle of the night when I was trying to sleep. (All girl apartment fyi). They were NEVER quiet, always rapping Justin Bieber, cooking full meals, playing card games, drinking, etc. 

And I do have a dark sense of humor but it always felt like a double standard because they would make jokes WAY darker with each other but if I said the exact same thing a day later, the conversation would come to a halt. 

A few days after that, I was so upset I stopped talking to anyone, just stayed in my room. I would wait for them to go to bed to make myself dinner. Then when one of my roommates ran into me she asked if I was okay because I had been ""weirdly quiet lately"". 

Another big issue was this girl (I'll call her Jane for the sake of this) who I used to be really close with. Jane basically used me for food, funding, and would sleep in my bed without taking my feelings into account. During finals week I was also on my period- I paid for us to do something to hopefully relax us, but it ended in this fight where she kept calling me a bitch and said she didn't regret it because it was true. 

The VERY NEXT DAY she showed up at my apartment, smiled at me, and sat on my couch to do her homework. Day after day after day. She said she was friends with my roommates but she doesn't know anything about most of them. I wouldn't even have an issue with it if they invited her, but they didn't.

There were times when I would come home and she would be in my kitchen because they let her in and then everyone else left. I would start leaving my own apartment to feel comfortable and when I would ask my roommates if we could stop having her over they just said I needed to be civil and since Jane wasn't causing problems, I shouldn't either. 

Even when I pretty much gave up and would fully ignore Jane, they would still tell me i was being rude because it was clear i hadn't let things go and was making the atmosphere tense. I even asked once if they thought i deserved to feel comfortable in my own apartment and they said yet but followed it up with saying Jane also deserved to feel comfortable in our apartment. (And as much as she didn't know much roommates, they didn't know her either. Not her parents names, the city she was from, ect.) 

Then, there's all the other stuff... During spring break I stayed home alone while they all went places. I was violently I'll (told no one) and still managed to clean the entire apartment for everyone, plus make a ton of ice (we used it all super fast and had no ice maker just a small tray). 

When they all got back it was less than 24 hours before the sink was full of dishes, drying racks were everywhere, I was tripping on shoes, and the stove was disgusting. 

I was accused of ""hogging the ice""? Because I was taking up too much space in the freezer and it seemed like I made it for myself and no one wanted to touch it? 

I would ALWAYS do my dishes before leaving the kitchen, even if my own food got cold. I kept my shoes in my room, I never had my laptop or water bottles anywhere else but I was included in this roommate meeting where everyone discussed the importance of keeping the common space clean (nothing changed after said talk). 

I also got in trouble for using my waffle maker. I bought it and the mix but allowed everyone to use it. I made waffles one day and then cleaned the counter (3 of them were in the room and saw) then the next day there was a text asking who used it last and if I could clean properly. (Side note, the cups in the sink had mold from them being left before spring break)

There was this one night during finals where everyone was drinking and playing music and I was having an extremely bad day, so like usual, I stayed in my room until most of them left. I had Bluetooth on and went to make myself dinner, telling my mom I was really struggling (borderline tears) (it's 10pm maybe?) and get a text from the one roommate who stayed in saying (verbatim) ""hi - so you’re talking kinda loud (these walls are very thin) if you can just lower your voice a little that would be fantastic!!!!""

That same roommate also left the windows open all the time (we shared a bathroom) and would get super upset that I slammed the doors (which were very sturdy wood) at 3 am. But she would open them right before bed (letting mosquitos in) and I would shut the door in the dark and the wind snapped them shut. That wasn't a good answer I guess. 

There was this cup I wasn't allowed to use (one roommate specifically asked me not to) but everyone else used it all the time. I would use several coffee mugs for my water instead (since we only had that one tall glass and I hated walking into the kitchen every 30 minutes) but then they got upset that I would take multiple mugs. 

A few weeks after spring break, my respiratory infection came back. I was running a 103 fever and skipping classes on doctors order, but when I asked someone to go to the pharmacy with me (not even for, just with) they all said they were busy. I said okay and on the way out joked if they needed anything, then got an actual list— Reeces peanut butter cups, tea, popcorn, chips, and eggs. Because 

One roommate SWORE up and down that she and I were going to go to this place we had both been dying to see and I was super excited. Then she booked the trip with someone else and left without even telling me (I found out through her Instagram) 

That roommate spent a lot of time in my room for like a week straight and I would have the others knock on my door to come in, realize she wasnt there, then leave. 

We had this ""ranking"" system which was kind of a joking thing where if we passed tests we got put higher and if we did stupid stuff like breaking a bowl we got put lower. My name disappeared from it and when I asked to be out back on, they wouldn't. But a few days later Janes name showed up. Along with the guys who I never even met except through the walls at 4 am OR when a roommate would text me to ask me to let one of the guys in while I was the only one home. (Which I did, but hated.) 

Before classes ended and everyone went home they went out and had a huge roommate dinner celebration (about 13 people, pretty much the people from last semester and this one) and again, I found out on social media.   

So, now, it's been about 2 months since I've gotten home and I see them traveling acrose the country to visit each other and post happy birthdays to each other on their stories (my birthday passed with only one of them remembering.). I watch them talk in the group chat every single day, and keep up their posts but never make any. 

I just keep wondering what I did, you know? How was I more likeable depressed than when I was being treated and genuinely felt happy? I focused so much on every single work I spoke, my volume, my tone, just trying to make them like me. I drank with them even though I thought it was disgusting, I would go with them to buy their cigarettes even though I don't smoke, I would clean their dishes, put away their shoes, proofread their homework.

Do people  even match in IM with scores in 22x??even in community hospitals?

She said it was heated but she didn’t say anything disrespectful to “merit” that. They were at a birthday party an hour earlier and he had a little too much to drink.

1lpcecw,https://www.reddit.com/r/badroommates/comments/1lpcecw/having_indian_roommates/,Having Indian Roommates,"This post is pretty much just going to be a rant - But also curious to see if anyone else is dealing with the same problem.

Right now I am in college studying Economics, previously served in the Navy. And the reason I mention my prior experience in the military, is for context. I think everyone knows that people who serve are basically trained to be clean, organized, and to pay attention to detail.

But now that I am out, I pretty much have stayed the same way regarding cleanliness, being organized. I have become the type of person that needs to have everything clean before I do anything else. The kitchen and dishes always have to be cleaned and put away. I hate having a dirty floor or things in general not being organized and put away.

I've recently moved into a new apartment with some new roommates who are all from India. Within the first week of moving into this place, I had a piece a furniture that I moved into the living room - an egg shaped hanging chair. This first week of living there, someone already broke the chair. I had that chair for 9 months prior with zero problems. I tried to not make a big deal about it and just move on.

As I try my best to socialize with my roommates and their friends more often (Who are also all Indian), I've noticed there is a disconnect whenever I am present in the room. It's like whenever I sit in the room, they make it obvious that I'm the outsider of the group, and every time that happens - either one person or multiple people make an excuse that they have to leave.

Another problem that I have, is that there is one guy who lives two floors below us - And he often comes to our apartment unannounced almost on a daily basis. And almost every time he comes up here, he's going through our fridge and then would complain to one my roommates that there's nothing to eat that he would like (Well no shit, it's not your home anyways). This guy is here everyday and he talks very loudly and waaay too much. Sometimes I would sit in my room listening to him talk, and it's ONLY him talking and I never hear my roommates responding to what he says. If only he was the only person that was like this - Unfortunately there are two people who are like this and keeps constantly coming to our place everyday.

I confronted one of my roommates asking is it normal for Indians to constantly hangout with people everyday and always talking on the phone, even for the smallest things? And he pretty much said yes, it's normal in India to call someone even to just ask a question rather than texting.

I tried to get used to this because I didn't want to be the bad roommate, but I'm at the point where I'm getting tired of hearing people constantly coming in and out of our apartment and constantly hearing someone talking on the phone all hours of the day.

The most recent issue I had was involving my milk that I bought. Now they also drink milk as well, but the carton that they use different from mine. But somehow, ""they couldn't tell the difference between my milk and theirs"" so that's they used it. This incident happened three times. The first time, I just bought the milk - the next morning, half of my milk is gone because someone wanted to make coffee. I saw the milk, got mad and just dump the rest of the milk into my large canteen. And noticed right away, when someone else asked, ""Where's the milk?""... it really pissed me off because they're either very clueless or very entitled. (Or just stupid). The second and third time happened in the same week, actually - two days in a row. I just bought two new cartons of milk, and I know my roommate saw me bring it in because he was in the living room watching me take out my groceries. Now they already had two of their own cartons of milk in a different shape. I went to the fridge the next day, one of MINE is basically fucking empty. Why? Because the same day I bought my milk, my roommates later decided to have like 7+ people over and were there practically all day (Nothing new) - And my roommate was making tea for all of them using my milk, instead of his own...

I confronted him asking him why did he use my milk and why is it almost empty? His response, ""I didn't use your milk, it must've been someone else"". I called my other roommate, which I already knew it wasn't him anyways because most of the time he lives with his girlfriend - but he already confirmed to me what I already knew, that it wasn't him who used it because his groceries is at his girlfriends house. So basically this guy just basically lied to my face saying it wasn't him.

I really try my best not to be racist, but so far my impressions of being roommates with Indians is that they are not clean - because one of my roommates left the kitchen uncleaned for three days in a row, to the point where I had to tell him to clean it up. They do not want to do chores, they talk way too much and are constantly on the phone for the dumbest reasons. There have been times where I would be in the middle of a conversation with him, and would ALWAYS be interrupted because his phone is going off and the person on the other end asks a simple question that could've been sent through text.

Another thing I don't like, is when it comes to food - they expect you to try their food or drinks, but when you try to do the same in return, the reject everything. I just stop accepting their offers. It usually wasn't good anyways especially their teas - There was always something floating around. And I know how to make tea correctly from tea leaves because I was tea connoisseur before I joined the Navy. I made tea everyday from tea leaves that came from the middle east for a year straight.

These people also do not respect personal space and privacy. I even told my roommate that I don't like the fact that our apartment feels like a lounge and has a revolving door because of how constant these people are coming over. And then when he told his friends about me and him agreeing to having people coming over less, I overheard a conversation getting mad and saying something along the lines of ""I don't like that they are quantifying how many times we hangout.""

In the end of the day, it's my home and I live here. And if anyone who is reading this and are Indian, when you move to another country - do not expect others to conform to your traditions or 'how you do things back at home"". You're not at home, you are a guest in our country and you need to show respect. You being here in the US is a privilege, not a right. That same logic applies to anywhere you go. I have been to 17 countries and lived in 6 of them, and never once have I ever expect people to know how to speak English just because I do or because it's ""International Language"". Never once do I go to another disrespecting someone else's culture because I don't like how they are doing something.",1,1751401468.0,badroommates,2,0.56,False

I recently broke up my girlfriend after 5 months. I know it was a short relationship, but I felt so loved by her, Everything felt real. We always talked about a future with each other. Anyways let me get to the real point.

I recently had a change of duty station to Washington from South Korea (ARMY). We knew about this and in all honesty we didn’t care. The last few months arguments started to rise. It was 50/50 she started it. I explained my part . I kept being called “defensive and weak” we always made things up and hung out anyways. 

Earlier last month of June. I had a scheduled date with her. I seen she was active in all social medias. I texted her, called her nothing. After hours I spazzed out. She seen it and called me out for my impulsive behavior. In all honesty everybody I did make a silly mistake that day. Later we made things up. I promised her nothing but respect to her, we cried together. Everything felt fine. I went back to America. 

First week went real smooth no arguing, nothing but loved filled messages, calls etc. this is where it starts to get real. She went out to Seoul with some girlfriends. I asked her “where are you going off to baby”. She responds with “Omg why these questions, do you not trust me. I will show you”. I called her out and she lost it. I took accountability for jt despite me thinking otherwise I never wanted to argue with her. I tried to explain my question to her wasn’t in spite, it was to connect with her. That’s all. She never understood.

A few days later same things happened. She went out to a market bought a few things. I was talking to a friend she sent some photos I didn’t really pay attention to it. “She said going to get some coffee now” I replied with “nice baby. What did you get from second market” she absolutely lost it. She said “omg you Overreact. Do you not trust me” we argued I was frustrated with her. After a few comments she said this “I’m going to end things with you if you keep this up” again I was in complete shock. I thought about that message all day. 

I woke up the next morning and made a decision I didn’t want to make. I sent her the most respectful goodbye breakup message. To sum things up I said 
Some of the following. “I respect you, but I don’t think this will work long term. I wish nothing but the best for you and your well being moving forward. I’m going to focus on myself. She freaked out called me names like “Coward”, “Pussy”, “weak minded”. I tried to call her nothing. Right now she still has me followed on every platform imaginable. She’s posting quotes, reposting weird things on TikTok, etc. some days past, and I was
Filled with regret. I texted her a heartfelt message. She continued the coward, and pussy text. We talked things out. I fell down the hole more I imagine. I texted her saying I wanted to work things out. She replied “IDK” we talked some more and she told me “We need to build trust even when not texting we know we got eachother”. and I told her I would let her be and I would get back to her in a few days to check up on her. To check up on the mental side. She replied “okay baby”, that was 8 hours ago now. She sending me a TikToks to keep our streak going, but she is continuing to repost crazy things online as we speak. I know this was a lot to unfold, but Im clueless on what to do now?

We’ve recently begun wholesaling at a couple shops, from a tourist shop to some coffee shops, and I’d like to expand. 

We have at least 2 dozen coffee shops within 5 miles, probably more, besides some great convenience stores.

A friend of mine looking to connect with coffee shops said she DMd them on IG and had a great response; I started this way and connected with a few but am looking for something better. 

I considered just popping in and introducing myself but I know it can be annoying to be solicited during retail hours, so I think setting something  up for a quick 15 minute into and cookie sample drop off for a conversation may be better received!

I was wondering if anyone here owns any shops they may be willing to share how they prefer to be contacted.

However, I will be using a throwaway account because my main might make me identifiable, and call me a coward, but I don't want that just yet.  
  
Another bit of context, I am a first generation immigrant from a developing country so this might be some sort of cultural difference or me coming from poverty makes me see things differently or something, I don't know.  
  
I started working at KPMG a few months ago, I was so so proud of myself for landing a job at a Big4.  
I anticipated people being uptight and culturally different from me but what I've been experiencing disgusts me to my core.  
  
First and foremost, I share an office with another lady. She has always been nice to me I suppose, although we don't talk much, but from the first day I noticed that she goes upstairs to the cafeteria, brings herself food, eats like four bites of it by her table and then just leaves her leftovers there.  
After a few hours it starts to stink, but it doesn't seem to bother her.  
  
After I was there for a few weeks, I actually timed out bringing my own water and coffee around the same time as she eats her food. When I went to take my dishes to the kitchen, I politely asked if she wants me to take her dishes as well.  
I figured there should be no harm in this, I didn't say out loud what I was actually thinking, which is ""you stink up the whole room and too lazy to take your own shit to the kitchen, let me help you"", I figured she would even take a hint, let me take her stuff this time and would take it herself next time.  
Instead, she said ""we don't have to do that, the cleaning staff does it"".  
So this lady was ready to sit for another 5 hours with her smelly leftovers sitting there and going bad by the minute just because she doesn't HAVE TO take it outside, someone will eventually do it for her..  
It's also hot as hell, sure the AC works but it still doesn't help that much and the office is tiny so I have to work in her stink all day everyday.  
  
Then I started to look.  
Half of the people are doing this.  
They make themself a tea, drink three sips and leave it there. Make a coffee, do the same.  
By five o'clock they are sitting with 3 plates and 2 mugs still containing food and drinks, stinking up the place, then leave everything there as it is, being wasteful as hell. The amount of food/drinks these people just take two sips/bites from and leave there to spoil is astonishing, not to mention the smell.  
I befriended a girl from IT during our smoke breaks she is also a foreigner and she has the same shit going on in her floor, she is baffled by it too.  
  
Then there are the toilets.  
I've seen cleaner toilets in gas stations by the freeway than the way they start to look around 2 o'clock.  
People are just constantly ripping ass and leaving the toilets completely covered in shit stains, feminine products on the floor, blood on the toilet, the works.  
I've worked in quite a few offices and I've never seen anything like this.   
You would think that people working in a company like this have some sort of class and decorum, but no.   
It's so unhygienic sometimes that I try to take care of my business in the morning when it's still clean and just hold my pee after a certain hour when I know that the toilets have been stained already.

And don't even get me started on the table manners of some people at the cafeteria, how much food and dirt they leave everywhere.   
For context, I used to be a server while I was doing my studies and I regularly served big groups with a bunch of kids and even they managed to eat in a much more well behaved way and they didn't even left the courter of a mess these grown adult do every day.  
I'm not even gonna go on another tangent on how much food they throw away daily because it makes me sick.  


Again, I have a very different culture, but because we have so little, we appreciate it and try our best to not be wasteful.  
You're not really hungry?  
Don't take a second plate then, if you're just going to take two bites and throw it away.  
You work in a nice office that gets cleaned everyday by cleaning personnel?  
That's amazing, but try to preserve cleanliness as much as you can.  
Not only to be respectful to the person cleaning there, but because you don't want to sit in a dirty office in the remaining of the day.  
You eat a smelly bowl of tuna and eggs with a colleague in the room?  
Be respectful and not leave your stinky leftovers there.  
  
However, people here seem like they are just above it.  
Like it would be offensive to them to throw away their own leftovers or something.  
  
I could do a whole separate post about the job itself, how underutilized I feel, how much I feel like I've learnt shit so far, how I would be entitled to take homeoffice days but if I do that, there comes the emotional blackmail that I am not sitting in the office with my stinky colleague.  
  
Everyone in my family says I am overreacting and that I should stay at least a year but I feel unmotivated and also disgusted by the whole work environment and the culture here.  
  
Please guys, tell me if I am the issue.  
  
I recognize the fact that my upbringing affects my view on this, and having seen actual poverty and hunger made me more sensitive to waistfulness, having worked in gastronomy in my teens and early twenties made me more sensitive to leaving a mess for other people to clean, but whats going on in this office is really a whole new level of nasty.  
  
Or is this the norm in other offices as well?  
Please help me with a different perspective because I really started to resent these people on a personal level for acting like this.  
  
I do have to make a small disclaimer at the end, obviously not EVERYONE is like this but the majority is, and not only that but it's so normalized too like noone bats an eye. I am going crazy because this is not how I was raised and I've been living in this country for a while now and had other jobs here and this is not what I've experienced so far at other places.",6,1751401169.0,KPMG,13,0.72,False

I live in a small house. I don't have space for a dining table that seats more than two people. This isn't a problem unless I have guests.

Last year I bought a fancy coffee table that folds out to a full table. It's also good for sewing projects. I don't love the way it looks. It also has several drawers and little stools that I haven't used (I thought I would use them more when I bought the table).

I also have an old, heavy, wooden coffee table that I love. It's more of the aesthetic that I want. At the moment, I'm using it as a TV stand. But my childhood piano will be delivered to me in 10 days and the TV will have to go on top of the piano.

Junk removers are coming next week and one of those coffee tables has to go. Do I keep the one-use coffee table that is beautiful and I love it or do I keep the multi-use coffee table?

Which would you keep?
