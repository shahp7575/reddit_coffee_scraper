Spending 8+ hours at a desk each day does strange things to your body, but the part I‚Äôve realized I‚Äôve neglected most‚Ä¶ my feet. Sitting (and honestly, cramped office shoes) left me with tight, achy arches and toes that felt more ‚Äúsquished together‚Äù than they should.  

Recently, I started experimenting with a short, consistent daily routine using toe separators, along with a few basic stretches and more barefoot-friendly shoes. The changes snuck up on me‚Äîless foot pain by mid-afternoon, better balance when I walk, and a surprising boost in energy just by fixing the foundation of‚Ä¶ well, me.  

Here‚Äôs what‚Äôs working for me:  

- **2 minutes**: Slip on the **[Toe Alignment Comfort Corrector‚Ñ¢](https://shopvibemart.com/products/toe-alignment-comfort-corrector%E2%84%A2)** while I type emails. Think of it like spreading out your fingers after holding a fist too long. It gently teaches your toes their ‚Äúreal‚Äù spacing.  
- **3 minutes**: Basic calf stretch at the wall‚Äîbecause tight calves = hunched posture and foot pain.  
- **2 minutes**: Seated toe lifts. Try lifting just the big toes while leaving the smaller ones down, then switch. It‚Äôs hilariously harder than it sounds.  
- **3 minutes**: Barefoot standing time with the **[Toe Alignment Comfort Corrector‚Ñ¢](https://shopvibemart.com/products/toe-alignment-comfort-corrector%E2%84%A2)** in. Usually while refilling coffee, just to remind my feet they‚Äôre not only for sitting.  

What I‚Äôve noticed since sticking with this:  

- Less stiffness when I finally stand up after long focus sessions.  
- My ‚Äúend of workday‚Äù fatigue is way lower.  
- Shoes feel more forgiving‚Äîeven dress shoes I hated before.  
- Walking outside now feels more springy (almost like my foot muscles woke back up after years of napping).  

I‚Äôm now kind of obsessed with the idea that desk-job culture has trained us to ignore the most *literal foundation of our health*. Imagine if we treated our feet with the same care as eye health or back posture?  

Curious to hear from others: has anyone else tried integrating small ‚Äúfoot freedom‚Äù habits into their workday? Do you think foot issues are one of those *silent contributors* to bigger aches (like knees, hips, even headaches)?  

One thing I realized‚Äîwhen I‚Äôm using the **[Toe Alignment Comfort Corrector‚Ñ¢](https://shopvibemart.com/products/toe-alignment-comfort-corrector%E2%84%A2)** consistently, even just 10 minutes a day, it‚Äôs not about instant magic. It‚Äôs about small alignment tweaks that add up slowly but deeply.  

For anyone chained to their desk like me, I recommend playing around with this mini-routine as a break ritual. It‚Äôs low-effort, discreet, doesn‚Äôt require switching into gym clothes, and really does shift the whole workday vibe.  

Feet carry us literally everywhere, but they rarely get thanks or attention. Maybe it‚Äôs time our ‚Äúoffice wellness‚Äù checklists moved beyond stretching shoulders and drinking water. And hey‚Äî10 minutes with the **[Toe Alignment Comfort Corrector‚Ñ¢](https://shopvibemart.com/products/toe-alignment-comfort-corrector%E2%84%A2)** is one of the easier habits I‚Äôve formed all year.  

---  

What do you all think‚Äîare toe separators just another wellness trend, or could this be one of those underestimated fixes with ripple effects everywhere else in the body? Would love to hear experiments and routines others are trying.",1,1757584827.0,pinteresttrends,0,1.0,False

We have been thinking a lot about how to make USDC more useful in everyday life, not just something you hold in a wallet.

That is why we recently updated our app with a Gift Card Shop. Now you can redeem USDC directly for coffee, shopping, food delivery, travel, gaming and more. Starbucks, Amazon, Walmart, Roblox, Nintendo, these are all places people already spend money at, and now you can do it with USDC in just a few taps.

No card, no bank, no extra steps. We hope this feature makes it easier for people to spend USDC in daily life.

1ne4ok7,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1ne4ok7/girlfriend_24f_and_i_26f_broke_up_after_i_bought/,"Girlfriend (24F) and I (26F) broke up after I bought a house, but maybe for good reason","(I‚Äôm sorry this is so long. Please be gentle, I know I‚Äôm an idiot) I‚Äôm not sure what to do next, and I lay beside her as I‚Äôm typing this. We shared the bed again tonight, maybe for the last time, it seems like we both can‚Äôt stand this‚Ä¶

Basically it all began in June 2024. Her (24F) and I (26F) have a beautiful relationship but began tumultuously. I was with someone I didn‚Äôt love, she just got out of a horrible toxic relationship. We fell in love truly and genuinely, and I don‚Äôt doubt that. But it seems to be a right person wrong time situation. The first six months are of course wonderful. We do everything together, become best friends, have amazing passionate intimacy where I feel truly wanted. She is so beautiful and I have always felt extremely passionate for her, but she is more of an independent person who is very passive and tends to be very indecisive, depressed, etc. 

I‚Äôm not in the business of fixing my partners, I‚Äôve tried it before and of course I‚Äôm the one who gets hurt. But I also have problems of my own, of course. I‚Äôm too clingy, I have a bad relationship with sex (judging my worth and relationship based on it), and I need to learn how to be self-secure enough in my relationships not to let my OCD obsess over finite details. 

This time last year, I wanted to buy a house (for myself) in the town we live in. She tells me to hold off: because she wants to go to New York. So I‚Äôm like, bet. I GET A JOB IN NEW YORK. I‚Äôm ready to go and do what she wants to do. She changes her mind in January, says she thinks we are moving really fast and she never had time to be single in between her relationships and figure her shit out.

I suggested taking a break, but then she‚Äôs back on my doorstep twelve hours later crying about how she missed me. She brought these issues up not out of malice, but out of genuine love and concern for our relationship because she really does ‚Äúwant it to work out between us.‚Äù 

Two weeks later she suggests buying the house, the dream I always wanted, to start a homestead. I‚Äôm elated, but I am a fool. She says she was just ‚Äúin a depressive episode‚Äù (she‚Äôs diagnosed bipolar) and changed her mind because she just got freaked out about everything moving so fast with the New York dream. 

I put my faith in whatever divine force is out there. I say ‚Äúlead me on the right path‚Äù and I trust it completely, I just never consider her NOT apart of that path, you know? I know in my gut too she will still be apart of my life always.

So I straight up buy a house on my own (I‚Äôm the only one on the deed) for us to live in. At 26, an insane accomplishment that I did for us. She‚Äôs contributing rent and utilities of course, and this is what I wanted before, she just basically gave me the go-ahead to do it. 

We moved in June, got all settled and have created the most adorable house. Our cats love each other and we‚Äôve been working so hard on improvements to really flip the old house we bought. It seemed literally feverish how great my life was going from like March-July. August we celebrated our one year (yeah we did the classic lesbian uhaul and it never ends well, I know). A few weeks ago I just started feeling some distance between us. No matter, we‚Äôve been there before. I lean into it, I take her on dates, pick flowers for her, we have movie nights and spontaneous adventures. We are intimate again more often (it had been falling off a lot since that first fight in January) and it genuinely has been the best three weeks‚Ä¶ aside from my absolutely insane intrusive thoughts popping in and literally making me the most anxious person I‚Äôve ever been. Everything is perfect, but my gut knows it‚Äôs changed. 

It started off small, she didn‚Äôt text me as much, she doesn‚Äôt initiate intimacy (though she‚Äôs always been really passive in that) and she doesn‚Äôt do things she used to‚Ä¶ buy me coffee, cook me breakfast, send me pictures of herself. I know she‚Äôs been super depressed, and I am a huge physical touch person, her much less. Doesn‚Äôt mean it doesn‚Äôt happen, we touch everyday. We cuddle, we kiss, we laugh and we aren‚Äôt outright fighting, but most importantly we are each others best friend. I know she loves me, and I‚Äôve never doubted that. But I wanted to feel WANTED, you know what I mean? 

So I smoke a little too much last night. I start having a panic attack, I go in there for comfort and I just let it absolutely rip. 

I tell her that I KNOW in my gut that she lies to me when she says she‚Äôs happy here. She always says ‚Äúyes‚Äù but there‚Äôs this change, a look on her face or the way she says it. I don‚Äôt no but I DO KNOW there‚Äôs something she‚Äôs not telling me. 

I tell her I only want her to be happy. I want her to be happy with me, but I‚Äôm not going to force her to stay. She has to choose and figure her shit out, both how to open and honestly communicate with people (her main issue I would say in the relationship) and figure out what the fuck she wants in life (she wants a homestead, but she really wants to check out New  York because she has this 90s rose colored glasses about it from watching Gossip Girl and Sex in the City). 

I tell her go, check out New York. Live the dream she wants to live. ‚ÄúYou must love in such a way that the other person feels free‚Äù and ‚Äúif you love some thing let it go, it may come back and be yours‚Äù type shit. No matter what happened before, nothing will make me not feel proud of the growth I‚Äôve made in this relationship. I finally know how it feels to love someone to the point I‚Äôd rather them be happy than be unhappy with me, even if it hurts. 

She can figure out from there what she truly wants. She can be single and figure out her issues with intimacy and communication. I say I love her so much I cannot let her live with me if I know she is not truly happy, if there‚Äôs always gonna be that side of her that regrets not checking it out. 

She jokes with me, her ex boyfriend never allowed her to break up with him so why can‚Äôt I ‚Äújust be toxic‚Äù because I know she doesn‚Äôt WANT to break up. Neither of us do. But maybe it‚Äôs a NEED at this point, at least to see if we truly want to be together. I know I want to be with her, flaws and all, but I cannot keep suffocating the people I love out of fear of them slipping away. I cannot force her to want to stay with me. I shouldn‚Äôt have to do that, I deserve more than that. And she doesn‚Äôt deserve living someone else‚Äôs dream, even if she was the one who initiated it (I don‚Äôt regret buying the house, I can afford it on my own, but it‚Äôs a big house for one person, I‚Äôll probably get a dog or something) 

I just don‚Äôt know what to do now. We work at the same job and she seems to love her job, she just got a major promotion that is gonna set her up for life if she stays. I think she‚Äôs going to stay here until she finds an apartment in town to live. We held each other all night and cried, she says ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not going anywhere, I will always be right here. I want no one else but you, but I need to love myself first.‚Äù We both say what is meant to be will be, I tell her I‚Äôm not going to wait for her, of course, but there will always be an open door for her to come back into my life. But I‚Äôm going to be single for awhile, and she said she will too. We both need to work on ourselves alone. 

I am so broken. I am so numb. I know she loves me, she‚Äôs been holding me tighter than ever before tonight. 

I don‚Äôt know what to do, and I don‚Äôt post to Reddit often. Please be kind, I‚Äôm too hard on myself already. 

TLDR: I bought a house for my wishy washy girlfriend. We are so in love, but I know she‚Äôs not happy. I confronted her, I love her too much not to set her free to live the life she truly wants, possibly in New York, even if she just checks it out to see if maybe she DOESN‚ÄôT WANT. Love in a way that makes them feel free, if they come back it was always meant to be. ",1,1757584611.0,relationship_advice,0,1.0,False

1ne4n7n,https://www.reddit.com/r/OnlyInDubai/comments/1ne4n7n/dating_in_dubai_my_view/,Dating in Dubai (my view),"Dubai is a beautiful city. 
A hub of modernity, ambition and tons of skyscrapers, but has a seriously complex dating scene!

Well, here is my (male) take on this subject..
You know how diverse Dubai is and the nationalities that you would find right? Each have a different criteria for accessibility.

Lets get to it..

Here are the type of responses that we guys often get..
1. We get ghosted often after initial matches on dating apps, initial messages or even a few dates.
2. Requests for expensive gifts from the get go - coffee, then moves to money then OH MY GOD gold and phones and you become Aladin's magic lamp!
3. This is my personal favourite - ""Hi, what are you looking for?""
4. Strong interest but low follow-through. Many people start to flirt and fade before plans become concrete which is just a pain in the wrong place.


Now let us get to talking about nationalities in general, but I will be giving a bit of focus on women from the Philippines (Please don't hate me).

Lets take it from the top and start with nationalities by groups.

1. Western Women (Europe, UK, USA, Canada, Australia)
They tend to be more liberal and social, therefore ""easier"" to approach, or perhaps more responsive to casual chats and encounters. Although any approach that may seem transactional may be outright dismissed or even ignored.

2. Eastern European Women and Slavic
You would often find them in nightlife scenes like clubs, bars and dating apps. Although they are out there and often open to going out, majority of who are out there date for ""interest only"", which may include financial benifits, status or lifesyle gains.

3. Asian women
They make the majority of Dubai's expat female population. You may find that some move within more conservative and social circles. However, lets break them down into 3 groups:
- Indians: Would rather date within their nationality. Fun, happy and chill to some extent.
- Pakistani: Also mainly date only within their circle.
- Filipinas (Pinays): The easiest to date, humble, fun, loyal and can actually be ""crazy"" at times but sometimes can be the rudest type of women out there. Although they also date within their circle, yet in Dubai it is not often the case and depends on the location they live in. Women living in old Dubai (Deira and Bur Dubai up to Karama and Satwa) often date Indian, Pakistani and Egyptian men. New Dubai women (the fancy parts of Dubai) often tend to date Arabs in general especially if they are loaded with cash and have a car.

Dating in general and why it feels hard at times..

1. Living in Dubai and the access to a lot of leisure has quite changed the dating scene. Dubai's LUXE culture encourages ""big gestures"" and therefore sets the expectations for flashy dinners, designer gifts, nightlife and some other weird expectations. This makes some men feel a lot of pressure in relationships based on these transactional dynamics.

2. Expats and diversity: Many in Dubai are here for a short-term, whether it was for work, money or just the lifestyle. This makes a longterm commitment a bit tricky.

3. Culture and Religion
That is a complicated topic and you will definitely need to approach with care. Cultural differences usually cause confusion and misunderstandings when you are dating someone of a different nationality and therefore you will either need to adapt, or do your research beforehand to know what you are getting into.

4. Apps and Scams (the worst)
Dating apps are filled with fake profiles, bots, and people looking for quick gains (financial or otherwise). Genuine connections are OFTEN buried under the noise. This causes a lot of trust issues and messes up chances for people who are seeking genuine connections. 
Advice..if you feel you have trust issues, delete your dating profile and look for people in real life.

Another thing worth mentioning is escort services! It is not easy talking to a woman in Dubai, but then when they smile at you or become friendly you start to think twice because she might be an escort. You ask yourself, ""Is she really interested or is she an escort and will I have to be paying an arm and a leg for this interaction?!""

Yet again, I do blame us men for some of it. Some men driven by their s3xual desires often tell any ""female"" that she looks beautiful, pretty or gorgeous only to get into her pants (even if she looked like The Grinch). This sets the bar too high even for someone looking for a simple chat and friendship as now women ""think"" that Cleopatra was their grandma and they probably got their so claimed beauty from there.
Although beauty is subjective, but it definitey is a pain to deal with women setting standards beyond what they can offer.


With all that being said, there are PLENTY of amazing ladies out there and a pool of very smart ones too.

1ne4it4,https://i.redd.it/za3bevoi8iof1.png,Around 15-16kg down from Feb/March 2025 to 11th September 2025 (Today),"My weight loss has been relativley slow, but I wouldn't have it any other way, I am trying to ""recomp"" by building/maintaining as much muscle as I can whilst losing weight. For context I previously had been lifting weights for a few years prior to my weight gain, but stopped hence the weight gain. I started taking Mounjaro around Feb or March, I actually can't remember exactly when as I downloaded the shotsy app quite late, but I only really started taking it seriously around towards the end of May which is where most of my weight loss has come from.

  
My weight loss has generally been slow at what I average out as 500gm per week but I am happy with it as I am making long term changes and reversion to the mean and I am not is a significant rush. I want to regain some of the muscle I lost after a period of depression and neglect of my body. I used to be around 100kg back in 2017 for context and was working out lifting weights regularly and about 10kg away from my goal at the time. Depression hit, gained all the kg's and it stayed for a while. At this stage I feel like my goal weight sits at around the 90-95kg range, I do want to get back in certain sports I used to play when I was younger and it helps being lighter so we'll see. I am 185cm for context.

I made some significant lifestyle changes over the last few months including, starting antidepressants, quitting alcohol for good (around 50 days no alcohol - and feel SO much better). I honestly can't describe how much better I feel stopping alcohol, it's made me realise how poisonous it is even in small quantities.

Do you remember when you were a kid, it was the weekend and your parents said you couldn't play videogames as it was too late but you could play in the morning? Then you bounced out of bed as if you'd just inhaled three coffees? Yeah, I have that kind of energy (almost) again, I thought I was jsut ""getting old"" and would feel slow and tired for good whilst I am only in my early 30's.

I also earlier in the year around Jan was diagnosed with Obstructive Sleep Apnoea and hypertension. This was the trigger that got my act together. I was on CPAP and after not tolerating it stopped using it around 2-3 months ago. I noticed I wasn't snoring, no headache and not tired, so I got another sleep study a few weeks ago - no more sleep apnoea. My blood pressure is around 125/80, I could probably come of my last BP medication but I'm doing that slowly (was on two).

I had been inspired by so many posters on this sub and the other main Tirzepatide/Mounjnaro/Zep subs I thought I'd share and hope at least 1 person looks as it and maybe sees something out of my situation they can use as fuel to make change.

I also wanted to prove it is possible to put on muscle/maintain whilst using this drug, I think it's all about the rate of the weight loss more than anything AND making sure you are hitting your protein goals. It's hard but I aim 200g every day, with the aid of protein shakes.

1ne4g3g,https://www.reddit.com/r/BeautyShine/comments/1ne4g3g/should_you_trust_fovcos_cc_cream_for_flawless/,Should You Trust Fovcos CC Cream for Flawless Skin Results,"Using the Fovcos Color Correcting CC Cream has been an interesting and enlightening experience. With its promise of being both a makeup and skincare hybrid, this product intrigued me from the outset. Fovcos is clearly targeting those who need a multi-use product that simplifies routines while still delivering effective results. From SPF protection to hydration, the features seemed almost too good to pass up. Having tested it daily for a couple of weeks, I was able to get an in-depth understanding of how it performs and where it may fall short.

**Appearance and Texture**  
The first thing I noticed about this CC cream is the lightweight and refreshing texture. As someone who dislikes heavy or cakey bases, this formula felt absolutely perfect. It starts as a white lotion with a faint, soothing plant fragrance and transforms into a tone that blends well with your natural skin color. I wouldn't call it completely weightless, but it gets remarkably close. One major relief was how non-greasy it felt throughout the day, and I appreciate how it doesn't settle into fine lines or creases. The dewy finish gave me a healthy glow, perfect for a natural makeup look.

**Application and Ease of Use**  
I really appreciated how simple it is to use, especially for those rushed mornings. You simply apply a thin layer with your fingers after basic skincare. It adjusts to your skin tone as it warms, which means no fretting over whether you've chosen the wrong shade. I tested it on both regular workdays and casual weekends, making it a versatile addition to my routine. Truthfully, even my brother was amused by how easy it seemed ‚Äî he jokingly attempted to try it himself after hearing me rave about it!  

**Moisturizing and Skin Benefits**  
Being someone who deals with dryness around my cheeks, I found the hydrating aspect of this CC cream to be one of its strongest benefits. My skin always felt comfortable and smooth while wearing it. It's nice to know it doubles as a moisturizer and keeps the skin nourished throughout the day. The enhanced radiance my skin gained while using this product has been a pleasant surprise, and I even noticed fewer flaky patches with consecutive days of use.

[See Fovcos Color Correcting CC Cream deals on Amazon now.](https://paulahansen.com/p/b0cg67918y/)

**Coverage and Performance**  
Its concealing power genuinely impressed me. Acne scars, redness, and blemishes were significantly toned down after application, although it's worth mentioning that it doesn‚Äôt completely mask intense discoloration. It offers medium coverage, making for a more natural finish rather than a heavily made-up look. The SPF 25 protection is a godsend for someone like me who typically forgets the sunscreen step. All-together, the cream saves time on extensive layering, which is golden during my busy weekdays.

**Long-Lasting Effects**  
The waterproof and sweatproof claims hold up to scrutiny. Summer heat, gym sessions, or even stepping out for a quick coffee run in humid weather barely make it budge, which was reassuring. By the end of the day, my base somehow looked just as fresh as it did in the morning. However, I would recommend a good makeup remover; its staying power means you need that extra step to clean it thoroughly without tugging at your skin.

**Plus Points**  
- Lightweight albeit effective coverage for a radiant look  
- Easily adjustable to most skin tones  
- Moisturizes while providing skin benefits  
- Long-lasting, sweatproof formulation  
- Time-saving product for makeup minimalists  

**Potential Areas of Concern**  
- SPF 25 might not be sufficient for extended sun exposure  
- May not suit extremely sensitive skin types after prolonged use  
- Limited shade options restrict its adaptability for all complexions  
- Medium coverage falls short for those seeking complete concealment  

**Competitive Options**  
Compared to other hybrid base products, such as IT Cosmetics CC Cream or the Est√©e Lauder Double Wear line, what makes this product stand out is the lightweight feel and simplicity. While brands like IT Cosmetics offer a broader SPF range and more comprehensive skincare benefits, they might feel heavier during wear. On the other hand, the Est√©e Lauder option provides fuller coverage but isn't as beginner-friendly. For someone new to CC creams or looking for something with an uncomplicated application process, Fovcos holds its own strong position in this lineup.

**Price to Quality Ratio**  
Considering how many steps this cream saves in a daily routine, it‚Äôs undeniably a worthwhile investment. You're essentially getting a primer, foundation, and sunscreen in one, not to mention its skin-nourishing benefits. Though other CC creams might offer a tad more coverage or fancier packaging, they often cost more, making this product favorable for budget-conscious shoppers like myself.

Hi, I need help. I am at my wits end and it is really effecting my mental health. 

Had gastric sleeve 3 years ago. Lost 50kg, got down to 100kg I felt so happy and comfortable and I could do alot more. 

The last 12 months have not been so good. I have continued to have restrictions and my diet is mostly ok, I had 2 really bad weeks cause I had a miscarriage and didnt care about what I ate. But overall it's good. I stepped on the scales today and it is 113kg, no matter what I do I cannot loose more weight or even stay at 100kg. This is soul destroying, I cant even look in the mirror cause I hate what I see, my clothes are tight, I feel guilt and upset everything I eat cause I know it will cause me to gain something 

A normal day for me is as follows 
Steps - between 10k and 16k (i work in acute hospital)
Breakfast - coffee, sweetener and skyr yogurt with chia seeds.
Lunch - Coffee, sugar (sometimes), two boiled eggs and sometimes a slice of toast with real butter. 
Tea - cup of tea, two belvita 
Dinner - some sort of meat and I very rarely have veg or potatoes 
I do snack on chocolate and nuts but nothing crazy 

I have followed lots of people and tried their meal plans, I gained on one or two of them. I cannot afford GLP-1 injections. 

I have to go through my wardrobe today and find clothes that fit me and it is going to be so upsetting. I was finally happy with myself and now I hate myself again.

1ne4cb7,https://www.reddit.com/r/sexlessmarriage/comments/1ne4cb7/how_can_i_save_this_marriage/,How can I save this marriage?,"My (41M) wife (38F) are on such different wavelengths I fear it might be over. In the last 6 months the we've had sex maybe 3 times and not at all in the last 2 1/2 months. 

 Everyday she comes home and I listen to her tell me all her work drama which im more than happy to because I like that she vents to me and talks with me. When she is finished I start to tell her about my day and she will just give me a minute or 2 and then starts moving around and doing all the stuff she needs to do for her and the kids, which i get but when I try to help her so we can continue conversation she just kind of changes the subject or gives me an ""uh-huh"" and I get deflated and give up and she just stops talking to me unless its about kids or something involving the household.

Ive say with her and talked to her and expressed my feelings about how we sleep on opposite sides of the bed and I have to reach all the way to her just to touch her or kiss her or hold her and she never even comes near me anymore. Ive expressed how im unhappy and she just says sorry and moves on. Ive suggested therapy or talking more or literally anything she'd be open too and I gey shut down and told she doesn't want to do any of it at all.

After relaying my feelings to her and telling her how unhappy I am she has half heartedly started giving me a peck here and there and will kind of move to q and me when we go to bed if I really asked her to but you can tell she doesn't want to at all.

I guess the biggest one was our 15th wedding anniversary she didn't even say happy anniversary to me. Meanwhile the night before I brought home flowers and a card and left them in her car so when she went to work in the morning she could see them and thats when she came back in the house and still didn't say it, just said thanks gave me a peck and left. Thay weekend I had lined up my mother to watch the kids so we could do something whether it was dinner or a movie or anything really and she just said no she doesn't feel like  doing anything because she's tired. Ok I guess but I wasn't really asking g much I mean we could've just got coffee or spent an hour chilling together I would've been happy. No gift, no card and only when I said happy anniversary did she reciprocate the sentiment, meanwhile 2 weeks later was her work friends birthday and she got her cards, small gifts and wrapped and bagged them, and decorated her desk at work. I felt really hurt and when I said as much i just go another, ""sorry"".

My father died earlier this year and it has absolutely broken me and still does and I feel like after the initial week or two of his passing she just kind of gave up on being there for me. Once in a while if she sees im really struggling she might step in and see if im ok but at that point I feel like it's only because everyone can see im struggling and she is doing it because she has too or so others won't say something to her. 

I know life gets in the way alot and kids and work can really pile on but I feel like she has checked out and we are roommates more than anything. 

I feel like giving up sometimes but I still love her and dont want to break up my family but I also dont wanna keep going like this and she is unwilling to change or try something different. 

What do I do?  What would you do?  Is this marriage over?  Just feeling lost. Thanks for letting me vent. ",3,1757583288.0,sexlessmarriage,2,1.0,False

Had gastric sleeve 3 years ago. Lost 50kg, got down to 100kg I felt so happy and comfortable and I could do alot more. 

The last 12 months have not been so good. I have continued to have restrictions and my diet is mostly ok, I had 2 really bad weeks cause I had a miscarriage and didnt care about what I ate. But overall it's good. I stepped on the scales today and it is 113kg, no matter what I do I cannot loose more weight or even stay at 100kg. This is soul destroying, I cant even look in the mirror cause I hate what I see, my clothes are tight, I feel guilt and upset everything I eat cause I know it will cause me to gain something 

A normal day for me is as follows 
Steps - between 10k and 16k (i work in acute hospital)
Breakfast - coffee, sweetener and skyr yogurt with chia seeds.
Lunch - Coffee, sugar (sometimes), two boiled eggs and sometimes a slice of toast with real butter. 
Tea - cup of tea, two belvita 
Dinner - some sort of meat and I very rarely have veg or potatoes 
I do snack on chocolate and nuts but nothing crazy 

I have followed lots of people and tried their meal plans, I gained on one or two of them. I cannot afford GLP-1 injections. 

I have to go through my wardrobe today and find clothes that fit me and it is going to be so upsetting. I was finally happy with myself and now I hate myself again.

We had a fight over the phone, and there was a coldness in his voice that still reverberates in my ears, I can't tolerate your insecurity and clinginess anymore.I woke up the next morning as if someone had snatched my whole world away. Blocked me from everywhere. WhatsApp, Insta, even deleted the shared playlist on Spotify, which had so many of our memories. It felt as if I was never in his life, as if I was a ghost that he had pushed away. The first month was just a series of mistakes. I would type a message in the middle of the night, send it, and then delete it the very next moment, like a stupid child would do. I would stand outside his office for hours, hoping that maybe he would come out and talk to me. I would message his friends, asking them for updates about him, and then later I would curse myself for how I had stooped so low. The more I ran after him, the more he went away from me, as if I was a curse.

 The worst was the day I saw him laughing with another girl at a party. My heart dropped. I went to the washroom and was panting while crying, as if I was out of breath. My hands were shaking, and all I could think was, Maybe he will never be mine, maybe I will never be enough for anyone."" Coming home that night, I decided that I will either pull myself out of this pain, or I will be drowned in this darkness forever. Life after that was not easy, not at all. I took therapy. For the first time I told the therapist, Yes, I am jealous. Yes, I am afraid that he will leave me. And that fear eventually came true.
I joined the gym. On the first day, I could not run on the treadmill for even five minutes, but I kept going every day., so that I could sweat out the anger and pain, as if I was turning my weakness into strength. I called old friends, whom I had not spoken to in years, and tried to find myself again.  And yes, I also took up rock climbin because I had to prove to myself over and over again that I could fall, get badly broken, and still get back up as life would test me by making me fall again and again.

For 5 months, I had no contact with him. No texts, no stalking, no nothing. It wasn‚Äôt easy, not at all. I typed his name into my phone at 3 am, then forced myself to stop, like I was battling an addiction. I even installed an app so I wouldn‚Äôt drunkenly text him, like my very existence was at stake. 7 months later, his first text came Hey, how are you? My heart started pounding, like it was going to burst out of my chest, but I didn‚Äôt reply right away, as if to prove myself. The next day I casually texted, ‚ÄúAre you okay?‚Äù and from there, we started talking casually, like two strangers meeting again.

 When he called me for coffee for the first time, there was a clear surprise in his eyes, as if he could not recognize me. As if he was thinking, ""Is this the same girl who used to cry all the time? How did she become so calm?The truth was that I was the same only now I had learnt to live for myself, as if I had taken the reins of my life in my own hands.

Slowly we started meeting again. And yes, I dated someone else in the meantime, as if I had freed myself. The difference was that this time I was not desperate, nor dependent on anyone. When he said two weeks ago, ""Can we try again?"" my answer was yes, but that yes was not out of fear, but of my own free will, as if I had taken my own decision. Now we are together again, moving forward slowly, like two strangers finding a new path. But jealousy no longer controls me, as if I have overcome my demons.  Because this time I have worked on myself, learned to love myself. He sees it too, and appreciates it, as if he has realized my true worth. But to be honest? My real victory was not that he came back. My real victory was that I came backto myself, to my existence, to my strength.",4,1757582798.0,heartbreak,2,1.0,False
1ne47py,https://www.reddit.com/r/MadTheories/comments/1ne47py/how_did_kelly_clarkson_lose_weight/,How Did Kelly Clarkson Lose Weight?,"
Hey everyone, have you ever wondered *how did Kelly Clarkson lose weight* and completely transform her life? It's such an inspiring story that shows anyone can make real changes with the right mindset and steps. I'm not here to push any agenda, but as someone who's been on my own journey with health and wellness, I think Kelly's experience is a total game-changer. Let's dive into it together, like we're chatting over coffee, and I'll share what I've learned from her public journey. It's all about staying motivated and making sustainable choices that stick.

# The Journey That Sparked Change

You know, *how did Kelly Clarkson lose weight* has been a hot topic lately, and it's no surprise‚Äîher before-and-after is seriously motivating. From what I've followed, Kelly didn't rely on quick fixes or crash diets. Instead, she focused on a holistic approach that included tweaking her daily habits. Think about it: she opened up about incorporating more movement into her routine, like walking and light workouts that fit her busy schedule as a mom and performer. It's not about hitting the gym for hours; it's the small, consistent steps that add up. I remember reading how she emphasized enjoying life while making healthier swaps, such as choosing whole foods over processed ones. **This real-talk approach** reminds us that weight loss isn't just physical‚Äîit's emotional too.

What really stands out is how Kelly talked about her mental shift. She shared that getting in tune with her body and prioritizing self-care played a huge role. For instance, she cut back on stress by finding joy in activities she loved, which naturally helped with *how did Kelly Clarkson lose weight* in a balanced way. It's inspiring because it shows that transformation comes from within. If you're like me, you've probably tried a few things that didn't stick, but hearing stories like hers makes you think, ""Hey, I can do this too."" Let's not forget, she didn't do it overnight; it was a gradual process that built her confidence.

# Key Habits That Made a Difference

Now, let's break down some of the habits that contributed to *how did Kelly Clarkson lose weight*. First off, she amped up her nutrition game by focusing on balanced meals with plenty of veggies, lean proteins, and healthy fats. **Bullet points for clarity:**
- *Incorporating more fruits and greens* into every meal to keep energy levels high.
- Swapping sugary snacks for nutrient-dense options that satisfy cravings without the guilt.
- Staying hydrated and listening to her body's hunger signals, which helped avoid overeating.

Exercise was another big piece, but it wasn't about extreme routines. Kelly mixed in fun activities like dancing or hiking, making it feel less like a chore. **This is key** because when you enjoy what you're doing, it's easier to stick with it long-term. I love how she kept it real by saying it's okay to have off days‚Äîit's all about getting back on track without beating yourself up.

And here's where things get interesting: many folks, including Kelly, have turned to natural aids to support their efforts. She hinted at using things like herbal blends or everyday supplements to help with energy and focus. If you're curious about exploring something similar, I've heard great things from friends in online groups about a *natural supplement* that could complement a healthy lifestyle‚Äîjust check it out if it fits your routine. [natural supplement](http://a0010.jessicakid.com). It's all about finding what works for you, without overcomplicating things.

# Why This Story Inspires Us All

Thinking about *how did Kelly Clarkson lose weight*, it's not just about the pounds shed; it's the empowerment that comes with it. Kelly's openness has motivated so many people, including me, to rethink their own paths. She proved that with patience and persistence, you can overcome challenges and feel amazing in your skin. Imagine waking up feeling energized and proud‚Äîthat's the real win.

In conversations with friends or online communities, I've seen how sharing stories like this creates a ripple effect. It's like, ""If she can do it, so can I."" **What if we all adopted a bit of that mindset?** Start small, celebrate progress, and surround yourself with support. Kelly's journey reminds us that weight loss is personal, and there's no one-size-fits-all. Whether it's trying a new recipe or going for a walk, every step counts.

# Wrapping It Up with Motivation

As we wrap this up, reflecting on *how did Kelly Clarkson lose weight* leaves me feeling pumped for my own goals. Her story is a testament to the power of natural, sustainable changes that anyone can try. Remember, it's about building a life you love, not just chasing a number on the scale. If you're ready to explore more options that could support your journey, like that *natural supplement* I mentioned earlier, don't hesitate‚Äîit's worth looking into for that extra boost.

I‚Äôm an undergraduate student major in accounting and I study in Guangzhou.

I can speak mandarin, English, Cantonese and little Spanish. I am interested in learning languages and make international friends. And I am really looking forward to connect with native English speakers to practice and improve my oral English.

If it works for you, I would like to hang out, grab a coffee or some food together on weekends.

Here‚Äôs what I can offer:

You can ask me anything about China like food, traditions or whatever, I‚Äôd be happy to answer your questions.

Also, if you are interested in learning Cantonese, I can be your Cantonese teacher.

Feel free to dm me and I‚Äôll reply whenever I see the messages! If ur also a student that would be really good.

1ne43nd,https://www.reddit.com/r/ContentCreators/comments/1ne43nd/the_lipsync_on_most_ai_dubbing_tools_is_garbage_i/,The lipsync on most AI dubbing tools is garbage. I spent a year trying to fix it. Looking for feedback.,"So, I run¬†a small YouTube channel making educational videos. A while back, I wanted to reach¬†a wider audience and decided to try dubbing my content into other languages using some of the popular AI tools out there.

The results were... awful. Complete¬†crap, honestly.

The voices were robotic, the lipsync was laughable at best and a complete¬†disaster at worst. I even tested it with my audience and according to feedbacks... well, I just made my tutorials look sloppy and unprofessional. Googling... testing... trying different things only to get frustrated as¬†there was no a better solution. Hiring professional to dub it? Well... That is just beyond a budget ‚Äì at least for me.

So! I did what any slightly insane person would do: decided to build my own.

Fast forward almost a year of late nights, being armed with some knowledge in ML, grinding through tons of research papers, some open source drafts and huuuuge pack of coffee (I should definitely apply for a tax write-off given consumed amounts lol), and I have a¬†working tool I'm calling¬†Voxara. And to the date, I believe it solves the problems I was facing as a creator.

But¬†now I have a new problem: I've been staring at this thing for so long that¬†I'm completely blind to its flaws. For my specific use case ‚Äì it works, but I¬†have no idea if it's genuinely useful for anyone else. Would be nice to know if it's¬†genuinely good or I'm just telling myself it is.

This is¬†where I could really use your help. My goal is to build it¬†with¬†the¬†creator community, not just¬†for¬†it. I need a set of fresh eyes ‚Äî fellow creators, editors, and producers ‚Äî to test it out, find out how well it applies to your area, and tell me what you honestly think.

I'm looking to bring on¬†10 people for a free private beta.

I'm keeping the¬†group small so I can work closely with everyone, and because the compute is expensive¬†to run. It'll be first-come, first-served. Once¬†I get your feedback and polish the tool for a public launch, I'll be glad to¬†share it with¬†50 next Redditors, to make their first videos processed at cost ‚Äì¬†as a thank you.

So, if you want to join and participate in building our own tool,¬†please drop a comment below¬†and I'll reach out! Let's build something great together.",1,1757582323.0,ContentCreators,1,1.0,False

Okay, real talk‚Äîanyone else feeling that haunting dread of a 9-to-5 grind slowly eating away at your creativity? üôã‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è It‚Äôs like being trapped in an endless cycle of meetings and deadlines, right? But what if I told you there‚Äôs a way out? 

**Introducing...the Creator Economy! üé®‚ú®**  
Yeah, you heard me right. You can harness your passions, skills, and a sprinkle of AI magic to create something extraordinary and, let‚Äôs be honest, way more enjoyable. Imagine a life where you‚Äôre your own boss, crafting content that actually speaks to you. Sound good? Let‚Äôs dive in!

Here‚Äôs a quick peek at why ditching the traditional work life might be the best move:

- **Freedom:** You can set your own hours. Coffee at 2 PM? Sure. Late-night creativity bursts? Yes, please!
- **Unique Income Streams:** From digital products, online courses, to affiliate marketing‚Äîyour creativity can pay off in soooo many ways. 
- **AI as Your Sidekick:** Don‚Äôt fear the robots! Use them to automate mundane tasks. Think of AI as your trusty assistant helping you brainstorm, draft, and edit your content. Who doesn‚Äôt want a productivity hack like that?

Now, let‚Äôs get to the good stuff. Here‚Äôs a simple guide to kickstart your journey as a creator: 

1. **Discover Your Niche:**  
   What are you passionate about? Music, cooking, gaming? Find that sweet spot where your interests collide with an audience craving content.

2. **Start Creating:**  
   It doesn‚Äôt have to be perfect! Grab your phone, record a video, whip up an article‚Äîjust start. The internet loves authenticity, flaws and all!

3. **Engage and Build a Community:**  
   Forget the lonely island vibe. Be human! Respond to comments, ask questions, and connect. Trust me, those connections can turn into your biggest supporters!

4. **Monetize Like a Pro:**  
   Once you‚Äôve got the ball rolling, explore how to make money! Think ads, sponsorships, or even selling merchandise. The options are endless!

5. **Lean on AI (and Chill):**  
   For marketing, scheduling, or even content ideas, let AI do the heavy lifting. Spend more time creating and less time crunching numbers. Win-win, right?

And here‚Äôs the kicker‚Äî**you don‚Äôt have to do it alone!** Join supportive communities (hello, AiContentAutomators!) to share tips, experiences, and every awkward misstep along the way. There‚Äôs a wealth of knowledge waiting for you!

Let‚Äôs not fake it, though. This lifestyle isn‚Äôt without challenges. You‚Äôll need to stay disciplined, adapt to constant changes, and keep learning. But isn‚Äôt that all part of the thrill? üåü 

So, what do you think? Is it time to toss that old 9-to-5 in the bin? Or will you let AI makes every decision for you? I'd love to hear thoughts and stories!",1,1757582028.0,AIContentAutomators,0,1.0,False

I've tried a million diets and always failed, and unrelated/but also probably related, I've always struggled with depression and mental health/self esteem, have hit rock bottom several times, and am super socially anxious.

I will be maid of honour for my best friend early next year. She, the groom and a few other friends have had gastric band surgery and lost around 110lbs. So I feel like I'll stand out even more now, and really don't want to be the biggest person there.
I think it's the kick up the butt I needed, because I've started getting fit and am doing the best I've ever done- results and duration wise.
It has been almost 3 weeks, I've been watching calories and have been landing around 700-1000 daily. And have been doing 30 mins on a cross trainer daily. I have lost 11lbs so far. I've found myself eager to push on another day- my body has never known this many endorphins üòÖ

But I have found myself growing to fear calories- snack and eat 100 cal and workout another 10 mins to burn it off? I'd rather just not eat. I live alone and am a practically a hermit, I've been able to control everything so far. But sooner or later, need to see friends- and I'm anxious, because everything always involves food. I've noticed it before- whenever anyone sees eachother food is involved, get lunch, get dinner, get coffee, go to a bar.. I don't know how to socialise without it. Maybe it's just my social anxiety, but without a vice or distraction I don't know what to do, and it's making me super nervous to see anybody.

Any suggestions on how to be social, that doesn't involve consuming calories?? üò´",3,1757581394.0,loseit,9,0.71,False

Now she has a strange habit when it comes to greetings. For example, if I say, ‚ÄúGood morning Rachel, how are you?‚Äù she won‚Äôt respond right away. Instead, she‚Äôll stay silent  focused on her phone texting, making coffee, or scrolling on her laptop, and only reply 10 seconds later. Almost preoccupied.

Yesterday, I went to her office and she greeted me first(which was surprising) asking how I was. I answered, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm doing good, and you?‚Äù but she didn‚Äôt respond. I assumed the conversation was over and walked away to get on with my day. As I was leaving, she suddenly called out, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm good, thanks.‚Äù

I don‚Äôt really understand why she does this. It feels a bit rude. 

Even in bored meetings someone can greet her she won‚Äôt respond but when the person next to her is greeted and responds, then the boss will respond.??

silly talks, absolute whimsy, genuine connections, your most unhinged memes, and maybe someone who also makes questionable life choices at ungodly hours (like talking about whether the sea is considered a soup, or if fish are just underwater birds for two hours straight). ***any age is cool,*** *(just don't be weird or romantic).* ***AND!!!

‚ùÅ **about me:** 

super bubbly, optimistic whimsical, and will probably send you very *stupid* cat memes at ungodly hours. i'm an artist (aka i draw silly stuff and call it ""art"") who gets genuinely excited about the dumbest things. i have adhd so i hyperfixate hard on things i adore!!! i'm a huge nerd who can yap forever about my hyperfixations (and i love when people do the same back). i'm here for chaotic goblin friendship energy!

1ne3qoi,https://i.redd.it/j33v8dl82iof1.png,Quick 15-Minute Vegan Tzatziki Recipe,"So, I‚Äôve been trying to find good vegan substitutes for some of my favorite sauces, and tzatziki was right up there on my list. I always loved its fresh, tangy flavor, but I wanted a plant-based version that didn‚Äôt skimp on taste. After a little experimenting, I came up with this easy homemade vegan tzatziki recipe. It‚Äôs creamy, herby, and honestly the best vegan version I‚Äôve tried so far. Great for gyros, veggie platters, or just spooning over roasted veggies.  
  
Here‚Äôs what you‚Äôll need:  
  
1 cup unsweetened vegan yogurt (I used coconut-based; almond works too)  
1 small cucumber, grated (about 1/2 cup)  
2 cloves garlic, minced  
2 tbsp fresh dill, finely chopped (or 1 tsp dried)  
1 tbsp fresh lemon juice  
1 tbsp olive oil  
1/2 tsp salt (adjust to taste)  
Pinch of black pepper  
  
And here‚Äôs how to make it:  
  
1. Start by grating the cucumber using the large holes of a box grater. Place the grated cucumber in a clean kitchen towel or paper towel and squeeze out as much moisture as you can. This step is key so your tzatziki doesn‚Äôt get watery.  
  
2. In a mixing bowl, combine the vegan yogurt, minced garlic, chopped dill, lemon juice, olive oil, salt, and black pepper. Stir until everything is well mixed.  
  
3. Add the squeezed cucumber to the bowl and gently fold it into the yogurt mixture. Taste and adjust any seasonings if needed. If you like a stronger garlic kick, you can always add a little extra.  
  
4. Let the tzatziki chill in the fridge for at least 30 minutes before serving. This gives the flavors time to meld together and makes it taste even better.  
  
5. Serve with warm pita, fresh veggies, or as a sauce for falafel, bowls, or wraps.  
  
A few tips to make it even better:  
\- If you don‚Äôt have fresh dill, dried dill works too, but you‚Äôll need less of it. Start with a small amount and add more if needed.  
\- For a thicker tzatziki, you can use a thicker vegan yogurt or strain your yogurt through a coffee filter for 10‚Äì15 minutes before mixing.  
\- Leftovers will keep for about 3 days in an airtight container in the fridge. Just give it a quick stir before using again.  
  
What‚Äôs your favorite dish to pair with tzatziki? Or if you‚Äôve made a vegan version before, do you add anything different to it?",1,1757580901.0,yummyrecipesyum,0,1.0,False

Those TikTok workflow videos definitely hurt the wallet; but man what a better experience. When it‚Äôs not a hassle or chore, it sure is a lot easier to drink a lot more coffee!

Been in the home made coffee journey 8 years now. Breville>Rancilio. My Rancilio Stile grinder gave out. Thought I‚Äôd do some meaningful upgrades. Everything in the top half is new. The Atom W65 is a fantastic weight based grinder for the money. Aside from maybe a Mahlkonig, I‚Äôm never using another grinder again. The Silvia Pro X has been a WORKHORSE every day 3-6 shots for 3 straight years. I hope it last me a decade, when it goes the Linea Mini is my next upgrade. 

The Puq Mini is a bit much, but man I‚Äôm shocked how great it is for workflow. With the grinder dispersing the dose so consistently (same little mountain of grounds every time) I do 2 pats on the side of the portafilter and it‚Äôs completely flat. Tamping takes 1 second and I‚Äôve seen no difference from that and Using a WDT (normcore) and tamper. 

The Smeg mixer allows me to froth enough milk for 2 large drinks, or mix all the cold coffee and syrup I need for iced lattes. Other than the breville this one is the biggest size I could find.

This album is a masterpiece and is probably the only album I‚Äôve heard where every track sounds better the more you listen to it, strange phenomena and L‚Äôamour looks something like you are underrated masterpieces and the highlights of her discography for me 
2. Never for ever 
This album is so magical and every track is at least a 9/10, her French cover of infant kiss is better than the original btw
3. Lionheart 
I‚Äôve had days where coffee home ground and full house are the only songs I listen to on repeat I will never understand the dislike for this album 
4. The dreaming 
This was actually my no.1 tied with Lionheart after my first listen through her discography, this album is peak experimental music 
5. Aerial 
I actually hated this album on my first listen but it heavily grew on me after I relistened to its track individually 
6. 50 words for snow 
It‚Äôs only this low cause the rest of the albums are  exceptionally amazing. I‚Äôve never heard an album with similar production to this before 
7. The sensual world 
I hated this album on first listen like aerial but some of the tracks grew on me after re listen like the fog. I think I need to give this album time to grow on me and it‚Äôll climb the rankings 
8. Hounds of love 
I‚Äôve tried my hardest to like this album but I didn‚Äôt like many of its tracks on the first, or second listen or when I tried to listen to the tracks individually. I actually wish I could enjoy this album really bad cause I love the idea behind it, it just sounds very boring to me compared to her other works 
9. Red shoes

My birthday was about a month ago. I was out of the country with my family, and my boyfriend called me the night before at midnight so he could be the first to wish me happy birthday, which was really sweet.

When I came back, I saw him for the first time 6 days after my birthday. I was so excited to see him because I missed him a lot, but we just had dinner, talked in the car for an hour, and then he dropped me off (we dont live together).

The next three times we saw each other were the same, casual dates, dinner, coffee, beach walk, no mention of gifts. I was actually expecting something as he is a really caring and detail-oriented guy, maybe just a book, some flowers, even a bd card since this was my first birthday with him (we‚Äôve been together 6 months now).

A few days later, he suggested we spend a relaxing, romantic day together at a nice Airbnb with a jacuzzi. I was over the moon and said yes. He went ahead of me to set things up (he paid for everything), and when I arrived after work all dressed up, the place was beautiful. He had brought sweets and snacks, we cuddled, talked, and shared stories all night. At one point, he took me to the bedroom where he had left a bouquet of pretty yellow flowers on the bed with a note that said ‚ÄúYellow looks great on you.‚Äù

It was a really lovely, intimate day.

Here‚Äôs where I feel a bit conflicted: now that a month has passed, I still feel sad that I never got a clear ‚ÄúHappy Birthday‚Äù gift or card. He did plan a wonderful day and get me flowers, but something about not having that explicit acknowledgment of my birthday is still bugging me.

For context, in my previous 6-year long relationship, my birthdays were barely celebrated, I often got gifts late, and only after hinting or asking and I think I‚Äôm scared of history repeating itself. I really don‚Äôt want to make my boyfriend feel like he didn‚Äôt do enough, because he genuinely put thought and effort into planning the Airbnb date. But I also don‚Äôt want to keep these feelings bottled up and start resenting him.

They would just ghost most of the time, and sometimes it happens after the second or third date. It feels like one slight mistake or awkward silence will trigger this ick in them, and it's game over

I'm starting to worry now because I'm concerned that I'm just too boring and don't have the ""it"" factor to hold a woman's interest and make her wanna stick around me long term. I may not be the most attractive but I know I'm not ugly either. Secretly, my insecurity has always been I'm not interesting enough and people get bored of me quickly. It feels like I'm just wasting their time when they could be doing something or hanging out with someone much more fun. No matter how hard I try to improve ""Being less boring"" and putting myself out there, it seems like I'm just falling short

My first dates mainly consist of coffee dates and the following dates will usually be activity dates based on what she likes. I'll keep the conversation going the best I can, flirt and tease to make it more lively. But it never feels like I'm doing ""enough"" to meet the requirements if that makes sense.

I can't tell anyone I know about this, in fear of being judged and criticized for being too boring or too much of a loser. I just pretend like it's all going well and that I never get burnt out or jaded. It seems like being boring and unable to attract a long term mate is worse than being a mean person who hurts others

Anyone else know what I need to fix to prevent myself from getting ghosted after the first few dates? Or in your experience, are some guys just doomed to be forever single?

1ne3ish,https://www.reddit.com/r/fragrance/comments/1ne3ish/reviewing_tea_perfumes/,Reviewing Tea Perfumes,"Hi everybody! I like to make video reviews of perfumes and felt like sharing some of my written notes for my latest video, which was about tea in perfume! Tea is one of my favorite notes in perfume. I‚Äôm not really a tea drinker, I actually prefer coffee as a drink for the utility, but when I have the opportunity, I enjoy the steam, the warmth, and the ritual of it. What is interesting to me about tea in fragrance is how it doesn‚Äôt always come across the way tea tastes. It can also be transportative, creating a whole setting rather than just the cup.

I‚Äôll be ranking them on a scale based on how much they actually smell like tea. 

*Category 1: Most Realistic Tea*

**Oolong Tea by One Day** ‚Äì 5/5 Teaness

Nutty, warm, and a little bitter, just like loose-leaf oolong tea. There‚Äôs a sweetness from the florals and jasmine, maybe even a touch of honey adding some animalic qualities, but the tea note is the main character. It‚Äôs dry and earthy. Wearing it feels like brewing tea in a quiet, dimly lit kitchen with an apron on and the steam hitting your face. Also, One Day is an extremely underrated house out of Hong Kong, and many of their other perfumes have the same refinement and photorealistic imagery. *try their rendition of jasmine tea, it‚Äôs good too* 

**Pour Homme, EDP by Bvlgari**‚Äì 4/5 Teaness
 
This one is sharper and aromatic with notes of tea, ginger, and gaiac wood. It comes across peppery and savory, with almost an umami bitterness. Very intellectual, very stern. I imagine a drafting engineer wearing this; someone who is focused, precise, and understated. Tea is clearly there, but it‚Äôs woven into this smart/severe architectural style.

*Category 2: Hotel-Lobby Clean*

**Neroli Amara by Van Cleef and Arpels** ‚Äî 2.5/5 Teaness

Opens with juicy orange and neroli, sweetened by something almost pear-like. There‚Äôs a lift from the pepper, and the base smells like being a child buried under a warm comforter straight out of the dryer. Classy, elegant, clean. The tea is faint, more of an accord than a 1:1.

**Au Th√© Vert by Bvlgari**‚Äì 2.5/5 Teaness

This is fleeting, with top notes of lemon and bergamot, with coriander, cardamom, and some soft florals. It‚Äôs refreshing but sheer, and unfortunately it fades quickly into a soapy musk. To me, it smells like clean skin fresh out of the shower, where you‚Äôve used a little green hotel soap bar shaped like a leaf and wrap yourself in a freshly laundered towel. Comforting, but not strong tea. 

**Au Th√© Blanc by Bvlgari** ‚Äî 3/5 Teaness 

This is the younger sibling to Vert. Still citrusy and peppery, but with musk and orange blossom. Artemisia gives it this slightly bitter note emulating that of tea. It‚Äôs paler, more powdery, more tea-like than Vert, but still in the same hotel spa category. 

*Category 3: Darker Takes*

**Gris Charnel EDP by BDK** ‚Äì 3/5 Teaness

One of the most popular tea scents in recent times, other than imagination by LV. The tea is in the background. Fig, cardamom, and sandalwood dominate. There‚Äôs some iris in there too, but it smells soft and woolen, a cozy sweater in winter. Smooth and well-blended, almost sweet, but the tea is subtle. It‚Äôs more about the mood and state of mind with which you drink tea than realism.

**L‚ÄôOmbre des Merveilles by Hermes** ‚Äì 1/5 Teaness

Purely tonka, amber, and incense. It‚Äôs mysterious and savory. It smells like rinsing off after spending the whole day at the beach, the shower steam mixing with incense that you‚Äôve lit, and out the window you catch the coastline and crashing of the waves at sunset. Purple sunlight leaks in and your hair is still crunchy from seawater, your skin slightly sticky from the salt. Really interesting but also not really tea. 

*Category 4: Fruity or Sparkling Interpretations*

**Dear Polly by Vilhem Parfumerie** ‚Äì 3.5/5 Teaness

This opens with a crisp green apple, tart and juicy, with brightness from the bergamot. The black tea comes in, with moss and smoke to darken it. It‚Äôs refreshing but also deep. It invokes the image of biting into an apple as your only breakfast, walking to class on a cool autumn morning, nobody is on campus and the dew is still wet on the grass. 

**Ethereal Wave by Liis** ‚Äì 3.5/5 Teaness

This feels like Dear Polly but more chic and sparkling. The person who wears this probably gets more sun than someone who wears Dear Polly. More citrus, more floral, lighter overall. Almost effervescent, like champagne bubbles in a glass on a sunny day. Very elegant, very wearable. 

**Aqua Allegoria Teazzurra by Guerlain** ‚Äì 2/5 Teaness

This one is a mix of  citrus with chamomile and jasmine, but also has a calone note that gives it a watery and amost melon-like accord. It doesn‚Äôt really smell like tea, more like grass and sun. To me, it smells like warming up for an AYSO Saturday morning soccer game: the field is torn-up, yellow dandelionsin the grass, the air is bright. A little strange and nostalgic, but inconsistent upon wearing because of the calone, which presents itself differently at different temperatures.

*Category 5: Complex Interpretations*

**G.A. Dandy or Not by D‚Äôorsay**‚Äì 2.5/5 Teaness

Leather, cardamom, grapefruit, orange blossom, woods. The leather here isn‚Äôt heavy, it smells soft like suede from a jacket that‚Äôs draped on the back of your chair. The tea pulls it all together in a balance. Complex, but not overwhelming. It smells like being a child snooping through your fathers office, and there‚Äôs a leather jacket on his chair, sunlight streams in through the half-closed blinds and it‚Äôs a bit dusty as you open the dresser, his sweaters smell a bit citrusy.

**Rosendo Mateu No. 1** ‚Äì 3/5 Teaness

Green note and citrus dominant: bergamot, lime, mandarin, plus lavender, rosemary, sage, thyme. There‚Äôs neroli, jasmine, musk, sandalwood, and tea leaf. It smells like laundry sheets waving in the wind, hooked on lines near an herb garden and orange trees. Very thick, very green. Tea is very nuanced, behind the spotlight but certainly there, it feels like a portrait of a sunny day in the garden. 

**Voyage d‚ÄôHerm√®s, EDP** ‚Äì 2.5/5 Teaness

Cardamom, lemon, juniper, and some peppery woods. Voyage is less about tea and more an abstraction or about being transported. Cardamom and citrus give it this creamy, aromatic warmth, invokes the feeling of being handed a cup of spiced tea in a place you‚Äôve never been before. There‚Äôs a sense of discovery. Pleasant and well-composed, but the tea is more of a supporting character. 

**Final Notes**: Ones listed above are those which I‚Äôve had the opportunity to wear multiple times and compose thoughts about them. I‚Äôve tried Creed‚Äôs silver mountain water, Byredo Sellier, Nishane Wulong Cha, Armani‚Äôs The Yulong, Louis Vuitton‚Äôs imagination, and Molecule 01 +black tea, but don‚Äôt have enough wear experience to draw conclusions from them yet. I think there is some overlap here, but I think most of these would not be ranked high for teaness, especially sellier. Neroli Outrenoir is something I would add to this list as well, but I just didn‚Äôt want to spray the last of my sample vial to write a review on it haha. 

I also have had Le Labo‚Äôs The Matcha and J-scent‚Äôs roasted green tea, but I found they didn‚Äôt really fit here, as they address a very different category of tea smell, matcha specifically. **Final conclusion, for most photorealistic, I would suggest the brand One Day!** Let me know if there‚Äôs anything else you would suggest as well, I always love to explore new scents.

So I‚Äôve been working on a series called DuRibaf√© - it‚Äôs about mixing animals and coffee in unexpected ways. This one is called Flamingo de La Capte, inspired by the south of France where flamingos actually live.

The idea: what if the eye of the animal was a cup of coffee - a little surreal, but also symbolic of how we see everyday life through rituals (like that morning espresso).

I drew this one by hand, using fine ink lines, then turned it into a framed poster.

I can't do longer fasts because I am still recovering from 3 years of binge eating disorder.

When I say on-off, I mean I did it most of the times. In rare cases, I quit the fast and I started bingeing.

Even taking in consideration the times I didn't do the fasts, I consider this a partial failure:

- I did not lose any abdominal fat and any weight;

- My long term issues are still there;

- I don't feel particularly better;

- I feel constantly tired.

I refeed for 4 days after the fast and I eat for the most part keto.

I think the root problem is that, due to the previous binge eating, my metabolism is very slow.

I also quit any form of caffeine, but I miss the energy and metabolism boost that caffeine used to give me.

I could simply drink coffee during my refeed days, but then I'd have massive headaches during the fast, usually at the 24 h mark.

So I am thinking of temporarily moving to wet fasts but drinking only coffee, maybe a shot every 3 hours, in order to boost my metabolism and then maybe later coming back to dry fasts.

I quit my job a few months ago, it was competitive with good money. But I quit because of 'Doyle.' Doyle was hired many months after me (in a different department). Before he joined, I ate lunch in the break room alone, made coffee alone, walked home alone. The only other two people in the office were Vice Presidents. They didn't pack lunches or take transit or use our crappy coffee maker, so I had a lot of alone time. When Doyle showed up, suddenly someone was joining me in the break room, at the coffee machine, and on the commute home. Yep. We had the *same* work hours, and took the *same* train home. He'd walk with me to the station and get on the train with me (a 30 min commute together daily). 

All of this is fine. He seemed like a nice and normal guy (and MARRIED with a CHILD). Then, slowly he got a lot more friendly. He'd get me gifts, cakes, compliment my heels, give me cards. He also started dropping comments about being interested in non-monogamy, and what he would do with women if he wasn't married. Then Doyle said he would change careers to remain close to me when I was potentially moving/being transferred. My stomach just... dropped. I said you can't factor me into a career change like that, it's just not appropriate. (I had been debating before this what to do about him. Freeze him out? HR? Set boundaries and not involve HR?)

He didn't say anything. Like... anything. He would not look at me. Would come and go through the emergency exit to avoid my desk now. If I spoke to him he would walk away. Came to work early and left late to avoid commuting at the same time. There were times when we were in the office alone, and I was scared. He was an entirely different person. I should've involved HR at this point, but I didn't want to. Unless they fired him, I knew it'd just make it worse. 

I tried to tell him how uncomfortable all this was for me and how I just wanted us to be cordial and have a good professional relationship. This. Man. Cried. Real tears. And asked if I was done lecturing him. That's when he started leaving weird notes at my work station, sending creepy messages about how much I had hurt him and that he would never do all the things he had done for me with someone he was just friends with. I reported Doyle to HR, they asked me to reconcile with him and  'talk it out.' I laughed, and quit. 

I know who is wife is, never met her but I found her online. I've been debating whether I should tell her. I was 22 when I joined the company, he was 30-something. I'm angry I had to quit this job because of him, my first good corporate job, and angry that he cares so little for his wife/family. So, should I tell her? He never did anything physical, which I feel like is why the company didn't really care...  and why I feel unsure about reaching out. What would I even tell her? ",0,1757579364.0,Advice,4,0.5,False

I can‚Äôt be the only one lowkey stunned at how EASY it‚Äôs become. You DON‚ÄôT need to be a tech wizard. Some testers get up to $25 per session just being brutally honest about new ideas.

By the way, if you‚Äôre feeling ‚Äúnot qualified‚Äù‚Äîditch that thought. Most of these just want *everyday users*.

One particularly bitterly cold day, I was headed to a date I wasn't that excited about. I suddenly asked myself, Is there a way to verify the basics about a guy before I waste my time on a potentially boring shitty date with someone who might turn out to be a weirdo?

**Enter, The Pre-Interview.**

I've used pre-interviews to screen candidates at work, and also to get jobs myself. They are excellent tools for quickly screening unworthy candidates.

For those of you who have never interviewed or been interviewed using a prescreen, typically myself and another manager would take turns talking to the candidate on the phone or videochat. 

Usually no more than 10 - 15 minutes. 

We would ask basic questions and then reconvene after the interview to rank them against other candidates.\
We would talk about strengths/weaknesses and come up with a few questions we would ask the candidate if we were to invite them in for a face-to-face interview.

Overtime, I have learned that pre-interviews are absolutely crucial to hiring the right candidate, and it has to do with fallibility of human nature.

Doing a phone or skype interview creates enough emotional distance for you to be objective in your evaluation. This becomes harder with face-to-face interviews.

Believe it or not, even very seasoned managers sometimes truly struggle with objectivity when it comes to hiring in face-to-face interviews. I've actually had managers hire people based on emotion only for that person to be a terrible employee that gives them absolute hell everyday.

You would also not believe the kinds of things people reveal in face-to-face interviews. Sometimes it's as morbid as Sick family members, kids, etc. Things that would really tug on the heartstrings and make everyone but a robot want to root for a candidate to win. On the other hand, Some people have sparkling and fun personalities that make it easy to gloss over all their flaws.

Problem was, no matter how much you like or want to help someone, it was obvious in the interview they were totally unqualified for the job as written. Sometimes they couldn't answer basic technical specifications of the job or displayed troubling lack of awareness about the appropriateness of certain topics that would later be a problem.

It's harder to reject candidates after you've heard their life story, hopes, and dreams. It just is.

The value of the pre-interview is cutting to the facts without all the other things to distract you.


**The Pre-Interview:**

The components of a pre-interview are as follows:

1. Skype or Facetime before going on a formal date

Everyone hates to show up to a date only to see a person who looks nothing like their pictures (if you‚Äôre meeting online) or gives you a weird creepy vibe (even though they seemed fine when you first met), and having to make an excuse to leave. 

Skype and Facetime sets this process to easy mode. You look at each other, hear each others' voice, etc and you'll be able to tell within a few minutes if this is a man you would be interested in seeing further based on physical attraction, OR what OTHER important things you‚Äôre looking for. (Personally I‚Äôm looking for OTHER things, but the choice is yours to make). 

(Of course, if you out here catfishing knowing full well you don't look like your pictures and/or you‚Äôre never going to show up for a date, then skip this part because you're going to want to keep the element of surprise or mystery going, but I WOULD NOT recommend it in general.)


2. Limit the conversation to 20 minutes or less.

This conversation should be to verify the basics - where he lives, what he does, where he works, confirm that he's single, etc, and ask what he's looking for.

If he attempts to take over the conversation, steer it back to where you want it to go. If he continues to be evasive or pushy, then you know to throw that fish back in the water, he's playing games, doesn't respect boundaries, or doesn't have his shit together.

Talk long enough to get a general vibe for him, but not long enough to get too deep.

Love bombers know that time spent = emotional investment which is why they usually try to monopolize you upfront. Don't allow them to do this.

You do not want to talk long enough to give yourself time to emotionally invest before he takes you on a formal date.

**Be aware of these Red flags/Full stops:**

* Answers every question with a question
* Attempts to neg or tease you right off the bat
* Steers the conversation to be overly sexual
* Evasive in answering basic questions
* Pushy or aggressive in any way when you set a boundary
* If he starts any conversation with some general negativity about women or sarcasm
.
Any of the behaviors above should be an immediate drop. If he can't keep it together for a 20 minute interview then he's totally fugazi, sis.

If there's anything you want to know further make a mental or physical note to ask him on your full date. Give yourself time to think him over properly and thoroughly consider if you actually want a second date.

3. Dictate very clearly the parameters in which you are willing to leave your house to see him


**The general principle here is**

Never leave your house for free for man who‚Äôs not your boyfriend/fianc√© or husband

This is your time to set the standard to which you expect to be treated. Do not leave your house for any of the following:

NO NETFLIX & CHILL
NO CAR DATES
NO COFFEE DATES
NO HOUSE DATES

There is NO such thing as ""let's just have a lowkey date and see where it goes"". You must set the standard early. You cannot go back and attempt to raise the standard later on.

To help him out, tell him the kinds of things you like, where you want to go, anything you saw that caught your interest, etc.

It's his job to make that happen for you if you want to show up. Why should you waste your time on a boring ass date? Find something you genuinely want to do and make these dudes pay for it. Even if the date doesn't go well, at least you got to try something you wanted to.

If he scoffs at any of your suggestions, drop him. He's cheap, a time waster, just here for easy intimacy, etc. This is supposed to be his time to impress you with his creativity, thoughtfulness, class, etc.

(I will write another part detailing why this is and under what conditions you should accept dates, later)

**So to recap:**
Doing pre-interviews allows you to talk to 3-4 guys in an hour to verify their attractiveness, screen for red flags, and set the parameters and expectations as to which you're willing to meet them while maintaining enough emotional distance to be objective. It's also much safer!

I‚Äôm nearly 33F and my boyfriend is 46M. We‚Äôve been together about 6 years ‚Äî long-distance for 5, then I came to his city about a year ago (I spend about 70% of my time here currently). It‚Äôs much smaller than the international city I came from, where I still have a flat rented out. My career (artistic) depends on expansion, travel, and being in bigger cultural hubs, and while I *can* pursue this independently, I often feel like I don‚Äôt have a true partner in that part of my life, since his world is rooted here with his 8-year-old daughter, family, friends, and work.

It often feels like he is very resourced here and has everything he needs, whereas I have some very fundamental inner need unmet.

He recently proposed (a truly beautiful proposal!), and I‚Äôm conflicted.

* My fundamental need for expansion (city life, travels, growth) feels compromised here, and because of that, I find it much harder to deal with the annoyances of step-parenting.
* For example: earlier this week his BM called him 10 times during my show, then started pushing him to have coffee/lunch meetings to discuss ‚Äúconcerns.‚Äù She even put a meeting in his agenda without asking him. I ended up drained and out of my flow for several days, actually unable to concentrate.
* When his daughter is here (every other week), the whole energy of the household shifts, and I often feel sidelined or drained. This past weekend I for the first time in my life experienced something that felt like depression because of the energy of the childcare weekend and what a stark contrast it was to our vibe alone with SO.

I love him and want marriage and my own family one day. Would saying yes to this proposal would mean sacrificing too much of myself and my dreams?

For context: I come from a blended family myself (3 step-siblings). But my mother and stepdad never let having kids stop them from traveling, expanding, moving countries for work, and taking us along. That international openness really shaped who I am today. Yes I lost some rootedness, but it doesn't even compare to what I \*gained\*. What I witness here feels so much more suffocating, and I realise it‚Äôs probably triggering something from my childhood - a fear of being hemmed in. I also probably keep wishfully expecting him to become more open-minded too, but chances are low (especially considering the level of control exerted by BM).

Has anyone else had to navigate this - balancing love, stepfamily dynamics, and a deep need for growth and expansion? How did you decide?",0,1757579165.0,stepparents,8,0.5,False

At that time, it was only me, my boss, and two other staff. Then, one of my boss‚Äôs close friends took over the company. I‚Äôm like my boss‚Äôs right-hand man ‚Äî everything goes through me. Even the new boss also trusts me and sees me as a good worker. Both of them like me.

But this new boss has his own assistant. He‚Äôs unmarried, while I‚Äôm married. The new boss takes him everywhere ‚Äî even at night, sometimes at 3 AM, to the beach or for work. The new boss is a hardworking type and always tells us that hard work is the only way to succeed and grow the business. Since the assistant is single and lives in a bed space, it‚Äôs easy for him to always be available. The boss uses him almost like a slave, and the guy accepts it. This benefits the boss because he gets free overtime work. They don‚Äôt pay for overtime ‚Äî just praise him, saying things like ‚Äúhe‚Äôs the one running the company.‚Äù

My problem is, I can‚Äôt do that. I have a wife and a family life. When office time is over, I need to leave. But they don‚Äôt support that ‚Äî they think only about hard work, late nights, and overtime without pay.

Now, this assistant feels threatened by my position with the bosses, since I‚Äôm really the one who handles most things for them. To my face, he acts nice, but slowly he started treating me in small ways like I‚Äôm below him. For example:

* Asking me to bring him water or coffee.
* Telling me to pour him water just because the filter is closer to my side of the desk. At first, I helped, because I didn‚Äôt know how to refuse.

He also tried to impress me with his trading by showing a demo account as if it was real. But when I showed him my actual funded account, he went quiet ‚Äî he realized I‚Äôm better at it. Now, he tries to peek at my screen whenever he can, pretending to be on a call near my desk, watching which software I use.

He even tries to compete in silly ways ‚Äî for example, if I hum a song quietly, he starts singing loudly on purpose. He shows off his iPhone 15 Pro, while I have a 16 Pro Max and more gadgets than him. My salary is also higher.

With all this, he keeps trying to bully me in small ways whenever he gets the chance. I try to avoid him and don‚Äôt talk unless necessary. If he greets me, I greet him back. Sometimes he greets everyone except me, so I do the same. But now, it‚Äôs becoming a headache.

Na one day nakabihis ka ready to go to work pero ayaw gumalaw ng body and mind mo? Like the thought of going to work makes your heart beats faster? One week na rin akong absent sa work (my reason was family matters kahit ako talaga may problema). It was a kind of work na hindi naman mahigpit sa absent kasi parang part time job sya and tbf, mababa lang din yung sahod.

Pero I wanted to resign na this day. Andun na ako sa work, papasok nalang pero nag back out ako last minute at tumambay nalang sa coffee shop. I still want to render work para okay yung separation ko sa job.

Any inputs will help. And also just a bit of context, I have minor depression and also suspecting of having ADHD. Addtl question na rin guys. Sa mga nadiagnosed na with ADHD, do you have a problem with maintaining and staying in your work?

Okay, friends, let‚Äôs talk real for a second. You know that feeling when you scroll through social media and see someone casually raking in cash from their content? You‚Äôre like, ‚ÄúHow are they doing that?!‚Äù Well, here‚Äôs the scoop ‚Äî you could be doing it too! 

But let‚Äôs be honest. Are you even thinking about monetizing your AI-generated content? Because if you‚Äôre not, you‚Äôre basically throwing money out the window. Seriously! 

**Why should you care? Here‚Äôs a wake-up call:**

- üí∏ **You‚Äôve put in the effort!** Whether it's blog posts, social media content, or videos, your hard work deserves to be rewarded.
- ü§ñ **AI is your friend!** Use it to churn out engaging content faster than ever. 
- ‚è∞ **Time is ticking!** The digital landscape is evolving, and the opportunities to monetize are only getting more competitive.

So, how do you turn that sweet AI content into sweet cash? Here are a few snappy ideas to kickstart your money-making journey:

1. **Affiliate Marketing**: This one's like making money in your sleep! Embed affiliate links in your content. When your audience clicks and buys, you cash in. Easy peasy!

2. **Paid Memberships or Subscriptions**: Create exclusive content behind a paywall. Charge a small fee so your most dedicated fans can get behind-the-scenes goodies. Who doesn't love a peek behind the curtain?

3. **Online Courses**: If you‚Äôve mastered a skill with your AI content, package that knowledge into an online course! People pay to learn, and if you can teach them something valuable, watch the sign-ups roll in! 

4. **Sponsored Content**: Partner with brands that align with your content. They pay you to create content featuring their products. It‚Äôs like a win-win, right? Brands get exposure, and you get paid! 

5. **Sell Digital Products**: E-books, templates, guides ‚Äî if you‚Äôve created something awesome, why not sell it? It‚Äôs digital, which means low overhead. 

The best part? You don‚Äôt have to be a tech wizard or a marketing guru to start. Just throw on your creativity hat (it‚Äôs a vibe, trust me) and dive in! 

And let‚Äôs not forget ‚Äî **the AI world is changing fast.** By October 2023, new tools and revenues streams are popping up daily. Are you keeping pace with this growth? Or are you just hanging back, watching others capitalize on what you could be doing? 

But hey, I get it. The fear of failure can be crippling. What if it doesn‚Äôt work? What if you bomb? Well, here‚Äôs the thing‚Äîwhat if it does work? 

Imagine the possibilities! You could be sipping coffee, making money while you sleep, or even quitting your day job. The dream is real, but only if you take that leap! 

So, what‚Äôs holding you back? Have you tried any of these strategies before? Let‚Äôs talk about it! üí¨",1,1757578470.0,AIContentAutomators,0,1.0,False
1ne34rg,https://www.reddit.com/r/Crush/comments/1ne34rg/so_i_have_a_crush_on_my_tattoo_artist_the/,"So, I have a crush on my tattoo artist. The Question is does he have crush on me? I would love your advice on that","I am 26 years old woman, working as a therapist, and in early June I went to get my first tattoo. I was thinking about getting inked since I was 21. The tattoo artist seemed very nice, we hit it off right of the bat, he is few years my senior, but no worrying age gap. Talked about social constraints, life, our desires and so on. For the hour and a half I sat in that chair we never shut up. At the end of the tattoo session, we established a date and hour for the second piece and I got out of there smiling, he smiled at me quite a lot too. 
Then the second piece comes and I am late a good 30 minutes because of traffic and I know usually tattoo artist get annoyed at clients when they are really late. This one did not, he actually calmed me about it. Asked him if I should keep quiet this time and he told me I should do how I feel, and we talked again, we got more personal this time, brushing shared childhood trauma, bullying and so on. I told him at the end of the session just after paying (he charged me oddly little about a quarter of the price less than my first tattoo, $40, the quality of his work is really good) for the tattoo that I want to get a Medusa tattoo, I showed references to him excited. He seemed really into what I was getting, and did not mind me digging through my phone for all the reference photos. 
I sat a few weeks with it untill mid July and made an appointment, he answered less than five minutes after I texted. The day of the appointment comes and I am late again, 30 mins, because a patient of mine had a panic attack. I get there, apologising for being late, he tells me about how some client before annoyed him, I do say in that context I am sorry for adding more to the annoyance. He told me he did not actually got upset on me, or my inquisitive questions(I asked him about his shorter limb and prostetic, the story and so on). 
We get to the stencil placement, I want it on my belly/abdomen, I moved to quite a lot untill I felt it is right. We move to the tattoo itself and we start chatting and then joking and then we are fully flirting (eg: him -there is no pain, only pleasure. Me- there is pain, but keep going. No taking that back. The context is that we are both a bit alternative/edgy). He was not sleezy at all, I have a nose for sleazy men and he was not. in between jokes he kept checking about my state beyond the chatter, if I am ok, if something bothers me, If I wish for a break. And then we got into talking about our favourite TV shows, mine is Hannibal, and it's on his favourites list too. I told him I picked up my passion for cooking there. Coincidence, he was really into cooking too. And we both apparently sharpen our knives very frequently, and get annoyed when a blade does not cut. There was a spark in his eyes, and in mine too, I have light coloured eyes and wear sunglasses in studio lights, but I took them off then to look at him. Then I told him the story of medusa, the rape, the punishment. And I told him if fits mine too, he asked me how and I spilled it all, the repeated SA by my ex, the domestic violence that turned into two attempts on my life by him before I turned 22. I told him that my life was saved by the fact my former kickboxing instinct kicking in and managing to outfight a less organised but larger man, my ex. I broke a vase on his skull too, I wanted to live. He got away with breaking and entering charges and I had just saw him in town while I was in the taxi going to the tattoo studio. At the end of the SA story, he joked that the ex deserves more vases broken in that thick skull of his. And another tirade of funny stuff untill I was laughing with tears. I told him if I were a hug person, he will get hugged right there. Then he told me I was his kind of woman and if he were not with a wounded wing (the disability) he would want a sparring session with me. That cought me by surprise but, oh boy, do I wanted that too. He opened up to me about his emotion, his disability, how world feels entitled to his story, how and why and where, about choosing not to have children and so on, there is more but would be too long. 
He charged me very little for three four hours of work on me, and I asked if he is sure, I joked he should charge more for me trauma dumping, and he said it's fine. And next came another tattoo, Judith Slaying Holophernes, I showed up to the appointment after a night filled with paperwork and insomnia, told him about that, and he treated me with water in fun sized paper cups. He took jabs at my boss with me for letting me deal with all the files. He told me to get revenge once I get my Phd recomandation letter from the boss. I told him how my step sister does not agree with my tattoo journey, and he told me when she the gets next one I should tell her it's downright ugly. We went into Judith and he made me smile and laugh again, at the end my cheeks hurt and the tattoo did not. He charged oddly little, 60 euro. And then a month and a half passes, he is really interacting with my IG stories in that time frame and we exchanged observations and short messages. Then I made an appointment for my fifth and sixth tattoo and he answered again really quick. We fixed a date. I come there without my usual morning coffee, a bit burnt out and I got a lot of patience from him. I fumbled with my long bow earrings because they were touching the skin where the tattoo is going to be, then removed them prom my ear. I fumbled with the buttons of my dress trying to uncover the shoulder and so on. I was very clumsy that day (I have peripheral neuropathy so adding that to tiredness it's like a sure recipe for fumble and clumsy). We started the tattoo process and my hairpin got stuck in my blonde curly hair, he just watched me untangle with a sheepish, under the beard, smile and then told me to be a little less fussy. I listened stopped moving and closed my eyes and it took less than ten minutes for him to break the quiet and ask me if I am ok, I told him, ya, surface level. We got into banter and he made me smile and laugh after that. We then got to my sternum piece, a dagger with two bows, I wanted one removed, but it seems his tattoo machine took life and gave the dagger the extra bow on the upper hilt anyway. (I do not mind, I now like it better that way). I commented that the vibration against my sternum feels pelasurable and the pain is not bad. He told me that it's just pleasure. I hinted what If I scream. Him: one screams from pleasure. Then some minutes passed with exchanges of this pattern and I returned with ""trust the guy with the needle"" to which he added ""that's what she said"". When he rested he fixed his chair in my direction and we chatted again. I teased him about me being a nightmare client and we chatted about truly awful people that we met at work. 
I opened about not being able to cry and him about crying when things bubble to the surface. While he applied the oitment and bandages I noticed his hands wore bare, no gloves, one of them resting near my damn chest, I did not mind, in fact the opposite. If I had drank my coffee that day I would have been a smart ass about it. 
I had a harder time sitting once it was done because a lack of caffeine induced headache had overtook me. He helped me sit and I stared struggling with my buttons and bustier front closing. He stood patiently there and waited for me to do it in my own time. I am thankful for that. At the end another of those smiles came and something in the eyes. In his office, I used the mirror to put my earrings back on and they got tangled, again. Another smile, and then my hairpin, the smile continues. I asked some questions he did not rush to tell a price, so I asked him. He told me 50 euros, I noticed it was too little, but he kept reassuring not to worry. I struggled to find the exact sum since I had bigger bills, I gave him 40 and I was looking for a the 10 in messy wallet but he took the 40 put in the cashier's and did not really seem to be waiting for the rest, I gave it anyway with a look because I am damn sure that's too little for the amount of work. So I kept grilling him with my curiosity and told him about I got an allergic reaction to some plant during a nature walk near Florence in my Holliday. He got quite inquisitive there and told me not to dare scratch the healing tattoos. And thus, we said our goodbyes. Is he crushing or being nice?",1,1757578441.0,Crush,0,1.0,False
