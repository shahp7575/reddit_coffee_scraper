I’ve found that I’m much more likely to relate with someone I meet through the internet than someone I meet in person, just because the internet has tailored our ability to find like-minded people

I craved for a free, open, and honest conversation, where I can be myself more. Where i don't have to pressure myself to think deep just to prove a point. A light conversation, but not too lightly that it seems like we're only wasting our time and energy. Maybe just in the middle. Where we can learn something from one another, at the same time not pressuring the both of us.

**Original** [Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/AITA_WIBTA_PUBLIC/comments/1bq0cmw/aita_for_losing_my_27f_cool_with_my_parents/)**: March 28, 2024**

Lost my cool with my (27f) parents (57f, 59m) for pushing me to forgive my cheating ex.

I was to be married in July. Two months ago I came home from a work trip to find my ex fiance in bed with my bff's sister. I kicked him out, cancelled the wedding, warned him I would get rid of his stuff if he didn't come get it all then weeks later dumped it all on the curbside with a FREE sign, sold or donated or dumped everything he gave me, and pawned the ring. I blocked him everywhere. Called the cops on him when he showed up (after I gave his stuff away) banging on my door, called them again when he turned up at my workplace and made a scene, and called them on his family when they showed up en masse to plead his case.

I didn't go scorched earth on ex bff's sister. I did tell her husband I caught her in bed with my ex. Last I heard she'd been kicked out of the house and was back living with her parents.

Ex bff tried talking me into giving them both a chance to explain (what? No) then got angry at me for ruining her sister's relationship, called me petty and cold hearted. So I kicked her to the curb too. I don't want dishonest people that are blasé about betrayal in my life. This encounter no doubt simmered under my skin until I unleashed on my parents. Maybe that’s the reason, because it lingered, I was so harsh with them.

Last week I met my parents for dinner. I took a date with me to the restaurant hoping his being there would waylay any discussion about my failed engagement. My parents have been pressuring me to work things out with the ex. He's so, so sorry. I owe it to him to talk with him. Give him 5 minutes to explain himself. She meant nothing to him, he made a mistake. I'm cruel for shutting him out the way I have. How could I call the police on him? How could I do the same to his family? His parents? They're good people, they didn't deserve to be humiliated in that manner. He's having a rough time. He's depressed. Everybody is worried about him. He loves me, really loves me. He's learned his lesson. It's time to grow up and forgive him.

No. My date's presence didn’t stop them from bringing it all up again.

I lost my cool. Asked my father if he expected me to give my ex a pass everytime he sticks his dick into anything that moves? Like he does. I asked my mother how turning a blind eye to her husband's infidelity works for her. How does she hold her head up while having lunch with women that have slept around with her husband for years? Is that the kind of men, the life she wants for me and my sister? For her daughters? I asked if they had any idea of the impact that knowledge had on me and my siblings growing up. Knowing that dad was late home from work because he was screwing his secretary. Knowing ""work weekend"" was code for dirty weekend with a woman not our mother. Did they not know why it was that of their four children, I am the only one that still talks to them? Do they not question why they were not invited to my brothers weddings? Why they have never met either of my brothers wives and children? Do they think my sister's silence is because she's being dramatic and throwing a tantrum? Really?

I stood from the table, congratulated them on the loss of their last, remaining child, and told them I hoped their arrogance, willful blindness, and misery was a comfort them to their last breaths. Then I left.

My date, I should've saved him for a proper date rather than a f-you to my parents, took me to the nearest bar, let me cry on his shoulder while I proceeded to get shit faced, then made sure I got home safely. The next day he messaged me to see if I was alive and sent a double cheeseburger, large fries, and a large Sprite over with DoorDash.

I didn't block my parents but I haven't heard from them. It's been a week and I've calmed down enough to feel regret. Not for what I said, but because I can see the looks on their faces when I made my final farewell. I crushed them, hurt them, especially my mother. Despite their faults, and there are many, I love my parents. I don't like knowing I hurt them. I'm feeling a lot of guilt about it.

AITA?

EDIT - I have yet to read all the comments, but from what I have seen so far, I think some details need to be cleared up.

* My date knew we were going to have dinner with my parents. He asked me out that morning. I told him my plans for the evening and jokingly asked if he wanted to come along. I didn’t expect him to say yes. I then informed him I wasn't serious , and anyway, it would probably be a little uncomfortable, and he said if needed, he could post bail. So, there you go. He did not enter that restaurant unaware of potential drama.

EDIT #2 - The people mentioned in my post are not the only people in my life. I have my siblings in my life. They didn't cut me off. My sister flew in to be with me just days after I discovered the cheating. And I have good friends. Friends who helped me pack up ex's things. Helped me to move it all down to the curb. A friend that found me a guy that paid a fair price for the engagement ring. I only mentioned ex, ex bff, etc, because how they acted and what they were saying contributed to all those buried feelings that had been dormant for years coming out when they did, in the way they did.

***Some of OOP's Comments (there were a ton, so these are just a few)***

*Ex's parents:*

>My ex's parents are on the periphery of my parents' circle, and I have no doubt that they know all about my father's too many to count infidelities. I can well imagine that they expected me to put up with the same disrespect my mother has all these years.

Commenter: You love your parents but you don't like them nor their decisions. Completely makes sense given what you have told us about your childhood and their recent behaviour.

What do you need them to do to remain in your life as non-toxic ?

Think about that. What do you need them to do? What would be the ideal and what would be the bare minimum.

>**OOP:** Ideally, I'd like my mother to leave my father and take him for everything. That will never happen. Another thing that won't ever happen is my father practising discretion. What does he, what do they care, for the humiliation they forced on us? Knowing their own needs and desires will always be prioritised over anyone else's, I'd settle for an acknowledgment of the hurt we've endured for most of our lives. But I don't think I should hold my breath for that.

Commenter: Could well be that seeing how her mom sees nothing amiss with her partner cheating and how op seemed to have no issue with it, thats why the ex thought there’d be no consequences for him either.

>**OOP:** I can see how people would think that. I didn’t talk about it, ever, with anyone but my sister. Even then, we were both drunk and high when it came up. Of course others would think I accepted that things were as they were. Of course they would. It's not like anyone asked if I was ok with it, so how could they be expected to know that I wasn't? I understand that pov.

*To a downvoted commenter:*

>My parents' choices had a direct and negative impact on my life and the lives of my siblings. If their choices had been discreet and not an open secret that we all learned about in late childhood/early teens, then maybe we wouldn't have had to live under the weight of the knowledge. But we did, and that's on them.  
Why should I have let anyone speak on behalf of the man who cheated on me? They went from almost being my family to people I'd rather avoid in an instant. I don't have to justify that to them just like I don't have to listen to whatever bs they were geared up to tell me. My unwillingness to hear them out said everything I needed to say.  
I'll own entitled bitch. Because I am entitled to my peace of mind.

*The ring being the ex's legally:*

>Not in my state. He gave it to me. It was mine to do with as I pleased. It pleased me to pawn it.

Commenter: I'm curious though, you and your siblings were so affected by your father's infidelity growing up because your mother didn't care? Or because you saw how much it hurt her, but she put up with it?

>**OOP:** I can only speak for myself. My father's infidelity was an open secret. We were probably the last ones to know, but we couldn’t avoid knowing. And we couldn’t share, not even with each other. I figured out it was a secret that everyone knew. Everyone ignored it, and no one talked about it. Therefore, it was shameful. It became painful when I realised my mother knew.  
I started to understand why she would start to tense up when my father didn't arrive home at a specific time, why I could hear her crying in her room after we had gone to bed, why her and my father would argue when he went away for whole weekends at a time, why she would start banging pots around in the kitchen when he would come home and head straight for the shower. All these things and more that caused my mother hurt. Then, to realise that she was in part responsible for her own pain by not doing anything to stop from being hurt by him. It messed me up. But I loved my mother, and I loved my father, so I kept silent about the secret, and that messed me up more.

Commenter: What I want to know if they argued back? Did they defend themselves? Did your mom say I did it to keep the family together? She really thought none of you knew? Grandparents paternal side probably told your mom to look away. It was normal.

>**OOP:** They didn't sit there passively while I went off my half cooked, but they didn’t make a scene. Or most likely, my scene overshadowed theirs. I don't really remember exactly what they said. There was a lower your voice, don't speak to your mother like that, an I can't believe you're choosing to do this now. I think there may have been a we can discuss this later.

**Update** [Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/AITA_WIBTA_PUBLIC/comments/1fs4fch/update_aita_for_losing_my_27f_cool_with_my/)**: September 29, 2024 (6 months later)**

It's been a minute since I was here last. Life has been busy, work has been busy, and updating Reddit wasn't on my mind. Apologies to all those that continue to send messages asking for an update. I figure better late than never.

A quick recap. Lost my temper with my parents when they tried to push me to forgive and reconcile with my cheating ex. Some really hurtful and harsh truths were shared by me to them in the moment. Afterwards I felt tremendous guilt. The regret started to eat at me.

Where to start? First a thank you to all who replied to my post. I tried to read every comment, and though I didn't post for the validation most of you gave, receiving it did lighten the load a little bit. It didn’t take away from the guilt I carried, but I was able to work through that to see that although my timing was off, what I said was absolutely necessary. Thank you, too, to some of those that sent me private messages rather than posting on the main thread. Having read your own stories of a similar upbringing, conversing with you has helped me to understand that my childhood and teens were traumatic. That those years left wounds that I'd never addressed until this all came about.

One more shout out to those that sent harassing messages about my choices. Those people that preached about the sanctity of marriage, and how men are basic creatures with basic needs. Those that attempted to school me in how to be a woman that needs to leaen to do my duty by allowing a man his vices, and that it was really all my fault for not supporting my ex in his time of need. Special shout out to the men that offered to teach me how to be submissive, and learn my place in this world. And last but not least, the sweet little chicken nugget that told me my reaction was proof that I am a serial cheater and my ex should have used a cattle prod on my happy place. It must've been tough for all of you when your women left. Big props to those ladies for escaping a life of misery with you.

Now for what has happened since.

My mother left my father not long after my post. Maybe a couple of weeks after. She showed up at my apartment one night with her luggage. I can't explain how broken and pitiful she was. I brought her inside, held her, and my heart broke for her. I realized then that she had no one she could turn to, absolutely no one. No family, no friends. I cannot help but wonder if she had been all alone for all the years of her marriage, and if me or one of my siblings had said something sooner, would she have had the courage to leave my father then? I'd never seen my mother, usually so dignified and unruffled, look so broken. It shocked me to see her that way. It worried me so much that I made her sleep in my bed with me. I called my siblings and within days they all came to show support and love. Then it was me, my mother, and my sister sleeping in my bed. It was good for her to see that her children still cared. Because we did care, we did love her. It was the situation my siblings distanced themselves from.

At first my mother stayed with me. She was having a hard time of it. Years of humiliation, shame and guilt ate at her. I was worried about her state of mind and didn't like to leave her alone. I couldn't take time off work to be with her every second of the day, so I took her to the shelter and we got her a dog. My thinking was if she had something to take care of, it would distract her from dark thoughts. I was hoping for a puppy because they're playful and would keep her busy, but she fell in love with a 5 year old mixed breed, and he fell right back. He's a goof. We don't know how it happened but we woke up one night to him howling because he had somehow wedged his head in between the spindles on the stairs. His whole head. We had to call the fire department to rescue him. Of course my mother didn't think he was at fault and she now refers to him as her baby. He adores my mother though. My oldest brother moved some things around rhen moved her across the country to live with him and his family. He thought she would do better if there was no chance of her running into dad or one of his many women. He found her a therapist and that seems to be working. She is loving being a grandmother and all reports are that she is an indulgent one. She has a separate in-law suite so she gets to see them every day. My brother tells me when the kids go missing, they can now be found at grandma's.

My dad... is my dad. He doesn't lack for company. I had a dinner with him not long after my mother moved across the country where he introduced me to the new woman in his life. I reminded them both that I knew exactly who she was considering she called my mother her best friend for all my life. Cue another awkward dinner. My dad tried to make it as pleasant as he could but whenever she spoke to me I would bring up a memory from my childhood of her spending time with our family and ask if she was sleeping with my father all the way back then. The next day he called to tell me how disappointed he was with me. I felt it only fair to share my own disappointments. We argued for a bit. He tried to downplay all he had done over the years, tried to play the victim of his own actions. I ended up cutting the conversation short and blocking him. It was just over a month ago when he showed up at my door. I wouldn't let him in and I'm sure that rattled him some. He told me he didn't want to lose me too. Say what you want about him but he is my dad. I love him. I don't want to lose him either. He promised he wouldn't force me to interact with any of his women. So far we have had a couple of pleasant outings that have gone well so far. I am cautiously hopeful that we can continue to be in each other's lives.

As for me, well, I took that advice some of you gave me and I am in therapy. It is humbling to come to the realization that though you may think you're fine, you are, actually, not. It has been almost unbearable to face all that history, and excruciatingly painful to dig through it all. At the end of some sessions all I want to do is head to the nearest bar and drink until I forget all about what I just went through to find out where it all started, and why I am the way I am. I think therapy is one of the most difficult things I have ever done. I don't know how some of you have been doing it for as long as you have. I also don't know why you do it so willingly. I'm a crazy nutter for listening to all you nutters in the first place. But it is helping.

Now, for the update most of you want. I can not even tell you how many messages I continue to receive from people wanting to know about him. It was almost like you all were saying ""Girl, we don't care about whatever life crisis you're going through, just tell us about the date."" Well, I haven't replied to any of those queries because my post wasn't about him. Now, i figure, in a roundabout way, I owe you something because you all played a part in where we are today. I won't give a rundown of everything that has happened between us but I will give you a few things.

He contacted me after seeing a podcast on YouTube. He sent me a link with the query ""Is this you?"" It would be an understatement to say I was mortified. My mortification kept me from replying to him. I was so deep in my embarrassment that I didn’t even bother to read the messages he sent me over the next couple of weeks. When I finally did read them it was to find a whole heap of screenshots of people's comments. I'm going out on a limb by saying you don't need me to tell you the contents of the comments he was sending me. I eventually got back to him. It was difficult for us to make time to see each other. As I stated earlier, my life, both personal and professional, has been busy busy. He also has a life and work. We were only able to meet up for coffee a couple of times. I didn’t think we were going to be able to grow a friendship let alone anything beyond that. I've since learned that he is tenacious and persistent. Like a dog with a bone. He kept at it until we found time to go on a second date.

That date went well and lead to another. Then another. Then he introduced me to the two most important people in his life. His grandparents. His grandfather carves little wooden figurines and I have since acquired a flock of wooden birds. His grandmother thinks I'm too skinny. She feeds me whenever I see her, and usually sends me home with food.

He gets along with my sister and brothers. He came with me to visit my mother on her birthday and met them all. He was very gracious with her.

I had him saved in my phone as Cheeseburger. He took issue with that because he bought me a double cheeseburger. So I started calling him double cheese, and then shortened that to DC. He is still saved in my phone as Cheeseburger.

He's an undercover Swiftie and I don't quite know what to do with that. I don't have anything against Taylor Swift but I sure didn't pick him to love her. He did use his little sister and niece as cover for his Taylor Swift love. Now he uses me. I am fine with being so used.

***Some of OOP's Comments:***

*Why do you even still love your dad/are you in contact with him?*

>I love my dad. It's possible to love someone yet abhor what they do. Just like I love my mother even though she stayed. I will not feel guilty for loving both my parents. It will never happen.  
(further down the thread) Where do I dodge the question? I love my dad. I love my mother. What he put us through was a firm of abuse, and what she forced us to endure by staying was also a form of abuse. I love them anyway. I'm not going to deny it. I love my parents.

Just got diagnosed with ADHD and autism at 40 and started Ritalin on Friday (half tab in morning and another at midday to start with and building up half a tab each week per dose from there). 

On the first day, both doses felt great. Energised with a clearer head and less task paralysis. I felt on top of the world compared to how I’ve felt for many years. Each day since, only the morning dose has felt that way and the midday dose fills me with a horrible feeling of dread, anxiety and agitation - like a chemical/physical feeling of dread more than an emotional one if that makes sense. Obviously I’ll raise it with my psychiatrist but my next check-in appointment is five weeks off and I was curious if this was a teething issue others might have had and worth pushing through? One thought was that I could have additional anxiety from cutting my coffee down suddenly (down to 1 in the morning as opposed to 4-5 per day as per my psychiatrist’s suggestion) but I’ve never had anything like this in the past when I’ve gone cold turkey off coffee. It’s usually just tiredness, a bit of light agitation and some bad headaches for 3-4 days. Never a feeling of dread and heavy anxiety. 

Would really appreciate any advice or input from others who might have been through something similar. Maybe Ritalin just isn’t the right chemical fit for me?

 Edit: meant to say I’m having my 1 coffee first thing in the morning which is why I thought of it. Possibly the Ritalin is amplifying the withdrawal symptoms later in the day that I otherwise would have found quite manageable?",1,1728187554.0,ausadhd,0,1.0,False

1fx83ik,https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueCrimeX/comments/1fx83ik/the_manson_family_murders_a_true_crime_story/,The Manson Family Murders: A True Crime Story,"The Manson Family murders, which took place in the summer of 1969, remain one of the most infamous crime sprees in American history. These brutal killings were orchestrated by Charles Manson, a charismatic and manipulative cult leader, and carried out by his loyal followers, who came to be known as the ""Manson Family."" The crimes shocked the nation and left a lasting scar on Hollywood and the counterculture movement of the 1960s.

# Charles Manson: The Charismatic Leader

Charles Manson was born on November 12, 1934, in Cincinnati, Ohio, to a teenage mother. His early life was marked by neglect, abuse, and time spent in reformatories and prisons. By the time he was released from prison in 1967, Manson had developed a bizarre blend of beliefs, drawing from Scientology, the Bible, and various esoteric philosophies. His magnetism and ability to manipulate vulnerable people led him to gather a group of young, disenfranchised followers.

Manson preached about an impending apocalyptic race war, which he called ""Helter Skelter,"" borrowing the name from a Beatles song. He convinced his followers that they needed to spark this war by committing heinous acts of violence. Manson believed that the chaos these murders would cause would trigger the downfall of society, and he and his ""family"" would emerge as leaders of a new world order.

# The Manson Family

The Manson Family was made up of a group of mostly young women and a few men, many of whom were former middle-class citizens who had fallen into drug use and were searching for meaning in the counterculture movement of the late 1960s. Manson, who controlled his followers through a mixture of drugs, psychological manipulation, and charismatic rhetoric, convinced them to participate in his deranged plans.

The group lived together at the Spahn Ranch, an old movie set outside of Los Angeles. The ranch served as their base of operations, where they prepared for the race war that Manson was sure would come.

# The Murders

The most notorious of the Manson Family's crimes occurred over two nights in August 1969, leaving seven people dead and shaking Hollywood to its core.

# The Tate Murders (August 8-9, 1969)

On the night of August 8, 1969, Manson instructed his followers Charles ""Tex"" Watson, Susan Atkins, Patricia Krenwinkel, and Linda Kasabian to go to 10050 Cielo Drive, a secluded home in the Benedict Canyon area of Los Angeles, and ""totally destroy everyone in \[the house\], as gruesome as you can."" The house was being rented by actress Sharon Tate and her husband, director Roman Polanski. Although Polanski was out of the country at the time, Tate, who was eight and a half months pregnant, was at home with three friends: Jay Sebring, a celebrity hairstylist; Abigail Folger, a coffee heiress; and Wojciech Frykowski, Folger's boyfriend.

The killers broke into the house, and what followed was a night of horrific violence. Sharon Tate and her friends were brutally stabbed and shot to death. Tate, who begged for her life and the life of her unborn child, was killed in cold blood. Atkins used Tate's blood to write the word ""PIG"" on the front door, a symbol of the Manson Family's twisted attempt to frame these murders as part of a larger societal revolution.

# The LaBianca Murders (August 9-10, 1969)

The next night, Manson himself accompanied a group of his followers—Tex Watson, Patricia Krenwinkel, Leslie Van Houten, and Steve ""Clem"" Grogan—to the home of Leno and Rosemary LaBianca, a wealthy couple who lived in the Los Feliz neighborhood of Los Angeles. Manson entered the home, tied up the LaBiancas, and then left, ordering his followers to kill them. The murders were as brutal as the previous night's spree, with Watson, Krenwinkel, and Van Houten taking turns stabbing the victims. Krenwinkel wrote phrases like ""Death to Pigs"" and ""Helter Skelter"" on the walls in blood, furthering Manson’s narrative of a coming revolution.

# The Investigation and Trial

The murders were initially a mystery, with no immediate leads connecting the Manson Family to the crime scenes. However, in October 1969, Manson and several of his followers were arrested on unrelated charges of car theft. In jail, Susan Atkins boasted to a fellow inmate about her involvement in the Tate murders, which ultimately led to the unraveling of the case.

In 1970, Charles Manson, along with several of his followers, was put on trial for the Tate-LaBianca murders. The trial was a media sensation, with Manson’s bizarre behavior—such as carving an ""X"" into his forehead and attempting to intimidate the jury—capturing public attention. His followers, including Atkins, Krenwinkel, and Van Houten, showed no remorse for their actions.

Manson did not physically participate in the murders, but the prosecution, led by Vincent Bugliosi, successfully argued that Manson had orchestrated the killings through his influence over his followers. In January 1971, Manson and four of his followers were convicted of murder and sentenced to death. However, California's death penalty was briefly abolished in 1972, and their sentences were commuted to life in prison.

# Aftermath and Cultural Impact

The Manson Family murders signaled the end of the 1960s counterculture movement, which had been characterized by a focus on peace, love, and freedom. The violence of the murders, combined with Manson's apocalyptic rhetoric, shattered the idealistic image of the hippie movement.

The murders also had a profound impact on Hollywood. The killing of Sharon Tate, a rising star, sent shockwaves through the entertainment industry, and many celebrities became more concerned about their personal security. The idyllic image of California as a haven for artists and free spirits was forever altered by the gruesome events of August 1969.

Manson remained a notorious figure until his death in 2017. He became a symbol of evil, manipulation, and the dangers of cult-like devotion. His image, including the infamous ""X"" carved into his forehead (which he later turned into a swastika), became a dark icon in popular culture.

Books, documentaries, and films have been made about the Manson Family murders, most notably Quentin Tarantino’s *Once Upon a Time in Hollywood* (2019), which fictionalizes the events surrounding the murders. True crime enthusiasts continue to study the case, fascinated by Manson’s ability to manipulate and control his followers to commit such senseless and brutal acts.

# Conclusion

The Manson Family murders remain a chilling reminder of how a single individual can manipulate others into committing unspeakable acts of violence. Charles Manson’s ability to exploit the fears and desires of his followers, combined with his twisted vision of societal collapse, led to one of the darkest chapters in American crime history. Over fifty years later, the shock and horror of the murders still resonate, a lasting testament to the dangers of unchecked power and blind devotion.",1,1728187241.0,TrueCrimeX,0,1.0,False

**Originally posted to Ask A Manager** 

[Original Post](https://www.askamanager.org/2021/10/my-company-wants-me-to-work-halloween-and-im-a-halloween-fanatic.html)  **Oct 25, 2021** 

I’ve been at my job for six months and everything is going really well. I like the company, the work, the boss, everything is good. 

After many meetings, it was decided that a large (yearly) project is going to be processed at the end of October. We had the ability to do this during various times but heads higher than ours picked the dates. The problem here is that I’m a Halloween nut. This is the equivalent of asking Buddy the Elf to work on Christmas. I love Halloween so much that I ask during interviews if October is a busy month. I often take off the last week of October, sometimes two for Spooky Season. 

My wedding anniversary is that week (we had a Halloween wedding), I carve pumpkins, drink pumpkin beer, watch horror movies (my favorite!), and set up my house for the ultimate scare for the neighborhood children. I have a gigantic Halloween tattoo on one arm. I’ve volunteered at several haunted houses and hayrides. I’m trying to paint a picture here. It may be unusual that a woman in her 40s is this crazy over what some call a kids’ holiday (with which I completely disagree), but my point is that this is important to me and has been for a long time. 

I had previously put in for two PTO days before the dates for the project were decided. My team made the assumption that I am leaving town since I didn’t rescind the days (someone else had PTO and rescinded their days, stating they were going to be home). I’m not going away, but I also didn’t correct anyone’s thinking out of concern that they would ask me to do the same. 

The team agreed they can manage without me and I’ve volunteered to do the heavy lifting that leads up to the end of the month. I feel that I’m pulling my weight and have put in a lot of hours and effort into this project. I’ve offered to be available the Thursday and Friday that I’m off, via phone. I said I was not available on Saturday the 30th or Sunday the 31st. 

They are already talking about next year and assuming I’ll be here for the project. The problem is that I am not now nor will I EVER be available on Halloween. I understand I can’t voice it that way to my manager, but I do need to find a way (and a time) to bring this news up to her. 

I’ll work Christmas, Thanksgiving, my birthday, my husband’s birthday, whatever. My boss and I have a great relationship. We work very well together and my review is coming up. She knows I like Halloween, but I don’t know if she understands how much. 

Some may think this is a silly hill to die on and that is okay. If this becomes non-negotiable, it is something I would consider leaving a job over. We all have things that are important to us and this is one of my few deal-breakers. When I asked during the interview about October, I was told it is not as busy and that was the truth at the time. If I knew this project was going to be a yearly time-consuming October effort, I would not have taken the job. 

When would be a good time to bring this up? Obviously before October of next year. I was leaning towards waiting until after I have been here a year or at least my review. I’ve held back on saying something because I understand that it looks a little silly. Maybe there is someone out there who loves Arbor Day and wants off for that every year. I’m struggling to articulate this and appreciate any input.


[Update](https://www.askamanager.org/2022/10/update-my-company-wants-me-to-work-halloween-and-im-a-halloween-fanatic.html)  **Oct 26, 2022 (1 year later)** 

I’m happy to report that I still love the job AND … I have Halloween off this year! The same project is happening again, and it was agreed that I would do a lot of front-end work. My boss waited until today to give me the green light, but she said it was fine. I gave her the option to call me if things go haywire. 

My job is mainly remote but after I wrote in, the team started going into the office one day a week. They saw my Halloween tattoo, my pumpkin purse, my skull laptop bag, my orange, purple and green accessories. It became a running joke (one I don’t mind) about my passion for this time of year. 

Of course, I would rather have the week off, but I will take the day. Your words that stuck with me were: “We all get to have things that are important to us that don’t line up with more mainstream observances.” Thank you for that. I enjoyed reading all the comments last year regarding what days people took off for their own interests. 

My plans are to sit on my couch for a horror movie marathon, elbow deep in pumpkins and a bag of dark chocolate. There will be a cup of pumpkin spiced coffee nearby, a black cat on my lap and a fall scented candle lit. Once the sun goes down, I will rise in my Vampire costume to scare the neighborhood children. Happy Haunting!

( Tangina ng mga tao.) ,"I attended someone's wedding and I'm one of the bridesmaid. During the make-up prep, there's like 3 stylist in the room so I was the last one na inayusan. It's kinda okay at first but the way how the one doing my make up saying something like "" nagka-ilong ka naman"" or "" ano ba naman yang feslak mo nak"" and those little judgy eyes while putting foundation in my face makes me so uncomfortable. Iiling iling pa siya habang minamake-upan ako like it hurts seeing my face. It's like I've been put there to be slaughtered with words. I can barely smile na but just accepted it then nong hair na parang ayaw pa gawin or something I have a okay hair naman the others really took them long minutes. Iyong iba super style pa iyong sakin sinuklay lang ata. I ended up having so thick make-up and just normal hair. I know I shouldn't demand kasi di ko naman araw. 

 I was feeling down na after but I still smile because it's my sister's wedding. But during the rehearsal, of course, I'll greet relatives and all of them are pointing out how fat I've become or how I was like so big unlike my sister's. Sa pictures, kitang kita rin braso ko and I can't even post anything. 

The truth is, I think this is my heaviest. 70 kg and 5'3. It's not bothering like others but people around me are so unkind. I have PCOS. I have been advised to lose weight but it's really a struggle. I don't eat junk foods. I don't drink soft drinks. I don't drink alcohol. I just have some normal meals sa house. Even my coffee is black coffee kahit ayaw ko naman lasa. I consulted derma for acne but it's just so much. 

I'm not panget. I joined contest before. I was also around 50 kg lang but PCOS and tough course really didn't sit well for me. Plus, I work on the sideline pa so I only have time to survive. 

I'm doing okay naman but those words...until now they are hunting me like grabe? Ganun na ba ako kapangit? Ganun na ba ako kataba? Ganun na ba ako ka-disgusto...tignan? Some will say it's probably a wake up call pero believe me, I've tried everything but still can't lose weight. 

Mahal ko naman sarili ko e. Pero sometimes, it really just hurt. Do people really think I didn't wake up in the morning and look at myself in the mirror and realize what I look? 

So please, mind your words, your comments and if it's not something that can be fix agad agad, hayaan nalang. We already know how we look. ",2,1728187193.0,OffMyChestPH,1,1.0,False

#A Busy Day.

*In a blank and empty workplace, Jasper and a small group of employees work regularly to construct a brand new building; The Megaplayground. Jasper, being the financial manager, watches his co-workers construct the large and colorful building.*

Jasper: “Geez, BMT studios is paying high for these. We already finished building the first half, and not even 20% of the funds were depleted.”

*The others laughed.*

Gunther (upcoming): “Oh right, you’re new. Yeah, big time company. Obviously paying 10x the amount they need to build a GIANT playground. They care about quality over cash, y’know?”

Sarah (upcoming): “That’s what makes them a popularly great company.”

Jasper: “Well I’m glad I took this job. It was either having a desk job or financially advising a project.”

*Jasper shrugged off his distractions and remained diligent, as he continued his duties of checking the quality of the materials and calculating the total cost of the project.*

Jasper: “Smooth sailing.”

*After some vigorous and strenuous hours of work, they took their lunch break. Jasper brought in a simple but delicious sandwich, along with a bag of grapes and his average cup of coffee. He  grabbed his drink and sipped it, sighing of relief after.*

Jasper: “This should be our last break, and an hour later, we can return home.”

Gunther (upcoming): “You know it! Man, BMT is great.”

*They all chatted together, keeping a comfy and familiar atmosphere as the workers shared some good laughs and gossips about a* **recent accident…?**
*As the sun sets, their break was finished, as they return to working hard.*

Jasper: “We got an hour left.”

*The others nod as they do their jobs. Some of them build, graph, plan, design, discuss, or bring in materials, keeping a functioning and efficient work environment.*

*Just as Jasper’s watch strikes at 10PM, he sets up his megaphone.*

Jasper: *On the megaphone,* “Shift’s over! Let’s go home now!”

*His co-workers all stop what they’re doing and returned home, but Jasper had remembered their gossip just as he leaves last…* **an accident..? What could have that possibly be..?**

one example of myself blossoming is i’m finally accepting that i’m bisexual. i knew it for a while but i repressed it because of my home environment (conservative christian household and i moved out at age 24). 

so recently i started to put myself out there on dating apps. on tinder i met a cute and handsome 23M. we eventually decide to meet for coffee a week ago. it went great. we talked for a couple of hours, we had a lot in common, and went for a quick trip to spirit halloween. we both agreed to a second date soon. 

i still haven’t come out to anyone i know. my two best friends would obv accept me in a heartbeat. my sisters would too. i think my mom would too, but my dad and brothers wouldn’t. the last time i was over for lunch they openly made fun of LGBTQ+ people. i really want to wait until we start dating before coming out as bi, perhaps because i don’t see a reason for coming out unless i have someone to come out for? some advice there would be nice because this is new to me. the 23M is openly queer btw. 

but right now i’m really hoping we do start dating so i can come out. i do want to come out, but i’m thinking it’s not important for people to know unless i have a boyfriend.

Looking for suggestions for larger groups to hang out and catch up, and/or maybe get a meal.

I feel like managing/finding space for large groups is kind of a headache (I'd originally proposed we just go to a park and do a picnic, but for various reasons that won't work out anymore), so I am thinking our best bet would be to find a beer garden type place since I feel like those usually have big tables and can fit larger groups. So far I have: Other Half Brewery in Williamsburg, Talea in Greenpoint, and Franklin Park in Crown Heights (not a brewery but similar concept). Any other suggestions?

And if we do decide to do a 10 to 12-person dinner (god help us), any recs for good places that can accommodate larger groups?

Thank you!! And to pay it forward, here are a couple places I've gone to and loved in my stretch of Brooklyn (alas, none great for large groups):

\*Bomberino -- little Italian cafe bar in PLG with amazing pastries and coffee in the AM, and aperitivo (Italian wine/cocktails & snacks) in the evenings!  
\*Ursula -- New Mexican food in BedStuy, best known for their breakfast burritos, but also have really great dinner  
\*Cruz del Sur -- Mexican spot in Crown Heights, get the jicama salad and the Chicharron Quesadilla

She would beat my husband with slapping, punching, kicking and would say anything she could to hurt him the most and she cheated on him constantly.

Crazy enough she was the one to leave him. She left him for the newest guy she had been cheating on him with. Shortly after the split I came into the picture.

They proceeded to tell us how BM and her stupid boyfriend have been hurting the SKs and the youngest (4yo) had a cut. 

We called CPS and got temporary full custody of the SKs.

This is the first time I’ve been single for five years. I’ve only been with two people in my life. I’m a 24 year old woman. And now that I’m falling in the pits of this dating hellhole, it literally is terrifying. I feel like no one takes anyone seriously and everyone’s just trying to fuck around? I am not the type to hook up with random people or someone I barely know. I don’t even want to have sex unless we are in a committed relationship. I don’t drink, party, smoke, and I much prefer to read a good book and go for a nice walk. Is it because I have the mentality of my 90 year old grandmother? Am I fucked because I want true romance in a modern world? I legitimately don’t know how people are dating now. I feel like I can’t even meet someone since I don’t go to clubs. Im an outdoorsy person, I go hiking, running, walking, and venture coffee shops and bookstores. I see good looking men but no one ever approaches me or asks for my number. I think all the books and movies I’ve watched have given me this false narrative of what I hoped for now that I’m single. And no I am not ugly, I am attractive by societies standards. Are people scared to talk to the opposite sex?? I guess I shouldn’t say that because I wouldn’t approach a guy first.. should I? Help lol ",0,1728186124.0,dating_advice,9,0.17,False

I told him I couldn't do anything about it since I'm just an associate, but he insisted that he'd get the $1 discount he was entitled to, and was willing to wait an undisclosed amount of time to wait for my team lead to tell him the same thing I did. He was holding up the line and his dedication was obnoxious to me, so I just took $1 off the *item* and that did it. He proceeded to call me a ""good man"" (was I a good man to you earlier when I wasn't letting you have it your way you fool) and left happy unfortunately.

A couple hours later I was at the register (a send from heaven), and the first guy I wrung up had a discounted coffee mix thingy. Even though the original barcode was partly covered with the new barcode AND SHARPY the register managed by a one in a million chance to scan the original. It was just two and a half dollars, surely he won't 
He got annoyed. He had to get his two and a half dollars off. He was just as willing to hold up a long line just to have it his way as the other guy, and I had to use one of my coworkers' time to abort the transaction (thank goodness that was the first scan or the mood would've been even worse than it was). 

So if you are like this and have managed to read this far despite my unflattering language towards your kind, why are you stingy towards prices? Ik I don't know everyone's story, but those two seemed like they were very much well off enough to spend the dollar or two to make the process easier not just for me, but for the half dozen people behind you that wanna go home, are on a tight schedule, or are just having a bad day. If you are actually having a rough time financially I understand, but for those that aren't I will never understand you.

Btw I like my job, especially when I'm not in self checkout, but there's just some uncontrollable factors (lame customers) that make my job that more sour. ",2,1728185467.0,walmart,0,1.0,False

I am divorced with two really delightful kids, 10 and 14. They already have a dad (who I share custody with), so I'm all set on that front, but if you hate kids, I'm not your gal. If you have kids, too, that's a plus!

I'm well-established in my career and I own a house and a car and blah blah, adulty responsible things are happening over here.

My passions in life are reading and writing. I'd love to be able to share these interests with my partner. Nothing would please my nerdy romantic heart than to sit on a porch with my love reading and then pausing to discuss what we're reading and then reading some more and then making out a little and then getting distracted by a squirrel. Peak life.

I love reading and writing; A24 movies; exploring mountains and forests but not in a serious hiker way, more like an unleashed toddler who wants to hunt for cool bugs; that's what she said jokes; playing Scrabble; drinking a lot of coffee; going to museums and bookstores and coffee shops and hole-in-the-wall restaurants.

My ideal relationship consists of lots of banter, flirting, emotional intimacy, loyalty, support, and a foundation of friendship. I want to text all day about what you're eating and what you're thinking and what the sky looks like from your window. I want to roast you about your weird habits and you like it because you know I adore you. I'm fine with a long distance relationship, but I would want us to visit each other.

I don't care about your height, looks, race, etc. Just be funny and smart and kind. I'm politically liberal, although not dogmatic about it--but if you're MAGAy, we're not a good match.

I have been watching a show about a woman who is stuck in a horrible fate that will be repeated unless she passes her fate on to someone else. Nothing prompted me to watch the show I just randomly found it. After the first two episodes of watching I felt sick to my stomach when I realized what the show was about. For days afterwards I tried to think about why I would feel so sick to my stomach about a concept like that because what does it have to do with me. Then a thought popped in my head “it’s just like you” and I felt a chill and I thought no it’s not the women and situation are nothing like me that’s not why it’s bothering me. And then I thought “yeah but you are stuck and if you don’t stop soon you’ll stay that way”. It was like someone else thought the thought for me and put it in my brain. Then I looked across the table and a stupid coffee cup my sister got had a little tiny hand drawn black heart that’s a symbol in the show for a person who basically gives the women a chance to get out of her fate. I had never noticed it or thought about it before. Then I thought okay I am just having anxiety and I am having a weird moment I need to stop being absurd. But since that moment 4 days ago I’ve had this horrible sick foreboding feeling, it’s like it’s gnawing at the back of my brain and it won’t go away. I know I sound mentally unwell or whatever. But I have never felt anything like this before. It’s making me so sick to my stomach that it’s all I can think about. I am not sure what kind of advice, help, or answer I am looking for.

1fx7ll7,https://www.reddit.com/r/digimarketeronline/comments/1fx7ll7/how_do_you_think_social_media_and_ooh_advertising/,How do you think social media and OOH advertising can be better integrated for a seamless campaign experience?,"Integrating social media and out-of-home (OOH) advertising can create a cohesive, seamless campaign that enhances reach, engagement, and brand recognition across both physical and digital environments. To achieve this, brands can leverage each medium's strengths and use consistent messaging and visuals. Here's how the integration can be optimized: (If you are looking for more conversions using AI then check this tool by clicking the DigiProducts link in my bio)

### 1. Unified Creative Strategy

* **Consistent branding**: The first step in integrating OOH and social media is ensuring the creative elements—such as colors, fonts, logos, and messaging—remain consistent across platforms. This uniformity reinforces brand identity and makes the campaign easily recognizable, whether a consumer sees it on a billboard or in their social feed.
* **Complementary messaging**: While messaging should be consistent, it should also be adapted to suit the strengths of each platform. OOH, which is designed for quick, impactful messages, can introduce or reinforce a campaign, while social media can dive deeper with interactive content, detailed storytelling, and user engagement.

### 2. Use of QR Codes and NFC Technology

* **QR codes** on billboards, bus shelters, or other OOH formats can act as a bridge between the physical and digital world. When scanned, these codes can lead viewers to social media platforms, special promotions, or a landing page that enhances the OOH message. This turns passive viewers into active participants in the campaign.
* **NFC (Near Field Communication)** technology can also be embedded into OOH ads, enabling people with smartphones to tap or scan an area on the ad to receive digital content directly onto their phones.

### 3. Hashtag Campaigns

* **Hashtags** displayed prominently on OOH advertisements can drive social media conversations. When people see an OOH ad that encourages them to use a hashtag on platforms like Instagram, X (formerly Twitter), or TikTok, it links the offline experience to a larger digital campaign, encouraging user-generated content and boosting organic reach.
* This creates a **feedback loop** where social media engagement is amplified by OOH, and vice versa, creating multiple touchpoints for consumers to interact with the brand.

### 4. Geo-Targeting and Contextual Ads

* **Geo-targeted social media ads** can work alongside OOH by targeting users in the vicinity of a physical ad. For example, a digital billboard at a bus stop can be reinforced by delivering location-specific ads to users' phones in real-time, allowing the campaign to maintain visibility even after consumers leave the physical location.
* **Contextual advertising**: Using weather, time of day, or location-based data, brands can tailor their social media and OOH content to reflect current conditions or local events. For example, a coffee brand might show a weather-triggered digital billboard for hot drinks on a cold day, while simultaneously running a social media promotion for coffee lovers in that area.

### 5. Interactive OOH Ads Paired with Social Media Engagement

* **Interactive billboards** (such as those with touchscreens or digital displays) can enhance the connection between OOH and social media. For example, users can participate in polls, contests, or games on a digital OOH ad, then be directed to social platforms for further interaction or to redeem prizes.
* **Social media amplification**: Companies can encourage viewers of interactive OOH ads to share their experiences on social media, tagging the brand or using a specific campaign hashtag. This extends the campaign’s reach and increases user engagement.

### 6. Live Updates and User-Generated Content in OOH

* **User-generated content (UGC)**: Social media posts or images that feature a specific hashtag can be dynamically displayed on OOH digital billboards. This method encourages more people to engage with the campaign on social media for a chance to be featured in the physical space.
* **Real-time social updates**: Live social media feeds, such as tweets or Instagram stories, can be displayed on digital OOH formats, creating a sense of immediacy and engagement. This also helps connect social media followers with an in-person experience, making the campaign feel more integrated.

### 7. Retargeting and Cross-Platform Measurement

* **Retargeting**: Brands can track the users who have engaged with their OOH campaigns through mobile location data and then retarget them with personalized ads on social media. For example, if someone passed by an OOH ad for a movie, they could be retargeted with the movie’s trailer or special promotions on Instagram or Facebook.
* **Cross-platform measurement**: Tools like mobile location data and advanced analytics platforms can help measure the effectiveness of both OOH and social media ads. Marketers can track how exposure to an OOH ad influences online engagement and conversions, providing a clearer picture of how the two mediums complement each other.

### 8. Influencer Collaborations

* **Influencer campaigns**: Social media influencers can be involved in OOH campaigns to bridge the gap between digital and physical spaces. Influencers could promote OOH ads they’ve been featured in, encouraging their followers to spot the ads in the real world and share them online. This creates buzz and drives traffic across both mediums.

### 9. Sequential Storytelling Across Channels

* Brands can use OOH as the **initial touchpoint** to introduce a campaign, followed by deeper storytelling on social media. For instance, a billboard might tease a new product, while social media channels provide more detailed content, such as behind-the-scenes videos, influencer reviews, or community engagement.

### Conclusion:

To seamlessly integrate social media and OOH advertising, brands must focus on creating **consistent, complementary messaging** while leveraging the strengths of both mediums. By using **interactive features**, **geo-targeting**, and **cross-platform engagement**, companies can craft campaigns that move fluidly between physical and digital spaces, boosting consumer engagement and brand visibility. This integrated approach not only maximizes the reach of the campaign but also enhances consumer experiences across platforms.",1,1728185419.0,digimarketeronline,0,1.0,False

for example, let's take a simple regular sized coffee. in my opinion, a black coffee should never cost more than 3 dollars MAYBE 3.50. however, coffee is actually usually 6 dollars. no sugar. no cream. nothing.

moreover, say you're at Target to get a new pair of work pants (personal experience) and are hoping to find something cheap. you'll pick up a pair that are comfortable and are functional, then you check the price tag and they're $26-35. 

i always think about this now when i'm buying things and suffer a bit more every day. don't even get me started on fast food and how expensive *that* is these days. ",2,1728185372.0,RandomThoughts,1,1.0,False

Once you figure out what resonates with you deeply you feel highly attuned with this mode of being. It becomes difficult to stomach others who don’t operate this way. It becomes this whole thing where you feel like introducing this shiny bright new thing to people so they can understand what you feel. I understand what it’s like floating through crowds mindlessly. 

I feel like I’m in some sort of transitory phase right now. You can value introspection and look for a community of people who follow what you believe and want to dig deeper into it. Or maybe you value friendships more and you want to get on everyone’s good sides connecting over a few things giving them the wrong idea. You maybe have a shared interest of drinking and talking shit and for them that’s their entire mode of operating but for you that was only one small aspect. 

In the end I don’t think I’m built for close relationships with a good chunk of people and I have been called transactional. I don’t think that these people fully understood me and I don’t know if I understand fully why I was called this myself. All of that being said I think a lot of friendships are a means to an end and they should be called what it is. 

If I’m fond of certain life philosophies like say I’m a vegan, I’m not but I’d understand why someone would be. I’m just saying that it would make perfect sense for someone who’s a vegan to entirely avoid people who don’t follow that path. In the end I respect devotion to the path and I think passion is what makes things go forward. Cutting people off who don’t follow your modus operandi is a good way to stay devoted to your craft.

I think burning bridges is good for the soul. When you have these big ideas that you want to implement to a greater community you have to make sacrifices. You have to cut down on all the meaningless arguments because you will have those constantly. A lot of arguments are circular and you won’t have the ability to affect one person at a time. 

What you have to do is talk about your beliefs to a greater population. I guess this is what I find enjoyable about social media. I think the ability to speak within a community is something that should never be taken for granted. It’s an amazing ability to speak to so many likeminded people at once with similar goals. You can communicate to people who have similar goals and gain the tools to argue and educate better with people who may not understand.

1fx7f93,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_Frosty_Incident666/comments/1fx7f93/oc_fuss_jyx/,[OC] FUSS [jyx] ,"Jane woke up in a somewhat spacious room within the house the strange abductors had assigned her. She hadn't seen such a building in her entire life. Back on Terra, cement ruled the building industry, as it was cheap and easy to build with. Especially given the technology they had, which allowed them to build a new skyscraper in a few days. 

No...this was something entirely different. No house on the planet was taller than three stories, all of them constructed in a similar manner. A framework of wood held them, and in between were panels of some other material. Still, Jane found it most comfortable. Some houses, which looked more like she was used to, were actually temporary habitats. Especially the air on the planet was much nicer than back on Terra. Surely, her home planet *had* been made habitable again. Neither did this mean it's inhabitants wouldn't repeat the same mistake, nor did it mean it was an easy existence. The city she had lived in before moving into the underground laboratory didn't exactly have the purest of air.

Being tired from the whole ordeal she hadn't really spoken too much to the planets inhabitants, but they seemed quite nice. The first thing they did when seeing her was to do a small toast and offer her some coffee. She declined, given that her head still hurt, and decided to go to sleep. Tay had shown her to her new home, enthusiastic about giving her a tour of the place, but she asked to do it some other time. After all, she wanted to sleep. 

A quick glance around the bedroom didn't give for much more than a table, a chair, her bed of course and a mirror. She was used to looking tired, but not used to looking *wounded*. The smell of food caught her attention, which she decided to follow. 

Tay had been preparing her some breakfast. The kitchen itself seemed well thought out, an island in the middle, the cupboards at just the right height. ""They...they did their own research before grabbing you"" Tay smiled, offering her to sit down at a simple table, big enough for eight people. ""I hope you don't mind that I've been in your house, but they did ask me to keep an eye on you. *That* and all..."" he said, pointing towards her head. 

""I don't really mind"" Jane answered as the man served her the food. Eggs, some kind of vegetable she didn't know and some meat. ""What is this?"" she asked.

""Grrrroooakk meat, eggs and a Ztarara"" Tay answered, ""it's good. Although you probably never had it before. The meat is from *Hell's Retreat,* my home. The eggs are from here. You know how difficult it was to acquire living chickens that *weren't* pumped full of growth hormones? Anyways, that there is a Ztarara. Imagine a potato that somebody crossed with a lemon. It's a staple food of a species we also have on *Hell's Retreat*. Turns out those bugs do have some quite tasty food"". 

Jane didn't know what to make of this information. Nevertheless, she *was* hungry and thirsty. ""Is...is that orange juice?"" she noticed.

""Yep. Also from *Hell's Retreat*"" Tay replied, ""we get most of our sustenance from there. It was quite dark yesterday when you came, but you'll notice a severe lack of tall trees here. That's for the simple fact that the inhabitants of this planets made a barren world livable...it takes time for things to establish you know?""

Having finished her breakfast, which was unusual yet edible, the man showed her around. The house was mostly empty, but the amount of space she'd have astonished her. ""If you need something, like drawers, cabinets or whatever, just ask around. The people here would be more than willing to help you"". 

""I don't have my wallet with me..."" she began.

""Oh no no no no no"" Tay reigned her in, ""not necessary"". 

They went outside. There was grass on the ground, but the man was telling the truth: All the trees they had were quite small. Nothing like the few parks back on Terra. A particular smell entered her nose, emanating from a flower field. ""What...what is that?"" she asked.

""That's their hemp fields"" Tay answered, ""they grow it for clothes...and *other purposes*"". A lengthy explanation of all the ways in which the plants could be used followed. ""That reminds me, we have to get you to a tailor. Your clothes are all torn! This won't do at all!"" he pointed out, signaling her to come along.

On their way to said tailor Jane noticed that Tay would greet and be greeted by everybody they met. Yes, they even greeted *her,* a woman they knew little about. Sometimes Tay would get caught up in some chit-chat with the locals. 

The tailor, a friend of Tay, mustered Jane. ""You're right. That won't do at all!"" the old lady viewed her, taking her measurements. ""I'll sew you something up. Meanwhile...this should *somewhat* fit you?""

""You ought to see the museum"" Tay told her, ""they have their original ship in there. Don't use it anymore, it's voyage has come to an end. But fascinating. I couldn't survive on a ship like that, I tell you! And that was considered *luxurious* at the time!"". The pair made their way to a round structure that reminded Jane of a part of female anatomy. 

""Now before we go in, they've flooded the place with inert gas"" Tay explained to her, ""so we'll have to suit up. I don't find the suits the most comfortable, but I do find breathing comfortable"". Thus, he pointed her towards the changing rooms. 

As they entered the dome Jane became more and more astonished. ""They *went through space* in that thing?"" she finally asked. There was a significant amount of patchwork on the ship. Well, two ships really. It seemed they had been welded together. 

""They did"" Tay assured her, ""for a long time. And that ship back there, that's from the people they want you to bring back. Rakke explained it to me yesterday, after you went to sleep. Want to look inside?"".

The ship was archaic. Technology had gone a long way. 

""Why are there ... names, I guess? Scratched into that panel?"" Jane inquired.

""That'd be the original wall. Every time somebody died they'd put them there"" Tay explained, ""Oh...right...you don't do that were you're from?"".

""We kind of do"" Jane answered, ""but everybody gets their own piece of wall. We call it a tombstone"". 

They moved on to the second ship. There was a block of *something* inside, slightly damaged and very opaque. *Mother* had been engraved on top of it. 

""And that's who they want you to bring back. Well, not her exactly, but her species. She was called *Shrrrebit*"" Tay disclosed, ""one of those they call *Squishies*"". 

Going outside Jane noticed a relief in the dome. It seemed to tell the story of the two ships meeting, and the two species interacting. Towards the end of the graphical story, less and less of the aliens were shown...Tay took her to a giant slab of stone near the museum. ""That's the new wall"" he revealed, ""everybody from that ship of theirs who dies is memorized there"". They went back towards her house.

""Are all streets here named like this?"" Jane eventually asked. *Horizontal street 84, Vertical street 43, Diagonal street 13* were some of the names she had read. 

Tay nodded. ""Well...they'll get new names soon enough I think? They were too preoccupied with making this damn planet into what it is today to be thinking about names"". 

Back at the house Jane sat down as Tay made some more refreshments. His communication device notified him of something. ""Yes? Oh, it's you? No I'm not busy? No I don't think Rakke is either. Süpö? Nah, that ones busy. You're coming over? Can you bring a *standard Terran compliment?* No, no. Female. Yeah. See you soon."". 

Not too long after, Jane heard a knock on the door. She opened it, confused to find a Rakhar in clothing not dissimilar from Tays. ""Tythor!"" Tay exclaimed, ""It's been too long! You've gotten better?"".

""Yes...curse that slimy Jyx. I tell you, Süpö had planned *that* from the start. Ah, you must be their new guest? Pleasure. I'm Tythor. Independent trader. And *Person of the year* as rewarded by *Femme Interstellar* yesterday for some reason. I don't even read that magazine. Why would I? Anyways, here, I brought you a small moving in gift"" the alien gestured towards a hand-cart behind it. 

""Some varieties of soap, shampoo and conditioner. A sufficient amount of tscho-ko-lad. These cotton-string things. Wine. Body lotion. Medicine of various sort. A towel - I read in a guide once you should never go on voyages through space without one. It's ... fluffy! Some stationary. A bundle of flowers. Various cheeses. Almost impossible to get through certain customs....a bathrobe...And of course some coffee. Alongside with some other stuff"" Tythor listed what he had brought, ""free of charge. A friend of Tay, or Rakke, is a friend of mine"". It sat down at the table, producing a cup that ... seemed to fill itself. 

""I'm telling you Tay, those ship inspectors don't know what they're doing. I just had another one faint in the engineering bay"" Tythor continued the chat.

""You worried it won't pass?"" Tay inquired, still preparing food. 

""Nah. First of all, they won't be able to figure it out. Second, I bribed the harbor master. Third, Terran military would be really angry if it failed inspection - considering I'm one of their main providers of highly-caffeinated beverages"" Tythor dismissed. 

Another knock on the door. It was the man in the pink suit, but this time in ... more normal clothing. He was accompanied by a small girl, which he quickly offloaded onto Tay before going again.

""*Axolotl*!"" the child screamed upon seeing Tythor, who sighed. The Terran child had gotten bigger and went immediately to hug the alien, who produced some sweets from who-knows-where.

""I have to ask"" Jane started when they had all sat down to eat, ""I've counted seventeen distinct species participating in that...raid...but I mostly see humans here?""

""Oh...that's because most species prefer other environments"" Tythor answered, ""They have an ocean planet here too, you know? For the Jyx. And some other planets as well. Most of the environments required are covered. And those who don't have suitable environments, they just live up there, in orbit. Those were seventeen of the more resilient species...they could survive here, yes, but they'd really rather not"". 

Tay left to run some errands, taking the girl with him. 

""So you're a trader?"" Jane asked Tythor, ""I was told that basically all of your species are, and I quote, *bureaucrats with sticks up their cloacas where their spine should be*"". Tythor didn't seem at all insulted by this. 

""That, sadly, is a fitting description for most of my species"" he answered, ""believe me, I should know. I used to work for the Galactic Senate. Can't do anything there, really...anyways, what do you think of the Theseus? Nice people, are they not?""

""They literally abducted me? I was afraid they'd do some *probing*"" Jane replied somewhat sarcastically. ""The people here do seem nice, but ... did they really have to pick me up *like that*? It was quite a shock!""

""Oh no, nobody does any *probing* around here. Except for Rakke. I'm certain that one does. And yes, it was necessary. Don't you keep up with the news?"" Tythor inquired.

""I tried to, but where I worked at the news from the outside was strictly controlled and monitored"" Jane answered, ""I have no idea what's going on in the wider galaxy. Or on my own planet. Only something about some of our machines malfunctioning?""

""Oh boy..."" Tythor sighed, ""we'll be here for quite some time then. Coffee?"".

1fx7f62,https://www.reddit.com/r/superautomatic/comments/1fx7f62/kitchenaid_kf8_vs_bosch_verocafe_800/,Kitchenaid KF8 vs. Bosch VeroCafe 800,"First, this is just my opinion and it's very subjective. Don't take my review as what you should buy. Make sure you do your own due diligence before making your purchase. While i might love something, the next person might hate it or have had a different experience than me.

I had both machines in my house and had to make a choice of which one to keep. I have been using the Bosch VeroCafe 800 for longer but when Bloomingdales ran a sale on the KF8 for $1,799 plus an additional 20% off of that, it put the KF8 at the same price that I paid for the Bosch on sale. A little over $1,400 before tax for each.

Let's get the obvious out of the way first. If you want to switch between beans or maybe have a decaf coffee here or there, the Bosch is not your machine. It does not even offer a bypass chute for ground coffee. I knew that going in but more on that in a minute on why that mattered after a while. The KF8 not only offers a bypass chute for ground coffee, but it offers you the ability to swap hoppers with different beans. 

I am fine drinking regular coffee at night, but it keeps my wife up. She usually doesn't drink regular coffee once it hits the afternoon/nighttime but since getting the Bosch 800, she has really been enjoying the drinks, so much that she has been drinking regular coffee way more at night than ever. When I saw the Kitchenaid KF8 on sale, I jumped at the opportunity to try it. I was holding off from trying the KF7 as I noticed the KF8 offers five strength settings, and the KF7 offers three. I have not been able to find any actual evidence if the KF8 offers a higher dose over the KF7 or if the additional settings just offer more steps in between. The answer is not available anywhere, but when I purchased the KF8, it was cheaper than the KF7, which was also on sale. So take into account the price I paid for these machines. I was not willing to pay $2K for any machine. I wanted to keep my budget at around $1,500.

Now, let's get into some of what the machines offer. The KF8 says it has around 40 drink recipes, but that is not really true. They count making the same drink, one with cows milk and one with plant based milk as two drinks. That is very misleading. A cappuccino is a cappuccino no matter what milk you use. It's one drink! The Bosch VeraCafe 800 offers something like 36 drinks with the lowest model offering 1 less as it removes the full pot option. The drink recipes on the Bosch are fantastic. There is more than you can imagine. It also offers a cold brew drink, but to be honest, it's not great. It tastes underextracted and underwhelming. When extracting coffee with cooler water, it really needs to soak in it for a long time to really get the flavors out. It's why real cold brew takes 12-14 hours to make. Making an Iced Latte with hot espresso or an Iced Americano is way better choices for cold drinks and can be made on either machine as both drinks are brewed hot.

Milk foam quality is very identical between the two machines, and it's really good! I'll post a picture in the comments that you can see it side by side. I've only used 2% cows milk with both machines. One thing is certain, when making a drink on the KF8 with frothed milk, it is noticeabley hotter than the Bosch. If it's a drink with warm milk, they are more even as far as the temp is concerned. Also, if you are testing the KF8 for its milk froth, you need to understand the drink you are brewing. If you brew a flat white on the KF8, you are not going to get foam as a flat white should not have any. It's more of a creamy milk texture, and the KF8 pulls it off nicely. Same with a cafe latte. You won't get foam from that drink. If you want foam, do a cappuccino or a Latte Mocciato, but both machines do a nice job of microfoam.

The KF8 allows you to choose milk or coffee first, no matter which drink. The Bosch only lets you set it for a cappuccino and latte macchiato in the main settings menu. Both machines allow you to make a dual drink or put one cup under it for a larger drunk. The Bosch offers a little more clearance room for a cup than the KA. Also, you can move the grate on the drip tray and fit a larger mug under the Bosch. You can't really do this with the KA.

The Bosch offers larger size single drinks over the KA. You can do a single serving 11.3oz Latte Mocciato with a single shot or a double shot to make it stronger. For drink size on the Bosch, you only set the overall size of the drink. On the KA, you set the milk quantity and also the coffee qty. The highest milk qty you can choose is 6.4oz, I think. Then, you would set the correct ratio of coffee depending on the drink you want to make. If you want to make a bigger drink, you need to choose the double drink. You can't make a single drink larger with a single shot. So you might do a cappuccino with 5.0oz of milk, 1.2oz of coffee and choose double. So what it does is pull two shots in a row, equating 2.4oz of coffee, and then it will pull 10oz of milk.

Warm milk temp on each measure around 120° f while streamed milk measures 120° f on the Bosch and 135° f on the KA. This is cold milk from the fridge in a cold cup.

Sound on both seems pretty similar. They are not super loud, but they are not silent either. The KA feels a little more premium. Drip tray and puck tray seem larger on the KA, too. The machine just feels a little more substantial, and it's also larger.

So which one are we keeping? After a lot of side by side tests and also some blind taste tests with my wife, she was choosing the KA as the better drink. It was a little more coffee forward than the Bosch but some drinks tasted so similar between the two. I think the black drip coffee tastes better on the Boach, but I think I need to play around with the settings on the KA to get a good cup of Bkack coffee.

The Bosch is wifi compatible, and the app is great.  The machine can get software updates, but that will only matter if they actually push any updates. The KF8 doesn't have any app or wifi connection.

Bottom line, both machines are great and have their advantages and disadvantages.

This Texas chili recipe is authentic, meaty, just the right amount of spicy, and not a chili bean in sight. Learn how to make your own Texas chili.

The Best Texas Chili Recipe

The first time I had Texas chili was, shockingly, down in Texas. I was in the middle of my military training and they let me off base. I'd never tried it, so grabbed a bowl at a local restaurant and...

BOOM! Eyes opened! Talk about flavor.

I've been making a version of that exact bowl ever since. Please note that I am NOT a Texas chili purist. There are different ways to make true Texas chili, but this is how I like to make my recipe for Texas chili - with big chunks of beef, lots of pureed chilies and spices, and no beans.
You’ll find argument after argument about what exactly makes up Texas style chili, and as with any recipe, the ingredients and preparation varies from cook to cook.

See my Recipe Variations notes below on this.

The main thing that practically everyone agrees on, however, is that Texas chili has no beans! This is very important. You don’t put beans in Texas chili. See my further notes on that below as well.

Let’s talk about how to make Texas chili, shall we?

How to Make Texas Chili – the Recipe Method

Start your chili paste first by lightly toasting the dried peppers in a dry pan about a minute or 2 per side. This will help to release the oils.

Remove from heat and cool enough to handle. Remove the stems and pour out the seeds.

Soak the peppers in hot water for 20 minutes, or until they are nice and soft.

Add them to a food processor with 1/2 to 1 cup of the soaking water and a bit of salt to taste. Process until nice and smooth. Set aside for now.

Add the cubed beef to a large bowl and toss with the cumin and a bit of salt and pepper. Make sure everything is nice and coated.

Heat 1 tablespoon oil in a large pot or large Dutch oven over medium high heat and add the beef. Cook 6-7 minutes, searing the beef all over.

Remove the beef and set aside.
Add the remaining olive oil along with the jalapenos, serranos and onion. Cook them down about 5 minutes.

Add the garlic and stir. Cook another minute.

Pour in the reserved chili paste and stir. Cook it for 2-3 minutes to let the flavor develop a bit.

Stir in the beef broth (or beer), 2 cups of water, brown sugar, Worcestershire, and masa and bring to a quick boil. If you are using the optional additions (see my NOTES below), add them in now.

Reduce the heat, cover and simmer for about 2 hours, or until the meat is tender. It could take longer if you are using tougher cuts of beef (see NOTES above). Give it a stir once every 30 minutes or so.

NOTE: You could also transfer everything to a slow cooker or Instant Pot and let it cook low and slow. I usually use my Dutch oven.

The chili will thicken up nicely as it simmers.

If it becomes too thick, add in a ¼ cup of water and stir. If it is too thin, thicken with more masa.

Serve with your favorite fixins! Get ready for an awesome ""bowl o red""!

Now, I'm sure you have questions. Or comments. Let's move onto the overall Texas Chili discussion, shall we?

Does Texas Chili Have Beans?

NO! Texas chili does NOT have beans.

However, as with any cook, you are the one making the recipe, so if you'd like to include BEANS in your Texas chili, go for it. Use just about any bean - kidney beans, black beans, several white bean varieties work nicely.

If you choose to include beans, though, be prepared for your Texas friends to tell you, vehemently, that it is NOT officially Texas chili. I'm sure you'll be okay with that.

What Makes Texas Chili Different from Other Chilis?

Texas chili is unique from other chilis in that it does not contain beans or tomato sauce, or any tomato product. It is made primarily of meat and a thick and flavor chili paste made from dried peppers. It is more akin to a thick and hearty beef stew that most chilis with a focus on chili pepper flavor. Because of the reddish color from the chili, it is also known as Texas Red Chili or Cowboy Chili.

About the Dried Peppers

I used a combination of three different dried peppers - ancho, pasilla, and New Mexican peppers.

The ancho pepper is the dried form of the poblano chili pepper. It has a mild paprika flavor, with sweet to moderate heat.

Pasilla peppers offer a rich smoky flavor. They're often used as a powder in Mexican salsas as well as in mole and adobo sauces, though they make a wonderful addition to not only Texas chili, but any style of chili.

The New Mexican peppers are earthy and a little sweet. Together, they build the delectable chili paste that makes this Texas chili recipe truly authentic.

You can easily use other dried pods to form your flavor base, or try it with only a single pepper. I've made some chili recipes with only pasilla peppers and with only ancho peppers, and was not disappointed.

About the Fresh Peppers
I used both jalapeno peppers and serrano peppers for both flavor and heat. They break down nicely as you cook them up, and they're readily available.

Other peppers that would work very nicely here include the Anaheim pepper, cubanelle pepper, or the poblano.

Hatch chili peppers would be outstanding in a Texas chili, in my opinion. If you're looking to introduce a nice level of heat, bring in a habanero or two.

Either work with them from fresh, or roast them for a more robust flavor. Feel free to experiment.

Choices of Beef

Chuck roast is always a popular option for Texas chili because it is a tougher meat that benefits greatly from the low and slow cooking process. I prefer beef chuck. All of that tough connective tissue breaks down and it becomes wonderfully tender and flavorful.

You can use any stew meat for this particular recipe.

I've enjoyed some Texas chilis with ground beef, and found them delicious, but it just isn't the same in terms of taste and consistency. But if you're in a bind, I say go for it. Better to have chili than NO chili.

It is still quite delicious.

Additional Ingredients and Recipe Variations

As mentioned, there are other ways to make Texas chili, and the recipe will vary from cook to cook. The largest variations I see involve the use of seasonings.

I rely mostly on the peppers, the meat, and a few simple seasonings to make my outstanding Texas chili (if I do say so myself!), but other ingredients I've encountered with other Texas chili recipes include:
* Coriander
* Mexican oregano
* Hot chili powder or flakes (Yes!)
* Vinegar (1-2 tablespoons usually)
* Chocolate or cocoa powder
* Coffee
* Beer (used instead of broth, or both - I've done this and love it)
* Worcestershire sauce
* Brown sugar/sugar
* Tomato paste/sauce/diced tomatoes/crushed tomatoes (usually a typical can or so)
* Masa Harina (as a thickener)

Note that I did not list BEANS among those ingredients.

How Long Does it Take to Make Texas Chili

Once you've got your pot of Texas chili simmering, it will take a least a good two hours of simmering time for the meats to break down, depending on the type of meat you are using. The key is to let the flavor develop, and for the tough connective tissues (collagen) to break down and become tender.

I've had some of my chilis take nearly 4 hours for it to get to where I wanted it, flavor-wise. Just keep tasting and testing.

If your chili becomes too thick from the simmering process and it still needs developing time, just add a bit of water here and there, about a quarter cup or so at a time, as needed.

Speaking of flavor and simmering time...

Try it the Next Day

Texas chili is GREAT right off the bat, but you can develop even MORE flavor by cooling it and setting it into the refrigerator, covered. Leave it overnight, then reheat it the next day.
It is even better this way.

Serving Up Your Texas Chili

I don't see any real RULES here when serving up Texas chili. Serve it up with whatever fixings you prefer. Fritos are fun and crunchy (Frito pie, anyone?), as are crispy tortillas, but go for the regulars like diced onion, spicy chopped peppers, chili flakes, fresh chopped herbs, limes, crema or sour cream, shredded cheese and more.

Storage Info. How Long Does Texas Chili Last in the Fridge?

Properly sealed in a container with a tight lid, chili should last a week in the refrigerator. If you'd like to keep your chili longer, it is best to freeze it in proper freezer containers. That way your chili will last a good 6 months.

That's it, my friends! I hope you enjoy your Texas chili! Let me know how it turns out for you!

1fx72t1,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_Paixvulpe/comments/1fx72t1/introverted_dilema/,Introverted Dilema,"When I was a child I often found my father or my grandfather in the mornings. They were the first ones up in thier prospective households and usually I wasn't far behind them. to this day I do not know why it was always me. Perhaps it is that I am much like they were. I like the peace of the early morning and the possibilities in a brand new day. 

When I stayed at my grandparents house in the summer I would wake to the smell of fresh brewed coffee. I didn't like the stuff then, but I love it now and I think I understand thier need of it in this 24/7 busy world. I rememeber joining him and babbling at him quietly, afraid to wake the rest of the house. It never felt like I was intruding, I always felt a part of it. In thier sunny kitchen, He answered my questions with that slow patience of a person who has seen so much change in his world. I remember he used his middle finger to point out things in the news paper while had me eat his buttered toast and jam. He would ply me with juice because I wasn't interested in bacon or sausage first thing in the morning.

At my mother's house, the man who raised me. My step-father, would be up before anyone else. He would start his coffee, go out and smoke a cigarette then come back in make himself a bowl of branflakes or shredded wheat. He'd have read his newspaper, and started into his second cup before he would eat his cereal and read whatever current book he was reading propped up on a steel encased mechanical pencil and held it open with a butter knife. I always felt like I was intruding on his morning. I usually didn't talk when I came into our darkly wooded dinning room with a glass of juice and whatever cereal was available to us kids and grabbed the only worthwhile part of the news paper, the comics. 

Now as an adult I cherish these now rare moments when I am surrounded by the noise of my extroverted family. People talk about filling thier cups and I cringe when they talk about how good it was to do this and that and I have to wonder ... but what about me. A few years ago I attempted to ressurect the tradition I'd held with two of the greatest influences in my life, only on my own. I would get up at five and start my coffee and settle into writing or reading or well where ever my creative leanings bent that day. Then my husband started following my routine and joining me, filling my morning with unwelcome noise that I hadn't had the chance to brace for. I guess this is where the quote it most apt (and I don't know where I heard it, but props to that source) ""Introverts don't have friends, they have Extroverts that find them and adopt them."" 

I now find these stolen moments through out the day with headphones and whatever music the algorithms have decided I must listen to at that moment and I am drowning in the need to fill that cup so I can keep holding everyone else up. This week i'm looking back at those mornings and wishing for all my life that they hadn't disappeared into the uncomplicated past that was my childhood perceptions.",1,1728183536.0,u_Paixvulpe,0,1.0,False

[Also known as \\""Firewood Under the Snow\\"" Cake.  The version in this pic is without the sour cream topping.](https://preview.redd.it/mgsdhwuoo1td1.png?width=1777&format=png&auto=webp&s=fa844366499eea59140e17ea9a2b51eb46f7bf82)

Compared to other desserts we’ve written about, today’s recipe has a quite monumental structure - but it actually takes its inspiration from the most humble of architecture: I’m talking about **“Spruce House” Cake**[.](https://imgur.com/a/1QbHWPK)  Alternatively, this dish is often called the ""Monastery Hut"" cake, or even better - “Firewood Under the Snow” which I personally think is the most fitting title.

By any name, this dish resembles the roof of a traditional house (we wrote about them [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/ukraine/comments/vilc2o/447_eest_the_sun_is_rising_on_the_120th_day_of/:)) and is very popular in Ukraine and in Moldova.  ""Spruce House"" is the name of a very popular old Ukrainian song that we will translate for you next week :)

The cake is rolled into tubes, filled with sour cherries, and stacked in a triangle - then coated with a sour cream frosting (fully substituting with whipped cream is a totally normal and acceptable thing).

[Mmmmm.](https://preview.redd.it/b59rtemto1td1.png?width=760&format=png&auto=webp&s=4d7ac15bd461e3962291e51a6589b43458446eeb)

As you know from our series, Ukrainians love their cherries (see these dishes: [Drunken Cherry Cake](https://www.reddit.com/r/ukraine/comments/xzc54d/710_eest_the_sun_is_rising_on_the_228th_day_of/) | [Vishnyak](https://www.reddit.com/r/ukraine/comments/xv4tgk/702_eest_the_sun_is_rising_on_the_223rd_day_of/)) and their sour cream.  So let’s put those together, brick by brick!  Well... beam by beam.

As this is very likely a modern dish that was (probably?) created in the late 19th or 20th Century, we don’t have too much to write about in terms of its history.  So let’s proceed straight away with how to kick off this delicious construction project.

# How to Make Spruce House Cake

[Line em up!](https://preview.redd.it/skrt73fom1td1.png?width=1140&format=png&auto=webp&s=d9a4a50ac3b75b2ffd0306c02da7ee18e5fd47b8)

**Ingredients**

* Butter: 200 g, chilled so it can be grated
* Sour cream: 200 g
* Salt: 1/4 tsp
* Cake Flour: 350-400 g
* Heavy cream: 500 g (add more to taste)
* Powdered sugar: 250-300 g
* Sour cherries: 2 cans, or equivalent fresh

**Recipe**

1. To make the dough, take the butter out of the fridge. Grate the butter on a coarse grater. Mix the grated butter with flour. Add salt and 200 g of sour cream to the mix. Do not over mix. The mixture should not be fully smooth, so it can form layers during baking. Make a ball.
2. Divide the dough into 5 pieces, sprinkle them with flour, and place them in the fridge to cool. After cooling, roll each piece into a rectangle. The rectangle should be 25x30 cm in size (approx. 9x11 inches).
3. Cut the rolled-out rectangle into 3 strips. Place prepared cherries (gently press the water out) on each strip and roll them up to form tubes. To better seal the edges of the dough, brush them with water. Place the tubes on a baking sheet and bake them in the oven at 200°C (405F) until golden.
4. Once baked, remove the tubes from the oven and let them cool. After they have cooled, trim the edges to make them even.
5. To prepare the cream, take heavy cream and powdered sugar. Add vanilla sugar, mix gently, and whip with a mixer. When the cream is ready - you can assemble the cake.
6. Spread 2-3 tablespoons of cream on the plate where the cake will be placed. Arrange 5 tubes of baked dough with cherries in a row and cover them with cream. For each additional layer, place one fewer tube.
7. Put the cake in a cool place to set for at least 8 hours. After it has set, cover the cake with the remaining cream. You can decorate the cake with melted chocolate or chocolate shavings.

1. The last beer
2. One of the cats who would like more playtime
3. The embarrassing mess
4. The addiction
5. The reading
6. The weather

First off: I live in Montreal, and winter is around the corner. If you know this part of the world, you know what that means: ice storms, freezing rain, snow dumps, and occasional arctic wind coming down the river that hurts your lungs when you breathe too hard and gives you hypothermia even if you have a really dope parka. I will overcome. I'll fucking run in place under an awning where the concrete is bare, if I have to. I'll walk outside for as long as I can stand it if there's a cold snap.

Second: my apartment is my greatest shame, and it's only because I'm anonymous here that I show it. Part of the challenge is unfucking it. Depression be damned.

Third: I love my kitties. They will get more playtime with me.

Fourth: I don't drink huge amounts of liquor, but I do drink a tall can of beer more days than not. Giving up alcohol might be the hardest part.

Fifth: I already have a pretty healthy diet, so all I can really do, besides no alcohol, is cut out energy drinks. Only black coffee, tea, and yerba mate from now on.

Besides the weather trying to ruin my life, exercise and reading should be a breeze. I'm already a physically active bookworm.

Thanks. Again, don't judge my apartment. Lifelong depression and brain damage is no joke.",8,1728182669.0,75HARD,4,0.79,False

Ingredients (Approximately)

- 4lbs of yellow cooking onions (tip: next time just buy large ones loose, instwad of the bulk bag, otherwise you spend two hours peeling and slicing)
- About 1/3rd cup raisins and 
1/4 cup dried cranberries, plumped up in a mix of hot water, white wine, and a dash of sweet vermouth 
- 2/3rd cup crabapple pieces
- fall spice: fresh ground nutmeg, a dash of ginger powder, a few cardamom seeds, cloves, allspice berries, 1 cinnamon stick broken up, a bit of rainbow pepper - all ground up in a coffee grinder
- about 2tbsp butter and 2tbsp olive oil

I melted the oils in a roasting pan on stove, added the spices to infuse the butter, added the onions and cooked them down a bit before adding the crabapples, and then the raisin-cranberry mixture (including the liquid to deflate the pan). The rest was just cooking everything down and getting the water boiled off. When the sugars started sticking to pan, I called it done. Tastes amazing, but doesn't look the greatest. Good on pork chops, or just on its own. ",7,1728182394.0,OnionLovers,2,0.9,False

But I was totally unfazed TBH, if today was a busy day, normal days will be a breeze!!


Asking questions isnt scary at all, everyone is happy to help each other out, everyone was so encouraging (like cheering me on when i get stuff right) and coworker drama and animosity seems NON EXISTANT so far, which is SO awesome. Seems like every other job I've had, I had to deal with so much of that BS. 

I already feel 10x more confident in my skills. After 1 day I already feel like I have a much stronger grasp on the menu, POS, learned how to make lots of drinks, AND,
I had fun!!! I think I love this job!!! My anxieties yesterday seem kinda silly now. But I do want to thank everyone here for the advice and reassurances :-)

All of my coworkers I've met so far are amazing. The owners are a lovely couple (they came in to work today since it was so busy, one of them closed with me) and they are awesome people as well.

Oh yeah and we get free food and drinks, wheneverrrr :D (as long as we don't go too crazy ya know)

1fx6n8j,https://www.reddit.com/r/DrCreepensVault/comments/1fx6n8j/thin_air/,Thin Air,"Summary: A long time airport bartender hears an unusual story from a young terrified traveler.

Thin Air

I worked as a bartender for an Irish-style pub in O'hare airport for, well, longer than I care admit here. Anyway, it was the closest bar to the United terminal and thus many a weary travelers' first stop off the plane and the last stop to the plane. I've met all kinds here – the anxious first time fliers, the seasoned once a month business tripper, the self-proclaimed explorer, the rich college kid, you name it, all land and take off from Micky's Pub – forgive the pun.

The thing I loved the most about the people were their stories. I've heard them all from the mundane, to the traveling nightmare, the strange coincidences. I remember a gent named James Mayfield flew into the stool closest to the tap one night and went on to spin me a yarn about his flight had made excellent time because of a tail wind and because of the early arrival he incidentally discovered his long distance girlfriend, who he had just flown out to see, was cheating on him. Of course then there was Ms. Lauren Naylor, her taxi's flat tire made her miss flight 93 on 9/11 and then, years later, a connecting flight delay caused her to miss boarding that cruise ship which disappeared a few years ago. All great stories but the man who sat at the stool close to the tap just a little over day and half ago takes the cake. 	His ID said his name was Greg Reeves. He was a young 21 year old kid, thin, he had this absolutely lost petrified look on his face as he shambled his way through the faux wooden doors into the low Irish Session background music. I immediately took him for the fear of flying/first time flier type and suggested he slug down a shot of jameson with a beer to take the edge off. My words seemed to fly right past him as he stared through the taps with his mouth half a gape and his eyes batting slow stunned blinks.

After a minute or so I crossed my arms impatiently peering down at him as he slowly mounted the stool. I began to wonder if he needed help or more importantly, needed to leave because he was already intoxicated on flight booze or maybe some kind of valium. After a few more shaky seconds he finally seemed to acknowledge my existence and then choked on his dry tongue to order a  double ginger and jamo. He started to flash a wad of cash so my worries took a back seat as I made his order.   	“Rough first flight? Where you from?”

“Near Cinci.” He stammered, “first time flying since.” He seemed to trail off while I mentally patted myself on the back for guessing his deal.

I turned around with his cold amber drink in hand and set it in front of him. That's when I noticed he was sweating more than that glass, “since what?” I asked while looking around the bar, noting that aside from a quiet couple couple at a 2 top, we were the only ones here and probably because it was still early in the morning on a Tuesday. He took a long pull off the straw and then his eyes suddenly seemed to pop back to life. “Since...” He coughed up part of the drink, “Do you really want to hear this story?”

I smiled and chuckled, “Sure why not kid, just don't make it all day, I don't got all day. Nah, that ain't true but make it kinda short Flight 1,” I trailed off, realizing the kid wouldn't know the significance of the flight number, “New York plane is due soon and I got more a few regulars gonna pop in here for an irish coffee or five, alright?”

“I grew up in Warren, Ohio.” He looked at me like I knew what he was talking about before. “It's that town with all the weird...”

“Warren?” I interrupted him because I did know the significance, “That place with all that weird weather back about ten years or so.”

Greg's eyes grew wider and locked in on mine, “Yeah. That Warren, Ohio.”

“You guys had all those freaky storms right? The one with the mites carried on the dust?”

Greg breathed in his drink then exhaled, “Oh my god. The dust sucked smothered the county but the mites came a day or two after it cleared. They got everywhere. Any place you could plausibly find dust they were there. Everyone I knew had bites or rashes over half their body. It felt like they were eating you between layers of your skin and they way some people looked when they had their rash breakouts, no doctor could tell em differently.”

Seemed like the kid had some of that childhood trauma pent up in him, I ain't no doctor but I recognize my role as a caregiver of sorts. Maybe I should have gone back to school to be shrink or something. My eyes pointed to his empty drink and he fired back an affirmative nod.

“We also had this once in a life time fall thunderstorm with the most constant lightning you've ever seen. Apparently, a huge flock of canadian geese were confused in the storm and the lightning, well, literally cooked those geese. They fell all around town. Everywhere you looked there were burned and mangled goose carcasses smashed on roofs and through windshields. Coyotes had a field day. One of the geese fell and smashed right through my skylight, landing at the foot my bed. Can you imagine being a kid and having a partially burned goose with its neck slit by glass bleeding out on your bed back lit by lightning strobes?”

I paused for a moment before replying as he seemed genuinely mortified re-living this moment in his head space. Two customers came in and sat in the far hook of the bar. “Nah,” I said, politely, forcing a smile to the new comers, “tell you what, next one is on the house, when I get back, I got a question for ya.”

Living in Chicago you get plenty of strange weather. I guess hearing about and talking about it is a hobby of mine. Maybe because it was easier than living with it. Call me intrigued by the kid's first hand accounts of some of the strangest weather I've ever heard of. One of those incidents stood out in my head, probably stands out in yours too if you followed any weather news or seen any strange weather documentaries. I guess it's got a lot of nicknames depending on who you listen to – The Squid, El Torro, The Bull, The Ace of Spades, The Reaper, Dead Man Walking – the massive F-5 tornado which seemed to spawn smaller tornadoes horizontally like an octopus spreads its tentacles or like massive horns and front legs from a charging bull from its mile-wide base as it seemed to circle the town of Warren. One of the docs I've seen said the phenomena was exclusive to this particular tornado.

I poured the new comers a couple of Guinness drafts then made my way back Mr. Reeves who sat there gnawing at his finger nails. I made him the promised third drink and asked him what it was like to see that tornado first hand.

“Yeah.” he said distantly, “It was pretty intense.”

I was left unfulfilled by his description. “Well, luckily it dissipated before it hit the town, right? No one died?”

Greg rubbed his five o'clock shadow, “My dad was in a plane that day. He was basically a crop duster pilot. I've haven't flown since he was still around.”

What can I say? I  struck a nerve but I was hooked by the kid at this point and had little else to do. “He used to take you up?” I danced around the fact I thought he was trying to say his dad may have died in flight because of the tornado. I just wanted to know more of his story.

“Yeah, the thing was back then he used to take pictures from the air of people's crops and than spray. You know, help the farmers find the wet spots and other trouble spots in their crops and field. You can do that with a drone now but back then, um yeah. That was my dad's thing and we'd fly all the time. I never thought I'd get this way.” His voice seemed to trail off then come back strong, “clouds!” he exclaimed. “My dad always said to never fly through clouds especially the little low puffy ones. Never said why.”

“Turbulence and visibility is my guess, especially in a little plane. Not as big of a problem for a jumbo jet I guess. Ah, what do I know, I work at an airport but I don't know jack about flying.”   	“Any pilot will tell you not to fly through the puffy clouds but anyway, my dad knowing I loved flying and everything about the sky gave me this model rocket with a little camera in it. You know, it's got a little firework rocket motor and pops the parachute out at the end and it took pictures all the way down on a little roll of film. Anyway, I remember the first day I got and we lit it up twice and on the third flight my dad had to go inside for something, I don't recall what. Anyway, I did something. I something I thought was impossible. I stacked few of the rocket engines together and then aimed it at a low puffy cloud. I was curious to see if I could reach it, if I could see what's inside.”

He made rocket noises and zipped his finger up from the bar towards the ceiling.

“I killed a cloud. I killed that cloud.”

I should have cut him off right there. I should have asked him to go but I was so damn locked in on his kid and his face and how sober he sounded as he went on. He described the cloud popping in the sky like someone puncturing a water balloon with all the water dropping out and bits of the latex skittering off. He told me it made an expression, a face that boiled away after the rocket popped it.

“That was the day it all started.” Greg declared. “I was soaked, never found the rocket again, and I was sad and that night we had the reddest sunset I had ever seen. I started seeing faces on the clouds – I thought it was just my imagination and of course, I didn't tell anyone, who's going to care if an eleven year old kid talks about stuff he see in clouds, anyway. At first they were sad faces like the greek tragedy masks everywhere I looked in the sky. Then the faces turned menacing almost demonic, always hanging just within sight, whether it was riding in the car, or out the window at school all day everyday. I refused to go flying with my dad again and I put a poster over my skylight so I couldn't see them. Then it got worse. A swarm of large dust devils ruined my little league game which could have brought us to State. They, the clouds, the weather, followed me everywhere, even on my twelfth birthday we took a trip to Disney World and it rained every day so much they closed most of the parks and we were stuck inside almost the whole time. Then the real dangerous weather started, the stuff you've heard about.”

I felt like I needed a drink and closure, “So your dad and your flight today and all of this?”

“A day before El Torro, he was hired to take photos over a corn field damaged by a huge hail storm the previous week. My dad showed me the photos when he confronted me. The hail damage carved into the crops spelled out in vague but still clear words “Greg. Greg. Greg”, my name. Dad warned me about never flying through clouds. He seemed to know already otherwise why confront me. I told him about the rocket and cloud. Then, the day of El Torro, he took off from the little airport during the storm and then the tornado and storm seemed to miraculously disappear. Authorities found my dad's plane completely intact landed in an empty field with no sign of him. They searched for two weeks from the ground, the air, and divers in a small lake and never found his body.”

“Then storms stopped?”

“Yeah, the storms and clouds stopped. I mourned dad with my mom and sister. We went on with our lives and moved away. I finished middle and high school, went to college, found a job, turned it requires travel and that brings me to here and now. I thought it was going to be okay to fly again.”

“What do you mean?”

“We hit cruising altitude and I was just beginning to relax. I pulled up my shade. It was nice clear dawn weather. But there he was. There was dad standing on a cloud shelf just close enough to see his wispy icy blue face. It was like he was part cloud and part ice. He was entombed but still alive, his eyes met mine, buried alive in the sky. He turned and his mouth opened like he was screaming at me, for me, for anyone. I gasped and shut the shade and kept it shut for the remainder of the flight.”

The kid went on a bit longer as I started to become less entranced and less enthralled with his story and increasingly considering calling some sort of mental health authority for the kid. Needless to say I silently cut him off but he didn't ask for another away. He went on to say that the image of his father imprisoned in the sky has shaken him and he was worried that the clouds would now remember him as the real killer and would come after him again. I blinked a few times and said nothing as he seemed to stare at me for any help I could offer in his time of crisis.

I walked away trying to figure out what I was going to do for the kid as I served a couple of new patrons. While I was talking to them, the kid just hurried for the door. Good riddance I thought after I checked to see he left cash. After I finished making a few rounds of irish coffee for the NY rush I came back to his stool and noticed the generous tip he left him along side a bar napkin on which he wrote: “It's happening again” with an arrow pointed behind me.

The kid parked himself in front of the TV with the Weather Channel on. They were going on about some kind of breaking news Particularly Dangerous Situation five out of five derecho from the west severe weather event forecasted to strike Chicago later in the day.

The weather channel, what do they know? Nothing because nothing like it happened in the evening, overnight or morning. I put all of it out of my head until the cops showed up a little after noon today. 	There were two detectives one was a federal air marshal and the other an airport cop or maybe he was some big wig with TSA. The marshal was by the book and serious but the other guy, the TSA guy or whatever was a bit more...errr...off. He wondered around the stool Greg sat in while the marshal grilled me.

They were asking for security footage of the morning and then finally about Greg. Did he say what he was doing here, where he was going, where he was from, did he say anything weird blah blah blah. I happily gave them the footage and the non-crazy cliffnotes of the story I wrote here. All of their questions seemed to be leading that he suffered some kind of mental break and then either had been found dead or they were concerned he was or had been a flight risk. Apparently the kid never showed up to his work conference and had instead after leaving my bar caught the first plane headed west before the storms were due to develop.

The marshal finished up with me after a few notes and seemed to head for the door. I asked them what happened to Greg. The marshal said he couldn't comment on an on-going investigation. The TSA agent seemed like he wanted to spill the beans but was gagged by his superior.

An hour later the same TSA guy came back and told me in no uncertain words that 253 people boarded the flight to Denver and 252 got off. There was no sign of an midair decompression event. They checked the cargo holds, they checked the whole plane, the septic tanks, they were checking the flight path post landing gear deployment – nothing, nada, zip. As the saying goes, and the whole reason I'm putting this out there, Greg Reeves seemed to have disappeared into thin air.

so I have a crush on a girl a year older than me, she’s really funny and smart and has a great personality. We also have similar majors and share common interests.   
  
“wow sounds great, what’s the problem?” Asks the reader

”well”, says the guy who wants to rip his head off, “I’m stupid and have no idea how to read social cues, and I often have a tendency to overthink literally everything I do.”

so yeah, this girl and I often look at each other whenever we are near each her, I have not been able to hang out with her alone, only in group settings of about 5-6 people. Anyway sometimes i look at her, and sometimes she looks at me, when we make eye contact we smile and look away.   
she has also waved to me in public, it was one of those wiggle finger “flirty“ waves, and I don’t know how to interpret that… she also laughs at my jokes, given I’ve been told I’m funny, but like most of my jokes are stupid and she still laughs at them, or at least smiles.

there seems to be genuine interest on both sides, but as previously stated I'm terrible at this kind of stuff.   
  
so I resort to the internet! The only place filled with the upmost and absolute truth, but seriously any advice? Im Thinking right now I’ll wait and keep interactions small but be sure to show interest before asking her to lunch or coffee or something casual later down the line. But yeah any advice cuz I’m clueless :/

It varies sometimes, but it smells legit rotten. My boyfriend describes it as mothballs lol. Of course worse in the morning when I wake up, which according to him stinks up our whole bedroom… but I noticed it smells worse after sugary drinks especially my morning coffee. I can taste a bitterness in the back of my throat sometimes. It’s embarrassing, I’m embarrassed  around him and other people, and it sucks. I thought it was a cavity or a filling issue since the smell comes from the area near my top right tooth filling but I’m beginning to think after my 3rd dentist visit, which they instead referred me to a periodontist even though I have zero cavities nor any sign of gum disease, that it has to be my tonsils. 

Now the thing is I don’t feel anything. My boyfriend tried to help me look and prod around back there with a q-tip but I’m terrified of touching my tonsils, when we tried it literally made me feel light headed. He said he wasn’t sure he really saw anything and neither did I after looking. I don’t feel anything funny either. So while I wait to get into my ENT doctor, any tips? Anyone have this issue? I do have a water flosser. I have a tongue scraper. I could use both of those more. But even after a nice brushing and flossing, andddd mouthwash the smell comes back instantly. I’m just running out of ideas to fix this. 😔",1,1728181333.0,tonsilstones,1,0.99,False
1fx6g8v,https://www.reddit.com/r/decaf/comments/1fx6g8v/1_month_caffeine_free_life_changing_experience/,1 month caffeine free - life changing experience,"It's now been 30 caffeine free days for me. I've been drinking caffeine in forms of tea and coffee for the last 3 years with some periods off from it. Last 1.5 years I was drinking 1-2 cups of coffee daily. I knew the time has come to quit it when I started to severely suffer from mental and physical health issues. However I didn't know how life-changing this decision would be for me. 

Let's talk about the withdrawals. 

1st week was absolute nightmare. I could barely get through my routines. I experienced severe fatigue, muscle weakness, anhedonia. 

2nd week headaches kicked in, as well as issues with short term memory and my ability to focus. I also started to experience derealization to the point I would hallucinate. It was bizzare. 

3rd week I finally started to feel better, though most days I was depressed. Still felt muscle weakness. My gym performance dropped about 30-40% without the caffeine. 

4th week I only sometimes experienced fatigue, though it was not a problem anymore. Depression I felt these weeks also started to vanish. 

And now about the benefits. 

Amazing sleep quality. This one is my favorite benefit. I just can not believe the childhood kind of quality sleep and beautiful vivid dreams I get. I sleep for 9 hours straight and feel so damn refreshed each morning. It's a blessing. Now I feel like I didn't ever get a proper night of sleep while I was drinking coffee. It's crazy

I feel happy. This came very unexpected. I actually started to smile randomly. Just because I'm alive and it feels good to be alive. It feels funny to say this, but I just feel good and positive, instead of always ruminating in thoughts of terror and the constant feeling like my life is going to shit. 

I got healthier physically. I have IBS and mild gastritis and dropping coffee took me miles further in my healing. There is some research that points to how coffee negatively affects the digestive system and creates obstacles in GI healing. The good sleep I began to have probably also helped majorly with this. 

I don't experience stress anymore. I have a responsible job that can be stressful and usually has a big load of different daily tasks. After quiting coffee I just feel calm no matter what I'm faced with. Almost alarmingly calm. Even if everything around me is burning, I just don't feel stress or anxiety anymore. I just do what is needed and don't think about it too much. 

At this point my gym performance is at about 80% of what it used to be. I feel mentally clear and generally good and energetic. I'm also a lot more social and feel excited about my life. 

So the question is - will I continue to stay off it? Well at this point I would feel stupid if I would trade all the described benefits just to feel a petty caffeine high. The tradeoff is not even closely worth it. 

However, I do believe in the therapeutic benefits that drugs can have if used properly. I could see myself doing caffeine once in 2-3 months, just to see if it can have any therapeutic effects for me. Caffeine is a stimulant. Stimulants open up a persons energetical resource. This can be used to be reminded of the potential you have, potential that can be used. However if you abuse any stimulant, even coffee which is considered not as potent as something like cocaine or amphetamines, you WILL pay the price. Learn how to generate energy naturally and you will become a happy and fulfilled individual.
