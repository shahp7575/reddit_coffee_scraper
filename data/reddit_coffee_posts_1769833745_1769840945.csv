1qruu0o,https://www.reddit.com/r/authors/comments/1qruu0o/halfway_done_with_my_debut_novel/,Halfway done with my debut novel!,"My debut novel is an action packed spy thriller novella, which is going to be around 100-200 pages. Here's a sneak peak for the book:

# CHAPTER ONE: THE TARGET

The assassin was in the target’s bedroom, and everything was perfect. The target was alone, unaware, bent over a desk, half asleep, counting something that didn’t matter. Moonlight spilled through half-closed blinds, painting stripes across the carpet. Dust floated lazily in the light, unnoticed by the target.

The assassin didn’t even consider a gun. Even a suppressed pistol would never be silent. He had learned that lesson the hard way once—almost got himself killed. The memory of that night clung to him: metallic scent of blood, echoing gunshot, the bitter taste of fear. He carried it like a scar.

The air smelled faintly of cedar and old laundry. He could hear the faint hum of the building’s HVAC, the distant horn of a car on the street below, the soft scrape of his boots on the carpet. Careful. Quiet. Every muscle coiled, every movement deliberate.

The knife in his hand was cold, heavy, balanced perfectly. He focused on nothing but the motion and the outcome.

He struck.

The blade sank into the target’s chest, straight through the back of the heart. The target collapsed. Blood spread across the floor, dark and slow, pooling beneath the light. For a heartbeat, he watched the lifeless corpse. No breathing. He searched for a pulse. Felt nothing. He searched the target. A wallet. He opened it and found their ID.

Later, in some nameless hotel room, the assassin would drink coffee, turn on the TV, scroll through his phone, and try to remember what it felt like to live a normal life. He used to have friends. They called him Alex. Saturday nights were theirs—elbows on the bar, laughter spilling across scratched tables, a pint in hand, someone trying to beat him at pool. Then home, where the TV flickered and popcorn burned, the comfort of ordinary life pressing around him like a warm coat.

Life had been simple. Until it wasn’t. A mugging. A gun. Medical bills he couldn’t pay. Debt that buried him alive. Alexander Torres was ruined.

He became an assassin. A ghost. He never missed. He never left a trace.

But he remembered everyone he killed. Every one. Even the most ordinary. Criminals. Terrorists. Serial killers. Money launderers. Faces. Families. Friends. Voices he would never forget. Even the most mundane of them had left marks he could never erase.

Sometimes, he could still hear them. Whispering. Screaming. Laughing. He closed his eyes. He shut it out. Tried to breathe. Tried to sleep. Tried to forget. But sleep was fleeting, and the memories were relentless.

Every assignment had its rhythm. Observation. Planning. Execution. He knew the target’s route, the sound of their keys, the timing of their evening coffee. Every motion anticipated, every second scheduled. Time was never a problem. Precision always came first. Always.

When the job was done, he moved on to the next. It always worked this way. Always like clockwork. Every step measured. Every second accounted for. And yet… the faces lingered. The small mistakes. The forgotten movements. The questions of whether he had done the right thing. The people he had killed seemed innocent every time, no matter how bad they were. Some actually begged for their lives. Alex felt like a terrible person would not.

The hotel room was quiet. The city outside hummed with life, unaware of him, unaware of what he had become. The walls, the ceiling, the narrow bed—it all felt sterile and small, a cage he had chosen willingly.

The phone buzzed across the nightstand. Same number as always.

Alex stared at it.

The light from the screen reflected on the hotel room’s walls. Shadows stretched across the carpet, reaching like long fingers toward the bed. The blood, the faces, the echoes—they waited for him. Always waiting.

He took a slow breath.

His fingers hovered just above the phone.

And he answered.

In truth, the last time I tried I was maybe hip height, and my primary job was licking the whisk clean. I don’t think my dad was much of a baker either, but he did one recipe really well.

I’ll spare the details, because I don’t remember them too well and they aren’t of concern here. But in short, he forfeited me to my ma when I was ten. I haven’t had a single word of contact with that entire side of my family since. I have a few feelings about that. But I swear, the muffins he used to make were the best I’ve ever had in my life. Nostalgia is most definitely playing a part, but here’s what I know:

They weren’t fancy, no pumpkin or coffee or berries or anything. It was just a damn good batter, and a generous sprinkling of cinnamon and sugar on top. 

I don’t expect a 1:1 match here. That’d be insane to expect given what I’m offering here. But I guess my hope is someone can point me to a recipe or two y’all’d vouch for, that this describes, and that a baking noob like myself could try.

I don’t know if you’ll ever read this... maybe it’s better that you don’t. But there are things sitting heavy on my chest, and I need to let them out somewhere. So here I am.

You’ve always held a strange place in my heart. Even now, after all this time, even after I tried to move on even if there wasnt anything between us... there’s a part of me that still wonders about us. About what we could have been. Maybe that’s what makes this so hard.

Seeing you again, even just for coffee… stirred everything back up. I can’t lie... it felt good. Familiar. Like part of me woke up. But now that I’ve had time to sit with it, I realize something deeper: I don’t think you came back for me. Not fully. I think you just didn’t want to lose me completely... just in case.

And that’s what hurts.

Because I’m not your “just in case.”

I’m not a backup.

I’m not the person you come back to only when you’re unsure of what you already have.

I cared deeply for you. I probably always will in some small way. But I can’t keep living in a story where I’m waiting on your maybe. I deserve a chapter where I’m someone’s first choice. Not a spare tire waiting in the trunk for when things go flat.

This isn’t about blame... it’s just truth. And maybe you didn’t mean to hurt me. But I’ve hurt myself enough by holding on to a version of you that lives more in my memory than in my reality.

So this is me letting go. Not because I hate you. But because I love myself enough to stop waiting.

Thank you for being part of my story.

It’s built for people who want **quick espresso without a complicated setup**. The machine heats up fast (around **25 seconds**) and uses **one-touch buttons** for Espresso and Lungo. Its **small footprint** makes it practical for tight counter spaces, dorms, or minimalist kitchens.

From specs and user feedback, the **19-bar pressure system** seems to be the reason many mention consistent crema and espresso quality. It also has a **removable water tank**, a foldable drip tray for taller cups, and **auto shut-off** for energy saving.

Things worth knowing:

* Uses **Nespresso Original capsules only**
* No built-in milk frother
* Designed for convenience rather than manual brewing or experimentation

Overall, this looks like a **straightforward espresso solution** for people who value simplicity and space efficiency.

1qruk39,https://www.reddit.com/r/GoingToSpain/comments/1qruk39/ten_days_in_spain_trip_report/,Ten days in Spain trip report,"Posting a report of a trip I made over the Christmas-to-New-Years time, 2025. Southern Spain and some Barcelona. Hopefully it helps anybody making such a trip.

Our trip consisted of roughly nine sightseeing days, excluding the travel to and from Spain. Used British Airways from SFO to Madrid, and returned from Barcelona, using Heathrow for transit. Had a laptop scare at SFO, the laptop was lying on a bin after security check and somehow got thrown under emptied bins. From Madrid, we flew on a small Iberia Air Nostrum plane to Seville. The carry-ons were loaded as cargo and given back immediately on deplaning. We took a taxi to Hotel Alcazar, which turned out to be a really nice modern hotel, walking distance from the Seville cathedral. For breakfast, we found the Bar La Galantina a quick and decent option, very close to the hotel. My vocabulary was limited, like sin queso, con leche, jamon. But it was manageable. On the morning of December 26, we had a Seville cathedral tour including the Giralda tower visit. The tower tour took roughly half an hour. We walked up the ramp to the top, with many views from intermediate points and then from top all around. Once inside the cathedral, we used the audio guide in English. There was a tomb of Christopher Columbus, with the casket held by 4 figures representing the 4 kingdoms of Spain. Outside we saw the Orange tree courtyard. Roamed the streets of Santa Cruz quarter. Lots of shops for souvenirs, food. The Real Alcazar visit was in the afternoon. I had purchased all tickets, from the official website only, in advance. The palace, the pond, the fountains and gardens are beautiful, and I really enjoyed the walks inside and outside. Quite crowded, and sunny, though winter time. A peacock was strolling without fear, we took close-up videos to our heart’s content. The same night, we watched a flamenco show at La Casa del Flamenco. We made sure we reached about half an hour early, to get front row seats. It was an intense experience. The songs and the guitar play were as great as the dance.

The next morning, we rented a car from Enterprise Rental car near the Santa Justa rail station. We had asked for an Opel Insignia, but got a Mazda CX-30 instead, which had enough trunk space to keep 4 carry-ons and some backpacks. It turned out to be a really nice car for our drives - powerful, possibly a bit bulky for the hotel underground parking garages with less room to maneuver. We had left our international driver’s licenses at the hotel, so made a short trip back. Driving for the first time in Europe was not difficult at all, frankly. Just kept pace with other cars around, that's all. It was supposed to rain in the afternoon in Seville, but we were headed to Cordoba for the day. Cordoba mosque-cathedral was a surreal experience. Dimly lit. High ceiling. Exquisite arches. A forest of columns, 856 in all. Quite spread out, but like one huge hall. The mosque was built on top of an older Visigothic church and a Roman temple, and later, the church was built more centrally. The Mihrab was very ornate, we could view it, but it is cordoned off, so cannot be entered. We probably should have hired a guide for this tour, in hindsight, for better understanding. Outside was the Bell tower. We climbed the stairs to the top. Very nice views all around, of rooftops and gardens. After lunch, we walked the streets of Cordoba's Jewish quarter. White washed streets, patios with flower pots, artisan shops. We had tickets for Viana Palace, so we walked all the way there. 12 patios, all very unique with flowers, plants, trees. It was slightly rain drenched, and not crowded, and daylight almost gone. On the way back, we had tea, cookies and very good chocolate cake at La Pasteleria Francesa. The owner is French, she makes the cookies and cakes herself. We had a great conversation in English. My daughter got a cookie recipe from her. It was dark and late, and so we filled up the gas tank at a Repsol close by, and headed back to Seville. Heavy rain most of the way, including closeby thunder strike. But I am glad that the only rain we encountered in Spain was during this drive back to Seville.

The next day was our second and final Seville day. With more time on hand, we went into Billy Brunch, situated within a minute from the hotel, to get a hearty breakfast. It took a while to get food, as the place was crowded. After that, we went to Plaza de Espana, walking through the large expanse of Maria Luisa Park. It has 48 tiled benches for the 48 provinces. We took pictures seated on one of them. We lingered on at a flamenco dance that was being performed on the premises. I walked on one of the bridges. Lots of horse-drawn carriages trotting by. We walked a lot, to the riverside, past the Torre del Oro, to the Triana bridge, then the market there, and on to the ceramic shops. In the evening, there was one street close to the Giralda tower that was enormously lit and had huge crowds on the street. On the walls, some light and sound show was being performed. Nearby Calle Sierpes is a shopper's haven. We closed the night with a visit to the mushroom shaped Setas. We didn't have the legs anymore to go to the upper walkways, which is a ticketed entry.

The next day we drove to Granada and saw Ronda and Setenil de Bodegas, two white villages, on the way. At Ronda, we had a majestic view of the El Tajo gorge, from the Puente Nuevo bridge. The valley floor far below and the roads and white houses on cliff edges, it is any photographer's dream. We also went down the stairs and paid 5 Euros each to get a close-up view from the bottom. Our daughters got the same view by climbing down a lot more stairs, unticketed. Afterwards, we walked the old towns and shops for some time. By the time we reached Setenil, we knew daylight was on budget. The winding roads took us to the parking lot. We walked up and down many roads, but could not find the trademark spot of Cuevas de la Sombra. We might have passed below it though, because there was a spot on the road where it seemed to rain all the time, when in fact there was no rain elsewhere. The cafe Abaceria El Rincon Del Beso where we ate was built inside the rocks. It had a great view. It felt like a secret hideout, from the upstairs terrace where we sat. Next was a long drive to Granada in the darkness, through the winding mountainous roads, with a final stretch on regular highway A-92. Google maps failed to find Hotel Barcelo Carmen and we kept moving in circles because of it, so we stopped at another hotel close by and got a printed map and directions, the old fashioned way.

Barcelo was grand, cheaper than our Seville hotel, but much grander. The Granada effect, I think. Buffet breakfast was included, and it was my dream breakfast. Spanish rice, beans, spinach, steamed tomato, carrots, omelets, salad bar, pastries, fudge brownies, coffee. There was a dark sauce that I added amply. I think it was squid ink sauce, but I'm not sure. There was also guava paste, and honey comb with natural honey. Coffee, tea, fancy breads. The next morning, we went to see the Alhambra. Our timed entry was to Nasrid Palace, where we reached on time. The adjacent Alcazaba fortress and Generalife garden were next. Lots of walking but enjoyed it under the winter sun, and with the openness all around. From the rooftops, we had views of the Albaicin, and the Sierra Nevada mountains. We took a cab from there to Plaza Nueva, where we would be part of a walking tour of the Albaicin and Sacromonte area. Our guide talked like a history professor and had a great sense of humor. He led us to the various spots, and gave interesting details at each point. All in English. We even saw a cave house in Sacromonte, with the permission of the owner. By the time we reached San Nicolas viewpoint, it was past sunset and evening lights were shining in the city of Granada in the distance and the Alhambra. A very full and fulfilling day.

Next day we had the grand breakfast again, and headed to the Nerja caves. I must say my younger daughter had been very helpful with the directions while driving in the city, especially when navigating the roundabouts, which were confusing for a while. The trick is to remember the first exit is the first on your right, the second exit is the next, etc. We have seen stalactites and stalagmites in Shasta caverns in California, but the Nerja caves are on a much grander scale. Audio guides were helpful. Once outside, I went for an IMAX-like 3D experience. That shows the cave insides in more detail, in a more lighted way. Afterwards, we walked toward the Maro beach and went up to the bridge over the highway. Next stop was Frigilana, a very pretty white village. Has lots of winding, cobblestone streets and viewpoints. Elevated views overlooking the Mediterranean sea. Colored flower pots on the walls, narrow balconies with iron railings. From Frigilana, we drove back to Nerja's prime spot, the Balcon de Europa. It was evening time, and the palm trees were all lit up with Christmas lights and decoration. A band was playing on stage. This was New Year's eve. We drove back to Granada, and around midnight, walked up the street from our hotel to Plaza del Carmen, each carrying a ziploc bag with 12 grapes in it. It's a Spanish tradition to eat 12 grapes as the clock strikes midnight, and we did as the locals did.

The next day we dropped the car near Granada airport, and boarded a Vueling flight to Barcelona. We had now gathered a check-in luggage with purchases made in Spain, and even got a VAT refund form from the El Corte Ingles department store opposite our Granada hotel. We might have been able to get refunds in other places, but the thought never crossed our minds. Anyway, we scanned the form at Barcelona airport that day while passing by one of the kiosks for that purpose. My elder daughter had been practicing her Spanish all along at every opportunity and we were relieved to have a semi Spanish speaker amongst us, and acting on our behalf. She was carrying on a very friendly conversation with the cab driver. We arrived at Hotel Astoria and got into our 8th floor room. One thing I found less helpful at all the hotels was the showers having half-doors, glass, and swinging. A sliding door with full cover would have kept the water inside, and given more stability. Anyway, our Barcelona sightseeing that day was limited to a stroll on Passeig de Gracia, and seeing the lighted Casa Batllo, designed by the architect Antoni Gaudi. The rooftop looks like a dragon's back, and balconies are shaped like eye sockets, nose holes. Columns look like bones, and the edges are not straight, to produce a nature-inspired feel. The lights on the house kept changing colors, and the crowd in front photo shooted. The next door house Casa Amattler also looks designer, with the top looking like a Pascal's triangle.

The next day, we had an all-day guided tour of Montserrat, Girona & Costa Brava, which I had booked from the tripadvisor website. We took a cab in the morning and reached the meeting point at 8:10 am. By 8:30 am, all passengers arrived and the tour bus took off. It was a very nice bus, and our guides gave us briefings for the day. First stop, Montserrat. We had great views on approach, thanks to the clear weather. It was a cold day though (Jan 2nd). We saw the Black Madonna at the monastery. I went hiking a bit but did not go all the way. The mountain views were spectacular. From a distance, the funicular trajectory had a serpentine look. Glad I was not on it, definitely would be vertigo inducing with its steep slope. The bus was next going to Girona. We were free to enjoy a nap and get rested for the next phase of walking. The road signs were showing Girona/Franca, so I realized the southern border of France wouldn't be too far. Girona is a medieval town. We walked on an iron bridge designed by the same person who designed the Eiffel tower in France. The colorful houses lining the Onyar river were a pretty sight. We also saw an Arab bath, the Girona cathedral, and walked the streets of the Jewish quarter. We saw the lioness statue at the city gates. Legend has it, in the old times, the gates would close at night, and any latecomers would have to prove that they are not strangers, in order to get in. The password was to kiss the lioness's behind! We did get an hour to lunch at Independence square, and the Munich restaurant had the burgers and salads we wanted. The last stop for the day was Tossa de Mar, a coastal town in Costa Brava. We walked the cobblestone streets with well-preserved medieval stone walls. Hiked to a very scenic viewpoint from where the coast and the Mediterranean sea were both visible. The views were great. Then with the daylight gone, we walked back past the Torre d'en Joanas, a tower flying the Catalan independence flag. There were other medieval ruins close by. Finally back to the bus and headed back to Barcelona. A wonderful day of sightseeing, and many thanks to our tour guides, educational as well.

The next day was our final day of tour and was confined to the city of Barcelona. We first went to see Sagrada Familia. Gaudi's architecture. It's a church with modern design. Has tree-like columns branching towards the ceiling. Stained glass windows flood the interior with color. Our guide was a great story teller, and made the tour interesting and even a bit of spiritual discourse sometimes. We came to know the hidden meanings behind some of the sculptures. Next we taxied to Park Guell. I felt a bit let down by this ""artificial"" attraction. There was a colorful lizard/dragon made with ceramic tiles, which might bring joy to little kids. More fun was roaming the streets of La Rambla with many shops. We went to the La Bocqueria market too, which had a lot of variety, but was too expensive. Afterwards, we headed to Barceloneta beach and walked towards the sail-shaped W hotel. People were working out at open-air gyms built on the beach! We ended the day with a light and sound show at Montjuic Magic Fountain. A big crowd had gathered. We were amazed how even late at night, the streets were so full of people, locals and tourists alike.

The return journey had a twist. Our older daughter's British Airways flight from Heathrow to JFK got delayed and finally cancelled, and she was given a voucher for a hotel outside the airport. Luckily, after many phone calls with customer service, she managed to get a rebooked flight on Jetblue the next morning. She did not need a visa for the UK even though she had to step outside the airport. Her total stay in London was less than 24 hours though.

In retrospect, there were so many things to see. History, scenery, nature, grandeur, architecture, all in great abundance. The language barrier was never really felt, the people everywhere very friendly and helpful. The winter weather was actually conducive to the extended walking sessions.",1,1769839862.0,GoingToSpain,0,1.0,False
1qrujra,https://www.reddit.com/r/BuildToAttract/comments/1qrujra/how_to_build_a_relationship_that_doesnt_fall/,How to Build a Relationship That Doesn't Fall Apart: The Science-Based Weekly Check-In Nobody Talks About,"most relationships don't die from the big stuff. they die from a thousand tiny resentments nobody mentioned until it was too late. 

i've spent the last year obsessively researching what actually makes relationships work, diving into podcasts, relationship research, reading everything from Gottman to Perel. turns out the couples therapists have been screaming about one thing forever and nobody's listening: you need structured time to talk about your relationship before things explode.

the science is wild. Dr. John Gottman (the guy who can predict divorce with 90% accuracy) found that couples who do regular relationship maintenance have 31% lower rates of relationship dissolution. but here's the thing, most people wait until they're already in crisis mode. by then you're not having a check in, you're having a fight.

so here's what actually works. **weekly relationship check-ins**. yeah it sounds corporate and cringe but stick with me because this framework has legitimately saved relationships that were circling the drain.

**the setup matters more than you think.** pick a consistent time, same day every week. sunday evenings work for most people. no phones, no distractions, comfortable setting. this isn't some intense therapy session, it's 20-30 minutes of intentional connection. the consistency is what builds the habit and removes the ""we need to talk"" dread that makes everyone defensive.

**start with appreciations.** this isn't fluffy bullshit, it's neurologically important. when your brain is in gratitude mode, you literally cannot be in threat mode. so each person shares 2-3 things they appreciated about the other person that week. specific stuff. not ""you're great"" but ""i noticed you made coffee for me every morning even though you were rushing.""

**then move to feelings check.** both people share their emotional state using actual feeling words, not thoughts disguised as feelings. ""i feel overwhelmed"" not ""i feel like you don't help enough."" this is straight from Non-Violent Communication principles. you're building emotional literacy together. most people are terrible at this because nobody taught us how to identify what we're actually feeling beyond mad, sad, glad.

**address the relationship itself.** here's where it gets real. what's working? what needs attention? this is where you catch small issues before they metastasize. maybe someone felt disconnected this week. maybe sex has been off. maybe you both crushed it at being a team. the couples who do this consistently report feeling more secure because they know issues won't fester for months.

**Hold Me Tight by Dr. Sue Johnson** changed how i understand this entire process. she's the creator of Emotionally Focused Therapy and this book breaks down attachment science in relationships. best relationship book i've ever read, full stop. it won awards for a reason. Johnson explains how these check-ins work on a neurological level, they're literally rewiring your attachment patterns. the book gives you conversation frameworks that feel natural, not scripted. this will make you question everything you thought you knew about why couples fight.

the app **Paired** is insanely good for guided check-ins. it sends daily questions and has structured weekly check-in prompts based on Gottman research. uses actual relationship science, not random compatibility quiz garbage. my partner and i use it before our sunday check-ins to get warmed up. makes the conversation flow instead of that awkward ""so uh, how are we doing"" energy.

There's also an AI learning app called BeFreed that's been useful for diving deeper into relationship psychology. It pulls from books like the ones mentioned here, relationship research, and expert interviews to create personalized audio content. 

You can set a learning goal like ""build better communication in my relationship"" or ""understand attachment styles,"" and it generates a structured plan with podcasts tailored to your situation. The depth is adjustable, a 15-minute overview or a 40-minute deep dive with real examples. Plus there's a virtual coach you can chat with about specific struggles, which has been surprisingly helpful for getting clarity on patterns that come up during check-ins.

**talk about logistics without resentment.** who's handling what this week? what needs to get done? sounds boring but unspoken expectations about household stuff cause 70% of relationship arguments according to research. get it out in the open. renegotiate. this isn't about keeping score, it's about being a functional team.

**end with connection.** physical touch, a few minutes of just being together, or planning something you're both looking forward to. you want your brain to associate these check-ins with positive feelings, not just problem-solving mode.

**The Relationship Cure by John Gottman** is the technical manual for this work. Gottman's the researcher who studied thousands of couples and identified the patterns that predict success versus failure. this book specifically focuses on ""emotional bids,"" those small moments of connection that either build or erode relationships. it's research-heavy but translated into practical actions. the weekly check-in framework is basically an application of his decades of relationship lab studies. utterly fascinating read if you're into understanding the mechanics of human connection.

some people think scheduling relationship talks kills spontaneity. that's backwards. when you have a designated time for difficult conversations, you stop bringing them up during random moments when your partner's stressed or tired or just got home. you stop walking around with unspoken tension. the rest of your time together becomes MORE spontaneous because you're not carrying around resentment.

the real magic happens around month three of doing this consistently. you start catching patterns. you develop your own shorthand. you build trust that issues will be addressed so you don't have to bring them up immediately. your relationship stops feeling like something that just happens to you and starts feeling like something you're both intentionally creating.

it's not complicated. it's just consistent. and consistency is the thing most relationships lack because everyone's winging it and hoping for the best. hope is not a strategy.",2,1769839832.0,BuildToAttract,0,1.0,False

I stare at the paper pinned to the old style bulletin board. The bold, uppercase letters and dramatic exclamation marks taunt me. I shut my eyes, drag a hand over my face, and sigh. I open my eyes, hoping they’d be gone.

Nope.

***ATTENTION ISAAK!!!!!!***

***In an attempt to boost our numbers, we’ve opened up an intern program!***  
***So, it is with GREAT PRIDE!!! That I announce that YOU!!!!! Will be the first employee to work with an INTERN!!!!!!*** ***CONGRATULATIONS!!!!!!!!***

***Sincerely, Management.***

The damn thing is covered in doodles of party balloons and confetti. I turn around, tail snapping with annoyance. I grab a mug and place it beneath the coffee pot. My ear flicks, I can hear Deckard try to be sneaky as he stares at me. I ignore him, fighting yet another sigh.

“...Hey Isaak,” he whispers, eyes dilating. I close my eyes before turning to look at him, forcing a tolerant expression.

“Hi, Boss.” Deckard hops out of his ‘hiding’ place and bounds over.

“Did you read the letter?” He bites his lip. I take a silent, deep breath through my nose.

“Mhm.” I huff. He grins and opens his mouth to speak, but is interrupted as the coffee machine squeals and groans in that mechanical, nails-on-a-chalkboard tone. He stares at it, green eyes watching patiently.

“...your coffee’s done,” he mumbles. I understand why, even if I think it’s dumb. The silence in the breakroom that comes after that horrific sound has always had a strange sense of sanctity to it, for whatever reason. My jaw tenses. I wrap my tail around the mug’s handle, removing it from the borderline biohazard of a drip tray. “Yes, it is. Thank you, Deckard.”

As I turn to take a sip, I can hear Deckard’s claws scrape against the linoleum flooring. When I turn back, Deckard isn’t alone anymore. He’s standing next to a tall, skinny kid who couldn’t be much older than-maybe 18,000 years old, give or take. Somehow, someway, Deckard manages to become even more happy. As if being the personification of the word wasn’t already enough.

“WHAT? I’M TAKING THE INTERN TODAY?!” I snarl, eyes wide. My tail lashes before I can stop it, flinging hot coffee everywhere. The kid flinches, but Deckard doesn’t do anything but pout slightly at the coffee on the walls, no doubt already staining the pitiful paint job.

“SO! This is Ezekiel, your brand new intern! You’ll show him the ropes of our incredible company eventually, but for today, just…Show him around and explain the rules! And I think it’d be best if you two train for a few months before you take him to the field.” Deckard turns to Ezekiel, gripping his shoulders firmly. “This is Isaak, your new mentor! I hope you two get along well!” Then, underneath his breath he adds, “because we don’t have anyone else to mentor you…”

\*\*\* 

I smooth my inky black hair back, trying to get the two flyaways to settle behind my horns. I roll my sleeves up as the two men chatter. Or, well…one man chatters. The other is just trying his best not to swing. My tail flicks before coiling neatly around my ankle twice. I wait for the interaction to end.

“You’re lucky I care too damn much about this screwed company, otherwise I’d have already punted this runt through the front door.” Isaak snarls, slamming the mug he’d held with his tail onto the counter so hard a crack splinters up the side.

Deckard clasps his hands together, claws scraping ineffectively against the thick skin on the back of his hands. I study them, neatly filing away the little details. He’s clearly worked with his hands at some point in his life, as they’re decorated with scattered scars. His skin, where it remains unmarred beneath the dirt and grease, is a greyish green hue. His palms are lighter than the rest of his skin, closer to a minty color and he has darker green ticked stripes on his forearms, which fade as they near his hands.

“Isn’t that right, Ezekiel?” I jump as my attention is forcibly snapped away from Deckard’s hands by the owner himself. My ear twitches and I blink, refocusing my vision. I glance at Deckard, then at Isaak, who is noticeably calmer.

“I’m sorry, I didn’t hear you. What was that, Sir?” I ask, keeping my voice polite. Deckard chuckles good naturedly, which I find strange. I hadn’t said anything funny, had I?

“Oh, Ezekiel, you,” Deckard grins, ruffling my hair, forcing it out of the professional slick back I’d spent hours forming. “I was just saying how badly you want to work here, especially under Izzy!” The mentioned man scowls, tail cracking like a whip. I blink, my brow furrowing slightly.

“Yes, that’s correct. I believe I’ll be well-suited for your organization, and can’t wait to see what I learn beneath you.” I nod. Isaak stares at me, the silence in the room pregnant. His eyes are a confusing muddle of emotions I can’t quite make out. I feel my muscles constrict. Suddenly, his golden orange eyes snap up to Deckard as he bares his cuspids.

“You know better than this, Deck.” He mutters. His voice is somewhere low, in the back of his throat which emits a growl. My ears pin back slightly. This doesn’t feel like a conversation I should be witnessing. It’s like hearing your parents stressing about overdue rent. I excuse myself and head outside, where I settle on the curb. I wrap my tail around myself thrice, resting my chin on my knees. What had Isaak meant? Did he, like Housemother Serenity, think I was too young? What had he been searching for in my eyes? I shudder at the thought of the moment, straightening my back. I remove my phone from my pocket, unfolding it to open the camera. I use it in an attempt to salvage my hair, frowning at Deckard’s carelessness.

I don’t know how long I’d been outside when I hear the scrape of claws on pavement behind me and Isaak settles at my side. We remain silent, and I glance at him through the corner of my eye. He digs in his jacket pocket, grabbing a flask. When he opens it a rough, acidic scent assaults my nose. He lifts it to his lips and takes a long gulp, some of the dark brown liquid trickles from the corner of his lip, running through his scruff and down his throat. He wordlessly offers it to me, which I decline.

“I mean this with all due respect, but what is that? Smells like something died.” I cough, waving the scent away from my face. He chuckles, the sound a deep rumble in his chest.

“It’s called Jagermeister, kid. Smart to decline. This shit’ll send your primocardium into the nineteenth dimension.” He grins, keeping his face forward. I realize his left horn-the side closest to me-has been snapped at some point, close to the base. Most of his dusky blonde hair keeps the fracture hidden. His tail rattles against the pavement of the road, and I notice he’s got tail spikes. The genetic probability of that is so low, and I can feel a hint of envy swirl in my chest.

“You drink alcohol in the workplace? Doesn’t that violate something?” I ask, tilting my head. Isaak nods, taking yet another gulp. He smiles again, finally shifting to address me properly. “Course I do. And once you realize how between the courts we are, you’ll realize everything we do violates something, somewhere.” He barks a full, genuine laugh. I frown, tail constricting slightly.

“You know what we do here, right?” He asks as he sobers.

“Yes, sir.”

“And you realize that you can’t…You realize what we do is permanent. And ruins people’s lives.” He’s serious, unblinking as he meets my ice blue eyes.

“I know that.” I admit, also serious. My voice is soft, carrying the deep tones necessary for the situation.

“You’re not going to change your mind?”

I nod.

I want people to be really honest in here about what they actually do with their toddler on a normal day. I'm feeling increasingly guilty as in our down time I feel like she just exists around me and I just scroll mindlessly on my phone around doing housework and catering to her needs/playing. She still naps 2hrs in the middle of the day. 

I work 2 days a week (Mon/Tues) in a highly physical and mentally demanding job & she's in childcare those days, 8-10 hours a day. On Wednesdays we do KinderGym in the mornings and then usually pop to the shops together to run errands and get a babycino before getting home just in time for her nap, the afternoon we just hang at home after her nap. Thursdays we do a morning sporting activity with her friend & after that we go for a walk with them to get coffee, again just getting home in home for her nap and hanging at home in the afternoon. Friday is a free day where I'll usually pop out to the shops/playground with her in the morning, and my mum always comes to see her for a few hours in the afternoon. Saturdays my husband takes her swimming early in the morning, comes home in time for a nap, then we just hang out in the afternoon or he takes her to see his family if he's home. Sundays are usually entirely free and we'll often just spend the day at home. 

She has an entire playroom that she will play in and we'll play in with her too. But often I'll just hope she goes and plays by herself because I don't have the energy or desire to play with her. My husband will play with her for much longer than I do when he's home (split weeks of days & afternoons with his shift work.) The other thing is, I find that by 4pm I'm just popping on the TV (& she's asking for it by that time too.) 

I feel awful that when we're at home I'm just inclined to play with her for like an hour, then just chuck on the TV. I feel like I'm not doing enough. But I also feel like I need to defend myself and explain that I do majority of mornings by myself, & 50% of bedtimes. So I want to know what everyone else is doing because I feel AWFUL & like I'm not getting her outside enough to parks and to ride her bike etc in our free time.

I’m a first-year college student, and I’m confused about a situation with a senior girl (second year). She’s also a classmate of one of my close friends.
About a week ago, I was doing recruitment rounds for my college club, visiting different classes. In one class, I noticed a girl sitting on the first bench who kept staring at me. We made repeated eye contact, smiled, and laughed during the presentation. It felt mutual.

After the class, I waited outside for her and asked for her Instagram. She gave it to me. That night, we started texting, and the conversation quickly turned flirty (which she initiated). She complimented my eyes, my dressing sense, and said my eyes distracted her during the presentation. I complimented her face piercings.

Then she suddenly ghosted me for around 24 hours. Later, she replied saying she was busy and had slept all day. I let it slide.

When we met in college, I found out she drinks heavily and smokes a lot. I quit drinking a year ago and smoke very rarely, so this was a big turn-off for me. Before knowing this, I was honestly pretty obsessed with her, but after that, I mentally decided not to take things seriously. Still, we hung out, had coffee, talked for about an hour, and she kept complimenting me.

Later, I asked her directly if she saw our hangout as a date. She said no and that she just saw us as friends. That confused me, but I accepted it and thought I should back off.

The next day, I stopped initiating conversations. She ended up asking me to meet again. This time, she initiated holding hands, rested her head on my shoulder, and acted very affectionate. Later, she flirted heavily over text again. For context, she’s about two years older than me i called her mommy and all she called me her little boy etc etc .

I also found out from my friend (who’s in her class) that she had a breakup about 1–1.5 months ago not sure about this information though 

Now I’m in a weird place. I don’t really see this going anywhere serious due to lifestyle differences and mixed signals, but I feel like I’m slowly getting attached. I’m scared that if this continues, I might get emotionally invested and end up hurt.

I’m a first-year college student, and I’m confused about a situation with a senior girl (second year). She’s also a classmate of one of my close friends.
About a week ago, I was doing recruitment rounds for my college club, visiting different classes. In one class, I noticed a girl sitting on the first bench who kept staring at me. We made repeated eye contact, smiled, and laughed during the presentation. It felt mutual.

After the class, I waited outside for her and asked for her Instagram. She gave it to me. That night, we started texting, and the conversation quickly turned flirty (which she initiated). She complimented my eyes, my dressing sense, and said my eyes distracted her during the presentation. I complimented her face piercings.

Then she suddenly ghosted me for around 24 hours. Later, she replied saying she was busy and had slept all day. I let it slide.

When we met in college, I found out she drinks heavily and smokes a lot. I quit drinking a year ago and smoke very rarely, so this was a big turn-off for me.

There's alot of mining shit in his house, a large specimen collection (he was a geologist by day) and some other very sketchy shit I don't even know where to begin with. I would love to know what pile this particular un-named jar goes on ( dangerous, mildly illegal, very illegal, worth something, morally questionable, interesting but worthless and straight trash).

Hit her up for coffee. We had coffee. Went well. Talked for 3 hours. Some red flags. Talked about other guys hitting her up and someone wanting her to be their mistress and she be a sugar baby.

Ignored that but in the back of my mind. Went well. She messaged afterwards regarding a work project and said she would love to see it.

Before our date, saw her a few times and she asked me if I’m married, or have kids or the type of person I’m looking for. Seems like personal info.

After the coffee date, barely talked and coffee was a week ago so hit her up for dinner. She said she busy this weekend and told me some dates she busy this month because birthday or travel so I suggested a weekday. She said she doesn’t want to confirm but will let me know closer to it. In my head if she’s interested but busy, she would suggest a day that works? 

Why like my stories and message me now and then? Mixed signals?

Supposedly she busy today but she not fully viewing my stories anymore, just sliding through after the first story. Before she’s like it or watch through all of my stories.

Three weeks passed in a blur of schoolwork and training sessions. To Percy's surprise, he actually looked forward to Clarisse's visits. She was still abrasive and pushed him harder than he thought necessary, but there was something oddly comforting about her straightforward approach. No hidden agendas, no false praise—just brutal honesty and the occasional grudging nod when he got something right.

His mother had taken to Clarisse in a way that baffled Percy. She always made extra food, asked about her day, and sometimes just sat with her, talking quietly while Percy finished his homework. Once, he'd caught Clarisse helping his mom wash dishes—a surreal sight that made him question everything he thought he knew about the intimidating girl.

It was Friday afternoon when everything changed.

Percy was walking home from detention—courtesy of Mrs. Dodds, his pre-algebra teacher, who seemed to have a personal vendetta against him—when he spotted Clarisse leaning against a lamppost outside his apartment building.

""You're late,"" she said by way of greeting.

""Detention,"" Percy explained, adjusting his backpack. ""Mrs. Dodds again.""

Something flickered across Clarisse's face. ""Mrs. Dodds? The substitute teacher?""

""She's been there all year,"" Percy frowned.

Clarisse grabbed his arm. ""No, she hasn't. Your pre-algebra teacher is Mr. Nicoll.""

""What? No, it's—"" Percy stopped, suddenly uncertain. He had clear memories of Mrs. Dodds, but something felt off, like trying to recall a dream.

""We need to talk to your mom,"" Clarisse said urgently, pulling him toward the building.

They were halfway up the stairs when they heard it—a crash from above, followed by Sally's scream.

Percy bolted up the remaining steps, Clarisse right behind him. The door to their apartment stood ajar, splintered around the lock.

""Mom!"" Percy shouted, rushing inside.

The living room was in chaos. The coffee table was overturned, and there was a large, hulking figure looming over Sally, who was pressed against the kitchen doorway. It wasn't Gabe—this thing was much bigger, with shoulders too broad to be human.

""Percy, run!"" Sally screamed when she saw him.

The figure turned, and Percy's brain struggled to process what he was seeing. The man—if it was a man—had a face like weathered leather, but his eyes glowed red in the dim apartment. His arms were corded with muscles that seemed to ripple unnaturally beneath his skin.

""There you are, godling,"" the creature growled, his voice like gravel. ""I've been waiting.""

Percy stood frozen, but Clarisse was already moving. She shoved Percy aside and reached into her jacket, pulling out what looked like a collapsible baton. With a flick of her wrist, it extended—not into a baton, but into a spear that crackled with electricity at its tip.

""Laistrygonian,"" she spat. ""Should have known they'd find you eventually.""

The creature laughed, a sound like breaking stones. ""Daughter of Ares, your father sends children to do his dirty work now?""

""Percy, get your mom and get out,"" Clarisse ordered, her stance widening as she faced the monster. ""Now!""

Percy finally broke from his stupor and rushed to his mother's side. ""Mom, are you hurt?""

Sally's eyes were wide with terror, but she shook her head. ""We need to leave, Percy. It's time—it's happening sooner than I thought. —""

The monster lunged at Clarisse, who rolled aside with surprising agility and jabbed her spear into its thigh. Electricity arced across the creature's body, and it roared in pain.

""You'll pay for that, half-blood!"" it snarled, ripping a chunk of drywall from the ceiling and hurling it at her.

Clarisse ducked, out of pure instinct, riposting, buying more time for Percy and Sally to get out of there, whilst simultaneously backing toward the door.

1qru5fe,https://www.reddit.com/r/inlaws/comments/1qru5fe/buying_a_first_house_and_getting_pressured_to/,Buying a first house and getting pressured to live on same street as in-laws,"Last year I moved to Italy for my work and fell in love with an Italian man. I am now pregnant with our first child and we have been married for 6 months. My parents live in France and I see them about once or twice a year. His parents live in Milan and we see them around once a week. Right now, they actually live 5 minutes away, but this was by pure coincidence. When my husband and got serious he moved in with me, and I was renting an apartment that happened to be close to his parents. Since I fell pregnant invitations from the in-laws ramped up to significantly, and I can only see this trend continuing once the baby arrives. While I like both his parents and find them to be polite, kind, and mature people, I occasionally feel suffocated by the calls to step out of coffee, have dinner, show off my baby bump to friends/extended family. It also doesn’t help I don’t speak Italian well yet, although I want to continue to improve, sometimes I don’t have the energy after working long hours to dive into my foreign language learning. This is probably a personal defect.

Both our parents have now given some money to put towards purchasing our first family home (we are very fortunate.) The contribution from my parents is larger by 25%. This is the savings from their hard work over many years that they want to offer to me and my husband. 

My husband and I never argued but when it came time to start the house search we quickly came into conflict. His parents are constantly sending him listings ON THE SAME STREET as them. Meanwhile, my parents have had zero input and are leaving all the decision making up to us.

Milan is a very expensive city. I like the area we currently rent and where my in laws live because it is central and close to the major park of Milan. It’s a beautiful location. However, it is also the most expensive location in Milan to buy a house. We have looked at several houses in this location but they have all been over budget and would require us to take out a huge long term mortgage. My husband’s father dismissed these concerns when I brought them up saying we could easily resell a house in this central location and pay off any mortgage balance, so not to worry. At the beginning I sent my husband a lot of listings from a much more unattractive but cheaper area of Milan, in the northern outskirts of the city, close to where I work. We wouldn’t have to have a huge mortgage and could potentially own the house free and clear within a few years. But I’ve met with a lot of resistance. Eventually I gave up and started sending him listings closer to the city center. It has been very difficult to have a cogent conversation with him about our shared aims when looking for a house, as he seems to value location above all else. 

My husband was living abroad for many years before returning to Milan to work in the family business last year. He has told me he also doesn’t want to be too enmeshed with his family, and sometimes finds it difficult that he works with them and sees them every day. So I assume that he wants this location because it is such a nice area in Milan, not because he wants to be next door to his parents, however they are also definitely exerting some pressure to continue to live close to them. 

When the baby is born we will travel to France and visit my parents. We agreed to pause the house search during this time. However, yesterday his mother saw a sign on her apartment building for a rental of one of the units, and suggested we rent that apartment IN THE SAME BUILDING when we return from France. For some reason, my husband told me about her suggestion. I was taken aback because we were never considering renting and the cost of getting into an apartment in Italy is very high (you pay 2000 euros at least to estate agents just to get into an apartment). I am disturbed that his mother suggested this and that he thought it was a good enough idea to relate it to me.

I should mention that my past relationship ended becuase my ex’s mother could not accept that I was a different race than her and didn’t speak her language and wanted to live with her son in a different country (the country where we met). His father made comments that if we had children the children wouldn’t be part of his family becuase I was the wrong race (fyi they were Korean.) He was unable to stand up to them and defend me so I left. 

My new in laws are completely different, have always been kind and accepting and helpful towards me. However I don’t like their over involvement in the house buying process, and mostly I’m disappointed in my husband because I feel like he is not approaching this big step rationally, looking at the financial pros and cons, but emotionally, and is too easily swayed by his parents opinions.

How can I talk to him and bluntly say I don’t want to continue to live next door to his parents without offending him? Am I right to think it’s a bit unhealthy and not a good reason to buy a house in a certain location? I am currently 37 weeks pregnant and I just don’t want all this added stress and pressure.

1qrtw6n,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1qrtw6n/the_cold_within/,The Cold Within,"I first noticed the cold when my teeth started clicking while I was brushing my teeth.  
My jaw was chattering really hard, and I had to stop and steady myself over the sink.  
I spat, rinsed, and stood there with the tap running, staring at my own face in the mirror.  
The mirror held a faint haze, even though I had not taken a shower.

I walked out into the hallway and checked the thermostat. Seventy five. The heat was on, and I could hear the fan running.  
I put my hand over the vent in the living room. Warm air came out. So far so good, it was working.  
And yet the apartment still felt wrong, as though there was a window left open to let in the draft.

I decided to check, starting with the balcony door seal, running my palm along the edges. Nothing.  
I tried the bedroom window latch next. It was locked tight. Then the front door frame.  
But I found nothing that explained why the cold stayed on my skin.

I told myself it was one of those winter days when the building just hadn’t caught up yet, even with the heat running.

It was an easy explanation to accept.  
Until I made coffee.

I poured it and wrapped my hands around the mug, waiting for that familiar warmth.  
The mug was hot. I could feel it, but my palms stayed cold anyway, and when I set the mug down, a faint white ring appeared on the table, like breath on glass.  
I tried wiping it off with my thumb and noticed that it didn’t smear. It looked more like frost.  
I stared at it for a while, then shrugged it off.

Then I set the mug back down in the same place, held it there with my hands, and counted to ten.  
When I lifted it again, the ring was back.  
I leaned closer and saw tiny crystals forming along the edge, grainy and pale.

My first thought was that the table was cold.  
That didn’t hold up, because the table was inside a heated apartment.

After deciding I had wasted enough time, I pulled my hoodie tighter and went back to work.

Working from home usually suits me. No commute, especially with the snow, and I never cared for small talk with other people, be it at work or otherwise.  
That morning I couldn’t settle. Small things kept pulling at my attention.  
My fingertips felt numb on the keyboard. The touchpad lagged under my palm. I kept lifting my hand and rubbing it, trying to bring feeling back.

Every time I exhaled, my breath showed.  
That shouldn’t be happening.

I stood up and went back to the thermostat. Put my hand under the vent again and felt the warm, steady air.  
Well, this was weird. Why did I still feel cold?

I grabbed a blanket from the cupboard, wrapped it around my shoulders, and tried to warm myself.  
I picked up my phone and called security to send maintenance. When he asked for the reason, I said there was a leak somewhere in my apartment letting in a draft and making the apartment cold.

Sean from maintenance arrived about twenty minutes later. He was a big guy and always very polite. I realised what a cliché that was.  
He stepped inside and looked around.

He checked the nearest vent, then the thermostat.

“You’ve got it set to seventy five?” he asked.

“Yeah.”

He shook his head. “You’re trying to cook yourself.”

“It feels cold,” I said, and felt stupid saying so.

He checked the apartment thoroughly in the same way I did. The balcony door seal. The bedroom window. The front door frame.

“No drafts,” he said. “Heat’s working. I can take a reading if you want.”

He pulled out a small infrared thermometer and swept it along the walls, the ceiling, the vent.

“Walls are normal. Ceiling’s normal. Vent’s hot.”  
He spent another couple of minutes looking around and said, “Ma’am, it’s really warm in here. The heater is working fine, and I couldn’t find any leaks. Are you sure you’re not coming down with the flu or something?”

“I’m fine,” I said.

He nodded, then asked me to sign the log sheet.

“Are you sure you’re fine, ma’am?” he asked again.

“I’m fine, just…” I stopped mid sentence as I noticed he was looking at my hands with concern.  
My knuckles were pale, nearly grey, as if the color had drained out.

“Yeah, I might go see a doctor,” I said hurriedly.

“You take care, ma’am,” he said before leaving with the signed log sheet.

I went into the bathroom and ran warm water. Held my hands under it.  
The water felt warm, but my fingers didn’t change.  
I turned it hotter. I felt the sting for just a brief second, and then the cold stayed.

I pulled my hands away and started to wonder what was happening.  
As I was looking at them, I noticed a thin line along the side of my index finger.

A crack.

I pressed my thumb against it. There was no pain, just a dull resistance.  
When I tried to flex the finger, the movement felt slow and stiff, as though something inside was pushing back.

I sat on the edge of the bathtub and stared at my hands, trying to think without letting panic take over.

I called my sister.  
She answered on the second ring, her voice bright as ever.

“Hey Sis! What’s going on?” she asked.

“Can you come over?” I said immediately.

“Are you okay?” she asked, and I could hear the sudden concern in her voice.

“It’s cold in here. Something’s off. I… I can’t really explain it. Please, come soon?”

“Absolutely,” she said quietly. “I’ll just get someone to cover my shift and will be right over.”

I said okay and hung up.

I went back to the living room and turned on the television. I had a bunch of reports to type up, but I just wasn’t feeling up to it.  
One of the perks of being a freelancer, I could work on my own schedule.

Every few minutes, my breath showed again. Each time it did, my attention snapped back to it.  
How was it possible? It just didn’t make sense.

After a few minutes, I started to get the feeling the cold had spread. It wasn’t just in my hands anymore.  
Now I felt it in my chest, and I realised it was getting harder to breathe.

That was when the panic started to set in.

I wrapped myself in another blanket and turned the heat up to eighty.  
The heater kicked harder. The apartment warmed, but the cold within stayed.

I got up and walked to the kitchen, then pressed my palm flat against the wall, just to see what would happen.

When I pulled it away, my handprint remained.

I touched it.  
Frost.

Every finger was outlined. Even the crease of my palm held for a second before it began to fade.  
I stared at it until it disappeared.

Then I touched my own forearm with my other hand.  
The skin felt like a soda can pulled straight from the fridge.

What the hell? My mind scrambled for explanations. Searching on Google didn’t help either.

I went back into the bathroom and lifted my shirt a little, facing the mirror.  
My torso looked pale. The color was gone, drained out evenly.  
My arms, my face, everything looked just like my knuckles did earlier when I signed the log sheet for Sean.

Leaning closer, I saw frost clinging to the fine hair on my arms. It caught the bathroom light and shimmered.  
I pressed two fingers into my stomach.  
The skin resisted.  
It felt hard.  
I tried to pinch it, but my fingers couldn’t get a grip.

I stepped back from the mirror and took a long breath.  
The air left my mouth in a thick cloud.

Then I heard a soft sound. It was a quiet crackle, like ice settling.  
It came from my hand.

I looked down and saw a second crack branching off the first, spreading in a thin line.  
My knees gave out, and I ended up sitting on the bathroom floor, my head spinning while my mind tried to make sense of it all.

After a while, I gathered my thoughts and decided I needed to get out of the room and wait for my sister, maybe call emergency services as well.  
I stood and went for the front door.

My hand closed around the metal knob, and I felt a weird sensation.  
When I pulled, it didn’t turn.  
I tried again, but nothing.

I could feel a tingling on my skin and realised that my skin was getting frozen to the metal knob.

I yanked my hand free. The sound it made was wet and wrong, and for a brief moment I thought my skin might just tear off.  
A thin layer of frost coated the knob now. My palm burned with delayed pain, nerves finally catching up.

I tried again, using my sleeve as a barrier, but the door still wouldn’t open.

It wasn’t just the knob.  
The seam around the door had changed. The narrow gap along the frame was packed with ice now, moisture frozen solid where the door met the wall.  
I stepped back and bumped into the hallway wall. Cold spread into it where my shoulder touched, leaving a darkened patch that slowly crept outward.

The hallway light flickered once.  
I stood there for a couple of minutes, trying not to let my thoughts run ahead of what was actually happening.

Getting to the couch took more effort now. My joints felt stiff and heavy.  
I picked up my phone and tried to type. My fingers moved, but not where I wanted them to. The screen kept slipping under my thumb.

I managed to call my sister again.  
She answered right away, out of breath.

“I’m below your building,” she said. “I’m coming up now. What’s going on in there?”

“I can’t open the door,” I said. The words felt slow leaving my mouth.

“What do you mean you can’t open it?”

“The door’s frozen,” I said.

“Wait, let me come up,” she said, and the line went dead.

I could picture her running up the stairs instead of waiting for the lift.  
A couple of minutes later, I heard her footsteps in the hallway, fast and uneven.  
She called my name, then swore under her breath.

“The handle is freezing,” she said through the door. “There’s ice all around the frame. What’s going on, sis?”

“Don’t touch it,” I tried to shout, but my voice came out thin and uneven.

My phone buzzed again somewhere near me. I knew it was my sister, but I didn’t have the strength to reach for it.

I wanted to tell her not to touch anything. Not the knob. Not the door. And definitely not me.  
The cold that was inside me was now spreading outward to whatever I touched.

But no words came through.  
My tongue felt thick.

When I finally did reach for the phone, it slipped from my hand and hit the floor.  
I tried to pick it up.  
My fingers curved, but they didn’t close.

The cracks had spread across my knuckles and the backs of my hands. It now felt like I was fighting a losing battle.  
My skin had a dull sheen to it. Smooth and hard.

As I looked at my hands, the song by Foreigner drifted into my head.  
The line where he says, “You’re as cold as ice.”

I let out a short, breathless laugh at the irony of the situation.

I could feel a heavy tiredness settling into me.  
I leaned back and stared at the ceiling.

Frost crept outward from the vent above me, spreading slowly.  
The heater was still running. I could hear it working.  
But it was going to have a hard time fixing the temperature now.

The sound of my sister knocking reached me again, muffled and distant, like it was coming through a thick wall.

“Can you hear me?” she called.

I tried to answer, but I just couldn’t.

Her voice began to fade away as I could feel my senses dulling.  
I thought I heard keys. Did she call the building security?  
There was a faint scrape at the lock.

Then nothing.  
No click or movement.  
Just the quiet and the song in my head, “You’re as cold as ice.”

My eyes drifted to the coffee table.  
The mug was still there.  
The frost ring beneath it had thickened into a solid circle of ice, smooth and unbroken.

I watched it as my vision started to blur and my breathing started to slow.

I didn’t feel panic at the end.  
I felt cold.

And the cold felt steady. As though it had always been there, just waiting for the rest of me to catch up.

The last thing I remember is thinking about my sister standing on the other side of the door, her hand near the handle, feeling the unnatural chill that was emanating from inside the apartment.

[Changing your habits?](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskMenAdvice/comments/1qpm7ax/changing_your_habits/)

So, I did talk to him when he got home from work. I had commented that he'd been consistently drinking coffee in the morning, and I was curious as to why he had begun drinking coffee each morning.

He told me he started adding up the cost of all the soda and energy drinks he had been consuming and realized how much he had been spending to keep awake at work. And having coffee at home was way cheaper.

Now, my husband has a sweet tooth. A large sweet tooth. I try not to keep sweets in the house because our willpower is weak, his and mine. I also know I find candy wrappers in the cars and cookies in the cabinet, so I wondered how he was managing a drink that rarely gets described as sweet.

So, I went to look at his coffee and smiled. He's got a mocha peppermint and a vanilla described as sweet and creamy. I imagine that calling what he drinks coffee would be a stretch of that word.

So, yes, he changed his habit for economic reasons, but not a drastic one.

It was nice to hear all opinions on this topic, though. I also liked those who provided their own story of changing their coffee habits.",1,1769837816.0,AskMenAdvice,6,0.67,False

The water felt warm, but my fingers didn’t change.  
I turned it hotter. I felt the sting for just a brief second, and then the cold stayed.

I pulled my hands away and started to wonder what was happening.  
As I was looking at them, I noticed a thin line along the side of my index finger.

A crack.

I pressed my thumb against it. There was no pain, just a dull resistance.  
When I tried to flex the finger, the movement felt slow and stiff, as though something inside was pushing back.

I sat on the edge of the bathtub and stared at my hands, trying to think without letting panic take over.

I called my sister.  
She answered on the second ring, her voice bright as ever.

“Hey Sis! What’s going on?” she asked.

“Can you come over?” I said immediately.

“Are you okay?” she asked, and I could hear the sudden concern in her voice.

“It’s cold in here. Something’s off. I… I can’t really explain it. Please, come soon?”

“Absolutely,” she said quietly. “I’ll just get someone to cover my shift and will be right over.”

I said okay and hung up.

I went back to the living room and turned on the television. I had a bunch of reports to type up, but I just wasn’t feeling up to it.  
One of the perks of being a freelancer, I could work on my own schedule.

Every few minutes, my breath showed again. Each time it did, my attention snapped back to it.  
How was it possible? It just didn’t make sense.

After a few minutes, I started to get the feeling the cold had spread. It wasn’t just in my hands anymore.  
Now I felt it in my chest, and I realised it was getting harder to breathe.

That was when the panic started to set in.

I wrapped myself in another blanket and turned the heat up to eighty.  
The heater kicked harder. The apartment warmed, but the cold within stayed.

I got up and walked to the kitchen, then pressed my palm flat against the wall, just to see what would happen.

When I pulled it away, my handprint remained.

I touched it.  
Frost.

Every finger was outlined. Even the crease of my palm held for a second before it began to fade.  
I stared at it until it disappeared.

Then I touched my own forearm with my other hand.  
The skin felt like a soda can pulled straight from the fridge.

What the hell? My mind scrambled for explanations. Searching on Google didn’t help either.

I went back into the bathroom and lifted my shirt a little, facing the mirror.  
My torso looked pale. The color was gone, drained out evenly.  
My arms, my face, everything looked just like my knuckles did earlier when I signed the log sheet for Sean.

Leaning closer, I saw frost clinging to the fine hair on my arms. It caught the bathroom light and shimmered.  
I pressed two fingers into my stomach.  
The skin resisted.  
It felt hard.  
I tried to pinch it, but my fingers couldn’t get a grip.

I stepped back from the mirror and took a long breath.  
The air left my mouth in a thick cloud.

Then I heard a soft sound. It was a quiet crackle, like ice settling.  
It came from my hand.

I looked down and saw a second crack branching off the first, spreading in a thin line.  
My knees gave out, and I ended up sitting on the bathroom floor, my head spinning while my mind tried to make sense of it all.

After a while, I gathered my thoughts and decided I needed to get out of the room and wait for my sister, maybe call emergency services as well.  
I stood and went for the front door.

My hand closed around the metal knob, and I felt a weird sensation.  
When I pulled, it didn’t turn.  
I tried again, but nothing.

I could feel a tingling on my skin and realised that my skin was getting frozen to the metal knob.

I yanked my hand free. The sound it made was wet and wrong, and for a brief moment I thought my skin might just tear off.  
A thin layer of frost coated the knob now. My palm burned with delayed pain, nerves finally catching up.

I tried again, using my sleeve as a barrier, but the door still wouldn’t open.

It wasn’t just the knob.  
The seam around the door had changed. The narrow gap along the frame was packed with ice now, moisture frozen solid where the door met the wall.  
I stepped back and bumped into the hallway wall. Cold spread into it where my shoulder touched, leaving a darkened patch that slowly crept outward.

The hallway light flickered once.  
I stood there for a couple of minutes, trying not to let my thoughts run ahead of what was actually happening.

Getting to the couch took more effort now. My joints felt stiff and heavy.  
I picked up my phone and tried to type. My fingers moved, but not where I wanted them to. The screen kept slipping under my thumb.

I managed to call my sister again.  
She answered right away, out of breath.

“I’m below your building,” she said. “I’m coming up now. What’s going on in there?”

“I can’t open the door,” I said. The words felt slow leaving my mouth.

“What do you mean you can’t open it?”

“The door’s frozen,” I said.

“Wait, let me come up,” she said, and the line went dead.

I could picture her running up the stairs instead of waiting for the lift.  
A couple of minutes later, I heard her footsteps in the hallway, fast and uneven.  
She called my name, then swore under her breath.

“The handle is freezing,” she said through the door. “There’s ice all around the frame. What’s going on, sis?”

“Don’t touch it,” I tried to shout, but my voice came out thin and uneven.

My phone buzzed again somewhere near me. I knew it was my sister, but I didn’t have the strength to reach for it.

I wanted to tell her not to touch anything. Not the knob. Not the door. And definitely not me.  
The cold that was inside me was now spreading outward to whatever I touched.

But no words came through.  
My tongue felt thick.

When I finally did reach for the phone, it slipped from my hand and hit the floor.  
I tried to pick it up.  
My fingers curved, but they didn’t close.

The cracks had spread across my knuckles and the backs of my hands. It now felt like I was fighting a losing battle.  
My skin had a dull sheen to it. Smooth and hard.

As I looked at my hands, the song by Foreigner drifted into my head.  
The line where he says, “You’re as cold as ice.”

I let out a short, breathless laugh at the irony of the situation.

I could feel a heavy tiredness settling into me.  
I leaned back and stared at the ceiling.

Frost crept outward from the vent above me, spreading slowly.  
The heater was still running. I could hear it working.  
But it was going to have a hard time fixing the temperature now.

The sound of my sister knocking reached me again, muffled and distant, like it was coming through a thick wall.

“Can you hear me?” she called.

I tried to answer, but I just couldn’t.

Her voice began to fade away as I could feel my senses dulling.  
I thought I heard keys. Did she call the building security?  
There was a faint scrape at the lock.

Then nothing.  
No click or movement.  
Just the quiet and the song in my head, “You’re as cold as ice.”

My eyes drifted to the coffee table.  
The mug was still there.  
The frost ring beneath it had thickened into a solid circle of ice, smooth and unbroken.

I watched it as my vision started to blur and my breathing started to slow.

I didn’t feel panic at the end.  
I felt cold.

And the cold felt steady. As though it had always been there, just waiting for the rest of me to catch up.

The last thing I remember is thinking about my sister standing on the other side of the door, her hand near the handle, feeling the unnatural chill that was emanating from inside the apartment.",4,1769837670.0,scarystories,1,1.0,False

1qrtu63,https://www.reddit.com/r/l4l/comments/1qrtu63/f23_f4f_texas_femme_lesbian/,F23 [F4F] #Texas. Femme lesbian,"A little about me:
~~~~~~~~~~~~

I'm Lemon (nickname obvi), nice to meet ya. I'm your typical local cottagecore lesbian, cardigans are the g.o.a.t. Speaking of goats I'm a Capricorn, so I'm as loyal as they come, plus I'm hilarious. I have a very niche collection of unhinged memes, and I think each of them are comedy gold.I'm definitely the artsy type, an art nerd if u will. The crafting Gods have me in a chokehold. Also, I love gardening, currently my aloe is making babies like crazy. Currently I am obsessed with this mobile game called Heartopia, you can have pets on there, and I have a dog named Orange juice and a cat named Apple juice . I have four parakeets, and they are my whole world. And I can and will spam pictures of them.

Pros of dating me:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

• One of the ways I show my affection is being consistent. So you'll always have a good morning or good night text waiting for you. 

• I've been through years of therapy and i know how to handle conflict. Not to toot my own horn ,but I think I'm pretty emotionally mature.

• I'm autistic and because of that I am very upfront and honest. There is no guesswork if I am mad I will tell you. My intentions are always very clear ,because I will tell you.

• I'm not the insecure type, I'm very confident in myself and in my decisions. 

• I will never expect something from you that I'm not able/ willing to do. Unless it's like opening a jar, because I have the grip strength of a toddler.
 
Cons of dating me:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

• I'm autistic, it's a pro and a con honestly. I won't be able to go to loud concerts or loud places in general. So if that's your vibe I'm probably not the one for you. 

• I have a condition called hypermobility/ eds, it's a genetic condition which affects my soft tissues ,it causes dislocations. There's no cure for it, it will never get better. So if you're someone who likes to hike, or things like that I'm probably not the one for you. I do like going on walks though.

• There will be no hanky panky before 6 months of dating. And 6 months is the absolute bare minimum. So assume longer.

• STD tests will be a mandatory non negotiable. Obviously I will get tested too and give you the results.

• I'm chubby.

• I definitely do not prefer texting, I find it very tedious, honestly. All of my friends and family know if you need to get in contact with me just call me. A lot of the times I'm just hyperfocused on whatever project /game I'm working on / playing . And if I don't pick up I'm busy, not because imma mad.

What I'm looking for/ Not looking for:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

• Body type doesn't really matter to me be chubby, skinny, fat idc, I just like women.

• I tend to prefer more Butch/masc looking women. Or someone with a different style than me (ex: goth, alt, decora, etc..)

• Age 20-34 if you are under the age of 20 please don't message me.

• A long term monogamous relationship, with the end goal of marriage. ( I date to marry, ikik very outdated. It's what I prefer, it's a non negotiable ).

• Shared experience is extremely important to me. Due to that I'm Les4Les only. Therefore, I'm only interested in cis and trans lesbian women only. 

• No kids. I'm unsure if I want kids in the future. Even if I did though I don't want bio kids.

• I prefer women on the nerdier side, it's not like a requirement tho.

• No drugs (including weed, vaping, or cigarettes). I don't do any of those and expect my partner not to either.

Date ideas:
~~~~~~~~

• A sketchbook date at a cozy coffee shop.

• A lil thrift date, let's find cute shirts together.

• A picnic in a field of flowers, and I can make u a cute flower crown.
 

So yeah if you like my intro/ dating ad thing feel free to message me. And if not I wish you luck in your romantic endeavors.",1,1769837652.0,l4l,0,1.0,False

1qrtrnb,https://www.reddit.com/r/stories/comments/1qrtrnb/the_cold_within/,The Cold Within,"I first noticed the cold when my teeth started clicking while I was brushing my teeth.  
My jaw was chattering really hard, and I had to stop and steady myself over the sink.  
I spat, rinsed, and stood there with the tap running, staring at my own face in the mirror.  
The mirror held a faint haze, even though I had not taken a shower.

I walked out into the hallway and checked the thermostat. Seventy five. The heat was on, and I could hear the fan running.  
I put my hand over the vent in the living room. Warm air came out. So far so good, it was working.  
And yet the apartment still felt wrong, as though there was a window left open to let in the draft.

I decided to check, starting with the balcony door seal, running my palm along the edges. Nothing.  
I tried the bedroom window latch next. It was locked tight. Then the front door frame.  
But I found nothing that explained why the cold stayed on my skin.

I told myself it was one of those winter days when the building just hadn’t caught up yet, even with the heat running.

It was an easy explanation to accept.  
Until I made coffee.

I poured it and wrapped my hands around the mug, waiting for that familiar warmth.  
The mug was hot. I could feel it, but my palms stayed cold anyway, and when I set the mug down, a faint white ring appeared on the table, like breath on glass.  
I tried wiping it off with my thumb and noticed that it didn’t smear. It looked more like frost.  
I stared at it for a while, then shrugged it off.

Then I set the mug back down in the same place, held it there with my hands, and counted to ten.  
When I lifted it again, the ring was back.  
I leaned closer and saw tiny crystals forming along the edge, grainy and pale.

My first thought was that the table was cold.  
That didn’t hold up, because the table was inside a heated apartment.

After deciding I had wasted enough time, I pulled my hoodie tighter and went back to work.

Working from home usually suits me. No commute, especially with the snow, and I never cared for small talk with other people, be it at work or otherwise.  
That morning I couldn’t settle. Small things kept pulling at my attention.  
My fingertips felt numb on the keyboard. The touchpad lagged under my palm. I kept lifting my hand and rubbing it, trying to bring feeling back.

Every time I exhaled, my breath showed.  
That shouldn’t be happening.

I stood up and went back to the thermostat. Put my hand under the vent again and felt the warm, steady air.  
Well, this was weird. Why did I still feel cold?

I grabbed a blanket from the cupboard, wrapped it around my shoulders, and tried to warm myself.  
I picked up my phone and called security to send maintenance. When he asked for the reason, I said there was a leak somewhere in my apartment letting in a draft and making the apartment cold.

Sean from maintenance arrived about twenty minutes later. He was a big guy and always very polite. I realised what a cliché that was.  
He stepped inside and looked around.

He checked the nearest vent, then the thermostat.

“You’ve got it set to seventy five?” he asked.

“Yeah.”

He shook his head. “You’re trying to cook yourself.”

“It feels cold,” I said, and felt stupid saying so.

He checked the apartment thoroughly in the same way I did. The balcony door seal. The bedroom window. The front door frame.

“No drafts,” he said. “Heat’s working. I can take a reading if you want.”

He pulled out a small infrared thermometer and swept it along the walls, the ceiling, the vent.

“Walls are normal. Ceiling’s normal. Vent’s hot.”  
He spent another couple of minutes looking around and said, “Ma’am, it’s really warm in here. The heater is working fine, and I couldn’t find any leaks. Are you sure you’re not coming down with the flu or something?”

“I’m fine,” I said.

He nodded, then asked me to sign the log sheet.

“Are you sure you’re fine, ma’am?” he asked again.

“I’m fine, just…” I stopped mid sentence as I noticed he was looking at my hands with concern.  
My knuckles were pale, nearly grey, as if the color had drained out.

“Yeah, I might go see a doctor,” I said hurriedly.

“You take care, ma’am,” he said before leaving with the signed log sheet.

I went into the bathroom and ran warm water. Held my hands under it.  
The water felt warm, but my fingers didn’t change.  
I turned it hotter. I felt the sting for just a brief second, and then the cold stayed.

first hour: making the most beautiful color coded notes you've ever seen. we're talking 5 different highlighter colors, each with a specific meaning that i wrote out in a little legend at the top. headers in one color, definitions in another, examples in a third. they could hang in a museum.

second hour: realized my handwriting on page 2 didn't match page 1 so i rewrote page 2. then page 1 looked worse by comparison so i rewrote that too.

third hour: took a ""quick"" photo of my desk setup for my story. adjusted the angle of my coffee cup. moved the plant slightly. retook the photo. added a filter. posted it. checked how many people viewed it. checked again.

fourth hour: finally started actually reading and trying to understand the material. this is the only hour where information entered my brain.

the notes are genuinely gorgeous. like if there was a museum of study notes mine would be in there. i would get zero questions right on an exam about them though because i was so focused on making them pretty that i didn't process a single word i was writing.

i have become the person who performs studying rather than actually studies. my setup looks like a studytube video. my actual knowledge of the subject is equivalent to someone who opened the textbook once by accident.

But when it's the weekend, or right now where I'm off 2 months, I can't seem to make myself do anything. I love getting up early, getting a coffee and going on a walk to start my day, and doing productive things... so why am I stuck, I don't understand. 

I think one issue is there are a few steps I don't wanna do like get a shower, and generally get out of my warm sheets, so I just sit there for ages waiting for something to happen until its like 1-2pm and I've just wasted my morning and get all annoyed at myself. And also there's nothing forcing me to go out, it would just be nice, so I just can't for that reason? Even tho I want to?

I thought it was my phone/laptop addiction, but I stopped using them completely last week, and instead I just read a book or drew until 2pm in my bed instead lol. 

This is a big reason I got a diagnosis recently, I waste so much time doing this. And I just makes no sense coz going out isn't that hard and I want to, I'm also autistic so going out in the morning and getting ready is part of my routine that I just can't keep which is extra annoying.

So, from the beginning, I bought a coffee machine from Temu and the seller shipped the item into two packages. One package has a letter and one has the machine. He provided the tracking on Temu for the package that has the letter, not the machine. After I got the package of the letter, I was shocked and I created a ticket and after a week Temu refunded me yesterday. This morning I saw a message from the seller saying that why the item was refunded and the package with the machine was already delivered and he sent a proof of that! I went out and looked around carefully and it was there! Seems like it was there beside the other door and the stuff for a while. Never checked there because the weather is crazy these days. I told him that I found it and what I'm supposed to do. He didn't respond so I contacted Temu customer service and they create a ticket.

After few hours the agent respond and said that's fine and keep the machine. Few hours ago, the seller responded and he was telling me that he needed me to help him by reorder the machine again so he can get the money. The question is, in these situations, does Temu or other websites reumburse the seller after they refund for missing item? Like when they refund me, that harms the seller, right? What do you suggest? Reorder the machine or ignore it. The seller seems like he doesn't want me to return it because I offered returning the machine and he said ""Please help us and reorder it""",0,1769836904.0,legaladvice,3,0.5,False

The idea was to let the enzymes theoretically convert starches to sugars, proteins to amino acids, and fats into smaller lipids, allowing for a finer and more complete extraction without the physical limitations of conventional grinding. As a result, the coffee was remarkably smooth with magnitudes less bitterness and a more pronounced acidity. The bottom of the cup had no grittiness and coated the tongue like chocolate ganache.

1qrtj1q,https://www.reddit.com/r/anxietypilled/comments/1qrtj1q/paradise/,Paradise,"**Paradise**

Somewhere east of Mendocino, 1979

The chickens don't know that the dream died. They still want their feed at seven, still peck at my boots when I'm slow with the scatter. I tell them they're capitalists now, same as everyone else. River looks up at me from the shade of the coop, tongue out, like she's in on the joke. Rain's off somewhere, probably chasing field mice she's never going to catch.

""You think it's funny, girl?"" I say to River. She thumps her tail twice in the dust.

The goat, Cosmo, stands on top of the old VW bus we were going to fix up and turn into a mobile kitchen. Rust has eaten through the engine compartment. Cosmo uses it as a throne now. I climb up, scratch between her horns, look out over what we built. A few shacks. A barn with a leaking roof. The garden where we grew tomatoes and zucchini until the well started running brackish three summers back.

Nobody else wanted the land.  We got it for a pittance.

""Paradise,"" I say. Cosmo chews something, probably one of my t-shirts she pulled off the line.

Sunflower Jack. That's what I go by. It's been so long I forgot what my folks called me back in Riverside. Something plain. Something that fit in a high school yearbook under a crew cut photo. That person's gone, dead. I killed him in 1967 when I drove up here with eight other beautiful souls who thought we could opt out. Build something pure. Something real.

Funny how real turns out.

I check the traps I set for rabbits. Empty, same as yesterday. Same as the day before. Started thinking maybe I should check the woods. But I don't like going into the woods much anymore. The trees feel different lately. Like they're watching. Like they're waiting for something.

River follows me to the main house, the only building with four solid walls and a wood stove. Rain comes trotting back from her adventure, mouth empty, pride intact.

""Catch anything?"" I ask her.

She pants at me. That's a no.

Inside, I fry up two eggs in butter going rancid, eat them standing at the sink. Used to be we'd all gather for breakfast, ten or twelve of us in here, passing around weak coffee and talking about the day's work, about the pigs we'd raise, the windmill we'd build when we got the money together. Someone always had a guitar. Someone always had a new idea about crop rotation or water collection or how to make our own soap. Good vibes, you know? Everyone contributing. Everyone part of the whole.

Now it's me and the dogs and the sound of my own chewing.

""They gave up,"" I tell River. She's curled up by the unlit wood stove. ""Can't blame them, I guess. Got tired of being poor. Got tired of being cold. Got tired of ideals that don't pay bills. The Man won, far as I can figure.""

Rain whines at the door. She needs out again already.

""You're worse than anyone,"" I mutter, letting her out. ""In and out, in and out.""

I spent the afternoon repairing fence posts the winter knocked over. Physical work keeps the thoughts quiet. Keeps me from thinking about the empty buildings. About the voices I sometimes hear at night that aren't the dogs or the goat. About the dreams that leave me shaking and sick come morning. The dogs wander the property line with me, noses down, doing their own investigations. They avoid the northeast corner, though. Always have, last few months. Won't go near that copse of pines where the ground's soft.

Smart dogs.

When the sun starts dropping, I feed everyone, check the water trough, lock the coop against foxes. The evening air smells like pine and dry grass and something else. Something sweet and rotten that drifts in from the tree line when the wind shifts. Dead animal, probably. Deer or coyote. Nothing to worry about.

Used to be we'd have a fire going by now in the pit out front. Someone playing harmonica. One of the women would dance barefoot in the dirt, spinning with her arms out, hair catching the firelight. Heavenly scene, man. Really heavy.

I stand where the fire pit used to be.

""We almost had it,"" I say to the dogs. ""We almost made it work.""

River licks my hand. Rain is already heading for the house, ready to sleep.

I light the kerosene lamp and pour myself a weak whiskey from a bottle I've been nursing for three months. It's almost cozy. I sit at the table we built from barn wood, and I try not to think about the quiet.

I drink and pet River's head and watch shadows move on the walls as the sun sinks lower.

""Going to be fine,"" I tell her. Tell myself. ""Going to be just fine.""

Rain's already asleep by the door. River's eyes are drooping. I should go to bed. Should try to sleep. But I sit there a while longer, listening to the sounds of nature, the wind through the distant pines.

I hope the trees don't start screaming again tonight.

I turn in, climb under the thick quilt.  River and Rain circle and lay in their favorite spots at the end of the bed. Sleep comes easy, but rest doesn’t.

The nightmares are back.

I can't breathe right. I can't think straight. The dream slips away before I can grab hold of it, but it leaves stains. Blood and screaming in my ears that's already fading. Faces I recognize but can't quite place.

I sit up in bed, sheets soaked with sweat, and River's whining at me from the floor. She knows something's off.

""It's cool, girl,"" I say. My voice sounds like gravel. ""Just a bad trip.""

But it wasn't a trip. Haven't touched anything stronger than whiskey in years. These dreams come on their own now.

I don't bother trying to sleep again. It never works. I pull on jeans and a flannel, stumble into the kitchen, and light the stove. The coffee's a year old, but I make it anyway. It tastes like boiled dirt. I sit at the table with my hands wrapped around the mug, watching the steam curl up toward the ceiling.

It's three A.M., maybe four. Time gets slippery out here.

I think about Candy Kane. She was the last one who really tried to make things work, you know? Kept the garden going even when the rest of us got lazy. She kept smiling, even when the winter of '77 nearly killed us. Young thing, maybe twenty, twenty-one? She had hair so blond it looked white in the sun. She wanted to be a dancer, talked about it all the time. San Francisco, she'd say. Going to dance in San Francisco. Make some bread, see the world, come back when she had her head together.

""You should go,"" I told her. Must have been March. Or maybe it was April. Hard to remember. ""Chase your dream, sister.""

Did she hug me? Did she say goodbye? I remember her smiling. Remember her saying something about missing this place. Then nothing. Just empty space where the rest should be.

I wonder if she made it. I wonder if she's dancing somewhere right now under stage lights, spinning the way she used to spin by the fire.

Then there was Hairy Terry. He was a skinny dude with a beard down to his belt and cracked glasses. His folks were getting old, he said. Needed someone to look after them. Couldn't keep living in the woods while they fell apart in some suburb in Sacramento. Made sense. Made total sense.

""You're doing the right thing, my man,"" I told him. ""Family's family.""

He promised he'd come back when things got settled. Bring his parents out, even. Show them what we built. Let them see that there was another way to live.

I believed him. I really did.

Except I can't remember him actually leaving. I can't picture him packing his stuff, loading up his rusted-out old Buick, driving away. Just remember talking to him one day, and then he was gone. Like he vanished. Like the earth swallowed him up.

And Big Pete. God, Big Pete. Huge guy, probably six-four, with hands like shovels. He just got bored. That's all. No big reason. No family emergency or career calling. He looked at me one morning over coffee and said, ""Jack, I think I'm done, you know? I need to see what else is out there.""

""I hear you, brother,"" I said. ""Can't stay in one place forever.""

""You could come with,"" he offered. ""Hit the road. See where we end up.""

But I couldn't leave. Someone had to stay. Someone had to keep the dream alive, even if it was just me and the animals and these falling-down buildings.

Did he leave? He must have left. They all left. That's what happened. That's what I remember.

They were the last three.  The ones who'd stayed the longest. I loved them.

The coffee's gone cold in my hands. I'm staring at nothing, at the dark window over the sink, trying to sort out what's real and what's a dream, when I hear it.

Faint at first. Like wind through branches. But it's not wind.

It's screaming.

My chest tightens. River's on her feet now, ears back, a low growl in her throat. Rain's awake too, pacing by the door.

The screaming gets louder. Not just one voice, hundreds. A chorus rising from the tree line, voices crying in agony, in regret, in endless suffering. They all blend together, high and low, men and women, and something that might not be human at all. 

""Stop,"" I whisper. Then louder. ""Stop it. Stop it.""

But it doesn't stop. It never stops when it starts.

I'm on my feet, hands over my ears, but it doesn't help. The sound gets inside anyway. Gets into my bones. The dogs are barking now, frantic, and I'm stumbling toward the bathroom because it's the smallest room, the darkest room, the room where maybe I can't hear it as much.

I collapse on the floor, back against the tub, hands pressed so hard against my ears that my jaw aches. Rocking. Can't help it. Just rocking back and forth while hundreds of voices scream and scream and scream from the forest.

""I'm sorry,"" I'm saying. Maybe out loud. Maybe just in my head. ""I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.""

The screaming doesn't care.

It goes on until the sky starts turning gray outside the tiny bathroom window. Goes on until my throat's raw from sobbing. Goes on until there's nothing left of me but this shaking, broken thing on the bathroom floor.

Then it stops.

Just like that. Silence drops over everything.

I sit there. Breathing. Shaking. River noses the bathroom door open and licks my face. Rain whines from the hallway.

The sun's coming up. Another day on the commune. 

Another day in paradise.

The memories are coming back now in pieces. Fragments that cut.

I stand up slowly. My legs don't want to work right. River watches me from the doorway, head cocked, like she's trying to understand what I'm about to do.

""It's the blood,"" I tell her. My voice sounds hollow. Sounds like it's coming from somewhere far away. ""The trees are screaming because of the blood. I have to make it stop,” I say, as I stagger into the kitchen.

I lean against the kitchen wall and wipe the tears from my eyes. I know what I have to do, if I can find the strength. The whiskey bottle calls my name, and I pour the last drops down my throat.

The shovel is in the barn. The same one I used to dig the garden beds and the fire pit, and the graves.

River and Rain follow me across the property toward the northeast corner, but they stop at the edge of the pines. Won't come any closer.

They sit and watch as I walk into the trees. It's cooler here. The pines grow close together, branches interlocking overhead, blocking out most of the light. The ground's covered in dead needles, and the smell is stronger. Sweet decay. Meat gone bad. The smell of things returning to earth.

I don't have to search for the spots. I know exactly where they are. Three graves under the same copse of trees, close enough that I could stand in the middle and touch all three with the shovel.

I start with Candy.

The ground's settled some, but it breaks easily under the blade. Soft earth. Good soil. I dig and dig and try not to think about what I'm doing. Try not to think about her smile or her dancing or the way she looked at me when I wrapped my hands around her throat. When I squeezed until she stopped struggling. Until she stopped asking why.

The smell hits me before I reach her. I gag, pull my shirt over my nose, and keep digging.

There she is.

What's left of her, anyway. The earth's been busy. Insects and decay and time did their work. I can still see blond hair, matted and dark. Can still see the flannel shirt she was wearing. The one I gave her because she was always cold.

""I'm sorry,"" I tell her. ""I'm so sorry, sunshine.""

But sorry doesn't fix anything.

Hairy Terry's right there, close enough that the graves almost touch. He fought more than Candy did. Actually tried to run. Made it maybe ten yards before I caught him. Before I hit him with the shovel. Before I did what I had to do to make him stay.

""Your parents don't need you,"" I told him while he bled out in the dirt. ""This place needs you. We need you.""

He didn't understand. Kept saying he had to go. Had to leave.

The glasses are still on his face somehow. His beard's gone mostly. Animals got to him.

I can't look at him long. Can't stand what I'm seeing.

Six feet to the right is the third grave. Big Pete's next to the other two. All three of them laid out in a row under the pines.

He was the hardest because of his size. Took three hours to dig a hole big enough. It took everything I had to drag him into it after I'd caved in his skull with the shovel.

""I can't let you leave,"" I told him after. After he'd stopped breathing. After his blood had soaked into the ground. ""If you leave, it's all over. It's all for nothing.""

He's in worse shape than Terry or Candy. Been in the ground the longest.

He was a huge man, full of muscle and hard work. Now there's nothing. No laugh. No life. Just bones in the dirt.

I stand there between the three open graves, the shovel hanging from my hand. The sun's moved across the sky. Must be past noon. I've been digging for hours, and my hands are bleeding, blisters broken open, dirt under my nails and in my lungs and in my soul.

The trees are quiet.

Just wind through branches and birds somewhere far off and the sound of my own breathing, ragged and harsh.

Maybe they never screamed at all. Maybe it was always just me, my mind breaking apart under the weight of what I've done, my guilt twisting into something I could hear. Something I could blame on the trees instead of on myself.

I don't know anymore.

Can't tell what's real and what's the rot inside me.

My knees give out, and I'm kneeling in the dirt between them. Between Candy and Terry, and Pete. Three people who just wanted to leave. Who just wanted to live their lives somewhere else. Do something else. Be something else.

And I killed them. Killed them because I couldn't stand to be alone. Couldn't stand to watch the dream die. Couldn't let go.

""I just wanted someone to stay,"" I sob. The words tear out of me. ""I just wanted someone to stay with me.""

River barks from outside the copse. Wants me to come back. Wants me to leave this place.

I stay in the dirt until the sun starts dropping. Until the shadows grow long and the air turns cold. Stay there until I can't feel my legs anymore. Until the only thing left is the weight of what I've done pressing down on my chest, crushing me into the ground with the people I buried.

My first post here was written in frustration and without much thought. Somehow, it went viral. Since then, I’ve made it a habit to show up every Saturday and write with more structure and intention.

My goal is simple: help young folks without expecting anything in return. No equity, no course fees, not even a free coffee 🙂

A lot of people have reached out. I try to help as many as I can. Some conversations have happened over calls and Google Meet, some over LinkedIn, and a few even in person.

Most people ask about my journey, so here it is -

I’m a 42-year-old founder based in Delhi, and a first-generation entrepreneur. My father worked in the private sector and stayed with the same company for over 20 years, so business wasn’t something I grew up around.

I studied in the US and started my career there. At one point, I came back to India to renew my H1B visa. The renewal went through, but I made a decision that surprised even me — I chose not to go back.

My US boss was incredibly supportive and let me work remotely from India while still paying me a US salary. I did that for about a year.

After that, I decided to start an IT company. I burned through my savings for a year… and nothing worked.

Then a relative suggested I set up a manufacturing unit to make floor drains. I was young and honestly didn’t overthink it — I just jumped in. Somehow, the universe was kind. Within six months, things started picking up. Margins were strong, demand kept growing, and I kept reinvesting. Over time, I built multiple manufacturing plants and a solid OEM business.

I made money earlier than most people my age and enjoyed a good life.

But in 2020, I felt a strange vacuum. I wanted to build something bigger, something more meaningful. So I started a digital-first brand in the same category around 2020–21.

Once again, things worked out. We didn’t just sell products — we helped build a new category, earned customer trust, and created a recognisable brand. All of this was done bootstrapped over 4–5 years.We are the largest digital brand in our category by far, no one else has been able to enter this space and no 1 reason has been my hunger and drive.

Now the goal is clear: build this into a ₹1000 crore revenue brand by 2030.",13,1769836693.0,StartUpIndia,4,0.88,False

I finally got a Bialetti & have done 3 brews but each time it’s taken 15 minutes or more for coffee to flow. I’m told this is way too long and can even be dangerous. I’m using an electric coil stove and my yield is around 200ml. 

I’d appreciate any feedback on what I may be doing wrong or where I can improve in the steps below: 

\-around 30g medium roast beans ground medium-fine 12 clicks on a Timemore C3S. I’ve tried finer and it took even longer to brew. 

\-around 270ml (just under the valve) room temp water.

\-I then put the moka on an electric coil stove on medium heat (5/10). I do not preheat the coil before putting the moka on it (I plan to try this tomorrow) 

\-Once I see the first stream of coffee around the 15 min mark, I turn the heat to the lowest setting

\-I let the coffee flow and at the first big gurgle and white stream, I turn off the stove and run the moka under lukewarm water all around the base and then increase it to cold

The coffee I’m getting isn’t terribly bitter or undrinkable but it is very rich, coats the mouth…I think it could be better. My main concern is the danger of having the moka under heat & pressure for 15 mins.

It started out that way anyway. A better word for it would be Shakespearean because it’s transformed into a tragedy. Instead of waking up every morning to a text message, it’s the sound of a heart monitor. 

“Chloe, I've done told you that you don’t have to sleep here. That recliner has got to be mighty uncomfortable.” It’s Trent’s dad, Richard; and he’s brought me Starbucks. “it’s fine, I really don’t mind. If I was at home all I would do is stay awake and worry.” 

“I suppose I shouldn’t complain too much. Seems like when you are here that you provide a calming presence,” Rich stated as he checked the charts. Nothing had changed. Same as the day before. Same as the past three months. 

“I hope so,” I replied as I reached over and squeezed Trent’s hand. 

Richard sits opposite of me and gets on his phone to do some day trading and I get up to go pee. The hospital recliner is actually super inconvenient but I don’t have much choice. Splashing cold water on my face, I brushed my teeth and told myself that I could make it through the day just like I’d been doing for the past few months. 

Whatever it takes, I told myself. 

I leave shortly after our morning coffee and meet Macy on my way to work.

“Is this enough for next week?” she asks me as she shows the goods. Six injections. One that is stronger than the rest in case I need to take a day off. “How much do I owe you?” But she insisted that there was no fee this time. I smile faintly as I look at the bruises around her neck. She knows what I’m up against. 

I spend the next eight hours at my job, occasionally checking my phone for any alerts from the hospital. Anyone who saw it would assume I’m just being hopeful. Truth is, I’m paranoid.

“Chloe, can you work a double for me today? Kids sick and I don’t have a babysitter,” my coworker begs me. I could really use the money so despite how tired I am, I say that I can do it. Checking the schedule I estimated that would put me back at the hospital around 11 that night. 

It was risky, but I had already told them yes by the time I realized how late it would be. 

That afternoon extra shift is hell. There’s weather forecast for a severe ice storm and everybody and their brother comes to the store to stock up. I don’t even have time for a smoke break. 

After clocking out, the storm has already settled over our town and I have to run to my cry as a wintry mix covers the parking lot. Traffic is terrible. I kept checking the time to make sure I wasn’t late. I had only half an hour to get to the hospital before there’s any danger, I told myself. I’m trying not to panic but traffic is at a near standstill. 

It’s well past 1am when I make it there and I’m running to make it to Trent’s room. The familiar sound of the monitors has me relax at first. 

Then I realized that I forgot the injection in the car. The sleet is coming down hard now and by the time I got back to the parking lot it was solid ice. I tried to cross only to wind up feeling my butt hit the pavement so I had no choice but to wait for the storm to let up. 

Trent would likely go the night without his injection. 

I texted Macy frantically asking what I should do as I returned to the room. I was midway into the room when I realized I didn’t hear the monitors. 

Next thing I knew I felt Trent’s fingers against my throat as he throttled me to the wall.

I dropped my phone in shock as he pinned me there, his eyes filled with rage and blacker than the night sky. It all happens so fast that I don’t have much time to react as he begins to choke me. 

“Trent!! Trent you have to stop!!” I yelled. 

I’m hoping I can get through to him but it’s simply a mindless rage. He screams and begins to squeeze harder as my phone rings loudly. Macy is trying to get a hold of me. It’s enough of a distraction that I can push him back. Then I ran over to the hospital bed. 

“Trent!! Please stop this!!!” I shake the bed where my real fiancé is, his still form only looking even more like a shell as I feel the firm hand of the other Trent grab me and slam me down on the ground. 

Then a nurse walks in. 

I see the confusion on her face when she notices there are two men that look identical, one in a coma and one about to choke me to death. But it doesn’t take her long to react and she grabs the food tray and bashes it over the other Trent’s head. I kick and scream and scratch, pushing his dark side toward the window. It’s a sliding glass door and I use the ice that has accumulated right outside to my advantage, forcing him to slip backward and slam his head.

Disoriented, I rush to the chart the nurse brought in and find something strong enough to act as a sedative. 

I plunged it into my Trent’s neck and then watched as his shadow evaporated before my eyes. 

The next morning Macy arrives with another round of the injections and sees where I was attacked by Trent’s shadow self. “One day he will wake up, you know. Which version do you think you’ll get?” 

I apply skincare to my bruises. “Let’s hope that day never comes.” ",32,1769835575.0,shortscarystories,2,1.0,False

Chapter 0001 – The Call

“We’ve finally found you, Young Master,” A breathless, excited voice said from the other end of the line.

 

Declan’s pupils widened for just a second and his breath caught in his throat.

 

Then reality kicked in.

 

“Another scammer,” he muttered to himself as he ended the call.

 

Slipping his phone back into his Walmart uniform pocket, he looked down at the gift box in his hand.

 

A smile spread across his face.

 

Today was Valentine’s day. Laura had been so sweet about it too. She’d told him not to worry about taking her out – she knew that he was occupied with handling both his academics and part-time work, so she didn’t want to add his load.

 

But how could he not worry? He wanted to surprise her. Three months ago, she’d told him she wanted a Dior bag and a Lululemon two piece set while they were window shipping downtown.

 

The price tag had made his stomach drop – two thousand, eight hundred dollars on a ten dollar an hour wage. But he’d worked every shift he could get for months, skipped meals, scraped together every cent just to see her smile when she opened this box.

 

Laura deserved it. She never complained when he couldn’t afford to take her out on dates. She was patient and understanding

 

That’s why he wanted to do this for her.

 

Declan’s heart pounded with excitement as he stood outside her apartment door.

 

He could already picture the excitement on her face when she opened up this box.

 

The way her eyes would light up and she’d throw her arms around him and tell him that he didn’t have to do this but he wanted to.

 

He took a deep breath and pushed open the door.

 

And his smile faded instantly.

 

There on the living room couch, tangled together, were Laura and his younger brother, Carlos.

 

Carlos’ hands were all over her, gripping her waist, sliding up her thighs.

 

Her dress was halfway up, showing skin Declan thought only he had seen.

 

They were kissing desperately like they couldn’t get enough of each other.

 

The gift box fell from his hands and crashed to the floor.

 

Laura turned to him, shocked. Her lipstick was smeared and her hair was a mess. “Declan, what are you doing here?” she gasped as she pushed Carlos away from her. “I thought you said you had a night shift?”

 

Declan’s throat burned. For a couple of seconds, he couldn’t get any words out.

 

The air felt too thick.

 

“I took the night off secretly, wishing to give you a surprise.” His voice came out bitter and raw.

 

“I spent nearly three months’ worth of savings on this bag for you.” He pointed at the box on the floor. “I’ve been helping you with your rent all this time. And this is how you repay me?”

 

Being questioned made her fly into a rage out of humiliation. She stood up from the couch, adjusting her dress, her eyes blazing. “You entered my home without permission! You violated my privacy! What kind of payback did you expect?”

 

Declan stared at her in disbelief. “You’re cheating on me with my brother and you’re talking about privacy?”

 

She let out a cold harsh laugh, shaking her head, “You guys are from the same family anyway. Does it make any difference who I sleep with? How is it even cheating?”

 

Each word hit like a knife to his chest. His teeth ground together and he stepped forward, his body tensing, ready to lunge. He couldn’t breathe or even think straight.

 

Carlos sat up on the couch with a smirk plastered on his face like he’d just won something, “Why are you overreacting?” he said casually. “So what if I stole your girl?”

 

He leaned back against the couch again, completely relaxed like all this was some sort of joke to him.

 

“Don’t forget u were adopted into our family. Everything you have rightfully belongs to me, the real young master. You’re just an ordinary orphan.”

 

“I’m not an orphan,” Declan shot back. He clenched his fists so hard his nails dug into his palms.

 

“Wake up, Declan,” Carlos said in a contemptuous tone. He stood up slowly and straightened his shirt, “You were nothing but a contingency plan. Mom and Dad thought they couldn’t have kids, so they got you from some adoption agency. You know, as a backup. But then medical advances came along and boom, they had me. Their real son. Naturally, you got tossed aside.”

 

Declan had always known he was adopted. His parents never hid it from him. But the way Derek said it, the way he threw it in his face like he was a worthless little thing made his blood boil.

 

Carlos walked over to the table and grabbed a bag, a brand new Hermès bag with the tags still on it.

 

He waved it in front of Declan’s face, “With all the family resources at my disposal, I can easily get things you couldn’t afford even after saving for a year. Hell, I could buy ten of these without blinking. So of course she chose me. Who wouldn’t?”

 

Laura stepped forward, her heels clicking. She grabbed Carlos by the collar and kissed him hard. Then she pulled back, breathless, and pressed the Hermès bag against her chest.

 

“This is what a real man gets me,” she purred, trailing her fingers down Carlos’s jaw. “Not cheap garbage I have to pretend to like.”

 

She bent down and picked the box Declan had dropped, “Leave the bag and go,” she said flatly, like she was dismissing a delivery guy.

 

“You don’t deserve it,” He said through gritted teeth.

 

Carlos’s face twisted with rage. “How dare you speak to her that way!” He lunged at Declan, his fist flying toward his face.

 

Declan didn’t have time to think. Carlos lunged at him, swinging wild and clumsy. Declan caught his wrist easily – years of hauling heavy stock had made his grip iron.

 

He twisted and threw a punch that connected hard with Carlos’ jaw. Carlos went down like a sack of bricks, crashing into the coffee table. The glass shattered and he hit the floor, groaning as blood trickled from his split lip.

 

Laura screamed something but he didn’t hear it. His ears were ringing. His vision was blurred with rage and pain and betrayal.

 

Without waiting to see if Carlos got back up, Declan turned and stormed out of the apartment, slamming the door behind him so hard the walls shook.

 

The cold night air stung. He stumbled onto the street with shaky legs and trembling hands.

 

For a moment, he just stood there under a flickering streetlight.

 

His fists were clenched so tight that his nails drew blood from his palms.

 

His chest heaved as he took sharp breaths.

 

One day, he thought, he’d have the power to get back at everyone who’d wronged him.

 

Everyone who’d looked down on him, stepped on him, treated him like he was nothing.

 

Laura. Carlos. His adoptive parents who’d always favored Carlos over him and never failed to remind him of his position in the family.

 

Every single one of them. He would make sure they’d regret it.

 

Just then, his phone buzzed in his pocket.

 

He pulled it out, expecting to see another spam call. But what he saw on the screen made his heart stop.

 

\*\*$100,000,000 deposited into account ending in 4829.\*\*

 

\*\*Balance: $100,000,247.83\*\*

 

He blinked and rubbed his eyes rapidly. Was this a dream?

 

He looked again but the numbers remained the same.

 

“What the hell…” He whispered, counting the zeros one by one. One hundred million dollars in his account. His hands started shaking worse than before.

 

His phone rang. It was the same unknown number from earlier.

 

His hand trembled as he answered. “Hello?”

 

“Young master, please don’t hang up,” the voice said urgently. “I know you think I’m a scammer. That’s why I just wired one hundred million dollars to your account. Check it. It’s real. I can wait while you verify it with your bank if you need to.”

 

Declan’s mouth went dry.

 

He stared at the notification again, his heart pounding so hard he could hear it in his ears. This couldn’t be real.

 

It had to be some kind of mistake. But he could see the numbers right there, glowing on his screen.

 

“Who… who are you?” He managed to say, his voice barely above a whisper.

 

“My name is Franklin. I’m the head butler of the Steele Family. And you, young master, are the heir we’ve been searching for.”

 

The Steele Family.

 

His mind reeled. That name echoed through his head.

 

The Steele Family was one of the top oligarch families in the country.

 

Everyone knew their name. They controlled industries, influenced politics, and owned half the city’s real estate.

 

They were the kind of people you only saw on the news or in Forbes magazine.

 

The real untouchables.

 

And this man was saying he was their heir?

 

“That’s impossible,” Declan said, his voice shaking.

 

“It’s not impossible, young master,” Franklin said gently. “It’s the truth. You are the young master of the Steele Family. And we’ve finally found you.”",1,1769835553.0,Hot_Romance_Stories,1,0.67,False

Everyone who’d looked down on him, stepped on him, treated him like he was nothing.

 

Laura. Carlos. His adoptive parents who’d always favored Carlos over him and never failed to remind him of his position in the family.

 

Every single one of them. He would make sure they’d regret it.

 

Just then, his phone buzzed in his pocket.

 

He pulled it out, expecting to see another spam call. But what he saw on the screen made his heart stop.

 

\*\*$100,000,000 deposited into account ending in 4829.\*\*

 

\*\*Balance: $100,000,247.83\*\*

 

He blinked and rubbed his eyes rapidly. Was this a dream?

 

He looked again but the numbers remained the same.

 

“What the hell…” He whispered, counting the zeros one by one. One hundred million dollars in his account. His hands started shaking worse than before.

 

His phone rang. It was the same unknown number from earlier.

 

His hand trembled as he answered. “Hello?”

 

“Young master, please don’t hang up,” the voice said urgently. “I know you think I’m a scammer. That’s why I just wired one hundred million dollars to your account. Check it. It’s real. I can wait while you verify it with your bank if you need to.”

 

Declan’s mouth went dry.

 

He stared at the notification again, his heart pounding so hard he could hear it in his ears. This couldn’t be real.

 

It had to be some kind of mistake. But he could see the numbers right there, glowing on his screen.

 

“Who… who are you?” He managed to say, his voice barely above a whisper.

 

“My name is Franklin. I’m the head butler of the Steele Family. And you, young master, are the heir we’ve been searching for.”

 

The Steele Family.

 

His mind reeled. That name echoed through his head.

 

The Steele Family was one of the top oligarch families in the country.

 

Everyone knew their name. They controlled industries, influenced politics, and owned half the city’s real estate.

 

They were the kind of people you only saw on the news or in Forbes magazine.

 

The real untouchables.

 

And this man was saying he was their heir?

 

“That’s impossible,” Declan said, his voice shaking.

 

“It’s not impossible, young master,” Franklin said gently. “It’s the truth. You are the young master of the Steele Family. And we’ve finally found you.”",1,1769835538.0,romancenovels,1,1.0,False

Chapter 0001 – The Call

“We’ve finally found you, Young Master,” A breathless, excited voice said from the other end of the line.

 

Declan’s pupils widened for just a second and his breath caught in his throat.

 

Then reality kicked in.

 

“Another scammer,” he muttered to himself as he ended the call.

 

Slipping his phone back into his Walmart uniform pocket, he looked down at the gift box in his hand.

 

A smile spread across his face.

 

Today was Valentine’s day. Laura had been so sweet about it too. She’d told him not to worry about taking her out – she knew that he was occupied with handling both his academics and part-time work, so she didn’t want to add his load.

 

But how could he not worry? He wanted to surprise her. Three months ago, she’d told him she wanted a Dior bag and a Lululemon two piece set while they were window shipping downtown.

 

The price tag had made his stomach drop – two thousand, eight hundred dollars on a ten dollar an hour wage. But he’d worked every shift he could get for months, skipped meals, scraped together every cent just to see her smile when she opened this box.

 

Laura deserved it. She never complained when he couldn’t afford to take her out on dates. She was patient and understanding

 

That’s why he wanted to do this for her.

 

Declan’s heart pounded with excitement as he stood outside her apartment door.

 

He could already picture the excitement on her face when she opened up this box.

 

The way her eyes would light up and she’d throw her arms around him and tell him that he didn’t have to do this but he wanted to.

 

He took a deep breath and pushed open the door.

 

And his smile faded instantly.

 

There on the living room couch, tangled together, were Laura and his younger brother, Carlos.

 

Carlos’ hands were all over her, gripping her waist, sliding up her thighs.

 

Her dress was halfway up, showing skin Declan thought only he had seen.

 

They were kissing desperately like they couldn’t get enough of each other.

 

The gift box fell from his hands and crashed to the floor.

 

Laura turned to him, shocked. Her lipstick was smeared and her hair was a mess. “Declan, what are you doing here?” she gasped as she pushed Carlos away from her. “I thought you said you had a night shift?”

 

Declan’s throat burned. For a couple of seconds, he couldn’t get any words out.

 

The air felt too thick.

 

“I took the night off secretly, wishing to give you a surprise.” His voice came out bitter and raw.

 

“I spent nearly three months’ worth of savings on this bag for you.” He pointed at the box on the floor. “I’ve been helping you with your rent all this time. And this is how you repay me?”

 

Being questioned made her fly into a rage out of humiliation. She stood up from the couch, adjusting her dress, her eyes blazing. “You entered my home without permission! You violated my privacy! What kind of payback did you expect?”

 

Declan stared at her in disbelief. “You’re cheating on me with my brother and you’re talking about privacy?”

 

She let out a cold harsh laugh, shaking her head, “You guys are from the same family anyway. Does it make any difference who I sleep with? How is it even cheating?”

 

Each word hit like a knife to his chest. His teeth ground together and he stepped forward, his body tensing, ready to lunge. He couldn’t breathe or even think straight.

 

Carlos sat up on the couch with a smirk plastered on his face like he’d just won something, “Why are you overreacting?” he said casually. “So what if I stole your girl?”

 

He leaned back against the couch again, completely relaxed like all this was some sort of joke to him.

 

“Don’t forget u were adopted into our family. Everything you have rightfully belongs to me, the real young master. You’re just an ordinary orphan.”

 

“I’m not an orphan,” Declan shot back. He clenched his fists so hard his nails dug into his palms.

 

“Wake up, Declan,” Carlos said in a contemptuous tone. He stood up slowly and straightened his shirt, “You were nothing but a contingency plan. Mom and Dad thought they couldn’t have kids, so they got you from some adoption agency. You know, as a backup. But then medical advances came along and boom, they had me. Their real son. Naturally, you got tossed aside.”

 

Declan had always known he was adopted. His parents never hid it from him. But the way Derek said it, the way he threw it in his face like he was a worthless little thing made his blood boil.

 

Carlos walked over to the table and grabbed a bag, a brand new Hermès bag with the tags still on it.

 

He waved it in front of Declan’s face, “With all the family resources at my disposal, I can easily get things you couldn’t afford even after saving for a year. Hell, I could buy ten of these without blinking. So of course she chose me. Who wouldn’t?”

 

Laura stepped forward, her heels clicking. She grabbed Carlos by the collar and kissed him hard. Then she pulled back, breathless, and pressed the Hermès bag against her chest.

 

“This is what a real man gets me,” she purred, trailing her fingers down Carlos’s jaw. “Not cheap garbage I have to pretend to like.”

 

She bent down and picked the box Declan had dropped, “Leave the bag and go,” she said flatly, like she was dismissing a delivery guy.

 

“You don’t deserve it,” He said through gritted teeth.

 

Carlos’s face twisted with rage. “How dare you speak to her that way!” He lunged at Declan, his fist flying toward his face.

 

Declan didn’t have time to think. Carlos lunged at him, swinging wild and clumsy. Declan caught his wrist easily – years of hauling heavy stock had made his grip iron.

 

He twisted and threw a punch that connected hard with Carlos’ jaw. Carlos went down like a sack of bricks, crashing into the coffee table. The glass shattered and he hit the floor, groaning as blood trickled from his split lip.

 

Laura screamed something but he didn’t hear it. His ears were ringing. His vision was blurred with rage and pain and betrayal.

 

Without waiting to see if Carlos got back up, Declan turned and stormed out of the apartment, slamming the door behind him so hard the walls shook.

 

The cold night air stung. He stumbled onto the street with shaky legs and trembling hands.

 

For a moment, he just stood there under a flickering streetlight.

 

His fists were clenched so tight that his nails drew blood from his palms.

 

His chest heaved as he took sharp breaths.

 

One day, he thought, he’d have the power to get back at everyone who’d wronged him.

 

Everyone who’d looked down on him, stepped on him, treated him like he was nothing.

My younger sister and my best friend got involved in something illegal last year. I won’t say what, but it started as a “quick money” thing and turned into a situation they couldn’t get out of. That situation came with a man attached to it. I’ll call him R (early 30sM).

R is the kind of person who doesn’t have to raise his voice. The room just bends around him. The first time I met him, my sister was shaking so bad she could barely hold a glass of water. My best friend wouldn’t look at him. He looked at them, then at me, and said, “You’re the one who actually thinks, huh?”

It wasn’t a compliment. It was an assignment.

From that point on, whenever something went wrong, he didn’t call them. He called me. If they messed up a job, I fixed it. If they panicked, I talked them down. Somewhere along the line I stopped being an outsider and started being part of the structure holding this whole mess together.

And he knows it.

The problem is… he treats me differently than he treats them. He’s patient with me. He explains things. He listens when I push back. I’ve seen him terrify grown men, but with me he’s calm, almost amused, like he’s watching a game unfold and I’m his favorite piece on the board.

I keep telling myself it’s manipulation. It has to be. There’s no world where a man like him sees me as anything but useful.

So why does it feel personal?

Two weeks ago my sister tried to back out. She broke down crying and said she couldn’t do it anymore. My best friend agreed. They wanted out, and they wanted me to tell him.

I went alone.

I expected anger. I expected threats. Instead he just looked at me for a long time and said, “You’re not scared of me. That’s rare.”

And I realized in that moment I wasn’t.

That scared me more than anything.

He told me he’d let them step back — but only if I stayed involved. Just me. I said yes before I even thought about it. I told myself I was protecting them. That I was taking the weight so they didn’t have to.

But the truth is uglier than that.

Part of me didn’t want to walk away.

My sister thinks I saved her. My best friend hugs me like I’m a hero. They don’t know I traded myself into the position they escaped. They don’t know I feel more alive in that dangerous orbit than I ever did in my normal life.

And now R calls me directly. Not for emergencies. Not just for business. Sometimes just to talk. He asks what I’m doing. What I’m thinking. He remembers small details about me that nobody else notices. When I told him I hadn’t slept, he showed up with coffee and said, “You’re no good to me exhausted.”

I should hate that sentence. Instead it’s been stuck in my head for days.

I don’t know if I’m being groomed into something worse or if I’m willingly stepping into it because I like the way he sees me. I’ve started lying to my sister about where I am. My best friend says I seem distant. They’re healing and I’m sinking deeper.

And the sickest part is I don’t know if I want to be pulled out.

I feel loyal to him in a way I can’t explain without sounding brainwashed. He hasn’t touched me. He hasn’t crossed a line. But the tension sits there, unspoken, like we’re both aware of it and choosing not to name it.

I keep thinking: if he asked me to leave all of this behind and walk away, I would.

I just don’t know if I’d want him to.

Has anyone ever chosen the thing that’s clearly ruining them because it feels like the first time they’ve ever been understood?

Chapter 1 

Evelyn’s POV 

Every time my husband wants to make me give in, he slaps divorce papers on the table. Every time my parents want me to cave, they 

threaten to disown me. 

What they want is simple: give everything to my twin sister. 

I used to fight back. I cried. I demanded to know why it always had to be me. 

But when the doctor slides the test results across his desk and tells me in that pitying voice, “Stage four brain cancer. You have a month, 

maybe less,” something in me just… stops caring. 

I’m dying anyway. They can do whatever the hell they want. 

I’m standing outside the hospital, and my phone starts ringing. 

Marcus. 

I answer. “Where are you?” His voice is already annoyed. “Get home. Kaley passed out again. Doctor says we need to schedule surgery ASAP. You’re signing that kidney donor consent today. Got it?” 

Before I can say anything, he keeps going. ‘Don’t pull any of your shit this time. You drag this out any longer, I’m having my lawyer file.

Your choice.

He hangs up. 

I’m staring at the black screen, my mind blank. This isn’t the first time Marcus has threatened divorce. Last month it was because Kaley wanted my necklace. The month before, she wanted to move into the master bedroom. 

As for the kidney thing, they’ve been tag-teaming me for six months now, ever since Kaley got hospitalized. 

Dad called yelling: “You feel good about being the older sister, huh? She’s been weak her whole life because you took everything from her before you were even born! She’s dying now, and you can’t give her one kidney?” 

Mom was worse, sobbing: “If you don’t save her, you’re not part of this family anymore. We didn’t raise you just to watch your sister die!” 

Marcus was the most direct: “If you really loved me, you wouldn’t put me in this position. You’re the only match for Kaley. You don’t sign, 

you’re making me choose between you two.” 

I said no back then. 

Dad stormed out. Mom pointed in my face and called me a ‘cold-blooded monster. Marcus threw the divorce papers at me. 

But now? None of it matters. 

I’m sitting in my car, watching the gray sky outside, and for the first time, I feel this weird sense of relief. 

I’ve got a month left. She can have the kidney. Not like I’ll need it. 

By the time I pull into the driveway, it’s already evening. 

I haven’t even opened the front door when I hear laughter coming from the living room. 

I walk in. My parents are sitting on either side of the sofa. Marcus is in the middle. Kaley’s curled up against him. There’s a plate of cut 

fruit on the coffee table. Dad’s telling some joke. Marcus is looking down at Kaley with this soft expression on his face. 

Kaley’s wearing a cream-colored cashmere dress, her cheeks flushed, eyes bright with laughter. 

Doesn’t look like someone who needs a new kidney. 

The door clicks shut behind me. Marcus looks up. The second he sees me, his face hardens. 

He stands, pulls two documents out of the coffee table drawer, and tosses them at my feet. 

“Kidney consent form. Divorce papers. His tone is flat, like he’s dealing with paperwork at the office. “Pick one. Today.” 

9:43 Sat, Jan 31 

Divorce Papers or Death Certificate 

My parents stop talking and turn to stare at me. 

: 

Mom frowns. “Why are you getting home so late? Kaley had a fever this afternoon. You know how scared we were?” 

Dad scoffs. “Always running around. You could spend that time worrying about your sister instead.” 

I bend down and pick up the documents. 

98 

The surgery date on the consent form is already filled in. Seven days from now. The divorce papers have a law firm’s letterhead at the top. 

Marcus has been ready for this. 

I’m standing there, looking at the four of them. 

Kaley bites her lip. “Evelyn, don’t feel bad… I know you don’t want to donate. It’s okay. I’ll figure something out…” 

“Figure out what?” Marcus cuts her off, glaring at me. “You’re her only match. Where’s she supposed to go?” 

Mom’s tearing up. “Exactly. How can you just watch her die?” 

I don’t say anything. I just stare at the consent form for a long time. 

Then I walk over to the coffee table, pick up a pen, and sign my name. 

The room goes dead silent for a second. Then everyone erupts. 

“Oh, thank God!” Mom’s wiping her eyes, rushing over to hug Kaley. “My baby girl is going to be okay!” 

Dad lets out this huge breath, claps Marcus on the shoulder. “Should’ve done this from the start. She’s the older sister. She’s supposed to 

look out for her little sister,” 

Marcus stares at me for a few seconds. His expression softens slightly, but there’s still no warmth. “Smart move.” 

Then he turns back to the sofa and keeps talking to Kaley. 

I drop my gaze. While they’re all distracted, I pick up the divorce papers, flip to the last page, and scribble my signature. 

Then I set them down in the corner of the coffee table. 

Nobody notices. 

The celebration goes on for about ten minutes. Mom even picks up her phone to order food delivery. “We should celebrate properly,” she 

says. 

When she puts her phone down, she suddenly seems to remember I exist. She turns to me. “Oh, and don’t worry too much. Once Kaley’s

surgery is successful, the family trust will still be split between you two. We’re not going to cheat you out of anything.” 

Dad nods. ‘Right. You’ve got a stubborn streak, but you’re still our daughter.” 

༩ 

98 

Marcus is leaning back on the sofa, throwing out casually, “Once she’s better, we’ll just live our lives. You should stop giving her such a 

hard time.” 

When he says this, Kaley’s tucked against him. Mom’s sitting next to Kaley pouring her water. Dad’s standing behind the sofa, smiling. 

The four of them form this perfect little circle. Like a family. 

And I’m standing on the other side of the coffee table, watching from the outside. 

I look at them and I almost want to laugh. 

Inheritance? Living our lives? 

I won’t even make it to next month. What do I need any of this for? 

I shake my head. “Forget it. I don’t need it anymore.” ",1,1769835139.0,Hot_Romance_Stories,1,1.0,False

Marcus was the most direct: “If you really loved me, you wouldn’t put me in this position. You’re the only match for Kaley. You don’t sign, 

you’re making me choose between you two.” 

I said no back then. 

Dad stormed out. Mom pointed in my face and called me a ‘cold-blooded monster. Marcus threw the divorce papers at me. 

But now? None of it matters. 

I’m sitting in my car, watching the gray sky outside, and for the first time, I feel this weird sense of relief. 

I’ve got a month left. She can have the kidney. Not like I’ll need it. 

By the time I pull into the driveway, it’s already evening. 

I haven’t even opened the front door when I hear laughter coming from the living room. 

I walk in. My parents are sitting on either side of the sofa. Marcus is in the middle. Kaley’s curled up against him. There’s a plate of cut 

fruit on the coffee table. Dad’s telling some joke. Marcus is looking down at Kaley with this soft expression on his face. 

Kaley’s wearing a cream-colored cashmere dress, her cheeks flushed, eyes bright with laughter. 

Doesn’t look like someone who needs a new kidney. 

The door clicks shut behind me. Marcus looks up. The second he sees me, his face hardens. 

He stands, pulls two documents out of the coffee table drawer, and tosses them at my feet. 

“Kidney consent form. Divorce papers. His tone is flat, like he’s dealing with paperwork at the office. “Pick one. Today.” 

9:43 Sat, Jan 31 

Divorce Papers or Death Certificate 

My parents stop talking and turn to stare at me. 

: 

Mom frowns. “Why are you getting home so late? Kaley had a fever this afternoon. You know how scared we were?” 

Dad scoffs. “Always running around. You could spend that time worrying about your sister instead.” 

I bend down and pick up the documents. 

98 

The surgery date on the consent form is already filled in. Seven days from now. The divorce papers have a law firm’s letterhead at the top. 

Marcus has been ready for this. 

I’m standing there, looking at the four of them. 

Kaley bites her lip. “Evelyn, don’t feel bad… I know you don’t want to donate. It’s okay. I’ll figure something out…” 

“Figure out what?” Marcus cuts her off, glaring at me. “You’re her only match. Where’s she supposed to go?” 

Mom’s tearing up. “Exactly. How can you just watch her die?” 

I don’t say anything. I just stare at the consent form for a long time. 

Then I walk over to the coffee table, pick up a pen, and sign my name. 

The room goes dead silent for a second. Then everyone erupts. 

“Oh, thank God!” Mom’s wiping her eyes, rushing over to hug Kaley. “My baby girl is going to be okay!” 

Dad lets out this huge breath, claps Marcus on the shoulder. “Should’ve done this from the start. She’s the older sister. She’s supposed to 

look out for her little sister,” 

Marcus stares at me for a few seconds. His expression softens slightly, but there’s still no warmth. “Smart move.” 

Then he turns back to the sofa and keeps talking to Kaley. 

I drop my gaze. While they’re all distracted, I pick up the divorce papers, flip to the last page, and scribble my signature. 

Then I set them down in the corner of the coffee table. 

Nobody notices. 

The celebration goes on for about ten minutes. Mom even picks up her phone to order food delivery. “We should celebrate properly,” she 

says. 

When she puts her phone down, she suddenly seems to remember I exist. She turns to me. “Oh, and don’t worry too much. Once Kaley’s

surgery is successful, the family trust will still be split between you two. We’re not going to cheat you out of anything.” 

Dad nods. ‘Right. You’ve got a stubborn streak, but you’re still our daughter.”

Marcus is leaning back on the sofa, throwing out casually, “Once she’s better, we’ll just live our lives. You should stop giving her such a 

hard time.” 

When he says this, Kaley’s tucked against him. Mom’s sitting next to Kaley pouring her water. Dad’s standing behind the sofa, smiling. 

The four of them form this perfect little circle. Like a family. 

And I’m standing on the other side of the coffee table, watching from the outside. 

I look at them and I almost want to laugh. 

Inheritance? Living our lives? 

I won’t even make it to next month. What do I need any of this for? 

I shake my head. “Forget it. I don’t need it anymore.” ",2,1769835134.0,romancenovels,1,0.76,False

Chapter 1 

Evelyn’s POV 

Every time my husband wants to make me give in, he slaps divorce papers on the table. Every time my parents want me to cave, they 

threaten to disown me. 

What they want is simple: give everything to my twin sister. 

I used to fight back. I cried. I demanded to know why it always had to be me. 

But when the doctor slides the test results across his desk and tells me in that pitying voice, “Stage four brain cancer. You have a month, 

maybe less,” something in me just… stops caring. 

I’m dying anyway. They can do whatever the hell they want. 

I’m standing outside the hospital, and my phone starts ringing. 

Marcus. 

I answer. “Where are you?” His voice is already annoyed. “Get home. Kaley passed out again. Doctor says we need to schedule surgery ASAP. You’re signing that kidney donor consent today. Got it?” 

Before I can say anything, he keeps going. ‘Don’t pull any of your shit this time. You drag this out any longer, I’m having my lawyer file.

He hangs up. 

I’m staring at the black screen, my mind blank. This isn’t the first time Marcus has threatened divorce. Last month it was because Kaley wanted my necklace. The month before, she wanted to move into the master bedroom. 

As for the kidney thing, they’ve been tag-teaming me for six months now, ever since Kaley got hospitalized. 

Dad called yelling: “You feel good about being the older sister, huh? She’s been weak her whole life because you took everything from her before you were even born! She’s dying now, and you can’t give her one kidney?”

1qrsyjv,https://www.reddit.com/r/atheism/comments/1qrsyjv/is_christianity_a_cult_a_detailed_analysis_i_guess/,Is Christianity a Cult? A detailed analysis (I guess),"I have seen a lot of posts here stating that christianity is a cult, so I wanted to fact-check if this was true using tools proposed by experts.

For the record, I don't consider myself an atheist, nor a christian... let's say I just don't know what to believe. I was raised in a christian household though, and I also assist a catholic college, so all the claims about christianity being a cult made me curious and I thought this community may like this analysis.

And since many of  you used to be christians and have some insight in history or just personal experiences, I thought maybe you could help me add more information into this analysis.

I'll be using various tools so expect this post to be long.

1. [Dr. Hassan's BITE model](https://freedomofmind.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/The-BITE-Model.pdf)
2. [Dr. Lifton's 8 Criteria](https://www.cultrecover.com/lifton8#Confession)

I'll be talking mainly about catholicism because this is the one in which I was raised.

# BITE's Tought Control and Lifton's Sacred Science, Doctrine Over Person Criteria

Since these 3 kinda overlap, I'll analyze them as one. The BITE model mentions various criteria for behaviour control:

>Adopting the group's map of reality as true and Lifton's 5th and 7th criteria

Okay this one is extremely obvious, specially within the catholic church, which puts a lot of emphasis on respecting dogma and doctrine, which is infallible btw, and has not changed nor will ever change (e.g. the whole creed, the immaculate conception, marriage exists only between a man and a woman).

If you didn't know, ecumenical councils within the catholic church, when talking about doctrine, faith or morals, are considered infallible as long as the council is summoned by the pope.

The pope is also infallible btw, but only when talking about very specific things and under special circumstances (*ex cathedra*).

Believers must adhere to these dogmas and doctrines; those who don't are considered sinners or heretics. Heretics are formally cut off from the church, whilst sinners can't recieve the Holy Communion until they repent. A noticeable phrase related to this topic is ***let them be anathema***, which I find very funny when mentioned in memes about orthodox christians vs catholic christians.

Whether the establishment of dogmas is good or bad is up to debate. Since dogmas help to form a shared identity and protects it.

I must say though, that some catholics are just way too orthodox, even for catholicism. For example, I saw a video of a guy saying that the Second Vatican Council destroyed the church and weakened its doctrines because it implied that there MIGHT be salvation outside the church... dude... you're mad about the possibility of more people being saved? ok?! 

>Instill black and white thinking, decide between good and evil, insiders vs outsiders perspective, labeling alternative systems as illegitimate, evil or not useful, labeling alternative belief systems as illegitimate 

This one is different depending on which group of christianity we're talking about, but it's ultimately true. Some christians consider other religions as ""having just a portion of the truth, which we fully have"", whilst others think that ""the rest of religions were inspired by demons"". This happens not only with different religions, but between different groups of christianity too.

>Loaded language (corresponds with Lifton's 6th criteria)

I honestly don't think that catholicism meets this criteria... Other christian groups might do it, but I am not familiar. Theologians do have a lot of special language such as transubstantiation, kenosis, theosis, atonement, etc., but that's used only by theologians, you don't come across your common catholic saying these things.

>Encourages only *good and proper* thoughts

Yeah, definitely yes. Mainly when we talk about sexual thoughts.

>Hypnotic techniques to alter mental states, undermine critical thinking and even age regression

Not in catholicism, I don't know about other christian groups.

>Memories are manipulated and false memories are created

Definitely not lol

>Thought stopping techniques, which include denial, rationalization, justification, wishful thinking, chanting, meditating, praying, speaking in tongues

Okay this is a big one. Catholics don't do this *speaking in tongues* thing, but some christians do. Praying and chanting are OBVIOUSLY very very common... I actually like the chants, there are various beautiful ones, I think catholicism has an amazing collection of music.

In general, I'm kinda skeptical 'bout this criteria cuz it's not that you end up losing your brain... and you can definitely still think while praying, that's why there are a lot of ""how not to get distracted during the rosary"" videos. And when you finish your prayer or your chant, you can think again. I know that the criteria refers to *critical thinking...* but if these practices stopped critical thinking then there wouldn't be deconversions. 

Regarding rationalization... this one's HUGE, specially when we talk about Hell. Christianity imo has been trying to justify Hell for CENTURIES. 

Actually, the idea of eternal suffering has been so crazy that there had been different heretical movements claiming interesting things about hell. For example, there are those who believe that whoever ends up in hell will suffer for just some time and then they'll be annihilated so that they suffer no more (annihilationism). Another group of this kind are those who believe that, eventually, all of humanity will be restored to friendship with God and nobody will have to suffer in hell (universalism).

>Rejection of ratinonal analysis, critical thinking, constructive criticism

I think this one doesn't apply to catholicism... Constructive criticism is actually very encouraged (or at least that's what I've seen from my experience).

>Forbid critical questions about leader, doctrine or pollicy

You can actually question about dogma, people will explain the reasoning behind it.

# BITE's Emotional control

This one also has various points.

>Some emotions/needs are deemed as wrong or selfish

All emotions are valid within christianity, it's their extrapolation what makes them bad (e. g. anger vs wrath)... Seems reasonable to me.

>Teach emotion-stopping techniques to block feelings of homesickness, anger, doubt

I don't think christianity has any of these... at least not catholicism imo.

>One person's problems are always their own fault, never the leader's nor the group's fault

Ehm... I also don't think catholicism has any of these. Yes you're responsible for your sins, but if the church does something wrong, catholics are encouraged to denounce it.

>Promote feelings of guilt or unworthiness 

Now this is something that catholicism does have. Things like ""I'm a sinner, I'm unworthy of God's love or forgiveness, I deserve Hell"".

>Instill fear

Uhm... well... Hell... lol. Even without considering Hell... Fear of being disowned, specially for homosexual or trans people.  

I have seen christians defend the fear of hell by saying that it's something similar to scaring your child by saying ""if you put your hands near the stove, you will burn and it'll hurt"" in order to prevent him from putting his hands near the stove. So yeah, it's seen as *protecting someone*. 

I actually saw a post here on reddit about and hindu saying that it'd be a good idea to convert to christianism in order to avoid hell. His reasoning was as follows: ""if hinduism is true, we just reincarnate in whatever our karma sets us, if christianity is true and we don't practice it, we're doomed to eternal despair"".

Furthermore, within catholicism there's a statement, considered dogmatic, that says: *Extra ecclesia nulla sallus* (outside of the \[catholic\] church, there is no salvation). So yeah, even if you decide to leave the catholic church and join idk an orthodox church, you're still doomed kiddo.

I'm gonna cite the Catechism of the Catholic Church for y'all:

*CCC 846 (fragment): Hence they could not be saved who, knowing that the Catholic Church was founded as necessary by God through Christ, would refuse either to enter it or to remain in it.*

This one clearly checks **Lifton's 8th criteria: Dispensing of Existence**

>Extremes of emotional highs and lows

Nah, not really

>Ritualistic and often public confession of sins, Lifton's 4th criteria

In catholicism, confession of sins is never public, priests are bound by the seal of confession so they can't say what you've confessed and a lot of times (depends on the confessionary) you never even know who the confessor is. Confessions are indeed ritualistic, but they don't ask you a lot of detail, just to be honest and repent. As someone who has confessed various times... It feels very relieving.

>Phobia indoctrination: inculcating irrational fears about leaving the group or questioning the leader's authority, dispensation from existence (Lifton's 8th criteria)

I mean, you can leave catholicism any day you want, just stop going to church, stop confessing, stop going to adoration... What remains is the fear of going to hell.

What does exist is this idea that those who leave only do so because they want to indulge in sin, don't want to grow in virtue and stuff like that.

And... This is kinda true (???). Some people don't want to be told what to do with their sexuality or orientation... heck, even heterosexuals are bound by some rules. People don't want to be told who they can marry, etc. This chekcs **Lifton's 3rd criteria: the demand for purity**.

And this exact same argument could be used by other religions (well, at least the abrahamic ones). EXAMPLES.

* A jewish man says to his son ""you only want to convert to christianity because you don't want to follow the mosaic law""
* A muslim mad says to his son ""you only want to convert to christianity because you don't want to follow the sharia law""
* A mormon father says to his son ""you only want to convert to catholicism because you want to drink coffee, lots of beer and have tattoos (fyi catholicism doesn't condemn tattoos nor piercings as long as they are not blasphemous or immoral)

These are silly examples, I know, but they are examples nonetheless

# BITE's Behaviour Control

These are gonna be a little bit more quick

**Regulate individual's physical reality.** Maybe this is shown mostly with trans people

**Dictate where, how and with whom the member lives and associates.** 

Not a catholic thing NOWADAYS, since catholics are not encouraged to cut ties with non-believers. Catholics are called to ""live in the world but don't be part of this world"". In spite of this, the catholic church does dictate how and when a person can associate romantically with another one (rules about chatity, cohabiting, etc). Furthermore, it used to be a thing (not anymore) that a catholic could only marry another catholic. 

[Here's a little bit of history directly from a catholic friar](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hLXeoQybXEU), just ten minutes

**When, how and with whom the member has sex.** Pretty obvious one, an undeniable yes.

**Control types of clothing and hairstyles.** 

Not a catholic thing, you can dress with any style you want as long as you dress modestly... Yeah maybe that's some type of control right there, but at least catholics don't stone people for dressing gothic or punk.

**Regulate diet, food and drink, hunger and/or fasting.** 

Meatless fridays used to be a thing within catholicism, but they are not obligatory anymore. Fasting is optional and must never ever damage the believer's health. As far as I remember, there are only a few days in which fasting is obligatory and it's just ""don't eat red meat"" lol. I don't se e an issue. Other christian groups may ban alcohol consuption... I don't think it's that big of a deal... I mean, it's better to live without alcohol lol. 

**Deprivation of sleep.** 

Nop... I mean, you have midnight masses like once a year and most of the time there's another mass wich takes place earlier, you can assist to that one if you want.

**Financial explotation.** 

Nop, in catholicism, tithing is voluntary, the amount is also up to you. 

**Restrict leisure, entertainment, vacation time.** I think this is the protestant's fault...

**Major time spent with group endoctrination.** 

I'm not very sure about this one... Catholicism has bible studies and catechism and the catechumenate (RCIA nowadays) but they don't last forever... Bible studies are optional too. It's just catholics who personally decide to follow priests/theologians/apologists on youtube, but they are not *required* to.

In addition to this, even though it is not required by the church, many parents choose to send their children to christian schools or even end up homeschooling them (although I think this just happens in the US, I haven't seen it in my country)

**Permission required for major decisions.** I don't think so, nop

**Rewards and punishments used to modify behaviours.** 

Excommunion is literally intended to be used this way, it ultimately seeks to make the excommunicated person repent of their sins

**Discourage individualism, encourage group-thinking.** Kinda? Idk how to evaluate this.

**Impose rigid rules and regulations.** 

Kinda, I think most of catholicism rules are not that hard to follow, even all of those pertaining chatsity are attainable imo.

**Punish disobedience by beating, torture, burning, cutting, rape or tattooing**. 

Well... The inquisition existed... maybe they killed a lot less people than what it is claimed... but they still killed people.

**Threaten harm to family and friends.** Currently, no

**Force individuals to rape or to be raped.** NO, DEFINITELY NO

**Encourage and engage in corporal punishment.** 

This one is interesting because nowadays not a single catholic is hitting his back with a chain or at least a rope... But it used to be done so... (btw, a famous catholic known by this practice is [St. John Vianney](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Vianney))

Let's also remember that christianity praises martyrdom highly. A very clear example of this is [St. Ji Tianxiang](https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marcos_Ji_Tianxiang).

This was actually the reason why the japanese ended up deciding that killing christians was not precisely a very good idea if they wanted to end christian presence in Japan, because martyrs proved their conviction and faith, thus encouraging others to preserve their faith.

Eventually, the japanese decided that the best way to fight christianity was to [force christians to step on images of Jesus or the Virgin Mary ](https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fumie)in order to show disrespect towards them.

**Instill dependance and obedience.** 

According to catholic theology, there are ordinary means of salvation in which the believer must participate in order to be saved. It turns out that just the ones performed by the catholic church are valid (except baptism). This sounds like dependance to me. And yeah the obedience part has been already covered.

I'll add an example of these *means of salvation* for those who are unfamiliar with it. In order to be forgiven of your sins, you must repent and confess your sins to a catholic priest, not an anglican, not a lutheran, just a catholic priest. If you don't, your sins are not forgiven and you will end up in hell if you suddenly die for whatever reason (there are actually more nuances and there's actually still hope for salvation, but that would be to step into theology and stuff).

**Kidnapping.** NO

**Beating, torture, imprisonment, murder.** Not anymore

# BITE's Information Control and Milieu Control (Lifton's 1st criteria)

This one is the reason why I decided to make this whole analysis, specifically this next criteria:

>Deception, deliberately withholding information, distort information to make it more acceptable, systematically lie to the cult member, minimize or discourage access to non-cult sources of information, compartmentalize information into outsider vs insider doctrines

This one is big and I only need to redirect you to:

* [Britannica Index Librorum Prohibitorum](https://www.britannica.com/topic/Index-Librorum-Prohibitorum)
* [Wikipedia Index Librorum Prohibitorum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Index_Librorum_Prohibitorum)
* [EBSCO Index Librorum Prohibitorum](https://www.ebsco.com/research-starters/religion-and-philosophy/index-librorum-prohibitorum)

For those who don't want to open the links, it's basically a curated list of forbidden books. No catholic should read, copy or spread these books, or else they'd be commiting mortal sin and may even be excommunicated.

>Encourage spying on other members

Within catholicism, totally, yes. It doesn't happen anymore, but inquisitors used to encourage believers to denounce any heretical they knew of. Furthermore, it was clearly stated that anyone who knew of a heretic person or group and voluntarily decided to remain silent about it was commiting grave sin and was at risk of being excommunicated.

[Wikipedia ""Edicto de fe"" ](https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edicto_de_fe)  
(it's in spanish sorry, use a translator)

[UNAM's document about the Edictos de fe in Mexico](https://archivos.juridicas.unam.mx/www/bjv/libros/14/6851/2.pdf)  
(UNAM is an important mexican university... the document is also in spanish, sorry)

>Unethical use of confession such as: using information about sins to disrupt identity boundaries, withhold forgiveness or manipulate someone's memory

This did happen within the catholic church and it took the form of *solicitation* (a priest touching a believer in an improper way), but it was NEVER EVER allowed or fostered by the church and it was actually persecuted by the Inquisition.

Additionally, a priest can withhold forgiveness, but this almost never happens and it's only done when the believer shows no remorse of his sins and has a clear intention of commiting the same sin one more time so... it sounds fair to me.

# Finally, Lifton's 2nd criteria: Mystical Manipulation

Okay this one's really hard because I wholeheartedly think that even the pope, cardinals, bishops, etc. believe that the miracles in catholic history are true, or at least some of them. What I mean is, I don't think most miracles were carefully and intentionally planned in order to gain more believers.

I'm mexican, so this is very important to me since my country has been a catholic one for centuries mostly due to Our Lady of Guadalupe. The catholic church thinks that this apparition is legitimate, whilst some historians and even some catholic priests think that it's made up. 

The outcome is clear: millions of indigenous people *converted* to catholicism within a decade. And I say *converted* because there's a catch: some people believe that Our Lady of Guadalupe is syncretic with Coatlicue (an aztec goddess) or Tonantzin (a mexica goddess), and that indigenous people were just trying to keep practicing their beliefs in a discreet way, just like believers of Yoruba started to use statues of saints with the intention of being unnoticed by the church (this later became *Santería* btw).

I am very skeptic about this apparition tbh, and I think it is important to state that I believe that miracles can happen.

We also have an [eucharistic miracle that occurred in Tixtla, in 2006.](https://www.miracolieucaristici.org/en/liste/scheda_b.html?nat=messico&wh=tixtla&ct=Tixtla,%202006) This one is also interesting because it was analysed by someone with almost no known background in science, who had also *investigated* another two eucharistic miracles in Buenos Aires.

[Here's a link to a reddit post in r/DebateACatholic in which an agnostic questions the credibility of the miracle](https://www.reddit.com/r/DebateACatholic/comments/1hv020d/dr_ricardo_casta%C3%B1%C3%B3n_g%C3%B3mez_is_a_quack_and_if_i/?tl=es-419)  
The same post also links ANOTHER post in which this same user questions the eucharistic miracles that happened in Buenos Aires. 

It is important to say that the catholic church is very zealous regarding miracles, especially apparitions. The church usually investigates and analyzes a miracle in order to discard any logical/scientific explanation. With apparitions it becomes even more interesting because the church only recognizes those which adhere to catholic teachings, doctrine and dogma. 

[Here's a secular video about Marian Apparitions and how sometimes the church disquialifies some of them](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UQ6oeCMZk_k) 

Lifton's 2nd criteria also includes the following

**Leaders claim to be chosen by God.** 

Well this is true, catholics believe that the Holy Spirit (who is trully and fully God according to catholic theology) guides the cardinals in choosing who becomes the next pope.

**The believer participates actively in the manipulation of others.** 

Also clearly very true, as many of you have experienced. Some christians are always trying to convert people, that's why some of them delve a lot in apologetics. 

I think this stems from the belief that catholicism/christianity is the only way to attain salvation, and people obviously love other people, so they want them to be saved, thus, they must convert them.

This one is kinda justifiable to some degree (??). Let me explain, I study medicine and I am all in for vaccines because they can prevent epidemics or stop pandemics (such as COVID-19), so I'll obviosly advocate for the usage of vaccines and try to convince anti-vaxxers that they should get vaccinated. See my point?

The problem is that... there's scientific evidence for vaccines, whilst evidence of the existence of hell or heaven is just the New Testament and visions that some saints had.  

# Closure

That's it, thank you guys for reading all of this. The conclusion about this is really obvious and straight-forward for you, but I still wanted to share my analysis. If any of you has more information regarding this topic, especially about history, I would love to read it.

I don't think this proves/disproves the authenticity of christianity and specially of catholicism, but at least it evidentiates how the church has lasted for so long even when there has been opposition for literally all its history. Catholics will say that the prevalence of the church in history clearly proves Mt 16:18 (*The gates of Hades will not prevail against it \[the church\]*) and Mt 28:20 (*I \[Jesus\] will be with you \[the church\] until the end of time*), but we all know that institutions are designed to last a very long time, specially the culty ones. Is this a prophecy coming true? Or is it just that christianity was, from its very beginning, designed to endure due to its cultic characteristics?  

Anyways, if God has to use cult tactics to make his church endure then... ehm... ehm... ehm...

May science bless y'all I guess? (I'm joking please don't kill me)",2,1769835018.0,atheism,13,0.62,False
1qrsyj5,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1qrsyj5/i_think_i_accidentally_fell_for_the_man_whos/,I think I accidentally fell for the man who’s ruining my life and I don’t know how to stop,"I’m 19F and I’ve been sitting on this for months because saying it out loud makes me sound like a terrible person.

My younger sister and my best friend got involved in something illegal last year. I won’t say what, but it started as a “quick money” thing and turned into a situation they couldn’t get out of. That situation came with a man attached to it. I’ll call him R (early 30sM).

R is the kind of person who doesn’t have to raise his voice. The room just bends around him. The first time I met him, my sister was shaking so bad she could barely hold a glass of water. My best friend wouldn’t look at him. He looked at them, then at me, and said, “You’re the one who actually thinks, huh?”

It wasn’t a compliment. It was an assignment.

From that point on, whenever something went wrong, he didn’t call them. He called me. If they messed up a job, I fixed it. If they panicked, I talked them down. Somewhere along the line I stopped being an outsider and started being part of the structure holding this whole mess together.

And he knows it.

The problem is… he treats me differently than he treats them. He’s patient with me. He explains things. He listens when I push back. I’ve seen him terrify grown men, but with me he’s calm, almost amused, like he’s watching a game unfold and I’m his favorite piece on the board.

I keep telling myself it’s manipulation. It has to be. There’s no world where a man like him sees me as anything but useful.

So why does it feel personal?

Two weeks ago my sister tried to back out. She broke down crying and said she couldn’t do it anymore. My best friend agreed. They wanted out, and they wanted me to tell him.

I went alone.

I expected anger. I expected threats. Instead he just looked at me for a long time and said, “You’re not scared of me. That’s rare.”

And I realized in that moment I wasn’t.

That scared me more than anything.

He told me he’d let them step back — but only if I stayed involved. Just me. I said yes before I even thought about it. I told myself I was protecting them. That I was taking the weight so they didn’t have to.

But the truth is uglier than that.

Part of me didn’t want to walk away.

My sister thinks I saved her. My best friend hugs me like I’m a hero. They don’t know I traded myself into the position they escaped. They don’t know I feel more alive in that dangerous orbit than I ever did in my normal life.

And now R calls me directly. Not for emergencies. Not just for business. Sometimes just to talk. He asks what I’m doing. What I’m thinking. He remembers small details about me that nobody else notices. When I told him I hadn’t slept, he showed up with coffee and said, “You’re no good to me exhausted.”

I should hate that sentence. Instead it’s been stuck in my head for days.

I don’t know if I’m being groomed into something worse or if I’m willingly stepping into it because I like the way he sees me. I’ve started lying to my sister about where I am. My best friend says I seem distant. They’re healing and I’m sinking deeper.

And the sickest part is I don’t know if I want to be pulled out.

I feel loyal to him in a way I can’t explain without sounding brainwashed. He hasn’t touched me. He hasn’t crossed a line. But the tension sits there, unspoken, like we’re both aware of it and choosing not to name it.

I keep thinking: if he asked me to leave all of this behind and walk away, I would.

I just don’t know if I’d want him to.

Has anyone ever chosen the thing that’s clearly ruining them because it feels like the first time they’ve ever been understood?

I'm writing this 36 hours after my fistulotomy surgery, laying (carefully) with a glass of water next to me, feeling cautiously optimistic for the first time in over two months. If you're reading this in the middle of your own nightmare (maybe in a bathroom, maybe at 3 a.m., maybe both), I want you to know something important before we go any further:

**Your story will not be everyone else's story.**

That might sound obvious. But when you're deep in these Reddit threads at midnight, reading about complex branching tracts and months-long recoveries and third surgeries, your brain doesn't process probability. It processes possibility. And possibility, when you're scared and in pain, feels like certainty.

I read hundreds of posts here. They helped me feel less alone. They also convinced me, at various points, that I was facing the worst-case scenario. I wasn't. You probably aren't either.

# The Timeline Nobody Warns You About

It started in November with what I assumed was a hemorrhoid. Just discomfort while driving, then sudden, brutal escalation. By that night I was at Walgreens buying hemorrhoid cream. By the next morning I was in the ER, where I sat for five hours in the kind of pain that makes you understand why people in old novels ""saw stars.""

They performed an incision and drainage. I went home thinking it was over.

Two weeks later, almost to the day my antibiotics ran out, it came back. Another ER visit, another surgery, an overnight hospital stay, and this time they installed a Penrose drain: a small rubber tube connecting two incision sites, designed to keep things open and draining.

What followed was a month of limbo. Not crisis-level pain, but a constant 3-or-4-out-of-10 discomfort. The inability to sit normally. Holiday parties where I stood in corners or paced outside. The particular indignity of having gas escape through an opening that wasn't supposed to exist, and wincing visibly every single time.

Then came the confirmation: a fistula. A tunnel from inside the anal canal to the skin surface. The only real fix is surgery.

# The Loneliness Nobody Talks About

Here's what surprised me most: how isolating this experience is.

You have a family who loves you right outside the bathroom door. But they're not in there with you while you're cleaning up drainage, or trying not to scream, or (in my case) watching actual fecal matter exit through a hole in your buttock that shouldn't exist.

That was the worst moment. Not physically the most painful (though it was up there), but psychologically the most disturbing. You can't exactly text a friend about that. You can't bring it up at dinner. You carry it alone, and the weight of that silence compounds everything else.

This community helped with that loneliness. But the community also amplified my fears. Which brings me to what I actually want to share: the practical, non-obvious things that made this bearable.

# Tips You May Not Find in Discharge Papers

# On Gauze: Not All Gauze Is Created Equal

For six weeks, I used standard woven gauze. Then my wife ordered non-woven gauze (same brand, same manufacturer), and it was like switching from sandpaper to silk. The woven kind has texture that irritates raw skin. The non-woven kind feels almost buttery. This single change dramatically improved my daily comfort.

**The tip:** Look for ""non-woven"" gauze pads. It's a small label distinction with an outsized impact.

# On Mobility: The Electric Scooter Solution

Everyone asks about sitting. Can I drive? Can I bike? Both require you to sit, and sitting is the enemy.

You know what doesn't require sitting? Standing on an electric scooter.

I live in a city where rental scooters are everywhere. I started using them to get to work, to grab coffee, to feel human. You just stand there. The slight bouncing over sidewalk cracks actually felt good, almost like a gentle massage. Eventually I bought a used one for under $300.

The day after my surgery, against every piece of reasonable medical advice, I rode my scooter to my coffee shop. Less than 100 steps total, round trip. My family thought I was insane. My surgeon would probably agree. But psychologically, it reminded me that normal life was still out there waiting.

**I'm not recommending this.** I'm just telling you what I did, and why it mattered to me.

# On the Penrose Drain: Cut Your Gauze Strategically

If you have a Penrose drain, here's a technique nobody taught me: cut a slit in one side of your gauze pad, then cut a small circle in the center. This lets you wrap the gauze *around* the drain, keeping it completely covered and preventing skin irritation from drainage contact.

This was a game-changer for managing the awkwardness of the drain.

# On Bathroom Supplies: Double Up on Portable Bidets

Those squeeze-bottle portable bidets are essential. But one bottle often isn't enough water for a thorough clean after a bowel movement. Buy two. Fill both with warm water before you go. The extra capacity means you can actually get clean without excessive wiping.

I have an electronic bidet on my toilet, but post-surgery I preferred the bottle. It gave me more control over pressure, angle, and when to stop.

# On Sitz Baths: The Bathtub Might Be Better

Everyone recommends the plastic sitz bath that fits over your toilet. I bought two different models and hated both. They pinched my legs and felt cramped.

I ended up just using my actual bathtub. Warmer, more comfortable, room to shift positions. There are different opinions on this, but do what actually works for your body.

# On Wiping: Water Wipes Only

Baby wipes marketed as ""water wipes"" (no fragrance, no alcohol, no sanitizers) were essential. I went through hundreds of them. Your skin in that area will be raw and angry. Regular wipes or toilet paper will make it worse.

# On Bending: Get a Grabber Tool

My daughter has one of those toy robot-arm grabber sticks. I started using it constantly: picking up laundry, reaching things on the floor, even cleaning the bathtub with a washcloth attached. Bending at the waist is surprisingly painful throughout this process. A $10 grabber tool saved me countless moments of agony.

# On Self-Monitoring: Mirror, Flashlight, Delete

I used a standing  mirror and a flashlight to inspect the area and take photos documenting changes. Then I deleted the photos after reviewing them, keeping them only 30 days in my phone's trash for reference if needed.

This felt like mental hygiene. I didn't want a permanent archive of my worst moments. I didn't want someone scrolling through my phone to stumble onto them. And deleting them felt like closing a chapter, even temporarily.

# The Most Important Decision I Made: Getting the MRI

When my surgeon confirmed the fistula and scheduled surgery, he mentioned that an MRI wasn't  necessary. ""Nice to have, not need to have.""

I pushed for one anyway.

Here's what I learned: in Europe, MRI with fistula protocol is standard. In the U.S., it's often skipped. *But the number-one cause of fistula recurrence is incomplete treatment, meaning a branch or tract that wasn't visible during surgery gets missed.*

An MRI provides a detailed map. It cost me $1,200 out of pocket and delayed my surgery by two weeks. My fistula turned out to be simple: single tract, superficial, no muscle involvement. The MRI confirmed what my surgeon suspected.

But knowing that gave me peace. And if it had revealed something complex, it would have changed the surgical approach entirely.

**My advice:** If your insurance or finances allow it, push for the MRI. The information is worth it.

# A Word About AI, and Why I Used It More Than Online Groups

This might be controversial here, but: I found personalized AI conversations more helpful than Reddit threads or Facebook groups for managing my anxiety.

The challenge with online groups is that you're reading everyone's story. The simple cases, the nightmares, and everything in between. Your brain can't filter by probability. You see a post about a five-inch wound and a six-month recovery, and suddenly that's your future.

AI tools (I used Perplexity daily, but Claude gave me the most balanced, measured responses) let me describe my specific situation and get contextualized information. When I shared that my fistula appeared superficial and single-tract, the AI didn't push me to the extremes. It gave me a more realistic range of outcomes for someone in my position.

I also used it as a diary, logging symptoms, asking questions, preparing summaries for doctor visits. Before meeting my surgeon, I'd ask it to compile everything I'd reported over the previous two weeks into a concise briefing.

**This doesn't replace medical advice.** Of course you should always confirm with your doctor. Get second and third opinions. But for managing the mental load between appointments, AI was more stabilizing than doom-scrolling through worst-case scenarios.

# Where I Am Now

My surgery revealed exactly what the MRI predicted: a single, superficial tract, curving slightly (my surgeon described it as ""like a dogleg on a golf course""), but involving no sphincter muscle. A straightforward fistulotomy. He's confident he got everything.

My first bowel movement post-surgery, about 36 hours in, was a 1-or-2 out of 10 on the pain scale. I know that's not everyone's experience. I know I might have harder days ahead. But right now, I'm counting that as a blessing.

# The Takeaways

If you're early in this journey, here's what I'd want you to remember:

* **Non-woven gauze** is dramatically more comfortable than woven.
* **An electric scooter** lets you move around without sitting. Consider one!
* **Two portable bidets** are better than one.
* **A grabber tool** saves you from painful bending.
* **Water wipes only.** No fragrance, no alcohol.
* **Push for an MRI** if you can. The map matters.
* **Your bathtub** might work better than a sitz bath on the toilet.
* **Cut a hole in your gauze** to wrap around any drain.
* **Use AI for personalized guidance**, not just Reddit for horror stories.
* **Breathe through the pain.** Count slowly. It helps more than you'd think.

And most importantly:

*Your story is the only one that will happen to you.* Don't let the worst-case posts convince you they're your destiny. The range of outcomes is wide, and most people land somewhere in between.

I'm happy to answer questions as I continue recovering. If you're in the scared, confused, painful middle of this, you're not alone. It does get better.

Wishing you the best.

I don't exactly trust the government to go public with my findings, in fact, I wouldn't trust them further than I could spit, so I plan on publishing this online before I don't have a way to interact with the outside world *at all.*

I started to first notice them on a Sunday morning after working a grueling second shift the night before. The truth is I almost didn't notice them at first, and I'm willing to bet you wouldn't have noticed them either. Do you know those green boxes that you see in front of houses sometimes? Those poorly camouflaged man-made objects that are just ugly enough to warrant you to look at them when you check your mailbox? Yeah, I'm talking about those. *Pad-mounted transformers*. I saw an extra one when I was pouring my morning coffee a few weeks ago.

At first, I just figured I had never noticed it before. Kind of like the Mandela effect if you will. But something told me that it had *always* been there. And that definitely couldn't have been right.

I moved into the spot I live in now about two years ago. Per my dad's guidance, I made a note of absolutely *everything* there was to make note of just in case something happened and I needed a record of how the place was when I got here. As soon as I saw the extra green box, I checked my notes which had some pictures as well.

In *none* of the pictures were two of those green boxes. A chill ran down my spine as I tried to recount the times I had looked out of my kitchen window and seen two of them. I couldn't recall there ever *not* being two, and I got this gut feeling that I had to investigate further. In hindsight, I shouldn't have.

Looking around my study where I kept my notes, and any other important documents, I turned my attention to my laptop sitting on my desk. Opening it, I swiftly logged in and navigated to an extension I had installed a while ago and promptly forgotten about; WS4U. It was a scarily cheap camera system I had installed when I first moved in. WS4U standing for We See 4 U. Yeah, I know, classy. Opening the live feed, I started to rewind. At first, it was by an interval of 3 hours. I went back a week. And still, there were two of them.

*""There's no way,""* I muttered aloud.

I started rewinding quicker. By about 8-hour intervals now, I went back another week. After about 5 days, and 16 hours, the green box simply disappeared. Between frames, it just *vanished*. Now with a time frame of about 8 hours to work with I shortened the intervals I was using to rewind. I now started to comb through the 8-hour interval in 30-minute chunks. After rewinding 4 times, and combing through two hours, I was able to pinpoint the exact time the extra green box appeared. 9:27 pm.

""*Gotcha,""* I whispered aloud. Saving the clip, I uploaded it to my cloud to make sure I would be able to access it easily the next time I needed to. I then decided to investigate the actual box itself. Stepping out of my house, I pulled the hoodie I was wearing over my head. It was pretty cool out, but not so cold it would be unbearable for a few minutes. I started to walk down my driveway, cutting through the grass covered in morning dew to get to the green box. I could feel the moisture from the grass soaking through my thin bunny slippers, but I didn't care. I was determined to figure out what the green box actually was.

Approaching it, I bent down and examined it carefully. There were no identifying tags, labels, or anything similar on the green box. It didn't even have a warning label like the actual one beside it had, which made it all the more suspicious. Carefully reaching out, I placed a hand on the box, and quickly pulled it back. It was *hot.* So hot a second longer would've probably left a burn.

It was as I was trying to figure out how this thing was emitting so much heat that I realized it had a latch. And that latch was holding two nearly imperceptible door-like openings closed. Reaching out again, I very carefully hovered my hand above the latch, feeling the heat it released warm my palm.

It seemed like the entire thing was emitting heat. Every. Single. Inch.

Getting up now, I knew I had to see what was inside. Looking back I don't know why I was so determined. I wish I wasn't.

I returned to my home and going into the kitchen I grabbed what I thought I might need. Some oven mitts, tongs, a hammer, and some thick skewers. I also grabbed my phone and a water bottle, and mentally prepared myself to open up the box.

Now wielding the tools that I believed would help me get to the bottom of the situation, I approached the box yet again. I poured the water over the latch, watching as it sizzled upon contact and evaporated into steam. I had already poured out the entire water bottle when I realized it wasn't cooling down.

So I enacted plan B, just as any level-headed person would do. I used the hammer to forcibly break the latch off.

It came off after a few hard *thwacks*, and landed in the grass directly beneath it. I quickly moved my feet out of the way, not willing to underestimate whatever this box was, and as such, I treated every piece of it as an alien entity. Unsurprisingly, the grass underneath it started to smoke.

Turning my attention back to the box I saw that the two door-like pieces were now slightly ajar. I used the tongs to try and force them open, but I had to stop after I realized the entire area immediately surrounding the box felt like the desert.

Taking off my hoodie, I felt that my entire body was already slick with sweat. I adjusted my stance, coming around the green box to stand behind it, before I opened the doors outwards, allowing the heat to escape into the air. I could see the air in front of the box *rippling* as the heat energy dissipated.

I waited a few minutes like this, to be sure I wouldn't faint or get burned, and when I was sure enough heat had escaped, I donned the oven mitts and tongs and prepared to look inside.

Nothing could have prepared me for what I saw.

Inside was much, much more vast than anything I had ever seen before. It appeared to be a very dark room that seemed to stretch on for miles. The room was illuminated by small, red lights and Immediately below the small doors was a set of stairs, that seemed to be an optical illusion. They looked much too steep for anyone to walk down without holding on to something, and they were suspended in air by seemingly nothing.

As stupid as it sounds I stuck my head in and held my phone out in front of me recording. I almost thought it was a little hidden bunker-type thing until I saw *them* staring back at me.

Hundreds of them, if not fucking thousands. Small bat-like creatures that looked vaguely humanoid. Their eyes were *piercing* and I don't know how I didn't notice them immediately. They were almost the same color as the wall, and the ends of their *wings* seemed to have sharp talon-like projections. They seemed to turn their heads in unison when I peered in and were all actively looking at me. Even now when I close my eyes all I see is their gigantic eyes. For Christ's sake, their eyes were insanely disproportionately large when compared to the size of their tiny heads.

""*I- I'm sorry*,"" I stuttered. It was a feeble attempt at saving my own skin. Quickly I withdrew my head and phone, and I scrambled to close the doors back and latch the box shut.

The oven mitts nearly slipped out of my hands, and the latch was still warm when I picked it up, but I got it closed. And you bet your ass I booked it into my house.

I had barely caught my breath when I looked back outside through the kitchen window and saw that the fake green box was now a few feet closer.

I blinked.

Now it was a few inches closer.

Fumbling for my phone I tried to call 911. Even if they didn't believe me at least I wouldn't be alone in whatever was about to happen. But the call wouldn't go through.

I tried to text my family, coworkers, or anyone, but the texts all failed to be delivered. Those small red exclamation marks letting me know they didn't go through seemed to laugh at me, humiliate me.

As I look up now I can no longer see the green box, but I can feel its warmth behind me.

I'm hoping that this reaches someone, or something, and maybe you can be better prepared for whatever this is.

Just know that if your texts haven't been going through, *it might already be too late.* ",7,1769834411.0,nosleep,0,0.89,False

It’s my first time playing FFXIV, and I already get a taste of how toxic the market can be...

Pyrite is set around 1,500 gil, so I listed mine at 1,490, which it felt like a fair compromise. (?)

Tbh I don’t really think that kind of undercutting really damages the market in any way 🤔😅

I’ve mine Pyrite ores listed for an entire week... AND there are people selling it for 200 gil... 👺

Same thing with Raw Larimar. I, actually, was soo excited to be able to mine and sell it! 🙃

I would to ask if this is something normal and if I really should, hmm how to say.. concern for this(?)

I saw that, normally goes for around 1,000 gil per piece, yet some, let's call them... “smart dudes”, list it for 200–300 gil per piece..

I’m new to FFXIV, and yes, I made this mistake once before fully understand how the interface of the market and the app, the retainer etc.. work..

I realized I messed up, corrected the price, and moved on.

But I see this becoming so constant, and it ends up ruining mine experience and the gaming exp for other miners and players as well. I believe..

I wake up in the morning, take my coffee, spend three chill hours mining ⛏️… and then I see this stuff on the market board, and honestly, it putting me down :/

My opinion, Square Enix should seriously consider implementing a minimum selling price.

Just thinking... it makes no sense.

If you’re able to farm 99 stacks of 99 items each, don’t you want 1,000 gil per piece? 🤔🤯

Why on earth would you sell everything for 200?

Am I wrong? Did I misunderstand how the things really work in FFX|V?

Ok about fast earnings but still is not a right thing for me, it's really pointless.",0,1769834267.0,ffxiv,11,0.08,False

I finally started writing the little baseball romance project I just recently posted about in another sub (and have been procrastinating).

Anyway, I chose the first three pages out of the ten I've written so see if it's interesting enough to want to keep reading. Feedback [(especially on prose (which is meant to feel a bit high-schoolish—I'm not a bad writer! I hope.. .), pacing, and maybe dialogue overusage?)] is greatly appreciated, although I'd be grateful for any input whatsoever. :)",5,1769833874.0,AspiringTeenAuthors,3,1.0,False
