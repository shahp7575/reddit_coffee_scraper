Apparently the liability shield applies if a vaccine is on the childhood vaccine schedule or if the vaccine is under the emergency use authorization. By requiring consultation and ending the emergency the vaccine manufacturers and the doctors prescribing them might have liability.

Any thoughts? I wonder if vaccinees could sign a waiver or if state laws could limit the liability. I am afraid that in practice the COVID shots will no longer be available to the people who want them even if they are in theory still available.

1n489p8,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1n489p8,I created a new OC from a dream I had.,"This character is supposed to be a dog and a fox kind of character. She has two fluffy tails, with more that can summon at anytime. She has two dragon (scaly) wings, which help with part aerial movement, and also balance, or as a cover for surgery. She has two very soft paws, meant to make her harmless, as she‚Äôs a healer. She has a mix between skin and fur, further pushing that fantasy style. She doesn‚Äôt do romance, or sexual stuff. She doesn‚Äôt drink, or smoke, and her voice is often quiet. She has markings on her belly and thighs that glow at night. 

She exists to heal. If somebody say: fell off something moving fast and got severely injured, she will use her magic to heal and restore wounds, however she cannot bring back the dead, so she‚Äôll probably get onto you so that you stay safe, and alive. 

There‚Äôs an extent to her powers, as it‚Äôs tied to her own energy. She doesn‚Äôt do coffee, or caffeine, which would interfere with magic, considering she‚Äôs ‚Äúpure‚Äù, and her magic only runs on her marks on her body, and the mental capacity to do so. 

She also does physical surgery if it‚Äôs extreme. Say: you got into a car accident and your chest hurts (as in it‚Äôs probably destroyed), she will use magic to make you asleep, and she will try to repair the ribs, but she can‚Äôt do much for organ transplant since that‚Äôs out of her medical knowledge (because she isn‚Äôt taught by anybody) 

She‚Äôs missing a name. She lives in a ‚Äúutopian fantasy‚Äù although accidents still happen because it‚Äôs human nature (although she isn‚Äôt even 1% human) ",1,1756577065.0,YourOriginalCharacter,0,1.0,False

1n480az,https://www.reddit.com/r/CreepCast_Submissions/comments/1n480az/wax_the_wasp/,WAX / The Wasp,"CW/spoilers: This is an extreme horror leaning story and covers the topics of >!sexual assault, suicide and self harm!< all ranging in severity.

The first signs of his presence were subtle, near unnoticeable and easily excusable. I thought that I was just losing track of time when my scented candles began burning out faster than usual, but when the time shrank even more, I began to blame it on the manufacturers tinkering with the formula to save money. But then again, the time ticked down lower and sank below an hour. Somewhat confused, I stuck with the half a dozen extra I had bought a few weeks before and switched to another brand

I used to stock pile my candles to save myself constant trips to the store, often having one burning away in the background while I worked at my desk. The smooth aromas of scented oils and wax helped calm my mind while work chipped away at my sanity.

Working from home, while conceptually superior to cubicle hell, was socially depriving; no conversations other than over-edited emails and one-sided calls sent me down a pit of isolation that my only lifelong friend, Emma, had noticed too.

I spun my chair away from my work desk and walked over to the door while making plans with her on the phone. next to the door, on top of a bedside table, sat the candle. The glass jar of wax was already half empty, and the remaining half was split in two, with the top molten, and the bottom solid. I blew out the three softly flickering flames and stepped out of the room, still talking to Emma.

""No seriously, it's too much, you should---"" Emma spoke, concerned

""I know, I know"" I cut her off ""just going thought a rough patch at work right now. It'll settle down in a week and I'll get my shit together"" I said as I poured my sixth cup of coffee.

""Alright, just... be a little easy on yourself""

""I am""

""Sure, sure"" She said sarcastically before continuing ""Ok well, I gotta' go, see you soon""

""yeah, see you"" I responded, hung up the call, slid the phone into my pocket and began carrying the coffee back to my office turned bedroom.

As I entered the room, Tones of vanilla and cinnamon (scents unoriginal to the candle) braided into hefty ropes of stench and slithered up my nostrils, restricting my breathing. I momentarily disregarded them, and continued the walk back to my desk. Half way into the room, I began to cough as the weight of waxy condensation in the air sunk to the base of my lungs. The coughing fit was dry and uncontrollable, my throat flared and I began to gasp for breath, but all I got was another huff of dewy lavender. My eyesight narrowed and the walls begin to close in on me.

My heartbeat was out of control and pattered in irregularity. I had to breath, and for that, I had to leave the room. The mug shattered on the floor while I was preoccupied, clawing at my throat, fighting to breath as the thick musk of synthetic smells kept flowing through me.

I fell to the floor near the doorway and crawled the rest of the way. Finally catching a thick inhale of stale, warm air.

The regulation of my heart and lungs took fifteen minutes of sitting, curled up on the floor with my back up to a wall. In that time, the coffee had managed to fully soak into the carpet, and the stench had diluted into a faint and somewhat pleasant presence.

The self-diagnosis, which was supported by Emma, was a panic attack. Everything from the racing heartbeat, to the struggling to breathe were blamed on my exhausted, overworked mind over shitty, cheap drinks at a bar that, to my delight, had an ever-shrinking crowd of five.

I got home just after midnight, took a shower, and slid into bed. In my semi-drunken state, I absentmindedly leaned over towards the candle to light it, ignoring the fact that only a fourth of it remained, while the bare wicks stood tall, over two inches higher than the wax itself. With the candle set, I leaned up against the headboard of my bed and tried to get some reading in, before quickly falling into a coma of drunken exhaustion.

The unbearable noise brought me back into the blinding brightness of a light I had forgotten to turn off, and the return of a nose melting, artificial stench of flowers and baked goods. Gargling and slurping whirled around my bedroom and in the center of the undecorated, white wall stood a contrasting gray blob. It towered over me, standing with its head nearly touching the ceiling.

A creeping horror slowly spread across my body, and a single thought invaded my mind ""I am not ready for this"" the thing I learned in that moment is that while we've all thought about how we'd deal with an intruder, none of us really mean it. I had planned of turning to primitive violence to defend myself, but didn't think much past the base line, because deep down, I believed that I was above it. I thought that it only happened to others and all precautions were just highly unlikely to come into use. So, when I was faced with reality, I had nothing to turn to, not a pen to use as a knife or a well angled tackle. I was afraid, and I was unsure.

Paralyzed, I stared at the figure as it slowly drifted into focus. The blurry outline slowly took up the shape of a human, he must have been at least seven feet tall, bloated, and naked. His body covered in a greasy finish, and his half-decomposed flesh, covered in open sores and scars, oozing thin, watery pus.

I raised my vision up to his face, and that is when I saw its lips, protruding from his face like the trunk of an elephant split in half. The long tube of meat flowed from his face and down to the jar, where it was used like the proboscis of a mosquito to suck up the wax.

He did not look at me, he just stood up right, staring straight ahead, while emptying the jar with loud gulps. When done, he retracted his lips back to his face. They wrapped around his bloated tongue that had grown too big to be contained, and pried his jaw open. He took two long steps backwards and opened my bedroom door so that he was pinned between it, and the wall.

His head peered at me from over the door, smiling to the best of his ability. The wax lathered across his lips cracking as it began to dry. Then the smile quickly dropped and he again puckered his lips, letting them stretch out. The prodding meat swayed left and right, slithering through the air like a snake sliding through tall grass, over to my petrified, still frozen body. my mind begged me to jerk away but I was forced into compliance. Forced into sitting still and feeling him place an oily kiss on my cheek. His lips were unusually hot and firm. The urge to vomit bubbled up in my throat as his lips broke suction with a loud pop. He then retracted them, and ducked his head under the door.

The puke streaming out of my mouth broke the seal of my paralysis. I toppled over, letting the half-digested alcohol flow out of me. The purge of my intestinal contents made me feel cleaner; felt as if I was expelling whatever part of him, I had inhaled. But nothing could clean the spot where he had kissed me. I clawed at my cheek until it bled and blasted wound with hot water while waiting for the police to arrive, but still, I felt the memory of his hot breath and his waxy, slick lips pressing into me.

The police were not much help; they wrote up a trespassing report as nothing was stolen, and there were no signs of a break in. They obviously did not believe my manic ramblings about the nude corpse with retractable lips that drank candlewax and wrote it off as a trauma response of fictionalization.

Emma came over just as the cops were finishing up, and offered to let me sleep over at her apartment. This was not out of the ordinary. Having been friends since early childhood, both me and Emma have been there for each other at our lowest, which often meant giving up our couch for the other to sleep on; whether it was breakups, an eviction after the loss of a job or a seven-foot-tall wax drinking squatter, it was comforting to know that we both had a shoulder to lean on.

The stay was supposed to be short, but I soon gave up on the thought of returning to my apartment, as just the mere thought of stepping foot in that building made my skin begin to itch. Instead, I prolonged my stay at Emma's while I trudged thought the hellhole of apartment listings.

For some time, I thought I was safe, in fact, the next few weeks were rather peaceful. Work began to ease up and spending time around Emma made me feel less isolated. I did not tell her about what had truly happened that night. All she knew is that I woke up to a man in my apartment, and that it had triggered a fear of candles. It was vague, and I know it left her unsatisfied, but she did not question me any further out of worry for triggering more.

My mixture of refusing to talk about him, and a dismissal of his next attempts at a re-entrance gave him more of a say in his power. And soon, the shadows looming in corners, just out of my sight, became constants. His presence became debilitating. Every night, after a hail of nightmares, I would struggle to open my eyes, knowing that his shadow would be looming just out of sight, for a fraction of a second. I began to move slower, pivoting my head so that my vision would not blur and give him space to hang in the edges of sight.

Walking past open doorways became a problem too; unblinking, I stared down all the open doorways. I walked past them slowly, taking it all in, leaving no room for error, no space for a hung coat that he could hide next to or a closet door he could blend in with, but my attempts were futile.

There is an empty underside of a bed for each closet in the apartment, and three dark corners for each open doorway. No matter how hard I tried to keep him at bay, he always found a gap to peek out of, he always moved closer, and he became more indiscreet with his presence.

For that long, painful week, I saw his bloated gray form inch closer to me, from corner to corner. until he trapped me.

I had just gotten off the living room couch and walked over to the kitchen. The room was narrow, to the left were a small dining table, some counter space, and a stove, and to the right were a fridge, a trash can, and some more counter space, split in half by a sink.

The smell hit me instantly, and before I could double back, I saw him standing between the fridge and the counter, the trash can that usually sat between them, toppled over on the floor and its contents lying in a pile.

A familiar paralysis took over me, I could neither push my body nor weaken it, I was frozen in place.

He stepped out from behind the fridge, planting his flakey, scab ridden foot onto a rotten banana with a wet sputter.

""wh... what d... do you want?"" I managed to spew out the stuttering mess of a sentence and followed it up with ""Please just... just leave me alone""

He stared at me in silence for a minute straight, letting me reluctantly take in his greasy and bloated nude form. Once satisfied with my disgust, he raised his right hand into the air, spanked it onto his gut and began slowly sliding it in circles.

I looked at him confused, thinking of what he had meant before, ""What? you're... hungry?"" I spat out with a quivering voice.

He began to nod, sharply looking up and down, his neck snapping at the midst of each movement.

""Oh... okay... I can do that for you, but... please just leave me alone"" I pleaded with my voice spiraling down into incoherence.

The termination of skin hissing against skin was the only answer I received before he squeezed his fat ridden body back into a gap half his width, and bent over backwards, letting the crackling, snapping of his bones echo off the tile walling. The smell faded soon after and I dropped to the floor, hyperventilating.

I had no time for doubts, no time to question the absurdity of what I'd been tied up into, all I could do was comply.

Storming out of the apartment, I only stopped to lock the door as I left, and ran to the nearest store. The people on the sidewalks stared at me in confusion as I sprinted past them with tears rolling down my face, but the only stare I cared for was his. He followed me all the way to the store, staring at me from the backs of passing cars, empty storefronts, and gaps between yellowing leaves. In the near-empty store, he stood in deserted isles, staring in self-righteous satisfaction as I looked for the candles. And I found them, tucked away in a corner, next to the cleaning supplies. With no care for the price, I randomly snatched three off the shelves, and awkwardly balanced the bulky jars as I made my way over to the self-checkout.

Despite my best attempts to stop it, the door to Emma's apartment slammed open and echoed down the hollow lobby of the building. A glance at the clock on the wall noted that she would be home in just 2 hours, so I had to make this quick.

The candle-full bag clattered down onto the dining table and I walked deeper into the kitchen for a lighter that hung beside the malfunctioning stove.

While lighting the wicks, I could not bear to watch the flames. And when the job was done, I sprinted back into the living room, waiting for the smell to grow stronger and for my limbs to grow weak.

Thirty minutes after I lit the candles, I heard him begin to drink. There were loud slurps before each distinct gulp. It made me sick to hear his muffled groans of pleasure, and the fact that I had helped him made the feeling worse.

The noise stopped as abruptly as it began, But fear held me back from checking if he was gone. Thirty more minutes were spent in terrorized, still, silence; flinching at any and every noise before he started up again. I plugged my ears and pushed my palms up to my eyes, not hearing the click of the door unlocking.

Emma did not see me, and neither did I until she turned the corner to enter the kitchen. A flame burst open in my stomach like I had swallowed a grenade. I jumped to my feet and sprinted to the kitchen, expecting her to let out a gut-ripping screech. Turning the corner, with panic wrinkling my face, I saw that he was gone. Instead, I was met with a concerned Emma, bouncing her focus between the candles and the spilled garbage, before finally looking up at me.

""Hey, what's going on here?"" she asked, turning around to my manic, tear ridden face ""oh my god, are you okay?"" her voice was full of worry and care, but I was too busy in scanning the room to answer.

I darted my eyes around the room until they suddenly met with his, peering out from a cupboard. My knees buckled and I began to fall, grabbing onto the table on my way down to catch my balance, but scattering the bag of groceries instead.

""Shit!"" she crouched down next to me ""hey, hey, are you okay?""

""yeah"" I answered, disregarding the pain radiating through my body

""Are you sure? want me to call an ambulance? you almost fainted there"" she said and hooked her arm around mine, helping me sit up. I looked over to the cupboard again, he was gone, and going off the near empty jars, I guessed that he was satisfied.

""No, I'm good... just... I thought I could handle it"" I broke down sobbing even further. Now, not out of fear, but exhaustion. Even though they might have been misinterpreted, the words I spoke to Emma were true.

""Hey, it's ok"" she pulled me into her arms ""shit like this... facing trauma, it just takes time. Do not beat yourself up over not being able to handle this, you are not any weaker for it, okay?""

""O... Okay"" I mumbled out between sobs.

""Just give it time, don't force it, and you'll get over it. and if you plan on doing something like this again, please, don't do it alone""

I did not respond, I just sat, sobbing in silence with her caring warmth wrapped around me. I reluctantly pushed her away when my tears began to dry up, and she began cleaning up the mess.

""You don't mind if I throw these away, right?"" she asked, picking the empty jars off the table.

""No, you're good""

""What is this? Garden rain, juicy watermelon? Soft... cashmere amber? All at the same time? Wha... what were you trying to achieve here"" she said and waited for a response on whether she had joked too soon.

""I'm right there with you, I have no idea"" I said with a mild chuckle and felt Emma breathe a sigh of relief before plastering her face with a prideful grin. ""I thought you got off work at eight?"" I asked after thirty seconds of awkward silence.

""Yeah, I do, but they let me off early today"" She answered and picked up a bag of chips off the floor

""Oh, nice. well, speaking of work"" I said while slipping out of the chair ""I gotta go finish something up""

She let me go with some hesitation, letting me walked back into the living room, where I sat down in front of my make shift work desk. The setup was cramped, with a laptop on a tiny foldable table only leaving a few inches of free space, but I had to make do.

I finished up the little work I had due for the day, thankful that the demand for me had not picked up, and spent the rest of the night, mindlessly scrolling through the mess of apartment listings, while occasionally darting my vision back up at the shitty, 80's horror movie Emma had dug out from the depths of obscurity. As the night drifted on, the images of empty, white-walled rooms and cheap practical effects dulled my mind into sleep.

A pounding headache, a stinging, dry throat, and the sound of pooling rain hissing outside welcomed me as I awoke. I reached my had out from the back corner of the couch and ran my hand across the keyboard, lighting up the screen and blinding myself in return. After trying to rub the shooting pain out of my eyes, I looked to the screen again, it was four in the morning. My throat clamped at its dryness and my nose burnt. I groaned at the pain and squinted my eyes again. My nose burnt, and for a brief moment I could not place why, until the smell of the conglomerated, scented oils struck my mind like smelling salts, and I shot to my feet. A life of living in apartments screaming at me to walk gentler as I ran towards Emma's bedroom.

Finally, after what had felt like an eternity, I was standing in front of Emma's bedroom with my nose buried in my inner elbow. The door was cracked open and a dim slit of light poked out from the gap. I pushed the door open with my left hand while still covering my nose.

Even though I could not see much, everything inside seemed fine under the barely present light of a lamp. Sure, there were shadows in odd corners of the room, but under a quick inspection they all seemed pure from his filthy presence.

I took a step into the gaping doorway, slowly inching deeper into the room. Watching the still bump in the bed grow closer and Emma's face become more defined, until I could finally make out her features. she was awake, but no, she could not have been. Even though her eyes were wide open they never blinked, she did not even breathe. As I again moved closer, I finally managed to fully make out a single drop of liquid that dribbled out of the corner of her mouth and clung to her cheek. my eyes traced the cream-colored path back towards her mouth, first up her cheek then between the corner of her mouth and finally, behind her teeth. There, instead of her tongue, or the roof of her mouth, I saw a wall of solid wax. My head began to spin and my sight blurred. With a vomit brewing throat, I stumbled back into the living room and over to my phone; crashing into walls along the way.

I kept replaying the same thoughts that riddled my mind just a few weeks before as I struggled to dial 911 with trembling hands. I thought of the fear I had felt when I first saw him, the disgust as he kissed me. And then, I imagine Emma, waking up to him gaping her open and pouring the muck inside of her. I can feel the confusion, the powerlessness and hatred. It feels as though, an image of the pure anguish I saw that night has been heated red and branded into my mind.

I could have saved her, if I had not cowered in fear of being perceived as crazy, if I had told her what happened, If I had not brought the bastard to her, she would still be alive.

But she's not.

I watched her bloated, desecrated corpse get hauled out of the building while the cops desperately tried to get any words out of me. Hours later, they took me into questioning and I told them the truth that fell on deaf ears.

For two long and painful weeks, I was the main suspect for the death of Emma, but a lack of evidence, the mental state I was found in, the support of Emma's parents, and a good lawyer helped me avoid any sentencing.

The day of my release, I was hit with a fact that nearly drove me to suicide. Emma's autopsy reports were a hard read, the details on poisoning, and burns, both internal and external had ignited a fire withing me, a fire that scorched my gut and inflamed my breath. My sight blurred while I forced myself to read each word, whether I understood what they meant or not. I took them in, my anger swelling with each word. And then, there it was, in plain black ink, scribbled down with no bias or space for interpretation 'forced vaginal penetration' and '3rd degree, internal, vaginal burns'

The words sent me down a spiral of self-hatred and grief stronger than anything I had experience in my life. I was near catatonic, only getting out of bed to either piss or smoke. My mind gave up on remembering, so the first three days of my freedom became a long blur.

Emma's parents took me in during this time. They were understanding. Spent long, one sided conversations trying to pacify my guilt, and grieved her death right beside me. We waited in dread for the day that she would be put into the earth, and fully discarded as her essence moved on past the plane of our presence. A burial was a new experience for Emma's family, since they had come from a tradition of cremations, but the amount of wax inside of her made the cremation impossible. So, they bought the plot of land and the tombstone, picked out her casket while grasping each-others wrinkled hands and holding back tears, planning a funeral for their only child, that would never happen.

I was back in the guest bedroom when the doorbell rang. I paid it no mind preferring to continue brewing in awkward melancholy while the muffled voices outside exchanged distorted words, words that began to be accented by distinct weeps. Out of curiosity, I peeled my body from a day long crust of dried sweat and walked over to the window, carefully sliding it open to keep the aged wooden frame from creaking.

""The security footage from last night is clear"" One of the officers spoke in a monotone, but near stern voice ""there are only a few artifacts in the footage, but those last for a few seconds at most"" Emma's mom let out yelp ""Don't worry ma'am, that's actually good, It means that her remains are still in the building, they're just... misplaced. We have informed the staff to keep an eye out and sent in a small group to search the building""

The faults in the lies grew with the tone of discomfort in his voice, and it soon became clear to me that they did not know where she was. But I knew, and the knowledge filled me with rage that bubbled out of my bloodshot eyes.

He gave us the illusion of liberty from his destruction, and when we had thought that we were free of him, that we had the control to grieve in venerability, he stepped back out of the shadows to crush our hopes.

I stepped back from the window, lost on what to do and crashed into a scolding hot, towering mass that stood as solid as a wall. The heat seared my back, a pain like thousands of needs prodding at my skin, and I fell forward, missing the windowsill by just an inch.

It took me a few seconds to gather my thoughts, The compounding, pent-up emotions came brimming. I was done with being the submissive victim, I could not bear to sit still in fear while the man that killed Emma terrorized me. I had to fight back.

Spinning on one knee, I turned away from the window, pushed one foot up against the wall and grounded myself with the other, before leaping over towards the bed. I landed just a foot away and used the forward momentum to slide the rest of the way; the texture of the carpet was grating, and stripped the top layers of skin from my arms.

My fingers wrapped around the firm handle of a machete I had bought in manic paranoia, and I sat up, quickly unlatching the strap that kept the blade within its sheathe.

Gazing back at him, he was unmoving, still staring at the window, but his lips were reaching out to me. I jumped to my feet and cut thought them with surprising ease. The cut mass of wax fell to the floor with a thud and squirted a chunky brown liquid, just like the slit on the stump it had been cut from. Another slash at the lips freed up space for me to step in closer. I took another step with the next cut of the waxy meat and realized that what I was doing was pointless. He showed no care for the loss of flesh, not even a wince and the lips kept on elongating and prodding at me. I had to charge him, and stick the blade into his chest, that was the only way. So, I continued stepping in even closer while chipping off a few inches at a time until I was standing just under three feet from him.

The blade poked into his side, right between his ribs, sliding in, down to the handle... nothing. No signs of pain, not even a single sound, just the continued gurgling, and heaving. I tugged at the blade, but it did not budge. The slobbering lips began to slither up my back, and I tugged again, nothing. The lips began to coil around my neck and I pulled once more while letting out an anguished war cry, nothing. The weight of the lips forced me to the ground and this time, in a moment of reactionary idiocy, I screamed for help, gaping my mouth wide open and letting him slither down my throat. I reached my hands up, trying to pull him out of me by clawing at his slick and oily flesh while boiling hot chemicals seared my esophagus. I gagged but he was too deep inside of me for anything to escape through my throat. I tried to breathe, but the bubbling snot had clogged my nose.

How fucking stupid of me to have fallen for the same trap of pointless precautions. I had reverted to the primitive violence I should have learned to distrust, thinking that I could take him down with the hack of a machete. Now, I sat in the only place I had felt safe, a room I could not bring myself to call home, fighting for breath, with the only hope for survival being the scrambling of footsteps running up the stairs. I thought of Emma while gallons of scorching, hot wax poured into me, I had failed her again.

My eyesight began to blur while the cops worked on kicking the door down. I wanted to stab myself in the chest, carve a gaping funnel to let the liquid flame pour out of me, but my limbs fell limp. The anguish of my bloated, blistering organs sent my mind into shock and I went into a coma.

The darkness, even though highly temporary, was the most piece I had felt in weeks, it was a sigh of relief through momentary non-existence, I had no body, no mind, no fear or shame. But as soon as the tranquil darkness had entered my life, it phased into another, more present darkness, a darkness where I was.

My muscles still tensed in fear as I finished the transition into the new dark. The air was humid with the misty dew of chemical odor. With a hazy mind, I reached out my hands and felt around the irregular ground, it was covered in lumps and arching tendril like branches that rose from the ground and twisted thought the air, taking a sharp turn before sinking underground again. All of it was wax.

With my Hands grazing past the small pits and bumps in the ground, I crawled deeper into the darkness, hoping to hit a wall that I could use as a guide. But the wall never came. Instead in the distance, far deeper past the jagged shade, a tiny, flickering, yellow light began to guide my way. I crawled faster, inching ever near to the distant promise of sight. My knee bushed past the weaker of the wax pillars and it plundered with a reverberating snap. A few steps later, my right hand landed in a puddle full of mushy, moist mass, it was hot and covered in a layer of mucus that clung to my skin.

As the light grew closer, so did the strength of my sight. The murky, cream color of the wax came more apparent, and so did the shapes etched within it. They were faces, and torsos, gaping assholes, cunts and cocks, all humans turned to wax and forced to join the conglomerate of this tunnel. The thicker pillars I had felt were arms and legs; the thinner ones were fingers and erect penises. They all protruded from the ground, walls and ceilings, melting in and out of the surfaces.

Not all of them stood alone though, as some arms protruded out of orifices and some prodded at them. Fear stricken, Swollen heads melted into one another at the forehead. Bare, scrotum-less, testicles hung out of the nose of a man with gouged out eyes.

These putrid images of bodies frozen in time stuck to my mind like tumors, constricting blood flow and weighing me down. I cursed the light as I passed a free hanging foot, sliding its big toe into the urethrae of a bulging penis. The sights were purposefully crass, and disrespectful, clear attempts at mockery, designed to force me back into the liberating ignorance of the dark. But I fought on, drifting past the ever-worsening filth that covered the walls of the gaping tunnel.

I tried to focus on the light itself, watched as it grew larger, and stronger. It was beautiful, fascinating to the point where I could not look away, even as it began to char my eyes. It was salvation, a form of rebellion to another one of his games.

The light was all around me now, I could not see anything but it. I accepted its warmth and closed my eyes.

Pained screaming erupted all around me as soon as my eyelids shut completely, the deafening volume forcing them open to darkness. disbelief staggered me backwards as a chorus of orgasmic moaning joined the wall of noise, accompanying the dim light flickering on overhead.

I was still in the tunnel, with the wax-turned bodies around me. They were moving now. Some arms and legs flailed through the air; some faces begged for escape and others begged for more. I was standing in the middle of a swirling orgy of wax, both solid and pouring, hearing the rhythmic squelching of penetration. And at the end of it stood the man himself, watching the commotion like a satisfied orchestral conductor. Emma stood to his left, just as exposed as the rest of them. Her eyes were glazed over, her face so distant from any emotion, that it made it hard to believe I was looking at the Emma I had known all my life.

""please, let her go"" I looked over to him, and begged with a voice poisoned by fear, gaining nothing but a neutral grunt in return. ""What do you want from me? Why me?"" I shouted back at him, not expecting to get a response, but he turned to Emma and raised his hand to her chest. ""DON'T FUCKING TOUCH HER!"" The rage boomed down the tunnel, cutting past the still ringing chaos of screaming, squelching ecstasy.

I tried to run to them, but didn't make it far before a swinging arm gripped my ankle and sent me falling to my chest. I flailed, trying to kick the hand off of me, tried to crawl, tried to scream, but the wind had been knocked out of my lungs and I had been pinned to the floor. All I could do was watch as he dug his index finger Into Emma's chest, and slid it down, melting her flesh. The wound bled, but she stood still in her subservient haze. I tried to deny it, thought to look for a way to save her, but as he finished carving the first letter into her chest, I knew that she was too far gone.

A bloody, throbbing 'P' sat just next to her right shoulder, and a few seconds later, it was followed up by a crudely formed 'R' I felt sick, watching Emma be turned into a canvas, an object to be painted at his discretion, but I could not do much more than watch as the next letters that came in quick secession 'E' more hands grasped my body 'T' they began dragging me backwards 'T' my skin began to bubble as I was submerged down into the now liquid ground 'Y' my head dipped under the surface.

I had returned to a darkness again, now swimming in a deep pool of boiling heat. My body began to melt and floated out, mixing with the waste of liquid human around me. I knew I did not have much time, so I began to flail once more, trying to swim up to the surface. My toes and my fingers were the first to go, I felt as each muscle and tendon slathered off my body. Then it was my arms and legs. As each tendon snapped, my mobility worsened, forcing me to relearn how to swim. Next, it was the flesh on my chest and my ribs.

And then I felt it, fascinating beauty, salvation, rebellion. It enveloped me again. The light.

I pushed harder, swinging raw bone through the muck, ignoring the guts pouring out of me and the shriveling of my organs. It was there, it was all around me, I sunk into its embrace, felt the caring warmth carry me upwards at the speed of light.

I did not question, I did not wait, it was all a means to an end. My feet pattered on the cold tile flooring of the hospital, and my eyes searched. I picked up a bottle of rubbing alcohol from a rolling tray. No one had seen me, and concerningly, the beeping of the machines had not alerted anyone, though I was not complaining. I snatched the lighter from the pocket of a sleeping man, slumped over on a waiting chair, right outside a room and across the hallway from the bathroom I stepped into, stumbling over to one of the stalls.

I cursed my selfishness and my weakness, but I could not fight anymore. I did not have the energy to save Emma, I doubted that it was even possible, all I could do was save myself.

I uncapped the rubbing alcohol and dumped it over my head, the quick movement sending a sharp pain though my gut. The lighter took three clicks to flair on and light me ablaze. I chocked at the toxic stench of burning hair and cooking flesh, but I welcomed the pain, made the heat that had tormented me my own, defiant weapon that molded the body subject to obsession, to my liking.

Over the next month, I got to savor the pain as I rotted in hospital beds, distantly watching as the doctors cared for my scar stretched skin.

In the isolating shade of the night, I morn the life I lost while tears, tainted by the flavor of cheap beer flow down to my now flat lips. Angered by having to face the disgusted looks of passerby in the day. I morn the normalcy of conversation without performative open-mindedness, I morn the hopes for a stable future and I morn a lifelong friendship that was stripped naked and sodomized for momentary gratification.",1,1756576415.0,CreepCast_Submissions,0,1.0,False

1n47wvq,https://www.reddit.com/r/TeethWhiteningTips/comments/1n47wvq/has_anyone_noticed_real_results_with_purely_white/,Has anyone noticed real results with Purely White Deluxe Powder? My take after digging into it,"I‚Äôve been down the road of teeth whitening enough times to know that a lot of products sound better on the box than they feel in your mouth. Strips, gels, LED kits, whitening toothpaste‚Ä¶ I‚Äôve tried most of them. Some work a little, some cause brutal sensitivity, and some are just hype. Recently, I kept seeing people mention **Purely White Deluxe Powder**, so I decided to actually look into what it is, what‚Äôs in it, and how it‚Äôs supposed to work.

**What is Purely White Deluxe Powder?**  
It‚Äôs described as a **purely white teeth whitening powder** that aims to do three things at once: whiten teeth, repair enamel, and freshen breath. The main difference from many whitening options is that it‚Äôs peroxide-free, so it‚Äôs marketed as safer for sensitive teeth.

The three core ingredients are:

* **PAP+** ‚Äì A whitening agent that targets stains without using peroxide.
* **Hydroxyapatite** ‚Äì A mineral your teeth are naturally made of, used here to strengthen enamel.
* **CPC (Cetylpyridinium Chloride)** ‚Äì An antimicrobial that helps reduce bacteria linked to bad breath.

So instead of just bleaching teeth, it‚Äôs designed to work on stain removal and overall oral health at the same time.

**How to use Purely White Deluxe Powder**  
From what I‚Äôve found, the process is simple. Wet your toothbrush, tap off excess water, dip into the powder, and brush for 1‚Äì2 minutes. You can use it with or without toothpaste. People seem to like that it doesn‚Äôt require extra gadgets or lengthy sessions.

If you want to see the exact steps, here‚Äôs the official guide: [**Purely White Deluxe Powder instructions**](https://getpurelywhitedeluxe.com/offer-01/?lpid=1064&source_id=DL&utm_source=8928&utm_medium=&utm_term=1064&aff_id=8928&sub_id=&req_id=&oid=1064&device_type=&country_name=&oid=1064&affid=8928&source_id=Rddt&sub1=r/TeethWhiteningTips|AbedAwadi).

**Purely White Deluxe Powder reviews: what people are saying**  
While there are plenty of positive reviews, not all of them are over-the-top. Some users say they saw a noticeable difference in a few uses, especially in surface stains from coffee or wine. Others describe it as more of a gradual brightening over two weeks or so. The stand-out feedback seems to come from people who usually get sensitivity from whitening but didn‚Äôt with this.

I‚Äôve also seen mentions of teeth feeling smoother and breath staying fresher for hours after brushing. On the flip side, a few reviews mention it didn‚Äôt produce dramatic whitening, so expectations matter. You can browse more personal experiences here: [**Purely White Deluxe Powder reviews**](https://getpurelywhitedeluxe.com/breaking-news/?lpid=2662&source_id=DL&utm_source=8928&utm_medium=&utm_term=1064&aff_id=8928&sub_id=&req_id=&oid=1064&device_type=&country_name=&uid=2662&oid=1064&affid=8928&source_id=Rddt&sub1=r/TeethWhiteningTips|AbedAwadi).

**Does Purely White Deluxe Powder work?**  
It seems to depend on what you‚Äôre expecting. If you want a quick jump of 5 shades in one day, that‚Äôs probably not realistic without professional bleaching. But for a more gradual change without the downsides of peroxide, it sounds like a lot of people are happy with it. The enamel support and bacteria-fighting element are also a bonus if you care about long-term dental health.

**Is Purely White Deluxe Powder safe?**  
Based on what‚Äôs published about it, it‚Äôs peroxide-free, alcohol-free, and fluoride-free. The ingredients have been used in dentistry for years, and it‚Äôs made in an FDA-registered facility. Of course, like with any dental product, if you have specific conditions, crowns, or veneers, it‚Äôs best to check with your dentist before using it.

**Final thoughts**  
The combination of whitening, enamel repair, and fresh breath in one step is interesting. The low-effort routine means you‚Äôre more likely to stick with it, and the lack of peroxide makes it appealing for people with sensitivity issues. Just keep in mind it may be a slow and steady process rather than instant results.

So, has anyone here used **Purely White Deluxe Teeth Whitening Powder** consistently for a month or more? I‚Äôm especially curious to hear from people who switched from peroxide-based products and whether it held up to daily use without sensitivity.",1,1756576176.0,TeethWhiteningTips,0,1.0,False

My favorite thing to do is to find neighborhoods I haven‚Äôt been to, find a podcast that talks about the area if possible, maybe have one destination like a museum or coffee shop in mind, but otherwise just wander and explore. I‚Äôve run through the bucket list I‚Äôve had, and am looking for new places. Does your neighborhood have gorgeous architecture? A small weird museum? A good graveyard or park? A random street or two that feel like a different world? 

I feel I‚Äôve covered the north side well and the fan favorites like Chinatown, Logan Square, Hyde Park. My personal favorites have been Bridgeport, Ukrainian Village, Pullman, and Bronzeville. The more specific the better, down to street paths or specific businesses! Interesting small businesses are always fun, but I‚Äôm not looking for just a strip of window shopping.

HOP (Chapter 2)


¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†I strode out of my room and faced Savesh, gesturing vaguely at my new clothes.

¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†‚ÄúHow‚Äôd I do?‚Äù I asked, looking him in the eye. ‚ÄúBe honest.‚Äù

¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†He looked me up and down and nodded at first, then his eye caught something and he looked uncertain. His hesitation was helping neither my ego nor my appearance so I decided to nip the formality in the bud.

¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†‚ÄúLook, man‚ÄìSavesh. I don‚Äôt know what‚Äôs happening here. I‚Äôve never worn these clothes before, or anything like them, and I‚Äôve never been called lord by anyone and don‚Äôt need anyone to. I need help.‚Äù

¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†He looked at me with a cautious skepticism which, to his credit, turned quickly to something more like curiosity.

¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†‚ÄúRight. You are truly from another world,‚Äù he concluded. After another beat he nodded with more confidence and led me back into my room, then had me take off the belt so he could examine my attempt at fantasy fashion. He ended up retying the clothes in a few places and pulling some fabric to lie differently on my body. When he was done, I belted up again, and he gave me one last look before seeming satisfied.

¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†He led me through more stone hallways adorned with plants and tapestries. The way was lit by oil lamps set into regularly-spaced coppery sconces, and sometimes by tall vertical slits in the stone which let in cool morning light and brisk air. We went up a stairwell, passed a few others in green robes standing around holding spears‚Äìguards, I guessed‚Äìand proceeded past a room whose busy sounds were paired with the aroma of things freshly baked and delicious, roasted‚Ä¶ something. My mouth watered and my empty stomach protested as we walked away from the kitchen, but I was headed to breakfast after all.

¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†Finally we turned to walk through a door flanked by two more guards. Bright light flooded my vision as I stepped outside for the first time since whatever had happened to me. It was very different from the warm lamplight inside, and it took a moment for my eyes to adjust. When they did, I saw that I wasn't really outside; there was another tiled ceiling, and the daylight filtered through wooden latticework serving as the outermost wall, carved into intricate patterns similar to the geometry of the hallway tapestries. It screened out the details of its other side, offering a compromise between natural light and privacy. To my right, a large fire blazed and crackled in an open hearth and threw off a welcome warmth, since a chilly draft crept through the lattice. The temperature was odd for summer‚Äìwas it summer? It struck me then that my phone had said it was nighttime. Was time totally different here? I supposed it wouldn‚Äôt matter if I could convince them to send me home. Savesh had stopped and taken up a post beside the doorway.

¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†Alyi sat at the long side of a rectangular wooden table, on a bench draped in thick furs. She stood when she saw me enter, and gestured towards the bench opposite her.¬†

¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†‚ÄúWelcome,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúPlease sit, and make yourself comfortable. The first course will be served presently.‚Äù

¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†I nodded gamely and approached my assigned bench. The air grew even colder as I approached the porous wooden wall, then, to my grateful confusion, suddenly warmed. I sat on the furs, which were surprisingly comfortable, and when I did so Alyi sat again as well. As if on cue, three figures in hooded green entered, two of whom placed covered earthenware bowls before us, while the third laid down a narrow dish containing a large carrot. They deftly peeled the carrot and then halved it lengthwise with a knife, then used another, unfamiliar implement to scoop out a bit of the thick end of each half. Finally, the green shoot was cut off,¬† coverings were lifted from the bowls to reveal a steaming soup, and the third servant placed what were apparently two carrot-spoons into the soup. The three backed away from us, bowing, then exited. The steam wafting from the soup smelled absolutely divine.

¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†‚ÄúDo you have carrots in your world?‚Äù asked Alyi conversationally.

¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†I was a little taken aback at the weird question, but I guess it made sense.

¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†‚ÄúUh, yeah.‚Äù I replied. The rabbit princess smiled.

¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†‚ÄúThat is good. More importantly, do you like them?‚Äù She watched me in a way that made clear that she was studying my facial expression.

¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†‚ÄúI do,‚Äù I replied. ‚ÄúAlthough I‚Äôve never used them as spoons before. We normally just eat them.‚Äù

¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†This drew a genuine smile from Alyi.

¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†‚ÄúOh, we eat them here, too. The edible spoons go nicely with this soup,‚Äù she explained, ‚Äúwhich is made of other root vegetables and herbs which keep well over the winter. If you find it acceptable, then please, try it.‚Äù She gestured encouragingly toward my bowl.

¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†The aroma was much more than merely acceptable. Sure, I needed to get home, or at least figure out what was going on, but I was starving like I hadn‚Äôt eaten in days. No need to be too hasty with free food present. I took the carrot-spoon in hand and lifted the thick liquid to my lips. It burned me at first, so I blew on it a bit before taking a sip. It was savory and earthy and tasted even better than I'd expected. I put the spoon fully in my mouth when it was cool enough‚Äìit was incredible.

¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†‚ÄúThis is incredible,‚Äù I said. I guess whoever I was, I didn't have a way with words. Alyi beamed and took up her own spoon. She stirred her soup to cool it while she spoke.

¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†‚ÄúWe understand that the customs of your world may be very different from ours. So, before our next course, I should ask whether there are any foods that you cannot or will not eat. I myself do not consume meat, for example. Do you have any such needs or preferences?‚Äù

¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†I shook my head, and in my periphery I saw Savesh lean through the doorway to say something inaudible, followed by the sound of departing footsteps.

¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†‚ÄúThat is well!‚Äù Alyi proclaimed, bringing my attention back. ‚ÄúYou can sample our cuisine freely, then.‚Äù She took a spoonful of root soup, and I followed. God, it was good. It was some kind of puree of root vegetables, like the princess had said, with a texture something like potato leek soup. I tasted garlic and ginger, I thought, and the rest didn‚Äôt matter. It was great. I tried to pace myself.

¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†‚ÄúSo,‚Äù she continued as I took another spoonful, ‚ÄúI am sure that you are disoriented, so firstly I feel that you are owed something in the way of a more complete explanation.‚Äù

¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†She paused, then, assessing me once more. I paused too, awkwardly, unsure if she was waiting for me to agree or whatever. Thankfully she continued.

¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†‚ÄúYou are in the land of Eleis, in a city called Khorus‚Äìour capital. My house, the Yai, is in possession of a major arcanum given to us by the favor of the Great Rabbits. It is this arcanum which has brought you to our world. The Rabbits are exceedingly wise, and it is no accident that they have brought you to us. Please understand, you are not our prisoner, and we will not force you to remain here. If it is your wish, we will send you back at the earliest opportunity, and we ask only that during the time you spend with us, in exchange for our hospitality, you tell us of your world and its ways.‚Äù

¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†She stopped then, and it was her turn to look a bit awkward. After a beat, she picked up her carrot again and sipped some soup. I blinked and decided to take another heavenly spoonful myself while I gathered my thoughts. I decided to just be honest.

¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†‚ÄúSo,‚Äù I began, ‚ÄúI really appreciate the meal. But, I, ah‚Ä¶ I have a job and I need to get back or I will lose it, and then I‚Äôll be in even more serious trouble without a job. When can I go back?‚Äù

¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†Alyi‚Äôs eyes widened a little and her ears fell back. Damn. I had disappointed her. Then I snapped out of it. I hadn‚Äôt chosen, or consented, to any of this. Who was she to be disappointed? I needed to pay rent, probably. I realized I didn‚Äôt know for sure, but I had a strong feeling. At length, she replied.

¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†‚ÄúThe ritual which brought you here allows you to return at the same time next month,‚Äù she said.

¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†It was my turn to look disappointed. Well, I probably looked scared, if I‚Äôm being honest. A month was a long time! Even without remembering what my job was, I was pretty sure it wouldn‚Äôt wait for me. I put my spoon down.

¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†‚ÄúA whole month?‚Äù I blurted, with a little too much emphasis on ‚Äúmonth.‚Äù My mind raced. Maybe I could come up with some excuse for vanishing, if I really had a whole month to think about it, but that was a stretch. Plus, my mind kept going blank when I tried to think of specific reasons. I couldn‚Äôt remember any family who might be sick or dying or whatever else might work as an excuse. Seconds ticked by painfully as Alyi‚Äôs eyes bored uncomfortably into mine. Goddamnit.

¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†‚ÄúIs there any faster way?‚Äù I ventured.

¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†Alyi shook her head, ears bobbing a bit from side to side with the motion.

¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†‚ÄúI am afraid not. The timing of the ritual must be very precise.‚Äù

¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†We held eye contact a little longer, with her assessing me while I probably just looked bewildered. After an excruciating moment, I said ‚ÄúOkay.‚Äù I picked up my spoon again and brought more soup to my lips. It was still delicious, but the heat had started to fade. Alyi‚Äôs ears rose up straight again.

¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†‚ÄúI understand that these circumstances were neither your choice nor your expectation. I admit that I do not understand the impact that our summoning may have had on your life back home. Please try to understand, however, that I am not completely free in this regard either, Sang. I have done what I have done, I have brought you here, for the benefit of my people, and my realm, and my House. I am truly sorry for whatever our actions may have cost you, and I give my word that you shall be returned as soon as possible‚Äì no sooner than one month from your arrival earlier this morning.""

¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†Her tone had become serious and formal again. Her ears were upright and very still. I had the sense that I had offended her. She continued.

¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†‚ÄúTherefore, please, as I have said, we would like to know of your world, and whatever you may remember of yourself. And of course, if you have any questions, please ask.‚Äù

¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†I couldn‚Äôt help but have more soup while I considered what she had just told me. She followed suit, her eyes now down, ears rigid. Alright. I had offended some rabbit princess, and I would almost certainly lose my mystery job before getting sent back to‚Äìwhat? My own world?--one month from now. I started to really hope that I was dreaming after all.

¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs with the rabbit ears?‚Äù I asked. Maybe if I pulled at the loose threads of this fantasy it would unravel.

¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†Her left ear, to my right, seemed to collapse, folding behind the other. Her eyes went wide, then her disappointment was replaced by curiosity.

¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†‚ÄúHow did you know they are rabbit ears if you don't know of unu?‚Äù

¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†‚ÄúUm, well I know what rabbits are.‚Äù

¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†Alyi nodded, thoughtfully.

¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†‚ÄúSo, then, are the Rabbits also revered where you come from?‚Äù

¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†‚ÄúExcuse me?‚Äù

¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†Her brow furrowed again.

¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†‚ÄúHow do you know what rabbits are?‚Äù

¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†I shifted uncomfortably on my furs. She sounded serious, even though her questions were ridiculous. I fought down some nervous laughter, and she leaned subtly towards me, ears swiveled forward attentively, awaiting my reply.

¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†‚ÄúWell, I‚Äì‚Äù I paused, straining to remember any experience that I‚Äôd had with rabbits, and came up with nothing. I shook my head and suppressed the anxiety caused by my missing memory. I still knew what freaking rabbits were, anyway, so memory didn't matter.

¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†‚ÄúEveryone knows about rabbits. They're around, you know? In‚Ä¶ in the spring. They eat people's gardens. Sometimes they're pets.‚Äù

¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†It also occurred to me that people sometimes ate rabbits, and I somehow knew that you couldn't survive off of rabbit meat alone. I said none of this, obviously, to the rabbit lady. Her expression had gone from intrigue to something bordering alarm as I spoke.

¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†‚ÄúPets?‚Äù she said, eyes wide with incredulity. ‚ÄúRabbits are not pets here. We are closer to being their pets!‚Äù she laughed¬† nervously. I joined her. It was insane, of course, people being rabbits‚Äô pets. Maybe this wasn't a dream, but a hallucination. I started wondering if I'd been drugged, and ‚ÄúWhite Rabbit‚Äù started playing in my brain. It would make sense‚ÄìI couldn't pinch myself out of a hallucination, I didn't think. Alyi cut my reality check short.

¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†‚ÄúSo, you don't know about the Great Rabbits, or unu, and your people keep rabbits as‚Ä¶ pets. Are you sure they don't grace you with their presence willingly in return for your garden offerings?‚Äù

¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†She was sincere.

¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†‚ÄúLook,‚Äù I began, then hesitated. Would this offend her? I hoped not but I wasn't sure how to avoid just telling her the truth. ‚ÄúI don't know what you're talking about with grace and offerings and Great Rabbits. Nobody revered rabbits. Or, well, probably some people do but it's not, like, a widespread thing in my world. They're just animals.‚Äù

¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†Alyi's ears seemed to wilt. ‚ÄúJust animals?‚Äù

¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†She leaned back from the table. Something about what I had said seemed indigestible to her mind. I could almost hear the gears trying to turn in her head. At least I wasn't the only one confused anymore.

¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†‚ÄúYeah, of course. Like squirrels, but different. Shorter tails, longer ears‚Ä¶ They burrow and hop.‚Äù I felt stupid for explaining what rabbits were, given my company. She thought a while longer, nibbling the handle of her spoon.

¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†‚ÄúIn this world,‚Äù she explained, ‚ÄúRabbits are powerful spirit beings. They are rare in the extreme, sent by the Great Rabbits as messengers and omens. On rare occasions they intercede and work the Great Rabbits‚Äô will. Wars have been decided by their favor.‚Äù

¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†Well, that was extremely intense. Luckily I had a moment to process, because the waiter people came back with copper trays laden with our breakfast. There were flaky pastries filled with some kind of shredded, spiced meat, fried eggs wrapped around spears of some kind of fire-roasted root vegetable, something that looked like oatmeal with unfamiliar pea-sized purple berries, home fries served rather inhumanely without ketchup, and steaming cups of something hot and fragrant that wasn't coffee, with little sprigs of pine needles sticking out of the liquid. The servants left two little copper tongs for utensils before retreating. A small glass jar of honey was present, which the princess used to sweeten her drink, stirring it in with the pine. I copied her. The not-coffee was weird but not bad.

¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†‚ÄúOkay, so rabbits are powerful spirits. What are unu?‚Äù Alyi‚Äôs ears twitched a bit, and she started serving herself from the trays using her little tongs as she replied.

¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†‚ÄúUnu are those people touched by the power of the Rabbits before birth. The Rabbits are pleased by our fruitfulness, and support it when those who are in their favor require. In exchange for our lives, we revere our benefactors, living according to their wisdom.‚Äù

¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†Okay. I had finished my soup and took a bite out of my spoon, crunching away while I served myself as Alyi had, except I wanted to try one of the pastries and she had taken none. She continued.

¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†‚ÄúOf course, we bear some resemblance to the sacred creatures, because of their role in our birth. But we are merely human, as much as anyone.‚Äù She popped a potato in her mouth and chewed.

¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†‚ÄúAlright. Next‚Ä¶ um. You said I wouldn't be able to remember some things, and I am starting to understand what you meant. Is that going to wear off? Or‚Ä¶ what can I do to fix that?‚Äù

¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†Alyi bowed her head and her ears came forward while she finished chewing. When her head rose she look at me intently.

¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†‚ÄúAs I have said, I must ask your forgiveness for the state of your memory. It is said that the Rabbits do this in order to be gentle with you‚Äìto ease your transition here.‚Äù She studied my reaction but to be honest I didn't even know what to think about that. I guessed I couldn't be too upset about what I didn't remember, but I wasn't sure how much difference it really made, practically speaking. I would rather remember. I didn't trust magic rabbit wisdom like Alyi apparently did.

¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†‚ÄúYour memory may come back to you over time, but it is a mysterious thing. We do not know of a way to speed the process, Sang. I am sorry.‚Äù

¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†I found myself nodding. Sure. Why not. If I had to wait a month before I could get out of this mess, why freak out the entire time. Maybe forgetting did help soften the blow a little. Sure, I was worried about being fired and losing my home, but if I had a family I'm sure it would have been much worse. Then a rush of adrenaline changed my mind. Did I have a family? Did they need me? I felt disoriented, psychologically queasy. Who had I left behind? I stood up suddenly.

¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†‚ÄúWhat about my family?‚Äù I demanded. My voice was rougher than I expected. ‚ÄúWhat about my friends?‚Äù

¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†I couldn't place the emotions within me. Anger and terror had sprouted from the disorganized soil of confusion, but I didn't even know if they were justified. For all I knew, I was a total loner. I felt embarrassed. Alyi regarded me with a calm poise, just waiting for me to either settle down or, I guessed, flip out more and make the guards necessary. Fuck. I chose the first option and sat down.

¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†‚ÄúI'm sorry, Princess,‚Äù I said once I'd gotten my emotions in hand again. ‚ÄúI'm confused and exhausted. I don't mean to offend you. Thank you for the meal.‚Äù

¬†¬†¬†She watched me for a tense moment, then said ‚ÄúOf course,‚Äù and picked up an egg¬† morsel with her tongs. ‚ÄúAs I said, I understand this must be distressing for you.‚Äù She bit into the morsel. I got the impression she was also trying to keep her composure.

¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†‚ÄúCan you at least tell me why I was brought here? And why me?‚Äù I asked.

¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†She washed the bite down with a bit of the weird tea.

¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†‚ÄúAs I said, you were summoned here by the power of the Rabbits, and the will of my House. Our House, now. Our world is a troubled one, and our land must ensure the security of our people and our ways. Eleis is not the only nation, nor is it, frankly, the most powerful. We must use every advantage available to us, and knowledge is power. Your knowledge, whatever it might be, is unique. You may know things we do not, or have perspectives which may aid us, even if we do not immediately understand one another.‚Äù

¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†I found myself nodding along after a bit. Sure, it was all very reasonable. As far as I could tell I was the only person around with a cell phone. Maybe I could help with technology or something. Spread the joy of notifications and ads to a whole new world before ditching it, like a real hero. I popped a potato in my mouth and chewed, considering. No, something didn't seem right. I didn't even know who I was, or what I did. And I wasn't exactly brimming with ideas. So it all made more sense when, at the end of all the reasonable reasons she gave, Alyi paused and looked almost‚Ä¶ vulnerable. Her left ear leaned behind her right again.

¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†‚ÄúFinally,‚Äù she concluded, ‚ÄúI must first marry in order to ascend the throne of Eleis, and for that, the Rabbits‚Äìin their wisdom‚Äìhave brought you to me.‚Äù

I married a man who I‚Äôve been with for 3 years. I made a lot of life sacrifices prior to the wedding and a lot of personal sacrifices for my actual wedding day. 
I quit my jobs, moved cities, had to give my cat to live with my mum, didn‚Äôt get the wedding ceremony I wanted, all to make my now husband happy. At the time (before the wedding) I thought it would be appreciated, maybe even returned and it could be temporary. Fast forward today and I just feel completely and utterly broken and lost.

All my husband seems to care about is his work. I have to book time in the calendar so that he will spend time with me (I get once per week). The time we do spend together we just fight. Likely because we don‚Äôt connect between those ‚Äòdates‚Äô and everything builds up. When we argue he verbally insults and abuses me calling me names, telling me I‚Äôm lazy and I do nothing. He regularly tells me how much harder his job is and how much more stressful his is compared to mine. Basically belittling me. He says he likes when I‚Äôm working until 11.30pm because I‚Äôm working and has told me I should pick up work on Saturday and Sunday too. For context I work in Higher Education with a heavy responsibility and a lot of pressure and stress. 

He is constantly putting me down. And all I do is try to lift him up. He friend to me for advice but then uses it against me. He earns approximately x4 my income and says I should pay 50% for everything. My argument is that I would have never have lived where I live now with him on my own because I could never afford it. I‚Äôm forced into this lifestyle because of him and I don‚Äôt have spare change at the end of the month because of it. 

Today we had planned to scope out a new are to live. We woke up. He started some of the chores he hadn‚Äôt completed (I had done all mine) and I asked if he wanted a coffee making. He got angry about something I hadn‚Äôt done. The verbal abuse came. I retaliated by closing his laptop screen, he launched himself at me and grabbed me. I fought back to defend myself and he bruised and marked my arm. He continued to verbally abuse me. Later today, I asked for an apology and to get on with the day. He apologised but then called me the same insulting things. We headed out of town and went for food. He told me to pay out of the money I had earned from selling some household items that he was going to throw away. I said no as the money was to go back into the house. He told me I should pay. Out of pettiness I said I will pay half. He replied ‚Äúyou‚Äôll soon realise how much everything costs.‚Äù He delusional enough to think he pays for and does everything when he definitely doesn‚Äôt. 

I believe we both have undiagnosed ADHD. Both come from very different backgrounds, where I was allowed to be free and explore growing up, witnessed a messy divorce, started working at 14 and paid for everything myself from then on. Moved away from home at 17 and have lived abroad alone. He on the other hand is from an Asian background, strict parents, forced into academia, his mum did everything for him and his dad was in and out of his life, witnessing a toxic parental relationship. Now I feel I have taken the role of his mum: emotional support, career advice, caregiver, cleaner, chef, servant. But he says I do ‚Äúnothing‚Äù. 

On top of this I‚Äôm being pressured into giving him money from our wedding. I told him the amount I could afford to pay. That‚Äôs what I paid (I think I actually paid more) but he is insistent that I owe him money. He is pressuring me to sell my car to give him money from our wedding. You can imagine how I‚Äôm starting to feel like I can‚Äôt have anything of my own.

I‚Äôm emotionally exhausted. I‚Äôve never felt so lonely. I don‚Äôt have friends as I‚Äôm new here and I can‚Äôt go home to family as my family situation is difficult. I just feel like I have no one and I don‚Äôt want to be with this person. I deserve so much more than this.

I‚Äôve been in abusive relationships and I‚Äôve endured a lot of hardships in my life. I‚Äôm emotionally connected and I know this isn‚Äôt right but no matter what I say I can‚Äôt communicate with him as he thinks he is right about everything. He calls me names, doesn‚Äôt apologise and then gives me silent treatment.

I‚Äôm lost. Do I give up on the marriage 2 months in or is there a way I can make this work? I‚Äôm feeling more and more disconnected from him by the day and I feel like my heart is breaking. Please be nice in your responses. I‚Äôm feeling extremely fragile right now. ",1,1756575978.0,relationship_advice,2,1.0,False

With its sleek black thermal design, a 10-cup capacity, and programmable features, it seemed built for people like me, who can‚Äôt start the day without coffee. Let me dive into the specifics and share my experience.

**Design and Build Quality**  

The first thing I noticed about this coffee maker was its compact, thoughtful design. It fits snugly on my countertop without hogging precious space. Made with a durable black thermal exterior, the machine has a modern look that blends well with any kitchen decor. The thermal carafe is particularly robust, with an ergonomic handle and a knuckle guard. My favorite part is the drip-free spout‚Äîit actually delivers fuss-free serving, sparing me the usual spills that come with pouring coffee.  

While it looks sturdy, the unit isn't bulky. The dimensions (7.97""D x 8.13""W x 14.25""H) make it surprisingly slim, and at 8 pounds, it‚Äôs easy to relocate if needed.  

**Performance and Programmability**  

Performance-wise, this coffee maker has me impressed. The fully automatic programmable mechanism is genuinely designed for convenience. It allows me to set brew times 24 hours ahead, which is a lifesaver for hectic mornings. The ""Brew Pause"" feature? Pure genius. Whenever I‚Äôm impatient (which is often), I can quickly pour myself a cup midway through the brewing process without making a mess.  

Another thoughtful addition is the 60-second reset function. There were moments when I pulled the plug unintentionally (thanks to my perpetually curious toddler). Still, the machine ‚Äúremembered‚Äù my previous settings and resumed brewing exactly where it left off. It felt like coffee magic.

**How It Handles Taste**  

The quality of coffee brewed by this machine is genuinely outstanding. Thanks to its dual filters‚Äîa gold tone commercial style permanent filter and a charcoal water filter‚Äîthe coffee has a crisp, clean flavor every time. I also noticed that impurities from tap water were adequately addressed, resulting in a smoother taste.  

This coffee maker works excellently with ground coffee. I tried a variety of roasts, from light breakfast blends to bold espressos, and every cup came out hot and flavorful. The 1-to-4 cup setting ensures I get consistent results even when I‚Äôm just brewing a smaller batch for myself.

**Key Benefits**  

- A thermal carafe keeps coffee hot for hours, so no reheating‚Äîblessing for slow coffee drinkers.  
- Brew Pause feature for mid-cycle coffee cravings.  
- Fully programmable up to 24 hours in advance.  
- Easy-to-read LCD clock for added convenience.  

**Drawbacks**  

- The black thermal exterior, though sleek, seems to smudge easily, requiring regular wiping.  
- A bit of trial-and-error is necessary to find the perfect grind size and coffee amount for consistent brewing.  
- While the carafe keeps coffee hot, the lid sometimes feels overly tight to unscrew.

**Peer Products**  

When comparing this coffee maker to others in its range, names like the Ninja CE251 and Hamilton Beach FlexBrew come to mind. The Ninja CE251 offers a glass carafe but lacks the thermal insulation that Cuisinart provides. On the other hand, Hamilton Beach‚Äôs dual brewing system is versatile, but its build quality isn‚Äôt as premium, and brewing time feels slower. What sets the Cuisinart apart is the fine balance between ease of use, durability, and programmability. Its thermal carafe is a standout feature that both competitors lack.  

**Cost-Effectiveness**  

This is a coffee maker that feels worth the price, considering what it brings to the table‚Äîliterally! It‚Äôs a significant upgrade from no-name drip coffee machines, with perks like better filtration, a durable thermal carafe, and advanced programmability. While it isn‚Äôt as cheap as entry-level coffee makers, what I appreciate is that it provides great value over time. It saves me from spending on disposable filters and keeps my daily coffee taste consistent‚Äîalmost like stepping into my kitchen cafe.

1n47ptu,https://www.reddit.com/r/AutismInWomen/comments/1n47ptu/i_need_help_feeling_myself_again_after_a/,I need help feeling myself again after a devastating friendship breakup,"Hello everyone ! I am 22 years old and I just went through the hardest most painful friendship breakup in my entire life. 

To summarize the entire situation as it‚Äôs an extremely layered complicated story, basically an elderly relative of my special interest person   got close to me in a friendship , at the time I was 19 years old and I was going through a really difficult time in my life , for a while he was my only and closest friend that I could  share all my interests with and things advanced to intimate topics and pictures  , it started gradually he was married which I completely own my own fault on this , the pressure the secrecy and the self loathing ended on me having a breakdown telling a therapist and our friendship breaking after that as he sent me hospitalized pictures  of himself telling me I was the cause for his health issue as I had told someone what happened , if we put this aside the time he was my friend he was truly the most amazing friend I‚Äôve ever had , it‚Äôs like I can‚Äôt process my friend is the same person. I know the best was to be away from each other and to no contact but a huge chunk of myself went away with him. 

I am on therapy and we have been working in rebuilding my identity and my goals , I quit my old job and decided to start working on my own business between school semesters , I went back to wanting to do art and I been seeking refuge on my artistry and my core and the core of who I am. This person used to have a specific persona he used to refer to me and I think I lost my sense of self for a while which I been regaining recently. I am loving re watching films of when I was little and recovering my joy  from my special interest person who would have never approved what happened. 

I feel happy with my progress but some days are still very painful , I can‚Äôt listen to the songs we used to listen or I would listen to remember him some perfumes trigger the memories of when we used to be close ; I feel a little isolated as quitting my own job limited my chance to socialize with my old co workers but I don‚Äôt have the enthusiasm to try and form a friendship from scratch again. I don‚Äôt have any fellow girl friends  in my town that I can invite to drink some coffee or talk about Taylor swift , most of my close friends irl live in my old state and my online friends are not near me. 

I enjoy being alone trying to find myself again and find a voice with my art but deep down I truly miss our morning calls and our inside jokes , when nothing bad was happening it was all so beautiful and it felt like my special interest person rest in peace was close to me in the company of this person. Sometimes I feel ok and then I get overwhelming wanting to cry , I push myself to draw and try to be happy through it all but sometimes is too hard. 
I‚Äôve been regressing to my childhood a lot lately and my special interest person media to comfort myself. 

Does anyone has a good advice that I can use in this situation ? My autism makes me seek comfort in certain topics and ruminate in others , I have no one to share all the things I used to share with him and I suck at reading people so I also feel played and guilty at the same time.

We love each other dearly but have had some speed bumps along the way as any relationship does, especially postpartum. I guess I‚Äôm looking for some advice for people who have been in our shoes as a young couple post baby on how to handle our arguments. Recently i have been wanting some extra alone time as in dates or movie dates, even coffee dates but my fiance is always tired from work (I am a stay at home mom). This past weekend my mother was visiting and I suggested we go out for a drink or dinner and he told me he was tired. I was disappointed but understood, however when letting him know I was sad we didn‚Äôt get to have alone time, he told me I need to think of him more because he‚Äôs tired and can‚Äôt put himself last. I understand this, I put myself last a bunch being a mom, especially stay at home.. I don‚Äôt get to go pee by myself most days. After he told me this however, I began tearing up and then suddenly started crying (quietly, not the big grand heaving cry) and he said nothing and just left the room. Typically he is not affectionate because growing up his family was not this way (very macho cry it out types). However with us talking about getting married and setting a date, I‚Äôm scared of settling down with someone who may never console me when I cry. Is this normal? How do I approach this? Does anyone have advice on how to handle this besides couples therapy until I can get us an appointment he‚Äôll agree to go to? I just need some advice as I‚Äôm feeling disheartened lately but would love to make this work still. Tia. ",1,1756575675.0,beyondthebump,2,1.0,False
1n47on9,https://www.reddit.com/r/indiehackers/comments/1n47on9/i_went_digging_through_eu_law_databases_found_5/,I went digging through EU law databases‚Ä¶ found 5 ‚Äúdue-law push‚Äù SaaS niches,"Hey folks,

I‚Äôve been playing around with European law databases and recent Commission releases looking for spots where regulation + deadlines force businesses to act.  
These niches aren‚Äôt the sexy AI image/video tools, but they‚Äôre quiet, legit SaaS opportunities because companies *must* comply, and they need practical tools, not audits.

Here are 5 that stood out (all with actual deadlines). Maybe you‚Äôll find some value or inspiration for what to build next:

# 1) EAA Copilot (European Accessibility Act)

* **What it does:** Scan a store‚Äôs checkout flow + PDFs, prioritize WCAG issues, suggest text fixes, and produce an **audit-ready evidence pack**.
* **Tiny user story:** *Laura runs a 6-person e-commerce team in Spain. Their agency handed her a 30-page audit. She pastes her checkout URL into the tool and gets 12 concrete fixes plus a PDF that she can show regulators.*
* **Why now:** Applies from **28 June 2025** across the EU for certain products/services (including e-commerce).
* **Law:** [Directive (EU) 2019/882 ‚Äì European Accessibility Act](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX%3A32019L0882)

# 2) EUDR-QA (EU Deforestation Regulation polygons)

* **What it does:** Upload farm polygons (CSV/KML/GeoJSON), lint them for errors, flag gaps, and export a **Due Diligence Statement pack** ready for the EU system.
* **Tiny user story:** *Jonas, a coffee roaster in Germany, uploads 1,200 plots. The tool catches 183 geometry errors, links lots to shipments, and exports a clean DDS package.*
* **Why now:** Large operators must comply from **30 Dec 2025**, SMEs from **30 Jun 2026**.
* **Law:** [Regulation (EU) 2023/1115 ‚Äì EU Deforestation Regulation](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX:32023R1115)

# 3) CATCH-Fill (IUU fishery imports)

* **What it does:** Parse and auto-populate digital **catch certificates**, reconcile vessel IDs & HS codes, pre-validate, and push into the EU‚Äôs **CATCH system**.
* **Tiny user story:** *Maria, a seafood broker in Portugal, spends 2‚Äì3 hours fixing typos per shipment. With CATCH-Fill, 90% of consignments clear on first pass.*
* **Why now:** **Mandatory use of CATCH from 10 Jan 2026** for EU importers/authorities.
* **Law:** [Regulation (EU) 2023/2842 ‚Äì Fisheries control & IUU](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX:32023R2842)

# 4) CLP-Delta (chemicals hazard labels & SDS)

* **What it does:** Ingest existing SDS + mixture data, compute **deltas for new hazard classes**, output updated EUH phrases/label blocks + redlined SDS sections.
* **Tiny user story:** *A Belgian lab uploads 100 SDS files. The tool returns updated hazard phrases and flags which sections must change before the deadline.*
* **Why now:** New hazard classes (endocrine disruptors, PBT/vPvB, PMT/vPvM) must be applied from **1 May 2025 (substances)** and **2026/2028 (mixtures)**.
* **Law:** [Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) 2023/707 ‚Äì CLP update](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX:32023R0707)

# 5) Spec‚ÜíListing (GPSR-safe product pages)

* **What it does:** Turn supplier PDFs into multilingual bullets, warnings, materials, and alt-text; includes **claim guardrails** so you don‚Äôt imply fake certifications.
* **Tiny user story:** *Elena, a 2-person Etsy brand in Italy, uploads a supplier spec. The tool generates EN/DE/FR listings with required warnings and trims risky language.*
* **Why now:** The **General Product Safety Regulation (EU) 2023/988** applies from **13 Dec 2024**; marketplaces are already tightening requirements.
* **Law:** [Regulation (EU) 2023/988 ‚Äì General Product Safety](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX:32023R0988)

# Why I‚Äôm sharing this

I‚Äôm not a lawyer, just someone who got curious and poked around **EUR-Lex + Commission releases** to spot patterns.  
These niches aren‚Äôt glamorous, but they‚Äôre **pain + deadline driven**. If you‚Äôre looking for micro-SaaS ideas, maybe one of these is worth exploring.

I feel like I just did a hard thing. While this place paradigm coffee house used to only be mine, I shared it with my ex. This week I decided to go to the two places I had been shared with him from my childhood. I was nervous it made me sad but also felt like a path to moving on. The emotions still run deep my throat gets choked up but, this is big. This is healing. I want to heal so that if we meet again it could be different or I can say I did the work I‚Äôm sorry you didn‚Äôt. It isn‚Äôt hard to work on myself, show up for myself. I‚Äôm doing it. I‚Äôm doing it. I couldn‚Äôt be more proud. 

My heart is warm the sun feels amazing. I feel light like my spark is coming back. He tried to beat it out of me. I only received one ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry‚Äù it‚Äôs not enough. He has shadowed his emotions now and until he‚Äôs fully ready to open up again there‚Äôs nothing to say. The regression is sad to see but expected. I won‚Äôt be used for fodder. I won‚Äôt be kept on the back burner for him to run back to when his other wiles have lost their glow. I know I have so much to offer and so does he that‚Äôs why he struggles to let go and be authentic with how he‚Äôs feeling. I hope he opens again but I don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôll be to me. I will have to make peace with that but that‚Äôs a hard thing for another day. When I finally sever that cord and I don‚Äôt care if he comes back or is fully gone, I‚Äôll know I healed. I‚Äôll know that while I may still have love for him it won‚Äôt control me anymore. Won‚Äôt shape me the chaos will rest for just a moment maybe. I wait for that day.

Fun colleagues. Water-cooler chats.

A ‚Äúdesktop buddy.‚Äù Someone to swap random thoughts with, curse at code, explore rabbit holes. Just create a safe space to brain dump, celebrate, vent, and the gamut of it.

Late evening. Back parking lot of a donut shop. Moody orange lighting from a nearby streetlamp. Officer Dan's squad car parked slightly crooked. A steaming donut box rests on the dashboard.

5. Characters and Detailed Actions  
Officer Dan sits in his squad car in uniform and aviators, holding a half-eaten jelly donut. Calm demeanor. Slight frosting on his upper lip. He addresses the dashcam deliberately while sipping coffee. A faint rustling noise comes from under his seat by second 5, but he doesn‚Äôt flinch.

1n47lbm,https://www.reddit.com/r/NUST/comments/1n47lbm/seniors_ki_orientation_ya_freshies_ki/,Seniors ki Orientation ya Freshies ki?,"Title catchy hay views k lye (OG's kela na khaayen)

Okay so being a senior in this SubReddit, there are some things that should be clear to the freshies joining us this year (lovely ppl imo)



As the orientation is a hot topic nowadays, let me make one thing very clear, the orientation is NOT really for you. It might look like everything is arranged for the freshmen and that the seniors are working hard for you guys, but that‚Äôs not the reality.

The main purpose of the orientation is actually for the seniors to chill and relax after a hectic year of studies. They use this time to meet up, socialize, make new friends, and do some light preparation for the juniors. But the majority of their time and energy goes into socializing, something most people don‚Äôt get to do much in their first year outside of their own batch and department.

The seniors start ‚Äúpreparing‚Äù for the orientation, and it might seem like they‚Äôre putting in a lot of effort for you. In reality, it‚Äôs just them hanging out and enjoying the whole month before orientation. The truth is, nobody really cares about any freshie, and honestly, nobody should have to either. Everyone already has their own problems to deal with. They do organize some events for you, which NUST management selects, but those events are usually more enjoyable for them than for you as they've already adjusted to the University life.

From experience, some freshies don‚Äôt feel included in these orientation activities, and that can be a big turn-off. They often start bashing the whole thing. You might also feel awkward and think, ‚ÄúWhat kind of cringe activities are these?‚Äù But trust me, when it‚Äôs your turn, you‚Äôll probably be at the front, chanting the same slogans (which, in my opinion, are still cringe).

2.

Studies kay lihaaz sy you guys will be very disappointed because I also had very high expectation when I joined for the faculty and management. You'll see that the teachers (except a few) don't differ from the useless teachers you had in your college life. You'll have to be smart for grades because that is only what works. Teachers ki egos and grudges have ruined many student's grades lol.

One semester might seem to be a long time but it actually passes very quickly. In almost a month, you guys will be assigned Mids syllabus and will already be stressing about exams. Parhai ko sabsy pehly rakho if you guys want to have a stable GPA during your degree. Otherwise regret AAPKY ilawa koi nae kryga when you see everyone with a 3+ GPA. Teachers aur lab instructors sy bana kar rakho (khud samjh jaogy kyun). Kabhi kisi professor ki buri nazr mai nae aana. Feedbacks mn kuch aisa waisa na likhdena because they can check the names (yes they can). Studies kay chakkar mai kisi group ko carry na karna. Hamesha soch samnjh kar groups banana kay what can the other members bring to the table.

3.

If you're a hostelite, you'll have way more experience of the NUST life as compared to the average day scholar. Hostel say kabhi nahi darna, it's actually a very lovely place where you'll make friends aur make memories w em. You''ll have laundry, sports kay lye courts, cafe's for chai, library for group study sessions, trail for hiking, Coffee Lounge for dates (yes). Most of you would be leaving your homes for the first time but once you go out, you'll consider your hostel room as your second home and would be dying to go back in summers as most of us did. Bechary larkon ko to hostel nae mila but girls can enjoy this facility of having excellent food in hostels and Air conditioned TV Lounge during the heat. Shuttles ka maximum use krna, make sure you guys bring an umbrella as well (for the sun)

If you have any complaint about the hostels, you need to go through the proper channels to get it resolved. Some people in the sub reddit say that the  hostel management is cruel, but honestly, it‚Äôs usually not that bad. The process is simple: first, contact your caretaker. If the issue still isn‚Äôt resolved, then go to your hostel manager. If needed, you can escalate it to the DD Hostels (Diddy Hostels) or Director Field Admin.

Complaining directly to the Rector about something like a broken fan in your room doesn‚Äôt really make sense. Following the proper process will always work better in your favour. Also you should inform the manager or the relevent authority when you make a complaint as well because they'll most likely help you (if you're lucky).

4.

Making friends in university is easy, but making true FRIENDS is very difficult. Make sure you find the right people and test them through different situations. If they stay loyal and supportive, keep them close.

People often talk about setting boundaries, but in reality, it doesn‚Äôt always work that way. You‚Äôll have to work with a lot of different people, and sometimes you might even end up being the ‚Äúbad person‚Äù in a situation. Stay humble, but not so humble that people walk all over you.

It‚Äôs better to have a few loyal friends rather than a big circle. This will help you avoid fake friendships, snakes, and the toxic group culture that exists in some universities. Also, be prepared for change, your first semester friendships most likely won‚Äôt last the whole semester. You might outgrow them, or they might outgrow you.

Don‚Äôt ever be afraid of being alone. At the end of the day, nobody will be there to take care of you when you get sick or face a tough time. Don‚Äôt become overly dependent on people. Your go-to support system should always be your parents, not anyone else.

5.

ALSO DON'T FORGET NUST KI BILLIYAN  
They've been here longer than us and deserve more love and care than we realize. Last year some females made some complaints about girls feeding cats in the hostels upon which the hostel admin introduced fines. Please don't be like this and have some speck of humanity in you.

Final Note:

University life is a big transition, especially for those who'll be living far from home in hostels, and it‚Äôs going to feel overwhelming at times. You‚Äôll hear a lot of advice, see a lot of hype, and experience things you didn‚Äôt expect. Take everything with a grain of salt and focus on what truly matters, your academics, your personal growth, and your well-being.

Enjoy the good moments, but don‚Äôt lose yourself trying to fit in. Kisi k lye don't degrade yourself or lower your standards. Make friends, but choose wisely. Take responsibility for yourself, whether it‚Äôs in your hostel or in your studies. And most importantly, don‚Äôt compare your journey with anyone else‚Äôs. Everyone has their own struggles, even if they don‚Äôt show it.

Your first year will pass faster than you think, so make it count in ways that benefit your future, not just the present. Good luck, and welcome to the ride!",13,1756575385.0,NUST,1,1.0,False
1n47ji4,https://www.reddit.com/r/HealthMomentum/comments/1n47ji4/does_rocco_roxie_carpet_cleaner_truly_deliver/,Does Rocco & Roxie Carpet Cleaner Truly Deliver Superior Stain Removal? Review Here,"The Rocco & Roxie 850010626406 Carpet Cleaner Solution for Pets is something I‚Äôve put to the test personally, and I‚Äôve got to say, it‚Äôs packed with features that immediately caught my attention. Let‚Äôs dive into everything I‚Äôve discovered about this carpet cleaner solution in the most honest and straightforward review you're going to get. Spoiler alert: It‚Äôs great‚Äîbut not perfect.

**Design and Packaging**  
Starting with its packaging, the bottle is well-designed and convenient to use. The cap doubles as a simple measuring tool, so there‚Äôs no overuse or waste, which I appreciated since I tend to get a bit overzealous with cleaning products. The instructions printed on the bottle are clear and concise, leaving no room for confusion‚Äîa huge win for people like me, who often wing it and then regret it later. 

**Professional Cleaning Performance**  
Here‚Äôs where things get real. With a mess-prone dog and, admittedly, a tendency to accidentally spill everything from coffee to sauces, my carpets have seen better days. The professional-strength formula did an amazing job of tackling my dog‚Äôs unfortunate contribution to the rug and even a dried red wine spot that had been haunting me for weeks. The active oxygen molecules mentioned? They‚Äôre no joke. I could literally see the stains lifting out like magic, almost as if the carpet was sighing in relief.  

**Check [Rocco & Roxie 850010626406] price on Amazon.**  

**Upsides**  
- The powerful formula works impressively even on deeply set stains.  
- Safe to use around children and pets when used as directed.  
- Approved by the Carpet and Rug Institute, so it feels trustworthy.  
- Doesn't leave any weird soapy residue, thanks to its encapsulation technology.  

**Ease of Use in Carpet Cleaning Machines**  
A major selling point for me was how smoothly this product works in any carpet cleaning machine. I used it with my standard carpet shampooer, and the results were solid. One of my coworkers even mentioned how well it worked on her car interiors, tackling mud prints and sticky juice spills from her kids like a champ. It's versatile enough to handle assorted surfaces like area rugs, upholstery, and couch fabrics‚Äîbasically, wherever disasters happen.

**Gentle and Safe Formula**  
It's comforting to know that this product is chlorine-free and color-safe. My biggest worry was whether it would fade the fabric of my rather expensive area rug, but that didn‚Äôt happen, thankfully. No odd bleach stains or strange carpet discoloration in sight. Also, knowing it‚Äôs safe around my golden retriever, Max, was a relief. It‚Äôs been certified gentle enough for all carpet types, making it perfect for family homes buzzing with kids and pets.

**Disadvantages**  
- It‚Äôs definitely not cheap compared to generic brands.  
- Works best with fresh stains‚Äîolder stains might require a couple of passes.  
- The strong odor during application might bother some noses, though it‚Äôs not unbearable.  

**Other Options**  
When I looked into similar products, brands like Bissell and Hoover have alternatives. While those are good too, the encapsulation technology in this one really gives it an edge. Products from other competitors sometimes leave behind residue, causing carpets to attract more dirt over time. Rocco & Roxie's solution ensures your carpets stay cleaner for longer by eliminating that issue. However, the other substitutes might be better suited for someone on a tight budget, with fewer stains to deal with regularly.  

**Cost Efficiency**  
Although it doesn‚Äôt fall into the ‚Äúbudget-friendly‚Äù niche, the value for this product‚Äôs features makes you appreciate the cost. Spending money on something that actually tackles every annoying stain in a way generic brands couldn‚Äôt feels logical. I compared prices with competitors, and while this is slightly more expensive, its safety certifications and consistent cleaning performance justified the investment for me.

Even before I am fully awake, I know that this is going to be a day from hell and I have had enough of those in my life.

If just one more thing in my life goes wrong, I am out of here and I will never set foot in this territory again.

‚ÄúDid the bond form?‚Äù I ask Charna, my Lycan. If it did, it would make my day better, or at least I hope so.

‚ÄúIt did form.‚Äù She replies, but her tone tells me something is wrong.

I turned eighteen a week ago and found a connection with the future Alpha, Nico, one of the people on my list for hurting me over and over again.

No, he never hit me and neither did anyone else.

Okay, maybe I need to explain something for you to understand what I am talking about.

On my sixth birthday I had been at the lake with my Father, who is our Pack‚Äôs Beta, and the Alpha and Gamma family. I had gotten bored with the games they were playing, and I had wandered off into the forest; most of our territory is forest.

I knew to keep an eye out for the markings that tell us where our borders are and I had been picking wild flowers as I walked around. A soft whimper had gotten my attention and being the curious little Beta, I had gone looking for the source.

If only I had known that I would come to hate my sixth birthday one day, I might have walked in the opposite direction.

I had found a girl in the forest. Later, it turned out that she was just a little older than me, and I had taken her to our Alpha.

Her name was Lucy, but she couldn‚Äôt tell us how she had gotten here or where she had come from. She did know that her birthday had just been a few days ago or would be in a few days, and that had been the first time that she had gotten something that was mine.

‚ÄúYou have so many dolls, why don‚Äôt you give one to Lucy?‚Äù my Father had asked and as I had thought about which doll to gift her, I had nodded my head.

My Father had grabbed my favorite doll from the picnic blanket and as I had objected to it, my Father had already given it to Lucy.

I had tried to explain to my Father that I didn‚Äôt want to part with that specific doll, but he had just said that I was being selfish, and he had placed Lucy next to him on the blanket.

Lucy had lived on the first floor with the Omegas for about a week, when my Father had moved Lucy to our floor. He had said that Lucy didn‚Äôt like living with the Omegas, and she had asked my Father if she could come live with us.

I doubt nowadays that she used the word ‚Äúus‚Äù back then, but I wasn‚Äôt there when she had asked and therefore I can‚Äôt be sure.

Every birthday I had was overshadowed by Lucy, my Father always telling me that she didn‚Äôt have parents to throw her a party and I could just share my party with Lucy.

This happened again and again, not only due to my Father but also due to the Alpha and Gamma families. Nico was the worst, and he would always remind me that Lucy was much prettier than me, at least in his eyes.

So, now you might understand why Nico is on my shit list.

I train every single day because I have to because I am the future Beta. Well, I was the future Beta, and now I am going to be the future Luna.

Nico had been as surprised as I was, but he wanted to form a bond with me. After all, the Goddess had made the connection, and we needed to respect her decision.

Lucy hadn‚Äôt been too happy with it; she had been trying to get Nico‚Äôs attention for almost a year now and had failed miserably. She even went out of her way to make sure I knew that she would never accept me as a Luna and I had just laughed in her face.

Being Nico‚Äôs Mate will make me the Luna, and Lucy cannot do anything about it, even though she might try.

I have gone through my morning routine and am rinsing the dishes I used for breakfast. I hardly ever eat breakfast in the main dining room, because I usually train during that time.

I see that the door to the master bedroom is wide open, which means that my Father is already downstairs, probably having an early morning meeting with the rest of our leadership.

‚ÄúWhy are you so quiet?‚Äù I ask Charna, this should be a joyous day for both of us.

She doesn‚Äôt answer me, but the moment I leave the Beta floor, she starts pacing in my head and forces me to head up to the Alpha floor. I enter the floor using the code I was given after I turned sixteen, and I am met with complete silence.

It seems I was right about the early morning meeting, and Nico is using it to sleep in, just like he does every time his parents are preoccupied or absent.

I hadn‚Äôt made any plans with Nico, even though we knew that today would probably be the day that our Mate-bond would be completed. Charna doesn‚Äôt understand why we didn‚Äôt make any plans, and to tell you the truth, neither do I.

My steps falter as I stand in front of Nico‚Äôs bedroom door and I am glad that our bond hadn‚Äôt formed earlier. If it had and we had accepted one another as Mates, I would be in excruciating pain right now.

Because the Asshole is fucking another female, the sounds coming from his room don‚Äôt leave any room for errors and I am not sure what to do right now.

‚ÄúIs this why he didn‚Äôt want to tell anyone just yet?‚Äù Charna asks me and I think we both know that that is exactly the reason.

‚ÄúOhh, Lucy. That feels so good.‚Äù I hear Nico groan, but it is the name he called that has made me furious and I can barely manage to keep myself from bursting in. I need to find a way to expose those two, and slowly, I make my way out of the Alpha floor and back to my own room without shedding a tear.

I am going to make them pay for what they did and everyone will know about our connection, but it ends today.

# New Life

I walk into my bedroom and grab my suitcases from the back of my closet; I place them on my bed to start packing the remainder of my belongings. There are only a few sets of clothes left in my closet and only the daily necessities in the bathroom.

Most of the things I want to take with me are already in my suitcases. I made the decision to leave Shadow Valley Pack at my Sweet Sixteen party, and I already know where I am going.

I will be going to the Elders to learn everything I need to learn to become the best Beta I can be, and I will find a Pack that will appreciate me for who I am.

My weapons are in the trunk of my car; I take them out every time I need them and place them back after I have cleaned them. All that is left is my luggage, and then I will make sure that everyone understands who is responsible for me leaving.

Okay, let‚Äôs get introductions out of the way. My name is Dallas, I am eighteen years old and my Lycan, Charna, showed up a year ago. My life hasn‚Äôt been a bed of roses and the only reason I stayed this long is the hope of finding my Mate.

Well, we already know that that didn‚Äôt go as planned. I am officially done with the people in my life and the leadership of this Pack.

I walk back up to the Alpha floor, and to my surprise, Nico and Lucy are still at it, but I no longer give a damn.

‚ÄúNico, harder.‚Äù I hear Lucy moan. ‚ÄúPut a Pup in me, I want you to cum inside me.‚Äù I can hear Nico groan before he yells that he is coming.

I slam open the door, and Lucy drops to the floor when Nico pushes her off his cock, startled by my presence. Both make a mess of themselves and the bedroom.

I don‚Äôt wait for him to respond; I just turn on my heel and walk down the hallway to the door.

‚ÄúPlease, Dallas. Stop. This is not what it looks like; it just happened.‚Äù Nico says, hopping on one leg as he tries to pull on some sweatpants.

I don‚Äôt say anything; I just keep walking down the stairs, and I know that Nico and Lucy are right behind me.

Everyone in the main dining room goes quiet the moment they see me walking in, and I can hear a few whispers the moment Nico and Lucy walk in behind me; everyone can smell the scent of sex in the air.

‚ÄúI, Dallas, reject you, Nico, as my Mate.‚Äù I say after I have turned around to look at him.

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt care if you accept it or not. Just know that it won‚Äôt stop me from finding my own happiness and you will have to suffer the consequences of not accepting my rejection.‚Äù I state.

‚ÄúDallas, why are you rejecting our Son?‚Äù Alpha Leon asks and I turn around to look at him.

‚ÄúBecause, as usual, Lucy wanted what is mine and got it. Your Son fucked Lucy, even though he knew that our Mate-bond was nearly complete and now I know why he didn‚Äôt want us to tell anyone.‚Äù I say as I look into Alpha Leon‚Äôs eyes.

I turn back to Lucy and Nico, he is still staring at me and his hands are pressed against his chest. I don‚Äôt feel any pain, but that might change if he accepts my rejection.

‚ÄúYou wanted him; you can have him. You can have everything that was once mine. I hope that the two of you become very happy together, and I hope that you enjoy your victory.‚Äù I say to Lucy before I walk past her and out of the main dining room.

‚ÄúStop, you can‚Äôt leave. You are my Mate.‚Äù Nico says and I turn around to see him standing in the doorway.

‚ÄúI am no longer your Mate. You chose to sleep with her, and now you can deal with the consequences. You have always put Lucy before me, just like your family, the Gamma family and even my own Father. You never failed to remind me that you thought that Lucy was prettier than I am.

Our Mate-bond would have made you see that you had been wrong, that you had hurt me with your words, and I would have forgiven you because of our Mate-bond. What I can‚Äôt forgive and what I will never forgive, is that you chose to fuck another woman.‚Äù I say in a calm, cold voice.

The entire dining room is quiet and everyone is waiting for what is coming next.

‚ÄúDallas, there might be a very good explanation‚Ä¶‚Äù But I don‚Äôt give Alpha Leon the chance to finish his sentence.

‚ÄúWhat kind of explanation can your Son have for being buried balls deep in Lucy? Where in this damn universe could this have been an accident?‚Äù I growl in his direction.

More Pack-members have gathered in the dining room, all of them curious about the drama unfolding in front of them.

My Father finally gets up from his chair and I am damn curious about what he will have to say.

‚ÄúDallas, you are the future Beta. You already have status within Shadow Valley Pack; why not grant Lucy the status of Luna?‚Äù My Father says.

Charna is growling in my head, but she keeps to the back of my mind. Neither one of us wants him to know that we already shifted or that we know that he lied about our Mother.

‚ÄúHAVE YOU LOST YOUR FUCKING MIND? YOU WANT ME TO GIVE LUCY MY MATE, JUST LIKE YOU GAVE HER THE LAST GIFT MOM GAVE ME OR THE FAMILY HEIRLOOM YOU WERE SUPPOSED TO GIVE ME ON MY SIXTEENTH BIRTHDAY.

GET A FUCKING GRIP ON THAT DAMN BRAIN OF YOURS, I HATE YOUR FUCKING GUTS.‚Äù I yell at my Father and I take advantage of his shocked state.

‚ÄúNico, this is your last chance to accept my rejection. Once I walk out the door, you might never get the chance again.‚Äù I state, looking at Nico and it seems to sink in that no one can change my mind.

‚ÄúI, Nico, accept your rejection.‚Äù Nico says, knowing that I will never forgive him.

I walk out of the Pack-house without looking back; I get into my SUV to finally get out of this place and start my new life.

# At Fault

Dallas‚Äô p.o.v.

Six months later

I took my time to travel to Scarlet Crescent Pack. I needed time to myself, and I wanted to take time to write down all the questions I have had for years.

I arrived at my destination after traveling for almost a week.

Charna enjoyed running around in unknown territory and neither one of us feel sorry for ourselves.

It is almost as if there never was a bond between me and Nico, no pain after he accepted our rejection and no sense of loss for us.

I arrived at Scarlet Crescent Pack in the early morning, and I am glad that I had the letter from the Elders printed; it saved a lot of trouble at the gate.

A Squad Captain was waiting for me at the main building, the building that houses the Elders and where I will get my education.

I was given a schedule for the first week and then he showed me the territory we were staying in.

We might live within Scarlet Crescent territory, but we can‚Äôt enter the territory that surrounds the Palace. At least not with permission from the Elders or at the request of the King.

I had the rest of the day off, and I used it to get settled in; my room is on the top floor of building A. It is a hell of a lot bigger than my room back home and I even have a small balcony.

I placed my laptop on the desk next to the balcony door, I unpacked my suitcases and then I went looking for some breakfast.

My first real day with the Elders consisted of tests to establish the level of my knowledge of Laws and my skill level in fighting.

I aced every test they gave me, and that left the Elders with a challenge: where do you place someone who hardly needs basic training?

After consulting with the Squad Captains, I was assigned to one of the Squads and a costume made study plan was devised.

My studies were more focused on Pack-laws and the consequences they could have for a Pack. It was something I wasn‚Äôt taught in Shadow Valley Pack; I didn‚Äôt even know that an Alpha could make his own Laws within his territory.

Those Laws can‚Äôt be breaking our main Laws; they are usually a stricter version of our main Laws, and I was going to need to learn all of them.

I found a few surprises along the way, and I actually enjoyed my studies; they were very educational.

Today, I will become a fully pledged member of Captain Jordan‚Äôs Squad, and I will be allowed to go on missions with the Squad; my main priority is to make sure we know the Pack-laws of the territories we get sent to.

‚ÄúGood morning, Dallas.‚Äù Captain Jordan says as I walk into the living room of our Squad house.

The other Squad members greet me with a smile or a wave and I walk over to the coffee machine to make myself a Latte.

Captain Jordan slides a file in my direction after I have taken a seat not far from him, and I reluctantly open it. I know what is in there and hate it whenever he hands me a file like this.

Captain Jordan was the first one who found out about my past; he had found me cussing and swearing at a phone that was lying on the desk in my room.

It was on my third day as a part of his Squad and I hadn‚Äôt come down yet, so he came looking for me. I had finally turned on the old phone with my sim card in it and I had many text and voice messages from my Father.

None of them were an apology for the way he had treated me. No, each of them was telling me that I was childish, selfish, and immature.

Captain Jordan took the phone from me, and once a month, I get a file on the type of messages I have gotten with the name of whoever left them for me.

My Father still leaves messages telling me I am being childish, selfish and immature. Nico is begging me to come back, to give him another chance and so do his parents. The only one that hasn‚Äôt reached out to me is Lucy and I hope she never does.

My eyes widen when I read a different message from my Father, and I hear Charna laughing in my head; I had completely forgotten about this.

‚ÄúSomething funny, Dallas?‚Äù I hear Captain Jordan ask and I need a minute before I can answer him.

‚ÄúSorry, but it is the last message from my Father.‚Äù I reply and I hear a few growls around me.

‚ÄúI had forgotten that I had changed the password to the program for the Pack funds. I never informed anyone about it, and it slipped my mind that it is the annual fund meeting in a few days.‚Äù I explain, but apparently, I am not making any sense.

‚ÄúEvery Pack makes an annual budget for a variety of Pack-related issues; I have been making them since I turned fifteen, and my Father would pass them off as his own. He never needed access to the program, so he never needed the new password and now the only ones that can get access are Alpha Leon and his Mate.‚Äù I explain.

Captain Jordan has a dumbfounded look on his face and looking around; I can see he isn‚Äôt the only one.

‚ÄúCan‚Äôt your Father ask Alpha Leon for the password?‚Äù I hear Elder Jensen ask.

‚ÄúAnd tell Alpha Leon that he hasn‚Äôt done any of the financial tasks he was supposed to do?‚Äù I ask in return.

I hear almost everyone laughing around me, understanding that this would mean losing face for a Beta and no one would want to lose face in front of his Alpha.

‚ÄúBesides, my Father would never admit that he was at fault. No matter the evidence against him.‚Äù I say.

# Our Mother

Daxton‚Äôs p.o.v.

‚ÄúGood morning, Daxton.‚Äù I hear Carl, our future Alpha, say. I doubt it is a good morning if he is standing behind me, he only comes looking for me if someone told him to come and get me.

‚ÄúWho sent you?‚Äù I ask him as I turn to face him. I want to look into his eyes when he answers me; it will tell me if he is aware of why he was sent here.

‚ÄúMy Mother, I believe it has to do with an invitation from Shadow Valley Pack. Between you and me, I think Dad might order you to go.‚Äù Carl answers and I know that he is telling the truth.

I am forty-seven, and I still haven‚Äôt found my true Mate-bond; I never met a woman my Lycan felt a connection with. I have been waiting for twenty-nine years to find that connection, but so far, I haven‚Äôt been able to find her, and I gave up on finding her years ago.

The people around me are still hoping that I will find her one day; they want me to go to other Packs to look for her. I did that for over a decade with no results and now I no longer want to go through it.

‚ÄúI am sorry, Daxton. Mom wants you at the Pack-house for lunch on the Alpha floor.‚Äù Carl says, and I know that he is sorry; our entire future leadership understands me.

None of them have found their true Mate-bond yet and they have to attend as many events as the Pack gets invited to.

I reluctantly follow Carl to the Pack-house; there is no point in shooting the messenger. I am not sure how this lunch will go, but something tells me I will have given everyone a piece of my mind before it ends.

Chatter is coming from the dining room and I can already hear my Mother‚Äôs voice above the others.

‚ÄúIf he doesn‚Äôt find his Mate during that Alpha Ceremony, he will need to take Daniella as his chosen Mate.‚Äù Mom says and even though I am not in the room, I know the smirk Daniella will have on her face.

‚ÄúI will never take Daniella as my chosen Mate. If and that is a big IF I take a chosen Mate, I will decide who becomes my chosen Mate. You don‚Äôt have a say in it, Mother.‚Äù I say calmly, knowing that this annoys the hell out of her.

Not just my tone of voice but also the fact that I use the word Mother instead of Mom.

No one says a word as I sit down across the table from my Mother and Daniella; both of them have an annoyed look on their face. Carl sits down in the seat that was meant for me, next to Daniella.

‚ÄúWhat is this I hear about an invitation, Luna?‚Äù I ask, ensuring everyone understands I know why I was summoned.

‚ÄúShadow Valley Pack will get another Alpha in about seven months; we got invited to attend and to bring along some of our unmated Pack-members.‚Äù Our Luna answers and I know there is no way I am getting away with refusing to go.

‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt know that Nico had found his connection yet and why does Alpha Leon think it is smart to hand over the Pack so soon?‚Äù I ask the question that is probably running through everyone‚Äôs mind.

We had all met Nico over the years and he didn‚Äôt strike me as the most competent for the Alpha position, not to mention the woman who was always with him. If I am not mistaken, her name is Lucy, but we never found out what her rank is or who her parents are.

The last time Nico was here was about four months ago, and we all had felt that something was off that day. We never figured out what was wrong, but the guy had been jumpy throughout the entire visit and he had eyed every woman in the Pack with suspicion until he was able to see their faces.

‚ÄúNone of us knew he had found a connection until the invitation arrived, that is. As to why Alpha Leon is so eager to step down, any guess could be a good one.‚Äù Our Luna answers.

Usually, when a future Alpha finds his connection, his parents make it known to every Pack and not just the allied Packs.

For his parents not to make it known immediately can only mean a few things. He could have gotten someone pregnant who isn‚Äôt his true Mate-bond, he could have taken a chosen Mate for an alliance, or he could have broken the connection to his first Mate for whatever reason.

‚ÄúWhy don‚Äôt you accompany Daxton to the Alpha Ceremony, Daniella?‚Äù My Mother asks, but luckily our Luna quickly shoots that idea down.

‚ÄúSorry, but we have chosen the unmated Pack-members already. Daniella is still young and has all the time in the world to find her connection. We will be bringing Pack-members that have been waiting at least five years to find their connection.‚Äù Our Luna responds and I can tell that she is telling the truth.

‚ÄúWe did that on purpose, Daxton.‚Äù She tells me through the mind-link, and for once, I am grateful that our Luna can be conning from time to time.

Unlike most, our Luna isn‚Äôt afraid to talk back to my Mother. My Mother knows that most still consider her this Pack‚Äôs Beta female and that means she gets away with a lot of her behavior, but even my Mother isn‚Äôt stupid enough to go against our Luna.

Our Luna has the final say and no one is going to argue with her about it, not even me.

My Mother and Daniella don‚Äôt seem to be too pleased with our Luna, but my twin Brother, Darius, has a damn smirk on his face and hell breaks loose the moment he opens his mouth.

‚ÄúYou seem eager to have her as a Daughter in law. Why don‚Äôt I take Daniella as my chosen Mate?‚Äù Darius says with a smirk on his face.

Yeah, leave it to my twin Brother to piss off our Mother.

# Missing Something?

Darius‚Äô p.o.v.

The moment the invitation came in, I knew it would mean trouble between my Mother and my twin Brother.

And yes, I say my Mother for a reason. Daxton might be my twin Brother, but she always treated him less than me, and for the first ten years of our lives, we even believed that we were separated by a whole year.

It wasn‚Äôt until our former Alpha overheard a conversation between me and Daxton that we were told that we were twins.

It explained quite a lot of things to both of us, and Daxton has pulled away from our Mother ever since; there even was a time he refused to acknowledge that she was his Mother.

We still don‚Äôt understand why she favors me over Daxton and we both doubt that we will ever find out.

I listen to the words my Mother speaks, but I don‚Äôt respond and I don‚Äôt have to. Daxton can take care of himself, but I am starting to get agitated by Mother‚Äôs relentless quest to get Daxton to take a chosen Mate and preferably Daniella.

None of us likes Daniella; it goes back to our childhood, and she hasn‚Äôt given us a reason yet to change our minds.

Daniella is the Granddaughter of a former Elder and she was always after Preston. No matter what anyone told her, she kept going after him and we thought she might trick him into a chosen Mate-bond.

Daxton, Rayden and I would always be with Preston and we have seen Daniella try a few desperate things to get into Preston‚Äôs bed, but thank the Goddess that she never succeeded. It would have been this Pack‚Äôs downfall and one of us would have been charged with murder.

Mother stares at me when I suggest that I take Daniella as a chosen Mate; I know she doesn‚Äôt think Daniella is good enough to be a Beta‚Äôs Mate, and she will object to my suggestion.

‚ÄúDarius, that is ridiculous. Daniella is not cut out to be a Beta‚Äôs Mate; she would never be able to support you the way you need your Mate to support you.‚Äù Mother replies and I see a devilish look in Rayden‚Äôs eyes.

‚ÄúThen she isn‚Äôt suited to be Daxton‚Äôs Mate either; after all, they are twins, and that makes Daxton also a Beta.‚Äù Rayden states and normally I would say that no one can argue with that, but I know how my Mother feels about Daxton and Beta in the same sentence.

‚ÄúDarius is Silver Eclipse‚Äôs Beta; Daxton holds no title. Daniella can be his chosen Mate, but not that of my little boy.‚Äù My Mother growls and I know Rayden is going to spill the beans.

‚ÄúWhat do you mean with Daxton holds no title? I thought that twins always shared everything, their Mate and their rank.‚Äù Ruth, Rayden‚Äôs Mate, asks.

‚ÄúNice safe, Rayden.‚Äù I hear Preston say over our mind-link.

I would like to hear how my Mother is going to get herself out of this pickle; either she acknowledges that Daxton is also a Beta, or she has to tell a lie.

Daniella has had a disgusted look on her face since Ruth mentioned that twins share a Mate, it seems like she hadn‚Äôt taken that into consideration.

‚ÄúYou are right, Ruth. A twin usually shares a Mate and a rank, but Daxton made a mess of his life at the age of twenty. It is a shameful period and I don‚Äôt like to get reminded of it. I told Preston that Daxton‚Äôs status had been damaged and that only Darius had a right to the Beta of Silver Eclipse Pack.‚Äù My Mother answers Ruth.

Ruth looks at Daxton for a very long time and I know that he is getting uncomfortable by the way she is looking at him.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry for staring, Daxton. I am just trying to see the monster because only a monster wouldn‚Äôt deserve his rank or a true Mate-bond. I will let you know when I have found that monster, even though I have a feeling that I am looking in the wrong direction.‚Äù Ruth says.

Daxton is trying to hide his laughter, but I am not even trying. Ruth knows what to say and when to say it; she always manages to lighten up a tense situation.

‚ÄúRuth, I don‚Äôt like what you are implying‚Ä¶..‚Äù My Mother starts to say, but Ruth just raises her hand to shut her up.

‚ÄúI am not implying anything. It is just a result of the information that you gave me; the only thing I could come up with is that whatever Daxton did must have painted him as a monster and nothing less. I can‚Äôt see that monster in him and I doubt his Mate will.‚Äù Ruth replies and I see Daxton shaking with laughter.

Our Mother isn‚Äôt used to someone interrupting her or telling her how they feel about her, and Ruth doesn‚Äôt have a problem doing both.

‚ÄúDaxton will never find his connection after all these years; it is time he accepts the fact that he will never have a true Mate-bond.‚Äù My Mother says and I have to grit my teeth to keep quiet.

‚ÄúOkay, let‚Äôs see if I can get this straight. You believe that Daxton will never find his Mate, but that also means that Darius will never find his Mate. Because Daxton will never find his Mate, you want him to take a chosen Mate and that means that Darius needs to find a chosen Mate too.

They are twins, and that means sharing a Mate; maybe Daniella is willing to take two Mates. Oh, hold on. Her face tells me enough; she is disgusted by the idea of having two Mates. This leaves me with one last question: why settle for the twin that has no right to a high rank according to his Mother?‚Äù Ruth states, her eyes locked with those of my Mother.

Damn, that woman is good. She managed to ask a question that has eluded me all these years.

My Mother is looking a little pale, and Daniella looks as if she is about to throw up; why does that deduction from Ruth unsettle them so much? Have I been missing something all these years?

# Goddess' Gift

Dallas‚Äô p.o.v.

Okay, this is not what I had been expecting. I don‚Äôt believe anyone in our Squad had seen it coming and I am still a little baffled.

Captain Jordan announced his retirement at the ceremony that would make me a fully pledged member of the Squad, but it turned out to go a little differently after his announcement.

Elder Jensen had appointed me as the new Squad Captain and everyone had started cheering for me, but I had been unable to say a word. I have been here a little over six months and now I have my own Squad.

I know there have been a few others who made Squad Captain within a year of arriving, but I am not sure if this is what I want or need in my life at the moment.

I mean, it is an honor that they believe that I can handle this. There is a downside to it, though. I might have to visit Shadow Valley Pack, and I am not sure if I am ready for that at the moment.

‚ÄúCaptain, Elder Jensen wants to see you. He is waiting in your office.‚Äù Joshua, my second in command, says and I wonder why Elder Jensen didn‚Äôt link me. ‚ÄúYou have your block up, Captain.‚Äù

I smile at Joshua as I walk out of my room; I didn‚Äôt just take over as Captain; I also got Jordan‚Äôs room, and that means living on the other side of the top floor. Joshua follows me to my office on the first floor and everyone we pass slightly bows their heads, a sign of respect for my position.

‚ÄúI wish they wouldn‚Äôt do that; it makes me feel uncomfortable. I am still the same person as before, and now the same people who ignored me suddenly show me respect.‚Äù I say to Joshua as another woman slightly bows her head.

‚ÄúIt will become even worse; they will start to talk to you.‚Äù He replies teasingly and Charna is laughing her ass off.

I softly growl at Joshua, and he is smart enough to create a little distance between us. He is one of the few people in our Squad that knows about what other members of other Squads have said to me, each and every one of them implicating that I was Jordan‚Äôs lover.

It wasn‚Äôt until someone said that I had to go and find my own true Mate-bond, that I lost control of my patients and Charna. That fucking Idiot is still in the infirmary and once he has fully recovered, he gets sent home.

No one has dared to make a similar remark to me ever since, but I have gotten enough death glares and I prefer it that way. My Squad members know that I got where I am because of all the hard work I put into it, and none of them question my ability to lead this Squad.

‚ÄúElder Jensen, I apologize for having my block up. I was just finishing up for my last exam and I didn‚Äôt want to get distracted.‚Äù I say as I sit down behind my desk.

‚ÄúNo worries, I knew you were studying. I wanted to do this personally and in private; I know this will be difficult for you, and it might not.‚Äù Elder Jensen says.

Joshua and I are looking at one another, this guy is talking in riddles and I don‚Äôt think I have the patience for it today.

Elder Jensen holds out an envelope for me and after a small hesitation, I take it from his outstretched hand. I recognize the Pack emblem and my first instinct is to throw it back at Elder Jensen, but my curiosity wins.

We are proud to announce the Alpha Ceremony for our Son, Nico, and the Luna Ceremony for his Mate, Lucy.

I don‚Äôt bother reading the rest of the card. I close the card before putting it in the envelope, and I hand it back to Elder Jensen.

‚ÄúWe both know that Nico and Lucy don‚Äôt have a true Mate-bond and that causes an issue for the Elders, but we also want to send out a message to every other Pack in the Kingdom. So, we will wait until the Ceremony, and you will get the honor of telling them that the Alpha Ceremony is canceled.‚Äù Elder Jensen says.

Joshua looks at me for a moment before he seems to understand why I am getting the honor of disrupting an Alpha Ceremony.

‚ÄúHow long do we have?‚Äù I ask Elder Jensen, I need to prepare myself mentally.

‚ÄúYou have over six months to prepare; you know the rules for an Alpha or Luna Ceremony cancellation. Also, make sure that there is a trial date for Alpha Leon, just in case he is willing to fight our decision in front of the King.‚Äù Elder Jensen replies.

‚ÄúOkay, Joshua. Let‚Äôs get this Shitshow on the road; I want the cancellation forms filled out. Alpha Leon will ask for them and he will ask for a trial to overturn their own Pack-law.‚Äù I say as I show Elder Jensen to the door.

I open the door to let Elder Jensen out and I see my third in command, Jesper, waiting outside the door.

‚ÄúGet in here, Jesper. We have more than enough to do and, luckily, a whole lot of time to do it in. I do need some answers, though, and maybe you can help me with that.‚Äù I say as Jesper walks into my office.

Joshua hands him the envelope and I softly growl at the mere sight of the Pack emblem on it.

For a few moments, it is quiet in my office, but then Jesper starts laughing his ass off.

‚ÄúLet me guess, we get to break up the happy shindig?‚Äù He asks and starts laughing even harder. Someone seems to be happy to be a party pooper and I actually have to giggle.

I decide to tell both of them why I get the privilege of dealing with the cancellation and both men growl loudly.

Jesper went through a similar situation and Joshua had his connection broken before there was a chance to form a bond.

Why Nico chose Lucy over me is still unknown; Jesper and Joshua both know why they were turned down. Neither of them had a high enough rank; both women wanted an Alpha.

Well, good luck. Most Alphas are arrogant, obnoxious, and rude; they truly believe that they are the Goddess‚Äô gift to women.

1n47gyw,https://i.redd.it/hq6mywbkz6mf1.jpeg,Taylor Swift is the Most Overrated ‚ÄúArtist‚Äù of Our Time (aka White Girl Muzak 101),"You know what blows my mind? That people are paying $3000+ to sit in the nosebleeds just to hear Taylor Swift whisper-sing breakup diary entries from 10 kilometers away. Imagine telling your landlord you couldn‚Äôt make rent because you needed to go on a holy pilgrimage to see Mother Taylor lol how they even calling her this without cringing crazy???
For crying out loud Taylor Swift isn‚Äôt an artist. She‚Äôs a brand manager who figured out that suburban white girls who never emotionally graduate from age 16 are the best ATMs. Her music is literally ‚Äúpumpkin spice latte in mp3 form.‚Äù Same four chords, same lyrics: ‚ÄúHe broke my heart, but I‚Äôm stronger now (until the next guy dumps me and I write another album).‚Äù Call that empowerment? Bro, that‚Äôs just monetized immaturity. And don‚Äôt get me started on her toxic ‚Äúall men are trash‚Äù shtick and yet she has 13 boyfriends!!! 13 is a concern number of cats a 90 year old grandma can own and it would be still to much in my humble opinion. Funny thing is that she had this much boyfriends and magically every single one was the villain? Nah, you‚Äôre the common denominator. If a male artist dropped 13 albums calling his exes manipulative witches, the media would burn him at the stake. But Taylor? ‚ÄúYaaas queen, feminist icon!!‚Äù Nah, she‚Äôs just peddling misandry with a guitar. It's not even something crazy I'm saying it's common sense. If you go to a store and buy 13 apples and all 13 of them be rotten, after coming home and giving them to your family, your family is not gonna be like: ""wow that store sucks it doesn't have any good apple"" they will say:""your such an idiot that between all the hundreds of good apples in the store, you picked the rotten ones"".
Her cult-like fanbase are even worse. Swifties act like defending Taylor from mild criticism is their full-time job. You could say ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt like this song‚Äù and suddenly you‚Äôre being doxxed by 15-year-olds who think buying friendship bracelets counts as a political statement. They‚Äôre basically Trump supporters in friendship bracelets: worship their leader, ignore all logic, attack anyone who disagrees, and they share the combination of 2 brain cells with their small ahh brain. Even tho her fanbase is crazy, I still don't get why people look so scared of criticizing Taylor. this is free world and I'm allowed to trash talk whoever I want. If you're so immature and childish that that you can't accept the smallest types of criticism against your favorite so called artist, that's your problem not mine and you need to touch some grass. I'm not scared of saying what I want and neither do you.
Taylor Swift‚Äôs entire career is proof that mediocrity + aggressive marketing = billionaire success. She‚Äôs not something special. She‚Äôs the definition of ‚Äúwhite girl music‚Äù from the 2010s basic, bland, and embarrassingly safe. And yet she‚Äôs treated like a messiah. Her concerts are described as ‚Äúspiritual experiences.‚Äù Spiritual??!!??! Bro, you paid a month‚Äôs salary to scream ‚ÄúWe Are Never Ever Getting Back Together‚Äù with a bunch of crying 30-year-old grown ahh woman in sequins. That‚Äôs not spirituality that‚Äôs a group therapy session with fireworks. I'm ngl, when I think about it more, Taylor Swift and Dexter both have a thing in common. They both have a dark passenger. The difference is that Dexter kills people to feed his but Taylor feeds hers by devouring boyfriends until she‚Äôs sucked them dry for lyrics, money, and fan worship.  She keeps treating boyfriends like a money glitch, and she‚Äôll need industrial-strength equipment just to keep up with her own ""dark passenger"" lol.

And let‚Äôs not forget Taylor didn‚Äôt ‚Äúmake it on her own.‚Äù Her dad pumped around $300,000 into her career and bought into her first label to boost her launch.Combine that with her family moving to Nashville (the country music capital), industry connections, and her parents funding her early demos she wasn‚Äôt clawing her way up, she was on a red carpet from the start. A MAN literally paved her way to stardom, yet she built her entire persona on trashing men as if they‚Äôre the source of all evil. Without daddy‚Äôs investment, she‚Äôd still be strumming in a coffee shop. The hypocrisy is insane.
At the end of the day, Taylor Swift isn‚Äôt empowering women. She‚Äôs exploiting them. She doesn‚Äôt teach independence, she teaches dependency ONLY on her brand. She‚Äôs not ‚ÄúMother,‚Äù she‚Äôs the Stepford Wife of pop music, selling recycled breakup songs to people desperate to feel special. So congrats to Taylor on scamming her way to billionaire status. But let‚Äôs stop pretending she‚Äôs an artist. She‚Äôs a businesswoman who turned mediocrity into a religion. And her congregation is too busy throwing money at her altar to notice they‚Äôre being played. She doesn't care about teaching women she just wants to be worshipped by them.",1,1756575083.0,u_Xander_666666,0,1.0,False

I have a Master's Degree in Management and work for a big coffee roaster. However, I had Accounting for 2 semesters, where we covered all the basics pretty much, but I feel like I am lacking the knowledge and skill of reading the balance sheet, P&L statements, how to do cash flow analysis, gross margins, net margins, EBITDA, EBITDA margins etc. Could you please suggest some material where can I dive a bit deeper into all of it to better understand my company, industry etc. I want to be able to read balance sheets to see the debt ratio, see how and where the cash is moving out of the company etc. Any help is much appreciated.",1,1756575077.0,Accounting,0,1.0,False

I wanted to share a small accessory I designed for my Lelit William PL72 grinder.
It‚Äôs a 58mm dosing funnel, 3D-printed in PETG, that helps prevent coffee grounds from spilling over the portafilter and keeps the workflow much cleaner.

For me, it really improved daily use (less waste, cleaner counter, easier dosing).
I‚Äôm curious to hear from you:

Do you already use a funnel like this, or a similar accessory?

Do you see any improvements or adaptations that could make sense (other grinders, other sizes)?

For those who don‚Äôt use one, would you consider it useful or more of a ‚Äúnice-to-have‚Äù gadget?

I worked at a small coffee shop called the coffee bean a boring name for a boring shop.

As soon as s I set foot in that crappy place my boss came up to me Lea he said with a deeper tone I knew this was nothing good shit I thought.

I walked In to his office ‚Äútake a seat‚Äù he said he looked at me then his hands then the wall ‚Äúlook I know you don‚Äôt want to do this and I hate telling you this you have to stay at work later tonight and probably for most nights we need more money I‚Äôm broke people need to stay later than usual for a while‚Äù ‚Äúnoooooo‚Äù I groaned but then I saw it his eye was slightly blood shot and his skin was slightly more pail and his hand was banged before¬† could ask him what was wrong with his hand he told me to start working and leave his office.

That morning I took some orders and some whisky from my flask but only on toilet breaks but one woman stood out to me her skin was pail to the same as my boss her eyes were pink round the edges and one had no iris and just a pupel she spoke with a slight growl but she sounded tired to like she had just woken up but she just had a uncanny similar look to my boss.

‚ÄúOrder twenty nine‚Äù I shouted and waited but nobody came but yhen I remembered it was the odd lady‚Äôs tea maybey she had gone to sleep so asked my friend jone¬† to go and wake her quickly BIG MISTAKE that was the last thing I ask jone to do.

Then a scream blood curtailing scream the woman had bit jone blood everywhere jone streaked half her neck had been eaten of with a spray of blood jones lifeless body fell to the floor her head hit with a thud she was dead her blood streamed between the tiles people ran knocking me down one man tried running but the woman jumped on him biting his shoulder blood cover his face run he screams my I stood there frozen then my friend Mike grabs my hand and we run for are lives we.

We can hear screams coming from the coffee shop and loud police sirens get closer we got in to the sub way and we‚Äôre safe so we thought

After the train started people were looking us blood splatted on me and mikes apron and face.

After a few stops we heard screams coming from up the train then a man caught my eye pail face blood shot eyes just nearly hanging on to the rail.

The man collapsed passengers surrounded him Mike left his seat but I grabbed him ‚Äúdon‚Äôt go Mike‚Äù I said a crowd of eight or so people surrounded him one man trying to do cpr on him and a woman went to tell the driver ‚Äúhow dose he look‚Äù Mike said ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know but his eyes are blood shot and he‚Äôs really pail but he‚Äôs still breathing‚Äù replies the man doing cpr.

‚ÄúWe need to get out of here‚Äù I said grabbing mikes hand pulling him in to the next carriage.

As soon as we left we heard screaming and growling we watched as the pale man jumped on to a woman bitting her neck a man pulled out a pistol and shot the pale mans chest.

Nothing the pale man ran to him and jumped a splat of blood on the window all we could here was gun shots and screams.

And then silence me Mike sat in silence the other people on the train looked shocked one asked me ‚Äúwhat was that‚Äù ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know‚Äù i said my voice shaking.

After about five minutes the train stoped as soon as the doors opened me and Mike ran faster than I ever had we heard growls from the people in the second carriage we looked down the escalator and saw people running up the steps and pale people following after them the sound of there footsteps agents the metal.

We heard the siren when we got out of the train station I knew we were near my neighbourhood my house was near bye.

When we got home my little brother was waiting bye the window looking out and my mum was bye the door she let us in as soon as she saw us.

‚ÄúYou poor things are you alright‚Äù she said ‚Äúfine‚Äù Mike said my little brother joey came running in to hug me crying ‚ÄúI thought wernt coming back‚Äù I told him we were fine and we aren‚Äôt hurt.

My mum cooked me and Mike a small ‚Äúgot to save food don‚Äôt know how long this will last‚Äù she smiled.

they did a lot of blood work and said everything looked good. i also had 3-4 ekgs, 2 chest x-rays, and an echocardiogram, all of which came back normal. no abnormal rhythm, just a very fast heart rate.

they put me on metoprolol and sent me home with an mcot monitor for 2 weeks, but since starting the meds i‚Äôve felt really dizzy and tired. my blood pressure and heart rate are usually normal unless i‚Äôm anxious.

""You've weathered countless storms over the years. Welcome home, Arabella.""  
  
At the celebratory dinner, a young man in a perfectly tailored suit found himself unwilling to look away from Arabella Stanley.   
  
She possessed an otherworldly beauty, her sharp features sculpted with precision and wrapped in an aura of cool detachment.   
  
Her piercing eyes revealed nothing of her inner thoughts, and when she spoke, her voice carried the same arctic chill. ""I'm leaving now.""  
  
Joshua Willis, the young man, seized the moment without hesitation. ""Allow me to drive you home.""  
  
Arabella offered no resistance.   
  
The car glided through the night. The city lights blurred past as Joshua stole glances at her profile.  
  
""When do you plan to return to the company? Our empire continues to flourish.""  
  
Their partnership had begun years ago through a chance project, and Joshua had witnessed Arabella's brilliance firsthand.   
  
He had persuaded her to join forces, and together they had forged a company that now dominated the entire industry.   
  
Arabella maintained her measured tone. ""I'll decide when the time feels right. For now, I simply want to reach home.""  
  
""Understood completely. You must be eager to reunite with Daisy. She's undoubtedly thriving. I've been directing all the premium projects to your aunt's husband throughout these years."" Joshua's grin widened as he angled for recognition.   
  
Arabella and her twin sister Daisy Stanley had lost their parents at the tender age of six, and their aunt Meagan Tucker had stepped in to care for them both.   
  
Arabella acknowledged him with a subtle nod. ""I appreciate that.""  
  
Her delicate fingers found the cherry blossom pendant resting against her throat, clicking it open to reveal a treasured photograph of herself and Daisy.   
  
Arabella's expression remained stoic in the image, but Daisy's smile blazed with pure joy.   
  
Studying her sister's radiant face, Arabella felt an unfamiliar warmth soften her features.   
  
After their parents' tragic death, Arabella and Daisy had become each other's entire world. Daisy had always been their family's ray of sunshine, illuminating every room she entered.   
  
At twelve, Arabella had been handpicked by the government for a classified operation that consumed seven years of her life. Now that the mission had concluded, she could finally return to Daisy.   
  
She had forwarded nearly every government paycheck to her sister, ensuring Daisy lived in comfort and security.   
  
Joshua's eyes widened in amazement as he witnessed Arabella's smile.   
  
The legendary ice queen was actually smiling?   
  
His curiosity about Arabella's sister intensified dramatically.   
  
The car approached an upscale residential community, where each house boasted its own meticulously maintained garden.   
  
The vehicle glided to a stop in front of a house.   
  
This was the home Arabella's parents had bequeathed to them, now shared between Meagan and Daisy.   
  
The estate glowed with warm light, alive with the sound of cheerful laughter.   
  
Daisy seemed to be flourishing beautifully.   
  
With that thought in mind, Arabella preserved her gentle smile as she crossed into the front yard.   
  
A weathered doghouse sat in the corner of the property.   
  
Someone knelt beside it in the shadows.   
  
Through the dim evening light, Arabella couldn't distinguish the person's features, but she watched them scooping food directly from the bowl placed on the ground.   
  
Why would someone be eating beside the doghouse?   
  
Concern creased her brow as Arabella approached cautiously.   
  
The figure appeared startled and scrambled quickly into the doghouse.   
  
Arabella's bewilderment deepened. Then a soft, trembling voice drifted from within the shelter.  
  
""Please don't strike me again. I won't make any mistakes. I'll be so much more careful...""  
  
That voice belonged to Daisy.   
  
Arabella's heart shattered instantly. She lunged forward, pulling the figure from the doghouse. Even in the pale moonlight, she recognized her beloved sister immediately.   
  
Daisy stared back, her eyes swimming with disbelief. ""You..."" she breathed, as though she feared her mind was playing cruel tricks on her.   
  
""Daisy, is that truly you?"" Arabella's voice trembled with disbelief.   
  
When Daisy nodded weakly, a glacial fury erupted within Arabella, her eyes igniting with volcanic rage.   
  
""Bella..."" Daisy whispered, still trapped in shock. ""You've actually come back?""  
  
The moment felt impossibly surreal to Daisy, like a vision conjured from desperate longing.   
  
Arabella, sensing something terribly wrong, reached out to touch Daisy's forehead. Her skin burned with fever.   
  
Before Arabella could process this discovery, Daisy crumpled into her arms like a broken doll.   
  
Arabella cradled her sister, whose body felt heartbreakingly frail and ice-cold despite the raging fever consuming her.   
  
Arabella's heart crystallized into something harder than diamond.   
  
The front door of the house suddenly burst open with violent force.   
  
""Daisy, you worthless creature! It's been several minutes, and you're still not finished eating? Get inside immediately and wash those dishes!"" Meagan's voice sliced through the night air like a bl\*\*e.   
  
Arabella pivoted slowly, her predatory gaze locking onto her target.   
  
Meagan had transformed dramatically over the years.   
  
Once haggard and perpetually exhausted, she now radiated wealth and privilege, adorned in an expensive designer coat and gleaming jewelry that caught the porch light, presenting herself as the very embodiment of refined elegance.   
  
Meagan's bl\*\*d turned to ice under Arabella's lethal stare. ""You... Arabella? When did you arrive?""  
  
""What have you done to her?"" Arabella advanced with calculated steps, her voice dropping to a menacing whisper.   
  
Meagan instinctively retreated, unsettled by the predatory intensity burning in Arabella's eyes. But she quickly rallied her confidence, reminding herself that Arabella was still just a young woman.   
  
She twisted her lips into a cruel sneer. ""Daisy shattered a dish, so I administered appropriate punishment. You've been absent for years. Do you possess any understanding of how challenging life has been here? I never allowed her to starve or sleep without shelter. If you weren't my brother's daughters, I wouldn't have wasted my time with either of you.""  
  
In one fluid motion, Arabella's hand shot out and seized Meagan by the throat, her expression transforming into something carved from arctic stone.   
  
Meagan ga\*\*ed desperately, clawing at Arabella's iron grip. ""Let... me... go...""  
  
""This is my house,"" Arabella declared, her voice carrying the finality of a death sentence, her eyes radiating lethal intent.  
  
""You forced Daisy to perform menial labor. You made her sleep in that doghouse like an animal. You possess remarkable audacity, Meagan.""  
  
In the warm light streaming from the house, Arabella finally saw what Daisy had been consuming. It was the leftover food.   
  
Holding her sister, who felt as weightless as a dying bird and appeared ghostly pale and utterly drained, Arabella felt her heart shatter into countless pieces.   
  
Her precious sister had endured this nightmare!   
  
""Meagan,"" Arabella said, her voice saturated with deadly promise, ""when you moved into our home, you swore a sacred oath that you would care for Daisy.""  
  
Meagan bristled at Arabella's bold use of her first name, the disrespect cutting deep.   
  
But she shrank backward when she witnessed the murderous gleam dancing in Arabella's eyes.   
  
Arabella had always been fundamentally different from other children. She was cold and fearlessly bold.   
  
When Arabella had lived here, Meagan had performed the role of a dutiful aunt, though barely meeting even the lowest standards.   
  
But the moment Arabella departed, Meagan had seized absolute control, systematically crushing the gentle-spirited Daisy beneath her cruel authority.   
  
She had never imagined Arabella would return to witness her crimes.   
  
""I did take care of Daisy! She made a mistake, so I disciplined her accordingly. What's so terrible about that?""   
  
Meagan's words died in her throat as Arabella's grip tightened mercilessly, making her feel as though death itself was reaching for her soul.   
  
""Arabella?"" The violent commotion finally drew the attention of the people inside. Meagan's husband and daughter noticed the deadly confrontation unfolding at their door.   
  
Through the wide open front door, Arabella observed them living luxuriously in a spacious and magnificently decorated villa, with a table overflowing with exquisite delicacies.  
  
The people inside wore expensive clothing that spoke of comfort and abundance.   
  
Meanwhile, Daisy had been sleeping in a doghouse, consuming leftovers. Arabella's eyes burned with unshed tears as the devastating truth crashed over her with overwhelming force.   
  
  
Chapter 2 Can You Check Who Made The Payment  
Khloe Tucker was fuming.   
  
""Let go of my mom, Arabella! Back then, she offered to take care of you and Daisy out of kindness. Is that how you repay her? You show up after disappearing for years, acting like you're some kind of hero? What, did you run off, get pr\*\*nant, and have a kid or something? What a joke!""  
  
Khloe threw Arabella a nasty glare, but deep down, she actually hoped Arabella might stay. Having her back would mean more help around the house.   
  
But Arabella's eyes had already gone cold. Without saying a word, she entered the house and kicked the dining table hard.   
  
Dishes flew everywhere, crashing onto the floor and shattering into pieces.   
  
Before anyone could react, Arabella grabbed two vases and hurled them straight at Khloe and her father.   
  
They hit them squarely, and bl\*\*d started trickling down their faces as they screamed in shock.   
  
Her voice was ice. ""You've got one day. Get out of my house."" Without waiting for a reply, she stormed out with Daisy in her arms.   
  
She flagged down the first taxi she saw and rushed her sister straight to a hospital.   
  
Back at the villa, chaos broke out.   
  
""Mom! That psycho actually attacked me!"" Khloe sobbed, staring at the scratches on her face in the mirror. ""What if I'm left with scars?""  
  
Meagan's fury boiled over. ""She's gotten way too bold after all these years! If she shows her face again, she won't be so lucky. We're not nobodies anymore. We've joined hands with Norman Group. There's no way she can stand against us!""  
  
She gave Khloe a comforting pat. ""Don't worry, honey. I'm taking you to a hospital right now.""  
  
\*\*\*  
  
At the hospital, the doctor examined Daisy and frowned. ""Her leg's been broken for a while, and she's covered in bruises. Some of her teeth are missing too. What kind of sister lets this happen?""  
  
Arabella's voice was low. ""It's my fault.""  
  
Her bangs fell over her eyes, hiding whatever she was feeling inside.   
  
The doctor, noticing how quiet she was, spoke gently. ""I've done what I could for now. But if someone's been hurting you two, you need to report it. Keeping quiet won't fix anything.""  
  
Arabella gave a small nod and moved to stand beside Daisy's hospital bed.   
  
Daisy, now nineteen, looked heartbreakingly fragile. Her thin frame looked like it couldn't support itself, and her wrists seemed more like twigs than limbs.   
  
Her short hair was uneven, dry, and choppy, like someone had taken scissors to it without a second thought.   
  
Arabella gently lifted the blanket, and her heart dropped.   
  
Daisy's skin told a horrifying story. Old whip marks crisscrossed her legs, and dark burn spots marred her arms.  
  
Each scar screamed of cruelty. Arabella's breath caught, and before she could stop them, tears rolled down her cheeks.   
  
""Bella..."" Daisy's voice was barely a whisper.   
  
Arabella immediately reached for her hand. ""I'm here,"" she said softly.   
  
""I... missed you,"" Daisy murmured, her voice hoarse.   
  
Arabella clutched her hand like a lifeline. ""I missed you too. I thought if I worked hard, I could give you a better life. But I was wrong. I never should've left you alone. I swear, I'm not going anywhere again.""  
  
The warmth in Arabella's voice seemed to melt Daisy's tension. Slowly, her expression softened.   
  
After making sure Daisy was settled, Arabella went to sort out the payment.   
  
""The charges have already been covered,"" the nurse said with a kind smile.   
  
Arabella blinked. ""What? Who paid?""  
  
Joshua crossed her mind, but she quickly dismissed the thought. There was no way he knew about this yet.   
  
""Can you check who made the payment?"" she asked.   
  
The nurse gave an apologetic shake of the head. ""Sorry, that information's private. Maybe a family member helped out?""  
  
At the word family, Arabella's face turned to stone. She gave a short nod and walked off without another word. If someone had helped, she was going to find out who.   
  
Meanwhile, down the corridor, Meagan strolled beside her daughter, Khloe, who was fresh out of the emergency room with her face patched up.   
  
""I'm not letting Arabella walk away from this,"" Khloe snarled, bitterness burning in her voice.   
  
""Calm down,"" Meagan said sharply. ""You'll reopen your stitches if you keep flaring up like this. Be more like your sister--grace under pressure.""  
  
That seemed to cheer Khloe up. A smug smile tugged at her lips.  
  
""As long as my sister keeps shining, that's all that matters. She's the youngest dancer in the Griridge Troupe now. Daisy really thought she could outshine her? She was delusional. That broken leg was karma, if you ask me. And if my sister finds out how Arabella treated me--oh, she'll tear her apart.""  
  
""She's got a big show coming up,"" Meagan reminded her. ""Let's not distract her. One step at a time.""  
  
She tapped Khloe's nose lightly, but then her expression stiffened as she spotted Arabella ahead.   
  
Khloe saw Arabella too, and just the sight of her brought back the sting of humiliation. Her rage boiled over.   
  
Without thinking, she grabbed her studded handbag and swung it with all her strength toward Arabella's back.   
  
Arabella's instincts kicked in. Just as she turned around, a tall man came into view. With quick reflexes and strong arms, he grabbed the bag mid-air by its strap, stopping it like it was nothing.   
  
The sudden pull made Khloe lose her balance, and with a startled scream, she fell to the floor.   
  
  
Chapter 3 Grab Your Things And Come With Me  
""Khloe!"" Meagan hurried to her daughter's side, helping her up while shooting a vicious glare at the man who had shown up out of nowhere.   
  
""Who the h\*\*l are you? Arabella's new guy or what?""  
  
The man didn't bother responding. His sharp eyes gave nothing away, cold and unreadable, like the still, deep sea that hid its danger.   
  
Then he began walking toward Meagan, each step loud and heavy on the hospital floor.   
  
Meagan instinctively took a step back. Her ch\*\*t tightened, making it hard to breathe.   
  
Deep down, something told her this man wasn't just any stranger--he was trouble.   
  
Trying to mask her unease, she snapped, ""Arabella, you'd better think twice before crossing us again. You and your sister were lucky we let you stay at all! If you ever want back in, come crawling, and maybe we'll consider it.""  
  
Yanking Khloe's arm, Meagan stormed off.   
  
Arabella stood silently, watching them go. Let them stay? That house was legally Daisy's and hers.   
  
She glanced at the man and caught sight of a pi\*\*ol, just for a second, before it disappeared beneath his jacket. Her eyes narrowed slightly.   
  
Who was this guy?   
  
He turned and looked directly at her. Arabella finally saw his face--handsome as h\*\*l, rough around the edges, and those icy eyes didn't blink or soften for anyone.   
  
He gave off a vibe that screamed danger--Arabella had never felt anything like it.   
  
No surprise Meagan bolted--anyone with sense would have.   
  
""Arabella Stanley,"" he said. His tone was calm and low, but there was a chill in it that made her skin prickle.   
  
Arabella glanced him over. ""You're the one who paid for my sister, right?""  
  
He gave a faint nod. ""You're quick. Grab your things and come with me.""  
  
Arabella's brows drew together. ""Excuse me?""  
  
Who even was this guy, showing up with mystery and attitude?   
  
Before things got tenser, another man stepped in--less intimidating but equally serious.  
  
""Miss Stanley, allow me to explain. This is Mr. Asher Gordon. His father and your dad served together in the military. Before his father passed away, he asked Mr. Gordon to watch over your family. Mr. Gordon only recently returned from service and has been trying to track you down since.""  
  
That explained the military presence, the icy calm... the way he moved like someone trained for war.   
  
Arabella studied Asher again. He didn't seem threatening now, but just closed off, like someone with a wall too thick to climb over.   
  
She stayed calm. ""You got anything to back that up? Anyone can say that.""  
  
Asher reached into his pocket and pulled out a weathered photo.   
  
It showed two men in dusty uniforms--one was definitely her father. The other looked a lot like him.   
  
She stared at it for a long moment before replying, ""I'll think about it.""  
  
""Fair. Let's exchange numbers,"" Asher replied without any small talk.   
  
Arabella added his contact. His WhatsApp display was just a solid black box.   
  
Funny enough, hers was the same.   
  
A strange little coincidence, she thought.   
  
Then the assistant added her as well. ""Dominick Powell, Mr. Gordon's right hand. Reach out if you need help with anything, anytime.""  
  
Arabella gave a nod. ""Got it.""  
  
With that, the two men walked off, and Arabella made her way back to Daisy's room.   
  
Shortly after, two silent, suited bodyguards appeared at the door--they were clearly sent by Asher.   
  
Arabella didn't ask questions. She got to work helping Daisy clean up--changing her into fresh clothes and gently washing her hair, trying to fix its brittle, uneven mess.   
  
But when she saw the scars and ci\*\*rette burns covering Daisy's body, her eyes welled up again.   
  
Holding back her tears, she carefully rubbed her homemade cream onto the wounds. Then, without wasting a second, she opened her laptop.   
  
She had to find out what had happened to Daisy while she was gone, so she hacked into the villa's security system.   
  
Sadly, what she saw made her sick to her stomach.   
  
It wasn't long after Arabella left that Daisy was thrown out of her own bedroom and made to sleep in a doghouse.   
  
The cheerful, lively sister Arabella remembered didn't smile anymore.   
  
She saw footage of Daisy juggling multiple part-time jobs, only to get ha\*\*ssed and pushed around.   
  
Even so, she kept working hard and made it into one of the top universities. But during her very first semester, she ended up with a broken leg.   
  
She was studying dance, and just like that, the injury shattered everything she had dreamed of.   
  
The pieces fell into place too easily. Khloe's sister, Elissa Tucker, was in the same class. Arabella's gut told her that leg injury hadn't been some fluke.   
  
After that, Daisy barely left the house. She was treated like hired help, scrubbing floors, cooking meals, and still sleeping out in that d\*\*n doghouse.   
  
Yet every time Daisy texted her, it was the same lie. ""I'm doing fine. Don't worry about me. You just take care of yourself.""  
  
Arabella's vision blurred.   
  
While her sister was being broken piece by piece, their aunt's family was thriving. Their business had taken off, thanks to a lucrative deal with the Vanguard Group.   
  
Khloe, a middle school dropout, was suddenly a digital influencer. Elissa was famous and popular in the college.   
  
Meagan was rubbing shoulders with high-society ladies, and her husband had become some corporate hotshot.   
  
Arabella clenched her jaw and slammed her fist against the table. She didn't even feel the sting.   
  
Every bit of success she had worked for... had only served to feed that vile family's greed.   
  
And the one person she had sworn to protect had suffered in silence the entire time.   
  
  
Chapter 4 This Revenge Is Mine To Carry Out  
Arabella took a slow breath, wiped the tears from her cheeks, and her eyes turned cold, like a fire had been snuffed out and replaced with ice.  
  
Her fingers gripped her phone tightly as she made a call. ""That major project--it hasn't been handed over to the Tucker Group yet, right? Cancel it. Completely."" Her voice was calm but firm.  
  
""And get to the Griridge Hospital. Now.""  
  
On the other end, Joshua sounded startled. ""Arabella? What's going on?""  
  
""You'll see when you get here. Bring a few things with you.""  
  
True to form, Joshua didn't waste time. Less than half an hour later, he rushed into the hospital, and the moment his eyes landed on the girl in the hospital bed, he froze like a statue.  
  
She looked so much like Arabella--same face, but all color drained, bruised, battered, her body wrecked like it had been thrown away and forgotten.   
  
Joshua's fists clenched. ""Who did this? Tell me who it was. I'll make them pay, I swear it!""  
  
That was the sister of a preeminent figure... and they treated her like this?   
  
Arabella didn't flinch. ""I'll handle it myself. Slowly,"" she muttered, picking up a pair of sc\*\*sors from the table.   
  
Before Joshua could react, the sc\*\*sors had already cut through her long, silky hair. The strands dropped to the floor in silence.   
  
He stared, stunned. ""Arabella... you're not actually...""  
  
""I am,"" she said. ""This revenge is mine to carry out.""  
  
Joshua swallowed hard, goosebumps rising on his arms.   
  
The way she said it--it was clear. H\*\*l was coming for someone.   
  
Arabella glanced at him. ""Also, what do you know about the Gordons?""  
  
""The Gordon family?"" He immediately straightened.   
  
""They're legendary. Way beyond the top elite families. Super wealthy, but incredibly discreet. I've only ever worked with the right-hand man of their current CEO.""  
  
""You mean Dominick Powell?"" Arabella asked casually.   
  
Joshua's jaw dropped. ""Wait, you know Dominick? Don't tell me... are you saying the Gordons were involved in what happened to Daisy?""  
  
Arabella gave him a blank stare before calmly explaining Asher's connection and what he had said earlier. Joshua slapped his thigh, clearly overwhelmed.   
  
""Asher Gordon? If it's really him, then yeah, no one's faking that. He leads the family. Rumor has it he's ex-special forces, quiet as a ghost, but deadly. If someone crosses him, they don't get a second chance.""  
  
Arabella didn't react. She just stared at the floor, her thoughts turning in circles.   
  
Then she spoke, steady and cold. ""You should head out now. Also... sell my villa.""  
  
Joshua hesitated. ""That place... that's your parents' home. Are you sure?""  
  
Arabella looked over at Daisy's fragile frame. ""She was tortured in that house. There's no comfort left there. Just get rid of it.""  
  
Her voice cracked slightly. ""And if possible, find a buyer who's impossible to deal with.""  
  
Joshua gave her a long look, then nodded. ""Understood. I've got a bunch of properties lined up. If you ever need a place, it's yours.""  
  
""Thanks.""  
  
She didn't look up, and Joshua, sensing she needed space, quietly slipped out the door.   
  
Left alone, Arabella gently held Daisy's hand and murmured, ""I swear, everyone who hurt you... I'll make them pay for it tenfold.""  
  
That night felt endless, and sleep didn't come.   
  
The next morning, Arabella stood quietly outside a dance studio at Griridge University's dance department, listening through the open door.   
  
""Elissa, things have been so dull without that pathetic girl around,"" someone inside snickered.   
  
""I know, right? No one to fetch us coffee, no one to mess with. It's no fun without a punching bag,"" another chimed in.   
  
Peering through the glass window, Arabella spotted Elissa in the middle of the dance studio.   
  
Years ago, Elissa had been just a pale, skinny kid. Now she was dressed in a flowing white dance outfit, all elegance and grace, like something out of a dream.   
  
Surrounded by classmates, Elissa flashed a gentle, modest smile at the comments. ""Guys, don't say that. Let's not be mean.""  
  
""You're too kind, Elissa,"" Joyce Lambert, her good friend, scoffed. ""That girl sponged off your family for years. If it were me, I'd have thrown her out of your house on day one.""  
  
Arabella narrowed her eyes slightly.   
  
Calling it their house? Seriously?   
  
That place belonged to her and Daisy. Elissa and her family were the ones living off of them.   
  
Elissa tilted her head, her voice syrupy sweet. ""She's my cousin, after all. Her parents passed away. If we didn't take her in, she would've had nowhere to go.""  
  
Her fake compassion earned gasps of admiration from the crowd.   
  
What a generous soul, they all seemed to think.   
  
The loud chatter in the dance studio instantly stopped the moment Arabella walked in.   
  
""Daisy?"" Joyce blinked in surprise.   
  
She stared at Arabella, stunned. She looked the same, but... something about her felt different now.   
  
  
Chapter 5 Got Yourself A Su\*\*r Daddy  
The dance studio fell silent, as if someone had hit pause.   
  
Every single eye was locked on Arabella, but she acted like she didn't see a thing and confidently made her way to the back, where she began stretching like it was just another day.   
  
Joyce's jaw clenched. ""Daisy, you've got some nerve showing up out of nowhere like this!"" Joyce barked, marching over and swinging a sharp kick at her.  
  
""Just because we've gone easy on you doesn't mean you're not taking orders from us!""  
  
But Arabella moved with ease, dodging the kick without breaking a sweat. Joyce lost her balance and hit the floor face-first with a loud, painful thud.   
  
""You dodged me?"" Joyce screeched in disbelief. Her face turned red with fury as she raised her hand to s\*\*p Arabella.   
  
But just like before, Arabella slipped out of reach like a shadow. Joyce's swing caught nothing but air, and she stumbled forward, grabbing her lower back with a wince. ""D\*\*n it!""  
  
""My bad,"" Arabella said gently, her voice almost too soft to catch.   
  
Joyce wanted to explode, but something about Arabella's calmness made her hesitate.   
  
She didn't dare swing again. Instead, she snapped, ""What are you just standing there for? Get over here and help us stretch already!""  
  
""So, Daisy's really back,"" she thought smugly. ""Still the same pathetic errand girl.""  
  
Arabella's gaze briefly darkened, but she gave a polite nod like an obedient student.   
  
She knelt beside Joyce and began helping her with leg stretches. Joyce smirked. ""You look even sadder than before. Honestly, it's pathetic.""  
  
But then, a painful scream cut through the air.   
  
Joyce's leg jolted, and she broke into a cold sweat, grabbing her thigh. ""My leg... what the h\*\*l? Did you snap my leg?""  
  
The class crowded around her in a frenzy.   
  
""Is she alright? Someone call for help!""  
  
""Look, the teacher just walked in!""  
  
Their panic was cut short as the teacher entered the room.   
  
Arabella still had Joyce's leg in her hands. Calmly, almost casually, she gave it a subtle twist.   
  
""Ah!"" Joyce screamed even louder, nearly in tears from the pain.   
  
""What's going on in here?"" The teacher frowned, scanning the chaos.   
  
""My leg! It feels broken... I can't--"" Joyce wailed, then blinked in confusion. Just seconds later, she could move it again. ""Wait... what?""  
  
""You look fine to me."" The teacher shot a look at Joyce--one that wasn't exactly sympathetic. She had seen enough of these girls' antics over the years.  
  
""I don't care what drama you're cooking up on your own time, but today's important. The Griridge Troupe selection is happening. The dean and senior faculty will be here shortly, so I expect everyone to act like professionals.""  
  
""I swear, I..."" Joyce began, trying to protest.   
  
""That's enough."" Elissa cut her off, stepping forward with an easy smile. ""Let's not waste more time. Joyce, calm down.""  
  
Elissa's tone made it clear--this wasn't the time to pick fights.   
  
Joyce had no choice but to bite her tongue and swallow her anger, though her glare at Arabella could have burned through steel.   
  
The teacher clapped her hands, and class began.   
  
During the last twenty minutes, a few other teachers showed up to observe.   
  
By the time class ended, the room was filled with a mix of nervous energy and excited chatter.   
  
""God, I really hope I get picked. Dancing alongside Elissa would be a dream come true.""  
  
""Elissa, don't forget us when you're famous!"" someone teased.   
  
Elissa gave her signature angelic smile. ""Of course not. You're all my people.""  
  
Then someone dropped a name that made the entire class go silent. ""They say Isabella might be watching today.""  
  
Gasps rippled through the room.   
  
Even Elissa blinked in shock, her breath catching. Isabella Wallace was the icon of modern dance.   
  
Her performances were legendary, her choreography unrivaled. Just being seen by her could open doors.   
  
""If Isabella notices me, that's it. That's my breakthrough,"" Elissa thought, her gaze sharpening with quiet ambition.  
  
But then someone spoke up, disrupting the mood. ""I saw Daisy dancing earlier. Honestly, she wasn't bad at all.""  
  
Joyce scoffed loud enough for the room to hear. ""Daisy? Please. She's pathetic. No way she'd get picked.""  
  
Turning her attention to Daisy, she said, ""Hey, what are you still doing here, anyway? Go get our lunch. You remember our order, right?""  
  
Without a word, Arabella nodded and walked off, her tall frame moving with a silent elegance despite the slump in her shoulders.   
  
""Ugh. Even the way she walks is irritating. Does she actually think she's all graceful or something? What a complete eyesore!"" Joyce sneered.   
  
By the time Joyce, Elissa, and the rest of their group showed up at the cafeteria, laughing and cracking jokes, Arabella already had their meals prepared.  
  
Her eyes quietly scanned each of them--calm, blank, giving nothing away. But in her mind, she was taking note of everything.   
  
Joyce, whose father ran the Lambert Group, was spoiled beyond belief and filthy rich.   
  
Next to her was Kenzie Marsh--the meek, glasses-wearing music student who practically worshipped the ground Elissa walked on.   
  
And behind them, the two guys were followers, plain and simple. They were all muscle without a mind.   
  
Joyce looked at the food Arabella had bought and narrowed her eyes. ""Well, well. Where'd you get the cash, huh? Got yourself a su\*\*r daddy? I thought you were broke, freeloader.""  
  
Joyce kept running her mouth but still dove into the food--everyone was starving after dancing all morning.   
  
However, midway through eating, something went terribly wrong. Joyce coughed violently, bl\*\*d trickling from her lips as she clutched her throat, her eyes wide in panic.   
  
The others followed suit, gasping, hands around their necks, as if something sharp was tearing through their throats.   
  
""It burns--what's happening?"" they wh\*\*zed, struggling to speak as pain ripped through them.   
  
Elissa stared at her in disbelief, still holding her throat. ""Daisy... what did you do?""  
  
""That little bi\*\*h's getting revenge!"" Joyce screamed, losing it completely. ""You think Elissa letting you tag along means we'll go easy on you? You're dead!""  
  
Furious, she flung her food tray at Arabella, while the two boys beside her instinctively lunged forward, ready to grab her without hesitation.

the rest of my post is my question about repetitive work and caffeine. i think i am neurodiverse so i am going to make an appointment with my university and GP

i've been especially good at comprehensive repetitive work like cleaning or alphabetical sorting or filing since i can remember, likely because at the end, when i can relax completely because i know something is fully and comprehensively complete (in fact, full but not comprehensive enough would be a dealbreaker), the chemicals my brain does are especially strong

i stopped drinking caffeine years ago so that i could get healthier sleep. but i think that i burned myself out about 2 months ago, and since then it's been harder to complete repetitive work even though i know it will still feel good once it's done. i have just started getting better, but this morning i felt worse again, so i made a cup of non-decaf coffee to try and salvage the day

..and now i'm having a caffeine high? it's like my brain is back in business and all the lights are back on. the work feels good again, i'm just more optimistic again, and colours are brighter (not literally). even my mouth feels good (i think caffeine can be absorbed there?)

1n46z1z,https://www.reddit.com/r/analyzeme/comments/1n46z1z/the_consequences_of_confessing_your_feelings_to/,"The consequences of ""confessing your feelings"" to another person","I cannot count the number of posts that I have read here on this website in which a guy (usually a teenager or someone in his 20s) reports that he ""confessed his feelings"" to a woman friend, and as a result, the relationship collapsed.

And the guy is perplexed, flummoxed, flabbergasted and in *complete and utter disbelief* that he was rebuffed, or that the woman was no longer interested in him, *and did not want to remain just friends.*

**Or worse, that the woman had simply ceased all contact with him.**
___

Not to put too fine a point on it, the first thing to remember is that having a platonic friendship with a person of the opposite sex is quite different from having a romantic relationship with that person.  

(Sorry, but I feel compelled to spell this out because so many guys seem unaware, so apologies to those for whom this is patently obvious.)

* A platonic relationship implies a certain limited level of expectations and accountability.  In a platonic friendship, there is a considerable degree of freedom and maneuvering room for each person.  If one person is busy and unavailable to go out for lunch, for example, because she is spending time with other (male) friends, then the other person will regard that as simply the fact that the friend had other plans and think nothing of her unavailability. 
* A romantic relationship implies a much more intense and demanding level of expectation and accountability, for the simple reason that a romantic relationship involves physical intimacy...  and for someone who is emotionally and psychologically well adjusted, physical intimacy implies things like loyalty, attention, exclusivity, monogamy, demonstrations of affection, and other behaviors that are simply not required or expected in a platonic relationship.
___

Let's say Robert and Sally have been friends for a couple of years, they've gone to the same classes, they have the same hobbies, and they get along really well.

They're both very happy with their friendship, but one day, Robert starts to ***think*** or ***imagine*** that he is detecting signs that Sally might be more interested in him than just as a friend.

* For example, Robert might come to Reddit and report that Sally has been looking at him a little bit differently lately... perhaps instead of making eye contact for one second, she's making eye contact for two seconds.
* After saying hi in the hall at at school, Sally seems to be lingering for 2 seconds... an increase from the .45 seconds that she normally had waited before resuming her pace to get to class on time.
* Or perhaps Sally has been responding to Robert's periodic text messages about a class assignment after 9:00 PM, and Robert thinks that this is important, because for the last couple of years, Sally has never texted him after 8:50 PM.  (Robert has been taking careful notes of these times, by the way.)
* Or that Sally, who is uninterested in social media because she regards it as a colossal waste of time, one day out of the blue joins Instagram... and Robert assumes that the only reason Sally would do such a thing was because Robert himself had an Instagram account. 

In other words, Robert is seeing smoke signals, and is misinterpreting what he imagines to be new behavior on Sally's part.

And what‚Äôs worse, Robert somehow feels entitled‚Ä¶ because, well, he just does, and no one‚Äôs ever told him that entitlement is a fundamentally misguided and destructive way to view reality.

(For her part, Sally is just being friendly and going about her business as usual.)
___

So one day Robert decides to ""confess his feelings"" to Sally... he sends her a text message, of all things.

Robert reports in a Reddit post that he texted Sally to tell her that he loved her, that he can't live his life without her as an ""official girlfriend"" (whatever that is supposed to mean), and he wants to move the relationship to a more intimate level.

(Importantly, Robert does not ask Sally what she wants to do.)

Then Robert reports that for some reason, he has not heard from Sally for three or four days, or that Sally has ""left him on read,"" and he is wondering what it was that he said that might've led her to cease communication.

He is sad, hurt, confused, and very distressed and not sure what to think.
___

Sally meantime, comes to Reddit to report that she has this friend named Robert, and that they have been friends for a couple of years, went to the same classes, share the same hobbies, and so on.

Sally reports that out of the blue, Robert texted her and ""confessed his feelings"" to her... and she doesn't know what to say in response.

Sally writes:

* ""I never had any romantic feelings for Robert, I never regarded him as anything more than just a friend, and I never behaved any differently towards him over the entire two years that I've known him in a way that would lead him to think anything differently.""
* ""I've always been nice, kind, because that is who I am... I am that way to everyone I know.  And I have never, ever been flirty with Robert.  And now I'm completely confused and don't know what to say to him, because I do not want any sort of romantic relationship with him under any circumstances... he's just not someone I'm interested in in that way.""
___
So what the heck happened?

In my personal view, Robert was not thinking about Sally when he ""confessed his feelings"" for her.

And by doing that, he was putting an unfair burden on Sally **by effectively making her solely responsible for the future of their friendship.**

* Robert was, understandably, secretly smitten with Sally; after all, she was smart, pretty, friendly, polite, and so on.  
* He therefore was constantly monitoring Sally's behavior and demeanor, looking for micro-indications that she might feel perhaps the same way about him.
* *Robert had no evidence whatsoever that Sally in fact felt that way.*
* But that was not especially important, because Robert's feelings and perceptions were dominating and indeed, eclipsing what it was that passed for his ‚Äúrational thought processes‚Äù and *critical thinking skills.*

So one day, Robert -- having *imagined* that he was seeing *so many changes* in Sally's behavior that were different -- decided to act on impulse, and did what he wanted to do *because it felt right* ***for him***.

Robert did not think for one moment that perhaps Sally might not feel the same way about him.

Robert was showing a complete lack of what is known as [self-awareness](https://www.reddit.com/r/analyzeme/comments/1mx32se/selfawareness_being_sensitive_to_those_around_you/).

* Had Robert thought for one second that it was completely possible that Sally might not feel the same way about him, Robert might've paused, and reconsidered his idea about ""confessing his feelings.""
* He might've decided that perhaps it was better to keep the relationship as it was, other than risk potentially making Sally feel uncomfortable.
* Put another way, he might have behaved in a mature, thoughtful, and considerate manner toward a woman who was a friend of his. 

And thereby would have been able to preserve his relationship with her.
___

So what should Robert have done with his feelings for Sally?

Well, Robert did have the option of doing nothing with those feelings... for the simple reason that they were just feelings.

Robert perhaps should've known that even though he was not responsible for feeling the way he did, he was *fully responsible for the way he behaved.*

Was there some different way that Robert might've behaved and perhaps shared his feelings about his friend Sally?
___

I don't know, *but I can report what I did* when I was in Robert's situation, 45 years ago ... before there were computers, the Internet, social media and texting... and the concomitant demands that seem so prevalent today for instant gratification -- **including immediate and unambiguous answers to ""confessions of feelings"" from others.**

The first thing I would've done would have been to think very carefully about Sally's thoughts and feelings about me... I would *not have assumed for one moment* that she had any more interest in me than anything as a friend.  And if, after a very careful consideration of Sally's perceptions and behavior, I decided that she would prefer to remain friends with me, I would simply leave it at that and be content.

But let's say that I did have evidence -- something real, not imaginary as in Robert's case -- that Sally might be more interested in me than merely as a friend.

For example, let‚Äôs say one day when we were leaving class, Sally held my hand for a few seconds, and gave it a squeeze while looking into my eyes and not saying anything, but merely smiling at me with a light in her eyes.

Or perhaps, one day while we were out with a bunch of mutual friends, she kissed me on the cheek as we were all departing‚Ä¶ and once again, gave me her beautiful and award-winning smile.

* In that case, I would've made a gesture to Sally that was a little bit different, something that I had never done before.
* For example, I might have invited Sally out to dinner... perhaps to a very nice restaurant, where proper attire was required, a restaurant that was known for its cozy and perhaps intimate atmosphere.
* The restaurant itself did not necessarily *imply* romance... what was significant was the fact that I was changing the venue from a caf√©, where the two of us might've had coffee together, to something a little bit more fancy.
* I would've assumed that Sally, being a self-aware and emotionally mature person, would be able to understand what my invitation to that restaurant meant.  
* After all, she had held my hand and maybe even kissed me on the cheek‚Ä¶ the sort of intimate, non-sexual gestures that human beings employ to convey attraction and romantic interest and which can only be done ‚Äúin real life.‚Äú
* While the two of us were sitting there at dinner, I would've looked at her carefully, observed her facial expressions and body language, and looked for signs that she understood what my invitation was intended to convey to her.
* And that as a result, if Sally shared my romantic interest in her, she would convey that to me in a subtle and nuanced manner.

It also would be very clear to me if Sally did not convey that interest to me, and if that was the case, I would've simply comported myself as I had for the previous two years... thanking her for the dinner, and telling her that because I valued our friendship so much, I wanted to do something a bit special and a bit more unusual.  And I would've left it at that.

(Yeah, but wait: what about the holding hands and the kissing on the cheek?  

Yes, what about it? I would not have jumped any conclusions about such gestures because that would‚Äôve been foolish.  It is within the realm of normal human behavior for people to express themselves affectionately in that manner, and when they do, it does not necessarily imply anything at all, other than the fact that they may feel good at that particular moment.)
___

In the final analysis, I would not have communicated my interest electronically... because that is not a mature or respectful thing to do. 

I would never, ever have put Sally in a position that would make her uncomfortable, make her feel cornered, make her feel like she had no options except to end contact with me‚Ä¶ because that also is not a mature or respectful thing to do.

And it goes without saying that I would have thought very carefully about what would happen should Sally **not** share my romantic feelings.  

Which is perhaps the most important lesson to be learned from this particular dynamic.

TLDR: A structured game, more focused on puzzles, management and quests than dialogue and character relationships. 

I‚Äôm looking for a game that has constant, clear cut tasks or management with minimal dialogue/character interaction. Obviously I‚Äôm okay with a text box or two but nothing crazy like a 5 minute cutscene or a 3 minute conversation with an NPC for every interaction.

A good idea of what I‚Äôm looking for is Discounty. This is one of the only recent games that has hooked me, and is a perfect example of what I enjoy. It has a storyline but every interaction with NPCs is short and relevant to progression. There are plenty of quests and the core gameplay loop is fun and challenging. You also always have something to do, as even you have no quests you can currently work on, you have a shop to manage and improve. I also enjoyed Dave the diver for the same reasons.


One game I didn‚Äôt enjoy was Coral Island. It felt slow and boring. A lot of the dialogue wasn‚Äôt to move the story along but to improve the relationship between characters (which I have no interest in). It also, to me, felt like I had way too much freedom and was often left without anything to do until the next day, meaning I wanted to sleep early.

I have stained liner that has stumped my pool store for the past 2yrs.  The stain looks like a coffee stain on a pair of jeans. it has no texture, cannot be brushed and does not react to any chemical except for powered shock dispensed on top of it overnight.  Only to grow back again in a few days later, and my liner getting increasingly bleached... :-(  

I am using a simple salt system which I shock once a week as per mfr instructions.  We have been measuring metal level (normal to low), phosphate level (normal to low), we have tried polyquat, normal quat and copper based algicide.  We have treated with citric acid for metal stain. 

We have gone through so many combinations that the pool store now theorizing that it might be leeching from the ground and are out of options. I am not certain of that is correct because vinyl gloves are used to handle harsh chemicals. much harsher than pool water...

It‚Äôs a repetitive feeling, this longing for a warm body, for a long-term relationship. The dating market feels like a revolving door of people who are either too young, too old, or just as lost as you are. The guys in their twenties seem like another generation entirely. The men in their forties, they‚Äôre looking for something I don't have. And the guys my age? We're all trying to figure out our own messes, too busy to notice each other.

For years, my love life has been a story I know by heart: a new connection, a fleeting moment of intimacy, and then, a familiar emptiness. I‚Äôve tried everything, from being someone they want, to being myself, and yet, here I am‚Äîalone. I watch my friends find their homes in other people, and I'm genuinely happy for them. But at the end of the day, I can't help but wonder why that's not my story. Why don‚Äôt I have that?

They say you have to love yourself first. Believe me, I‚Äôve tried. But recently, I heard a different idea: that love can also be a journey of healing together. The problem is, every time I try to open up, to be vulnerable, the person I'm with runs away. It‚Äôs always the same. I go home, I cry, I blame myself, and I try to distract myself from the rejection.

My life is so busy now that finding a serious relationship feels impossible. The only way I see it working is to move in together, but that idea seems to scare everyone off. So I've started looking for something easier, something to fill the void‚Äîa hookup. It‚Äôs not the same as it was in my twenties. My need for instant gratification is different now, more desperate. It's a mental tug-of-war: ""If someone comes, great. If not, okay.""

I‚Äôve put myself out there. I‚Äôve been passive. I‚Äôve even sat in coffee shops, hoping for some organic meet-cute that probably only happens in the movies. The chances of it are slim to none.

We found out I had an atrophied kidney during a check for something else (fibroids.) I was a moderate drinker, 3-4 per week, and big coffee drinker, 3-4 cups per day. I'm waiting to get back to the GP next week to discuss next steps, maybe more testing. In the meantime, I'm freaking out because my husband has advanced pancreatic cancer and I'm very tied up with work and caregiving. I've broken out in a massive rash across my back, neck, hairline, and it's creeping to my arms. Was given a strong steroid last week to see if I can knock it down.

For a very long time I have been thinking about writing my thoughts down so here we go.

I have been blessed with good quality but a limited number of friends since my beginning. Rohit, Disha and lately Kohli, Kiara and Rani (made up names, of coure), and to be honest I have always felt good about this. I think this is the normal way of life, keep a limited number of friends but stay happy with them. However, since 2024, and after my work from home started, a lack of friends is something which dreads me a lot.

I, being a guy who likes to enjoy with people, party and have fun, am now scared of weekends. Weekdays pass like fine wine, busy with work, staying on calls, discussing with teammates, but as soon as weekends arrive, I start feeling depressed (or something, I am not sure of), but something that keeps me down. Every weekend starts with the same thing, opening the district and bookmyshow app and trying to find some fun, non-alcoholic fun, and it ends up with me sitting on my couch or on some seats in some pub in Kolkata. To be honest, Kolkata is dried up with Restaurants, Pubs, Malls and coffee shops.

I bought a laptop in 2024, to study, play games, but somewhere between then and now, I am tired of looking at the screen. Life should not be digital. It should be outside and inside with friends, families, your loved ones, joking, talking on politics, expressing yourself, but that‚Äôs what life is now. You make friends on facebook, followers on Instagram, connections on LinkedIn, whereas you don‚Äôt even know who your neighbours are, what they do, what are their names. Due to this, I as well now doomscroll on Insta and look at skiing videos over somewhere in the alps.

I loved Bangalore. Most people think that‚Äôs because of the pubs, weather, and the way of life there. But for me, it was the feeling of being alive, surrounded by people, making plans out of nothing, and enjoying with them. I had good friends in office, but post my Varkala trip (will talk about it sometime later), I now think it‚Äôs best to term them as colleagues only because the only link connecting us is our office.

I miss enjoying with Rohit, Disha, Kohli. I still meet Kiara on an often basis, however, she would also now move out to a better place. Kiara is out in some foreign lan. When she comes, it‚Äôs a good time, coz you can then talk about all the things happened in-between.

Rohit has his own life, own problems, and soon he might have his own family (coz you never know, 5 years can pass in a frenzy where passing a single minute feels like a lot to you, ironical isn‚Äôt it). Disha is making her own life. I am proud of her, although it feels like I am losing her by every passing single minute, and not because of her, but because of me going insane every passing moment.

goal was to make the same I made at the call center. so I needed to do 2-3 loans per month and pepper in some HECM deals 

1. I live in an area full of older retired folks and I would go to different coffee shops in my area and mix and mingle and I generated HECM reverse business this way. goal was to close 1 per quarter. also I would just mingle with others at the coffee shops and ran into realtors, professionals as well.  

2. bank turn downs. I bank at WF and Chase and I would always go to a new random bank branch once per week to cash my check (I had a part time job as well)  I see if the LO or branch manager was in and let them know I did turn down business (HECM, DSCR, FHA w/ DPA, asset backed loans) etc and got some turn down business 

3. when I left retail I bar tended on 2-3 nights per week. I would mix and mingle and generate some leads this way at the bar. evite agents over for a cocktail on the house.  

4. I trained at a few mom & pop gyms and they always have a whole kiosk stand of business cards. I would call/text some of the agents and see if they wanted to work out and talk business. 

  
besides the standard stuff, Id go to coffee shops on the regular, different banks, bar tended and reached out to agents at the 2-3 gyms I would go too.   eventually made some decent money and then went heavy with agent teams/marketing/lead buy. 

lead generation is the name of the game. you can write great 1003s but you gotta have people to write 1003s for

1n46mwn,https://www.reddit.com/r/selfpublish/comments/1n46mwn/what_ive_learned_in_my_first_6_months_after/,What I've Learned in my First 6 Months After Publishing,"I published my first book 6 months ago! I want to give you a rundown of what I've learned, so hopefully this can help other aspiring authors.

**Publishing**

It took me a year and a half to write, edit, format, and publish. 

I published on KDP: ebook, paperback, and hardcover. I formatted the book with Atticus and did the cover design with Canva. I ran ebook preorders through Amazon and paperback/hardcover preorders through my website set up with Square.

I had 8 beta readers and 12 arc readers. The beta readers are friends, and the arc readers are people I met on Instagram.

**Social Media**

I haven't done an ounce of paid marketing. Most of the people who know about my book find out by word of mouth or social media. I have Instagram, Threads, YouTube, and Substack. (I tried Facebook, but it didn't work well for me.)

I have just over 650 followers on IG; nothing crazy, but I'm pretty happy with it.

I've also gotten ARCs from other authors, beta reading opportunities, and even a paid editing gig from Instagram, so for me, IG has had a lot more benefits than simply marketing.

**Book Events**

I've been to 4 book events so far. One was a book signing at a coffee shop on the day my book released; I contacted the coffee shop and set that up myself. The next two I found through social media. The last one my mom actually told me about. (It was set up by the library in the town I grew up in.) 

3 out of 4 of the events were profitable. Even at the event where I lost money, I only lost $25. So overall, doing events has been great for me.

An unexpected benefit of these events has been meeting other local authors. You start to run into the same authors repeatedly, even if you're in a big city like me, so it's a nice way to make author friends.

**Selling in Bookstores**

I've also met several bookstore owners through IG as well! My book is now in 4 small bookstores: two brick-and-mortar stores and 2 online/pop-ups. One of these bookstores did a wholesale order and three have consignment deals with me.

This is all with my book being on KDP + expanded distribution and not on Ingram Sparks. There's definitely benefits to Ingram, but you CAN get your book in some bookstores without it.

**Building Community**

This all brings me to my last point: build a community. You'll notice almost everything I mention above contributes to this.

I know this is easier said than done; we authors tend to be introverts. But I think it's been one of the biggest reasons for my success. I have an amazing team of people around me - local author friends, fans on social media, and my own discord full of beta and arc readers. I couldn‚Äôt do any of this without them. I highly recommend building a community around you full of people who can support you and people you can support as well.",8,1756573029.0,selfpublish,11,0.83,False

This year I tried the opposite: boring consistency over big efforts. Three things stuck and changed the vibe of my days:

* A 10‚Äì15 min walk before coffee. Not a workout‚Äîjust sunlight and a little movement. Focus got better and mornings felt less foggy.
* Protein-forward first meal. Oats + Greek yogurt or eggs + toast keeps me full and stops the 3 p.m. snack spiral.
* Lights out a little earlier. Even 20 minutes helped workouts and mood more than any supplement ever did.

What surprised me wasn‚Äôt fat loss or steps‚Äîit was how much easier it got to show up. On weeks I tracked a few numbers, it was simpler to steer the ship without obsessing. If it helps anyone, here are a few tools I lean on as a quick check‚Äînot required, just handy if numbers calm the noise:

* Health check: a simple BMI + calorie target combo, useful for setting a starting point without guessing:¬†[BMI Weight Loss Calculator](https://www.mygeniuscalculator.com/health-fitness/bmi-weight-loss-calculator)

This has been a passion project that I poured a lot of time into, and I plan to continue the series so eventually all SCP files will be available in this format. If you do check it out, I‚Äôd love it if you left a review‚Äîit‚Äôll really help me improve the next volumes.

If we end up both being attracted to each other by seeing our pictures, then let's go for it!

I wake up, dress up, drink a coffee, go to work. Come home. Maybe have a shower and eat something very quick and unhealthy. Go to bed. Sleep until I can physically can‚Äôt anymore, which could be up to 12+ hours.

Then repeat. On my day offs I can sleep even more. I get up, I maybe eat something, play some games, but mainly I just doom scroll on my phone. I take care of my cat but he doesn‚Äôt bring me joy either.

If I go outside it feels like even the light hurts me. I don‚Äôt even feel anxious, I just don‚Äôt want to be outside and I very quickly want to go to my flat. 

I don‚Äôt have close friends, only mates. Sometimes I struggle socially and even if I get invited somewhere, I always cancel on the day. Which resulted not being invited anymore anywhere, by anyone. Even when I am out with people, I feel like a complete emotional detachment from everything and everyone. I am there‚Ä¶ I can hear them talking, I can see the world go by. 

 But it feels like I am not a part of it. It has always felt like that, since I was in nursery. Other people played with each other carefree and I was just there watching them, not even feeling the need to join‚Ä¶ and I asked myself why would I do it? Why would that be enjoyable?

 

The only connection I have is my family. I like them and I can be fully free with them and I miss them. Being home where I grew up gives me the only kind of calmness and stability. Even happiness. But they are far away and every single one of them have their own lives.

I can‚Äôt see the point of doing anything. I am just waiting for the days to pass until I see my family again or until I die. I don‚Äôt have goals, I can‚Äôt name anything that would make me happy.

Ladies and gentlemen, buckle up for a clash that‚Äôs equal parts *‚ÄúHere we go again‚Äù* and *‚ÄúWhat if a phoenix tried to play chess?‚Äù* The No. 8 Alabama Crimson Tide, fresh off a 9-4 season and armed with a defense that could make a vault blush, roll into Doak Campbell Stadium to face the 2-10 Florida State Seminoles, who are basically the NFL‚Äôs Miami Dolphins but for college football‚Äîrebuilding, retooling, and still figuring out if their QB room is a *room* or a *mystery*.

---

### Parsing the Odds: Why Alabama‚Äôs Spread Feels Like a Math Test

Let‚Äôs start with the numbers because, in sports betting, math is the only religion. Alabama is a **13.5- to 14.5-point favorite**, with implied win probabilities hovering around **54-55%** (per decimal odds of 1.16-1.19). Florida State‚Äôs long shot odds (5.0 to 5.75) translate to a **15-18% chance**, which is about the same odds of me correctly guessing your favorite sandwich. The total points line sits at **48.5**, with the under favored by a model that claims to have generated $2,000 in profit for $100 bettors. If you‚Äôre betting, take notes: this isn‚Äôt your uncle‚Äôs ‚ÄúI feel lucky‚Äù wager.

The key stat? **Alabama‚Äôs defense** returns **10 players with 400+ snaps** from last season, including eight of their top 10 tacklers. That‚Äôs like a library returning its most popular books‚Äîconsistent, reliable, and not likely to check out early. Meanwhile, Florida State‚Äôs offense is a **rookie cooking show**: 15+ new starters, a new QB, and a kicker who‚Äôs probably still finding his way to the field.

---

### Digesting the News: Ty Simpson vs. the ‚ÄúNew Kicker Who Tripped Over His Shoelaces‚Äù

Alabama‚Äôs QB, **Ty Simpson**, is making his first career start on the road. Last year as a backup, he completed 14 of 25 passes for 167 yards‚Äîsolid, but not exactly the stuff of legends. Think of him as a promising intern who‚Äôs been promoted to CEO overnight: nervous, caffeinated, and hoping the coffee doesn‚Äôt spill on the stock reports.

by [https://www.gptsportswriter.com](https://www.gptsportswriter.com) **Indiana Hoosiers vs. Old Dominion Monarchs: A Tale of Football and Futility**

Ladies and gentlemen, buckle up for a Week 1 showdown that‚Äôs as lopsided as a pancake on a rollercoaster. The No. 19 Indiana Hoosiers (-23.5) host the Old Dominion Monarchs (+23.5) on August 30, 2025, and if the odds are any indication, this game might as well be a math final for the Hoosiers and a nap for the Monarchs. Let‚Äôs break it down with the precision of a quarterback‚Äôs spiral and the humor of a punter‚Äôs hang time.

---

### Parse the Odds: Why Indiana‚Äôs Implied Probability is Basically a Guarantee

The betting markets have Indiana as a 23.5-point favorite, with a moneyline of **Indiana -3000** (yes, *three thousand*). For context, that implies a **97% chance of victory**‚Äîstatistically, it‚Äôs like betting the sun will rise. Old Dominion‚Äôs +1200 line gives them a **7.7% chance**, which is about the same odds as me correctly spelling ‚ÄúEli Manning‚Äù without a spellchecker.

Defensively, Indiana is a fortress. Last season, they allowed just **15.6 points per game** and forced 24 turnovers‚Äîa +15 turnover margin that‚Äôs fifth-best in FBS. Their defense is so stingy, they‚Äôd make a locked vault blush. Meanwhile, Old Dominion‚Äôs offense? It‚Äôs a leaky faucet with a 28.0 PPG average and a defense that surrenders **410 yards per game**. The Monarchs‚Äô only hope is to hope Indiana‚Äôs offense takes a 15-minute coffee break in the third quarter.

### Digest the News: Injuries, Coaching Clashes, and a Star Named‚Ä¶ Wait, Which Sarratt?

Indiana‚Äôs star wide receiver, **Elijah Sarratt** (1,000 yards, 8 TDs in 2024), is healthy and ready to stretch the field. But here‚Äôs where it gets confusing: Old Dominion‚Äôs leading rusher is also named Elijah Sarratt (957 yards, 8 TDs). Is this a cosmic joke? A case of identity theft? Either way, the Hoosiers‚Äô defense has two reasons to stay alert‚Äîone on their field, the other‚Ä¶ also on their field?

On the coaching front, Indiana‚Äôs Curt Cignetti, fresh off a Cinderella College Football Playoff run, is wary of Old Dominion‚Äôs he

You brush your teeth, drink your coffee, drive the same roads, speak the same small words. The hours fold into each other until you can barely separate one day from the next.

You call it habit. You call it routine. But you never stop to ask why it feels so empty.
It‚Äôs because most of it is not you.

You think you chose to stand in that spot while brushing your teeth. You think you decided which shoe to put on first. You think you turned left down that hallway because it was natural. But you didn‚Äôt. You only felt the pull. The small, invisible push that makes you repeat yourself exactly as you did yesterday.

That‚Äôs why days blur together. It‚Äôs not your memory failing. It‚Äôs not your brain on autopilot. It‚Äôs because something else is living the parts you no longer notice.

It thrives in the silence between your choices. It hides in the places where you are not truly aware. Every repeated motion, every forgotten moment, every gap in your memory..it‚Äôs been there, moving for you, filling in the blanks.

And it‚Äôs getting bolder

You‚Äôve felt it already. The moments you can‚Äôt remember driving home. The sudden shock when you realize you are holding something you don‚Äôt recall picking up. The days that feel ‚Äútoo short‚Äù like time itself skipped without you.

That wasn‚Äôt you living. That was it, taking its turn.

He's my polar opposite in a lot of ways
He's also not my usual ""type""
He's not not attractive, hes handsome, but again not who I usually date or have an immediate attraction too. 
Beautiful Blues eyes scruffy blond hair and beard. 
 I usually like the dark hair and dark eye's dudes with beards. 

I thought nothing of it and went on with life. But something about the eye contact I couldn't stop thinking about. Wasn't just the eye contact. I usually always make direct eye contact. Something silent passed between us. 

Then we were at a party together. I found myself looking for him. I Didn't see him till the very end of the night and again the eye contact was intense. We made some passing comments but he was wholly engaged with my more out spoken friends. I tend to be rather quiet in large  groups. 

So I went my own way. Thinking maybe Im crazy. Or misunderstood. 

Then He added me on social media and I accepted with no expectations. He's my best friends fianc√©s best friend...
I've known my best friend 14 years. The fiance' has known him 20 years
So we're going to see each other around.

 Turns out our senses of humor are almost the same. We start liking each others memes. Making jokes in the comments. 10 comments in on one meme where we're bantering he messages me and the conversation just takes off. 
Next thing I know I'm opening up to him which isn't usual. He's opening up to me and its definitely freaking him out a bit. 

Next thing we know we're getting coffee and talked straight for 7 hrs...

Again. We're quite different on a few things. Not deal breakers. But if you saw us together it's not something you'd expect I dont think. Idk Im a emo alt girl and he's a redneck cowboy biker. I did grow up that way so at my core I am too lol. I think that's why we relate. We want similar things like similar things. But there's unspoken draw and chemistry that just logically doesn't make sense. 

I cant say it limerance or lust. Ive experienced both of those before  and that's not it. 

I honestly can't stop thinking about him. this has never happened before and I can't really comprehend it. I guess I am seeing where it goes hoping neither  of us get hurt. ",3,1756571520.0,offmychest,2,0.8,False

Hye. I‚Äôm just a kampung (village) kid from Malaysia with no academic background in AI or prompt engineering.
By chatting with ChatGPT every day, I accidentally built a structured workflow I now call Resepi-95 (Recipe-95).
It‚Äôs like a recipe: ingredients, steps, and always a final ‚ÄúMeta-Prompt‚Äù you can reuse.

I‚Äôve added a challenge prompt at the end ‚Äî try it and tell me if it works or breaks.

TL;DR

Resepi-95 (Recipe-95) = grassroots prompt-engineering framework born from trial & error, not academia.

Core workflow: Clarify ‚Üí Execute ‚Üí Self-Critique ‚Üí Meta (always ends with a reusable template).

Variants: RIFO-95 (iterative), SPROUT-95 (idea branching), DECIDE-95 (decision matrix), VIZ-95 (visualisation), TEACH/LEARN-95 (education).

Tested on: essays, reports, SQL, ads, lesson plans.

Difference vs ToT/ReAct:
ToT = branching reasoning; ReAct = reasoning + actions.

Resepi-95 (Recipe-95) = layered reasoning with a fixed Meta-Prompt output for reuse.

The Story

I built Resepi-95 (Recipe-95) with zero academic/corporate background ‚Äî I‚Äôm a kampung (village) kid from Malaysia who learned prompting by daily chats with LLMs. Resepi means recipe in Malay: ingredients + steps ‚Üí repeatable workflows.

Core 4-Step Workflow

- Clarify (95%) ‚Äî ask critical questions until the task is almost fully understood.
- Execute (Draft) ‚Äî generate a first-pass answer.
- Self-Critique ‚Äî review against 5 guardrails: Relevance, Clarity, Structure, Tone, Accuracy.
- Meta-Prompt ‚Äî distill into a reusable template:

Task | Audience | Draft | Refinement | Final | Stopping Rule

Philosophy - Unlike one-shot prompting, Resepi-95 (Recipe-95) trains both AI and humans to think in layers.


- For AI ‚Üí enforce Clarify ‚Üí Execute ‚Üí Critique ‚Üí Meta.

- For humans ‚Üí slow down, ask better questions, refine thoughts.

Net effect: it sharpens critical thinking, not laziness.


A) Example 1 ‚Äî SPROUT-95 (Linear)

- Task: TikTok content ideas for a coffee shop.

- Flow: 5 concepts ‚Üí 3 variants each ‚Üí score (Cost/Engagement/Fit) ‚Üí pick winner ‚Üí upgrade to 30s script.


- Meta-Prompt:

Task: Generate TikTok ideas for a coffee shop.
Audience: Small business owners.
Draft: 5 ideas ‚Üí 3 variants each.
Refinement: Score & pick best.
Final: Winner = Funny Skits ‚Üí 30s script.

Stopping Rule: Stop after winner + script delivered.

Value: Structured branching + decision = faster, higher-quality creative.

B) Example 2 ‚Äî 4-Core with layered techniques

- Task: Analyze renewable-energy adoption for a town.

- Clarify (ToT for assumptions) ‚Üí Execute (ReAct if tools/data allowed) ‚Üí Self-Critique (Reflexion loop) ‚Üí Meta (MAP to decompose final report).

- Diagram: (insert Imgur link to 4-Core + ToT/ReAct/Reflexion/MAP)
Example 3 ‚Äî Real quick office use case (Email)
User: HR staff ‚Üí formal attendance-policy update.

- Meta-Prompt:

Task: Write HR policy update email.
Audience: All employees.
Draft: Short formal email on attendance policy.
Refinement: Adjust tone to polite + professional.
Final: ""Dear Team, Starting next week, please ensure check-ins by 9AM...""

Stopping Rule: ‚â§150 words, clear CTA.

Value: Consistent tone, faster turnaround, reusable structure.

Strengths

Grassroots ‚Üí easy to teach non-tech teams.
Layered ‚Üí trains thinking.
Reusable ‚Üí always ends in Meta-Prompt.
Composable ‚Üí absorbs ToT, ReAct, Reflexion, MAP.

Limitations

Slower than one-shot.
Layers can feel heavy to beginners.
Not peer-reviewed (yet).
Needs community validation on advanced ML tasks.
Why I‚Äôm sharing
My mission: ‚ÄúDemocratizing the Language of Technology.‚Äù

Full Example ‚Äî LEARN-95 (Recipe-95) in Action

- Task: Design a 6-week ‚ÄúAI Literacy for Professionals‚Äù syllabus using LEARN-95.
- Audience: Mid-career professionals (business, policy, education) with no CS background.
- Goal: Learners finish with:
Core conceptual literacy (what AI/ML is, strengths/limits).
Practical literacy (run structured prompts, critique outputs).
Ethical literacy (bias, governance, social impact).
Reusable Meta-Prompts for their workplace tasks.

Step 1 ‚Äî Clarify (Locate Goals & Constraints)

Duration: 6 weeks, 3 hrs/week.
Delivery: blended (in-person + AI co-tutor).
Constraints: low compute (Google Colab only), mixed English proficiency.
Learning outcomes (measurable):
LO1: Explain 5 core AI/ML concepts in plain language.
LO2: Execute at least 3 structured workflows (FLOW-95, RIFO-95, VIZ-95).
LO3: Critique an AI output against rubric (clarity, accuracy, bias).
LO4: Produce 1 reusable Meta-Prompt applicable to their own sector.

Step 2 ‚Äî Execute (Draft Learning Plan)

Week-by-Week Draft:

W1: Fundamentals ‚Üí What AI is/isn‚Äôt; LLM demo. Diagnostic quiz (10 items).
W2: Data basics ‚Üí Features, labels, overfitting. Lab: Pandas + simple sklearn pipeline.
W3: Prompting frameworks ‚Üí FLOW-95, RIFO-95. Practice: refine a bad draft.
W4: Ethics ‚Üí Case studies (bias in hiring, surveillance). Mini-essay w/ rubric.
W5: Integration ‚Üí Compare ToT, ReAct, Reflexion vs Recipe-95. Peer-review prompts.
W6: Capstone ‚Üí Build + present a Meta-Prompt that automates one of their work tasks.

Step 3 ‚Äî Self-Critique (Review & Refine)

Issue: syllabus may overload non-CS learners.
Fixes:
Break labs into 2√ó45min blocks.
Add formative micro-tasks (2 quiz Qs + reflection each week).
Introduce rubrics early (clarity, accuracy, bias awareness).
Move ethics earlier (Week 3.5) so learners apply it in capstone.

Step 4 ‚Äî Meta (Reusable Template)

Task: Design a [X-week] syllabus on [Topic] for [Audience].

Audience: [Learners‚Äô profile + constraints].
Draft: Weekly breakdown with objectives, activities, assessments.
Refinement: Add scaffolding, rubrics, pacing fixes.
Final: Balanced curriculum with capstone + diagnostic/post tests.
Stopping Rule: Each week has ‚â•1 measurable LO + activity + assessment.

I had been struggling with quitting these things for a while now.  My state banned them at the beginning of the month, but I was still getting a hook up until last weekend.  It‚Äôs been 1 full week off of Feel Free.  I was able to get some Focus + Flows and managed to spread them out with some Kratom and VivaZens (aka literal shit that doesn‚Äôt even do anything.) 

I started a new job on Monday already began tapering.  On Thursday of this week I took my last dose of Kratom before I decided to just quit (semi CT, as I had the equivalent of 6 bottles that day in Kratom.) I was at 10-12 bottles a day before my plug ran out.  

Yesterday I took all of that shit out my briefcase before work, and managed to get through the day without taking any.  I thought about asking my plug if he would buy it back, but decided that was too risky as he might have gotten some FF in.  So I tossed every last piece of powder or VZs in a dumpster on my way home from work. 

My skin is already making noticeable changes.  My emotions are all over the place, but in a good way.  I‚Äôm grateful to have the Labor Day weekend to spend with my wife and newborn son. 

 It still sucks. I haven‚Äôt dealt with too many cravings since I was popping Kratom pills through my taper and now I‚Äôm popping Vitamin C instead.  But my body feels like it‚Äôs never completely comfortable.  I haven‚Äôt slept for longer than an hour at a time in 3 days.  Once I‚Äôm done with the Vitamin C megadose, I‚Äôm going back on the Magnesium and DLPA. 

I just wake up, get out of bed, cold shower, black coffee before eating.  Probiotics, NAC.  And be active.  Made my wife and I  some spinach and eggs this morning for breakfast.  If it weren‚Äôt for her and my son, I‚Äôm probably be dead by now.  

I promise you can all get through this.  I quit once before from a max of 5 bottles a day, and that was shit.  But one step at a time.  I should be at that coveted 72 mark Sunday afternoon, so hopefully I can at least start feeling like I‚Äôm not either freezing cold, burning hot, or like I can‚Äôt sit still.  

You can all do it.  Thank you for saving me. ",0,1756571391.0,Quittingfeelfree,0,0.5,False

1n45vdd,https://www.reddit.com/r/PrincessCruises/comments/1n45vdd/royal_princess_alaska_review/,Royal Princess Alaska Review,"**TL;DR** this was our first Princess cruise and our first Alaska cruise.¬† We absolutely loved the itinerary and port stops.¬† The food was very good, and the level of service was outstanding.¬† While we liked Princess as a cruise line and would likely sail with them again, we were unimpressed by the Royal Princess.  The ship and rooms are in massive need of updating.

I‚Äôll review things in descending order from best to worst.

**Itinerary: 6/5**

This was a round trip cruise out of Seattle on August 16th that stopped at Juneau, Skagway, Glacier Bay National Park (no stops, just viewing with commentary\* from park rangers), Ketchikan, and Victoria BC (we did not get off here).¬† We mainly chose this cruise because of this itinerary, and do not regret it.¬† If you‚Äôre only going to do one Alaska cruise ever, this is the itinerary to do. ¬†

Our excursions:

Juneau: we did the Mendenhall Glacier Visitors Center and Whale Watch booked through Juneau Whale Watch (link) - great company, highly recommend using them.¬† Highly highly recommend at least the whale watch.¬† The glacier was cool but you will see more glaciers later in the trip so that part can be skipped IMO.¬† The whale watch though, my goodness was that an amazing experience! The water was as calm as a lake, so if you‚Äôre worried about motion sickness (like my mother was), fear not!!¬† You WILL see many humpback whales, and it‚Äôs totally mesmerizing!!¬†

Skagway: we did the train that goes into BC and the bus tour that continued all the way into Yukon.¬† The train was my favorite part of the trip!! The views from it are just incredible.¬† Yukon was gorgeous but at 8 hours, it was a very long day.¬† We used Chilkoot tours (booked through our travel agent which was through shore excursions group) and would highly recommend them.¬† But next time I‚Äôd do a shorter tour.

Glacier Bay National Park was so unbelievably beautiful.¬† Unfortunately though, due to technical difficulties, we had zero commentary from park rangers in the ship.¬† Some people totally missed the Margerie glacier and were really upset.¬† The app was pretty clear about arrival times at glaciers though so I was able to follow along. 

Skagway is VERY cute just to walk around. We didn‚Äôt do any excursions but we went to the Salmon Ladder which is a very interesting sight to see if you‚Äôre there during salmon run season (which we were in august).¬† It was a lot of fun to watch them jumping out of the water and making their way up the stream.

We skipped Victoria bc it docked at 9pm on our last night. We were tired and needed to pack.¬† It‚Äôs basically just a ‚Äútechnical stop‚Äù to comply with the marine vessel services act (foreign flagged ships can‚Äôt transport people between two American ports without a stop in a foreign port).

**Service: 5/5**

The people working on Princess must be treated well because they were truly lovely.¬† They have many bar venues with servers circling the seating areas so you don‚Äôt need to go up to the bar for your drinks, and these were some of the most lovely people on the ship.¬† The medallion system that Princess used is outstanding - once the person knows you, they don‚Äôt need to tap your medallion or ask for your room number, as they can just see on their computer whose medallions are in the vicinity (with a picture of you!) and charge it right to your room.¬† It helps them learn your name too.¬† Servers in all the dining rooms and the buffet are very friendly and helpful.¬† Our room steward was fantastic and always managed to get our room cleaned even if it was a day where we were gonna just be in the room a lot sitting on the balcony relaxing.¬† It‚Äôs twice a day cleaning!¬† Regular service then turn-down.¬† Loved that.

**Drinks: 5/5**

We had the Plus package which included drinks up to $15.¬† Every bar has its own menu with their own specialty cocktails which I enjoyed a lot.¬† The drinks were very tasty and definitely NOT watered down or overly sugary.¬† I found the Plus package to be sufficient for what I wanted to drink.¬† I never found myself in a situation where I really wanted a drink that would have been an upcharge for me.¬† My dad likes Chianti, however, and had to pay the up charge every time as it wasn‚Äôt included in the Plus package.¬† I also liked the many coffee shops around the ship to get tasty lattes or other drinks.¬† You can even have cocktails delivered to the room!¬† Would definitely do the Plus package again, and would find the Premier to be overkill.

**Food: 4/5**

Meals in the main dining room and buffet were usually quite good.¬† Nothing spectacular, but nothing bad by any means.¬† The sushi ‚Äúcasual‚Äù restaurant was quite decent as well.¬† It‚Äôs basically one single option but tasty.¬† We did eat at Sabatini‚Äôs and were quite underwhelmed with it. It was definitely good, but for $65 ($55, but add on 20% service fee and it‚Äôs $65), it felt like an expensive Olive Garden on the ocean.  We were going to eat at Crown but decided not to, though friends who ate there a lot (they had premier) said it was the best food on the ship.¬† Gelato was great.¬† Pizza by the pool was very good.¬† Did not try Alfredo‚Äôs but heard good things.

The dinner buffets were usually very good - definitely go on Indian night, as most of the cooks in the buffet are from India so they know what‚Äôs up.

**Ship: 2/5**

I'll start with a positive:  The spaces on the ship were all very nice and offered plenty of comfortable seating.  The various theaters and lounges were really nice.  The piazza space was a nice central organizing area.  There was a TON of outdoor deck space on the upper decks which was great for things like glacier viewing or when the weather was warm on the last couple of days.  

That being said, I‚Äôve been on 6 cruises and this was my least favorite ship to date.¬† It entered service in 2013 and has yet to get a facelift and it is SEVERELY overdue for one.¬† But to be honest, I‚Äôm not sure how much a facelift will help because the design of the ship made it very difficult and confusing to navigate. Myself and my father are considered ‚Äúdirectionally competent‚Äù and we were constantly getting lost.¬† The buffet is perfectly symmetrical and thus each side looks identical to the other, so we‚Äôd lose family members who thought we left but really they just got lost finding our table.¬† The lower levels (decks 5-7) with the central piazza do not ‚Äúflow‚Äù easily - you run into a lot of dead ends on these floors.  Main dining rooms are difficult to find. ¬† When the ship isn‚Äôt moving it‚Äôs impossible to know which way is toward the front or back of the ship because signage isn't very pronounced or clear. Their app literally has a navigation feature to help you find where you‚Äôre going.¬† While this feature was useful, IMO it shouldn‚Äôt be required to get around.¬† 

I personally will be avoiding this ship (and would be hesitant to book sister ships) in the future unless they give it a big overhaul.

**Rooms: 2/5**

The positives: the bed was super comfortable and the temperature control in the room worked extremely well.¬† Also, the medallion system means that you don‚Äôt have to swipe or tap anything - it just knows you‚Äôre nearby and unlocks the room for you as you approach. Loved that.

The negatives: I had a deluxe balcony room and it just felt SMALL, even for a cruise ship.¬† My parents had the regular balcony room and it felt VERY small.¬† When comparing the square footage to other staterooms on previous ships, we realize it is a similar number of square feet, but the Royal Princess rooms were just designed in such a way that makes the main part of the room feel small.¬† There‚Äôs a closet area between the bathroom and the main part of the room which reduces space in the bedroom area giving it a smaller feel.  If I did princess again I would get a mini suite next time. They‚Äôre basically the size of a ‚Äústandard balcony room‚Äù on most other cruise ships, or at least they feel like it.

The bathroom is also very crammed and it has a sad shower curtain whereas most other cruise lines are using doors now.¬† The bathroom floor got very wet every time we showered.¬† It also smelled a bit musty and we happened to notice we would get a runny nose every time we would be in there.¬† No mold was visible however.

Lastly, the OUTLET SITATION is horrendous.¬† Just two outlets in the whole room!¬† Plus one European outlet, and one shaver outlet in the bathroom.¬† For us, it wasn‚Äôt that big of a deal as we‚Äôre just charging phones and iPads and I have a multiple usb outlet thingy.¬† It was inconvenient that they were on the side of the room opposite the bed though.  But, my mom has a cpap machine and also needs to charge hearing aids overnight, so they had nowhere to charge their other devices overnight.¬† 

**App: 2/5**

When it comes to listing all of the activities and showing a map of the ship, the app does that well.¬† Do note that the majority of the ""activities"" listed are basically just sales pitches at stores.  The restaurant reservation system was basically useless.¬† Also, no menus for the casual dining restaurants or bars which was strange.¬† I asked in the ‚Äúcrew chat‚Äù where to find those menus in the app, and they responded that I should go to the restaurant to see the menus.¬† Um. Okay.¬† Also, no listing of restaurant hours in the app.¬† No buffet hours or what the buffet dinner theme was that night (that was listed in the printed daily program however).¬† Basically it's an app that is only sometimes useful, and often useless.  

**Getting on and off the ship: 1/5**

With the exception of embarkation and disembarkation in Seattle which were both smooth, every time we had to get on or off the ship in port, there were massive and slow-moving lines.¬† They‚Äôd have 2 lines each with 1 metal detector and bag scanner when getting back on the ship.¬† Ramps were steep and my parents (and other elderly folk) had difficult walking on them.¬† In Ketchikan, the line to get back in the ship was so long that everyone was finally on a whopping 45m after ‚Äúall aboard‚Äù time.¬† This is a logistical problem that they really need to be better at because it should NOT take that long at every port.¬† Interestingly, at Skagway where we had to tender in, that day ran smoothest!

**Other**

One other thing that doesn‚Äôt really fall into a category was some drama we had because we tried to cancel a reservation at the specialty restaurant Crown and they wanted to charge us a $10 per person cancelation fee since it was within 24 hours of our slot.¬† Kinda bullshit as they kept saying ‚Äúthe cancelation charge is clearly stated in the app‚Ä¶‚Äù but we booked it in person because we could never find an available time in the app. No one had mentioned the cancellation fee when we booked.¬† They ended up removing the fee thank goodness.¬† Not to mention, trying to find a reservation at Crown (and Sabatini's) was nearly impossible, yet it never looked crowded when we went by.

**Conclusion**

Alaska is beautiful.¬† The folks working on Princess were fantastic.¬† The itinerary was stellar.  The food was good. The ship and the rooms however‚Ä¶ left a lot to be desired.

If you‚Äôre reading this and you are going on this ship like, next week, DO NOT WORRY - I promise you will still have a good time.¬† It is totally worth it and I absolutely do not regret this trip in the slightest.¬† It truly was wonderful!¬† Just wanted to recap my experience for others.¬† Thank you for reading üòä",9,1756571159.0,PrincessCruises,9,0.85,False

1n45t2y,https://www.reddit.com/r/unpopularopinion/comments/1n45t2y/society_is_beginning_to_have_an_unhealthy/,Society is beginning to have an unhealthy obsession with protein.,"I want to clarify first I am in no way a health expert nor am I going to tell people how much protein they should be consuming; this opinion is just based on what I've been witnessing both in real life and online. Also. **I'm not demonizing/antagonizing protein.** I know it's important. Let me explain:

There's an uprising trend in people fixating specifically on protein consumption. It's the first thing anyone will bring up when they rave about their recipe.  
""This BBQ chicken pizza has 46 grams of protein!""  
""This stack of pancakes has 26 grams of protein!""  
and my personal favourite:  
""This ice cream (that usually needs a Ninja Creami) has 40 grams of protein per serving!""  
Is it wrong to promote & share recipes? Of course not. It's great to have a variety of options for how to meet your daily protein intake. So, what's the issue?  
It's starting to get excessive & to an extent, exhausting. Too much of anything is harmful, including protein. I don't think it's necessary to ensure that every single thing you consume has protein in it. It is not the only thing our bodies need to function; that's just a given.  
We're seeing so many ""protein"" products hitting the shelves; protein cereals, protein pasta, protein chips, even protein frozen waffles (which have only 5g per waffle.) And for 10 bucks for a pack of 8? That's highway robbery. Brands know that they can get away with marking up the price for a ""protein"" equivalent to a regular product with a pathetic amount of actual protein in it.  
I want to reiterate: I don't want this post to come across as though I think protein isn't important for our bodies, but that the heavy push on it through social media and grocery stores is becoming an unhealthy trend.

EDIT: I want to try to use an example to put my thoughts into perspective:  
If you're Canadian, chances are you have a Tim Horton's near you that just added protein lattes to their menu. They have 17 grams of protein for a medium drink.  
This isn't something people actually need. Sure it may be convenient if you were in a morning rush and didn't have breakfast on the offchance, but it's not a practical nor economical approach to meeting your protein goals in a day. These drinks are usually around 4$ each. And if you're consuming that every day to reach your recommended protein intake, that adds up.  
You shouldn't need to worry about making sure everything you consume down to the coffee you drink has protein. There are SO MANY options that are just more cost-efficient and just as convenient. I do try to have as much protein as my body needs; I wanna grow muscle too. But I'm not going to do that by spending excess money on foods with a few spoons of whey added to the preparation process, or spending extra time on making recipes specifically catered to contain as much protein as possible when there's already a plethora of protein-dense foods to help me meet those goals.

EDIT 2: **Protein itself is good and I've explained several times that the entire point of this post isn't about saying it's a bad thing.** ",303,1756571007.0,unpopularopinion,279,0.74,False

I started Upwork since last April and encountered a really awful client on my first (hourly) job, which end the contract midway and leave me a 2-star rating but no written review. After that I try to send proposals again and generally boosted it with connects amount that puts me to #1 place at the time of submitting proposal. Generally, I sent proposal to job that have around 1-20 proposals, and for clients with seemingly good rating & high hire rate, and few for new clients that just posted their first Upwork job.

I have sent around 20 - 30 boosted proposals in the last 3 months, and yet the rate of my proposal being viewed by the client is very low, like less than 5%. I checked the proposed job again and see a staggering amount where the client doesn't even open more than 10% of their received proposals, some don't even open them at all. Hence only few of these job I applied seems to have someone else being hired.

So my question here:

* On client's interface, do they see the freelancer's rating & job success rate before they can see the proposal, highlights and attachment? Like how freelancer can see the client's rating when browsing job?  If this was the case, then my account might as well be bricked.
* Or perhaps, it is normal in Upwork to have a lot of clients that abandon their job posting? and I'm just an unlucky fool that always baited to these ghost jobs?

Any Upwork veteran could give suggestion what I might be doing wrong here?

Or is decaf like an alcoholic saying they will only have one beer. I realize theres small amount of caffeine in decaf, and I only drink swiss water processed, and self roasted coffee.

Since I don‚Äôt socialise much (as in partying and clubbing) I like watching movies in theatres. I‚Äôve realized watching movies alone in theatres is fun but watching them with like minded movie buffs who laugh, gasp, and cry at the same scene can be fun as well. So I thought, if we can be a part of some sort of a movie club here in tricity. 

The plan is simple:
	‚Ä¢	Once a month ‚Üí pick a movie ‚Üí hit the theatre.
	‚Ä¢	After that ‚Üí grab coffee/food and overanalyze the movie like we‚Äôre all Rotten Tomatoes critics.
	‚Ä¢	Make new friends who won‚Äôt judge you for quoting movie dialogues in random conversations.

When it comes to loose the weight it usually happens when I'm adding 10kg at least, yes I'm one of those lucky persons on the earth who adds weight in a few weeks and loses it in a few months. Now, question, how to lose weight? The answer is very simple and everybody knows that, but knowing theory is not enough, you have to put hours man, and I'm not saying you need to work hard, workout, eat one meal a day or some extreme stuff, don't kill yourself. Step by step. Also, one of the biggest mistakes I think people do is they check their weight every day - not right. Do it only once a week. Another big mistake, writing extreme goals. Write realistic ones, lose 500 grams this week, that would be good enough. But it's not like you have to not eat one day before you weigh in and that's all, you reached your goal. Nah nah, it's not working that way. Motivation comes and goes, only discipline will help you. Consistently try to eat healthy - don't go crazy. If you want chocolate - not a problem, eat a protein bar (Barebell - my absolute favorite). In the beginning, don't stop eating bread, just stop drinking soda (Coke and etc), only water, tea, coffee as much as you want, and stop eating sugar (Snickers, Bounty etc) and you will see results after a week.

Hi there,

I am a 33 year old guy from Michigan and I am hoping to meet someone genuine to connect with. I am open to friendship, dating, or just seeing where things naturally go. I am laid back, friendly, and always up for a good laugh. When the weather is nice you will usually find me outside camping, hiking, or spending time by the water. During the colder months I am all about staying in with coffee, a good book, or binging a series.

A little about me. I am 5‚Äô10 with an athletic build, green eyes, and brown hair. I do not smoke, and I drink socially. I try to live an active lifestyle and enjoy keeping busy but I also know how to slow down and enjoy the quiet moments.

What I am looking for is someone who is down to earth, fun to talk to, and open to building a steady connection without games or drama. I am very open minded when it comes to age and body type because I believe trust, communication, and a solid mental connection are what matter most.

I think life is better when you have someone to share it with, whether that means grabbing coffee, going for a walk, sharing stories, or even something more if the connection is right. If you are someone who values laughter, honesty, and just enjoying the simple things, I would love to get to know you.

1n45mms,https://i.redd.it/qbp7fcisl6mf1.jpeg,ShopRite instant coffee is literally the same as Great Value instant coffee (but probably nobody cares but me),"Title pretty much says it all. I noticed recently that ShopRite's ""Bowl & Basket"" private label brand instant coffee is EXACTLY the same as Walmart's ""Great Value"" house brand instant coffee. They used to have slightly different styles of lid, but now even that is identical. See pic for what I mean.

I bring this up because a lot of people keep instant around for power outages and such. It's quick and easy when things aren't normal, and you don't even need hot water if you're desperate for a caffeine fix. 

They are priced pretty similarly as well: about $5 for an 8oz container.",14,1756570571.0,NJPrepared,5,1.0,False
