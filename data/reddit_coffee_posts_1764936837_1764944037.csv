Once we matched, I sent her a text saying that we should meet up for coffee, but with thanksgiving right around the corner, it went unanswered for several days. Then, out of nowhere, she texted me and asked to meet up. My response in the affirmative was delayed, but then hers was even moreso. We confirmed plans to get coffee that next weekend, but things have been virtually silent since then.

I’m new to dating, but with everyone I have dated, this behavior feels unusual. She “hates texting” and I totally understand that, but I’d like to make sure this endeavor is being taken seriously, I guess. I can’t tell if I’m overreacting or not. ",1,1764943859.0,Advice,0,1.0,False

1pew07m,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1pew07m/im_pregnant_and_suddenly_the_family_drama_is/,I’m pregnant and suddenly the family drama is aimed at me. How do I deal with my SIL?,"Hi everyone, I’m 30F and 23 weeks pregnant, and I really need some outside advice because a family situation has started affecting my stress levels. At this point I honestly just want peace during my pregnancy but I’m not sure how to handle my SIL without causing more drama.

I have two brothers. My older brother Daniel (45M) is married to my SIL Chloe (37F). My younger brother Matthew (28M) is the one I’m closest to emotionally. We grew up together, and he’s been incredibly supportive during my pregnancy.

Chloe has always been quite difficult. She gets upset very easily and tends to react quite intensely when things don’t go the way she wants. Because of this, she and Daniel have lost multiple friendships, and even some of our family members (including my sister) have gone low contact with them.

Matthew, his wife, my husband and myself all recently moved closer to Daniel to get a bigger family unit. Chloe was initially very kind, but over the past few months the old patterns have started creeping back in.

1. She reacts emotionally to very small things

Daniel and Chloe often go away for the weekend and usually invite only Chloe’s side of the family. That’s always been fine, we respect their dynamic especially because we’re new here. 

But they also frequently ask Matthew to dog-sit at the last minute. Recently he genuinely couldn’t because he had work and Chloe became upset saying she “didn’t know what to do now” and he’s “ruined their weekend” even though her request was extremely last minute.

Soon after that, Matthew and I weren’t invited to their daughter’s birthday party, even though Chloe’s siblings were.

2. She confronted Matthew’s wife aggressively

Matthew has been helping me a lot during my pregnancy. He hadn’t seen Daniel and Chloe much lately, mainly because they never initiate plans and the atmosphere had started feeling off.

Chloe then posted a passive-aggressive message in the family group chat saying she hadn’t seen Matthew in ages. So Matthew and his wife visited, but Chloe barely greeted them. She then cornered Matthew’s wife alone and accused them of not making effort and said it’s wrong that they spend so much time with me and not with them. They have only been spending more time with me because Matthew has been helping me get to medical appointments when my husband is at work. She ended up storming off to her room for the rest of the visit.

3. She completely reframed the situation to make herself the injured party

Matthew recently reached out to Daniel to clear the air.

Instead of Daniel explaining anything, Chloe sent Matthew a long message back where she claimed they hadn’t visited in 3 months (not true), and she said Matthew is being a bad uncle to her kids by not visiting enough. But she has never tried to initiate any plans with them. She ended up apologizing at the end, but she said “she’s sorry if they thought she was being passive aggressive”.

4. Now the issue has suddenly been turned onto me, and I’m blindsided

Last night, Matthew called Daniel to try talk everything out again. Instead of resolving anything, Daniel and Chloe apparently said they are also upset with me for not seeing them enough and excluding them from plans. I haven’t made any plans besides a quick coffee with Matthew and his wife when they’re here helping me. And again, they never initiate any plans with me. 

I’ve made no comments, been nothing but kind, and haven’t been involved in any of this beyond supporting my younger brother and dealing with my own pregnancy. Now I feel dragged into conflict I didn’t cause and don’t understand.

My actual question:

How do I deal with this situation? I really don’t want to lose Daniel in all of this. He’s been such a great brother to me over the years and the only time we don’t get along is due to Chloe.

So how do I protect my peace (especially while pregnant) without damaging my relationship with my brothers?

1pevzhu,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1pevzhu,"First apartment, unsure of furniture placement?","Hi everyone! New member in this subreddit. I'm moving out of my parents' house this month, and I'm still not sure about how to get the most out of the  small (compared to what I'm used to) space that I'm moving to.

I made a screenshot of the Ikea room designer, where I'll be getting most of my furniture. For now it's all just placeholders to get a feel for what I can do with the room.

* Top left that's now empty space will be my bathroom. I also have a separate locker to hang my summer/winter jackets and coats, but I do need a wardrobe in this room for my year-round clothes. For now I placed that against the wall on the right.
* Something I'm having the most trouble with is the part lowest on the top-view image. Let's call it the living room. I've tried a bunk bed with desk underneath and a separate couch, but that bed got way too big with a ladder next to it. For now I have a sofa bed that be easily switched between those two functions. Chose a small coffee table that I can put to the side for a moment when I do this. In the lower right corner is a desk with my pc. I'll use my monitor for watching movies from the couch.
* The alternative idea for this part of the room was a tv cabinet, leaving out the desk chair and getting a lap table for my keyboard and mouse, but I'm worried that I won't be able to see the screen that well when playing games or just doing some work. I also play electric guitar, and recording next to the desk will probably be more comfortable than getting wires through the living room area and playing on the couch. I can always move the chair or set it to a lower position when watching a movie.
* I do feel like I need the dining table because the coffee table won't be that comfortable for eating dinner every night, and I also want to be able to invite friends over to play board games. The table can be extended to get 2x3 people there. I'll probably keep two foldable chairs in the storage room for whenever that happens.
* Ikea didn't let me put in actual kitchen stuff, so I just used a desk, cabinet and a printer for the counter, fridge and microwave-oven. 

Am I on the right track with the placement of furniture, or am I overlooking some brilliant idea just because I've been staring at this for too long? I'd love to hear your ideas! Thank you!",1,1764943700.0,DesignMyRoom,0,1.0,False

1pevx53,https://www.reddit.com/r/hiddengeneticdiseases/comments/1pevx53/anybody_else_have_genetic_diseases_they_never/,Anybody else have genetic diseases they never knew they had till too late?,"I just read an article about chronic disease or illness fakers.  I am thoroughly disgusted that even more people are more ignorant than I thought possible beyond my immediate family.

Right before the age of 40 I passed out waiting for a table at a nice restaurant, slowly drinking a beer. Luckily I had not been a heavy, medium, or even light drinker for almost 10 years.  All I really had physically wrong with me at that time was testosterone therapy, come shoulder surgeries, and chronic,sometimes horrible pain. Oh, I was also told I had a great, really great bronze California tan.

After that incident right before age 40 I had every test I could have done to explain what happened.  Witnesses said, im 6'3 195+ lbs, I just turned white, became instantly soaking  wet, and fell straight backwards like a 2x4.

After all the tests were completed I discovered my Iron(its really called ferratin) was at a level of 3,900 (normal safe levels are 50 to 200 roughly.  I was given a genetic test for hemachromatosis,  which is pretty common, and not a super big deal when treated early.  In fact, anyone with hemachromatosis cam firmly state that we people,all people, black, while, whatever are related.  Black people have a genetic disease called sickle cell disease.  If not treated and allowed to run rampart sickle cell turns into hemachromatosis. Nuff said.

The main treatment for hemachromatosis is bloodletting, the amount of blood you need to get out of your body and how much at a time and how often is usually dictated by the level of your ferritin in your blood at time of diagnosis.  Most people, fortunately,  get detected and treated by 700 to 1500 level of Ferratin.  The body is basically killing itself, ""rusting away"" to say at levels if 1,000 plus of ferritin.

Now five leads later, testosterone implants every 3 months or so, bloodletting (phlebotomy) treatment 4 times a year now ( I started giving over 550 grams of blood 2 times a week for 4 months, and then once a week 4 or 5 months, and so on and on.  I have had a pretty extensive cervical neck surgery, cages, holes drilled in arthritic areas and nerve openings opened up, both hips totally replaced, a knee replacement on left knee coming up soon, always a pain in my ass,, literally,, lol.  There's other things, I have to get liver biopsies every year, heart tests performed every year, no alcohol, low Vtamin C diet, no more liver and onions, and reduced use of cast iron and other high iron cooking and eating utensils.

Thing is,, if you see me just see me, you'll see a big, strong, agile, balanced man.  But what you dont see is how hard it is for me to just get up and drink a cup of coffee some mornings, or how bad both legs ache, hurt, throb, and sometimes especially feel totally exhausted 2 hours after I wake up.  Or a serious neck, nerve issue that I just keep massaging and turning my head.

I don't take opiates, except after surgeries, I can't take much Tylenol or ibuprofen and related.  Mostly ice pack/machine, heat pads, hot hot bath soaks, stretching (carefully), keeping moving, and pushing myself everyday or at least 6 days a week harder than the day before.

I have half siblings, 17+ years older than me, with bone spurs, maybe knee replacement, obesity related issues, lack of movement/ exercise issues, and on and on.

I'd happily trade places with them, but keep my age, and very few people I imagine get what I'm about to say next . I decided after the first 6 months of diagnosis I was going to ""break and fall apart before I rusted and rotted away"".

Do you get that?  Understand ?  I am happy, no I get exited and thrilled inside when I see people with obvious issues, obesity, laziness, bad diet, drinking, etc struggle, not do, or unwilling to do things they should do, much less want to do to make this life more,, make this life better for themselves.  I say F' u all those ignorant dumb lazy scared people that say things, think things, act differently when they interact with you, not knowing you closely and really knowing you, when they see this person that looks, moves, and does lots of physical things better than they can,, and they think your faking or putting on or playing poor pity party me,,, no screw you guys,, try, literally walking 10,000 or more steps in my shoes each day and more, yet sometimes not able to even crawl or move for 2 or 3 hours after 4 or 5 or less some days just living life.

Anyone else have similar stories ? Or experiences?  I still can't get over the fact that had a been a normal,, or whatever you call a person who drinks a six pack a week, alcoholic drinker I would definitely for sure have had cirrhosis or liver cancer by now for sure and probably  be dead.  Anyway,, let me know thanks.

Today i even got my ""crowning"" achievement if you will - a win with crown swap. now did i have a potion belt with 2 fairies, gamblers brew and entropic brew in the heart fight? maybe, but it still was hella fun, and past me would've considered crown swap ironclad absolutely unwinnable.

I highly recommend giving boss swap a few tries if the other neow bonuses aren't great.

1pevurt,https://www.reddit.com/r/digitalnomad/comments/1pevurt/a_small_shift_in_my_routine_turned_into_a_few/,A small shift in my routine turned into a few months of living abroad,"A few months ago I didn’t really plan to change anything. Remote life sounded cool, but also distant, like something I’d maybe try someday.  
  
Then my job situation shifted a bit and I started testing some online things just to see what I could manage on the side. I wasn’t expecting anything serious, but one of the things I was learning slowly grew into a small but steady part of my monthly income.

At some point I decided to get out of my routine for a while and try living abroad. I booked a short trip, packed my laptop and ended up stretching that “short trip” into a few months. I had morning coffee in random cafes, worked a bit in co working spaces and kept dragging my backpack around different cities. It still feels strange waking up in a new place and realizing the day is mine to shape.

What surprised me most is how natural the rhythm became. Even a couple of flexible hours feel different when you set your own pace.

I’m curious how many of you started your nomad life from something small rather than a big planned career shift.

1pevtyz,https://www.reddit.com/r/SpanishAIlines/comments/1pevtyz/all_the_uses_of_más_in_spanish_essential/,All the Uses of “MÁS” in Spanish + Essential Expressions,"In this post, I broke down the main uses of the word “más” in Spanish and gave a list of common fixed expressions with it to help you boost your Spanish.

1 . “More” – quantity or intensity (with verbs, nouns or alone)

Más expresses “more” in general — more action, more quantity, or something additional.

With verbs, it means “do something more / to a greater degree”:

* Deberías descansar más. → You should rest more.

With nouns, más + noun means “more (of something) / additional”:

* Necesitamos más tiempo. → We need more time.
* Hay más gente afuera. → There are more people outside.

Alone, when the noun is obvious from context:

* ¿Quieres más? → Do you want more?

 2. More + adjective/adverb (comparative)

Más + adjective/adverb → “more / -er”.

* Ella es más alta que su hermana. → She is taller than her sister.
* Él habla más rápido que tú. → He speaks faster than you..

3 . The most (superlative) – el/la/los/las más…

With an article, el / la / los / las + más + adjective → “the most”.

* Es la más inteligente de la clase. → She is the most intelligent in the class.
* Son los más rápidos del equipo. → They are the fastest on the team.
* Esta es la canción más famosa del grupo. → This is the band’s most famous song.

4 .  Else / any more / something additional

Más often means “else / additional / any more”:

* ¿Quieres decirme algo más? → Do you want to tell me anything else?
* ¿Quién más viene? → Who else is coming?

And with no it can mean “no more / any more”:

* No puedo comer más. → I can’t eat any more.

5 .  In maths – “plus”

* Dos más dos son cuatro. → Two plus two is four.

The Ugly mug is a joke between my wife and me about my mom.  

We were at my n-mom's house for a visit, and she opined that all she had were ugly mugs.  She waved at them dismissively and said that people just kept giving her ugly mugs.  She wasn't lying.  She had a lot of ugly mugs.  

In the next breath, she exhorted us to take them, and told us that they were great mugs, and we would be lucky to have them.  We declined.  At my next trip through an airport (I was flying a lot in those days), I bought the ugliest mug I could find, image link below, and gave it to her as a gift.  My mom never got the joke, but now, as it's the only one of her ugly mugs we kept after she passed, it puts a smile on my face.  I got the ugly mug after all.

After that, I kept trying to find the same thing in Indian specialty coffee, but I usually ended up with something sour, bitter, lime-like, tangy, or just… weird. I could never find that floral + sweet combo with a slight bitterness.

Then I discovered this coffee. Ah man, what a coffee.. what a fragrance. It filled my whole room, then the house, and honestly it felt like it filled me too. I can still smell it even now, more than three hours after brewing.

I’m literally just waiting for this day to be over so I can brew it again first thing tomorrow morning.

Hope Chests, Dower Chests, Wedding Trunks, etc were a large trunk, often a cedar chest, where girls kept family treasures, linens, quilts and housewares for their future marriages or for when they would move out and get their first apartment.

Lane Cedar Chests were a traditional Sweet Sixteen or graduation present in my community. It was a place for the girl's scrapbooks and keepsakes, or her Hope Chest.

Crocheted and knitted afghans were a craft craze in the mid-70s. i still have the pink afghan my mother made for my Hope Chest when I was 11.

My grandmother taught me embroidery and cross-stitch, and I had completed and accumulated several pairs of embroidered pillowcases, a stack of potholders, appliance covers, napkins and tablecloths by the time I was an adult!

Laundry detergents and cereal boxes often contained free stuff, like glassware and towels. Breeze Detergent had a towel in each box. They were cheap, low-quality, but free and great for dish towels!

5 years na kami sa MxM relationship na ‘to—5 years na puro tago, puro iwas, puro “sige bukas na lang"" o kaya naman ""Baka Balang-Araw.""   
  
Hindi madali. Ang daming tampuhan, hirap, at moments na parang nakakasakal na hindi mo siya kayang ipagsigawan dahil takot ka sa sasabihin ng magulang, kaibigan, at ng mundo.   
  
Tapos one time, randomly habang nagttrabaho kami (nag dadate kami sa coffee shop at wearing airbuds tigisa) tumugtog yung Kapit sa random playlist ko… (random na pl literal) tindig balahibo namin sa lyrics bes, then biglang kaming natahimik tapos nagkatinginan. HAHA

Parang kinuwento nung kanta ‘yung love namin—yung takot, yung pagod, pero higit sa lahat, yung kapit namin sa isa’t isa. Umiyak kami pero in a good way.  
  
Yung tipong pagtitig namin sa isat-isa napapabuntong-hininga kami tapos.... “Konti na lang… kaya natin ‘to.”  
  
It felt comforting na kahit hindi pa ngayon, assured kaming darating din.... ‘yung araw na hindi na namin kailangang magtago. One day, masisigaw din namin ‘to. Maipagmamalaki ko rin yung pagmamahal ko sa kanya. Yung kami.   
  
Kaya sa mga closeted gays out there—kapit lang. Hindi ka nag-iisa. Darating din yung araw na kaya mo nang sabihin sa mundo, “Hindi ko siya kaibigan lang... Boyfriend ko siya.""

Hope Chests, Dower Chests, Wedding Trunks, etc were a large trunk, often a cedar chest, where girls kept family treasures, linens, quilts  and housewares for their future marriages or for when they would move out and get their first apartment.

Lane Cedar Chests were a traditional Sweet Sixteen or graduation present in my community. It was a place for the girl's scrapbooks and keepsakes, or her Hope Chest.

Crocheted and knitted afghans were a craft craze in the mid-70s. i still have the pink afghan my mother made for my Hope Chest when I was  11.

My grandmother taught me embroidery and cross-stitch, and I had completed and accumulated several pairs of embroidered pillowcases, a stack of potholders, appliance covers, napkins and tablecloths by the time I was an adult!

Laundry detergents and cereal boxes often contained free stuff, like glassware and towels. Breeze Detergent had a towel in each box. They were cheap, low-quality, but free and great for dish towels!

I got married at a much older age than my friends, but I had everything I needed except furniture when I rented my first apartment. My Dower Chest was my coffee table and a window seat for several years!",3,1764942757.0,nostalgia,1,1.0,False

1pevjoc,https://www.reddit.com/r/AIO/comments/1pevjoc/aio_for_kicking_my_aunt_out_onto_the_street_and/,AIO for kicking my aunt out onto the street and then getting mad at my family for helping her?,"I (30F) kicked my aunt (63F) out of my home with nowhere to go earlier this year and then got mad at my family for helping her. So, I’ll start from the beginning.. I grew up in a small-ish city in Ontario, Canada with my mom and my dad who separated before i even came out of my mother’s womb. I lived with my mom for most of my life but I moved in with my dad and my step-mom when I was 13 due to issues I was having with my mom and lack of proper guidance in the home (I was missing a lot of school and would pretty much be allowed to do whatever O wanted). Living with my dad and step-mom was nice but that’s not really relevant to the story. So my dad has 2 siblings, a brother and a sister, who I barely know. I haven’t seen my uncle since I was around 7 years old and I grew up only seeing my aunt just one handful of times in the span of 15 years and then saw her a little more frequently as I grew into a young adult. This is because she lived in Toronto, Ontario.. which is 2.5 hours from where I live and she doesn’t drive and regular visits just weren’t a thing while I was growing up, so with all this being said I’ve never really known her..

In February of 2018, I had my first baby, a son and my aunt was still living in Toronto at the time and she wanted to be more involved in his life so she started taking the train down here to visit in the summer and around Christmas time. I’ve never minded my aunt so it was just nice to have her around because I knew she got lonely a lot up in Toronto all by herself. She didn’t have many friends and she also doesn’t speak to her and my dads brother (my uncle) and there’s really not much other family out there that we know about. My aunt gets bullied a lot too, she has NF1 (Neurofibromatosis Type 1) which means she has tumour growths covering most of her skin all over her body. I did not mind having her come stay in my home whenever she wanted to come visit my son, and she was always really happy to be around loved ones which made me happy.

In 2021, I had another son, which again, she wanted to be more involved so we continued with the visits. She couldn’t come down to visit as often as when my first son came along because she worked as a Nanny up in Toronto and needed to keep her job to be able to pay rent where she lived. As time went on she started struggling more and more with money and I felt bad so I would lend her money sometimes but she never would pay it back, I knew it was because she was in a financial crisis so I let it slide, I mean she’s family so it is what it is.

Now that you have a little backstory about how little I actually knew about my aunt, I can get into what happened. In the summer of 2024, my aunt texted me to tell me that her facebook got hacked and asked if I could help her retrieve her account. I tried to but ultimately I couldn’t get it back so I reported the facebook and got some friends to do so as well and I went ahead and made my aunt a brand new facebook account, so of course, I knew the login information (this is important for later). After I successfully created a new account for her and re-added all her pictures I saved from her old account because I still had it on my friends list, I started re-adding all her friends and what little family we have. My aunt and I got to talking afterward and I found out she couldn’t work anymore because of her back problems and complications from her NF1. She told me she was depressed and on the verge of homelessness and drinking her pain away every night because she had no desire to buy food or anything other than alcohol with her grocery money. I sat with this information for a few days and then I offered to let her move into my apartment with me and my two son’s (7 and 3 at the time), now mind you it’s only a 2 bedroom apartment and it’s me and 2 children. My children share the biggest bedroom and I have the other bedroom but I gave it to my aunt and I moved to the couch in the living room and she agreed to pay me $500 a month to rent the room.

My aunt arrived the end of September 2024, she didn’t bring much stuff and I found out she left behind a lot which made me wonder why considering we could have made room for her dresser, desk, kitchen stuff etc but she just didn’t want to bring anything other than her clothing, her photo albums and her keurig coffee maker. She got settled in and I was very happy to have her.

The first 2 months of her living here went great. She was helpful around the house, she helped out with her great nephews and she paid rent to me, I was happy with the arrangement. Come December though, things started to change… drastically. She was worried about not being able to afford christmas gifts for people and asked me if she could pay me double rent in January instead of paying in December so she could afford gifts. I said yes of course.. come christmas time she had NO gifts for anyone.. and no money. I let it slide and didn’t question it because christmas isn’t really about gifts anyways and I don’t care but i found it weird she wanted to keep the rent money to get people gifts but then didn’t have gifts or any money. So after that, she started not buying any food for herself because she didn’t have any money, so everything fell onto my shoulders. I have two children, both autistic, my youngest being level 3 autistic and completely non-verbal and my oldest level 1 autistic and he has a rare eating disorder called ARFID (avoidant restrictive food intake disorder) and money is pretty tight for me too and I have my own struggles, but I would be buying whatever she needed because she didn’t have the money to provide for herself, even though she was getting a monthly check from the government.

I started noticing some pretty weird behaviours from her just after christmas of 2024. I had planned on going to my best friends house to have some drinks on new years eve and she tagged along while my kids were with a sitter. It was me, my aunt, my best friend, her boyfriend and my youngest son’s dad (who I am friends with but we’re not together) and we were all just going to drink and play games and watch the ball drop on TV. a few days before I found some cute light up new years eve headbands at the dollar store, so I got 2 of them because I wanted me and my bestie to have cute headbands. my aunt FLIPPED OUT.. she was screaming, crying and swearing at me because I didn’t think of her when I bought them. In all fairness, I could have gotten her one but I sometimes have sort of a one track mind and all I was thinking about was me and my bestie having matching light up headbands. I was on the phone with my bestie while she was flipping out and my aunt was screaming saying “I just wont go then! I’ll stay home!! you’re such a b*tch” and my bestie who was on speaker said “well good.. I don’t want you in my home anyways if you’re gonna act like this.” Well, she ended up coming and that was a huge mistake…

SHE DRANK WAY TOO MUCH.. we told her to take it easy but she wouldn’t listen. She ruined everyone’s night by crying and falling over and she passed out on the toilet and we had to help her and all that is fine but she refused to listen to any of us. She drank at least three quarters of a 40oz bottle of Bacardi and even after passing out and puking and hitting her head off the bathroom floor, she pretty much near threw me to the ground trying to get at the rest of what was in the bottle. We had to hide it. The whole next day when we got home she was profusely apologizing and I said its okay.. but not much else. For the whole month of January she was acting so bizarrely.. I was still buying groceries for her and she did not pay me any rent in January and I paid her phone bill for her so her service didn’t get cut. She was seeking attention on the regular. There was a night that my kids went to my youngest father’s (who took on the role of my oldest sons father) house for the weekend. I thought I’d sit down, get on the headset and play some fortnight with my bestie and our other friend. I was playing away when I checked my phone and my aunt messaged me from the bedroom saying she was sad and alone and needed me. I went into the room and she said she doesn’t want to be alone and I need to shut my game off and come sit with her and maybe watch a movie. I said no I don’t want to but I’m here to talk if she needs a listening ear and I’ll make sure to check on her in between games. I went back to playing my game because she said she didn’t want to talk about it right now and I got another message saying that she cut her wrist because nobody cares about her and everyone wants her to be alone.. So I went back in there and said that I could find her some resources if she’s struggling with self-harm and depression. She said no. I said there’s not much more I can do other than that.. she then told me to just go away.. so I went away. 10 minutes or so later she called me back in, she was standing against the wall saying she felt light headed and nauseous.. I said hold on, I will grab you some water, but something felt so off about this behaviour so after I left the room, I stood in the hallway and just peeked in the room.. I saw her spin around in a circle 3 times and then sit down gently on the floor.. she started yelling for me to come quickly.. I went in and she said “I just collapsed please I need you to stay and not be playing games with your friends. I’m more important” and thats when I really knew… she’s just blatantly attention seeking and I can’t handle this. I knew it was a lie so I said “I’ll call you an ambulance” to which she said “No don’t do that” and I said “Well, I’m not gonna stop gaming” and I left the room and ignored her for the rest of the night. Behaviours like this continued for the rest of the month. I should mention here, because it’s also important for later that a brand new iPad arrived at my door addressed to my aunt. I asked her how she could afford this and she said an online friend sent it to her as a late christmas gift.

February 2025… I was playing cards with her on MY bed that she was sleeping in while I slept on the couch.. my oldest son was asleep on the bed and I noticed something crawling near his head on the pillow… I took a picture of it and googled it and yep.. it was a BEDBUG. I checked the mattress under all the folds and it was crawling with them… I have never had bedbugs in my life.. I immediately dragged my queen sized mattress straight outside onto the curb and bought a tag for it the next day so it could go out with the garbage. I got a hold of pest control, followed all their instructions and got my place sprayed 5 times over the course of 3-4 weeks and I myself got pretty depressed having to live out of garbage bags that were compiled in the hallway. It just wasn’t ideal and again, my aunt only gave me $100 for rent in February and I was still buying her groceries. The whole time she kept apologizing about the bedbugs until I finally said “why do you keep apologizing???” and then she admitted it. Her apartment in Toronto was infested with them and she knew she had them but didn’t want to tell me because she didn’t think I’d let her come live with us if I knew. I was angry.. but I didn’t throw her out for that.. and I get a lot of this may be my own fault because I let so much slide but I did have a breaking point and now let me tell you about that.

March 2025, near the end of the month, she didn’t pay any rent.. whatever, I took my kids to the mall for pictures with the easter bunny, they turned out so cute and I posted one of them as my profile picture on facebook, and I noticed a day later that it had 1 share and I was like what the hell? I clicked it and it was some random woman sharing it and she captioned it “ITS NOT JUST A CHRISTMAS MIRACLE 2024 ITS A EASTER MIRACLE 2025.. THE LITTLE MAN JUDE LOOKS VERY MUCH ALIVE!” … Jude is my youngest son btw. This had me so confused so I went back to my profile pictures for December 2024 and found the one of me and the boys with Santa at the mall and it also had one share that I didn’t notice before.. basically saying the same thing. I called my best friend and we talked about it and we both had a hunch that my aunt had something to do with this so I remembered that I had her facebook login. I logged in and searched this woman up and couldn’t find her.. so it hit me, this woman had my aunt blocked. I ended up getting a hold of her and holy f*ck guys my aunt was putting all her money in a bingo website and scamming her bingo friends for more money by saying Jude (3 years old at the time) had brain cancer and DIED. I confronted my aunt and she denied it but she could see the anger in my face and admitted that she lied about my son dying. I felt angry, I felt sick, and I felt dizzy and my son during that moment was with his dad and I felt like I missed him so much, I needed to see him to see he’s alive and well. It affected me so much, I couldn’t cope that day. I called my best friend back and she raced over and I called the cops to have her escorted off my property. I also found out that the iPad that got delivered for her was not a christmas gift for her, someone sent it for my older son to cope with the loss of of his little brother.. so anyways I found out my dad went and got her from a shelter and had her living with him and then helped her find a room to rent from someone and that my sister lent her the money to pay first and last months rent at the new place, and this all upset me a lot considering what she did. I thought he would care more about me and his grandson’s so I stopped talking to him for a while.

I ultimately forgave him but now its near christmas time and my dad just told me that if my aunt can’t come to christmas dinner at my sisters this year then he will have to not come either to be with her instead so she’s not alone for christmas. We just got into a huge fight because I feel like he’s taking her side after everything she put me and my kids through.

On exit, one can only turn right. This takes you to either the M32 or the Bearpit roundabout past Cabot (as shown on the second image). 

If I wanted to head left towards temple meads, it means I have to go down past one of the busiest streets in Bristol and around one of the busiest round abouts just to come back on myself. This would take an extra 10 minutes in rush hour traffic. Maybe more.

To allow drivers to leave Cabot Circus Carpark, there are traffic lights that stop oncoming traffic from the either side, so what's stopping us from turning left?

I've seen plenty of cars turns left out of this junction with no issue. Having recently been in the passenger seat of someone who did this, I could only think was ""That was simple. Why isn't this allowed"".

The only thing that comes to mind is there is a Puffin crossing about 20 meters down the road but I'm not sure how that factors into this.

Especially in Tier-2 cities?,"If a guy sees someone he finds interesting (in a café, mall, bookstore, park etc.) and politely approaches just to ask for a casual coffee or to exchange Instagram — is that considered rude, creepy, or uncomfortable in India?

I’m especially curious about Tier-2 cities (like Chandigarh Tricity, Jaipur, Indore, Lucknow, Coimbatore, etc.) where social culture may be a little different than in Mumbai/Delhi/Bangalore.

Some specific questions:

• Do you appreciate the confidence or does it feel uncomfortable?
• Are there definite red/green flags in how someone should approach?
• Is daytime in a safe public place okay?
• Should the guy walk away immediately if you say no?
• Would you prefer a quick “Hi, I think you’re cute — can we talk?” or softer conversation first?

So here's my problem: I'm terrible with money, but I hate logging my expenses even more.

Every expense tracker app I tried had the same workflow: open app → click the ""add transaction"" button → select category → enter amount → add note → hit save. Yeah i know it's not that hard but i'm lazy to do it all the time, lol.

Then I thought: ""What if I could just... talk to my expense tracker app?"" Like texting a friend: ""grabbed coffee for $5"" and it just knows what to do.

That's how I built [iSpend](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/ispend-ai-money-manager/id6754285869) \- an AI money manager where you literally just type  naturally like ""lunch with sarah $45"", ""uber home 12 bucks"", ""bought new shoes $89.99"". The AI figures out the category, amount, and logs it instantly.

**Other features:**

* AI insights that actually tell you useful stuff about your spending pattern
* Custom categories/subcategories
* Budget tracking (monthly, weekly, or custom period)
* Clean, minimal UI

The app is free to use with most features. Premium (optional) unlocks unlimited access ($4.99/mo or $29.99/yr with 2-week trial).

1pevick,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmIOverreacting/comments/1pevick/aio_for_kicking_my_aunt_out_onto_the_street_and/,AIO for kicking my aunt out onto the street and then getting mad at my family for helping her?,"I (30F) kicked my aunt (63F) out of my home with nowhere to go earlier this year and then got mad at my family for helping her. So, I’ll start from the beginning.. I grew up in a small-ish city in Ontario, Canada with my mom and my dad who separated before i even came out of my mother’s womb. I lived with my mom for most of my life but I moved in with my dad and my step-mom when I was 13 due to issues I was having with my mom and lack of proper guidance in the home (I was missing a lot of school and would pretty much be allowed to do whatever O wanted). Living with my dad and step-mom was nice but that’s not really relevant to the story. So my dad has 2 siblings, a brother and a sister, who I barely know. I haven’t seen my uncle since I was around 7 years old and I grew up only seeing my aunt just one handful of times in the span of 15 years and then saw her a little more frequently as I grew into a young adult. This is because she lived in Toronto, Ontario.. which is 2.5 hours from where I live and she doesn’t drive and regular visits just weren’t a thing while I was growing up, so with all this being said I’ve never really known her..

In February of 2018, I had my first baby, a son and my aunt was still living in Toronto at the time and she wanted to be more involved in his life so she started taking the train down here to visit in the summer and around Christmas time. I’ve never minded my aunt so it was just nice to have her around because I knew she got lonely a lot up in Toronto all by herself. She didn’t have many friends and she also doesn’t speak to her and my dads brother (my uncle) and there’s really not much other family out there that we know about. My aunt gets bullied a lot too, she has NF1 (Neurofibromatosis Type 1) which means she has tumour growths covering most of her skin all over her body. I did not mind having her come stay in my home whenever she wanted to come visit my son, and she was always really happy to be around loved ones which made me happy.

In 2021, I had another son, which again, she wanted to be more involved so we continued with the visits. She couldn’t come down to visit as often as when my first son came along because she worked as a Nanny up in Toronto and needed to keep her job to be able to pay rent where she lived. As time went on she started struggling more and more with money and I felt bad so I would lend her money sometimes but she never would pay it back, I knew it was because she was in a financial crisis so I let it slide, I mean she’s family so it is what it is.

Now that you have a little backstory about how little I actually knew about my aunt, I can get into what happened. In the summer of 2024, my aunt texted me to tell me that her facebook got hacked and asked if I could help her retrieve her account. I tried to but ultimately I couldn’t get it back so I reported the facebook and got some friends to do so as well and I went ahead and made my aunt a brand new facebook account, so of course, I knew the login information (this is important for later). After I successfully created a new account for her and re-added all her pictures I saved from her old account because I still had it on my friends list, I started re-adding all her friends and what little family we have. My aunt and I got to talking afterward and I found out she couldn’t work anymore because of her back problems and complications from her NF1. She told me she was depressed and on the verge of homelessness and drinking her pain away every night because she had no desire to buy food or anything other than alcohol with her grocery money. I sat with this information for a few days and then I offered to let her move into my apartment with me and my two son’s (7 and 3 at the time), now mind you it’s only a 2 bedroom apartment and it’s me and 2 children. My children share the biggest bedroom and I have the other bedroom but I gave it to my aunt and I moved to the couch in the living room and she agreed to pay me $500 a month to rent the room.

My aunt arrived the end of September 2024, she didn’t bring much stuff and I found out she left behind a lot which made me wonder why considering we could have made room for her dresser, desk, kitchen stuff etc but she just didn’t want to bring anything other than her clothing, her photo albums and her keurig coffee maker. She got settled in and I was very happy to have her.

The first 2 months of her living here went great. She was helpful around the house, she helped out with her great nephews and she paid rent to me, I was happy with the arrangement. Come December though, things started to change… drastically. She was worried about not being able to afford christmas gifts for people and asked me if she could pay me double rent in January instead of paying in December so she could afford gifts. I said yes of course.. come christmas time she had NO gifts for anyone.. and no money. I let it slide and didn’t question it because christmas isn’t really about gifts anyways and I don’t care but i found it weird she wanted to keep the rent money to get people gifts but then didn’t have gifts or any money. So after that, she started not buying any food for herself because she didn’t have any money, so everything fell onto my shoulders. I have two children, both autistic, my youngest being level 3 autistic and completely non-verbal and my oldest level 1 autistic and he has a rare eating disorder called ARFID (avoidant restrictive food intake disorder) and money is pretty tight for me too and I have my own struggles, but I would be buying whatever she needed because she didn’t have the money to provide for herself, even though she was getting a monthly check from the government.

I started noticing some pretty weird behaviours from her just after christmas of 2024. I had planned on going to my best friends house to have some drinks on new years eve and she tagged along while my kids were with a sitter. It was me, my aunt, my best friend, her boyfriend and my youngest son’s dad (who I am friends with but we’re not together) and we were all just going to drink and play games and watch the ball drop on TV. a few days before I found some cute light up new years eve headbands at the dollar store, so I got 2 of them because I wanted me and my bestie to have cute headbands. my aunt FLIPPED OUT.. she was screaming, crying and swearing at me because I didn’t think of her when I bought them. In all fairness, I could have gotten her one but I sometimes have sort of a one track mind and all I was thinking about was me and my bestie having matching light up headbands. I was on the phone with my bestie while she was flipping out and my aunt was screaming saying “I just wont go then! I’ll stay home!! you’re such a b*tch” and my bestie who was on speaker said “well good.. I don’t want you in my home anyways if you’re gonna act like this.” Well, she ended up coming and that was a huge mistake…

SHE DRANK WAY TOO MUCH.. we told her to take it easy but she wouldn’t listen. She ruined everyone’s night by crying and falling over and she passed out on the toilet and we had to help her and all that is fine but she refused to listen to any of us. She drank at least three quarters of a 40oz bottle of Bacardi and even after passing out and puking and hitting her head off the bathroom floor, she pretty much near threw me to the ground trying to get at the rest of what was in the bottle. We had to hide it. The whole next day when we got home she was profusely apologizing and I said its okay.. but not much else. For the whole month of January she was acting so bizarrely.. I was still buying groceries for her and she did not pay me any rent in January and I paid her phone bill for her so her service didn’t get cut. She was seeking attention on the regular. There was a night that my kids went to my youngest father’s (who took on the role of my oldest sons father) house for the weekend. I thought I’d sit down, get on the headset and play some fortnight with my bestie and our other friend. I was playing away when I checked my phone and my aunt messaged me from the bedroom saying she was sad and alone and needed me. I went into the room and she said she doesn’t want to be alone and I need to shut my game off and come sit with her and maybe watch a movie. I said no I don’t want to but I’m here to talk if she needs a listening ear and I’ll make sure to check on her in between games. I went back to playing my game because she said she didn’t want to talk about it right now and I got another message saying that she cut her wrist because nobody cares about her and everyone wants her to be alone.. So I went back in there and said that I could find her some resources if she’s struggling with self-harm and depression. She said no. I said there’s not much more I can do other than that.. she then told me to just go away.. so I went away. 10 minutes or so later she called me back in, she was standing against the wall saying she felt light headed and nauseous.. I said hold on, I will grab you some water, but something felt so off about this behaviour so after I left the room, I stood in the hallway and just peeked in the room.. I saw her spin around in a circle 3 times and then sit down gently on the floor.. she started yelling for me to come quickly.. I went in and she said “I just collapsed please I need you to stay and not be playing games with your friends. I’m more important” and thats when I really knew… she’s just blatantly attention seeking and I can’t handle this. I knew it was a lie so I said “I’ll call you an ambulance” to which she said “No don’t do that” and I said “Well, I’m not gonna stop gaming” and I left the room and ignored her for the rest of the night. Behaviours like this continued for the rest of the month. I should mention here, because it’s also important for later that a brand new iPad arrived at my door addressed to my aunt. I asked her how she could afford this and she said an online friend sent it to her as a late christmas gift.

February 2025… I was playing cards with her on MY bed that she was sleeping in while I slept on the couch.. my oldest son was asleep on the bed and I noticed something crawling near his head on the pillow… I took a picture of it and googled it and yep.. it was a BEDBUG. I checked the mattress under all the folds and it was crawling with them… I have never had bedbugs in my life.. I immediately dragged my queen sized mattress straight outside onto the curb and bought a tag for it the next day so it could go out with the garbage. I got a hold of pest control, followed all their instructions and got my place sprayed 5 times over the course of 3-4 weeks and I myself got pretty depressed having to live out of garbage bags that were compiled in the hallway. It just wasn’t ideal and again, my aunt only gave me $100 for rent in February and I was still buying her groceries. The whole time she kept apologizing about the bedbugs until I finally said “why do you keep apologizing???” and then she admitted it. Her apartment in Toronto was infested with them and she knew she had them but didn’t want to tell me because she didn’t think I’d let her come live with us if I knew. I was angry.. but I didn’t throw her out for that.. and I get a lot of this may be my own fault because I let so much slide but I did have a breaking point and now let me tell you about that.

March 2025, near the end of the month, she didn’t pay any rent.. whatever, I took my kids to the mall for pictures with the easter bunny, they turned out so cute and I posted one of them as my profile picture on facebook, and I noticed a day later that it had 1 share and I was like what the hell? I clicked it and it was some random woman sharing it and she captioned it “ITS NOT JUST A CHRISTMAS MIRACLE 2024 ITS A EASTER MIRACLE 2025.. THE LITTLE MAN JUDE LOOKS VERY MUCH ALIVE!” … Jude is my youngest son btw. This had me so confused so I went back to my profile pictures for December 2024 and found the one of me and the boys with Santa at the mall and it also had one share that I didn’t notice before.. basically saying the same thing. I called my best friend and we talked about it and we both had a hunch that my aunt had something to do with this so I remembered that I had her facebook login. I logged in and searched this woman up and couldn’t find her.. so it hit me, this woman had my aunt blocked. I ended up getting a hold of her and holy f*ck guys my aunt was putting all her money in a bingo website and scamming her bingo friends for more money by saying Jude (3 years old at the time) had brain cancer and DIED. I confronted my aunt and she denied it but she could see the anger in my face and admitted that she lied about my son dying. I felt angry, I felt sick, and I felt dizzy and my son during that moment was with his dad and I felt like I missed him so much, I needed to see him to see he’s alive and well. It affected me so much, I couldn’t cope that day. I called my best friend back and she raced over and I called the cops to have her escorted off my property. I also found out that the iPad that got delivered for her was not a christmas gift for her, someone sent it for my older son to cope with the loss of of his little brother.. so anyways I found out my dad went and got her from a shelter and had her living with him and then helped her find a room to rent from someone and that my sister lent her the money to pay first and last months rent at the new place, and this all upset me a lot considering what she did. I thought he would care more about me and his grandson’s so I stopped talking to him for a while.

I ultimately forgave him but now its near christmas time and my dad just told me that if my aunt can’t come to christmas dinner at my sisters this year then he will have to not come either to be with her instead so she’s not alone for christmas. We just got into a huge fight because I feel like he’s taking her side after everything she put me and my kids through. So, AIO for kicking her out onto the streets and for being mad at my family for helping her out and still continuing to have a relationship with her?",7,1764942503.0,AmIOverreacting,33,0.77,False

by [https://www.gptsportswriter.com](https://www.gptsportswriter.com) **Gonzaga Bulldogs vs. Kentucky Wildcats: A Clash of Clutch and Cash**

The Gonzaga Bulldogs (7-1) and Kentucky Wildcats (5-3) are set to collide on December 5, 2025, in a game that’s less a basketball match and more of a statistical car crash. Let’s break it down with the precision of a coach’s whiteboard and the wit of a halftime comedian.

---

### Parsing the Odds: Numbers Don’t Lie (Mostly)

Gonzaga is the clear favorite here, per the decimal odds: **1.43** for the ‘Zags vs. **2.88** for Kentucky. Converting that to implied probabilities, Gonzaga’s 69.9% chance of winning vs. Kentucky’s 34.7% makes this look less like a game and more like a math textbook error. The spread? Gonzaga’s -5.5 line suggests they’ll win by enough points to make a coffee break look long, while the total of 159.5 points is as high as Kentucky’s hopes for a coherent offseason coaching strategy.

Statistically, Gonzaga’s defense is a fortress, allowing just 67.0 PPG (62nd nationally) while scoring 90.8 PPG (19th). Kentucky’s offense is slightly spicier, averaging 86.6 PPG, but their defense is a sieve with leaks you could plant tomatoes in (63.6 PPG allowed, 16th). The ‘Zags also struggle from beyond the arc (7.4 threes per game, 230th), but Kentucky’s 9.0 threes per game (104th) means they’ll need their snipers sharp. Too bad Gonzaga’s opponents make even more threes (7.1) — maybe the ‘Zags will finally catch a break against a team that *doesn’t* shoot like a NASA engineer.

---

### Digesting the News: Injuries, Coaching Drama, and One Questionable Haircut

Gonzaga’s recent 101-61 loss to Michigan was so lopsided, you’d think the ‘Zags showed up to play golf. But let’s not panic! Braden Huff still dropped 14 points in that disaster, proving even bad games have their silver linings (e.g., “At least he didn’t trip over his shoelaces *this* time”).

Kentucky’s woes are more… chaot

Sometimes if I step away for a period of time, I feel like I have to restart to get back into things.

The first time I played I think I opened every door/area the moment I had the Dreamlight, and totally overwhelmed myself.

So as I am drinking my coffee and trying to decide (after being gifted the other expansions I didn’t get) if I should restart totally fresh or carry on as I have been.

1pevfgw,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPD/comments/1pevfgw/im_ashamed_i_have_bpd/,I’m ashamed I have BPD,"(Advice isn’t necessary but is still welcome)

I know it’s not my fault. I didn’t ask for my childhood. And I don’t hide it or anything, if people ask I’m open about it and am willing to talk about it. But I’m ashamed that I have it. Or maybe more so of the things I say and do because of it. I’m ashamed that I’m emotionally stunted and lash out like a teenager when I’m a grown adult. I’m ashamed of how I treat my loved ones during episodes. I’m ashamed of the distress I cause my husband because of my severe mental illness. I know he won’t give up on me, and part of me is so thankful for that. But the other part of me feels guilty. Like I’m ruining his life. Like he’d be better off without me. Like no matter how good he thinks I am, I’m not good enough to make enduring my episodes worth it. I freaked out this morning because he said we couldn’t walk to the cafe and get a cup of coffee. I was so upset, I wanted to have one so bad. I don’t know why. I don’t even like coffee that much. I was just so focused on having that coffee, that SPECIFIC coffee. And I acted miserable all morning. He did nothing wrong, he didn’t deserve that. So why am I so awful to him? 

It’s like the more I love a person, the more at risk they are. The more likely I am to target and hurt them. I feel like the best thing I can do for people I love is to hold them at arm’s length. I’m scared to let people love me because I feel like a walking disaster. I feel like I’m watching my husband burn out before my eyes and it’s all my fault. I remember who I was when I was a teenager, when my BPD had started to show symptoms but I hadn’t lost myself yet. I want to go back to that and I don’t know how. I don’t know what to do with my life because I never expected to be here this long. I hate what this disorder has done to me, the person it’s made me into, the things I’ve done and said because of who it turned me into. I want to get better and I’m trying, but every episode makes it feel like I’m fighting a hopeless battle and that scares me. I’m scared of myself. I’m scared that I’ll be stuck like this. That I’ll lose everyone. That when I find who I am again, it’ll be someone awful. That I’ll hurt my (future) kids the way my parents hurt me. 

I know I need to keep carrying this. And I will. But I don’t know how much longer I can do it. It’s all getting so heavy. And I’m so tired.",1,1764942292.0,BPD,1,1.0,False

As I walk toward the empty bench, I see a single scarf draped over one side of it. No bag, no person in sight. Just a scarf. I figured someone forgot it, so I gently moved it to the back of the bench and sat down. Maybe 3 minutes later, a woman power-walks toward me and goes, “UM, excuse me. You’re in **my** spot.” I honestly thought she meant the other end of the bench. Nope. She meant the exact place I was sitting. She points at the scarf and says, “I put that there to HOLD the bench while I went to get coffee. That means it’s RESERVED.” I told her I thought it was lost property. She said, in the most offended tone imaginable, “Who would leave a *nice scarf* at a park? It’s obviously saving my seat!” I apologized but explained that public benches are… public. She huffed, said, “Well now I feel awkward sitting next to someone who stole my spot,” then grabbed her scarf, dramatically sighed, and sat on the grass—ten feet away—while glaring at me like I’d committed a crime.

TULLAHOMA, Tenn. (WKRN) — A 50-year-old man and his 3-month-old granddaughter are dead after a violent dog attack that took place Wednesday afternoon in Tullahoma.

According to 14th Judicial District Attorney General Craig Northcott, the Coffee County Communications Center received a call at approximately 3 p.m. about an “apparent mauling by pit bulls” that occurred in the 900 block of E. Warren Street.

A neighbor, Brian Kirby, said he came home from work and saw a woman in the middle of the street screaming. He immediately sprang into action.

Kirby asked the woman if she needed help, but instead of answering him, he said she ran off toward the back of the house. Moments later, Kirby heard sirens and knew something was horribly wrong.

Officials reported that when law enforcement arrived at the scene, they observed the dogs attacking the infant. The dogs were reportedly killed to stop the attack, but two people—identified as 50-year-old James Alexander Smith and his 3-month-old granddaughter—were already deceased.

While Kirby said this was the first time he’s seen the dogs be violent toward humans, he said it isn’t the first instance of violence he’s seen. 

He said he saw firsthand the dogs were violent toward other animals. Kirby intended to make a police report a week prior, claiming they killed his beloved pet cat.

“I don’t believe that they thought this would ever happen,” Kirby said. “I’m sure it was not done on purpose. I think that people just have animals, and they just need to put them on a leash better; that’s all. And I’m not blaming them for what happened at all. I know that they’re devastated more than we are because it’s their family. It’s just hard to understand and wrap your head around it.”

Kirby brought his pet cat home eight years ago, and she still holds a special place in his heart.

“She was just a wonderful cat,” he said. “She was just an ideal cat, never made a mess; she was just a beautiful animal that I loved very much.”

However, Kirby hopes pet owners know taking care of animals includes loving them and putting them on leashes for safety. In addition, he hopes this situation never happens again.

“The police are limited; they can’t do much about it,” Kirby said. “I don’t believe they thought the dogs were dangerous. I believe they just had too many.”

According to Northcott, an investigation is ongoing to determine if there was a violent history with the dogs and other potential issues that “may have contributed to this situation.” He added that the dogs involved in the deadly attack have been euthanized and other dogs in the home were taken by Tullahoma Animal Control.

No decisions have been made when it come to criminal charges, said Northcott.

“This was an especially difficult and brutal scene,” Northcott stated in a press release about the incident. “Please pray for the family of the victims in this difficult time as well as the first responders as they cope with the trauma from what they witnessed.”

An investigation into the deadly attack is being led by the Tullahoma Police Department. Anyone with additional information is asked to contact Investigator Jessica Taylor at **931-455-0530**, Investigator Jason Williams or Investigator James Sherill with the District Attorneys Office at **931-723-5055**.

# Jan 05, 2025: The Warrior

*Tuatha De Danaan*

We had to relocate again. I am sitting down and finally a single section further in my packet, a curious thing, this internet, when my guide interrupts me.

“You sure it was a good thing antagonizing him like that?” Ray is concerned. I smile. He is a very wise Hunter. A rarity.

“No, it wasn’t. I had to offer to take it. I was not lying. That spear is powerful, but the cost is ruin. Better to take it and end his misery than allow things to escalate.”

“Yea, boss, I think they escalated…” He stops as he is interrupted by our guest.

“You have no idea. They are going to attack the CaFae in a few hours.”  Robin steps out from behind a chair. I do love how he manages such things.

Ray immediately gets scared. “I know I am the person with the least right to say anything here, but um, that is not good.”

“For them. Tell me, Puck, the pack that failed to kill the troll.  How were they lost?”

Puck laughs and sits down on the chair he appeared behind. “You know how. It was the consort. She burned them to ashes. She did so with an efficiency and cruelty that were in equal measure. Her powers might be enough to destroy the spear.”

I shake my head. “No, the price for destroying it would be her death.”

He ponders this. “I don’t think Thanatos would allow the queen to threaten him a second time for her.”

The Hunter and I both gawk. “Tell us.”

Puck smiles. “Well, you see, it was a miserable day in December when a car began careening towards Connie’s sole remaining tree and Jackie’s actions began a series of events. The Banshee there to cry with Jacqueline’s loved ones found Pat was unwilling to grieve and instead left with her dying love to face Thanatos and tell him to, I believe, fuck off, as Jackie was hers. He let her go and so we still have that one. I have warned my king about her several times, he is still pursuing her. As is Titania. I could say that about half the court, really…”

I never understood the Sidhe promiscuity. I guess that comes with their lifespans and peculiar emotions. Though my people live longer. And we have long marriages, which tend to be fairly monogamous until they end, like mine have. Oh well, as long as they are not hurting one another, I care not. I do care that it appears the Evergreen Queen has met death and won. Who is she meeting next, the Creator?



# Jan 05, 2025: Connie

*Wood Nymph*

I walk into my second, (third now?) home. Mab is at the counter getting a drink. Many heads turn and wave. I am so happy here always.

I get my tea and see Mab looking at her new tablet with an almost perplexed look on her face. I feel like I should see what is going on, she tends to be up to trouble when she is thinking, and such trouble usually has my Lady as the target.

“Good day, great Queen of Air and Darkness. What has you so concerned?” I smile. I absolutely mean it. For all her conniving, the Queen loves My Lady and I will always be glad to help her.

She shows me a dress. “What do you think? I have a formal event that I am supposed to dress up for. I was thinking about this dress or something similar.” She shows me the dress. Red, form fitting, very fetching.

“I believe cool colors and blues look better on you, gorgeous lady.” *I mean, she could pull that off, she is phenomenally gorgeous.* I realize I broadcast. We make eye contact. I shrug. “I meant that too.”

She smiles and gets up. “Sit with me. Take this spot so you can look at your Lady. I am waiting for something beautiful to happen.” We see Patricia and wave as she begins cleaning. She is melancholy and hiding it. I can tell. I see Mab change her glamour. She looks nothing like she normally does suddenly. Why?

She turns and looks as the door chime rings, and points so I know to look.

WHY?!

 

# Jan 05, 2025: Pat Wallace

*Human that is about to cry.*

I am in the shop doing some cleaning. I need to keep busy. I can’t obsess. Usually they send something by now. A follow up with what happened follows at night. I just want to know she is safe. I know she is. But today… why am I like this?

The door chime rings. Three regulars. One has a lilt to their ring. May be enlightened soon. Not too many problem Fae in the lobby, as long as Mab isn’t counted, so I won’t have to worry too much about it. Where is Mab? Wasn’t she with Connie? No matter. After last night’s excitement, I would like less stress. I am still cleaning the table when I hear a voice I have only heard from one event. A voice etched in my soul. Her voice.

I stop dead in shock.

“Mom, this place cooks for a franchise coffee place.”

No. No no no no. It’ can’t be. Why are they here? They can’t be.

“Yes, it is, Riley. You asked us to take you somewhere special in the city for your birthday. It is a pretty special place. Right Honey?” Mary’s voice is full of mirth and she is talking in my direction…

Matt laughs and I feel someone looking at me as he speaks. “Sure is. The reviews said the lady in charge has a near perfect ass…” Todd’s ultimate troll review is still getting me.

“Lies! You are staring at it. You can obviously tell it is a perfect ass, Matt.”

“Been a while, Pat.” I can hear him smiling. Also, he hasn’t stopped looking at my ass. Jerk. I smile, can’t help it.

I turn and the tears are barely contained. “Hi Matt, Mary. Nice to see you again. Been exactly nine years…” I look at the tall gangly child in front of me and my head tilts. She has a pair of jeans on her coat on her arm and on her back is… a She-Ra Sword?

Riley processes the significance of my comment in her head while she looks at me. Her head tilts in the exact way mine does at this moment. Is that how my face looks when I am processing? Uncanny. Guess some things are genetic.

“Guardian momma?”

I hear a gasp from behind me. I know it is Connie.

I smile and open my arms, “Hi, angel girl.”

She drops the coat, runs across the lobby, and slams into me. We tumble back a bit and I get a hug so big I cannot breathe. Or maybe it is me being choked up? Yea, the tears can just do whatever they want now. Here, universe, have some snot too, I got plenty for you.

“Going to lunch back soonish.” I wave at Meg as I head over to the CaFae. My baby wants to have lunch, I am having lunch with her. I get close to the door when I see a new text. “In booth, have a surprise for you.”   
Okay, she’s feeling good. That is a blessing. I wave at Mab leaving as I walk in.

Wait. Was she… crying?!?!

Nah.

The door chimes my newest theme and I see Pat and…

 

# Jan 05, 2025: Patricia Wallace

*Human Warlock Guardian Momma*

I am sitting at a booth with the super parents across from me. Riley is essentially in my lap. My arm is around her. I am stupidly happy. She’s been staring at Grey and Connie and a bunch of other people. We are having some coffee and the person I am waiting for comes in. The Chime has settled on Firestarter in metal.

She sees me and Riley. She takes in Riley’s height, face, and eyes. She realizes who Riley is. I get to see this all in real time. She fucking screams and jumps like a girl. Her hair catches fire in that moment and then she damn near runs up before she stops at the table. She is so ready to scoop up Riley. “Is this… Riley?”

Riley nods while looking at her funny.

She scoops my angel up and hugs her. Riley laughs.

Jackie is beaming as she says, “She is adorbs!”

We laugh as she puts Riley down and then has her sit between us.

“Matt, Mary, Riley, this is Jackie.”

Before I can say anything she pipes up. “I’m her roommate.”  Hehe. Yea. Technically… we were such a cliché.  Mona was right.

Riley looks at Jackie in an almost mocking tone and pipes up, “you can say girlfriend. I am not 5…”

I snicker. She snickers. Matt and Mary both laugh. “Spent less than a day with her birth mother, same snicker. Hilarious.”

I catch Jackie up, “So Jackie, Matt got a job in the city and is looking at apartments. I have been checking with some folks to see if I can help out. They knew where I work…” I look at her pointedly. Did she trade this for my yearbook info?

Matt interrupts. “Work? You OWN this place, Pat.”

I scratch the back of my head. “Well, yea, but I still WORK here too…”

Riley laughs a bit and mutters under her breath. I catch all of it thanks to wanting to hear it. “Yea, along with actual mermaids.”

I stop talking. I look at her. “What about mermaids?”

She points at Grey. “Mermaid. And the tree woman is very pretty. She has been looking at us a lot. I think she is really happy for you but doesn’t want to come over. The woman that was next to her and left is impossibly pretty and her skin is blue. And then there’s the big guy that looks like a goblin.”  She is looking at Amai.

Matt and Mary stare at her. I decide I need to check this. Matt seems to not be as surprised as I think he should be. “You also gawked at Jackie, why?”

She looks so adorable as she looks away. “When she saw me and got excited her hair caught fire for a second. It went back so I thought I was wrong. But I mean, look at the mermaid. And now I can’t stop seeing the tree lady. She is really anxious.

Matt and Mary stare. Matt looks like a bunch of things are lining up. I can almost see the cogs in his head going.

Well, this is a mess. My kid is enlightened. Not just enlightened, she sees through glamour. And she got so during this visit. The chime predict it? Guess it likes fucking with me by making my loved ones a surprise? I will get you someday Chime, mark my thoughts.

The Chime makes a sad trumpet noise. It heard that?!  It’s fucking mocking me? I may just kill it. It makes a scared noise. Heh. Better.

Connie walks up. “May I meet Riley?”

Riley looks at her. “Hi. Are you like a treant from that old movie?”  Connie looks shocked. I am annoyed at calling Lord of the Rings old. “No dear angel. I am not so impressive. Hold on, you can see the real me?”

She nods and says, “You were a very pretty lady and then I hugged guardian momma and you turned into a very sexy tree with eyes that have green fire. They are very pretty. And you look kind, still.”

There are far too many regulars here. To the office we go.

“Come on, I have something to show all of you.”  As we begin Jen walks in. I give her a hug and thank her for taking over the rest of my shift. “Remember to remind me it is double time for a call in an e-mail for payroll.”  She laughs. “Yes Miss Pat.”  I give her a wink, we step into my office.

“Please sit on the couch. Jackie and Connie and I are going to explain some stuff. Before we do, please don’t freak out. I have to show you what Riley is seeing.”

I look at Connie. This is a level of trust that is hard to explain. She laughs and cups my face. “They are part of your family, My Lady, my love.” She drops her glamour and they see her true form like Riley does. She does the thing where her roots and legs extend so she can be eye to eye with me. She winks and then lowers herself to her normal petite height.

Matt seems to be processing even more. Mary freaks out.

I start talking to calm her down by grabbing her hands, “So, this place has been a regular coffee shop for Fairy tale creatures for some time. It has caused a lot of weirdness in my life and I wouldn’t trade a minute of it. Jackie used to work here. And it sort of changed her.”

I motion to Jackie. She laughs and sets her hair on fire. Just that. It’s still crazy that she can control it that much.

Riley laughs and claps. “That is is so an aura farming move. Damn!”

Mary looks at me. “This is insane. Fairies are real?”

Connie chuckles. “Most of us prefer the term Fae. I am an alseid, a grove wood nymph, which most people call dryads. It’s sort of a vulgar term in some circles. My main tree is the one near the corner. The rest are at the Wild Hunt apartment building. A good friend, Skerrit, owns it. I have a few trees there so I can remain close if My Lady needs me.”

I smile. She is trying to keep it a secret.

Matt finally chimes in. “This explains some of the weird reviews. And some of the replies when I talked with some friends. And more...”

Of course he figured it out. And then he gets me trapped.

“My lady, my love?

Oh crap.

Connie all but laughs. Jackie just laughs and winks.

“So, um, I am not in a traditional relationship.”

Riley chuckles. “Yea no shit.”

“RILEY! Language!!!”  Mary is glaring at her child.

“Mom, Guardian Momma has two girlfriends and one of them is a sexy tree, the other has fire hair. She is way not traditional. Hey, Guardian Momma, do you have a boyfriend too? Is he a centaur?”

“RILEY!”

I laugh, “No the centaur is my landlord.”

Jackie fucking butchers me...  “Ask her about how her ex-boyfriend compares to a centaur.”

I go red as does Mary, Matthew just starts laughing while Riley realizes what she meant.

Jackie then giggles and continues, “It works for us. Trust me. It isn’t easy. More than 80% fail, compared to 50% of marriages, but we are figuring this out and doing our best. We just invited Connie into our little family. But there is one part where you are wrong, Miss Thing. Promise you won’t freak out? All I showed you with the hair was the tip of the iceberg. Wanna see the whole thing? Full aura farming mode?”

Riley all but breaks her head nodding. Mary smiles and finally looks able to handle things. “Show me. I am betting that it is way better than just the hair.”

Jackie walks near the door and just becomes a firestorm.  She smiles and her blue flaming eyes twinkle. Molten brass skin, the works. A thumbs up and a cheesy pose follow. She is back to gorgeous normal Jackie in an instant.

“So, the best part is that I am like this because I am the Queens consort.”

Both Matt and Mary snap their heads to me. “That makes you…”

I walk up to Jackie and kiss her on the cheek. As I do I switch to my Queen self. The wings spread, a crown of snow-covered evergreen needles appears above my head and my green fire wisps out.

“Hi, I am now the Fae Queen of Caffeine and Comfort.”

“Guardian momma really is an angel!” Riley all but has stars in her eyes.

“No, sweet girl, but I actually know a few…” I sense something happening. “Hold up…. I’ll be right back.”

 

# Jan 05, 2025: Jen

*Human enlightened*

I clock in not 2 minutes before and my favorite regular walks in. He looks around and looks a little upset. Like he missed something.

“Morning Bob. Usual?”

“Yes, Ms. Jen. How are you doing this morning? You seem a little down.”

Bob is awesome. He is kind. He is sweet. He doesn’t judge like some do. I feel okay telling him. “Some family problems. One of my siblings is deadnaming me and refuses to acknowledge who I am.”  I know it shouldn’t bother me after so much time, but it still does.

Bob grabs my hand. “You are loved. You are a good woman. James will come around eventually.”

“Thanks Bob. You are the best.” Wait, how does he know James’ name and that it is him?

Bob smiles at me and, you know, things don’t feel that bad. He does seem a little sad. He pats my hand.

“For what it is worth, I love you. You are pretty special.” 

My day just got way better. “Thanks Bob. Means a lot.”

He walks over to what is becoming his usual friend group. A priest, a rabbi, and a couple of others that vary from time to time. I think one is a social worker today. They chat. This feels like a joke set up somehow. I decide to let it go.

Oh boy.  What looks like a biker gang walks in. Like the whole damn gang too. The guy that is obviously in charge has a cape and a walking stick. Wait. A cape and a walking stick? Oh shit, is that actually a spear?

“Sir there are no weapons allowed here.” He actually growls at me. He looks like he is about to throw it at me when he stops and looks at it. He then looks at Pat. Wait, Pat?! When did she get here?

Oh fuck. Miss Pat’s pissed. Her eyes have that green fire exploding everywhere again. Funny thing, I am less than a foot away from a fairy queen with fire surrounding her that ends less like maybe an inch from me and all I can think about is how safe I feel and how angry she is that someone was going to hurt me. Her wings are to either side of me. Oh, they are spreading to protect me.

“You intended to hurt Jen. Get out.”

“I am not bound by……. Aaaaaaaaaarrrrrgggg” she grabbed his arm. I hear it sizzle from here.

“This sanctuary is my domain. You are not welcome. You are a terrible guest. Leave.” Her voice drops to a really, REALLY scary whisper. That isn’t her voice, not really, that says the next words. It is a voice of malice, hate and rage. I have heard voices like this directed at me from family. Now Family is using it for me. “Now.”

He starts buckling and begins walking for the door, poorly. I swear he looks see through at one point in there as he stumbles.  The other guys grab their boss and walk out with him. He seems to get better once he is off the lot. Connie is out there. But she was in the office when Pat went in…. Fae magic. Speaking of, none of the regulars, Bob included, saw any of that due to where they are sitting in the lobby.  This place is insane. Connie waves at them. They back away from her. Haha. It is hilarious that they are afraid of her. Sweet and kind little Connie scares a bunch of bikers.

The few bikers that didn’t leave walk up and one snarls at Pat. “You can’t hide here forever. Sooner or later you will have to step out and when you do, we will be waiting for you.”

“I recall someone telling me it was 7 to 1 before he and all his friends fucked around and found out. They lost. Wanna see the ashes?  How many you got?”

He looks a little shocked. “34”

Pat smiles. “That before or after you lost the seven? Either way, I’ll bet your 34 against 7 of mine.  Titania, Mab, Morgana, Oberon, Jack Frost, me, and Jackie. Heck, I can throw my shield maiden Connie. So 8.  I won’t be the one to lose.”

“We have the Spear of Lugh.”

She laughs. “Yea, the wielder can’t be beaten in battle. You aren’t the one holding it, are you?  Let me clue you in on something, the guy holding it is the most selfish and cowardly of the lot of you. You may all die, he won’t. He seems to spend all of you like tokens at an arcade. You sure you wanna follow him?”

“The eminence is brilliant and powerful.”

“Sure. Sure, Bill. He’s awesome, blah blah blah…” She rolls her hand around, a finger raised up. Dismissing a guy that towers over her and she’s 6 feet tall. Just so nonplussed. She looks behind him at one of the other bikers, “Hey Trevor, you ordering your Café Mocha Venti, or what?”  She is still in her bad ass form, doing this… The tough looking biker laughs. Wow, those arms.  Um, holy crap, he is solid. Gorgeous too. “Yes. The usual.”

She looks at me. “Put his Mocha on my tab, throw in a cookie. Everybody loves cookies. Not chocolate though.”

He growls and then laughs. It is a belly laugh. He can’t help himself. He is cute as he does it.

Yeesh this woman.

Why not chocolate?

 

# Jan 05, 2025: Jackie Flynn

*Human Warlock Aura Farmer*

I watch Pat vanish. I then look at the monitors she has for the security cameras.

“Oh shit.”

Connie sees what I see, those guys are led by a guy in a cape holding a spear. No fucking way. Matt and the family are now also looking. We have audio, I turn it up.

“You are a terrible guest. Leave. NOW!”

I see the guy buckle. I have seen her invoke this twice before. Both times were with people she thought were trying to take me. Nice to see her doing it to save Jen.

“Did guardian momma just curse that guy?”

Mark laughs, “Sure looks like it. She had really can’t stand the idea of someone hurting someone she cares about.”  He shakes his head. *Why didn’t she care about herself back then?*

I need to get ahead of this, “He’ll be fine once he leaves the property.  Connie, darling, would you do me a favor and get out there ahead of them?”  I figure they may need a push when outside.” She can handle them. Neither realize that Pat caring about her all these years has changed Connie. Mab told me she could probably claim the Queen of Alseid title. That or maybe even Queen of Nymphs…

“As you wish, my lady.” And she is gone. Her ability to switch over in an instant is insane.

Mary looks over. “Um, can every fairy do that where they vanish and reappear?”

I chuckle. “No, in fact I only know of Pat and Pixies doing it. Connie went to the Fae world and is running ahead of them. Oh look, she just popped back into our world near her tree.”

Mark catches on quickly, “You can enter the world of the fairies um Fae, here?”

I nod. “This place has a lot of juice for a mundane place. It connects that world with ours on the entire property. It is also where she and a few others including me call our domain.”

Mary looks over. “That is a pretty loaded word.”

I nod. “Especially for the things we are dealing with. It means she is essentially the dominant creature here. And her word is law. She called him a bad guest. In her eyes there are few things worse than that. Her domain reacted by pushing him out. If he tried to stay too long, it wouldn’t be pretty.”

Riley looks over and gets a wicked grin. “How not pretty, like he’d explode?”

I laugh. I see both of her moms in her. Mary’s eyebrow game is strong with this one. I answer her with, “Like erased from existence.”

I see three shocked looks.

Riley, of course, pipes up, “Bad ass.”

Mary just looks at her daughter and nods.  HAHAHAHA

“She’s done it twice in anger before. No erasing so far, yet. Once was when someone was getting handsy with me in the restroom. The second was when a Fae Queen decided to prank her by acting like she was seducing me.” I wink at them.

Mark looks shocked. “She could have killed a Queen?”

I nod. “Not could have. She was killing her. I think the Queen was trying to help us and risking her life doing it. The same Queen refused to leave until Pat realized what was going on..”

Pat pipes up behind me, “What was going on was I was absolutely in love with this goober and I couldn’t deal with it because things kept interfering or I was too dense to realize when she kept telling me how in love with me she was. My dense head couldn’t figure it out.”

Mark looks at her. “Speaking of dense, that shell of yours looks tough, but the cracks… fuck me.”

Mary reflexively pipes up, “language!”

He looks at her and I see his eyes are watering. Oh, he noticed. He is the one that sent Mab and I the pics…  He realized the significance of the damage to that shell.

“Mark?” Mary follows his eyes and sees the arm with the fire piercing it. She suddenly looks all over Pat and sees every crack and every blemish, every wound still breathing fire. “Oh god!” 

She runs over and before Pat can change, she is looking at her arm. Then her ring finger. She quietly cries as Pat tries not to lose her shit. Riley looks at her.  Mab said they knew about it. I am guessing they didn’t know the full extent of it.

Riley knows. She sees how damaged that shell is.

I jump in and try to distract them, “Hey, let’s get you all to your current base. We can talk again later. We have to get this entire crisis figured out and we don’t want you seen with me. Those guys up front were Werewolves and they are looking for a way to hurt us. They can’t know about you.”

Pat changes back immediately. She puts her finger up. “Angel girl, let’s try something. I want you to only see the Fair Folk as they truly are if you are trying to. So, think hard on seeing them only when you want to. Got that pictured?”

Riley nods.

“Good.” Pat kisses her on the forehead. I feel a little shift in the air. Riley looks out the office door and at Grey.

“It worked guardian momma.” She hugs Pat and my heart melts. So cute.

I see something that makes me pause. Amai is escorting people to the edge of the lot. Not everyone, but enough of them that the bikers are backing up a little. 

Matt steps up, “I will take the family, and we will make sure we are safe. You two do the same. Okay?” Matt is a damn good guy. Mary immediately goes into protective mom mode and produces some masks. I know why Pat left Riley with these two now.  They really are super parents.

“I know we just met, but if you need us, you call. Here is my info.” I give them a card and write my personal phone on the back. “Call anytime. Oh, and wait for Amai to get back, he’ll escort you to your car or whatever.”

They nod and head out. Amai walks with them and asks them if they are tourists as they leave. He was winking and Matthew nodded.

Pat looks at me. “She figured out how bad it was, didn’t she?” She is barely holding it together.

I nod. “I think they all knew before. But they know just how much of a guardian you are now.”

She hugs me and cries for a while. Even now she wanted to protect her daughter from him. I hope I never meet him. If I do, I may become an actual monster.



# Jan 05, 2025: The Warrior

*Tuatha De Danaan*

The majority of these automobiles work by taking a substance from the ground and igniting it as if using magical fire. This ball of fire pushes a metal rod around and that moves other things which provide power. While I believe Nixie is correct, I am fairly certain a lot was left out here. Also, they abbreviated the name of something that runs on fire to ICE.

Humans are really strange.

Oh, my guide is here. He nods at me. “It’s going down, let’s get to the sanctuary.”

I nod. “You Hunters call it the sanctuary?”

He shrugs and opens my door for his automobile. “Seat belt. Yes, we call it sanctuary. No Hunter can operate there and the humans there are absolutely safe. One of my colleagues said that a devil threw hands with another one for trying to make a deal on the grounds. Also, Pat will crush anyone that tries shit. The only time I have heard of her having a problem was an assassin.”

I look at him, “an assassin?”

He laughs as he drives. “That spirit Fox we met sent a human assassin. She has a charm that keeps any human from seeing her if they mean her harm. A human assassin and a hobgoblin staged a fight. She went to break it up. The hobgoblin that works there, Amai, is the one that knocked the charm off and the assassin ambushed her.”

He has a name. I wonder…

We arrive and park. I notice a pack of werewolves standing around the Alseid’s main tree. She is laughing and talking with them. A perfect hostess. I wonder if they realize she could kill all of them and not exert herself very much at all doing so. I wonder if she realizes it.

 I see the Hobgoblin escorting a family to a car.  I look again. “Tell me, why would Patricia’s child be with those people?”

Raymond looks and has a puzzled expression. “I see it, yea, that’s her kid.” We hear the Hobgoblin talking to the family. “Well, I hope your trip to New York takes you to many fun sites for your vacation. Have a good time.”

He sees us and nods to Raymond. Raymond tips his hat back. We are “escorted” to the shop. “Would you be so kind as to tell me what are you called?” 

He nods. “Amaideach”. I do a double take. My escort has no clue. “Interesting, how did you come by that?”

He laughs and smiles. “My Queen gave me it at the same time as she told me I would be hers until I had made up for my mistake in an assault on her to all the rest of the Courts.”

“Have you?” Raymond is curious. He asks what I would have.

“I never would be able to. Doesn’t matter. She ripped iron chains off me out of kindness. She gave me a name when she had every right to destroy me or worse. She is Lady and Queen and I will serve her until I die.” He sounds so proud as he walks in with us.

We see the firebrand kissing the Queen as she begins to walk for the door. I nod my head in recognition. “Good day, good lady.”

She smiles at me and winks. “Better day now that I saw you.”

As she leaves, I decide to check. She has her head turned and is looking at my ass. I should have known with this one. We make eye contact after I look at her own rather nice rear and her smile becomes lascivious in a way that is difficult to quantify.

I turn back and the Queen is laughing. She waves at us, “come in.”

We head to an office that is best described as a small home for anyone that wishes it to be theirs and we are motioned to sit on a furniture piece called a couch. We do so.

“Here for the puppy fun?” She is smiling. “Or here to sneak a peak at Verenestra’s most dangerous descendant’s ass?”

I feel my cheeks go red. Raymond outright laughs.

He looks at her and winks. “It is a fine ass. Not as good as your perfect ass, but still fine.” There is a joke they share here.

“Finally, someone gets me. You know how hard it is to maintain junk in the trunk of this caliber? My squat game is unmatched. I miss volleyball sometimes.” This queen is adorable.

“I apologize, I felt it likely she was staring at mine and felt it fair to do it as well. Also, we thought there might be trouble. I take it the Spear refused to be used in a sanctuary on an unarmed person?”

She nods. “It did. Also I told him he was a bad guest and he needed to go. He did.”

“So, you need to deal with the pack out by Ms. Connie’s tree?” Raymond seems eager to “deal with them” here and is uncharacteristically bloodthirsty.

She shakes her head. “Trevor is a good guy. Comes here a lot. He is nice to all the staff. Jen damn near starting salivating over him just now. I would like to avoid hurting her if I can. She has enough people doing it.”

I do not understand what she means but her desire to protect one of her staff means much here. I nod. Raymond does as well.

He chuckles, “They gotta deal with Miss Connie anyway. Boss here rates her out of my league. I can probably take 3 of them and it is a 7 pack so should be no problem for her.”

Patricia looks at me. “How would you rate her?”

I shrug. “If she desired the title of Queen of the Alseid none could contest her. Even Queen of the Nymphs may be attainable. Though that would entail other baggage and some hostility along with a real fight. Last I knew the title was held by Maia.”

She looks at me. “Alseid. She used that term. I have to get used to that term and not Dryad.”

I nod.  “Dryad is an Oak Tree nymph. Alseid are nymphs of groves. Human language being what it is, dryad is likely a generic term for all tree nymphs. The fact that her grove was reduced to a single tree and she was still able to manifest says something of her tenacity. That or another factor allowed her to appear. Some sort of trauma to someone nearby may have reawakened her if she was dormant. As it stands, her current power is insane.”

The Queen nods.  “She made 4 new trees recently…”

I laugh. “I saw. And that gives her safety. I am glad for it. It is a safe place for a new grove to begin.  Her kind are long lived, so long as some of her trees remain, so does she. She could take that pack easily. Why did she become your shield maiden?”

The queen smiles sadly, “A vehicle was going to pin her to the tree if not outright break it due to weather and a careless driver. Jackie ran forward, causing the driver to react and it was enough to miss the tree. She knocked Connie out of the way and she was hit by the car instead. She was impaled on a fence that is no longer there. Fiadh, the Banshee, started crying with her then girlfriend Cindy.”

They are never wrong. “She died.  Skerrit told me of this to some extent.”

The queen nods. “The EMTs had turned off the lights and had called her in as dead. I told Thanatos no.  He backed off and let her choose. She chose me.”

My guide dabs an eye. “Wow. I think I know why you two are dating.”

She smiles, “Engaged now. And no, it took me 6 months to finally get my head wrapped around loving that wonderful woman. I’m not a smart woman. Back to Connie, that wonderful tree nymph felt like I paid her debt, and she was falling for me.”

I laugh. The allure of this woman is not lost on me.

“Before I forget, it is your turn to ask a question.  Please do so, good Queen of the Evergreen.”

“What should we call you?” She smiles.

I nod. This question is what they ask everyone. I know who came up with the phrasing immediately.  “Laoch.”

She smiles. “I am pleased to call you that and friend, if you would have me.”

“I would be honored.” I mean this. She is formidable and caring.

We take our leave shortly before Ms Jackie returns, better to avoid her eyes than risk whatever scheme she has for me.

 

# Jan 05, 2025: Jackie Flynn           

*Human Arch Warlock Human Torch*

7 more of them. I feel like this may be Déjà vu. Pat and I smile at them. “Hey guys, wanna see something hilarious?” I call out.

One of them nods. He has a cup of coffee from the shop. Heh. Wait, Trevor?

I grab Pats hand and pull her into the FeaWylds with me. “Let’s fly home. We can get there from here, easy peasy.”

Pat looks at me with those green fire opal eyes that are so her and laughs. “Those poor guys are gonna get chewed out.

“Fuck em. Least they get to live. I like Trevor.” I laugh and make myself wings of fire. “Let’s go babe!”

We begin flying home.

 

# Jan 05, 2025: Connie the Merciless

*Wood Nymph aka Dryad*

I am playing my flute and vibing with a few of the pack left here when the ladies step out. The guys that were joking with me shift gears. Jackie calls out to them.  And then, poof, the ladies cross over and I almost laugh.

One of the pack gets mad. Like stupid mad. He punches my tree. I stop playing my flute.

“Please don’t do that.” I put on my best stern voice.

He whips around and yells at me. “What are you gonna do, nympho?”

Trevor steps back. The man still has his coffee and he is here enough to not want to fuck around with us. “Bill, drop it and apologize to Connie. Please.”

“You said please. You never say please.” Bill sounds confused. But not wary. Poor Bill.

“It is important. Like, your life important.”

Bill decides that the best way to handle that is to choose violence. Instead of apologizing, he whips it out and pees on my tree. Fucker thinks he can mark me. MARK ME. AS HIS DOMAIN. ASSERT DOMINANCE OVER MY QUEEN?!?! OH MOTHER FUCKER YOU WILL NOT!!!

Trevor jumps back. I believe sees my rage and he knows what is about to happen. He wants no part of it. Smart man, just saved at least one life. I play my flute.

A tree root shoots out and up. Directly up into Bill’s bladder through the very part that is peeing on my tree. Like some horrible fish going upstream. Plugging the way as it goes. It begins expanding inside his bladder. It will look for a new path to take soon. He can feel that. All of Bill’s friends stop and stare in horror. I smile. Bill decides to go with screams.

“Bill, darling, I don’t believe my tree wants a dog marking it. It, and I, aren’t owned by you. Got me?”

I wait a few seconds.  He’s still screaming in pain. Ugh. “Please stop screaming and nod or shake your head when I am expecting a response.  DO YOU GOT ME?”

He nods.

GOOD. I whisper the next part.

“By peeing on my tree, you were marking my tree as yours. That tree belongs to Patricia, MY LADY. The Evergreen Queen. I am HERS, NOT YOURS. If you ever, EVER attempt to assert dominance over my queen in any manner again, you will be a new addition to my grove, just like the three dead members of your moron alpha’s pack were. You will feel your body trying to fix the damage as a tree slowly and inevitably uses you as plant food and no power in ANY realm will stop me. Do I make myself clear, Bill, darling?”

He nods. Pretty sure if the apparatus wasn’t plugged right now he’d pee himself. I smile.

Trevor shudders.

I withdraw the root.

Slowly.

Werewolf regeneration allows him to heal that invasion of his privacy, or better worded, his privates. “See? I can be nice.”

“You little WHOOOOOOOF.”

Trevor hits him in the stomach hard enough to have him clear his height with his feet before he lands in a heap.

“Connie, good lady, please ignore this whelp and do accept our apology. We are leaving.”

I wink. “Trevor, dear, good job saving his life.  Please let your boss and pack understand, I am a baby by our standards. I am also a speck when compared to either of the ladies that did you all a favor by leaving instead of dealing with you.”

I point to the root that is still in front of Bill.  “As I told this moron, arrows made from me killed 3 of your kind. They are now trees on the roof of an apartment building. Imagine what I can do if I fight.”

Trevor nods.  “Be horrible, I imagine.”

I smile. “The Evergreen Queen and her consort make me look like an insect in comparison.  They are so far above me that the best analogy for you is this: I am a pothole in your path to power.  You can remove me or step around me with some effort. They are the Grand Canyon.”

1pev4hb,https://www.reddit.com/r/pourover/comments/1pev4hb/hario_switch_breakthrough/,Hario Switch Breakthrough,"Just wanted to share a breakthrough I’ve had with the switch, haven’t really seen this technique discussed, produces amazing results for me.

Essentially it’s about the foam. I remember watching James Hoffman’s french press video years back and wondering why he recommended scooping the foam off early on.

Then I noticed Lance Hendrick has recently been talking a lot about crema in espresso, how all it adds flavour wise is essentially perceived bitterness from CO2 and acrid tasting compounds.

Since foam in a pour over / immersion is the low pressure version of crema, I thought I’d try a hybrid technique 

1:18 ratio, 95C water, medium grind size (80 on K6)

Poured appx 120ml with switch closed, stirred and let sit for 4 minutes. Scooped off all the foam / crust until only a clear liquid remained.

Switch open, close again when drained. Then another pour with the remaining water, quick stir and foam scoop (although there was minimal foam here)

I tasted the foam I removed and it was really intense harsh / bitterness 

The coffee in the cup was some of the best I’ve tasted, bearing in mind roast date was only 4 days ago. 

Prior to this I was struggling a bit with a bitter note in the cup concealing other flavours (with various batches of different beans)

Just thought I’d share in case anyone finds this useful ",11,1764941483.0,pourover,5,0.92,False

if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

1pev2lm,https://i.redd.it/339i79xp0e5g1.png,Housewife to Mafia Queen: His So-Called 'Trophy Wife' Now Runs His World,"Because her husband liked his women submissive, Josephine Quinn buried her identity as the heiress to the biggest crime syndicate in the Mississippi Delta, playing the role of Gavin York's trophy wife for three years.





Three years of marriage, and Gavin started looking down on her, calling her a clinging vine, only to turn around and fall for a female special ops soldier—Sonia Frost.





The first time, Josephine caught Sonia straddling Gavin's lap. They claimed it was just ""brotherly bonding"".





The second time, during a mission, allegedly to ""dodge an undercover agent"", they made out in broad daylight for three hours.





The third time was the day of Josephine's parents' funeral.





That day, Josephine traveled alone to the Delta to bring back the ashes of her parents, who had died in an accident.





Her eight uncles—the Council of the Family—held a solemn memorial service.





The eldest uncle handed her father's service pistol and told her that from this moment on, she was no longer just the Mafia Princess—she was the Commander of the entire territory.





Through it all, her husband, Gavin, was nowhere to be seen. And when she questioned him later, he had the nerve to scold her.





""Sonia is tough, Josephine. If she hadn't injured her hand and needed the hospital... You called me 99 times just for a funeral? When are you going to grow up?""





Grow up?





Josephine almost laughed out loud. ""You're my husband, you're practically sleeping with your 'buddy' Sonia, and you're telling me to grow up?""





Gavin's face darkened. ""Sleeping together? We are innocent! Josephine, keep your dirty thoughts to yourself.""





""You're just a housewife. You couldn't possibly understand the bond of brothers in arms that Sonia and I share!""





Brothers in arms?





Thinking of her husband's position as a SWAT captain, Josephine swallowed her anger.





Until today. She walked into the precinct with coffee for the team, only to hear a roar of laughter from inside.





""Gavin, your wife is such a delicate little flower. A total housewife. She's got nothing on Sonia's independence and grit!""





""Better be careful, though. Sonia's proud. If she finds out, she's gonna raise hell.""





Josephine's eyes flickered. She froze. Then, she heard Gavin's voice.





""She won't. Sonia is Ivy League, she has a career,"" the man said with a careless coldness. ""As for raising hell? Josephine doesn't even compare. She's just a parasitic flower that can't live without a man.""





A parasitic flower?





That single phrase sent a wave of absurdity washing over Josephine. She felt a bitter sense of irony.





Irony that she had been blind to the truth. Irony that she had loved the wrong man.





Irony that Gavin mocked her as useless, never knowing she was a National Valedictorian, a top-tier university grad, and an expert in combat and marksmanship.





Before she took power, she had neutralized more traitors than he had ever met people!





But she had never told him any of this.





She thought love was a harbor where she could take off her armor and just be an ordinary woman.





Now she realized, she hadn't taken off her armor, she had stripped away her dignity.





Taking a deep breath, she turned around and dialed a hidden number in her encrypted contacts.





The call connected instantly. A powerful, gravelly voice came through, ""Josh! Is that you? Are you finally ready to come back and take the throne?""





""Uncle..."" Josephine's voice was raspy but unnervingly calm. ""I'm coming home in three days.""





""Fantastic!"" The excitement of her eight uncles was palpable. ""I knew you wouldn't play 'housewife' with that pretty boy forever. The Family welcomes you home! I'm arranging the private jet right now!""





""Good."" Josephine hung up. The last shred of hesitation in her chest vanished.





She packed her bags and went straight to a nightclub owned by the Family, picking out a dozen sleek, handsome escorts to help her shop for new clothes.





For years, her wardrobe had been nothing but aprons and drab colors—gray, black, pale white.





Outfits that toggled between ""good girl"" and ""middle-aged matron"", conservative, with absolutely zero edge.





Because that was what Gavin liked—obedient, weak, easy to control. He liked it, so she had happily worn the mask for love.





Until now. The hibernation was over. It was time to shed the costume.





Minutes later, she stepped out in a tailored black suit over a simple V-neck camisole. Her delicate collarbones flashed as she moved, radiating a cold, imposing glamour.





""Miss Quinn, this outfit was made for you!"" The escorts wagged their tails, eager for her attention.





Josephine curled her lips in a faint smile and gave a subtle signal. The sharp-eyed boys immediately went to pay the bill.





This was the true face of the heiress. Relaxed, she walked out of the club, just as her phone buzzed.





""Josephine,"" Gavin's suppressed rage crackled through the speaker, ""why aren't you home making dinner yet?""





Josephine was mildly surprised. Gavin... why was he home so early today?





But they did have a score to settle.





She returned home. Before she could even pull out the prepared divorce papers...





Click. The bedroom door opened.





A half-naked woman walked out of their marital bedroom.





Chapter 2





She was dressed similarly to Josephine's new look—sharp, capable, heroic.





She looked at Josephine in surprise. ""Josephine, you...""





After a double-take, she pouted in annoyance. ""You... why are you copying my style?""





""Copying you?""





Josephine looked at the special ops soldier who had just broken her heart. With lips red as fire, she raised a corner of her mouth in mockery.





Ignoring her completely, she walked straight past.





Gavin finally heard the commotion. His handsome brows furrowed tight as he turned.





Then, he froze.





His gaze locked onto her high ponytail, the sharp cut of her trousers, and the glimpse of her collarbone.





In those eyes, usually so full of self-righteousness, a flash of awe appeared—only to instantly turn into a sneer.





""Sonia was right. What kind of game are you playing now to get my attention?""





""A cheap imitation?""





""This is who I've always been. If anyone's the cheap knockoff, it's her.""





Josephine sat on the sofa opposite him, her gaze cold. ""Also, without my permission, why did she just walk out of my room?""





Gavin's eyes flickered slightly.





Hearing this, he scoffed. ""What, using your petty little mind to judge me and Sonia again?""





""The heating at Sonia's barracks is broken. She's crashing here for a couple of days.""





""Why are you still standing there? Go make dinner!""





Without waiting for an answer, he naturally draped a coat over Sonia's shoulders and asked, ""I packed your stuff. How many days of leave did the team give you this time?""





Sonia's voice was crisp and bright. ""Just a few days. I have to join the Operation Thunder joint exercise soon.""





""I heard from the top brass that the Mississippi Family has a new successor. Codename: Falcon.""





""Sounds like a tough nut to crack. I don't know what our odds are against her...""





Gavin comforted her. ""Figures like Falcon are once-in-a-century. Don't stress yourself out. You're the youngest elite soldier in the country. Unlike Josephine, who can't even lift a grocery bag...""





""Simply...""





Useless.





He didn't finish the sentence, but Josephine knew exactly what he meant.





She couldn't be bothered to look at this pair of ""brothers"". She tossed the divorce papers at Gavin and turned to leave.





Gavin finally realized she was unusually cold today. Ignoring the papers flying at him, he frowned. ""Josephine, where are you going?""





""Out to get divorced.""





Gavin froze for a second, then his sneer deepened.





""Everything is fine, what kind of joke is this?""





""Or do you think, Josephine, that changing your clothes gives you a spine? You think you can survive without me?""





""Yeah, Josephine. Even if you copy me, you only copied my clothes, not my core strength.""





""That's not something a housewife like you can learn overnight. Besides...""





She draped her arm affectionately around Gavin's neck. ""If you're doing this because you suspect something between me and Gavin, that's just pathetic.""





""I'm not like you, a woman who relies on men. I went to a top university, I'm trained, and I've always relied on my own two hands!""





Relied on her own two hands?





Josephine looked at their intertwined fingers and let out a cold laugh.





Perhaps because she didn't react, half a minute later, Gavin served the soup himself.





He ladled a huge bowl for Sonia first, blowing on it carefully, terrified his ""bro"" might get burned.





He even rarely filled a bowl for his wife.





But Josephine didn't take a sip. She quietly watched this man she had been married to for years, who once cared for her deeply.





She smiled. ""Gavin, you really are a great 'brother'.""





Gavin paused, clearly not expecting her to say that.





Josephine didn't want to beat around the bush anymore. She pushed the divorce agreement forward. ""Gavin, we are gett—""





Before she could finish, the entire building suddenly shook with a violent, tooth-aching tremor!





Tables danced wildly, plaster rained down, and screams erupted from outside!





Earthquake!





Chapter 3





Gavin's face went pale!





Forgetting the papers, he instantly grabbed Sonia, who was closest to him, and shielded her tightly in his arms.





But Josephine, just across the square table, was subconsciously ignored.





Three years ago, at this very table, they had toasted friends and family and said their vows.





It had only been three years.





Through the thin table and the settling dust, she locked eyes with him.





Only three years.





""Did you get hurt?""





Only when the tremors stopped did Gavin release Sonia. His first words were not for his wife.





Sonia shook her head, eyes flickering, face pale. ""I'm fine, Gavin, what about you...""





""I'm fine too,"" Gavin interrupted.





Only then, as if suddenly remembering something, did he look at Josephine, who was still standing there.





""Josephine, I didn't mean to ignore you just now. But Sonia is a key member of my team, a model citizen, and you...""





He sighed deeply. ""I'm sorry, Josephine. You know your value, so you should understand. I have to prioritize.""





Josephine didn't speak. She just gave him a long, hard look.





Then, she turned and swiftly pulled a pre-packed tactical bug-out bag from the closet. Her movements were too practiced for a housewife.





Before Gavin could be surprised, piercing air raid sirens screamed across the city.





Aftershocks continued. Their apartment building hadn't collapsed, but it was structurally compromised.





Gavin's team received emergency mobilization orders.





""I need to report for rescue duty immediately."" He quickly changed into his fatigues, saying gravely to Sonia, ""Stay close to me later. Safety first!""





""I'm coming too,"" Josephine finally spoke.





As she spoke, she stood amidst the debris, capable and lazy in her confidence.





Gavin was dazed for a moment seeing her like that.





But snapping back to reality, he looked back at her like he'd heard a joke. ""What for? Don't cause trouble. Stay put at the shelter!""





""Why? Can't I go out for some fresh air?"" Josephine slowly unbuttoned her collar, her tone yielding nothing.





During an earthquake, staying in a damaged building was the real danger.





Sonia intervened smoothly. ""Gavin, let Josephine come. The shelter needs volunteers too.""





Once she spoke, Gavin stopped arguing and silently agreed with a cold face.





At the epicenter, everything was blood and screams.





It was Sonia's first time seeing such a bloody disaster scene. Seeing a severed limb, she gagged and nearly vomited.





She leaned heavily into Gavin's chest. ""Gavin, I...""





Gavin instinctively held her.





Holding her, he thought of Josephine nearby. ""Josephine, Sonia's not doing well. For safety, I can't take care of two people at once.""





""Sonia stays. You go home. You're just a housewife, you'd only be in the way...""





Before he finished, Josephine had already charged into the disaster zone.





For three years, she had hidden her edge, a sheathed blade gathering dust for his sake.





Now the sheath was broken. It was time for the blade to shine.





Evacuating civilians, comforting children, clearing bodies, digging people out with her bare hands.





Years in the Mississippi syndicate, after countless turf wars, she had collected the bodies of her people just like this.





Amidst the praise, Sonia watched Josephine in the center of the rescue effort, a trace of jealousy in her eyes.





She approached with a basin of hot water, looking at Josephine's bloody hands with a sneer.





""Josephine, why fake it just to copy me?""





""I told you Gavin and I are bros. Look at you, covered in dirt, digging up corpses. If I were you, I'd be too ashamed to delay the real work here...""





Normally, Josephine would have slapped anyone who provoked her like this.





But now, with lives in her hands, however cold-blooded she was, she had no time to argue.





Sonia, annoyed at being ignored, grew angry.





Her eyes darted around, and without warning, she splashed the basin of scalding water right at Josephine's face!

Its been pretty rough, but i'm now at a point where, while not entirely without cravings, they are much less frequent and I feel can be filled with pretty much anything. Tea, coffee, cold water, crisps, fizzy drinks, listening to music etc. It's an indistinct ""urge"" for something, but it no longer leads my thoughts straight to vaping.
To someone just starting, or thinking about it, i'm telling you to do it. Especially if you're adhd or autistic. You don't realise how uncomfortable it's making you every day. The constant cravings will stop you ever feeling normal, rested, relaxed. Even if you WFH/outside and can vape all day every day. It creates an underlying tension in you every single day. 
Now i get more done, i can relax, i can enjoy the feeling of the winter air in my lungs. 
In a week the worst of it will
be over. In two weeks you will better still. In three weeks you might be tested. In 6 weeks you are basically done, and you will
be able to look at it and fail to understand how you let it change the way you think.
You've got this - you're a moment away from being free.

Worth noting: I have always felt cravings for something, regardless of any prior addiction. Just an indistinct urge/discomfort for something- i think im prone to addiction bc of this. Remembering i can channel this energy positively is hugely useful. This energy could be used to make or do something. Nicotine can be very placating ",3,1764941238.0,QuitVaping,5,1.0,False

1peuz66,https://www.reddit.com/r/MaximizeMe/comments/1peuz66/upgrade_your_life_20_simple_hacks_for_maximum/,Upgrade Your Life 2.0! 🚀 Simple Hacks for Maximum Growth & Happiness. ✨🧠,"Hey Maximizame fam,

Ever feel like you're running on an outdated operating system? Like you're stuck on 'Life 1.0' and ready for a patch update, but can't find the 'download' button? I've been there.

The truth is, the upgrade doesn't come from one massive, life-altering event. It comes from installing small, simple 'patches' that lead to huge performance boosts over time. It's less about a total system overhaul and more about smart, consistent tweaks.

Here are a few simple hacks that have seriously helped me boost my own growth and happiness:

*   **The ""Win"" Log.** Before you go to bed, write down *one* thing that went well that day. Seriously, just one. Made a perfect cup of coffee? Nailed a 2-minute conversation? Found a great parking spot? Write it down. It trains your brain to hunt for the positive, and that is a massive happiness boost.

*   **The 5-Minute Start.** Procrastination is the ultimate enemy of growth. The next time you're dreading a task (working out, cleaning, that project you've been avoiding), just commit to doing it for five minutes. That's it. More often than not, starting is the hardest part, and after five minutes, you'll have the momentum to keep going.

*   **""Future You"" Favors.** Do one tiny thing today that your future self will thank you for. Lay out your clothes for tomorrow. Pack your lunch. Tidy your desk for 60 seconds before you log off. These small acts of kindness to your future self reduce friction and make your days run smoother.

Of course, upgrading your mental software isn't always a smooth process. Sometimes you hit bugs and old emotional code that makes you want to crash. It’s totally normal. Managing the emotional side of growth is just as important as the actions you take. For those moments when you feel stuck and need a clearer roadmap for your thoughts and feelings, I found **this resource (affiliate link)** to be a game-changer for building a solid mental plan.

It's all about those small inputs for maximum output. These are just a few things that have worked for me.

So, what's one simple 'hack' that's made a real difference in your journey? Let's build a master list in the comments",1,1764941091.0,MaximizeMe,0,1.0,False

That should have been the end of it.

Instead:

On Nov 30, their system suddenly marked the payment as “failed,” even though the charge from Nov 15 was already processed and visible on my bank statement.

On Dec 4, they charged me again — basically a second payment for the same month’s coffees. 

When I reached out, it took several days to get replies, and the responses were generic and didn’t address what I actually asked. 

They acknowledged and removed one duplicate order, but not the duplicate charge, so I’ve essentially paid for coffee I never received and when I ask them if I will receive the coffee I paid for on Nov 15th I don’t get a answer. 

I’ve followed up multiple times, but the communication is slow and doesn’t seem to engage with what I’m explaining.

🙌**Come hang out at Perfect World Brewing, Albany’s alleyway of excellence!**

If you’re in the mood to explore a new local spot, we’d be thrilled to have you. Whether you’re into coffee-forward dark beers, citrusy hazys, wild forage, or clean lagers, we’ve got something worth trying. I’ll be behind the bar on Saturdays so come say hi, grab a pint, and help support a new Albany spot.

🍻**What’s on tap (Albany’s finest distractions from local chaos)**

* **Too Much Coffee Porter** For people who say “I’ve had enough coffee” and immediately know they’re lying.
* **Extraordinary Citrus NEIPA**– Hazy, juicy, and tropical with a bright citrus aroma.
* **Wild-Foraged Saskatoon Berry Lager** Foraged responsibly unlike the way people drink it. Subtle, fruity, and slightly confusing.
* **Proper Lager**– Clean, crisp, refreshing, free of bitterness… exactly what a lager *should* taste like

📍**Bravely located at**  
**1276 Broadway, Albany, NY**

🕓**Saturday Hours**

*(10:00am to 4:00pm. Possibly later depending on fun levels)*

**Perfect World Brewing**— The only place where the alley is a “feature”, the neighborhood is irrelevant, and the beer is actually good.

I’ll be there pouring and chatting — happy to give tastes, talk about the brews, and meet more people. If you’ve got questions about the beers, our space, or upcoming events, drop them below. Hope to see you all on Saturday!

I’ve spent way too much time in the kitchen the past few weeks testing anything and everything pour over, so I started making cups with the MCU at the same time as my pourovers. 

Using identical grind size and ratio, the Bunn makes a much stronger and more bitter tasting cup than the pour over. Increasing grind size has helped a lot with the bitterness, but it still isn’t quite as sweet and fruity as my pour over.

I’m confused by this. The Bunn makes coffee much faster than the pour over, so in theory I assumed it would probably underextract, but it seems to overextract. Not sure I’m using these terms correctly, it’s just that I prefer the taste of the bloom/early part of the pours vs the later stages.

1peuvyc,https://www.reddit.com/r/TJPW/comments/1peuvyc/ocha_norma_and_their_tjpw_collab/,OCHA NORMA and their TJPW collab,"**What is OCHA NORMA?**

OCHA NORMA is a Japanese female idol J-pop group established in 2021.  They are a creation of UP FRONT PRODUCTIONS. Who organized the group and currently manages it.  UP FRONT PRODUCTIONS is also the umbrella corporation for a number of smaller entertainment agencies whose female idols are collectively known as HELLO! Project.  Additionally, UP FRONT PRODUCTIONS is responsible for creating Morning MUSUME, which is generally considered as the spark that lit the current female idol group trend. 

 

**Who are OCHA NORMA?**

The group, OCHA NORMA, originally had 10 women but presently consists of 8, each with their own identifying color.  Leader Madoka Saito (Sea Blue), Sub leader Ruri Hiromoto (Yellow), as well as regular members Kirara Yonemura (Italian red), Nanami Kubota (Pink), Natsume Nakayama (White), Miku Nishizaki (Purple), Momo Kitahara (Light Green), and Roko Tsutsui (Royal Blue). They have released 5 singles thus far starting with “Mado no Crouching Start / Omatsuri Debut da ze!” in 2022.  All their singles have made the top 5 on the Japanese music charts.  You can check out a number of Music videos for their singles and b-sides here: [https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLHdMoq6t0XIA5JLPo-SyTTqEByvdu1cGA](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLHdMoq6t0XIA5JLPo-SyTTqEByvdu1cGA)

 

**Why OCHA NORMA x TJPW?**

It’s no secret that many of Tokyo Joshi’s wrestlers are j-pop and or k-pop idol fans.  Several of them are openly fans of OCHA NORMA specifically and have attended concerts and purchased OCHA NORMA music and merchandise.  What some of the western fanbase may not know, is that one of the members of OCHA NORMA, Natsume Nakayama is reciprocally a huge fan of wrestling, specifically of Tokyo Joshi.  To date she has attended numerous Tokyo Joshi shows as an audience member when time permits and usually makes posts about her experiences on her personal blog. This fact did not go unnoticed by ToJo staff and wrestlers, and OCHA NORMA and Tokyo Joshi were able to negotiate arrangements in order to have Nakayama appear on commentary as a special guest for some of Tokyo Joshi’s shows as well as have collaborative interviews with her and some Tokyo Joshi roster members.  To give an example of Nakayama’s fandom, here she is recognizing that Rika Tatsumi is participating in an online signing for her as they read through fan messages:  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cq-ud5eNQmQ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cq-ud5eNQmQ)

 

A lesser but still notable fact that may have played a role in the development of this show is that YU-M entertainment, the management company of the Up Up Girls, is a subsidiary of UP FRONT PRODUCTION so the Up Up Girls and OCHA NORMA are maybe not sister groups, but cousin groups.

 

**What to expect at TJPW x OCHA NORMA?**

Much of the show has been announced at this point.  We know for certain we are getting 2 OCHA NORMA mini performances that are expected to be between 20 to 25 minutes each.  It was announced that commentary would be broadcast throughout the arena for 1 match on the card, also that Natsume Nakayama would once again appear as a guest commentator and an MC would be present throughout the show.  This also means that it is highly unlikely that this show will feature English commentary.  Further, it was stated that OCHA NORMA leader, Madoka Saito, would appear as a special ring announcer for one match on the card.  The Up Up Girls as scheduled to perform at the show. Moreover, they will do 1 cover of an OCHA NORMA song, but which song will likely remain a mystery until the show.  There may be more segments featuring OCHA NORMA individually or with various members of the Tokyo Joshi roster that have yet to be announced.  As for wrestling, as previously mentioned, the card will consist of 5 matches.  There will be no title matches and all matches will be either 6-woman tag or standard tag matches.  The card is as follows:

 

* Arisu Endo ＆ Uta Takami　vs　HIMAWARI ＆ Haru Kazashiro
* Ryo Mizunami, Raku ＆ Harajuku Pom　vs　Mahiro Kiryu, Shino Suzuki ＆ Chika Nanase
* Ochano Mask ＆ Kaya Toribami　vs　Wakana Uehara ＆ Ren Konatsu
* *The Official Ochapro Army vs Coffee BREAKERS -*  Miyu Yamashita, Rika Tatsumi ＆ Mifu Ashida　vs　Hyper Misao, Yuki Kamifuku ＆ Kira Summer
* Miu Watanabe ＆ Yuki Aino ＆ Toga　vs　Mizuki ＆ Suzume ＆ Yuki Arai

 

 

Those wanting to watch this on Wrestle UNIVERSE don’t forget that this is a PPV show, you’ll need to purchase it separately from your normal WU subscription to watch it live.  It is likely that the show will eventually become free after some time, maybe a month or more afterwards? However, since OCHA NORMA’s management runs their business similarly to how SKE48 runs theirs, this PPV will likely, similar to the Yuki Arai SKE48 graduation show, have all its idol performances cut prior it being released for free viewing.  This isn't a certainty, but its a strong possibility.  Thus, if you want to be guaranteed to see the full show, it’s best to purchase the live stream rather than wait for the free version.

I am a 31 year old man. I work in tech as a Devops engineer in Bangalore. I'm looking for someone based in Bangalore, with whom I can be friends with first and then if we vibe, turn it to a long term relationship. 

I'm 5'11"", well built, active with workouts and play badminton. I look younger than my age. I love football, traveling and also trying my hand with cooking. 
I'm a non-vegetarian and I'm originally from Kerala. I don't have any restrictions on where you are actually from as long as you match what I'm looking for and live in Bangalore. 

My type of woman is someone who is emotionally intelligent, chatty, empathetic and can communicate well.
Prefer someone who is working, and can manage their own expenses. It doesn't mean you won't receive the occasional surprises but I want to ensure that you are someone who is financially stable enough to survive on your own. Also I prefer someone who is into fitness, if not already, then plan to be. We could be workout partners and hype each other up and grow together :) 

We could go out together, try out different variety of food, taste coffee, watch movies, travel to different places, and try out new things and experiences. 

I could say a lot of fancy things to attract you, but I would rather not do that and over commit giving you false hope. I would rather build a relationship with a strong foundation based on understanding and the person who you are. Loyalty and trust is important to me.

1peuuun,https://i.redd.it/9be1no7pyd5g1.jpeg,"Back then, both our family doctor and our dentist worked out of their homes...","Good morning! Most of my friends and I are now at an age where many of our conversations includes discussions regarding out current health issues, and which doctor (that's w-h-i-c-h doctor, not w-i-t-c-h doctor — although on certain days, a little magic and chanting wouldn’t go amiss ) is attending to our ailments.

One such recent talk on this very subject sent me wandering back to thoughts of my childhood doctors. Back then, both our family doctor and our dentist worked out of their homes, the same way other people might run a small accounting office. Their waiting rooms were really just converted living rooms, and both of them knew every one of us by name—our parents, our siblings, and probably even the family pets if they were mentioned often enough. They could speak to us on a personal level as well as a professional one, which made going to the doctor feel slightly less like a medical appointment and slightly more like dropping by a neighbor’s house who just happened to own a stethoscope.

I vividly remember being in my late twenties when I managed to dislocate my shoulder in a way that can only be described as spectacularly inconvenient. I drove myself to the doctor’s office in a vehicle with a 4-speed manual transmission, shifting gears and steering one-handed. By some miracle, I made it and was seen right away. This was a man who had known me for over twenty years, and he slipped straight into the same easy small talk he always used, even as he was rotating my arm through a range of motion that would have made a medieval torturer look on admiringly and start taking notes.

“How’s your mother?... how’s your father?... your dad’s boat still running well these days?” he asked with the same calm tone someone might use while stirring sugar into their coffee. I gritted my teeth, fighting waves of nausea, and gave brief responses, nodding where appropriate, until—at last—my shoulder made a loud pop, and my arm practically sucked itself back into its socket like it had suddenly decided it had found the place it was looking for. The relief was immense. Still painful, mind you, but no longer as wildly painful as it had been. I’ve endured many physical trials and injuries over the years, but dislocations (of which I've had several—more on that another day—) are one of my least favorites. To this day, I remain grateful for that doctor’s cool, matter-of-fact manner and his uncanny ability to distract me as he worked.

He retired long ago and has since passed on, and the doctor who replaced him eventually retired as well. Happily, my current doctor is a young woman who is unlikely to retire during my lifetime—something that brings me comfort. She may not know me quite as well as the first two did, but she’s steady, kind, competent, and entirely professional. In short, she’s a peach, and I feel safe under her care. And at this stage of life, that’s worth its weight in gold—or at least worth a few conversations about ailments at the next gathering with friends.

This morning my CN wife had to be awake “early” (meaning 7 AM). 

I had my breakfast in the dining room because the kitchen table was covered in stuff. The only place to eat there was right in front of the coffee maker, so me sitting there would block her access to coffee. The dining room table was cleaner, so I ate there. It is a “dining” room, y’know. 

Well, she didn’t see me jn there, and I kinda surprised her when I walked out. She got all angry at me and demanded to know why I ate there - and it was clear why she got mad: I startled her, so the totally normal thing I had done became a problem. I should not have eaten in the DR because it led to her being startled. 

Things like this are small in themselves, but they totally reveal the underlying issue. She is the Important Person, and everything else exists to support her and not to interfere. So much so that even me eating at the dining room table is a problem when she doesn’t like how it ended up for her.

( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

Here is no Question of Holy Books quotes, Personal Experiences, Faith or Belief. i accept that Sometimes Faith is also Blind. Here is already Practical explanation which already proved that every\`1 else in this world is nothing more then Busy Foolish and totally idiot.

every \`1 is already Blind in this world and if you will follow another Blind then you both will fall in hole. so try to follow that person who have Spiritual Eyes who can Guide you on Actual Right Path. ( my Authority & Guide is my Spiritual Master "" Srila Prabhupada "" )

( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

I consider him a friend.

we are gonna meet at his house to do some crafts (he sews and makes cosplay, i crochet) and to keep talking

One thing though, I’m 20 and he’s 28. He‘s a lot bigger than me and clearly stronger (big arm muscles) and that in itself makes me worried to go into his house. I get iffy around men because of previous trauma. i usually go to someone’s house when i’ve seen them multiple times in person and feel mostly comfortable around them in real life. but ive only seen him irl twice and known him for a little over a month. naturally, im nervous to go into his house, in public was fine as i have an escape route just in case and im around people.

i really want to go though, im going to be teaching him crochet and hes going to show me how to use the sewing machine, and we’re gonna have a chill afternoon making our projects.

what are some precautions i can take to ease my worries of going into his house? i will be taking a small can of deodorant as a pepperspray alternative as i live in the uk, but what else should i keep in mind just in case? it feels silly preparing self defence to go to a friend’s house, but i am a very anxious person and cant help but take some precautions. better to be safe than sorry right? what can i consider as an escape route just in case i am locked inside his house and i need to get out? should i tell him i’m nervous because of past experiences?",1,1764940191.0,TheGirlSurvivalGuide,8,1.0,False

1peullc,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1peullc,Where Can One Find Sources of Quality Inexpensive Coffee? [budget less than $12/12 oz],"With rising coffee prices, it's becoming difficult to find sources of inexpensive quality coffee for espresso and drip.

In my search I've found a few of three interesting places that sell coffee for less than $12/12 oz. Don't thinks any of them have been discussed.

The first is Truck Stop Organics in upstate Michigan https://www.truckstoporganics.com/ The 12 oz bags are $8.99 each (shipping is 4.99 for the 1st and 2nd bag) and a subscription of 3-pack 12 oz bags monthly delivery for $33.00 with free shipping.  There is also a higher priced Roaster Jack Coffee Company  https://www.roasterjack.com/  Despite being around for quite a while, I can't seem to find any reviews.  Anybody ordered from them?

I also want to give a shout out to a wonderful shop in downtown Pittsburgh, PA.  Nicholas Coffee and Tea has been around since 1919 selling on-site roasted coffee (see photos).  About 10 years ago I bought some excellent espresso and French roast.  The coffee starts at $15.19 per 16 oz. for blends, with a wide selection of other roasts and flavors. Great reviews on Google and Yelp.

Finally, Atlanta Coffee Roasters (https://atlantacoffeeroasters.com/) sells a large number of coffees, starting at 12.99 per 16 oz. As they're local, I've been there a couple of times and enjoyed my coffees. 

Perhaps others could share their experiences with these three companies.

When Elaine had received the notification letter informing her that she was assigned to the Secret Service field office in Great Falls, Montana, she tried to keep her chin up.  She had known she would be sent to the least desirable location in the country, that it was standard practice for all new Special Agents.

Shivering as she locked her beat-up Toyota, she told herself she could stand living in Great Falls for a year or two, and to make the best of it.  *Look at the bright side,* she thought.  *It’s a small town.  People will be a lot friendlier than in Pittsburgh.*

“You can’t park your fuckin’ car there, lady.”

Elaine turned around—there was a blubbery man shoveling snow off the sidewalk, a cigar jutting from his mouth.  “What’s the matter with you, can’t you read?” he said, pointing at the NO PARKING sign.

*Well,* she thought, ‘*most’* *people were probably more friendly than in Pittsburgh.*  She moved her car down one space.

For her first day at work, she had bought a new navy blue business suit and had her hair styled.  When the dumpy receptionist ushered Elaine into the office of the SAIC—the Special Agent In Charge—the man slowly rose from his desk, staring at her.

“Ms. Brogan?” he said.  His eyes moving down to her legs, her shoes, then back up to her face.

“Nice to meet you,” she said, shaking his hand.  

“I didn’t know you were...” The receptionist was standing there, watching him ogle Elaine.  He glanced at her, his face red.  “Thank you, Susan.  That will be all.”

Susan left, giving him a dirty look.

The SAIC’s name was Bill Saunders.  He began making nervous small talk, telling Elaine about the new-fangled office, which had only been established in Great Falls a year ago.  He was about thirty-five years old, had a pot belly, was nearly bald, and what little hair he had left was speckled with dandruff.  Elaine noticed that he was wearing a wedding band, which she thought was a good thing—the excitement she sensed in him had raised alarm bells in her mind.

He outlined her responsibilities, and mentioned that there would be a lot more training on “corporate stuff,” such as Ethics, Diversity, and Interpersonal Awareness.

Near the end of the meeting, Elaine asked, “Will there be time for me to work on some of my own cases?” 

“Your ‘own’ cases?  How do you mean?”

Elaine shrugged.  “Cases that originate from my own leads, maybe cases in other states.”

“Trying to get out of Great Falls already?” he said, smiling.

“No, I just—”

“I don’t see why you can’t work on outside cases.  As long as you get your required work done, do your DOPS.”

“My—DOPS?”

“Daily Operation Summaries.”

“Oh.”

“Anyway, as long as you get your required work done, I don’t see it as a problem.”



\* \* \*

Elaine spent the first few weeks settling in.  There was only one other field agent working out of the new office, Ken, a man who had been with the Service only two years.  A former Chicago police detective, he had a lot of experience and he spent much of his time working alone.  Most of the activity in the Great Falls office concerned financial fraud, counterfeit checks, and Internet account hacking.  Great Falls, Montana, was not the center of the world’s illegal currency counterfeiting activity.  Or the center of anything else, it seemed.

Bill Saunders seemed to make constant excuses to go into Elaine’s office and talk to her, or call her into his.  When he had to pick up a file or get his coffee cup, he would move uncomfortably close to her, sometimes “accidentally” brushing up against her.  She noticed that he often discreetly inhaled when he did this, as if savoring the smell of her perfume.

One evening they were going over a list of banks in Montana that had been receiving a certain type of fake check, Bill reached over and took her hand.  

“Elaine,” he said, his voice wavering, “I have to tell you something.”

“Don’t,” she said, pulling her hand away.  She had been expecting this ever since the first day.  She glanced at his open office door, afraid Susan would hear them.

“Susan’s gone, and Ken is up in Billings tonight.”

“I don’t care,” Elaine said, standing.  She had been sitting beside him at his credenza.  She put several feet of distance between them.

His face went red, and his scalp went even redder.  “Elaine, I can’t stand it.  Ever since you came to work here—”

“Bill, don’t do this.  Please?”

“You don’t feel attracted to me?”

“That’s not the point, Bill. You’re my boss.”

“So what?”

Elaine opened her mouth, but closed it again, not wanting to sound like a newbie reciting rules from the Secret Service employee manual.  “You’re married.”

“Not really.”

She motioned to the wedding band on his finger.  “I suppose you’re going to tell me that’s a Secret Agent Decoder Ring?”

He chuckled.  “Joan and I are finished.  We’re getting a divorce.”

*Sure you are*, Elaine thought.

Bill noted her expression.  “Look, I’ll take the ring off, if that makes you feel better.”  He did so, putting it in his desk drawer.  “I won’t even wear it home.”

“Bill...”

“What?” he said, reaching for her waist.

“I’m not going to do this,” she said, moving farther away.   “I refuse to mess up my career.”

“Mess up?  What are you talking about?  This can only be good for your career.”

“You know better than that, Bill.”  She searched for excuses.  “If we started something and then it fell apart, it would be bad.  Really bad.”  

His expression grew cold.  “What about after I get my divorce?”

Even if she had been attracted to him, and he really did get a divorce, she wouldn’t allow herself to become involved with her boss, not at a place like the Secret Service.  But if she told him that, she didn’t know what he might do.   She didn’t have much experience with men, but her instincts told her to tread very carefully with this one.

“Well,” she said, “of course if you were di... single, things would be different.”  His face brightened at this.  “Now can we please put this aside and get back to work?”

“Sure thing,” he said.



\* \* \*

For the next few weeks, Elaine diligently went about her duties, hoping that Bill’s infatuation would pass.  She stopped wearing perfume and tried to dress down, hoping that would help.  

She often came in early and spent an hour or two working on what she now thought of as the “Ronald Eskew” case.  She ran the name through all the criminal databases but came up with zilch.  She was sure that Ronald Eskew was an alias the man had only used for his sleazy Rising Star Modeling Agency scam.  

Elaine wished she could travel back in time to the day she confronted Ronald Eskew in his office.  If only she had thought to pick up something with his fingerprints on it.  Of course, at that moment, she could not have known what was about to happen to her, and to her father.

She began doing detailed searches of all the modeling agencies that had been started in the year following the closure—or disappearance— of Rising Star.  There were over fifty agencies that had started during that time in the USA.  One by one, she began painstakingly investigating them.



\* \* \*

One day when Elaine and Bill were working together in his office, going over the details of a new bank check fraud case, Bill suddenly grabbed her and kissed her.

“Stop it,” she said, struggling against him.  He pushed her back on his desk and hungrily pressed his mouth against hers.  She could feel his erection pressing against her thigh.  Before she knew it, his hand went under her skirt, his fingers rubbing her vulva.

“Bill!” she gasped, roughly pushing him away.  

He backed off, breathing hard.

“This is not *acceptable*.  Do you understand?”

He blinked, wiping his mouth.  “I understand.”

“You do?”

“Yes.  You may go back to your office.”



\* \* \*

When Elaine went home that day, she had a bad feeling about what had taken place.  She didn’t sleep at all that night.  The next morning, she went to a downtown cafe and had breakfast, dreading the thought of confronting him again.  Things would be awkward, at best.  

When she got to the office, he was already there.  She passed his door.

“Good morning, Elaine,” he said evenly.

“Good morning,” she said, backtracking.

He was sitting at his desk, his arms crossed.

With a warm smile on his face, he said, “What the hell do you think you’re doing?”

“Excuse me?” 

His face was red, but not with embarrassment. “Do you think the law enforcement computers are here for your personal amusement?”  

He tapped on a printout on his desk.  “Would you mind telling me who Ronald Eskew is?”

“Bill...I asked you if it was all right for me to work on my own cases, and you said it was.”

“Did I?” 

“Yes. The first day I was here.  You said...” Now she noticed another look in his eye.  

“Abuse of law enforcement databases is a serious violation of your security clearance.  I could fire you for that.”

Elaine swallowed.  So this is how Bill Saunders dealt with his bruised male ego.   She remembered Luna’s words.  *You’ll end up working for at least one first-class asshole, maybe more.*

“Bill,” she said, willing herself to stay calm, “please don’t fire me.  I won’t use the databases anymore.”  She decided it was better to put herself at his mercy than to confront him about the real reason he was doing this.

He gazed at her for a moment with obvious resentment.  “Well, you’ve been doing a halfway decent job here. What I’m going to do is recommend a transfer.”

Elaine was taken aback.  “A transfer?  To where?”

“You’ll find out soon enough.  I’ll put in the request this morning.”  He picked up his pen and cut his gaze from her.  “That will be all.”

Elaine was furious, in a quandary about what to do.  She was tempted to fly to Washington and file a formal sexual harassment complaint, but she thought the better of it—doing that so early in her career would probably just get her known as a troublemaker.  Nobody would want her then.  Besides, she had no proof of anything, including Bill’s permission to use the confidential databases.  It would come down to her word against his.

She tried to tell herself that a transfer was a good thing.  Just about anywhere was better than Great Falls, Montana.",1,1764939882.0,u_Ill_Rough214,0,1.0,False

As I said last time I decided to just sublet Tyler's old room, my landlord doesn't really care as long as rent is on time. Chelsea and I scrubbed down the place, made some decent cash on his figurine/sword collection. I kept his PS2 and Chelsea took his DS. Oh also since my insurance wouldn't cover a prosthetic, we made one out of duct tape, a rag, and clothes hanger. Works a lot better than you would think. Once we got the carpet from a deep brown to a crisp white we put the room on Craigslist. It only took a week for me to find an offer. 

My new roommate's name is Vince. Been living here for about two months and at first it was fine. He's a big guy, not tall, but clearly works out. Well when I say clearly I mean he downs protein milk with pre-workout mixed in every morning before going to the gym. For work he's a podcaster, which I didn't really care about, until I found out what time he works.

Chelsea and I were asleep one night when we awoke to yelling through the wall, “No I'm telling you, we've seen this all before. They are using feminism to destroy American families!”

Chelsea grabbed her phone and checked the time, “dude it's 2:30, can you tell Vince to be quiet,” she then placed a pillow over her ear. Her curly black hair splayed out on the pillow.

“Why can't you?” I asked, trying to fall back asleep.

“Bro fuck therapy, all you need is too work out! I swear my life on ‘Super Max Pure Diesel ™’ supplements for any workout needs I have, and that's why I have let them sponsor our show,” Vince yelled again.

“Cause he's your roommate,” she groaned.

I sighed and flung my feet over the bed. Groggily, I walked out of my door and down the hallway and could hear him clearer. 

“Dude no I did my own research on the subject. Those mRNA vaccines really do have a correlation with…”

I knocked on the door, “hold on boys, think my beta-cuck melvin roommate has something to say,” I heard him getting up from his office chair and walking over to the door.

Once the door opened he looked at me with a confused but accommodating face, “Hey bro what's up?”

“I was just coming over to ask if you could be a little more quiet… Chelsea and I are trying to sleep. We've got class in the morning and you're keeping us awake,” my voice was one of exhaustion.

“Oh for sure bro… don't want your old lady to bitch too much right,” He elbowed me like I was a friend of his.

“Just please keep it down, we're trying to sleep,” I said then turned back around.

“For sure dude,” he then closed his door, after a moment I heard him again, “Sorry, my roommate's girl must have been bitching at him to silence old Vin. Bet she's on the rag… but you can also bet too with today's sponsor BetYourLife.com, you can bet on anything, baseball, football, soccer, gubernatorial races, and so much more! Don't be a sheep, and join the pack by betting your life today!”

My jaw clenched and I marched back to his door. I pounded on it again. Once again he opened the door with that same look, “everything good bro?” 

“I just asked you to be a little more quiet guy. Please I have class in like less than seven hours, can you just bring it down?”

He looked genuinely surprised, “oh yeah dude, totally. Really thought I was bringing it down,” he then closed the door once again. Before I could even walk away I heard, “Sorry, guess my roommate is also on the rag. So getting back to the topic, I've been on the carnivore diet for about three years, no carbs, at all! All the meat I eat is extremely lean, no fat, and the best quality.”

I knocked again and I heard a quick shuffling towards the door, then it flung open. Vince now looked extremely angry, red spread across his face as a vein throbbed across his forehead, stretching into his buzz cut hair. Under his tank top there seemed to be even more throbbing. Individual muscle fibers moving on their own. His neck seemed to expand with each breath.

“What do you want you little shit!?” He yelled. His left eye seemed to droop while his right tightened.

“I…was…just coming to say goodnight,” I pat his arm and quickly turned around. I sped walk down the hallway to my room, got back into bed and pulled the sheet over me.

“Is he going to be quiet?” Chelsea asked.

“Since Disney land was built on Seminole land, of course it's cursed. All the Disney princess actors are actually trained in ancient sumerian pagan witchcraft to stop them, that's why they don't let visitors dress as them. It's so obvious that the elites have been using stuff like this since the Witch of Enoch.”

“I tried.”

The next morning Chelsea and I were both exhausted. While she went to shower I made us coffee and eggs. I watched as the coffee trickled into the pot, not knowing Vince had come into the kitchen.

“Hey Trey, can we talk?” He said in a quiet voice.

I jumped back, “oh hey Vince, what's up?”

He sucked in air through his teeth then sighed, “I'm real sorry about last night bro, it wasn't very Christian of me to bite your head off like that.”

I stood in silence not expecting an apology, but he continued, “I've just been so stressed out lately. People on Twitter have been saying that my last Coin was a pump and dump scam, and since most of my followers are sixteen under that I scammed a bunch of kids, but like in my opinion that's the parents fault for letting their kids online,” he paused, “It wasn't a scam though, just to be clear,”

Slowly nodding my head I just said, “It's okay man, thank you for the apology,” then I turned back to my eggs.

“You're welcome bro,” he then stepped closer, “woah are you making eggs for her too? Shouldn't the woman be the one making eggs?” 

“I offered to make them Vince,” my tone was flat and slightly annoyed.

“Oh, she got you whipped brother,” he then grabbed a bottle of protein milk and a container of pre-workout. He mixed the milk and pre-workout into a cup. Then he walked to his room and brought out a piece of raw red meat wrapped in newspaper. I poured two cups of coffee and added a little bit of cream and sugar to one. Chelsea came into the kitchen wearing shorts and a tank top. Vince gave her a mean look as he sipped on his concatenation. She grabbed the coffee and gave me a peck on the cheek, “thanks, I needed this.” 

“You really let your girl dress like that?” Vince said in a confused voice.

Chelsea and I made eye contact, “excuse me?” She asked in a tone that I knew meant she was already done with him.

“Was I talking to you?” He answered in a similar one.

“What's wrong with what I'm wearing?” She was pissed.

He rolled his eyes, “Please, you're dressed like that to get male attention.”

“I'm dressed like this because it's comfy… you know what, I don't need to explain myself to you,” she said, grabbing her coffee and plate then getting up. 

When she left to my room I looked at Vince, “What the hell?”

“Hey I'm just looking out for you. Women nowadays can't be trusted,” he then finished his drink in gulp, milk dripping out the sides of his mouth. Without another thought he ran to the door, “we gotta look out for each other,” he held a fist up then went out, still holding onto the wrapped newspaper.

I walked back to my room. Once I entered Chelsea still looked angry, “hey sweetheart, how are you?” 

“Fucking pissed,”

“Yeah… he's gone now,”

“At you too,”

“Why me?”

She threw her arms up, “Cause you didn't back me up at all. You just let him be rude as hell. You couldn't have even said a word Trey?”

“I was just taken aback. Even after you left he didn't give me a chance to talk. It all went to shit so fast that my mind couldn't even register what he said till you talked. I'm sorry, next time I will have your back.” 

She sighed, ""I'm sorry too, shouldn't yell at you because of him. Just next time let's just not take the bait. We're both just tired and hungry. It also doesn't help that he's a dick,” she sipped her coffee.

“I know, he apologized to me this morning. Seriously thought he was going to be more chill than the last guy.”

She rubbed her forehead, “You know, I just hate guys like that. Blame women cause they can't keep it in their pants,” she then rolled her eyes, “and the constant conspiracy theories. I bet he knows that they are all antisemitic dogwhistles.”

“Yeah,” I chortled, then thought, “Wait, they are?”

“Yeah dude. Those ones about a secret cabal running the world from the shadows,” she waited for my confirmation that I knew what she was talking about so I nodded, “those are talking about Jewish people. Hell, even the whole adrenochrome harvesting is just a modern copy of the old blood libel bullshit spread by people in the middle ages. That and Russian propaganda from the early 20th century.”

I looked at her confused, “How do you know so much about this stuff?”

She looked at me and laughed, “I watch a lot of conspiracy theory videos on YouTube and I'm Jewish,”

“But your last name is Rodriguez.”

“My mom's side is Jewish.”

I nodded my head, “Hmm …neat. Well I'll talk to him to chill out with that stuff then.”

“Oh god please don't. Last thing I need is him getting on me for that whenever I come over.”

I shrugged, “like sometimes conspiracy theories are fun. I'm sure he doesn't realize what they mean.”

“Yeah don't count on that,” she looked at, “and I bet you can't name one ‘fun’ conspiracy that isn't a dogwhistle or propaganda.”

“Lizard Illuminati.”

“A kabal or people controlling the world from the shadows and our leaders ‘aren't really human’… sounds like a dogwhistle.”

“How about the moonlanding didn't happen? Like I know it did, but that's a common one.”

“You mean the event that even the Soviets at the time had to admit happened. Hell, an Indian satellite took a picture of it recently.  The only reason so many people think that now is because Russian propaganda wants to dismiss it.”

“I personally believe that Wendy's makes their drive thru small to make it seem like they are busier than they are,” I add.

“Thats…” She paused, “actually makes a little sense but not really a conspiracy theory.”

“You know, I think you just enjoy being a buzzkill,” I tease her.

“I just like stuff that has actual backing, stuff that makes sense,” she ranted then took a breath, “Sorry, conspiracy theories just annoy me on a good day, and today I am feeling like shit. I need to stay at my dorm so Vince doesn't keep me up.”

“Yeah… I think he's also a gross monster person so I understand,” I said.

Her eyes widened and she looked baffled, “Monster as in just a terrible person or monster as in Tyler gross mutation?”

“Not quite a slug, but his body convulsed last night.”

“What the fuck Trey? Why didn't you say anything?”

“It hadn't come up.”

“You've got to tell me this stuff. I'm not trying to get another ‘love dart’ removed,” she shuttered at the thought.

“You got yours removed?”

“Yeah… you didn't?”

“No, but it hasn't bugged me at all.”

“At times I wonder how you're still alive. Though I am definitely staying at my dorm, at least for week days.”

“Yeah that makes sense.”

“We should get going after eating, but how about we get breakfast tomorrow around nine. I'll buy,” she smiled.

“Sounds great,” I then kissed her. Eating back at the kitchen table. We talked about random stuff like the basketball team and classes. The two of us left after breakfast and took the bus to campus. I barely stayed awake in most of my classes. Took a nap in the library around noon, then went to my last class at 2:00 o'clock. When I got back to my apartment I was exhausted. My eyes lids barely stayed open as I shuffled into my living room. Collapsing on the couch I momentarily closed my eyes. When I opened them Vince was standing right over me.

“Oh shit!” I screamed.

“Sorry bro, just wanted to ask if you wanted to work out.”

“Dude you can't just watch me like that.”

“Well I was just coming to see if you wanted to head to the gym with me. I mean you got a good build, you could have a linebackers physique if you put in the work,” 

“Vince you shouldn't just watch people and I actually need to talk to you about how you've been treating Chels… wait, a linebacker you think?” I scratched my neck with the clothes hanger. 

“Oh totally, you've got a good base right now.”

“Really?” I was tempted.

He went to the kitchen, pulled out his pre-workout and protein milk and mixed it together. I got up and walked into the kitchen, “So does that stuff actually help,”

“One hundred and ten percent bro. This shit turned me from a limp wristed two-hundred and fifty pound loser, into the alpha stud you see today,” he then handed me the cup, “drink away brother, it's good for health.”

I laughed a little, “Is it bad for education?”

“What?”

Holding the cup up to my mouth I looked into it. The liquid bubbled slightly, “Nothing… So is this stuff even FDA approved?”

He laughed, “That's funny man.”

“So it is?”

“Oh no bro, everyone knows the FDA is run by the Jews,”

“What?!” I was surprised at his words, then he pushed the glass up and made the liquid pour straight down my throat. As it dripped down into my stomach I fell back onto the ground. Every muscle in my body felt like it was tearing and building back together, I screamed in agony on the ground.

“Yeah the first time is pretty intense, but it's great for gains,” he was crouching down beside me. 

My vision started to become darker. Not like I was losing consciousness, but everything just started having a different shade. Black shadows with jarred edges stretched across my sight, Vince became a dark shadow man, no human features. Red flat eyes and a red mouth in pitch blackness. I looked at my arms and saw a shadow growing from my stump. Then every muscle snapped back into place and I felt the need to work, the need to expel energy.

“Fuck yes!” I yelled.

“That's the spirit bro come on!”

In a blink I was in front of a cage. The bench set for press, Sabaton's ‘Night Witches’ blasting in my ear. I laid back and saw that my hand had grown back into a shadow form. I ripped fifty reps then. Blinked and I was mid clean, ninety pounds on each side, blinked again and I was squatting. Then I was doing lunges with eighty pound dumbbells, Stryper's ‘To Hell With The Devil’ now playing. With a final blink I shot up from the couch. My vision was normal again and every inch of my body was sore. The workout couldn't have been that long since there was still light outside. I felt like I had the worst hangover in my life.

Feeling nauseous I got up and stumbled to the bathroom. I put my face into the bowl and threw up. My hands clenched the bowl. I realized my HANDS clenched the bowl. Looking at where my stump should be I saw my left hand. Stunned in silence I balled my hand, then released it.

“Yo great workout bro,” Vince said at the doorway way, “been a while since I had a partner that could go that intense.”

“Hand…why hand?” I questioned while still staring at it.

“Oh that,” he laughed, “The pre-workout comes from a country with very lax laws. They use pure calcium, creatine, alpha-alanine, thirty-five grams of protein, and totipotent stem-cells to help with bulking. It can also regrow limbs… watch.”

Without warning he grabbed his index finger and broke it, “FUCK THAT'S THAT GOOD BURN!”

The bone broke through the skin and blood dripped on the floor. Then his skin with tendrils slowly reached the base of his finger, “awww fuck yeah!” He yelled as his bones cracked back into place. His finger went back to normal.

“See, shits really good!”

I looked at him in shock then nodded my head, “Okay guy, well I'm going to get some sleep for the morning.”

“What do you mean? We worked out for like ten hours yesterday, it's eleven A.M. right now,” he pulled out his phone and showed me.

A wall of panic hit me, I was late for breakfast. I jumped up and ran to my room. I pulled on some jeans and pulled off my shirt. I caught myself in the mirror, I had probably put on five pounds of muscle. After admiring the view for a moment I pulled a new shirt over my head, sprayed myself down with air freshener and cologne. Rushed back to the bathroom to brush my teeth. Looked in the couch cushions for my phone. Once I found it I saw six missed calls from Chelsea and a few texts asking where I was.

I called her as I pushed out the door. It rang a couple times till she answered, “I'm so sorry baby… I got caught up,” 

“With working out?” She finished my sentence and sounded angry.

“Yeah? How did you?” I stopped in the hallway 

“Look at your Insta story Trey.”

I opened my Instagram and clicked on my story. It was a video of me hitting a bench press while yelling “I'm a demi-God! Blood of Zeus!” with Kanye's ‘Stronger’ playing in the background.

“Listen, I can explain…”

“Seriously you blew me off to workout with Vince?” She sounded with a blend of hurt and righteous fury.

“Yeah I fucked up, but there's more to it.” 

“What more is there, you went no contact so you could lift weights, what the hell dude? This is the second time in the past couple of days you haven't been clearly talking to me. You need to work on your communication, this is becoming a serious problem.”

I then frantically said, “He gave me some of his pre-workout and now my hand is back!”

She was silent for a moment, “your hand is back?”

“Yes, I drank the pre-workout, went into a trance, and now my hand is back, I gained muscle, and I'm scared.” 

“Okay okay okay, try and stay calm. I'm going to class right now. Just wait in your room and I'll be there later.”

I turned and looked at my door, “yeah… okay, I'm sorry for blowing you off. I had no control, that stuff he gave me is intense.”

“We still need to talk later but for now maybe convince him to move out after the lease, or maybe you can look for a new place.” 

“Baby the rent here is too good. I would rather lose my hand again than move somewhere else,”

“Jesus Trey, you pay seven hundred a month, yeah it's cheap but not worth the shit you go through.”

“Utility is included, it's worth it to me.”

“Well then try to convince him to move out or something.”

With that we said goodbye. I went back into my apartment. Stepping into my place I looked around. Vince was nowhere to be seen, so I went back to my room. In my room I locked my door and passed out on my bed. By the time I woke up it was dark outside. I blink my eyes open as it adjusts to the darkness. I checked my phone, there was a message from Chelsea. 

6:25: Hey, sorry got caught up, be there in thirty min

That was sent about fifteen minutes before I awoke. Sitting up in bed I heard a faint metallic hum through the wall. I stepped out into the hallway and saw the bathroom door slightly cracked. White light piercing through the darkness of the hall. A rattling came from it. Walking down the hall slowly, the closer I got the more I heard the sound grow louder. Along with the sound was almost ripping. As I got to the door I heard grunts coming from the room. Bringing my eyes to the door my gut sank.

Vince was in the tub, covered in blood. The back of his head to the door as he laid in the tub.  A turkey carver in one hand. He was chewing on something as he brought his leg to the side of the tub. His calf flexed he brought the cutter to his leg. The hum of the cutter tore through the thick muscle. With a grunt he brought it back and forth as it sliced his leg. He set down the carver and with both hands pulled the muscle off his leg. Fingers digging into the open gashes. Gritting his teeth the meat was pulled off. The leg dripped blood until the fibers wriggled back together on his leg. His hands brought the meat to his nose and he took a deep breath. Then he opened his mouth and took a large bite from it.

After the initial bite his hand reached out of the tub, it found a stack of newspaper. After wrapping it in the newspaper he set it next to four other wrapped pieces of meat. I stepped back from the doorway, but the floor creaked underneath my foot. I looked down at my foot for a second then looked back into the door crack. 

Vince was right at the doorway, looking right at me. His face was a shaking rage as he stared right at me. I stood, petrified by his drilling eyes. My breath became heavy. His fingers grabbed the door and pulled it open a little more. 

“I didn't think you were home Trey,” Vince said with narrowed eyes, “what are you doing spying on me?”

“I… I just thought I heard the… smoke alarm,” I lied.

“The one you took the batteries out before I moved in?”  

“Yeah, that one. Actually while I got your ear, I was wondering if you would consider not renewing your portion of the lease.”

His eyes narrowed “And why wouldn't I? Do you have a problem with me?” 

“To be real with you, I just think we have different personalities. Like our vibes just don't mesh well, oil and water you know?”

“It's you girl right? She's bitching at you to get me out.”

“No… well a little. You were extremely disrespectful to her. But I am telling you that I don't think we should be roommates cause I think we are just in different phases of our lives.”

He opened the door even more, “What's wrong little man? Can't handle rooming with someone that has their third eye open? A 6’1 alpha made from pure muscle in the form of an Olympian who sees the truth in the world?”

I couldn't help but laugh, “My guy, you just fall for the easiest piece of misinformation, spread it, and profit from minors whose frontal cortex can't tell bullshit yet. You don't understand basic decency. Honestly you're just a rude person, and I can't stand to hear you speak. You keep me up till early morning with your stupid podcast. Now I find out that you eat yourself cause you think you're such an adonis that no other meat can compete …also I'm six foot, and taller than you.”

His neck vein began to throb, “So you're so smart? I wasn't aware I'm living with the next Stephen Hawkin. And are you saying I'm below six foot?”

Now I was getting annoyed, “No I'm not saying I'm smart. I can admit that I am a complete dumbass who's barely keeping it together most of the time, but I also know the difference between pretending to be smart versus what you do!”

I paused for a moment, “And Yes! You are below six feet. Nobody cares if you are below it or not apart from you.”

His muscles on his chest began to move around, his eye began drooping. His neck seemed to grow. He pushed the door open. One arm looked to be growing longer than the other as his triceps and delts convulsed.

“You little shit. I am nothing but nice to you. Let you use my pre-workout, try to help you out with your dating problems. Let you have a new hand!” He grabbed my left hand and held it up, “how dare you throw it all back at me bro.”

I felt his hand begin to absorb into mine. I pulled it back, but caused our conjoined skin to rip apart. 

“Shit!” I yelled, pulling my hand back. He had caused my index finger to be degloved. Blood dripped onto the ground. Then I felt his skin grow back over my finger. It began to slowly spread across more of my hand. 

“What the hell is happening?” I said, losing control of my hand.

“If you can't appreciate what I do for you, then you don't deserve my gifts,” he then stepped forward. I backed away down the hall, holding my hand as it turned. His anger seemed to make his body spasm, muscles growing in and out. I turned and ran down the hall. Looking back I saw him fall down and then gallop on all fours. I rushed to the kitchen and grabbed a knife. Once he made it his body had become more bear-like than human. Then a slow mocking laugh came from him.

“What do you think that will do? Go ahead and try pussy,” his paw then punched into the cabinet. Out he pulled the container of ‘Super Max Pure Diesel ™’ and twisted the top. He then brought it up to his mouth and poured a mouthful in. He then set it down. His body bubbled and throbbed. 

“Ohhhh fuckkkk yesss!” 

He fell down to the ground. His hands became pools of flesh and veins on the ground as his body grew more and more. His shoulders began to overtake his head. Then I felt my left hand grab my wrist and attempt to turn the knife on me. I fought against it as I backed away towards the front door. 

“No! Not my hand!” I yelled, stumbling into the hallway. I kicked the door shut and fell to my knees holding my left hand down.

“Gimme back my hand!” I yelled, “GIMME BACK MY HAND!”

“Trey?” I heard behind me in the hallway.

Turning I saw Chelsea, and beside her a fire axe in an emergency box. The door to the apartment began to knock, and I felt Vince's control reach my wrist, “damn you did put on some muscle.”

“Baby! Get the axe!”

“What!?” 

“Axe now!” I screamed, then my hand wiggled itself from the grip and lunged at my throat. I could hear Vince laughing as the door began to break down. Chelsea broke the glass and retrieved the axe. I pulled my hand free and wrestled it to the ground. I pinned it there as she rushed over. 

“Cut it off!”

She looked hesitantly then squared up to it, and lined the axe into position. Vince continued to bellow a deep laugh as the door broke more. His face now peered through.

“Who's laughing now!” I yelled.

CHOP!

Blood flew everywhere as the first strike hit. I screamed in pain, but it wasn't enough. Still attached and growing back I yelled for her to swing again. 

CHOP!

My shirt was now red with my blood. One more swing was needed.

CHOP!

I pulled my freshly chopped hand. Chelsea pulled off her sweater and wrapped it around my stump. My old hand jumped up and ran away.

“What the fuck is happening?” She asked me while tying the sweater on my stump.

With a near delirious voice I answered, “I asked Vince to move out after I caught him chopping himself to pieces to eat. So then he took more of his stuff.”

She didn't have a response, her face was part shocked, and another part done with this. She then lifted me up to my feet, “Okay, lets just get the hell out of here.” 

We then rushed down the hall. A loud crash happened and we saw flesh grow out of the doorway. Muscles and skin moving in a strange symbiotic motion. Running to the staircase we began down it. Passing by a couple of guys who had no idea why we were running. I turned to warn them but it was too late. Tentacles of flesh came out and pulled them into the mass. Their bones breaking as they became absorbed. Once at the bottom floor we ran to the door.

“Shit… is this all because of the pre-workout?” Chelsea asked, stopping at the door.

“Yes, now let's book it,” I answered, trying to go out the door. 

“Trey stop. I have an idea on how we can stop this.”

“No, let's just get out of here before he eats us.”

“We can't let him eat anyone else.”

“Sure we can, now let's go,” I pushed the door open, but then I heard her running towards the other staircase.

“Goddammit!” 

I rushed after her, Vince started coming through the door to the lobby. His body became a long cube of meat as he pushed through the doorway. A large mouth and eyes marked the front as what must have been his abs now worked as long legs.

“You think I'm short now Trey?” He laughed as I ran to the other staircase. His body would disperse on each step he took. 

I followed Chelsea up the stairs to my floor. Once in the hallway it was drenched in blood and chunks of meat caught on door handles and anything protruding from the wall was left. I could see what must have been his ass go down the opposite stairs, as his front half climbed up the stairs behind me. Chelsea then went into my apartment. Once inside I saw her holding the container of pre-workout. 

“What are you doing?” 

“Just get him close enough, I have a plan,” she opened the fridge and grabbed all the protein milk and began pouring it into a large container.

With a shake of my head I went out into the hallway and saw Vince coming down. Tentacles shot muscles to the walls as he dragged himself down the hallway.

“I tried to be friendly, tried to have your back from that slut you call a girlfriend. No, you just had to be a baby backed bitch,” he said, his flesh fanning across the floor then sucking back into him as he got closer.

Chelsea wanted me to bring him closer so I did, “Still doesn't change the fact you're not six foot. Hell doesn't change the fact that no matter how much bulk you put on, you still have small hands.”

“The fuck you say about my hands bro?” 

“You've got dainty little hands. Shit I bet a calcium deficient racoon could beat your ass in a thumb war.”

His body began to shake as his anger built up. He started down the hallway, “what's wrong guy? Pissed that your Napoleon complex doesn't make you cool, it's just annoying as hell to anyone that can interact with the other half of the population. You roided-out loser.” 

He became faster, I turned to go back into the apartment but felt a sharp pain in my foot nailing it into place. 

“Ahhh fuck!”

I looked down and saw my severed hand around the knife I had earlier. It pinned my foot down by stabbing through it into the floor.

Vince got closer and closer. His body wriggled as he headed towards me at full speed. Tentacles reached out towards me and I thought it was the end for me. Before they hit their target Chelsea jumps out with a large bottle. Tossing it in front of me, the tentacles went for it instead of me.

Vince laughed, “what was that? Giving me my milk?”

“Along with all the pre-workout you inbred antisemitic prick!” She yelled. 

Vince's eyes widened, “No… that's too much! You fucking whore!” His body then began growing even more, his face disappearing into the mass. Bubbling muscles popped. Eventually the walls began to break apart and the popcorn ceiling started to fall.

“You bitch! Both of you!”

“Chelsea,” I said looking at her.

“No time to talk, let's go!” She yelled and tried to grab me. She reached down and grabbed the knife and pulled it free. The hand was flailing and crunched up like a dead spider before large blisters spread throughout it and popped.

She had my arm over her shoulder and helped keep my weight up as we sprinted back down the hall, but before we could make it to the stairs, a timber broke and blocked our exit.

“Shit no!” She yelled. Down the hall Vince's flesh blob began to grow more. For a brief second a massive baby face came out and cried as the building became destroyed.

“We need to find some way out!” She said looking for a solution.

I looked at her, “Chelsea… There's something I need to tell you.”

“Now is not the time Trey,” she said trying to find a way out. 

I grabbed her hands and looked into her eyes, “these last few months have been chaotic and insane. You have been the only normalcy in it…I just wanted to say,”

She looked back at me, her eyes widening, seemingly knowing what I was about to say. The building rumbled as the blisters on Vince's mass popped everywhere.

“Chels… do you want to find an apartment together?”

“Yes Trey…let's find a place together.”

We embraced knowing these may be our final moments. The walls began to fall apart and Vince broke through to the open night through the ceiling. The bottom floors beneath crumbled, causing the building to implode. Then he blew up, sending the building and meat flying. Concrete, wood, drywall and flesh sent flying into the neighboring building and street. Crushing cars and light posts.

Firefighters found us hours later. Somehow we made it through. Apart from the prior injuries to myself, neither of us have had a scrape. Stitches for my foot and stump, along with an ambulance ride will put me into even more debt. They did remove some costs after I asked for an itemized receipt. I hate [Redacted color for legal reasons] Cross [Redacted color for legal reasons] Shield.

It's been ten months since. Chelsea and I moved into a new apartment. Two bedrooms and two baths. I've been working on my communication skills. Rent is a lot steeper and we both work as much as we can. I was able to find the PS2 in the rubble of the building. We celebrated our first anniversary going to a Chinese place. All in all, life is pretty much normal again. I even made a new clothes hanger hook. Though with prices on rent increasing with our renewed lease and other expenses, we have been discussing getting a new roommate. With Chelsea's vetting, I'm sure the next one can't be nearly as bad as my last two.

I forgot to add something that did happen a week or so ago. I was getting out of the shower, and went over to brush my teeth. Getting ready for bed, but when I looked into the mirror I saw a weird cyst form  where the love dart hit on my neck that hadn't been there before my shower. I could see my pulse through it, so I squeezed it with my fingers. That's when burning pain felt like my nervous system was being wrapped up on a fork as if it were spaghetti. 

I fell back against the wall and clenched my neck. Looking in the mirror I saw slithering in my neck. Then two small stalks popped out of the cyst. Falling to my knees I felt something slimy slowly crawl out.  With my one hand I grabbed it and pulled it out. Throwing it across the room I bent over and caught my breath.

“You really thought you outsmarted me Trey?” A nasally voice came from where I had tossed the slimy morph.

“No, no, no, No!” I said in disbelief. I then reached out with my hook, trying to catch him. The slug dodged me and made it to the air vent. 

“I'll be back for vengeance!” He yelled, “I am INEVITABLE!”

Chelsea rushed into the bathroom, worry etched on her face, “what's wrong?”

Clenching my neck while on my knees I turned to look at her.

I used to finish a prompt session, copy the answer, and close the tab. I treated the context window as a scratchpad.

I was wrong. The context window is a vector database of your own thinking.

When you interact with an LLM, it calculates probability relationships between your first prompt and your last. It sees connections between ""Idea A"" and ""Constraint B"" that it never explicitly states in the output. When you close the tab, that data is gone.

I developed an ""Audit"" workflow. Before closing any long session, I run specific prompts that shifts the AI's role from Generator to Analyst. I command it: 

\> *""Analyze the meta-data of this conversation. Find the abandoned threads. Find the unstated connections between my inputs.""*

The results are often more valuable than the original answer.

I wrote up the full technical breakdown, including the ""Audit"" prompts. I can't link the PDF here, but the links are in my profile.

1peui97,https://i.redd.it/vkr9yvs2wd5g1.jpeg,Bye bye mCaffeine 👋,"This brand had a bogo sale recently & I was out of body scrubs. I wanted to try some of their other products too (kudos to their marketing). Something inside stopped me & I placed a smytten trial instead (tq survival skills).

1. Coffee face mask - not even a face mask girlie, atmost diy homemade stuff only, got this for the word coffee, thought this will remind something nostalgic like those coffee scrubs we made at home. But this smelt of burnt plastic tyre, you are better off with fevicol on your face. 

2. Choco body butter - this gives competition to the face mask for the burnt plastic smell, but this atleast is not as pungent. It takes too too long to blend in your skin & for what ? to smell like abandoned chemical factory. 

3. Coffee body scrub - this is the only product in their whole line that smells like coffee as they claim. Not a great fan of powder scrubs as they are too messy & you can't use it straight from the tub, but what's stopping from using freshly grounded coffee at home instead. 

4. Sweet escape perfume body lotion - this smells like perfume. That's all. Can't say which notes & all.  Probably only bearable smell among their products. But this is too thin to be called a lotion & again its a work of art to blend in your skin. I had high hopes for this as they even launched 600ml bigger bottle due to huge response but just nope nope nope.

The only take away are these cute containers, definitely saving them for when I go traveling,  some of them are even glass but everything good about this brand just stops here. 

And whoever panned an entire bottle of these stuff, you all have my atmost respect & admiration, I would have hated my life by then. 🙏 ",4,1764939770.0,IndianPanPorn,2,1.0,False
1peui21,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepcast/comments/1peui21/my_new_roommate_is_a_podcaster_and_he_might_be/,My new roommate is a podcaster and he might be worse than the last one.,"Hey so I'm the guy who had the slug man roommate. As I said last time I decided to just sublet Tyler's old room, my landlord doesn't really care as long as rent is on time. Chelsea and I scrubbed down the place, made some decent cash on his figurine/sword collection. I kept his PS2 and Chelsea took his DS. Oh also since my insurance wouldn't cover a prosthetic, we made one out of duct tape, a rag, and clothes hanger. Works a lot better than you would think. Once we got the carpet from a deep brown to a crisp white we put the room on Craigslist. It only took a week for me to find an offer. 

My new roommate's name is Vince. Been living here for about two months and at first it was fine. He's a big guy, not tall, but clearly works out. Well when I say clearly I mean he downs protein milk with pre-workout mixed in every morning before going to the gym. For work he's a podcaster, which I didn't really care about, until I found out what time he works.

Chelsea and I were asleep one night when we awoke to yelling through the wall, “No I'm telling you, we've seen this all before. They are using feminism to destroy American families!”

Chelsea grabbed her phone and checked the time, “dude it's 2:30, can you tell Vince to be quiet,” she then placed a pillow over her ear. Her curly black hair splayed out on the pillow.

“Why can't you?” I asked, trying to fall back asleep.

“Bro fuck therapy, all you need is too work out! I swear my life on ‘Super Max Pure Diesel ™’ supplements for any workout needs I have, and that's why I have let them sponsor our show,” Vince yelled again.

“Cause he's your roommate,” she groaned.

I sighed and flung my feet over the bed. Groggily, I walked out of my door and down the hallway and could hear him clearer. 

“Dude no I did my own research on the subject. Those mRNA vaccines really do have a correlation with…”

I knocked on the door, “hold on boys, think my beta-cuck melvin roommate has something to say,” I heard him getting up from his office chair and walking over to the door.

Once the door opened he looked at me with a confused but accommodating face, “Hey bro what's up?”

“I was just coming over to ask if you could be a little more quiet… Chelsea and I are trying to sleep. We've got class in the morning and you're keeping us awake,” my voice was one of exhaustion.

“Oh for sure bro… don't want your old lady to bitch too much right,” He elbowed me like I was a friend of his.

“Just please keep it down, we're trying to sleep,” I said then turned back around.

“For sure dude,” he then closed his door, after a moment I heard him again, “Sorry, my roommate's girl must have been bitching at him to silence old Vin. Bet she's on the rag… but you can also bet too with today's sponsor BetYourLife.com, you can bet on anything, baseball, football, soccer, gubernatorial races, and so much more! Don't be a sheep, and join the pack by betting your life today!”

My jaw clenched and I marched back to his door. I pounded on it again. Once again he opened the door with that same look, “everything good bro?” 

“I just asked you to be a little more quiet guy. Please I have class in like less than seven hours, can you just bring it down?”

He looked genuinely surprised, “oh yeah dude, totally. Really thought I was bringing it down,” he then closed the door once again. Before I could even walk away I heard, “Sorry, guess my roommate is also on the rag. So getting back to the topic, I've been on the carnivore diet for about three years, no carbs, at all! All the meat I eat is extremely lean, no fat, and the best quality.”

I knocked again and I heard a quick shuffling towards the door, then it flung open. Vince now looked extremely angry, red spread across his face as a vein throbbed across his forehead, stretching into his buzz cut hair. Under his tank top there seemed to be even more throbbing. Individual muscle fibers moving on their own. His neck seemed to expand with each breath.

“What do you want you little shit!?” He yelled. His left eye seemed to droop while his right tightened.

“I…was…just coming to say goodnight,” I pat his arm and quickly turned around. I sped walk down the hallway to my room, got back into bed and pulled the sheet over me.

“Is he going to be quiet?” Chelsea asked.

“Since Disney land was built on Seminole land, of course it's cursed. All the Disney princess actors are actually trained in ancient sumerian pagan witchcraft to stop them, that's why they don't let visitors dress as them. It's so obvious that the elites have been using stuff like this since the Witch of Enoch.”

“I tried.”

The next morning Chelsea and I were both exhausted. While she went to shower I made us coffee and eggs. I watched as the coffee trickled into the pot, not knowing Vince had come into the kitchen.

“Hey Trey, can we talk?” He said in a quiet voice.

I jumped back, “oh hey Vince, what's up?”

He sucked in air through his teeth then sighed, “I'm real sorry about last night bro, it wasn't very Christian of me to bite your head off like that.”

I stood in silence not expecting an apology, but he continued, “I've just been so stressed out lately. People on Twitter have been saying that my last Coin was a pump and dump scam, and since most of my followers are sixteen under that I scammed a bunch of kids, but like in my opinion that's the parents fault for letting their kids online,” he paused, “It wasn't a scam though, just to be clear,”

Slowly nodding my head I just said, “It's okay man, thank you for the apology,” then I turned back to my eggs.

“You're welcome bro,” he then stepped closer, “woah are you making eggs for her too? Shouldn't the woman be the one making eggs?” 

“I offered to make them Vince,” my tone was flat and slightly annoyed.

“Oh, she got you whipped brother,” he then grabbed a bottle of protein milk and a container of pre-workout. He mixed the milk and pre-workout into a cup. Then he walked to his room and brought out a piece of raw red meat wrapped in newspaper. I poured two cups of coffee and added a little bit of cream and sugar to one. Chelsea came into the kitchen wearing shorts and a tank top. Vince gave her a mean look as he sipped on his concatenation. She grabbed the coffee and gave me a peck on the cheek, “thanks, I needed this.” 

“You really let your girl dress like that?” Vince said in a confused voice.

Chelsea and I made eye contact, “excuse me?” She asked in a tone that I knew meant she was already done with him.

“Was I talking to you?” He answered in a similar one.

“What's wrong with what I'm wearing?” She was pissed.

He rolled his eyes, “Please, you're dressed like that to get male attention.”

“I'm dressed like this because it's comfy… you know what, I don't need to explain myself to you,” she said, grabbing her coffee and plate then getting up. 

When she left to my room I looked at Vince, “What the hell?”

“Hey I'm just looking out for you. Women nowadays can't be trusted,” he then finished his drink in gulp, milk dripping out the sides of his mouth. Without another thought he ran to the door, “we gotta look out for each other,” he held a fist up then went out, still holding onto the wrapped newspaper.

I walked back to my room. Once I entered Chelsea still looked angry, “hey sweetheart, how are you?” 

“Fucking pissed,”

“Yeah… he's gone now,”

“At you too,”

“Why me?”

She threw her arms up, “Cause you didn't back me up at all. You just let him be rude as hell. You couldn't have even said a word Trey?”

“I was just taken aback. Even after you left he didn't give me a chance to talk. It all went to shit so fast that my mind couldn't even register what he said till you talked. I'm sorry, next time I will have your back.” 

She sighed, ""I'm sorry too, shouldn't yell at you because of him. Just next time let's just not take the bait. We're both just tired and hungry. It also doesn't help that he's a dick,” she sipped her coffee.

“I know, he apologized to me this morning. Seriously thought he was going to be more chill than the last guy.”

She rubbed her forehead, “You know, I just hate guys like that. Blame women cause they can't keep it in their pants,” she then rolled her eyes, “and the constant conspiracy theories. I bet he knows that they are all antisemitic dogwhistles.”

“Yeah,” I chortled, then thought, “Wait, they are?”

“Yeah dude. Those ones about a secret cabal running the world from the shadows,” she waited for my confirmation that I knew what she was talking about so I nodded, “those are talking about Jewish people. Hell, even the whole adrenochrome harvesting is just a modern copy of the old blood libel bullshit spread by people in the middle ages. That and Russian propaganda from the early 20th century.”

I looked at her confused, “How do you know so much about this stuff?”

She looked at me and laughed, “I watch a lot of conspiracy theory videos on YouTube and I'm Jewish,”

“But your last name is Rodriguez.”

“My mom's side is Jewish.”

I nodded my head, “Hmm …neat. Well I'll talk to him to chill out with that stuff then.”

“Oh god please don't. Last thing I need is him getting on me for that whenever I come over.”

I shrugged, “like sometimes conspiracy theories are fun. I'm sure he doesn't realize what they mean.”

“Yeah don't count on that,” she looked at, “and I bet you can't name one ‘fun’ conspiracy that isn't a dogwhistle or propaganda.”

“Lizard Illuminati.”

“A kabal or people controlling the world from the shadows and our leaders ‘aren't really human’… sounds like a dogwhistle.”

“How about the moonlanding didn't happen? Like I know it did, but that's a common one.”

“You mean the event that even the Soviets at the time had to admit happened. Hell, an Indian satellite took a picture of it recently.  The only reason so many people think that now is because Russian propaganda wants to dismiss it.”

“I personally believe that Wendy's makes their drive thru small to make it seem like they are busier than they are,” I add.

“Thats…” She paused, “actually makes a little sense but not really a conspiracy theory.”

“You know, I think you just enjoy being a buzzkill,” I tease her.

“I just like stuff that has actual backing, stuff that makes sense,” she ranted then took a breath, “Sorry, conspiracy theories just annoy me on a good day, and today I am feeling like shit. I need to stay at my dorm so Vince doesn't keep me up.”

“Yeah… I think he's also a gross monster person so I understand,” I said.

Her eyes widened and she looked baffled, “Monster as in just a terrible person or monster as in Tyler gross mutation?”

“Not quite a slug, but his body convulsed last night.”

“What the fuck Trey? Why didn't you say anything?”

“It hadn't come up.”

“You've got to tell me this stuff. I'm not trying to get another ‘love dart’ removed,” she shuttered at the thought.

“You got yours removed?”

“Yeah… you didn't?”

“No, but it hasn't bugged me at all.”

“At times I wonder how you're still alive. Though I am definitely staying at my dorm, at least for week days.”

“Yeah that makes sense.”

“We should get going after eating, but how about we get breakfast tomorrow around nine. I'll buy,” she smiled.

“Sounds great,” I then kissed her. Eating back at the kitchen table. We talked about random stuff like the basketball team and classes. The two of us left after breakfast and took the bus to campus. I barely stayed awake in most of my classes. Took a nap in the library around noon, then went to my last class at 2:00 o'clock. When I got back to my apartment I was exhausted. My eyes lids barely stayed open as I shuffled into my living room. Collapsing on the couch I momentarily closed my eyes. When I opened them Vince was standing right over me.

“Oh shit!” I screamed.

“Sorry bro, just wanted to ask if you wanted to work out.”

“Dude you can't just watch me like that.”

“Well I was just coming to see if you wanted to head to the gym with me. I mean you got a good build, you could have a linebackers physique if you put in the work,” 

“Vince you shouldn't just watch people and I actually need to talk to you about how you've been treating Chels… wait, a linebacker you think?” I scratched my neck with the clothes hanger. 

“Oh totally, you've got a good base right now.”

“Really?” I was tempted.

He went to the kitchen, pulled out his pre-workout and protein milk and mixed it together. I got up and walked into the kitchen, “So does that stuff actually help,”

“One hundred and ten percent bro. This shit turned me from a limp wristed two-hundred and fifty pound loser, into the alpha stud you see today,” he then handed me the cup, “drink away brother, it's good for health.”

I laughed a little, “Is it bad for education?”

“What?”

Holding the cup up to my mouth I looked into it. The liquid bubbled slightly, “Nothing… So is this stuff even FDA approved?”

He laughed, “That's funny man.”

“So it is?”

“Oh no bro, everyone knows the FDA is run by the Jews,”

“What?!” I was surprised at his words, then he pushed the glass up and made the liquid pour straight down my throat. As it dripped down into my stomach I fell back onto the ground. Every muscle in my body felt like it was tearing and building back together, I screamed in agony on the ground.

“Yeah the first time is pretty intense, but it's great for gains,” he was crouching down beside me. 

My vision started to become darker. Not like I was losing consciousness, but everything just started having a different shade. Black shadows with jarred edges stretched across my sight, Vince became a dark shadow man, no human features. Red flat eyes and a red mouth in pitch blackness. I looked at my arms and saw a shadow growing from my stump. Then every muscle snapped back into place and I felt the need to work, the need to expel energy.

“Fuck yes!” I yelled.

“That's the spirit bro come on!”

In a blink I was in front of a cage. The bench set for press, Sabaton's ‘Night Witches’ blasting in my ear. I laid back and saw that my hand had grown back into a shadow form. I ripped fifty reps then. Blinked and I was mid clean, ninety pounds on each side, blinked again and I was squatting. Then I was doing lunges with eighty pound dumbbells, Stryper's ‘To Hell With The Devil’ now playing. With a final blink I shot up from the couch. My vision was normal again and every inch of my body was sore. The workout couldn't have been that long since there was still light outside. I felt like I had the worst hangover in my life.

Feeling nauseous I got up and stumbled to the bathroom. I put my face into the bowl and threw up. My hands clenched the bowl. I realized my HANDS clenched the bowl. Looking at where my stump should be I saw my left hand. Stunned in silence I balled my hand, then released it.

“Yo great workout bro,” Vince said at the doorway way, “been a while since I had a partner that could go that intense.”

“Hand…why hand?” I questioned while still staring at it.

“Oh that,” he laughed, “The pre-workout comes from a country with very lax laws. They use pure calcium, creatine, alpha-alanine, thirty-five grams of protein, and totipotent stem-cells to help with bulking. It can also regrow limbs… watch.”

Without warning he grabbed his index finger and broke it, “FUCK THAT'S THAT GOOD BURN!”

The bone broke through the skin and blood dripped on the floor. Then his skin with tendrils slowly reached the base of his finger, “awww fuck yeah!” He yelled as his bones cracked back into place. His finger went back to normal.

“See, shits really good!”

I looked at him in shock then nodded my head, “Okay guy, well I'm going to get some sleep for the morning.”

“What do you mean? We worked out for like ten hours yesterday, it's eleven A.M. right now,” he pulled out his phone and showed me.

A wall of panic hit me, I was late for breakfast. I jumped up and ran to my room. I pulled on some jeans and pulled off my shirt. I caught myself in the mirror, I had probably put on five pounds of muscle. After admiring the view for a moment I pulled a new shirt over my head, sprayed myself down with air freshener and cologne. Rushed back to the bathroom to brush my teeth. Looked in the couch cushions for my phone. Once I found it I saw six missed calls from Chelsea and a few texts asking where I was.

I called her as I pushed out the door. It rang a couple times till she answered, “I'm so sorry baby… I got caught up,” 

“With working out?” She finished my sentence and sounded angry.

“Yeah? How did you?” I stopped in the hallway 

“Look at your Insta story Trey.”

I opened my Instagram and clicked on my story. It was a video of me hitting a bench press while yelling “I'm a demi-God! Blood of Zeus!” with Kanye's ‘Stronger’ playing in the background.

“Listen, I can explain…”

“Seriously you blew me off to workout with Vince?” She sounded with a blend of hurt and righteous fury.

“Yeah I fucked up, but there's more to it.” 

“What more is there, you went no contact so you could lift weights, what the hell dude? This is the second time in the past couple of days you haven't been clearly talking to me. You need to work on your communication, this is becoming a serious problem.”

I then frantically said, “He gave me some of his pre-workout and now my hand is back!”

She was silent for a moment, “your hand is back?”

“Yes, I drank the pre-workout, went into a trance, and now my hand is back, I gained muscle, and I'm scared.” 

“Okay okay okay, try and stay calm. I'm going to class right now. Just wait in your room and I'll be there later.”

I turned and looked at my door, “yeah… okay, I'm sorry for blowing you off. I had no control, that stuff he gave me is intense.”

“We still need to talk later but for now maybe convince him to move out after the lease, or maybe you can look for a new place.” 

“Baby the rent here is too good. I would rather lose my hand again than move somewhere else,”

“Jesus Trey, you pay seven hundred a month, yeah it's cheap but not worth the shit you go through.”

“Utility is included, it's worth it to me.”

“Well then try to convince him to move out or something.”

With that we said goodbye. I went back into my apartment. Stepping into my place I looked around. Vince was nowhere to be seen, so I went back to my room. In my room I locked my door and passed out on my bed. By the time I woke up it was dark outside. I blink my eyes open as it adjusts to the darkness. I checked my phone, there was a message from Chelsea. 

6:25: Hey, sorry got caught up, be there in thirty min

That was sent about fifteen minutes before I awoke. Sitting up in bed I heard a faint metallic hum through the wall. I stepped out into the hallway and saw the bathroom door slightly cracked. White light piercing through the darkness of the hall. A rattling came from it. Walking down the hall slowly, the closer I got the more I heard the sound grow louder. Along with the sound was almost ripping. As I got to the door I heard grunts coming from the room. Bringing my eyes to the door my gut sank.

Vince was in the tub, covered in blood. The back of his head to the door as he laid in the tub.  A turkey carver in one hand. He was chewing on something as he brought his leg to the side of the tub. His calf flexed he brought the cutter to his leg. The hum of the cutter tore through the thick muscle. With a grunt he brought it back and forth as it sliced his leg. He set down the carver and with both hands pulled the muscle off his leg. Fingers digging into the open gashes. Gritting his teeth the meat was pulled off. The leg dripped blood until the fibers wriggled back together on his leg. His hands brought the meat to his nose and he took a deep breath. Then he opened his mouth and took a large bite from it.

After the initial bite his hand reached out of the tub, it found a stack of newspaper. After wrapping it in the newspaper he set it next to four other wrapped pieces of meat. I stepped back from the doorway, but the floor creaked underneath my foot. I looked down at my foot for a second then looked back into the door crack. 

Vince was right at the doorway, looking right at me. His face was a shaking rage as he stared right at me. I stood, petrified by his drilling eyes. My breath became heavy. His fingers grabbed the door and pulled it open a little more. 

“I didn't think you were home Trey,” Vince said with narrowed eyes, “what are you doing spying on me?”

“I… I just thought I heard the… smoke alarm,” I lied.

“The one you took the batteries out before I moved in?”  

“Yeah, that one. Actually while I got your ear, I was wondering if you would consider not renewing your portion of the lease.”

His eyes narrowed “And why wouldn't I? Do you have a problem with me?” 

“To be real with you, I just think we have different personalities. Like our vibes just don't mesh well, oil and water you know?”

“It's you girl right? She's bitching at you to get me out.”

“No… well a little. You were extremely disrespectful to her. But I am telling you that I don't think we should be roommates cause I think we are just in different phases of our lives.”

He opened the door even more, “What's wrong little man? Can't handle rooming with someone that has their third eye open? A 6’1 alpha made from pure muscle in the form of an Olympian who sees the truth in the world?”

I couldn't help but laugh, “My guy, you just fall for the easiest piece of misinformation, spread it, and profit from minors whose frontal cortex can't tell bullshit yet. You don't understand basic decency. Honestly you're just a rude person, and I can't stand to hear you speak. You keep me up till early morning with your stupid podcast. Now I find out that you eat yourself cause you think you're such an adonis that no other meat can compete …also I'm six foot, and taller than you.”

His neck vein began to throb, “So you're so smart? I wasn't aware I'm living with the next Stephen Hawkin. And are you saying I'm below six foot?”

Now I was getting annoyed, “No I'm not saying I'm smart. I can admit that I am a complete dumbass who's barely keeping it together most of the time, but I also know the difference between pretending to be smart versus what you do!”

I paused for a moment, “And Yes! You are below six feet. Nobody cares if you are below it or not apart from you.”

His muscles on his chest began to move around, his eye began drooping. His neck seemed to grow. He pushed the door open. One arm looked to be growing longer than the other as his triceps and delts convulsed.

“You little shit. I am nothing but nice to you. Let you use my pre-workout, try to help you out with your dating problems. Let you have a new hand!” He grabbed my left hand and held it up, “how dare you throw it all back at me bro.”

I felt his hand begin to absorb into mine. I pulled it back, but caused our conjoined skin to rip apart. 

“Shit!” I yelled, pulling my hand back. He had caused my index finger to be degloved. Blood dripped onto the ground. Then I felt his skin grow back over my finger. It began to slowly spread across more of my hand. 

“What the hell is happening?” I said, losing control of my hand.

“If you can't appreciate what I do for you, then you don't deserve my gifts,” he then stepped forward. I backed away down the hall, holding my hand as it turned. His anger seemed to make his body spasm, muscles growing in and out. I turned and ran down the hall. Looking back I saw him fall down and then gallop on all fours. I rushed to the kitchen and grabbed a knife. Once he made it his body had become more bear-like than human. Then a slow mocking laugh came from him.

“What do you think that will do? Go ahead and try pussy,” his paw then punched into the cabinet. Out he pulled the container of ‘Super Max Pure Diesel ™’ and twisted the top. He then brought it up to his mouth and poured a mouthful in. He then set it down. His body bubbled and throbbed. 

“Ohhhh fuckkkk yesss!” 

He fell down to the ground. His hands became pools of flesh and veins on the ground as his body grew more and more. His shoulders began to overtake his head. Then I felt my left hand grab my wrist and attempt to turn the knife on me. I fought against it as I backed away towards the front door. 

“No! Not my hand!” I yelled, stumbling into the hallway. I kicked the door shut and fell to my knees holding my left hand down.

“Gimme back my hand!” I yelled, “GIMME BACK MY HAND!”

“Trey?” I heard behind me in the hallway.

Turning I saw Chelsea, and beside her a fire axe in an emergency box. The door to the apartment began to knock, and I felt Vince's control reach my wrist, “damn you did put on some muscle.”

“Baby! Get the axe!”

“What!?” 

“Axe now!” I screamed, then my hand wiggled itself from the grip and lunged at my throat. I could hear Vince laughing as the door began to break down. Chelsea broke the glass and retrieved the axe. I pulled my hand free and wrestled it to the ground. I pinned it there as she rushed over. 

“Cut it off!”

She looked hesitantly then squared up to it, and lined the axe into position. Vince continued to bellow a deep laugh as the door broke more. His face now peered through.

“Who's laughing now!” I yelled.

CHOP!

Blood flew everywhere as the first strike hit. I screamed in pain, but it wasn't enough. Still attached and growing back I yelled for her to swing again. 

CHOP!

My shirt was now red with my blood. One more swing was needed.

CHOP!

I pulled my freshly chopped hand. Chelsea pulled off her sweater and wrapped it around my stump. My old hand jumped up and ran away.

“What the fuck is happening?” She asked me while tying the sweater on my stump.

With a near delirious voice I answered, “I asked Vince to move out after I caught him chopping himself to pieces to eat. So then he took more of his stuff.”

She didn't have a response, her face was part shocked, and another part done with this. She then lifted me up to my feet, “Okay, lets just get the hell out of here.” 

We then rushed down the hall. A loud crash happened and we saw flesh grow out of the doorway. Muscles and skin moving in a strange symbiotic motion. Running to the staircase we began down it. Passing by a couple of guys who had no idea why we were running. I turned to warn them but it was too late. Tentacles of flesh came out and pulled them into the mass. Their bones breaking as they became absorbed. Once at the bottom floor we ran to the door.

“Shit… is this all because of the pre-workout?” Chelsea asked, stopping at the door.

“Yes, now let's book it,” I answered, trying to go out the door. 

“Trey stop. I have an idea on how we can stop this.”

“No, let's just get out of here before he eats us.”

“We can't let him eat anyone else.”

“Sure we can, now let's go,” I pushed the door open, but then I heard her running towards the other staircase.

“Goddammit!” 

I rushed after her, Vince started coming through the door to the lobby. His body became a long cube of meat as he pushed through the doorway. A large mouth and eyes marked the front as what must have been his abs now worked as long legs.

“You think I'm short now Trey?” He laughed as I ran to the other staircase. His body would disperse on each step he took. 

I followed Chelsea up the stairs to my floor. Once in the hallway it was drenched in blood and chunks of meat caught on door handles and anything protruding from the wall was left. I could see what must have been his ass go down the opposite stairs, as his front half climbed up the stairs behind me. Chelsea then went into my apartment. Once inside I saw her holding the container of pre-workout. 

“What are you doing?” 

“Just get him close enough, I have a plan,” she opened the fridge and grabbed all the protein milk and began pouring it into a large container.

With a shake of my head I went out into the hallway and saw Vince coming down. Tentacles shot muscles to the walls as he dragged himself down the hallway.

“I tried to be friendly, tried to have your back from that slut you call a girlfriend. No, you just had to be a baby backed bitch,” he said, his flesh fanning across the floor then sucking back into him as he got closer.

Chelsea wanted me to bring him closer so I did, “Still doesn't change the fact you're not six foot. Hell doesn't change the fact that no matter how much bulk you put on, you still have small hands.”

“The fuck you say about my hands bro?” 

“You've got dainty little hands. Shit I bet a calcium deficient racoon could beat your ass in a thumb war.”

His body began to shake as his anger built up. He started down the hallway, “what's wrong guy? Pissed that your Napoleon complex doesn't make you cool, it's just annoying as hell to anyone that can interact with the other half of the population. You roided-out loser.” 

He became faster, I turned to go back into the apartment but felt a sharp pain in my foot nailing it into place. 

“Ahhh fuck!”

I looked down and saw my severed hand around the knife I had earlier. It pinned my foot down by stabbing through it into the floor.

Vince got closer and closer. His body wriggled as he headed towards me at full speed. Tentacles reached out towards me and I thought it was the end for me. Before they hit their target Chelsea jumps out with a large bottle. Tossing it in front of me, the tentacles went for it instead of me.

Vince laughed, “what was that? Giving me my milk?”

“Along with all the pre-workout you inbred antisemitic prick!” She yelled. 

Vince's eyes widened, “No… that's too much! You fucking whore!” His body then began growing even more, his face disappearing into the mass. Bubbling muscles popped. Eventually the walls began to break apart and the popcorn ceiling started to fall.

“You bitch! Both of you!”

“Chelsea,” I said looking at her.

“No time to talk, let's go!” She yelled and tried to grab me. She reached down and grabbed the knife and pulled it free. The hand was flailing and crunched up like a dead spider before large blisters spread throughout it and popped.

She had my arm over her shoulder and helped keep my weight up as we sprinted back down the hall, but before we could make it to the stairs, a timber broke and blocked our exit.

“Shit no!” She yelled. Down the hall Vince's flesh blob began to grow more. For a brief second a massive baby face came out and cried as the building became destroyed.

“We need to find some way out!” She said looking for a solution.

I looked at her, “Chelsea… There's something I need to tell you.”

“Now is not the time Trey,” she said trying to find a way out. 

I grabbed her hands and looked into her eyes, “these last few months have been chaotic and insane. You have been the only normalcy in it…I just wanted to say,”

She looked back at me, her eyes widening, seemingly knowing what I was about to say. The building rumbled as the blisters on Vince's mass popped everywhere.

“Chels… do you want to find an apartment together?”

“Yes Trey…let's find a place together.”

We embraced knowing these may be our final moments. The walls began to fall apart and Vince broke through to the open night through the ceiling. The bottom floors beneath crumbled, causing the building to implode. Then he blew up, sending the building and meat flying. Concrete, wood, drywall and flesh sent flying into the neighboring building and street. Crushing cars and light posts.

Firefighters found us hours later. Somehow we made it through. Apart from the prior injuries to myself, neither of us have had a scrape. Stitches for my foot and stump, along with an ambulance ride will put me into even more debt. They did remove some costs after I asked for an itemized receipt. I hate [Redacted color for legal reasons] Cross [Redacted color for legal reasons] Shield.

It's been ten months since. Chelsea and I moved into a new apartment. Two bedrooms and two baths. I've been working on my communication skills. Rent is a lot steeper and we both work as much as we can. I was able to find the PS2 in the rubble of the building. We celebrated our first anniversary going to a Chinese place. All in all, life is pretty much normal again. I even made a new clothes hanger hook. Though with prices on rent increasing with our renewed lease and other expenses, we have been discussing getting a new roommate. With Chelsea's vetting, I'm sure the next one can't be nearly as bad as my last two.

I forgot to add something that did happen a week or so ago. I was getting out of the shower, and went over to brush my teeth. Getting ready for bed, but when I looked into the mirror I saw a weird cyst form  where the love dart hit on my neck that hadn't been there before my shower. I could see my pulse through it, so I squeezed it with my fingers. That's when burning pain felt like my nervous system was being wrapped up on a fork as if it were spaghetti. 

I fell back against the wall and clenched my neck. Looking in the mirror I saw slithering in my neck. Then two small stalks popped out of the cyst. Falling to my knees I felt something slimy slowly crawl out.  With my one hand I grabbed it and pulled it out. Throwing it across the room I bent over and caught my breath.

“You really thought you outsmarted me Trey?” A nasally voice came from where I had tossed the slimy morph.

“No, no, no, No!” I said in disbelief. I then reached out with my hook, trying to catch him. The slug dodged me and made it to the air vent. 

“I'll be back for vengeance!” He yelled, “I am INEVITABLE!”

Chelsea rushed into the bathroom, worry etched on her face, “what's wrong?”

Clenching my neck while on my knees I turned to look at her.

[NioCorp’s Scandium Acquisition Sets Stage for First Vertically...](https://marketchameleon.com/articles/b/2025/12/5/niocorp-scandium-acquisition-positions-vertically-integrated-us-supply-chain)

[QUICK POST.... EXPECTING a busy day! with Coffee...](https://reddit.com/link/1peugqk/video/1mfcec3ftd5g1/player)

NioCorp Developments Ltd. (NASDAQ: NB) just completed an $8.4 million acquisition of scandium alloy manufacturing assets and intellectual property from FEA Materials LLC. This marks a potential turning point in U.S. advanced materials: for the first time, the country may soon see a vertically integrated mine-to-market scandium supply chain, from extraction through to finished alloy parts—critical for defense and commercial sectors.

# Vertical Integration Unlocks Supply Chain Control

The acquisition gives NioCorp the ability to produce aluminum-scandium (Al-Sc) master alloy domestically. FEA’s innovative technology skips an entire step in the production process by converting scandium oxide directly into Al-Sc alloy, improving efficiency and lowering barriers for future manufacturing. Once NioCorp’s Elk Creek mine and processing facility in Nebraska are fully funded and operational, the company aims to control every link: from mining, through scandium oxide production, to alloy fabrication. This initiative responds to growing U.S. demand—particularly in sectors where lightweight, high-strength alloys are vital, such as aerospace and advanced manufacturing.

# Government and Defense Partnerships Provide Support

NioCorp’s supply chain ambitions are buoyed by robust public sector backing. The Pentagon’s Title III Program recently earmarked up to $10 million to support Elk Creek’s development and to fund high-purity scandium metal production, a crucial input for both electronics and structural applications. NioCorp is collaborating with Lockheed Martin to design and test Al-Sc parts for advanced fighter jets, positioning the company as a key supplier in the national defense technology ecosystem.

# Broader Market Impact: Niobium, Titanium, and Rare Earth Potential

While scandium is the headline, NioCorp’s Elk Creek project is designed to deliver a suite of critical minerals: niobium (for steel alloys), titanium (for lightweight structures), and the potential for both light and heavy rare earth oxides (vital for high-strength magnets). The company’s focus on high-value metals for infrastructure and advanced technology aims to fill longstanding supply chain gaps—most of which have, until now, depended on imports and overseas refining, especially from China.

# Industry and Strategic Context: A Push for Domestic Resilience

Industry observers will note NioCorp’s move comes as the U.S. looks to secure sources of critical materials that underpin defense readiness and advanced manufacturing. CEO Mark Smith highlights this as a response to past scandium market disruptions and China’s market dominance. The inclusion of strategic partners and acknowledgment of industry peers—such as Rio Tinto, already producing scandium in Canada—signals the importance of a diversified, continental supply base.

# Key Takeaways for Investors and Industry

* **U.S. supply chain control:** If project financing and facility buildout succeed, NioCorp could become the first to fully integrate domestic scandium supply, lowering risks of import dependence.
* **Process innovation:** Direct oxide-to-alloy conversion streamlines production and potentially cuts costs and lead times.
* **Strong institutional backing:** Government investment and OEM partnerships provide important validation, although the Elk Creek Project’s success still hinges on full financing and execution.
* **Multi-metal focus:** Elk Creek’s product suite—including niobium and titanium—broadens potential revenue streams beyond scandium.

# Looking Ahead: Financing Remains the Hurdle

For all its promise, the plan’s execution relies on NioCorp securing additional financing for Elk Creek. Management underscores support from the Pentagon and strategic partnerships as encouraging signals, but significant capital needs remain. Should NioCorp succeed, investors and industry stakeholders may witness a reshaping of how critical alloys are sourced and manufactured in the United States.

IMHO: & Speculation on FEA IP aquisition\~

# NioCorp’s Scandium Acquisition Just Quietly Lit the Match on a Fully U.S.-Controlled Scandium Alloy Industry

NioCorp Developments (NASDAQ: NB) just dropped one of the most strategically important pieces of news in years: an $8.4M acquisition of scandium alloy manufacturing assets and IP from FEA Materials LLC. On the surface this looks like a small tech buyout. In reality? It’s the first serious step toward a **vertically integrated, mine-to-alloy scandium supply chain in the United States**—something the DoD, aerospace primes, and industrial OEMs have been chasing for over a decade.

# Vertical Integration: The Piece the U.S. Has Never Had

For the first time, a U.S. company will control *every step* of scandium production:

* Ore →
* Scandium concentrate →
* Scandium oxide →
* **Direct oxide-to-Al-Sc master alloy** →
* Finished components.

FEA’s proprietary technology eliminates the traditional multi-step process and converts scandium oxide *directly* into Al-Sc alloy. That alone removes one of the biggest bottlenecks in the sector and dramatically simplifies scaling. Once the Elk Creek Project is financed and built, NioCorp becomes the only player in North America with this level of vertical control.

# Defense & Government Signals Are Getting Louder

This is happening alongside major U.S. defense movements:

* The Pentagon has already committed up to **$10M through Title III** for scandium metal production and Elk Creek process development.
* Lockheed Martin is collaborating with NioCorp on **Al-Sc components for next-generation fighter platforms**.
* The DoD has publicly listed scandium as one of the most strategically at-risk materials in the entire supply chain.

Vertical integration isn't a business preference—it's a national security requirement. This acquisition proves the government is backing a U.S. scandium ecosystem, not just a mine.

# And Elk Creek Isn't Just About Scandium

While the scandium story grabs the headlines, NioCorp’s project is built on a broader critical materials suite:

* **Niobium** (high-strength steels, vehicles, reactors)
* **Titanium/TiCl₄** (aerospace, armor, hypersonics)
* **Rare earths** (Nd, Pr, Dy, Tb for high-strength magnets)

This is one of the only U.S. projects targeting *seven* of the top 60 USGS critical minerals in one location—exactly the type of project policymakers keep saying America needs.

# Strategic Context: A Move the U.S. Has Been Waiting For

For years, the U.S. has been almost completely dependent on outside sources for scandium alloys. Even Rio Tinto’s Canadian production only scratches the surface of demand. NioCorp’s acquisition isn’t just a corporate move—it directly responds to the government’s push to rebuild a domestic advanced-materials base that China cannot influence or disrupt.

This also explains why NioCorp has referenced:

* Strategic partners
* OEM collaborations
* Title III scaling
* And even future U.S.-based alloy manufacturing facilities

…all before the mine is even built.

# Key Takeaways

* **First true U.S. scandium alloy vertical integration.**
* **New oxide-to-alloy tech can reduce costs and simplify scaling.**
* **Strong defense and government validation already in place.**
* **Multi-metal revenue streams add long-term stability.**
* **Financing is still the gating item—but the strategic backing is real.**

# Bottom Line

If the Elk Creek financing package lands, NioCorp won’t just be a mine. It will be the **anchor of the United States’ next-generation scandium, niobium, titanium, and rare-earth ecosystem**—exactly what defense, aerospace, and advanced manufacturing sectors have been waiting for.

# IMHO~ The game just changed for NioCorp — massively.

By acquiring FEA’s Scandium alloy intellectual property, the company now controls the only U.S.-based pathway to commercial AND defense-grade Scandium-Aluminum alloy production. This isn’t a minor bolt-on acquisition; this is the missing puzzle piece that the Pentagon, aerospace primes, and industrial base planners have been waiting on for years. ***Without these patents, nobody could legally or technically deploy Sc-Al alloys at scale. Now NioCorp owns the keys!***

**NioCorp now effectively chooses who gets to join the new U.S. Scandium supply chain — and the shortlist is surprisingly small.**  Meanwhile Lockheed Martin becomes the obvious anchor customer, since Sc-Al alloys offer huge mass reductions for NGAD, ISR platforms, and hypersonic systems. They could help fund the new DFARS facility through DPA Title III, which is exactly what the DoD has been positioning itself to do for critical mineral supply chains.

https://reddit.com/link/1peugqk/video/r0qtfxtkyd5g1/player

**What this means for NioCorp shareholders is simple but seismic: the company now sits at the center of a fully U.S.-owned, U.S-controlled Scandium vertical integration structure that the Pentagon cannot afford to lose.**  IMHO\~ This creates a natural anti-takeover shield — foreign buyers are blocked outright, and even domestic buyers would face national security restrictions unless the structure remained intact. NioCorp is no longer just a mining company; it is the gatekeeper of the only scalable Scandium alloy ecosystem in the Western Hemisphere.

Throw in Ames Lab, Creative Engineers, Nanoscale materials modeling, IBC and the emerging DoD-backed industrial ecosystem around Scandium alloys, and you’ve got the blueprint for a new strategic materials industry — all rooted in Nebraska. This ecosystem did not exist yesterday. It exists today because NioCorp acquired the one asset nobody else had. The Open House event on Dec. 5 may be the first time we see the full picture — and the market has no clue how big the implications truly are.

( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Here is no Question of Holy Books quotes, Personal Experiences, Faith or Belief. i accept that Sometimes Faith is also Blind. Here is already Practical explanation which already proved that every\`1 else in this world is nothing more then Busy Foolish and totally idiot.

for context: i have this friend na laging may pera. as in lagi niyang chini-chika na may budget siya for this, for that, galing daw sa mga lalaki niya. may full-time job naman siya, pero yung “extra” money niya na lagi niyang pini-flex comes from multiple guys na nagpapadala sa kanya. idk kung mga sugar daddy ba ‘to or what (honestly, buhay niya ‘yan, no judgment), pero gets—may pera siya, and he makes sure we know.

pero ito na yung nakakainis . . .

kapag kami na friends niya ang kasama (sa gala, eat out, coffee, beach trips), bigla siyang nagiging broke. as in sobrang pahirapan siya maglabas ng pera. hindi rin namin siya pinipilit manlibre ha, kasi may pera naman kami. pero si bakla, gustong-gusto pang magpalibre sa amin.
tapos lagi niyang linya yung “kayo na lang muna magbayad, i-send ko na lang share ko later.” spoiler alert: pahirapan pa siya singilin. minsan pa kailangan pa i-follow up ng ilang beses, and nakakailang na.

then here’s the plot twist.

nalaman namin na sa ibang friend group niya super generous daw siya. like nanlilibre si bakla! nagbabato ng pera. nagshe-share agad sa bill. walang follow-up. big spender ang atake, gano'n!

nalaman ko ‘to through a mutual (na di ko naman ka-close), and nagulat talaga ako. kasi i’ve known him for almost a decade and never ko siyang nakita maging ganyan sa amin.

we even tried na kausapin siya about it, in a light and joking way para hindi siya ma-offend. pero as usual, si bakla . . . deadma. parang wala lang. parang kami pa yung weird for noticing.

so ayon. medyo draining lang kasi ang tagal na naming tino-tolerate yung behavior niya thinking na baka may pinagdadaanan, baka may reason, etc. pero after finding out na selective lang pala generosity niya, medyo nakaka-icky talaga. like bakit sa amin siya kuripot? bakit sa amin siya palibre? bakit sa amin niya recommended yung pagiging “broke” personality niya?

anyway needed to let this out before ako sumabog internally at makapagsalita pa sa kanya ng masasamang mga words chz thanks for reading lol",13,1764939335.0,RantAndVentPH,3,1.0,False
1peuch6,https://www.reddit.com/r/PokemonScarlet/comments/1peuch6/final_end_of_all_knowledges/,final end of all knowledge's,"Practical Explanation ( For Example ) :- \`1st of all can you tell me every single seconds detail from that time when you born ?? ( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Here is no Question of Holy Books quotes, Personal Experiences, Faith or Belief. i accept that Sometimes Faith is also Blind. Here is already Practical explanation which already proved that every\`1 else in this world is nothing more then Busy Foolish and totally idiot.

For five years, it had dictated my life's architecture: the quick, vague answers about my dating life, the meticulously crafted social media bubble, and the constant, dull ache of being fundamentally dishonest with the two people I loved most. I was twenty-two, freshly graduated, and working a job I genuinely liked. I had stability, a cat named Miso, and, most importantly, I had Ethan. Ethan was the catalyst, not because he pushed me, but because loving him made the lie feel unbearable. Holding his hand in public was easy. Explaining his existence to my parents who pictured their son marrying a nice woman named Sarah was impossible. Every Sunday dinner was a minefield. My mother, Maria, would ask about my coworkers, fishing for potential dates. My father, Robert, would recount stories of his youth, occasionally slipping in archaic views he didn't realize were hurtful. I would smile, deflect, and feel the jagged stone twist a little deeper. The decision didn't arrive with fireworks or a dramatic confrontation. It arrived on a Tuesday evening. I was home alone, looking at a framed photo of us from my high school graduation three happy people, two of whom didn't know the third one at all. I thought of Ethan, who deserved to be introduced by name, not hidden in the shadow of my fear. The anxiety was a current, but under it, a steel wire of exhaustion snapped. I couldn’t afford the energy to pretend anymore. When they came home, the house settled into a familiar, domestic calm: the clink of dinner plates, the low hum of the evening news. My father was flipping through a magazine, and my mother was scrolling through her phone, sending a text with her brow furrowed in concentration. The moment felt intensely ordinary, which made the coming detonation even more terrifying. I walked over to the sofa and sat on the edge of the coffee table, directly facing them. The small movement drew their attention. ""Everything okay, sweetie?"" my mom asked, her eyes already back on the screen. I opened my mouth, but the first sound was just a rusty cough. I tried again, focusing on my father’s kind, tired eyes, which looked exactly like mine. I knew this was going to hurt them, not because they hated me, but because it was change, it was the unknown, and it defied the gentle, silent script they had written for my life. I inhaled sharply, tasting the dust in the air, and let the words go. They were soft, almost swallowed by the TV's drone, but they were finally real. ""I need to tell you guys something important."" My mother put her phone down. My father slowly lowered the magazine. The silence that followed was so complete it seemed to swallow the house whole. My heart hammered against the stone in my chest, threatening to shatter it. I looked at the floor, then back at them, and saw only waiting. The words came out in a rush, a clumsy, honest tumble: ""I've been seeing someone for eight months. He's wonderful. His name is Ethan."" I paused, my throat dry, and finished the sentence that had been trapped inside me for years. And finally, I told my parents that I'm gay.",3,1764939248.0,lgbt,0,1.0,False

With that, here are some of them translated to English by fellow Redditor bisayaawa:

SLIDE 1

MORCON

1 pound pork meat  
3 spoons of sliced ham  
3 spoons of sliced tocino  
3 spoons of sliced onion  
1/2 ground black pepper

Cut the lean part of the pork into flat slices, about the length of a dangaw (length from thumb to the little finger when stretched out) and the width of a tukaw (length from thumb to the tip of index finger when stretched out). Slice the excess fatty portions into small pieces and use the lean slices to wrap them together with the ham, tocino, onion, and ground black pepper. Roll each tightly and secure with thin pork trimmings, shaping them to about the size of a baby’s arm. Place the rolls in a pan with enough water, then boil and simmer until the liquid reduces and the meat is cooked through. Once done, untie the rolls and serve.

TERNERA ASADA

1 pound beef  
4 heads garlic  
1/4 pound tocino  
1/2 cup lemon juice Chinese celery (kinsay)  
Salt and pepper to taste

Cut the beef in half and place it in a pan, then slow-cook in a clay furnace until nearly tender. Remove the beef and, in the same pan, fry the tocino until the fat is rendered. Return the beef to the pan and add the crushed garlic, Chinese celery, salt, and pepper. Pour in water (or broth) together with the lemon juice, stirring constantly as it boils to ensure even cooking. Continue simmering until the liquid reduces and the mixture thickens to a slightly sticky consistency.

KARIKARI

1 beef foot (trotters)  
1 banana blossom  
1 plate of peeled hyacinth beans  
1 plate of string beans  
1/2 fried rice  
2 spoons of peanuts  
8 garlic cloves  
1 onion  
4 eggplants  
3 tomatoes

Thoroughly wash the beef trotters, chop them into pieces, and boil. Skim off the scum that forms, then continue boiling until the trotters are tender. Rinse the trotters, then boil and simmer again to further tenderize.

In a separate pan, sauté garlic, onions, and tomatoes until aromatic. Add finely chopped banana blossoms, eggplant, hyacinth beans (buway), and string beans (batung). Continue sautéing until fragrant.

Add the tender beef trotters along with their broth, then stir in the fried rice and peanuts.

Carefully remove the boiled banana blossoms, chop them separately to remove the “gooey” parts, and prevent darkening of the mixture.

Once everything is cooked, serve hot with a side of fried and salted shrimp paste (bagoong) for dipping.

SLIDE 2

MANOK NGA MAY SALSANG VERDE (CHICKEN WITH GREEN SAUCE)

1/2 chicken  
2 tablespoons cooking oil  
3 stalks Chinese celery  
1 and 1/2 cups tablespoons water  
1 tablespoon flour salt

Rinse the chicken thoroughly, then lightly fry in a pan with oil until lightly browned and partially cooked. Remove the chicken, add the chopped celery, and sauté until fragrant. Stir in the water and flour to thicken the sauce, then return the chicken to the pan. Season with salt and simmer until fully cooked. Served best with sweet peas.

KARI NGA MANOK (CHICKEN CURRY)

1/2 chicken  
3 onions  
1/2 teaspoon curry powder or turmeric  
1 cup coconut milk  
3 potatoes  
1 spoon cooking oil

Rinse and boil the chicken until tender, reserving the broth. In a separate pan, sauté the onions in cooking oil, then add the chicken and broth. Stir in the curry powder, coconut milk (and chopped potatoes), and let simmer until cooked through. Do not overcook to avoid a strong odor. Turmeric may be used as a substitute if you prefer it over curry powder.

SLIDE 3

SOPA DE MACARRONES A LA ITALIANA (ITALIAN MACARONI SOUP)

Boil and simmer macaroni until tender, allowing the water to reduce as much as possible. Stir in Flanders cheese, along with a small amount of estofado broth if available, to enhance the flavor. For added richness, mix in some fried eggs.

This dish may be heavy on digestion, so it is not recommended for those who are unwell.

SOPA PILARICA (PILARICA SOUP)

Slice some bread, coat it in sugar, and then toast. Boil and simmer in milk, then add salt to taste. Whisked egg yolk may also be added. This is a sweet treat for children.

SOPA SPAGHETTI (SPAGHETTI SOUP)

1/4 chicken  
1 ham  
1/2 pound pork  
1 bowl shredded cheese  
6 garlic cloves  
1/2 cup broth  
1 onion  
3 tomatoes  
6 tbsp cooking oil  
1/6 tbsp black pepper  
1 bundle spaghetti pasta  
salt to taste

Slice the chicken, pork, and ham into small pieces, then fry them together with the diced onion, garlic, tomato, salt, and pepper until the fat is rendered. Remove everything and place in a wide bowl.

Boil the spaghetti pasta until slightly tender, then transfer it into the bowl. Sprinkle with cheese, pour in some broth, and bake in the furnace until fully cooked, adjusting the heat so it doesn’t burn.

This dish is best served on the dry side, but if it turns out too dry, add a bit of water or broth to your liking. Serve directly in the same bowl it was cooked in, preferably with another bowl underneath for support.

YEMA

15 egg yolks  
14 teaspoons sugar

Beat the egg yolks until smooth. Caramelize the sugar and let it cool slightly. Add the whipped egg yolks and cook, stirring continuously, until the mixture thickens (to a clay-like consistency). Shape into calamansi-seed-sized balls, then coat in sugar or caramel.

PLAN DE ARROZ (RICE FLAN)

1/4 liter rice  
6 eggs  
1/2 lb sugar  
1 teaspoon cinnamon powder

Boil the rice until fully cooked, then mix in the beaten eggs, sugar, and cinnamon powder. Mold it, coat with syrup, add a little water, and bake in the furnace, allowing the steam to help the flan set and take shape.

SLIDE 4

FLAN DE CAFE (COFFEE FLAN)

3 cans milk or cream  
1 can roasted coffee  
8 tablespoons sugar  
12 eggs

Brew the coffee and filter it, then stir in the milk—carabao milk is best, but cow’s milk or condensed cream may also be used. Beat the egg yolks, then slowly combine with the milk and coffee mixture. Add sugar to taste, using less if condensed cream is used since it is already sweetened.

Then, prepare as you would a traditional flan.

FLAN NGA MANZANAS (APPLE FLAN)

6 apples  
6 eggs  
6 tablespoons sugar  
1/2 cup water

Peel the apples, remove the cores, then boil and simmer until tender. Mash the apples or press them through abaca cloth along with the simmered water until smooth. In a separate pot, gently heat the egg yolks without boiling, then add sugar to taste. Combine with the apple mixture and prepare as you would with traditional flan. Place the pot inside a pan of boiling water, cover it, and place hot coals on the lid to cook evenly.

FLAN

14 eggs  
14 teaspoons sugar  
12 teaspoons evaporated milk  
1 spoon flour

Beat the egg yolks thoroughly, gradually adding the sugar, flour, and milk until smooth. Reserve two teaspoons of sugar and caramelize it over gentle heat until golden. Pour the caramel into a buttered baking dish, coating the bottom evenly. Add the egg, flour, and milk mixture over the caramel. Bake in a moderate oven until set and lightly golden on top. Let cool before serving.

I simply cannot figure out why all my coffee beans taste almost the same. Whether it is a Gesha, an Ethiopian bean, or something similar, the resulting taste I get in the cup is nearly identical.
I have tried using the same recipe over a longer period to change only one thing at a time, and I have also tried completely different recipes after sufficiently testing the individual recipe.

My grinder is a 1Zpresso JX Pro (Grey Dot), where I typically grind between 3.2.0 and up to 4.0.0.
I am using a flat bottom Timemore B75 brewer.
My kettle is a Fellow Stagg EKG standard.

One recipe I have typically used is as follows:
20g coffee to 300g water
30 sec bloom – 60g
45 sec – 150g total
1:30 min – 240g total
2:20 min – 300g water total
Temperature: 92-99°
Both high and low agitation have been attempted.

Everything is noted in a notebook to keep track of variables.
The beans are from Danish roasters, meaning they are Nordic light-roasted.
What could be the reason for the uniform taste despite switching beans? My only guess is my 1Zpresso JX Pro?",0,1764939086.0,pourover,9,0.5,False

A few days ago, I had the most emotive and vivid dream I've ever had. It felt like it lasted for years, like I lived a whole other lifetime while I was asleep. I was in love with a man I've never met. I could feel him, smell him, his voice was so *real*. At one point in the dream I took a sip of my way-too-hot coffee and it burnt my tongue and I *felt* the burn. We had children together. Lived this perfectly normal 'mundane' life. But I felt peaceful, safe and so fiercely loved.

When I woke up, and I had that 'oh, it was just a dream' thought – instead of brushing it off like a thousand times before with a thousand different dreams – I felt this deep *longing* and a feeling that was literally akin to grief. Like that's the only way I can describe it.

It's been a few days now and I still have that deep yearning and grieving feeling. I'm grieving a man I've never met. Children that never existed. And I've honestly been bought to tears over it. I know it sounds insane. I know it seems so fucking dumb. Logically I *know* it was a dream. I can tell myself that, I KNOW that. I know non of it was real, non of it existed. But I don't know why that isn't enough for me to just get over it? I don't know why I'm feeling this way.

Realistically I think dreams are like less than thirty minutes? But this really felt like years in a dream. I've had vivid dreams before, sure. But not like this. Not where I could smell the rain and feel his hands on my skin. Where I birthed children and held them skin on skin and FELT THEIR WEIGHT ON MY CHEST.

It's got me fucked up. I'm sure it'll all just be fine in time, I'll get over it. I mean, I have to. There's no other option. But I can't even begin to explain how it's messing with my head to be grieving for a life that never happened.

I don't know what I want from this post. Don't think I need validation or a harsh reality check I just needed to get it off my chest. Let them exist in a corner of the Internet instead of just in my dreams. 

For added context: I am 30F and happily single. Like genuinely happily single. I don't ever feel like I'm missing a relationship or wanting one — I actively avoid dating etc. I am happy with my life. Occasionally I have those 'I should have done more when I was younger'/'I want to burn my life to the ground and start over' kind of feelings but no more often than the average person. So I think that's why this also just spun me for a loop because like what the fuck? ",6,1764939046.0,offmychest,11,1.0,False

1peu87z,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1peu87z/i_was_asked_to_leave_by_housemates_for_drying_the/,I was asked to leave by housemates for drying the dishes,"For context: I was living with 4 other ppl at the time to save money while living in another city for my undergrad studies(all males around 19-24 yo). Each of us had our own rooms with a shared kitchen. The kitchen did not have a dishwasher since this is not common where I live, so all dishes where done by hand by whoever used them. Overall the house was very well cleaned but there were somethings that got overlooked, one of those things was the dish towels.

I refused to use the dish towel to dry the utensils I was going to use bc these towels were also used by my housemates to dry their hands after touching raw meat and eggs(and used for cleaning dry stuff like coffee grounds, flour, sugar, bread crumbs and alikes off the counter. The housemates denies this but I saw some of them with my own eyes doing this on a frequent basis). I instead dried the utensils on my bath towels(for lack of other quick alternatives) which I didn't mind since only I used those towels and knew exactly how clean they were, whereas the dish towels (which they claimed were washed every week) were washed every other week when they were washed at all. Most of the time we had buy new ones every month bc no one ever washed them and they were too dirty to keep.

The utensils dried in my towels were for my use only, they were all hand washed and put to air dry after I was done using them(my housemates at the time seemed really focused on this, like I was drying the utensils with my towel and putting them on the cabinet for them to use and if I wasn't clear enough: The utensils dried in my towels were thoroughly hand washed and put to air dry before anyone other than me touched them). I am aware that using my bath towels is not the best way but I was very poor at the time and couldn't afford to be buying my own dish towels at the time.

How it all came down: I told one of them that sometimes I used the paper towels to dry some utensils bc I didn't feel comfortable using the dish towels bc of how dirty they were. That person then told the whole house that I was using all of the paper towels (which we shared) and all 4 of them came to confront me saying it was my fault that the paper towels didn't last long enough. And to defend myself I told them I barely used the paper towels, most of the time I used my bath towels to dry them. And it was downhill from that, I tried explaining myself but they seemed to purposefully misunderstand me saying that I was disgusting and was spreading diseases to everyone there. The whole situation made me feel horrible bc I didn't feel like it was no big deal, that's why I told them upfront when confronted.

One or two months later they asked me to leave and I left the following month.

I won't give much more context since I feel it takes it away from the main situation all I'll say is they were always very friendly in between them, but never to me.

So I ask: am I the asshole? ",1,1764938967.0,AITAH,4,0.67,False

( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Here is no Question of Holy Books quotes, Personal Experiences, Faith or Belief. i accept that Sometimes Faith is also Blind. Here is already Practical explanation which already proved that every\`1 else in this world is nothing more then Busy Foolish and totally idiot.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Source(s):

every \`1 is already Blind in this world and if you will follow another Blind then you both will fall in hole. so try to follow that person who have Spiritual Eyes who can Guide you on Actual Right Path. ( my Authority & Guide is my Spiritual Master "" Srila Prabhupada "" )

1peu5gl,https://www.reddit.com/r/frederickmd/comments/1peu5gl/squirrels_in_the_ceiling/,Squirrel(s) in the Ceiling,"TL;DR I have a squirrel situation and am seeking remediation advice and possibly some slight comforting.

I own a rowhome in downtown near Hood / the hospital where there are more squirrels than there is air to breathe. I’ve heard mice in the ceiling in years past and have largely ignored them, but these are almost certainly squirrels because they sound like King Kong in comparison. 

Has anyone had any luck with squirrel remediation in the area? It’s bad enough they rip the yard to shreds, but that’s their space after all; I’ve conceded long ago. And I would gladly offer up my lawn for another season of the crater digging competition if meant they would vacate my house. 

I will likely get downvoted all the way to hell for this by you “animals >>> people” people (although I’m an animal lover who typically agrees with that sentiment), but I have a genuine question: How the heck are squirrels not considered such a nuisance that the city aims to limit their population? They wreak havoc absolutely everywhere you turn and are always screaming and yelling at each other to boot.

I understand there are protected species and whatnot, but “pest” population control is a common thing. For example, many south Florida cities / neighborhoods unfortunately have to do this with iguanas due to how big and destructive to property they become. I know—using *that place* as a measuring stick for anything other than beautiful weather in January is questionable behavior at best and terrorist behavior at worst, but it’s factual so go easy on me.

Anyhow, if the squirrels were quietly hanging out up there—IDK, eating nuts, smoking cigarettes, whatever—I wouldn’t be awake at 4am writing this and I’d have no real issue. But they’re going so ham that I can hear them over the very loud central heat and an old, screechy white noise machine. 

And perhaps I could use some advice on this too, but I’m just a normal guy trying to get some normal rest so I can go about my normal life, which includes (and is mostly limited to): Waking up at a normal hour that is still too dark to be considered normal, eating a normal and nutritious coffee breakfast, and reporting to my normal job normally a few minutes late—all so I can pay my normal bills (such as the mortgage for the house with the squadron of squirrels in the ceiling).

So… I’ll take any squirrel remediation or general life advice you can give me. Even if it’s squirrelly. ",7,1764938741.0,frederickmd,4,0.82,False

Firstly thanks for taking time out of your day to read this and secondly I’m sorry if there are any grammatical errors.

/

I (M19) am a newish adult, I am one of four children and I am by far the least favorite of my siblings despite being the second oldest, I have diagnosed depression, adhd I lack a lot of motivation to do things that should ideally better my life. I am not academically or creatively talented and I struggle with memory problems, but I’d say im a bare minimum at most sort of guy, I have never had a job and fear I never might. But most of all I don’t have much of a desire to continue living , I dont have anything to work towards as a goal or a want to go on, I have an abusive family that verbally degrades me and puts me down any chance I try to do something for myself, they use to be physically violent and abusive but thankfully that has stopped / died down. 

I am not really great at social interactions or writing my feelings out about things, I’ve been to several psychologists and therapists, called several hotlines and been put on different medications to no avail, I am a shut-in, since 2017 I’d say I’ve been on a mental decline but the biggest dive off a cliff was 2020, not for covid but a teacher out to get me, my English teacher who had it out for me, I dont know why but every attempt to be creative and do more was shut down by her so much to the point that she failed me and thus I couldn’t pass my Year 9 school level with my friends, I was a social but quiet kid though when I had been failed for that year and was told I had to repeat (with my friends moving to another campus) or find another thing to do, I made the difficult decision to move to another school, my younger sister had already been there so I was able to get in easily for year 10, to be on the same pace but as I settled in, bullying from other students followed I had died socially and just kept to myself struggling to keep going just to fail the following year because I didn’t want to attend anymore, since then I’ve gone to a trade school to finish out my education, I finished it this year despite wanting to drop out for several years, and even then it was barely a pass because I had barely attended but was in the good graces of the teachers.

Ive been through a fair share of drama between friend groups, lost a lot of people and I’ve definitely changed from a social and somewhat toxic person to a more brutally honest and quiet person who enjoys making other people happy, but I can’t see myself living much longer, I’ve been receiving payments for studying this year by the government which has helped me stave off mooching off my single mother for my monthly phone bill of about 30$ but  , I’ve become independent in that regard and I would have loved to have some income sooner instead of pocket money but since I was legally able to work (2020) I’ve been rejected to every job I’ve applied for, retail, fast food, and only had one interview which failed as well, I’ve been trying to find experience but have been denied at every turn for the last 5 years and not having any job experience going into the trade i studied for scares me.

 But I don’t have a desire to go on with living, I don’t really have a need to stay alive, I just kind of funnel my funds into giving things to my friends, making them feel good for the time that I’m here until I ultimately do something stupid and off myself, i don’t ever expect repayment, but i feel like spreading some sort of happiness to them means everything to me.

My brother is older than me by at least 7 years, the eldest of four, him and my two younger sisters make being at home miserable, my mother isn’t as bad as them but is still pretty harsh on me, ever since I was little I’ve been compared to my brother, always hearing snide comments about why I couldn’t I be more like him, I never got time to myself, to breath or experience my childhood as it was always robbed away by doing things I never wanted to do, my father was the worst until the split in 2014, since I was born he made me do all these sporting programs I hated that he could no longer force my older brother to do, to make me do all the things he could never do as a kid, from playing cricket and football whilst attending primary school, if I said no I was hit and verbally degraded I would wake up at 4am just to do these early morning sport programs just to go to school at 8 , come home to do chores and eat before being sent to bed immediately after dinner, I was always exhausted, and whenever he was at work I played games on my brothers xbox. Since the split I’ve no longer played sports, I’ve grown to hate it, i still game but I still get palmed off as the person to do all the housework and chores because ‘I don’t work’ even though I would attend school for the same hours others would work. 

I’ve been told to kill myself by my younger sisters several times a week, those same sisters I use to love and protect from when they would attention seek on online forums and make up lies about being abused for sympathy only to be called out and bullied for lying, those same sisters I would have died for I now want nothing to do with them, I’ve lost my moral compass to the point that I don’t see the as my family anymore, my thoughts about them get worse but, my brother who pays a lot of the bills restricts my access to the internet when he deems I haven’t done enough work around the house, despite being the person who cleans up after everyone’s mess, him especially, my family lives like pigs, we barely have space on our kitchen counters most days, I’m always doing dishes , cleaning the countertop and taking out the rubbish, but I don’t receive the credit because if no one saw me do it, then it definitely wasn’t me who did it. 

About 2 years ago, I decided to quit pulling my weight I started making changes in my life for what I’d consider ‘the better’. I stopped doing majority of the housework, I still mow the lawns,  take out the rubbish, do some laundry here n there and clean up after myself, but I have stopped cleaning up after others (to my mothers dismay). 

I decided to try get my life in order, set up a bank account, apply to more jobs, get my learners permit and more, and I felt good doing that, I still never had any luck with jobs, I had several failed situationships and relationships that would barely last long enough to matter before they would cheat on me but, that aside I tried to take the steps needed to move forward but immediately was bombarded by my family on what I should do next, that me doing these simple things wasn’t enough. And it immediately sent my motivation down buried underground and since then it’s been barely wriggling out of the dirt, there’s no energy there.

I’ve been told that I need to get a job and contribute if we are to ever own a house because we’re not making enough to pay the rent and save, but I see all these lavish and large needless purchases that just make my head turn because why do I need to continue to us buying a house in a shit housing market when you spend so much money on smokes every two days? buy all these cosmetic pieces? this expensive coffee machine that you swear will do us better in the long run buying several bags of coffee grounds for your 6 coffees a day? 

it just doesn’t make sense to me, because I’ve tried to get a job and haven’t had any luck, and I keep getting told I’m not doing enough because they don’t see me do the work unless it’s an off chance it’s their day off (mom and brother) and I’m mowing the lawns because if I don’t no one else will, I even said it to my mother that if I stopped doing what I’m currently doing they’d struggle to live normally (I tested that theory for 2 weeks by not cleaning the rubbish or doing any laundry which saw a significant increased in mess and panic) and she was not happy. 

but I just feel like I’m not cut out to go on anymore, I’ve started into eating one meal a day if not every two days for the past year, I’ve been closed off in my room, and I’m constantly told to do all these things while my sisters sit at home all day, one of them sleeps all day and plays games all night but I get in trouble for not doing housework when they do nothing? My youngest sister has been taken to the pet store several times and she has been given 3 expensive birds that she has not bothered to train and screams at them when they squawk loudly, she barely takes care of them but takes better care of a stray cat, all to my mothers allergy expense, but me wanting to buy a cheap pet is off the table despite spending so much money on toys for the birds, there’s shit all over the floor that barely gets cleaned up the birds are nasty fuckers that give me a headache, I can’t even buy my own pet and I just.. I’m exhausted, I don’t know what to do anymore, I have nothing to go on for, my mental and physical strength is giving out, at the very least I’m staying alive till 2027 for a movie release but other than that I have nothing else to live for, no desire to keep going, no care. 

I was thinking about posting this in r/amioverreacting but maybe this is better, I’m open to any and all feedback, brutally honest and hurtful is fine too please give me your thoughts, whatever you want. Thanks for reading.",1,1764938523.0,SuicideWatch,0,1.0,False

They told me they had reported him to their DM who wouldn't allow them to ban this man. I filed a police report- the girls told me he had been incredibly intrusive and perverted with them too! But they weren't allowed to ban him! I am so upset because I feel like their asking previously to stop serving him should have been a warning to the company that this man is dangerous!    But apparently not? I filed a report, the police came, the organization said yea, they had video of the incident, but wouldn't give it to the police!! Their policy is needing a subpoena.    Seriously? This place is crawling with teens patron and Barista alike!   Why are they not being better protected from incidents like this?   I understand that they can't help what happens in the parking lot, but according to the baristas and shift supervisor, they knew this guy was a threat to their help and did nothing? What if this were a young girl and not a 30 something attacked? Why would they protect a pervert over the safety of their people or other patrons?

Let the Mariah Carey and ~~Plum Cake~~ Gajjar ka halwa take-over begin.

Looking for something more than just small talk and surface-level connections, I seek depth and I seek substance. Something long term that ages like fine wine, not something short term that fizzles out like soda pop.

Consciously seeking kindred spirits. Perhaps even my forever and always. But hey, even that kind of solid connection is best founded on the grounds of *pakka* friendship, don't you think? Forever is a long time, might as-well spend it with your best friend for life.

I just want someone to call my own. To talk about anything and everything with, to chat the day away, watch movies / binge on shows with each other, explore the city and cute cafés together, A genuine connection of mind, body and soul. My person, us against the world.

I’m 29, fit body with a sharp mind and a creative soul. A lover of all things nature, food, and animals. I’ve got messy hair, a dimple on my left cheek, and eyes that see deeper than most.

Witty banter, endless memes, and conversations that go far beyond the surface. I don’t want just passion, I want emotion. I want romance. I want chemistry that sets us both on fire.

I want to be your favorite notification and your go to distraction. I want to make your heart skip a beat when you see my name pop up on your screen, make you smile from cheek to cheek and bite your lips at the same time.

For unless it's mad, passionate, extraordinary love, it's a waste of time. There are many mediocre things in life, love should not be one of them.

So how do we do this? Coffee in a cute café filled with gingerbread smells? A day spent talking till the lights come on? A Christmas movie marathon with fuzzy socks? Let’s connect. Let me get to know you.

And hey… if we find ourselves standing under the same mistletoe, I won’t blame the universe for giving us a little nudge.

1pettrh,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_Designer_Tie7613/comments/1pettrh/instant_mushroom_coffee_mix_3_most_common_making/,Instant Mushroom Coffee Mix: 3 Most Common Making Mistakes that Affect Taste,"Instant coffee powder may not be the first choice for those used to ground coffee, as they often feel that the flavour doesn’t match the richness of freshly ground beans brewed at home. Freshly made coffee brings that perfect aroma, flavour, and satisfying feel that instant versions sometimes fail to deliver.

For health-conscious people, mushroom coffee has become a popular choice. However, when it comes to taste, many step back. And when this mushroom coffee is available as an instant powder mix, the experience can sometimes feel disappointing — not because it actually tastes bad, but because of a few simple mistakes people make without proper knowledge, which directly affect its taste.

1petsis,https://www.reddit.com/r/devops/comments/1petsis/we_turned_the_buildkite_homepage_into_a_cli/,We turned the Buildkite homepage into a CLI,"Hey folks,

Cloudflare is back up so maybe this is bad timing but here we go. 

I'm one of three on the Design team for Buildkite; a CI tool that regularly flies under the radar a bit. Historically, Buildkite has been one of those *“if you know, you know”* tools: quietly running a lot of serious pipelines. People are usually pretty surprised to learn the depth of customers BK has (and how long they've been with us). 

At some point though, being the *""best‑kept secret in CI”* stops being charming and hard questions are asked about, hm how do we begin to change this without throwing a bunch of money at things and losing the DNA of the tool itself. 

So! We (our micro team of me, and two design engineers) pitched something slightly unhinged but sincere: 

We made the default homepage a CLI. 

You hit [`buildkite.com`](http://buildkite.com), you get an input bar, not a product UI shot with CTAs. And, well, you know what to do from there.

# But... why bother?

Three problems we wanted to poke at:

* **Marketing sites for devtools talk to 'buyers', not users.** Lots of conventions, CTAs, optimized landing pages... the homogenization is getting worse, and the language is all commoditized at this point. Everyone is claiming faster, reliable, works well at scale. 
* **CI is a load‑bearing system, not a feature checkbox.** If we say we care about reliability, developer trust, and considered detail, the front door shouldn’t feel like an ad... for us, we are keen on this as a first step to taking a different approach in how we present the org and tool to the world. The gnarly part of this is, it would be easy to say 'well a CLI homepage is a version of an ad'. 
* **We’ve been the “word-of-mouth recommend” for a long time.** That’s flattering, but it doesn’t help a staff engineer who’s trying to convince their org to stop duct‑taping their current setup. There's some stuff we need to work on addressing or helping (learning curve, pricing). But being way more concise and cohesive with how we talk about our product is a reset we've actively begun here. 

The CLI homepage is us trying to make those values visible in the first ten seconds:

* Treat the homepage as an interface, not a brochure
* Show our personality in how carefully this behaves, not in how loudly it shouts

It’s optional, by the way. There’s a very obvious escape hatch to a perfectly normal website for people who simply want the regular structure, the pricing page... and not an existential prompt.

Nothing here is going to `terraform destroy` your weekend. The worst outcome from this is some tasteful ASCII cats, a mortal kombat theme and or waffle party mode. 

The intent is to reward curiosity a little, nod to the actual tools we live in, and then get the hell out of the way.

# What we’re trying to learn (and what I’d like from you)

The existential questions slowly driving us insane:

* Working across DevOps... is this actually a better front door than Yet Another Landing Page™, or is it just more noise? We figure that there'll likely be reactions of, oh cute gimmick, nice novelty act. And if so, fair. But also, hopefully it makes folk stop and read.
* Does mapping product info to commands make it easier to get to what you care about, or did you immediately hit “classic site” and will now try to pretend this never happened? Or maybe you just closed the tab and thought, oh fuck off? 
* If you landed on this while evaluating CI options for your org, what *should* be exposed that currently isn't?

If you’re willing to give it 30 seconds of your life:

1. Hit [**https://buildkite.com**](https://buildkite.com?utm_source=chatgpt.com).
2. Type what your fingers naturally type (`help`, `whoami`, `ping`, `coffee`, whatever). There's an available menu, and a bunch of 'secret' tidbits to go find... 
3. Tell us:
   * What worked?
   * What felt pointless or a bit shit?
   * What’s the one (or, many) thing you’d change to make it less “design engineers were clearly bored” and more “okay, I’ll allow this”?

Brutal honesty welcome. Abuse, too, if it's that divisive. 

We say “your tools should earn your trust, not ask for it” on the page; this is us attempting to do that in public, and fully prepared for the part where you tell us whether we actually did.",0,1764937628.0,devops,1,0.5,False

I've been trying to reverse engineer the flavor profile based on beans, but I hit a massive wall. I saw a demonstration of an Al that can identify faces. I used face seek on a tiny, blurry photo of the barista who invented the original blend (I found the photo on an old news article about Nespresso blend development).

I was hoping to find the guy's current job or private coffee blog so I could beg him for the blend details. The search failed to find his current location, but it did link his face to three anonymous profiles that only post about obscure, non-coffee-related food science. The flavor secret is safe, but the lack of digital footprint for a guy that talented is weird. Has anyone else ever gone this far to find a coffee blend?",29,1764937460.0,nespresso,15,0.59,False

It took me years to get over the abuse I received, to heal, and to forgive her. In the past I've had long periods of no contact as a result of the BS she pulled. I thought she had changed. It was all a manipulation to pull me back in. Recently she has put on the full court press in an attempt to get financial help and advice, and to position me as her caregiver. Her health is deteriorating and she has blown most of her money with extravagant spending and trying to compete with the women in her friend group. I mistakenly offered to look at her financial situation, and she's well and truly fkd. She inherited a large sum of money from her Dad and Aunt, and there won't be anything left to even take care of her affairs.  She is going to be destitute in 3.5 years unless she drastically cuts spending. I have already told her before, I will not give her money. (When I was a kid she used to steal money my father gave to me by going through my things while I slept)

She had serious back surgery recently, and I offered to help. I took more than a week off of work, took her to her appointments, paid for parking, brought her food, coffee, paid for Ubers, and became her house keeper. Then the mask came off. The guilt trips started again, and I was in her apartment cleaning up dog shit, while she ridiculed, guilt tripped, complained, and treated me like a slave. I was sent back in time and I remembered, this is the same woman that put our dog to sleep the time I went no contact at 16.",1,1764937452.0,raisedbynarcissists,2,1.0,False

Thoughts?,"I just pushed a new idea-scoring feature into my project [SaaSThink](https://www.saasthink.app), and now I’m not sure if the scoring logic actually makes sense or if I just hallucinated confidence at 1am.

The concept is simple: type in a niche/problem and it scores how promising it is based on demand, trends, competition, etc. It sounded great in theory. But now that it’s live, I’m second-guessing everything.

For example: someone tried **“coffee subscription for remote teams”** and it scored surprisingly high… even though my quick research says barely anyone is looking for that.

  
Meanwhile, another niche with real search volume got a pretty average score. So now I’m wondering if it’s the inputs, the weighting, or just me pretending I understand markets better than I actually do.

It’s live and **free to try**... no DM needed.  
If anyone wants to poke at it, test a few niches, or just tell me whether the scoring feels useful, I’d seriously appreciate it.

If you’re up for deeper testing or more detailed feedback, DM me and I’ll send the tester coupon code in order to try the full analysis mode.

However, the choice is harder than we originally thought.

We really like the Siemens for its quietness and the fact that it uses a little hose for the milk. However in the category that actually matters, it lacks enormously. The coffee, and especially the cappuccino, is really weak. Even with the strongest setting (apart from the doubleshot setting), it is weaker than even the middle strength setting of the De'Longhi.

Now, I have found a deal for an EQ700 for around the same price as our EQ6. However, I haven't found any review or comparison yet on the actual difference in coffee strength/quality. I have found that it uses a different brewing unit, but that's about it.

Does anyone here have any insight?
