1q1dssh,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1q1dssh,Road Trip to Bergen: My Experience,"Hi,

I posted a question for advice on driving from Göteborg to Bergen during Christmas. We received so many helpful answer and we finally did the trip. It was a success!

Link to the question: https://www.reddit.com/r/NorwayTravelAdvice/s/KB98LRUUP4

Now it is time for me to give back, so ask me anything. We decided to drive via the mountain route (E16 from Oslo) to Bergen and the coastal route (E39 and E18) on the way home. On the way home, we spent a day in Stavanger to explore the city and meet with old friends. We are a family of 3 (with a 7yo kid) and a cat, so we were more on the “relax” side, not too ambitious. Also, we drove an EV, so we had to take some charging stops.

On the way there:

Day 1: Göteborg to Sør-Aurdal (619 km, around 6 hours and 14 mins)

Day 2: Sør-Aurdal to Bergen (384 km, around 6 hours).

On the way home:

Day 1: Bergen-Stavanger (200km plus 2 ferries, almost 4 hours)

Day 2: Stavanger-Horten (470km, 6 hours and 20 minutes)

Day 3: Horten-Göteborg (252km plus a ferry, 4 hours and 33 mins)

All in all, it was very enjoyable. Some notes and highlights:

1. The mountain route was amazing. The view was stunning. Highly recommended with proper planning. Be prepared for the worst, we brought lunch, coffee, blanket etc, just in case. We encountered a sudden wind blowing the snow for around 20km and it was quite slippery with limited visibility. Luckily, I had experience in driving in such conditions before. Otherwise, it was nice.

2. We passed by Lærdalstunnelen, the longest road tunnel in the world (around 25km). It was an experience for sure. If you drive an EV, there are charging spots right before (and after) the tunnel.

3. Parking in Bergen was quite a hassle, but we decided to park in the Bryggen P-Hus a few times, around 300NOK per day.

4. The first 2 hours of drive from Stavanger were nice, but then it got really boring 🤣 a lot of construction plus it was just stony mountains.

And to answer my own question from the previous thread: yes, studded winter tires (dubbdäck or piggdekk) were sufficient in the mountain route, given that the weather was good.

Advice:

1. Download the Vegvesen Trafikk app, it was very useful to know the route conditions esp in Winter.

2. If you use EV, use “A Better Route Planner” app. Definitely 5euros well-spent.

3. Make sure you register for Autopass, as it made our life easier when taking the ferries (except the one from Horten-Moss that did not recognize our license plate, so we had to pay on the spot for a full price)

You won't feel like going to the gym most days. I didn't. But I still went—for four years straight—because I stopped relying on willpower and started engineering my environment instead.

At 19, I read *Atomic Habits*. One lesson stuck: make the right choice the easiest choice.

So I did. And it changed everything.

**I laid my gym clothes in front of my bed the night before.** Not in a drawer. Not on a chair. Right where I'd trip over them.

The moment I woke up, there was no decision to make. I see the clothes, I remember that I need to go to gym. Why? Imagine looking fat and ugly till the end of your life….

**I bribed myself with post-workout treats.** A coffee. A pastry. Something small from the supermarket. Sounds trivial, but it works.

Your brain loves immediate rewards, not abstract ""future fitness goals.""

**I packed my gym bag before bed.** Everything ready. Headphones charged. Water bottle filled. Zero friction in the morning

**Some mornings, I even planned a breakfast I was excited about**. Whatever made waking up feel less like punishment.

The pattern?

**Remove every tiny decision between you and the gym.**

Because here's what I learned over four years: discipline isn't about forcing yourself to do hard things.

It's about making hard things feel inevitable.

You don't need more motivation.

You need less friction between you and your better self",6,1767298230.0,beginnerfitness,2,0.88,False
1q1dpzq,https://www.reddit.com/r/ProductNew/comments/1q1dpzq/which_smart_plugs_should_i_choose_for_my_home/,Which smart plugs should I choose for my home?,"You're probably wondering which smart plugs will work best in your home. With so many options available, it can feel overwhelming to pick the right ones.

Smart plugs are small devices that plug into your regular wall outlets. They let you control any device remotely through your phone or voice commands. You can turn lights on and off, start your coffee maker before you wake up, or make sure you didn't leave the iron running.

When choosing smart plugs, look for these key features:

**Wi-Fi connectivity** is essential. Most good smart plugs connect to your home network without needing a separate hub. This makes setup much easier.

**App compatibility** matters too. The best smart plugs work with popular apps that are simple to use. You want something that won't frustrate you every time you need to control a device.

**Voice control support** is becoming standard. Look for plugs that work with Alexa, Google Assistant, or Siri. This lets you control devices hands-free while cooking or doing other tasks.

**Timer and scheduling features** are incredibly useful. You can set your devices to turn on or off at specific times automatically. This works great for lamps, fans, or even kitchen appliances.

**Energy monitoring** is a bonus feature in some smart plugs. These show you how much electricity your devices use, helping you save money on energy bills.

For most homes, you'll want plugs that are compact enough not to block other outlets. Some smart plugs are bulky and take up too much space.

The number of plugs you need depends on what you want to control. Start with 2-4 plugs for essential devices like lamps, fans, or small appliances. You can always add more later.

If you're ready to start making your home smarter, check out some highly-rated options at [this collection of smart plugs](https://athomewave.com/smart-plugs). They offer reliable connectivity and user-friendly features that work well for beginners.

Safety features like surge protection and automatic shutoff are worth considering too. These protect your devices and give you peace of mind.

Remember that smart plugs work with almost any device that plugs into the wall. Table lamps, space heaters, phone chargers, and small kitchen appliances are all perfect candidates.

Setting up smart plugs is usually straightforward. Most involve downloading an app, connecting to your Wi-Fi, and following simple instructions.

Once you experience the convenience of controlling your devices remotely, you'll wonder how you lived without smart plugs.

1q1dpm4,https://i.redd.it/liij9wsvosag1.jpeg,HVC Hot Cake,"Yeah… the name is goofy, but the cigar isn’t.

Wrapper is dark and oily like it’s been bench-pressing in a basement gym since 2009. San Andrés maduro over Nicaraguan guts. It looks like it’s going to be heavy, but it’s actually pretty damn balanced.

Cold draw / pre-light: straight cocoa + sweet tobacco, little bakery vibe. No weird sourness, no “barnyard” nonsense.

First third: comes out swinging with chocolate, creamy cocoa, and a clean pepper snap on the retro. Not harsh, just enough to keep it from tasting like a candy bar.

Middle: this is the best part. Chocolate turns into mocha/coffee, earth shows up, and it gets more “maduro” without getting muddy. Sweetness hangs around but doesn’t take over.

Last third: more dark cocoa + earth, pepper ramps a bit, finish dries out slightly — but it never goes bitter or hot. No end-of-cigar tantrum.

Construction: zero drama. Burn was steady, draw was easy, ash held fine. Exactly what you want when you’re not trying to babysit a stick.

Strength: medium to medium+, flavor-forward. It’s not going to put you on the floor, but it’s not a morning Connecticut either.

Verdict: If you like chocolatey San Andrés maduros that stay smooth and don’t turn into charcoal at the end, Hot Cake is a no-brainer. I’d buy these on purpose, not just smoke them because they showed up in a box.

What vitola are you guys smoking it in? This one in a short format is basically the perfect “I don’t have all night but I still want a real cigar.”

I spent way too much time investing myself in romance in 2025, and it took a toll on my mental health. I also always find more value in my friendships, especially with women. 

Well, yesterday I was FaceTiming with a friend (same age, single, no family/husband/kids, like me)  who lives across the country, whom I haven’t seen since April. We spent about an hour and half on FaceTime. Since I know that people like to talk about themselves and they enjoy listeners (hello: *How to Win Friends and Influence People*), I spent the first hour asking her questions about her life. She recently moved and is going through a career transition, so I figured she wanted to share. Every time there was a gap of silence, I figured that she would say “how about you how is ___ going for you?” Nope. She didn’t ask anything. 

It wasn’t until literally the last 10 minutes of the 1.5 hour conversation that she finally acknowledged, “Wow, I just spent almost two hours talking about myself! Tell me about your recent trip to Spain.” Once I did start talking, I could see her look at her phone and reading stuff on it, and she looked visibly annoyed to hear anything about me. I am 99% sure she didn’t listen to a word and didn’t ask any follow up questions the way I did the entire time when she spoke, since I was actually paying attention. She quickly ended the conversation after that. 

Honestly, I wanted to be more social in 2026, but people are incredibly selfish. I’ve experienced this with multiple friends — they only want to talk about themselves and have no interest in the other person. They just want a listener. And I will say, I am absolutely an interesting person, who travels internationally and has plenty to share. I also have a lot of hobbies and interests, so it’s not like I’m vapid and have nothing to talk about. They just only care about themselves. 

Then there are the “friends” who spend all day sending me dozens Instagram reels but claim they don’t have 30 minutes to get coffee even though we live 10 minutes away. 

Am I picking the wrong kind of friends? Am I spending too much time being curious about others? Or am too good of a listener, that they don’t care to reciprocate? I feel drained from putting in effort into people who only care about themselves. 

Even if dating is toxic, at least men asked me questions and seemed to pay attention to what I shared. Fuck my life.

***Part 1: The Timeline & The Struggle***

I started prep in Feb 2025 but really picked up the pace in April, entering my dedicated phase in September.

My preparation wasn't perfect. I had a lot of ups and downs. Some days I was focused and could do 2 blocks with ease (I rarely did more than 2 blocks/day). Other days, I struggled just to finish a single block.

I started **Uworld Systemwise**\- left 1-2 blocks depending on number of Qs per system and after going through all systemwise (which makes around 70-80%) the rest of 80% i did Randomwise so i practiced both modes in a single pass.

**The ""Foggy"" Phase:**

After finishing 100% of UWorld (around NBME 11), I felt confused what to do next. My scores were in the 240s, and I didn't know how to improve and there were many things to do (Innercircle/CMS/Amboss/Uw 2nd pass/ DIP etc.)

**The Breakthroughs:**

 

**CMS Forms**: I decided to do the last 2 CMS forms for all subjects. This was huge. It helped me finally understand the ""NBME Mindset"" and how they write questions.

 

**UWorld Incorrects (Subject-wise)**: After NBME 15, I decided to re-do my UWorld incorrects, but strictly subject-wise as it can go with CMS forms. This helped me connect the dots better than random mode and ***my scores finally jumped to the 260s.***

 

**Stamina Training:** I once simulated the real deal by taking NBME 14 + Old Free 120 in the same sitting. It gave me the confidence that I could survive 9 hours.

***Part 2: Resources & Recommendations***

1. UWorld - BACKBONE

 Usage: 100% First Pass + One pass of Incorrects.

Biostats Tip: I personally found UWorld Biostats/Epi very confusing and tricky in a way that didn't match the real exam. I suggest using Amboss for these specific topics instead—it’s much closer to the NBME style.

2. CMS Forms

 I did the final 2 forms for every subject.

 Exceptions: I did ALL forms for Emergency Medicine (3 forms) and Family Medicine (4 forms) as these are very high-yield.

3. Amboss (The ""NBME Concepts"" Strategy)

 I tried a specific strategy where I tagged/filtered for ""Most Important NBME Concepts"" in Amboss(found a list of Repeated tested NBME Concepts from reddit).

 Observation: The language in these questions was strikingly similar to the NBMEs and the Real Deal.

Recommendation: If you are looking for a ""Second Pass"" resource to improve your score, I strongly suggest doing your UWorld Incorrects + these tagged Amboss questions (approx. 1600-1900Qs). This is likely more high-yield than doing a full second pass of UWorld. I only managed to do about 200-300 of these due to time constraints, but they were excellent.

 

***High-Yield Study Sections of Amboss:*** I used these for Ethics, Screening, Vaccines, Patient Safety/QI which were more tested on  real deal - I observed this kind of Qs minimum 10 per block including this kind of questions. (Can’t stress enough these were very very helpful)

4. Divine Intervention Podcasts (DIP)

 I did the standard ""Must Dos.""

 **Rapid Review Series:** I started from Episode #100 and listened to about 25 episodes. He integrates everything beautifully. I wish I had time to do more.

5. **Inner Circle Notes**

 Great resource, but I realized I am not a notes person. Reading passive notes bored me. I dropped them and went back to doing Questions. If you are like me, don't force yourself to read notes—active recall through questions is often better.

***Part 3: Exam Day Strategy (Energy Management)***

I knew that my knowledge was decent (consistent 262s), but I wanted to ensure I didn't crash during the exam. I focused heavily on nutrition and timing.

 I ate Protein Bars for nutrition .

***The ""Stack"": Caffeine Strategy:***

  “NOT MEDICAL ADVICE!!” (DO NOT TRY IF YOU ARE CAFFEINE SENSITIVE)

Morning: Prophylactic Pantoprazole+Domperidone (for acidity and nausea prevention throughout day)

 

30 Minutes before exam: 

•Ibuprofen + Paracetamol (to prevent tension headaches) Repeat Paracetamol(350mg around 5th block).

•100mg Caffeine + 200mg L-Theanine Capsule which maintains constant caffeine without spikes and drops and  Theanine prevents anxiety and jitters from caffeine (i tried multiple times during my previous study sessions and my NBMEs - I suggest not testing it first time on exam day) — Repeated at 6th Block.

Instead of drinking a full cup of coffee during breaks (which makes you crash and need the restroom), I used a concentrated flask (400ml) of Davidoff Espresso 57 and just took 3-4 small sips between every block starting from Block 3. This kept my energy consistent.

***Part 4: The Exam Experience***

**Time Management:** I never really had time issues during practice tests (even on UWSA2), and on the real deal, I finished every block with time to spare and reviewed my typically 5-6 flagged qs.

 

**Length vs. Vagueness**: Everyone says UWSA2 is lengthy, and I felt the Real Deal was just as lengthy as UWSA2. However, the language and vagueness were much more similar to NBMEs/CMS forms.

**How I Felt**: The pacing strategy worked perfectly. ***By the end of the exam, instead of feeling exhausted, I honestly felt like I could still handle one more block. I wasn't burnt out; I was just satisfied.***

**Final Words:**

Trust your NBME scores. If you are consistent there, you will be consistent on the real deal. Focus on your exam day nutrition and energy management—it makes a massive difference in how you handle those final tough blocks.

League: Philadephia 76ers vs Dallas Mavericks (7:30PM CST on NBATV)

**Recap**: Pacers battled and they had the lead most of this game, but unfortunately they fell short. They could have tied or win the game, but I think they missed their last possesion? I didn't see what happen on their last possession. But those of you who faded these self-fade POTDs, you are very welcome! I knew this game would be much closer than the lines projected.

**Matchup:**  Kings ML is tempting and certainly looks like a guaranteed loss, but I want to go game I see it as a literal 50/50 game. So I'm taking the Mavs today against the Sixers. This should be another game that will be close down the stretch. I think Mavs are getting some respect and Cooper Flagg is on the uprise. Sixers are still the better team in my eyes and I think Cooper Flagg offense alone won't be enough to win a home game, but something tells me this game is going to come down to the last possesion. I think whoever has the ball last will win the game. Linesmakers has the Sixers as the slight favorite on the road and I agree wit them, but gimme the Mavs at home as I see this as a flip! Won't be surprise if Sixers blow them out tho.

**The Play & Prediction :** 1U on Mavs ML. No prediction on this one as well!

The end is drawing near, but who knos what the future holds. I will never rule out a possibility of handicapping POTDs in 2026 and beyond.

Hi all,

I really need some outside perspective because I’m deeply hurt and confused.

I’m supposed to get married in about 6 months. Yesterday, my fiancé and I had a very difficult conversation that has completely shaken my sense of security.

He admitted that he lusts after one of my close friends. While he insists there is no emotional connection and says it’s purely physical and lustful, what devastated me was that he also said he finds her baddie personality the way she carries herself who is supposed to be a big girl. FYI, he does have taste on big girls.

During our conversation, he struggled to even say “I love you” without long pauses as he was super drunk. I now feel small, unwanted, and unsafe in this relationship.

What hurts the most is that I had always asked him to be transparent with me, and we had been since dating for 5 years but i knew he told me once about the attraction towards my friend but i thought it wasn't to that extent. When he was drunk and when i asked him that if he will be able to spend the rest of his life with him, he said something like “go on, why not,” instead of being honest about what he was feeling. 

I’m struggling with trust. I keep asking myself:

	•	If he felt this way, why didn’t he tell me earlier?

	•	If he doesn’t truly want to marry me, why let things get this far?

He says he feels guilty that he lusts over her and was scared to tell me because of my reaction towards id and assured me that he will never act on this or suppress his feelings again. He has asked for time to think on the reasons on ""why he wants to marry me"" and I’m respecting that. But right now, I feel emotionally abandoned. Is it my overthinking or shall we go for couple therapy or something.

Also, what triggered this because we recently met her for a coffee.

PS: To be honest, my sexual libido has not been so great lately and we hardly get intimate anymore. I am very anxious about my future. 

What scares me is that I’ve been in a loveless relationship before, and I know how lonely it feels. I don’t want either of us to be trapped in something that lacks love, honesty, or emotional safety.

I’m heartbroken, questioning myself, and unsure what the right next step is, especially with families involved and a wedding so close.

Am I overreacting for feeling this deeply hurt and shaken?

Would you still feel safe marrying someone after this?

Any perspective would really help. Thank you for reading.",6,1767297718.0,AskMenAdvice,31,0.71,False

1q1dhyo,https://www.reddit.com/r/MindDecoding/comments/1q1dhyo/how_to_completely_transform_your_life_in_6_months/,How to COMPLETELY Transform Your Life in 6 Months Using DEEP WORK: The Psychology That Actually Works,"Okay so I've been obsessively studying this whole deep work thing for months now. read Cal Newport's book like three times, binged every podcast with productivity experts, even tried those ridiculous 4am morning routines that fitness bros swear by. 

here's what nobody tells you: most people are living on autopilot. we are constantly distracted, jumping between tasks, refreshing social media every 5 minutes. our brains have literally been rewired for shallow work. and the scary part? we don't even realize how much potential we're wasting. the average person gets maybe 2 hours of actual focused work done per day. the rest is just. noise.

but here's the thing. this isn't entirely your fault. we live in an attention economy where every app, notification, and platform is literally designed by PhDs in behavioral psychology to keep you hooked. your biology is working against you too. Our brains crave that dopamine hit from notifications. it's the same neural pathway as slot machines. but the good news is you can retrain your brain. neuroplasticity is real and it's insanely powerful.

Deep Work by Cal Newport is genuinely the best book on productivity I've ever read. Newport is a Georgetown computer science professor who's published like 6 books and dozens of peer reviewed papers, all without working past 5pm or using social media. the book basically argues that the ability to focus without distraction on cognitively demanding tasks is becoming increasingly rare and increasingly valuable. he breaks down exactly why shallow work is killing your potential and gives you the framework to build a deep work practice. this book will make you question everything you think you know about productivity. I'm not exaggerating when I say it completely changed how I approach my work.

the core concept is building what Newport calls deep work blocks. these are periods of 90 to 120 minutes where you work on ONE thing with zero distractions. no phone, no email, no Spotify with lyrics, nothing. just you and the task. sounds simple but it's genuinely hard at first. your brain will literally fight you. you'll feel this intense urge to check your phone or quickly google something. that's your brain seeking easy dopamine. push through it.

start small though. if you've been living in distraction mode for years, trying to do 4 hours of deep work immediately will fail. begin with 25 minute sessions using the Pomodoro technique. there's this app called Forest that's perfect for this. you plant a virtual tree and it grows while you stay focused. if you leave the app, the tree dies. sounds stupid but it actually works because you've got this visual representation of your focus. plus they plant real trees when you hit certain milestones which is pretty cool. 

Another app worth checking out is BeFreed, which is an AIpowered learning platform built by Columbia University alumni and former Google engineers. It pulls from highquality sources like research papers, expert interviews, and book summaries to create personalized audio podcasts tailored to your goals. You can customize the length from 10minute summaries to 40minute deep dives and adjust the depth based on your energy level. What makes it useful for deep work is the adaptive learning plan feature, it learns from your interactions and builds a structured roadmap for skill development. Plus you get a virtual coach called Freedia that you can chat with about specific challenges. The voice customization is actually pretty addictive, there are options like a deep voice similar to Samantha from Her or more energetic tones depending on your mood. Perfect for turning commute time or gym sessions into productive learning without the brain fog from doomscrolling.

gradually increase your sessions to 45 minutes, then 90, then 120. timing matters too. research shows most people's cognitive peak is 2 to 4 hours after waking up. that's when your prefrontal cortex is firing on all cylinders. so your hardest, most important work should happen then. not emails, not meetings, not admin stuff. your most cognitively demanding task. I block out 8am to 11am every single day for deep work and it's genuinely transformed my output.

you also need to eliminate decision fatigue. Barack Obama and Steve Jobs wore the same thing every day for this exact reason. every decision you make depletes your willpower. so automate everything you can. meal prep on sundays. lay out your clothes the night before. have a set morning routine you don't think about. the Atomic Habits approach by James Clear is killer for this. he talks about habit stacking, where you attach new habits to existing ones. like after I pour my morning coffee, I will sit down for deep work. your brain loves these automatic sequences.

another game changer is the shutdown ritual. this is straight from Newport's book. at the end of your work day, you review what you accomplished, make a plan for tomorrow, and then literally say shutdown complete out loud. sounds weird but it signals to your brain that work is done. no more checking emails at 9pm or thinking about projects while trying to sleep. your brain needs genuine rest to consolidate learning and maintain focus capacity.

the podcast Deep Questions with Cal Newport is also insanely good. he does deep dives into listener questions about focus, productivity, and living a deeper life. one episode that stuck with me was about attention residue. basically when you switch tasks, part of your attention stays on the previous thing. so constantly switching between emails, slack, documents means you're never fully present on anything. your cognitive capacity drops by like 40%. that's why batching similar tasks together is so effective.

environmental design is massively underrated too. your space shapes your behavior. if your phone is within arm's reach, you'll check it. guaranteed. so during deep work, put it in another room. use website blockers like Freedom to lock yourself out of social media. tell people you're unavailable during certain hours. create friction for bad habits and remove friction for good ones.



sleep is non negotiable btw. Matthew Walker's book Why We Sleep breaks down the science and it's honestly terrifying how much sleep deprivation destroys cognitive function. if you're getting less than 7 hours, your deep work capacity is shot. you literally cannot focus properly when sleep deprived. your brain needs that time to clear metabolic waste and consolidate memories. prioritize it like your life depends on it, because kinda does.

here's the brutal truth though. nobody is coming to save you. you can read every productivity book, listen to every podcast, buy every app. but none of it matters if you don't actually do the work. and the work is uncomfortable. sitting with difficulty without reaching for distraction feels physically painful at first. your brain will scream at you. but that discomfort is literally your brain rewiring itself. you're building new neural pathways. it gets easier but only if you're consistent.

one last thing. track your deep work hours. get a simple habit tracker or use the Streaks app. seeing your progress visually is incredibly motivating. aim for 20 hours of deep work per week to start. that might sound like a lot but it's less than 3 hours per day. and honestly, 20 hours of focused deep work will produce more results than 60 hours of distracted shallow work. quality over quantity always.

the transformation isn't overnight. but in 6 months of consistent deep work practice, you'll genuinely be unrecognizable. your output will skyrocket. your skills will compound. opportunities will start appearing because you're producing work that actually stands out. most people won't do this because it requires genuine effort and discomfort. which is exactly why it works so well for those who commit.",1,1767297696.0,MindDecoding,0,1.0,False

5 months ago i have made a post about using specialized voice changers for voice exploration and modelling ([link to the old post](https://www.reddit.com/r/transvoice/comments/1mnjg7d/new_voice_training_tool_in_prototype/)). I learned a lot from the comments, thankyou for the wonderful feedbacks.

For the past few months, I’ve been working hard to combine those distinct tools into a single, unified Web App called **Voicelight**.

**The Core Philosophy**  
My tool is built on the idea that imitating *your own voice* is the easiest and most effective way to train. Instead of trying to mimic a stranger or a generic clip, this app modifies your recording to show you what you would sound like with different **Resonance (brightness)** or **Vocal Weight (thickness)** settings.

**Who is this for?**

* **Self-learners:** Track your progress, explore your voice, and set mini-goals using visual feedback.
* **Coaches & Therapists:** Use it during sessions to demonstrate concepts visually and give students a concrete target to practice at home.

**Try it out**

* **App:** [https://voicelight.lovable.app](https://voicelight.lovable.app)
* **Manual:** [User Guide & Documentation](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ehuKsw1GuzVfS6Omx-W06XKcTIEkZ7snahFy0cn7xyQ/edit?tab=t.0)

**Pricing & Sustainability**  
To cover the high GPU server costs required for AI audio processing, I’ve created two simple tiers, **Both come with a 7-Day Free Trial**.

* **Learner Tier ($1.99/mo):** Less than the price of a coffee. I wanted this to be accessible to everyone.
* **Coach Tier ($34.99/mo):** For professionals. This allows you to design ""homework"" and track your students' progress. It also **allows you to gift free accounts to your students**, so they can practice between sessions without paying extra.

*(Note: The legacy links to the individual AI models will remain free as long as I can cover the costs:* [*Voice Alteration*](https://gradio3.thinkthinksyn.com/) *|* [*Voice Comparison*](https://gradio1.thinkthinksyn.com/)*)*

**Privacy & Tech Specs**

* **Privacy:** Your recordings are private to your account and are not used to train AI models.
* **Compatibility:** Works best on Chrome (Desktop/Mobile)
   * Bug Warning: I have primarily tested this on Google Chrome. It might be buggy on iOS/Safari. Please let me know in the comments if you run into issues!

As a solo developer, my goal is to make this tool sustainable. Your support ensures the app stays online and gets better every week.

I really believe that everyone's vocal journey is **unique**. We all have different **physiology** and **aesthetics**. Try not to compare yourself to others—**only compare yourself to who you were yesterday, or who you want to be tomorrow**.

So I am fairly new to the specialty coffee scene and have been brewing coffee on a kaldipress for over 2 months now. What I am mostly struggling with, is to have a consistent recipe, because for some reason I just cannot settle on the taste - sometimes the same recipe tastes different in a few days (degassing?, although I rest the coffee after considerable research), sometimes it just takes too much time to dial in the beans and then I run out of the 250g bag :(. The only exception (that too after 5-6 brews) was Naivo’s Berry Dawn Naturals (which is amazing by the way) that stayed more or less consistent and delicious.

I discovered that very different recipes were required for different roasters:

For Bloom’s Light roasts, I needed medium-coarse grind with boiling water and concentrated ratio

For Naivo Berry Dawn, slightly finer grind and 88 degrees water (omni roast, but still) and concentrated ratio 

For Corridor Seven Riverdale N72, which is a light roast, I found an upright brew with medium grind and 87-88 degrees celsius water and diluted ratio better! How 😭

Is there a better baseline that I can start with? Currently I start off a bag with Hoffman’s recipe for upright brews and my personal baseline for inverted brews - 15g coffee, 200-210g water (95-100 degrees Celsius for light roasts, 88-90 for medium), 16-19 clicks on timemore chestnut C2, 2.5 minute brew time with bloom.

I love coffee. I really do.  My approach to coffee is to always try new and different beans and expand my palate to get a better idea of what I like . Reason being I want to try everything and anything in the hopes I find something truly ""amazing"", of course that won't ever actually happen and I'll have to settle for ""good enough"" but I still want to try. With that said, that's why I went ahead and bit the bullet on getting the onyx calendar (I did get a slight discount + the early bird sale, it wasn't too bad but my wallet did cry a bit).  I don't think I've been as excited about something like this in a long time with regards to having something to wake up to everyday. My only prior experience with onyx before this was getting a box of their Ethiopia Hambela Alaka Natural, which I thought was very pleasant to drink. So throughout the month of December I'd take out my phone and make notes about that day's coffee (adjustments need, general thoughts, like/dislike/indifferent, etc). Its definitely a bit scattered but I did try to make a bit more organized for this post. I don't think they're particularly insightful but I do hope someone at least gets something from them.

Variety: Landrace  
Listed notes: Cranberry, Vanilla, Grapefruit, Sweet Tea

\-tea-like, slight citrus flavor, light body low acidity

\- some vanilla

\- not very enthusiastic about this particular profile but it's still good coffee

\- 25 g to 400g water, grind size was appropriate, suggested drawdown is 4 minutes

2nd brew

\- better technique, tastes like a vanilla tea, better body,  sweet

\- not getting much acidity from this particular cup

\- very pleasant and tea-like, but also a bit richer in mouthfeel compared to other tea-like coffees I've had

Region: Guji  
Variety: Landrace  
Listed notes: Jasmine, Apple Butter, Apricot, Toasted Coconut

\- 1st brew was in a v60, the other was in the switch, both were good, both showed different aspects of the coffee

\- didn't go fine on the grind, perhaps in the future I'll experiment with grind size on beans they want grinded coarsely

Edward Sandoval Chiroso  
Process: Washed  
Origin: Columbia  
Region: Tolima  
Variety: Chiroso  
Listed notes: Pear, Oolong Tea, Raw Sugar, Minerality

\- maybe I overagitated a bit, not to sure, but overall still a good cup of coffee

\- definitely getting the oolong tea vibe to it with its overall mouth feel

\- fruity, some acidity, a very pear-forward flavor

\- overall I would describe it as sweet

Day 12

Mazateca Mujeres  
Process: Washed  
Origin: Mexico  
Region: Sierra Mazateca, Oacaca  
Variety: Typica, Bourbon  
Listed notes: Orange, Fig, Milk Chocolate, Chocolate Bean

\- first brew in my switch, was ok, I grinded a bit coarser to compensate but I dont think it was the right call with this coffee

Process: Natural  
Origin: Ethiopia  
Region: Bensa

Listed notes: Strawberry, Crisp Apple, Sugar Cane, Lavendar

\- wasn't very impressed by this, maybe I should've used harder water (I had smart water at the time of brewing, ran out of my mineralized distilled water)

\- definitely tasted like sweet plantains, a bit syrupy in texture

\-blowed my nose, able to smell a lot more aromatics now

\- I really wish I had more to say about these beans, they're good, but this wasn't like ""OMGGGG I have to get more"" this was definitely a ""Huh, nice""

Process: Washed  
Origin: Panama  
Region: Palencia  
Variety: Gesha  
Listed notes: Jasmine, Mango Champagne, Honey, Elegant

\- light floral, first gesha I've had in a long time

\- brewed it with the high ratio as recommended in the video and on the brew guide

\- interesting cup, VERY delicate texture, but honestly maybe its just the beans I've rolled in my box but I didn't feel particularly excited while drinking this

\- I'd call it relaxing, this drink is mellow and relaxing, still sweet, still has that expected flavor of light fruit, great cup of coffee, but maybe the idea of this bean was so much better in my head than what I actually got, that's my fault not the coffee's

Closing thoughts:  
\- shoutouts to onyx for sending me a link to their google form on insta and email  
\- I think their graphic designers REALLY nailed the design of the box , its so beautiful, and I really like the cards too, may even integrate the snakes/coffee cherries into a blackwork sleeve, idk we'll see  
\- there wasn't a bad coffee, at the absolute worst some were like ""damn this is one of the specialty coffees of all time"" and I don't really have too much to say about them, it's gonna be the basic light-roasted fruit profile. Not bad, just not particularly special  
\- a lot of coffee, a lot of opportunities to see what works and what doesn't work with specific coffees and how to treat them in accordance to their grind size  
\- happy to have had more opportunities to just taste so many different things, specialty coffee is a product that I think is taken for granted, especially when an $18 bag takes up a smaller slice of your paycheck, I'm fortunate enough to be able to afford (or at least \*willing\*) and live in a place where I can just wake up and brew a great drink everyday  
\- Definitely has me thinking about the relationship between us and the products we consume  
\- excited to return to getting bags of beans every 2 - 4 weeks and dialing-in 32475632478 times to get a ""perfect"" cup

I did not reach my goal of getting this query-ready by the end of the year, but it was probably more sane to enjoy the holidays with my kids. Here's what I fixed this time:

\- I got rid of references to Rowan's mother in the third paragraph

\-I zoomed way in to the conflict from Adria's perspective. 

\-Tried not to hate myself for still working on this query. 

Here we go!



Dear Agent,

I am seeking representation for HOW YOU HEAR ME, my 93k word romance novel with a speculative twist. For fans of Ashley Poston’s *Sounds Like Love*, with the sweet college romance of Christina Lauren’s *Tangled Up in You*, HOW YOU HEAR ME is a slow-burn love story written in dual POV with a dose of millennial nostalgia. 



Adria Holzen can’t let go of her dream of being a teacher. Even though last semester’s panic attack and downward spiral during exams made her want to disappear, working with kids has always been the one thing she’s been good at. But earning acceptance into her university’s student teaching program means Adria has to collaborate with her fellow classmates—if she can convince anyone to work with her. 



Rowan Briggs has been able to hear people’s thoughts since he was young, a secret he’s mostly kept to himself. Growing up, he watched his mother use her own telepathy as a weapon. But now that he’s in college, Rowan’s decided keeping people at a distance is better than following in her footsteps. And if he can make it to graduation, maybe even become the person he always wished was there for him.



When Adria is partnered with Rowan for a semester-long project, she’s sure her fear of public speaking will fail them both. Unbeknownst to her, he can hear everything–her worries, her intentions, and the palpable attraction that he too is feeling as they spend hours researching. Rowan turns out to be the one person who sees beyond her anxiety and calms her in moments of panic. But when she witnesses him identify a stranger in trouble seemingly at random, Adria finally discovers his secret. Being with someone who can hear her innermost thoughts feels wrong when Adria’s been putting on a facade the whole time. In the end, she must decide if she’s willing to live her life completely transparent for Rowan, or risk losing the one person who wants to understand her. 



Like my protagonist, I attended university to become a teacher. I received a bachelor’s in English/Language Arts from \[university\]. Today I live in \[location\] with my husband and our four children. When I’m not writing, I enjoy reading, baking, and drinking far too much iced coffee. Thank you for your time and consideration.

Snow-covered streets.
Cozy cafés.
People holding hot drinks under soft lights.
But here’s the real experience  the part I wish someone had explained before I went:

• The cold is dry, not wet  your lips and hands will feel it fast
• Wind matters more than temperature (some days feel colder than the number says)
• Heated floors indoors feel amazing… until you step back outside
• Convenience stores become survival spots: hot coffee, ramen, fish cake broth
• You’ll walk faster, talk less, and notice the city more
What surprised me most wasn’t the cold  it was how winter slows everything down.
Fewer crowds. Quieter streets.

If you’re planning to visit Korea in winter, here’s what actually helps:
Bring lip balm and hand cream (you’ll use them daily)
Layers matter more than thick coats
Take breaks indoors cafés aren’t just for photos
Embrace short walks instead of rushing all day
If you’ve been to Korea in winter: What caught you off guard? What made it better than you expected? What would you tell someone coming for the first time?

We are saving for a house so priority is to work as much as possible and get as much money as possible. Because of this we havent really had a date night or spent much time together apart from having dinner together most nights.

Over Christmas we both planned to book 9 days off work. I work an office job so it's easier for me to organise time off, whereas he is self employed so i understand its sometimes harder for him to take days off work. 

We had planned on having a festive night out - visit a Christmas Market or go shopping some evening before xmas. Before Christmas he told me this is no longer possible because he had to work later nights for more days than originally planned so we could no longer have our date night. I understood and said nothing. Until he arrived home from work early one night and told me he had taken the evening off because a few of his buddies wanted to go to a bar, and he wanted to go with them. I was pissed because he couldn't take a night off for me but no question when his buddies asked.

The whole of xmas period i asked him to spend time with me or help around the house, and he told me he was exhausted because he had worked so hard. But yet one day he spent 14 hours solid on the PlayStation with his friends and didnt come to bed until 4am. Meaning he slept most of the next day and wasnt available then either.

I asked him a few days ago could we go out for dinner (bear in mind we always split the bill at dinner so I wasnt asking for him to pay for mine). He said no, he was working hard and saving and how could I expect him to buy a house when im asking him to go for dinners etc with me. Then the same day I found out he had bought a $115 part for his car (not a necessary part, a piece for the bodykit of the car so completely aesthetic). 

Then on monday I asked him did he want to get out of the house and go shopping or for coffee, he said he just wanted to relax and didnt want to leave the house all day. So I went out by myself and by the time I got home he was gone. I rang him to ask where he was and he said his buddy had asked him to go with him to collect a piece of furniture so he had went out with his friend for a few hours for a drive. Again I was left in the house alone.

The last straw was when I asked him on Tuesday could we go for a walk or get lunch together because I hadnt seem him or spent quality time in so long. He said sure, just let me finish washing the car. I thought great, finally some one on one time, then I looked outside and his friend had pulled into the drive and they were washing his car too. I asked him why his friend was there yet again and he told me to relax, his friend just called round to fix something on his PlayStation and would be gone in 10 minutes. I waited for 45mins and then stormed out of our house before shouting 'does your friend know we had plans or does he want you every single day?'

My partner is angry at me, saying how dare I humiliate him in front of his friend or make his friend feel awkward/unwelcome. He said im trying to stop him from having friends and that if I would have just 'not been a psycho' he would have eventually went to lunch with me. He said 'why would I want to spend time with someone whos always pissed off at me' and blamed me for the reason i havent seen him or spent quality time in so long. 

I think he should be prioritising me over his friends, because in the 9 days we were supposed to have off together he had a night out with them, a shopping day, coffee dates, drives, PlayStation nights etc and I had absolutely no quality time except for maybe watching a show together while he text his friends or eating dinner beside eachother.

I know you've been holding your breath underwater since 2011, waiting for **someone** to tell you when it's safe to come up for air. I spent the last three nights mapping every single transit in January because I'm tired of vague *""trust the universe""* bulls\*\*t when we need **actual dates** we can circle and prepare for.​

This isn't just another monthly horoscope. This is your **survival guide** for the 31 days that changes everything. This is a follow-up to [**my previous post.**](https://www.reddit.com/r/piscesastrology/comments/1q19u25/your_2026_pisces_roadmap_key_dates_transits_what/)

No cap. January doesn't play nice at first, but by the end? You won't recognize yourself. And that's the whole f\*\*king point!

# Week 1: The Fog Before The Breakthrough (Jan 1-5)

**January 1st** hits different fr. Mercury squares Neptune and suddenly nothing anyone says makes sense. Texts get misread. Intentions blur. You'll feel like everyone's speaking underwater. **Don't make major decisions today.** Your intuition is scrambled. Just observe.​

**January 2nd** doubles down with Moon square Neptune. Your emotions are **raw** and you can't explain why. Someone asks *""what's wrong?""* and you genuinely don't know. That's okay. Not everything needs immediate answers. Let yourself feel messy. It's giving emotional damage, but make it mystical. ✨​

**Pro tip for Jan 1-5:** Journal everything. The confusion you feel now contains messages. You just can't decode them yet. Saturn is basically assigning us homework on New Year's, and we're NOT happy about it.

# Week 2: Career & Connection Energy Floods In (Jan 6-12)

**January 6th: Venus cazimi in Capricorn**. Your 11th house (friendships, hopes, networks) **lights up**. Someone reaches out. An old connection resurfaces. An opportunity appears through word-of-mouth. **Reply to that message you've been ignoring.** Not me finally texting back after 3 weeks 💀​

**January 9th: Mars cazimi** happens and suddenly you have **energy** again. Not anxious energy. Actual drive. lowkey this is when we remember we're not just sad fish, we're **ambitious** sad fish. Use this window (Jan 9-16) to **apply for things**. Send the email. Make the ask. Mars in your social/career networking house means people notice you differently right now. main character energy? Unlocked.​

**Mark this week for:** Job applications, networking coffee chats, updating your LinkedIn, reaching out to mentors. The universe is handing you momentum. Don't waste it scrolling TikTok at 3am (I see you).

# Week 3: Everything Shifts Into Your Favor (Jan 13-19)

This is where it gets **good**. like actually good. Not *""delulu is the solulu""* good. **REAL GOOD.**

**January 13th: Venus enters your 11th house**. Friendships feel warmer. Collaborations click. If you've been waiting to pitch an idea or partnership, **this is your week**. The universe understood the assignment.​

**January 15th-18th:** Sun, Mars, Mercury all move into Capricorn stacking energy in your 11th house. Translation? **Your network becomes your net worth.** Every conversation matters. Every connection counts. You're magnetic right now and you don't even realize it. Highkey you could probably manifest a job offer just by existing near the right people.​

**January 17th: Venus sextile Neptune**. The most healing day of the month. Compassion flows. Love feels soft. If you need to have a vulnerable conversation, **do it today**. People will actually hear you. The emotional support will be supporting fr.​

**Action item:** Schedule important conversations for Jan 17th. Apologize if you need to. Confess feelings if you've been holding back. Shoot your shot. The cosmic weather is gentle. Use it. Worst case scenario you get closure, best case you get a rom-com moment.

# Week 4: THE DATE THAT CHANGES EVERYTHING (Jan 20-26)

**January 21st: Mercury cazimi in Aquarius**. Your mind **clears**. Suddenly the fog from Week 1 makes sense. Write down what you realize. It's important. The mental clarity is gonna hit like that first sip of coffee after pulling an all-nighter.​

**January 23rd: Pluto cazimi**. Deep transformation moment. Something you've been avoiding comes to surface. **Face it.** Pluto rewards courage, not comfort. (Yes bestie, you DO have to have that uncomfortable conversation. Sorry!)​

**JANUARY 26th: NEPTUNE ENTERS ARIES**.​

**THIS. IS. IT.**

The planet that's been gaslighting us for **15 years** finally leaves Pisces. Neptune moves into Aries and won't come back until 2039. **We're literally FREE!**

You will feel **different** on January 26th. Lighter. Clearer. Like someone opened windows in a room you forgot had fresh air. Your boundaries feel real again. Your dreams feel possible again. **You feel like YOU again.**

The way this date is gonna live rent-free in our heads forever. This isn't subtle. You'll know. If January 26th was a vibe check, it would absolutely slay. Do something to **acknowledge** this isn't just another day. This is your **LIBERATION DAY.** Neptune ate our peace for 15 years, and on Jan 26th **WE'RE EATING BACK!**

# Week 5: Integration & New Beginnings (Jan 27-31)

**January 27th: Moon sextile Neptune**. First emotional check-in after Neptune leaves. You'll feel supported. Trust it. It's giving a soft landing.​

**January 29th: Moon square Neptune**. Brief moment of doubt creeps in. ""Did anything actually change?"" **Yes. It did.** Don't let one wobbly day convince you otherwise. The imposter syndrome will try to make a comeback, but we're NOT letting it back in the group chat.​

**January 31st: Moon trine Neptune**. The month closes **gently**. You're not drowning anymore. You're treading water, then swimming, then realizing you can stand. The bottom was there the whole time. You just couldn't see it through the fog. We're ending January like the final girl who survived the horror movie and now gets to heal.​

# Your January Mission (Choose ONE)

By January 31st, commit to **one** of these:

* Set a boundary you've been too scared to set (that's growth bestie!)
* Apply for the opportunity you think you're not ready for (you ARE ready, your anxiety is just loud)
* Have the conversation you've been avoiding (rip off the bandaid)
* Start the project Neptune convinced you was impossible (plot twist: it wasn't)

**Just one.** That's all Neptune's exit asks. One brave move. One slay moment to prove you're done playing small.

# The Dates You MUST Mark

📅 **Jan 6, 9, 17** = Take action days (apply, reach out, ask) AKA our hot girl productivity era

📅 **Jan 13-18** = Network/collaboration golden window AKA when your LinkedIn DMs actually work

📅 **Jan 26** = **LIBERATION DAY** (Neptune leaves Pisces forever) 🎉🎊🥳

📅 **Jan 31** = Reflect and reset AKA journal like your therapist will read it

# Real Talk: Will You Actually Feel Different?

**YES.** But not in a fireworks way. In a ""suddenly I can breathe deeper"" way. In a ""I don't feel guilty for saying no"" way. In a ""my dreams don't feel stupid anymore"" way. In a ""wait I'm allowed to want things???"" way.​

January 26th isn't magic. It's permission. Permission to stop sacrificing yourself for people who don't appreciate it. Permission to want things unapologetically. Permission to believe your life can actually get better.

The 10-year fog ends January 26th. What you do with the clarity is up to you. (pls don't waste it. Neptune will be judging from Aries.)

# Who This Applies To

**Strong impact:** Pisces Sun, Pisces Rising, Pisces Moon, anyone with heavy Pisces placements (Venus, Mars, Mercury in Pisces). If your birth chart looks like an aquarium, this is FOR YOU.​

**Still relevant:** All Pisces. Neptune is OUR ruler. When it moves, we ALL feel it. No Pisces left behind fr.

Drop a 🐟 if you're reading this. Comment **ONE date** you're marking in your calendar. Let's hold each other accountable. The groupchat energy we need rn >>

And if you're serious, we can trauma bond about Neptune and then celebrate its exit like the villain just left the show. (Half joking. Unless?)

**The decade of drowning ends in 24 days. I'll see you on the other side, my Pisces fam!** 💙 ♓️ ✨

*Saving this post? Screenshot the dates. Come back weekly. This is your roadmap. Actually use it. don't let this flop in your camera roll like your 2024 goals.*

**P.S.** If Neptune tries to gaslight you one last time before Jan 26th, remember: We're too close to freedom to fall for its tricks now. We didn't survive 15 years of confusion to fold in the final round. stand on business, Pisces. 💪 ♓️",4,1767296335.0,piscesastrology,1,1.0,False

We are specifically in Mike's POV when it's revealed that Will has powers and when Will is passed out on the couch at WSQK.

\- Mike has been spacing out and somewhat emotionless, drinking coffee all season, etc.

\- The color change of the dial happens during a scene where Mike is present

\- Robin pulling the wrong album to represent Will happens when Mike is present

\- Mike calling Joyce by her first name...?

\- Mike calling Hopper the Paladin. Mike never stepping into his ""Mike the Brave"" name. He is given a fake weapon in the final showdown with the big bad

\- El's goodbye to him being based on all of his lies - ""you're the only person who has ever seen me for who I really am"" or whatever, which is not even kind of true

\- Mike's biggest insecurity has always been that no one else needs him. He is never the hero of any of the stories he creates. He relies on El to fix everything.

\- Will, who has said about a million times that he wants to spend his entire life playing D+D in Mike's basement, is the one who is irritated during their final D+D game after graduation. He moves away to a big city and finds acceptance in the queer community and no longer needs Mike. Also Mike imagining Will with someone who looks very similar to him??

\- Kali said the military will go after Mike because of El. Mike is the perfect target for Vecna because he is deeply insecure, doesn't believe in himself, and is a weakness for both El and Will

\- Tell me the final showdown did not seem like it was written in a teenage boy's imagination who watched way too many cheesy 80's sci fi movies

The first time I talked to him was at a party at the beginning of the school year. I was fifteen, he was nineteen. He walked up to me with confidence, wearing a suit to a party where almost everyone else was dressed casually. At the time, I thought he was strange. We talked for a bit, he asked me to dance, and I said yes, but not long after, I ditched him. I did not understand him, and it felt easier to call him weird than to think about it more. After that night, he was mostly just someone I saw from time to time. Sometimes I would see him in the hallways, and he would always say hi. That was not special to me since he does that with everyone, but it still stayed in my mind. We did not really get to know each other until I joined the debate club and found out he was already part of it. That is when things started to change. We began talking during breaks, almost always in a group, usually with my best friend next to me. Our talks were not superficial We talked about politics, religion, and overall debate worthy topics. Recently, we hung out with a group of friends and played table tennis. Somewhere during that time, I realized we shared the same political views. We had talked about politics before, but never clearly like that. Later that day, he sent me a link to a political party and asked if I would be interested in joining. He is not a member himself, but the fact that he thought of me and wanted to share that with me stayed in my head. I notice small things now. He tries to sit next to me during debate club. He stands close to me whenever he can. None of this proves anything, and yet I cant ignore how aware I am of him. During the break, I asked him if hed like to attend a political meeting with me. He said yes. We decided to meet an hour early for cards and coffee (not because it was romantic!!!, but because it made sense.) Even if its legal where I live, it feels wrong. We shouldnt be together. I understand that. And still, knowing doesnt stop feeling. Ive never liked anyone the way I like him. He reminds me of no one Ive ever met. Maybe thats why this feels so intense, so consuming. His smile genuinely alters my day. I admire how he speaks, how he holds eye contact, how certain he seems of who he is. Im usually extroverted and outspoken, someone who fills silence easily. Around him, I hesitate. I rehearse my words before speaking, afraid of saying too much or too little. I think i love him.",1,1767295883.0,u_Lopsided_Switch9147,0,1.0,False

If you’re here to actually smoke cigars, learn stuff, and talk like a normal human—good. If you’re here to flex humidors and argue over whose palate is “more refined,” take that somewhere else.

This sub is simple:
Post what you’re smoking. Ask questions. Drop honest reviews. Share pairings, deals, lounge finds, cutter/lighting tips, storage wins, and the occasional “I butchered this cigar—help.”

New smokers are 100% welcome. You don’t need a $2,000 humidor or a vocabulary to be here. You just need to be real.

A few ground rules so this place doesn’t turn into trash:
	•	Be respectful. Debate is fine. Being a jerk isn’t.
	•	No gatekeeping. Teach people or keep scrolling.
	•	No illegal sales/trades. Don’t be that guy.
	•	21+ only. Smoke responsibly.

Start with an intro in the comments:
	1.	What are you smoking lately?
	2.	What do you like—mild, medium, full?
	3.	Go-to pairing (coffee, bourbon, beer, etc.)?

TLDR:  Puzzle glued down to cardboard, any suggestions to remove it to mount in a frame?

1st photo: complete puzzle and glue culprit

I finished this probably 2 years ago and I’ve just gotten a frame to hang it up in! For its 2 years of waiting, I kept it stored under a chest of drawers on the floor, folded safely in a cardboard tri-fold display board. I figured I could just use this as a barrier to keep the glue off of anything. As it so happens, I was pretty intoxicated (very exciting NYE, I know), and wanted to be sure to cover EVERY EDGE. I did just that. Now half a day and a LARGE cup of coffee later, I’m trying to pry this thing off of this cardboard and it is not moving. I’ve tried slicing the edges with an exacto knife, but I think glue seeped between each piece, sticking it very snugly to this cardboard. I need any suggestions anyone might have because as I see it right now, I have two options: (1) I spend hours scraping/cutting/prying this thing off of the cardboard and risk ruining this puzzle OR (2) cut completely through the cardboard around the edge of the puzzle and risk it being too thick for the frame I already bought ): please help!

1q1chsk,https://www.reddit.com/r/homeless/comments/1q1chsk/some_things_ive_found_to_keep_going_food_wise/,Some things I’ve found to keep going (food wise),"This is my personal listing of what I’ve found to keep me going and is cheap, filling, and readily available. 

I am using Walmart here as the resource simply because their generic brands and rollbacks are the best prices I can find overall. 

So here goes. 

Flat bread (pita, tortilla, naan) anything on sale or clearance. Avoid loaf bread as it will spoil too fast. 
Crackers are also a nice filling choice but make sure to keep them in ziplock bags to avoid going stale once opened. 

Great value fruit and grain cereal bars value pack. Great breakfast food and very affordable. 

Mayonnaise squeeze container. Can stay shelf stable for weeks if not kept hot so maybe avoid in summer. 

Peanut butter. Great value hands down the best price. Jelly and jam will spoil fast so avoid. 

Kam Yen Jan Chinese Style Sausage
Shelf-Stable rehydrates well and is the best overall tasting sausage I have had. Worth the cost. 

Maruchan 12 pack ramen. Cheap and if you cook with the sausage mentioned it tastes great. 

Great value chunk chicken breast canned 4 or 8 pack. Use with mayo and ranch seasoning for a good tasting chicken salad. Use with tortillas of flat bread. 

Tabasco sauce. This stuff can outlast a nuclear winter and is a great way to punch up bland food. 

Ghee (clarified butter). It is basic butter but shelf stable. 

Campbells chunky soups (always on rollback) 
Progresso rich and hearty soups (also always on rollback)
Both can be eaten cold out the can and are often under $2 per can. Tons of options. 

Chef boyardee 4 pack canned. I like the ravioli and can also be eaten right out the can. 

Chili is a filling protein meal but it is high fiber and salt so your gut may be mad afterwards. I don’t have a recommendation for brand but generally the cheapest is the worst. 

Canned vegetables great value. I like corn, peas and carrots, and mixed vegetables. 
I also like canned beans like pinto and chili. 

Containers of seasonings such as salt, sugar, ranch, etc should be bought in containers and not resealable bags to prevent the risk of puncturing. Also get self serve packs of sauces from gas stations and or delis for mustard, salsa, ketchup, etc. 

Great value has a ranch seasoning that is very affordable. 

Powdered milk stays stable very long and works great in coffee, breakfast drinks, meals such as Mac and cheese and the like. They aren’t the cheapest but you get a lot buying great value and are much more used than condensed milk. 

If you like instant oatmeal, avoid great value. It’s not as flavorful and the quantity per serving is very low. Go name brand. 

Potted meats aside from chicken and tuna are a personal preference. I hate corned beef and would rather starve but the great value brands of canned meats are almost identical to name brands if not better. Some like spam and Vienna sausages but they tend to be very fatty and salty. 

Coffee is a choice. I have one of those stove top percolators and use ground coffee. It’s my vice I guess but I like my morning coffee. The bad thing is coffee has become insanely expensive so it’s a luxury 

Now for things like Mac and cheese mixes, you can get the ones with cheese sauce which make cooking easier but they are pricier than the powdered ones so the great value boxed Mac and cheese works as well. This is where ghee and powdered milk come in. I like to add in chili beans (not chili with meat) to the finished product. 

Now for kitchenware, go with plastic cups and mugs as well as spoon and knife (metal). Forks aren’t as useful as spoons so I recommend the most multipurpose tools. That’s also why I say get a pot to cook with not a pan. You can cook more and it is again multipurpose. 

Get gallon “ziplock” bags and garbage bags as well as paper towels. You can get all these great value for lower cost. 

For personal care, baby wipes and disinfecting wipes great value work wonders. 

Get a few bowls and a small tub for hygiene and quick showers as well as a few wash cloths. 

For trash as well as if needed for a toilet, go to Home Depot and get 2 buckets. They are the cheapest. I’ve used pipe insulation as a cushion on one of the buckets for well you know. Put in a garbage bag and you got an emergency toilet. 

Lastly for water. Unless you have no source of water stations, do not waste money on bottled water. You can usually fill up a 5 or 6 gallon container for under $3 (usually much less depending on where you live). 

Get one of those containers that are often a tad pricy (usually can find one under $20) but are easier to carry and way more sturdy. Not buying bottled water saves your trash footprint which means less carrying out trash. 

So if you’re getting a camping stove, butane isn’t the best for temperature control. It doesn’t really work well when it gets close to freezing and isn’t as available as propane. So get a propane burner, a two burner if possible and either get the portable containers or get one that can be hooked to a large tank (those ones used for barbecue that you see exchanged outside stores everywhere).  

Oh and last thing get a can opener because not all cheap canned food comes with those new pop off lids. 

This is by far not even close to expert advice but it’s what has been keeping me going and has been shelf stable so no need to keep in a cooler. I know some things like farm fresh eggs can last shelf stable but how many of us have access to a farm. 

The big important factor is shelf stability. The last thing you want is food poisoning if you’re broke and living in a tent or car. Being rushed to an ER is going to be a nightmare and potentially dangerous for the safety of your property as it may get trashed or stolen. 

It’s also important to shop for what’s cheap and readily available. Depending on how humid and warm your living conditions are, you want to avoid things that can grow mold and or bacteria fast. 

Disinfecting wipes also help to keep your utensils from getting infected and can easily be washed off after wiping down to remove residue. 

So I hope this helps someone else. I know there are far better options and those of you who have survived much longer will of course have much better recommendations but I want to offer this to hoped help someone in a similar situation to mine. 

Lastly please try and avoid shoplifting. I know it gets hard when you’re hungry and only have so much but it also can become a bad habit that may lead to consequences you don’t want or need. I’m not judging and we’ll all have to do what we have to do but just think before you do ",8,1767295318.0,homeless,5,1.0,False
1q1chit,https://i.redd.it/6zr18x7agsag1.jpeg,Five Nights at Freddy’s 2 Rewritten Chapter 6,"Chapter 6: The Ignited Withereds

Scene: Freddy’s Circus
Miles away, in a quiet suburban cul-de-sac, John was hunched over his coffee table. The television hummed in the background, showing a bright, neon-colored commercial for FazFest.

""Come join the party! It’s the event of a lifetime!"" the announcer chirped.
John rolled his eyes, sketching a feathered Raptor in his notebook. ""I wish I didn't have to deal with this crap anymore,"" he muttered, closing his math textbook. He reached for a bag of chips, enjoying the rare moment of peace while his parents slept upstairs.
Outside, a massive shadow detached itself from the oak tree in the front yard. Withered Freddy moved with a heavy, dragging gait, his matted fur damp from the night dew. He stepped onto the porch, the wood groaning under his immense weight.

Knock. Knock. Knock.

The sound was rhythmic, deceptively human. John paused, a chip halfway to his mouth. He tilted his head. From the other side of the door came a low, vibrating sound—a hollow, metallic groan that sounded like a dying engine.

John’s heart skipped. He lunged for the remote, clicking the TV off. The house plunged into silence, making the next sound even louder.

BANG. BANG. BANG.

The groaning turned into a wet, rasping sound. John scrambled to the window, peeling back the curtain just enough to see a hulking, brown shape and a glint of a silver ear. He didn't scream; he turned off the living room light and bolted up the stairs, his socks sliding on the hardwood.

He dove into his bedroom, sliding into the back of his closet and pulling the slatted doors shut. Below, the front door frame splintered with the sound of a gunshot.

THUD. THUD. THUD.

Freddy was inside. John heard the living room couch being shoved across the floor with a screech of metal on wood. A vase shattered in the dining room. The kitchen was a symphony of crashing trays and breaking glass as the giant moved blindly through the house. Then, the heavy footsteps began to climb the stairs.

John squeezed his eyes shut, his lungs burning as he held his breath. He heard Freddy enter his parents' room. There was no scream—only the sickening, wet CRUNCH of bone and the rhythmic SLAM of heavy animatronic fists hitting the mattress.

Then, silence.

A moment later, John’s bedroom door groaned as it was shoved off its hinges. The smell of rot and old grease filled the air. The heavy footsteps stopped right in front of the closet. Through the slats, John saw a single, glowing blue eye peering into the darkness.
Suddenly, a tinkling, broken melody began to play from the bear’s chest. The Toreador March, distorted and slowed down until it sounded like a funeral dirge.

CRASH.

The closet doors exploded inward. Withered Freddy lunged, his massive jaws locking onto John’s throat before the boy could even gasp. With a violent jerk, he threw John’s limp body onto the bedroom floor.

The bear didn't move to finish him. He simply tucked his hands behind his back, standing in a mock-polite pose, and loomed over John as the boy’s life pooled onto the carpet, the distorted music box playing him into the dark.

Scene: Slender Chica
The moon was a pale sliver over the woods behind the suburbs, casting long, skeletal shadows across the tall grass. Jessica shivered, pulling her jacket tighter as she stepped into the mud.

""Jacob! Get back here right now!"" she hissed, her voice a mixture of annoyance and growing dread. ""If Mom wakes up and sees we’re gone, I’m the one who’s dead! Jacob!""
But her seven-year-old brother wasn't listening. He was focused on the small, pathetic mewling coming from the thicket. Jacob loved animals more than anything; to him, a stray cat in the cold was a tragedy that needed fixing.

""I see him, Jess! He’s white and fluffy!"" Jacob called back, his sneakers squelching in the muck. He slowed his pace, dropping to his knees and extending a trembling hand. ""Hey, kitty... come here, boy. It’s okay. We’re gonna take you home.""

The white cat arched its back, sniffing Jacob’s fingers before leaning in to rub its cheek against his palm. Jacob beamed, the fear of the dark vanishing. ""I got him! We can leave now!""

He started to stand when a loud SNAP echoed through the trees. Jacob turned, thinking it was Jessica finally catching up. ""I found him! Look!""

He didn't see a girl. He saw a towering, yellow shape silhouetted against the dark sky. From the brush, the sound of frantic, heavy metal footsteps—clank-thud-clank-thud—approached with terrifying speed. Withered Chica burst from the treeline like a freight train of rusted steel. She didn't growl; she let out a high-pitched, electronic screech that tore through the night air.
Before Jacob could even scream, the massive animatronic tackled him into the mud.

The Silent Woods
Jessica stopped in her tracks. She had heard a heavy THUD and the sound of something large moving, but then... silence. No Jacob. No cat.

""Jacob? That isn't funny,"" she whispered, her heart beginning to race. ""I'm serious, let's go. Jacob!""

She pushed through the brush, her eyes scanning the ground. Suddenly, she heard a sound that made her blood run cold—the cat was whimpering, a high, pained yelp that was abruptly cut short by a wet, heavy STOMP.

Jessica rounded a large oak and froze.
Withered Chica stood in the center of a muddy clearing. Her jaw was unhinged, hanging by rusted wires, and her blacked-out eyes seemed to swallow the light. Below her lay Jacob, his body charred and still from a massive electrical surge. Beside him, the white cat was nothing more than a matted streak of fur in the dirt.

The animatronic’s head twitched 180 degrees to face Jessica. Her voice box erupted in a deafening blast of white noise and static—*SHHHHHHHHHH—*as she lurched forward.

""HELP! SOMEBODY HELP!"" Jessica shrieked.

She turned and sprinted toward the back of their house, her lungs burning. She reached the sliding glass door and fumbled with the handle, but Withered Chica was already there, having caught up fast.

A yellow, wire-tangled arm smashed through the glass, shards raining down as the robot reached blindly for Jessica’s throat, sparks jumping from its exposed fingertips.

Jessica kicked the arm away and scrambled inside, heading for the stairs. She thought if she could just get to her parents' room, they would save her. But she didn't even make it to the third step.

Chica’s massive, three-toed foot shattered the door frame. She lunged, her arm-stumps wrapping around Jessica’s waist like a vice. Jessica felt a surge of heat and a blinding light as Chica’s internal power supply surged through her body. 

Her scream was cut short as the electricity locked her muscles, and she slumped into the yellow bird’s grip, a silent victim in her own home. Withered Chica heard Jessica’s parents get up from their beds. She marches up the stairs to claim two bonus kills. Once she reaches the top, the parents' lives were shut off once Chica got inside.

Scene: Withered_Foxy.EXE
The laptop screen went black, and for a moment, the only sound in the room was Carlton’s own breathing. He sat in the dark, the silence of the house feeling thick and heavy.

Outside, crouched low beneath the windowsill, Withered Foxy tilted his head. His rusted joints gave off a faint, rhythmic clicking. He didn't lung; he waited. He let his voice box cycle through a series of broken, low-frequency tones until a distorted, gravelly pirate rasp leaked out into the night air.

""Listen... to my voice... and you will find... the key...""

Carlton bolted upright. ""Who's there?""
He reached for his bedside lamp, but the switch clicked uselessly. He tried the overhead light. Nothing. The entire house was a void. Panic began to prickle at his skin as he fumbled for the heavy metal flashlight on his desk. He clicked it on, the beam cutting a narrow, shaky path through the darkness of his bedroom.

He stepped into the hallway. The air was cold—unnaturally cold—and smelled of stagnant oil and wet fur. Every time he turned, he felt a gaze on his back, but the beam of his light only revealed empty corners and closed doors. He tried the front door—locked. The back door—jammed. The windows wouldn't budge. He was trapped in a box.

From the shadows of the staircase, the voice returned, dropping an octave into a guttural, menacing growl.

""When you can see... how fast... can you flee?""

Carlton’s hand shook so hard the light danced wildly across the walls. He realized he was being stalked in his own home. He wasn't just looking for an intruder; he was looking for a ghost in a machine.

He crept toward the kitchen, his light darting left and right. He heard a soft, metallic tink—like a hook dragging against a picture frame—coming from behind him. He spun around, shining the light down the long corridor, but there was nothing there but the darkness.

He didn't know that Foxy was currently flattened against the ceiling directly above him, his tattered crimson limbs hooked into the crown molding, his single yellow eye watching the top of Carlton's head.

Carlton checked the bathroom. No luck. His flashlight flickering, he’s running out of time. He checks the basement. He couldn’t find Foxy anywhere in the house. Foxy speaks again. His voice getting angered and more distorted. This is Carlton’s last chance. He looked in his parents bedroom. His parents throats were already slit open by Withered Foxy having snuck in here. Their blood and bodies on the floor. Carlton gasps silently and covers his mouth.

“Be sure your step through the heart of madness.”

Carlton leaves his parents room and rushes to the living room. Withered Foxy’s eyes light up in the parents bedroom in the corner. Carlton bangs on the front door and tries to force it open. Withered Foxy’s eyes glowing as he’s approaching the living room, making loud thumps with his footsteps. 

Upon seeing Carlton trying to leave, his eyes beam red and dashed forward, hook raised , he slashed Carlton’s chest and Carlton falls over. Carlton screams out in pain as Withered Foxy growls and snarls like a rabid animal. 

Withered Foxy then stabs his hook deep in Carlton’s chest and begins to lift him up close to him. Carlton screams and cries as Foxy cuts his life out. His hook stabbed into Carlton’s heart. Foxy drops Carlton and says one final line before leaving.

The heavy Maglite in Carlton’s hand flickered, the beam dying down to a weak, sickly yellow. The batteries were failing. He had checked every corner of the basement and every stall in the bathroom, but the house remained a labyrinth of shadows.
The silence was broken by a sound like grinding gravel—Foxy’s voice box was redlining, the distortion making his words sound like they were coming from underwater.

""Be... sure... your step... through the heart... of madness...""

Terrified, Carlton sprinted toward his parents' room, desperate for their help. He burst through the door, his flashlight beam swinging wildly across the bed. He stopped dead. The sheets were soaked with a dark, heavy crimson. 

His parents lay there, their throats opened with surgical, mechanical precision. The room smelled of copper and ozone. Carlton’s flashlight slipped from his sweating palms, hitting the carpet with a soft thud as he clamped both hands over his mouth to stifle a sob.

He didn't see the two yellow pinpricks of light ignite in the far corner of the bedroom.
""I have to get out,"" he whimpered, stumbling back into the hallway. ""I have to get out!""
He raced to the living room, throwing his weight against the front door. He pulled at the handle, kicked the wood, and screamed, but the door remained a solid wall. Behind him, the rhythmic, heavy THUD-CLACK of metal feet began to accelerate.

Carlton spun around just as the darkness of the hallway was split by a pair of glowing red eyes. Foxy wasn't playing anymore. He let out a jagged, metallic roar and dashed forward, his tattered crimson fur a blur.
SHLICE.

The silver hook caught Carlton across the chest, throwing him backward onto the coffee table. Carlton let out a strangled scream, clutching at the deep gashes in his shirt. He tried to crawl away, but the fox was already looming over him, snapping his rusted jaws like a rabid beast.

With a sudden, violent movement, Foxy drove his hook deep into Carlton’s chest, the metal piercing through bone and muscle until it found the heart. Carlton’s body jerked, his eyes wide and unfocused as his life was drained away in the center of his living room.
Foxy leaned in close, the smell of rot and old grease filling Carlton’s fading senses. The fox’s voice box stabilized for one final, mocking broadcast.

""All your base are belong to us.""
The fox withdrew his hook, letting Carlton’s body slump to the floor. Without a second look, Withered Foxy walked to the front door. With a simple click of his internal sensors, the lock disengaged. He stepped out into the night air, leaving the house of silence behind as he headed toward other distant houses, for more victims.

Scene: Bonzi Bonnie
The atmosphere in the house was thick with the smell of old paper and the hum of a desk lamp. Marla and Lamar sat huddled over their textbooks, their faces pale under the light. Both were rubbing their temples, nursing a shared headache that felt like a rhythmic thudding against their skulls—unaware that the rhythm was actually the heavy, mechanical footfalls of Withered Bonnie outside.

From the safety of the oak trees, Shadow Freddy—a dark, flickering glitch in reality—watched the faceless rabbit slip through a basement window. Bonnie didn't move quickly; he was patient, a hulking mass of blue-violet felt and exposed wiring.

""Marla? Can I stay with you?"" Jason, Marla’s younger brother, stood in the doorway, clutching a pillow.

""Not now, Jason. I’m exhausted and we have to finish this,"" Marla sighed, waving him away. ""Go back to bed.""

Jason trudged back toward the stairs, but a heavy CRASH from the basement made him freeze. His eyes went wide. ""The Boogeyman..."" he whispered, before sprinting up to his room and slamming the door.

""Did you hear that?"" Marla asked, looking at Lamar.

Lamar swallowed hard, his eyes darting to the basement door. ""Probably just a stack of boxes. This house is old.""

""Let's just check,"" Marla insisted.

They descended into the damp darkness, heading for the laundry room. As they poked through the cobwebs and tilted crates, Withered Bonnie was already moving. He moved up the basement stairs with surprising silence for his size, his single red eye-pinprick glowing in the dark. He bypassed the living room and went straight for the upper floor.

The Face of Terror

Jason was huddled under his blankets when the banging started. It wasn't a knock; it was a rhythmic, metallic pounding that shook the frame. The door groaned and splintered as Bonnie forced his way in.

Jason gasped, sitting bolt upright. Standing over his bed was a nightmare: a tall, faceless rabbit with wires dangling where a jaw should be. Before Jason could even scream, Bonnie’s heavy, mechanical hand clamped onto his forehead and chin. 

With a sickening, wet sound of tearing muscle, Bonnie ripped Jason’s face clean off, mirroring his own hollowed-out visage. Jason’s gurgling cries were swallowed by the blood in his throat as he slumped back into the pillows.

Downstairs, Marla and Lamar headed back up. ""See? Nothing but boxes,"" Lamar said, trying to steady his voice.

""Can you just check on Jason for me?"" Marla asked. ""He seemed really scared.""

Lamar nodded and walked into Jason's room. The boy was tucked in tight, the covers pulled up to his nose. ""Jason? You awake, buddy?""

No response. Lamar reached out and pulled the blanket back. He didn't scream; he couldn't. The air left his lungs at the sight of the raw, red mess where Jason’s face used to be. 

Lamar stumbled back, his boots slick with the blood on the floor. He scrambled into the parents' room across the hall to call for help, but as he moved through the dark, his hand brushed something cold and wet. 

In the shadows, the dismembered remains of Marla's parents were piled like cordwood.
Lamar turned to bolt back to Marla, but the doorway was now occupied by a faceless titan. 

Withered Bonnie let out a screech that sounded like a saw hitting metal. Before Lamar could even raise his hands, Bonnie’s fist—a solid block of steel and plastic—slammed into Lamar’s face with enough force to kill him instantly. Bonnie then lifted his foot and crashed it onto Lamar’s head multiple times.

The Clean-Up

Marla stood at the bottom of the stairs, frowning. ""Lamar? Is he okay?""

The house was eerily silent. Upstairs, Bonnie moved with cold, robotic efficiency. He shoved the parents' remains further under the bed, dragged Lamar’s body into Marla’s bedroom closet, and carefully tucked the blanket back over Jason’s headless form.

Marla began to walk up the stairs, the silence feeling heavier with every step. She reached the landing, noticing the faint, metallic scent of iron in the air.

""Lamar? If this is a joke, it's not funny,"" she whispered, reaching for the handle of her bedroom door.

The silence of the house was slowly replaced by a cacophony of madness. Inside Marla’s mind, a carousel of distorted melodies began to spin. First, a warped, tinny circus theme; then, the slow, dragging notes of Daisy Bell; followed by the booming, minor-key chimes of the Toreador March. Finally, it settled on a haunting, glitching loop of London Bridge is Falling Down.

""Lamar? Stop it!"" Marla shouted, clutching her head as the music felt like it was vibrating her teeth. ""I’m serious! If we fail this test, my parents are going to ground me until I’m thirty! Turn off the speakers!""

She marched back toward the living room, her frustration masking her terror—until the music stopped. In its place came a sound that froze her blood.

""Marla! Please! It hurts!"" It was her mother’s voice, screaming from the foyer.
""Help us, Marla! He’s tearing us apart!"" That was Lamar. Then came Jason’s high-pitched, gurgling sob.

""Mom?! Jason?!"" Marla sprinted toward the front door, her heart hammering. ""I’m coming!""

She burst into the entryway, but the hallway didn't lead outside. Standing between her and the door was a flickering, violet-black void in the shape of a bear. 

Shadow Freddy stood there, his translucent form twitching and snapping in and out of existence like a corrupted video file. The screams were coming directly from his unmoving jaw, perfectly mimicking the voices of her loved ones.

The lights in the house died instantly.
Before Marla could scream, a massive, cold arm wrapped around her chest from behind, pinning her arms to her sides. The smell of oil and old felt was overwhelming. Withered Bonnie had her.

In front of her, Shadow Freddy began to distort. His body slumped, shrinking and twisting until he took the form of a rotted, golden bear suit slumped on the floor. Then, with a sickening crackle of static, the body vanished, leaving only a giant, floating Golden Freddy head. The eyes were voids of infinite darkness, and its jaw unhinged wider than a human torso.

The head let out a demonic, bass-boosted roar that shattered the nearby windows. It lunged. With Bonnie holding her still, Marla had nowhere to go. The darkness swallowed her whole as the ""heart of madness"" claimed the last of the group.

Back in the Car
The interior of Henry’s car felt suffocatingly quiet after the chaos of the night. Charlotte stared at the screen of her father's phone, watching the ""No Signal"" icon blink mockingly at her. She had tried John, Jessica, Carlton, Marla—everyone. Not a single call went through.

She didn't know that the lines weren't just down; the people on the other end were gone.

With a heavy sigh, she tapped the power button and handed the phone back to Henry. ""Nothing,"" she whispered, her voice trembling. ""I can't get through to anyone. It’s like the whole world just... stopped.""
Henry took the phone, his knuckles white as he gripped the steering wheel.

I just got asked, “What’s the most iconic first date idea you can think of?”

And I genuinely had to stop and stare at my phone.

Why does a first date need to be iconic. Iconic for who. The Smithsonian?

A first date is not a movie montage. It is two strangers politely trying to determine if the other one is weird in a way they can tolerate. It is coffee. It is a walk. It is maybe a picnic if both people are emotionally stable and the weather cooperates. You talk. You ask questions. You see if the vibes are aggressively off or just mildly confusing.

What even is an iconic first date. Am I supposed to say hot air balloon at sunset followed by a private chef and a surprise fireworks display. Because if that is the expectation, I fear we are already incompatible.

These questions feel like they completely skip over the point of dating. I do not know you. You do not know me. Why are we planning a once in a lifetime experience when we have not yet established whether you chew with your mouth open or think podcasts count as personality traits.

It just makes the whole thing feel weirdly fake. Like dating has turned into a branding exercise instead of two humans being curious about each other. I want to ask you what you are into, what makes you laugh, how you spend your weekends. Not pitch an itinerary like I am applying for The Bachelor.

Now listen, iconic dates absolutely have a place. Long term relationships. Special occasions. When you already know you like each other. That makes sense. But a first date does not need to be iconic. It needs to be low pressure and honest and ideally short enough that escape is possible.

Anyway. Please stop asking me to invent a cinematic experience and just ask me something real. Or ask me if I want coffee. That is iconic enough.",7,1767295287.0,Bumble,14,0.71,False

Due to a stellar review of Valor's Decaf ([Book Club](https://valor.coffee/shop/book-club)) from a community member last year, I ordered a box in December 2024. Inside that box (along with the coffee) was a golden ticket that gave me ***an entire year of a Valor subscription FOR FREE!*** At first, I simply couldn't believe what had happened. I don't have a lot of money to spend on coffee, so a premium subscription has always been out of reach, so this seemed a little too good to be true. After sending a confirmation pic of me with the ticket, I was off to the races. The subscription provided one box every two weeks (26 in total, all of which you can see in the first photo), which was slightly more than I could drink on my own. This quantity meant I could experiment with quality coffee for the first time, testing different recipes without having to worry about running out of the single premium bag I had purchased. For reference, my setup is a glass v60 with Cafec Abacas and a Fellow Ode Gen 2 (factory burrs). I had also never found the opportunity to taste coffees from this many different farms in such quick succession, meaning I could compare previously out-of-reach beans side-by-side. At the very least, this helped me come to a better understanding of my own preferences in coffee, but I think I also learned an enormous amount about v60 recipes along the way.

My four favorite each have their own photo above, but here's a list:

**Costa Rica Anaerobic Double Diamond** \- the juiciest and most dynamic coffee I have every brewed at home, this one's flavor changed significantly over the 8 weeks that I eked out drinking it. 

**Kenya Nyeri Hill Estate** \- brought the funk in a way that I hadn't found pleasant before, opening my eyes to a new flavor profile that I now enjoy exploring.

**Colombia Sebastian Ramirez Pink Bourbon** \- if I could only drink one coffee for the rest of my life, this might be it. Full bodied but nuanced, you could get many different flavors out of it by minorly adjusting brew factors.

**Book Club Decaf** \- truly the best decaf I've ever tasted. Sweet and comforting but filled with fruit notes that evolve over about 6 weeks.

1q1cbb8,https://i.redd.it/u0hb7ealesag1.png,"""That's Not Love. That's Surveillance."" ----  A short piece on the trauma of performing for others.","I’ve been thinking a lot about the ""fawn"" trauma response lately.... how we learn to read rooms just to stay safe. I tried to capture that feeling of being ==***high-functioning***== but hollow.

**That's Not Love. That's Surveillance.**

Rayyan was doing great. That's what everyone said anyway.

Good job at a tech company doing something with data pipelines he couldn't explain at parties, girlfriend who made her own sourdough, gym membership he actually used. He was 32 and checking all the right boxes.

But every morning he woke up and felt like he was living behind glass.

Not depressed. He'd been depressed before and this wasn't that. This was different. Like watching his own life happen on a screen. He'd go to dinner with friends and hear himself laugh at the right times and think, who the fuck is that?

Tuesday afternoon he had a gap between meetings and went to the park. There was an old guy on a bench who looked like he'd been sitting there since the Carter administration. Rayyan sat down to check his phone.

And then he just started talking.

I don't know what makes you spill your guts to a stranger. Rayyan told him about the tightness in his chest that never went away. About being so goddamn tired of white-knuckling his way through every single day while pretending everything was fine.

The old man didn't say anything for a while. Cars went by. Some kid was screaming about ice cream. Then he pointed at this tree growing out of a crack in the sidewalk.

""You see where that thing's growing?""

Rayyan looked. The bark was split wide open, raw green wood showing through.

""Not where it's thick. Where it's wounded.""

The guy looked at him. ""You're trying to turn yourself into concrete, son. But concrete doesn't grow. It just cracks.""

The guy left. Rayyan sat there for probably half an hour.

Rayyan always thought trauma was the Big Event. His dad leaving when he was nine. The car accident junior year. That deployment in Afghanistan he didn't talk about.

But the thing about wounds is they don't care that the knife is gone. His shoulders still lived up by his ears. He still woke up at 3am with his heart pounding. Certain voices still made him want to run.

Something that happened fifteen years ago was still happening.

When they get too big, crabs have to molt. They shed the entire exoskeleton and spend a few days completely soft, hiding under rocks because anything could kill them.

Rayyan had been building his shell thicker for years. More discipline. More success. More control. And it worked, kind of. People thought he had his shit together.

When you're a kid and being yourself threatens survival, you learn real fast to cut those parts out. You become what you need to be. The good kid. The easy kid.

It works. You survive.

But Rayyan realized something sitting on that bench that made him want to throw up. He hadn't just adapted. He'd gotten good at it. Really good. He'd learned to read rooms, to be exactly what people needed, to make himself valuable enough that they wouldn't leave.

His girlfriend loved how attentive he was. She didn't know he was always watching her face for signs of disappointment, adjusting himself in real time. That's not love. That's surveillance.

His friends thought he was laid-back. He wasn't. He just never said what he actually wanted because then he'd have to risk them saying no.

His boss thought he was a team player. He was. Because he'd learned that being indispensable was safer than being honest.

He wasn't performing to survive. He was performing to control. To keep people from getting close enough to see there was nothing there. Just a collection of reactions to other people's needs.

The anger that came back wasn't righteous. It was petty and mean. Mad about shit from seven years ago. Mad that his girlfriend got to be moody when he never did. Mad that everyone got to be difficult except him.

The neediness was worse. He'd spent thirty years being the person who didn't need anything, and now he needed everything. Reassurance, attention, proof that people would stay even when he was annoying.

His girlfriend left three months after the bench. Not because he changed. Because she'd fallen in love with the performance and didn't recognize what was underneath. The real him was harder to love. More jagged. Less convenient.

He lost friends too. Turns out some people only liked him because he never asked for anything. The moment he had boundaries, they were gone.

Rayyan still catches himself performing. Still feels that urge to make himself easier.

But last week someone at work asked if he was okay and instead of saying ""yeah, fine"" he said ""honestly, kind of a rough day.""

The person didn't leave. Didn't fix it. Just said ""that sucks, man"" and bought him coffee.

I am a lurker of some time largely because I have had very little to share however as I have had a questions, I thought I would both say Hello and observe social niceties before asking anything! SO Hi! 

I have been a longtime (since around 1996) occult practitioner with intermittent interruptions due to life, so I am not new to things but it is always interesting to get different opinions.   
  
I recently had a very (ridiculously so) successful ritual with a Demon (VINE) and got above and beyond what I had asked for. I don't normally work with this demon and in fact I was waffling before I started as to if this was correct demon. As I said, ABOVE AND BEYOND and while the results were not what I had wanted, the demon did exactly what I had requested (isn't that the case?) and again it was not bare minimum. It was one of the top 3 occult experiences I have had in my life of 30 years of dabbling in the occult.   


This is where my Question comes in.    
I have offered A to the demon.  THey absolutely will receive it...   
Demon delivered A+ Results, where the results warbled and were less than desired is where human intersected.  It was 100% on Me. Without going into detail it was my reaction that prevented a better response.   
Demon asked for B as payment.  Not completely unrelated but say... you offered to make someone coffee and they took you to starbucks and got a crazy espresso drink in venti with all sorts of flavours and extras.  Definitively out of the offered expectation but like... not completely and you kinda get it.   
  
Should I reward the demon with B as requested, or stick to the agreed upon (strict) A as per our contract.   
  
B option is not anything that would be a burden or otherwise cause me any issues, but I am curious as I don't have a HUGE background in working with Demons if this might be a faux pas in regards to future relationships or if I should give them the B-Request to potentially build a better relationship.  

I'm leaning towards B-option because it's not a big deal for me and I do want to keep relationships good.  But is there any reason why I might be wiser to stick to A, the offered option? ",2,1767294872.0,DemonolatryPractices,4,1.0,False

1q1c8ao,https://www.reddit.com/r/breakingmom/comments/1q1c8ao/i_have_said_the_word_stop_so_many_times_in_the/,I have said the word “stop” so many times in the last three days it has lost its meaning,"You know how if you say a word over and over it stops sounding like a real word? That’s what has happened to the word “stop” in the last three days since I’ve been stuck home alone without preschool over the new year holiday.

My husband is a flight attendant, and helpfully decided to pick up a trip that coincided with the last three days. I stress that my husband picked up this trip. He was not on the schedule or obliged to fly it. He also didn’t talk to me about in advance as he normally does. He just told me after the fact. He’s on a 32 hour layover on the west coast right now while I’m stuck at home with our (possibly ADHD) 5-year old son.

We are both bored. I’m exhausted. It’s cold and everything is closed. All I want to do is sit and zone out or take a nap, but instead I’m here with our kid who has lost all ability to entertain himself and has resorted to an endless stream of extremely obnoxious behavior. 

I know he’s a kid. I know he’s bored and he just wants my attention, but I also have inattentive adhd and after HOURS of playing and building legos and being used as a human jungle gym/punching bag, I need some time to myself and I can’t stand the constant clinging and whining and attention seeking behavior. I’m slowly losing my mind.

Like, today, after lunch I just wanted some coffee, but over the course of an hour I had to say “stop” 1 bajillion times. First it was him singing “happy birthday to poop!” At the top of his lungs. Then it was: poking the cat on the head incessantly; throwing toys into the dishwasher while I was trying to load it then crying when a toy got covered in dirty water; moving the dining room chairs to block the door to the kitchen; jumping on me; slapping my butt incessantly; trying to lick me; biting my sweater; grabbing toys and literally shoving them in my face over and over; spinning around in a circle and then falling and hitting his head and then crying. He shadows me from room to room, clinging to my arms and legs while doing this manic laugh and jumping up and down. I tried to put on a movie, but even during that he spent his time jumping on my back. Sticking his feet in my face. Putting his bum on my shoulder and saying he’s going to wipe his bum on me. Or, just randomly coming up to me and hitting me repeatedly. 

I’d feel bad it I hadn’t spent most of the morning actively playing and building Lego with him. He’s gotten all of my attention for the past three days, but Im not getting any time to myself to decompress and between the constant screeching, whining, hitting, and irritating behavior, I’m fried.

The end.

1q1c7h4,https://i.redd.it/o3qe48jbesag1.jpeg,Five Nights at Freddy’s 2 Rewritten Chapter 5,"Chapter 5: Can you Survive?
The office was no longer a sanctuary; it was a cage. The industrial fans groaned as a heavy, metallic thud echoed from the left vent. Mike barely had time to turn before the metal grate was obliterated.

Withered Bonnie exploded into the room, a faceless nightmare of blue fur and exposed wiring. He let out a mechanical roar that vibrated in Mike’s teeth. A massive, three-fingered claw lunged for Mike’s throat. 

Mike tries to close the vent up but Withered Bonnie punches a hole through the vent cover. He pushes it off with brute force. Thinking fast, Mike scrambled for the desk, snatched the Freddy mask, and jammed it over his head just as the animatronic reached him.

Withered Bonnie froze. His two red eyes pulsed, scanning the plastic bear face. He tilted his head at a sickening angle, the servos whirring in the silence. After a tense eternity, the machine let out a low huff of static and turned away, retreating into the darkness of the hall.

Mike didn't even have time to breathe. A frantic scratching came from the right. Withered Chica forced her way through the opposite vent, her jaw unhinged and her arms held out like a macabre doll. 

Mike flinched, the mask slipping from his sweaty grip and clattering to the floor. Chica lunged. She didn't have hands, but she used her wire-filled stumps to clap toward the mask, trying to pin it down and snatch it from Mike. Mike roared in desperation, kicking her square in the chest. 

The metal-on-metal impact sent a jolt of pain up his leg, but it bought him a second to snatch the mask and roll away. He shoved it back on just as Chica’s twitching face loomed over him. She sniffed the air, her sensors failing to register a human, and wandered back into the hallway.
But the giants weren't done. The floor began to shake.

Withered Freddy filled the hallway, his massive frame blocking out what little light remained. Withered Foxy is standing behind Withered Freddy at a fair distance. He stepped into the office, his presence cold and suffocating. Without a word, he reached out and swiped the monitor off the desk, shattering it against the floor.

Mike cowered, the Freddy mask trembling in his hands. He stared up at the ""real"" Freddy. There’s no way he falls for this, Mike thought. I'm wearing his own face. Freddy’s hand hovered inches from Mike’s head, his fingers twitching as if fighting the programming. 

For fifteen seconds, the world stood still. Then, Freddy let out a low, disappointed mechanical groan, kicked the ruined monitor, and stomped back into the Main Hall.

Mike collapsed against the wall, his chest heaving. He reached out and bumped a rusted, broken alarm clock on the floor. The digital display flickered to life for a few seconds: 5:59 AM.

""I hope Henry…Henry finds Abby,"" Mike whispered. ""Please…please."" Mike lifts the monitor back up and tries starting it back up. “Please…still work…” the monitor comes online and he tries accessing Toy Bonnie’s first. “Come on..come on…” an echoed laughter messes with the signal for the monitor. Balloon Boy and JJ are slowly catching up, hidden in the shadows. Mike turned to the cameras. Withered Bonnie was punching the cameras out

Balloon Boy is heard getting inside a vent and crawling inside. JJ soon followed after. Withered Bonnie was busy disabling the cameras by punching them. But the shadows at the end of the long hallway shifted. Withered Foxy stood there, his crimson fur tattered, his hook glinting. Henry had warned him about the others, but he’d forgotten one crucial detail: Withered Foxy’s sensors were ruined. 

He didn't see the mask. He saw the man.
Foxy’s ears twitched. He let out a low, guttural growl and lowered his head. Withered Foxy stares directly through the eye holes. Mike frantically pulled the mask down, but Foxy didn't pause. He didn't tilt his head. He sprinted.

The fox was a blur of rusted metal. He hit the office like a freight train, swiping the mask clean off Mike’s head with his hook and shredding the plastic into pieces. Withered Foxy roared and threw his head back and let out a piercing, triumphant screech that echoed through the entire building.

The call was answered.

In the party rooms, Withered Bonnie’s head snapped toward the office. In the Main Hall, Withered Freddy stopped mid-stride and turned around. And from the left vent, Balloon Boy tumbled into the room, his wooden eyes wide and manic as he began to laugh, signaling to the giants that the prey was finally cornered. JJ pops in the opposite vent as well.

Mike scrambled backward as Foxy’s hook whistled through the air, burying itself deep into the already shattered monitor with a spray of sparks. The fox snarled, ripping the metal aside to lunge again, his jaws snapping inches from Mike’s face. 

“Shit…shit!” Mike panicked hard and tried to contact Henry on the walkie talkie, but Balloon Boy’s laugh jammed the signal. He’s in the office holding his balloon prop and sign. 

Mike didn't wait; he dove under the desk and bolted for the hallway, his boots skidding on the checkered tiles. Behind him, Foxy’s heavy foot came down on the alarm clock, crushing the glass and the ""5:59"" display into dust. 

Withered Foxy rushes up at fast speeds and slashes Mike with his claw, Mike falls backward as Withered Foxy prepares his hook and slams down into the floor as Mike rolls over to dodge. The hook is stuck in the floor for a bit as Mike quickly gets up.
Mike darts past Withered Freddy, who missed swinging his arm at him, then Withered Chica who missed grabbing him with the clap of her arms. Mike saw the front doors—the moonlight was so close—but the shadows moved faster.

Withered Bonnie stepped out from a blind corner, his faceless head emitting a piercing, high-pitched frequency. 

Mike didn't even have time to scream before the animatronic’s metal fist collided with his temple. The world blurred into a static-filled gray, and Mike hit the floor, unconscious before he even felt the cold linoleum.
He didn't see Withered Freddy and Withered Chica loom over him. He didn't feel them grab his arms and drag his limp body back through the kitchen, through the dining hall, and into the dark, oil-slicked room of Parts & Service.

When Mike’s eyes flickered open, he couldn't move. His arms and legs were pinned by heavy, moth-eaten foam and cold steel. He was stuffed inside an empty, oversized Freddy Fazbear suit, his head tilted forward.
Sitting directly across from him, slumped in the shadows, was the Withered Golden Freddy suit. Shadow Freddy phases into existence slumped over and his shadow melted into Withered Golden Freddy. The suit twitched a little

The yellow bear's head tilted upward. From the hollow eye sockets, two pinpricks of white light ignited. A voice, hollow and echo-filled, drifted through the room—not a mechanical recording, but a boy's voice. Blood stains appear on the eye sockets
Golden Freddy doesn’t talk to Mike, but begins to implant a dream or vision into Mike’s mind

A sudden, violent surge of images flooded Mike’s mind—a psychic link forced open. He saw the charcoal sedan. He saw a younger William Afton, his face obscured by the mask of the yellow rabbit’s cruel smile. 

He saw Sammy being hoisted into the back seat, terrified and alone. Then, the car stopped again. He saw the woods. He saw Garrett being taken from the roadside. Both boys, lost on the same gray afternoon.

After they died, they stayed here. They’ve shared these bodies. We played in the dark while the world forgot them. But they didn't forget the adults who watched and did nothing. 

On the final day, when the 'Toys' were new, Mangle showed them what happens when we get angry. One bite... that’s all it took to close this place.

Mike’s breathing gets faster. He couldn’t believe it. He’s looking into the eyes of Henry’s deceased son in front of him. Garrett is still here. He's very angry with Mike. He says you let him go. He says you didn't look back.

Mike tried to shout, but a sharp click sounded near his ribcage.

You better not move, Mike. The springlocks in that suit are old. If you breathe too deep, they’ll snap. He made little Sammy figure it out…the hard way. You’ll die just like he did—slowly, in the dark.

The door to the Parts & Service room creaked open. The Withered animatronics—Freddy, Bonnie, Chica, and Foxy—filed out of the room in a grim procession. They weren't staying in the pizzeria anymore. They were heading for the exit, out into the streets to hunt any adult they could find.

A promise is a promise. Sammy’s form beginning to fade into the shadows. They hunt together now. Stay still, Mike. Maybe the police will find your body before the locks give out.

With a final, ghostly chuckle, Golden Freddy vanished into thin air, leaving Mike alone in the pitch-black room, trapped in a suit that wanted to kill him.

Scene: Henry’s Car
The tires of Henry’s sedan hummed over the asphalt, but the sound was drowned out by the frantic static coming from the walkie-talkie.

""Mike? Mike, do you copy?"" Henry shouted into the device, his knuckles white on the steering wheel. ""The trackers are moving! They’re heading toward the residential zone!""

In the backseat, Charlotte sat huddled, her small hands trembling. ""Is Sammy going to be okay, Daddy? Is he coming with us?""
Henry’s jaw tightened. He looked at the empty road ahead, his eyes filled with a father’s grief. ""I don't know, Charlie. But we have to stop him. Even if... even if we have to use force."" 

The interior of Henry’s car was a sanctuary of flickering dashboard lights and the smell of stale coffee. The engine groaned as Henry pushed the sedan down the dark highway.
Charlotte shifted in the back seat, her eyes darting to the shadowed treeline passing by. ""Daddy? Can I have your phone? I want to call my friends... I want to make sure they’re okay.""

Henry sighed, reaching into his pocket and handing the device back to her. ""Be quick, Charlie. We need to keep the line open for Mike.""

Charlotte frantically dialed, pressing the phone to her ear. ""No signal,"" she whispered, frustrated. Outside, clinging to the underside of the chassis, Toy Mangle’s voice box emitted a faint, rhythmic pulse of radio static—skree-chk-skree—that blended perfectly with the road noise. In the front seat, Henry’s walkie-talkie hissed with a tiny, distant giggle.

He-he-he.

Henry didn't notice; his eyes were glued to the rearview mirror. Charlotte hit redial, trying to reach John. This was a huge mistake. The animatronics may be old entertainers, but they have advanced technology. Being able to detect signals, radio waves, and electromagnetic waves around the area, Charlotte unintentionally gave the animatronics more meat to chew on.

1q1c1nz,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1q1c1nz,Made an unexpected friend at Bandstand today,"Happy New Year, Mumbai!
So I usually spend my time at the library studying, but today I got restless since it’s the 1st and decided to actually do something different. So I went to Bandra West, bought a journal from Cheap Jack, and headed to Bandstand to watch the sunset.
I was sitting there journaling with my earphones in (yeah seems kinda performative ik😭) when this huge group showed up. There was this old man in the center and everyone was taking photos and videos of him. I was so confused and thought he was some celebrity at first, and then the whole group just sat down around him and they started singing songs for him. 
That’s when this girl approached me asking what was happening. I said I was as clueless as her, and we just started talking. Turned out we had SO much in common. I’m 20 something, confused about my career, stuck between my interests and expectations (both mine and my parents’). She’s about 7 years older but didn’t look it at all, and she’d just taken a career break after working 7-8 years with zero work-life balance.
The thing is, she actually understood what I was going through. She said her friends and family couldn’t relate to her decision, which made her feel isolated. We both realized we’re the types who overthink everything while most people just… go with the flow? Accept what comes? Do what society expects? And maybe that’s why they’re happier and we’re out here constantly seeking and questioning things.
Anyway, we ended up going for coffee at this place called Eat Around the Corner in Bandra. Really nice vibe. I got a cappuccino and Nutella spiral, she ordered cold coffee and their junglee chicken sandwich. We talked more about life, family, friends. Then we realized both our birthdays fall on the 1st of different months, and we met on 1st January. Felt oddly meant to be.
She clicked some really good photos of me too. Before leaving, we exchanged numbers and promised to stay in touch. I’ve had a  friendship breakup recently so this felt really nice and I’m genuinely glad I stepped out today. Sometimes the best connections happen when you least expect them.

TLDR: Went solo to Bandstand on New Year’s Day, witnessed a random wholesome gathering, got approached by a stranger, discovered we’re dealing with similar life confusion, bonded over being “overthinkers,” got coffee at Eat Around the Corner, and made what feels like a genuine friend.

Café: Eat Around the Corner has nice ambience. Cappuccino was decent, Nutella spiral and the sandwich was worth it. ",15,1767294265.0,mumbai,5,0.94,False

It’s a 4.5 x 60 double perfecto with a Mexican San Andrés wrapper, Dominican corojo binder, and Dominican + U.S. filler — and the blend actually backs up the hype.

Pre-light I got sweet tobacco, cocoa, coffee, and a little cinnamon spice. First third comes in creamy with cocoa/nutty notes and a clean pepper snap. The middle is where the Accomplice Holiday Bauble really shines — caramel/vanilla cream, richer coffee, and the spice stops trying to be the main character. By the final third it turns darker and toastier with more earth and roasted coffee, but it never goes bitter or sloppy.

For a funky shaped cigar, construction is solid. Cut both ends, take your time, and it burns surprisingly straight and steady.

Most AI advice sounds like “just use ChatGPT”, which is way too vague. What actually helps is having tiny, focused tools that do one job extremely well.

Here are 10 mini AI tools I use for real-life work and side projects – each takes 30–60 seconds to use and costs less than a coffee:

**1. AI-Powered Lead Generator**  
Give it your audience, offer and goal, and it suggests specific lead gen angles and assets (lead magnets, outreach angles, hooks) you can ship this week – not “in theory”, but concrete campaigns you can test.

**2. Buyer Journey Audit**  
Drop in your site and get an audit for awareness, consideration and decision stages. It tells you where you’re losing people and gives suggestions for extra pages, proof and CTAs.

**3. Value Positioning Analyzer**  
Paste your offer and a few competitor summaries. It highlights where you sound generic and suggests sharper, more differentiated positioning.

**4. Smart Job Application Assistant**  
Paste a job description and your CV. It helps you reframe your skills, write a tailored letter and align your LinkedIn profile in one workflow.

**5. LinkedIn Post Idea Generator**  
Tell it who you are and who you serve, and it outputs a list of angles and post ideas that actually fit your niche, not generic “hustle” quotes.

**6. Story & Reel Caption Generator**  
You describe the clip in plain language, and it gives you ready-to-post hooks, captions and CTAs tailored to your platform.

**7. Personal Brand Story Coach**  
Answer a few questions, and it helps you structure your story in a way that’s clear, memorable and relevant for your ideal audience.

**8–10. Visual fun & utility tools**  
– Turn yourself into a Pixar, Ghibli, GTA or action-figure style character.  
– Turn any photo into a bold cartoon portrait.  
– Remove unwanted objects/people from photos in seconds.

I bundled all of these into a small “AI for Growth” tool library so you don’t have to glue prompts together yourself. Each tool is built to do one job well and not waste your time.

Recovery is a process. It takes time to regain, reclaim, and recoup all that was lost while we tried on our own to cope with active drinking. Building trust takes time, change takes time, healing old wounds takes time; there are no immediate, ready-made solutions. But the tools and principles of our program—Steps, Traditions, slo-gans, meetings, sponsorship, service-can lead us to the answers that are right for us.

We all have dark times in our lives, but the journey to better times is often what makes us happier, stronger people. When we stop expecting instant relief, we may come to believe that where we are today is exactly where our Higher Power would have us be.

Today's Reminder

Al-Anon is a ""One Day at a Time"" program. No matter what is going on around me, today I know that I am moving forward. I will trust the process of recovery. I'll let time take time.

My partner wouldn’t let me buy one for my two babies for Christmas and I do not like their current one whatsoever. It came with them from their old owner and it’s literally a cat cage. Has small wire shelves rather than a second level and my boy Casper falling off the top, just once, made me want to bawl my eyes out imagining it happening again and him getting hurt when I’m not home or something. Especially internal injuries yk, I would never forgive myself if something preventable happened to them, they’re my first two and won’t be the last. Also the shelf covers are cheap and get ripped off easily, but I haven’t found any others made to fit that one. I’ve done research, it took me 10 years to get them, I think I’m just paranoid because they’re my whole world. I wish I had bought their supplies beforehand so my partner wouldn’t have had a say, but I knew I could still give them a lot better than the situation they were in and I’d rather know they’re safe at least. They’ve been switched to a safe, healthy food, they are almost fully free roam, they are no longer allowed to drink soda and coffee (why they ever were is beyond me!), they’re safe from a dog that wanted them for lunch, and they have a variety of enrichment that gets swapped out, but I know there’s more I can do. 

I’ll attach a better photo of the cage when I can get one, but I think I’ve described it well enough lol. It is huge I will say that, but not in ways I think benefit them, not much room to play or anything. I plan on getting a play pen for them so they can still go in & out of the cage when nobody is home with their dig box and everything in it, but for the most part at least one of us is home so they aren’t in there too much anyways.

the smell while whisking was different. it has a very strong aroma - but not in a bad way. i can't put my finger on the smell, but it changed my experience entirely. 

i first tasted it as usucha, and again i was blown away. i didn't get any of that unpleasant bitterness and chalky texture that jenki was giving me. i took a sip and surprised that i actually liked it. 

next i tried it with milk, and once again i was surprised i didn't need any sweetener to cut the bitterness. the aftertaste was almost sweet, it was smooth and balanced. i personally do not like bitterness (even in coffee, i prefer something fruity and juicy) so this was such a pleasant experience. 

i know some matcha powders/cultivars have bitterness as an intentional tasting note but i feel wako has the perfect balance for my taste. if i liked wako, what should i keep an eye out for next? unfortunately my tin was only 20g so i feel it would run out fairly quickly (and it's difficult to find).

Before I left this morning, I wrote my number down on a slip of paper, wished her a happy new years, handed her the paper, and then said that I'd like to get coffee with her sometime if she was interested. She accepted the paper. I went with this approach because she was a little hungover and I didn't want to put her on the spot right away.

My friend's girlfriend asked me about it later this morning and low-key berated me for doing this. She said it's always best to be masculine and directly ask for her number.

Anyway, for a while, I was a freelancer working on-site for specific projects. The nature of my job meant we were always setting up temporary offices. These were places that were completely empty before our team came in to stay for a few months to finish a specific project, and then we'd pack up our things and leave.

On one particular job, I was part of a team of about 25 people, and we were moving our stuff and equipment to an entire empty floor in an old industrial building. This floor had been closed off and unused for a long time.

As we were setting up the space and getting everything in order, getting the coffee machine running was obviously the first priority, but the second most important thing right after was getting internet access. The building was old, so there wasn't a ready landline we could just activate. Because of that, management decided to get us a few of those small mobile hotspot devices and stick them in various places.

And while they were buying these devices, they had options for different plans at different prices. And of course, the senior managers, in their infinite wisdom, not only passed on the unlimited plan but also chose the cheapest and smallest plan available.

All this to serve an office of 25 people, working more than 9 hours a day, who would be continuing like this for months. Oh, and of course, they conveniently forgot to tell us about this little detail. All we were told was that the Wi-Fi was ready and working.

I don't know exactly what plan they paid for, but all I know is that the internet cut out less than an hour and a half after we all connected.

There was a lot of back-and-forth and many arguments. It got to the point where some of us were trying to explain what 'cloud storage' and 'video calls' meant to a manager who could only see the money. After a lot of drama, they finally gave in and paid for the unlimited plan.

It took them two full days to reach this obvious conclusion.

As I’ve gotten older, I’ve realized just how deeply I relate to the show, especially when it comes to the friendships.

I have a close-knit group of female friends. There are four of us, and our bond feels very SATC-coded in the best way. We meet for coffee once a week in the mornings just to catch up, we have monthly girls’ nights, go to special events together, support each other’s careers, and always have each other’s backs. Most importantly, we have been there for one another during the darkest moments of life.

Two years ago, my life completely shattered. From day one, these women showed up. They made sure I was never alone, created a schedule so someone was always with me, handled phone calls, took care of my house, and helped me feel safe for the first time in a long time. It was unconditional, no questions asked support.

And it goes both ways. I don’t ask if they need help. I just do. They are the same with me. We show up for the big moments and the quiet, hard ones.

I know there are plenty of things in SATC, the movies, and And Just Like That that aren’t realistic. But what is realistic is the portrayal of deep, enduring female friendship. That kind of love, loyalty, and chosen family is very real, and I feel incredibly grateful to have it in my own life.

* I have a projector which I use (as shown in the image).

To celebrate 2026 (and distract myself from X's posts about bikini), I built **WidgetDate**. It’s a minimalistic widget that puts a 365-dot matrix on your home screen. As the year passes, the dots fill up. And then you can cry more how lazy and not productive you are and how you made no progress at all. Like me.

I wanted something that looked good but didn't steal my data, so I made it completely offline.

**What it does:**

* **Year Progress:** Visualizes 2026 as a grid of dots.
* **Daily Reflection:** Tap a widget to rate your day (0-100%) and track habits.
* **Customizable:** 10+ backgrounds, 12+ accents, and adjustable dot shapes to match your wallpaper.
* **Privacy:** 100% offline. No analytics, no cloud. No shit, only good stuff.

I vibe coded this while beeing hungover, a lot of coffee consumed, a tone of Opus tokens spent. So don't expect magic, expect simplicity.

I’m terrible at Irish goodbyes, but I also hate making a big deal out of leaving. So when I decided to head out of a small house party, I figured I’d just slip out quietly.

I grabbed my jacket, moved toward the door, and thought I was home free… until the host suddenly said, very loudly, “WAIT, ARE YOU LEAVING?”

Every conversation stopped. Music paused. Someone said, “Aw, already?”

Now instead of leaving quietly, I had to explain myself. I said I was tired. Someone offered coffee. I said no. Someone asked if everything was okay. I said yes. Someone else said, “You don’t look tired.”

At this point I felt trapped, so I did the only thing my brain could come up with: I said, “I just remembered I left my oven on.”

I do not have anything in my oven.

Everyone immediately told me to leave, very urgently. As I walked out, someone yelled, “Text us when your house doesn’t burn down!”

I drove home and sat in my car for a full minute before going inside, just to commit to the lie.

1q1baf0,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1q1baf0/aitah_for_being_the_only_one_to_cut_off_a_ex/,"AITAH for being the only one to cut off a (ex) friend, in our whole friend group?","I'm 18F and are friends with Niki & Reah (not their real names). We've been friends since 2023, we were classmates in our senior year of highschool. Both of the people I mentioned are female and gay, as many of us are.

Before I start the story, I cannot explain how we are all new in this class. We all came from other schools, our school system is different and with that said, Reah (masc) was my first friend along with 2 other girls. Reah is very sweet, considerate, attractive and overall a green flag type of person. I won't deny that I was attracted to her at first, but I continued to develop a more sisterly love for her. 

I tried to make friends with others and was really new in interacting with them. I simply hated and was dismissive of Niki (fem), I did not like her from the start. I had this gut feeling that she was mean and manipulative. I did not try not make efforts in being friends with her because the more I interacted with her, the more I saw red signs. She was always rude when talking and always had an attitude. She would cry because she felt less with other's achievements. 

I fully understand and sympathize about insecurities, I understand the feeling of bringing myself down. But, yeah... moving forward, I avoided her but others were becoming close to her. My other 2 friends and especially Reah. I felt as if she was taking the only people that supported me. I continued to feel such envy and hatred towards her for a month or 2, until Reah started inviting her to our hangouts and plans of going out. The more Niki & Reah got closer, the more I heard the ""subtle"" flirtatious remarks that hinted they were into eachother.

Fast forward to them being officially a couple. Reah, took the time to personally grab coffee with me and talk about their relationship. She asked me, if I was bothered by their relationship. I obviously replied 'no' and just stated how she felt off to me. How her attitude was always centering only herself, but I reassured Reah to be open in being friends and understanding Niki. She stated that Niki was just misunderstood and that she was kind, sweet, caring and loving. So from then on I came to understand her. I'm no angel and I have an attitude myself, so I just showed her that side of me and as much as we did fight a lot...it actually helped that we were ""mean"" to eachother because we were able to talk through our issues.

More fast forwarding to close to graduation. Niki and I have been arguing more often and unlike before I became stubborn and refused to fully understand her side on any of our school work or projects. Is started venting to my friends about it and how it felt different this time, that she was being too selfish now. But, somehow we work through it and continue to forget about our arguments and be friends until graduation.

Me, Niki & Reah have so much good memories that I've moved past to our petty behaviors..not until last October. Niki & Reah broke up, I was updated with what happened because of Niki. She went to me for advice and updated me on how she felt, this was always the case with their relationship. Reah was my first friend but Niki was the one to run to me and ask for advice (she doesn't really listen). Reah is more reserved and never wants to burden anyone. So, being updated to what happened and Niki feeling sad about the break up even though she broke up with Reah because I CANNOT KID YOU FROM HER WORDS ""I don't see Reah as someone in my future anymore, I wanna have kids"" I told her how being gay is not stopping her to have kids, the can do IVF or something when they are older but idk ... I guess she didn't want that kind of life. So I pursueded her to tell the truth since she's been blowing off Reah and just been avoiding their situation while confiding in all of their common friends.

I waited a few days and I get an update that she can't let go and Reah wanted her back blah blah blah. She says that they will be trying to build themselves for growth and to mature so that they can be together but not in a toxic way, anymore. After a few days they just couldn't work it out and Niki wanted to just ""grow"" on her ""own"".

I don't really know why but I waited so long, I waited a week to start talking to Reah because I knew she wasn't gonna talk. I tried to console her and that it wasn't healthy for her to clingy on to a person that was questioning her commitment to you for a few months now. I assured Reah that it had nothing to do with how she treated her, because we all knew Reah became a freaking slave just to satisfy and love Niki. Even with the internalized homophobia that Niki couldn't resolve.

This is when I slipped up...I wasn't aware that Reah didn't know about Niki talking to another guy during their relationship. I kept consoling her and she kept asking ""What did I do wrong?"", ""Why did she leave?"", ""If she would just tell me why, I think it would make me feel better"" and I jokingly said ""you didn't know?"" because I thought she was just letting it all out, but yeah nope...she was not aware at all about the cheating. 

I caved and told Reah the story of Niki's rants to me, a few months back. How Niki was catching up with guy friend from her childhood that she was starting to like, how she became confused about her feelings for Reah, how she was questioning if she wanted a family or not, and how she was asking for breaks and space with Reah but was actually talking to that guy.

After I told her everything, she wanted to ask Niki herself because she wanted more. She wanted an explanation from Niki....


Niki was pissed at me for being a snitch and how she wasn't ready to tell Reah the truth yet that I ruined everything for her (indicating that she was planning to go back to her), I apologized and said it wasn't right of me but I had to because my friend was suffering too much.

I blocked her on everything after my statement. I didn't hesitate anymore to cut her off and to ruin our friendship. My friend, Reah who was a good person and the kindest of them all out up to all her demands and attitudes... and she's drinking heavily while neglecting her plates and her mental health because NIKI FUCKED UP? I'm sorry but I hated her. I was cheated on multiple times and cheating is just not something I could pass by. Although I feel I do have clarify that the first time Niki was ranting about a guy, I was already urging her to break up with Reah if she wanted to be with a guy and Niki kept saying she'll tell Reah that truth and never did....at that point, I felt Reah too far from reality to even accept this and the fact Niki told me ""I didn't even do anything, we were just talking"" but realizing it now, it was already wrong to be liking other people while in a serious relationship.

So, I've discussed this to our common friends multiple times and it kinda sucks because they kept saying Niki ""micro cheated"" and I was the only person to address it as actually cheating...I feel like everyone was toning it down for themselves like it's not that bad, I've heard remarks of ""I hope they fix their relationship"", while I thought how they should just separate ways.



With all that said and not being able to tell the whole story with every detail... Am I the Ahole for being the only person to actually say that Niki was a bad person and partner, then cutting her off completely from my contacts?",0,1767292492.0,AITAH,2,0.5,False

1q1b5tl,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1q1b5tl,Gigil ako sa isang PH Subreddit na sobrang petty sa mga turista,"Spain yan? Okay, first of all, lokal ako. I grew up here, from birth until I was 20, before moving to another city. I speak the local language. My family and relatives live here, and yes, we have the look, the skin and the hair too.

I get it, sobrang traffic dito. Hindi lang sa sasakyan, pati sa tao. Pero being petty toward tourists or “taga-ibaba” feels misplaced, especially when a lot of people calling themselves “lokal” now actually came from ibaba too.

Most students here ngayon? Galing din ibaba. And while the traffic, both human and vehicle is frustrating, bakit turista ang sinisisi? What is the LGU doing about it?

As for behavior, let’s be real, hindi naman lahat ng lokal maayos, and hindi rin lahat ng tourist kupal. I’ve seen tourists jaywalk, and I call them out. I’ve seen tourists smoke in non-smoking areas, and locals do the same at Sinisita ko rin sila.

The reason I’m sharing this is because of a recent experience. I went back to my hometown to celebrate New Year and called out a group who were vaping and smoking in our family-owned parking business, which is also near a hospital. They were renting for 1 week, and trhree were Pinoy, two were foreigners. I spoke to them in English at first because I thought they were Pinoy who live abroad and were just visiting. Then one of the women replied in Taglish, saying lokal daw sila, that it was a private space, and that they lived just a few streets away.

What they didn’t know was that our neighbor had already been watching them because cigarette bud landed in front of their house, pinitik ni kuyang foreigner yung yosi niya sa harap mismo ng bahay niya. That’s when the police got involved. Before they were taken in, the woman was shouting, “Lokal ako, bakit niyo ako ginaganyan”  in the local language. 

In the end, our neighbor went with the police since they were the one affected. After that, people started talking, turns out may kamag-anak pala sila dito, but they’re not actually lokal. Not an issue, but they’ve just been living here for a while.

I was about to post this on that subreddit, but I noticed something. Posts that are clearly from tourists asking genuine questions get downvoted. Pero kapag lokal language ang ginamit, okay lang, no downvotes.

I’ll probably get downvoted for this too by people who like to “act lokal.” But bakit hindi sa LGU directed yung frustration about traffic? Bakit sa turista? Especially when a lot of visitors are Pinoy too, and not everyone are knowledgeable about what’s happening here, and some don’t have the capacity and resources to know. Sino ka para pigilan sila mag-travel? And sino ka para mag-claim na lokal ka when you’re not even the ""I"" word?",1,1767292194.0,GigilAko,1,1.0,False

A little background: We met on Hinge and our conversations flowed like a river. On chat she was just so interested in me, to talk to me and know more about me. Not only that she was telling about herself too what food she likes, her dream destinations and the cute bond she has with her father. This interaction is a shocker for me because it never happened that 'a girl was asking me' questions on a dating app. Since it's a first date I planned everything and told her we'll have breakfast & watch a movie. 

Now on the D-day, I reached to our meeting spot on my vehicle and saw her sitting near the bench. When we saw each other for the first time she gave a big 😁 and we shook hands. Since we both were hungry we went to a nearby famous dosa place. She was surprised with the place, endukante Masala Dosa was her favourite & I took her there only for that. It was so satisfying seeing her enjoy (or rather devour) her dosa.

Next we went on a stroll in nearby lanes and all the while our conversations were just as exciting as our chats, non-stop. We stopped for a coffee near small shop (I planned this too because she's a coffee lover) and coffee there too was 🤌🏽. Just seeing her enjoy each sip was also 🤌🏽

After that sumptuous breakfast we walked back to the park where I parked my vehicle only for me to reveal the last surprise up my sleeve. I got, her favourite payasam that she mentioned in our chats (Swiggied obviously) and the excitement in her face can't be described in words 🥹

All this while our conversations never stopped, she told me about all her trips, her work, her love for 🐶 & 👶🏽 and I told her about my favourite foods etc., We completely lost sense of time. It was 12PM already 

We then went to the movie wherein the songs were too good 🎵, that I still listen to them.

It was 3PM now and we didn't have our lunch yet. So, we went to a cafe nearby where she said she loves their chocolate croissant. We spent another 1h there where I loved listening to her & also mesmerized to see her enjoy 🥐 


Finally at 4 PM I dropped her near her flat where she leaned in to hug me but my dumb-ass brain made me give her a side hug because I was wearing a helmet 🤦🏽

My realisation after all this: There's something magical in seeing people enjoy food, especially if it's your date/partner. So feed them well.

1q1azxn,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1q1azxn/aita_for_not_wanting_to_pay_for_my_friends/,AITA for not wanting to pay for my friends wedding (bridesmaid edition),"A few months ago, several of us were invited to be bridesmaids in our friend’s destination wedding. We were genuinely excited and happily accepted, not realizing at the time how much of the financial responsibility would fall on us.

The bachelorette party was also out of town. The plane ticket alone cost just under $1,000. On top of that, we paid for our share of the house we stayed in, tickets for all activities, all food costs (including casual takeout like pizza), alcohol (either BYOB or Venmo for alcohol provided), and themed outfits for each night of the trip—including bride-themed accessories for the bride herself. Prior to the trip, we were told the house would be stocked with basics such as coffee, soda, snacks, and breakfast food. When we arrived, it was clear that this had not been done. By the end of the weekend, each of us had spent roughly $2,000 on the bachelorette trip alone.

If the trip had been well planned or enjoyable, the cost may have felt more justified. Unfortunately, it quickly became clear that there was little to no planning involved. We essentially spent $2,000 to travel to another state and do very little. One example: we paid $100 per person to visit a local amusement park, stayed for only three hours, rode a single ride, and then left. Overall, the experience did not come close to matching the money spent.

As we get closer to the wedding, it appears the same pattern is continuing. The wedding itself is also out of town, which comes with additional travel expenses. We were told that hotel rooms had been reserved for guests attending the wedding, but when I went to book a room for two nights, the total was just under $2,000. We were also told that the bride’s mother had “gotten us a room” for the night before the ceremony; later, it came out that the cost of that room would be split among everyone staying there, which would be about $300 per person if all the bridesmaids participate.

There is also confusion surrounding the rehearsal dinner. We have repeatedly been told, “It’s not a real rehearsal dinner—we’re rehearsing and then going out to eat afterward.” This feels like a way of signaling that the dinner will not be hosted or paid for, despite functioning as a rehearsal dinner in every practical sense.

One might assume that these costs are due to the couple investing heavily in the wedding experience for their guests, but that does not seem to be the case. Guests are not allowed a plus one, seemingly to reduce costs, and the bar at the wedding will be beer and wine only, with no liquor.

Additionally, communication and planning have been lacking. The bridesmaids have received little to no information about dresses or color schemes. Details about hair and makeup were not shared proactively, and we had to reach out ourselves to get basic information.

Overall, while we were excited to celebrate our friend.  However, the financial burden, lack of transparency, and poor planning have made the experience stressful and disappointing. It feels as though the bridesmaids are paying for the cost of the wedding rather than the bride, groom and their families.  So are we the assholes?????",5,1767291809.0,AITAH,14,0.78,False

1q1auh7,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1q1auh7/i_63f_am_feeling_repeatedly_excluded_from_my/,I 63F) am feeling repeatedly excluded from my husband’s (62M) family. Looking for clarity and tools to help me cope in a healthier way.,"I’m (63 F)and my husband (62M) have been married for 15 years. We were both newly divorced from long, unhappy marriages when we got together. Our five kids (3 mine, 2 his) were already young adults at the time, ranging from 18 to 28.

We’ve never had a super blended family, mainly because the three older kids were already living on their own working and going to college.

My husband has a large extended family and they’re very close. In the beginning, they were fairly accepting of me, but over time that seems to have changed. I know I’m not for everyone, and I also have social anxiety, especially at all their large family gatherings.

My husband’s ex-wife is still considered part of the family. I’ve always thought that was actually pretty cool, since they have such a long history with her. On my side, both of my parents have passed and I’m an only child, so I’m pretty alone in that sense. My ex-husband’s family is sadly very fractured, and I’m not in touch with any of them beyond the occasional phone call. I’m on good terms with my ex and his new wife, but we don’t socialize.

The issue is that I’m excluded from a lot of things.

For example, my stepson got engaged and my husband never mentioned it to me.  While at a family party I asked my stepson if he and his new GF were considering marriage and he said we got engaged three months ago. Where have you been and she showed me her massive diamond ring, which I  crazily never noticed. When I asked my husband, he said he forgot to tell me.

My stepson’s fiancée is lovely and she loves to entertain. There seems to be some kind of celebration every few weeks—birthdays her kids, my step-grandkids, her parents, etc. my husband also has a cousin who is the same way. I’ve been to more graduations, baby showers, wedding showers weddings for this adjacent family than I have for my own kids.

I try to attend as much as I can, but sometimes I check out. The parties last for hours, there’s a lot of drinking, and the family is very into a particular pro sports team. Almost every weekend there’s a watch party. I enjoy going occasionally, but I get overwhelmed by the drinking, the banter, and constant football talk.

I might add here, my petty feeling is that no one in is this cohort ever asks about my kids, or grandkids. Maybe my husband  shares news about my family but I can’t remember a moment when anyone in his family asked how anyone is doing regarding my family.  I feel like

a non entity.

The most recent thing was that my stepson got a private suite at the local stadium to watch an NFL game. I know that isn’t cheap, and I kind of understand why I wasn’t included since I’m not a super fan. Still, I’ve been to plenty of games and I enjoy the experience. The outing lasted from 11:00 a.m. to 9:00 p.m. and included pregaming and cocktails afterward. My husband is four years sober and was the designated driver.

The group was my stepson, his fiancée, my stepdaughter, her boyfriend, my husband, and his ex-wife. Okay. I get it. The ex-wife is a die-hard fan, and my stepson’s wanted his mom and dad there.

I told my husband that I felt excluded again, but also said I understand that this is just how the family dynamic works. Husband just said sorry my feelings were hurt.

Then Christmas came and went. I spent it with my kids, while he went to his son’s house with their big family. When he came home, he started showing me all the gifts his kids gave him—an expensive sweater, shoes, clothes, tools. One of the gifts was a picture calendar, with the cover featuring the pregame photo of the husband, ex-wife, two kids and their partners at the NFL game. To be fair, I did make the cut in one of the monthly photos—a picture of me and my husband from our wedding—which was thoughtful.

My husband also handed me my the gift from his kids, a coffee mug that says “Cat Mom.” It’s nice, I guess. Who doesn’t love a good mug? We share a cat but I’m really not a cat person although his kids don’t really know me well enough to know that.

I know this is long, and I know I’m probably too damn old to be feeling hurt, annoyed, and petty—but here I am.

This is an ongoing issue, and I don’t really want to talk to my husband about it anymore. There’s nothing he can realistically do. He can’t control his kids or force them to acknowledge my existence.  No one is being cruel to me or anything, I just feel like I’m an adjacent entity.

I’m really looking for some clarity, validation, and maybe a healthier way to approach this for my own mental health. Thanks and wishing people a happy healthy 2026

\*\*TL;DR\*\*  I am feeling excluded from my husband’s family, and I just would like some clarity and tools to help me cope in a healthier way. .",7,1767291452.0,relationships,7,0.69,False
