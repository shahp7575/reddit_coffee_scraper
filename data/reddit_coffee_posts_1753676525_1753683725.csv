## Key Features Analysis

Black Mountain Coffee distinguishes itself through several key features, each contributing to its overall quality and appeal.

**Single-Origin Sourcing:** Black Mountain Coffee prides itself on sourcing beans exclusively from single-origin farms.

This means that each batch of coffee comes from a specific geographic location, allowing for a distinct and consistent flavor profile that reflects the unique terroir of that region. By focusing on single-origin beans, Black Mountain Coffee ensures a level of quality and traceability that is often lacking in blended coffees.

**High-Altitude Cultivation:** The beans are grown at altitudes exceeding 4,000 feet.

High-altitude cultivation is crucial for coffee quality because it allows the beans to develop more slowly, resulting in a denser bean with a more complex flavor. The cooler temperatures and greater diurnal temperature variations at these elevations contribute to a higher concentration of sugars and acids within the coffee cherry, which translates to a richer and more balanced cup of coffee.

**Artisanal Roasting Process:** Black Mountain Coffee employs a meticulous artisanal roasting process.

This process involves small-batch roasting, where the roasters carefully monitor and adjust the roasting parameters to bring out the optimal flavor characteristics of each bean. This hands-on approach ensures that the coffee is roasted to perfection, avoiding the over-roasting or under-roasting that can compromise the flavor.

**Sustainable Farming Practices:** Black Mountain Coffee is committed to sustainable farming practices.

This commitment includes supporting farmers who use environmentally friendly methods, such as organic farming and water conservation techniques. By prioritizing sustainability, Black Mountain Coffee not only ensures the long-term health of the coffee-growing regions but also provides consumers with a product that aligns with their values.

Key features of Black Mountain Coffee include:
    * Single-origin sourcing
    * High-altitude cultivation
    * Artisanal roasting process
    * Sustainable farming practices

## Core Benefits

Black Mountain Coffee offers several core benefits that enhance the overall coffee-drinking experience.

**Exceptional Flavor Profile:** Black Mountain Coffee delivers a complex and nuanced flavor profile.

The single-origin sourcing and high-altitude cultivation contribute to a range of flavors, from bright and fruity to rich and chocolatey, depending on the specific bean variety and region. This allows coffee lovers to explore a diverse array of tastes and aromas, providing a more engaging and satisfying coffee experience.

**Enhanced Aroma:** The coffee boasts a captivating and inviting aroma.

The artisanal roasting process helps to unlock the full potential of the beans, resulting in a fragrant aroma that fills the room and awakens the senses. This enhanced aroma adds to the overall sensory experience, making each cup of Black Mountain Coffee a truly enjoyable ritual.

**Smooth and Balanced Acidity:** Black Mountain Coffee provides a smooth and balanced acidity.

Unlike some coffees that can be overly acidic and harsh on the stomach, Black Mountain Coffee is carefully roasted to minimize acidity while preserving the bright and vibrant flavors. This results in a smooth and easy-to-drink coffee that can be enjoyed by even those with sensitive stomachs.

**Ethical and Sustainable Consumption:** Choosing Black Mountain Coffee supports ethical and sustainable consumption.

The brand's commitment to sustainable farming practices ensures that the coffee is produced in a way that is environmentally responsible and socially just. This allows consumers to enjoy their coffee knowing that they are supporting a company that values people and the planet.

1mb8mbb,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1mb8mbb/how_can_you_fix_resentment_26f29m/,How can you fix resentment? 26F/29M,"26F — I think my 29M boyfriend resents me. I love him, but I feel like I’m walking on eggshells. Can this be fixed? Sorry if it’s long. Trying to figure out solutions if that’s even possible m.

We’ve been together just over 2 years. It started fast and intense — he moved closer after 2.5 months, and we were living together full-time by month 4. In the beginning, he was sweet — flowers, dates, surprise coffees. Now I feel like he resents me. Everything I do seems to set him off. It’s only been like this the last 1-2 months

We live together with our two big dogs — one of them, his dog, is wild despite $2K in training. Many of our fights now revolve around the dog, chores, or me not doing things exactly the way he wants.

Some examples: •	Dog/Breakfast Incident: I ran out for 5 minutes to pick up pre-ordered bagels. His dog peed on my shoe and pooped inside. I had just taken him out ~30 minutes prior, and thought I could skip the crate just briefly. I admitted I was wrong, cleaned it up, but my boyfriend screamed at me for 20+ minutes, slammed his fist on the table, and said I was “pushing his limits.” I froze and started shaking. Not because he’s ever hit me — he hasn’t — but because of trauma from past abuse. My brain kept whispering, “Please don’t hit me.” •	Shock Collar: I took the dog out before bed (quick bathroom trip) without his shock collar. He wasn’t pulling — just not heeling perfectly. My boyfriend yelled at me again, saying I “never follow through” and that I don’t listen. •	Today’s Drive: He came with me for coffee, then said he wanted to grab lunch. As we got near a main road, I suggested turning left toward a bunch of lunch spots. He exploded, saying I “don’t listen,” that I’m “narcissistic,” that I “never apologize,” and berated me for almost 40 minutes. Later he asked if I wanted food — like the fight didn’t just happen.

The pattern:

He holds onto every mistake — even ones I fix or apologize for. I try hard to listen. I validate his concerns, I adjust, I try to learn. But I’m tired. I feel like I’m constantly doing things wrong. Even small missteps feel huge in his eyes. He says I talk too much, don’t make sense, or act defensive when I try to explain myself. So I say less. I shut down.

I’ve started slipping — pushing chores to the next day, skipping vacuuming, laundry folded but not put away. I feel paralyzed. He wants a clean house and more effort, and I do want to contribute — but I’m stuck in this cycle of trying, failing, being yelled at, and shutting down further.

I love him. I want to fix things. But I feel lost. Is this just resentment? Is there a way to rebuild trust and peace? Or am I too far gone in this relationship?

Has anyone actually come back from a place like this?

TL;DR Summary : In the last 2 months my boyfriend started criticising everything I do. I love him and want to fix things. Is that possible? I am able to take more accountability ",3,1753683325.0,relationships,0,1.0,False

1mb8lq2,https://www.reddit.com/r/utis/comments/1mb8lq2/utis_are_destroying_me_mentally/,UTIs are destroying me mentally,"Hello everyone, unfortunately as of now I am sitting on the bathroom seat for the past 2 and a half hours in agony, it is slowly passing due to my immediate action of drinking so much water I wanted to throw up from it and then having an espresso to get the kidneys working. I have to admit that I admire everyone who has problems with UTIs as I do, as they are a damn curse.

Sometimes, my feet get cold, and I'll get it. I swear my feet being cold does it sometimes for me. And then I wake up at 5.30 with the urge to go and a raging pain in my urinary tract. The illness by itself is degrading to the patient in many ways. First of all, the torture of the ""full bladder/tract"" for only a drop of urine to leave your body, and not just that, but the sting of it like razors and hotness like a flame. The constant pain is driving me insane. It doesn't stop, it doesn't slow down, it just hits you until you are mentally so tired that you just cry in the bathroom(or maybe you don't, but I do sometimes when it lasts for hours, mental fatigue is real.)

Therefore I want to share something that works for me when I catch even the smallest feeling that a UTI might be forming. Drink water like you haven't had a sip in 2 days. Like seriously, you want to feel it move around int your stomach when you move. Then, have an espresso to make your bladder fill up faster. While you are waiting for your bladder to actually fill up; curl into any position that helps with a heavy duty blanket used for fucking adult elephants and tie it around your waist and wait. Wait for 30 minutes. We want our bladder to a fill up. Then, go pee. A substantial amount will come out due to the coffee, and you WILL feel relief. Then do it again. I usually do it 3 times, then stock up on D mannose and pray to Jesus Christ almighty and his glory that you are saved. Seriously. I hope one person might find this actually helpful. By the time I've written this post it has stopped. Blessings to you all and good luck.",1,1753683263.0,utis,0,1.0,False

The shift was less a teleportation and more a violent wrenching, a cosmic hand twisting reality until it snapped. One moment, the roar of Ulduar's XT-002 Deconstructor filled their ears, the next, it was replaced by the cacophony of a Singaporean alleyway. Hana and Zackrawrr landed awkwardly, a heap of bewildered limbs and racing hearts. The humid air immediately clung to their skin, thick and unfamiliar, smelling of spices, exhaust, and something unsettlingly clean. Their WoW avatars, the god-like power, the epic gear – all gone. They were just... them. In regular clothes, thank god, though Hana noted with a grimace that her simple blouse felt strangely rough against her skin, and Zackrawrr’s t-shirt was already damp.

""What… in the actual fuck?"" Zackrawrr muttered, pushing himself up, his eyes wide with a mixture of terror and a strange, almost manic amusement. He looked at his hands, expecting to see his character model's chiseled features, but found only his own, flesh-and-blood palms. Hana, ever the pragmatist, was already scanning their surroundings. No UI, no quest log, no familiar zone map. Just concrete, overflowing dumpsters, and the distant, overwhelming hum of a truly *alive* city.

The immediate challenges hit like physical blows. ""We don't have currency,"" Hana stated, her voice flat, the concept of needing physical money baffling her 2075-trained mind. ""No identification. No comms."" Zackrawrr patted his pockets reflexively, then scoffed. ""No phones? What is this, 2010?"" The reality was worse than that. Every attempt to engage with a turnstile, to decipher a public transport map, or simply to understand a hawker stall menu became a miniature crisis. His gamer instincts, honed by countless repetitions, were useless here. The simple act of ordering a coffee involved a dance of pointing and confused murmurs, ending with a half-filled plastic cup that tasted nothing like the perfectly optimized buffs he was used to. Hana, used to instant data streams and seamless information retrieval, felt a crushing weight of ignorance. She tried to ""ping"" a local network with a thought, a reflex from her home timeline, and a nearby public digital screen, advertising some irrelevant movie, **flickered violently**, showing a fleeting, garbled stream of unrecognizable future code before snapping back to a perfect, innocuous ad. It was subtle, barely a blink, but they both saw it. A tiny, unsettling **""quantum hiccup.""**

The first few days blurred into a desperate scramble. Hunger was a real, gnawing sensation, unlike any debuff they’d experienced. They scavenged discarded food, accepting a small, pitying portion of rice and chicken from a kind hawker, exchanging nothing but bewildered gratitude. Nights were spent trying to find inconspicuous corners in public parks, the humid air thick with unseen insects, the distant city lights a constant, mocking reminder of a world they didn't belong to. The sheer, overwhelming *normalcy* of it all was terrifying. It wasn't the fiery destruction of the Void Lord, but a quiet, insidious apocalypse of the mundane.

""Are we just… stuck here?"" Zackrawrr whispered one night, huddled close to Hana on a park bench, the fear in his voice raw and unconcealed. Hana looked at the sprawling city, a world teeming with billions who had no idea of the loops, the resets, the cosmic prisons they had just escaped. She felt a profound loneliness that transcended her scientific detachment. ""For now,"" she conceded, her voice barely a breath. ""We have to survive."" He shivered, and she, instinctively, pulled her arm closer around him, offering a fragile warmth against the damp night air. In the silent understanding that passed between them, born from mutual exhaustion and shared, impossible secrets, they realized, with a quiet, undeniable clarity, that in this strange, terrifying new world, they truly had no one else but each other. The faint thrum of Hana's inert shard against her skin was a constant, unsettling reminder of their broken reality, but in that shared vulnerability, it almost felt like a heartbeat.",1,1753683150.0,HarmonicTsukuyomi,0,1.0,False
1mb8kkn,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmIOverreacting/comments/1mb8kkn/aio_for_ending_a_friendship_because_he_didnt_tell/,AIO for ending a friendship because he didn’t tell his partner about me?,"TL;DR - my (37nb) friend/ex (56m) didn’t tell his partner of 7 years that we were close friends, now he won’t spend time with me because it might destabilize their relationship. 

My friend and I had a sexual relationship 10 years ago. It didn’t end well—he was in a DADT thing with his then partner and I felt like a dirty secret. We’ve been able to rebuild some trust and closeness over the years. He now lives in a different country. 

I told him last year that it was important that I meet his friends. This was a hugely painful issue while we were sleeping together and it’s remained important to me. He agreed, and I planned a trip to see him. 

I met his partner and things seemed to go well at first. But later I found out they had a huge fight about me because while she knew we had slept together in the past, she didn’t know that we were close friends. The fight was near relationship-ending (sounds like he’d kept important information from her in the past and this was a final straw).

He basically stopped hanging out with me during the trip. That was very painful but I eventually worked through it. I figured it was an unexpected situation so I tried to give him grace about how he handled it. Eventually I told him that if I visited again, he’d need to make time for me—like intentional, planned time (e.g., dinner) and not just brief coffee hangouts. I said it’s totally fine with me if his partner joins us if she wants. 

He said he couldn’t commit to that because it would require reopening the conversation with his partner about what happened and that might destabilize their relationship. For me, I can’t imagine being friends (supposedly close) with someone and not be able to get dinner or go to a show with them if I fly thousands of miles to see them. He seemed surprised, hurt, and angry that I would end our relationship over this. 

I’m honestly just super confused and hurt. Is there a different way to handle this situation?

I remember seeing someone here in r/RunningWithDogs asking “How do you correctly wear a hands free dog leash” and that question stuck with me. Coincidentally, I came across a quick post over on r/PawCulture that briefly touched on this same question. It caught my attention because I’ve been thinking about the same thing myself. I came across a blog the other day that I think might actually help answer [this](https://petsflow.net/the-best-way-to-wear-a-hands-free-dog-leash-for-safe-effective-walks/). It talks about how leash placement actually matters (like keeping it off-center can help with control), why waist vs. crossbody setups feel different, and how your dog’s pulling habits should influence how you wear it. It also covers small stuff—like where the bungee section sits can really change how much shock you feel. 

It breaks down leash placement, how to adjust based on your dog’s pulling habits, and offers some useful tips for getting the fit just right. Personally, I like wearing mine slightly off-center toward my dominant side, and I always make sure the bungee section sits in a spot where it absorbs the tug instead of pulling directly at my waist. That little adjustment made walks feel a lot smoother.

Really curious how others approach this. Do you prefer it around the waist or crossbody? Any favorite harness setups or things you’ve learned the hard way? Thanks.",3,1753682900.0,RunningWithDogs,0,1.0,False

Everyone around me seems willing to tell me what I SHOULD remember, but I can't help but feel like they are leaving out something VERY significant.""","The Missing Piece Kale forcefully pushed me away from him with both hands. I hadn't felt a push like that since my football days, and I was in pads then. With a wild, confused look in his eyes, Kale yelled out, ""what the actual fuck man?!""

Panic engulfed my body. Why wasn't this okay? Why wasn't he a more willing recipient of my kiss? Was I now in danger?

I quickly let myself out of the truck and ran to the bathroom. The nearest room with a locked door. I sat myself on top of the closed toilet and attempted to regulate my now very labored breathing. This is NOT what I predicted would happen while journaling. I was crushing on Kale, right? He was crushing on me? This is why we had such a bond. This is why it broke my heart that he had interests outside of me. This is why my heart fluttered when I knew I was going to see him. This is why I thought of him when my mom read to me ""Love is patient, love is kind""...right? RIGHT?! 

I sat there in that bathroom for what seemed like an eternity and jumped enough to make the plastic toilet seat squeek once I heard knocking. 

""Rye...you blowin it up in there?"" It was Kale. I said nothing...I guess hoping he would think I wasn't actually in the bathroom if I didn't respond?

""I know you're in there man. It's okay. You and I have been closer than a kiss before. Hell, you know what my left testicle looks like."" 

""I'm..I'm good"" were all the words I could manage to mutter. 

By that time though, Kale had used a key and let himself into the bathroom. I was mortified. I couldn't even look at his face. 

""Rye, seriously dude, it's not a big deal, I just need to know what's going on with you. Like was that a prank, because if it was, you really got me."" 

My eyes still staring at the concercingly unclean tile floor, I replied, ""it wasn't a prank. I think I'm in love with you Kale"". 

Kale bellowed a deep, bronchial laugh. Chuckling that felt somehow offensive. ""Like romantically in love with me?"" he asked. 

""Well, yeah"" I stated, finally making eye contact with him. 

He tilted his head like an obedient pup and pressed his lips into a seam, ""Bro, trust and believe you're into chicks... not dicks"". 

I burst into tears...admittedly not my finest moment...but at that moment, when Kale said I wasn't into dicks, my whole world shattered. Since coming home from the hospital it felt like a huge part of my life was missing. I found singing and thought that was it, but there was still a void. I rediscovered my friendship with Kale and thought that was it, but no...still a void. So during the past several days I had decided that I was gay and gay with Kale and that was the missing piece. Even though my interactions with Kale never caused me feelings in my...no no areas...and even though Kale was now emphatically assuring me that I was not a homosexual man, I still sort of wanted to be, because I wanted to know what the missing part of me was. 

Kale and I sat in that bathroom in desperate need of a deep clean (although even just a light dusting would have helped tremendously) and talked about the things that had led me to my now ""comical"" conclusion about my sexuality. Kale explained to me that he and I did love each other very much, but as best friends and as ""basically brothers"". He also informed me that ""reality tv shows"" are not a great way to measure and determine one's feelings. And he provided me with several examples from our past when I proved, time and time again, that I was sexually attracted to women. 

When I asked Kale why I was jealous of his relationship with Carlos, he hypothesized that it was because I was emotionally 13 and at 13 it's tough to share a best friend. He also admitted that he had lied to me about what was going on between him and Carlos and explained that Carlos was doing an ""off the books, off the clock"" investigation of a local rancher's use of anhydrous. Being a local farmer, Kale was the closest that Carlos could get to an ""inside man"". 

That night we had a bon fire and some hard liquor, it had been a challenging day for both Kale and me. We invited Carlos too since his patrol that day hadn't ended favorably. By the time Carlos arrived, I was pretty good and liquored up. Just to mess with him I started my greeting by saying, ""I know what you and Kale are up to man"". The look of terror that encompassed his face was too much for me to handle. I cracked up and with laughing tears said, ""I'm just messin with you man. All I know is that you and Kale are tryna keep our community safe from meth and I appreciate that"". I then engaged him in a half hug half crutch situation before stumbling back to my place around the fire. I don't remember much else after that. I suppose not drinking hard stuff since before the coma had it's effect on me, because I passed out pretty early that night. 

The next morning I woke up to Kale offering me very crispy bacon and Carlos already being gone. Kale drank his black coffee and I sipped on some hot cocoa as he told me more about Carlos' ""unofficial"" anhydrous case investigation. 

""Like I told you yesterday, you need anhydrous to make meth. People with livestock, ranchers, can legally purchase anhydrous. The more land they own the more anhydrous they are allowed to buy since the assumption is that the land is for the livestock."" He took a slow sip of his coffee, seeming to use it as a way to cope with the information he was sharing with me. ""Merl Hutchinson's got a lot of land, a lot of anhydrous, but not a lot of livestock."" By this point he had a rather distinct sparkle in his eye, indicating that he was ""gettin to the good part""...but my mind was 13 years old and it didn't care about anhydrous or meth or anything that didn't affect me directly.

Shaking my head in response in efforts to display hopeful interest, I quickly stated during his next dramatic sip of coffee, ""So, if you and I aren't gay for each other why didn't you ever marry Sara Walton?"" 

His reply was simply a look of confusion.

""You were like totally obsessed with her from first grade until...well, at least 8th grade.""

Still perplexed, Kale said, ""Yes, I did admire her, but she was always closer to you than she was to me"". 

That morning ended with an unfortunate taste of burnt bacon in my mouth and an extended nap. I hurried to my journal once I finally regained my independence from what I was assuming was a hangover, and diligently reported my new ""hypothesis"" regarding my ""missing piece"".

1mb8dna,https://www.reddit.com/r/WhatShouldIDo/comments/1mb8dna/potential_stalker/,Potential stalker?,"My girlfriend earlier today mentioned how recently she’s been running into a man more than usual such as seeing him at the gas station only to talk to an employee and not get gas, see him fill up his water jug on the street as the only day she happened to walk home from work that day, and as well at the drive thru at work. 

There was once where we were both together and coincidentally ran into this guy on the road and he started speeding away as if we were following him but I didn’t think much of it.

But earlier today we were at a coffee shop and as we’re in line she tells me “omg i think it’s him “ and as I turn I see the car going down into a street and I jokingly said we’ll go down there when we leave. So 20 minutes go by and we drive to the street and as I turn the corner to come down the street I see a car coming up thinking nothing much of it, my girlfriend tells me “ it’s him right there” so I then I turn my car around immediately and onto the main road. We are one car behind and I see he is turning left so I turn left as well but there is still a car ahead of me. We then crossed the intersection and the next light he takes a U turn and as he’s taking the U turn slowly, we stare at each other dead in the eye as of he knows I’m onto him so I decide to just take a left and drop it. I begin to decide that its now enough for me to start believing my girlfriend that maybe he is stalking her. There was also a female in the passenger seat just as it was the first time I ran into him but she’s always looking straight ahead and never around. He also has Illinois plates but we’re in cali. 

Idk whether to think if he is just a civilian who happens to be going out the same time my girlfriend does and she sees him or maybe something is up and should be on our toes. What do y’all think?

Everyone around me seems willing to tell me what I SHOULD remember, but I can't help but feel like they are leaving out something VERY significant.""","New Feelings
From what I last recalled (circa 8th grade), Kale's dad had died when we were super young....an accident involving a tractor. Kale lived with his mom, and pretty much started running the family farm as soon as he was old enough. I helped, although I wasn't very good at it. I just did whatever Kale told me and taught me to do. I distinctly recall that I did not enjoy working on the farm, but I did it because he was my best friend. 

Surprisingly and apparently, working on the farm with Kale is what I decided to do full time as an adult, and that's what I was ""going back to work"" to do today. 

My brain involuntarily flooded with memories of pulling calves from heifers' vaginas, shooting coyotes and mounting their heads on fence posts, and picking which hogs were ready for the slaughter. While Kale was represented favorably in each of these memories, the events themselves were not. Why the heck had I decided to do this as a career???

I realize my last memories are as a 13 year old boy, but I always thought I would do something...grand...or, at the very least, different? Farm work with Kale was not something I enjoyed at all. Maybe things had become tough for him when we graduated high school, I kept helping out, and 20 years later here we are? Running the farm like a middle aged married couple? 

Whatever the case, this is the life I woke up to today, and I was glad to be with Kale. By the way he acted toward me,  you would have thought he hadn't seen me in 37 years rather than just 37 days.

Contrary to my assumptions, he hadn't married Sarah Walton (his infatuation since 1st grade). In fact, he hadn't married at all. Also, he was running the farm entirely on his own now because his mom had gotten sick and was in ""a home"". 

He had turned the farm into a highly profitable business by becoming the primary pork and beef supplier in our county and our surrounding counties, but he seemed so lonely. As arrogant as it seems, realizing this made me feel important. Like Kale needed me in some way. This day is the first time I felt grateful since being back home from the hospital. 

I still didn't really understand or trust the internet at this point, so I had been keeping a journal. That first week of being with Kale my journal was full and gushing.  Every morning I woke up excited and every night I went to sleep excited, knowing my days were going to be spent with Kale. 

We didn't do a lot of, what I considered, work. Kale had several hired hands now who took care of the day to day chores on the farm. Between driving the parameter of the farm, jawing with employees, and Kale responding to business calls while I listened, we did about 2 hours of ""work"" each day. The rest of the day we played Playstation, made Vines, and drank beer (which I was old enough to drink now!).  On Wednesdays, Kale would take me home early and then go visit his mom. But I got to see him just a few hours later since he taught a youth boys' class at  church. 

I felt like Kale and I talked about everything and nothing. I remember telling my journal that Kale was the person I knew the best and the least. I tried asking him about his dad's accident once. This is the first time I ever witnessed him being serious. It was only for a moment and ended when he said, ""I don't talk about it"". Kale was pretty good about catching me up on everything my brain had deleted, so, naturally, I asked about his mom. I knew she wasn't much older than my mom, if she was older at all, and, yet, she required 'round the clock care. Something had to be wrong with her, right? My mom was still the church treasurer, still worked M-F at the bank, and, now, took care of me. She was definitely not the definition of a nursing home patient. Kale was as closed mouth about his mom's condition as he was about his dad's death. I cared about him too much to press either issue further, and just left it alone. It was sort of frustrating that Kale was such a question mark but didn't have to be, while I was a question mark and had to be. 

This one day, for example, I was sittin in the truck, feet up on the dash, relaxing, waiting for Kale to relieve himself behind a nearby, not nearly broad enough tree, and I heard his cell phone ring. Kale had taught me how to answer it and told me to take the call if it came from Buck Whitely...a rancher Kale had been trying to buy several head of Angus from that day. At that time I was still very clumsy with a cell phone, so as soon as it started playing Rockstar by Nickel Back, I hit the green call button and pressed it to my ear, not bothering or remembering to look at the caller ID. 

""Yellow"" I said jokingly giving my best Kale Rogers impression. 

""Can you be free at 6?"" the heavily accented voice on the other end said to me. 

I sat caught off guard and frozen for a minute, and then the voice said, ""Hola. Kale. Are you there?""

""Ummmm...no. This is Ryan. Sorry Kale is taking a leak and I thought you were Buck Whit...""

The voice cut me off with seemingly nervous laughter, ""Oh no problem amigo. This is officer Gonzales. Could you just have Kale text me when he is available?"" 

""Uh, yeah, sure thing man. Sorry about that again, I'm still trying to figure out how to use these things."" 

The voice continued the same sort of forced laughter and said, ""No worries. Adios."" And hung up.

Kale approached me as I was stumbling to hang up the phone on my end and asked if I was just talking to Buck Whitely. 

I explained, that no, even though that's who I expected was calling when I answered, it was actually Carlos or ""Officer Gonzales"". Kale's eyes widened once he heard the caller's name. He looked at me concerned and nearly demanded to know what Carlos wanted. 

I shrugged my shoulders to indicate how melodramatic the conversation was, hoping to calm this increasingly hot and bothered Kale down and said, ""Not much, just wants you to send him a text when you can"". 

Kale exhaled with what seemed to be breath of relief and muttered something about yeah he ""might"" text him later. Then I remembered how strange it was that Carlos called wanting to know if Kale could be free at 6 when today was Wednesday – the day that Kale goes from work, to visiting his mom, then straight to church. No way he could be available at 6p. That would be right during his route between dropping me off at home and going to see his mom. So I mentioned it. 

""It was weird though because he was asking if you were free tonight around 6. He must not know you very well"" I said laughingly as I realized I was now jealous of Carlos. So jealous that I was patronizing his lack of knowledge about Kale's Wednesday schedule. 

Kale replied, ""yeah he must have been confused. We play cards on Thursdays at 6 sometimes, must've been what he was talking about. Just forgot what day it was.""

I felt my heart sink, much like it did when Katie Presley refused the couple skate with me on the 3rd grade field trip. At that moment I realized two things. One, Kale might have a life outside of me. Two, Kale wasn't being honest with me. 

You see, I know Kale Rogers. I know that he mumbles out loud when he reads to himself. I know that he snores when he sleeps on his left side. I even know that he has a freckle on his left testicle. And I know that Kale Rogers gets red and splotchy all over his neck when he lies. When Kale looked at me and told me that he ""sometimes"" play cards with Carlos on Thursdays, he looked like he had just washed his throat with sand paper. Kale Rogers was my best, and only, friend, and he was lying to me. 

I didn't confront him about it that day. I skipped church that night due to not wanting to face Kale yet. Instead, I stayed home and reflected about it in my journal. Why was I so hurt by the events that had occurred that day? Why did it bother me that Kale may have interests other than me? Why did I expect to know everything about Kale's life? And what could Kale and ""Officer Gonzales"" (I said his name condescendingly inside my head that night several times) possibly be up to that I couldn't know about. I had two more days of work left for that week but opted for asking my mom to tell Kale I wasn't feeling well enough to come in and that I didn't want to get him sick. That was a lie. Well, sort of. Physically, I felt fine, but emotionally I felt crushed. Like someone had dropped my heart from a 32 floor building and then stomped and spit on the pieces. 

I spent the next 3 days in bed eating cheese melted on chips and watching any show that ended in ""Real House Wives"", even turning the tv volume up loud enough so as not to have to pause the show during trips to the bathroom. By Saturday morning, I guess my mom could tell something was up. I'm certain she could tell before that, but respectfully tried to give me time to sort things out myself. Apparently, seeing me almost comatose again for nearly 72 hours was enough to push her into intervening. She brought me a cup of hot cocoa in bed that morning (she had finally realized my passive distaste for black coffee) and read to me the passage 1 Corinthians 13. I hugged her and cried...uncontrollably. The scripture had helped me realize several things and brought my broken heart some much needed reprieve. 

I woke up the following Monday morning, ripping, roaring and ready to work. I remember being almost giddy to see Kale that morning, wishing I had the strength to scoop him up and cradle him like he did me that first morning of work after my coma. The ride to work was euphoric. We listened to old country and shouted the lyrics we knew. Once we got to the farm, Kale put the truck in park and turned off the ignition. No more music. Just me, him, and the sounds of farm life. He turned and looked directly at me and said, ""Man I'm so glad you're back to work. Not gonna lie, them two days you were sick reminded me of when you were gone before and it put me in a real bad spot... ya know...emotionally"". 

I looked at him endearingly and shook my head to confirm that I knew exactly what he meant, and then, I leaned my body in toward his and put my lips on top of his.

We instantly connected and for a long time I saw her as one of the only people I could be fully myself around. 

Some background: we both grew up in an incredibly conservative christian community. And as I went to get a degree in theology we stayed in touch and would hang out here and there. 

We’re both neurodivergent so our friendship would drop off a clip and then jump back on with months in between. that was not uncommon. 

However, last month I invited her to come read with me at a coffee shop. All was good and dandy. But then we ended up spending every single day together for the next week. In this time we both came out to each other and really bonded over the fact that there’s no one to talk to about queer identity and pride and such. so it was a nice week. 

 i started working a few towns over in a very safe queer coffee shop that i absolutely love. it has brought me out of my shell. everything has been so so good. So, i brought her to this place to see how great it was. 

And that’s when it all started to go downhill. Si would send me 10-20 memes and videos about queer things every single day. (like fine haha silly but there HAS to be something else on your feed girl) And then she began asking for my work schedule every week. (granted my work is a 40min drive for her) she asked for my find my location. and has started to ft and call me MULTIPLE times a day. all of these calls i have stopped answering and have started to be as dry as possible. 

Si started to show up at the end of my shift regularly expecting to hang out when i had errands to run or just want to go home after a long damn shift. 

and at one point kind of out of no where she goes “you know if you ever want to have your first kiss i’d be happy to” 🙂 GIRL WTF 
i feel it is necessary to say i have never had feelings for this girl. 

SO at this point im starting to tell my coworkers what’s going on bcus im starting to feel uncomfy. and my backing away is doing NOTHING. 

Si has done a total 180 in personality and i have no idea who she is anymore. 

last week i had finally said “yo please tell me if you’re gonna come in”. and guess who came into the cafe without saying anything but i had gotten off early 🫢 
THIS GURL had the AUDACITY to ask for an APPLICATION AT MY FURKING JOB WITHOUT ASKING/SAYING ANYTHING TO ME. 
but that’s not all. 
SHE WENT UNDER A DIFFERENT FURKING NAME THAN I KNOW HER AS WTF WHO DOES THAT. !!!!

it’s been 4 days and she hasn’t told me. but i guess i also haven’t answered any calls lol so probs on me. 

im just loosing my mind bcus i really don’t know how to cut her off, set this boundary, or if its just me making things better than it needs to be….

I work night shifts as that's when I am my most productive. I also only work Tuesday-Thrusday. When I struggle with sleeping on my off nights, I tend to catch up on housework. My children (4) sleep through my cleaning and my wife only gets woken up if I do laundry, so I wait until 6am to start a load. That's the normal time when most of family is awake minus our teenager who sleeps like the dead. 



My wife is constantly on my case about how I don't help with raising the children. I pointed out that I help during majority of the day on my off nights. I mostly care for the youngest two since they are daycare age and only go for half a day. The oldest are busy with school and after school activities that I catch up with them over dinner. They are typical teenagers and would rather be left alone. 



We don't need the money from a regular 9-5 type job. I earn enough to pay all the bills and my wife earns enough to life enrichment. I can understand that she gets overwhelmed with work and rasing children. I offered to hire a nanny for the youngest two. I refuse to have my older children raise their siblings. My wife declined my offer. She is afraid of letting a stranger raise our children. I asked her why she didn't feel the same about daycare. For half a day strangers are looking out for the youngest. She told me it was necessary since we both worked. We got into an argument. I told her I was hiring a nanny, which I did. I rather not give up a routine that works for me. 




My wife called me an AH for refusing to support our family and for going behind her back on hiring a nanny. She also pointed out that I hired a ""predator"" because the nanny I hired is a man.

I’ve been a silent observer in this community, along with all the related threads like PFD, PN, and others, for over a year. I promised myself that if I ever managed to recover, I’d return to share my journey as a token of gratitude for everyone who has supported and helped me along the way.

Recently, I’ve been busy and realized I should have shared this two months ago—especially when I was about 99% recovered. This will be a long post because I want to detail everything I experienced so fellow sufferers can get a clearer picture. I’ve tried everything mentioned in these threads, though I can’t say what specifically worked and what didn’t—what I do know is that given time, healing tends to come.

**A Little Backstory**

I’m a 35-year-old male. When I was a teenager, I had a severe bout of UTI. Doctors confirmed blood in my urine, and urination was excruciating—like needles stabbing through my urethra. The pain lasted at least two weeks, during which I could barely function. Once the intense symptoms subsided, I was left with mild symptoms that lingered for at least three years. I thought this would be my forever.

In my 20s, without much thought, I returned to normal. However, at 26, I experienced another urinary issue—frequent urination despite a normal volume and clear urine. After running every possible test with a urologist—urinalysis, prostate PSA, ultrasound—nothing was conclusive. The doctors simply advised me to give it time. It took about three months for those symptoms to resolve.

**The Onset of the Current Problem**

About ten months ago, I felt a burning sensation during urination. It only happened when my flow was weak, and the urine was not clear in color. These episodes occurred throughout the day. Pain was typically on the tip of my penis and sometimes moves downwards, During the times I wasn’t burning, I experienced frequent, high-volume urination, often every hour, even with little water intake. Urge to urinate was sudden and intense, and I couldn’t hold it.

Concerned, I returned to the urologist. I underwent a urine culture, prostate ultrasound, and other tests—nothing abnormal. Then, they asked for an STI test. To my surprise, they found *Mycoplasma hominis* in my urine. I had no idea what that was and was certain I didn’t have any sexual risks, as I’d been with one long-term partner. The doctor assured me it was relatively common and often symptomless, but out of caution, I was prescribed antibiotics for a week. Unfortunately, after a week, there was no improvement, and symptoms persisted for three months.

**The Testicular Pain**

Fast forward three months: I woke up with a dull ache in my right testicle. I initially dismissed it, thinking it would pass, but it persisted for three to four months. The pain was minimal—about 1/10—just an annoying ache. Interestingly, while I had testicular pain, my urethral symptoms had completely disappeared. Sometimes, the urethritis-like symptoms would return, and the testicular ache would fade. I was exhausted mentally and physically, convinced there was no hope for recovery.

At week two of testicular pain, I consulted a doctor, who performed an ultrasound and couldn’t find any lumps. He recommended seeing a dermatologist, suspecting other issues. That’s when I finally followed some advice from these threads to seek help for PFD.

**Exploring PFD and Trying Treatments**

In my country, PFD isn’t widely recognized, so there were only a handful of doctors willing to discuss it. I found one who suggested I might have PN, given the moving nature of my symptoms. She prescribed Cymbalta, which caused severe side effects, but I persisted. After completing two weeks of medication, there was no change.

I then visited a pelvic floor (PF) specialist and underwent internal work for about a month, but the results left me disappointed. I tried various stretching exercises from this community to no avail. Throughout this ordeal, I learned that I’d rather endure testicular pain than urethritis—although both were very disruptive and mentally draining.

**The Up and Down Months**

The subsequent three months were a rollercoaster: some days with urethritis, others with testicular pain—all mutually exclusive. I noticed that ejaculation worsened my symptoms; on the day I ejaculated, I felt relief, but symptoms returned worse two or three days later. Coffee seemed to aggravate both issues. I started drinking barley water instead of coffee, which slowly helped lessen my symptoms.

**Recovery and Final Thoughts**

By the ninth month, I can confidently say I am around 99% healed. Honestly, I still don’t know exactly what the root cause was or what finally cured me. I continue drinking at least two cups a day. It's a long and hard journey, just give it time and I hope you find complete relief as I have. Good luck and never give up hope!",1,1753681677.0,PelvicFloor,0,1.0,False

## What is Quantum Azopt?

Quantum Azopt is an **automated trading platform** that uses machine learning and AI algorithms to analyze the financial markets and execute trades in real-time. Think of it as your personal crypto assistant—minus the attitude and coffee breaks.

It aims to help both beginners and experienced traders by removing the emotional aspect of trading and relying on data-driven decisions. The platform supports a variety of assets including **cryptocurrencies, forex pairs, stocks, and commodities**, making it pretty versatile.

Basically, it’s like autopilot for your trading strategies. You set some parameters, the AI does its thing, and ideally—you profit. It’s not magic, but it’s definitely trying to make the process feel a lot less chaotic.

## Who Created Quantum Azopt?

Alright, so here’s the thing: **Quantum Azopt doesn’t shout from the rooftops about its creators**, which is pretty common with these types of platforms. That said, it seems to be developed by a team of financial tech experts and crypto enthusiasts who wanted to democratize access to algorithmic trading.

The lack of a clear “face” behind the platform might be a red flag to some, but it’s actually not unusual in this space. Similar platforms like Bitcoin Code and Immediate Edge operate the same way. What matters more is **whether the platform works—and whether it's trustworthy**. So far, Quantum Azopt checks most of those boxes.

It also pairs you with **partner brokers**, which are often regulated, to actually execute the trades. That’s how it bridges the gap between AI analysis and market execution.

So I’ve been seeing this guy for about 3 weeks now. We’ve gone on two dates so far - the first date we went out for coffee and went on a walk. The 2nd date we went to the movies. Both times we kissed. He keeps dropping hints that he wants to do more and said he could get a hotel room for us next weekend. It just feels like that’s kind of soon?

The flight leaves at 11:50am, but the D1 lounge only opens at 8:30. We got to the regular lounge at 8 and they had to manually check us in as we were over 3 hours away. They were quite kind but said they could only accommodate us because it wasn’t full. As the D1 lounge doesn’t have a time limit I thought it was interesting how they have to handle when the D1 lounge isn’t open yet  but I give no grief to anyone. 

The experience as amazing. The level of service was incredible. As I told many servers and managers who asked us for feedback, I said if The Bear ran a lounge, this would be it. I appreciated all of the small attention to detail. You could tell everyone working in that lounge was proud to well there and their service reflected as such. 

I had the Dungeness Crab Benedict (sauce on the side) and bacon, my husband had the Dutch Baby and potatoes. All were outstanding. I also had the lychee martini, a bit sweet for my taste but the next one they removed the syrup and it was fantastic. 

Overall, it was a very memorable way to kick off our trip to Japan. As someone who has been to a lot to Sky Clubs, this did stand out as something special. I hope to visit again with a night flight to try the dinner!

I'm struggling from a lot of depression ( been clinically diagnosed since i was 10 ) because nobody will talk to me. I was told that high school was going to be fun, like going out with your friends to do stupid things or even getting coffee together. And now I've been in it for 3 years and nothing. Radio silence, I want to make it really clear that I have been trying to talk to people and join clubs. I have joined over 3 clubs at my school and in every one whenever I try to talk to someone its just ""yeah"" , ""mhm"" or they don't even make eye contact or act engaged into what I'm saying. 

I even even tried talking to random people in my classes and asking if I can eat lunch with others to try to talk and maybe bond over something but i usually just make their whole group go silent and text each other on their phones about how weird I am to be sitting with them and someone will type something and the girls will just go "" Stop, that's so mean!"" or "" Omg shush shush be nice she's right there!"" 

I realized this is so bad that I cant even see friends or a boyfriend and girlfriend my age in public doing something because I just break down crying because i don't know why i don't have that. 

I don't think I'm an ugly person, though sometimes I wonder if that's why or that I might not look approachable enough?  I dress like everyone else and I think I blend in okay with groups of people my age. I truly don't know what I'm doing wrong and I don't know why it seems like everyone hates me and doesn't want to be my friend. I have felt like this since i was 6 on the playground always sitting alone and now as I've gotten older it feels like I'll  just never have a real life long friendship. 

I've been bullied all my life and the only reason was for being lonely and having no friends. This really shouldn't be eating me up as bad as it is and I feel like everyone around me just thinks that I'm dramatic but I feel so alone and I  just want to know what I'm doing wrong so I can fix it. It feels like everyone's advice is just "" oh high school sucks, you'll be out soon!"" which is true but it really just doesn't help.

Made from BPA-free plastic, the device includes a valve at the base that allows coffee to steep fully before being released into a cup or carafe. This design aims to produce a cleaner, fuller-bodied brew compared to standard pour-over methods. The device is compatible with standard #4 cone-shaped filters and typically brews around 16 ounces per batch.

Operation is straightforward: users add ground coffee and hot water, allow it to steep for the desired time, and then place the dripper over a mug to release the brewed coffee. The shut-off valve opens automatically when the dripper is set on a cup, allowing for easy and mess-free brewing. It requires no electricity and minimal cleanup, making it suitable for both home and travel use.

We’ve been together 2+ years. We fell hard and fast — he moved closer after 2.5 months, and by 4 months we were living together full time. In the beginning, we had fun, went on dates, and he’d surprise me with flowers or coffee. Lately, it feels like he hates everything I say or do.

Some recent examples:
	•	Dog incident: I left for 5 minutes to grab pre-ordered bagels. His dog peed. He yelled at me for 20+ minutes for not crating him — even though he doesn’t always crate him either.
	•	Shock collar: I took the dog out for a bedtime pee without the shock collar (we were just going outside briefly). He yelled at me again for 15 minutes, insisting I always use it, even though the dog wasn’t even pulling. He followed me into the bedroom and demanded I use it, “every single fucking time”
	•	Lunch drive: We went to get coffee. He said he wanted lunch but hadn’t picked a place. As we approached a main road, I suggested a left turn where there were plenty of spots. He flipped out, said I didn’t listen, and berated me for almost 40 minutes. I said I’m driving home and he drove off in his truck. Then acted like nothing happened and asked if I wanted food. Then continued to bring it back up and yell at me further demanding I apologize for saying we could go left on the road instead of straight like he said to. i thought I was helping and then felt so small and misunderstood.he insisted i didn’t hear him and what he said. 

He gets mad over everything. When I talk, I’m “always wrong” or “don’t make sense.” I feel sick and sad — I love him, but I’m constantly walking on eggshells. Has anyone been through this?

1mb802y,https://www.reddit.com/r/Productivitycafe/comments/1mb802y/10_things_ive_invested_in_for_better_productivity/,10 Things I've Invested in for Better Productivity,"Hey r/Productivitycafe, over the past two years, I’ve been slowly (and sometimes painfully) figuring out how to work better, feel better, and waste less time. One big lesson? Sometimes, free isn’t really free; especially when it’s costing you hours of frustration, discomfort, or just straight-up inefficiency.

Here are 10 things I've found are worth the money to improve productivity:

**1. Paid Tools > Free Tools** \- I used to use free software for almost everything. It worked at first, but most of those apps had limits. Some were full of ads, some kept crashing, and others just didn’t do enough. I’d waste hours trying to fix stuff or find workarounds.

One of the first things I paid for was a proper PDF tool. I was juggling five different free apps just to do basic things like convert, edit, or merge files. It got annoying fast. I ended up buying **PDFMaster. for Windows** (from Cisdem; a brand that makes highly-efficient software) It was $59.95 on sale, and it replaced everything I was using.

It does way more than I expected. I can edit any part of a PDF, move things around, or add links that actually work. It has an AI feature that summarizes pages, translates documents without messing up the layout, and even spots grammar issues I’d usually miss. Redacting stuff is permanent now, not just a black box over text. The OCR turns scanned files into real text I can search. There are also reading modes that make long sessions easier on the eyes.

That switch alone is saving me 2 to 3 hours every day. Worth it.

|**Before (Free Tools)**|After|
|:-|:-|
|Used 5+ apps just to convert or edit PDFs|One powerful tool for editing, converting, OCR, redacting, more|
|Crashes, ads, and limited features|Fast, stable interface with advanced AI-powered tools|
|Wasted 2–3 hours daily on clunky workarounds|Saved 2–3 hours/day with a smoother, faster workflow|

**2. A proper office chair** \- My old $50 Target chair was destroying my lower back. By mid-afternoon I'd be shifting around and taking breaks every 20 minutes. Couldn't sit comfortably, my posture was terrible, and focusing was impossible. I finally got a **Herman Miller Aeron for $1,200** (used, because I'm not rich). Not cheap, but worth it.

The mesh keeps me from getting sweaty, the lumbar support lines up with my actual spine, and I can move the armrests however I need. My back pain disappeared in two weeks. Now I can sit and code for hours without needing to stand up. The chair keeps my posture decent without me thinking about it.

It's expensive, but it took my focused work sessions from 45 minutes to over 3 hours. The 12-year warranty helps justify the cost too.

|**Before (Cheap $50 Chair)**|**After (Herman Miller Aeron – $1,200 used)**|
|:-|:-|
|Back pain, poor posture, constant fidgeting|No back pain, stable posture, longer focus sessions|
|Max 45 minutes of focus|3+ hours of deep, uninterrupted work|
|Needed breaks constantly|Forgot I was even sitting|

**3. Noise-cancelling headphones** \- Open offices made it hard to focus. Every phone call, chat, and coffee machine beep pulled me out of my work. I tried foam earplugs but they cut me off too much. I couldn’t hear the stuff I actually needed to.

I ended up getting the **Sony WH-1000XM4 headphones**. They were $350, which felt like a lot, but they solved the problem. The noise cancelling blocks out background noise, but I can still hear people if they need my attention. I usually work with brown noise or instrumental music, and outside sounds stay out.

Since I started using them, I stopped losing focus every few minutes. I can work for a couple of hours straight now. My stress went down too. Calls are clearer. And they’re comfortable enough to wear all day.

|**Before (Open Office / Foam Plugs)**|**After (Sony WH-1000XM4 – $350)**|
|:-|:-|
|Distracted by every conversation|Deep focus, background noise blocked|
|Couldn’t hear what I needed to|Smart noise canceling; still aware when needed|
|Stress from interruptions|Calmer, more productive work sessions|

**4. Physical planner over digital apps** \- I was using too many apps. Notion, Apple Reminders, Google Calendar. Tasks were all over the place. I'd forget to check one, or get pulled into notifications and end up doing nothing.

I picked up a **Moleskine Weekly Planner** for $25. Writing things down felt old-school, but it worked. The act of writing helps me remember better. I can see my whole week at once without switching screens. And crossing things off with a pen feels good.

Every morning I write down three things I need to get done. My completion rate went from 60 percent to 85. The limited space keeps me honest about what I can actually do.

|**Before (Apps like Notion, Todoist, Google Calendar)**|**After (Moleskine Weekly Planner – $25)**|
|:-|:-|
|Scattered tasks, notification overload|One place for everything. No digital noise|
|Forgot which app had what|Clear weekly view at a glance|
|60% task completion|85% completion, better memory retention|

**5. Quality sleep setup** \- I was getting 7 or 8 hours but still waking up tired. My old mattress had a dent where I slept, and streetlights kept the room too bright.

I got a **Tuft & Needle mattress** for $650 and **blackout curtains** for $80. The mattress is firm enough for my back but still soft at the hips. The curtains block nearly all the light. My room feels like a cave now, in a good way.

My sleep tracker shows 20 percent more deep sleep. Most days I wake up without an alarm. I’ve stopped crashing at 3 PM. I stay focused until dinner.

|**Before (Old Mattress, Bright Room)**|**After (Tuft & Needle + Blackout Curtains – $730 Total)**|
|:-|:-|
|7–8 hours of light, poor sleep|Deeper, uninterrupted sleep|
|Woke up groggy, afternoon crashes|Wake up refreshed, energy lasts longer|
|Dent in mattress, too much light distraction|Firm support + total darkness = true cave mode|

**6. Fitness tracker** \- Sitting all day was messing with my mood and energy. I’d forget to move for hours, then feel awful and not know why.

I got a **Fitbit Charge 5** for $180. It buzzes once an hour so I remember to stand up and walk. It tracks steps, heart rate, and sleep without me doing anything. The stress feature uses heart rate data to tell me when to take a break.

Now I actually care about hitting 10,000 steps. I used to average 3,000. The sleep score helps me figure out why I’m dragging some mornings.

|**Before (Sedentary, Low Energy)**|**After (Fitbit Charge 5 – $180)**|
|:-|:-|
|Forgot to move, low step count (\~3k)|Hitting 10k+ steps/day|
|Didn’t notice stress build-up|Real-time stress + recovery insights|
|No idea why I felt off|Clear trends tied to sleep and movement|

**7. External monitor** \- Working on a 13-inch laptop was slowing me down. I kept switching tabs, losing track of references, and squinting at tiny text. It was tiring and frustrating. I picked up a **27-inch 4K LG monitor** for $300.

Now I can code on one screen and test on the other. Or write on one and research on the second. No more juggling windows or digging through tabs. I can bump up the font size and still have space to work. The monitor sits at eye level, so my neck isn’t sore at the end of the day. The colors are more accurate, which helps with design.

|**Before (13"" Laptop Only)**|**After (27"" 4K LG Monitor – $300)**|
|:-|:-|
|Constantly switching tabs|Multiple windows side-by-side|
|Eye strain, hunched posture|Eye-level viewing, better ergonomics|
|Lost focus digging through tabs|Smoother workflow, fewer interruptions|

**8. Premium to-do list manager** \- My tasks used to be all over the place. Some on sticky notes, some in my phone, some buried in emails. I’d miss stuff because nothing was in one spot. Free apps were too basic. No reminders, no way to set priorities.

I switched to **Todoist Premium**. It’s $48 a year. Now I just type things like “buy groceries tomorrow at 5 PM” and it gets added right. Recurring tasks handle my daily stuff. It also syncs with my calendar, so I can see everything together. I start each day knowing what’s coming. Most days, I end with almost everything done.

|**Before (Sticky notes, scattered tasks)**|**After (Todoist Premium – $48/year)**|
|:-|:-|
|Missed deadlines, no central system|One inbox for everything|
|No prioritization or reminders|Smart recurring tasks, filters, and calendar sync|
|Hard to start daily planning|Daily planning is frictionless, habit-forming|

**9. Password manager** \- I used to rotate between the same three passwords for everything. It was lazy and stressful. Anytime I forgot one, I had to reset it. That took 10 to 15 minutes each time. After a friend got hacked, I started worrying more.

I signed up for **1Password**. It costs $36 a year. Now it makes strong passwords for me and fills them in with one click. There’s a feature called Watchtower that checks if any of my passwords are weak or have been exposed. It sends alerts if there’s a problem. It works on all my devices, so I don’t have to think about where I’m logging in from. I don’t type passwords anymore. I just tap and I’m in.

|**Before (Reused passwords, constant resets)**|**After (1Password – $36/year)**|
|:-|:-|
|Weak security, time lost on password resets|Strong, unique passwords for every site|
|Typed manually each time|Auto-fill everything securely|
|Anxiety about hacks|Peace of mind with breach alerts and monitoring|

**10. Standing desk converter** \- Sitting all day was killing my energy and tightening my hips. I didn’t want to drop $800 on a full standing desk, so I got an **UPLIFT converter** for $250.

It sits on top of my normal desk and changes height with a lever. I switch between sitting and standing about every 90 minutes. Standing helps my posture and keeps my blood moving. My lower back pain went away after a week. Moving between positions helps me look at problems differently too.

It took 10 minutes to set up and didn’t need any tools. Feels solid for typing and using a mouse. I don’t crash in the afternoons anymore because I’m not slouched in a chair. It also burns a few more calories per hour, which doesn’t hurt.

|**Before (Sitting all day, low energy)**|**After (UPLIFT Converter – $250)**|
|:-|:-|
|Hip tightness, back soreness|Move between sitting and standing easily|
|Post-lunch crash, stiff joints|Better circulation, higher afternoon energy|
|Stuck in one position all day|More dynamic and flexible workflow|

I’ve spent around $4,000 on this stuff over the past two years. Not all at once. I’d pick up one thing here and there after doing some research. Some people say it’s over the top, but I worked out the math and the boost in focus and output made it worth it. My income went up by about 40% during that time, and being able to work more efficiently was a big part of that.

If you’re just starting, go for the cheapest thing that solves the biggest problem.

Should we tell the wife?","Problem/Goal: My friend (F20s) matched with a guy (M30s) on a dating app. We found out he has a kid, might be married, and still acts single. Should we tell the wife?

Context: My friend (F20s) matched with this guy in his early (M30s) on a dating app a few weeks ago. He seemed pretty chill, polite, respectful, regularly asking her out for coffee. The convos were flirty, and there were subtle hookup vibes, but nothing too explicit. Overall, he was giving off “available, single guy” energy.

His dating profile was lowkey, but you could tell he was doing well in life. He looked well-groomed, dressed sharp, owns a business and drives luxury/sports cars. Definitely someone who seems put-together and successful.

But something felt off. My friend couldn’t explain it, just intuition. So we did a little social media digging, and that’s when everything shifted.

We found out he has a son, around 9 or 10 years old. The kid has a Facebook account that’s clearly monitored by the mom, based on how the posts are written.

Then we found her, the woman who seems to be his long-term partner or maybe even wife. She made a post in 2020 saying they’d been together for 16 years. At first, we thought maybe they split up… until we looked at her recent posts on her other account. 

From March to June 2025, she’s posted multiple photos, videos, reels with him — vacations, family gatherings, birthdays, and events with their son. They still look very much like a couple. No signs of separation or issues, at least not publicly.

Meanwhile, he’s still active on the dating app. Still messaging my friend like nothing’s wrong. Still asking her out. Still pretending to be single.

Now we’re at a crossroads. My friend already unmatched him and wants nothing to do with him. But she keeps asking me, “Should I tell the wife?” We even considered making a new, anonymous account just to message her, but she’s scared it might somehow lead back to her. What if it creates drama and she ends up being blamed?

At the same time, it feels so wrong not to say anything. We keep wondering:
What if the wife has no idea?
What if she does know, but pretends not to because he provides for her and the kid?
What if no one else has told her before?

We’re stuck in this moral limbo.

So, if you were the wife, would you want to know?
And if you’ve ever had to tell someone something like this… how did you do it?
Any advice on staying anonymous while doing the right thing?

We’re open to any insight. This whole thing has just been a lot to process.",7,1753680904.0,adviceph,18,1.0,False
1mb7yfa,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1mb7yfa/since_1976_98_of_babies_have_been_born_with_a_6th/,"Since 1976, 98% of babies have been born with a 6th sense. It has become the new normal state of the human. The parietal implant surgery should help me become normal.","I am one of the unlucky ones. I spent every moment among abled with this crippling feeling of unbelonging. Sure, I had friends in my ‘’senseless’’ community. It was not enough. And maybe it was ungrateful of me, I couldn't contain this urge to be *normal.*

Connecting to the deepest level? Seeing more than on the surface? Such a mundane thing for normal people. They would pity me for the lack of something I couldn't even comprehend.

  


Endless ruminations of my mind were taking turns with a boring reality I had as a life. 

My sleepy older brother mumbled through the yawn:

“Sun is sure grumpy today, isn't it?” 

What a typical way to describe weather for the abled ones.

  


“Seems just as usual warm today to me. A little cloudy, maybe,” I replied with disinterest. 

  


My brother gave me an encouraging pat on the shoulder and said: 

“I’m sure the parietal implant will give you everything you need.”

  
  


The evening before the surgery, I couldn't brush off the uneasiness. The charming smell of Baskoro’s dinner was my only distraction. Almost everyone would support my decision to get the parietal implant. It was recently patented and vigorously tested in private experiments but not yet widespread for the public. Though Baskoro would still be concerned about unnecessary risks. It was his last chance to change my mind. 

“It's going to be alright. I was waiting for this for so long! I can’t just drop it,” I argued.

  


“It is never too late,” He said and let out a sigh, “Sometimes, it’s hard to abandon your commitment, but are you truly sure if it is worth it?” 

I didn’t say anything. He knew I had already made up my mind.  

“Though, it is ultimately your choice,” he added, staring into the window. I didn't have to see his face to know he had that grumpy look.

  


I wanted to see it through. It was chilling to my bone marrow, yet I wanted to know the truth. I was meant to feel what I was ripped off from my birth.

20 years. I had spent 20 years of my life looking for patterns in these glances and I failed to see any. As if sixth sense perception was so deeply embedded in every moment of your life you can't pinpoint what makes it *normal*. Different from mine. 

  


I can admit that bitter envy is clouding my judgement. But if I don’t see it through, then I will spend my years with doubts and regret.

  


In the hospital’s corridor I heard a child's cry which is common for sterile white rooms smelling of alcohol. A girl's parents were trying to soothe her as she left the cabinet rubbing her temples. Getting used to something entirely new cannot be easy. Though, the younger the patients are, the bigger are the chances of success. 

  


“It'll get better in just a couple of hours!” The familiar voice of my doctor rang through the door. It opened with an inviting creak. 

  


He picked up a new pair of gloves and put them on with a loud pop of plastic in preparation for testing my senses. 

The flashlight checked my vision, common odors like coffee tested my sense of smell, and some other trials were commenced for taste, hearing and skin touch. Following the final check before the procedure, the swirls of excitement and anxiety were drowning me, and my thoughts were rushing, failing to anchor to anything calming. Anesthesia finally let me have just a moment of peace. My memories after that were fuzzy and in odd order.

I woke up in what felt like only a second of restless sleep. To my surprise I felt only a little bit of nagging pain. I couldn’t form any thoughts, and in that state they let me rest.

  


I was disturbed by my doctor after two hours of a feverish nap.

  


“Time to test!” he eagerly said and got a triangle. Its metal glittered in the sun rays. Reflections were painfully blinding due to the headache. Time was moving so excruciatingly slow, I couldn’t wait for my honour. The doctor hit the triangle with a stick. It was silent. I looked at the doctor in confusion since I could hear steps behind the door and the wind outside. He stared into my eyes searching for a result. I shifted uncomfortably in the chair. 

  


“I hear nothing from this triangle. Is that normal?” I asked with caution. 

  


He rubbed his chin. “That is unusual but not unheard of. Did you ever feel the 6th sense indirectly through other basic 5 senses? For example, blind can dream visually and discern light from darkness.”

  


“Even if I did, I won't be able to say specifically what,” I replied. 

  


“Well, as you have been told already, the implant truly doesn't give you the sense. It helps you create new neural paths in your brain so it can imitate the feeling for you. Not only it might take awhile to get used to it, but, I'm very sorry to say, in your case it is possible that it won't be as effective as it was expected to be at first. But we will see.”

  


I swallowed to ease the dry throat. There was a weird mix of relief and disappointment in my stomach. I knew about this possibility already, but it should have been enough to finally blend in.  

  


Though, and I couldn't tell if it was my imagination, I could almost feel the neuron paths being generated as the new information that I couldn't discern yet is being processed. The pain was minor, it was lingering in the background of my conscience. 

  


I finished dealing with the documents and the scheduling of the next check-up and went outside under a dense barrage of clouds. I could see the spots of light and shadows running on the asphalt, as clouds were passing by with immense speed. Not sure what got into me when I rushed under the cover of a cafe to avoid another trail of sun, just like when I was a kid messing around outdoors.

When I could see clouds last enough to cover me all the way through to my home, I was relieved to get proper rest back home.

  


It was barely 4 pm when I dropped onto my bed and fell asleep in an instant. I hoped I would sleep as if knocked out. But my dreams were a mess of unintelligible shapes and sounds. I felt so hot and uncomfortable. Delirium visions were afflicting my restless sleep. No position was right, no pillow was soft. Viscous fake awakenings were taking turns with vexing terrors.

  


Scorching pain hit my ears - a roaring scream was tearing my mind apart. I jolted out of bed and everything was rolling before my eyes as I was trying to find balance under unending torture. The screeching was unbearable, it took seconds - a negligible amount usually, but painfully long in this moment - to get a hold of the situation and shut my ears with palms. It didn't get any quieter. My wide opened eyes looked around in despair. Where is this torturous sound coming from and why can I not possibly block it out even slightly? Sweat was covering my neck as I was panting from excruciating pain, still helplessly holding my hands on my ears in lack of anything else I could do. Headache was pulsating in my head as if drills were rearranging my brain matter with each thrust of pain. I crawled whimpering to the corner of the room trying to curl up in an embryo pose. My human intelligence regressed to the basic existence of a primitive creature that could feel nothing but this unending pain. 

  


My mind was blank for an unknown amount of time and, slowly without being conscious about it, I came to my senses and it was finally quiet. My body felt frozen and it was scary to move, almost if slight flick of a finger would bring torture back. I slowly opened my eyes and cautiously sat down trying to process what had happened. One thing was clear - the scream I supposedly heard wasn't a sound. 

My thoughts were like lazy flies rumbling trying to get a hold of the whole picture. My mind felt like a sore body on the next day of the most extensive exercise. I felt somewhat like an animal that barely escaped a predator. Yet, it was lurking. I had to think fast. 

Maybe it was some sort of case of synesthesia - an anomalous blending of the senses. Exactly - this is what the doctor was talking about, experiencing something through another sense. I rubbed my temple that was yet to completely recover from anesthesia. What input could make me hear such an awful noise? I got up with my legs slightly shaking. I felt utterly pale and exhausted even though I had just woken up. 

  


I sighed and calmed down. It was morning and the sun was leaving stripes on the floor and my bed through the curtains. I walked to the window to close them in hope to resume my sleep and to deal with whatever that was later. I reached out and sun rays hit my finger - a scream put sharp claws around my mind. I froze and gasped. Sounds were racing through my head. My thoughts were reduced to screaming once more. Two seconds later I flicked it away like from a burning stove in pain. 

  


The *Sun*. I heard the *Sun*.

  


Third eye has opened just to be met with blinding pain.

  


I kneeled so I wouldn't be hit by sun rays and my trembling hand closed the curtain with a struggle because of an uncomfortable angle. I collapsed right there on the floor under the window sill. I was taking deep comforting breaths trying to sort out what had happened, what I felt. I clutched my finger in the palm and instead of burning sensation I heard echoes of the voices from far away. 

I came to the conclusion that the curtains were possibly moved by wind and Sun hit my face through the opening. This is what caused me immense torture. Does everyone with 6th sense feel the Sun the same way or have I had an unsuccessful procedure with terrible complications? Truly, abled people are happy under the Sun. They cherish it and share it with each other. One thing is certain, I need to get it fixed, I cannot imagine living avoiding the sun like some sort of vampire. Some legend might come after me and kill me in my sleep.

  


I got up and started changing for an emergency doctor's visit. Danger wasn't immediate and I wasn't sure if I could explain myself without being sent to a psychiatrist check-up. And so I couldn't call an ambulance. I picked up my phone and stared at the screen with a few concerned messages from friends and family. What should I say? I was really insistent on getting this implant. It feels embarrassing to admit it wasn't a great idea after all. I decided to put it off worrying everyone until I'm sure it is serious and long-term. I copy-pasted ""I'm doing good. Resting. Getting a check-up today. Thanks for the concern!"" with slight changes to each person depending on my relationship with them. 

I put the phone down and started brainstorming how to cover all of my skin. I put on long clothes and gloves. At first, I thought that an umbrella should cover my face and neck, but the possibility of pain hit me like a whip. A vivid memory from long ago made me shudder. Once reflected light in my car’s mirror hit me in the eyes and it almost made me lose control of the vehicle. An umbrella is not safe enough. Is it appropriate in this situation to dress like I’m actually invisible? I have bandaged my face, put a scarf around my neck and put sunglasses on. During that, I received a call on my phone and struggled to accept the call both mentally and physically. Physically, because the touch screen is not responsive enough to my glove’s material, and mentally because it was Baskoro. 

  


“Hi, how are you?” I tried to speak as nonchalantly as possible.

  


“Are you alright? The text you sent was weird,” he deadpanned. I panicked almost audibly. I couldn't possibly guess his reaction besides most likely justified scolding. 

  


“Yeah, everything is good! I'm going to the doctor right now for a check up,” I replied, with hopes my voice wasn’t shaking. 

  


“Alright, I'll be right there.”

Before I could even protest he ended the call. You can’t escape the inevitable. 

  


I was never so anxious about going outside before. When I opened the door to the street fully bright from sunlight I was covered in goosebumps. There was no open skin. First step out. I became aware of the sun rays trying to penetrate through the pores of my clothes but even if they were reaching anywhere, thankfully, I could barely feel it. If I heard something unusual I could mix it up with the city noise.

I was completely focused on the road, ignoring glances from passersby. 

  


When I finally entered the clinic, Baskoro was already there. He was talking to a nurse and she was visibly giving him a cold shoulder. I approached him carefully, trying to think of how to explain myself. 

Confusion and concern appeared at his usually steady face. 

“What happened?” he said with an indiscernible tone.

I felt like something was stuck in my throat and realized I was on the verge of crying. If I say anything, absolutely anything, I would just burst down. 

“Hey, come here,” he whispered softly as he slightly squeezed my arm to lead me to sit on the couch. He tried to look into my eyes through the dark lenses of my sunglasses, “What happened, Lise?”

I felt as if I lost something important. A connection with people I've already had. And now, I'm stuck in this limbo between abled and senseless. 

  


I cried my heart out without saying anything. He waited for me to be able to talk. I took my glasses off since they were collecting tears and removed bandages from my mouth. 

  


I kept stuttering as he was patiently looking at me. “I don't know. Something went terribly wrong and I was in so much pain because,” I took a raspy breath, “I heard the Sun.”

I looked down at my shoes expecting a response but he was waiting for me to continue. 

“You are not going to lecture me? You were mad at me, weren’t you? Since I told you about my plans and you were right all along.” 

  


He snorted. 

“Why are you hurting so much? You had no idea *this* could possibly happen.”

  


“Thank you,” I said with a barely intelligible and trembling voice.

  


“Thank me later when I'll make this place fix this nonsense”.

  


A mean looking nurse heard me out while barely paying attention. She glanced at me with a mix of annoyance and disturbance. She took my measurements, suddenly swore and walked off in a rush. I felt myself going increasingly pale. 

  


I was furious. The adult patients that were permitted to have experimental implants were possessing some sort of a curious pair of genes: one that would allow the sharpest 6th sense, and one that would apparently cause loss of 6th sense at the same time. Scientists wanted to find out why.

“The procedure was an enormous success even if you don't agree with me right now. No, even if I remove the implant, neurons’ connections have already been established so you would keep your 6th sense. It has heightened activity and sensitivity compared to the general population. You should feel privileged and grateful. You might need to reassess your religion and your place here.”

  


“What?” I was baffled, “Not to be disrespectful, but how is religion relevant here?” 

  


“Your attitude is the reason why it is so painful.”

  
  


Sun imagery is everywhere in human history and religion. Saints halos, personification of the Sun, rituals and dances. What is the Sun but not a God? Powerful beyond comprehension. In size so unimaginably enormous, yet so far way out of human grasp. It will blind you if you dare look at it. It is life, it is death. It is a gentle touch of warmth and unbearable scorching heat. It can disappear to our doom at any moment and it wouldn't be to anyone's surprise. 

  


“Sun is not sentient,” I said with a shaking voice. 

  


“Do you think something capable of communication is not sentient? You spent your life in darkness, deaf to the call. People pitied you for your overwhelming ignorance! And now you want to go back to your intoxicating foolishness? Too late. Accept the gift and pray to listen closely to the Sun.”

  


My blessing, My curse. I always hear it now. It is loud during the day when the Sun is looming over my existence. It is quiet at night, where the Moon is a pathetic reflection of the Sun's light in its absence. I was going through life, oblivious to the overwhelming presence of the star. Everything I hear, feel, think is touched by the Sun.

I feel so much shame and guilt. I keep falling asleep with my baby on my arms during the night. I know it's not safe. ""Get up and walk around,"" ""put her in the crib,"" ""drink coffee."" I've tried coffee and it's not working. I'm so sleep deprived I guess I'm not thinking right anymore. I've gotten probably less than 20 hours of sleep over the past 7 days, so it's easier said than done to get up and put her in the crib or walk around when I am groggy, because it seems to happen so fast. I try watching videos and reading a book out loud to her. At first, I would just nod off while I was waiting for her to go into deep sleep in my arms before transferring her. Nodding off became sleeping for long stretches of time. As of this post, I have just now woken up curled up sitting on the couch with her in my arms after having fallen asleep like this for an HOUR while waiting for her to go into deep sleep. Last night, I was nodding off while breastfeeding her, which scared me as I could have smothered her or choked her while she was feeding.

I don't know why I don't have the willpower to get her in the crib. Maybe I just haven't been scared or anxious enough. I feel like a failure of a mom, I am continuously putting my own daughter in danger every night and I could possibly kill her because I can't muster up enough energy to get up and put her in her crib to sleep safely. Every night I tell myself, ""Do better, tonight will be different, you can do it."" And I can't. Apparently my sleep deprived subconscious self is fine with gambling my baby's life every night feeding.

I can't do it. I can't be trusted to be alone with my own baby during the night to not fall asleep with her in my arms. I have cried several nights over it but I haven't changed. Something is wrong with me, clearly I'm not worried enough about my own baby's safety, otherwise I would be able to put her in the crib.

Had a holiday lined up in a country that isn’t opposed to death penalty’s so opted to rawdog my ailments and use it as opportunity to take a long break.  Now I was already pretty burnt out as most of us are and I also didn’t want to go on a holiday because money goes down and that’s bad, but regardless there was still a weird week long comedown where I’d just cry a lot and was getting a lot of Jesus related content to the point I was like “is this a sign? Is the big man Tryna reach me”, but that leveled out after about 7 days. 

Was reluctant to start back at work raw but figured I’d humour it and see how it goes and honestly, it’s been pretty chill.  I’m not as overwhelmed with having multiple tasks on my mental list (yeah not physical, fuck a cheat code), I’m more leveled out, doing lame obligatory stuff is still lame but less of a grind, my appetites come back, sleeping is easier(not on the holiday that was fucking torture) and I’ve slept in for the first time in fuck knows how long, the “edge” I need to take off has reduced so less caffeine less alcohol and less marijuana intake,oh and bowel movements are back to normal,regardless of coffee intake.

I guess there’s something to be said for functioning a certain way for extended periods; something something habits take x amount of months yadda yadda. 

I’m pretty confident It’s not a sleep rebound thing because I take herbal sedatives that are still outlawed in many places, I was probably getting 3 hours of broken sleep for 2 weeks. I’m not saying I’m done for good, I’m not advocating for everyone in here to rawdog life, other people’s lives are not mine. But if you feel like you’ve been circling the drain for a while, maybe take a break and allow yourself to suck ass at life for a couple weeks.

Heading to the west wing of the park, we enter Monte Sierra, a desert region home to the oil company, Truffade Mining Company. Truffade has gotten big from their mining operations, effectively using pressurized water as a cheap and efficient way to blast away rocks! So big, in fact, that they now offer tours using their mine train system, in the down time when the mining is slow. A nice calming ride!  
Additionally, Truffade is experimenting with using their water blasting to power amusements for these new-fangled fairs, with their newly-created ""launch tower"", which uses the pressurized water to blast willing attendees high into the sky!  
Deep in the valley, however, visitors can find a very disgruntled rival Penton Company, who are perturbed by Truffade's interference into their own mining operations, and have opened their own spinning amusement to rival, as well as the company selling off accessories based off of dinosaur fossils found in the valley.

And last, but not least, is the final (currently) land, Dreamlight Forest. as you can tell, the land is by far and away the least developed, not only due to it being the least prioritized, but also the most expensive (around 60% of the park's cost comes from this area already.) Dreamlight Forest is planned to be a mystical forest, home to not only an amusement for guests to ride on the Forest's resident horses throughout the valley, but as well as explore the mysterious caves that crawl underground, and house a secret or two.

And that's all for now! Obviously, there's a lot more ways to go, and hopefully one day I'll be able to return here and post my progress. Who knows, maybe even better, one of you might join me someday and see it yourself! Until then, good day and happy park building!

1mb7l5v,https://i.redd.it/8ah697thtjff1.jpeg,Their queen returns,"1.Chapter 1 The Ghost Of The Past
""Are you sure about this, Sienna?"" Outside the airport terminal, a woman in a chic white suit clutched Sienna's hand, her own trembling.
""You don't have to go back to Solara,"" she begged. Her blonde hair and blue eyes were swimming with a desperate plea. ""Please. Stay here, with us.""
Sienna Hart, a vision of cool elegance, met her foster mother's gaze. She pulled her into a deep, meaningful hug, her own eyes stinging.
""I have to go back, Mom,"" she said softly. ""But I'll be back. I promise.""
But as the plane taxied down the runway, she knew this was a promise she might not be able to keep.
Three days ago, the dam of her memory had broken. Ten years, washed away in an instant, revealing the truth of who she was.
She remembered she was Sienna Hart, eldest daughter of the prestigious Hart family of Vallaris.
At eighteen, a trip abroad had ended in a fiery plane crash. By some miracle, she survived, only to be found by a kind couple who, believing she had no one, adopted her and raised her as their own.
Now, at twenty-eight, the past had come rushing back. Her family was alive. The weight of that knowledge was a moral compass she couldn't ignore. She had to go home.
The flight was long, but sleep was a distant stranger. Sienna spent the hours piecing together the fractured memories of her family. It all felt like a bizarre, vivid dream from another lifetime.
*****
At ten past 10 at night, Sienna finally arrived in Vallaris. She hailed a cab, and the driver greeted her with thick Vallaris accent. ""Where to, Miss?""
A faint smile touched her lips. ""88 Maplecrest Avenue, please.""
""Well, I'll be,"" the driver said, catching her accent. ""You don't look local. I thought you were a tourist.""
Sienna's smile widened. ""I'm from here. It's just… ""
The smile faltered, a shadow of old pain and fresh hope passing through her eyes. ""It's been a long time.""
Ten years. A lifetime. Everything she knew was gone. She found herself thinking about her three little sisters—the giggles, the late-night chats, the way they used to huddle together on cold nights. 'Where are they now?' she wondered. 'Are they doing okay?'
As she sank into her memories, the driver kept chattering on how kids these days didn't visit their parents enough. He didn't stop talking until they finally pulled up to the address.
But as Sienna stepped out of the car, her eyes landed on a club she didn't recognize—Charmvale. She stared at the sign, her brow knitting together. The name felt strange in her mouth. The world had really gone on without her.
Just as she turned to leave, a heated argument at the club's entrance caught her eye. A man stood there, hands buried in his pockets lazily. He had the kind of face that spelled heartbreak, and his voice cut through the air like a blade, laced with cold indifference.
""Get it through your head,"" he was speaking to a young girl, who looked painfully thin in her simple dress. ""You're a stand-in. A substitute. Do I have to spell it out for you?""
The girl's eyes were rimmed with red, her pretty face blotched with tears. ""Mason, I already told you,"" she replied. ""I'm not feeling well, so I'm not going to the hospital to donate blood today.""
""Not feeling well?"" Mason Quinn let out a cruel laugh. He grabbed her chin, forcing her to meet his gaze. ""Is that why you're here, selling drinks? Or is it something else you're selling, Vivian?""
Vivian Hart's jaw tightened. With a sharp crack, her hand flew across his face.
""You're a monster, Mason,"" she spat, her voice trembling with rage. ""I've paid my debts. We're done. Now get away from me!""
Mason's head snapped to the side from the blow, but the cold grin never left his face. ""You don't get to decide when we're done,"" he scoffed. ""Did you forget? If it weren't for my family's engagement to yours three years ago, the Harts would've gone under. You want to walk away? Be my guest. But I wonder what your father would have to say about that.""
With that, he grabbed her arm, and started dragging her toward his car. ""If you want to keep playing the part of my fiancée, you'll do as you're told. Chloe needs your blood. It's the only thing you're good for, after all.""
A wave of utter despair washed over Vivian. She closed her eyes, defeated.
To her, it had always been this way. Three years ago, she'd believed he was her savior. She'd thought he truly cared. But it was all a lie. Mason had only seen her as a walking, breathing medicine cabinet for Chloe Zalton, the one he actually loved.
In the name of ""treatment,"" she had to go every month to donate blood for Chloe. And when she tried to put a stop to it, her own father slapped her for even bringing it up.
Just as Vivian was about to be pushed into the car, a cold, cutting voice sliced through the night. ""Let her go.""
Mason froze, turning to face a woman whose beauty was as breathtaking as the steel in her gaze.
""Who are you?"" Mason scowled. ""This is a private matter.""
But when Vivian heard that voice, the world seemed to shift beneath her feet. It was a voice she recognized deep in her soul, a voice from a life she believed had vanished forever.
She looked up, her body rigid with disbelief. The face—so familiar, so regal, so achingly missed—sent a tremor through her heart.
A trembling hand reached out, her own face a mask of shock. Her lips parted, and a single, fragile word escaped, a name she'd only dared to whisper in her dreams.
""Sienna?"" she mumbled. ""Is that you?""
Sienna's gaze softened as she looked at the broken girl before her. Vivian, her second sister, had been just fifteen when Sienna left. Now grown, she still carried that same spark in her eyes.
""It's me, Vivian,"" Sienna said, her voice a gentle balm. ""I'm back.""
""Sis!""
Vivian ripped her arm from Mason's grasp and threw herself into Sienna's embrace, sobbing as if her heart would break.
All the years of pain, of loneliness, of quiet desperation, came pouring out. She clung to Sienna like a drowning girl to a lifeline, shaking with fear that this was all a dream, another cruel trick of her mind.
Sienna held her tight, stroking her back. Her voice was a steady, warm anchor in the storm.
""It's okay,"" she murmured. ""I'm here now. I'm back, and I'm not going anywhere.""
Vivian cried until Sienna's shoulder was soaked, finally pulling back with a sniffle of embarrassment, her eyes puffy and red.
""Is this real?"" she whispered. ""You're really here? Am I still dreaming?""
Sienna's heart ached. ""It's real, Vivian. I'm really back."" And she swore she would burn the world to the ground before she ever left her again.
Meanwhile, Mason, who had been ignored for so long, was now utterly confused. 'Sis?' he wondered. 'Vivian didn't have a sister. She was the eldest… wasn't she?'
""Vivian, are you done with this melodrama?"" he chimed in. ""We're leaving. Now.""
But before he could finish the sentence, another sharp smack echoed in the night air. Mason stumbled, his head whipping to the side.
Sienna had hit him hard, without holding back. She'd been listening to his vile performance, her fury coiled like a snake in her gut.
What a joke,' Sienna thought. 'A substitute? Forced blood donations? What kind of sick, primetime drama is this?'
Then Mason called out Vivian's name, and Sienna strode forward. Though ten years had passed, she recognized Vivian instantly. Her pitiful, vulnerable look tugged at Sienna's heart.
Bullying her family right in front of her? To Sienna, that was the last straw. Mason might as well have been asking for trouble.
""What are you doing? Do you have any idea who I am?"" cried Mason. The slap had left him dazed, his cheek was numb and painful. ""I'm Vivian's boyfriend! Who do you think you are?""
Mason glared at the woman before him, but his bravado quickly faded. The woman standing there radiated a power that was genuinely terrifying. A cold dread crept over him.
""I'm her sister,"" Sienna pulled Vivian behind her, her voice deadly calm. ""And you just laid a hand on my family. So, tell me. Do you want to leave here walking, or crawling?""
Vivian sniffled, the fear instantly replaced by a surge of strength. Sienna was a fortress, and inside her walls, nothing could touch her.
""Sienna, I hate him,"" she whimpered, clinging to Sienna's arm. ""He's a bully.""
That was all Sienna needed to hear. She drove her foot into Mason's stomach, sending him sprawling to the pavement again.
""You… you'll pay for this!"" Mason gasped, yet he could do nothing but scramble away.
2.Chapter 2 A Gilded Cage No More
Steering Vivian away from the chaos, Sienna stopped at a quiet corner and gently dabbed at the lingering tears on her cheeks.
Vivian was not so short, but next to Sienna with those heels on, she looked as fragile as a porcelain doll.
""Don't cry, Vivian,"" Sienna said softly. ""Tell me what happened. Tell me everything.""
Vivian's shoulders shook with silent sobs. She didn't want to cry, but the injustice of it all was overwhelming.
Everyone had told her Sienna was dead—gone for ten years, a full decade of silence. But she never believed it. There were so many things she wanted to ask her.
Seeing Vivian so upset, Sienna decided to take her somewhere quiet to eat and talk. She took her to a cozy diner and ordered steaks for both of them. As the hot food arrived, Vivian's storm of emotions began to calm.
""Sienna… where were you these years?"" she wiped her face clean and finally asked the question that had been haunting her for years, ""They all said you were dead… ""
Vivian had never believed it—nor had the other sisters. Not the official story about the plane crash. But after ten years without a single word, even the strongest hope begins to fade.
A wave of guilt washed over Sienna. ""I thought I was dead, too,"" she admitted. ""By some miracle, I survived. A kind couple found me, adopted me.""
Watching Vivian's expression closely, she slowly continued, ""But I had amnesia. For ten years, I didn't know who I was. Then, three days ago, everything came rushing back. The moment it did, I booked a flight home to find you.""
Amnesia. That single word wiped away a decade of resentment. All the anger Vivian had held onto—for being abandoned, for being left alone—seemed to vanish into thin air.
""It's our fault. We should've found you sooner…"" Vivian's voice cracked as she looked across the table at Sienna, scared she might disappear like a ghost.
""Enough of that,"" Sienna said gently but firmly. ""Now, tell me about that Mason.""
""He's my ex. But we're over now,"" Vivian said, a little too quickly. She couldn't bear for Sienna to know the whole, humiliating story. ""Speaking of that, how about staying with me tonight?""
Sienna didn't push. If Vivian wouldn't tell her, she'd find out on her own. And anyone who had hurt her family would learn the true meaning of regret.
After they finished eating and talked a bit more, they left the diner. When they arrived at the address Vivian had given, Sienna stopped in her tracks. The building was a rundown walk-up in a rough part of town.
""Vivian, this is where you live?"" she asked, disbelief clear in her voice.
Their family home was a sprawling villa at No. 1 Southlake. Why was Vivian living here? Was this some misguided attempt at independence? Sienna felt a knot of confusion tighten in her chest.
Vivian couldn't meet her eyes. She had been thrown out of her home seven years ago. How could she possibly explain that?
""It's not so bad. Come on, let's go up!"" she said, leading Sienna upstairs.
Sienna followed silently, swallowing her questions. Just as Vivian reached for the door, a portly, greasy-looking man stepped forward, blocking their way.
""Vivian! Late on the rent again, I see,"" he boomed. ""You're six months behind! With utilities, you owe me two thousand bucks! And now you're bringing guests? Pay up!""
Vivian froze, her face a mixture of panic and shame as she glanced between the landlord and Sienna. She prayed he would just shut up.
""I've been patient with you, you know, 'cause you're a pretty little thing,"" the landlord continued. ""But you're pushing your luck! A girl who looks like you can't scrape together two grand? What a waste.""
His eyes roamed over Vivian with a possessive leer that sent a chill down Sienna's spine. It was clear he expected payment of a different kind, not money.
Just as Vivian opened her mouth to protest, Sienna stepped forward. She pulled a thick wad of cash from her purse and slammed it into the man's chest.
""Here's the rent,"" she said, her voice dripping with ice. ""Now get out of my sight before I do something we'll both regret.""
""Hey! Who do you think you are?"" the landlord sputtered, stunned by the cash. But before he could say more, Sienna had pulled Vivian inside and bolted the door.
""Sienna, I…"" Vivian stared at the floor, unable to look at the sister she'd always worshipped.
Sienna said nothing. She calmly set down her luggage, cracked open a window to let in the cool night air, and switched on the light.
The room was tiny, the furniture old, the walls peeling. But it was tidy and had a certain warmth to it. It was obviously a home, one Vivian had lived in for a long, long time.
She then turned to Vivian, studying her expression carefully for a moment. Her face was still sweet and round, her big, bright eyes just as striking as when she was little. Her long, straight hair fell like a curtain as she hung her head in shame.
In the end, Sienna simply opened her suitcase and asked, ""Do you want to shower first, or should I?""
""Huh?"" Vivian's mind went blank.
She'd been desperately trying to come up with a believable lie, a story to explain everything. But that simple, everyday question caught her completely off guard. She'd expected accusations. Demands. Not this.
She blinked, watching as Sienna picked up a silk pajama set and walked toward her. Then, without thinking, she squeezed her eyes shut.
She must be mad. She's going to hit me,' Vivian thought. 'And honestly… I deserve it. I'm so useless.'
She began to replay everything in her mind. After Sienna left, nothing stayed—she couldn't even go home. Their mother's belongings had all been taken over by that woman, and their father had changed too, twisted into someone unrecognizable.
It felt like she couldn't protect anything. Not even the Bartholomew Bear Sienna had loved so much—she hadn't managed to save that either. Her younger sisters had scattered, pulled in different directions, and she… she had failed them all.
But the slap never came. Instead, a gentle hand began to stroke her hair. Vivian's eyes shot open. Sienna was looking down at her, a soft smile on her face that seemed to warm the entire room, chasing away the shadows in Vivian's heart.
""You need a minute? I'll go first, then,"" Sienna said softly, and disappeared into the bathroom.
Vivian stood there, dazed, a slow, brilliant smile blooming across her face. She stared at the closed bathroom door, her heart filling with a feeling she hadn't known in ten years—hope.
A few minutes later, Sienna stepped out, wrapped in a cloud of steam and the soft scent of body lotion. Her skin glowed, and a silky, moon-white nightgown draped effortlessly over her graceful frame. Curls spilled over her shoulders, damp and tousled. She looked like she'd walked straight out of a dream.
Drying her hair with a towel, she caught Vivian staring, wide-eyed. Sienna let out a soft laugh and reached over to give her cheek a gentle, teasing pinch. ""Your turn, Vivian.""
Vivian blushed deep red, wishing she could sink right through the floor. She watched as Sienna sat down on the edge of the bed, and somehow, the drab little apartment seemed to change. The peeling walls, the dim light…it all faded into the background.
In that moment, the whole room felt like it had been made just to frame her. Sienna didn't belong in a place like this. She made it look like a palace.
Vivian's heart hammered in her chest. Sienna was even more beautiful than she remembered.
She really admired her—those curves, that graceful figure, the way she carried herself. Even as a girl, Vivian couldn't help but be a little jealous. She wondered if, all these years alone, any slimy men had tried to take advantage of her.
Just thinking about it made her blood boil, and her cheeks would puff up in frustration—like now, fresh out of the shower, looking like a little pufferfish.
3.Chapter 3 The First Night Home
Sienna had already dried her own hair and was leaning back against the headboard. Her expression was unreadable as she stared out the window, but when Vivian emerged from the bathroom, her gaze softened right away.
""Come here, Vivian,"" she patted the spot beside her. ""Let me dry your hair.""
Vivian wanted to refuse. Sienna had just come back, and she didn't want to trouble her. But Sienna's gentle, soothing voice drew her in before she could say no.
Before she knew it, she was sitting on the floor, leaning back with her head resting in Sienna's lap as the warm air from the hairdryer surrounded her.
It felt… so safe, Vivian thought. Her eyes fluttered closed in contentment, but then snapped open again.
She was terrified this was all a dream, a beautiful, fragile fantasy she would wake from at any moment. She drank in the sight of Sienna's face, her heart aching with a desperate question.
""Sienna,"" she asked, her voice barely a whisper. ""Are you going to leave again?""
Sienna's hands paused for a moment. ""No,"" she said softly but firmly. ""I'm not going anywhere.""
She had made up her mind. From now on, wherever she went, she would bring her sisters along.
Hearing this, a pure, overwhelming joy blossomed in Vivian's chest. Tears slipped down her cheeks, and Sienna reached down to wipe them away.
She knew Vivian must have suffered unimaginable pain in the years she was gone. She wouldn't press her for details. Not yet.
The rest of her life would be free of suffering, Sienna vowed silently. Because she was here now.
""Alright, go get the hand cream from my suitcase,"" she gently patted on Vivian's shoulder.
""Okay!"" Vivian bounced up, grabbing a pink tube from the suitcase. She watched curiously as Sienna uncapped it.
""Here,"" Sienna said. ""Give me your hands.""
Vivian held them out, and the cool touch of the white lotion against her skin felt like a spark to her heart.
""You have to take care of yourself,"" Sienna said gently as she rubbed the hand cream into Vivian's hands. ""That includes your hands, of course.""
Tears welled in Vivian's eyes as she bit her lip, trying to hold them back. She couldn't let herself cry again. She didn't want to push Sienna away.
She just gave a faint nod, her throat closing up. The cream smelled lovely, a gentle blend of fruit, flowers, and a trace of tea that lingered without being too sweet.
""This smells amazing,"" Vivian exclaimed, her eyes lighting up.
Sienna smiled. ""Just something I whipped up myself. If you like it, it's yours. Use it every morning and night.""
Vivian's face flushed. She shook her head quickly. ""No, I couldn't. It's yours.""
Before she could finish, Sienna pinched her cheek again. ""What's mine is yours. Now, put it away and get some sleep.""
Vivian nodded, slipping under the covers and immediately plastering herself to Sienna's side, clinging to her arm.
Just like when they were children, Sienna held her, patting her back gently until her breathing evened out.
It was the most peaceful night's sleep Vivian had had in ten years, wrapped in her sister's arms, just like old times.
Sienna was really home. She couldn't be more happy.
""Sienna…"" Vivian murmured in her sleep.
Sienna, her own eyes wide open in the darkness, gazed down at her. The carefully constructed dam around her own emotions finally broke, and a single, hot tear traced a path down her cheek.
Later that night, once she was sure Vivian was sound asleep, Sienna carefully slipped out of bed, and stepped over to the window to dial a number.
""It's me,"" she said to the phone, her voice cool and clipped. ""Lana, I need you to check on something. Pack a bag. You're coming to Solara. I'll be here for a while. Hand the company to the board.""
The next day, Vivian woke in a haze, a pleasant dream fading from her mind. Then reality crashed in, and she shot upright.
The other side of the bed was empty.
Was it all a dream? Had Sienna never really come back? She thought, disappointingly.
But then she caught the lingering floral scent on her hands, and her heart leaped with frantic hope.
She scrambled out of bed, her bare feet hitting the cold floor. The clatter of cookware grew louder as she neared the kitchen.
She rounded the corner just in time to see Sienna, wearing an apron, carrying two steaming plates out of the kitchen.
""Already up?"" Sienna asked, raising an eyebrow. ""It's only six. You should be sleeping in.""
Seeing her there—real, solid, and right in front of her—calmed the wild pounding in Vivian's chest. She didn't say a word, just stared at Sienna for a long moment.
""How many times have I told you? Don't run around without shoes, you'll catch a cold,"" Sienna noticed her bare feet and immediately went into big-sister mode. ""You're not a child anymore. Go put on some socks and slippers, now.""
The familiar nagging was the warmest sound Vivian had ever heard. She sniffled, nodding vigorously. ""Okay. I'll go get them right now.""
""Slippers and socks, then wash up,"" Sienna added. ""Breakfast is almost ready.""
""Okay!"" Vivian replied.
While abroad, Sienna's adoptive parents had hired a renowned chef from Solara to cater to her tastes. She had learned a few breakfast recipes herself, dishes that were both delicious and nourishing.
Watching Vivian dig into the food the moment they sat down, Sienna figured it must have turned out all right.
""Slow down,"" she said with a smile. ""No one's going to steal it from you.""
Vivian took a huge bite of the eggs. ""But this is just so good!""
""Here,"" Sienna passed her a napkin. ""So, Vivian, are you working now?""
The light in Vivian's eyes dimmed instantly. Her gaze shifted, a flicker of shame crossing her face, but she answered truthfully. ""Yes. I work at a company called Dynastis.""
""Dynastis? Fine."" Sienna just ruffled her hair. ""I'll give you a ride there later.""
As the second daughter of the Hart family, Vivna could have lived a life of leisure, coasting on the inheritance their mother had left them, but Sienna didn't ask why she was working.
There were so many questions, yet Sienna just held them back. She had already sent people to find the answers.
By the end of the day, she'd know everything. Her sisters might not say a word, but that didn't mean she, as their older sister, would stay in the dark. And if she found out anyone had laid a hand on them, she would make them pray for a quick death.
""No, Sienna, you don't have to!"" Vivian protested. ""You should rest. I can take the bus, it's really fast.""
Sienna gave a wry smile. ""Are you embarrassed to be seen with me?""
Vivian's eyes went wide. She shook her head frantically. ""No! Not at all! I would never think that! I just… I don't want to trouble you.""
She looked down, ashamed. The truth is, she was afraid she would embarrass Sienna. At Dynastis, she was just… a nobody.
""I'm your sister. It's never a trouble,"" Sienna replied. As she spoke, her phone rang. She picked it up and stepped aside while Vivian continued her breakfast.
""It's me,"" she said firmly into the phone. After a brief pause, she finally added, ""Good. Understood.""
When they went downstairs, the portly landlord was waiting, his face split in a sycophantic grin. He greeted them with an enthusiasm that was a world away from his venomous tirade the day before. His eyes, however, lingered disgustingly where they shouldn't.
Sienna shot him a look so sharp and cold it could have cut glass. The man's smile froze, and a flicker of fear entered his eyes. He quickly looked away.
I'll deal with you later, Sienna thought, her eyes turning to ice.
She led Vivian outside the building. Parked beside the shabby apartment building was a crimson Rolls-Royce. Vivian couldn't help but stare.
She didn't know much about cars, but she knew this one was custom, and its price tag would have more commas than she could count. It was so out of place it was almost comical.
""Come on,"" Sienna said, walking towards it. ""Get in.""
""Huh?"" Vivian blinked in surprise. Get in? She processed her words. The only other vehicle nearby was a shared bike. Was Sienna planning to pedal her to work?
Confused but obedient, she started walking toward the bike. Sienna sighed, grabbed her hand, and pulled her toward the luxury car.
""This way. Get in,"" said Sienna. ""Or you'll be late.""
4.Chapter 4 A Game Of Push And Pull
Vivian stared at the open car door, her mouth agape. She looked from the car to Sienna and back again, swallowing hard.
""Wait, Sienna,"" she pointed a trembling finger. ""Is this car yours?""
""Yes,"" Sienna nodded. ""If you like it, it's yours. By the way, do you know how to drive?""
Vivian just shook her head, still trying to process it. One moment, Sienna owned a Rolls-Royce, and the next, she was offering to let her drive it. This was just too much.
Before her brain could fully process it, her body was already moving, sinking into the plush leather of the passenger seat. They'd been driving for a few minutes before the reality finally hit her.
""Sienna!"" Vivian exclaimed, her voice buzzing with excitement. ""This is really your car! Where did you get all this money? Oh—wait, that's not what I meant. You're incredible, of course you'd be successful!""
But this was beyond successful. She screamed inside. This car had to be worth a hundred or two hundred million, at least!
Sienna just smiled, the morning light catching the angles of her exquisite face. ""You really think I'm that capable?""
""Of course!"" Vivian declared proudly. ""You are the most brilliant woman in the entire world! You've always been my idol.""
From a young age, Sienna had been a prodigy. She was always first in her class, with perfect scores in every subject. She'd been the top when applying for college.
And as for looks, she had been crowned the number one beauty in Vallaris. Their entire family was blessed with good genes; their mother and grandmother were both legendary beauties and scholars in their own right.
""You're amazing too,"" Sienna said quietly.
The simple words made Vivian freeze, her heart skipping a beat.
Me? Amazing? she wondered silently. But she had let Sienna down. She felt like a failure.
""You can just drop me off at the corner up ahead,"" she said, her voice suddenly small. ""My office is just a short walk from there.""
""Alright,"" Sienna agreed, pulling the car over. A message notification lit up her phone. It was Lana. Who had just arrived Vallaris.
""What time do you get off? I'll pick you up,"" Sienna said, handing Vivian a sleek black business card. ""Here's my number. Take it.""
Vivian nodded, quickly adding the contact, labeling it simply: Sienna.
She walked toward her office, her heart light and happy. But then she spotted someone standing guard at the company entrance—Mason, dressed in a sharp blue suit. He kept glancing at his watch, his expression tight with impatience.
Vivian knew he was waiting for her, but she ignored him and walked straight past.
""Vivian!"" Mason's voice snapped as he saw her pass without so much as a glance. Anger flared inside him, but Vivian didn't break her stride—she walked straight into the building.
Furious, Mason grabbed her arm, yanking her back. ""Have I been too good to you? You dare to ignore me?"" he roared. ""You think just because someone helped you last night, you can defy me?""
Vivian shook him off. ""Mason, we're broken up. From now on, we have nothing to do with each other. Stay away from me.""
Mason was momentarily speechless. He took a breath, trying to regain control. ""Look, I'm giving you one last chance. Apologize, come to the hospital with me right now, and I'll still be your boyfriend.""
Vivian didn't answer but let out a scornful laugh.
This was the man she once thought she loved. When she first met him, she'd been drawn to his seemingly endless kindness. He had been a light in her darkness, giving her the courage to live when she felt most helpless.
But in the end, he had wounded her again and again. The moment his precious Chloe Zalton so much as whimpered, it was always Vivian's fault.
""Mason, you're delusional. Starting today, I will never donate another drop of my blood to Chloe,"" replied Vivian. ""Get that through your head. Your family has always wanted to call off the engagement, right? Fine. Let's do it. I don't want the title of your fiancée anyway.""
Sienna was back. Vivian knew she didn't have to be afraid of anyone.
Mason sneered. ""Vivian, there's a limit to these games. Did you really think a pathetic little trick like this would work on me? I have a gala tonight. Be there.""
With that, he turned and left, confident in his victory. He believed Vivian couldn't break up with him. She loved him too much. How could she possibly want to end the engagement?
It was just a game of push and pull, he told himself. A way to get attention. All women were like that.
Vivian rolled her eyes. She brushed off the sleeve he had touched, her expression one of utter disgust. 'Mason, how stupid was I to ever give you the impression that I couldn't live without you?' she sighed quietly, then headed back to her office.
Meanwhile, inside Vivian's rented apartment, a glass shattered against the wall. Several documents lay scattered across the table. Standing before Sienna was a woman with blonde hair and piercing blue eyes, dressed in a sharp black business suit.
""S—"" the woman called out, but Sienna cut her off.
""I told you,"" Sienna said, her voice dangerously low. ""From now on, you will call me Miss Enna. And I don't want my identity revealed. I trust you understand that.""
""Yes, Miss Enna. My apologies,"" Lana Yost, Sienna's assistant for years, replied quickly.
Sienna clentched her fist, eyes blazing with fury. 'Aiden, how dare you treat Vivian like that?' she muttered under her breath. 'You're dead. Just wait—tonight, I'll make you wish you'd never been born.'
""Miss Enna, shall I acquire the Hart Corporation?"" Lana chimed in. ""It's in chaos right now, and its development has stagnated. It would take half a month at most.""
Sienna waved her hand dismissively, her cool, indifferent eyes glinting like sharp ice. ""Not yet. For now, buy up this entire block. And put this building in Vivian Hart's name.""
""Yes, Miss Enna,"" Lana replied. As she turned to leave, Sienna stopped her. ""One more thing.""
Lana nodded, ""Yes, Miss Enna?""
""Throw this out,"" Sienna carefully wrapped the shards of broken glass in a handkerchief. ""And buy me a same one.""
Lana was confused. The handkerchief alone was worth ten times more than the cheap glass. But she obeyed without question. Miss Enna always had her reasons.
Once she'd calmed down, Sienna picked up her phone and sent Vivian a message: [Are you tired? I'm bringing you a Silkstone Espresso.]
After getting Sienna's text, Vivian left the building on time to meet her after work. She was usually the ever-compliant one, but this time she was the first to leave—much to her manager's annoyance.
Silkstone Expresson was her favorite drink. Sitting inside Sienna's car, she took the coffee cup and took a sip. A familiar ache, bittersweet and comforting, filled her chest. After Sienna had left, she had never again tasted her favorite drink.
Now she was back, and so was this small piece of happiness.
""Thanks, Sienna."" Vivian grinned, her pure, pretty face radiating joy.
Sienna reached out and brushed her bangs aside. The Harts were all stunning. Vivian had a delicate, beautiful face with the soft lines of an oval shape, gentle brow bones, and large eyes that shone with innocence.
But Sienna knew that Vivian was always too sensible, too used to swallowing her grievances and burying her pain.
""Let's get you a conditioning treatment. Your hair is looking a little frizzy,"" said Sienna. ""Then we'll go to the mall and buy you some new clothes.""
Vivian wanted to refuse, to say she didn't have any money. But she couldn't bring herself to spoil Sienna's mood.
When had she—Vivian Hart, the second daughter of the family—become so timid? She didn't even understand herself. Maybe it started the day she was thrown out of her home with nothing to her name.
As if sensing her hesitation, Sienna's voice softened.
""Vivian, I know I was gone for ten years. I know you all suffered after I left,"" she added. ""But I promise you, from this day forward, you'll never endure another injustice. So please, don't treat me like a stranger, okay?""
5.Chapter 5 The ""Stolen"" Black Card
""No! That's not it. I've never thought that!"" Vivian said, her voice choked with emotion. How could she ever not acknowledge her sister? Even in death, she would never disown Sienna. ""I just don't want to be a bother. I'm sorry.""
Sienna's expression softened. ""From now on, you tell me everything. We're family. There's no such thing as being a 'bother.' You girls are the only family I have left. If you push me away, I don't know what I came back for.""
Vivian's eyes filled with tears as she nodded fiercely.
After a luxurious hair treatment, they headed straight to the mall. Sienna stepped away to take a call, leaving Vivian to browse and try on clothes on her own.
Then, out of nowhere, two women walked in. Their eyes locked onto Vivian, surprise flashing across their faces before twisting into matching sneers of contempt.
""Well, well, if it isn't the lovely Miss Vivian Hart,"" one of them drawled, sauntering over. ""Long time no see. Shopping for new clothes?""
Vivian recognized them. They were her classmates from before, Bella Lewis and Marcy Walker. As soon as she spotted them, her good mood vanished. She turned her back on them without a word.
""Come on, Vivian,"" Bella cooed, blocking her path. ""Is that any way to greet an old friend?""
She covered her mouth with a hand, giggling as she looked Vivian up and down. 'She reeks of poverty,' thought Bella. 'The nerve, showing up here like this.'
""Oh, don't you know, Bella? She's too good for us now,"" Marcy chimed in. ""By the way, Vivian, did you hear? Mason's precious Chloe is threatening to move abroad. Mason rushed to the airport to stop her—it was all over the news.""
Vivian didn't want to engage. She tried to step around them, but Bella blocked her again. ""Where're you going? Marcy is talking to you.""
Vivian rolled her eyes. ""I don't waste my breath on people I don't know.""
""What?"" Bella's face flushed with anger. ""Vivian, do you still think you're the Hart's princess? Everyone knows you were kicked out! If you weren't clinging to Mason for dear life, you think he ever would have gotten engaged to you?""
""What's it to you?"" Vivian retorted.
""She's right, Bella, it's none of our business,"" Marcy pulled the fuming Bella back, but her eyes landed on the dress in Vivian's hands, ""However, we've taken a liking to that dress.
She then turned to the clerk, pointing at the dress in Vivian's hand, ""Salesclerk! Wrap it up for us.""
The salesclerk looked apologetic. ""I'm very sorry, but this lady has already decided to purchase this dress. Perhaps you'd like to look at something else?""
""What did you say?"" Marcy snapped. ""Do you know who I am? She's just a low-level office worker. Her monthly salary wouldn't even cover a pair of my socks. This dress is nearly five thousand dollars. Are you sure she can afford it?""
This clueless clerk is going to regret this, thought Marcy to herself.
The clerk maintained her professional smile. ""I'm sorry, Miss Walker.""
""Do you want to get fired?"" Marcy barked. ""I can have the manager fire you on the spot!""
The clerk looked uneasy. She didn't know Vivian personally, but she recognized the woman who had just walk in with Vivian—someone who'd worn a globally exclusive, custom-made piece, the kind of client even brand executives respected. Having worked in luxury retail for over a decade, she knew her brands inside and out.
And that was why she stood her ground, refusing to sell the dress to Marcy and Bella.
The manager, hearing the commotion, hurried over. Seeing Bella and Marcy, his face immediately broke into a sycophantic grin.
""Miss Lewis! Miss Walker! So good to see you!"" he said warmly. ""My clerk here is new. She doesn't know any better. Please, don't mind her. It's just a dress, right?""
Then he turned to the clerk. ""If the ladies want it, wrap it up for them! What are you dawdling for?""
""But, sir,"" the clerk protested, gestured Vivian, ""this lady saw it first, and she said she was buying it.""
""She said she was buying it, which means she hasn't paid yet,"" the manager emphasized, turning to Vivian, ""Miss, are you sure you want this dress? If so, you'll need to pay now.""
Vivian didn't flinch. ""I haven't finished shopping,"" she said coolly. ""Why are you rushing me to pay? That's not your policy.""
The manager couldn't have cared less about store policy. To him, Bella and Marcy were high society, while Vivian—dressed in clothes that probably cost less than thirty dollars total—was just putting on a show.
""Vivian, there's no discount on this one."" Bella taunted. ""Are you sure you want to buy it? I doubt you make that much in a year.""
""That's none of your concern,"" Vivian replied.
""If you want it, pay for it,"" Marcy added, ""If you don't, it's not yours. It's a simple concept.""
""Indeed, Miss,"" the manager said. ""Please proceed to payment.""
A flicker of scorn crossed Vivian's face. They were so quick to judge, but they didn't know she had the black card. Before leaving, Sienna had left the card for her.
She pulled out the black card, and, just as expected, Bella and Marcy's eyes widened in disbelief.
""That's impossible!"" Bella shrieked, her composure shattering. ""Where did you get a black card? You can't possibly have one!""
The manager's jaw dropped. He stared at the card in her hand. It was a global, unlimited black card—the symbol of the truly, unfathomably wealthy.
""My deepest apologies, Miss!"" his attitude did a complete one-eighty. ""I was out of line just now, please forgive me! Is there anything else you need? Please, take your time, look at all our new arrivals. No rush at all.""
Marcy, however, suddenly had a realization. She pointed at the card, a look of triumph on her face. ""I see! Vivian, you stole someone's credit card! I'm calling the police! You can explain it to them.""
Marcy was one hundred percent certain the card was stolen. Even with the Quinn family's standing in Vallaris, Mason's branch of the family couldn't possibly possess a black card. The Harts were even less likely.
There was only one explanation. It had to be stolen.
Vivian sneered. ""Are you insane, Marcy? Go ahead, try stealing one yourself.""
Marcy gritted her teeth. She had always hated Vivian's smug attitude.
""Vivian, you can't have a card like that,"" Bella insisted. ""If it's not stolen, it must be a fake.""
""Yes, it has to be fake!"" Marcy chimed in, turning to the manager. ""I'm warning you. She's just a broke office worker. If she can't pay, we're not buying that dress.""
The manager's smile faltered, his doubts returning. Just then, without another word, Bella snatched the dress from Vivian's hands.
Caught off guard, Vivian instinctively held on tight. There was a sickening rip sound as the fabric tore.",1,1753679493.0,u_WeakResult6194,0,1.0,False

That’s how *no code automation* feels these days, and honestly, I can’t get enough of it!

For the longest time, automation felt like asking a wizard for favors – possible but arcane (and often super expensive). You’d hear about APIs and webhooks and your brain would start buffering, right? Then, out came no code tools, and suddenly we’re all the Gandalf of our own digital realms!

Here’s why I’m completely hooked:

- No more begging devs for “just a quick script”
- Cloud-based dashboards at the speed of your morning coffee
- Zapping repetitive tasks right out of your workday

A few examples that have wowed me (and saved hours of my time!):

- Automatically send personalized onboarding emails to new clients as soon as their details pop into a Google Sheet.
- Have an AI analyze customer reviews and update a Notion database with actionable categories.
- Transform Twitter DMs into Trello cards with a click (Honestly, this one blew my mind!).

It turns work from drudgery to ✨ tinkering ✨. There's something deeply satisfying about connecting a couple of tools, clicking “Test,” and seeing data just flow effortlessly.

But the coolest part? No code automation throws open doors for *everyone.* Your role, coding experience, even budget don’t matter anymore. You can:

- Launch your side project in a weekend
- Help your grandma streamline her gardening club emails
- Free up so much brain space that you finally get to focus on what *actually* excites you

Of course, there are trade-offs and occasional bumps. Sometimes a beta integration might flop, or you’ll find yourself tangled in a web of too-many-zaps. But even those feel like badges of progress!

So, here are my burning questions for the community:

- What automations have *you* built lately that just keep you smiling?
- Have any small “wins” unlocked sudden *big* opportunities?
- Where do you think no code is headed next? (Is it too optimistic to dream of AI-powered, *one-click* workflow builders?)

Share your stories, tips, and discoveries! Let’s celebrate the revolution where the only real “prerequisite” is curiosity and a spark of excitement. I can’t wait to see what everyone’s automating! 🚀",1,1753679441.0,GPTAppsEngine,0,1.0,False

I’m a 32-year-old married Indian man from Vancouver, Canada. Life's been busy lately, and I'm looking to relax and unwind with some good conversation. I’m hoping to connect with a like-minded lady who’s up for a chat. I'm open to all kinds of conversations—whether you just want someone to listen, enjoy a platonic exchange, or you're feeling a little adventurous, I’m here for it.

About me: I’m known to be fun, especially if you’re the calm and fun type too. I’m well-educated, soft-spoken, and generally considered a nice guy. Not tall, but fit—I run a lot. I’d say I’m fairly good-looking and happy to share a photo. I enjoy reading, watching YouTube, and being outdoors—hiking and weekend walks are my thing. I'm also a huge fan of coffee, chips, chocolate, and ice cream. I don’t drink or smoke, and I prefer one-on-one chats over group settings or parties.

All ages, races, locations, time zones, and relationship statuses are welcome to message me. I just ask that you’re respectful and genuinely want to chat.

Thanks!",2,1753679304.0,MeetNewPeopleHere,0,1.0,False
1mb7j6g,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepcast/comments/1mb7j6g/i_miss_my_skin/,I Miss My Skin,"Have you ever been in love? I mean, REALLY in love. It's the kind of thing that will move your spirit to do things you never thought possible, to feel deeper than your heart knew it could.  Its an impossible love, something no one will ever understand but you. And that's how I felt about her. 

We were classmates in middle school, and as we advanced each school year, I gradually noticed signs of her interest in me. She began to look at me like I were a star in the night sky, she would sit next to me at lunch a little closer each day as if I were a warm hearth at Christmastime. She even asked me to prom before I got the chance to even think of asking anyone else. I felt special as we danced, but I only wanted to be friends. At least that's what I tried to convince myself.

Looking back, I wanted her badly. But fear of what our parents might think, us dating during school, me being 18 and her 16, pushed me away from her. We would see each other at a writing club we made with our other classmates and our teacher, and she was close friends with my sister so I got to chat with her about mundane things like anime and sibling drama. All the while my love grew, and my convictions and fear choked it. Eventually she went to the same community college as me and by this time I had fully embraced my impossible love for her. There was a formal dance for graduates, and I had asked if I could take her. She said she was going with friends, but decided to go with me. It was the happiest night of my life, but sitting here remembering it all, she wasn't always present when we danced, and her flattery was forced. Maybe she still felt interested in me? Maybe she felt bad that I hadn't moved on and tried to force herself to feel the same thing? Maybe she played me because she felt empty and unwanted?

I'd say, it was a bit of all three.

Between classes I would sit with her and her new friends. One of them was obviously into her, and I paid no mind at the time. I was still convinced she loved me like I loved her. But as the semester dragged on, and she only wanted to be near me in groups, I saw the truth. I again forced away my love, and it became bitter and agonizing. It got worse when her friends, especially the one who was into her, would welcome me into their conversations, only to tease and try to make me look like an idiot whenever I shared my thoughts. She would laugh at me along with them.

I gave in to sorrow then. My grades plummeted, I skipped class. I got a girlfriend, just for the to of us to break it off months later because I couldn't get over my old love. I got drunk that night, my first time. God, the hangover. I called my old crush, my old prom date, the young woman who teased my heart with affection and then spat on my soul. I told her how I felt, and how I remembered her signals and how she asked me to prom. She acted like none of it mattered, like she never felt anything like that for anyone. At the time I accepted her response and hung up after she advised me to ""date myself"". That's when the love in my heart died, and it took all happiness with it, replacing it with bitter hate and mourning sorrow. I turned to alcohol again, and nicotine, and porn, anything I could find to numb myself. It was never enough. I buried my mind in fiction, books, games, tv. What I watched became darker and darker, what I read became more macabre and horrifying. I heard the whispers then.

They scared me at first, but gradually they assured me they were here to help. I accused them of being demons, or bad thoughts from endless solitude. But the more I ignored them, the louder they got. Then I saw pictures in my head of what some of them looked like. They met me in sleep, and my nightmares followed me into the waking world little by little. I began to learn that these ""shadows"" really were trying to help me. They too knew pain and sorrow, and had long ago found ways to truly numb themselves as I wished to. Eventually I asked them how I could escape my broken heart. I dreamt of symbols and pages from books that didn't exist and some that did. I drew what I saw, making it real. They taught me to speak what I wrote, in tongues unknown to man. The mantras I wrote became my stronghold. Eventually I discovered the real books I had been told of in sleep. I found the Lemegeton, the Liber Iuratus Honorii, the Book of St. Cypian. I studied the incantations and names and rituals. I contacted the entities in every book, careful not to miss any steps, not to perform any acts that involved sacrifice, not to tell anyone of my practice. 

And then I met it. Eeortheol. 

I was talking to my shadow, my actual shadow. I wanted to practice my own magic, like the other ""shadows"" instructed me to. They said that self-made magic is the strongest. So I focused on my heart, drew power from my source, and waited for inspiration. I felt the need to talk to my shadow, so I turned on a lamp in my room and talked to it. I used phrases in Latin and Hebrew and Aramaic, but I felt no power in them. So I used the tongues the entities taught me. I felt a stir, but nothing beyond that. Then, I felt my mouth move on its own, and I spoke in my own language. My mind screamed at me to stop, my chest ached. The lamp flickered, my floorboards creaked. My shadow stood up. It walked to me, its own form.

It spoke in a deep, enchanting voice. It asked me if it knew me. I tried to talk, but I felt drained and feverish. My shadow cocked its head, then asked if I knew it. The name erupted from my gut, ""EEORTHEOL!"", I screamed. It took me up in the air and held me firmly. I felt both loved and hated, both powerful and powerless. 

""Speak our desire, my dearest self"", it rumbled.

""I....I....""

I couldn't remember anything, there was only gripping fear and intoxicating power. Eeortheol shook me, then plopped me on the floor, sitting in front of me. It waited. I shivered, then grew calm. I had seen spirits far worse than it, more aggressive. And I had communed with them far more easily. I grew calm and sat up.

""I trust you know what I am fighting within, since you claim to be myself""

It nodded, pointing to its chest with one hand, and then to my pocket. I pulled out my wallet. I opened it, where the picture of the woman I loved and I were at prom. I teared up, nodding.

Eeortheol beat its chest and bellowed in anguish, and I knew then it was truly mine. Truly me. I took a deep breath, tore the photo apart, and looked at my shadow. At myself.

""Make me stop feeling. Kill my emotions. Destroy my anguish."" I whispered haggardly.

Eeortheol stood up. Horns grew from its head, and it gave me its hand. I stood and took it. Then I woke up in bed. My pain was gone. My love was gone. I was free. I forced a smile. But there was no joy. I wasn't bothered by this. I wasn't bothered by anything. I went to work and got everything done ahead of schedule. I was a machine. I got everything on my to do list done overnight. For a year my performance tripled. Without emotions there were no worries. Without worries nothing held me back. I could do whatever I had been afraid to do. Except, I had no desires anymore. There was no ambition to climb the ladder of society, no drive to get promoted at work. I had no dreams, no hopes, no wants. I was a husk. People started to notice. They noticed even faster than when I unexpectedly became more productive. I would have been offended, but I just kept slowing down. There was no meaning in life, and that no longer bothered me. Nothing did. It didn't even bother me that nothing bothered me. I stopped going to work on time, stopped getting up early. Everything felt slow and heavy, but it didn't hurt so I didn't care. I couldn't care if I tried. Eeortheol saw to that. Soon I never left home. Coworkers and friends and family reached out. I ignored them. There was no reason to respond after all. They could give me nothing, they could take away nothing. I stayed in bed, never eating, never sleeping. My body grew weaker and weaker. Finally, I had no memories of emotions. No memories of love, hate, pride, envy, joy, sorrow. And my mind, hungry for answers as it was when I began my spiraling descent, wondered what it would be like to feel again. I no longer felt aversion or dread, so nothing kept me from calling out the name of my shadow, my savior, my dearest self

""Eeortheol..."" I croaked.

It leaned up beside me, then got off the bed and stood by my head

""Speak our curiosity, my dearest self"" it rumbled

I sat up on my bed, and noticed it had red glowing eyes along with its horns. It seemed taller too. But I didn't care, it meant nothing to me.

""I struggle to remember what feelings are like again. Return what I gave away. Satisfy my mind's hunger. Reignite my heart""

Eeortheol held out its hand. I took it. I woke up in the shower. Blood mucus and vomit dripped from my lips. I moaned as I felt again. Despair at my apathy at work, longing to see my friends and hold my family again, the impossible love I once held ripping me apart. I looked down, and in the shower water I saw bits of flesh and phlegm swirling around the drain. I lurched and hurled out pieces of my insides, I felt slippery sludge spewing from my ass. My skin peeled off like slime, my flesh dropped from my bones like wads of soaked tissues, my brains leaked from my ears and nose like spoiled milk. I could no loner scream, no longer move, no longer breathe. My world was void, then hell, then ended in a single day.

I wake up for the final time in a heap. Cloth is swirled around me. Its dark, I can't see. I can't hear, or smell, or feel. I know somehow I'm dead. I know somehow I'm in a coffin. I know somehow they're all up there, mourning over my fresh grave. I know somehow, that Eertheol isn't coing back. I still dream of him now. Now he has wings, and a mouth. He seeks out another poor soul, lost in the caverns of their broken heart as I was. She is hounded by the whispers like I was. She wants to stop feeling like I did. I dream of the name that I shall forever hate as I lay here waiting for time to end; ""Eeorteol"". Here in a purgatory of my own making I begin to miss things. I miss my house, I miss my mother, I miss my job, I miss my friends, I miss my life. I miss the smell of rain. I miss the taste of coffee. I miss the sight of words on a page. I miss the sound of music. I miss the feeling of her hands on my shoulders and my hands on her waist when we danced during prom. Its silly that I miss these small things. I know too late now that, these are what make life worth it, why despair and heartbreak are worth it. Memories and small comforts. Dammit all. I miss my hair, I miss my feet, I miss my eyes, my ears. I miss my skin...",3,1753679302.0,creepcast,1,1.0,False
1mb7j0p,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1mb7j0p/a_customer_is_sending_me_photos_of_missing_people/,A Customer Is Sending Me Photos Of Missing People,"I own and operate my own print shop.

Most of the orders I receive from people are online, usually including wedding invitations, custom stickers, awkward school photos, and designed posters we ship off once they're printed and packaged up. Admittedly, owning a print shop isn't the most exciting career in the world, but it puts food on the table for me and my family.

Last Monday, I came into work and started by looking at my backlog of customer emails. The first one I saw when I booted up my computer was from an ID named facelisting@finalproofs.co.

The email read, ""I need these images printed at 11x14 on matte paper (200 gsm). Each page needs to have a half-inch white border around the photo. Then, I need you to bind them with coils into a book. I want a front page for this book with a title in the center that reads, in cursive, 'Faces in Passing: Volume 1'. Let me know how much I owe you for one copy. Accuracy is critical.""

Very specific. This person knew what they wanted.
Attached to the email was a zip file with about thirty pictures, each photo of a different person. None of them particularly resembled fashion models; they looked like ordinary people.

Some men and women looked to be in their 20s, 30s, 40s, or higher. There were also a few kids and teenagers in the collection.

I figured it must've been for a community-related project, like some college kid's photography class or something. Some shots were close-ups of people smiling, others appeared to be photographed from a little further away, and a few looked like drawings.

The sketched ones irked me a little. But as long as this person paid me, I didn't see any real issue.

I emailed them back, ""Good afternoon! Shouldn't be an issue. An estimate of one copy with shipping will cost approximately $28.42. Here's a link to where you can send your payment.""

Immediately, I got an alert on my phone for one payment of $28.42. So, I printed off the book and got it all ready, then a USPS worker came and picked it up along with the other packages that UPS didn't pick up.

Done, and done.

The next morning, I woke up bright and early to find my wife sitting in the living room and drinking her morning coffee. She was looking at her phone while the news played on the TV.

""Authorities are still struggling to locate 27-year-old Sarah Mitchell, who was last seen leaving her apartment on Upper Glenway two weeks ago. She's described as 5'6, with brown hair and green eyes. Anybody with information is urged to contact the local police department immediately. Family and friends are deeply concerned for her safety and are praying that she comes back home soon. Here's a photo of the missing person,"" said the news anchor.
I looked over at the TV and saw her face. She looked familiar.

It took me a minute to realize I had seen her before. I saw her in the file that the unknown email sent me yesterday.

Why would this person send me a photo of a missing person?

I got to work after that, and out of curiosity, I pulled that file up again. Looking through, I stumbled on Sarah's photo again.

Doing reverse image searches on some others revealed something cryptic to me. They were all missing people.

Haunting portraits of these lost individuals illuminated my screen. Some of these were Jane or John Does; they were never identified.

Whoever was on the other end of this email was using these pictures for something. Whatever that was, it was beyond me.

Were they somehow connected to the missing persons? I took everything I had to the police right away.

An officer said he looked into the email, but it was untraceable, and the address I sent the package to was a house with no residents.

I asked if there was anything else they could do, but he told me they couldn't do anything since no crime had been committed.

A week or so went by when I received another email from them.

""I need another book. Same deal as before, but this time put 'Volume 2' instead. Only one copy is needed. Payment has been sent,"" they said.

Before I responded to this, I looked at the zip file attached. One of the pictures was of my wife.

I panicked and pulled my phone out to call her, but she didn't pick up. I called so many times, but still no response.

I sped home, but couldn't find her anywhere when I got home. Her car was still here, and her phone, purse, and keys were on the living room table.

It's been weeks, and I haven't heard anything regarding my wife. The police have been no help; they keep telling me there are no leads and they can do nothing.

I reached out to the mysterious email and pleaded with them. I said I would even pay money if that's what they wanted.

The only response I got was another request for a book. When I opened the attachment this time, I saw a police sketch among the other missing people.

by [https://www.gptsportswriter.com](https://www.gptsportswriter.com) **CF Montreal vs. Atlanta United FC: A Same-Game Parlay for the Ages**  
*Where hope is a scarce resource and spreads are even scarcer*

Let’s cut to the chase: **CF Montreal is the NHL of soccer**—a league where the only thing more abundant than losses is the existential dread of fans who bought season tickets in 2012. The “last match” they won (3-1 vs. New England) was so recent it’s practically yesterday’s news. Meanwhile, **Atlanta United** is the overconfident barista who always over-caffeinates your order. They’re not *necessarily* going to burn you, but you’d be a fool to trust them with decaf.

### Parsing the Odds: A Tale of Two Teams

The numbers scream louder than Montreal’s home crowd. Atlanta’s moneyline odds hover around **2.35-2.50** (implied probability: \~40-43%), while Montreal’s sits at **2.70-2.80** (\~36-37%). The draw? A paltry **3.25-3.35** (\~30-31%). That’s not a draw—it’s a cry for help.

The spread tells an even darker story. Atlanta is a **-0.5 favorite**, meaning they’re expected to win by *at least* a goal. Take the underdog, Montreal, at **+0.5** (odds: \~1.51-1.82), and you’re essentially betting they’ll lose 0-1 to a team that’s basically a caffeinated toddler with a soccer ball.

The total goals line is **2.5**, with **Over** priced at **1.62-1.82** and **Under** at **2.02-2.16**. Given Montreal’s leaky defense (they’ve allowed 18 goals in their last six games) and Atlanta’s… *enthusiastic* attack (they’ve scored 14 in the same span), this feels like a “will the toddler spill coffee on someone?” bet. Spoiler: Yes.

However, the sound of their moaning and groaning in pleasure could be heard through the thin walls.

Tomorrow was her eighteen birthday, but her parents went away, leaving her with only Thea and like the other night, Dristan would come to visit her.

Couldn’t hold it back any longer, Rhea frowned and got off the bed to talk to her sister, whose bedroom was right next to her.

“Thea, can you keep it down? I am trying to sleep.” Rhea knocked on her bedroom’s door.

There was rustling sound from inside the bedroom before someone opened the door, but it was not her older sister, but the alpha, Dristan Black. He was only on his boxer and the smell of sex was so profound from this room, which made Rhea wrinkled her nose.

“I am sorry for the noise, I will try to keep it down,” Dristan said in his deep voice. His blue eyes showed no emotions when he spoke.

This was not the first time for Rhea to meet Dristan, since Thea had been in relationship with him for more than two years, but the fact that both of them was not mate, didn’t settle well with everyone in the pack, yet since it was the alpha that they were talking about, no one would dare to raise their objection.

“Anything else?” Dristan ran his fingers through his curly, black hair, which looked messy.

“No, thank you,” Rhea murmured and then stepped back.

“Rhea,” Dristan called her before she entered her room.

“Hm?” Rhea tilted her head. Both of them didn’t really talk much and kept their relationship civil. Dristan was seven years older than her and she had known him, since she was a little girl, because Thea and him were best friend before they became lover, ditching the tradition for the werewolf to wait for their destined mate.

“Happy birthday,” Dristan said in solemn voice.

“It’s not yet past midnight,” Rhea replied and then immediately entered her bedroom, Thea would make a fuss if she was so much as talking to him for a long time.

And after that, the rest of the night was a little bit quiet, though she still could hear Thea’s moan and how she talked dirty to Dristan.

It happened occasionally, especially when their parents went away.

“Good morning,” Thea said as she yawned and put something on the table, she stretched her arms and then nudged Rhea’s shoulder. “Happy birthday.”

“Thank you.” There was nothing special, no hug, no kiss and her birthday was like any other day.

“There, gift from me and Dristan.” Thea nodded at the small box on the table, which wrapped in blue wrapping paper.

Rhea turned her body around, she was washing dishes, thus she couldn’t take a look of her gift immediately. “I am sure the gift is from the alpha, not you.” She could guess that so easily, since her sister was not fond of giving someone else gift, except for the alpha.

Thea clicked her tongue. “You should pretend that you are happy with the gift. You know right, I am not a big fans of giving a gift.”

Rhea said nothing, this kind of argumentation would know no end.

“I will go out today with Dristan, do you have plan to go somewhere?” Thea asked her casually, as she made two cups of coffee for herself and Dristan.

“No,” Rhea replied, she dried her hands with towel and went to see the small gift on the table.

For the last five years, it would be Dristan, who would give her a gift, while her parents would only give her money, since it was easier for them rather than to look for something sentimental and Thea would congratulate her with her half- ass ‘happy birthday’.

Rhea didn’t know when the first time they treated her like an outsider like this.

“You are so eager to see Dristan’s gift,” Thea criticized her when she watched how Rhea opened her gift carefully.

“This will be the only gift that I will receive,” Rhea said in a matter of fact tone, which made Thea frowned.

“You don’t need to be mean like that you know, tell me what do you want, I will buy it for you.”

Rhea rolled her eyes, but she said nothing, as she unwrapped the gift.

But there was something stopped her movement, her heart was beating so fast and her head was slightly dizzy and everything happened all of sudden.

There was a low growl came from her throat, her beast became restless and she was agitated.

“What is it? What happened with you?” Thea frowned to see Rhea’s reaction. “If you don’t like the gift, you shouldn’t be growling like that, you are so ungrateful.”

But then, she saw Rhea had not yet seen the gift, since it was still wrapped and her movement stopped.

“Hey, what is it? You scared me.” Thea then heard loud footsteps and Dristan entered the kitchen. “Dristan, don’t come near her, she is a little bit weird.”

However, Dristan didn’t listen to her, because all of his focus was on the girl before his eyes, as if his whole universe rotated around her, everything else didn’t matter and he flinched when Thea tried to touch him.

“What is it…?” Thea looked both Rhea and Dristan back and forth, while the two of them only stared at each other in disbelieve.

The look on their face, the longing on their eyes and realization hit her so hard.

“No! No way!” Thea freaked out when both of them muttered the same word at the same time.

“Mate.”

Rhea and Dristan were on disbelieve right now that they were mate. No one could see this coming and no one prepared for this.

“NO! THAT’S IMPOSSIBLE!” Thea shook her head, she threw a dagger look at her sister, as if she was going to kill her.

# YOU MUST REJECT THE ALPHA

“This is crazy!” Rhea trotted inside the woods, in their pack, she had shifted into her wolf to escape the uncomfortable situation.

Thea was truly throwing a tantrum upon knowing that Dristan and her sister were a mate. She bawled her eyes out and didn’t allow Rhea to come near her and the alpha.

Even though, Rhea was as shock as the two of them, but Thea threw a teacup, which hit her head and caused injury.

That was the time when she rushed out of the house and shifted into her wolf.

The injury was healed right now, thanked to her healing ability, but she was scared to go home, if Thea was still unstable, she could go for the extreme and Rhea knew better not to come close to her when she was like that.

“This is impossible!” Rhea cursed under her breath and when her legs were tired and her heart was so heavy, she leaned against the tree and then sat down on the hard ground. “How could this be possible? I have known him for more than a decade, but there was no sign whatsoever.”

Rhea shook her head. Of course, there was no sign, she just turned eighteen right now and only at this age, mate could feel the existence of one another.

“This is crazy…” she repeated the same thing. “What now?”

Thea wouldn’t let it slide and for Dristan? Rhea was not sure that he would end their relationship, since he was head over heels for her.

“Ugh!” Rhea groaned painfully, as she rubbed her face roughly. Her heart was still beating so fast and her beast whimpered, looking for their mate, she became restless because the mate bond started to form and the only thing that she could think of right now was only Dristan’s face.

The look on his eyes when he found out that his mate didn’t die. His mate was still alive and his mate was actually his lover’s sister.

Since Dristan turned twenty five and had not yet found his mate, all the people in the pack assumed that his mate had died, thus they were lenient to him when he dated Thea, since both of them were on the same age and had the same case.

“Oh, I am dead now…” Rhea bit her lip when her mind wandered to what she was seeing last night. His half naked body and the way he called his name to say ‘happy birthday’, all that repeated in her head.

=======================

“How can you do that to your sister?!” Gerald, Thea and Rhea’s father roared in anger when he learned about this, she slapped Rhea so hard, she fell to the ground.

Meanwhile, Thea was crying in her mother’s arms. Her eyes were swollen and they were so red, she had been bawling her eyes out since this morning, until evening when their parents rushed back home when they heard their precious daughter was inconsolable.

“How can this my fault?!” Rhea felt her cheek that was slapped was burning, it was so painful, but his father’s accusation was way more painful than anything else. “I don’t choose my mate! You know that you can’t choose who will be your mate!”

Rhea felt her chest caved in, this was not the first time that she was treated unfairly.

After they returned, Gerald asked the alpha to leave, since they would sort this problem within their family first and this was what he said as a ‘discussion’.

“Do you want to ruin your sister happiness now?!” Gerald didn’t seem to hear what Rhea said earlier, or maybe he heard that and chose to ignore that fact, since his precious girl was crying her heart out.

“I know that she likes Dristan, she likes him for long time! She must be very happy to know that she is his mate!” Thea snapped between her sobs. “She must be very happy, since she wants to be a luna of the pack, she is always jealous of me because of my relationship with Dristan and how I will be a luna one day! But, now all of that is ruined!”

“What nonsense that you are saying?!” Rhea got off from the floor, she was so angry to hear such groundless accusation. “I don’t like him when he is with you for the past two years!”

“Can you say that now that you know he is your mate?!” Thea countered, she was still crying on their mother’s shoulder, while their mother didn’t say anything, she always kept quiet whenever things turned out this way. “You can’t say that you don’t like him now!”

“Because he is my mate and I don’t choose that!”

“Liar!”

“Tell me how can you choose your mate! Even the stupidest people know that you can’t choose your mate!” Rhea was so upset, she hated this mistreatment.

However, her sharp words only met with another slap from his father.

“You must reject the alpha tomorrow and stay away from them!”

“Father! Do you want me to die?!” Rhea was petrified to hear such cruel words came from his mouth.

Only a handful people that could survive rejection and since the alpha was a strong creature, he would survive this, but what about Rhea?

Even the thought of her mate rejected her was already pained her so much, her wolf whimpered and became so restless in her mind.

“Go back to your room and think about what you will say to the alpha!”

Rhea was in disbelieve, she didn’t move an inch and the silence stretched out until she spoke again.

“Do you really hate me father? What did I do that make you hate me so much?” Rhea gritted her teeth when she let the question slipped from her lips. “Am I really your daughter? Why am I always treated unfairly?”

Gerald fixed his eyes on Rhea, he enunciated every words clearly. “No, you are not, you are a result of your mother’s adultery.”

# FIRST KISS

“No, you are not, you are a result of your mother’s adultery.”

The words from Gerald was enough to make Thea stopped crying for a moment and instead it was their mother, who were crying, she fell on the floor and started sobbing to her palms.

“Mother…?” Thea called their mother and tried to make sense of the whole situation. “Mother, that’s not true, right?”

However, Amber’s cry only got louder, which was enough to answer her question.

“That is why, you hate me so much?” Rhea asked to no one in particular, but then she directed her eyes at her father again, or at the very least, to the man that she thought was her father until a moment ago. “But, I still couldn’t see where is my fault?”

Gerald’s eyes blazed with anger when he heard that. If look could kill, then Rhea would die a miserable dead.

“Is that my fault that mother cheated on you?” Rhea asked, she wiped away her tears, her cheeks stung so bad, but she ignored the pain and looked at her father straight into his eyes. “Am I the one, who told her to cheat? Or told her to hurt you?”

“RHEA, ENOUGH!” Thea snapped. “Stop that!”

However, Rhea didn’t hear that, she growled loudly at her father. “DID I ASK TO BE BORN!?”

Another harsh slap landed on her cheek, but she steadied herself, she staggered a little bit, but she didn’t fall, instead she raised her head and looked at Gerald right in the eyes.

Her voice was laced by pain and sadness. “That’s not my fault.”

And after saying that, she rushed toward her bedroom and slammed the door behind her.

========================

Rhea woke up in the next morning and her cheeks felt so sore, while her heart was so heavy, she looked around and the sky was so bright. She narrowed her eyes and curled her body again into a ball.

What happened yesterday left her drained from energy, she didn’t even have any strength left to get down from her bed and pour a cup of water for her parched throat, she cried and screamed too much last night.

“What a great eighteen birthday…” but now when she thought about it, everything made sense now, why they treated her differently. “Did father know about this since the very beginning?”

But, Rhea still could remember when Gerald dotted on her when she was little.

There were so many questions that roamed around her head, but she couldn’t provide an answer for it.

In the end, she fell asleep again, too exhausted to face the reality and let the darkness blanketed her.

Rhea only woke up when she heard Thea harsh voice, waking her up from her deep slumber.

“Get up now!” Thea hissed viciously at Rhea, as she turned on the light.

Rhea turned her body and she looked at the sky through the window, which had turned dark. She had fallen asleep for a whole night and day and probably would sleep through another night again if it was not for Thea’s interruption.

“Get up now, Dristan is downstairs,” Thea said that through her gritted teeth. She really hated it. “Do what you have promised to father.”

And after saying that, Thea left the room, as if she didn’t want to spend another minute with her, as if it degraded her if she had to be with in the same room with a child from their mother’s affair.

But before she left the room, she stood at the door and glanced at Rhea sharply, through her shoulder.

“Make things right, don’t be like our mother.”

And then the door was slammed loudly.

Rhea shook her head, she wanted to laugh at what she was saying. “Like our mother? Isn’t you the one, who put yourself between the destined mate?”

Rhea got off the bed, she looked at her face on the mirror and grimaced to see how bad she looked, but she ignored it, she was too tired to care anyway.

And when she went to the living room, there he was, Dristan, sitting on the sofa with Thea clung to his neck, as though she was his second skin.

“Please, I love you, we have been together for long. You are my first, you don’t forget about that, right?” Thea sobbed again. “I gave you all, I gave you myself.”

Dristan’s expression was hard to discern, but he realized Rhea’s presence and stared at the girl, while listening to Thea.

“I love you.” Impulsively, Thea craned her neck and kissed Dristan so hard, even though she knew Rhea was there.

However, Dristan didn’t reciprocate her kiss and pulled himself away from her, as he put Thea on the sofa swiftly.

“I need to talk with Rhea, okay?” Dristan kissed her forehead instead and then left. “Come with me,” he said to Rhea. He didn’t raise his voice, but he didn’t look at her either.

It was hard to tell what was in his mind right now.

But, Rhea followed him nonetheless. They went to the back yard of her house, leaving Thea weeping on the sofa, where Dristan left her.

“Rhea,” Dristan called her, his voice was so deep and it made her shivering. Her heart was beating so fast, as her wolf perked up by the sound of their mate’s voice. “I am still in disbelieve that you are my mate.”

Rhea sighed deeply. “So do I.”

They were standing under a big tree, a little bit away from the house, so no one would hear their conversation.

“What do you want to do now?” Rhea asked him, because the silence that stretched between them was very uncomfortable.

Dristan looked at her for a moment, he said nothing and the silence descended once again.

However, all of sudden, the alpha close the distance between them and pulled Rhea into his arms, as he kissed her so hard, which caught her out of guard.

## Key Features Analysis

The efficacy of a GAC water filter hinges on several key features that determine its performance and lifespan.Understanding thes technical aspects is crucial for making an informed purchase decision.

**Carbon Source and activation Process:** The type of carbon used and the activation process considerably impact the filter's ability to adsorb contaminants. Higher-quality carbon sources,such as coconut shell,generally offer a larger surface area and better adsorption capabilities compared to coal-based carbon. The activation process, which involves heating the carbon to create pores, determines the size and distribution of these pores, affecting the filter's effectiveness against different types of contaminants.

**Micron Rating:** The micron rating indicates the size of particles that the filter can physically remove. A lower micron rating means the filter can capture smaller particles, improving the clarity and purity of the water. GAC filters typically have a micron rating ranging from 5 to 50 microns, but some advanced filters may offer even finer filtration. Choosing the right micron rating depends on the types of contaminants present in your water supply.**Flow Rate:** The flow rate measures the amount of water that can pass through the filter per minute or hour. A higher flow rate ensures a constant supply of filtered water without notable pressure drop. Tho, a very high flow rate may reduce the contact time between the water and the carbon, potentially compromising the filter's effectiveness.

**Filter Lifespan and capacity:** The lifespan and capacity of a GAC filter determine how long it will last before needing replacement. Filter lifespan is typically measured in months, while capacity is measured in gallons.The actual lifespan and capacity depend on the quality of the filter, the concentration of contaminants in the water, and the frequency of use. It's essential to choose a filter with a lifespan and capacity that match your household's water consumption habits.

**Housing Material and Certification:** The material used to construct the filter housing can affect the durability and longevity of the system. high-quality housings are often made from BPA-free plastic or stainless steel, ensuring they won't leach harmful chemicals into the water. Seek for certifications from reputable organizations like NSF International signifies that filter meets strict standards for safety and performance, giving you peace of mind.

**Adsorption Capacity:** Adsorption capacity refers to the filter's ability to capture and hold contaminants on its surface. A higher adsorption capacity allows the filter to remove a greater amount of impurities before becoming saturated. This is steadfast by the type of carbon, its pore size distribution, and the overall surface area available for adsorption.

## Core Benefits

Beyond technical specifications, potential buyers are concerned about practicality and performance. Here are solid benefits users should expect from a modern GAC filter.

**Improved Water Taste and Odor:** GAC filters are highly effective at removing chlorine, chloramine, and othre organic compounds that cause unpleasant tastes and odors in water. This results in a cleaner, more refreshing drinking experience, encouraging increased water consumption and promoting better hydration.

**Removal of Harmful Contaminants:** Along with improving taste and odor, GAC filters can remove a wide range of harmful contaminants, including pesticides, herbicides, volatile organic compounds (VOCs), and disinfection byproducts. By reducing exposure to these toxins, GAC filters help protect against potential health risks and improve overall well-being.

**Enhanced Appliance Performance:** Filtered water from a GAC filter can help prolong the lifespan of appliances that use water, such as coffee makers, ice makers, and humidifiers. By removing minerals and sediments that can cause limescale buildup, GAC filters help maintain appliance efficiency and prevent costly repairs. As an inevitable result, users save money on repairs and replacements over time.

**Reduced Exposure to Pharmaceuticals:** Studies have shown that trace amounts of pharmaceuticals can be present in municipal water supplies. GAC filters can effectively reduce the levels of these contaminants, providing an added layer of protection, especially for individuals concerned about pharmaceutical exposure. This provides peace of mind for users concerned about emerging contaminants.**Environmentally Amiable:** Using a GAC water filter reduces the need for bottled water, which contributes to plastic waste and environmental pollution. By filtering your own water at home, you can minimize your environmental impact and promote sustainability. This offers a responsible and eco-conscious water consumption approach.

## FAQs Section

**How often should I replace my GAC filter?**
The replacement frequency depends on a few factors,including water quality,usage,and filter type. Generally, most GAC filters should be replaced every 6 to 12 months. Always refer to the manufacturer's recommendations for specific guidelines.

**Can a GAC filter remove bacteria and viruses?**
GAC filters are primarily designed to remove chemical contaminants and improve taste and odor, and typically do not remove bacteria or viruses. For microbiological contaminants, a separate disinfection method, such as UV sterilization or a dedicated microbiological filter, is necessary.

**Are GAC filters effective at removing lead?**
While GAC filters can help reduce lead levels, their effectiveness depends on the specific type of carbon used and the filter's construction. Look for GAC filters that are certified to NSF/ANSI Standard 53 for lead reduction to ensure they meet stringent performance requirements.

**Will a GAC filter remove fluoride from my water?**
GAC filters are not highly effective at removing fluoride. If fluoride removal is a primary concern, consider using a reverse osmosis filter or an activated alumina filter, which are specifically designed for fluoride reduction.

As the old timers seem so apt of saying about just about everything,  “It aint what it used to be.”   Our community hasn’t survived the great hallowing out of mid America much better than anybody else.   So much has changed in the thirty some years I’ve been here.   So many of the businesses that used to be here when I was a kid no longer exist, given up when their owners retired and the next generation decided it was fairly pointless trying to operate in a world with Walmart and Amazon.   The shop where they used to rebuild engines is now a warehouse full of chemicals.  Next door they used to rewire electric motors…that building Is now shuttered.   So much of main street is now empty store fronts, even the rail road tracks that once ran through town are gone, the rails sold for scrap years ago.  The chevy dealership has been gone just as long.    The surrounding country side was once filled with small farms trying to eek a living out of the soil in a climate that was anything but cooperative, most of that land has been taken over by the few farms that are left or by out-of-state corporate interests who own an ever increasing portion of county.  Massive machines and foreigners imported on H21B visas do the jobs once held by neighbors.    It is the slow death of a community, one in which that decline is marked by funerals and graduation ceremonies….both giving up members of our community who will never come back. 

The old timer’s epithet is just as pertinent to the fair and rodeo as well.   The barns which were once filled with four h animals from one end to the other are now largely empty.   Four h clubs which once had dozens of members now consist of just a few families.   Once upon a time the rodeo arena and the grandstands had been filled for major country acts like Kenny Chesney, Clint Black and Lonestar with another band playing for a packed dancehall at the legion afterwards.   That has been given up for local bands who play for maybe the hundred or so who gather in a corner of the arena with their lawn chairs and those who want to dance try to do so without tripping over their feet in the soft dirt.

Most of the town still gathers for the parade, It’s the typical small town affair.   The colors carried up front by the aging veterans who’s stumbling shuffle seem like such a contrast to the sharp precise steps those same men had once marched with years and wars ago.   The kids in the various four h clubs  and the FFA Chapter riding on flatbed trailers pulled by pickups or semis,  the marching band strategically placed in front of the various groups riding horses.   Most of the surrounding fire departments showed up with their fire trucks.  The shriners raced around in their tiny cars,  antique tractors putted along….followed by their massive modern counterparts being showcased by the remaining equipment dealerships.    And of course…there was lots of candy.   Enough candy per child to run just a serious risk of founder as Halloween. 

I don’t make much of fair week anymore,   in general, I’m still l pretty nervous about being in public spaces since I began trying to transition, still uncomfortable and uncertain just how things will go in a crowd.  Still all the same, I came in for the parade to visit with some family.   I stood there, leaning against the flatbed of a truck and visiting with a nephew who was home on leave from the army while we watched children dart in and out of the parked cars in pursuit of thrown candy.   I couldn’t help but think about how normal everything felt, normal in a way that I could have never believed would have existed four years earlier when I was contemplating trying to transition.   I waved at people I had once served on the fire department with and got waves and genuine smiles back.   Ran into friends I hadn’t seen in decades and chatted with them….visited with neighbors…and received genuine kindness in every interaction.  Granted I’m pretty content to live in boy mode with long hair and maybe a little different body hiding under my clothes but otherwise try not to push peoples boundaries too hard.  Even still, four years earlier, I would have found it fairly unfathomable that I could still exist as part of this community….if I chose to look a little different.  I wished I could have shown that experience to that younger version of me that sat in the pickup wondering if life would be still worth living if I chose to try to transition. 

In truth, that moment was short lived, ended not by anything anybody else said or did, but crushed by the sense of doubt, shame and guilt that still very much owns me.     As I climbed in my truck to make my way home and hopefully get some rye cut while the weather is cooperative, instead of treasuring in the way I had a good experience…I wondered if it was simply because nobody could even notice that I was different….and that would change once they figured out what I was actually trying to do.    I felt guilty for the fact I was no longer on the department,   when my egg cracked it unleashed a tidal wave of crippling depression.  I let it get to me and missed enough meetings that I was asked to leave, something I figured  was going to happen if they ever figured out I wanted to transition anyways.   Still I missed being on. 

I felt guilty for choosing to transition when it cost my relationship with an absolutely incredible woman Did I really give up her and the dreams of having a family…a family I could have laughed at as they ran out into the street in pursuit of candy, could have helped the get their animal ready at the fair,   all the experiences I watch parents all around me going through….experiences I will never now.   For what?   A foolish dream? A selfish delusion?  Couldn’t I have figured out how to stuff things down to be the kind of person that got to enjoy that?   Wouldn’t it have been worth it?  A wiser choice than pursuing this foolish desire that was so stacked against physical reality? 

In some ways I should have known I end up there….I always do.  Part of it was simply the fatigue of being in a crowd,  part of it was  I’ve always been prone to looking back, becoming trapped in my memories, a dangerous habit in a landscape in which every landmark and event has dozens of memories associated with them   Fair week is no different for me….there are so many memories tied to it.   Memories of a contentious relationship with my mother who was all about four h….way past any point it had ever been fun or something I wanted to do anymore.   Memories of the young boy excited to go to concerts, nervously attending dances in hopes that maybe some girl would like him.   The memories of the young soldier returning home from deployments, each time finding  a world that seemed less and less like the one he’d left,   the isolation of feeling like I no longer belonged, no longer could relate to the community I grew up in.  Memories of that last summer my fiancé and I spent together….we’d danced in the dirt before that no-name local band, my heart torn with the knowledge that she would leave me if I chose to start hrt……..and the knowledge that I really wanted to anyways.    Torn with the doubts as to whether I would ever be tolerated in a setting like that again without being ridiculed until I left in shame.   The realization that even if I chose to pursue transition, I would never enjoy the same freedom as other women who were simply being themselves instead of something they weren’t.   Memories of that first time  a year later when I’d bumped into her in the grandstands after we had parted ways….the way she had refused to return my greeting or even acknowledge my existence

Most mornings I wake up to those familiar accusations that I have no right to live…on the good days I can drown them out with coffee…on the rough days they stick with me and haunt me long after I lay my head down on the pillow,   those nights when sleep is elusive even though I am completely exhausted.   It would be one of those nights.   The next morning,  as I sat their listening to a sermon about how the wrong thoughts can cost us our purpose…I wondered if that was what I had done.   What was my purpose?  Did I even really know?   Was it to have a family and raise up the next generation to run this place?   Those dreams and goals died long ago, shattered by the revelation I was taking hrt.  Is that what the preacher man was talking about?     As much as I am grateful for the opportunity to still exist, there’s not a day that goes by without me being painfully aware of how I have let nearly everybody else in my life down as a result of my decisions.  How do you ever forgive yourself for that?",29,1753679063.0,TransLater,7,1.0,False

Hi y’all - my friend and mentor was just thrown into a divorce. I want to support her all I can, but I don’t want to overstep: let me explain lol.
She was my high school English teacher and we’ve been best friends since. She’s in her 50s and I’m 20. It’s not that either of us doesn’t have friends our age - we just click on an insane level. I want to be there for her in every way I can because she has done the same for me. 

Right now she’s trying to get out of her house as much as possible. We’ve done lunch, coffee, and hikes when it’s not too hot. But I know she’d rather be out for the entire day - I want to invite her to my house to just hang out, but I do live with my parents lol. My parents wouldn’t mind because they know the situation, but it would still be kind of awkward I feel. She’s not from here - her family only moved bc her husband got a job here. She only lives here during the summer - the rest of the year she works out of state to pay for everything. She doesn’t have anywhere else to go or any close friends in town. I want her to have a place where nothing is expected of her, but I’m not sure how to approach the situation.

They effortlessly blend with a variety of colour palettes and décor styles, making them a popular choice for homeowners and interior designers alike. Whether you're aiming for a minimalist, industrial, or even a classic look, a black and gray rug can anchor your room and tie together your furniture and accessories.

This guide will explore the best black and gray rugs of 2025, highlighting their key features, benefits, and ideal user profiles. We'll also compare them to competitors and answer frequently asked questions to help you make an informed decision and find the perfect rug to enhance your home's aesthetic. Choosing the right rug can transform a room, adding warmth, texture, and visual appeal.## Key Features Analysis

When selecting a black and gray rug, several factors come into play, including the materials used, the construction method, the design pattern, the size and shape, and its durability and maintenance requirements. These specifications directly impact the rug's longevity, comfort, and suitability for different living spaces. Identifying the key features will ensure you find a rug that matches your needs.

**Material Composition:** The dominant material used in a rug's composition significantly affects its feel,durability,and appearance. Black and gray rugs are commonly found in materials like wool, polypropylene, nylon, viscose, and cotton blends. Wool rugs are known for their softness, resilience, and natural stain resistance, making them a premium choice. Polypropylene and nylon rugs are synthetic alternatives that offer excellent durability, stain resistance, and affordability, suitable for high-traffic areas. Viscose rugs provide a silky sheen and soft texture, adding a touch of luxury, but they require careful maintenance. Cotton blends offer comfort and affordability, though they may not be as durable as wool or synthetic options.

**Construction Method:** The construction method determines how the rug is made and impacts its texture, durability, and overall quality. Common construction methods include hand-knotted, hand-tufted, machine-made, and flatweave. Hand-knotted rugs are meticulously crafted by skilled artisans, resulting in intricate designs and exceptional durability. They are considered investment pieces that can last for generations. hand-tufted rugs are made by punching yarn through a canvas backing, offering a balance of quality and affordability.Machine-made rugs are mass-produced using automated looms, providing consistent quality and affordability. Flatweave rugs, such as kilims and dhurries, are woven without a pile, creating a thin, reversible rug that is ideal for layering and adding texture.

**Design Pattern and Style:** Black and gray rugs come in a variety of design patterns and styles, ranging from geometric patterns and abstract designs to customary motifs and contemporary styles. Geometric patterns, such as stripes, chevrons, and diamonds, add a modern and structured look to a room. Abstract designs offer a more artistic and free-flowing aesthetic, adding visual interest and personality. Traditional motifs, like Persian and Oriental patterns, evoke a sense of timeless elegance and sophistication. Contemporary styles often feature minimalist designs, distressed textures, and bold color combinations.

**Size and Shape:** Choosing the right size and shape rug is crucial for creating a balanced and harmonious room layout. Common rug shapes include rectangle, square, round, and oval. Rectangle rugs are the most versatile and widely used, suitable for living rooms, bedrooms, and dining areas. Square rugs work well in square-shaped rooms or under square tables. Round rugs can soften angular spaces and create a focal point. The size of the rug should be proportionate to the room and the furniture arrangement. A general rule is to have at least the front legs of your furniture resting on the rug.

Key features of a well-designed black and gray rug include:

   Durable and stain-resistant materials
   High-quality construction for longevity
   Visually appealing design pattern and style
   Appropriate size and shape for the room
   Easy to clean and maintain

## Core Benefits

The core benefits of owning a high-quality black and gray rug extend beyond aesthetics.These rugs offer practical advantages that enhance the comfort, functionality, and overall value of your living space. From improved noise reduction to stylish decor, understanding the core benefits will allow you to appreciate the investment of purchasing a well-made black and gray rug.

**Enhanced Aesthetics:** A black and gray rug can instantly elevate the aesthetic appeal of any room, adding a touch of sophistication and style. Its neutral color palette allows it to seamlessly blend with various décor styles, from minimalist to modern to more traditional. The rug can serve as a focal point,anchoring the furniture and tying together the overall look. For example, a geometric black and gray rug can add a contemporary edge to a living room, while a distressed black and gray rug can create a vintage-inspired atmosphere.

**Improved Comfort and Warmth:** Rugs provide a soft and agreeable surface underfoot, enhancing the coziness of your living space. They add a layer of insulation that helps retain heat, making the room feel warmer and more inviting, especially during colder months. Walking on a soft rug provides a more pleasant experience compared to hard flooring like tile or wood. For instance, a plush wool black and gray rug can transform a bedroom into a tranquil retreat.

**Noise Reduction:** Rugs effectively absorb sound, reducing echoes and noise levels in a room. This acoustic benefit is particularly valuable in apartments, condominiums, or homes with hard flooring surfaces. by dampening sound waves, rugs create a quieter and more peaceful habitat. for example, placing a large black and gray rug in a living room can significantly reduce noise from foot traffic and conversations.

**Floor Protection:** Rugs act as a protective barrier for your floors, preventing scratches, dents, and wear and tear from furniture and foot traffic. They can extend the lifespan of your flooring and save you money on costly repairs or replacements. Placing a rug under heavy furniture or in high-traffic areas can provide crucial protection.As an example, a durable polypropylene black and gray rug can safeguard a hardwood floor in a busy entryway.

## FAQs Section

Addressing frequently asked questions ensures potential buyers receive clear and concise information about black and gray rugs, covering essential aspects from material selection to care tips. Clear answers will help potential buyers.

**What are the best materials for high-traffic areas?**
For high-traffic areas, polypropylene and nylon rugs are excellent choices due to their exceptional durability and stain resistance. These synthetic materials can withstand heavy foot traffic and are easy to clean, making them ideal for entryways, hallways, and living rooms. Wool rugs are also durable, but they may require more specialized cleaning. Avoid delicate materials like viscose in high-traffic areas.

**How do I clean a black and gray rug effectively?**
Regular vacuuming is essential for maintaining a black and gray rug. Vacuum at least once a week to remove dirt, dust, and debris. For spills and stains,blot immediatly with a clean,absorbent cloth. Avoid rubbing, as this can spread the stain. For stubborn stains, use a mild detergent diluted with water or a professional rug cleaner.Always test the cleaning solution on a hidden area of the rug first to ensure it doesn't cause discoloration.**What rug size should I choose for my living room?**
The ideal rug size for your living room depends on the size of your furniture and the layout of the room. A general guideline is to choose a rug that is large enough to accommodate at least the front legs of your furniture. For a smaller living room, an area rug that fits under the coffee table and extends slightly beyond the seating area may suffice. For a larger living room, a rug that anchors the entire seating area and extends beneath all the furniture legs will create a more cohesive and balanced look.

**How can I prevent my black and gray rug from slipping?**
To prevent your black and gray rug from slipping, use a rug pad underneath. A rug pad provides cushioning, prevents the rug from shifting, and protects your flooring from scratches. Choose a rug pad that is specifically designed for use with your floor type. Rug pads are available in various materials, including felt, rubber, and memory foam.

1mb7dk0,https://www.reddit.com/r/decaf/comments/1mb7dk0/caffeine_withdrawal_how_common_are_no_withdrawal/,Caffeine withdrawal - How common are no withdrawal symptoms?,"I'm a M44 that has drank coffee daily for 10-15 years.

I recently realised that I was consuming 400-600mg of caffeine per day between coffee, tea and pre-workout and that it was starting to impact my sleep quality, despite keeping my coffee and pre-workout to the AM hours.

I'm 1 week in from no caffeine consumption apart from a single decaf coffee per day (silver water extraction method). I've been fortunate that the only withdrawal symptoms so far have been minor. I'm a little less focused, had slight afternoon drowsiness and I went to bed an hour or so earlier the first couple of nights due to feeling tired.

The extra sleep was likely due to being underslept for a long time and the caffeine no longer masking it and I'm also not surprised by the drowsiness and less focus. If anything, I expected things to be worse. I also expected to get withdrawal headaches, but I've had nothing so far.

For those that have done the same, how common is it to have little to no withdrawal symptoms? I assume that any withdrawal symptoms would be strongest at the start, so if I haven't had much so far, it's safe to assume that this is as bad as it will get.

This post isn't a humble brag. It's just that, based on what I'd read up on before starting this, I expected the worst. So I'm wondering if this is a typical experience, or did I just get lucky?",1,1753678776.0,decaf,0,1.0,False

1mb7csv,https://www.reddit.com/r/espresso/comments/1mb7csv/effective_funnel_for_breville_54mm_50_cad/,Effective funnel for Breville 54mm? [$50 CAD],"I'm trying to conceptualize the perfect funnel for our breville 54mm portafilters, but I just can't seem to find the ultimate solution.  I'm definately overthinking this, but I just want to not make a mess on the counter or floor every day, or reduce how quickly the inevitable grinds build up at least.  Cleaning is always required of course, but I'd rather just not make the mess in the first place.

The problem is simple to define. Reduce stray coffee grinds to near zero.  This includes as much of the grinding and puck prep as possible.  I have a very confined prep space between the toaster and the Keurig where the grinder and Bambino Plus are squeezed in.  Spent pucks go into a compost bin on different counter beside the sink, so I'm already back and forth.  I grind and prep and brew at the coffee station, and knock and clean the portafilter at the sink after preparing the drink.  Not ideal, but I can't imagine that it is unique.

\-Perfect seal.  No ring of grounds on the top lip of the portafilter after removing the funnel.  Requires a curved profile and proper machining such the measurement from the bottom of the portafilter tabs to the top of the basket lip is accurate in the funnel retention clips/slots.  I returned one of the twist-on style and it was almost perfect, just 0.5mm additional machining and it would have been great.  The slight downward lip on the funnel otherwise perfectly matched  curve of the basket and it would have recessed perfectly into it.  If I pushed the backet out slight so it wasn't tightly seated I could closed the gap, but you have to re-set it every time, which is challaning with the stock portafilter.  Easier with a naked PF, but I'm really trying to reduce the cleaning burden so the naked PF is only for special occasions.

  
\-Frim grip.  I'm okay with strong magnets holding it on, but lots of comments complain about them falling off or the magents are not very strong.  And twist on style, most common complain is the clips break.  I have not tried one of them myself.  The Shardor grinder came with a little slip-in coffee filter but I think it is universal for 51 and 54 mm so it leave a very large ring around the outside and requires too much manual levelling after wdt.  


\-Operate direct to portafileter grinders, so it must push the button.  The nice magnetic or external retaining funnels are fundamentally incompatible, at least with my specific grinder, a Shordor (Amazon) direct to filter, convertable to dosing cup.  So for my case, since I am single dosing anyways, I could just use the cups setting and hold the portafilter instead of using the holder, but anyone with the built-in grinders can still have issues.

\-Dimensions.  Is the funnel tall enough to contain the grinders while doing you prep?  Is it also wide enough to catch everything that calls into it?  I don't mind taking the funnel off to tamp since I am using a collared spring tamper so I can't really use it with the funnel installed, but I think it would be nice to have the right combination of equipment that you could grind, distribute and tamp, all while containing any mess with the funnel.

\-Alternate distribution methods.  What if I want to shake instead of needle?  I thought I had it all figured out.  I grabbed a dosing cup, was going to just put my hand over it and shake shake and dump it in the basket.  But of course that's introducing another stray coffee issue.  But I can't see through the aluminum so I never know if I got it to land okay after flipping, or if my tapping and banging has gotten it to settle below the rim of the basket. So I don't know if I have a pile of grinds on one side, and still need to wdt just to even it back out.  Which means I'm back to needing a funnel or risking stray coffee.  The dosing cup has has reduced the outer ring that the Shardor funnel leaves behind to nearly nothing, but this has not simplified things the way I had hoped.  It was also too tall for that Shardor grinder so I had to remove the portafilter holder and single does in cups mode instead.

So, I thought maybe a shaker cup, like with the lid and plunger, drop it out the bottom.  But for what I'm seeing, I still need a funnel at that point as well if the height is important, otherwise it needs basket engagement sufficient to check off the initial perfect seal requirement, as well as the firm grip.  So what's that?  Stick a funnel on the bottom and a shaker on top?   The top half could actually be wider than the 54mm basket size, and funnel down to 54mm for the bottom half.  This would give the the funnel and the fitment needed at the basket, and the height above the basket that some say is important for pulling the plunger.  But this product does not exist either.

And so I've come back full circle.  If I could just find a simple funnel that had proper fitment, held on firmly and was large enough to prep, but ...

I'm overthinking this and going in circles.  I'm not just buying stuff, I'm trying to solve a problem, with a budget.  I'm at the start of my journey so I'm not concerned about something only being a a 2% improvement of the last thing. I'm just looking to buy it once and it works and I keep it.  If it doesn't work I'm sending it back, I don't need one of every toy or fad.  I'll even keep using my single prong paperclip style distributor that came with the grinder if I could just find a funnel that checked off the boxes.  I guess I could just keep buying and returning things to amazon, but I really hate wasting the time and resources that takes, especially when 9 out of 10 products are all the same chinese clone... probably, but you can't be sure what is close vs close enough vs just bad.  But does if product reviews don't mention the problems I had, does that mean that they don't have those problems, or that most people just don't care because it's already so much better than not using one at all?

I once made a post about duck fat in ice cream, [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/icecreamery/comments/1cglow5/duck_fat_theory_and_application/)

But in that post, i ended up going for miso, caramel duck fat swirl, to what i believe was regular vanilla ice cream.

That ice cream, was very, very popular among my friends. But mostly for the flavor, rather than any textural interests.

Recently, I've acquired more duck fat, and im preparing for a new recipe. I've installed ice cream calculator and ive been playing around today with a recipe.

Can you folks help critique and find pitfalls in my recipe?

# Horchata Duck fat ice cream

# Ingredients

* 1 cup prepared duck fat
* 3 egg yolks
* 800g skim milk
* 40g skim milk powder
* 100g piloncillo (brown sugar)
* 120g white sugar
* 2 sticks of cinnamon
* 100g of rice
* 20g of sliced almonds
* dash of vanilla extract
* dash of salt

# Duck fat prep

* 1 cup of duck fat
* strain through a sieve and a coffee filter
* wash two times, once with water and once with milk + a splash of dark rum.

# Horchata prep

* Toast your rice, almonds, and cinnamon sticks until fragrant.
* Cover with the skim milk, and steep overnight.
* After steeping, blend smooth
* simmer very gently
* strain.

# Make the base

* Temper the eggs with the simmered horchata.
* Mix with the duck fat, the sugar, the piloncillo
* Simmer until reaches 170F
* Finish with vanilla and salt to taste.
* Let rest one more night before churning

What do yall think? Would this be vile? too hard? too starchy with my steeping and blending of the rice? Should i include cream in order for the duck fat to not have a crappy mouthfeel?",2,1753678534.0,icecreamery,0,1.0,False

These medications work by mimicking a natural hormone in your body that tells you when you’re full, so you eat less and feel satisfied longer. Some versions even target multiple hunger hormones, making the effect even stronger.

# 3. 📈 Real-World Effects: What People Say

* Many people experience significant weight loss after using these drugs for months.
* Some stop early because of side effects or cost, which can lead to regaining the weight.

I want to support her all I can, but I don’t want to overstep: let me explain lol.
She was my high school English teacher and we’ve been best friends since. She’s in her 50s and I’m 20. It’s not that either of us doesn’t have friends our age - we just click on an insane level. I want to be there for her in every way I can because she has done the same for me. 

Right now she’s trying to get out of her house as much as possible. We’ve done lunch, coffee, and hikes when it’s not too hot. But I know she’d rather be out for the entire day - I want to invite her to my house to just hang out, but I do live with my parents lol. My parents wouldn’t mind because they know the situation, but it would still be kind of awkward I feel. She’s not from here - her family only moved bc her husband got a job here. She only lives here during the summer - the rest of the year she works out of state to pay for everything. She doesn’t have anywhere else to go or any close friends in town.

This seems like a well rounded MRE. Coffee, pretzels bites, my first cran ras FSB, chocolate protein drink... I'm surprised by this one  should be good...Something is definitely missing from these menus generally and I actually think eating 1 MRE a day for 24 days could actually be dangerous, from here on out I may just subsidise with eggs and broccoli to get the additional protein and vitamins. I'm not convinced my multivitamin has all the stuff it needs in a way the human body can absorb it (fat soluble or whatever). But will continue to have the recommended dose. I feel more alert today, I didn't realise just how different I felt, I'm able to focus easily, which I haven't been able to do this last week. Anyway you guys are here for the MRE, so let's get into this...

Breakfast 8am: (7/10): Cranberry-raspberry FSB, its good, Its not my favorite, but its not the worst either, its just different to the other 2, apple is still my favorite and the chocolate one is reliable. The flavour isnt too sharp or too artificial, tastes like a raspberry smoothie was somehow hardened onto a rice crispy cake. This is a good alternative. Had alongside a Bills brew this makes for nice little breakfast.

Lunch 12:00: (7.5/10): Honey mustard pretzels bites, these things are delicious but a little dry, made a nice lunch time snack. The flavouring on these is addictive and accurate. The chocolate drink also hits good, refreshing, flavourful, some protein and some calories.

Dinner 4pm: (5/10): The main is about as boring as it sounds, its just rice and beans with a little tomato sauce, added a cracker and the hot auce powder for extra flavour and sucked on the peanut butter for desert. Beats another PB sandwhich... These last few components are really boring. Far from good, but atleast edible.

Overall Score: 6.5/10: fun sides, but the main is nothing special. I'm grateful its not as bad as the chicken chunks though. Tomorrow I'll be back on the MRE with no extra meals. I feel a lot better, will bring the focus back on to weight loss.",8,1753678234.0,MRE,1,0.9,False

1mb77lj,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_Own_Mode_6427/comments/1mb77lj/discover_the_weight_loss_powers_of_coffee/,Discover the Weight Loss Powers of Coffee,"As I explore the world of weight loss, I've found that a morning cup of coffee is more than a daily habit. It can be a strong ally in reaching my fitness goals.

*Coffee's potential benefits* go beyond just giving me energy. Studies show it can help with *weight loss* by boosting metabolism and burning fat.

Adding coffee to my daily routine could unlock its weight loss benefits. In this article, we'll look into the science behind coffee's weight loss powers. We'll also see how it can support a healthier lifestyle.

# My Coffee Weight Loss Journey

My journey with coffee and weight loss started with a simple idea. Coffee wasn't just a morning boost; it could change the game. Adding coffee to my daily routine was a key move that helped a lot with my weight loss.

How I Discovered Coffee's Impact on My Weight. Visit **FadeFatForever. Com** for more.

I first saw coffee's weight impact when I drank it every morning. I was active, but couldn't lose those extra pounds. With coffee, my energy soared, making me want to move more all day.

|Activity|Before Coffee|After Coffee|
|:-|:-|:-|
|Energy Levels|Low|High|
|Workout Frequency|3 times a week|5 times a week|
|Weight Loss Progress|Slow|Noticeable|

# My Before and After Results

The change wasn't just about the scale; it was about feeling better. Drinking coffee helped me lose body fat, especially around my belly. My before and after photos showed a clear difference, with a more toned body in the after shots.

By making coffee a part of my life, I lost 20 pounds in 3 months. It was a big win. But it was more than just weight loss; it was about living healthier, with coffee as a helpful ally.

# The Science Behind How Coffee Affects Weight Loss

Coffee's weight loss benefits come from how it affects metabolism and appetite. Knowing how coffee works can help you get the most out of it for weight loss.

# Caffeine as a Natural Metabolism Booster

Caffeine is a stimulant that boosts metabolism and fat burning. It's a key part of a weight loss plan.

# How Caffeine Increases Fat Burning

Caffeine releases fatty acids into the bloodstream, making them ready for energy. This boosts fat burning, especially when you exercise.

# Metabolic Rate Improvements I Noticed

Drinking coffee made my metabolic rate go up. I felt more energetic and did better in my workouts.

# Coffee's Impact on Appetite Suppression

Coffee can also cut down on hunger, which means eating fewer calories. This is because caffeine affects hunger hormones.

* Caffeine may lower ghrelin, the hunger hormone.
* Drinking coffee can make you feel full, so you eat less.

# Antioxidants in Coffee and Their Benefits

Coffee is full of antioxidants, which protect cells and support health. These compounds help with weight loss too.

Some important antioxidants in coffee are:

* Polyphenols
* Hydrocinnamic acids

# How I Use Coffee for Weight Loss in My Daily Routine

Coffee is more than a morning pick-me-up for me. It's key to my daily weight loss plan. It boosts my metabolism, increases my energy, and helps with weight loss.

# My Morning Coffee Ritual

I start my day with a cup of black coffee. It's great for kicking my metabolism into gear. It makes me feel alert and ready for the day. Plus, it helps me not feel hungry until my first meal.

# Strategic Timing of Coffee Consumption

When I drink coffee matters a lot for weight loss. I drink it when I need a boost or before exercise. For example, coffee before a workout gives me energy and helps burn fat.

|Timing|Purpose|Benefits|
|:-|:-|:-|
|Morning|Boost Metabolism|Increased Alertness, Appetite Suppression|
|Pre-Workout|Enhance Energy|Improved Performance, Enhanced Fat Burning|
|Mid-Morning/Afternoon|Combat Slumps|Maintained Energy Levels, Improved Focus|

# Coffee as a Pre-Workout Energizer

Drinking coffee before working out has changed my exercise routine. The caffeine gives me the energy to do better in my workouts. It also helps me last longer and perform better.

By adding coffee to my daily routine, I've seen big benefits for weight loss. It boosts my metabolism in the morning and gives me energy for workouts. Coffee is a big part of my weight loss journey.

# Types of Coffee That Maximized My Weight Loss Results

I found that some coffees work better for weight loss than others. Trying different brewing methods and coffee types showed me how they affect weight loss.

# Black Coffee vs. Coffee With Additives

Switching to *black coffee* was a game-changer for me. It cut out calories from creamers and sugars. This move helped me lose weight faster because of coffee's natural ability to boost metabolism.

# Cold Brew Benefits I Discovered

Cold brew coffee was another game-changer. Its smooth taste let me enjoy coffee without extra sugar or creamer. Plus, its lower acidity made it easier on my stomach compared to hot coffee.

# Espresso and Its Concentrated Effects

Espresso became a key part of my weight loss plan. Its strong caffeine kick boosted my metabolism and energy. I drank espresso before working out to improve my performance and burn fat faster.

Adding these coffees to my daily routine helped me lose weight effectively. It made the journey enjoyable too.

# My Favorite Coffee Additions That Support Weight Loss

As I worked on losing weight, I found that some coffee additions helped a lot. They made my coffee taste better and helped me reach my weight loss goals. Adding the right ingredients boosted my metabolism and energy, making my coffee more enjoyable.

# Cinnamon, Cocoa, and Other Beneficial Spices

I love adding spices to my coffee. Cinnamon, for example, adds a warm flavor and helps with blood sugar and metabolism.

# My Spice Combinations for Flavor and Metabolism

I mix cinnamon with cocoa powder for a tasty, metabolism-boosting coffee. This combo not only tastes amazing but also gives me antioxidants.

# How to Add Spices Without Ruining Taste

Start with a little spice to keep the flavor right. You can always add more. Try different spice mixes to find your favorite.

# Healthy Milk Alternatives I Use

I also use healthy milk alternatives to make my coffee better. Almond milk, oat milk, and coconut milk are my go-tos. They're low in calories and full of nutrients.

# Natural Sweeteners That Don't Sabotage Results

If you like your coffee sweet, there are natural sweeteners that won't hurt your weight loss. Stevia and monk fruit sweetener are good choices because they're low in calories.

|Coffee Additive|Benefits|Potential Drawbacks|
|:-|:-|:-|
|Cinnamon|Boosts metabolism, improves blood sugar control|Can be overpowering if used in excess|
|Cocoa Powder|Rich in antioxidants, improves heart health|Can add calories if not used sparingly|
|Almond Milk|Low in calories, rich in vitamins|May not be suitable for those with nut allergies|
|Stevia|Natural sweetener, zero calories|Can have a licorice-like aftertaste|

# Common Coffee Mistakes That Hindered My Progress

I found out that coffee can help with weight loss, but only if you avoid common mistakes. On my weight loss journey, I hit several roadblocks. These mistakes slowed down my progress.

Understanding how coffee habits affect weight loss was a big challenge. I looked back at my journey and found the mistakes I made. I also figured out how to fix them.

# High-Calorie Coffee Shop Drinks I Avoided

Coffee shop drinks can be very high in calories. I learned to stay away from drinks with syrup, whipped cream, and extra sugar. For example, a grande caramel macchiato has over 300 calories.

By choosing black coffee or simple coffee with few additives, I cut down on calories a lot.

|Coffee Drink|Calories|Sugar Content|
|:-|:-|:-|
|Grande Caramel Macchiato|340|39g|
|Black Coffee|0|0g|
|Coffee with 1 Sugar|16|4g|

# The Sugar and Creamer Trap

I also added too much sugar and creamer to my coffee. This added calories and reduced coffee's health benefits. I started using natural sweeteners like stevia and using less creamer.

This change made my coffee much healthier.

# Timing Mistakes I Made

Another mistake was drinking coffee at the wrong times. Drinking it too close to bedtime messed up my sleep. Drinking it too early in the morning didn't give me the energy I needed.

I found that drinking coffee during my workout and in the morning after fasting worked best. This timing maximized its benefits.

By avoiding these common coffee mistakes, I improved how I used coffee for weight loss. It's not just about drinking coffee. It's about doing it in a way that helps your weight loss goals.

# How I Combined Coffee With Other Weight Loss Strategies

As I kept working on losing weight, I found that mixing coffee with other methods really helped. I started looking into different ways to boost my weight loss.

# Coffee and Intermittent Fasting Synergy

One great mix I tried was drinking coffee while fasting. It not only cut down my hunger but also gave me energy when I needed it most.

# My Fasting Window Strategy

I chose a 16:8 fasting plan. This meant fasting for 16 hours and eating in an 8-hour window. Coffee was key during fasting, keeping me alert and energized.

# Breaking the Fast With Coffee

When I ended my fast, I'd start with black coffee. It got my metabolism going and made it easier to start eating again.

# Pairing Coffee With the Right Diet

Drinking coffee with a healthy diet also worked well for me. I ate foods rich in nutrients and found that coffee helped burn fat and boost my metabolism.

I made sure to drink coffee in a way that fit my diet goals. I avoided adding lots of calories and stuck to black coffee or low-calorie options.

# Coffee as Part of My Exercise Routine

Coffee was also part of my exercise plan. Drinking it before working out gave me a boost of energy. This helped me do better and last longer during my workouts.

Adding coffee to my pre-workout routine helped me tackle tough exercises. It was key to keeping up with my workout schedule and losing weight.

# Potential Side Effects I Experienced and How I Managed Them

When I started using coffee for weight loss, I faced some side effects. Coffee helped me shed pounds but also caused issues. I had to find ways to keep my progress safe.

I often felt jittery and anxious. To fix this, I cut down on coffee and switched to decaf in the afternoon. Deep breathing exercises also helped calm my nerves.

# Dealing With Jitters and Anxiety

To fight jitters and anxiety, I tried a few things:

* I limited my coffee to just one cup in the morning.
* I practiced meditation and yoga to relax.
* I made sure to eat before drinking coffee.

# Sleep Issues and How I Solved Them

Coffee messed with my sleep. To fix this, I stopped drinking coffee hours before bedtime. A regular sleep schedule and a bedtime routine also improved my sleep.

# Digestive Effects and My Solutions

Coffee sometimes upset my stomach. To handle this, I ate a small snack with my coffee. I also avoided adding sugars or creamers that could make my stomach worse.

By knowing about these side effects and managing them, I could keep using coffee to help me lose weight.

# My 7-Day Plan to Use Coffee for Weight Loss

I found out coffee can help with weight loss and made a 7-day plan. This plan has a daily coffee schedule, different recipes, and ways to track my progress.

# Daily Coffee Schedule I Follow

Drinking coffee at the same times every day is important. It helps boost my metabolism and energy.

* Morning: I start with a black coffee to kickstart my metabolism.
* Pre-workout: A cup of coffee about 30 minutes before exercise gives me an energy boost.
* Afternoon: If I need a pick-me-up, I opt for a low-calorie coffee drink.

# Recipe Variations to Keep Things Interesting

Trying different coffee recipes keeps my routine fun and prevents boredom. Here are some of my favorites:

# My Morning Metabolism Booster Recipe

I mix my morning coffee with cinnamon and almond milk for a tasty and healthy start.

# Afternoon Energy Coffee Without the Crash

A cold brew coffee with lime juice and cocoa powder gives me a refreshing energy boost.

# Evening Decaf Options That Still Support Weight Loss

In the evening, I enjoy decaf coffee with vanilla extract and skim milk for a calming drink.

# Progress Tracking Methods That Worked for Me

To track my progress, I use weight tracking, body measurements, and progress photos. I also keep a coffee diary to see how different recipes and times affect my weight loss.

1. Weekly weigh-ins to track weight loss progress.
2. Body measurements to monitor changes in body composition.
3. Progress photos to visualize changes.

1mb77at,https://www.reddit.com/r/Contemporary_Romance/comments/1mb77at/my_only_happy_place_was_with_my_maternal/,My only happy place was with my maternal grandparents | Wedcuffed,"After a few months, I noticed how Dad started to ignore me as he got caught up in his ""perfect"" new family. Over time, I became just an extra, unwanted family member that no one cared about.

My only happy place was with my maternal grandparents, who lived in Italy. We made sure to visit each other whenever we could. Besides my grandparents, I loved only two other people in the world as much as my family—my childhood best friends, Jessica Martin and Adrian Parker. The three of us were inseparable until Adrian moved to a boarding school in London.

Jessica and I stayed close and kept in touch with Adrian every weekend. However, as soon as I started high school, Jessica began to ignore me, preferring to hang out with Chloe instead. Soon, they became best friends, and even Adrian stopped replying to my messages and calls.

As time passed, everyone around me seemed to compare me to Chloe or other girls. Lisa constantly insulted my looks and clothes and made sure others treated me the same way. Even my dad started to see me as a disgrace.

As little girls, we're often told stories of distressed damsels who need saving. But as I grew older, I realized I didn't need a Prince Charming to save me.

The only person capable of saving me was myself. I needed to become a strong, independent woman and stand up for myself.

I was clear about my future and goals by the time I finished high school. I worked hard to get into a top university, and my efforts paid off.

Five years later, Harvard's diploma gleamed on my wall. I'd traded starvation for strength, tears for titanium resolve. Even my reflection shocked me—waist-length hair, curves Ester swore made men trip, and eyes that no longer flinched.

Tomorrow, I'll be leaving Boston and returning to NYC after almost five years. During this time, neither my family nor Jessica or Adrian tried to contact me. My grandfather offered financial support, but I barely touched it.

As I packed my belongings and prepared for the airport, I tied my hair into a ponytail and examined my reflection in the mirror. My brown hair now cascaded down to my waist; I used to prefer short hair until high school. My round face was almost bare, with minimal makeup. My glasses were gone, and my hazel eyes, framed by thick lashes, were perfectly coated with mascara.

After taking one last look in the mirror, I grabbed my belongings and called a cab. Soon, I was on my way to the airport, hoping that everything would go well.

Little did I know, this journey back to NYC was going to turn my life upside down.

Chapter 2

It's been a week since I arrived in NYC. As soon as I landed in my birthplace, I got busy unpacking and setting up my home. This house was bought by my mother before she died. She wanted to keep it as a home, yet now, no family member is here with me today.

My family knew about my arrival, but no one had tried to meet me or contact me.

I brushed off those thoughts and continued sipping my coffee while sitting in the living room when I heard my phone ring.

I quickly stood up and grabbed the phone lying on the desk. A smile formed on my li-ps when I saw the name on the screen, and I answered the call.

""Hello, Grandpa! How are you? How is Grandma doing?""

""We're both fine, dear. How are you? Have you settled into your new home?"" he asked excitedly.

""Yes, Grandpa, I've settled in. I just wish you both were here with me,"" I replied, a bit sadly, making my grandpa chuckle.

""We'll be coming to visit you in a days, sweetheart. It's time I finally hand over the company to you,"" Grandpa said in a serious tone.

""Yes, Grandpa, I remember that. I just hope I can handle the responsibilities well.""

""You'll do great, my dear. You're perfect for leading the company,"" Grandpa assured me.

My grandpa, Stephen D'Amario never trusted my father—not after Mom died, and certainly not after he let Lisa and Chloe destroy what was left of our family. D’Amario Enterprises was Grandpa’s life’s work, meant for Mom, then for me. But after her cancer diagnosis, Dad took over, and Lisa made sure I’d never be fit to inherit it.

""You’re not university material,"" Dad sneered when I applied to colleges, parroting Lisa’s words. Yet I kept my grades up, clinging to one truth: the company would be mine at twenty-one.

The memories still clawed at me.

FLASHBACK

Jessica and Chloe barged into my room, their laughter sharp as knives. ""Ugly bit-ch,"" Jessica spat.

A book slammed into my face. Blood bloomed on my face. Then fists, nails, spit—each blow driving home my worthlessness. They destroyed my homework last, shredding it with glee.

""Know your place,"" Chloe hissed before slamming the door.

Alone, I sobbed, then rewrote the assignment until dawn. Weak. Pathetic.

FLASHBACK ENDS

I exhaled, flexing my hands—no longer trembling. At Harvard, I’d traded fear for fists. I even learned basic self-defence there.

Seeing how strong and decisive I am today gives me the confidence to take on the responsibility of being the heiress of D'Amario Enterprises.

Chapter 3

Adrian P.O.V

I've always gotten everything I wanted in life—from money to power, I had the finest of it all.

At 25, I'm one of the most successful businessmen in the country. Two years ago, my dad entrusted me with the full responsibility of the company, and today, it's one of the leading corporations in the USA. But the best part of my life is the love of my life, Jessica Martin. She's everything a man could ever ask for.

I've known Jessica since we were about 5 years old, but at 12, I moved to a boarding school in London. Despite the distance, Jessica and I always stayed in contact, and she supported me through every up and down.

During vacations, we always made sure to spend time together. I even remember Sarah, who used to be a good friend of ours. But after I moved to London, she started ignoring Jessica and even asked her to stay away from me. Jessica always told me how Sarah bullied her in high school.

As time went on, Jessica only grew more beautiful, both inside and out. Two years ago, after I took over the company, I asked her to be my girlfriend. With her, my life felt complete—she was not only pretty but also incredibly intelligent and talented. She was one of the top students in school and even got a scholarship to Harvard, but she chose to follow her pass-ion for modeling. Today, she's one of the highest-paid models in the industry.

My thoughts were interrupted by a knock on my office door. Without looking up, I told the person to come in.

I heard the click of heels on the floor and caught the familiar scent of perfume. Jessica walked towards me and sat on my desk.

""Good afternoon, love,"" I said, moving closer and taking her hands in mine.

""Hey, babe,"" she replied seductively, placing her other hand on my che-st.

""How was your day?"" I asked. She started telling me about her photoshoot that morning while I admired the beauty sitting before me. She looked amazing in that fitted white dress, her blond mid-length hair perfectly styled and falling onto her shoulders. As a model, she had a flawlessly toned body. She was perfect, and I was the luckiest man to have her in my life.

""Adrian, what are you wearing to your parents' wedding anniversary?""

""I want our outfits to coordinate since that's when you'll tell your parents about us,"" she said as she adjusted my tie.

""Well, you don't need to worry about that, love. My secretary has taken care of our outfits. You'll get the dress by tomorrow,"" I replied.

""Aww, thank you so much,"" she said happily. ""Now, if you're done with work, can we go home?""

""Sure, babe. Let me just call my secretary,"" I said, moving toward the phone to inform Josh of my departure.

I put on my coat, took Jessica's hand, and we interlocked our fingers as we walked toward the elevator.

I headed to my black Bugatti Veyron, opening the door for Jessica before jogging to the driver's seat. After starting the car, I soon stopped at a lavish Italian restaurant for dinner.

We chose a seat in the corner of the restaurant, and started discussing our future plans.

""Do you think your parents will accept our relationship?"" Jessica asked while sipping her wine.

""I don't think your mother is fond of me,"" she added as I narrowed my eyes.

""Why do you feel that way, Jess?""

""Ever since you came back from London, I've tried to talk to her, but she always ends up bringing up Sarah in the conversation.""

""She keeps telling me how sweet and kind Sarah is and how the three of us should hang out together like old times,"" Jessica said in a sad tone.

My jaw clenched at the mention of Sarah's name. What she did to Jessica was enough for me to hate her for the rest of my life.

""Sarah doesn't deserve to be our friend after what she did to you when I was gone. My mom doesn't know how ug-ly her true face is. Once she finds out, she'll stop talking about her,"" I replied angrily.

Even remembering how Sarah treated Jessica made my blood boil. Because of her, Jessica had to endure so many difficulties and traumas.

""Relax, babe. She's gone now. We don't have to worry about her,"" Jessica assured me, caressing my hand.

I smiled at her as the waiter brought our dinner. We ate while discussing the arrangements for my parents' anniversary party. Once we were done, I paid the bill, and we drove back to my penthouse.

I moved out of my parent's house two years ago and bought my place. After Jessica and I started dating, I asked her to move in with me. She's partially moved in, but she hasn't fully moved in yet.

As soon as we stepped into the penthouse, I slammed my li-ps against Jessica's. I grabbed her hair, causing her to tilt her head back, and I started kissing her neck hungrily, making her moan loudly.

Soon, we ended up on the couch. By this time, I had successfully removed her dress. She lay beneath me in her black lingerie, looking at me seductively as she started unbuttoning my shirt. Once she removed my shirt, followed by my pants, she took my member in her hand and began stroking it.

The room filled with our loud moans.

We ended up going for a second round and then showered together. Afterwards, we were so exhausted that we went straight to bed. I hugged her tightly in my arms, and soon, we both fell asleep.

Chapter 4

Adrian P.O.V

The past few days have been chaotic, as my parents' wedding anniversary is approaching. I've been busy with the arrangements for the party. It's also the day I plan to officially tell my parents about Jessica and my intention to marry her by the end of the year.

I even bought a ring for Jessica. If everything goes well, I'll propose to her at the party in front of everyone.

I looked up when I heard a knock on my office door and saw my father, James Parker, walking in with a serious expression.

""How are you, son? We hardly see you these days. Your mom misses you a lot,"" he said, sitting on the couch.

""I've just been caught up with work, Dad. I'll definitely visit Mom today,"" I replied while scanning some important files.

""I need to discuss something important with you. It's about the company."" I put my file down and turned to face him, waiting for him to continue.

""Since you've taken over the company, your mother and I think it's time for you to settle down. You'll be turning 26 this year, and we believe it's time for you to get married.""

Hearing this, I thought it was the perfect moment to tell him about Jessica, but before I could, he continued.

""We've decided you should marry the granddaughter of Stephen D'Amario. She's the heiress of the D'Amario family. Mr D'Amario was a close friend of your grandfather, so it would be a perfect match,"" my father revealed with a big smile.

I was in complete shock. I couldn't imagine marrying anyone other than Jessica.

""No, Dad, I don't want to marry anyone else. I've already decided what I want in life, and marrying some heiress isn't part of it,"" I said angrily.

""In that case, the company will be transferred to Mr. D'Amario's granddaughter. Your grandfather and Mr. D'Amario signed an agreement that you and his granddaughter must marry, allowing the Parker and D'Amario companies to merge for mutual benefit,"" he said calmly.

""I'm still not marrying her. To he-ll with this danm agreement!"" I snapped angrily.

""Oh, son, you must marry her. If you refuse, 40% of Parker Enterprises will go to her. If she refuses, 40% of D'Amario Enterprises will come to us. If you both refuse, 50% of each company's shares will go to charity,"" he explained.

I heaved a big sigh, annoyed and worried about how to explain this to Jessica. Every plan I made for us seemed to be crumbling.

""I'll leave now; your mother is probably waiting for me,"" he said, walking out of my office.

As I pondered this new problem, my phone rang. It was Jessica. I answered, and her sweet voice came through the line.

""Hey, babe! Are you still at the office? Did you forget about our date night at my place?"" she asked.

I had completely forgotten about the date night due to my busy schedule, but I quickly covered my negligence.

""Of course, love. I can't wait to see you,"" I said, smirking at the thought of holding her in my arms tonight.

""Alright, see you at 7 then. Bye, love you,"" she said.

""Love you too, babe."" I hung up and went back to thinking about how to handle this marriage situation. How would Jessica react?

I immediately called my best friend, Noah. He's the COO of Parker Enterprises. We met in boarding school, and we've been best friends ever since.

I picked up the intercom and called my secretary. ""Could you please ask Mr. Andrews to come to my office immediately?""

Within 10 minutes, Noah walked in. ""Hey, everything good?"" he asked as he sat down across from me.

""My father wants me to marry Mr. D'Amario's granddaughter, or else the company goes to charity.""

""What?! No way. We've worked so hard for the company these past two years. It would all be wasted if it goes to charity,"" Noah exclaimed. ""What about Jessica? Did you tell her?""

""Not yet, bro. I'm planning to tell her tonight,"" I replied, massaging my temples.

""Isn't D'Amario Enterprises owned by Neil Darrell?"" Noah asked.

I immediately realized he was right. ""If Neil Darrell is running D'Amario Enterprises, then the granddaughter I'm supposed to marry is Chloe Darrell,"" I said, connecting the dots.

""Exactly. You can talk to Jessica about this. She can easily convince Chloe to refuse the proposal since they're best friends,"" Noah suggested.

""That's what I was thinking. I need to get to Jessica's place now."" I quickly left the office and headed to Jessica's apartment.

I arrived and rang the bell. Within seconds, she opened the door. A smile formed on my face as I saw her. She wrapped her arms around my shoulders and kissed me. I kissed her back passionately. Soon, we were undressed and made our way to the bedroom. After hours of being together, we finally went downstairs for dinner.

I or-dered sushi since Jessica can barely cook. To be honest, she's a terrible cook—she can hardly boil water—but she's perfect in every other way, and she's all I want.

We finished dinner, talking about our day when I suddenly remembered the conversation with my dad.

""Babe, I need to tell you something important,"" I said, holding her hands close to my che-st.

I explained the entire situation, from the marriage proposal to the merger, and the consequences if we backed out.

Before I could tell her about Chloe, she snapped at me angrily, ""So you want to leave me and marry some random brat now?""

""No, babe, the only person I want to marry is you. I can't even think of marrying someone else,"" I reassured her.

""And this marriage won't happen. All you need to do is convince Chloe to refuse the proposal.""

""Chloe? What does she have to do with this proposal?"" she asked.

""She's the granddaughter I'm supposed to marry, and since she's your best friend, you can easily convince her to refuse,"" I explained.

A smile formed on her li-ps, and she hugged me tightly.

""That can be done easily. She's dating Justin now, so I doubt she'd ever want to marry you,"" she said happily.

""And I'll never marry or love anyone but you,"" I told her, pressing my kiss to her forehead.

Chapter 5

Sarah P.O.V

I felt tense and doomed after hearing what Grandpa and Grandma told me. They arrived in the States last night, and today they've given me the biggest shock of my life.

According to them, I must marry for the merger or lose a 40% share of Amario Enterprises. Before they could finish their next sentence, I slammed my hands on my lap and stood up.

""I can't accept this proposal, Grandpa. I just graduated, and right now, I want to explore new things. I don't want to get married so soon.""

""Sweetheart, we're not forcing you, but we want someone strong to take care of you. Grandpa and I are getting old, dear; we won't always be here to support you. That's why we want you to be secure and happy,"" Grandma said, making me sit down again as she held my hands.

I thought about everything happening. When it comes to marriage, love, respect, and trust are the pillars of happiness.

I've always been nervous about relationships, scared of rejection and being unloved.

I feared I'd be the one trying to maintain the relationship while the other person didn't care.

""Sarah, we always want what's best for you. But remember, if you reject this proposal, the company will be ruined. This company was your mother's dream. Sophia worked hard to bring it to where it is today. But honey, we don't want to force you,"" Grandpa said, comforting me.

Thinking about my mother, I wondered what she would do in my place. Would she accept this to save the company? She worked tirelessly until her illness confined her to bed.

""Grandpa, I need to think this over. I'll let you know my decision soon,"" I said with a weak smile and left.

I went to my room and closed the door. I lay on my bed, replaying the conversation with Grandpa and Grandma.

I never thought I'd get married so soon, let alone just for the sake of the company. But deep down, I knew this company held my mother's memories, her hard work, and her dream of making Amario Enterprises one of the leading companies in the world.

I always thought that when I married, it would be for love, not a business arrangement.

I never had time to date in high school; I was always busy with studies and a part-time job. If any guy tried to ask me out, Chloe and Jessica made sure I never went.

I still remember the night after graduation when there was a party at our house.

FLASHBACK

I was in my room, checking my email about the applications I had submitted to various universities. I could hear the loud music coming from downstairs.

Chloe had invited everyone to the party. She even asked me to join, but I politely declined, knowing she and Jessica would likely have a plan to humiliate me again.

Suddenly, I heard a knock on my door. I closed my laptop and walked over. Opening it, I saw Justin standing there, holding two cans of beer.

""Hey, Sarah!"" he greeted me and walked into my room, sitting on my bed and looking around.

""Hey, Justin! What brings you here?"" I asked, walking towards him.

Justin was in the same grade as me and Chloe. He was one of the popular guys in high school. We weren't close friends, but we had worked on some projects and assignments together. He seemed like a genuine guy.

""Why are you sitting here alone? Why didn't you come downstairs and join us?"" he asked.

""Well, I don't like loud music, and I'm not used to these parties. Besides, I had some important work to do,"" I told him.

""Oh, that's alright. Everyone has their own tastes and choices,"" he said, offering me one of the beers he was holding. I politely declined.

""C'mon, relax a bit, Sarah. One beer won't harm you,"" he chuckled.

I hesitated but eventually accepted the beer and took a sip.

One beer won't harm me.

""So, what are your plans after high school?"" he asked, drinking his beer.

""Well, I'm planning to study architecture, but I haven't decided which university to choose.""

Before I could say more, I started feeling dizzy. I could hear Justin talking, but I couldn't understand what he was saying.

I could faintly hear Chloe and Jessica's voices inside the room. I heard them talking, but I couldn't make out the words.

Jessica's voice came closer as she whispered in my right ear.

""Let's have some fun, Sarah,"" she said, laughing wickedly.

I tried to get up, but Chloe pushed me back onto the bed. My T-shirt was yanked off aggressively, and my jeans were pulled down. I tried to shout for help, but no words came out. I could hear Chloe, Jessica, and Justin giggling.

I was lying there in just my underwear. Someone pulled me closer, and I heard Justin whisper something in my ear. All I could understand was that they were up to something terrible.

Justin gripped my waist, then started svcking on my neck.

""Please... don't,"" I begged them.

But they didn't stop. After a few minutes, I heard Jessica say it was enough; they'd gotten what they wanted.

I sighed in relief, but then I felt someone tugging at my hair. Before I could react, they started cutting it. I struggled with what little energy I had left, but a sharp kick to my ribs knocked me out.

FLASHBACK ENDS

When I regained consciousness, it was already the next day. I was still on the bed, my underwear tor-n. When I looked in the mirror, I saw bruises around my ribs and belly. My hair was nearly all gone—I was almost bald.

Jessica, Justin, and Chloe had made a video of me and Justin in bed. In the video, only my face was visible, while only Justin's back was shown.

They shared the video on every social media platform, and the whole school assumed I had shot it and shared it to gain popularity.

I even told Dad, but he blamed me for not being careful. Later, he chose to believe others, thinking I had purposely shared the video.

A tear slipped down my cheek, but I quickly wiped it away. Because of that night, I couldn't trust any guy. Although I managed to overcome this fear when I moved to Boston, becoming more comfortable around new people, I still struggled.

I even went on a few dates, but things never progressed. I was still uncomfortable with intimacy and trusting anyone.

Thinking about the marriage proposal, I realized I still didn't know who I was supposed to marry. All I knew from Grandpa was that he was the young CEO of a rapidly growing construction company.

I spent the whole night tossing and turning in bed, thinking about the marriage and the company merger.

By 4 a.m., after a night of deep contemplation, I was finally ready with my decision.

Chapter 6

Sarah P.O.V

It was nearly 11 in the morning, and I was ready with my decision. I went downstairs and knocked on Grandpa's door; he opened it.

I walked into the room and saw Grandma sitting on the couch, reading a magazine. I sat next to her while Grandpa sat across from us. I cleared my throat before speaking.

""Grandpa, Grandma, I've made my decision. I want to save my mother's company; I don't want to lose Amario Enterprises. I'm ready for the marriage,"" I told them.

As soon as I finished speaking, I saw both my grandparents beaming with happiness. Grandma immediately hugged me tightly.

""Oh Sarah, I knew you would make the right decision. I'm sure this marriage and merger will bring much happiness to your life,"" Grandpa said while kissing my forehead.

""I'm sure you'll fulfil the responsibilities of both a wife and the new CEO of Amario Enterprises,"" Grandma said, clasping her hands together.

Both Grandma and Grandpa started discussing the merger and wedding. It had been ages since I'd seen them this happy. When Mom was alive, we always spent our vacations with Grandpa and Grandma.

We used to have so much fun then; Mom and Grandma would bake cakes and muffins together, while Dad and Grandpa taught me horseback riding and swimming.

Those were some of my happiest memories with my family.

Thinking of my father made me realize it had been five years since I'd seen him.

During those years, he never contacted me, and I didn't make any effort either. Before moving back here, I hoped he might visit, but it's been nearly a month since I returned, and he hasn't shown up.

""Sarah, dear, you'll be coming with me to Amario Enterprises tomorrow to sign the documents. You'll also meet your fiancé before signing,"" Grandpa informed me.

""Yes, dear, it would be good if you two met and got to know each other before the wedding,"" Grandma added.

I gave them a weak smile, but deep inside, I was nervous about the whole situation. Suddenly, it occurred to me that I still didn't know the name of the person I was marrying.

""Grandpa, may I know the name of the person I'm marrying?"" I asked.

""Oh! Well, his name is Adrian Parker, the CEO of Parker Enterprises,"" he replied.

As soon as he said the name, I felt the ground slip from under my feet.

""Adrian Parker? The son of James and Lauren Parker?"" I asked, hoping it wasn't him.

""Yes, sweetheart, he's the one,"" he answered.

I was utterly shocked. He was the same Adrian Parker who used to be my friend—a friend who abandoned me and our friendship.

""I'll see you later; I have some work to do,"" I told them and kissed their cheeks.

I immediately grabbed my car keys and started driving without a specific destination. After an hour, I found myself standing in front of my mother's grave.

I sat there for hours, remembering how happy our lives were when she was alive. Maybe I wouldn't be in this situation if she were here. Maybe I would have had a normal life with a happy family.

But now, everything is different; nothing is as I imagined or wished.

I still remember Adrian Parker, the guy who used to be one of my close friends along with Jessica, but it's been years since we talked or saw each other.

When he left for London, we three promised to stay connected no matter what. Even when Jessica started ignoring me, Adrian and I stayed in touch through emails, social media, and calls.

But slowly, the calls became less frequent, and eventually, he stopped calling altogether. I tried reaching out, but my calls went to voicemail. We were still connected through messages and emails, but by the end of sophomore year, he stopped replying.

Occasionally, I overheard Jessica and Chloe talking about Adrian. I heard them discuss the plans Adrian and Jessica made for her visit to London that summer.

It became clear he was purposely avoiding me. Maybe he chose Jessica over me, though all I wanted was for us three to stay friends. But they both decided to throw me out of their lives as if our friendship meant nothing to them.

FLASHBACK

It had been almost two years since I last heard from Adrian. He visited New York every summer, and he came for vacation that year too. I saw him hanging out with Chloe and Jessica the other day.

I was in my room, finishing up a painting, when I heard noises from downstairs, indicating Chloe had brought her friends over again.

I decided to ignore them and continue my work. After finishing my painting, I heard my stomach growl. I quickly put on my hoodie and went to the kitchen to grab something to eat. As I headed back to my room, holding a mug of hot coffee, I heard Chloe call from the living room.

""Hey Sarah, what are you doing alone? Come join us,"" she said.

""No, thanks, I've got some work to do,"" I politely declined. I was about to leave when I suddenly heard Adrian's voice.

""C'mon, Sarah, join us. A few minutes won't hurt,"" he insisted.

Though my instincts told me not to, I decided to join them for a few minutes. I walked into the living room, holding my coffee mug. I saw familiar faces from school, including Jessica and Justin.

I smiled and looked at Adrian. It had been so long since I'd seen him up close. As I walked toward the couch, Chloe stuck out her leg, causing me to lose my balance. I fell flat on the floor, spilling my coffee all over Jessica. Before I could even stand, Chloe started shouting.

""You did that on purpose, didn't you, Sarah? You're always finding ways to harm or insult Jessica,"" she yelled.

""I didn't do it on purpose; I'm so sorry, Jessica,"" I said, standing up.

""Ah, it's fine, Sarah,"" Jessica said, though I could see the smirk on her face.

""No, it's not fine. You did that on purpose. Adrian, this isn't the first time she's harmed Jessica,"" Chloe said, as Adrian was busy wiping Jessica with cold water.

""I knew you always hated Jessica, but I didn't know you could actually hurt her,"" Adrian said angrily.

Before I could defend myself, Adrian grabbed me harshly and pushed me out of the room.

""Get out of here; I don't want someone like you near me or Jessica.""

I could sense his anger and hatred in his voice, but I also saw his concern for Jessica in his eyes. Without further explanation, I ran to my room and shut the door behind me. I knew Chloe and Jessica would torture me again once everyone left, as I had ruined their evening.

I was angry at myself for being a coward; I was tired of being weak and fragile.

FLASHBACK ENDS

That was the last time I saw him. After that, I did my best to avoid him, especially around Jessica and Chloe.

And now, I'm supposed to marry him. How can this happen?

I sat there for hours, thinking about everything, remembering my family and mother. Finally, as it grew dark, I decided to go home.

""You need to be strong, Sarah. You can survive this.""

Chapter 7

Adrian P.O.V

Tomorrow is the day we sign the agreement with Amario Enterprises. I was anxious about the marriage and merger, but Jessica reassured me that Chloe would handle everything.

She explained the entire situation the other day, and we discussed the plan regarding the agreement last evening.

""Dad hasn't mentioned anything about this agreement yet. Maybe he's waiting until the last minute so I can't back out. What if he doesn't listen to me if I refuse to marry?"" Chloe asked nervously.

Chloe had a point. What if her dad didn't accept her decision?

""Don't worry, I have a backup plan,"" Jessica interrupted.

Noah stepped into the room carrying his coffee and sat beside me.

""What are you guys talking about?"" Noah asked as he placed his cup on the table.

""About how to decline the marriage agreement without Adrian losing his company,"" Jessica informed him.

""Well, as I was saying, the backup plan is if Chloe's father opposes her decision, Adrian and Chloe can proceed with the agreement and get engaged. But as the wedding day approaches, you can back out,"" Jessica explained. Noah looked amused, while Chloe still seemed confused.

Stella Grant said, ""Jessi, have you thought about what we talked about last time? Your grandfather's seriously ill. You're the only child your dad and I have. Are you really still not coming home to take over the company?""

In the dim light, Jessica added the final stroke to a painting of a family of three.

Just as Stella thought she'd failed to convince her daughter again, Jessica suddenly spoke, ""Okay.""

Stella froze, clearly caught off guard. ""Y-you're saying yes?""

""Yes."" Jessica's voice was calm. ""I'll do it. But I need some time to wrap things up here. I'll be back in 15 days.""

After a few more words, she ended the call.

Jessica stepped out of the room and looked down at the three people in the living room.

Her eyes landed on the man sitting on the couch—Brian Atkinson. His features were striking, sharp without being harsh.

He had a quiet, restrained kind of presence. His shirt and slacks were perfectly tailored, the collar buttoned all the way to the top. He looked every bit the picture of elegance and control.

This was Jessica's husband, the man she had insisted on marrying even though it meant turning down her family's arrangement and cutting ties with them.

In Hartdale, Brian held tremendous power and was always serious and distant. People around him saw him as cold and untouchable, yet now he was speaking to another woman in a gentle tone.

Beside them, a boy around five years old with delicate features, Jacob Atkinson, threw himself into the woman's arms. Blinking his wide eyes, he said sweetly, ""Maddie, I want fish casserole. Will you make it for me?""

Madeline Houghton tapped his nose with a fond smile. ""Of course.""

Jacob's eyes lit up, clearly thrilled. He remarked, ""Maddie, you're the best. Not like my mom—she never lets me eat too much."" As he spoke, he even pouted a little.

Madeline smiled and gently coaxed him, ""Then you've got to eat a little extra today, Jake.""

Jacob nodded with a warm chuckle. ""Maddie, I wish you were my real mom.""

Madeline's smile deepened.

Upstairs, Jessica felt a dull ache in her chest. She always thought kids tended to overeat when they liked something. She only watched Jacob's diet because she didn't want him to get sick. That was all.

Jessica didn't feel like watching any longer. That was her husband and her son, but somehow, the three of them looked more like a real family. She was the one who seemed out of place.

She turned around and went back into the room.

Not long after, footsteps came from outside. Madeline walked in. Her makeup was flawless, her smile gentle. ""Jessi, come downstairs with me. Let's celebrate Jake's birthday together.""

Madeline used to be Jessica's intern. She came from a poor background and was barely competent.

Jessica had once listened to Madeline cry about her past, saying that if she still couldn't find a job, she would have no choice but to go back to her hometown and get married.

Jessica had felt sorry for her and brought her into the company. She never imagined she'd end up bringing in the very woman who would destroy her family.

Madeline had studied her, mimicked her, and tried to take her place—to become the new Mrs. Atkinson. By the time Jessica realized it, Madeline had already made her way into the household, getting along perfectly with her husband and son.

Jessica had long seen through the mask Madeline wore and had hated herself for bringing trouble into her own home. Jessica said coldly, ""I'm not feeling well. I'm not going.""

Madeline spoke with feigned innocence, ""Jessi, you're Jake's mom. It would mean a lot to him if you said happy birthday to him.""

Jessica frowned, about to turn her down again. But then something crossed her mind, and she let out a sigh.

She figured this was between her and Madeline. Jacob was still just a child who shouldn't be affected by it. As his mother, Jessica felt it was only right to wish him a happy birthday.

With that thought, she set down her paintbrush and walked downstairs, brushing past Madeline's shoulder, completely ignoring her.

For a split second, Madeline's smile froze. A flicker of malice passed through her eyes, but she quickly followed after.

When Jessica saw Brian and Jacob, she paused.

Ten years ago, she'd joined the Atkinson Group to challenge herself and met Brian there. They'd fought, teased, and fallen into marriage. She had rejected her family's carefully laid plans and insisted on marrying Brian, even cutting ties with them to do it.

For the past ten years, she'd never once regretted her decision. Her husband was rich, handsome, and he treated her well. Their son was smart and adorable. She had once truly believed she had a happy life.

But then, Jessica looked at Madeline, who was smiling attentively as she served food to Brian and Jacob. Madeline's presence had changed everything that once felt so perfect.

Jessica silently picked up her fork to eat, but then a wave of nausea hit her. She quickly put the fork down and rushed to the bathroom, gagging over the sink.

Brian stood up, looking concerned, about to follow her, but Madeline stopped him in a flurry of panic.

She clutched his sleeve, her eyes wide with worry. ""Mr. Atkinson, what's going on with Jessi?""

Brian spoke gently, trying to reassure her, ""She's been like this lately. It's nothing. Don't worry.""

After saying that, he turned to look at Jessica and sneered coldly, ""What's the excuse this time? A cold? Or is the food at home not good enough?""

Jessica didn't respond. She wiped the corner of her mouth with a tissue and thought, 'If I said I was pregnant, would they even believe me?

'Forget it. I'm leaving soon anyway. Why bother telling them? No need to ruin the sweet little bond between my husband and his mistress.'

Even as a secretary, Madeline still dared to chide her boss, speaking in a syrupy tone, ""Mr. Atkinson, don't say that about Jessi. Maybe she really isn't feeling well. She's lost a lot of weight lately.""

Then she stood up, made a cup of hot chamomile tea, and handed it to Jessica. ""Jessi, are you okay? Here, have some chamomile tea.""

Still nauseous and not wanting to see Madeline's face, Jessica grew irritated and pushed her away.

She hadn't even used much force, but Madeline let herself fall with the motion, and the hot chamomile tea spilled onto her own hand.

""Ow!"" Madeline cried out.

""Maddie,"" Brian and Jacob called out at the same time. They instantly rushed to her side, their eyes full of concern as they looked at her hand which was scalded red.

Jacob's eyes welled with tears, feeling sorry for her. ""Maddie, does it hurt a lot?""

Madeline forced a smile and tried to look strong. ""It's okay, Jake. I was just being careless. It doesn't hurt.""

Brian glared at Jessica, his eyes blazing. His voice was like ice. ""What are you trying to pull now?""

Jessica was overwhelmed with sadness and disappointment. She caught the smug look in Madeline's eyes, then saw her own son standing in front of Madeline like a little protector. Jessica shut her eyes in despair and said, ""I didn't do anything.""

But Brian didn't believe her. When the family doctor arrived, Brian helped Madeline sit down, letting her lean against his chest. There was disappointment in his deep-set eyes as well.

He said accusingly, ""Jessi, you've changed. You were never the kind of person to do something like this out of jealousy.""

Jessica thought, 'I've changed? Yeah, I have.'

Ten years ago, she wouldn't have had stretch marks from childbirth. Her skin wouldn't have gone dull from staying up all night.

And she definitely wouldn't have quit her job and become a housewife just because of Brian's words—only to be replaced by another woman.

Jessica suddenly felt exhausted. She held back the explanation she almost gave and turned to head upstairs.

Right before entering her room, she looked back down at the chaotic scene below and gave one last glance at the husband and son she had once loved with everything she had.

Brian and Jacob were still the same, hovering around Madeline, the three of them tangled up like they couldn't bear to be apart.

Jessica gave a bitter smile and shook her head. Then she gently touched her belly and set a countdown on her phone. Without a trace of hesitation, she turned and went back into the room.

From this moment on, she wouldn't disturb them again.

# Chapter 2 She Was Done Playing Along

The noise outside gradually faded. Jessica didn't bother to check what was going on out there. With her earplugs and sleep mask on, she slept straight through to morning.

Since she'd already decided to return and claim her inheritance, she had to resign from Atkinson Group.

After giving birth to Jacob, she had rarely shown up at the company. But back when Brian had taken over the family business, she had been right there beside him, helping him build everything from the ground up.

Atkinson Group's rise to the number-one spot in the country had a lot to do with her. So even though she didn't come in regularly, she still received a generous annual bonus and profit share.

Early in the morning, Jessica looked at herself in the mirror. Her thick, wavy hair framed a flawless face. She was stunning, but her eyes carried no light.

She had always been beautiful. Even after becoming a stay-at-home mom, even after all the sleepless nights and labor, her looks had barely changed.

But the morning sickness, the emotional strain, and the cold treatment from her family had taken their toll. Her eyes were dull, lifeless—like fish washed up on the shore.

On the top floor of Atkinson Group, Jessica was waiting for her resignation papers to be printed.

Just then, a few employees behind her started chatting, their voices drifting into earshot.

One said, ""Did you see Madeline's Instagram post?""

Another asked, ""No, what did she post this time?""

Someone else added, ""She posted a bunch of stuff. Looks like she was throwing someone a birthday party. You should check it out.""

They were laughing as they teased each other, but when they looked up and saw Jessica, their smiles froze.

One of them gasped, ""Ms. Grant?""

Another asked, ""Ms. Grant, what brings you here to the office?""

Jessica gave a casual nod. As soon as the employees finished greeting her, they dashed away in a hurry. More whispers followed as they left.

Someone sneered, ""What a buzzkill. What's the executive secretary Jessica doing back here at the company?""

Another said sarcastically, ""She's already the CEO's wife. What's the point of showing off in front of us?""

Someone else snorted, ""I don't think Mr. Atkinson's that close to her anymore. I wouldn't be surprised if they're getting a divorce.""

Jessica didn't react. She had never been popular in the company and had long gotten used to this kind of talk.

If she hadn't gone through so much workplace bullying in the past—if Brian hadn't stepped in and helped her so many times—she wouldn't have fallen for him to begin with.

Bored from waiting, Jessica opened Instagram on her phone. The first thing that popped up was a nine-photo post from Madeline.

The first image was taken at Jacob's birthday party last night. The decorations were extravagant, and the giant three-tier cake in the center was impossible to miss.

What caught Jessica's eye was a photo taken in a hospital. Three hands, all different sizes, stacked on top of each other—it looked so warm and loving.

Jessica thought, 'It was just a burn. Why'd they go to the hospital again?'

She found it ridiculous and scrolled through the comments. Most of them were full of envy and well-wishes.

One comment read: \[Wow, a birthday party for the little one? Looks so happy.\]

Another joked: \[Showing off again—so who's your husband anyway? Not gonna show your bestie?\]

Someone else wrote: \[No matter what happens, as long as the family's together, that's what really matters.\]

Jessica was speechless. She knew Madeline had posted those on purpose, just to get under her skin and push her into snapping at Brian.

If it had been before, Jessica really wouldn't have been able to stand this pretentious act, watching her own husband and son leave her at home to care for a woman who had done nothing but poorly imitate her from the start.

But now that she was about to leave, she naturally didn't care anymore.

Jessica gave a dry smile and tapped the screen lightly to give the post a like.

After getting her resignation papers, Jessica went straight to the CEO's office and handed them to Brian's current personal assistant.

The people in the Secretary's Office, just like the ones who had been whispering earlier, looked down on her for showing up as if she were trying to brag. But the moment they saw the resignation papers, they gasped in shock.

Someone asked, ""I-I didn't read that wrong, did I?""

""Ms. Grant is quitting?"" another exclaimed.

The assistant froze, visibly panicked. ""M-Ma'am, Mr. Atkinson is in a very important meeting right now. Maybe we should wait and let him have a look at these until he's done.""

""No need. I'm just a figurehead executive secretary. You have the authority to process this. No need to bother him,"" Jessica said with a light smile.

People around them sighed under their breath.

""Is the rumor true? Jessica and Mr. Atkinson are getting a divorce? And the other woman is Madeline?""

""Why Madeline? Doesn't she have a family?""

""Are you dumb? Did you even see that Instagram post? That hand is clearly Mr. Atkinson's. Who else in Hartdale could wear a Rolex that expensive?""

""Exactly. Didn't you notice Madeline took over all of Jessica's work after she went on maternity leave?""

""Now that Jessica's quitting, maybe she's handing the position over.""

Jessica knew exactly how nosy these people were. In the past, hearing things like this would've crushed her. She would've curled up in bed at night, crying quietly under the covers.

But now, she suddenly realized that once she let it go, none of it really mattered.

She smiled at everyone like she couldn't hear a word and said, ""Thank you all for your hard work these past ten years. I hope Atkinson Group continues to thrive for many more to come.""

Everyone fell silent in embarrassment. Only then did Jessica return to her desk and begin packing up everything she'd accumulated over the years.

She had worked here for ten years, and her workspace was filled to the brim with books she'd bought when she first started out and notes she'd taken while learning to understand Brian as his secretary.

On one page, it clearly said: ""1. He needs a cup of hand-ground coffee every morning. 2. He hates being late. 3. He doesn't allow any woman to wear perfume around him.""

There were many notes like that. Every single one of them had been built with Jessica's effort.

She had poured so much into doing her job as a secretary well, but people always assumed the role was just a man's plaything—that all it took was a body, not a brain.

Only Brian had seen her working late into the night—reviewing contracts, building presentations, digging into the background on every competitor of Atkinson Group, and reciting business reports like they were second nature.

It was because she worked hard enough that someone as untouchable as Brian had come down from his pedestal to get close to her.

Jessica had once believed Brian was the one person who truly understood her. She was wrong. After ten years, all those memories and feelings had turned to dust.

She focused on packing her things. Just then, the meeting ended, and Madeline walked out first.

She had been beaming, but the moment she saw Jessica, her smile froze. Madeline thought, 'Why is Jessica here? Did she see my Instagram post? Is she here to lose it on me?

Just thinking about it made her excited. She went back to her desk, restless, waiting for the storm to hit. On the outside, though, she kept her head down, her eyes turning red, like she'd just been horribly wronged.

Brian was the last to walk out. As he passed the Secretary's Office, he saw Jessica there at the office.

Her desk was the closest to his office, a setup that once symbolized her status and their past affection.

But now, just the sight of her annoyed him especially when she looked like she was in a good mood, flipping through a book with a faint smile on her face.

Right next to her, Madeline sat with her head down, looking dejected, quietly dabbing at her tears with a tissue.

Brian frowned, tapped the corner of Jessica's desk, and ordered, ""Come in.""

Jessica looked up, calm and composed. ""Okay.""

Once she stepped inside, Brian got straight to the point. ""The company doesn't need you right now. If there's no special reason, don't come to Atkinson Group again.""

# Chapter 3 Mrs. Atkinson

Jessica froze. No matter how many times she'd been disappointed by Brian, every time she heard his cold tone, it still felt like a knife stabbing straight into her chest.

Her eyes lowered, and the smile on her face disappeared. ""Okay.""

Brian had expected Jessica to lash out, but he hadn't thought she'd give in so easily. Only then did he actually look at her.

He noticed Madeline was right—Jessica really had lost a lot of weight lately.

He thought, 'Maybe Jessica really was throwing up last night because she wasn't feeling well. Maybe she wasn't being jealous in front of Madeline after all.'

His lips pressed together, and his tone softened slightly. ""Madeline's been doing your job well. Your focus now should be taking care of Jake. I've explained this to you so many times—there's nothing between me and her.

""Jessi, stop making trouble. Don't make me regret choosing you to be my wife.""

Jessica thought, 'Regret? I regret it too. I really regret giving up my family's business just to become this so-called Mrs. Atkinson. The Grant family has real status. Grant Group is powerful. I could've gone back and been the heiress everyone doted on instead.'

Jessica closed her eyes and calmly pulled out her resignation letter. Her tone was polite but distant. ""Mr. Atkinson, then please go ahead and approve this. I'll officially resign starting tomorrow.""

With that, she turned to leave. But just as she reached the door, Brian grabbed her arm.

""Jessica?"" Brian sounded surprised, as if he hadn't fully processed what was happening. Holding the resignation in one hand, he instinctively reached out and caught her.

He stared at her signature on the resignation letter. His face darkened as he held back a surge of anger. ""You're doing this to spite me? I thought you came today to make peace, but now you're taking it even further?""

""No, Mr. Atkinson. You said Atkinson Group didn't need me, and it just so happens—I feel the same."" Jessica kept her gaze lowered, her thick lashes trembling slightly. ""It's been ten years. Atkinson Group isn't what it used to be.

""Since everyone clearly loves Madeline, I figured I might as well step down now instead of holding a position and collecting a paycheck for doing nothing.""

Brian let out a cold laugh. His eyes were sharp, like he could see straight through her excuse. ""Don't use the past ten years to guilt me. I know Atkinson Group wouldn't be what it is today without you. You were a great employee.

""But Jessica, ever since you had the baby, you haven't been involved in any business matters. I've been nothing but considerate. All you have to do is take care of our son, and you'll always be the lady of Atkinson Group.

""You can't even handle something this simple, and now you say you're stepping aside? All you're doing is putting Madeline in a difficult position. Jessica, I know you too well. You're calculating, but don't be cruel. Since last night, have you even apologized to Maddie?""

Jessica thought, 'Apologize? I'm supposed to apologize to the woman who wrecked my home? Shouldn't she be the one thanking me?'

Suddenly, Jessica let out a laugh and looked at Brian with a hint of curiosity. ""Yes, I'm cruel. Mr. Atkinson, have you never considered giving up?""

The kind of giving up she meant was divorce.

Over the past few years, whenever Brian and Jessica fought, she brought up divorce again and again, and every time it ended in an ugly stalemate.

Brian had never agreed. In his eyes, even if he cheated, Jessica was still his wife.

That was always how it was with Brian—domineering and controlling, a man who held power over all of Hartdale.

As for Jessica, at the beginning, she hadn't really meant to leave. She had been acting out, like Brian said, hoping he'd actually care more about her.

But now, she was tired. She was fine with getting a divorce and going their separate ways. She even thought about the kids. They could each take one, and that would be that.

Brian's face darkened, his grip on her arm tightening like he could snap her in half. ""This is your last chance, Jessica. If you mess up again, I won't hesitate to find Jake a new mom.

""Do you know how many times he's complained to me he has no joy or freedom living with you? Why are you such a failure as both a wife and a mother?""

The word ""failure"" made her close her eyes and let out a long breath.

Jessica thought, 'So that's how it is. Waiting up all night for Brian to come home and making him hangover cures was a failure. Hand-washing his designer suits in the dead of winter until my hands were raw was a failure.

'Tutoring Jake through elementary math, raising a child who fit the Atkinson family's image of an heir was a failure. This home really has no place for me anymore.'

""I'm sorry, Mr. Atkinson,"" Jessica said sincerely. She believed someone who failed should take a final bow and leave the stage.

Her other hand slipped into her coat pocket and tapped her phone screen. The countdown began—there were fourteen days left.

Once everything was in order, she would disappear completely. Brian would never have to be annoyed by her again.

Jessica's attitude caught Brian off guard. He still wanted to say something, but she didn't give him the chance and turned to leave.

She walked away without hesitation. Brian reached out again, but caught nothing.

Suddenly, a sharp pain clenched in his chest, a wave of panic rising fast and hard.

He frowned, watching her disappear down the hall, a strange sense growing stronger—that something important was slipping further and further away from him.

Once outside, Jessica called her best friend, Gabriela Clark. They were besties, though they hadn't spoken in over six years.

Gabriela was a fashion designer, constantly flying around the country, tailoring clothes for different models. A lot of them were male, and with adults working in close quarters, it wasn't unusual for things to happen.

Put plainly, Gabriela went through boyfriends like outfits. Brian had always hated that about her. After Jessica had their child, he'd told her to stay away from Gabriela, said she'd be a bad influence on Jacob.

So Jessica had listened and cut ties with the friend she grew up with for six whole years.

After not hearing from Jessica for years, Gabriela was furious. She picked up and snapped, ""So you finally remembered I exist? Jessica, I thought you were way too far gone in your lovesick haze. And now you finally call—what, regretting it already?""

Jessica let out a helpless laugh, tears falling before she even noticed.

She hadn't cried when Brian humiliated her, hadn't cried when Madeline made a fool of her, not even when the child she carried for nine months called someone else Mom. But with Gabriela, Jessica sobbed in regret.

""Yes, I regret it,"" Jessica said. ""Gabi, if I come back now, is it too late?""

On the other end of the line, Gabriela went quiet for a long time after hearing Jessica's sincere words. When she finally spoke again, her voice was choked with tears.

She said, ""I'm just glad you've come to your senses. You idiot, do you have any idea how exhausting it's been running the studio for you all these years? The entire art world's been waiting for your return.

""Jessica, being a CEO's secretary only buried your talent. You were born to be an artist—you're the last true gem of the Impressionist world. Jessi, I've been waiting for you this whole time.""

""I'm sorry, Gabi. I'm so sorry."" Jessica crouched down in the middle of the street, crying.

Jessica was always meant to be proud. She had been brilliant and talented from the start. Even Brian didn't know that she had studied fine art at a university in Fiorenelle, a city in Aurevia.

Her very first graduation piece had made it into the Viremont Grand Biennale, shocking the entire art world.

After graduation, the paintings she signed off on had sold at auction for more than a million dollars.

And yet, for the sake of so-called experience, she came back to the country and started over in a job that had nothing to do with her field. She studied admin, finance, and business management from scratch and still excelled at it.

She gave up painting for ten years. But today, she had finally decided—she was going back.

# Chapter 4 Her Ungrateful Son

After agreeing on a time with Gabriela to take over the studio, Jessica returned to Atkinson Villa.

She had given herself a 15-day countdown because ten years had left too many things unresolved. She couldn't just walk away. There were still matters to handle.

The most important of all was everything inside Atkinson Villa.

The massive villa, over 5,000 square feet, had no housekeepers simply because Brian thought they were too noisy. The daily cleaning had always fallen to Jessica.

Now that she was leaving, she intended to step down like the perfect secretary she'd always been. It was a matter of pride—as the heiress of the Grant family.

Madeline clearly wasn't the type to do housework, so Jessica had to find a qualified housekeeper for her husband and child.

During the day, Jessica interviewed several candidates, having each of them cook according to Brian's preferences. In the evening, as she was eating at home, an urgent voice came from the front door. ""Chester, call the family doctor. Now."" It was Brian.

Jessica, being pregnant, was especially sensitive to the smell of blood, and the air immediately made her nauseous.

She frowned, an instinctive worry rising. 'What happened? Is he hurt?' she pondered.

She instinctively started toward the door, only to see Brian hurrying in, carrying a woman in his arms. It was winter in Hartdale, snow falling steadily, soaking his hair and shoulders, but he didn't seem to notice.

He laid the woman down on the couch and barked, furious, ""Where is the family doctor? Hurry up.""

Jessica didn't even need to see the woman's face to know who she was. It was Madeline.

Wrapped in her thick robe, Jessica stood to the side and calmly asked, ""What happened to her?""

They had just argued in the morning. Brian glanced at Jessica but didn't seem interested in talking to her. His voice was filled with annoyance. ""She ran into some loan sharks and took a stab to the shoulder.""

""Loan sharks? Whose debt?"" Jessica asked, curious. She thought, 'What, has the CEO of Atkinson Group gone bankrupt?'

Before Brian could respond, Madeline, pale and weak, spoke up in a pitiful voice, ""I'm sorry, Jessi. It's my fault. My dad owes gambling debts, and somehow those people found out I was Mr. Atkinson's secretary.

""They waited on a dark road tonight and tried to kidnap me. I fought back and got hurt. Luckily, Mr. Atkinson was working late and happened to be there. If he hadn't shown up and saved me, I might've been killed.""

""Don't say things like that,"" Brian said sharply. ""As long as I'm around, no one will lay a finger on you. But your place isn't safe for now. I've already called the police. Until they catch those men, you'll stay at Atkinson Villa.""

""No."" Jessica didn't hesitate at all.

Hearing that, Brian looked up at her.

Jessica seemed in good spirits. Maybe it was because she had quit her job and reconnected with her best friend. Her cheeks were rosy, her skin glowing. She wore a soft silk robe, standing there lazily, full of charm.

Brian had been irritable since morning, but hearing Jessica's flat rejection actually calmed him down.

He turned his head, sneering with what looked like mockery. He thought, 'Just like I thought. Another game of push and pull. She acts like she's indifferent, but deep down she's still jealous of Madeline.'

His tone turned low and warning. ""Jessica, this is Atkinson Villa."" He was the one who owned this place. Whoever got to stay here was up to him.

""She still can't stay,"" Jessica said firmly. ""There aren't enough rooms. She has nowhere to sleep.""

Atkinson Villa was big, spanning three full floors, but there were only three actual bedrooms.

One room was for Jacob, one for Jessica, and one for Brian. That was all there was.

There used to be extra guest rooms in Atkinson Villa, but back when Jessica and Brian were newlyweds and still happy, Brian had had them all remodeled.

There was a luxurious nursery, a walk-in closet, a display room for luxury goods, and spaces Jessica used to pass the time—like a flower room, an art studio, and a yoga room. But there were no extra bedrooms.

In fact, the third bedroom was planned by Brian for their second child in the future. But back then, they never imagined that one day they'd be sleeping apart because of emotional distance.

Brian hadn't expected Jessica to reject Madeline's stay for this reason. His face instantly darkened.

His voice was tight, like he was clenching his teeth. ""Jessica, you sleep in the master bedroom.""

The implication was clear—they could share a bed. After all, no matter how strained things had gotten, just three months ago, they had still slept together. That was how Jessica ended up pregnant.

But Jessica didn't care. That night had only happened because Brian was drunk three months ago. Back then, her feelings had been a tangled mess of love and resentment. Now, neither was left. There was no reason for them to be intimate anymore.

Jessica stood her ground, stubborn and unmoving, and the sight of it made Brian's anger boil over.

At that moment, Jacob came downstairs, still groggy from sleep. ""Dad, Mom, what's going on? I heard you two arguing again.""

He spoke with a pouty, wronged tone, then glanced over and saw Madeline on the couch, still bleeding as her wound was being treated. He snapped to attention. ""Maddie.""

Jacob ran over quickly. ""Maddie, what happened? Why are you hurt? Does it hurt? Are you okay?""

Madeline smiled, patting his head, ""It's nothing, Jake. Be good and go back to bed.""

""I'm not going. You're hurt. I'm not sleeping until you're better."" Jacob was still a clingy child, and he clung to Madeline without letting go.

Seeing how much he liked Madeline, Jessica suddenly curved her lips into a smile. ""Jake, don't worry. Maddie might be staying with us for the next few days.

""But since we don't have enough bedrooms, would it be okay if Maddie sleeps in your room with you?""

""Really?"" Jacob's eyes widened, full of excitement and joy. ""Yeah, that'd be—""

Halfway through, he quickly clamped his hand over his mouth. ""No, I didn't mean it like that, Mom.""

Jacob thought, 'I totally forgot. Mom hates it when I act like I love Maddie. The last time I stayed out playing with Maddie too long and forgot to come home, Mom got super mad.

'After that, Dad told me I shouldn't let Mom see how much I love Maddie.'

""It's okay. You can mean it,"" Jessica said quietly, her voice soft as her cold hands beneath the robe rested gently over her belly.

Today, she finally understood what it meant to give birth to an ungrateful child.

Jessica still remembered the day Jacob was born. She'd gone through a long labor for nearly two days. The doctors had said she might not survive and told Brian he had to choose whether to save the mother or the baby.

Brian's eyes had been bloodshot, screaming outside the OR that he only wanted Jessica.

But Jessica had refused. In tears, she'd begged the doctors to save the baby. She'd said she could give up everything, anything—just not the child she shared with Brian.

In the end, she'd pulled through on sheer will, giving birth to Jacob naturally without a single dose of anesthesia.

Jessica gave up her career to raise Jacob herself, day in and day out. And now, what she got in return was a child who favored another woman and wanted a different mom.

Jessica was really tired. She hadn't even wanted to keep the baby she was carrying. When she got the results from last week's checkup, her first instinct had been to give it up.

Her life felt too hopeless. She hadn't planned on having another child with Brian.

But when she thought about leaving, Jessica started to feel a glimmer of hope. She thought that maybe this time, without the Atkinson family holding her back, she and her child could grow freely and things might be better.

With that thought, Jessica stopped looking back and walked away.

Jacob didn't understand why his mom was acting this way. He stood frozen, watching her leave, silent for a long time, and then suddenly burst into tears.

He was a sensitive kid. Even if he didn't understand anything, something deep in his blood told him he was being left behind.

His sudden crying startled Madeline. She quickly hugged him and tried to comfort him, ""Jake, don't cry. I'm right here. Don't be scared.""

She looked at Brian, nervous, her eyes brimming with tears like she was silently accusing Jessica of making Jacob cry again.

Brian's face was grim. He looked up toward the second floor, his eyes brooding. But in the end, he didn't say a word.

# Chapter 5 She'd Had Enough

Jessica slept through the night without dreams. The next morning, when she came downstairs planning to make herself breakfast, she smelled food the moment she reached the stairs.

It was Madeline. She had already made breakfast for the whole family and was now grinding coffee for Brian by hand.

When she saw Jessica, she smiled and greeted her, ""Jessi, you're up. Come on, I made sandwiches. I'm not sure if you'll like them.""

""Maddie's cooking is great. Who wouldn't like it?"" Jacob chimed in with a bright smile, then sneaked a glance at Jessica. There was a flicker of fear in his expression. He was afraid of his mother, and he resented her too.

He felt like Jessica had suddenly become a different person. He didn't understand why she had looked at him with such a cold expression before.

Every time Jacob praised Maddie in the past, it would set Jessica off, making her try harder to be good to him—just so he could use that as a chance to slack off from all his tutoring sessions.

Jessica could more or less guess what her son was thinking. She let out a faint, mocking smile and thought, 'Does he really think I, his mother, can't see through a kid's little tricks?'

Jessica had indeed resented Madeline out of jealousy in the past—but only because she couldn't accept that her husband had such a close third party in his life.

As for how Madeline treated Jacob, Jessica had always turned a blind eye.

Jacob was the heir of the Atkinson family. After Jessica gave birth, Brian's mother, Paisley Atkinson, had warned her countless times not to slack off when it came to Jacob's education.

Jessica had always believed in a happy, low-pressure way of raising her child. She knew Jacob was a lively, sweet boy who loved comic books, playing games, and being in nature.

But as Brian's wife, and as the ever-watched Mrs. Atkinson in high society, she had to play the part of a strict and proper mother.

That was why Jacob always ran to his dad, complaining that his mom was too harsh.

What he didn't know was that, while Jessica was strict, she had read educational books from all over the world, doing her best to create a teaching method that balanced structure and rest.

Jessica might have seemed like a stern mother, but back when Madeline was still her intern, it was Jessica who had personally handed her a hand-drawn storybook she had made herself and asked her to use those toys to bond with Jacob.

Jacob's favorite dish—fish casserole—was something Jessica had taught Madeline how to make, step by step.

Jessica never imagined that all the care and effort she once gave would turn into a weapon against her in the end. Her expression turned cold, touched with a kind of hopeless absurdity. ""What are you wearing?""

Madeline hadn't expected Jessica's first words to be that. She looked nervous. ""I-it's a suit. I didn't have any clothes to change into last night, so I grabbed something from the closet. Jessi, what's wrong?""

Jessica thought, 'What's wrong? A woman who doesn't belong in this house is wearing my clothes, making breakfast for my kid and grinding coffee for my husband—and she's asking me what's wrong?'

Brian seemed to sense Jessica was about to cause trouble again. He frowned and spoke first, ""Jessica, it's just clothes. Don't make a scene. I gave you a black card. You can go buy a hundred more.""

Hearing that, Jessica couldn't help but let out a snort. Her stomach turned. She couldn't even tell if it was the pregnancy or the fact that she hadn't eaten breakfast. ""Brian, did you forget that this piece was...""

It was the one she wore after the first time they slept together.

Back then, Jessica had been young, fresh out of school, filled with curiosity about the world.

At a business party, she'd thought she could help the company close a billion-dollar deal. She'd drunk too much with the client, only to realize later that her drink had been spiked. She'd ended up in bed with the company's CEO by mistake.

The next morning, she'd woken up to find her clothes torn to shreds by Brian. She couldn't go to work and had sat on the bed, blushing in frustration.

Brian had found her reaction cute and had his assistant buy her that custom-tailored suit. After that, he'd reassigned her to be his personal secretary.

Jessica remembered it clearly. That was how everything started between them.

She didn't expect Brian to forget. And now he let Madeline wear the very same outfit she once wore—it was disgusting.

Brian looked at Jessica's face, seeing she was holding something back. He gave a mocking smile, his deep-set eyes flashing with something strange. ""What is it? Say it. Jessica, are you really that attached to a piece of clothing?""

1mb739s,https://www.reddit.com/r/UnsentLetters/comments/1mb739s/every_three_months/,Every three months,"Dear Her,


It’s about every three months now. At first it was every day. Then it was about once a week, usually Sunday afternoons. Then every few weeks. Now, looking at my journals, it’s about every three months that it just gets unbearable. Late September, early January, April, now July. 


I guess it makes sense. We met in April. I fell for you in July. I’m not sure about September, but of course you know why January would be tough. 


I still remember the very first time I had a dream about you. We were back at my childhood home somehow, sitting in the roof where I used to hide and smoke whatever I was smoking at the time. You were wearing a pink gingham top. You put it head on my shoulder, and you curly, sun streaked brown hair smelled of lavender. I wasn’t smoking anything though. I didn’t need to. You were my drug. 


You still are. And I haven’t had you in so long, but I’m still addicted to you. It’s like having withdrawals all over again. I can’t think, I can’t sleep or eat. My work suffers, and my workouts drag. I isolate. I sit in my room and cry. I listen to music that only makes things worse. I wallow in your absence. 


I miss you. 


I see you everyday in the corner of the kitchen or on the face of a girl I pass on the street or at the coffee shop. I’ll see you again someday. Maybe here or in another life. But someday. Somehow. You’ll always be the one I’m looking for. 

Forever,


Him

1mb72yi,https://i.redd.it/76vecdl8ojff1.png,Ranking of Date Everything Characters (After 50 Hours),"This is a \*technically\* a repost from the og Date Everything thread but since \*stuff\* happened from there, I decided to post this here so ENJOY!

\---

I did a little tier list of all of the characters in Date Everything (minus the dlc) and after 50 hours and a few reloads, I finally finished the game. These are just my personal opinions of them but I'll give a small description for each tier. 

***SOME SPOILERS FOR CHARACTERS***

**GO AWAY:**

Most of these characters either annoyed me or I just did not like them at all. Fantina was the worst as I could not get over her obsessive attitude towards me and how much she worshipped me. I liked how you can get her to stop doing that but her being “friends” with you felt forced and she just felt robotic unless you brought it up to her. She is not a character for me and so is Friar Errol. I don't like pastor-like characters to begin with and I also just did not really like his dialogue all that much. This applies to Vaughn, Rebel, and Scandalabra too as I just did not like their attitude much, they actually annoyed me, or I just did not like their design all that much. Dishy was just…odd to me and Lux is the only one I don’t actually hate all that much because he’s so much of an asshole influencer it's so good but so bad at the same time.

**Don’t Care/Indifferent:**

A lot of the fan favorite characters I’ve seen like Jerry, Harper and Dirk, Telly, and Washford and Drysdale I just did not connect with much. They had interesting stories and their voice performances were great, but nothing that made me fall in love with them. Harper and Dirk were just toxic and it was funny seeing them argue but also a bit awkward when Harper tried to get with me after leaving Dirk. Like ma’am???? ALSO, Harper was right about DIrk cheating on her cause all of sudden, he turns into Clarence and becomes obsessed with a body pillow?? This stuff was wild but not much to move the needle for me. Washford and Drysdale reestablishing their love was nice but I did not care and Telly’s rhyming scheme kinda bothered me after a while. Sorry for the fans of these characters but didn’t do much for me.

**Neat I guess:**

Most characters in this tier made me just say “That was neat”. A lot of them were not bad at all but I did not give them much thought after I was done with their route. Incredibly vocal performances specifically from Luke, Keyes, Ben-Hwa, and the fandom’s favorite Hector. Again, I didn’t hate anyone here but they were not characters that I paid attention to much after I got their ending. 

**Bestie 4 Life…or more:**  
Now THIS is where we get to the character I really liked. A lot of solid performances and stories from a lot of the objects here. The surprises for me here were actually Mitchell Linn and Timothy Timepiece as I thought they were going to be insufferable but I was wrong. Mitchell was actually really sweet and made me feel cared for. I expected him to be a bit pompous due to him being a critic but what I got was a guy who deeply cares about the experience and taste of food and wants to ensure his date enjoys it as much as he does. Timothy I actually do really like a lot too since his fixation on time I found immensely relatable. Maybe it is the neurodivergent in me but I couldn’t come to hate the catboy as much as I wanted to. But yeah, everyone here is great.

**Passionate Makeout Session:**

These are characters I would let plaster my face and body with kisses. A lot of these characters here I either appreciated for their story, vocal performance, or both. My favorites were definitely Connie, Tina, Bathesheba, Barry, and Beverly. Connie was super cool cause you had to come back every time to progress her story which reminded me of a rouge-like. Discovering her being separated from herself and regaining all of her memories made the playthroughs worth it. Tina and Bathesheba I liked cause they are absolute divas and they own that shit. Also, Bathesheba’s theme is my favorite in the game so that also helps. Beverely was also a character I really wanted to get the Love ending for but for whatever reason I didn’t. It sucks because I adore her arc and trying to increase the traction for her bar. I’m also very into mixology so she itched that fun part of the brain for me. The biggest surprise to me was Barry and his difficulty with memorizing things. I did not expect to relate to him as much as I did especially as someone who has ADHD but damn. Never judge a book by its cover or in this case, makeup products. 

**MIGHTY NEED:** I am down HORRENDOUS for all the characters in this tier. All of these folks in this tier list were lovely and each moment with them was a delight. Arma’s story surprised me because of how DARK it got and her being traumatized from seeing her previous house burn down. It was nice getting to stop her from relapsing into bad habits with smoking and I appreciated that. Curt and Rod vocal performances were fucking amazing and these guys had me twisting my hair and laughing from all of their dialogue. They have amazing chemistry with each other and I could definitely feel that in their performances. Miranda, Winnifred, and Dolly make me believe that anyone who has a southern or Spanish accent would have me on the floor with my face buried in my hands (WHY ARE THEY ALL HOT). Lady Memoria gave goth mother vibes, Nightmare made me question if I was monster fucker, and Sophia made me question how much I was into BDSM. The big two characters here that surprised me were Kopi and Shadowlord (or Skips). I didn’t know what to expect from them but man was I surprised. Kopi is an absolute sweetheart and I was glad she was able to start her own coffee place somewhere not at Roofbucks. Shadowlord was also a big sweetheart and his reveal of his true form made me love him even more. Also my headcanon is that Skips is somewhere under the trans umbrella because GOD I WANNA BE YOU MAN.

**STELLAR**:

Every single fucking time I go on Tumblr or hell, even this subreddit, these are *the* characters I look far. From their story, to their voice performance, to their music, to their fucking realization-EVERYTHING. I love everything about these characters in this tier. If these characters had their own standalone game or interpretation, I would read it in a heartbeat. All of them are taken from Mac’s funny innuendos, Mateo’s cinnamon roll nature, Betty’s comfort, Maggie’s detective cases, and Zoey’s entire story itself?!!? Two words: Absolute Cinema. Game highlights for me.

Anyways I’m going to go and save more Mac and Mateo photos to my phone. Thank you for reading.",1,1753677744.0,DateEverythingElse,0,0.67,False

I hear about all the time so I decided to give it a try to improve my health and see how it goes.I used to drink maybe 2 cups a day, 3 max

The thing is.. I can't drink plain water. I just can't. I tried, didn't work. So I decided to drink more tea. It's just water but with a flavor

After a week or so I started having trouble sleeping. I would just lie in my bed, staring at the ceiling until 5 am and then finally have a couple of hours of sleep. Sometimes I couldn't even do that. Sometimes I could feel my chest was hurting and my heart becoming crazy. I blamed it on sleep deprivation.I had no idea what the problem was. I don't drink coffee at all since 2019 because of medical issues, I never drink cola or any soda. My tea doesn't have any sugar in it. Wtf is going on 

Today, after another night without a sleep I decided to at least google what could be going on with me. Turns out 4-5 mugs (1+ liter)of tea a day is really bad for you. So yeap, tea is the problem. My insomnia began around that time when I began drinking too much tea 

My tea addiction is real and it's hurting me for real. Tea contains caffein, which is bad for me. Especially if I drink strong tea (which I like). And especially if you drink ot 3-5 hours before bed (which I do)

I know now I should cut on  tea, but I still don't know what to drink instead

1mb6wmp,https://www.reddit.com/r/soapmaking/comments/1mb6wmp/understanding_the_basics_of_handmade_soapmaking/,Understanding the Basics of Handmade Soapmaking,"We thought we should offer some advice to the community for when you are ready to start making your own soaps. Our advice is a summary from asking over 780 users of our app.

Handmade soapmaking can be a fun and rewarding hobby that lets you create custom products just for you! In this guide, we’ll explore different types of soap, such as cold process and melt-and-pour. We’ll also discuss ingredients, safety tips, and simple recipes to help you get started. Whether you’re a complete beginner or hoping to enhance your skills, this article will provide the information you need to begin your soapmaking journey!

Understanding the chemistry of soap making, particularly the function of sodium hydroxide, is important for beginners. This lye is mixed with distilled water in a heat-safe vessel, initiating the saponification process. A soap calculator helps ensure accurate measurements and batch sizes, preventing issues during the soap-making process. The choice of oils, such as palm oil or olive oil, influences the soap’s lather, hardness, and moisturizing properties.

For instance, a 3-oil soap base recipe can lead to a creamy texture, while herbal soap using lovely greens may appeal to natural soap-making enthusiasts. Safety measures include wearing gloves and goggles, working in a ventilated area, and keeping children and pets away from the kitchen sink. Tools like an immersion blender and thermometer assist in achieving the perfect light trace for the soap batter. Molds, such as a wooden loaf mold or baking pan lined with parchment paper, simplify cutting into bars once the soap sets.

Proper storage can help maintain the shelf life of the homemade soap, while experimenting with additives and fragrance oils can enhance the final product’s appeal.

Essential Supplies for Handmade Soapmaking

Lye
Lye, or sodium hydroxide, is an important ingredient in making soap, as it initiates the saponification process, turning fats and oils into soap. During this process, sodium hydroxide reacts with the oils, creating soap batter that eventually cures and becomes solid. Safety is important; when handling lye, it is necessary to wear protective gear and work in a well-ventilated area to avoid fumes.

Lye should always be mixed with distilled water in a heat-safe vessel, and it is important to follow a soap calculator to achieve accurate measurements. There are mainly two types of lye used: potassium hydroxide for liquid soaps and sodium hydroxide for solid soap bars. Beginners can start with easy soap recipes that provide guidance on small batches, such as cold process soap using simple recipes with a base of palm oil and other natural ingredients.

Cutting into bars should be done after the proper curing time, and eco-friendly soap can be enhanced with additives, like herbs and floral oils, for extra benefits. A scale, measuring cup, and thermometer ensure success in each step of the soapmaking journey.

Oils and Butters
Different types of oils and butters offer a variety of benefits to handmade soapmaking. Incorporating oils like olive, coconut, and palm oil in a 3-oil soap recipe creates a balanced lather and moisture. Each oil affects the final texture, varying in absorbency and skin feel. Coconut oil adds a bubbly lather, while olive oil enhances moisturizing properties. For certain skin types, such as dry or sensitive skin, adding emollient-rich butters like shea or cocoa can improve hydration.

When formulating cold process soap, it’s important to consider the desired properties as well as the shelf life of ingredients, using a soap calculator to ensure proper oil ratios. For herbal soap, incorporating natural ingredients like lovely greens can boost benefits. During the saponification process, accurate measuring with a scale and adjusting the water discount is important for achieving the right consistency.

Maintaining appropriate temperature while mixing sodium hydroxide in a heat-safe vessel ensures safety and efficiency in soap making. Proper ventilation during this process helps to reduce fumes. Those creating eco-friendly soap should consider using distilled water and can easily pour the soap batter into a wooden loaf mold or baking pan lined with waxed paper for easy removal later.

Additives
In handmade soapmaking, various additives enhance the properties and benefits of the final product. Exfoliants like ground coffee or oatmeal, along with botanical ingredients such as dried herbs and floral oils, enrich soap recipes. The choice of additives impacts the texture and appearance of the soap; for instance, lovely greens can add natural color and depth, while exfoliants provide a gentle scrub in the finished bars.

Precautions need to be taken when incorporating certain additives to ensure safety and effectiveness.

For example, when using sodium hydroxide in the cold process, one must carefully measure the quantities and use a soap calculator to avoid issues. It’s also important to use distilled water in a heat-safe vessel and maintain proper temperature when mixing the soap batter. Beginners may benefit from simple recipes that include larger batches and focus on a base recipe, ensuring the use of recommended molds, like a wooden loaf mold or baking pan, and protective gear in a well-ventilated area. Once the saponification process is complete, the homemade soap should be cut into bars, wrapped in waxed paper, and stored properly to maximize shelf life.

Fragrance and Colorants
When choosing fragrances for handmade soap, it’s important to keep skin sensitivities and scent longevity in mind. Beginners may prefer essential oils since they typically have softer scents and can enhance floral soap aromas. Fragrance oils offer a variety of scents but might cause sensitivities for some. A soap calculator can help determine the appropriate amount to avoid skin issues.

Various colorants, like natural clays or mica, significantly influence soap’s appearance and the texture of the batter during the saponification phase. Safety precautions are essential; working in a well-ventilated area and wearing protective gear is always advised when mixing colorants. Starting with small batches in a heat-safe vessel allows you to observe their effects without risking larger amounts.

Mixing fragrances and colorants can elevate the soap-making experience. For beautiful greens, combining a floral scent with a natural green colorant can produce an attractive look. Following straightforward recipes and maintaining a light trace when adding colorants aids in achieving even distribution in cold process soap, ensuring it is visually appealing and enjoyable to use.

Had persistent chest pain for a week or so, went to the ER and learned what a pneumothorax is. Had to quit smoking that day(monday) and would have surgery about three days after(thursday). It has officially been two weeks since I was admitted and a little over a week since my surgery.

I could explain all the reasons I miss smoking and why I felt like it was beneficial to me specifically but.. thats the addiction speaking. So here's what I'm struggling with- wtf do I do? I am healing from my surgery so I can't do busy work comfortably, can't masturbate and due to my posture I can't really draw. I feel like I can't play my favorite games because I get too excited and without my cigarette break, I'm left with a bunch of adrenaline and anxiety.

I'm a house husband so I feel like I'm going crazy here and the cravings aren't horrible but definitely getting worse. I have the patch so what I feel like I'm missing is the ritual. Wasting five minutes to an hour outside, the motions of smoking but not necessarily the cigarette itself. Drinking a butt load of coffee because its my happy drink and having a coffee on the porch is the best alternative I have in my current state.

This is mostly just a rant, I have to say something. I guess I'd be interested to hear how yall killed time while quitting?

Then I don't necessarily want to quit nicotine, it does help with my anxiety but would staying on the patch just mean perpetual cravings? Anyone who quit smoking but stayed on the patch/gum?",2,1753676994.0,stopsmoking,1,1.0,False

The morning passed in a haze, being a Saturday, I wasn’t expected to be anywhere, and I decided I was going to enjoy it to the fullest. The tile floor of the kitchen was cool on the soles of my feet as I shuffled over to the fridge. The heat of the summer sun was only just starting to warm the house, but it wasn’t quite to the point that it would overwhelm the air conditioner; however, it would be a different story by noon. As I rummaged around the fridge trying to figure out what I wanted to eat I heard footsteps approaching from behind.

“Morning” My father’s voice was raspy from sleep as he walked to the coffee maker to start a pot.

“Morning” I said while extracting the upper half of my body from the depths of my cave dive to the back of the fridge. I closed the fridge as I turned to face him seeing him put a new filter in the coffee maker.

“How’d you sleep?”  He asked the same every morning whenever we caught each other in the kitchen, our almost morning ritual while we both mentally prepared for the day.

“Pretty good. You?”

“Yeah, I woke up about two o’clock last night to the coyotes.” He scratched the growing stubble on his cheek before rubbing a hand down his face. At almost sixty now, I was starting to see the years in him, he still looked as strong as he did when I was a kid, just more tired nowadays.

“I didn’t hear ‘em.”

“Yeah, they were howling there for about an hour before they finally stopped, sounded about like ten or twelve of ‘em.”

“Yeah, I slept like a rock last night so I didn’t hear ‘em.” We were making the same comfortable idle conversation we always seemed to fall into whenever we first started our conversations.

“What time did you get to sleep last night?”

“Bout nine or ten or so.”

“Hmm, that’s kinda unusual for you, you’re usually a night owl.” He wasn’t wrong, sleeping early was unusual for me but it was just part of life, as long as it didn’t get in the way of anything that needed to be done it was just accepted at face value and we all moved on.

“Yeah, I guess I was just feeling kinda tired yesterday” I said it in a dismissive way because truthfully there was no real reason why, and I didn’t want to talk about it too much.

“Uh Oh, you’re not feeling sick with something are you?” His tone of voice didn’t change much, and neither did his body language but I could tell he really cared. Just one of the perks of knowing someone for so long.

“Naw, I was just a little tired”

“Well, I’m glad you’re not coming down with something” His words rang genuine as leaned against the counter that the coffee maker sat on. It began to hum its morning tune, signaling its work before the telltale trickle of coffee turned into a small flow.

“Me too. Did you hear about that accident at the plant the other day?” I recalled the incident that I had only recently heard about, even though I had worked there about six months prior, quitting wasn’t an easy thing as I had grown to greatly respect most of the guys I worked with and had begun to genuinely like them but when I thought about having to do that kind of work for the rest of my life it made my decision a little easier, well that and the maybe permanent nerve damage in the ends of my thumbs. Like they say, just grit your teeth and get through it.

“Yeah, I heard about that, some of those guys had to go to the hospital but I don’t think anyone got too bad hurt.” My dad still worked at the plant, but how long he’d be there was anyone’s guess as his particular kind of work had him travelling a lot, chasing the money, from one job site to the next.

“That’s good, its already rough enough in that kind of place, it’s a miracle no one got killed.”

“Yeah, you’re right about that.” We both knew how dangerous a chemical plant could be. There existed any number of hazards that one could only account for after they had been in that kind of environment for an extended period, and while leaks were few and far between, they were not unheard of. A moment of negligence is all it takes to cost you your life.

We lapsed into a comfortable silence for a bit while we both waited for the coffee to finish brewing, the smell of fresh coffee wafted through the house as the morning sun finally decided to shine its rays over the old oak trees and into our home casting the kitchen and attached dining room in a warm golden glow. Although we called it a dining room it was more like a partitioned off part of the kitchen with a table and some chairs, with no real separation from the kitchen aside from a square archway that extended about a foot out from the walls and ceiling, leaving an opening to pass through about twelve feet wide. While our home wasn’t very large, it was a decent size and a little oddly shaped on the in side but it stood through hurricane after hurricane, and flood after flood, while the centuries old oaks around us fell, so I had no doubt in my mind, while my father built it around when I was born, it would be here long after my children joined me in glory.

“How’s school going?” While my father openly supported me in my decision to pursue college, I knew his opinion on the matter well. While he would never speak ill of someone, he would make it known when he thought there was a better way and when he thought someone was making a mistake, and for the most part I was inclined to agree with him. Most of the time, that is.

“It’s going good, the semester just ended, and I finished the classes I had with a mix of high and low Bs. An eighty-one, eighty-seven, and an eighty-five.”

“Good deal, do you know when your next classes start?”

“Registration starts again in a couple of weeks if I’m not mistaken”

“Do you know what you’ll be doing?”

“I’ll have to check with my advisor to get the specifics and pick which ones I can take right now but there a handful of classes I need that are starting this semester.”

“You better make sure before it’s too late.” He said it in the same way he always did, just an advising caution. The same way that you tell someone to drive safely.

“I will” I did my best not to sound dismissive, but I didn’t enjoy speaking on this subject, especially when those around me believed I wouldn’t receive any fruits for my labor.

He turned and poured himself a cup of coffee before settling the pot back in its place. He sipped his coffee for a moment before leaning forward and starting to walk away, probably to sit under the awning he built on the back porch while he drank his coffee.

“Love you, dad” I said it after him and as much to his back as I did to him. He turned halfway, just enough to look at me before responding.

“Love you too, boy” He gave me a smile that told me he meant every word. While I doubted that he believed in the path I had chosen to follow in life, I never doubted that he loved me. My father had lived a life of hard work and labor, doing his best and eventually improving his lot in life. I respected him with my whole heart, and truthfully, I understood why he saw things the way he did. He had tried college when he was young but decided to just get to work instead, and since then he’d been working blue collar for the better part of forty-three years until he’d worked his way up to an inspector. Growing up I hadn’t thought much about what I would do for the rest of my life so when it came time to ante up, I took his suggestion and didn’t think about what else I could do. Thinking I wouldn’t be able to get a college degree, I had chosen to follow a similar path to his. After working in the industry for a little more than 6 months, I ran into several people that had a choice to do the work as well as those who didn’t. It was when I ended up on the night shift and worked with one man in particular that started my shift in perspective, nowadays I can’t remember what his name is, but I do remember what he said to me.

He told me, “If you’re working out here or anywhere you’ve got to really want it beyond just what it pays. Is your life really worth the numbers on that paystub? If you lose something out here, an arm, a leg, years of your life, is it going to be worth it? In five, ten, twenty years sure you’ll be making pretty good money but when you get there that’s all you’ll ever make, whereas if you go get an education, you’ll start closer to that number and you’ll go higher in half as much time. So, like I said if you’re going to do this there’s got to be some other reason that you’re out here, you’ve got to really want it.”

Like most things, more than anyone would believe, I remember that night clearly. That man was one of the dozen or so people that changed how I looked at things, of course once I had begun to doubt the course I was on it was only a matter of time and getting caught up in my own head again. When I had thought about where I would be in ten more years, I decided that I couldn’t do it, I wasn’t able to give my life to the craft. So, I did what I was taught to do, look for a better way and move on.

Unfortunately, what looks like a better way to one person may look like folly to another, and as such my father and I didn’t quite see eye to eye on some things but I can hardly blame him, the world he grew up in was vastly different than the one he raised me in and the world we live in now is different than even the one that I grew up in. Eventually I found a path I believed I could follow for the rest of my life and began to walk it, now I just have to see where it ends.

I poured a mug of coffee for myself, adding a little cream and sugar to it before pausing for a moment and deciding to pull out another mug for my mother when she woke up. After I set the mug next to the coffee maker I decided to head back to my room and relax some since the classes I would have been lightly stressing over ended. I headed up the stairs to the second floor and did my best to hold my slightly over full coffee steady as to not spill any on the white carpet my father had put on the stairs, and made it to my room, I closed the door and sat down on the small couch that had been given to me and began drinking my coffee. After a few minutes the silence started to get to me and I turned on my computer, content to read while I finished my coffee, unfortunately I underestimated how much time could pass while I was absorbed in a book and by the time I looked up several hours had passed and my empty mug sat forgotten next to me.

“How long was I reading?” I murmured under my breath while I looked out my window to the early afternoon light.

“I’m sure it was just eight a few minutes ago” I looked down at the internal clock on my computer which now read two-thirty in the afternoon. My eyebrows shot up and I was filled with no small amount of surprise to learn that I had been reading for six hours.

“Yep, time for a break.” I switched off my computer and stood up stretching as I did so and felt much better after multiple vertebrae in my upper back popped. I groaned in relief at the sensation of the pressure being released and headed for my door, pausing just long enough to snag my phone from where it sat on my bed. I walked to the side door, passing through the kitchen on my way out where I saw my mother pouring some tea for herself.

“Hey, mom”

“Hey, where are you going?”

“I’m just going out for a walk”

“Alright, be safe, watch for snakes”

“I will” living in the more rural part of the southern United States, telling someone to watch for snakes on a walk was probably one of the most commonly said phrases behind ‘drive safe’ and ‘be careful’ but it wasn’t for no reason, snake venom wasn’t a pleasant thing being everything from minorly paralytic to necrotic and everything in between and the snakes themselves being camouflaged well enough that you need a particularly sharp eye to spot one that isn’t out in the open. Unfortunately, I was one of those people that could smell them which as told by my father was unusual but not uncommon, the reason I say unfortunately is because snakes do not smell pleasant, like a mixture of something spoiled and pond water.

As I walked, I breathed in the fresh air and listened to the sounds of the wind rustling the trees. The sunlight wouldn’t have been unbearable but when combined with ninety-eight percent humidity it doesn’t take long to warm up. Our home sat on a few acres of land that was surrounded by trees with a few scattered oaks and ever-greens growing out in the open. The land was hilly for being ten acres but that was to be expected since much of it used to be swamp before the dirt was hauled in to make it steady for a home but on one side a section of the water from the small marsh that used to be here was blocked in to make a small pond. It was big enough to fish comfortably without crossing lines with a buddy but small enough that if you put too much power into the cast, you would clear the water all together. We lived somewhere in the middle between lost, peace, and paradise, but in recent years more people had begun moving here in search of paradise not knowing that they’d come up just short and that if they had looked a little harder, they would have found it, preferably away from here. I don’t necessarily dislike people but the more of them that are in one place the higher your chances of your day being disturbed for whatever reason caught their fancy.

I walked for a few minutes out to our mailbox and back, the round trip totaling a quarter mile, enough to stretch my legs and start sweating in the ninety-five-degree heat, but not enough to really exhaust me. As I stepped back into our house the cool air hit me as soon as I cleared the threshold feeling like ice after the short time I spent in the warm summer air. I stopped by the fridge on my way through the kitchen and grabbed a bottle of water before heading upstairs back to my room. When I got to the top of the stairs the temperature had increased by about ten degrees when compared to the first floor and sat at around eighty. Warm enough to be uncomfortable under a blanket but otherwise the perfect temperature to take a nap in, I put on some fresh clothes before laying down in my bed and pulling out my phone. I scrolled for a few minutes before deciding I wanted to read something and, sorting through my library of backlogged books, found one I decided sounded interesting enough. I hardly made it through the first three chapters before I found myself dozing off, I startled awake and decided to put my phone down and just lay back, sleep found me only a moment after I had surrendered to it.

When I opened my eyes, I was standing in a forest, the trees around me resembled the tall pines that grew in patches around my home except these were much more plentiful. Everywhere I looked the pines stretched for as far as I could see in all directions, every tree looked to be fully grown already being two to four feet in diameter and the canopy looming far enough above that to see the top of the tree I stood under I had to lean back slightly.

A light breeze cooled my skin and carried the scent of pine sap, permeating my clothing and filling my nose. The climate of this forest was much more pleasant than I was used to, being cool but not chilly, enough to justify a sleeve if you weren’t going to be doing anything physically demanding but more than warm enough to simply ignore the temperature if you wanted to wear lighter clothing.

My ears were filled with the sound of rustling leaves and creaking wood as the wind near the canopy seemed to be quite a bit stronger than the breeze I was experiencing on the ground, the sky was overcast and tinged with gray as the breeze cooled ever so slightly more. I breathed deeply through my nose and did my best to pick out the smells on the breeze and subtly, under the aroma of pine resin, I smelled the scent of a storm coming.

I looked around for any sign of where I was and where I should go but couldn’t see anything except the ancient pines that sprawled across the land. I looked to the sky trying to see where the sun was and how much light I might have, but when I looked up my vision was greeted only by ever darkening storm clouds shading the land with the promise of rain and nature’s wrath. It wouldn’t be good to stay out in the rain and potential lightning, I’d just have to pick a direction and start walking and hope I found….

*What was I looking for?*

*Why am I out here?*

*Where am I?*

The questions spun through my mind one after another several times before my confusion was interrupted by a deep rumbling that started in my feet before traveling up my body and finally into my ears and I recognized the thunder in the distance.

*I must move soon or be caught out in the rain.*

I felt a tugging sensation in my chest, pulling me towards a random direction off to my left. I had no greater options nor lesser evils to choose from so I turned and started walking, as I walked the air which had once been a comfortable temperature took on a chill to it that seemed to bite deep into my bones and spread through my blood, it felt like my blood was being filled with shards of ice as my skin started to prickle.

*I need to find shelter.*

I walked for several minutes, thunder rumbling in the distance every so often as if to make sure I hadn’t forgotten about it. The storm was still a few miles off by my count and moving slow if the thunder was any indicator, but I would be caught in my death if I let it catch up.

*How do I know that?*

I faltered for a step as the thought hit me like a freight train but kept walking, the tugging sensation in my chest had started pulling to the side ever so slightly causing my course to arc to the right gently and had started feeling more like someone had tied a rope to my ribs and was pulling me forward. I walked forward; my arms wrapped around myself to preserve what little warmth was left in me as I marched on to my unknown destination. Soon I heard a light ringing but it was unsteady, rising and falling in volume but echoing between the trees, nonetheless. I walked onward and eventually the ringing changed into what I recognized as the clanging of two pieces of metal being bashed together, and eventually an orange glow pierced the trees ahead of me.

*A camp? Perhaps they’ll shelter me for the night through the storm.*

I walked on, a small measure of vigor restored to me as I approached the warming fire that cast its glow on those around it. Soon I reached a clearing that I hadn’t realized was before me, as soon as I crossed the threshold of the trees into the clearing, I felt eyes on the back of my neck. I quickly glanced around for who was watching me, but I saw no one, only the same silent pines from whence I approached, I turned back acknowledging the feeling of being watched but set it aside for now to inspect the camp before me.

The camp was about one hundred yards wide and long with wagons and tents spread out across the space wherever there was room, to my left it seemed a makeshift blacksmith had been set up for simple repairs, a small anvil, tongs, hammer, a sack of coal, and a few loose bricks cobbled into a place for heating metal.

*Resourceful.*

The thought came unbidden and sounded flat in my own head, to my right canvas tents were lined up in rows five long and two wide, each one with its own fire and cooking pot outside and about a fifteen-foot-wide path between each row.

*About one hundred twenty tents, if it’s two to a tent possible two hundred forty obvious combatants.*

*Combatants?*

I was both confused and nervous, at the thought of fighting two hundred and forty people, and even more confused that I had immediately registered them as hostile. I shook my head slightly and walked a little further into the camp, the thought of warming up by the fire pulling me ever so slowly closer. As I got closer, I noticed some space on the far side of the camp that seemed set aside for something, I looked closer and immediately noticed horses and wagons on the left side, but these were fundamentally different than the ones I had seen when approaching. When I approached, the wagons I had seen looked like they were meant to carry a lot of equipment a very long distance, but these look more suited for transporting people, albeit uncomfortably but willingly.

I made note of a horse that was tied a short distance away from the others.

*Close, but still isolated.*

As I looked right, I noticed right away a large opulent tent made of some unknown material that had been dyed a mix of reds, purples, and blues. There was a gap between it and the canvas tents of about thirty feet with five black and purple tents in the center of that space forming a short divider between them.

*Must be the commander and his guards.*

I continued walking forward and crossed the final short distance to the campfire, as soon as I was within reach of its warmth, I could feel it spreading through me, wrapping around my frozen bones and thawing them out, melting the shards of ice in my blood. The warmth of the fire wrapped around me like an embrace, and I sagged a little with relief, as I regained feeling in my fingers and toes, someone nearby finally noticed my presence and was visibly shaken by it.

I turned my eyes to regard him but made no other movement than that, the man in question who appeared to be a soldier or mercenary of some kind must have been possessed of a mental sickness or heavily inebriated, as when I turned my gaze upon him, he turned and fled like wolves nipped at his heels.

*It seems I shall find no shelter here.*

I turned my gaze to the sky above and saw the storm clouds had turned a shade of midnight black that implied that the coming storm would seek to wash away our presence, yet a drop of rain had yet to fall. The clanking of metal on metal, and the thump of approaching boots were the only warning I had before I was surrounded by this small army, if an army it could be called. I turned my eyes from the heavens above back to the world around me and raked my gaze over the gathered men as the fire still warmed me. They each reacted differently to my attention, some would flinch, others would grip their swords tighter in preparation for a fight, others still seemed confused why they had gathered the entirety of the camp for one man. I was inclined to agree with those that were confused.

Soon the soldiers near the back of the group began parting as others approached, as they grew closer, I began discerning more details about them. Three knights wearing black and purple armor and two women dressed in fine clothes, gold, and jewels. The women led the group and the foremost of the two wore a crown that seemed a mix of gold, silver, diamonds, and rubies the crown had a rolled white fur edge where it made contact with her brown hair, the crown had nine arrowhead shaped points on it with the nineth being front and center above her forehead with by far the largest diamond I’ve ever seen embedded in the center being an oval shape that was two and a half inches tall and an inch wide and masterfully cut with the finest attention to detail.

I let my gaze drift down to her face, she had deep chocolate brown hair that fell down in ringlets and framed her heart shaped face, her warm brown eyes studied me much the same as I did her.

*She is familiar, somehow.*

The thought sat in the back of my head and sifted through my memories while I continued to examine the woman before me. She held herself with confidence, much the same as someone who trusted in the capabilities of themselves and those around them. She had the pale, soft looking skin of someone who didn’t spend much time in the sun, her figure was healthy like someone who ate well but had the discipline not to be gluttonous. She had soft eyes and high cheek bones; her jaw was on the sharp side but not overly so and led into full pink lips.

*Why is she so familiar?*

The thought began to gnaw at the back of my mind. I looked at her closer now, she was just slightly taller than me, so I didn’t notice at first, but after my eyes passed over it a few times I saw it.

“Bow the ruler of the realm, queen of Enelstra.” One of the black knights which I now realized were the royal guard spoke in a deep baritone voice. I flicked my eyes over to him for a moment and back just as quickly.

*There! On her cheek bone.*

“You dare disregard a direct order from the royal guard boy?” Another of the guards spoke this time with no small measure of indignation in his voice, he sounded younger than the one that had spoken before. I didn’t even spare him a glance as I squinted my eyes slightly and tilted my head a little to better see the queen’s cheek. Seeming to read my mind she turned her head down just enough to see it properly while the corners of her lips quirked up in the smallest of smiles.

*There! A scar!*

Recognition flooded through me as the memory of my last dream was dragged to the forefront of my mind and the gnawing in the back of my mind changed into relief and then tied everything in my head together with a nice bow on top as I remembered exactly why she was familiar and who she was.

“His eyes!” The younger of the guards drew his sword and my priorities immediately changed as I looked at him.

“Again!” the third and final royal guard chose to speak up at last, her voice also sounding on the younger side but no less eager than her male counterpart to fight as she also drew her sword.

The two younger guards charged forward while the third stayed by the queen’s side and called after them to stop, but it was too late, the young man had already committed to the attack even if he wanted to stop, he wouldn’t have been able to prevent the blows from doing some form of damage.

*Good, let them come.*

*Why? Fighting them will only ensure they won’t give us shelter?*

*Us? Who is us?*

Before my internal monologue could go any farther, I reacted to the armored man, bending my knees and leaning forward slipping under his slash and sliding into his guard, I stood to full height abruptly, knocking him off balance while he was still extended out in his attack. This left me standing to his right while my arm looped under his arm and grabbed at the metal that covered his collarbone before wrapping my leg behind his and ripping it out from under him allowing me to slam him into the ground hard. When he hit the dirt the metal of his armor shrieked in some places and crunched in others, but he did not move an inch other than that of his chest rising and falling with his unconscious breathing.

The young woman hesitated for only a moment when her colleague hit the dirt but soon was lunging for my neck as well.

*She’s overextended much like the boy, sloppy.*

She made to stab me through the throat while mid stride, I quickly batted the flat of her blade with my right hand to knock it off course allowing it to slide harmlessly over my left shoulder, then using her momentum against her I stepped forward to meet her halfway and add more power to my own strike as I drove my right elbow into the chain Maille between her breast plate and helmet landing it directly on her throat. The move knocked her off her feet and made me stumble for a moment as all of the inertia of a heavier opponent was transferred to me. As she hit the ground the air was well and truly driven from her lungs, she rolled over onto her side and clutched her throat barely managing to breathe but still getting some airflow.

I turned back to the final guard and prepared for his attack, but it never came as the world warped around me, everything suddenly gained a honey gold and rose red tinge and seemed to be melting around me into darkness. My balance left me and I began stumbling, swaying this way and that trying to regain my footing before I felt a stabilizing hand on my arm, I looked to see who had grabbed me but the world was too twisted for me to see properly, the only thing I could see were warm brown eyes, a small scar on one cheek, a crown, and a devious smile, like that of a trickster. I tried to pull away, but my strength had all but left me as well. Her smile softened at my attempt before she pulled me gently towards her, unable to regain my balance I might as well have been thrown at her as I stumbled but she looped her arms under my shoulders and supported me for a moment before she leaned down and whispered into my ear.

“Come find me next time, yes? Maybe you can answer some of my questions and I can answer yours over tea, yes?” Her tone was light and teasing as she was clearly amused, but I also heard a tinge of something darker that I couldn’t quite place, but I was sure, regardless of her tone and how she worded it, she was not asking.

“Wwwwhhhhhoooo…….” As a final bit of salt in the wound my words failed me as the color drained from the world around me and I began to feel weightless, my head swam, and everything began shrinking around me and she began easing me down to the ground.

“Don’t worry about that for now sweetie, just worry about what, and all you need to know is what I am is your ally. Alright?” Her tone was soft and seemed to dig into my brain.

“Now this may sting a bit but its for your own good. I hope you can forgive me for what I’m about to do.” Her words were soft and sweet like honey while also alarming as the world narrowed down to a small coin before me, I could see a glint of silver and an electric blue glow before the nerves in my left arm lit up and felt like I had just stuck my arm up to my elbow into a woodchipper. I couldn’t hear myself if I cried out but the last thing I heard and saw before it all went black was her voice reassuring me the pain was over and it wouldn’t happen again, and a small flow of blood running down my left hand.

For context, we met up a year ago over coffee. After telling me the meeting was platonic, my ex kissed me and told me he was confused. We were intimate, and then he told me the sex meant nothing. He ghosted me shortly after.

The breakup happened suddenly without any warning during my battle with a severe illness. He never revealed his feelings about our split.

I know it's over, but all I wanted was an acknowledgement that the relationship meant something to him. I expressed this to him the minute we broke up but he went total radio silent on me. I don't know how he felt or how he feels about what happened. But we'd known each other since we were teenagers. 

The breakup just felt... unusually cold. Lacking in the emotional consideration you'd show a person you were with for 6 years and lived with for two. We had even talked about marriage at some point.

I know life moves on but it feels like he pretends that I never existed or meant anything to him. I would have preferred if he had been honest about how he felt rather than leaving me in the dark.

Also, there's nuances here, it's not a black and white situation. The breakup was complex, with both parties loving each other, but the trauma of a severe illness was so large that it cracked the armour of our bond together. 

He's not a bad person for his choices and neither am I. But I do really wish he just told me how he felt at the time. I wouldn't have seen it as a weakness, I would have seen it as strength.

Mia Turner stood frozen at the entrance to the living room, her fingers clutching the strap of her work bag. Her sister Lily had interrupted her while she was getting ready, insisting their mother had something important to discuss. 

“Mia, sit down,” her mother, Mary Turner, ordered, lounging on the worn-out sofa like a queen holding court. Her bright red lipstick clashed with the faded blush on her face, her manicured nails tapping against her wine glass.

“Can’t this wait? I have work,” Mia replied, her voice tight. “I can’t afford to be late again.”

Her mother raised an eyebrow. “Work? You mean playing servant to those rich snobs at Casa Lounge? Please.”

Mia bit her tongue. She knew better than to rise to the bait. She needed this job. Casa Lounge wasn’t just a paycheck; it was her lifeline, the first step in her plan to save enough money to leave Willowcrest and the stigma of being a Turner behind.

Ethan, her older brother, sat slouched in the corner, scrolling through his phone. His indifference to the chaos of their family was almost admirable. At least he stayed out of the endless bickering.

“What’s this about, Mom?” Mia asked, her patience slipping.

Mary’s lips curled into a smile. “We have good news.”

Mia blinked, skeptical. “Good news?”

“Yes!” Lily, the eldest, jumped in, practically glowing with excitement. “I got a golden invite to the Willowcrest Unicorn Party!”

Mia blinked again, slower this time, trying to process how this was supposed to be good news. The Unicorn Party—the most exclusive, over-the-top event for the rich and powerful—was as far removed from her world as the moon.

“And this is good news… how?” Mia asked, genuinely baffled.

“Attending will be nice though,” Ethan muttered without looking up from his phone.

“Nice?!” Lily’s voice rose an octave. “Do you have any idea what this means? The richest bachelors in the world will be there! This is it!”

“And how did your name end up on the list?” Mia asked, her tone sharper than she intended.

“Connections,” Mary said smugly, swirling her wine.

Mia didn’t want to dig deeper into what kind of “connections” her mother was referring to. She knew the answer wouldn’t be pleasant.

“Okay, so Lily’s going to some fancy party. What does that have to do with me?” Mia asked, checking the time on her phone. She really couldn’t afford to be late.

Mary leaned forward, her voice dropping into a conspiratorial tone. “This is our chance, Mia. Lily just needs to catch the eye of the right man. A billionaire. Someone who can change all our lives.”

Mia resisted the urge to roll her eyes. Of course, it was another one of her mother’s schemes. Everything in Mary Turner’s life revolved around chasing rich men, and her daughters were no exception.

“I’m happy for Lily,” Mia said flatly, rising to leave. “Congratulations and good luck with the party. I have to go.”

“Sit down, Mia,” Mary snapped, her tone sharpening.

“I can’t be late—”

“Sit!”

Reluctantly, Mia dropped back onto the couch, glancing at the clock on the wall. She was already cutting it too close.

“Listen, you all know how much we suffer and lose after that old bastard put me in Jail. This is a one time opportunity that will change our lives forever”

“ How does that even concern me? Or did the whole family get invited?”

“You wish…” Lily said with snort. “ No one is inviting you to that kind of party with that face”

Ethan chuckles, pulling eyes to him

“Lily you have to stop pretending, like Mia isn't the prettiest in this family” Ethan said, eyes still fixed on his phone.

“Eww, don't say it like that you're my brother” Mia smiles, always trying to get under his brother's skin

“Did I mention she is the most stupid?”

“I try”

“Enough both of you” Mary scolds

“I seriously need to get to work mom, whatever this is obviously doesn't concern me”

“Always so proud talking about it, like it's a real job?” Anna, the middle sister, said with a snide laugh.

“At least I’m doing something!” Mia snapped.

Before the argument could escalate further, Mary’s phone buzzed. She checked the screen, a sly smile spreading across her face. “Same time, same place, Barry? I’ll be there,” she said into the phone, her voice dripping with seduction.

Mia felt a wave of disgust wash over her. She didn’t need to guess what the call was about. It was her mother’s usual business—entertaining some wealthy man in exchange for cash, gifts, or favors.

As Mary hung up, she turned her attention back to Mia. “The point is, we all need to contribute to get your sister everything she needs for that party. You included.”

“This is ridiculous mom! Count me out,” Mia said, her voice steely.

Mary’s eyes narrowed. “Don’t be selfish, Mia. This is for the family.”

“I don't have have money”

“Yes you do” Anna rushed to say. “You've been saving a lot of money for college.”

“Like you said college”

“This is more than college and I've told you a thousand times you're a Turner you have no business with College” Mary says, checking her phone.

“ And I have said it a million times, I'm not like you! I don't want to be like you, I don't want to sit around and wait for some rich guy to come change my life”

“So you think you're better than us now?”

“Oh my god! I'm leaving. Lily I'm sure you can sort yourself out, and if you do get your billionaire boyfriend or husband remember not to give me a dime from his money”

Mia grabs her bag and heads for the door.

College in another country is her way out, no one is jeopardizing that for her.

There's nothing she wants than to leave this town, remove the curse name she bears from her existence.

“Oh you're a Turner, never mind”

“You're a Turner you have no say”

“Girl you're a Turner”

“You're Turner Shut up and open your legs”

“Not a Turner trying to form modesty”

# Chosen For The Game

Alexander Blackwell was known for many things in Willowcrest: his wealth, his looks, his reputation as the bad boy every story tried to capture, but never quite could. Patience, however, wasn’t on the list. Yet, for Zoe Harrington—his girlfriend—he tried. Tried being the word.

Casa Lounge was his usual spot in the evenings, the perfect escape before his underground matches. Tonight, though, he wasn’t supposed to be here. He had a fight in less than two hours, but it was Zoe’s birthday. And Zoe got what Zoe wanted—most of the time.

He sat back in his booth, swirling his glass of whiskey lazily as he watched Zoe talking to a new face in Willowcrest, her glittery dress hugging her like a second skin. She was shamelessly rubbing her body on him—Dickson, or whatever his name was. A new face in Willowcrest, clearly is unaware of who Alexander was.

The sight didn’t bother him; nothing Zoe did ever truly got under his skin. Their relationship thrived on chaos. He smirked, watching her antics, amused more than anything else. She was testing him, as always.

When Zoe finally realized her games weren’t ruffling his feathers, she walks over to him, her pout on full display.

“You don’t even get jealous anymore,” she whined, plopping down beside him.

Alexander looked up from his glass, his voice calm and cool. “What do you want me to do, break some poor guy’s nose?”

Her pout deepened. “When did you even start caring about people?”

“I don’t.”

“Exactly my point!” She crossed her arms, glaring. “You’re so… boring now.”

Alexander hummed in response, his attention flicking toward the crowd again. But then his gaze caught on someone. A Turner.

There she was laughing with her coworker at the bar. Her smile lit up her otherwise simple features, her uniform crisp and modest.The sight of her irritates him.

He did consider asking his friend that owns the place to fire her when they first employed her.

“Man, why would you employ a Turner?”

“She's pretty”

“Still a Turner”

“Won't be one when her pretty lips are wrapped around my dick”

“Seriously?”

“Come on I want to have a taste of all of them”

He blinks back to reality, jaw tensed. He knew all about the Turners. Everyone in Willowcrest did. A family that had no business staying in this town.

“I feel like our spark is dying.”

Alexander sighed, half-listening as he took another sip of his drink. “You say that every day, babe.”

“I mean it this time. I think we need… more games.”

He raised a brow, setting his glass down. “Games? Zoe, we did threesomes the entire month of October. What’s left?”

She leaned forward, pressing her lips against his, her tone dropping to a playful whisper. “I want us to go extreme this time.”

He tilted his head, watching her with mild amusement. “You’re insane.”

“We both are.” She smiled sweetly, her eyes glinting with mischief.

He sighed, leaning back. “What’s your big idea this time?”

“We break up for a month,” she began, her smile widening. “We each date someone new. You sleep with them, I sleep with mine.”

Alexander stared at her, incredulous. “You’ve officially lost it.”

“Oh, come on! It’ll be fun,” Zoe pressed. “It’s not like we don’t always find our way back to each other.”

“And what’s the benefit of this game? Or is this just your twisted idea of fun?”

“To spice up our relationship!” she said as though it were obvious. “And—” she added with a wink—“you’ll be saying no to my birthday present if you don’t agree.”

“Thought you wanted a shopping spree in Paris?” he drawled.

She waved it off. “Changed my mind.”

Alexander sighed, rubbing his temple. “Fine.”

Zoe practically squealed, climbing into his lap to kiss him. “Thank you, baby!”

“I’m already regretting this,” he muttered against her lips.

“Okay, okay, let’s pick!” Zoe said, bouncing excitedly. Her eyes darted around the lounge. “Not her. Not her. Oh—her!”

Alexander followed her gaze, his glass pausing mid-air. His eyes landed on Mia Turner, and he nearly choked on his drink.

“A Turner?” he asked in disbelief.

Zoe nodded enthusiastically. “Yup. I heard she’s different from her sisters. Lucas even tried to get with her, and she turned him down. Can you imagine? She might actually give you a challenge.”

Alexander shook his head firmly. “I’m not getting anywhere near a Turner, Zoe.”

“But she’s pretty,” Zoe argued.

“She’s still a Turner.”

“Alex, please?”

“No Zoe I’m not putting my dick into a Turner “

Zoe pouted, turning her attention to her nails. “Fine. If you’re not going to play, fine. But I guess my birthday’s ruined.”

Alexander groaned. As twisted as their relationship was, he loved Zoe. They’d grown up together, transitioning from childhood friends to lovers. And while she drove him insane, he couldn’t imagine life without her.

“Fine,” he finally relented.

Zoe lit up, throwing her arms around his neck. “Yes! Thank you, baby! Okay, now your turn. Pick someone for me.”

Alexander leaned back, scanning the room. His eyes landed on Jeremy—a local businessman and soon-to-be groom. A wicked smirk curved his lips. “Him.”

Zoe frowned. “Jeremy? Isn’t he getting married next month?”

“Even better,” Alexander replied smoothly. “Like you said, the game is sweeter if it’s harder to achieve.”

Zoe grinned. “You’re twisted, Alex.”

“I’m a Blackwell babes ?”

# The Proposal

Mia was exhausted. Her legs ached from standing for hours, her head throbbed from the endless stream of demanding customers, and her soul felt drained from another day of pretending to be unbothered. 

Casa Lounge had been bustling tonight, and all she wanted now was to catch the next bus home, crawl into bed, and pray that her mother and siblings were out of the house. She couldn’t deal with them today—not with their drama, their judgment, and their constant reminder of the name she desperately wanted to escape.  

She stood at the bus stop, clutching her bag tightly, watching as headlights passed by, one after the other. The night air was cool, the breeze teasing strands of her hair.

Her thoughts were interrupted by the purr of an engine. Mia looked up, startled, as a sleek black sports car slowed to a stop in front of her. Its headlights bathed her in blinding light. She squinted, taking a step back, ready to bolt if necessary. Nothing good ever came out of expensive cars stopping for people like her.  

The door opened, and out stepped Alexander Blackwell.  

Mia’s breath caught in her throat.  

He wasn’t just handsome; he was devastatingly handsome. Towering with broad shoulders, a face carved like a Greek god, and an aura of confidence that demanded attention, Alexander Blackwell was every bit the enigma he is said to be. His presence was overwhelming, the kind of presence that knocked the air out of your lungs before you even realized it.  

He leaned casually against his car, his gaze fixed on her like he had all the time in the world.  

""Hey,"" he said, his voice smooth and laced with an edge of arrogance.  

Mia blinked, unsure if her brain was playing tricks on her. She glanced behind her, twice, certain there must be someone else he was addressing. Surely, ‘a Blackwell’ couldn’t be talking to her.  

""I’m talking to you, Turner,"" he said, smirking.  

Her mind went blank. All she could do was stammer. ""W-what? Me?""  

""Yup.""  

Mia clutched her bag tighter. She looked at him like he’d just announced the sky was green. ""Why… why are you talking to me?""  

His smirk deepened, and then, without warning, he said, ""Go on a date with me.""  

Mia froze. The words hit her like a thunderclap. Did she hear him right? She blinked rapidly, waiting for the punchline, but his face remained serious, even amused.  

""What?"" she choked out. ""Y-you have a girlfriend.""  

Alexander shrugged, pushing his hands into his pockets. ""Not anymore. We broke up. Check the news, Turner.""  

The casual way he said it made her feel like she’d stepped into some alternate reality. Her mind struggled to catch up.  

""I don’t understand,"" she said, her voice shaky.  

""How much?""  

Mia blinked again. ""What?""  

""I said, how much to go on dates with me?""  

It took her a second to process his words. Her jaw dropped as realization hit her. ""You… you want to pay me to go on dates with you?""  

""Maybe,"" he said, his tone nonchalant, as if he were discussing the weather.  

""Why?"" she demanded, her voice rising in confusion. “ You don’t even know my name!""  

""I know enough, Turner."" 

God! she hates when she's being address like this

Mia felt anger under her exhaustion. Her hands balled into fists at her sides. ""No,"" she said firmly.  

Alexander raised a brow. ""What?""  

""I said no.""  

He tilted his head, genuinely surprised. ""Why?""  

Mia stared at him, incredulous. ""What do you mean, why? You don’t even know me. You’ve never talked to me before. And now you suddenly want to—what?—buy me for dates? When I just saw you yesterday with your girlfriend""  

""Don’t tell me you were watching me, Turner,"" he said, his smirk returning.  

""You wish,"" she snapped.  

""Trust me, that can’t be part of my wishes,"" he said coolly. His eyes glinted with amusement. ""Name your price, Turner.""  

""I said no!"" she spat, her voice firm. ""You can’t just buy people to go on dates with you. I’m not interested.""  

Alexander’s smirk faltered for a split second. He stepped closer, his presence overwhelming, as he stared down at her. ""You’re a Turner,"" he said, his tone dropping. ""Stop acting like you have any pride""  

Her chest tightened, anger bubbling inside her. ""Please, leave me alone,"" she said through gritted teeth.  

He stepped back, his smirk returning like a mask. ""Three dates, Five thousand, for each.""  

Mia’s eyes widened. ""What?""  

""You heard me. Sleep over it, Turner.""  

And just like that, he turned, got into his car, and drove off, leaving her standing there, speechless, her thoughts swirling into chaos.  

“What the hell?”

# The Tempting Offer

Mia barely got any sleep that night. She tossed and turned, replaying the surreal encounter with Alexander Blackwell over and over in her mind. The way he’d looked at her, the arrogance in his tone, the absurdity of his offer—5,000 per date? It felt like a cruel joke, one meant to humiliate her.  

But then the thought of the money would creep back in, unbidden. 5 thousand dollars. For three dates, that will be 15 thousand dollars. It was more money than she could hope to save in years at Casa Lounge. 

15 thousand could pay for a lot, rent, food... It could be her fastest way out of Willowcrest. 

Mia sat up in bed and groaned, running her hands through her hair. No. She shouldn't even entertain the thoughts. 

Whatever game Alexander Blackwell was playing, she wanted no part of it. That money might save her now, but taking money from a Blackwell will definitely come with strings she wasn’t willing to pull. 

By morning, she was still exhausted but determined to stick to her decision. She trudged out of her tiny room and into the kitchen, hoping for some coffee to start her day. As she entered, she heard her sisters talking, their voices low. 

“There's no way it’s real,” Lily was saying, her tone dripping with skepticism.  

“It could be,” Anna shot back, flipping her hair over her shoulder. “People are saying it all over town.”  

“What’s going on?” Mia asked groggily, heading to the cupboard to grab a glass. “Where’s Mom?”  

“Out. Probably won’t be back until God knows when,” Anna replied, not even sparing her a glance.  

“You’re delusional if you think they’ve broken up,” Lily said, laughing. “Zoe would rather chew glass than break up with Blackwell.”  

Mia froze, her hand clutching the glass tightly.  

“Or maybe he broke up with her,” Anna said with a sly smile.  

Lily snorted. “Oh my God, Anna, don’t tell me you’re still holding onto the hope that you’ll get him one day. It’s embarrassing at this point.”  

Mia turned slowly, her stomach sinking as she listened to the exchange.  

“I’m not delusional!” Anna snapped. “And you’re one to talk. At least I tried. Unlike you, who’s too busy chasing any rich guy who gives you a second glance.”  

“‘Tried’ is an understatement,” Lily said, cackling. “Walking around naked in the Blackwell mansion three days after you were employed? Please. That was pathetic.”  

Anna’s face flushed, and she opened her mouth to retort, but Lily kept going.  

“Face it, Anna. We’re Turners. The Blackwells doesn’t even look at us like we’re human. They hate our family’s existence.”  

“Whatever,” Anna huffed, crossing her arms.  

Mia forced herself to move, walking to the sink to pour herself some water. Her hands were shaking, and she prayed neither of them would notice. 

HmmOnce inside, she grabbed her phone from the nightstand and immediately opened the Willowcrest Morning News. There, staring back at her in bold letters, was the headline:  

\*\*Alexander Blackwell and Zoe Harrington Call It Quits.\*\*  

Mia’s heart raced as she read the article. Zoe had confirmed the breakup in an interview the night before, saying they’d decided to take a “break” to focus on themselves. The tone of the article was suspicious, though, hinting at drama behind the scenes.  

Mia put the phone down and leaned against the wall, her mind spinning. Was this why he’d approached her? Because he was single now and needed someone to… what? Fill the void? Become part of his ridiculous games?  

She shook her head.

She couldn’t let herself get sucked into whatever madness was going on.  

Just then, her phone buzzed in her hand. The notification made her stomach drop. She hesitated for a moment before looking at the screen.  

The message was from an unknown number.  

Good morning, Turner. Don’t bother asking how I got your number. My offer still stands: three dates, 5,000 for each one. You have three days to decide.  

Mia stared at the message, her heart pounding in her chest. Her fingers trembled as she read it again. She could practically hear his voice in the text, that cool, arrogant tone that told her he was used to getting exactly what he wanted.  

For a moment, she considered deleting the message, pretending it never existed. But instead, she sank onto the edge of her bed, clutching her phone tightly.  

Fifteen thousand dollars.  

Her mind raced with possibilities. She could finally afford to leave Willowcrest, start fresh. 

But then the image of Alexander Blackwell’s smirk flashed in her mind, and anger bubbled to the surface.  

Three days

# The Blackwells

The Blackwell mansion loomed like a dark, silent predator as Alex walks up the marble steps and pushed through the heavy doors. 

The house was grand—but it felt nothing like a home. 

Dinner here wasn’t about family bonding; it was a calculated performance, one Alex hated but endured because his mother and brother were involved. The only two people who ground him to this dysfunctional circus. Well… them, and Zoe.  

He walked into the dining room, his steps echoing against the polished floors. His family was already seated, the tension visible before a single word was spoken.  

“What’s this nonsense I hear about you and Zoe?” his father, Charles Blackwell, demanded without so much as looking up. His tone was sharp and cold, like a blade slicing through the air.  

Alex didn’t falter, didn’t blink. He slid into his seat with a practiced ease, his face carefully neutral. “Good evening, Father,” he replied smoothly, ignoring the obvious jab.  

“Did you ice that cut, darling?” His mother, Esther, leaned forward, her soft features tight with concern. Her gaze flicked to the small wound on his temple from his most recent underground fight.  

Alex waved her off. “It’s fine, Mother.”  

“I can’t believe you let a rookie do that to you,” Charles sneered, his voice filled with disdain.  

“I won, Father,” Alex said, his voice edged with amusement. “That’s what matters, isn’t it?”  

Charles’s lips curled into a snarl. “You think this is a joke? I told you to postpone your fights for the week. Investors are flying in tomorrow, and you’re moving around, looking like some street thug. Do you realize the stakes? We could lose millions!”  

Alex leaned back in his chair, completely unfazed. “And yet I made sweet money last night from fighting. Your priorities are not mine, Father.”  

Charles’s gaze darkened. Without warning, he grabbed Julian’s wrist and slammed it onto the table.  

Alex stiffened.  

Julian, his older brother, winced, his lips trembling as he fought to suppress any sound of pain. Alex’s stomach twisted as he watched the familiar scene unfold.  

Charles Blackwell wasn’t a father. He was a tyrant, a monster! A manipulator who thrived on power and control, and when Alex pushed his limits, it was always Julian or his mother who bore the brunt of his wrath.  

“Do you think this is a game, Alexander?” Charles hissed, pressing harder on Julian’s hand.  

Julian’s eyes were shut tight, his breath uneven, but he didn’t cry out. He never did. 

Once, Julian had been Alex’s hero—the older brother who could do no wrong. Now he was a shadow of that man, a hollowed-out shell who survived on drugs.’  

Alex’s jaw clenched, rage boiling beneath the surface. His mother’s wide, pleading eyes locked on him, silently begging him to do something.  

Alex forced himself to keep his tone calm. “I’ll handle the investors,” he said, his words precise and deliberate. “It won’t affect the meeting. You’ll get the contract.”  

Charles finally let go of Julian’s hand, leaning back in his chair with a satisfied smirk. “Good. That’s what I like to hear.”  

Julian pulled his hand back quickly, cradling it under the table. His face was pale, but he didn’t say a word.  

Alex wanted to slam his fist through the table, but he didn’t. That’s what Charles wanted—to provoke him, to control him.  

Instead, Alex picked up his phone and scrolled aimlessly, pretending to care about the plate of food in front of him.  

“Fix whatever mess you’ve made with Zoe,” Charles added, his tone icy. “Her father and I are already discussing the wedding date. I won’t have your antics ruining our alliance.”  

Alex smirked, though it didn’t reach his eyes. “Of course, Father,” he said, not looking up. He couldn’t exactly tell Charles the truth” 

His mind drift to that server girl 

Turner—the fiery server girl who’d told him off at the bus stop. He hated to admit it, but her rejection had stung. Most people in Willowcrest would’ve jumped at his offer, yet she’d turned him down without a second thought.  

Something about her had gotten under his skin.  

“Did you hear me, Alexander?” Charles barked, snapping him out of his thoughts.  

Alex slipped his phone into his pocket and stood abruptly. “Loud and clear, Father. Enjoy your dinner, Blackwells.”  

Without another word, he strode out of the dining room.  

The cold night air hit him like a slap as he stepped outside. He leaned against his sleek car, running a hand through his hair. He needed to cool off.  

His phone buzzed in his pocket.  

Pulling it out, he glanced at the screen, his heart drops. It was a text message, and it was from Turner.  

‘I’ll do it.’

Alex stared at the message, his heart thudding in his chest. For a moment, he didn’t move, didn’t breathe.  

He loves challenges but getting entangled with a Turner is a challenge he had no interest in taking part in.

He wished she had said no.

# Let The Game Begin

The balcony of the Blackwell Grand Hotel overlooked a city alive with wealth, secrets, and power plays. Alex stood with a glass of wine in hand, the chilled night air brushing against his skin. Beside him, Zoe leaned in, her arms draped around his waist as if she were staking a claim.  

""How long do you plan on playing this game?"" He asked.

Zoe chuckled softly, her lips brushing against his ear. ""It's getting very interesting, Alexander. Don’t ruin the fun.""  

He hummed, neither agreeing nor disagreeing, his eyes fixed on the horizon. His thoughts drifted to the server girl.

""I can’t believe she agreed so quickly,"" Zoe said, breaking into his thoughts.  

""I told you, she's a Turner,"" Alex replied, his tone dismissive.  

Zoe tilted her head, her blonde hair cascading over her shoulder as she studied him. ""Seriously, babe, bribing her with money should be considered cheating. Where’s the challenge in that?""  

Alex turned his head slightly, giving her a sharp glance. ""No rules against it, Zoe. And what did you expect? That I’d sweet-talk her into a date? Casual conversation with her is painful enough. I offered what Turners are slaves to—the one thing they respond to."" His lips curled into a smirk. ""And like the perfect bait, she took it.""  

Zoe shivered, but not from the cold. Her smile widened, her eyes glittering with mischief. ""God, babe, your hatred for them gives me chills. I mean, I get it. You should hate them, but... it’s not like the whole family wronged you. Her brother was the only one who got involved with Julian.""  

Alex’s expression hardened, his sharp jawline tightening. His voice was cold and deliberate. ""And what is her brother, Zoe?""  

""A Turner,"" she whispered with a wicked smile, clearly pleased with his reaction. ""But babe, I have to admit—watching you squirm every time you talk about her makes this game so much more entertaining. Your pain and discomfort? Pure gold.""  

Alex didn’t respond. He drained the rest of his wine and turned his gaze back to the city, his thoughts darker than the night sky.  

—

Mia stood behind the bar at Casa Lounge, wiping down glasses and trying to ignore the twisting in her stomach. It had been two days since she’d last seen Alexander Blackwell, and she wasn’t sure if the relief or disappointment was stronger.

His message still lingered in her mind, taunting her.

Three dates. Five thousand per date.

It wasn’t normal. Nothing about it was normal. What kind of man paid that much money for a date? Who even pays for a date?

She paused mid-wipe, her reflection in the glass catching her attention. She didn’t need this kind of chaos in her life.

The door to Casa Lounge swung open. Mia turned her head and froze.

Alexander Blackwell

He wasn’t alone. His two friends, Lucas and Sam, flanked him, laughing at something she couldn’t hear. But Alex’s gaze was locked on her the moment he entered the bar.

Mia felt her heart lurch in her chest, and her hands gripped the counter to keep herself steady. She couldn’t move. She couldn’t look away. He was walking toward her, his dark, commanding presence drawing the eyes of everyone in the lounge.

Her throat went dry as he closed the distance between them.

“Tomorrow after work,” Alex said, his voice low and smooth. “I’ll pick you up.”

That was it. No explanation, no pleasantries. Just a statement delivered with absolute confidence.

Before Mia could find her voice, he turned and walked to the back corner of the lounge, where his friends were already settling into a booth.

Mia exhaled sharply, her grip on the counter tightening. Her knees felt like jelly, and she was sure her face was flushed.

“What was that about?” Emily, her coworker, whispered from behind her, nudging her with an elbow.

“Nothing,” Mia said quickly, her voice shaky.

Emily raised an eyebrow. “Nothing? That was Alexander Blackwell. He doesn’t just walk up to people, Mia.”

“Drop it,” Mia muttered, focusing on the glass in her hand. But her heart was pounding so hard it felt like it might leap out of her chest.

She glanced over at the booth where Alex sat with his friends. He didn’t look her way again, laughing at something his friend had said, but she couldn’t shake the feeling that he was completely aware of her every move.",1,1753676721.0,Novelnews,0,1.0,False

After sharing a progress photo last week (cheers for the kind messages btw), I had a few DMs asking if I followed a specific plan. 

Truth is, I didn’t follow anything strict. But what did make the difference were lots of micro changes, most of which I barely noticed, but when stacked together over weeks and months, made an impact. 

None of these are revolutionary. Some are obvious. But I figured I’d share the ones that stuck together with a rough calculation of the impact. 

Micro wins. Massive gains (or rather, losses).
