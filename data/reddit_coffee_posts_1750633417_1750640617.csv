- Booked prior to RPM being named Canada’s Best Restaurant by Canada’s 100 Best so it was a lot easier to reserve.
    - It seems like resos have become more difficult as all available dates are sold out now.
- Solo reservations aren’t available via Tock. I emailed the restaurant and they were able to book me in for any of the time slots that were available on Tock.
- Tasting menu was $205/pp. $95 was pre-paid at the time of reservation, remainder was paid after dinner.
    - Also did the $94 garden drink pairing (non-alcoholic)
    - Garden tour is ~ $40 which I wasn’t able to do due to scheduling conflicts but I think it’d be a fun thing to do before the dining experience to get to know the ingredients that’ll be used that night!
- As it’s also a winery, you’re able to purchase wine bottles at the restaurant or the bottle shop that’s on the property.
    - They told me at the bottle shop that they have the same inventory at the restaurant & the shop, but when I got the purchasable list at the restaurant it seems like the inventory is a bit different. 

Notes on the restaurant:
- It is located in a more remote area with limited public transit access. Will likely need to drive or uber to the restaurant.
    - Was a 30 min uber ride from my hotel in Niagara Falls (~$45/50 one-way)
- Blind tasting
    - Menu provided afterwards (main ingredient of the courses on the front, more detailed ingredient list of each course on the back)
- Lighting was great when I was there for a 17:30 reso in the summer.
- Clean bathroom
    - 3-ply toilet paper & hand towels provided
- Not very accessible if you have mobility issues - 3 flights of stairs & no elevator.

Notes on the food:
- All of the ingredients are sourced within Canada and they don’t use anything that doesn’t grow here (e.g., lemon, chocolate, etc.)
    - Some people may find it restrictive, but I really enjoyed how they worked around not being able to source certain ingredients and how it highlights Canadian ingredients.
- Enjoyed every dish except the last one. Carrot crisp, Dungeness crab, Duck, and Pork were the stand-outs for me
    - I wish I could have a bag full of their carrot crisps, it was very addicting.
    - The surprising standout in the crab dish were the peas. It was cooked perfectly and I loved the crisp, but tender texture they provided. The hay & alder custard was also delicious 
    - The duck gave peking duck vibes which I thoroughly enjoyed
    - The mushroom & lobster stuffed morel was unbelievable in the pork dish. I really enjoyed the dish so I asked if I could have another one and the kitchen happily brought out another plate (at no charge!). The chef said he can “keep it coming,” which almost tempted me to ask again for a 3rd one.
    - The last dessert, “ice cream sandwich”, was suuuuuper cold so it was very surprising. 
- Really enjoyed the non-alcoholic garden pairing. Really enjoyed seeing the juices/teas that RPM paired as it felt different than other NA programs where it tries to mimic the drink pairings without the alcohol content (e.g., faux red wine, mock champagne, etc.).

Notes on service:
- They didn’t offer coffee or tea at the end which I found a bit odd, especially after I saw them offer it to the table in front of me.
    - I was too full at this point anyways but it would’ve been nice to have the option in case I wasn’t
- Had 2 somms throughout the service. 1 of them kept putting the bottle down in a way the label was turned away which was a bit frustrating.
- Service was really friendly - didn’t feel too stuffy.
- Once again I have to mention how much I appreciate them for accommodating my request of having the pork dish again - at no charge no less. I would’ve been perfectly happy paying extra for it and to see it have no charge made it even better.

TL;DR - Fantastic restaurant that highlights Canadian ingredients. Definitely worth a trip if you’re in the area!

1li3kbu,https://www.reddit.com/r/Beermkr/comments/1li3kbu/brewing_with_brewstore_and_grocery_store/,Brewing with Brew-Store and Grocery Store ingredients,"This is an example of how I brew without kits or special ingredient on the standard BeerMKR.  These are the same techniques I use on my BeermkrAfterlife brewery except for the recipe entry method.

I will also show some of the tools, many of which are optional, that I use when brewing this way.

# Recipe

In the first post I showed the recipe that I was emulating and showed a scaled for the BeerMKR version of it.

[https://www.reddit.com/r/Beermkr/comments/1lekpf4/boulevard\_rye\_on\_rye\_clone\_brewing\_with\_diy/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Beermkr/comments/1lekpf4/boulevard_rye_on_rye_clone_brewing_with_diy/)

Now we'll start to turn those ingredients into a brew session.

# Preparation

Brewing with the BeerMKR is pretty easy, but DIY still takes some preparation work.

Let's start with the grains.

# Grains

I have a grain mill so I buy my grain un-crushed.  It keeps very well that way so I will buy 2-5 pounds at a time from the brew store and I get several brews out of a purchase unless it is one of the base malts. On those I sometimes buy in larger (10 lb) quantities if I know what my brewing queue looks like.

I use a kitchen scale for the grains that has the ability to read in grams and the ability to ""tare"" to remove the weight of a container.  I use grams for two reasons: First it's the unit of the spreadsheet and I don't have to convert. Second it is a smaller measure so it's easier to get a finer reading with grams than with ounces or tenths of an ounce.

Most brew stores have the ability to crush the grain for you right when you buy it.  I don't know if they have the ability to do gram level measurements, though.

[Weighing out Rye Malt](https://preview.redd.it/nsbr1vmnjk8f1.jpg?width=3024&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=1ed5301801116d652f0ccb12d1e64a03de2d35b2)

[All the grains weighed out](https://preview.redd.it/nm4vblirjk8f1.jpg?width=4032&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=7de67ba8ef5cf1dd5cc36e048266e43446e6e6aa)

Usually I just weigh out each grain and put them together in one container as I measure.  They are all going into the crusher together anyway.   Putting them out individually is just for show.

https://preview.redd.it/lcmekkkyjk8f1.jpg?width=3024&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=b2e1da4598c0d98ea8b1900e78c748e71bac9e3d

A grain crusher has turned out to be a much more used tool than I anticipated.  The BeerMKR makes smaller batches and this lets me have the flexibility to brew what I want when I want.  Or... with what I have more than a few times.  I've made some pretty good beer out of leftovers.

# Water 1

I have a water softener, but for brewing I don't use softened water.  The minerals that are removed are beneficial to the yeast and the sodium that replaces it isn't great for beer.   On the other hand I'm lazy so I'm not doing any special water chemistry.

The total water for this batch is 7000ml so I'm pulling the first pitcher of 3500ml off of a tap where I can bypass the water softener.  When I use water later I pull it from this pitcher so that I have a measured amount.  I will explain more later.

# Hops

This is the place where the uniqueness of the BeerMKR really requires adaptation.  The BeerMKR does not boil.  Before the website went down there was a comparison about what the boil in traditional brewing accomplished and how that was managed in the BeerMKR environment.  One of the things the boil does is to re-arrange some of the acids on hops (isomerize) to make them bitter.  60 minutes at a boiling temperature will pretty much re-arrange all of the Alpha acids on the hops (and boil off the other acids).

I call this method of brewing ""No Boil Brewing"".

Figuring out how to handle times less than 60 but greater than zero is probably the biggest unknown for us,  I've seen all kinds of labels for this like ""Flavor Hops"" or ""Aroma Hops"", but what's happening to the hops when they are thrown in boiling wort for a short time?  I've taken to modelling the hops as a percentage of 60 minute boil.  So a 6 gram addition at 20 minutes to go in the boil equates to 2 grams of bitter 60 minute hops and 4 grams of un-boiled hops.

BeerMKR used to have an Instagram video of them making their steam hops.  They had a gadget that produced saturated steam (and in Boulder that's 202F) and they put leaf hops in the basket and cooked them for the stated time and then pulled them out.  I guess they turned those into pellets for us later.

What we can do with our standard brew store pellets is to steam them in an Instant Pot.  The Instant Pot is a pressure cooker, when means that it achieves a higher temperature.  The isomerization rate for hops depends on temperature more than anything else (that's why adding hops after you stop boiling doesn't add as much bitterness).

First I measure out my hops using a gram scale. This small scale is really handy since we frequently use amounts for hops that are way below the detection threshold for my kitchen scale.

[Measuring 2.25 grams of Citra](https://preview.redd.it/7pypibgfkk8f1.jpg?width=3024&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=515a2692651be9ecb6e35fa629e34cdd36e510d2)

Cupcake cups are handy containers at this point because they are light (you still have to tare the scale) as well as being cheap and disposable.

For this batch I'm only going to steam the Citra Hops.  The recipe call for both Magnum and Citra.  I have already steamed an entire ounce of Magnum.  I use it so frequently that I can just weigh out the pre-bittered hops and I don't have to get the Instant Pot out for it.

[All three hops measured.  Note the difference in texture of the pre-steamed Magnum hops on the left.](https://preview.redd.it/ebmwyufkkk8f1.jpg?width=3024&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=5f7ca6dec62b41694eb27442e45c923c301244ca)

To use and Instant Pot to steam hops you need a container that's safe in the cooker to put the hops in (a small stainless bowl or a ceramic ramakin) and you need something to keep the hops out of the water that goes in the bottom of the cooker.  I have a silicone ""roast"" holder that has a little more than an inch under it.  You can also use one of those fancy fold up steamers but do keep the hops out of the water.

[Preparing to steam Citra Hops](https://preview.redd.it/rb2wdl9zkk8f1.jpg?width=3024&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=2aae3288c1fb918e5abf6d4d09f79c381ceb67ea)

I steam the hops for 15 minutes - the default manual cycle.  The cycle is longer than that.  That means that it heats up until it gets to pressure (that's what the water in the bottom is for - to make steam) and then it starts the timer.  Then just leave it.  As the pot cools down the pressure will go down and eventually release the rest of the pressure.  Things are still hot so be careful.

It's interesting to note how the steaming changes the character of the hops.  Unsteamed pellets when added to hot water tend to turn to a green sludge.  These pellets retain their shape.  I particularly like that when directly pitching the hops into the BeerMKR because it doesn't make a mess.  For this batch we aren't going to put hops directly in the BeerMKR.

When I've brewed this in the past I used both the Ahtanum and Styrian Goldings hops.  That's 40 grams of hop pellets which is a lot of green in my beer.  This batch I'm only doing the Styrian Goldings.  I don't really want to bitter any of them, but I do want to transfer all of the oils out of the pellets and into my beer.

I pull about 400ml of water from my pre-measured water pitcher and put it in an empty teakettle.  I heat this water to boiling and then put it in a pyrex measuring cup.  The amount of water and the measure cup sizes aren't particularly critical.  I put the measured 2.25g of Magnum, the 2.25g of Citra and the 20g of Styian Goldings hops in a re-useable coffee filter.  I like the coffee filter (not ever used for coffee by the way) because it is a finer screen. I dunk the hops into the hot water and swirl a bit and then just let it cool down.  This becomes ""Hop Tea"" brewing water.

I've made hop tea before by laboriously boiling the hops on the stove.  It's pretty much all of the work of regular brewing.  I used a ""hop spider"" but there was still a lot of green in my brewing water.  That's an alternate method if you don't have an instant pot to bitter the hops.  You could also heat the water in a microwave if you didn't have the teakettle.

In the case of this brew I had a little accident when I opened the steamer.  I caught the lid on the side of the pot and spilled some of my newly steamed hops into the water that provided the steam.  I was already making hop tea in the wrong water!  What I ended up doing was pouring the water and hops through my strainer into my measuring cup.  So much for my careful water measurement.  I supplemented this with additional hot brewing water from the kettle and let the hops steep.

[Strainer basket with hop tea in the measuring cup.](https://preview.redd.it/lnuix82olk8f1.jpg?width=3024&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=e75633596572ecff7cf2cd8b04f0488b3c675de0)

It may seem like having hot water is also an ideal time to dissolve some of the sugar adds.  This is by no means wrong, especially if you adhere to the theory that the hop oils work better when they can bind to sugar.  The key to dissolving sugar in the brewing water is to measure the water first.  Adding sugar will inflate the volume of water in a measuring cup.  If you measure after adding sugar instead of before you won't have as much water in the system as you think you do.

# Sugar Adds

I tried something this time that after doing it I won't recommend.  My first BeerMKR kit was the Tripel where they had you add rock candy to the waste bag. This makes some sense because any of the sugar that makes its way up to the grain basket is going to get thrown away with the grain.  This recipe has a bunch of sugar added so I tried stuffing brown sugar in the waste bag.  I didn't find out until time for yeast pitch, but some of that sugar just turned into a solid block.  I didn't notice it when I pumped the hot bag the night before.

The regular way to add sugar this way is to measure it out like the grain.  I started with the D90 Candy syrup weighing it into a Pyrex measuring cup.

[Candy syrup measured out. The TARE function on the scale handy to remove the weight of the measuring cup.](https://preview.redd.it/m3t7dlswmk8f1.jpg?width=3024&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=a7e41cb79050e8dcda74f57d66ddc3d13498ef70)

I added the remainder of my pre-measured brown sugar to this and added hot water from the teakettle that had been pulled from my pre-measured brewing water.  It wasn't until the next day that I missed getting out the Dry Malt Extract that should have been added here.

The mixture went into the brew tub first (so all of the way to the waste bag).  The idea was to keep the added sugar mostly out of the brew basket until after the grain was removed.

There was a little sugar crystal left in the bottom of the cup.  This was then the cup I used to make the hop tea so this is slightly out of order.

# Water Add 1

I took heated water from the teakettle and added it back to my measured water pitcher.  I had never noticed in the kit instructions where it talked about adding heated water to the system.  It does move it along a little faster.  Previously I had always used tap temperature water.

# Grain Crushing

While the hop tea was steeping I ran the pre-measured grains through the crusher.  There's not much to this but it is essential.  

[Grinding the Grain](https://preview.redd.it/frd4hg98ok8f1.jpg?width=3024&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=7250cd1db0514d756e07781b8faed3cec684828f)

The grain is then added to the brew basket.  The difference between this and a kit is that there aren't multiple packages.

[Grain into the brew basket.   From here on it's normal BeerMKR brewing](https://preview.redd.it/ligygpfgok8f1.jpg?width=3024&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=34786de6bfc7515654d51ba91f586e56c7961ad0)

# Water 2

The second water add was pulled from the unsoftened bypass and measured to match the spreadsheet.  Except in my case I estimated a subtraction for the steam water that ended up in my hops.  This is all standard BeerMKR brewing.  I did heat the water in the microwave up to about 120F.

At this point the machine was started like normal.

# Special situations

I was able to check my machine as it started because of some previous work I've done.  I have a tap on the computer board that lets me log the serial output and see the progress.  Most brewers will not have this. I also have the back of my machine open where I can clamp an ammeter over the wires to see if current is flowing.

The machine this brew is being done on is a second-hand ""Stock"" model. It's also an older model with some slight differences from my other machine.  The big thing I was looking for was to ensure that the top heaters came on.  I really don't know of an easy way to make sure those come on short of putting some kind of temperature probe on those plates unless you can measure the current.

On mine the log said that after 300 seconds and the current below 6.25 amps that the heater came on.  I didn't have to do anything and it worked normally.  Other users and on my other machine I had to disconnect the Peltier briefly (just a couple of seconds) to fool the computer into turning on the heater.

Mashing

I put a BBQ thermometer probe in the grain basket while this was going on. I was really worried for a while about how far behind the brew bag the grain basket was.  In the end the grain basket was what I consider an ideal 152F.  This was 45 minutes after the machine switched to cooling for pitch.

I like to drain down the brew basket right away so it cools better. I removed the grain and took a gravity measure with my optical refractometer.  The brew basket gravity was 1.073.  Then I got out the oven gloves and pumped the waste bag a dozen times or so.  This helped mix the sugar that was down low throughout the system.  When I measured a second time the gravity was up to 1.082.  That's still a long way from the 1.111 the spreadsheet was predicting.  Partly that's the DME that I forgot.  I do wonder if the spreadsheet is accounting for sugar that gets thrown away with the grain.  Maybe on another time I will hold back some liquid and try ""sparging"".

I left the door open over night and when I woke up it was ready to pitch.

This recipe used Scottish Ale Yeast (this one is using Wyeast 1728).  The yeast I added this morning came from a starter.  I've also brewed this recipe with dry yeast using Fermentis US-04.   I also added ALDC this morning as well as the gluten and haze drops.



# Tools

[Handy tools](https://preview.redd.it/tubkhjr5qk8f1.jpg?width=3024&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=77450cbd8e3622a52475b569e450e41bdc4f87e0)

Sometimes we might take for granted the tools that help kits be packaged until we have to do that ourselves.  We've already shown weighing and crushing grain.

The bottling wand and connector come at the end of the brewing cycle, but I've never looked back after printing the BeerNPPL (search BeerNPPL on reddit,  I didn't create it).  It's the reason I bought a 3D printer.

The gram scale (sub gram, really) is pretty necessary for measuring out small amounts of hops.  This scale can actually measure 2.25 grams of hops.

The refractometer is used to see how much sugar you got in your wort.  When you hear or see the term OG (Original Gravity).  This is the sample taken at the beginning - usually about the time of yeast pitch.  As the yeasties work the gravity of the wort is reduced as the yeast eat the sugar.  Actually it's reduced for another reason using an optical device.  Alcohol has a different refraction index than water.  It will make your gravity when you are done appear artificially high.  Calculators on sites like [brewersfriend.com](http://brewersfriend.com) can help work through those calculations and help you determine the ABV you got on your brew.

The vacuum pump is a little handheld device that I use a lot more than I thought.  Coupled with special Foodsaver zipper bags I can take the air out of my open bags of hops for storing in the refrigerator.  I tried one of these with DME and it was a mess, though.  The DME was so light it went right into the valve and then it wouldn't seal.  DME now in a glass jar...

By the time I got done writing that night, I was too tired to care that my wife, Symone, wasn’t home. I figured she’d gone for a walk or something.

When I woke up in the morning and saw that she wasn’t in bed, my first thought was that she’d gotten up before me and went to the store. It wasn’t until the evening that I realized she’d left me a voicemail in the middle of the night.

It was a short message, less than ten seconds. But when I think about it now I think that most of the worst things that ever happen to you happen in ten seconds or less. Probably most of the good things too. Ten seconds is enough time for a lot to happen.

I know it took me less than ten seconds to fall in love when I saw Symone for the first time. Sitting by herself in the corner of the coffee shop I worked at, reading of all things. Beautiful jet black hair, a soft face, and round glasses.

Like any straight college aged guy, it was normal for me to give some glances to pretty girls that walked in while I was working. But normally that’s all it was, a quick glance then back to work. I never thought that I would be so unprofessional as to flirt with a customer, but for the first and only time in my three years working at the coffee shop, I walked over to this beautiful girl and introduced myself.

We hit it off immediately. We talked about books, our hatred for annoying old people (we both worked in customer service), and found out that we were going to the same college, were both English majors, and we even had some of the same professors.

Months later, she told me that the moment she realized she was going to give me “at least one date” was when I told her how lucky I felt to have a professor as knowledgeable and passionate as Dr. Ridge.

You see, Dr. Ridge was perhaps the most made-fun-of professor in the history of education. During the first day in every one of her classes, Dr. Ridge would show a short PowerPoint presentation over her 17 bunnies, each with names like Dante, Raven, and Beowulf. That wasn’t the embarrassing part—the embarrassing part was that she had a FaceBook made for each one of her bunnies, and they all interacted with each other. Some of them were married and would post about their relationship struggles, only to argue online; some of them were dealing with injuries or illnesses and posted poems about their pain.

As you can guess, this did not go over well in freshman level classes. However, to hear Symone tell it, the fact that I looked past Dr. Ridge’s quirks to see how intelligent and kind she was, proved that I was worth a shot.

Fast forward to the day of our two year anniversary. I’m starting my last semester of college and Symone is only a few months behind me. We were at the nicest restaurant I could afford, talking about our future together for the thousandth time: we planned to get married shortly after she graduated and then move somewhere far away from either of our families. I was going to teach high school English while working on my novels, and she was going to pursue her PhD and eventually become a literature professor.

We finished dinner in high spirits and decided to go for a walk around the city. The ground was covered in snow and ice and the street lights reflected off the ground; the way that Symone lit up made her look like an angel. She was the center of the world.

We went through a local bookstore. My best friend Tommy was the clerk and gave me an employee discount on the book of Robert Frost poems I bought for Symone. When we were checking out, an old woman in line told us that we were about the cutest couple she’d ever seen.

“You look just like my husband and I did,” she said, then looked at me directly. “Don’t ever let her go.”

“I won’t,” I promised.

Drunk in love, we meandered through the city until we wound up at the underground subway station. In twenty minutes there was a train going to a place in the city we’d never been through before, so we decided, screw it. We’d go check it out for no other reason other than to say that we’d experienced all the city had to offer.

We spent our downtime sitting on a bench and playing sticks with our fingers (if you don’t know how to play, Google it). Symone was always a much quicker thinker than me. She was better at chess, Sudoku, crossword puzzles, anything that took brain power. She had just beaten me for the fifth game in a row when I noticed the group of guys on the other side of the tracks.

They were huddled together, but when I looked up they all had their heads turned, staring directly at us. They noticed me and turned back to each other. I figured they were just some funny guys making jokes about us sitting all lovey dovey on the bench. Maybe they were checking Symone out.

Either way, they were on the other side of the tracks. They were the furthest thing from a threat at the time. That’s why I felt fine excusing myself to the bathroom a few minutes later.

As I was washing my hands, I heard a scream and instantly recognized it as Symone’s voice. I sprinted out and found her circled by all three men. The tallest one held Symone in a headlock so tight that he was lifting her off the ground. The other two were looking around for witnesses.

When they saw me they barreled toward me. Symone let out a muffled cry.

For a second time slowed. I remember thinking to myself how incredible of a situation this was. Surely this would all just stop somehow, right? This type of thing didn’t just happen.

But it was happening, and the two men were only a few feet away from me. I had no chance in a fight. Even if it was just one of them, they were nearly twice my size. The one thing that I thought I might have over them, was speed.

Like a wide receiver juking a defender, I feigned as if I was going to run away. Instead, I cut back and ran towards the gap between the leftmost man and the tracks, narrowly escaping a five-foot fall to the bottom. He reached for me, but I lowered my shoulder and barreled through his outstretched arm. I cut to the right and slammed into Symone and her assailant at full speed, bringing all three of us crashing to the ground.

I ended up on top of the tall man and elbowed him in the ribs. As I rolled away, I heard a loud thud and a shriek. One of the other men had tried to grab Symone, but had instead pushed her into the tracks about six feet below us.

I tried to stand, but then the man grabbed me by the ankle and pulled me so that I fell on my stomach and cracked my jaw so hard that I saw stars.

I kicked my feet blindly and connected with his stomach. I got free and halfway to my feet before I was grabbed and put into a headlock.

The grip was so tight I was scared my throat was going to collapse. I flailed about and clawed at hands I couldn’t see, but as deep as my nails went, the grip never loosened—until we heard the horn.

The train was coming.

Symone’s on the tracks.

I was thrown to the ground and a heavy boot stomped on my back and knocked the wind out of me. “Let’s get the fuck out of here,” one of them yelled. By the time I could stand they were running away.

Symone frantically clawed at the wall, trying to get up out of the trench, but she was a short girl, barely five feet tall. Although she could reach up to the platform above her, the edge was curved, making it too difficult for her to get a firm hold.

I reached my arms down and tried to pull her up myself, but I just didn’t have the strength. Maybe if we had a little more time we could have worked together, but the train sounded so close. It was going to burst through the tunnel any second.

Once we saw the train, there wouldn’t be enough time to react. There wasn’t enough room down there for her to escape its girth.

I allowed myself half a second to close my eyes and think and think and think. I pictured the train bursting through the tunnel and Symone screaming my name, standing against the edge of the tracks as it ran into and through her. I thought about the sound of her bones being crushed, about never seeing her again, about spending the rest of my life without her.

I could try again to grab her, but the result would simply be the same: her getting crushed while we held hands.

There was no getting her up in time. There was only one scenario where I saw her surviving:

“Go to the middle of the tracks and lay down,” I said.

Without hesitation, she let go of my hands, ran to the tracks, and laid down flat on her stomach with her arms firm against her sides.

Just then, the train emerged from the tunnel. Her right arm was resting exactly where the wheels of the train would run.

“A little left!” I screamed.

She squirmed a half inch to the left just as she disappeared underneath the train.

She screamed so loudly that I could hear her over the rumbling. She screamed and screamed until the train came to a complete stop. For a long second I heard nothing except for the train doors opening and passengers holding their conversations that strung together like a bad choir.

“Symone!” I screamed

I flagged down the operator, and he kept the train stationary until Symone was able to squeeze out. Together, we lifted her up to safety.

I called the police and told them what happened, but none of the men were ever caught. I found that to be irrelevant. Symone was safe.

For the next week, she stayed with me at my apartment. She cried in her sleep almost every night, but eventually she felt close to normal—only, much less likely to take a late night subway train.

A couple weeks later, we were lying in bed and I was the one crying.

“I was so scared you were going to die,” I said. “I couldn’t stand to live without you, and I know that it was my fault. I should never have left you alone.”

She kissed a tear running down my cheek and hugged me close. “But you knew just what to do. You saved me.”

“I didn’t know what to do. I just said the first thing I thought of. I had no idea if the train was going to crush you or not, I just knew I couldn’t get you out in time. I had to try something.”

“Well, it worked.”

“Why were you so confident in me?” I asked. “How come when I told you to lay down, you just did it?”

“You’re my boyfriend,” she said. “You’re always there when I need you; you always do the right thing. I knew you wouldn’t let anything happen to me.”

Years later, we had a beautiful wedding at the very same church Symone was baptized in as a baby. I sobbed as she walked down the aisle; we both sobbed as we said our vows; by the time we kissed, our faces were so wet that they slid against each other like two blubbery fish.

We honeymooned in Greece where we climbed the Acropolis. We held hands as we watched the sunset. I promised  myself that, no matter what, Symone would be the important thing in my life. We were both on the precipice, about to free fall into the things we’d been dreaming about since we were young, and yet, I knew that whether I sold a million books or zero, I was going to love Symone more than anything. She would always be my priority.

Symone got accepted into one of the top English Literature PhD programs in the country, so we ended up moving to an even bigger city. She focused on her classes and worked as a waitress on the weekends. I found a teaching job at a local high school and spent my evenings working on my novels.

It was about a year into this new life when I began to find success. It started small. A publisher picked up my first book, a horror novel, and we were able to get it published in a short time with minimal edits.

A couple dozen people picked up the book, and I got some solid reviews. Every week a few more sales would roll in, and after some months it looked like I might even break even. Then some girl on TikTok made a video with a title like, “The most disturbing book of 2025.” She gave a quick, spoiler free summary of my book with lots of gasps and comments like “you won’t believe what happens next.” At the end she said that she didn’t sleep with the lights off for a week after finishing the story.

The video ended up going viral. Tens of millions of views and over a million likes. Other book content creators started making summaries and reviews, some people even posted live reactions of them reading the ending. People were speculating on whether or not the killer was actually dead. Would there be a sequel?

Suddenly the book was selling so fast that the small book printer my publishers outsourced to couldn’t keep up. They had to hire a secondary team, and then a third, all just to print more and more copies.

Edgy teenagers weren’t exactly my target audience, but I’d be lying if I said I wasn’t in absolute bliss. I went to bookstores and saw entire displays with copies of my book. I started doing book signings and talks. I spoke on a panel with an author who’s a household name.

Even when the publicity started to die down, the book was selling at a steady rate. That’s when my publisher gave me a deadline: 45 days to finish the sequel that I hadn’t even planned on writing.

My school understood when I quit with only a week's notice. This was a once in a lifetime opportunity, and I had to strike while the iron was hot. Over the next month and a half I did nothing except work on my book.

I’d be lying if I said I didn’t notice Symone feeling down around this time. We barely talked anymore, sex was nonexistent. She tried to get me out of my office for a date at least once a week, but I was always just so busy. I kept telling her that as soon as I finished the book I’d spend all the time in the world with her. I remember being so frustrated that she just didn’t get it.

She got even more upset when I started drinking at night. Not a lot, but when you write and think for 12 hours straight every single day, sometimes you just need something to help you relax. I yelled at her more than once during this time.

I kept telling myself that I would start treating her better soon. But then a sequel turned into a threequel, and then I started a new series. There really never was a good chance for a break. I had this momentum you see, and readers are fickle. There was always the chance that as soon as I took a breather they were going to move on to something else.

Symone started struggling to keep up with her coursework, and every time she tried to vent to me about it I told her that if it was too much for her she should just quit.

I’m not quite sure when she did drop out, but it’s safe to say I didn’t notice for a few weeks. She just laid in bed and wouldn’t even try to talk to me anymore.

One night I forced myself to stop writing a little early. I really did feel bad for her. I knew I was being neglectful. It just seemed that there was always something more urgent. And I knew she’d always be around once it wrapped up.

That night I booked a vacation scheduled for the next month—our anniversary. We’d go to Hawaii and stay in a nice resort. “I won’t do any writing for a whole week,” I promised. “It’ll be just the two of us.”

When I told her she just nodded, and I could tell she didn’t believe me. But I meant it, I really did. It’s just that, as we got closer to the vacation, I realized I was behind on my next book. We’d have more time if we could just postpone it by a couple of weeks.

That would have worked just fine. Except for the fact that, the very day of our anniversary, she got run over by a subway train.

I didn’t listen to the voicemail until after the police called me to tell me she was dead. I was writing when they called.

They said that she had laid down on the subway tracks. Flat on her back, with her arms flat against her side. Witnesses said that it was almost like she was trying to hide under the train—to avoid being run over.

She almost did, too. If she was just one more inch to the left, she would have been fine.

The first thing I did when I got off the phone was listen to her voicemail.

“I’m going to the subway station. The one closest to our house. I hope you’ll meet me there. Somehow, despite everything, I know you will. I love you.”

All I can think about now is her lying there, confident that I was going to do something to save her. Did she believe that I was going to make it just in time?

Did she die believing, like she did when we were young, [that I would never let anything happen to her?](http://connorisaacwriting.com)",1,1750640082.0,CreepCast_Submissions,0,1.0,False

Before I got pregnant, we had a good relationship and I liked her. We even met up for lunch/coffee a couple times without my husband and she’d call me occasionally. Whenever I saw her in person we got along great. Or so I thought.

Once I got pregnant, I could feel a shift in her energy, but I thought maybe I was just overthinking it. However, things only got worse. At every event, she started insulting me and became more and more passive aggressive. She only made these comments when nobody was around though. She had a way of making passive aggressive comments in front of my husband that flew over his head. I started to notice a lot of narcissistic traits. Things really took a turn when she became very entitled, expecting to attend my obgyn appointments with me and demanded to be in the delivery room. I put my foot down with my husband who stood up to her, but things never returned to normal after. Since the baby arrived, she’s gone unhinged. I could go on with examples, but the main issue is I don’t feel she respects me as a mother and she seems to view my baby as a “do over” for her and doesn’t see me as the mom. She even called herself mama once. When my husband told his family my son looks at me with so much love and admiration as his mom, she quickly said he looks at everyone that way. She constantly dismisses me. I don’t trust her to watch my son without me around. 

My husband finally confronted her. She of course played the victim and her only excuse was that she had texted me a couple times during pregnancy and I took a few hours to answer, so she never checked in again and said that I’ve “changed” since being pregnant. She tried to say that I’m the issue and have cut her off, but had zero accountability..

My FIL is great and one of my SIL is too. But my other SIL is definitely my MILs flying monkey and I’ve started having issues with her too. I’m looking for advice on how to navigate this when I hate his mom and dislike his sister, but have no issues with the rest of the family. I would love to go NC with her but don’t know if that’s possible. Also wondering if anyone knows why MILS tend to go crazy once their DIL becomes pregnant. ",2,1750639763.0,JUSTNOMIL,2,1.0,False

Dear \[Agent\],

Some fish decided to grow legs millions of years ago and now Mina’s still feeling sorry for objects at twenty-eight. Once lauded as gifted in her youth, her adulthood has been a blur of monotonous part-time jobs, unrealised dreams of moving abroad, and planning small talk about the weather in advance. As she spends week after week baking peace offerings for her company and holding her dysfunctional family together—since moving out has done little to liberate her from her narcissistic, seemingly bipolar mother—Mina wonders if human relationships are supposed to be this exhausting.

When an upcoming project at work demands social skills she doesn’t have, Mina is urged to join an improvisation class at the behest of her flatmate and meets Ren, a body piercing apprentice who shares her predisposition to pathological empathy and oddly specific routines. For the first time in her twenties, Mina feels no need to practise facial expressions in the mirror, to consciously curate her presence in public—a cause for celebration if not for her many questions now arising from their blossoming friendship. All too quickly, Mina must confront the escalating suspicion that she may have been wrong about herself all along—and about her mother, from whom it all began.

Complete at 84,000 words, PEOPLE LIKE PEOPLE is an upmarket novel exploring the complicated mother-daughter relationship as seen in Jessica George's *Maame* through the lens of an unconventional, queer female protagonist, reminiscent of Emily Austin’s *Interesting Facts About Space*.

First 300:

I need the runniest, messiest, most unreliable mascara there is on the market.

As soon as the seconds tick into half past four—not a second earlier, not a second later—I gather my keys and heave my backpack over one shoulder. After six years of regular use, it’s my only option; the zip now bursts open on one side at the touch of anything remotely heavy, and today, there are four cobs of corn in it. Malissa’s gaze sears the side of my head.

‘You’re really not coming tonight?’ she says. ‘Not even for happy hour?’

‘I wish!’ I draw out the syllable with a subtle pout to demonstrate profound disappointment at the prospect of forgoing mediocre drinks and greasy finger food with people I’m no longer paid to interact with as of thirty seconds ago. ‘I’d love to come, but I promised my flatmate I’d go watch her musical tonight.’

‘Again? Well, good on you for being so supportive!’

She laughs. I laugh along because that’s what you’re supposed to do. I hope I look like I’m having a good time.

I make sure to smile and wave at everyone individually on my way out.

When I first joined this company, I began baking again for the first time since quitting my job of harassing people on the street. If not lugging two dozen homemade cookies into the office, I’d eagerly surrender myself to coffee breaks, Friday lunches, after-work drinks, the occasional perfunctory birthday celebrations in the break room with cloying cupcakes and off-brand soda from the supermarket. Every opportunity marked another line in the tally. I’d find homes at the corners of tables and nibble at the cheapest item on the menu as I’d listen to our junior software developer, Anna, ramble about her balding forty-six-year-old partner.

1li3abo,https://i.redd.it/aik4b1rfpk8f1.jpeg,What did I do wrong here?,"Ok so a bit of context..

Me and this gurl are classmates. And after university, the whole class had gone to a coffee shop ( named Double shot ) where we all just hung out and played games.

One of those games was truth and dare, and basically what happened was that this gurl asked me the following dare;

""Who are u attracted to in our friend group?""

And I obviously got a bit awkward at first, but then answered this one girl's name. But then the other classmates started telling me that;

""That gurl ( whose name I said ) is not playing this game, so answer the name of a person who is""

So then I thought about it and just said this gurl's name ( The one who asked me the question and the one who this post about )

Now I don't really want to pursue this gurl, she's good and all but she does have a few things that I see as turn offs, but the reason I said her name was because I think she is probably the only one who's attractive to me in our friend group ( other than the girl whose name I said previously )

So then fast forward to tonight and me and her were just chatting on Insta, and i just wanted to ask her if my answer made her uncomfortable or not at the cafe

( Because at the café we all just laughed it off and she didn't really say anything about it )

But then she answered with this response...

And i feel.. confused.

Like i was expecting her to go;

""Nah it's all ok""

And I could understand if she maybe thinks I am making things awkward for no reason, but if that was the case, then she could've just said that in a less attacking way?

Like.. clearly from my question you can understand that my intention was to just ask if she was comfortable with what happened or not.. I wasn't trying to flirt with her or to see if she was actually interested..

So I wanna know what is going on with her response like this?",2,1750639299.0,teenagers,1,1.0,False

I’m feeling a bit overwhelmed (and honestly, a little sad about feeling overwhelmed) about planning our wedding. We’re already legally married, but we’re planning a small church ceremony so we can share an intimate, meaningful moment together. Something more memorable than the clerk’s office.

We're keeping things simple, partly due to our budget, but also because neither of us feels the need for anything extravagant. I get easily overwhelmed in big groups and don’t enjoy being the center of attention. I much prefer cozy gatherings like game nights, cooking with friends, coffee chats.

Just the idea of wedding dress shopping is stressful. I’ll most likely wear something I already own, maybe add a few accessories and a simple veil. I enjoy shopping for clothes normally, but shopping for something like this, especially here in the U.S. where I’m less familiar with the stores and styles, feels overwhelming. I plan to do my own hair and makeup.

We’ll probably be about 30 people total, including us. We've made a digital invitation image we’ll send out by email or text soon. Most guests already know the date and have kind of confirmed.

Here’s what we’ve planned so far:

We'll use our church for both the ceremony and the meal afterward.

Flowers from Trader Joe’s, arranged by me/us. Church should have enough little vases.

Snacks, prosecco and wine from Costco.

Salad and cake from my family, and we’ll cater our favorite food from a local restaurant (that’ll be our main expense).

Possibly a guestbook with an instant camera so people can snap a photo and leave a note.

Some candles for the tables, and maybe postcards guests can take home and mail back to us with a kind thought or bit of advice.

We’ll ask friends for dishware so we have enough for everyone. Napkins that match the colors of the flowers and candles.

Depending on how many people will actually confirm the invitation, we might make name tags for the seating for the lunch part (it will be a Sunday morning wedding).

All I want is for the day to feel like a reflection of who we are, just simple, warm, and joyful.

We'll make a playlist and use a Bluetooth box. There won't be any big program or dance, as we'll go to church,
then we'll have a toast in the church yard, and then we'll have lunch together. One of my friends will take some pictures.

So, I’d love to hear:

## What Is an AI Photo Generator?

## Step-by-Step: How to Use a Free AI Photo Generator

### 1. Choose the Right Platform

If your needs are general, almost any generator will do. But for NSFW, stylized, or edgy social content, we recommend **[x-artistry](https://www.x-artistry.pics/uncensored-ai-image-generator)** for its uncensored output and creative versatility.

### 2. Craft a Strong Prompt

Include style cues like:

* Cinematic
* Moody lighting
* Hyperrealistic
* Pastel color palette

### 3. Generate & Refine

Most tools let you:

* Choose resolution
* Select style or model
* Regenerate until satisfied

### 4. Download and Format

Ensure your image dimensions match platform specs:

* Instagram post: 1080x1080
* Story: 1080x1920
* Twitter/X: 1200x675

### 5. Add Text (Optional)

Use Canva or native social app editors to overlay text, captions, or logos.

---

## PAA: Is There a Free AI for Generating Social Media Posts?

Yes! While most AI image generators focus on visuals, tools like **x-artistry** enable fully styled image outputs perfect for social media. For text generation, pair it with:

* **ChatGPT** or **Jasper** (for captions)
* **Canva Magic Write**

Combine image and text AIs to create ready-to-post content.

Absolutely. Many free tools can generate professional headshots from text or selfies:

* **Tryiton.ai** (limited free trials)
* **x-artistry** also supports highly stylized portraits or realistic human features, including NSFW variants.

---

## PAA: Is There a Free NSFW AI Image Generator?

Always ensure you comply with platform guidelines before posting such content.

---

## Best Practices for Using AI-Generated Graphics on Social Media

### 1. Match Brand Tone

Customize prompts with colors, styles, and themes consistent with your brand.

### 2. Avoid Repetitive Designs

Reusing prompts? Tweak modifiers (""dreamy lighting,"" ""80s vibe"") to keep things fresh.

### 3. Check Platform Policies

Some social platforms have rules around AI/NSFW content. Always review:

* Instagram's content policies
* X's media guidelines
* YouTube's thumbnail restrictions

### 4. Credit or Disclose When Needed

Some users appreciate transparency. Consider hashtags like:

* \#AIgenerated
* \#CreatedWithAI

* **Real-time co-creation** (generate visuals as you type captions)
* **Better mobile apps** with native integration
* **Ethical watermarking** and transparency tools

As models improve, so will style diversity, accessibility, and copyright handling.

---

Not in contact with my family due to abusive parents. 

Over the last year, the only people that have tried to be friends with me and made an effort to hang out, have all been amab people who it turned out wanted to date me (I'm a lesbian, out as a lesbian, they were aware of my sexuality and still tried anyway 🥲). So they haven't really wanted to be friends, and they've stopped talking to me since it became clear I wouldn't date them. 

I tried setting up an ND coffee meetup on bumble BFF, it was supposed to be today. Multiple people said they were going to go, then one person bailed the day before. I asked who was still planning to come, and no one replied. 

I used to be in a friend group that felt like that as well, they'd rarely suggest plans and it felt like I was having to initiate most of the friendship and chase up plans. I stopped initiating with one of the only people I still talked to in that group a couple of months ago, and she hasn't followed up on the plans we were going to make or talked to me. Just sent me reels.

I've tried going to social groups and then met some of the amab people that just wanted to date me, and it's put me off of going to the groups. Being around them feels like a big reminder that no one is interested in me as a person, at most they're just interested in sex.

In the friendships and relationships i've had, the other person has rarely shown interest in me or asked me about myself, regardless of when I take an interest in them in conversation. I don't know if it's just because I hang around with more ND people or what, but this happens over and over again to the point where I'm fed up and it all feels impossible.

At 36 years old, I started coughing a bit more, having to clear my throat a lot, and spit up phlegm and mucus.  

But I was a pack a day smoker at the time, so I assumed it was just from twenty years of smoking cigarettes.  


Other than that, there was NOTHING.  

I could drink alcohol, I could drink 3 or 4 cups of coffee a day, I could eat any food group, I could drink multiple glasses of milk, I could slather my food in hot sauce, I could eat habanero peppers whole.  


Then one day, **BOOM**.  Everything changed.  

I called an ambulance thinking I was having a heart attack.  My entire chest felt like it was burning, I felt a pressure behind my sternum, my back hurt, my arm and jaw hurt, I had shortness of breath......


Everything checked out at the hospital.  They ran a ton of tests.  I had multiple follow ups with a cardiologist, my heart is.....mostly fine.  No signs of a heart attack or clot.  Had some hypertension issues, but not crazy and on meds controlling it.  CT scan showed the very early signs of some plaque in the arteries, but nothing to worry about with diet and lifestyle changes.  

Three months after that instance I had a endoscopy and colonoscopy.  

They showed a little bit of inflammation in the esophagus, ""healing gastritis"" and I got diagnosed with GERD.  

This literally came out of NOWHERE.  I mean, I guess the coughing and phlegm were a sign, but you wouldn't realize it at the time with no other symptoms, especially as a smoker.  


Since that night everything went to shit (which is now 6 months ago), I still feel awful despite doing everything right.  

I quit smoking, quit drinking, eliminating all caffeine, have been on the acid watcher diet, and a prescription PPI.  I've also gotten on an anti-anxiety med to reduce stress.  

I still feel like shit.  


I get that I was doing damage to my body over the years, but it's insane to me how I went from feeling ""normal"" to feeling like I'm dying 24/7 while never being able to eat things I did for years.

I used to post my works. Here are the updates

The main point is that it is not a **shader**, not a **mod**. It is a set of configs that change colors in HDR mode. And the picture becomes more realistic.   
Unfortunately, this **can only work** with monitors that support HDR mode. 

The main idea of ​​the project is not to use third-party mods, so that in the future, such a picture could be obtained in multiplayer.

In general, there is still a lot of work ahead.  I am just a fan of the game who is interested in digging into the files. Now the yellow filter, which is embedded in the game files, prevents the full realism of the picture. Well, we are waiting for SDK

If you have an HDR monitor and want to test it, here is a link to the instructions for my previous version. [Here](https://buymeacoffee.com/realchornobylzone/s-t-a-l-k-e-r-2-realhdrzone-config)Well, or if you are interested in how the process works and want to try the latest beta version, then you can buy me a [coffee](https://buymeacoffee.com/realchornobylzone/latest-version-hdr-project)

Maybe it was a new roast that was being used, I’m not sure, but I don’t recall it being anything drastic.  I don’t get anything fancy, just unsweetened black iced coffee. I like to add my own half-and-half because I literally only need about a teaspoon in a Venti.  I like the strong/ bitter taste.

Recently, what I described above has been very rare.  Now that iced coffee is coming out of a Clover machine. It seems very weak.  Occasionally, I get a good one, but I can’t put my finger on how to make that happen all the time.

I’ve been getting iced coffee from Starbucks on a regular basis for at least the past 10+ years and was happy with it.  More times than not, that’s not the case anymore. I’m on the verge of throwing in the towel and just making it at home or finding something somewhere else. 

Any advice? Thx.

When we were figuring out a date to meet up, our timing did not align or things kept coming up. After she returned from being out of town for a week and a half, she asked to meet up on Sunday evening, but that day was my daughter high school graduation. So, I suggested next weekend. Despite that it was father's day weekend, she asked when I would be free and I told her that I can arrange around what works for her. We agreed to meet Saturday morning for coffee.

I receive a text from her a day before about pushing back our meet up time to 2pm on Saturday because she needed to take care of some admin stuff for her business. I told her I had hockey then. I'm a little disappointed because I was looking forward to meeting with her that morning. She responds, Ok. No problem. Let me know when you are free."" At this point I felt she was nonchalant about meeting up.

I suggested that I could meet up (next day) Sunday between my two hockey games. She responded, 'That sounds good. What time?' 

I texted her back Sunday morning and I told her my first game is in SM and will be done at 1:30p then the second game in MP, starts at 5p. 

I guess she texted back right away when I look at what time the text was sent, but I didn't get the message in time. I feel bad now. For context she wrote, ""I'm not familiar with SM, however I can meet you near there so you're not press for time to get to your next game. I'm in GB and can meet around 2:30p.""

I wrote her back that evening around 10pm, ""Oh so sorry I played two games and did not get this on time. Maybe come Friday to the off the grid OL museum. Nice crowd I have been organizing people from the dating app to meet IRL""

She has not responded and I feel she has ghosted me.

The stuff is a bed and side tables, dresser, book shelf, coffee table and end tables, an upright piano, and half a dozen boxes or so of things.

What is the best way to do this? Some methods we have investigated:

1. Driving it out in a uHaul. Cost will be about $5000 to rent the truck, plus time to drive it, and gas.
2. Rent a uHaul trailer and drive her RAV4 out and tow it out then sell the RAV4 in PEI instead of Ontario. Trailer rental would be about $1500. The weight of the stuff might exceed the RAV4s towing weight though.
3. Two men and a truck. We used them to move our apartment when we first moved to PEI from Ontario. I am guessing this would cost about $10,000 +/- $2,000.
4. Get a storage locker in Ontario and make multiple trips. This would cost about $250 per leg, or $500 in gas per round trip. Likely take 3-4 trips. Probably another $500 in storage fees.

10:06 am: Hit the snooze button

10:16 am: Hit the snooze button

10:21 am: Hit the snooze button

10:26 am: Roll out of bed and tell Leonetta XVI to make a new cup of coffee. The cup she made for you is cold because you snoozed. Chastise her anyway

10:30 am: Check Instagramita and TikTok, already anticipating dopamine hits from likes, comments and shares

10:39 am: Finish checking socials. Angry because every comment, new follower, like and share has been generated by bots. Make a mental note to yell at the infants from Inspection Collection or whatever. They swore her efforts would make her famous!

10:44 am: Finish coffee, check watch. The infants will be here at 11. No time for a shower. Off with the pajamas, on with the leggings. Already wore them 3 times this week. Sniff test: A-Okay, Jose!

10:56 am: Yell for Leonetta XIX, realize she's doing errands after feeding the ninos, getting them ready for school and dropping them off

11:03 am: The infants are late. Quick unsanctioned post about how difficult it is to round up 7 kids, wrangle them into a car and get them to school on time. End the post with: ""And unlike other celebrities, I really get my kids ready for school and make their lunches. Being a mommy is hard, but it's its own reward so we laugh and have fun. Women should lift each other up, not tear each other down"" Are 3 laughing/crying emojis too much?

11:18 am: The Inspection Infants are finally here, dragging an inflatable castle into the apartment with them. Today they'll shoot B-roll as mami giggles, lip syncs to ""Oops, I Did It Again,"" and suggestively humps the inflatable ramparts

11:21 am: Notice a new boy with the infants. Handsome. Can't be a day older than 19. Deploy Sexy Baby Voice while addressing him, and Spicy Latina Mami Voice for the little slut co-worker he's with

11:30 am: Daily content planning meeting. While one of the children is speaking, notice the little slut doesn't have ample tetas. She might be cute in a certain light, maybe after a few Modelos, but the handsome boy would be missing out on an experienced MILF with considerable tetas

11:38 am: The little slut is saying something about a new TikTok trend, but Mami isn't listening. She's trying to remember how much Alec drank last night, and whether it's possible to pull the boy into her bedroom for a private yoga session before Eyebags McTwatface wakes up

12:15: Lunch break. The Collection kids order Pio Pio delivery. Mami has avocado smeared between two pieces of lettuce. Look at that little slut eating salchipapa! Honey, you'll stay thin now, but you'll be obese and infertile by 30 if you keep eating like this. Good.

1:30 pm: Bouncy castle time

2 pm: Something's wrong with the lighting equipment. Delays

2:48 pm: The ninos are home. Can hear them screeching and telling each other to eat shit from two apartments away

3:02 pm: One of the little girls -- Lulu? -- knocks on the door. Her eyes widen when she sees the bouncy castle. ""A bouncy castle!"" she says excitedly. ""Mommy, you're the bes..."" 

""That's for Mami, not you! Adult stuff, go away! Leonetta! Come take the child!"" Slam the door in her face

3:11 pm: Technical difficulties fixed. FINALLY. Time for Mami to strut her stuff. Two of the Inspector boys are eye-fucking Mami. Mami eye-fucks them back.

""You like that, you little slut?"" she thinks, glaring at the little slut from the Inspectors as she gyrates on a slide to Snow's 'Informer'. ""They're looking at Mami, not you. A real woman with real tetas!"" The little slut is obviously jealous. All women are

4:06 pm: Infants are packing up. They haven't edited the video yet but assure Mami she looks hot, sexy, and most important of all, like a sexy spicy Latina

4:27 pm: Check socials again. Notice comment from miserable Karenita accusing her of having fake nails. Another one claims she wears the same leggings every say and doesn't shower. Make a mental note to plan clapback video showing closet bigger than most people's apartments. Order 76 pairs of leggings off Amazon to prove bitch is WRONG

4:32 pm: Check Amazon book listing. Two more one-star reviews. Fire off angry email to Amazon threatening to sue if they continue to allow peasants to have opinions

4:44 pm: Ninos knock at the door. Tell them to fuck off, call for Leonetta XVIII to collect them and keep them away from door. Halfheartedly leaf through nanny application from potential Leonetta XXI.

4:48 pm: Settle down for nap after long day. Mami gonna be a star. Mami tired

1li2lpc,https://www.reddit.com/r/gallbladders/comments/1li2lpc/post_cholecystectomy_syndrome_please_help/,‼️Post cholecystectomy Syndrome?? PLEASE HELP‼️,"
I had my gallbladder removed 5 years ago. I’m a 30 y/o F, fairly healthy nutrition, and physically fit. 
They did not tell me anything about why my gallbladder needed to be removed other than it was non-functioning. Post-op my surgeon advised me that I had pancreatitis. Everything else looked good. Healed great. No issues. 

About a year ago I had my first child. Bounced back great. No issues. This is only relevant because my eating habits changed with having a baby to care for. My meals were quick-meal prep kind of meals. Protein, rice, veggies. But… For the last 10 months, I have only eaten once a day for most days. (Please don’t lecture me on that- I know, and I’m working on it.)

Roughly 2-3 months ago I began having significant abdo pain. I could not localize the pain. Dizziness. Weakness. Nausea. 
My doctor (without any urine analysis, diagnosed me with a UTI- and told me to contact him if I became worse) 
I did not have a UTI- I insisted I be tested- it was negative. 

For the last month, my DAILY symptoms have been:
 localized pain to my RUQ- under my rib cage. Right sided flank pain. Extreme bloating after eating. EXTREMELY terrible acne breakouts. Gas. Brain fog. Lethargy. (These symptoms are identical to how I felt prior to my cholecystectomy.)

OCCASIONAL symptoms: nausea, Pale-ish bowel movements, headaches. 
**I had one bowel movement that was neon yellow. And that sent me into this rabbit hole of doing the research myself to figure out what the heck is happening to me. 

In the last month I discovered that after gallbladder removal, you are supposed to be taking some sort of bile salts.. which I obviously had not been taking. 
So I’ve begun taking “Dr Berg’s Gallbladder Formula”. And I do feel some relief from the pain. 


I have changed my diet, and make a consistent effort to eat multiple small and healthy meals throughout the day. I have cut dairy completely out. ZERO processed foods. And am only eating chicken, turkey, and fish. Everything I buy is organic. I take a variety of supplements and vitamins. I only drink filtered water and coffee. I try to work out daily. 

But I still have symptoms. My acne is so bad. Like what is happening? I feel like my gut health is just destroyed. I still become so bloated and tired after eating. I’m still incredibly gassy. And I still often feel the pain under my right rib. It’s just not constant like it was before. 

I have looked into a GI-MAP, SIBO, and other tests. My PCP wants to do an ultrasound and is refusing to order me a GI-MAP or SIBO. I want to get a functional medicine doctor to help me, but I’m unsure if I’m willing to spend that money out of pocket. 
The healthcare system has done nothing to get to the root problem and instead has only treated my symptoms throughout this entire process. I don’t trust them anymore. 
I don’t know what else to do. 

Lastly, I’ve had blood work done. Liver enzymes: ALT 21, AST 26- my WBC was on the higher end of normal at 10.5, I’m suspecting it was due to inflammation… everything was within normal ranges

Higher Level:

* English
* APUSH
* AP Lang (possibly)

Standard:

* Continuation of Algebra 2 (trying not to be too specific but it's a step below Precalc)
* Biology
* Spanish
* Performing arts elective

My freshman GPA was around 3.95, sophomore year dropped to barely 3.7. We only record weighted GPA. I took all standard courses freshman year and was placed in all possible honors - 3 classes - sophomore year, as well as an easier AP. I honestly wasn't prepared, some (minor) life events got in the way, and I tanked my grade with mostly Bs and two Cs. With the exception of humanities, I got placed into the lower classes and no matter how high I score, I imagine most of my senior year classes will be mid or lower level.

Of course, I plan to improve my study habits and make a comeback. Last year might be out of my control now, but the regret stings a little more each day. That and the exhaustion of last year is taking up most of my summer. I am doing a couple of STEM projects and studying APs that I'm never going to take. I don't buy too much into hyper-competitive college admissions, however, our school is quite competitive and I've already been left in the dust. My ECs are decent (like a few clubs I'm fairly invested in, I lead one but it's not much time commitment). 

  
Thanks for reading the wall of text. My question is, will somewhat selective colleges understand this? I do plan to go into STEM, more specifically engineering. I took a fairly rigorous engineering course last year - not a graded class, but we do graduate. Not an excuse, but the late nights, often spent at school, as well as the time commitment, does explain the grade drop. I'm relying a bit on my essays, as I'm involved in creative writing (Scholastics honorable mention gang).

Any advice, especially from more experienced upperclassmen, would be a huge help! Have a great day.

TLDR: Sophomore year grades dropped since I'm literally just a girl (I failed like ten unit exams), am now trying to save myself, and need some advice or reassurance. I am also writing this on an evening coffee crash and am new to posting in Reddit, apologies for anything incoherent. ",2,1750636820.0,ApplyingToCollege,3,1.0,False

i’ve always been someone thats not always at 100% (im frecuently tired, with headaches and sleep problems), but i always assumed it was due to stress (im in med school) and to Raynaud’s Syndrome, autism or depression, but in the past month my health has been declined to a point the meds that used to work arent anymore. My family and close friends told me that it was stress and anxiety and with a break and less caffeine i will get better, but even when i (tried to) sleep more and drink less to no coffee nothing worked.

Things got worse in the past two weeks, when it started to get more cold. It started with a migraine that left me in bed for two days. At first it was just the pain in my head and neck, but later i started to have nausea, dizzyness, extreme fatigue, brain fog, difficulty speaking and visual flashes (idk how are these called, but i saw white flashes on my pheriferical vision). Took those two days to rest with only ibuprofen and paracetamol. After that i got better (still with a light headache tho, but it was manageable and let me do my daily tasks) for like 4 days, then my period started and all my symptoms came back, plus the feeling of “heavy legs” and the meds weren’t working anymore.

i told my mom (when i had a little more energy) and she told me to go to to the ER, because when a migraine changes its intensity and/or pressentation it can be a sing of something worse. So i went and they gave me 500 ml of saline solution and 2 strong anti-inflammatorys via IV, which helped but didn’t erease the pain as they expected, so they took a CT scan that showed nothing abnormal. They told me that it was probably just a migraine crisis, and due to Raynauds, its a cronic thing that i should just get used to and learn no manage on my own, gave me pain meds and sent me home.

Then i booked a doctor appointment. Explained everything to him, and also mentioned that my mom has a history of migraines, but aren’t as bad as mine. Told him that last year i had lab test done and everything was normal (including the ANA/ENA for lupus). He made me get another CT scan with contrast + more lab test.

I did a little research and spoke to friends, and the most problable theories are fibromyalgia, cronic fatigue and maybe even POTS. But i now that the thing with these conditions is that its hard to convince doctor to consider, and even harder to treat, to thats the main reason why i wanted to ask for advice here, and mostly also for advice form someone who has similar symptoms on how to function, because with finals approaching i cant be in bed every 3 business days. SO for my next appointment, i want to mention these possibilities to my doctor to see if it can be considered, and hopefully get better help.",3,1750636752.0,ChronicIllness,0,1.0,False

The endless scroll. A sea of sameness. As a social media manager, content creator, or business owner, you know the struggle: creating visually stunning content that stops thumbs, sparks engagement, and doesn't obliterate your budget or schedule. Stock photos feel tired, and custom graphics are time-consuming. But what if you had a secret weapon? An infinitely creative artist, available 24/7, ready to turn your ideas into captivating visuals in seconds.

Welcome to the world of the **AI photo generator**. This transformative technology is no longer a futuristic novelty; it's a practical, powerful tool that's democratizing design and supercharging social media strategies.

This isn't just another list of tools. This is your definitive guide to mastering the art and science of using a free AI pic generator. We'll go beyond the basics and give you a complete workflow—from crafting the perfect prompt to developing a cohesive brand aesthetic and navigating the practicalities of different generators. By the end of this post, you'll be equipped to create unique, attention-grabbing social media graphics that look professional and get results.

## What is an AI Photo Generator (And Why Should You Care)?

At its core, an AI photo generator is a type of artificial intelligence that creates images from text descriptions. You type in a sentence or a series of keywords—known as a **prompt**—and the AI interprets your words to generate a completely new, original image.

### From Text to Treasure: How It Works in Simple Terms

Imagine describing a scene to a fantastically skilled artist. You say, ""A minimalist flat lay of a steaming cup of coffee on a rustic wooden table, with a MacBook and a succulent plant, morning light streaming in."" The artist listens, understands the concepts of ""minimalist,"" ""steaming,"" and ""morning light,"" and paints the picture.

An AI generator does this at lightning speed. It has been ""trained"" on billions of image-and-text pairs from across the internet, learning the relationships between words and visual concepts. When you enter a prompt, it taps into this vast knowledge to construct a pixel-by-pixel representation of your idea.

### The End of Boring Stock Photos: The Social Media Advantage

Why is this a game-changer for social media?

1.  **Infinite Originality:** Stop using the same stock photo as your competitors. Every image you generate is unique to your prompt, giving your brand a distinct visual identity.
2.  **Unbeatable Speed:** Need an image for a last-minute post about a new product launch? You can generate dozens of options in the time it takes to search a stock photo library.
3.  **Cost-Effectiveness:** Many powerful AI photo generators offer free tiers or credits, giving you access to high-quality custom visuals without the cost of a graphic designer or expensive stock photo subscriptions.
4.  **Creative Brainstorming:** Stuck for an idea? Use the AI as a creative partner. Describe a concept and see what it comes up with—it can often spark entirely new campaign directions.

## From Blank Canvas to Viral Post: A 5-Step Workflow

Using an AI generator effectively is more than just typing a random phrase and hoping for the best. Follow this strategic workflow to get predictable, high-quality results every time.

### Step 1: Define Your Goal and Aesthetic

Before you write a single word, ask yourself:
*   **What is this image for?** (Instagram post, Facebook ad, blog header, Story background?)
*   **What is the mood?** (Playful and vibrant, professional and sleek, moody and artistic?)
*   **What are my brand colors and style?** (Do you use pastels, bold colors, minimalist design?)

Having a clear vision is the most crucial step. Write it down. *Example: ""I need a vibrant, eye-catching image for an Instagram post about our new summer skincare line. The mood should be fresh, sunny, and luxurious.""*

### Step 2: Choose the Right AI Generator for the Job

Not all generators are created equal. They differ in style, complexity, and content filters.

*   **For Beginners:** Tools like Midjourney (via Discord) or DALL-E 3 (via Microsoft Copilot) are known for being user-friendly and producing beautiful, artistic results out of the box.
*   **For Power Users:** Platforms like Stable Diffusion (either locally or through web UIs) offer immense control over every variable, from the training model to the composition.
*   **For Creative Freedom:** Some platforms have strict content filters, preventing the generation of anything deemed sensitive, including certain artistic nudes, horror themes, or edgy concepts. If your brand or creative vision requires more flexibility, you may need an **uncensored AI image generator**. These tools provide fewer restrictions, allowing for a wider range of artistic expression, which can be crucial for artists, game developers, or brands with a more mature or avant-garde identity.

### Step 3: Master the Art of the Prompt (The Prompt Engineering Formula)

Your prompt is your paintbrush. A weak prompt gives a blurry, generic image. A great prompt creates a masterpiece. Use this formula for consistently better results:

**[Subject] + [Action/Setting] + [Style/Aesthetic] + [Technical Details]**

*   **Subject:** The main focus. Be specific. Not ""a dog,"" but ""a golden retriever puppy.""
*   **Action/Setting:** What is the subject doing and where? ""A golden retriever puppy playing in a field of wildflowers at sunset.""
*   **Style/Aesthetic:** This is where the magic happens. Use keywords that define the look and feel.
    *   **Artistic Styles:** `impressionist painting`, `art deco`, `psychedelic`, `steampunk`, `pixel art`
    *   **Photography Styles:** `macro photography`, `cinematic shot`, `golden hour lighting`, `long exposure`, `Vogue photoshoot`
    *   **Moods:** `serene`, `energetic`, `dreamy`, `nostalgic`, `futuristic`
*   **Technical Details:** Fine-tune the output.
    *   **Composition:** `close-up shot`, `wide-angle`, `flat lay`, `top-down view`
    *   **Quality:** `hyperrealistic`, `ultra-detailed`, `4K`, `sharp focus`
    *   **Engine/Renderer:** `Unreal Engine`, `Octane Render` (these can add a photorealistic, CGI look)

**Example Prompt Built with the Formula:**
`photorealistic shot of a vibrant fruit smoothie in a glass, splashing out, surrounded by fresh strawberries and blueberries on a white marble countertop, bright studio lighting, macro details, sharp focus, food photography --ar 1:1`
*(Note: `--ar 1:1` is a common parameter for a square aspect ratio, perfect for Instagram).*

### Step 4: Iterate, Refine, and Upscale

Your first generation is rarely your last. Look at the four (or more) options the AI gives you. What do you like? What's missing?

*   **Refine the Prompt:** If the image is too dark, add ""bright, airy lighting."" If it's not realistic enough, add ""hyperrealistic, photorealistic.""
*   **Use Negative Prompts:** Many advanced generators allow you to specify what you *don't* want. `Negative Prompt: blurry, distorted, extra limbs, ugly, bad anatomy.` This helps clean up common AI mistakes.
*   **Upscale:** Once you have a version you love, use the platform's upscale function to generate a larger, higher-resolution version ready for use.

### Step 5: Integrate into Your Graphic Design

An AI-generated image is a powerful asset, but it's often just one part of your final social media post. This is the answer to the common question, **""Is there a free AI to make graphic design?""**

While the AI generator creates the core visual, tools like Canva, Adobe Express, or VistaCreate are where you complete the design.

1.  Upload your upscaled AI image.
2.  Use the graphic design tool to add your logo, text overlays, headlines, and call-to-action buttons.
3.  Ensure the fonts and colors of your text match your brand guidelines.

The AI is your image creator; Canva is your layout and typography tool. The combination is unstoppable.

## Prompting Like a Pro: Recipes for Stunning Social Media Graphics

Let's get practical. Here are some ""prompt recipes"" you can adapt for common social media needs.

### For Instagram Posts: Vibrant Lifestyle & Flat Lays

The goal is to be scroll-stopping and on-brand.
*   **Prompt Recipe:** `Top-down flat lay photography of [Your Product], arranged neatly on a [Texture] background, surrounded by [Thematic Props], soft natural lighting, minimalist aesthetic, vibrant colors, shot on a DSLR --ar 1:1`
*   **Example:** `Top-down flat lay photography of a beautiful ceramic coffee mug, arranged neatly on a dark wood background, surrounded by coffee beans and a croissant, soft natural lighting, minimalist aesthetic, warm tones, shot on a DSLR --ar 1:1`

### For Facebook Ads: High-Contrast, Attention-Grabbing Concepts

Here, clarity and a strong focal point are key to driving clicks.
*   **Prompt Recipe:** `Cinematic product shot of [Your Product] on a simple pedestal, isolated on a [Bold Color] background, dramatic studio lighting creating high contrast, sharp focus, ultra-detailed, 8k, marketing photo --ar 1.91:1`
*   **Example:** `Cinematic product shot of a sleek black wireless headphone on a simple pedestal, isolated on a vibrant orange background, dramatic studio lighting creating high contrast, sharp focus, ultra-detailed, 8k, marketing photo --ar 1.91:1`

### Creating Professional AI Headshots for Your Profiles

Yes, there are free and powerful ways to create AI headshots. Instead of specialized, often costly services, you can use a general **AI photo generator** with the right prompt. This requires a bit more skill but offers incredible flexibility.

*   **Prompt Recipe:** `Professional corporate headshot of a [Gender/Ethnicity/Age] with [Hair Style/Color] and [Clothing], smiling confidently, in a modern office with a blurred background, soft studio lighting, sharp focus on the eyes, photorealistic, DSLR quality photo --ar 1:1`
*   **Pro Tip:** For best results, some platforms allow you to upload a photo of yourself as a reference (image-to-image), which the AI can use as a stronger guide for likeness.

## Beyond Single Images: AI for Full Social Media Posts

The next frontier is here. People often ask, **""Is there a free AI for generating social media posts?""** The answer is yes, by combining tools.

While few single platforms do everything perfectly for free, you can create a powerful ""AI assembly line"":

1.  **Generate the Image:** Use your AI photo generator with the techniques above.
2.  **Generate the Caption:** Use an AI writer like ChatGPT or Jasper. Give it the context: ""Write three engaging Instagram captions for an image of a new wireless headphone. Tone: exciting and tech-focused. Include a call-to-action to 'Shop Now' and relevant hashtags.""
3.  **Combine & Schedule:** Put the AI image and AI text together in your preferred graphic design tool or social media scheduler.

This multi-tool approach allows you to leverage the best of AI for both visuals and copy, dramatically cutting down your content creation time.

## Navigating the Practical Side: Copyright and Ethical Use

This is a critical topic. Who owns an AI-generated image? The landscape is still evolving, but here's the simple breakdown for social media use:

*   **General Rule (as of 2024):** In the U.S., works created solely by AI without significant human authorship cannot be copyrighted. This means the raw output of a prompt is often considered public domain.
*   **Platform Terms of Service:** This is what matters most for you. **Read the terms of the AI generator you use.** Most commercial services (both free and paid) grant you a broad license to use the images you create, including for commercial purposes like marketing and social media. They essentially give you ownership-like rights to your generations.
*   **Ethical Use:** Avoid generating images in the distinct, recognizable style of a living artist without their consent. Don't create misleading or harmful images. Use AI as a tool to enhance your *own* creativity, not to mimic others.

For most social media and marketing use cases, using images you generate on a commercial-friendly platform is perfectly acceptable.

## Conclusion: Your New Creative Co-Pilot

The **AI photo generator** is more than just a novelty; it's a fundamental shift in digital creativity. It's the ultimate assistant for any social media professional, small business, or creator looking to produce a higher volume of higher-quality content.

By moving beyond simple prompts and adopting a strategic workflow, you can unlock its true potential. You can define your aesthetic, craft detailed instructions, and generate a limitless stream of on-brand visuals that capture attention and tell your story. You learned how to craft graphics, headshots, and even full posts by combining AI tools. The barrier between your creative vision and a finished, professional graphic has never been lower.

The age of generic content is over. The age of infinite, personalized creativity is here.

### Call to Action

Japan is famous for its [unspoken social norms](https://blog.gaijinpot.com/what-not-to-do-in-japan-polite-habits-that-can-seem-rude/).

These unspoken rules in Japan aren’t always spelled out in guidebooks, but many Japanese people still expect them to be understood and followed.

## 1. Putting Money Directly into Someone’s Hand

[![Unwritten Rules of Japan That Nobody Tells You (But You’ll Definitely Break)](http://cdn.gaijinpot.com/app/uploads/sites/4/2025/06/iStock-1334774708-1024x640.jpg)](http://cdn.gaijinpot.com/app/uploads/sites/4/2025/06/iStock-1334774708.jpg)
_Best not to come off too forward._

In Japan, the word for money is _o-kane_, not just _kane_. The _o-_ is a polite prefix, and its use reflects the deep respect given to money—not just in how it’s earned and spent, but also in how it’s handled.

That respect extends to daily transactions. In most restaurants and stores, there’s a small tray on the counter for handing over cash. Giving money directly into someone’s hand can come off as a bit too forward or even rude, especially in more formal places.

## 2. Public Displays of Affection (PDA)

[![Unwritten Rules of Japan That Nobody Tells You (But You’ll Definitely Break)](http://cdn.gaijinpot.com/app/uploads/sites/4/2025/06/iStock-1221845432-1024x640.jpg)](http://cdn.gaijinpot.com/app/uploads/sites/4/2025/06/iStock-1221845432.jpg)
_Play it safe and stay lowkey._

Holding hands is fine, but anything more—hugging, kissing, leaning on your partner—can turn heads quickly in Japan. It’s not necessarily offensive, but it is awkward, especially in family areas, on public transportation or anywhere near older folks.

Japan values emotional restraint in public spaces. Even longtime couples tend to keep affection private, with the unspoken idea being that closeness is something to be shared at home, not out in the open.

That said, social norms are slowly shifting among younger generations, especially in major cities. But the change is still subtle. The one time you’ll see more obvious PDA? Late at night—_and usually from very drunk couples._ If you’re out with your partner, think “low-key.” Most people won’t say anything, but you’ll blend in more if you save the cuddling for later.

## 3. Bathing Etiquette

[![Unwritten Rules of Japan That Nobody Tells You (But You’ll Definitely Break)](http://cdn.gaijinpot.com/app/uploads/sites/4/2025/06/iStock-1349897300-1024x640.jpg)](http://cdn.gaijinpot.com/app/uploads/sites/4/2025/06/iStock-1349897300.jpg)
_Always wash yourself before you enter the tub._

Japanese bathing culture is as much about ritual as it is about relaxation. Whether you’re in a hot spring (_onsen_) or a public bathhouse (_sento_), a few unspoken rules apply:

- Wash and rinse your body _before_ entering the tub.
- The tub is for soaking, not scrubbing.
- Don’t let towels touch the bathwater.
- You can use the small towel to cover yourself on your way to the bath.
- You can also place it on your head while soaking.
- Use the large towel only after getting out.

As long as your (clean) body is the only thing entering the shared bath, you’re doing just fine.

## 4. Do Not Bring Tipping To Japan

[![Unwritten Rules of Japan That Nobody Tells You (But You’ll Definitely Break)](http://cdn.gaijinpot.com/app/uploads/sites/4/2025/06/iStock-1470790419-1024x640.jpg)](http://cdn.gaijinpot.com/app/uploads/sites/4/2025/06/iStock-1470790419.jpg)
_Avoid an uncomfortable situation by not tipping._

At most restaurants and hotels in Japan, the service charge is already included, and tipping is not expected. In fact, offering a tip might make staff uncomfortable or confused, especially in more traditional or upscale places.

That said, with more tourists arriving from tipping-heavy cultures—and wages in hospitality remaining stagnant—some younger staff are now quietly accepting tips in casual settings, especially tourist spots. You might spot a tip jar at a coffee shop or see a service charge listed on your receipt. But don’t force it.

It’s not just Japanese people who prefer things this way. For many foreigners living in Japan—especially Americans and Canadians—one of the best parts of dining out is the _absence_ of tipping. No guessing games, no awkward math, no pressure. Introducing tipping culture here isn’t just unnecessary—it’s unwelcome by locals _and_ long-term residents alike.

If you want to show appreciation, do it the Japanese way: say a sincere _arigatou gozaimasu_ and come back as a regular customer.

## 5. Not Queuing for Escalators or Cutting in Line

[![Cutting in line](http://cdn.gaijinpot.com/app/uploads/sites/4/2025/06/pixta_41000709_M-1024x640.jpg)](http://cdn.gaijinpot.com/app/uploads/sites/4/2025/06/pixta_41000709_M.jpg)
_Just do as the locals do, and you should be fine._

Here, Order is everything. In Tokyo, people stand on the _left_ side of the escalator and walk on the _right_. In Osaka, it’s the opposite. Similarly, even walking on the sidewalk follows a flow, usually matching the direction of car traffic.

That said, rules are sometimes ignored during rush hour—even by locals. The safest approach? Just follow what everyone around you is doing. Don’t cut in line at the escalator and don’t rush on the train if there is already a queue (especially if people are still getting off).

## 6. Don’t Pass Food with Chopsticks

[![hashi-watashi](http://cdn.gaijinpot.com/app/uploads/sites/4/2025/06/iStock-1195232980-1024x640.jpg)](http://cdn.gaijinpot.com/app/uploads/sites/4/2025/06/iStock-1195232980.jpg)
_Think twice before you use your chopsticks to pass food around._

You’ve probably already heard that sticking chopsticks upright in a bowl of rice is considered rude in Japan. This practice mirrors a funeral ritual in which rice is left as an offering to the dead.

But did you know that passing food directly from one pair of chopsticks to another is also tied to death? It closely resembles a cremation ceremony where family members transfer the bones of the deceased between chopsticks. Because of this, even if your intentions are good, the gesture can feel unsettling.

Most Japanese people will understand that it was an innocent mistake, but it still creates an awkward moment. If you want to share food, use the **opposite end of your chopsticks** (the clean side), or offer the plate and let the other person take what they want.

## 7. Wearing Strong Perfume or Cologne

[![wearing strong perfume](http://cdn.gaijinpot.com/app/uploads/sites/4/2025/06/iStock-1179215691-1024x640.jpg)](http://cdn.gaijinpot.com/app/uploads/sites/4/2025/06/iStock-1179215691.jpg)
_Try not to wear strong fragrances, if at all._

While a bold designer scent might turn heads in other countries, in Japan, it’s more likely to turn stomachs, especially in tight public spaces like trains or elevators. Japan tends to value cleanliness as scentless. Personal hygiene is expected, but strong smells—good or bad—are considered _meiwaku_ (a nuisance) to others. Many companies even have internal rules or unwritten expectations discouraging perfume or scented products at work.

You’ll rarely hear anyone say anything to your face, but you may notice people quietly shifting away from you in enclosed spaces. The cultural ideal is to be clean, quiet and unobtrusive, so wearing a fragrance that enters the room before you do is definitely not the norm.

Deodorant is fine (and appreciated). But if you want to wear fragrance, keep it subtle. Think of it this way: if strangers can smell you, it’s too much. That includes your BO.

## 8. Blowing Your Nose in Public

[![Blowing nose in public](http://cdn.gaijinpot.com/app/uploads/sites/4/2025/06/iStock-934590548-1024x640.jpg)](http://cdn.gaijinpot.com/app/uploads/sites/4/2025/06/iStock-934590548.jpg)
_Step away from others before you blow your nose._

People from Western countries consider blowing their nose into a tissue good hygiene—polite, even. But in Japan, it’s considered bad manners to do so in public, especially in quiet places like trains, offices, classrooms, or elevators.

Why? The sound is seen as disruptive, and many people associate nose-blowing with illness or lack of self-restraint. It’s not that people don’t get sick in Japan—it’s that the etiquette around being visibly ill is different. Instead, most people quietly sniffle until they can excuse themselves. This is also why you’ll hear a _lot_ of sniffling during winter or hay fever season (_kafunshō_).

Rather than draw attention by loudly blowing their nose, people will endure it until they can find a private spot like a restroom or stairwell. If you’ve got a runny nose, try to step away from others before you take care of it. Wearing a mask is also common and helps avoid both the need to sniffle and the social awkwardness that comes with it.

## 9. Using the Wrong Honorific—or None at All

[![Yobisute - dropping an honorific](http://cdn.gaijinpot.com/app/uploads/sites/4/2025/06/iStock-1150711118-1024x640.jpg)](http://cdn.gaijinpot.com/app/uploads/sites/4/2025/06/iStock-1150711118.jpg)
_When in doubt, use -san._

In Japanese, names often come with titles like _-san_, _-sensei_, or _-sama_, and skipping them can come off as rude. Calling someone by their first name without a title is known as _yobisute_—and it’s a big cultural faux pas unless you’re close friends.

On the flip side, being _too_ polite can also be awkward. Using formal language with kids or acting overly deferential in casual situations may feel unnatural. Japanese speakers often adjust their level of formality based on the situation, and it’s something that takes time to learn.

When in doubt, use _-san_, and if you slip up, a quick _shitsurei shimasu_ (excuse me) goes a long way.

## 10. Handling Items with One Hand

[![Unwritten Rules of Japan That Nobody Tells You (But You’ll Definitely Break)](http://cdn.gaijinpot.com/app/uploads/sites/4/2025/06/pixta_26683685_M-1024x640.jpg)](http://cdn.gaijinpot.com/app/uploads/sites/4/2025/06/pixta_26683685_M.jpg)
_Show your gratitude by receiving items with two hands._

Whether it’s handing over a credit card, business card (_meishi), or a gift, using both hands shows respect. One-handed exchanges can feel careless,_ especially in formal situations.

Using both hands is tied to the idea of sincerity and attentiveness. Even at a convenience store, you’ll notice staff returning your change with two hands. It’s not just habit—it’s cultural etiquette.

### Japan’s Unspoken Etiquette

Much like its language, Japanese culture is about what _isn’t_ said as much as what is. These social rules can feel like a dance you don’t know the steps to, but the good news is? Most people are forgiving when you misstep.

The best approach is to stay humble and open to correction. Everyone has a story. I once walked around an entire school wearing&nbsp;_toilet slippers,_&nbsp;and it still makes me cringe.

_How about you? Ever broken one of these unspoken rules in Japan? Let us know your story in the comments._

Beginnings are really hard, so let’s just begin:

**INTRO :** Hi hello, I’m [Sam!](https://imgur.com/a/X66xkE1) I’m 29 and have been around the sun enough to want to find my forever person. Currently I'm looking to do my grad program - I'm thinking, Graphic Design and Digital Media; I've always been an artsy sort, I'd love to do it professionally at long last.

**WHERE YOU AT? :** Currently, I am in the US and, more specifically, the East Coast. That will likely not remain for much longer as I suss out what my next steps are, the major factors being grad school, careers, and *the collapse of the United States.*

**A RELATIONSHIP? – \[YES\] :** To me, an ideal relationship isn’t just being in love or in lust or two best friends that eventually shrug and say “yeah, might as well.” It’s *all* of those and so much more. You should be able to refer to each other as “babe, dude, lover” all interchangeably and mean each of them simultaneously. It is a conscious and continuous choice and commitment, that we’ll choose one another each day over everything and everyone else, through struggles and anxiety, because this is what we have pledged to, working and playing together through the difficult and fun times alike. Very purposefully, my goal for dating is to create a lasting, life long partnership, where we will make our plans together, supporting and elevating each other towards our individual and shared dreams. Want to go back to school and become a lawyer? Suit up, I am making you breakfast each morning no matter how disgustingly early you get up, or at least packing you a homemade lunch the night before, we’re House Husbanding this if we need to for that kind of career. Are we starting a family? Doubly so, I will HOLD down this fort and get you whatever you need to make it through and I will get myself a cool robotic hand after you crush one of them in the delivery room. Not interested in that, that’s okay too, we will keep our passports up to date and travel whenever the chance presents itself, whether we’re running from a regime or just want to go see Mt. Fuji. We can make this whatever we want it to be, as long as it’s together and with belief in each other. That’s really what I’m looking for - something to last a lifetime and then past that so we can keep company in elysium or, your preferred afterlife.

**WHAT HE’S LOOKING FOR :** Truthfully? I don’t know what my ideal partner looks like or acts like, other than a few basic ideals like: Being kind, intelligent, having integrity, loyal to us and your friends and family and beliefs, altruistic, honest to others and to yourself, has passions and will share what matters to you with me so that I can appreciate it too.

Vibes wise - I find a huge swath of forms and styles attractive. It’s really about more who is inhabiting that person? It’s who that image *is* that is what matters to me, I would not be fooled by that doppelganger subplot or an evil twin for a fraction of a second. I am currently figuring out my own presentation, if I want to express slightly more feminine than just the Bedraggled College Professor™ energy I currently emanate, maybe we push it closer to Oh, That’s a Beautiful Hyrulian Warrior™! As such, I welcome you in whatever style you like - I’m going to guess you’ll be nuerospicy like I am and probably have some they/them to your she/her. Dresses, jeans, oversized hoodies, athletic wear, suit and tie - if you’re femme or androgynous or more masculine or cycle between all of them, *amazing*. Variety is the spice of life, right? Just be you, and arrive to the party healthy and healed and whimsical – and also generally close to my age bracket, I think either 3-4 years on either side of me is okay (my rule is, if we could have been in the same four year college at the same time, we’re golden. We should be about equally developed as people and in the same chapters of our lives, if not the same page.)

**LIKES, HOBBIES, PASSIONS :** I have been drawing since I could even vaguely hold a pencil (again, lemme do it professionally, universe, c'mon.) I was born the same year Pokemon came to the West so, there was a zero percent chance I was going to escape that formative interest. I love Pokemon and will be drawing them for you at some point or another, that’s just going to happen. I adore cats but all animals too and will happily point out whatever I see on any excursions we might get the chance to take - Yes I do hear a woodpecker, let’s go find it. I am a big fan of cooking, both on my own and with a trusted co-chef, and we would in time compile a family cookbook, if we make it that far along. I am big into animation, Adventure Time was hugely inspirational to me, and I’d love to learn Blender this year - the third Spiderverse film is currently my “gotta stay alive until” to hype myself up when things seem grim. I’m also refusing to die until I see what the One Piece is, that’s a big one, and every new release of From Soft, the Pokemon Company, and a Monster Hunter title are a festival in this house, as will Haunted Chocolatier for the very cozy inclined. Martial arts and generally being active and exploring the natural world is special to me, as well as finding coffee houses we like. I've been working my way up to being a frequent flier at the gym, we can go gym together if you're into that. Otherwise, let’s make our way through every gallery, museum, zoo, and aquarium there is to be had and keep a ledger of the ones we like the very best. I could and would and will keep going on, but I’ll save that for after we’ve started chatting - otherwise, I’m just blathering into the void as usual - tl;dr, let's do cute, fun, nerdy stuff.

**CONCLUSION :** If you’ve actually read through all of that - wow, alright then. Clearly I’m at least a little interesting, I’ve resonated with you even just a bit. Send me more than a hello, tell me a little about yourself, let’s figure out if we have something here. The “worst” that could happen is that you’ll make a cool new friend (cool is subjective) - the best? We’ll find out I suppose. That’s all for now, and what an all it was.

1li1yg8,https://www.reddit.com/r/hamburg/comments/1li1yg8/discovering_hamburg_slowly/,Discovering Hamburg slowly,"Hey everyone,

I’m looking to discover parts of Hamburg and German culture at a relaxed pace with good company, semi-deep conversations, and minimal hangovers. I moved to Hamburg last year for work. I am also nearing the end of my PhD, so I feel like I can be a human again. 

I’ve wandered around a few places myself of course, but I still feel like I’ve only scratched the surface. So far, some of my favorite spots are Japanischer Garten, Außenalster, or Hammer Park; and for rainy days I like Kunsthalle, Abaton Kino, Zentralbibliothek, or Planetarium. I’m not really into raves or shouting over bad techno (except for Depri Disko). 

I’m 38, from Turkey, living in Eilbek/Hamm. I’m into independent cinema, nature, art, philosophy, and psychology. My German is conversational, as long as that conversation is short, forgiving, and mostly in English.

I’m available for hangouts during the week and prefer one-on-one or small groups. Also, I really don’t like planning my coffee six weeks in advance. If you’re good at last-minute but not too last-minute, we’re set.

If any of this resonates with you or if you’re also just trying to balance being a functioning adult with a mild existential crisis, feel free to reach out.

Hi! It's nice to meet you. I am a 28 year old cisgender asexual/omniromantic female who is looking to meet anyone who considers themselves to be male. My hobbies include watching cooking , baking, knitting, sewing, reading, anime, reading manga, reading comic books, reading manhwa, watching cartoons, reading webtoons etc. Those are not all my hobbies you'll have to message me to find out more. I would like to get married eventually. I would like to have kids. I consider myself to be sex repulsed and would prefer a partner who is the same. I am looking for someone kind, caring, accepting, honest, loyal, respectful, someone who makes me feel safe. I want someone accepting because I have some disabilities. They are autism, ADHD, anxiety, bipolar disorder, depression, and schizoaffective disorder. I also have a genetic defect that makes me extremely sensitive to certain things such as caffeine, so no coffee dates. Being accepting of me and my disabilities is a requirement. As for my appearance I am 5'6, 179 pounds (so slightly overweight), dark brown curly hair that is somewhat long, dark brown eyes, and olive skin tone. I am not religious and would prefer someone who is also that way. Also appearance is way too important for me. I am not a fan of physical touch and would prefer someone who is the same.  I am from New York and would prefer someone from the USA. Anyway I look forward to hearing from you soon!",1,1750635212.0,r4rAsexual,0,1.0,False

I got a new job yesterday. Which is good because rent is due in two weeks and I’ve nearly blown through my savings. A tanned and plump hand slipped the assignment through the crack in my bedroom window. One whose arm reached impossible lengths and whose owner had their body tucked around the corner out of my sight. To avoid being rude to a house guest, invited or not, I took the manilla envelope and waited until the hand had completely retracted from my window to open it.

Inside the envelope are two sheets of paper. Printed at the top is a bold typeface that reads ‘Delivery position. Monday through Friday, 7pm to 4am. $35/hr, gas compensated. First day: tomorrow.’ Below that: ‘Congratulations on joining the team!’ And below even that are my uniform specifications: Plain black t-shirt with a pocket on the chest, full-length jeans, and close-toed shoes. It then lists the address. The second sheet of paper was a W-2 with a typed sticky note attached instructing me to fill it out and hand it in tomorrow first thing.

\*\*\*

It’s a warm and cheerful evening when I arrive at my new job. Of course, when I glance at the clock on my dashboard, I’m fifteen minutes early, because like my grandfather always told me: ‘if you’re not early, you’re late, and if you're late, you’re fired’. Usually his advice was prefaced by “you’re unsettling, and people won’t like that.” and culminated in, “so do ‘x, y, and z’ and they won’t mind you too much.” Whenever he visited the children's home I grew up in, he passed on gems like that and I’ve found each one just as useful as the last.

Just as my GPS said it would be, the shop sits tucked in the rear of a pitch black alley. The unlit neon sign above the door is a simple curled tentacle, and along the suckers are a series of swirling letters that my brain interprets as ‘Unspeakable Horrors’. When I blink, I swear the tentacle on the sign shifts in place, as though restless. I shake my head to dispel the illusion, swallow my nerves, and push the door open. The bell on the inside handle announces my arrival, but no one greets me at the register. Dishes clatter and food sizzles in the kitchen, but the long metal gate is shut, so the chef remains a mystery. “Excuse me.” I call, and there’s a beat of silence in the cacophony before it resumes its regular tune. I try again, projecting my voice louder this time. “Excuse me, I’m here about the delivery driver's position?”

When there’s still no reply, I turn around and take in the shop. Best to be patient. Someone will come out eventually, right? There are a handful of red booths, and a few blonde wood tables whose sizes range from seating two to six patrons each. At the far left of the shop, resting atop a small round table where a single person would struggle to eat their meal without feeling cramped, is a 90s classic: a cherry red Sangyn brand landline telephone. The kind with the buttons instead of the previous model’s rotary style face. It and the table beneath it are the only items on the left side of the store, aside from the swinging traffic doors that lead to the kitchen. The menu above the register gives me the same issues as the sign out front. The letters swim, and I can’t tell if this is a deli, a sandwich shop, or a pizza parlor. All I glean is the delivery fee: +$2.50 for every ten miles outside of the regular delivery zone. 

The phone’s sudden shrill ringing sends jolts of nostalgia through me. With hardly a glance around, yet brimming with hesitation, I stride towards the phone and answer it with a confused, “Hello?” Not my phone, not my problem, so why did I answer it?

There’s no voice on the other end, no breathing either. No tone, or buzz, just a sucking silence that makes my ear ache from where I’ve pressed it against the receiver. My mind goes blank. My eyes stop seeing. The cells that make up my body seem to stretch as though moving ahead without me. Time ceases, granting me a small sampling of infinity. 

**Welcome,** the dark and terrible emptiness says without saying. **When the kitchen bell rings, a delivery is ready. Do not look inside the bag. Deliver to the address printed on the receipt. Ignore all handwritten notes you may see. Return promptly. Remain in the lobby. Do not enter the kitchen. Questions?**

Just one.

“What do we deliver?” I ask, my tongue numb.

Nothing but static comes over the line.

My senses come back to me as I hang up the phone without meaning to, but the message is clear; I’m hired. If I had a dad, I bet he’d be proud. Heart full of sunshine, I do a little happy dance across the lobby. Behind the cash wrap, I find an ancient-looking broom and a banged up silver dust pan. Instead of leaning, I get to cleaning.

I’m still grinning from ear to ear when the kitchen bell rings for the first time. I gently place the broom against the wall, and dump the dustpan on the way to the bathroom to wash my hands. “Be right back!” I say as I grab the handles of an unassuming brown paper bag that reeks of copper. The weight of it surprises me and I grunt as I heave and move towards the door. As I hoist it, the contents wiggle, almost like half frozen jello. There’s also a strange heat radiating from it that warms my fingers where they’re wrapped around the little twisted paper handles. *What kind of food is this?* I think, but I don’t peek and, you know what, I definitely won’t yuck someone’s yum, so I turn my thoughts to my guessing what part of town I’ll end up in.

In my car, I turn on the passenger seat warmer so the package doesn’t get cold during the drive. Then I squawk along with the radio and gently drum on my steering wheel until I pull into the parking lot of an apartment complex. As I remove my seatbelt, I glance down at the receipt and see the zero dollar tip in the bottom corner. \*Ah, bummer,\* I think, my lips pulling to one side in displeasure. Then I remember the hourly wage and my mood is cheerful once more. \*If no one ever tips me, I’ll be a-okay with that.\* I grin to myself. The sun has long since set, but the breeze is still warm and the moon is bright enough to guide my way. The delivery note on the receipt says to bring it to the leasing office, which is easy enough to find. It’s the big brick building at the forefront of the complex with the big wooden sign that reads ‘LEASING OFFICE’.  
  
The massive double doors open to a spacious lobby decorated in various shades of coffee and beige. The clacking of mechanical keyboards draws my attention to the right side of the room. Centered perfectly is a massive white desk, framed by two towering iron lamps. Sitting at that desk are three women who look almost exactly the same. From their hair color and style, to their makeup, to their clothes, they’re identical, with only a single difference between them. Never once do their heads lift, nor do their eyes drift from their screens.

On the left is an older woman. Elderly, certainly, but not at all frail. On the right, a woman in her fifties. She sits tall as she types. In the center, a young woman. Somewhere between sixteen and twenty-five depending on how frequently I blink. There’s a strange sort of pressure behind my eyes as I step forward with the delivery, and for a second my vision blurs. The three women merge into one, and again, just for a second, the world changes. I step foot into a cave a hundred miles above a craggy shoreline. Sea salt and brine fill my nostrils and behind the merged woman is a massive loom where a brightly colored tapestry lay half-finished. Then my vision clears and the three women have their own bodies, and the package in my hand weighs so much that my arm trembles to keep it upright. Sweat pours down my temples. I have to focus on my breathing to avoid throwing up.

The young woman in the middle, still without ever raising her gaze to meet my own, reaches out a single hand to take the delivery. Eagerly, I pass it over the computer monitor. She takes the heft of the package with ease and hands it to the woman on her right. The woman on her right then reaches underneath her desk and extracts a large yellow umbrella. The umbrella moves from the woman on the right to the woman in the middle, who then passes it to me. “Oh,” I say, and glance over my shoulder to gauge the weather, “I don’t think I’ll need that. The forecast said no rain all week.”

The elderly woman speaks, startling me as honestly I’d forgotten about her entirely. “Take it.” She intones, pecking at her keyboard one finger at a time. Maybe I’m still overwhelmed by the image of the cave, or maybe it’s the aura of authority that radiates from her, but I don’t argue any further. I take the umbrella and stagger out of the leasing office. The double door's slam suit behind me; the sound of the wood crashing together makes me flinch. I clutch the umbrella in my hand and take a second to gather myself. Upon my first steady inhale, the sky opens. Rain pours from clouds that snuck up on me, and the temperature drops so suddenly all the heat from my body seems to be sucked away with a single gust of wind. The only bit of heat comes from the fingers that held the delivery, so I press them to my throat and savor the warmth. With my other hand, I pop the button on the umbrella and let it spring open. With the big yellow shield above my head, I race to my car.

Back at the shop, the rain continues. In fact, it’s coming down even harder than before. For a brief minute, I consider sitting in the parking lot outside the alley until the rain passes, but the list of rules I was given thirty minutes ago remind me that I’m not to dilly-dally on delivery, so I brave the rain once more. Honestly, the umbrella is perfect, but when I close it to bring it inside the shop, the kitchen erupts into deafening chaos. Thunderous clangs of metal hitting metal, the impact of which is so strong it dents the grate that hides the kitchen from view.

A warbling wail that makes my stomach turn with dread. I drop the umbrella to clap my hands over my ears. The second I let go, the umbrella goes flying outside the building as though kicked, and the door slams shut behind it. Silence descends upon me, and cautiously my hands fall from their protective position. I watch the yellow umbrella spin down the alley until it disappears from sight. “Sorry.” I say as I turn towards the kitchen. Something tugs my gaze upwards, and I spot a small sign above the menu. It’s a white circle about the size of my face, with a yellow umbrella printed on it, and a big red circle with a line through it, indicating that the item is banned from the premises. “Oh, sorry.” I say again, “I didn’t see that. No umbrellas, got it.”

Out of guilt for pissing off my new employer on my first day, I find cleaning sprays and gloves, and get to work scrubbing the backsplash below the kitchen window. The noises in the kitchen taper off, and eventually the only sound in the shop is the *scritch-scritch-scritch* of my scouring pad against the tiles, and the rain hammering against the pavement outside. That’s how I pass the rest of my shift, and by the time four a.m rolls around, I’ve done a single delivery all day. As I gather my belongings, the phone rings. The receiver is in my hands before I can blink, “Hello.” I state.

**Good work today,** the dark and terrible emptiness says without saying. **Leave your paperwork on the counter. Payday is every Tuesday. Your check will be in the register. See you tomorrow.** Then I’m out the door, having successfully completed my first day of work. As tired as I am, I can’t help but have a spring in my step. This job, while confusing and stressful at times, feels like a good fit for me. I pull my keys out of my pocket as I exit the alley and turn into the parking lot, where a rubber-duck-yellow umbrella rests on the hood of my car.",1,1750634676.0,CreepCast_Submissions,0,1.0,False

Anything from giving a bath, diaper changes, making food, etc. My son is 3 now and I’m so over it. Initially I was letting it go because he used to work more than me (although I made two times more than him). But he got laid off last year and I’ve been the breadwinner ever since. He still makes little to no effort in doing stuff that would take off some burden from me. He cleans up a lot and does laundry, but leaves me to fold the laundry. Our house is spotless but we don’t have anything to eat if I don’t cook.

In the weekend I do about 70% of the work, I get no downtime, and I’m super burnt out. When I bring it up with him he says that he can’t do much because our son prefers me over him. It’s true, he’s a Velcro and asks for mommy all the time (bath time, naptime, etc). But he doesn’t even try to distract him and get my son to like doing things with him. On top of that, he doesn’t even want to do any fun things on the weekend. I just go with my son to the park or the coffee shop while my husband stays behind and watches the tv. He’s just so freaking annoying.

I have tried telling him once or twice that this isn’t working and I might file for divorce if he doesn’t make an effort. Then he says he’ll probably fall into depression and be homeless because we’re his whole life and he has no where else to go. It’s emotional manipulation but I also know that it will be true. He’s just so incompetent I don’t even know why tf I decided to have a kid with him. I don’t know why I posted this here, I just thought I’d vent.

1li1nxt,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1li1nxt,I did it!,"I flew! And I was ok! 

I needed to fly to for work, and my flying fear was compounded by a moderate level of anticipatory agoraphobia. So I had been anxious for months now about how things would be. It was my first flight in a couple of years and the first one since I had a bad OCD episode last year, which also raised my general anxiety levels. 

BUT I worked on it. I found this brilliant place and have been reading many posts over the last few weeks from people who feel the same but who still successfully took their flights. Very inspiring and also comforting. And I got the book ""Fear of Flying Workbook"" which I only had time to get part way through but which really started to unlock something in my mind about how I don't need to fear anxiety. 

I had an extra day in Berlin after my work event which was the best day. I am a bit annoyed with myself as I took the easy option on the flight home and managed the anxiety with alcohol (it had also been a loooong and intense work week). But I am determined to build on the success of my outbound flight and keep chipping away at the fear of fear. ",12,1750634506.0,fearofflying,1,1.0,False

The noises in the kitchen taper off, and eventually the only sound in the shop is the *scritch-scritch-scritch* of my scouring pad against the tiles, and the rain hammering against the pavement outside. That’s how I pass the rest of my shift, and by the time four a.m rolls around, I’ve done a single delivery all day. As I gather my belongings, the phone rings. The receiver is in my hands before I can blink, “Hello.” I state.

**Good work today,** the dark and terrible emptiness says without saying. **Leave your paperwork on the counter. Payday is every Tuesday. Your check will be in the register. See you tomorrow.** Then I’m out the door, having successfully completed my first day of work. As tired as I am, I can’t help but have a spring in my step. This job, while confusing and stressful at times, feels like a good fit for me. I pull my keys out of my pocket as I exit the alley and turn into the parking lot, where a rubber-duck-yellow umbrella rests on the hood of my car.

    I’m home now, and I should make myself dinner and get to bed, but I can’t. My body is brimming with a buzzing energy that leaves me pacing in my kitchen. That’s why I’m here, typing this. I can’t sleep, but I know I’ll be going back tomorrow night, so hopefully writing will help me process things and tire my brain out enough to let me rest. I’ll answer any questions as soon as possible, but hopefully I fall asleep soon so it might be tomorrow before I can get to replying. ",1,1750634428.0,u_Practical_Use3387,0,1.0,False

Sorry this a long one! 
My fiancé has been working late nights and weekends for the last two weeks to get a big job done in a short time at work. It's paying good money and he agreed. He wants us to go on a nice holiday next year and put some money aside.
I'm not going to tear him away from his job, he's always been a hard worker and ensures we have what we need. We have had amazing times together and I am incredibly grateful for what he does. I just feel lonely at the moment.

I'm alone all week, after work I'll have dinner, shower, maybe watch a film then go to bed. I'm usually asleep when he gets home so we don't see each other much right now.
I don't really like leaving the house due to anxiety, the furthest I'll go is the local shop which is approx 5 minutes. I find myself on my phone for hours, flick through the TV, snack and napping the day away which makes me feel unproductive. I'm a little lonely and bored also cannot concentrate on a book or something like colouring or sewing for too long, can't sit still for too long. I have no friends and the ones I have had drifted away.

I love being alone to listen to my music, deep clean and organise my house (love cleaning) etc, no-one can judge me or hear me being my silly self. 
On the other hand, sometimes being on my own gets me a little down. I think I'd like to do something with someone like coffee or breakfast, I think about making plans (have before) then backed out at the last minute because it's too much and I don't want to go out or socialise due to anxiety. 
I have gone out to break the cycle then instantly regretted it because I feel anxious and uncomfortable and rather be at home.

I'm torn between enjoying my own company and being cooped up in the house bored but then feeling down, or actually trying to get out and do things but then feeling anxious about being out and wanting to come home again.

How do I navigate this?
Thank you! ",1,1750634372.0,Advice,0,1.0,False
1li1lzy,https://www.reddit.com/r/PreCervicalCancer/comments/1li1lzy/cone_biopsy_recovery_questions/,Cone Biopsy Recovery questions,"I had my cone biopsy back on May 30th. It rupture 4 days post surgery and was hemorrhaging after taking a poop. I was admitted to the OR and they did a repair. I’ll be 3 weeks post surgery this coming Tuesday. I went back to work a week after with restriction since I work in a factory 10 hrs standing Monday through Thursday and sometimes Friday, that includes no heavy lifting, taking 5 minute breaks per hr, no bending or squatting. So my period is supposed to come this week, I was told it was gonna be delayed or having heavy bleeding and cramping.

So I started having mild cramping 3 days, then yesterday my cramping was still mild and getting a little bit stronger when I walk. I had the urge to poop when I sat down on the toilet I was having a hard time pooping but I’m not constipated. I started passing super soft stools, I wasn’t even pushing but my anus hurt a little. I’ve been pooping normal and drinking plenty of water and it’s soft. I don’t drink coffee nor coke. Just plain water. Been eating fruits and vegetables. Taking care of myself because I’m scared my incision is gonna rupture again. I want to add before I went the restroom, I felt like something lowering like is trying to come out but once I sat down on the toilet I felt it pushing back up (it was felt on my abdomen like my cervix). Got scared tbh.

So I called my OBYN  office with the following questions:

1- if my period is going to be delayed, how many days or weeks or months before I being to get worried because I’m scared I could have cervical stenosis. (Nurse said she didn’t know)

2- what was that feeling like something is coming down, it was felt on my abdomen and when I sat down it was literally pushed back up. (Nurse didn’t know)

Nurse said she would contact my dr since she’s out of office. She called me back 15 minutes later just saying that my Dr prescribed me 2 different antibiotics: Metronidazole and Amoxicillin. I don’t have discharge, no fever, nothing. Just the pain like cramping.

My question is, has anyone experienced any of this? They did told me if the pain gets worst to go to the ER. I do still have mild cramping but nothing too serious. I do get cramps before my period and I’m even having breakouts on my face. It’s just I’m almost 3 weeks post surgery and I have read the majority of the people has had gone through cone biopsy they’re feeling great after 2-3 weeks post surgery. I know everyone is different but I would love if someone would give me some information about maybe going through the same thing and if it’s going to go away. Did everything went back to normal after the 6 weeks mark? I’m scared.",1,1750634348.0,PreCervicalCancer,0,1.0,False

1li1l82,https://www.reddit.com/r/Cholesterol/comments/1li1l82/how_long_before_rechecking_labs/,How long before rechecking labs?,"LDL was high (140) on recent labwork.  


I’ve started tracking intake and have made diet changes since then.  The last month I’ve been averaging 7g sat fat and minimum of 35-40g a fiber a day (working on higher, slowly upping the psyllium). 


My doctor didn’t want to recheck until next year but that makes me uncomfortable. I’m looking into private testing options (which are quite limited, thanks Maryland) but wondering when I should plan on this. Is 6 weeks too soon to expect results?  I’m not expecting anything to have drastically changed yet , just want to see if things are going in the right direction (plus I had had coffee with cream right before the last labs since I wasn’t expecting to have them done same day- I know that solely isn’t a cause but I’m sure it didn’t help) 


I don’t think my diet was necessarily “bad” prior (no fast/fried food, no soda, limited alcohol, not a lot of artificial sweets/heavily processed foods, rare eating out) but was definitely higher in cheese than it needed to be 😂, and obviously needed fine tuning with regards to full fat vs reduced fat options


Dairy has drastically decreased and is mostly fat free or limited portions of reduced fat . Started filtering my daily coffee and switched from cream to almond milk. Started supplementing with psyllium.  Continued eating very little meat other than chicken/seafood and the occasional turkey bacon.   Less whole eggs, more egg whites (eggs are free so I was eating a lot of them for a while- yes I know dietary cholesterol is not the issue but I’m still tossing every other yolk now when I make an omelet). Started leaving the shredded coconut out of my trail mix and switched from coconut milk to almond. Lots of home grown veggies and fruits- I could eat my body weight in berries this time of year. Lots of oatmeal and quinoa and brown rice. Bought healthy popcorn instead of butter popcorn.  


I’m trying to get my diet to a point that is cholesterol friendly but also sustainable for me.   Daily food tracking is not sustainable  because my brain obsesses over it in an unhealthy way. There’s that part of me that wants sat fat to be 0 every day even though I know that’s not logical.  Same for sugars/carbs even though the bulk of them come from fruit and other healthy foods.  I need to know if what I’ve done so far is enough to make a difference because I can maintain this without daily tracking. 


So yeah.

In my area I've never seen a lime green car in person. The most you get is like silver, black, and white cars (lately I've been seeing so many red cars but I've been manifesting my SP and that's his favorite color). So I decided to test the law by affirming for a lime green car in my mind. 

For me personally, I did not say this out loud. I know sometimes our phones can spy on us and present us with what we said (one time I said I wanted to go to build-a-bear and got bombarded with those ads for weeks). So I affirmed this in my mind repeatedly and tried to be neutral about it,

The affirmation was simple, ""I see lime green cars all the time"" or some variation of it. I kinda did this sporadically, too

Today I was driving around aimlessly, and decided to pull up into a parking lot near the library I wanted to study in. I decided not to study in the end and was on call with my friends. My reception was awful in the parking spot I was in so I decided to try parking somewhere else to see if I get better reception

I continued talking with my friends, looked up, and my heart almost dropped out of my chest when I spot the lime green car I've been affirming for

This isn't the first time this has happened either. I once affirmed for my SP's car, had the sudden urge to get coffee, then pulled into the parking lot and ***there it was.*** His car is not common at all either! I've only ever seen two in my life (his car and this random person's car)

So I have an update and it’s welll I mean a lot happened. And no worries B has given me permission to share what happened. So yesterday I met up with my friend (the fiancé I’ll use B for him so I don’t have to keep clarifying lol) for some coffee and I just got straight to the point. I told him about how our night started and that we were all just chilling smoking and drinking like usual. Then I told him about hearing D (roommate) have sex with K (my other friend his fiancé). I said I thought I was tripping but when she came downstairs after we locked faces and she broke down. I told him she had to let him know what she did but then she got upset and said no she wouldn’t and that D would keep the secret too. His face dropped as I was telling him this and I could see his heart shattering it was so sad. I then showed him all the messages K has been sending me and how she threatened me if I were to tell him what happened. He opened up about how he has had suspicions with the two of them but he never had solid proof. He said that about 6 months ago they’ve gotten closer and he pressed K about how it made him uncomfortable how close she’s gotten with D. K reassured B that there’s nothing going on between her and D that and that D has a gf (he does not that was a lie)  you know the whole cliche bullshit. B took K’s word for it and never pressed again but he told me he has had this gut feeling for a while and me confirming it just devastated him but he said he was so happy I told him and confirmed his suspicions. We sat and talked about more personal stuff I don’t want to get into here but after we were done talking he told me he was going to breakup with her and move back with his parents for now. I told him that he can say I told him she’s gonna know it was me regardless. I didn’t hear from K for most of the day until the evening she started to blow my phone up with texts about how B left her and it’s all my fault. Telling me I should I watch my back and that she knows where I live. I didn’t respond at all because she’s just angry her actions were exposed. A few hours later she showed up at my apartment screaming for me to come out so she can kick my ass. I refused and told her through my ring camera that she could either leave or I’ll call the police. She started screaming at me how I’m a home wrecker and how I broke up a loving couple and how I’m jealous of her and B and how I always wanted B for myself. Which honestly is furthest from the truth. Unless B suddenly transitioned to a woman who was single, I have no interest. She finally stopped screaming after she didnt get what she came for and started to break down bawling on my porch. I told her through my ring camera “You need to leave you’re the one who caused this not me. I told you I would tell him if you didn’t and you didn’t so live with the consequences of your actions K. I told you to pursue B because I knew he liked you too and then you want to do all this? Go fuck yourself K if it’s not obvious the friendship is over. Call someone to get you otherwise I’m calling the cops to trespass you.” She started scream crying and I called her mom to come get her because as shitty as she’s acting I really don’t wanna call the cops on her. Luckily her mom came and got her within 10 minutes she definitely was kicking and screaming the whole time, but her mom laid into her and let her have it once they got into the car. I only know that because her mom was screaming so loud I could hear her from inside. Her mom texted me once they got home and apologized and promised that I would not be hearing from her daughter anymore. I told her thank you for her help and that I blocked K’s number but know that this situation does not affect our relationship (her mom is like a second mother to me I’m keeping an open line with her just at a distance) As far as B goes he went to confront D and D didn’t deny it. B punched him the face and ended up in a fight with D but no one called the cops because D just accepted he deserved it. So now as far as I know B is living with his parents again and K and D are still in that house doing whatever they want now.",8,1750633516.0,AmIOverreacting,5,1.0,False
