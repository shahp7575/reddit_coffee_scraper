1g87qcj,https://www.reddit.com/r/JUSTNOMIL/comments/1g87qcj/aftermath_of_row_with_mil/,Aftermath of row with MIL,"So since my row with my MIL I have not spoken to her or seen her. To make matters worse, her elderly mother is quite ill and has been in the hospital so as a result, naturally, my husband hasn’t discussed what happened with his parents. 

Today my husband popped round to see them and his dad brought it up and they ended up arguing as my husband of course had my back and his dad was defending his mum. My husband said he’s tired and mentally drained and doesn’t know what to do. I feel awful for him and it’s just a very awkward and uncomfortable position to be in. He said we’ll see them once a week and go out for a coffee where they can see the baby and see how it goes from there. 

Despite their disgusting and selfish behaviour,
My husband still wants a relationship with them as he is the most caring, loving and family orientated person I know. I’m not sure what I can say or do to comfort him while still standing my ground. No matter what happens, I’m not giving in and letting them get away with it, despite how upsetting it is for my husband. Unfortunately, I also have to protect my sanity and well being. I’ve tried to make suggestions without sounding pushy or angry, but there’s only so much I can say. The only thing I have told him is that she can only see the baby when my husband is there and we should reduce the visits to make her question her own behaviour. 

Anyone else been in the same position? ",2,1729454817.0,JUSTNOMIL,1,1.0,False

It's a niche product for people who buy many beans and have a prosumer coffee set up at home. 

One thing I'm really struggling with is getting downloads from my target audience - coffee sub reddits don't allow self promotion, I don't have the time to make a load of Tik Tok's in the hope of virality and I don't have the budget to run a paid campaign (which I think will tank my user retention anyways)

1g87p9v,https://www.reddit.com/r/crushcrush/comments/1g87p9v/my_crush_is_frustrating/,My crush is frustrating ,"Long story…. But hope you guys can help me understand? Would appreciate some advice. 

He is a work crush. I recently joined the dep and he’s from a different team same department. I see him every day. 

I fell for him HARD! When I seen him. After that I just stare intensely. 

I got the courage to ask him out. He said he was seeing someone else. I think he was in shock, because it was sudden. But now he knows I like him. 

Anyways I’ve been over a month now. I don’t feel like he is with that person or seeing anymore. 

He stares at me back too. Every day when he’s in the office as he sometimes wfh. He has also initiated conversation at the kitchen area with me Untill another colleague butted in…. However that day, he stood next to me, really close in my personal space. He could have moved to the other side of the kitchen unit, or moved away from me. But, it felt so amazing being so close to him, having this intense energy and connection without saying anything to eachother. I definitely know he feels it too. 

I get really shy and nervous around him, tripped up, slipped up, everything. We check eachother out, all the time. He cannot look away, now it’s become really intense…. I want to deepen our connection and idk how to do it, I want to get to know him better too. Make conversation but I get so shy. Because although he never said no to me, I can’t get the confidence to talk to him because it’s still a rejection. 

I am a confident person, very attractive, great fashion style and definitely not out of his league. Normally I would say I’m way better and can do better, but tbh our attraction and looks are on the same wavelength. If I look like Karen Gillian with black hair, he looks like Jamie dornan…. We’re both hot! But, 

I’m fustrated he won’t ask me out….he doesn’t avoid me. When you ask someone out and they realise you like them and they are not interested, they do everything to avoid you. 

He walks past me, he looks at me when he does. When I look at him he looks away, he looks at my screen to find out what music I’m playing, he whistles past me… he stares at me intensely and I do him to. We have awkwardly smiled at eachother. I teams messaged him, to use coffee from his cabinet and he goes it’s fine for me to use his. Then he smiled at me. It’s crazy how much I like him and how flustered I get around him. He’s annoying if he likes me back why won’t he act on it? Argh honestly guys need more fricking confidence! 

Do you guys think he likes me? ",1,1729454742.0,crushcrush,0,1.0,False

Quistis rubbed at her temples, trying very hard not to lose what remained of her temper. She’d known this was coming, or at least some version of it. She should’ve paid more attention to these two imbeciles and their plans.

This is exactly what she’d wanted to avoid when separating them.

Falor slammed his fists on the table with enough force that his mug spilled over and rolled to the edge. She caught it before it ended up in too many pieces on the floor.

“Have the two of you taken leave of your sanity?” he asked, voice riding that dangerous edge between anger and fury.

For the time being, he wasn’t yelling. Falor rarely yelled at his cell, no matter how angry he got. His tone, however… a man could shave off it. Rumi, taking the full brunt of his gaze, flinched back and closed her eyes tight. Air buzzed with illum.

Quistis hadn’t seen Falor quite this angry in a long time. Maybe even since Cinder’s raid on the vault. Maybe it was an improvement compared to his recent brooding.

“Two men treated for burns, burst eardrums, and blindness, and they got off with the best case scenario,” he went on, knuckles white on the tabletop as he leaned forward. “Look at me, Belli!”

His words cut through the air and Rumi stiffened to attention, eyes shooting open, mouth a thin white line.

“We got away with a best case scenario. Do you understand that?”

Quistis doubted that Rumi would be able to answer even if Falor gave her enough time to marshal her wits.

He went on, “In the worst case, our men would have hurt an innocent woman that you’ve spent all of Winter harassing. Moreover, she’s heir to a holding powerful enough to demand both of your heads on spikes.”

He pointed a perfectly steady finger at Rumi, “Don’t think my mother wouldn’t have granted them even yours in a jar, pickled in piss, to maintain her trade routes. I may even have sanctioned it myself.”

Rumi opened her mouth to speak but words didn’t make it out.

“Be silent.” Falor’s command cracked like thunder and the mind-skinner was frozen in place, statuesque in her pallor, her mouth half-opened.

Quistis couldn’t see even a twitch on her except for how her eyes widened in horror. She knew the Empress could puppet a man if she wanted. Falor wouldn’t be far behind, though he abhorred the very idea of it.

“You will leave the Aieni heir alone. That is a bloody order. Am I clearly understood on this?”

Aidan had been wise enough to hold his tongue through it all, likely the only thing that had spared him the same treatment as Rumi. He shot a look at his Claw and, the next moment, Rumi collapses to the floor, gasping, released from Falor’s grip.

“Am I clear?” the commander asked again, looming behind his desk, knuckles on the smooth wood.

“Yes, Commander. But—”

He cut her short, “I don’t need, nor care, to hear it. You’re dismissed. Get out of my sight.”

They slunk out of Falor’s office like whipped dogs, Aidan helping Rumi to her feet and away from the commander’s ire.

“A bit far,” Quistis said and immediately swallowed her words as Falor’s gaze swivelled in her direction with the slow, deliberate calm of a brewing storm. Jagged lines of blue-white lightning arched between his eyes and some stray locks of his hair.

Before he could tear into her own lapse regarding the issue, Barlo made his way into the office. “Laying it thick, Commander?” he asked with the joviality of one that had had time to enjoy his mug of coffee that morning. Quistis’s lay cold and forgotten on her desk. Falor’s was a puddle on the floor.

“Don’t give me the sparkly eyes. It ain’t that impressive if yer not holding yer hammer.”

That, finally, broke through Falor’s anger. He slumped back heavily in his chair and let out a slow, heavy breath. He ran a hand through unkempt hair and sparks danced and crackled on his skin as he did so.

“If that girl had the wit to piece together this little ploy against her, I have no doubt she’d be with Diogron right now. And what a wonderful calamity of indignant fury that would bring onto us.”

Barlo swayed a bit before making his way further in to stand at attention in front of the commander’s desk. He reeked of night booze. And sulphur for some reason. Quistis cracked open the window just to be on the safe side.

“The men cornered a pyromancer and walked away. Couldda been worse. Couldda had four corpses burnt black on our hands, and a few homes fer good measure.”

“They suspected the lady Aieni of being a planted fake and not a real pyromancer,” Quistis said. The two soldiers walking away unhurt had made their report regarding the orders they’ve had from Rumi. “I’ve heard of stupider things, but they mostly involved greased pigs.”

Falor ran a hand over his face and his anger seemed to bubble right back up. “What a lovely way of testing that hypothesis: ambush a woman in an alley like common thugs. Threaten her life. That worked lovely on Cinder once upon a time. Valen only burned for a tenday. Or was that two?” He reached for his mug and groped empty air. Quistis gestured to Barlo and handed hers over.

“I had high expectations of Rumi,” Falor groaned, accepting the mug. “Thought her time with us would’ve sanded off some of the edges she’s gained at my mother’s Court. More fool I.”

“Was a good assumption t' make.” Barlo failed in reading the room. Or he simply didn’t care. His comment surprised both Falor and Quistis.

“You’re taking their side?” Quistis asked.

“Just sayin’. An ash eater who didn’t blow her top off when the captain here accosted her? How many do ye know wi’h that sorta control?”

“I’d say the lady Aieni was quite near to setting me on fire,” Quistis said. “You weren’t there. It was Cinder’s attack that distracted all of us.”

“Fancy that. Convenient, eh?”

If he felt at all intimidated by the glare Falor threw his way, he didn’t show it. Moreover, Barlo kept his chin high enough that he seemed to be talking to the ceiling.

“Lighten up, commander. Bad judgement happens. We ain’t… waz da word? Pristine! We botched it up with that elendine.”

“Lovely. Another cock-up I desperately needed to revisit today,” Falor groaned. “What’s become of that one?”

“Nothing. And it’ll stay that way. Smith’s a pragmatic soul and won’t report our misadventure and…” He licked cracked lips. “Let’s call it *indiscretion* with the interview. Met’im fer a drink… or was it ten?”

“Are you hungover, Barlo?” Quistis asked, not quite believing the vanadal’s sanguine mood.

“Severely, captain. Petition for a purger?”

“None on hand. Suffer.”

“Aye, ma’am.” He nearly toppled over saluting.

Well, this final debacle should at least prove the final nail in the Aieni case’s coffin. Maybe she should’ve nipped it earlier, but she’d been busy and distracted with her other work.

“Don’t seem so happy over this, Quis.” Falor’s comment surprised her.

Her focus had slipped. She hadn’t meant to allow herself feel so righteously glad that Rumi had failed in such spectacular manner, enough so that Falor was picking up on it.

“I’m happy I won’t need to go and explain to the lady Tianna why our men had deemed fit to ambush her. Especially as I promised her we’ve curtailed our interest. I’m sure there’s not enough water in the inner sea to wash this blunder off us in her eyes.”

Falor sipped her coffee and leaned back in the chair, eyes half-open, anger dulled by the brew. She focused on the many other reports demanding their attention. Bad news coming up the Bistry. Still no word from the cadre sent to the Twins. New mage killers training going too slowly. All they’d have to show come Thaw would be a delayed schedule and no Cinder’s head on a spike.

“What’ve you learned from drinking with the smith?” Falor asked without looking at Barlo. His voice was low, almost calm now that he’d had a chance to relax and cool down.

“Good man. Knows a thing or several of the forge. Gave him a commission by the night’s end.”

“Demi?”

“Demi, aye. Aelir and human combination. Man’s nearly as large as I.”

Falor nodded and sipped some more of his coffee, “Rare to see a demi and an elend working together. Rarer still to have one partnering up with an elendine. Your thoughts?”

“Runaway thralls of an aelir’matar.” He sniffed loudly. “What the nose says.”

“Put that down somewhere, Quis.”

She already had, having pulled out the file on the two artisans. Little else of interest in there. They’d gotten some things out of Mertle Mergara, but either the girl was somehow particularly adept at circumventing the truth serum, or she was simply as dull as her answers hinted at. She hadn’t revealed anything of worth under questioning aside from some rather lurid details of her love life.

Anyway, nothing to worry their cells over and that was fine with her. As far as the Cinder case went, they were right back to having absolutely nothing aside from a disguised face and a stupid helmet. The wanted posters had only produced some reports of the man with the helmet seen at one point at the Sisters of Mercy, back in wither.

The Sisters had basically told them to bugger off when they’d asked…

“Lovely,” Falor seemed to read her mind. “Let’s see to the channeller we can actually get our hands on. I want that Crepuscular caught before they manage to score a kill.”

“We’ve got a pretty good idea of who they are,” Quistis said, swapping out the files. “At least a reasonable assumption for an identity.”

“Deidra Aratol, I know. Vial’s description pretty much sealed it. One major trouble sorceress leaves Valen and another moves right in. What’s next? Iliaya herself come back from the grave?” His mood turned oddly joyful. “I think I’d actually like that last one. Mother always spoke highly of the witch and her methods.”

He straightened and took pity on Barlo. The vanadal swayed while trying to remain at attention.

“Go and see where Rumi’s slunk off to. Grab her by the scruff of her neck and drag her to work. I want this issue contained before we’re made to look even more the fools.”

Deidra had been testing the Guard’s defences, if reports were accurate. Every hit expertly carried out against solitary targets, poking and prodding at positions around the Fortress that were weak or understaffed.

“At least she and Cinder aren’t working together.” Quistis yawned wide enough that her jaw popped. News of the nighttime attack on Tianna had roused her straight out of bed after an already short night. Whatever she’d enjoyed before going to sleep seemed a long distant memory.

“How do you figure that?” Falor finished her coffee, oblivious to the way she stared at the cup.

“They hate one another.” To his continued curious stare, she went on, “I read Rumi’s profile on Cinder. Deidra Aratol was one of her last hunts before she deserted. They had, on record, three bloody clashes between them. Cinder may have gone off the deep end, but she’s no revolutionary to die for the kind of cause Aratol champions.”

“True. Still, one must wonder at coincidences piling up.”

He picked up a pen and began absent-mindedly scribbling something on a fresh sheet of paper. Quistis listened to the morning sounds drifting in. Barlo had sauntered off to do as instructed and she could hear him in the yard, bellowing at recruits in the chill of morning. Hungover, he was even more ruthless than usual.

“I don’t mind her testing us, but I do mind what she normally brings anywhere she’s allowed to put down roots,” Falor said. His hands sketched on without himself seeming to pay attention to what he was doing. “Wherever she’s showed up in the past seasons, she’s sown disquiet and trouble. Civil unrest follows soon after. With Valen independent of the Empire, this might just be her passing through.” He drew a sharp line under some words on the paper. “I’m not willing to risk it. And I’m not willing to let her do as she pleases any longer.”

“I’m assuming the Cinder spectacle is why she’s showed up,” Quistis said. “Maybe she doesn’t want us maintaining that sort of momentum.”

“Likely. Cinder’s event made us seem weak and ill-prepared.” He held up a hand when she was going to protest. “It doesn’t matter that I drove her off. It matters that she was here, under our noses, staging an attack. For someone like Aratol, that would be enough to gauge our strength and readiness. Any more cock-ups like our recent efforts, and our standing with Valen’s council will begin deteriorating again. I want eyes on all of them. Diogron. Valenta. Kiboll. And the lower ones.” He circled another group written down. “See that we also have eyes on the major players of the Agora.”

“All of them? That’s stretching us paper-thin.”

“It is what it is.”

“Should I request more men?”

He shook his head and rolled his shoulders. There was a particularly fierce glint in his eyes. “No. I don’t want mother stepping in for this. I want Aratol for myself and my own questioning.”

Odd. His eyes had turned to the schematic, now fully intent on his planning. Something ate at him and, without the anger, the brooding was back. The lines on his face were arranged in sharp concentration and focus. He tried to drink from the mug and realised it was empty.

He still wasn’t ready to talk to her about what preyed on him, but she felt him getting closer. Cinder had said something to him. That much she knew from Barlo. The vanadal had seen Falor and her exchanging words, but hadn’t heard the specifics. It had been enough to keep the commander from killing the sorceress.

Maybe he regretted not taking the fatal swing before they got interrupted?

“It would be a good show of strength for us to apprehend Aratol,” she said. There was a bounty they’d posted some time back and it was due a refresh soon. “Lucian has her face plastered all across the inner court of the Guild, even after Cinder’s burned most of the postings.”

“Quite. I want that bounty rescinded.”

“What?” Her eyes widened. It was a direct order from the empress herself to offer any price demanded for this revolutionary’s head. “Why?”

“Because she’s playing games with us. We will play them right back at her. She prods us, shows her face, and mocks us. Mother’s bounty has given her all the impetuous posture she needs to weaken us. I won't have it.” He looked at her and grinned. “Tell Lucian to make a show out of changing the reward for her capture.”

“Into what?”

“Two chickens and a firm handshake from me.”

She choked trying to hold back laughter. “You can’t be serious?”

“Are chickens valuable here? I recall them fetching a good price in Drack. No, not chickens then.” He tapped his pen over his lip, leaving behind a splotch of ink he licked away. “One suckling piglet, two bags of grain, and a firm handshake. See to it in the morning.”

“That’s childish. Lucian won’t go for it.”

“Tell him that either he does as bid, or I send Rumi over to convince him. With Barlo in a bad mood.”

“You can’t be serious.” She was repeating herself but the whole idea was outlandish. It’d be the laughing stock of the Guil… Oh. “You want to insult her.”

“Of course. It’ll be fun. Either we annoy her into a mistake, which I very much doubt, or we soften the impact of her activity here. Either works for me. Go and see to it please.” He waggled her empty mug at her. “And send someone with some fresh coffee in here. I want to plan this out properly.”

What that meant, only he knew. Quistis decided not to prod and headed for her quarters. It was getting warmer out, but not enough to go bareheaded without a shawl. Or three pairs of socks. Seeing Lucian was on the lowest rung of her preferences for the day, but an order was an order, even to her.

She ascended the narrow staircase up to the little room she’d called home for… well, for too long now. Soon they would need to move away from Valen. The understanding between the empress and the council had been for the cell to be there for either ten years, or until the next time Cinder showed up for Falor to take her down properly. That had been accomplished.

Loose ends had been found and tied off.

Plans had been set into motion.

Their job in Valen was all but completed. She expected the order to move on to arrive any day now, even with Deidra making a nuisance of herself. Apprehending her wasn’t on their to do and she expected there would be need of their strength further down in the South. Falor would only seek to contain the damage the Crepuscular could do, but Quistis doubted he was serious about apprehending her.  


She needed coffee. The first pangs of a headache bloomed behind her eyes. Her calves protested the steep climb after her nighttime activities.

The key turned easily in the lock and she let herself into the darkened room, the drapes still drawn across the one window that overlooked Valen.

“You know I don’t like you sleeping in my bed,” she said, voice low. The door clicked shut.  


A yawn and some mumbled expletive answered her complaint.

“I’m making a sprite. Best close your eyes.”

She didn’t wait for confirmation before lighting up the room. Deidra had enough warning to roll over on her stomach and pull the pillow over her head.

“Really…” Quistis hissed. “You couldn’t have taken off your boots before climbing into my bloody bed? Were you raised in a barn?”",1,1729454512.0,HFY,2,1.0,False

I wouldn’t say I’m a massive fan of art/museums but would be up for ticking one or two off during the next couple of weeks if people would recommend any particular exhibitions. I’m also somewhat into the history of London, but wouldn’t say it’s a HUGE passion point…if that makes sense. 

I’m also not against going away for a night or two if there was a good reason to.

Hopefully that is enough to go on - any ideas welcome and thank you in advance! ",0,1729454303.0,london,0,0.25,False

Growing up, I really loved going to diners. I think it started with going to iHOP as a kid and getting a big stack of pancakes and smothering it in berry syrup. From there as a teen, we would hang out as late as we can in all-night diners ordering hasbrowns and coffee, waxing poetic about the universe until it approached our curfews. All of this is to say, there’s something about a café that speaks to me deep down, and that mix of budget friendly breakfast foods and friendly service is what brought me to today’s spot. 



Setting:

What I Had:

I had the Country Fried Steak & Eggs with a biscuit & gravy and scrambled eggs. Usually when I go to a diner for these reviews, I let me stomach decide what I want when I get there (whereas the other places I go to, I research the menu and plan ahead). So I was feeling a country fried steak when I got there. The Country Fried Steak had a good crust to it, the scrambled eggs weren’t over done, and the gravy was great. The side biscuit was doughy and lovely, and also paired well with the gravy. Meanwhile the hashbrowns were slightly disappointing as they were a little undercooked on the inside while still having a nice, crisp exterior. 



Would I Have It Again:

Yes. For the price, the meal was great. The food was satisfying for Americana Breakfast fare, service was fast for the restaurant being packed, and the waitstaff super friendly. And again, all for under $13 (before tax and tip), that’s a good deal these days.

We do intend to crate train him but when he gets older and bigger (golden retriever) we want him to have his crate and a small room to roam in whenever we are not home.

We moved the table to the kitchen for convenience reasons and don’t need tables in both rooms. We already have a pressure mounted baby gate in the doorway to keep our toddler out of the dining room.

1g87btc,https://www.reddit.com/r/weddingplanning/comments/1g87btc/post_wedding_blues_anxiety_self_criticism_have/,Post wedding blues / anxiety / self criticism have completely and unexpectedly rocked me.,"I had zero anxiety leading up to the wedding, zero anxiety on the day two days ago. 
I am suffering from nit picking and ruminating on the disasters from my wedding. My wedding was two days ago and I’m really struggling to stay present with my two year old son and husband and my mental health is really suffering. The post wedding blues has hit me like a train and put a spotlight on all my mental health difficulties (perfectionism, ocd, adhd tendencies) 
I had the best day but I’m struggling ruminating on what went wrong. 
I forgot to tell the bar staff where the clean glasses were and everyone was drinking out of the same dirty glasses all night. The clean ones were just sitting in boxes and I’m really struggling to shake the embarrassment and the fact that it was such a simple fix. I wish they would’ve asked me. I also forgot to tell the bar staff where the fresh drinkable ice was. I didn’t notice at the time because I was just elated but we were all just sipping on ice-less and too strong limoncello spritz’ leaving a couple of aunties on their asses.
We also ran out of champagne. Bit of a disaster on the bar front. Its completely heartbreaking when you spend so much time, blood sweat and tears for some things to not come to fruition.
Our hot coffee furnace didn’t work on the day of so we had to use a kettle causing a line up at the coffee bar - my mum was working on hitting the reset button during setup but I noticed the next day that she hadn’t tried it properly - I wish I just did it myself. 
It worked the next day after I hit the reset button underneath. 
Some of my closest friends up the back couldn’t hear our vows - I regret that the celebrant didn’t ask if the back could hear the mic. We also couldn’t hear our exit song - it was far too quiet so the vibes weren’t high as they could’ve been. 
We also asked for an unplugged wedding and lots of people didn’t hear the memo so there’s so many photos of us coming up on social media and there will be phones in our ceremony photos. We also couldn’t find our confetti for the ceremony. 
I held my bouquet up way too high from nerves. 
These are silly details that are keeping me awake at night and are drawing me from the reality that we are extremely lucky that we have people around us who
Love us enough to take photos of us and put on their socials. We had no major disasters. Weather was great. I loved my hair and makeup. 
I also that I’ve been so distracted by the wedding from my toddler. 
I regret not spending more time with or having more photos with my toddler. We had a babysitter (a friend of my SIL) for her to be with him at the wedding and I feel like a completely failed mother. I’m trying to be more kind to myself because being a fun present bride isn’t completely compatible to being a present mother to a 2 year old. On the other hand I feel that if we didn’t have the babysitter I would have regretted being pulled and distracted by my toddler. The wedding was also by a lake so having a babysitter was definitely a great call as we knew he always had sober eyes on him.
I was in tears this afternoon stuck in a box of anxiety not being able to cope with the taunt of the pressure and embarrassment of details not going to plan. I had a really horrible panic attack. I’m also riddled with guilt that we’ve exhausted my in laws as they did a lot to help. Being very self critical and not able to cope with the thoughts that all my guests think I’m a try hard loser. Why would I try to have a nice wedding when there would obviously be embarrassing mishaps. 
I called beyond blue (Australian mental health hotline) and they helped me work on a plan for these mental health issues that have been highlighted. Going to my GP in the morning as I can’t keep running on empty (haven’t been sleeping for the past month at all. A handful of hours a night) and my parenting is suffering. 
Weddings are frivolous and silly and there are insane things happening on the other side of the world but your reality is your reality. 
You are not alone in post wedding blues, reach out to a hotline for a plan if you don’t want to drag your loved ones in to the pain and grief you have about your day. ",1,1729453777.0,weddingplanning,0,1.0,False

Footage of Maxwrist riding Blood Mountain for reference since I do not ride with a camera. 

Overall great test run for the moto camping setup. This new dead body sized tailbag came in clutch. 

I was able to bring:
1 person tent (strapped to tailbag)
	Worked great. Still returned it to get my money back because it was Walmart brand and will probably be broken somehow by the time it's used for the second time. 
1 person inflatable sleeping pad 
1 camping blanket sucked. 
	Woke up freezing. Returned. 
1 camping chair
	It was a chair. 
Axe 
	Didn't get a change to use it. Wish I had. 
Mini camping stove. 
	Nothing like pulling up to the top of the mountain and already having a coffee ready by the time your buddy gets there. 
		2 freeze dried meals and a Subway sandwich
		4 instant coffees
		1 titanium cup. Why titanium? I dont really know. But it looks cool! 
Steam Deck. 
	Skyrim, in nature, while high, staring at the stars through a mesh roof tent was amazing.
THC distillate vape. 
	Never forget the essentials. Would have preferred flower but unfortunately the camp sites were fairly close. 

Tracer handled well with all of this strapped on the back. Even took an S1000rr around the outside. He was very bad.

When I confronted her, she confessed that a line was crossed. The coworker even asked if they would be together if circumstances were different, to which my fiancée didn’t respond but continued messaging until I confronted her. I asked when she would have ended this, but she didn’t have a clear answer. She claims nothing physical happened or would have ever happened. My fiancée claims it was just attention-seeking behavior and meant nothing, insisting she wants to be with me.

I'm in the market for an electric grinder to replace/supplement my 1Zpresso J Max. I really like the J Max and it's general flavor/body for the drinks I make but I'm honestly getting tired of grinding by hand. I drink 95% milk drinks with mostly medium roasts, I like more ""traditional"" chocolate/caramel/nutty flavors compared to your typical acidic Third Wave coffees. 

I figured this would be a good opportunity to try out flat burrs as opposed to the connical burrs on the J Max. I single dose now with RDT, but I wouldn't mind a GBW option to simplify workflow, but I'm fine with single dosing. I was looking at the DF54, but I'm also considering the DF64 if larger burrs and aftermarket options would make sense for milk drinks. I'm open to other options but want to stick to flat burrs, if anything just for something different.

It's been months and I still remember and dream about her sometimes. She ghosted me at some point and I;ve chased the same type of relationship but have never come close. We used to chat about anything and had so much in common.

I don't know how to describe it, but she had this pull to her that made me WANT to do things for her. We started vanilla but eventually she mentioned paying for something and I said something about getting it for her etc. She knew I was kinda submissive already, so she asked if I knew about findom and also said she just wants to use men. She told me how she was interested in it and has done it a little bit before and some stories she shared. She was never mean or direct about me buying her anything or getting her things. She was so good at dropping hints that she wanted something or just ""sweetly"" asking for it. Even though I'm a sub I just love taking care of someone.

Our relationship wasn't super sexual either. She would send me pics of the things I got, or non-nonchalantly send a pic of her wearing it. On top of that she was my type... she had curves to DIE for and I love thicker girls in general.

She knew just how to handle me and dropped the occasional ""good boy"" etc but never over used it. I know I'll never recreate it, and I imagine I need to find a vanilla relationship and drop the hints that I like doing that to someone new.

I was not especially impressed with the show; it seems like a standard workplace sitcom. 

But since it’s theoretically set in Knoxville, I looked for references to the city.

In short, there weren’t a lot. In fact, I’m not sure if it ever mentioned Knoxville directly, just Tennessee.

But what there was:

* Some UT Orange on the set, including a power T, what I’d guess was a stadium cup, and an extra in the background wearing an orange ball cap.
* Someone who will probably be a regular wearing what I thought was a Rule High T-shirt. He did not look old enough to be an alumnus of a school that closed in 1991.

Nothing in the opening credits to establish it as being in Knoxville, no shots of the Sunsphere or Neyland.

And there was at least one missed opportunity to establish a feel for Knoxville — there’s a reference to a fish caught in “Hillside Lake”. I can find lakes named Hillside in Kansas and New York, but I don’t think there are any near Knoxville. Sure, the characters involved might have traveled, but why not just say Norris or Fort Loudoun?

There’s also a joke about whiskey being “Tennessee coffee”, which is odd given that I’ve heard Jack Daniels called the Tennessee Tranquilizer. 

If you were hoping it would really feel like Knoxville, you’ll be disappointed, at least based on the first episode. It doesn’t even feel all that southern. On the other hand, if you were concerned it would spark a lot of people to move to Knoxville, that’s not a concern; I doubt it will last long enough for that to be a factor.

(In the interest of full disclosure, my spouse, who is not from Knoxville, enjoyed it.)",17,1729452978.0,Knoxville,1,1.0,False

It's raining again, but the forecast is saying this one's safe for humans and anyone not worried about their jackets being stained. Not that you have a choice, you have bills to pay. City buses stopped running in your neighborhood after the \*“event”\*, and you're pretty sure the auto-cabs are still being held for ransom by the anti-corpo “hacktivists” that took out the Night Owl coffee house last week.

You walk by three ads for a new kind of synth-blood that you're sure your vegan vampire friends are going to be excited for, at least until the next time they go to the O+ club and get the real thing; those fads never last long. Off in the distance, Mt. Rainier is still casting that eerie glow across the sky; like an Aurora Borealis, but the sinister sort that lowers everyone’s property value on that side of town. You're curious if the rumors about what lurks in the fog up there are true, but your buddy in the Division won't say anything besides “it's confidential” and “I didn't enlist to retrieve bodies”. Like most lycans, he's been on edge since the whole thing started but can’t describe the unnerving feeling the sight gives him now.

Maybe it's because you don't live in the swankier neighborhoods in the north end of town (where they hide their dirty laundry better), but you're seeing a lot more gang signs tagged on walls here. Not the usual sort, these are ugly ones. The violent gangs that like to follow supers down alleys, the garbage that the Division can't seem to scrub from Seattle's underbelly or root out their corpo sponsors. It's only a matter of time before they start noticing who you hang out with at the local bar, too, and you don’t have enough saved up to move..

Seattle has always been bleak. Maybe it's time for a change? What can \*you\* change?

[Silvercrest 1100w espresso machine/Silvercrest grinder],"I'm an absolute beginner, and I bought a low budget setup for myself from Lidl. Grinder was €10, machine was €80. I understand, therefore, it won't be the world's best setup.

I have a bag of Starbucks blonde espresso beans (prod date: 29/03/2024; best before: 22/11/2024) because that's my favourite from Starbucks itself. At first I was getting awful, think, sour shots. They had lovely crema, but tasted godawful and flowed way too quickly.

However, after reading the wiki, I made the grind finer,  found the right dose (18g), used a higher temp (90°c), and adjusted the output (60g espresso). The taste is much, much better, but now the flow is suuuper slow. It comes out in drips instead of a stream. I'm guessing it's too fine/too tamped down.

The result is a very black coffee with no crema whatsoever.

1g86xcl,https://www.reddit.com/r/multiplemyeloma/comments/1g86xcl/recent_asct_experience_looong/,Recent ASCT Experience (looong),"Hello,
I've been browsing and occasionally contributing to this sub this past year (under my main account) since I got diagnosed and I wanted to share my ASCT experience as I found other similar posts very helpful. This is a throwaway so I can include more details. As I finished writing this I realize this is super long, longer than I expected. I hope this helps other people get an idea of what to expect and hopefully y'all have a good ASCT experience without complications. You don't have to read all of this, I'll also be happy to answer any Qs :)

I'm 45M located in Dallas Metro. I'm not in the best of shape per se, slightly overweight in fact, but decently healthy other than MM. Diagnosed late last year and had an extended induction period due to issues with my insurance and revlimid. Decided to go through with ASCT in lieu of staying on maint. We harvested my stem cells in early sep. A few days before collection I was getting 3 shots of the growth factor drug daily. They stab your tummy, it actually is not that unpleasant. One round of apheresis got me enough for 3-4 ASCTs. 

I was admitted mid-sep. I went in with high spirits and a positive outlook. The facilities were kind of dated but generally I found them fine. The ward had 20 rooms in a circle (Good for walking) and had a common fridge/ freezer with free snacks and you could label and stash food in it. They also had coffee and a microwave there for common use. There were a couple of those recliner bikes available for patients to use as well. My room had a smaller mini-fridge, 42 inch TV with the speaker being in the remote tied to my bed. The bed truly sucked. It's a traditional hospital bed you can adjust all sorts of ways that don't help. I had 3 pillows. There was also a sleeper couch for a companion and an adjustable easy chair and one of those adjustable tables on wheels. The room also had a small desk area. The bathroom had a sink with a decent sized vanity for my brush and stuff and a shower with a chair which I fortunately never had to use. They cleaned the room daily and the Techs changed bed sheets daily. Although a couple of the weekend cleaning staff was kind of suspect and wouldn't fully clean the room, the weekday lady was a champ and she did everything thoroughly. Food was through room service. They had a surprisingly decent looking menu but the food itself was very mediocre (they screwed up french toast). A few days into my stay the nutritionist came and gave me the ""secret menu"" which included a very limited chic-fil-a option and some other snacks and drinks. Finally post transplant day they gave me the celebration menu which had fine dining fare like surf and turf which I could order from one time but never did. My taste-buds were screwed. Food took usually an hour to deliver, sometimes more.

Stuff I bought with me. I had my phone and laptop with a extension cable so I could move the laptop around and a book. You can bring a fireTV stick or Roku and stick it in the TV if you want. I did not. All my clothes were front button shirts, comfy flannel style that I could sleep in and then I had athletic pants and PJs, with elastic; easy off is important! They did not have laundry but being a local I was fortunate that my wife could take my clothes home and run the wash. We did not bring any snacks or food items, again being local we had a lot of flexibility. I also shaved my head prior to going in. They allowed me two adult visitors per day during my stay. People had to mask in my room and I had to mask if I went outside my room. Midway through my stay I got permission to have my kids visit. They let me outside the ward where there is a waiting room and I was able to see my kids via social distancing though. Otherwise mostly my wife visited daily and once in a while other family stopped by. The visits really helped me, especially near the end of my stay.

I started at Day -4, getting in around late afternoon. They hooked my up to the IV pole, through my tri-fusion line. This guy was stuck to me for the 3 weeks I was in. There was a routine to every day. Doctor visit in the morning, though the exact timings were variable. The doctor doesn't spend much time with you if any. The one I had for my first week was nice but the one I had for my last two weeks sucked and seemed interested only in entering the room to get the billing credit. Vitals were taken every 4 hours, including at night around midnight and 4am. They would usually happen within an hour of the appointed time. Blood draws nightly at midnight to track your blood counts and ANC. This made sleeping very difficult. Daily Showering was important. they gave me a special soap I was to use and fresh towels. They towels kinda sucked as they were smaller than your average bath towel and rough but I opted to use theirs instead of mine due to the laundry situation. If you don't feel up to showering you can use special wipes to clean your body but it is important to do it daily.

Day -3 and -2 were melphalan, bring out the heavy stuff woooo! They asked me when I wanted to schedule the melph and I opted for late morning before lunch. We started ice chewing 30 minutes before and kept it up till 30 minutes after. I was told it's less important to chew and more important to keep my mouth cold so I kept the ice in my mouth kinda sucking it. they also gave me popsicles which helped break up the monotony of the ice. A couple of times I had to go pee. I stuffed my mouth with a ton of ice and then ran to the bathroom with my pole in tow and then managed to run back out to get another spoonful in my mouth. Day -1 was a rest day. These were good times since I was still feeling good. 

Day 0 comes. I didn't have an option to schedule the transplant but they gave me a heads up on the timing. I got one bag of my stem cells pumped into me mid-morning. It took about an hour, hour and a half if I recall. I had a slight weird taste in my mouth but nothing major. Next couple of days I ""stunk""  I'm told although I didn't notice it much myself. Day +1, I noticed my tastebuds and appetite were definitely affected. The mediocre food was now tasteless and I didn't want to eat as much. I think it was a day or two later that nausea started to kick in. I had a buffet of drugs available to me and tried to stay ahead of it by asking for them. I only threw up twice my entire stay., a win. Diarrhea was an entirely different animal as you don't have drugs immediately available. I didn't have it too bad at first. Other than having to go a lot, it wasn't liquid. They need it to be liquid and if it is they will give you a had to collect a sample in so they can test for C-Diff before making imodium available. Once you get tested for c-diff, they don't have to do it for a whole week. I got to the point where I got imodium which gave me constipation. I got a stool softener and that lead to more rounds at the toilet. After that it wasn't too bad as I managed it. I will say bring or buy nice toilet paper. The stuff in the hospital is absolute paper crap. 

Other than the appetite and diarrhea I was doing OK till about day +5 when my WBC and ANC hit 0. Day +5 though 10 were the rough days when I stayed at 0. I had to force myself to shower and considered using the chg wipes instead. I stopped walking which until now i was managing a few rounds multiple times every day and spent most of the time sitting on the easy chair watching netflix. I didn't feel like doing much and there was this kind of brain fog so I barely touched my book from here out. Eating was tough. I was able to taste ""spicy"" but most of the hospital food was bland to begin with. I ate a lot of fruit loops and lays which still had flavor for me, stocking up on them when I ordered my meals. I also tried to drink one ensure a day as they wanted me to do the high-protein/ high calorie stuff. I basically found the most tolerable menu items and stuck with them daily. Despite not eating I actually gained weight due to the all the fluids they were pumping. I had to go pee a lot and it was a chore having to unplug the IV pole, go to the bath, come back, replug. The only other notable thing during this stretch was D+7 my hair started to fall. The staff offered to shave my head again (I had some hair by now) which I took them up on. Once it was gone it stayed off. I also shaved my stubble and after that it didn't come back.

By D+10 I was feeling better and looking forward to getting out of there soon. Appetite still sucked, nausea medicines were still needed but the tummy was much better with the poop situation. I was able to start walking again although much less than the first few days. Unfortunately I got fever. They did a blood draw from my arm and my tri-fusion line but the results took 48 hours. I had a rough D+11 due the fever but by D+12 felt good again except I'd get a fever in the afternoon and they would do the blood draw which needed 48 hours for the result. This went on for a few days. This was really frustrating because I felt OK despite the daily fever and the blood test results would come back negative but they would push my discharge date out due to the fever (and the fact it took 48 hours to test). This is where it got really frustrating having a bad doctor who didn't feel it important to spend time explaining what's going on. I had to ask the nurses for my results and it didn't make sense (to me) why they wanted to keep me if every test came back negative. I threw a mini-tantrum near the end asking the doctor about signing a paper to go home (Bad idea). He finally told me if I can get one day fever free he would discharge me. At that point I don't know if it was luck or resolve but I made it one day fever free and finally got let go the day after, 3 weeks in the hospital.

Looking back, I think I had a good ASCT experience. People suffer much worse. Near the end of my stay I found my neighbor was there 7 weeks due to suffering all sorts of complications. That really put my bitching about 3 weeks into perspective. My biggest issues aside from the medical were boredom, especially near the end when you don't feel like doing much. I passed the time watching TV and or netflix as I didn't have energy to do much till the last 2-3 days. As much as I bashed the doctor, the nurses were great. Some were beyond awesome, but generally they were  all good. Bless them because the American medical system would be total shit without them. Now I get to wait 3 months for my biopsy to see if this was all worth it.",3,1729452731.0,multiplemyeloma,2,1.0,False
1g86xbe,https://www.reddit.com/r/unpopularopinion/comments/1g86xbe/dogs_get_special_treatment_that_literally_no/,Dogs get special treatment that literally no other pets get and it needs to stop.,"*Before anyone says ANYTHING about service dogs, this post is NOT ABOUT SERVICE ANIMALS. I am specifically talking about PETS. And yes, your ""emotional support animal"" is also a pet. I'm not saying that they aren't important to you, but a dog that makes you happy is NOT the same as an allergy alert dog or seeing eye dog (etc) that has gone through tons of specialized training and medical regulation.*

I'm allergic to dogs and cats. Even though I prefer cats and I often actively seek them out despite my allergies, I have to deal with my dog allergies WAY more. Why? Because cat owners don't insist on bringing their cats into spaces designed for human beings. The only time I come into contact with cats is when I willingly enter someone's home where a cat lives, in which case I accept responsibility for exposing myself.  This doesn't happen very often because it's easy to avoid going to a home that I know is full of allergens. 

Dog owners, on the other hand, bring their dogs where they aren't supposed to be ALL THE TIME. I see dogs at the grocery store, in bookstores, at the mall, in Target, etc. I used to work in a cafe and people would bring their dogs in ALL the time, and they'd be standing right next to where we prepare food and drinks. Before that I worked in a bookstore, and we had a strict no-dog policy so I was allowed to tell people they had to leave their dogs outside. And they'd get MAD. Like they'd actually get angry at me when I said they couldn't bring their germ-covered walking destruction machine into a store full of delicate stacks of paper. 

I'm an independent artist and I sell at a lot of craft markets and conventions, and it's insane to me how many people bring their dogs. Now, when it's an outdoor market in a park or something, I totally get that. But I'm talking about indoor markets where there's very little space between the booths. People at these markets are often selling food products or very delicate pieces like glasswork. You've brought in a giant dog who won't stop barking and pulling on its leash. How is that a good idea? And what's craziest to me is that the dogs *clearly don't want to be there.* They're not having a good time in this crowded indoor space where they have to sit still while you browse! They want to be running around at the park or something! Why did you bring them? They hate it here!

It's not just that people bring their dogs to all of these non-dog spaces. It's how mad they get when you dare to suggest that they maybe leave their dogs at home or stick to places that are explicitly dog-friendly, like pet cafes or the dog park. If you say you're worried that the dogs will make a mess, they insist they won't (and then they often do). If you say you're allergic, they say you should just take allergy pills (anyone who takes those knows how ineffective they can be and how many side effects they have) or that YOU, a human person, should be the one staying home. If you comment about sanitation, they act offended, like you personally insulted their dog. I'm not saying your dog is unsanitary because I hate your dog, it's because dogs love to lick themselves and roll around in dirt and their own shit, which is fine when they're at your house or out at the park, but NOT fine when we're in a place that's preparing food! 

Dog owners frequently have no regard for people who want to avoid their dogs outside, either. When I see a dog approaching me, I will give it a wide berth. I have very valid reasons for this: I'm allergic, I've been bitten by dogs a bunch of times and I don't want to repeat it, and I just don't like it when dogs start pawing and barking at me. But people act like I'm crazy for not wanting to let their dog touch me. I get told things like ""It's okay, he's friendly!"" or ""He's a sweetheart, he won't bite!"" I don't care. I don't want your animal to touch me, and you should be okay with that. I'm not saying I hate all dogs and want them to die, I'm literally just expressing a personal boundary, and people won't respect it because *their* dog is clearly the exception to my rule, right? 

We don't give any other pets this treatment. For example, I love reptiles. I plan on getting a snake soon. And I know that many people don't like snakes and are even afraid of them. I'm totally fine with that. Can you imagine if I took my snake out while shopping? If I kept it wrapped around my shoulders while I went to Target? If I put it on a leash and let it slither up to people? If I responded to their screams of ""Get it away from me!"" with ""Don't worry, she's not venomous, she's a total sweetheart!"" People would treat me like I was insane. Rightfully so! 

Every time I say something like this I get accused of hating dogs. I DON'T HATE DOGS! I'm just sick and tired of dogs getting all these special privileges that we don't give to any other pets because ANIMALS SHOULDN'T BE GIVEN THOSE PRIVILEGES. I promise you, your dog isn't having fun when you make it wait in line with you at the cafe or sit by your side and bark for ages while you peruse the shelves in a tiny shop. If you want to spend time outside the home with your dog, there are so many dog friendly spaces. Leave your dog at home while you grab coffee to go and then go hang out in the park or something. 

When you get a pet, you are making the decision to be around an animal. Animals are messy, they might not respect your personal space, they're often loud, and sometimes they can hurt you (did you know that roughly 4.5 MILLION PEOPLE in the united states are attacked by dogs PER YEAR?). All of this is uncomfortable, and when you adopt a pet, you're saying okay to all of that. You're making the decision that all of that discomfort is worth it for you. And that's great! But you do NOT get to make that decision for other people who haven't agreed to all of that. This is how it should work for ALL pets. We don't force people to be around any other animal that they haven't agreed to be around but for some reason it's socially acceptable to force your dog on everyone around you. I don't hate dogs, I don't want to get rid of dogs, I don't want to make dogs illegal to own, I LITERALLY JUST want to hold dogs to the SAME STANDARD that we hold ALL OTHER PETS TO! 

And lastly I'd like to just remind people that dog allergies aren't rare. Roughly 20% of the population has them. Many of those people (including some of my family members) have allergies so severe they could have to go to the ER if exposed for too long, or have combination allergies and asthma, which can be extremely serious. Allergy pills don't always work well and often have very heavy side effects, and if you live in America, they can also get very expensive to stay stocked up on. And getting allergy shots is 1. A VERY lengthy process (like, several years), 2. A very unpleasant process, 3. Very expensive (if you live in the US), and 4. DOESN'T ALWAYS WORK. I've looked into doing it for my cat allergies and it is anything but a simple solution. So maybe consider all of these things before you come into my comments suggesting that 20% of the population ""just take benadryl"" or ""just take allergy shots"" instead of dog owners leaving their dogs at home when they go to fucking Starbucks.

I live in band merch, boots, used to have piercings but i've took most of them out, (i still have my smiley in) and i only have the one tattoo so if you want that super sleeved up guy you often find in the alternative scene, that isn't me.

Thought i'd post on here since i almost never use social media (I have less than 90 people on Facebook, and my Instagram is just a travel & concert dump), which isn't going to do me any favours when it comes to talking to women online.

I spend most of my time going to concerts, usually in London since i can get the train back to my hometown the same night, but occasionally go to Nottingham & Birmingham if it's convenient for me. I also do festivals every year, always say i'm going to do a European one like Hellfest or Wacken but never get round to sorting it.  
I'm quite adventurous, i solo travel every few months, and am currently learning to skydive, although i'm thinking about transferring to a Paragliding license instead.

I absolutely LOVE anything Japanese, and although i don't watch it, i've always wanted to get into anime, so if that's your kinda thing then i'd love to binge some series, i just don't have the patience to watch stuff alone.

I also read books. I'm that guy you will see sitting at a cozy coffee shop on his own with a classic Fantasy book getting dirty looks from all the 'normies' like 'oh why is that guy just chilling on his own' hahah.

I will absolutely spam you with gig posters saying 'OMG look at this tour', surprise you with tickets, and want to plan exciting days out, but also lazy days in where we just eat snacks and enjoy each other's company. If that sounds like your thing, send me a message!",1,1729452515.0,ForeverAloneDating,1,1.0,False

A few senior people, including my old boss, have said they disagreed with the decision years after the fact, which was kind of nice. It was really surprising since I was off work as I sustained a concussion in a non work related accident while traveling. 

 A male senior director who I didn't report to, but knew and would chat with from time to time reached out on LinkedIn saying he saw my Facebook profile and then asked me for coffee. He is late forties, to my knowledge married with kids. From his LinkedIn, it looks like he moved from the company to a new one. The conversation has been brief and we're supposed to meet for drinks tomorrow. I was thinking it may be related to a potential position in the new company, but I don't have a real understanding of why.

The only thing that jumps out at me is him rescheduling Tuesday coffee to Monday night drinks. We've tipped a few back before but never one on one, I was an analyst when I worked there. I don't directly get creepy vibes, but I think the lack of information has me a little confused. 


I don't feel unsafe going, and if he has me in mind for a role, that's great. If this isn't at all work related, it would be admittedly weird with the age (he's late forties) and seniority gaps.

Any insight on how to prepare? I've been educating myself on his current company, but there are no roles posted. I just can't get a read on it. The industry is oil and gas and my prior role was commodities trading. I've been the girl aggressively hit on by clients before (only in events where people get wasted) and I handled myself well. I can't help but notice the change, the discussion of a lawyer, and him mentioning he saw me on Facebook them went to LinkedIn to get in touch.

1g86mw9,https://www.reddit.com/r/CarsIndia/comments/1g86mw9/my_experience_with_spinny/,My experience with Spinny,"My exp with Spinny

We recently started hunting down a second car for the family which will be primarily used by my wife. Spinny was an easy option to search, so we decided to browse cars and go visit the Spinny hub on airport road, Bengaluru. 

Pros:
1. Super convenient to test drive multiple cars in a single location 
2. Lobby and waiting area were on par with showroom experience. There wasa designated car delivery space all decked up as well. They offered complimentary beverages like tea and coffee. There was even a vending machine for snacks. Impressive set up. 
3. Large space with around 250 odd cars in all shapes and sizes. The facility was so big that it had its own test driving track. 

Cons:
1. I was looking mostly for an hatchback. Preferably a petrol one. Budget is around 3-4 lakh. Every single car that was under this category was atleast 10-12 years old. 
2. Test drove 2 honda brios. Each of them had clutch issues. Every single panel was either misaligned, dinged, dented or repainted. 
3. There was over spray on all the cars I tested. They aren’t even trying to hide it. 
4. Then I drove an alto 800 and i10 from 2012. Same issue, extremely poor body panels. 
5. Last car I drove was an i10 grand automatic. Drove superbly but the car had interior issues. Aftermarket system which was horrible. The headlights were brown not even yellow. And every single panel was scratched and dinged. 🤦🏻‍♂️

The advisor got tired of my antics and said enough is enough. Didn’t give me another car to drive. He told me to come back on weekdays if I am interested in more. 

I went in with expectations to get better treatment than you local shady dealers but this wasn’t anything different:
1. Cars were pathetic
2. Each of the cars has suspiciously low mileage but none of them looked like it. 
3. Unrealistic prices. Ex: a 2012 brio was costing me 3.7 lakhs with almost all the panels dented or repainted. It made no sense. The i10 automatic was almost 5 lahks with little over 65k kms and 10 years old.

It’s been 4 years since then, and I’ve never felt better. That’s why I want to share the mistakes I made and what I would do differently if I had to quit smoking again.

The first thing I would do is educate myself more about cigarettes, tobacco, and nicotine. When we understand something better, it’s easier to fight against it. If I had known from the start how cigarettes affect the brain and body, I would have realized sooner that there’s no such thing as ""just one cigarette.""

This brings me to the second point: there’s no such thing as 'just one cigarette' or 'just one puff.**'** The moment we take that first puff, nicotine reaches the brain in about 10 seconds, triggering the release of dopamine, which makes us feel good. That’s what causes the addiction. If you quit smoking and then smoke again after a few days or months, you’re essentially resetting the whole process and the addiction returns.

The third thing I would do is ask for support from friends and family. I’d send a message to everyone I’m in regular contact with, telling them I’m quitting smoking and need their support because it’s important to me. I’d ask them not to give me a cigarette even if I ask, and if we go out, to try not to smoke around me, at least in the beginning. If that’s not something they can do, I’d want them to tell me so I could mentally prepare or postpone the meeting up until later.

Lastly, I’d have a plan in place for cravings. Almost everyone experiences cravings when they quit smoking—they don’t last long, usually just a few minutes. But if you’re not prepared for those few minutes, the craving can catch you off guard, and lighting a cigarette might seem like the only solution. For me, physical activity helped a lot,going to the gym, walking, or riding my bike. Drinking a glass of cold water, coffee, or tea also helped during those moments. There are plenty of things that can help you during a craving, and you probably know best what would work for you.

I hope this helps someone. If you have any questions, feel free to ask. Good luck!",2,1729451801.0,QuitSmokingJourney,0,1.0,False

So, hooman, how are you? Or if you have a pet, how's the pet? If you have work or assignments, I'm not really gonna ask how they are. Because I don't care. Anyways, I got over my assignments and I feel like a badass. Also if you don't like one word replies and your fingers have the strength to actually reply, then you deserve the best chocolate!

*here, chocolate mousse*
So what's something about you that's weird to other people? For me, I don't like eating with a big spoon, sushi or crabs. And I love rice. Although that's not weird, because most of us are foodies, right? 

I've met some fairly decent people (some) and I wanna know where the rest of them are hiding. Do we need to bribe you with food? Or money? LET OUT YOUR SECRETS OR I SHALL LURE WITH THE SMELL OF FOOD 

Also anyone into romance fiction books? I can't stop rereading the Storm and Silence series on Wattpad (if Mr Rikkard Ambrose rings a bell, you are automatically my bestie, NO QUESTIONS ASKED). I do imagine myself as the main character. Tf you mean the main character is tall, funny and good looking and I'm the side character?!

Also how do you survive a day of work or uni? I usually have songs and a million other things playing in my head

Hit it off quite well (slept together after the first date and a few times after that). At first she thought I was a player who would just wanted to bag her and move one. But I called back and a thing started. We did the classics: had her over for home made dinner, went to the cinema, drinks, etc.

Was a bit cautious at first because of past experiences. She felt it, we talked it over and decided to move forward. At the time, she was ""seduced"" as she would later say. Her intent was to enjoy the ride and allow herself to fall in love if it came to it. On my side, I was trying to be genuine and not play games, while also trying to tamp down my standoffish tendency (although it was still there).

Got a crush so I was checking in frequently while trying to give her space too. Responses were long but not unduly so, since we're both quite busy. Still I couldn't quite figure out what she wanted. So it got me angsty to the point where I could be quite myself with her. Then she started being unavailable. So I pushed for a date just so she would come out and say it was over. She did and ask for some space and proposed to get coffee to talk it over.

After some time it happened. And she basically said we connected on a physical and intellectual level but not in between. I observed that we did not go on enough dates to have that range of moments (5-6 dates total between July en September). She agreed. She also said she felt I was ""in the bag"" too soon and was deprived of that seduction phase. And finally she felt I was pushy with the messages.

The general conclusion I take from it is that a lot of miscommunication led to an unhappy result. Now that we both know almost everything, should I give it another go? This time I can be fully myself and she can too.",1,1729451708.0,dating_advice,4,1.0,False

*Inserts a song lyric because I wanted to talk about coffee and how I don't really like black coffee or the coffee that just tastes like milk*

So, hooman, how are you? Or if you have a pet, how's the pet? If you have work or assignments, I'm not really gonna ask how they are. Because I don't care. Anyways, I got over my assignments and I feel like a badass. Also if you don't like one word replies and your fingers have the strength to actually reply, then you deserve the best chocolate!

*here, chocolate mousse*
So what's something about you that's weird to other people? For me, I don't like eating with a big spoon, sushi or crabs. And I love rice. Although that's not weird, because most of us are foodies, right? 

I've met some fairly decent people (some) and I wanna know where the rest of them are hiding. Do we need to bribe you with food? Or money? LET OUT YOUR SECRETS OR I SHALL LURE WITH THE SMELL OF FOOD 

Also anyone into romance fiction books? I can't stop rereading the Storm and Silence series on Wattpad (if Mr Rikkard Ambrose rings a bell, you are automatically my bestie, NO QUESTIONS ASKED). I do imagine myself as the main character. Tf you mean the main character is tall, funny and good looking and I'm the side character?!

I have a degree in Construction Managment from a community college in Nashville, and have done Warehouse, foodservice and construction labor while I was in school and after graduation I found myself as Construction Cost Estimator for a construction company. I have been here for 3 years worked on a variety of commercial projects. The job is just fine, but sometimes I find myself wanting to be outside and in the field more. My day to day consists of driving to the same office everyday and staring at the screen 8-9 hours everyday. It is the typical 9-5 corporate schedule of emails, coffee and white collar humor and jargon. The work environment is pretty laid back. I am definitely not looking past all the positives. However I can't see myself doing this for the rest of my life. My currently salary is 65K a year, which is on the lower end, so a bump in salary would be great too. My Ideal work week would be 60% on the field 40% in the office, and getting to move around and meet different people, as well as physically being able to see and walk the construction projects. Instead of being locked in a room from sunrise to sunset. I do understand that there is stress and responsibility with the job, but rewarding and well paid.

Those who work, or have worked in this field, would you recommend it? why or why not?

“Humans have this strange beverage,” Trosk said, watching the human soldiers as they stirred something in steaming cups. “I think they call it coffee.”

The rest of his squad stood around, half-interested. Their eyes were on the battlefield ahead—a massive crater-filled wasteland under constant artillery fire.

Humans had been sitting with them in the trenches for hours, seemingly calm, sipping their drinks while everyone else was on edge.

""Why do they drink it before every major fight?"" grumbled Threx, adjusting the glowing straps of his armor. ""I don't understand them.""

""I think it makes them invincible,"" Trosk muttered, leaning in closer. “I’ve seen it. They drink that stuff, and suddenly they go berserk in battle, like they feel no pain.”

One of the humans overheard. A tall one with dirt on his face. He grinned as he downed the last of his cup, ""We don’t feel pain. It’s because we’ve got something extra in the tank."" He winked. ""You should try it.""

Trosk looked down at the muddy substance the human called coffee. The last thing he wanted was to ingest some bizarre human concoction, but curiosity was a powerful motivator.

After all, they were about to charge into a suicide mission.

The Kalirian forces, their shared enemy, were brutal, mechanical beings. No mercy, no hesitation. They didn’t leave survivors.

“Suit up,” the human sergeant commanded, and everyone snapped into action. Blades were strapped on, pulse rifles checked. Trosk could feel his nerves creeping in as the sounds of distant explosions and crackling energy weapons filled the air.

The plan was simple. Charge across the blasted no-man’s-land, punch a hole in the Kalirian defenses, and disable their shield generator. Simple, but suicidal.

“I can’t believe we're doing this,” Threx muttered as the trench doors started to creak open.

“We have to,” Trosk said, his voice tight. “Otherwise, none of us are leaving this planet alive.”

The humans lined up beside them, finishing their drinks. One of them, a giant named Davis, tossed his cup aside and cracked his neck. “Let’s give these metal bastards a good show.”

The doors burst open with a grinding groan, and the battlefield opened before them—a chaos of smoke, explosions, and screeching energy beams.

The Kalirians had entrenched themselves, their glowing red eyes visible even from the trench. Their weapons kept firing, their cold, emotionless forms moving like clockwork.

“Move!” The human sergeant shouted.

Trosk’s legs moved before his brain caught up. His pulse rifle clutched tightly in his hands, he sprinted into the hellish wasteland. Humans were already ahead of him, charging forward like they didn’t even notice the danger.

Davis was leading the pack, a wild grin on his face as he leapt over debris, dodging fire like it was second nature.

Behind him, other humans followed, shouting commands and jokes like they were on a casual stroll, not running into certain death.

Trosk’s squad followed close behind, less enthusiastic but equally determined. The first wave of Kalirian fire came down like a storm, ripping through the dirt, sending bodies flying.

Trosk dove behind a chunk of metal as an explosion rocked the ground. He peeked out, watching in disbelief as the humans continued their charge.

Davis, in particular, was like a force of nature. His rifle was blazing, dropping Kalirian soldiers with pinpoint accuracy. He moved with such energy, as if the battle was nothing more than a game to him.

“What the hell is in that coffee?” Threx yelled, dropping beside Trosk as energy beams sizzled past their heads.

Trosk could only shrug, eyes wide as Davis took down two more Kalirian soldiers without breaking a sweat.

They were halfway to the shield generator now, but the enemy was closing in. The Kalirians were advancing, their tall, sleek bodies glinting in the dull light, red eyes glowing with malicious intent.

“We're never gonna make it!” Threx shouted, panic rising in his voice.

“Shut up and keep moving!” Trosk yelled back, forcing himself to get up and run again.

His legs felt heavy, fear crawling up his spine. But then he saw Davis again, standing on top of a broken turret, firing with wild abandon, laughing like a madman.

Something clicked.

“Come on!” Trosk yelled, adrenaline taking over. He charged forward, his rifle blazing. His squad followed, desperate not to be left behind.

Ahead, the humans were already at the front line, smashing through the Kalirian defenses with a ferocity that was terrifying to behold.

Trosk ducked under a spray of gunfire, his mind racing. The shield generator was just ahead—a towering structure surrounded by mechanical sentries.

“We need to get to that thing!” the human sergeant yelled, pointing with his rifle.

“Yeah, no kidding!” Threx snapped back, but he was already moving, dodging and weaving between cover.

As they neared the generator, the fire from the Kalirians intensified. Energy beams crisscrossed the air, and explosions tore the ground apart. Bodies fell on both sides, but the humans pressed forward.

Trosk fired into the fray, his pulse rifle overheating in his hands. The shield generator loomed closer, but so did the enemy. Kalirian drones swarmed around it, their mechanical limbs clanking as they fired their weapons.

“We’ll never get through that!” Threx shouted, pointing at the wall of drones guarding the generator.

Davis, still grinning like a maniac, suddenly slammed a fist into Trosk’s shoulder. “Don’t worry, buddy. We’ve got this.”

And with that, he tossed aside his rifle, pulled a knife from his belt, and charged straight at the drones.

Trosk blinked, stunned by the audacity. ""Is he crazy?""

But it didn’t matter. Davis was already tearing through the drones with reckless abandon, his knife flashing as he ripped them apart piece by piece. The rest of the humans followed, guns blazing, knives slashing.

The aliens stood frozen for a moment, watching the carnage unfold.

“Let’s help them,” Trosk said, not sure whether he was insane or inspired.

With a roar, they charged in after the humans.

Trosk found himself shoulder to shoulder with Davis, who was grinning wildly as they slashed and fired their way through the wall of drones guarding the generator.

The air crackled with energy blasts, the ground shook beneath their feet, but the humans kept pushing, never slowing down. There was a strange rhythm to their movements, an almost reckless disregard for safety.

""You're insane, you know that?"" Trosk shouted, his pulse rifle spitting fire at an incoming drone.

Davis laughed, ducking under a swinging mechanical arm and jamming his knife into the drone's core. ""Just had my coffee, man!""

Trosk barely had time to register that absurd comment before the next wave of Kalirians came crashing down on them. The cold, lifeless eyes of the machines showed no fear, no hesitation. They were programmed to kill, nothing more.

But the humans fought like they had something to prove. And, somehow, that energy bled into Trosk and his squad.

They moved faster, fought harder. Threx was beside him now, his alien faces a mask of determined fury as he slashed through another drone.

“Why do we always get dragged into this?” Threx panted, firing a quick burst into the glowing red core of an Kalirian that had gotten too close.

“Because we’re still alive!” Trosk growled back, ducking under another blast and rolling behind a piece of debris. He raised his rifle and fired a shot that took out an Kalirian soldier’s head. It fell with a satisfying thud.

The shield generator loomed in front of them, its towering structure humming with energy. They were so close. But the Kalirians weren’t giving up the ground easily.

More drones appeared, marching out of the smoke, their guns lighting up the sky.

“We need to shut that thing down!” the human sergeant shouted from behind cover. “If that generator stays up, we’re all toast!”

Trosk knew he was right. The Kalirians’ shields were impenetrable as long as the generator was operational. They had to disable it, or this entire mission would be for nothing.

“Cover me!” Davis yelled, already moving before anyone could respond.

Trosk blinked in disbelief as the human barreled forward, dodging between blasts, a grenade in one hand. “He’s gonna get himself killed!” he shouted, rising to follow.

But before he could take more than a few steps, the sky above them exploded in a flash of light.

A beam of pure energy shot down from an Kalirian aerial platform, carving through the battlefield. The ground buckled, throwing Trosk off his feet.

He hit the dirt hard, the wind knocked out of him.

“Davis!” he coughed, struggling to get back up.

To his amazement, Davis was still on his feet, sprinting toward the generator like nothing had happened.

The rest of the humans followed suit, throwing themselves into the chaos with reckless abandon.

The Kalirians were firing everything they had, but it wasn’t enough to stop the human advance.

Trosk scrambled to his feet, his pulse rifle rattling in his grip as he fired at the drones swarming them. “We’re not gonna make it at this rate!”

The human sergeant pointed to the top of the generator, shouting over the din of battle. “We don’t need to make it. We just need to blow that thing to hell!”

Trosk’s squad was pinned down behind cover, the Kalirian fire too intense to break through. He glanced up at the generator.

It was huge, pulsing with energy that fed directly into the shields protecting the Kalirian base.

If they could get close enough to plant explosives, they could take it out. But the drones were everywhere, and the window was closing fast.

And then, once again, Davis did the unthinkable.

Without a word, he vaulted over the debris and sprinted headlong toward the generator, a grenade in each hand. Trosk swore under his breath, slamming his back against the cover. ""This guy’s going to get us all killed!"" he shouted at Threx.

Threx peeked out from behind the cover, his eyes wide. “I don’t think he cares! He’s already too far gone!”

The drones zeroed in on Davis, their weapons spitting hot energy. But the human moved like a man possessed, weaving through the fire with unnatural speed.

He made it to the base of the generator and threw both grenades with a wild grin. They arced through the air and landed squarely in a nest of cables that fed directly into the generator’s core.

“Get down!” someone screamed.

The explosion rocked the battlefield, a blinding flash of light and fire consuming the generator. The shockwave knocked Trosk and the others flat, the air filled with the sound of tearing metal and cracking energy.

When Trosk finally lifted his head, the generator was a smoldering wreck. The Kalirian shields flickered, then collapsed, leaving their base exposed.

But there was no time to celebrate. The explosion had drawn the attention of every Kalirian on the field. Drones swarmed toward them, their red eyes glowing with mechanical fury.

“Now we’ve done it,” Threx muttered, picking himself up. His pulse rifle was overheating, and the ammo was running low. “We’re dead, right? This is how we die?”

“Not if we get out of here first,” Trosk replied, yanking him to his feet.

“Fall back to the trenches!” the human sergeant shouted, firing his rifle as he moved. “We did what we came for. Let’s move before they surround us!”

Trosk nodded, already turning to run, but a hand grabbed his shoulder. He turned to see Davis, breathing hard, but grinning like he had just won the lottery. ""Good fight, huh?"" the human said, slapping Trosk on the back.

Trosk could only shake his head. “You’re insane.”

Davis just laughed and started running, waving for the others to follow. “Come on! Let’s get back and grab another cup of coffee before round two!”

The retreat was chaotic, with drones chasing them every step of the way. The humans led the charge, blasting their way through the remaining Kalirians. Trosk and his squad followed close behind, trying to keep up.

When they finally reached the relative safety of the trenches, the humans collapsed, laughing and shouting like they had just come back from a victory parade.

Trosk slumped down, breathing heavily, his limbs aching from the fight. He glanced over at Davis, who was already pulling out another pack of coffee grounds from his gear. “You’re seriously going to drink more of that stuff?”

Davis shrugged. “It’s what keeps us going, buddy.”

Trosk stared at the steaming cup for a moment, then sighed. Maybe, just maybe, he’d give it a try next time.

The Kalirians weren’t finished yet, but neither were the humans.

Trosk had never seen anything like it. The Kalirian forces were regrouping for what was clearly a last-ditch effort to wipe them out, but the humans? They were acting like this was just another day on the job.

Davis sipped his coffee like he wasn’t sitting in a trench on the verge of being overrun by mechanical death machines.

""What's the plan?"" Threx asked, slumping down beside Trosk, his eyes scanning the horizon where the Kalirians were forming up again. ""We can’t hold them off forever.""

Trosk looked over at the human sergeant, who was checking his gear, face calm but focused. ""We hit them before they hit us,"" the sergeant said flatly. ""Simple as that.""

Trosk blinked. “Hit them? They’re bringing everything they’ve got! We just blew up their shield generator!”

The sergeant gave him a hard look. “Exactly. We’ve rattled them. Now we push. We don’t give them time to regroup.”

Trosk exchanged a glance with Threx, who looked like he was trying not to panic. “That’s insane,” Threx muttered. “We should be retreating, not—”

Before he could finish, Davis stood up, his rifle slung over one shoulder, cup of coffee in the other hand. “It’s not insane. It’s how we win. They’re machines.

They can’t handle chaos like we can.” He grinned, taking a final gulp of his coffee and tossing the empty cup aside. “Besides, I haven’t had my daily quota of explosions yet.”

Trosk wasn’t sure whether to admire or be terrified of the human mindset. But there wasn’t time to argue.

The Kalirians were advancing, their lines tightening into perfect formation. They would be on top of them in minutes.

The humans moved with purpose. Weapons were reloaded, positions taken. Trosk and his squad followed suit, checking their rifles, readying grenades. The air was thick with tension.

""Why do I have a bad feeling about this?"" Threx muttered, his voice barely audible over the sound of distant marching.

""Because it’s probably a terrible idea,"" Trosk replied, gripping his rifle tighter. ""But it’s the only one we’ve got.""

The sergeant raised his hand. “Get ready.”

Trosk could hear the mechanical clanking of the Kalirian soldiers as they closed in. The sound alone made his skin crawl. There were so many of them, their red eyes glowing like distant stars in the gloom.

And then, with a shout, the humans charged.

Trosk’s brain barely had time to process what was happening before his legs moved on their own.

His pulse rifle rattled in his grip as he followed the humans into the open battlefield. Explosions rocked the ground, and energy blasts filled the air, the Kalirians opened fire.

Davis was already in the thick of it, laughing like a madman as he tore through the enemy lines, his rifle blazing.

Trosk fired at a drone that had broken off from the main formation, taking it down with a well-placed shot. The chaos was overwhelming, but somehow, the humans thrived in it.

“We need to break their formation!” the sergeant shouted; his voice barely audible over the roar of battle.

Trosk saw what he meant. The Kalirians moved in perfect synchronization, their mechanical bodies shifting like parts of a single machine. If they didn’t disrupt that, the humans would be overwhelmed.

“I’m going for their leader!” Davis shouted, pointing to a larger Kalirian at the center of the formation. It was taller than the others, its body gleaming with extra armor and weaponry. Clearly the commander.

“Are you serious?” Trosk yelled back. “That thing will tear you apart!”

Davis just grinned. “Not if I get there first.”

And then he was off, charging straight for the Kalirian commander without a second thought. Trosk swore under his breath and followed. Threx was right behind him, muttering curses in their native tongue.

The battlefield was pure chaos. Drones swarmed them from all sides, energy blasts cutting through the air.

Trosk fired wildly, trying to keep up with Davis as he cut a path through the enemy ranks. The closer they got to the commander, the more intense the fire became.

“Almost there!” Davis shouted, dodging a blast that vaporized the ground where he had just been standing.

The Kalirian commander turned its cold, red eyes on them, its weapons powering up with a low hum. It raised its arm, preparing to unleash a devastating attack.

“Move!” Trosk shouted, shoving Davis aside just as the blast came down. The ground exploded beneath them, sending both of them flying.

Trosk hit the dirt hard, his ears ringing. He looked up, dazed, to see the Kalirian commander advancing, its massive form blocking out the sky.

“We’re dead,” Threx muttered, crawling over to where Trosk had landed.

But Davis wasn’t done yet.

With a groan, he got to his feet, grabbing something from his belt. It was another grenade, this one bigger than the ones he had used before. ""You know what they say,"" he called over his shoulder, grinning. ""Go big or go home.""

And with that, he charged straight at the commander.

Trosk watched in disbelief as Davis sprinted toward the towering Kalirian, grenade in hand. The commander raised its arm to fire again, but Davis was too fast.

He leapt onto the machine, climbing up its armored frame with wild determination.

“What is he doing!?” Threx yelled, firing at a nearby drone.

Trosk didn’t answer. He couldn’t tear his eyes away from the spectacle. Davis had reached the commander’s head, clinging to the machine like a crazed animal.

With a wild laugh, he shoved the grenade into a gap in the armor, then jumped off just as the explosion rocked the battlefield.

The commander’s head exploded in a shower of sparks and metal, its body crumpling to the ground like a broken toy.

For a moment, everything stopped. The Kalirian formation faltered, their perfect synchronization shattered. The humans didn’t miss a beat. They pressed the advantage, cutting through the disoriented drones.

Trosk found himself standing over the wreckage of the Kalirian commander, breathing hard. The battlefield was littered with the smoking remains of drones, but the humans were still standing, battered but victorious.

Davis walked over, covered in dirt and debris, but grinning like he had just won a lottery. “Told you we’d get them.”

Trosk shook his head, still trying to wrap his mind around what had just happened. “You’re crazy. Completely insane.”

Davis shrugged. “Maybe. But we won, didn’t we?”

Trosk glanced around at the battlefield. The Kalirians were retreating, their forces broken. Somehow, against all odds, they had done it.

As the adrenaline began to wear off, Trosk slumped down onto a piece of wreckage, breathing hard. Davis sat down beside him, pulling out another pack of coffee grounds from his gear.

Trosk stared at him for a moment, then reached out and took the cup. “Alright,” he muttered, “let me try this stuff.”

Davis grinned and handed over the cup. “Welcome to the team, buddy.”

Trosk took a sip and immediately grimaced. It tasted awful. But as he looked out over the battlefield, at the retreating enemy and the victorious humans, he couldn’t help but think there might just be something to it after all.

The battle was over. For now.

And somewhere in the trenches, a new legend about humans and their strange, invincible coffee was just beginning to brew.

Davis laughed, ducking under a swinging mechanical arm and jamming his knife into the drone's core. ""Just had my coffee, man!""

Trosk barely had time to register that absurd comment before the next wave of Kalirians came crashing down on them. The cold, lifeless eyes of the machines showed no fear, no hesitation. They were programmed to kill, nothing more.

But the humans fought like they had something to prove. And, somehow, that energy bled into Trosk and his squad.

They moved faster, fought harder. Threx was beside him now, his alien faces a mask of determined fury as he slashed through another drone.

“Why do we always get dragged into this?” Threx panted, firing a quick burst into the glowing red core of an Kalirian that had gotten too close.

“Because we’re still alive!” Trosk growled back, ducking under another blast and rolling behind a piece of debris. He raised his rifle and fired a shot that took out an Kalirian soldier’s head. It fell with a satisfying thud.

The shield generator loomed in front of them, its towering structure humming with energy. They were so close. But the Kalirians weren’t giving up the ground easily.

More drones appeared, marching out of the smoke, their guns lighting up the sky.

“We need to shut that thing down!” the human sergeant shouted from behind cover. “If that generator stays up, we’re all toast!”

Trosk knew he was right. The Kalirians’ shields were impenetrable as long as the generator was operational. They had to disable it, or this entire mission would be for nothing.

“Cover me!” Davis yelled, already moving before anyone could respond.

Trosk blinked in disbelief as the human barreled forward, dodging between blasts, a grenade in one hand. “He’s gonna get himself killed!” he shouted, rising to follow.

But before he could take more than a few steps, the sky above them exploded in a flash of light.

A beam of pure energy shot down from an Kalirian aerial platform, carving through the battlefield. The ground buckled, throwing Trosk off his feet.

He hit the dirt hard, the wind knocked out of him.

“Davis!” he coughed, struggling to get back up.

To his amazement, Davis was still on his feet, sprinting toward the generator like nothing had happened.

The rest of the humans followed suit, throwing themselves into the chaos with reckless abandon.

The Kalirians were firing everything they had, but it wasn’t enough to stop the human advance.

Trosk scrambled to his feet, his pulse rifle rattling in his grip as he fired at the drones swarming them. “We’re not gonna make it at this rate!”

The human sergeant pointed to the top of the generator, shouting over the din of battle. “We don’t need to make it. We just need to blow that thing to hell!”

Trosk’s squad was pinned down behind cover, the Kalirian fire too intense to break through. He glanced up at the generator.

It was huge, pulsing with energy that fed directly into the shields protecting the Kalirian base.

If they could get close enough to plant explosives, they could take it out. But the drones were everywhere, and the window was closing fast.

And then, once again, Davis did the unthinkable.

Without a word, he vaulted over the debris and sprinted headlong toward the generator, a grenade in each hand. Trosk swore under his breath, slamming his back against the cover. ""This guy’s going to get us all killed!"" he shouted at Threx.

Threx peeked out from behind the cover, his eyes wide. “I don’t think he cares! He’s already too far gone!”

The drones zeroed in on Davis, their weapons spitting hot energy. But the human moved like a man possessed, weaving through the fire with unnatural speed.

He made it to the base of the generator and threw both grenades with a wild grin. They arced through the air and landed squarely in a nest of cables that fed directly into the generator’s core.

“Get down!” someone screamed.

The explosion rocked the battlefield, a blinding flash of light and fire consuming the generator. The shockwave knocked Trosk and the others flat, the air filled with the sound of tearing metal and cracking energy.

When Trosk finally lifted his head, the generator was a smoldering wreck. The Kalirian shields flickered, then collapsed, leaving their base exposed.

But there was no time to celebrate. The explosion had drawn the attention of every Kalirian on the field. Drones swarmed toward them, their red eyes glowing with mechanical fury.

“Now we’ve done it,” Threx muttered, picking himself up. His pulse rifle was overheating, and the ammo was running low. “We’re dead, right? This is how we die?”

“Not if we get out of here first,” Trosk replied, yanking him to his feet.

“Fall back to the trenches!” the human sergeant shouted, firing his rifle as he moved. “We did what we came for. Let’s move before they surround us!”

Trosk nodded, already turning to run, but a hand grabbed his shoulder. He turned to see Davis, breathing hard, but grinning like he had just won the lottery. ""Good fight, huh?"" the human said, slapping Trosk on the back.

Trosk could only shake his head. “You’re insane.”

Davis just laughed and started running, waving for the others to follow. “Come on! Let’s get back and grab another cup of coffee before round two!”

The retreat was chaotic, with drones chasing them every step of the way. The humans led the charge, blasting their way through the remaining Kalirians. Trosk and his squad followed close behind, trying to keep up.

When they finally reached the relative safety of the trenches, the humans collapsed, laughing and shouting like they had just come back from a victory parade.

Trosk slumped down, breathing heavily, his limbs aching from the fight. He glanced over at Davis, who was already pulling out another pack of coffee grounds from his gear. “You’re seriously going to drink more of that stuff?”

Davis shrugged. “It’s what keeps us going, buddy.”

Trosk stared at the steaming cup for a moment, then sighed. Maybe, just maybe, he’d give it a try next time.

The Kalirians weren’t finished yet, but neither were the humans.

Trosk had never seen anything like it. The Kalirian forces were regrouping for what was clearly a last-ditch effort to wipe them out, but the humans? They were acting like this was just another day on the job.

Davis sipped his coffee like he wasn’t sitting in a trench on the verge of being overrun by mechanical death machines.

""What's the plan?"" Threx asked, slumping down beside Trosk, his eyes scanning the horizon where the Kalirians were forming up again. ""We can’t hold them off forever.""

Trosk looked over at the human sergeant, who was checking his gear, face calm but focused. ""We hit them before they hit us,"" the sergeant said flatly. ""Simple as that.""

Trosk blinked. “Hit them? They’re bringing everything they’ve got! We just blew up their shield generator!”

The sergeant gave him a hard look. “Exactly. We’ve rattled them. Now we push. We don’t give them time to regroup.”

Trosk exchanged a glance with Threx, who looked like he was trying not to panic. “That’s insane,” Threx muttered. “We should be retreating, not—”

Before he could finish, Davis stood up, his rifle slung over one shoulder, cup of coffee in the other hand. “It’s not insane. It’s how we win. They’re machines.

They can’t handle chaos like we can.” He grinned, taking a final gulp of his coffee and tossing the empty cup aside. “Besides, I haven’t had my daily quota of explosions yet.”

Trosk wasn’t sure whether to admire or be terrified of the human mindset. But there wasn’t time to argue.

The Kalirians were advancing, their lines tightening into perfect formation. They would be on top of them in minutes.

The humans moved with purpose. Weapons were reloaded, positions taken. Trosk and his squad followed suit, checking their rifles, readying grenades. The air was thick with tension.

""Why do I have a bad feeling about this?"" Threx muttered, his voice barely audible over the sound of distant marching.

""Because it’s probably a terrible idea,"" Trosk replied, gripping his rifle tighter. ""But it’s the only one we’ve got.""

The sergeant raised his hand. “Get ready.”

Trosk could hear the mechanical clanking of the Kalirian soldiers as they closed in. The sound alone made his skin crawl. There were so many of them, their red eyes glowing like distant stars in the gloom.

And then, with a shout, the humans charged.

Trosk’s brain barely had time to process what was happening before his legs moved on their own.

His pulse rifle rattled in his grip as he followed the humans into the open battlefield. Explosions rocked the ground, and energy blasts filled the air, the Kalirians opened fire.

Davis was already in the thick of it, laughing like a madman as he tore through the enemy lines, his rifle blazing.

Trosk fired at a drone that had broken off from the main formation, taking it down with a well-placed shot. The chaos was overwhelming, but somehow, the humans thrived in it.

“We need to break their formation!” the sergeant shouted; his voice barely audible over the roar of battle.

Trosk saw what he meant. The Kalirians moved in perfect synchronization, their mechanical bodies shifting like parts of a single machine. If they didn’t disrupt that, the humans would be overwhelmed.

“I’m going for their leader!” Davis shouted, pointing to a larger Kalirian at the center of the formation. It was taller than the others, its body gleaming with extra armor and weaponry. Clearly the commander.

“Are you serious?” Trosk yelled back. “That thing will tear you apart!”

Davis just grinned. “Not if I get there first.”

And then he was off, charging straight for the Kalirian commander without a second thought. Trosk swore under his breath and followed. Threx was right behind him, muttering curses in their native tongue.

The battlefield was pure chaos. Drones swarmed them from all sides, energy blasts cutting through the air.

Trosk fired wildly, trying to keep up with Davis as he cut a path through the enemy ranks. The closer they got to the commander, the more intense the fire became.

“Almost there!” Davis shouted, dodging a blast that vaporized the ground where he had just been standing.

The Kalirian commander turned its cold, red eyes on them, its weapons powering up with a low hum. It raised its arm, preparing to unleash a devastating attack.

“Move!” Trosk shouted, shoving Davis aside just as the blast came down. The ground exploded beneath them, sending both of them flying.

Trosk hit the dirt hard, his ears ringing. He looked up, dazed, to see the Kalirian commander advancing, its massive form blocking out the sky.

“We’re dead,” Threx muttered, crawling over to where Trosk had landed.

But Davis wasn’t done yet.

With a groan, he got to his feet, grabbing something from his belt. It was another grenade, this one bigger than the ones he had used before. ""You know what they say,"" he called over his shoulder, grinning. ""Go big or go home.""

And with that, he charged straight at the commander.

Trosk watched in disbelief as Davis sprinted toward the towering Kalirian, grenade in hand. The commander raised its arm to fire again, but Davis was too fast.

He leapt onto the machine, climbing up its armored frame with wild determination.

“What is he doing!?” Threx yelled, firing at a nearby drone.

Trosk didn’t answer. He couldn’t tear his eyes away from the spectacle. Davis had reached the commander’s head, clinging to the machine like a crazed animal.

With a wild laugh, he shoved the grenade into a gap in the armor, then jumped off just as the explosion rocked the battlefield.

The commander’s head exploded in a shower of sparks and metal, its body crumpling to the ground like a broken toy.

For a moment, everything stopped. The Kalirian formation faltered, their perfect synchronization shattered. The humans didn’t miss a beat. They pressed the advantage, cutting through the disoriented drones.

Trosk found himself standing over the wreckage of the Kalirian commander, breathing hard. The battlefield was littered with the smoking remains of drones, but the humans were still standing, battered but victorious.

Davis walked over, covered in dirt and debris, but grinning like he had just won a lottery. “Told you we’d get them.”

Trosk shook his head, still trying to wrap his mind around what had just happened. “You’re crazy. Completely insane.”

Davis shrugged. “Maybe. But we won, didn’t we?”

Trosk glanced around at the battlefield. The Kalirians were retreating, their forces broken. Somehow, against all odds, they had done it.

As the adrenaline began to wear off, Trosk slumped down onto a piece of wreckage, breathing hard. Davis sat down beside him, pulling out another pack of coffee grounds from his gear.

Trosk stared at him for a moment, then reached out and took the cup. “Alright,” he muttered, “let me try this stuff.”

Davis grinned and handed over the cup. “Welcome to the team, buddy.”

Trosk took a sip and immediately grimaced. It tasted awful. But as he looked out over the battlefield, at the retreating enemy and the victorious humans, he couldn’t help but think there might just be something to it after all.

The battle was over. For now.

Spinny was an easy option to search, so we decided to browse cars and go visit the Spinny hub on airport road, Bengaluru. 

Pros:
1. Super convenient to test drive multiple cars in a single location 
2. Lobby and waiting area were on par with showroom experience. There wasa designated car delivery space all decked up as well. They offered complimentary beverages like tea and coffee. There was even a vending machine for snacks. Impressive set up. 
3. Large space with around 250 odd cars in all shapes and sizes. The facility was so big that it had its own test driving track. 

Cons:
1. I was looking mostly for an hatchback. Preferably a petrol one. Budget is around 3-4 lakh. Every single car that was under this category was atleast 10-12 years old. 
2. Test drove 2 honda brios. Each of them had clutch issues. Every single panel was either misaligned, dinged, dented or repainted. 
3. There was over spray on all the cars I tested. They aren’t even trying to hide it. 
4. Then I drove an alto 800 and i10 from 2012. Same issue, extremely poor body panels. 
5. Last car I drove was an i10 grand automatic. Drove superbly but the car had interior issues. Aftermarket system which was horrible. The headlights were brown not even yellow. And every single panel was scratched and dinged. 🤦🏻‍♂️

The advisor got tired of my antics and said enough is enough. Didn’t give me another car to drive. He told me to come back on weekdays if I am interested in more. 

I went in with expectations to get better treatment than you local shady dealers but this wasn’t anything different:
1. Cars were pathetic
2. Each of the cars has suspiciously low mileage but none of them looked like it. 
3. Unrealistic prices. Ex: a 2012 brio was costing me 3.7 lakhs with almost all the panels dented or repainted. It made no sense. The i10 automatic was almost 5 lahks with little over 65k kms and 10 years old.

This is a random coffee thought, and the city spends millions on accommodating wheelchairs.

The chair rightly is prescribed to address a mobility issue that the patient is having. It has wheels which handle mild inclines and flat surfaces. Hence it is a limited mobility device. 

It needs ramps, lifts, and other adaptations- which human rights dictate should be made. Entire industries are devoted to addressing the limitations of the chair. How is it this has not been disrupted?

1. Scored a SWU for outbound trip. Meal was delicious! Could pre-order - this was grilled chicken with a very tasty tomato sauce. Potatoes, beans, even the roll was great. Service excellent. On time.

2. No SWU for return (I was first in waitlist but it didn’t happen - probably bc it was a Saturday flight). But Admiral’s Club Terminal 4 was a surprise - not crowded, great food options, including avocado toast made to order with toppings like salmon, nice view out to planes and runways, good coffee. So stocked up and didn’t need food on plane. 

3. Both ways got the full can of Diet Coke (rarely happened when I was on Delta).

4. After drink service, flight attendant came back with cheese and fruit plate for me because I was EP. I knew this was supposed to happen, but doubted it actually wood. Ghirardelli chocolate square as well. Exactly what I needed to stave off the munchies.

5. Service was again excellent. Delayed by 30 minutes, pilot and purser apologetic about this.

Overall, great flight, and very happy I could use the SWU. Not sure if I’ll be able to use second, so still slightly on the fence about their utility, but on the way there, no $ upgrades, and fare for FC was almost $900 more, so would not have beee one I purchased.

Delta convert - still on the whole feel I’m getting a better deal so far with AA, even with the duct tape on floors, some not so great seats, and the occasional snappish FA. Would not have gotten upgrade or flight snack on Delta, service would have been the same at best, AA point value far, far better. ",0,1729451138.0,americanairlines,2,0.5,False
1g86aod,https://www.reddit.com/r/paris/comments/1g86aod/from_nyc_to_paris_imprdssions_and_thoughts/,From NYC to Paris - imprdssions and thoughts,"My partner and I live in Nyc and have both traveled extensively on 5 continents.  This was out first time in Paris and these are our first impressions.  

- compared to nyc, Paris has so little car traffic, it is so quiet! Huge difference. 

- in central areas, there are so many Americans, and they often speak 3x normal volume and say very crimge worthy things to local staff. Wow.  Demographically, tourists skew heavily towards retirees and valley girl fashionistas.  If Parisians are rude, I completely understand.

- But quite contrary, there is a higher level of courtesy and decorum here than in a big usa city.  We stayed in various airbnbs in several parts of town, do not speak any French, and everyone we encountered was very well mannered.  From little things like saying hello in hallways, or excuse me while walking by, to going out of their way to help explain or translate. Nyc is definately harsher and rougher. 

- I expected Paris to be an international first class city, but I was still surprised by the world restaurant scene.  I was also surprised that we mostly heard French spoken, even in immigrant neighborhoods. I presume most of the immigration is francophone world, but still... Aside from some Arabic, mostly we heard French. 

- bakeries are excellent. I will say that the best croissants I had are from top bakeries in trendy Brooklyn though... at 3x the price. 

- people told me that France doesn't know good coffee and this is somewhat true.  The good coffee specialy shops in Paris are excellent.  The staff is trained well and my cappuccinos and lattes were great.  In nyc, a lot of coffee shops hire randoms who can't steam milk and result is bad, depending on who is behind the counter at the moment.  In Paris, there is consistency. I always enjoyed my purchase in Paris.  In nyc, it is very hit or miss.  

- Restaurant rating inflation - a lot of mediocre restaurants are 4.5 stars on google.  Maybe fake reviews, maybe retired tourist inflation.  Worse yet, the high rated places are full of Americans killing any semblance of French vibe and often staffed with the worst waiters - who having done nothing after taking and bringing the plates - do remember to hit you up for tips.  Imo, it is better to avoid centrer city high rated French restaurants.  Thefork is more honest than google.  Other cuisines are better.  Bakeries are the worst - you see a 4.8 bakery on google and you see a giant line of Americans lining up outside and the deserts are overpriced and not any different from more local bakeries.

- Fuel is expensive and traffic is very slow compared to nyc driving.  Fuel is 3x the price compared to nyc. It makes me think that Paris is ""progressing"" into a developing country economics: the rich drive their cars and the rest bicycle/scooter/bus.  

- Most of our airbnbs were wonderful inside but common spaces were often very poorly maintained.  Is this why annual maintenance fees on Parisian apartments are so tiny compared to NYC?  Given same price apartment, nyc fees are about 1500-2000$/month.  In Paris, it is closer to 3-5k per YEAR.  Just eyeballing RE listings here...

Overall, reminiscent to nyc in a lot of ways; lively, diverse, good food scene, safer, cleaner.  ",1,1729451105.0,paris,0,1.0,False

So, for backstory, me and a buddy were in discord VC earlier today and started talking stupid car builds. We came up with like 35 or something like that.

Hours later, I saw something about an '84 El Camino. I hit him up and said ""how do we ruin this?""

We came up with a quad-50mm turbo procharged Chevy 632 big block, a Tremec T56, and a Chevy 12-bolt rear diff.

Now, obviously, neither of us have the money to do this. It's all theoretical at the moment. Would this work? Would probably have to lift the vehicle a bit to fit the engine and driveline, and fab a new frame.

My question is, with this vehicle, would we need to stretch it at all to fit the engine? I think the bay can fit a 454, not sure about a 632. There would be a metric ton of fab work involved, and it would probably blow up on start, but we were wondering if it could be a legitimate build given the time and money. This was the culmination of 2 travel mugs of Deathwish dark coffee, and no sleep last night. I'd really like to know if this is even remotely possible, want to figure out ant and all modifications necessary to make this thing a reality. Yes, we would be bastardizing a decent '84 El Camino. But, it would be fucking awesome to see rolling down the street.

Is it possible? What chassis mods would be necessary? Thanks!",1,1729451087.0,askcarguys,0,1.0,False

In the large, vibrant tent filled with the sounds of traditional elvish music, Lethira sat at a sturdy wooden table beside her mother Liriana, sister Lemiora, and nephew Lathen. Around them, the tent buzzed with laughter and conversation. Luridar and Ghorak were across the room, deeply engaged with other officials, while Lunira was nowhere to be seen, having disappeared earlier. A group of musicians played softly in the background, and the aroma of fine food and wine filled the air.

Lethira swirled her wine cup, her gaze briefly scanning the tent. She leaned forward, lowering her voice in curiosity. “So, what have I missed? It's been years.”

Lemiora’s face lit up with pride as she turned to Lathen. “Well, our dear Lathen here has gotten married—and soon to be a father!”

Lethira raised an eyebrow in surprise, grinning as she turned to her nephew. “Is that so? Congratulations! When did this all happen? And when’s the baby due?”

Lathen beamed with excitement. “The baby is due in two months. I met Laerinna, my wife, seven years ago. She was a healer in the training barracks, and we started dating five years ago. We only got married five months ago—sooner than we planned because, well... the baby was a bit of a surprise. But I'm happier than I could have imagined. I wish you could meet her.”

Lethira chuckled warmly. “I’m sure I’ll get the chance soon. I’ll have to congratulate her in person.” She paused, then glanced around before asking carefully, “And what about Lunira? Has she... been with anyone?”

Both Lemiora and Liriana let out a long sigh, exchanging exasperated glances.

“Lunira has rejected *every* suitor,” Lemiora said, shaking her head. “Both men and women, for all sorts of ridiculous reasons. One had a laugh that was 'too sharp,' another had a nose she didn’t like... and one was apparently too perfect, which she found suspicious.” She threw up her hands.

Liriana chimed in. “It’s been years of this. We’ve tried everything.”

Lethira took a large gulp of her wine, feeling the creeping guilt gnaw at her. She had a pretty good idea of why Lunira had been so stubborn, and that knowledge weighed heavily on her.

“I fear she’ll die a chaste maiden at this rate,” Lemiora added with a smirk.

Lethira, mid-sip, almost choked on her wine. She coughed, setting the cup down quickly. “She—what?”

Lemiora waved a hand dismissively. “You know what I mean.”

To steer the conversation away from Lunira’s love life, Lethira cleared her throat and leaned forward. “So... where's the Emperor? I thought an occasion like would call for his appearance.”

Liriana’s expression darkened slightly, her tone softening with a sigh. “The previous emperor, Aelionas, passed away 13 years ago. Heart failure supposedly”

Lethira’s face faltered in shock. “Aelionas is dead? He wasn’t even that old... only in his 320s. That’s... unusual.”

The others nodded in agreement, sharing the same somber confusion. Lemiora cast a glance at Liriana before grimly adding, “Yes. And you might want to brace yourself... the new emperor is Solvethir.”

Lethira blinked, her face blank for a moment. “Wait. What?”

“Solvethir,” Lemiora repeated, her tone weighed with warning.

Lethira was silent for a moment, the disbelief slowly giving way to rising anger. “Solvethir?! That arrogant, punchable, self centered, slimy idiotic fuck?!” She hissed, her voice thick with expletives. “How in all the fucks did someone like him get chosen by the Imperial electors!?”

Liriana placed a calming hand on Lethira’s arm, though her own expression was troubled. “It was a shock to all of us. Of the 100 electors, 54 voted in his favor. Luridar was among those who voted against him, of course. In hindsight some of us think the process to get him on the throne began long before you left for the human realm. Several of the electors died in suspicious ways and were replaced by more hardline zealots from their family. Many suspect that his father orchestrated his rise to power.”

Lathen raised an eyebrow “You knew him?”

“I had to work with him during the campaign against the Wolfkin, he was the Theater Comander and the reason why it was such a bloody cluster fuck.” She sighed frustrated. ""Of course he wouldn't want to be part of an event were he isn't the center of attention""

“And now we’re stuck with him,” Lemiora added darkly. “Solvethir and his allies in the senate have rolled back the civic protections for non-elves in many parts of the empire. Only families like ours have kept those protections intact in our lands.”

Lethira sighed deeply, burying her face in her hands. “This is a disaster.”

Lathen, who had remained silent for most of the conversation, spoke up. “The Hardliners are pushing for the Imperial Prophecy to be fulfilled. They’ve already committed one-tenth of the Imperial army for the invasion of the human realm. They’re camped a league south of the portal.”

Lethira’s eyes widened in shock. “That’s... that’s around two million soldiers.”

Lemiora nodded. “And they’re the most experienced and effective troops the empire has, from all races and across the eight realms.”

“It includes two thousand waiverns, seven behemoths and three adult dragons” Lathen added.

Lethira wordlessly took another long gulp of her wine, the weight of the situation crashing down on her as the music continued to play in the background, at odds with the gravity of their conversation.

As the lively music continued to fill the tent, Lethira felt a familiar presence approaching the table. Without looking up, she smirked, sensing who it was.

“Well, well, look who finally decided to come back,” teased a voice, full of warmth and familiarity.

Lethira turned her head to see Colonel Nalira standing there with her arms crossed, her navy-blue eyes gleaming with amusement. Nalira, the half-orc, half-elven warrior, had been a trusted friend and comrade through countless battles. Her green skin and distinctive twin pigtails were unmistakable, and she carried herself with the relaxed confidence of someone who had seen it all.

“Colonel Nalira,” Lethira said, standing and giving her friend a firm embrace. “It’s good to see you. Still getting into trouble, I see.”

“Oh, you know me,” Nalira said with a wink. “Trouble just follows me.”

Standing just behind Nalira was another familiar face—Velira, a Junior Shadow Blade. She was younger than Lethira. With her slim but athletic frame, dark brown skin, and her black hair tied in a side ponytail, she moved with the relaxed confidence of the empire’s elite forces.

Velira stepped forward, nodding respectfully. “Master Blade Lethira Sylvanor, it’s an honor. I’ve heard many stories about your exploits in the Shadow Blades. Some of us look up to you as a legend.”

Lethira chuckled lightly. “A legend, huh? I hope it’s not just the *good* stories floating around.”

Velira’s lips twitched in a barely suppressed smile. “All of them are impressive.”

Behind Velira, the third woman approached with a soft smile. The elven scholar carried a notebook, her soft green eyes full of curiosity. She was dressed in elegant, scholarly robes, and her glasses added to her studious appearance. Her flowing blonde hair was tied into side tails, giving her a calm, intellectual demeanor. She introduced herself with a polite bow.

“And I’m Virionna Willowsong, a Culturalist. I’ve been *dying* to meet you, Blade Master,” she said, her voice carrying the kind of excitement only scholars possessed. “I can’t wait to hear about the human realm and how their society has developed without access to the magic ether.”

Lethira smiled and gestured for them all to join the table. The group settled in, and Virionna wasted no time, leaning in with genuine curiosity.

“I have to ask,” she said, her eyes sparkling with wonder. “Do you happen to know the density of the magic ether in the human realm? It must be fascinating, seeing how they’ve adapted to live without it.”

Lethira thought for a moment, recalling the measurements she had painstakingly taken during her mission. “According to the instruments I brought with me, the ether density in the human realm is... approximately 0.00000035 times that of the Prime Realm.”

The table went quiet as the weight of her words sank in. Nalira and Velira exchanged wide-eyed glances, and even Lethira’s mother, Liriana, raised her eyebrows in surprise.

“That’s... practically a vacuum,” Liriana commented, her voice tinged with disbelief.

Lethira nodded. “It took me months to gather enough ether just to do *this*.” She raised her hand and, with a flick of her fingers, a small arc of electricity sparked between them. The current was brighter and stronger than she had expected, causing her to blink in mild surprise. But she said nothing, and neither did anyone else.

Virionna watched the display with a mixture of awe and curiosity. “Incredible. But how do humans manage without magic?”

Lethira leaned back in her chair, taking another sip of her wine. “They manage. They’ve built an entire world that functions without it, relying on their technology and ingenuity. I’ll go into more detail tomorrow during the presentation.”

Before anyone could ask more, Velira, her mischievous grin returning, leaned forward, her voice lowering into a conspiratorial tone. “I think we’re missing the most important question here, though.”

Lethira raised an eyebrow, intrigued. “And what’s that?”

Velira grinned, clearly enjoying herself. “What are human men like?”

At that, the entire table erupted into laughter. Nalira let out a snort, while even Liriana couldn’t help but smile, shaking her head at the boldness of the question. Lathen, looking uncomfortable and sensing where the conversation was heading, stood up abruptly.

“Well, I’ll leave you all to it,” Lathen said, chuckling nervously. “I think that’s my cue. Enjoy the rest of the night, ladies.”

He gave a polite bow before making his exit, disappearing into the crowd as the women continued to laugh.

Lethira smirked, setting her cup down as she prepared to answer. “Human men come in all shapes and sizes, just like elven men—or orcish men, for that matter. But...” she leaned in slightly, her voice taking on a playful tone, “they do have their own unique charm.”

The group leaned in, intrigued, as Lethira began to describe the various types of human men she had encountered during her time in the human realm. Their laughter and banter continued as the night wore on, the music and atmosphere blending into a scene of camaraderie and shared stories.

—

Lunira wandered aimlessly through the cool night air, her heart heavy and her thoughts a jumble. The goblet in her hand, once full of celebratory wine, was now half empty, though its sweet taste did little to soothe her growing bitterness. For twenty years, she had imagined this day—Lethira’s return to the Prime Realm. But those dreams had been crushed by the news that Lethira had a daughter, and that meant she had been with a man. The jealousy gnawed at her, though she knew in her heart that she had no right to it.

Lethira had never made her any promises, nor had they defined what they were. Lunira had given her maidenhood willingly, and though their parting had left a void, it had been filled with hope. Hope that had now been dashed. She had rejected every suitor who came for her, though in truth, she would have refused the men regardless. It was the women—some truly beautiful and alluring—who made her hesitations feel like betrayal. But she couldn’t move past the image of Lethira, the one she had clung to for two decades.

The jealousy continued to bubble inside her as she found herself standing before the Rivian, the strange vehicle Lethira and Lina had arrived in from the human realm. It was parked on the wide, ancient platform that held the portal, a square expanse made of an unknown indestructible black rock that could not be damaged by pickaxe, magic spell or even dragon fire, with intricate designs etched into its surface. The platform was enormous, around 130 steps on each side, and its origins were shrouded in mystery. No one knew who had created the Portals between the Prime Realm and the other eight, not even the dragons, who claimed the platform had existed long before their oldest memories. Many believe that the gods themselves had left them behind, which is the official stance of the Ecclesiarchy, though no one truly understood how it worked. They only knew how to open and close the portals they housed.

Lunira drank the last of her wine in one swift motion and tossed the goblet carelessly over her shoulder. The clatter of metal on stone barely registered as she approached the Rivian, her brow furrowed in curiosity and frustration. There were no beasts of burden tied to the front, no reins, no signs that something physical had pulled it to the platform. And yet, here it was, a construct from a world with little to no magic, yet seemingly functional.

She placed her hand against the vehicle’s smooth exterior, her fingers running over the cold, hard surface. It felt almost unnatural to her, like some fusion of metal and something else, though she couldn’t quite place it. She expected to feel a hum of energy, some faint echo of magic, but there was nothing. It was as though the Rivian existed in complete separation from everything she knew—an anomaly in a world where magic touched all things.

“What are you...?” she muttered to herself, her voice barely above a whisper as she began to circle the vehicle.

It was sleek, with sharp lines and a rounded frame, its color a bright blue making it stand out from the environment. Her fingers traced along its edges as she circled to the front, where a smooth, clear surface greeted her. She leaned in, peering through the clear glass window and catching a glimpse of the interior. The seats were unlike anything she had seen, shaped to fit the form of whoever sat in them, with a protruding wheel that remind her of a ship's wheel and two black mirrors on the front.

“What powers you?” she wondered aloud, brushing her hand along the front, still perplexed at the lack of anything she could recognize. 

It moved without horses, and no etheric energy surrounded it—no enchantments, no runes, nothing that suggested the arcane. 

Lunira’s fingers trailed along the side of the vehicle until she found where she assumed the door handle would be. She frowned, her brows knitting together as she only found what looked like the outline of handle. It was unlike anything she had ever seen—no latches, no obvious mechanism. She tried the seams of the door and tugged at it gently, then harder, but the door remained firmly shut, unyielding.

Her frustration grew. Why couldn’t she even open this strange contraption? It was as though everything connected to Lethira’s time in the human realm was beyond her reach—closed off to her, just like this door. Her fingers curled into a fist, and for a brief moment, she had the wild urge to strike the vehicle, to vent her pent-up emotions on this cold, unfeeling thing that seemed to mock her ignorance.

But she held back, exhaling slowly as she took a step back, staring at the Rivian. It wasn’t just the vehicle that felt impenetrable—it was the entire world Lethira had inhabited without her. The jealousy surged again, sharper now, because it wasn’t just about a man or a daughter. It was about the life Lethira had lived, the experiences she’d had that Lunira could never fully understand or share. 

She was powerless in the face of it, just as she was powerless to unlock the secrets of this strange machine. The realization left her feeling hollow, and for a moment, she wondered if her connection with Lethira had been more fragile than she had allowed herself to believe.

Lunira’s steps slowed as she neared the attached structure behind the strange blue vehicle. The bulk of it loomed ahead, about nine paces in length and almost three times her heigh. It was massive, with a smooth outer shell that gleamed faintly under the dim light. The material was foreign to her—a strange, white surface, hard yet smooth, unlike the wood, stone, or metal she was accustomed to. She ran her fingers along it but couldn’t identify what it was. The surface felt cool and strangely artificial, like nothing natural she’d ever encountered.

There were subtle, simple designs on the exterior, sleek and almost predatory in appearance, though their function remained a mystery to her. No visible seams gave any clue as to how this thing moved or operated, leaving her even more intrigued. The entire structure seemed unnatural, as if it had been crafted with a knowledge beyond her understanding just to annoy her.

She circled to the side of the structure, observing the two strange, boxy extensions that seemed to protrude outward, giving it a broader shape. A series of small, round wheels sat underneath, but again, there were no animals, no visible mechanism to move the thing. The smooth surface reflected the dim light of the night sky, casting long shadows as she walked around, feeling a mixture of awe and confusion. 

“What strange craft…” she muttered, her brow furrowed.

Lunira slowed her steps as she reached the end of the RV. There she found Lina, who sat cross-legged on the ground, illuminated by the faint glow of a device in her hands. The object looked like a magic mirror to Lunira, though it was thick like a stone tablet. The light flickered gently as Lina's fingers danced across its surface, her focus entirely on the glowing screen.

For a moment, Lunira watched in silence, her brow furrowed with curiosity. Finally, she stepped closer. ""What are you doing out here?"" she asked, her voice softer than she'd intended.

Lina looked up, startled at first, but quickly smiled. “Oh, hi! You’re Lunira, right? My cousin?” she asked, tucking the rugged tablet into her lap.

“I am,” Lunira replied, smiling. “And you’re Lina, my new little cousin.”

“Yep! I couldn’t sleep, so I came out here to play some games. Fresh air helps me relax.”

Lunira nodded, her eyes drifting back to the glowing device. ""What is that thing?""

Lina grinned and held up the tablet. ""This? It’s a rugged tablet. Mom bought it for me after I broke my last one... when I lost a game,"" she said sheepishly, her cheeks flushing a bit. ""I kind of threw it across the room.""

Lunira smirked, amused by the idea of the young girl unleashing her frustration on the fragile device. ""Ah, I see. It’s good your mother got you one that’s harder to break.""

""Yeah, she says it’s Lina-proof,"" the girl giggled, standing up and brushing the dirt off her pants. ""Hey, do you want to see inside the RV?""

Lina’s mischievous grin widened. “I could give you the *grand tour,*” she offered, her voice taking on a playful tone. ""You’ve probably never seen anything like this in the Prime Realm.""

Lunira, still unsettled by the glowing mirror-like tablet, raised an eyebrow. “A tour, you say?” She folded her arms. ""Well, I suppose I should know what all these strange devices are.""

With a grin, Lina swung open the RV door and gestured dramatically. “Welcome to the Grand Lodge!” she announced in an exaggerated saleswoman voice. “Let me show you the wonders of *lighting*—no spells needed!”

She flicked a switch on the wall, and Lunira flinched at the sudden flood of light. “By the stars—what sort of sorcery is this?” she gasped, wide-eyed as she gazed at the illuminated interior.

Lina winked. ""Not sorcery, my dear customer. *Electricity!* No need for spells, just a simple switch, and you’ve got instant daylight.""

Lunira's gaze moved to the glowing fixtures overhead. “Electricity,” she echoed, the unfamiliar word heavy on her tongue. “Controlled by that…switch?”

""Exactly!"" Lina puffed up her chest, clearly enjoying the role of tour guide. ""Now, step into our luxurious kitchen area!""

Lunira followed, taking in the compact yet modern kitchen. The smooth countertops gleamed, and the stainless steel appliances reflected the warm light. She reached out, running her fingers along the cool surface.

“What is this material?” she asked, her voice barely above a whisper.

“Stainless steel,” Lina answered, still in character. “No rust, no fuss. Perfect for long journeys! And this—” She yanked open the fridge door with a flourish. ""Our state-of-the-art refrigerator! Plenty of room for snacks, and the best part? No magic needed to keep it cold.""

Lunira peered inside the brightly lit fridge, still struggling to comprehend. “And how does it stay cold?” she asked.

“More electricity!” Lina tapped the side of the fridge confidently. “Everything in here runs on it. I don’t know how exactly, but it works!” She gave a quick shrug, her saleswoman act faltering for a moment before bouncing back. “We also have an electric oven and a microwave oven, but let’s not get bogged down with details—on to the main event!”

Lina led her through the living area, where two plush recliners sat facing a large flat-screen television mounted on the wall. ""This is where the real magic happens—entertainment at your fingertips!"" She gestured grandly toward the TV. “This, my dear cousin, is called a *television,* a device that shows moving pictures and stories from all over the world.”

Lunira leaned closer to inspect the black, mirror-like surface. “Another magic mirror?” she muttered, thinking of the tablet. “But larger.”

""Nope!"" Lina replied with a grin. “Not magic, just more technology. I could turn it on, but there’s no signal out here right now.”

Lunira kept her gaze on the screen, fascinated. The idea that humans could create such things without magic was both alien and captivating. “No signal?”

“It’s like…you need a connection to watch stuff. You’ll get it eventually,” Lina said with a dismissive wave. “But enough of that! Now, let me show you the crown jewel—*the master bedroom!*”

Lina opened the door with a flourish, revealing the bedroom at the rear of the RV. The king-sized bed sat beneath overhead cabinets, with large windows on either side. The space was cozy, but it radiated a sense of luxury. Soft, warm light filled the room, giving it an inviting glow.

“This bed is fit for a queen!” Lina declared, throwing her hands toward the mattress. “Or in this case, my mom.”

Lunira chuckled softly, her eyes wandering across the comfortable room. “I must admit, this…technology is full of surprises,” she said, her tone lightening as she glanced back at Lina, who was beaming with pride.

“Oh!” Lina suddenly remembered. “How could I forget the *best* part? The bathroom!”

“The bathroom?” Lunira asked, intrigued.

Lina grinned and led her down a short hallway to the door beside the kitchen. “Prepare to be amazed!” she declared, throwing open the door. 

Lunira peered inside, expecting something simple, but what she saw left her speechless. The bathroom was sleek and modern, with a walk-in shower that had glass doors, a porcelain toilet, and a sink with a shiny faucet. The space was compact yet remarkably functional, and it gleamed under the same artificial light that illuminated the rest of the RV.

“No spells needed for hot water,” Lina said proudly, turning on the faucet to demonstrate the running water. “It’s all controlled by electricity. You’ve got your shower, your toilet, and even a fan to keep things fresh.”

Lunira stared at the setup in awe, her mind racing to understand how such comfort and convenience could exist without magic. “And all this…without spells,” she murmured.

Lina nodded, clearly enjoying her cousin's amazement. “Yup! Humans are clever, aren’t they?”

Lunira shook her head, a smile tugging at her lips. ""They certainly are.""

Here’s the scene with your provided edits:

---

Lunira stood at the RV door, her gaze falling on the vehicle parked in front. “What’s that thing over there?” she asked, nodding toward it.

“Oh, that’s a Rivian,” Lina replied, puffing up a little with pride. “It’s an electric SUV. But I can’t show you the inside… Mom took the key with her.”

“Why not?” Lunira asked, curious.

“Well, I’m not allowed in there without her,” Lina admitted with a small sigh. “Last year, I… uh, tried to drive the last one we had. And, well…” She winced at the memory. “I crashed it into a wall. Broke my arm and a few teeth. It wasn’t fun.”

Lunira raised an eyebrow, impressed by Lina’s honesty. “I see why you’re not allowed in there anymore.”

Lina gave a sheepish smile. “Yeah, lesson learned.”

Lunira opened her mouth to ask about friends, family, or Lina’s father, but before she could speak, the RV door swung open. Lethira staggered inside, chalice in hand, her cardigan nowhere to be seen. She swayed, looking at the two of them with bleary eyes.

“Lunira!” Lethira called out loudly, her voice slurred. She stumbled toward them, raising her empty chalice. “Come here! Give your favorite aunt a kiss!”

Lunira blinked, then quickly stepped in front of Lethira, holding her at arm’s length, wrinkling her nose at the strong smell of alcohol. “I think you’ve had enough for tonight,” she said gently, trying to keep the situation under control.

Lina sighed “_Verdammte scheiße_”

Lunira couldn’t understand the meaning of the words, though the tone didn't need translation.

Seeing that her aunt was in no condition to argue, Lunira sighed and guided Lethira toward the bedroom. “Come on, let’s get you to bed.”

“Such a good niece…” Lethira mumbled, leaning heavily on Lunira as they made their way to the back of the RV. As soon as her head hit the pillow, she was out cold, sprawled face down on the plush bed. She moved her aunt so she rested on her side.

Lina, standing at the door, crossed her arms. “I hate it when she gets like that,” she muttered, her voice quiet but tinged with frustration.

Lunira looked back at her. “Does she drink often?”

Lina shook her head. “Not really. But when she does, it’s like this. She gets really annoying.”

Lunira let out a soft sigh, brushing a hand through her hair. “I should check on my own mother and our grandmother. They’re probably just as drunk.” She paused, glancing back at Lethira, now softly snoring. “Are you okay with me leaving her like this?”

“Yeah,” Lina said, already slipping back into her playful attitude. “I’ll play some more before going to bed.”

Lunira nodded. “Alright then. Goodnight, Lina.”

“Goodnight, Lunira,” Lina replied with a smile.

Drawing up vessel designs, speaking with the dockworkers and organizing logistics is no easy feat, nevertheless the Arsenal is second to none in the simplification of warship design. While sipping his coffee at the canal ways, enjoying his time watching the swans and ducks paddle in the water, he would observe the long column of galleys, sailing through the narrow Venetian canals awaiting to be completed for service.

The ship's low hum permeated the air as we glided through the void. No one spoke, for fear of breaking the silence. It’d been a good half hour since our brush with death, and both Melek and I tended to the various tasks we were assigned to. Every so often I’d check on him, making sure he was still okay. 



Over time the trembling in his hands went away, but I couldn’t help but feel his wary attitude persist. We both felt uneasy, in fact, everyone aboard was reeling from the event. The sudden shift in Liora’s attitude from confident space jockey to timidity spelled out just how close we’d come to being obliterated. Her abrupt change only fueled our individual reflections. 



Finishing a check on the reactor system, I sat down in my seat. The bleeding had stopped, and the bandage had taken on a dull brownish red as the blood clotted. Gingerly I touched the wound, and a splitting pain emerged as my fingers grazed the top of my head. The reflective action to tighten up from the pain compounded the issue, as my bruised ribs reminded me of their existence. I wasn’t the only one nursing a beaten body, Melek had a slight limp. Every time he moved around, he noticeably avoided putting weight on his right leg. Even in how he stood, he leaned towards his left and often rubbed his shoulder. 



Peering just around the corner into the cockpit, Liora and her companion sat silently. In her reflection from the windshield, I could just make out the evidence of some tears. The co-pilot similarly held a soft, contemplative expression. In knowing that we’d have to jump sooner or later, I built the courage to ask,



“When are we jumping?” 



Liora glanced down, “Five minutes.”, she answered, barely above a whisper. 



“Sounds good… I’m just glad you got us out of that mess, and that we’re still alive.” My voice low.



Glancing again towards the cockpit, her ears flicked slightly lower than before. The move was subtle, but it spoke volumes. She’d always been the one with confidence to share, brushing off danger with sarcastic comments. But the facade she put on had cracked. Her hands gripping the controls a little too hard, and her eyes looking straight ahead, almost as if she was stifling a barrage of thoughts. 



Not wanting to push further, I stayed quiet letting her process everything that had happened. 

My eyes returned to the back of the cabin, Melek stood finishing up whatever it was that he was doing. With a final tap on the screen, he slowly turned to the side. His eyes focused on the floor, and then up at me. With a deep breath, he slowly made his way towards his own seat. Once there, he lowered himself into place, wincing as he adjusted his weight. 

His silence continued, but I could still feel the doubts and fears radiating from him. He’d been right, Earth still wasn’t quite ready for space. Our technology, crude and simplistic was untested. Any other well-developed species would have picked up that swarm of meteors, with infrastructure built decades ago sending out warnings for ships to heed. We were blazing the trail for humanity, and with it came the dangers of an untamed void. Catching his wayward glance I knew we were thinking about the same thing:



It’d take years to emulate the council’s relative safety in space. 



Eventually, the moment passed, and I let him know about our second jump.



“Liora says less than five minutes, then we jump *again.*” My words were cautionary and quiet.



Melek tensed slightly, and then gave another sideways glance and nodded slowly. There was little choice but to take the gamble again. No matter what lay at the end of our second jump, we simply did not have the time. At least this time, it *should* be safer. 



Almost as if it were scripted, the low seismic hum began again. As the drive began to power up, the lights began to flicker again. This time, however, the feeling of eternity accompanied the wait. Each moment stretched further and further, the tension began to feel maddening. Checking on Melek revealed his hands clenched onto the sides of his seat, bracing for the inevitable. For myself, I couldn’t shake the idea that something else waited for us. My heart pounded as the same heavy feeling began to drape over me. From the small port on the hatch, the stars elongated into thin dim lines just as before, and with each pulse of the drive a spike of adrenaline accompanied it. 



The universe around us waited with bated breath as we continued our jump. A little over ten minutes would pass from the start to the end, an eternity. I couldn’t dare look at my watch, the impending doom of a finalized jump would have to take me by surprise. Subconsciously I checked my restraints, my body couldn’t handle being thrown around like a toy again. Both Melek and I were lucky we didn’t break anything, both the consoles themselves or our bones. 



After an agonizingly long time, the feeling of the jump lifted. My heart continued to race and my eyes darted around the cabin. Melek too, searched our surroundings, we’ve been through too much to trust the silence. My body tensed, waiting for another alarm, any sign that this time we’d be finished off for good. The seconds turned to minutes, no one said a word. All that could be heard was the usual hum of the ship and the occasional sound of someone shifting in their seat.



Slowly, the tension began to lift as no new dangers presented themselves. From behind, a throat cleared and the co-pilot made his observation,



“We’re clear, a bit off from our intended course, but close enough to the *Horizon*.” His tone filled with a sense of relief.



The confirmation felt like a lifeline, and I exhaled sharply feeling an intense weight being lifted off my shoulders. Giving Melek another glance, his expression had turned to relief, and he tilted his head back to rest against the wall. His words, “We’re home”, came out in a near whisper, but they carried the mass of a survivor’s relief. Collectively we relaxed, as we were no longer at any risk. Even the knowledge that we might have to repeat another two weeks of training couldn’t shake our present appreciation for the gift of *life.* At this point it really didn’t matter anymore, so long as Melek was by my side along with Liora and co-pilot I could survive another round of training.



Looking past the wall my seat was bolted to, and through the windshield I could just make out the faint lights of the spaceport. From the corner of my vision, Liora had looked over her own shoulder. Her gaze flicked towards the bandage on my head, her eyes darkening for a split second. She shifted her focus back onto the controls, her jaw tightening slightly as if she were afraid of making the wrong move. Glancing at me again, quickly this time, the guilt was written all over her face. The weight of our safety was on her shoulders, and my injury was a scar in her mind.



Shifting to face the rear of the cabin again, I felt terrible for Liora. She’d kept us from succumbing to the void, but there was little doubt that she had the sting of responsibility pressing down on her. The way she visibly reacted to the injury she’d unknowingly caused in those intense moments. There was a part of me that realized, it’d be a while before she’d be back to her old self.



A little while later, some radio chatter brought me out of my thoughts. And eavesdropping on the conversation it was the control tower guiding us in:



“*Fire-ball, give us a status.”*



*“Sustained a hull breach, two of my crew members need medical,”* Liora replied, her voice cracking slightly at the mention of requiring medical assistance.



*“Oh? Proceed to bay eight… teams are standing by, glad you’re in one piece.”*



Slowly, but surely I began to feel the pull of the station's artificial gravity. Once we were within range, the ship’s gravity system switched off, and we slowly began to feel the brunt of the station’s pull. The ship let out its usual complaints, with the creaks and groans from its structure. Though we were safe, my body hadn’t quite got the message. My heart raced, and my grip on the seat tightened a little more, waiting for one last incident.



We slowly passed by the open doors of the bay, our ship at a snail’s pace. Liora wasn’t risking anything, she acted as if there was a wine glass standing on a table, and if even one drop was spilled it’d spell doom. After a few more moments, and with the softest kiss of our landing gear against the floor, we settled. 



The sound of various hydraulics kicking on, and final shutdown procedures filled the cabin. Melek let out a deep sigh, and even Liora slumped slightly in her seat.  My knuckles ached from the continuous strain they’d been in clutching my seat. And exhaustion took hold as the adrenaline of our last step to safety wore off along with the return of soreness that accompanied my battered frame. The sound of several sets of harnesses being unclipped along with a few coughs from Melek played out. Leaning forward, I could feel my ribs complain along with my beaten shoulders. Each new movement causing a sharp stab of discomfort. However, the mental toll of nearly coming to oblivion was far worse. The weariness crept into my bones, it was a level of ‘tired’ that a simple night’s rest could not fix. 



A sharp knock on the hatch snapped my attention upwards. Cautiously, I began to rise to my feet, supporting myself with a handhold mounted to the wall. My hands found themselves on the locking lever, and giving one last glance to an expectant Melek, I unlocked the hatch.



As I heaved the hatch open, a gust of warm air rushed past carrying the smell of oil and metal like that of an auto-shop. The sharp smell tickled my nose and contrasted sharply with the recycled air aboard the ship. Machinery whirred in the background, and the sound of an impact wrench hammering away served as a reminder that the work never stopped. The bright lights of the bay were blinding, forcing me to squint as my eyes adjusted. An instructor stood on a mobile ramp, right at the hatch entrance, his jumpsuit dotted with oil stains. His face was serious, but his eyes rapidly flicked over the interior of the ship before coming to rest on me. Concern flashed briefly, as his gaze gravitated towards the top of my head. But he remained silent, only giving me a short nod. 



Before I could fully take in the scene outside, he moved out of the way, and a pair of EMTs pushed through the hatch. Immediately, they began assessing our injuries, and over the course of several minutes, a number of other individuals flooded our ship. Maintenance techs, analysts, medical staff, and even a few military types swarmed the various consoles. The scene itself was chaotic, and noticing this the medical staff brought us out of the ship. One by one we exited and began our descent down the ramp. 



Looking around, a small crowd had gathered around ‘Fire-Ball’, drawn in by the commotion of our arrival. Off to the sides, a few other teams who’d either had just returned or were preparing for their run gawked at us. In the moment, the scene itself didn’t feel quite real. Making it to the end of the ramp, we were directed towards the back of the bay. As we began to leave the area, I took a glance at our ship. Bits of paint were missing, and several spots looked as though they’d been sand-blasted down to the bare metal. It struck me that, the meteor storm itself had to have been a literal cloud of debris. Some of which, would have been the size of a speck of dust. Melek caught a wayward glance of the craft as well, his eyes paying particular attention to the cracked cockpit windows. His ears flicked with thought, and his brows scrunched together before he breathed deeply. We’d both had taken a pause, drinking in the exterior damage of ‘Fire-Ball’, and when we had lingered a little too long we were again reminded where we needed to go. 



Our journey out of the bay was met with numerous stares. Some of the onlookers shared conversations with each other, leaning in to keep their words localized. Others would look at our ship with wide eyes, and then at us in disbelief. There would be little doubt I’d be assaulted with questions and relaying the story over and over again, each time the story’s details morphing for the biggest reactions. I couldn’t help but grin slightly at how we’d be talked about in the upcoming weeks. 



Finally, we neared the exit of the Bay area. The open doors loomed ahead like an entrance into another reality. The mechanical din and pungent smells of the hanger area, oil, sweat, and metal began to fade. Instead, they were replaced by the sterile scent of cheap floor polish and that odd sting of ozone that always stuck around. The change was jarring, almost unreal, leaving a sharp twinge in my sinuses. The lighting had also changed, from the searingly bright overhead lights to the bluish-gray-tinged LEDs that were everpresent. All of this served as a barrier between what had just happened to us in the void, to the safety we’d now enjoy.



 Looking up ahead, the medical wing came into view. A few doctors in stark white lab coats floated between rooms, and a handful of nurses chatted about whatever gossip they’d just been let in on. As we got closer, the sterile atmosphere intensified with the smell of antiseptic wipes. Entering into the main area, the EMTs told us to wait for a moment before they flagged down one of the doctors. 



“*All four need exams, two of them, ‘specially the one with a head wound got tossed around pretty hard.”*



*“Alright, we’ll get to them shortly.”*



The younger of the two EMTs gave us a thumbs up before both disappeared back from where we’d just come. This left the four of us in the care of the onboard doctors and nursing teams. The room itself had a variety of equipment, a few recovery beds lined one wall with curtains that could be closed for *some* privacy. Along the rear wall, a few rooms were established for other various procedures along with proper examination tables. One such room was labeled as ‘surgery’, indicating that some more serious work could be achieved with the limited space.



Melek, who’d been mostly silent since leaving the ship coughed slightly. Meeting his gaze, his voice was quiet, horse, as if he’d rather not begin speaking.



“Do you think it’ll always be like this?” He asked in a pained tone.



Frowning, I replied, “Like what?”, not entirely sure what he’d meant.



His eyes flicked over towards the medbay, and with a tired hand, he motioned over the scene. “Surviving…coming back broken… recovering again.”



His words hit harder than I expected. Our minds were just as beaten as our bodies. Melek was still processing what happened out there, as was I. Between the stress of the storm, the peril of the damaged ship, and how close I was to getting knocked out. We hadn’t just come back with a few cracked windows and minor bruising, our heads would be dealing with this for a long time. 



I didn’t have an answer, so my shoulders involuntarily shrugged, “I don’t really know.”



A doctor, with a tan complexion, and a white thin beard walked up to us breaking our conversation. He looked at each of us, sizing up our appearance and injuries taking a few notes on a clipboard.



He gestured to me, “You first, you’ve got the worst of it.” in a professional no-nonsense way.



Following him to one of the rooms, he again motioned for me to take a seat on the table. The usual questions started, what hurt, where, and how bad was it. My answers came automatically, while my mind was still playing back segments of our trip. The cracks in the glass, Liora’s tense face in the red glow, Melek’s death grip on his chair. We were officially safe, but the relief I’d felt earlier was slipping, replaced by the unsettling feeling of uncertainty. 



The physician left me alone for a few moments, while on his way out he mentioned the need for stitches. From behind the door, I could hear the muffled voices of the staff and the sound of footsteps on the floor. Closing my eyes, I focused on Melek’s question. Is this what it’d always be like, to survive a disaster, begin recovering, and then be thrown back into another?



The man returned, nurse in hand with a cart of various medical supplies and instruments. The better part of an hour passed, as they stitched the cut on my head. Thankfully it was revealed that, while there was a lot of blood, it could have been much worse. The nurse herself relayed a story of how one guy had taken a coffee table to the head and subsequently died to a fractured skull and brain hemorrhage. In the moment, I couldn’t help but wonder how lucky we had gotten. I wasn’t sure what the others would have done if my injury had been that bad. The dark thought sent an icy shiver down my spine.



Once my stitches were in, seven of them to be exact and I was cleaned up somewhat, I was released. Back in the main room, the other three sat in chairs along the wall, with exhaustion etched across each of their faces.



Liora sat with her arms crossed and tail firmly in her lap, her usual confidence had dulled. She barely acknowledged my arrival, preferring to stare at the floor instead. Melek sat beside her. We exchanged a glance, his eyes were tired, filled with a mixture of uncertainty and quiet gratitude, we’d made it, though at what cost neither of us knew.



Clearing my throat, I posed the question, “Has everyone else been seen already…?”

Melek nodded answering a little louder than when he posed his initial question, “Yes, I was seen in another room by some other guy, I think the others got pulled separately.” To which the co-pilot nodded, confirming Melek’s answer.



We’d been told to wait for someone to formally set us loose. And after a few more minutes, a pair of footsteps began to echo out in the hall. Shifting my look to the clinic entrance, the face of Samuel Moore greeted me with a stern expression. His piercing blue eyes looked over us, judging everything they took in. Melek shrank slightly and gave me a worried sideways glance.



“An encounter with space rocks, or so I’ve been told.” He began, addressing the four of us. “I’m glad you managed to survive the ordeal, some quick thinking on Adrian’s part kept you from suffocating. And *Liora,* the ship’s computer tells us you pulled an impressive performance.”



She threw a cold sad glance his way, shaking her head slightly. She wasn’t fully present, her mind still behind the controls of ‘Fire-Ball’. The now smaller, cleaner bandage on my head drew her attention again, and I could see the guilt simmering as she returned her eyes to the floor.



Commander Moore’s face wrinkled in confusion for just the briefest moment before he continued.



“Unlike the other teams, you’ll be getting a full debrief tomorrow, after you’ve had time to rest and recover. What happened out there will require a full investigation, we’ll need each individual detail. I’m sure the four of you are anxious about whether or not you passed your final flight. That will be decided before the debrief, but considering your excellent performance, you should be fine.”



The idea that we’d nearly died, and yet we still might be given a pass was mindboggling. Surely, somehow we’d screwed up somewhere. Maybe it really wasn’t anyone’s fault, maybe space travel is just *that* dangerous.



“You’re dismissed. I’d suggest some rest, the next few days will be busy.” Moore continued, before stalking back into the hall, disappearing into the depths of the *Horizon*.  



Once he had left, the silence between us felt heavy, the hum of the clinic entirely distant. I glanced at Liora, she’d kept us alive, even if the cost was visible in the bruises and bandages I wore. She deserved to be reassured and told that I didn’t hold anything against her, but I didn’t know how to tell her that.



Melek, still anxious about the sudden visit broke the silence again. “What now?”



His tone was soft, almost lost amongst the chatter between the nurses. I didn’t have a real answer, nothing substantial anyway.



“We get some rest, I suppose,” I said, almost to myself.

All of my life, no one has given a shit about me or my feelings, even when I've gone out of my way to help them when they needed it. I'm always pushed to the wayside. I don't know why. I try not to be too pushy with people, or needy. 

Recently, I was involved in a domestic with my ex boyfriend. He was the first person I thought really gave a shit about me, until he cheated on me. Even then, I gave him a second chance and when he got into an accident, I was there trying to help him. What do I get for all that? To be shoved into a wall, spit at, choked, and threatened to be stabbed. I have a restraining order in place and I have pressed charges. 

I've tried to reach out for help, but even if I could afford therapy, I work 9 to 5 and most places do not offer after hours therapy. I've even tried group domestic abuse therapy, but they keep canceling every week. I have no friends to reach out to. I'm not looking to vent to someone, I just want somewhere there to get coffee with or just hang out so I can feel like I matter. 

I can't fucking take it anymore. I really want to kill myself but I'm too chicken. In the meantime, I've been trying to put myself in positions where I could get hurt, like I stopped wearing a seat belt in the car. I just want something to kill me so bad.

I've never lived in a studio before and am trying to figure out what to do for my new place. I move next month and can't decide what to do about my WFH situation. I plan on working out of the house when I can, but coffee shops get expensive and I'm hoping to get a 9-5 WFH job in the future which means I probably should have a full setup. I was leaning towards getting a lift-top coffee table or a folding standing desk that I can hide away because I just don't think I have the space. I plan to have my couch and bed in the same place is the photo, and was thinking the desk could go where the little dining table is but I'm concerned a desk PLUS my office chair (which is a nice chair I got from a friend's actual work office) will overtake the space from the kitchen. A Murphy desk/table could maybe save some space but the chair will still be an eyesore.

I wanted to prioritize this storage piece I have in my current kitchen ([this](https://www.wayfair.com/furniture/pdp/17-stories-milburn-kitchen-cart-w005404970.html?piid=1941239285)) but it would take up the entire space on that wall. I also have a produce stand (like [this](https://www.wayfair.com/storage-organization/pdp/gracie-oaks-streetsboro-3-tier-wire-market-basket-stand-in-square-design-w001103057.html)) so was considering getting a smaller kitchen storage unit and having that and the produce on that wall. Alternatively, I could maybe place the produce stand on the side of the kitchen edge near the living room area and hope I can fit all my kitchen items in the cabinets (I'm worried about the appliances like my blender and air fryer).

Note: the space with the hanging tapestry has a breaker box so not sure it's the best spot for a desk (and wouldn't work with anything that needs to be mounted). I plan to either put my tall shoe storage rack there or a small clothes rack, whichever I don't put there will be on the opposite side by the windows or close to the bed. I also have the following larger items to fit in the apartment: MCM-style chair, a tall bookcase, a storage console, this [IKEA storage cabinet](https://www.ikea.com/us/en/p/alex-storage-unit-on-casters-gray-turquoise-black-s99541947/), storage tower for cleaning supplies/toilet paper, etc. (similar to [this](https://www.target.com/p/tall-bath-storage-tower-black-metal-brightroom-8482/-/A-85239816?ref=tgt_adv_xsf&AFID=google&CPNG=Bath&adgroup=64-19)), and entertainment center (although I'm thinking of not keeping this since my TV will be mounted on the wall and that will free up space for the storage console and another bookcase or area for storage (I have a LOT of books I'm not ready to part with). I am getting rid of as much as possible and know things might change after I move in, but I don't have a car and am trying to get as much figured out/bought now while I have people around to help me move things in and/or put things together.

1g865um,https://www.reddit.com/r/MuslimNikah/comments/1g865um/while_i_was_unhappy_in_my_marriage_i_got_a/,"While I was unhappy in my marriage, I got a proposal. Long read - 37 F","Some background about me:

37 years old South Indian Muslim who married a Pashtun Pakistani Muslim and we currently live in Dubai.

I was born and raised in Kerala and had a hard time getting married despite it being normal in south India for being dark. Colorism is alive and well in India. My career was also a makeup artist at a very popular salon but again, I was a ""dark girl with no education.""

From fair and lovely to glutathione injections, my mother tried everything to make me glow as, according to the family, I always looked dirty. I was a carbon copy of my mother who had so much self hate and I could see she tried to help me but in worst ways.

I was putting myself out there: apps, singles events, and matchmakers but nobody ever made it past my appearance. I never thought of myself as ugly. I loved how I looked but others didn't.

At 35, I flew to Dubai for a makeup mastefclass and met my current husband. Let's call him Fawad. Fawad is a divorced single dad from Lahore who studied in the U.K but lived in Dubai. Fawad, mashAllah is very handsome and we met at a kabob shop (of all places) and stayed in touch. We did a small but intimate nikkah and my family was happy that I finally got married, I was moving abroad, and the groom was damn handsome. My mother loves showing off her fair skinned, blue eyed groom. My in laws however hate me. I’m Indian, I’m dark, I’m not conventionally attractive in their eyes, and I don’t speak Urdu - I speak English to my husband and Malayalam back home.s

The honeymoon period was amazing. He was so romantic, we were regularly intimate, went on dates etc. We tried to have kids immediately as I was already 36. It could have been constantly trying but I was getting the most painful UTIs ever that I would miss ovulation week everyone due to pain or treatment that week.

I also had a high thyroid disorder which I disclosed early on and it's very hard for me to gain weight and I'm really skinny. He knew I was getting treatment for it and aH I put on some weight. I also was new to Dubai and couldn't find clients for the first 6 months so I wasn't working either. I could've gotten a job at a fast food restaurant but my husband was adamantly against it. He said since he brought me away from my family, he didn't want me to struggle.

I noticed he was a reckless spender. He lost his job but was maxing out credit cards for trips or fancy dinners in Dubai and without the job, I asked how he paid the credit cards off and he'd brush it off with ""don't worry."" But I can't help but wonder how he's paying it off with no income.

Our rent is paid in 6 month increments and he paid it already. I gave up saris for more modest clothes like modern abayas and he would huff and puff about the costs. Basics like shampoo, conditioner, face wash, clothes was always like pulling teeth. In India, I was so comfortable but here, I feel like a child.

On top of that, he has ptsd from his divorce which was traumatic. We could be just sitting on the couch and he starts rambling about how unfair life is and how could his own family do this (he married his cousin) and it's almost like he's in a trance. I suggest a psychologist who gave him medication for schizophrenia. I'm no expert, but I don't think he has schizophrenia.

I noticed his emails and Amazon accounts all have a female name which I figured was his ex wife's name and the mother of his child. It's a very generic name like ""Sara."" I asked him why does Sara have a profile on Amazon and he mentions how Sara was a girl he almost married after his divorce from his wife (same name) whose family rejected him. Despite the rejection, she always prayed for him to succeed in his career and get married and ""thanks to her dua,"" he's in a good place. That email he used to use to communicate with her and it's his good luck charm. Despite saying how uncomfortable I am, that email is still there.

I'm no saint - I've had boyfriends and was engaged beforehand and disclosed it to my husband.  When I decided to be a better Muslim, I cut off anything that would stray me off the path and once I started praying, could be a coincidence, I got married. It's fard but it was a beautiful sign to me how fast HE listens to our prayers.

He is so used to be alone, he forgets how to cater to a woman sometimes. We did umrahhh together but when I tell you my husband couldn't pick a cheaper or dirtier hotel, I would be lying. This hotel was filthy. I told him the beds were dirty and the shower was covered in bugs. He said he'll go downstairs and ask about a room change but decided first to get some errands done during the day. I took a nap on top of the disgusting bad and showered in the disgusting shower with slippers on before we headed to the harem. The hotel in Mecca was worse. By the time I returned to Dubai, in a couple of weeks I was covered in red spots. I got ring worm from these hotels. I lived a modest life in India but I have never gotten ring worm and I'm not sure why this pushed me over the edge. I demanded he bring me medication and he was adamant that's not what it was since he didn't get it. I googled how to prevent spreading it and wore gloves and disinfected our home and kept myself covered in long layers and gloves if I were near him.

Physically, I looked awful. I was losing my hair, my skin was dry and cracking to the point it was bleeding, I was breaking out. It was stress and the environment changing but I felt physically awful. Like my body was rejecting everything.

The stress of him being inconsiderate, losing his job, reminiscing on the past, me getting physically uncomfortable, and honestly not appreciating me made me visit my parents for couple of weeks. My dad had some appointments and I asked my husband if I could go. He got my ticket for 3 weeks and I went back home.

I'm selfish: I always wanted to be a stay at home wife/mom but I know I should be thankful for what I receive since I was never thankful to Allah before. In India, I had a monthly beauty routine such as brow threading, getting regularly waxed, custom skincare, hair treatments etc. I felt beautiful and feminine with this routine. I imagined being with a husband who appreciated that I took care of myself and just gave me a monthly allowance - how spoiled am I? I am truly a daddy's girl who spoiled me but in India, I had an established client base and didn't struggle. Starting over is hard but starting over with a husband who had to start over is harder.

Almost two weeks in India, I go to the doctor about my physical ailments. The doctor, let's call him Doctor G. He was my family doctors son and mA, this man is so masculine and respectful. My husband isn't masculine at all and he compares himself to me which is off putting.

Doctor G provides me a plan for everything: hair loss, skin dehydration, and following up on ring worm. He's shocked that I contracted it in Saudi Arabia but gives an oral antibiotic. We make small talk and he asks how I was able to move away from my family and all I said was ""I would go anywhere with my husband. Home is where the heart is"" something along those lines. He gave me the sweetest look which made me blush and said not many girls are like you. Your husband is a lucky man.

A couple of days later, we were at the same wedding. He politely said hello to my family with his father and I didn't think much of it.  His dad went around introducing doctor g to the unmarried girls bragging about how he went to medical school in Europe and how he is a dual citizen and has his own home, lives alone away from family, doesn't want his wife to work, and will give her a monthly allowance just for herself. I overheard it and it made me sad because this was what I wanted but it wasn't in my kismat and I didn't let myself think about it further.

A waiter carrying scalding hot tea accidentally spilled some down my arm and I started screaming. Doctor G sat me down and brought a basin of ice water and would soak my arm in and out of it. Since nobody was within ear shot, he asked if I was in a safe situation with my husband. I laughed and said my husband wouldn't even hurt a fly and he said for a woman who moved abroad, I was in pretty poor health. He said i looked exhausted and ill and in the future when I'm in Dubai, get some bloodwork to check for deficiencies. I was embarrassed at the comment and before I could respond he replied that I was a beautiful girl who just happened to look very unhappy.

I thanked him and kept it in the back of my mind. My husband who has his phone glued to his hand is not checking on me at all. Everyday I'm messaging him photos and updates but he never opens my messages. When he does it's like a thumbs up or a smiley on the message. During my time in India, he traveled to Georgia and Turkey to clear his mind. I excused that as not being able to be in touch with me.

I go back for my check up for the burn with Doctor G and ask if he can refer me to a fertility doctor since my husband and I have been trying for a child and want to make sure I'm in good health and able to. He refers me to one and the fertility doctor confirms my high egg count and that I'm able to conceive without the help of medication or treatment. I tell my husband the good news and tell him to get his count check so we can have an answer. My husband agrees to do this when I return back to Dubai.

It's my last week in India and I felt so happy to be home that I start to look like my old self. I missed everything back home and the hard water in Dubai was not agreeing with my skin or hair so I was finally glowing again.

I also set up a marriage counseling appointment with my husband as I feel deceived about the lifestyle he could give me and the fact that he doesn't appreciate me being there.

I finally go home and my husband received me at the airport and I missed him too. He gave me a big hug and we go back. The first couple of days were good like the honeymoon phase before he falls back into being on his phone, ignoring me, not taking me out, sleeping for hours, not being intimate, complaining about spending money. We live in a one bedroom apartment and my husband rather be alone for hours in the living room while I'm in the bedroom watching tv. He's content that I'm in the house but not around him. I understand alone time but I feel like alone time is all the time.

These sound simple but since I'm far from loved ones, I feel more ignored. I brought it up many times but his mentality is if he isn't cheating or abusive, he's a good husband. He is ditsy but not vindictive in any way but I feel like he's not the masculine provider man he made himself out to be. I don't need a lavish lifestyle but I don't want to go to 6 stores to find the same shampoo for cheaper.

I brought up getting a job again and he was so offended that I was offending him being a man that we stopped talking for a day despite me apologizing. I realized how miserable I was and we haven't even hit a year in my marriage and I'm always looking for excuses for leave.

My husband was asleep so I headed to the market and the coffee shop to get coffee. I run into doctor G at the coffee shop of all people and he lights up seeing me. We catch up and he asks about my health. He was in Dubai to see a potential but unfortunately it didn’t work out. He was telling me how she was very adamant about a lavish lifestyle and cars for mahr and a high rise apartment which he wasn’t against but she didn’t ask him any questions about his character so he ended it then and there. I told him inshAllah I will make dua that he finds someone for him and he makes dua that inshallah I become a mother soon.

I’m not sure what provoked this but he said he wished we would’ve been introduced to each other sooner. He wished his medical school didn’t take so long and he met me before I went to Dubai. I was surprised by this revelation. Before I could reply, he talked about he’s not like typical desi men against marrying someone who is widowed, divorced, or a single mom. He shared examples of our Prophet (PBUH) and said that if I ever decide to leave my husband, to reach out to him. But to leave him because I was unhappy, not for Doctor G.

I was confused and asked why he was saying this and he said from our conversations, he could see I was still missing my other half despite being married. He wanted to take care of me, give me a good life, whatever mahr my parents wanted, and a lifestyle I wanted.

He said he’s going to wait for my response.

I went back home without saying anything any my husband wakes up. He turns on the tv while ignoring me and I make dua for my husband to change and be best for me despite feelings of wanting to leave him. His count comes back and it’s almost 0% so he’s supposed to change his diet which he hasn’t yet. He also cancels the marriage counseling appointment.

Now I’m here on Reddit with my thoughts.

He sometimes says he’s going to clean the car or sometimes he sits in his car for hours on end. He says he needs some him time but it’s like what about some me time. I don’t drive so sometimes for the babies nap I ask him can we get coffee and just use this time so I can stay sane and just get out for the babies nap, he will say okay but say I wasn’t planning on stepping out but every weekend he steps out to go to the store, to hang in his car and watch YouTube for him time, sometimes him and the neighbor they sit outside and talk for hours. I recently asked him if we could come up with a desired wake time for the baby like 7am which is when he goes to work and let that be a set time she gets up as well on the weekend but I would like for him to get up with us and hang and play and spend some time together. If I put the baby down for a nap we can still just relax together or come to bed to cuddle with me. He says okay and still does nothing or he will complain the whole day how he needed him time. Like right now he stepped out to buy himself snacks. Am I wrong for thinking he should wake with me at 7am to be with the baby when he’s off? Or spend time with me. I know everyone needs them time but how much me time does he need when it’s everyday. Am I asking for too much ?",1,1729450775.0,Parenting,1,1.0,False
1g865iq,https://www.reddit.com/r/twinpeaks/comments/1g865iq/binged_all_of_twin_peaks_for_the_first_time_here/,Binged all of Twin Peaks for the first time here are my thoughts.,"So I just watched Twin Peaks for the first time and I have a lot of thoughts. Its been about a week sense I finished The Return and so I’ve had time to sit with it.

First off the show absolutely lived up to the hype it was a little slow for me at first but then it gripped me and didn’t let go. 

The interesting thing was as a fan of Lynch when starting off I was a little disappointed in the lack of Lynchian elements and weirdness in the first season. Then when I got to Return my I was missing the more mundane stuff from season 1 (more on that later)

Once I accepted the show for what it was however I fell in love with it! Audrey was hands down my favorite character even over Coop and also my biggest issue with the show (again more in that later)

The show peaked for me like think it did with most people at the reveal that Leland was the killer! Those episodes in season 2 had me on the edge of my seat! But I still enjoyed what followed. 

I actually liked Ben’s confederate story line it got me through the rougher parts of the 2nd season although it did have an inverse effect of sidelining my favorite character. I will say seeing how horrible Ben was in season 1 I do have mixed feelings about him being redeemed, but I did enjoy having his character around.

The end is season 2 was great but for me it never reached the same level of quality as the reveal of the killer.

Then I watched Fire Walk With Me and I loved it! I thought it was the perfect blend of Lynch’s dark surrealist style with the charm of the show. I was surprised to find out a lot of people didn’t like it including Tarantino! I thought it was a perfect mix of everything that made the show great. 

Now onto the Return and I’m incredibly mixed on it. There’s a lot of great stuff in it. I did enjoy the Dougie storyline. I sometimes catch myself saying “Dougie Jones” like Coop just to make myself laugh. It certainly had that Lynch weirdness and style that I initially signed up for, but at that point I had fallen in love with everything else about the show even the soapy melodrama I was rolling my eyes at when I started watching it, and I caught myself missing that charm and campiness. The original series makes me want to curl up with a cup of Coffee and sit by the fire. Return made me uncomfortable (in a good way) Still a lot of Return is a critique of nostalgia, and as this was my first time watching I wasn’t exactly nostalgic. I knew not to expect closure but I was hoping to see more of these characters I spent the last few weeks falling in love with. I know a lot of people say it’s better on a rewatch so maybe one day I’ll give it another try as time goes on, but I didn’t enjoy it as much as the original series. I’m not sure I’ll ever be happy with what they did with Audrey.

So like I said Audrey is my biggest critique of the show and one of my favorite parts of it. I know there was some behind the scenes drama that played  a role and that’s unfortunate. She was an awesome strong character with a lot of agency and attitude, but once they wrapped up the One Eye’d Jack story she really got sidelined. It wasn’t too bad at first because what easy to write off as her slowing down because of how traumatic that experience must have been for her, from her dad almost having sex with her without him knowing to being forced to take heroine I understand why she might want to slow down. Still as the show went on it felt like they were spinning their wheels on what to do with her. She existed in services to Ben’s story, and then Billy Zane shows up and leaves just as quickly. However by then end of season 2 there was potential for more with her. Her stunt at the bank felt almost like a return to form. Of course we then had to wait 25 years before we saw her again. Then we get to return she’s barely mentioned then we finally see her in episode 12. (edit: I accidentally put in 16 instead of 12) I know in the books she’s in a mental asylum. I’ll just flat out say that sucks. She was so cool and interesting, and while I understand the meta element of the story that Lynch is going for and I know her actress had a different storyline originally, I still don’t like it. She had so much potential and it just felt wasted. This isn’t just an issue with Return as you can see this trajectory in season 2 and it continued to decline from there.

All that being said. I still loved the show and will absolutely come back to it. I do think I will probably just watch until episode 9 of season 2 then watch FWWM sometimes when I marathon it, but every now and then I’ll go back to and watch the whole thing. 

So yeah those are my thoughts as a first time viewer. In short 9/10! Great show! ",16,1729450753.0,twinpeaks,0,0.94,False

It's raining again, but the forecast is saying this one's safe for humans and anyone not worried about their jackets being stained. Not that you have a choice, you have bills to pay. City buses stopped running in your neighborhood after the \*“event”\*, and you're pretty sure the auto-cabs are still being held for ransom by the anti-corpo “hacktivists” that took out the Night Owl coffee house last week.

You walk by three ads for a new kind of synth-blood that you're sure your vegan vampire friends are going to be excited for, at least until the next time they go to the O+ club and get the real thing; those fads never last long. Off in the distance, Mt. Rainier is still casting that eerie glow across the sky; like an Aurora Borealis, but the sinister sort that lowers everyone’s property value on that side of town. You're curious if the rumors about what lurks in the fog up there are true, but your buddy in the Division won't say anything besides “it's confidential” and “I didn't enlist to retrieve bodies”. Like most lycans, he's been on edge since the whole thing started but can’t describe the unnerving feeling the sight gives him now.

Maybe it's because you don't live in the swankier neighborhoods in the north end of town (where they hide their dirty laundry better), but you're seeing a lot more gang signs tagged on walls here. Not the usual sort, these are ugly ones. The violent gangs that like to follow supers down alleys, the garbage that the Division can't seem to scrub from Seattle's underbelly or root out their corpo sponsors. It's only a matter of time before they start noticing who you hang out with at the local bar, too, and you don’t have enough saved up to move..

Seattle has always been bleak. Maybe it's time for a change? What can \*you\* change?

The drone operator in question was a Ukrainian who has 440+ kills – all of which have been *confirmed by video*.

Drone operators are the most coveted targets on the battlefield of a modern warfare in Ukraine.

Contrary to Taylor’s delusions, they are not sitting somewhere far in a trailer box, chilling and sipping coffee.

They actively are moving and hiding along the frontline, and often in the gray zone/no-mans-land - in order to launch their FPV drones as close to the Russians as possible, so that they can strike valuable targets deep in the russian rear. They are actively being hunted upon and they are often killed.

Russians perceive them as number 1 target and the most coveted one. (Combat medics and CASEVACs are the second).

It is a very dangerous job, like everything at war is.

The infantry has immense balls to do what they do. But such claims about drone operators, who work on a tactical level and essentially operate as a special forces with a very specific tasks - such claims by a guy who sits and rants from his chair about the “honors” of warfare and directed to the people who see the very worst of it - it’s literally pathetic.",14,1729450378.0,PKA,13,0.68,False

Need Advice,"Hey r/nosleep, I don't usually post here but I'm seriously freaked out and don't know where else to go. Some really weird stuff has been happening at night and it’s starting to get out of control. I’m honestly scared for my life at this point.

So, it started about two weeks ago. I live in a small apartment by myself, nothing fancy, but quiet, you know? Anyway, for the past few nights, I’ve been waking up at like 3:00 AM on the dot every single night. I don’t even have an alarm set or anything. I just wake up, heart racing, and I hear this weird noise coming from the living room. It’s like…this low humming sound. Not like electronics, more like… a voice? I can't explain it.

At first, I thought it was my neighbor or something, but when I go to check, there’s no one there. The sound just stops as soon as I get up to look around. It’s been happening every night.

Last night was the worst though. I woke up like usual, and this time, the humming was louder. I went into the living room, but as soon as I stepped in, it felt like the air got heavier. Like something was in the room with me. I couldn’t see anything, but I swear, I felt it. I couldn’t move, just stood there staring at nothing, listening to that hum. Then, just like before, it stopped.

When I turned to go back to bed, I noticed something different this time. My front door was unlocked.

I’m 100% sure I locked it before bed. Always do.

I feel like I’m losing my mind. I don’t want to tell anyone IRL because they’ll think I’m crazy, but what if someone’s been in my apartment while I’m asleep? Or worse, what if it’s not… a person?

Update: Ok, so I woke up again tonight. I wasn’t going to post this but now I’m really freaking out. The humming came back, and this time, it was RIGHT outside my bedroom door. I could hear it so clearly, like whoever—or whatever—it is, was standing right on the other side.

I didn’t want to open the door, but I couldn’t just stay there frozen. I grabbed my phone, dialed 911, but right before I pressed call, the humming stopped again. Just cut off, like it was waiting for me to do something. I waited a few minutes, then decided to check the door.

When I opened it, there was something on the floor.

A note. It wasn’t there before, I swear. It was a crumpled-up piece of paper with some writing on it. In shaky, barely legible handwriting, it said:

“LEAV NOW”

I don’t know what to do. I’m scared to go back to sleep.

Final Update: Okay, things have gotten worse since last night. I didn’t sleep at all, but I kept hearing faint footsteps from the hallway. Around 4 AM, there was a loud bang on my door, but when I looked through the peephole, no one was there.

I called the cops this morning and told them everything. They came, did a quick check of the apartment, but of course, they didn’t find anything. No signs of forced entry, no fingerprints, nothing. They basically told me I was imagining things.

But here’s the weirdest part.

After the cops left, I went to sit on the couch and noticed something I hadn’t before. Underneath the coffee table, there was a small, dusty envelope. I picked it up and opened it. Inside was another note.

I got my camping stove with some new canisters out so I can cook along with the camping pots.

Got my wind-up radio that has a torch and solar charger on it on. I can use it to charge my phone..it's got a usb slot. Radio is good for background noise and is blocking out the sound of the wind and rain and is good entertainment.

Got my old fashioned wind-up clock out so I know what time it is if my phone dies. 

I had my 2 chargers for my phone charged and set my phone to battery saver mode. I also have solar panels for my battery charger for my phone..that's for Tomorrow.

I have 2 cob work lights fully charged and ready and they also have usb at the back to charge my phone. I also have a small wind-up torch.

Don't try new foods🙈.. I cooked new sausages before electric went..sage and onion flavoured..sounded amazing..looked amazing..fresh from the butchers. I've got heart burn and they are repeating on me....eat food you know you like!! It's not life threatening or anything but just a quick heads up!!🤣

I need to get my chimney cleaned so I can light a fire.....organising that for next week.

I need more candle holders... I have loads of candles and lighters, matches etc but not enough holders for them.. I can put the small ones on plates but the long tall ones... Only have 2 candle sticks for them.

I forgot that I had ran out of oil for my oil lamps...it's on the shopping list yo buy this week.

The obsession has transitioned from something feral and chaotic in the beginning to something more like a steady drip from an IV. Sometimes in the transition it's felt like maybe I'm not as limerent for him anymore, but then I see him again or have to have a meeting with him and the feelings are all still there. Really, the thought of him is always in my mind, it's just moved to the background or the periphery, but it is always there.

The other day I saw someone in his office for a long time, she's younger like me though I don't know who she is. Then later on I saw the two of them walking together to get coffee, and I felt jealous for the first time. But I've never been jealous of his wife, or of any other coworkers I know he works with.

I think the jealousy comes in combination with a feeling like he's been more brief and less complimentary in his interactions with me lately. There was something that he shared with me a couple months ago that was quite vulnerable and personal, and when I acknowledged and validated it, he immediately backed off. Things haven't felt the same since, and of course my overactive limerent brain wants to guess that it's maybe because he does like me and got a little too comfortable with me, then realized he needed to not do that. And because he is more brief now, I've been feeling down. On the one hand I am craving and pining for more of his attention, and more signs that he likes me back. But on the other hand I know it's a losing game and it doesn't matter whether or not he does, and I should be moving on anyway.

My wife and I are opening a specialty coffee shop this spring in our hometown.
We’re hoping to hire some experienced/excited baristas that are looking to work for a shop that will greatly appreciate their input and expertise. We’re working to create an environment where the baristas can have just as much of a hand in the trajectory of the shop as us the owners.

Our town is dominated by mostly corporate coffee shops with very few specialty shops, and therefore there’s not a huge market of experienced specialty baristas.

We’re trying to decide the best way to seek out experienced or excited baristas without poaching from the few shops that exist.

Any tips?

He was charming, reckless, and unpredictable—the kind of guy who knew his way around trouble and didn’t seem to mind it. But this time felt different. It wasn’t just a few months; he was facing ten years. A decade behind bars, for possession of over a pound of cocaine. They said it was hidden in the trunk of his car, packed away as casually as groceries. 



It stung. He’d promised us he was clean, that his wild years were behind him. Even at Thanksgiving, he’d go out of his way to remind us all that he was on the straight and narrow. We’d had our doubts—old habits don’t vanish overnight, after all. But a pound? None of us had seen that coming. My uncle swore up and down the drugs weren’t his, said he was framed, that someone wanted to see him gone for good. But when we pressed him on it, he’d just clam up, muttering that spending a decade locked away was better than what ""they"" would do to him.



After he was sentenced, my mom called, her voice tight, asking if I could go to his place and sort through his things. It was typical family duty—the kind of thing I couldn’t turn down. I wasn’t close with him, but family ties run deep enough to leave you feeling responsible, even when you know you shouldn’t.



So, with him locked away for the next ten years, I volunteered to clear out his apartment, move his things to storage. I didn’t know why I was so eager, but maybe I felt like it was the least I could do. The place was a disaster, exactly as I expected. His kitchen cupboards were filled with thrift-store pots and pans, each one more scratched and mismatched than the last. I could see him at the stove, cigarette dangling from his lips, stirring whatever random meal he’d thrown together in those beat-up pans.



The living room was its own kind of graveyard. Ashtrays covered nearly every surface, filled with weeks’ worth of cigarette butts, and the walls were a deep, sickly yellow from years of constant smoke. Even the light switches had turned the same shade, crusted over from the nasty habit that had stained every inch of the place. It was clear he hadn’t cracked a window in years. I found myself running my fingers along the walls, almost wondering if the yellow residue would come off. It didn’t.



In one corner of the room was his pride and joy: a collection of *Star Trek* figurines and posters, lined up on a crooked shelf he’d likely hammered up himself. He’d been a fan for as long as I could remember, always rambling about episodes I’d never seen and characters I couldn’t name. Dozens of plastic figures with blank, determined stares watched me pack up their home, my uncle’s treasures boxed up and ready to be hidden away for who knew how long.



It took a few days, but I finally got the majority of the place packed. Three trips in my truck, hauling boxes and crates to the storage facility across town, until the apartment was stripped bare. The only things left were the stained carpet, the nicotine-coated walls, and the broken blinds barely hanging in the windows. There was no way he was getting his security deposit back; the damage was practically baked into the place. But it didn’t matter anymore.



As I sorted through the last of the kitchen, my hand brushed against something tucked away in the shadows of the cabinet. I pulled it out and found myself holding a small, leather-bound book. The cover was cracked and worn, the leather soft from age, with a faint smell of cigarette smoke clinging to it. The pages inside were yellowed, brittle, and marked with years of kitchen chaos—stains, smudges, and scribbled notes everywhere.



The entries were scattered, written down in no particular order, almost as if whoever kept this book had jotted recipes down the moment they’d been created, without thought of organization. As I skimmed the pages, a feeling crept over me that this book might have belonged to my grandfather. He was the one who’d brought the family together, year after year, with his homemade dishes. Every holiday felt anchored by the meals he’d cooked, recipes no one had ever been able to quite replicate. This book could very well hold the secrets to those meals, a piece of him that had somehow made its way into my uncle’s hands after my grandfather passed. And yet…



I couldn’t shake a strange sense of dread as I held it. The leather was cold against my hands, almost damp, and a chill worked its way through me as I turned the pages. It felt *wrong*, somehow, as if there was more in this book than family recipes.



Curious about the book’s origins, I brought it to my mom. She took one look at the looping handwriting on the yellowed pages and nodded, her face softening with recognition. ""This was your grandfather's,"" she said, almost reverently, tracing her fingers along the ink. She hadn’t seen it in years, and when I told her where I'd found it, a look of surprise flickered across her face. She had been searching for the book for ages and had never realized her brother had kept it all this time.  



As she flipped through the pages, nostalgia mingled with something else—maybe a touch of sadness or reverence. I could tell this book meant a lot to her, which only strengthened my resolve to preserve it. “Could I hang onto it a little longer?” I asked. “I want to scan it, make a digital copy for myself, so we don’t lose any of his recipes.”



My mom agreed without hesitation, grateful that I was taking the time to safeguard something she hadn’t known was still around. So I got to work. Over the next few weeks, in the gaps of my day-to-day life, I carefully scanned each page. I wasn’t too focused on the content itself, more concerned with making sure each recipe was clear and legible, and didn’t pay close attention to the strange ingredients and odd notes scattered throughout. My only goal was to make the text accessible, giving life to a digital copy that would be preserved indefinitely.



Once I finished, I spent a few hours merging the scanned images, piecing them together to create a seamless digital version. When it was finally done, I returned the original to my mom, feeling a strange mix of relief and satisfaction. The family recipes were now safe, and I thought that was the end of it. But that sense of unease I’d felt in the kitchen, holding that worn leather cover, lingered longer than I expected.



In the months that followed, I didn’t think much about the recipe book. Scanning it had been a small side project, the kind I’d meant to follow up on by actually cooking a few of my grandfather’s old dishes. But like so many side projects, I got wrapped up in other things and the book’s contents drifted to the back of my mind, filed away and forgotten.



Then Thanksgiving rolled around. I made my way to my parents’ place, expecting the usual—turkey, stuffing, and the familiar spread that had become tradition. When I got there, though, I noticed something different right away. A large bird sat in the middle of the table, roasted to perfection, but something about it didn’t look right. It was too small for a turkey, and its skin looked darker, almost rougher than the golden-brown I was used to.  



“Nice chicken,” I said, figuring they’d switched things up for a change. My mom just shook her head.



“It’s not a chicken,” she said quietly. “It’s a hen.”



I gave her a confused look. “What’s the difference?” I asked, half-laughing, expecting her to shrug it off with a quick explanation. Instead, she just stared at me, her eyes unfocused as if she were lost in thought. 



For a moment, her face seemed distant, almost blank, as though I’d asked a question she couldn’t quite place. Then, suddenly, she blinked, her gaze snapping back to me. “It’s just… what the recipe called for,” she said, a strange edge to her voice.



Something about it made the hair on my arms prickle, but I pushed the feeling aside, figuring she’d just been caught up in the cooking chaos. Yet, as I looked at the bird again, a small flicker of unease crept in, settling in the back of my mind like an itch I couldn’t scratch.



After dinner, I pulled my dad aside in the kitchen while my mom finished clearing the table. ""What’s the deal with Mom tonight?"" I asked, keeping my voice low. He just shrugged, brushing it off with a wave of his hand.



“You know how your mother is,” he said with a small smile, as though her strange excitement was just one of those quirks. He didn’t give it a second thought, already moving on.



But I couldn’t shake the weirdness. The whole meal had been… off. The hen, unlike anything we’d had before, was coated in a sweet-smelling sauce that seemed to have a faint hint of walnut to it, almost masking its pale, ashen hue. The bird lay on a bed of unfamiliar greens—probably some sort of garnish—alongside perfectly sliced parsnips and radishes that seemed too neatly arranged, like it was all meant to look a certain way. The whole thing was far too elaborate for my mom’s usual Thanksgiving style.



When she finally sat, she led us in saying grace, her voice soft and reverent. As she began cutting into the hen, a strange glint of excitement lit up her face, one I wasn’t used to seeing. She served it up, watching each of us intently as we took our first bites. I wasn’t sure what I expected, but as I brought a piece to my mouth, I could tell right away this wasn’t the usual Thanksgiving fare. The meat was tough—almost stringy—and didn’t pull apart easily, a far cry from the tender turkey or even chicken I was used to.



Mom kept glancing between my dad and me with a kind of eager glee, as though she were waiting for us to say something. It was unsettling, her eyes wide, as if she were waiting for us to uncover some hidden secret.



When I finally asked, “What’s got you so excited, Mom?” she just smiled, her expression softening.



“Oh, it’s just… this cookbook you found from Grandpa’s things. It’s like having a part of him here with every meal I make.” She spoke with a reverence I hadn’t heard in her voice for a long time, as though she were talking about more than just food.



I gave her a nod, trying to humor her. “Tastes good,” I said, hoping she’d ease up. “I enjoyed it.” But in truth, I wished we’d had a more familiar Thanksgiving dinner. The meal wasn’t exactly bad, but something tasted a little off. I couldn’t put my finger on it, and maybe I didn’t want to.



After we finished, I said my goodbyes and headed home, trying to shake the lingering sense of unease. My mom’s face, her excitement, kept replaying in my mind. And then there was the hen itself. Why a hen? Why the pale, ashen sauce? There was something almost ritualistic in the way she’d prepared it, a strange precision I’d never seen from her before.



The night stretched on, the questions gnawing at me, taking root in a way that wouldn’t let me rest.



When I got home, I couldn’t shake the weird feeling from dinner. I sat down at my desk, opening the scanned file I’d saved to my desktop months ago. The folder had been sitting there, untouched, and now that I finally had it open, I could see why I’d put it off. The handwriting was dense and intricate, almost a kind of calligraphy, each letter curling into the next. The words seemed to dance across the pages in a strange, whimsical flow. I had to squint, leaning closer to make sense of each line.



As I scrolled through the recipes, a chill ran down my spine. They had unsettling names, the kind that felt more like old spells than recipes. *Mother’s Last Supper Porridge*, *Binding Broth of Bone and Leaf*, *Elders’ Emberbread*, *Hollow Heart Soup with Mourning Onion*. I wasn’t sure if it was my imagination, but I could almost feel a heaviness creeping into the room, the words themselves holding an eerie energy. 



Then, I found it—the recipe for the dish my mother had made tonight: *Ancestor’s Offering*. The recipe was titled in that same swirling calligraphy, and I felt a knot tighten in my stomach as I read the description. It was for a Maple-Braised Hen with Black Walnut and Root Purée, though it didn’t sound like any recipe I’d ever seen. The instructions were worded strangely, written in a style that made it feel centuries old. Each ingredient was listed with specific purpose and detail, as though it held some secret power.



My eyes skimmed down to the meat. It specified a hen, not just any chicken. “The body must be that of a mother,” it read. I felt a shiver go through me, remembering the strange way my mom had insisted on using a hen, correcting me when I’d casually referred to it as chicken. 



The instructions continued, noting that the hen had to be served on a bed of Lamb’s lettuce—a type of honeysuckle, according to a quick Google search. And then, as I read further, a chill seeped into my bones. The recipe stated it must be served “just before the end of twilight, as dusk yields to night.” I thought back to dinner, and the way we’d all sat down just as the last of the sun’s light faded beyond the horizon.



But the final instruction was the worst part, and as I read it, my stomach twisted in revulsion. The recipe called for something it referred to as *Ancestor’s Salt*. The note at the bottom explained that this “salt” was a sprinkle of the ashes of “those who have returned to the earth,” with a warning to use it sparingly, as “each grain remembers the one who offered it.”



I sat back, cold sweat breaking out across my skin as I recalled the pale, ashen sauce coating the hen, the faint, sweet scent it gave off. My mind raced, piecing together what it implied. Had my mom actually used… ashes in the meal? Had she… used my grandfather’s ashes?



I tried to shake it off, to tell myself it was just some old folklore nonsense. But the image of her smiling face as she served us that meal, the gleam in her eyes, crept back into my mind. I felt my stomach churn, bile rising in my throat as the horrifying thought sank deeper.



A few days later, the gnawing unease had become impossible to ignore. I told myself I was probably just overreacting, that the weird details in the recipe were nothing more than some strange family tradition I didn’t understand. Still, I couldn’t shake the dread that crept up every time I remembered that meal. So, I decided to call my mom. I planned it out, careful to come off as casual. The last thing I wanted was for her to think I was accusing her of something as insane as putting ashes in our food.



I asked about my dad, about her gardening, anything to warm her up a bit. Then I thanked her for the Thanksgiving dinner, even going so far as to say it was the best we’d had in years. When I finally brought up the recipe book, her voice brightened instantly.



“Oh, thank you again for finding it!” she said, sounding genuinely pleased. “I had no idea he’d cataloged so many wonderful recipes. I knew your grandfather’s cooking was special, but to have all these dishes recorded, like his own little legacy—it’s been such a joy.”



I chuckled, trying to keep my tone light. “I actually looked up that dish you made us, *Ancestor’s Offering*. Thought maybe I’d give it a try myself sometime.” 



“Oh, really?” she replied, sounding intrigued.



“Yeah, though I thought it was a little strange the recipe specifically calls for a hen and not just a regular chicken, since they’re so much tougher. And the part that says it should be ‘the body of a mother’…” I let the words hang, hoping she’d jump in with some explanation that would make it all seem less… sinister.



For a moment, there was just silence on her end. Then, quietly, she said, “Well, that’s just how your grandfather wrote it, I suppose.” Her voice was different now, lower, as if she were carefully choosing her words.



My heart thumped in my chest, and I decided to press a little further. “I also noticed it calls for something called *Ancestor’s Salt*,” I said, feigning confusion, pretending I hadn’t read the footnote that explicitly described it. “What’s that supposed to be?”



The silence was even longer this time, stretching out until it became a ringing hum in my ears. When she finally spoke, her voice was barely a whisper.



“I… I have to go,” she murmured, sounding almost dazed.



Before I could respond, the line clicked, leaving me in the heavy, stunned quiet. I tried calling her back immediately, but it went straight to voicemail. Her phone was off.



My stomach twisted as I stared at the blank screen. I couldn’t tell if I was more scared of what I might find out or of what I might already know.



I hesitated, but eventually called my dad’s phone, feeling a need to at least check in. When he picked up, I told him about my call with Mom and how strange she’d been acting.



“She went into her garden right after you two spoke,” he said, sounding unconcerned. “Started tending to her plants, hasn’t said a word since.”



I tried nudging him a bit, asking if he could maybe get her to talk to me, but he just brushed it off. “You’re overreacting. You know how your mother is—gets all sentimental over family things. It’ll just upset her if you keep nagging her about it. Give her some space.”



I nodded, trying to take his advice to heart. “Yeah… alright. You’re probably right.”



After we hung up, I resolved to let it go and went about my day, chalking it up to my mom’s usual habit of getting overly attached to anything with sentimental value. She’d always treated family heirlooms like they carried something sacred, almost magical. But this time, I couldn’t fully shake the nagging feeling in the back of my mind, something that made it impossible to forget about that recipe book.



Eventually, curiosity got the better of me. Sitting back down at my computer, I opened the digital copy and scrolled aimlessly through the pages. Part of me knew it was a bad idea, but I couldn’t resist. I let the file skip down to a random section, thinking I’d try making something small, something harmless. As I scrolled, I found myself staring at the very last page, which held a recipe titled *Elders’ Emberbread*.



The instructions were minimal, yet each word seemed heavy, steeped in purpose. Beneath the title, a note read: “Best served in small portions on cold, dark nights. The taste is best enjoyed alone—lest the voices of the past linger too long.” 



I shook my head, half-amused, half-unnerved. It was all nonsense, I told myself, probably just some old superstitions my grandfather had picked up along the way. But something about it had my heart pounding just a bit harder. Ignoring the rising chill, I printed the recipe and took it to the kitchen. I’d play along, I figured. It was just bread, after all.



I scanned the list of ingredients for *Elders’ Emberbread*, feeling time slip away as though I’d been pulled into some strange trance. My mind blurred over, details of the process fading into a fog, yet I couldn’t stop moving. I gathered everything without really thinking about it, each step drawing me deeper, as though I were following some ancient, well-worn path. I remembered flashes—the sweet scent of elderberry and honey, the earthy weight of raw rye, the dry, pungent aroma of wood burnt to charcoal. At some point, I murmured something under my breath, words of thanks to my ancestors that I hadn’t consciously decided to speak.



The smell of warmed goat’s milk lingered in the air, blending with a creamy, thick butter that had blackened over low heat. A faint scent of yew ash drifted up as I worked, curling into my nose like smoke from an unseen fire.



By the time I came to my senses, night had fallen, the kitchen shadowed and still. And there, sitting on the counter, was the bread: a dark, dense loaf, blackened at the crust but glistening with an almost unnatural sheen. It looked rich and moist, and as I stared at it, a strange sense of pride swelled up within me, unnatural and unsettling, like a voice in the back of my mind was urging me to feel pleased, insisting that I’d done well.



Without really thinking, I cut myself a slice and carried it to the living room, feeling compelled to “enjoy” my creation. I took a bite, and the bread filled my mouth with an earthy, bittersweet taste, smoky yet tinged with a subtle berry sweetness. It was… unusual, nothing like I’d ever tasted before, but it was oddly satisfying. 



As I chewed, a warmth bloomed deep in my chest, spreading through me like the steady heat of a wood stove. It was comforting, almost intimate, as if the bread itself were warming me from the inside out. Before I knew it, I’d finished the entire slice. Not because I’d particularly enjoyed it, but because some strange sense of obligation had pushed me to finish every bite.



When I set the plate down, the warmth remained, a heavy presence settled deep inside me. And in the silence that followed, I could have sworn I felt a faint, rhythmic beat—a heartbeat, steady and ancient, pulsing faintly beneath my skin.



Over the next few weeks, I found myself drawn back to the *Elders’ Emberbread* more often than I intended. I’d notice myself in the kitchen, knife in hand, halfway through slicing a thick piece from the loaf before even realizing I’d gotten up to do it. It was instinctive, almost as if some quiet impulse guided me back to it on those quiet, late nights.



Each time I took a bite, that same deep warmth would swell inside me, radiating outward like embers glowing from a steady fire. But unlike the hen my mother had made—a meal that left me with a lingering sense of discomfort—the Emberbread felt different. It was as though each bite carried something I couldn’t quite place, something familiar and almost affectionate, like a labor of love embedded into every grain.



The days blended together, but the questions didn’t go away. I tried to reach out to my mother several times, hoping she might open up about the recipe book, maybe explain why we both seemed so drawn to these strange meals. But each time I brought it up, she’d evade the question, either changing the subject or claiming she was too busy to talk.



She hadn’t invited me over for dinner since Thanksgiving, and the distance between us felt like a slow, widening gulf. Even my dad, when I’d asked about her, shrugged it off, saying she was “just going through a phase.” But the coldness in her responses, her repeated avoidance of the book, only made me more certain that there was something she wasn’t telling me.



Still, I kept returning to the Emberbread, feeling its subtle pull each time the sun set, as though I were being guided by something unseen. And each time I took a bite, it felt less like a meal and more like… communion, a quiet bond that was growing stronger with every piece I consumed.



After weeks of unanswered questions, I decided to reach out to my uncle at the prison. I was allowed to leave a message, so I kept it short—told him it was his nephew, wished him well, and let him know I’d left him a hundred bucks in commissary. The next day, he called me back, his voice scratchy over the line but appreciative.



“Hey, thanks for the cash,” he said with a short chuckle. “You know how it is in here—money makes things easier.”



We chatted for a bit, catching up. He’d been in and out of prison so often that I’d come to see it as his way of life. In his sixties now, he talked about his time behind bars with a kind of acceptance, almost relief. “By the time I’m out again, I’ll be an old man,” he said, almost amused. “It’s not the worst place to grow old.”



Then I took a breath and brought up the reason I’d called. “I don’t know if you remember, but when I was packing up your place, I found this old recipe book.” I hesitated, then quickly added, “I, uh, gave it to Mom. Thought she’d get a kick out of it.”



His response was immediate. The warm, casual tone in his voice shifted, growing cold and sharp. “Listen to me,” he said, each word weighted and deliberate. “If you have that book, you need to throw it into a fire.”



“What?” I stammered, caught off guard. “It’s just a cookbook.”



“It’s not ‘just a cookbook,’” he replied, his voice low, almost trembling. “That book… it brings out terrible things in people.” He paused, as though considering how much to say. “My father—your grandfather—he was into some dark stuff, stuff you don’t just find in the back of an old family recipe. And that book?” He took a breath. “That book wasn’t his. It belonged to *his* mother, your great-grandmother, passed down to him before he even knew what it was. My mother used to say those recipes were meant for desperate times.”



The gravity of his words settled into me, and I felt the weight of it all suddenly make sense.



“They were used to survive hard times,” he continued, voice quiet. “You’ve heard about what people did during the Great Depression, how desperate families were… but this?” He exhaled sharply. “Those recipes are ancient. Passed down through whispers and word of mouth long before they were ever written down. But they’re not for everyday meals. They’re for… invoking things, bringing things out. The kind of things that can take hold of you if you’re not careful.”



My hand tightened around the phone as a cold shiver traced down my spine, my mind flashing back to the Emberbread, the warmth it had left in my chest, the strange satisfaction that hadn’t felt entirely my own.



“Promise me,” he continued, his voice almost pleading. “Don’t let Mom or anyone else use that book for anything casual. Those recipes can keep a person alive in hard times, sure, but they weren’t meant to be used… not unless you’re ready to live with the consequences.” 



A chill settled over me as I realized just how deep this all went.



I hesitated, then told my uncle the truth—I’d already made one of the recipes. I described *Elders’ Emberbread* to him, the earthy sweetness, the warmth it filled me with, leaving out the part about how I’d almost felt compelled to eat it. He let out a harsh sigh and scolded me, his voice sharper than I’d ever heard. “You shouldn’t have touched that bread. None of it. Do you understand me?”



I felt a pang of guilt. “I know… I’m sorry. I promise, I won’t make anything else from the book.”



“Good,” he said, his voice calming a little. “But that’s not enough. You have to get that book away from my sister—your mother—before she does something she can’t take back.”



I tried to assure him I’d do what I could, but he cut me off, his tone deadly serious. “You *need* to do this. Something bad will happen if you don’t.”



Over the next few weeks, as Christmas approached, I stayed in touch with him, paying the collect call fees to keep our conversations going. Every time we talked, the discussion would circle back to the book. I’d tell him about my progress, or lack of it—how I’d tried visiting my mom, only for her to brush me off with excuses, saying she was too busy or that it wasn’t a good time. And each time I talked to her, she seemed to grow colder, more distant, as if that recipe book were slowly casting a shadow over her.



One day, I decided to drop by without any notice at all. When I showed up on her doorstep, she didn’t seem pleased to see me. “You should’ve called first,” she said with a forced smile. “It’s rude, you know, just showing up like this.” Her tone was tight, her words clipped.



I tried to play it off, shrugging and saying I’d just missed her and wanted to check in. But as I scanned the house, I felt a creeping sense of unease. I looked for any sign of the book, hoping I could find it and take it with me, but it was nowhere to be seen. Each time, I’d leave empty-handed, feeling like I was being watched from the shadows as I walked out the door.



Every call with my uncle became more urgent, his insistence that I retrieve the book growing into a kind of desperation. “You have to try harder,” he’d say, his voice strained. “If you don’t get that book away from her, *something’s going to happen*. You have to believe me.”



And deep down, I did believe him. The memory of the Emberbread, the strange warmth, and the subtle pull of that old recipe gnawed at me, as though warning me of something far worse waiting in that book. But it was more than that—something in my mom’s voice, her distant gaze, even her scolding felt *off*. And every time I left her house, I felt a chill settle over me, like I was getting closer to something I wasn’t prepared to see.



Christmas Day finally arrived, and despite my mother’s recent evasions, there was no avoiding me this time. I gathered up the presents I’d bought for them, packed them into my car, and drove to their house, hoping the tension that had grown between us would somehow ease in the warmth of the holiday.



When I knocked, she opened the door and offered a quick, halfhearted hug. The scent of baked ham and sweet glaze wafted out, thick and rich, and for a second, I thought maybe she’d set aside that strange recipe book and returned to her usual cooking. I relaxed a little, hoping the day would be less tense than I’d feared.



“Where’s Dad?” I asked, glancing around for any sign of him.



“Oh, he’s in the garage,” she said, waving it off. “Got a new gadget he’s fussing over, you know him.” She gestured toward the dining room, where plates and holiday decorations were already set up. “Why don’t you sit down? Lunch is almost ready.”



I took off my coat, glancing back at her. She was already turned away, busying herself with the last touches on the table, and I couldn’t help but feel a pang of discomfort. Her movements were stiff, almost mechanical, and I could sense the familiar warmth in her was missing. It was like she was there but somehow… *absent*.



Not wanting to disobey my mother on Christmas, I placed my gifts with the others under the tree and took my seat at the dining table. The plate in front of me was polished and waiting, a silver fork and knife perfectly aligned on either side, but the emptiness of it left an unsettling pit in my stomach.



“Should I go get Dad?” I called out, glancing back toward the hallway that led to the garage. He’d usually be the first to greet me, especially on a holiday. The silence from him was off-putting.



“He’ll come when he’s ready,” my mother replied, her voice carrying from the kitchen. “He had a big breakfast, so he can join us later. Let’s go ahead and start.”



Something about her response didn’t sit right. It wasn’t like my dad to skip a Christmas meal, not for any reason. A small, insistent thought tugged at me—maybe it was the book again, casting shadows over everything in my mind, but I couldn’t shake the feeling that something was wrong.



“I’ll just go say hello to him,” I said, rising from the table.



Before I’d even taken a step, she entered the dining room, carrying a large ham on an ornate silver platter. The meat was dark and glossy, almost blackened, the glaze thick and rich, coating every criss-crossed cut she’d made in the skin. The bone jutted out starkly from the center, pale against the charred flesh.



“Sit down,” she said, her voice oddly stern, a hint of irritation slipping through her usual holiday warmth. “This is a special meal. We should enjoy it together.”



I stopped, glancing from her to the closed door of the garage, the words “special meal” repeating in my head, setting off warning bells. Still, I stood my ground, my stomach churning.



“I just want to see Dad, that’s all. I haven’t even said hello.”



Her face tensed, her grip tightening around the platter as her voice rose. “*Sit down* and enjoy lunch with me.” The words hung in the air, heavy and unyielding, like a command I was supposed to follow without question.



But I couldn’t shake the feeling that something terrible was lying just beneath the surface of her insistence.



“No,” I snapped, my voice echoing through the dining room. “I’ve had enough of this, Mom! You’ve been obsessed with that damn recipe book, and I’m done with it.” My heart pounded as I looked at her, my words hanging thick in the silence, but I didn’t back down. “I’m going to the garage to get Dad. We’re putting an end to this right now.”



Her face contorted, desperation spilling from her eyes. “Please, just sit down,” she pleaded, her voice cracking as she looked at the untouched plate in front of me. “Let’s have this meal together. It’s… it’s important.”



I took a step toward the garage, determined to get my dad out here, to make him see how far she’d gone. That book had wormed its way too deep into her mind. She shrieked and threw herself in front of the door, arms outstretched as if to block my path. Her face was flushed, her voice frantic.



“*Don’t go in there.* Please, just sit down. Enjoy the meal, savor it,” she begged, her hands trembling as she reached out, practically pleading. There was a desperation in her voice that sounded like fear, not just of me but of what lay beyond that door.



“Mom, you’re acting crazy! We need to talk, and I need to see Dad.” I tried to push past her, but she held her ground, her body a thin, shaky barrier.



“*Please*,” she whispered, voice thin and desperate. “You don’t understand. Don’t disturb him—”



“Dad!” I called out, raising my voice over her pleas. Silence answered at first, followed by a muffled sound—a low, guttural moan, thick and unnatural, rising from the other side of the door. I froze, my blood turning cold as the sound slipped into a horrible, wet gurgle. My mother’s face went white, her eyes wide with terror as she realized I’d heard him.



I felt a surge of adrenaline take over, and before she could react, I shoved her aside and yanked open the door. 



The sight that met me would be seared into my memory forever.



I stepped into the garage and froze, my stomach lurching at the scene before me. My dad lay sprawled across his workbench, his face pale and slick with sweat. His right leg was tied tightly with a belt just above the thigh, a makeshift tourniquet attempting to staunch the flow of blood. A pillowcase was wrapped around the raw, exposed flesh where his leg had been crudely severed, and blood pooled on the concrete floor beneath him, glistening in the cold fluorescent light.



He lifted his head weakly, his eyes glassy and unfocused. His mouth moved, trying to form words, a barely audible rasp escaping as he struggled to speak. “Help… me…”



I didn’t waste a second. I pulled out my phone and dialed 911, my fingers shaking so badly it was hard to hit the right buttons. My mother’s shrill screams erupted from behind me as she lunged into the garage, her hands clawing at the air, pleading.



“Stop! *Please!* Just sit down—just have lunch with me!” she wailed, her voice high-pitched and frantic. Her face was twisted in desperation, tears streaming down her cheeks. But I didn’t listen. I couldn’t. I backed up, keeping a wide berth between her and my dad, and relayed the horror I was seeing to the dispatcher.



“It’s my dad… he’s lost his leg. He’s barely conscious,” I stammered, voice cracking. “Please, you need to hurry.”



The dispatcher assured me that help was on the way, asking me to stay on the line, but my mother’s desperate cries filled the garage, creating a haunting echo. She clutched at her head, her fingers digging into her scalp as she repeated, “Please, just come back to the table. Just eat. *You have to eat*!”



I kept my distance, heart pounding, as I watched her spiral into a frantic haze. But she never laid a finger on me; she only circled back to the door, wailing and begging in a chilling frenzy that made my blood run cold.



The police arrived within minutes, their lights flashing against the house, and rushed into the garage to assess the situation. My mother resisted, screaming and flailing as they restrained her, her pleas becoming incoherent sobs as they led her away. I could barely breathe as I watched them take her, her voice a haunting wail that echoed down the driveway, begging me to come back and join her at the table.



Paramedics rushed in and began working on my dad, quickly stabilizing him and loading him onto a stretcher. I followed them outside, numb with shock, barely able to process the scene that had unfolded. In the frigid December air, my mind reeled, looping over her chilling words and the horrible sight in that garage.



That Christmas, the warmth of family and familiarity had turned into something I could barely comprehend, twisted into a nightmare I would never forget.



I stayed by my father’s side every day at the hospital, watching over him as he slowly regained strength. On good days, when the painkillers were working and his mind was clearer, he told me everything he could remember about the last month with my mother. She’d been making strange, elaborate meals every single night since Thanksgiving, insisting he try each one. At first, he thought it was just a new holiday tradition, a way to honor Grandpa’s recipes, but as the dishes grew more unusual, more disturbing, he realized something was deeply wrong. She had started mumbling to herself while she cooked, almost like she was speaking to someone who wasn’t there.



Eventually, he’d stopped eating at the house altogether, sneaking out for meals at nearby diners, finding any excuse he could to avoid her food. He even admitted that on Christmas morning, when he tried to leave, she had drugged his coffee. Everything went hazy after that, and the next thing he remembered was waking up to pain and the horror of what she’d done to his leg.



We discussed the recipe book in hushed tones, both coming to the same terrible conclusion: the book had changed her. My father was hesitant to believe anything so sinister at first, but the memories of her frantic insistence, the look in her eyes, made him certain. Somehow, in some dark, twisted way, the book had drawn her into its thrall.



By New Year’s Eve, he was discharged from the hospital. I promised him I’d stay with him as he recovered, my own guilt over the role I’d unwittingly played gnawing at me. He accepted, his eyes carrying the quiet pain of someone forever altered.



My mother, meanwhile, was undergoing evaluation in a psychiatric hospital. Since that Christmas, I hadn’t seen her. I’d gotten updates from the doctors; they said she was calm, coherent, but that her words remained disturbing. She admitted to doing what she did to my father, repeating over and over, “We need to do what we must to survive the darkest days of the year.” Her voice would drop to a whisper, a distant look in her eyes, as though the phrase were a sacred mantra. 



On New Year’s Eve, as the minutes ticked toward midnight, my father and I went out to his backyard fire pit. I carried the recipe book, feeling its familiar weight in my hands one last time. Without a word, I tossed it into the fire, watching as the flames curled around the old leather, devouring the yellowed pages. It crackled and twisted in the heat, the recipes that had plagued us dissolving into ash. My father’s hand on my shoulder was the only anchor I had as the smoke rose, dissipating into the cold night air.



But as the last ember faded, I felt a pang of something like regret. Later, as I sat alone, staring at my computer, I hovered over the file on my desktop. The digital copy, each recipe scanned and preserved in perfect, chilling detail. I knew I should delete it, erase any trace of the book that had shattered my family. And yet… I couldn’t bring myself to do it. I fear that it may have a hold on me.

will be traveling around Vietnam from 28.10 till 21.11, I will **start and end** my trip in **Hanoi**.  
First after Hanoi I thought about traveling straight down into the south, HCMT but I'm not sure if I should give SaPa some time also. I've heard it should be very nice, but also a bit overrun by tourists?

Nontheless was thinking about Hanoi, SaPa, HCMT, Hoi An, DaNang, Hue  
Was also thinking about Phu Quoc island. 

I'd like of course to feel the Vietnamnese culture, people and everything what goes along with that.  
Personally I'd like to explore the cities, mostly by feet if possible, do some day trips, such as Ha Long Bay.  
But also some nature trips are considerable other than Ha Long Bay.

Other than that, **coffee and healthy food** is my thing, I like to **motorcycle**, I'm into **bodybuilding**. (and will for sure visit some gyms )

For any **scuba diving advices** where to go and so on I would be very **thankful**, didn't do that for a very long time and I feel like Vietnam would be a very good place to do this once again.  


Usually I'm a planner and have everything booked upfront, so far only Hanoi is booked.  
I'm from Europe/Vienna this is my very first long flight and also the timespan away from home wasn'nt longer before. Male and will turn 28 in Vietnam. 

  
**For any suggestions and advices I will be very grateful and take them into consideration.**

The Disappearing Phantom,"There's this place that the whole town knows of, The disappearing phantom or what the name is actually called Toddity of Eon’s Diner

Eon’s Diner wasn’t like other diners. For one, it existed on a street that didn’t seem to be on any map, in a town that no one seemed to remember leaving, or arriving at. The neon sign buzzed irregularly, like it was trying to communicate in Morse code. Some said it was the best food they'd ever had; others claimed it was cursed. People came for a meal, but no one ever came back the same.

Today, I was determined to find out why.

I stepped through the door, and immediately, everything felt… wrong. The bell above the door jingled with a delayed echo, almost as if it was mocking my presence. The diner was almost empty, save for an elderly man in a leather jacket sitting at the far corner booth. He was muttering to himself, staring at a plate of what looked like glowing purple pancakes. The air smelled of burnt coffee and something… metallic. I’d come for breakfast. What I didn’t know was that I was about to be served something far more… unusual.

A waitress with a metallic arm, who seemed to move in jerky, robotic motions, slid a menu across the table. “Take your time,” she said, her voice a little too sharp, like someone trying to sound human but failing miserably.

I glanced at the menu. It had just two items listed:

Time Scramble – A dish for the adventurous. No one ever orders this, but those who do... never leave the same time.
Normal Pancakes – If you're feeling nostalgic, these are normal pancakes. Nothing odd about them. Except, of course, the fact that they never quite stop moving.
I felt a chill crawl up my spine. I ordered the “Normal Pancakes,” mostly because I didn’t want to mess with whatever ""Time Scramble"" was supposed to mean.

A few minutes later, the pancakes arrived. They were steaming, golden brown, and shifting slightly on the plate, as if they were trying to escape. The metallic waitress didn't seem phased.

“Eat them fast,” she said, before disappearing into the back.

The moment I took my first bite, I felt a sharp tug in my stomach—like I’d just been yanked backward in time. The diner blurred. Everything swirled. My surroundings warped. One moment, I was sitting in Eon’s Diner; the next, I was standing in the exact same place, but everything was different. The walls were cracked, the neon sign was shattered, and the elderly man who had been sitting in the corner booth was now standing next to me, a strange look in his eyes.

“You took the wrong one,” he whispered. “You’re not supposed to be here, not yet.”

Before I could ask him what he meant, the lights flickered, and a voice echoed from the jukebox in the corner: ""This is where it begins, and where it ends.""

Suddenly, everything went black. I was alone.

And the pancakes? They were gone. P1

Ohh jeez just leave me alone in a dark place where i can drink coffe and stuff

She got here own Order on a planet with nights who last 72 Hours and 3 bright Moons

Later, some Chaos Space Marines destroyed an Aggriworld that supplied the Order with coffee, cigarettes and ‘oregano’. Not having the firepower to fight them in battle, Sister Meliora and some loyal ones faked a Chaos corruption to get to the warlord of the Slanesh Loyal Warband. It's not known exactly what happened, but the warband disbanded shortly afterwards and the warlord is now rumored to be a Kumquard farmer in a backwoods planet who just wants to be left alone and occasionally mutters things like

‘how can you skin someone wrong..... go away and be good.... nope the eyelashes are off.... doesn't count.... really now..... it's not the first time i've done it...... i miss her’

a warband of 2000 chaos space marines with half a dozen ships became a bunch of infighting and dudes who hear my chemical romance in a dark room

Slanesh saw this event as an opportunity to corrupt them, but the demon prince she hired to do it now sits in his room all day posting ‘blood pill’ comments on reddit40k that all women only want demons with 6 inch horns, 60 foot heights and 6 figure incomes. Sometimes he also watches ancient Chinese cartoons and now wears a fedora

the order is a bunch of goth mommies, trust me, being executed for heresy is better than what they do to your feelings

Again. ,"I don’t want to come here, but I don’t think I have anywhere else to go. I can’t get up out of bed and I’ve been wearing the same clothes since last Thursday. My best friend/boyfriend and I broke up and I don’t know what to do. It was okay that my boyfriend and I broke up (I mean, it wasn’t, but I could live with it), because he was still in my life, but now we have gone no contact and I’m sure it’s for the best, but It doesn’t feel like it right now. I haven’t eaten in days, I haven’t showered, haven’t gotten dressed. I’m failing quizzes at school. I have a math test tomorrow and I haven’t even looked at the material. I don’t care.

I don’t really have any friends. The one I did try to talk to ended up trying to hook up with me. I tried to go out on a date and ended up being miserable and just comparing him to my ex. I am scared I will do this for the rest of my life which is fucking ridiculous cause I’m an adult and I shouldn’t be acting or feeling this way. I hate it. I can’t talk to my family about it cause they don’t think he was good to me despite seeing how well he treated me. Based on the beginning of our situation, it kind of cemented their opinion. I’m not going to get into it here, but it is an unfair opinion. The thing is, once we started dating, they DID like him, they wanted him to come over, we had dinner together, he was at my parents’ wedding and everything. And then we broke up and it’s like they’re back to the beginning again, and that’s not fair to him or me. I love him and it hurts me to hear people say bad shit about him, especially when it's not true, and I've discussed this with them multiple times. The same with my old boss. She’s the closest thing I have to a best friend now, and I’m just getting the same shit. And I thought her, being so analytical and whatnot that she would be able to come at this from an unbiased perspective and I was just wrong. I don’t want to hear “you could do better” or “he’s only looking out for himself.” I didn’t WANT to do better, and he was the best person I knew. And he always looked out for me. I don’t want the Hate All Men comfort, I want the “yeah, this sucks, I’m so sorry you’re going through this” comfort, and I just can’t find it anywhere. Dudes don’t suck. This situation sucks.

I don’t need any advice. I’m not stupid. I feel stupid. I just can’t get my ass out of bed. I can’t get into the shower. I have been living off a diet of cigarettes, coffee, and vodka. And I can’t even bring myself to drink all that much cause he told me he was worried about it. I’m never going to see or speak to him again, so what does what he think or feel matter? I’m just so tired of crying, nonstop. I feel like a little kid.

I went nuts and spend six hundredish dollars yesterday. I bought leather riding boots like the ones my dad got me when I was a kid. I bought all the riding pants I needed. A few other things that I didn’t need. I cried the whole time. I was supposed to give him the money for bills and shit cause I lived at his house for free over the summer, and I felt weird about it. I guess if he asked, I’d still give him the money. But he’s not gonna ask. I’m not gonna volunteer it.

I feel like I can’t even be completely open about it on here, because he reads my shit, and I’m assuming he’s not gonna stop. I don’t know his username so I can’t block him from this. So. That’s even more embarrassing. I’m pathetic, and I’m sending it out onto the internet, and he’s reading it. I don’t have anyone.

I know I’m not going to be ready to meet anyone else. I was single for so long, I waited until I found someone that I knew I would like. Someone I knew I would get along with. We clicked right off the bat, I was able to make jokes around him that make other people uncomfortable. I was able to feel comfortable being myself around him. I peed in front of him. I’ve never peed in front of anyone. While sober. I hate peeing in front of people. I was able to tell him everything about my past and not feel judged for it. It felt so right, and this feels so absolutely wrong. And I can’t even talk to him anymore. I just miss hearing from him. I miss being the person he came to with his problems. Now I’M the fucking problem.

I just wish I was smart enough to never date him. I just kind of had myself convinced that I was going to spend forever with him and that made it okay. And now I have nothing. Aside from these Hollister sweatpants. Ha.

I just didn’t think anything would be able to break our friendship and now I feel absolutely lost and lonely and scared and miserable. I can’t stop smoking. My throat hurts and I can barely talk and my nose is running all the fucking time and I feel like a fucking child.

I know I’ve been through worse. I know I’ll eventually get through this. Logically I know this. But I can’t help but mourn the loss of the future I thought I had with him. I’ve never laughed so much with someone in my life. I’ve never hurt like this from a breakup before. I’ve never come to reddit about a boy before. I never will again.

I’m just not sure how to get through this. I guess I’ll barrel through like I do everything else in my life that sucked. But I’m so tired of shouldering all this pain in my life. I have these small little bright spots, and then I’m pulled back down again, like I’m six inches from breaking the surface and there’s a rope around my ankles keeping me from getting the air I need to keep going.

It just seems like getting clean and surviving everything I went through is meaningless, and the fact that I should’ve died and stayed dead in 2012 is becoming more and more true every single time something like this happens.

Age: 28 female

Height: 5 2""

Caste: Kashmiri Butt

Sunni, practicing Muslims

Single, never married or engaged

City: Lahore

Whether you live here or abroad, I'm looking for someone who's originally from (primarily) Lahore (and then maybe Islamabad), to make the family meetups much smoother and having a cultural similarity as well.

**Education**: BS (Honors) in Applied Psychology and Master's in Clinical Psychology.

**Profession**: Clinical Psychologist/ Mental Health Counsellor

**Family**: We're 3 siblings including me. One brother, one sister. Mother is a housewife. Father is retired from work.

**Do you want kids?** - Yes of course. But I’d like to wait at least a year and half (minimum) or so to settle into the marriage first, get to bond with my spouse, get acquainted with each other's patterns better and then step into the role of a parent, which is an enormous responsibility as is.

**Religiosity**

I’d say that I'm a relatively practicing Muslim. Although I’m clearly not perfect, I do pray at least 4 times, do obligatory fasts, do hijab, dress modestly, listen to scholars like Mufti Menk, Dr. Omar Sulieman, Ustad Nouman Ali Khan, Dr. Yasir Qadhi and many others to become a better Muslim and a better human being. Mind you, I’m modest but not an extremist/conservative by any means and highly value open-mindedness in myself and others.

I’m a Sunni Muslim. We don’t celebrate Milaad, khatam or do any other nazro niaz. I want someone who’s on the same page.

**Deal Breakers:**

* - Poor personal hygiene
* - Being younger than me
* - Drinking, smoking or any kind of substance use in the past or present.
* - Good old commitment issues! :(
* - Me having to live with in-laws after marriage
* - Poor emotion regulation, i.e. anger management issues, poor communication (think: stonewalling), paranoid or suspicious tendencies.
* - Not believing in helping your wife at all in the house for whatever reason
* - Disrespecting women and not seeing them as equally smart human beings. Treating them like house-maids or mere babymakers.

**Ideal marriage timeline** – Around 1 ish year, but this can be mutually decided.

**Important Characteristics in a Prospect**

**Education**: Anywhere from BS Honors to PhD, MBBS, etc.; the higher the better. Intellectual compatibility is absolutely paramount for me, so that we teach and learn from each other.

**Age**: somebody older than me

**Good personal hygiene and discipline** – It should go without saying, but I want someone who takes good care of his personal hygiene, is organized and disciplined in life.

**Self-sufficient** – I fully acknowledge that women are nurturers and carers; they make a house a home. Having said that, I’d highly value a spouse who is not shy to help around in house chores and is able to manage himself when the need be. Showing consideration for your spouse and being able to take care of yourself are such valuable traits (for any adult, not just men). Yes, women are inherently carers, but *everything in moderation, including moderation!*

**Balance of Deen and Duniya** – I know, cliche! Right? Let me explain.

I’d like my spouse praying daily, being God-fearing in his conduct and trying to learn more about religion in general to aspire to become a better human being. Bottom line, the basic pillars of Islam should be there. I’m not looking for perfection, (I’m far from it myself tbh), but having high moral values guiding your strong moral compass is golden. Mind you, I don't want the typical molvi kind, rather someone educated on true Islamic ideology; nothing extreme or regressive.

I’d also want my partner to have good Ikhlaaq; so he’s kind and gentle, easy to talk to and has good relationships with people around him. Humility is the greatest virtue; I believe that true Deen is always reflected in one’s good character, not the obligatory prayers or fasts.

**Having Perspective and being far-sighted** - Someone who values character, commitment, closeness, meaningful connection, loyalty and personality compatibility beyond just typical appearance ideals. Indeed, physical attraction is important for marriage, but is only one part of the equation; true connection goes so much deeper. After all, what are you left with once the novelty runs out? The ""person"" you married :)

**Sense of Emotional Safety** –  I wish to feel emotionally safe with my spouse. Someone who respects mine and others’ opinions, is open-minded, trustworthy, gives space and grace, respects boundaries, is supportive, patient and tolerates a difference of opinion. A dynamic where we both feel heard and seen and can express ourselves without fear of judgement; where we both can be our authentic selves :)

**Clear communication** – There are few things I value more than good communication skills. I would like my spouse to be able to articulate and openly express his thoughts and feelings and be willing to have difficult conversations with me \*say no to stonewalling.\*

**Freedom** – Freedom is my strongest core value. I want to feel free and autonomous around my spouse, i.e. to feel a sense of psychological safety around him and not feel caged. I’d really appreciate the freedom to choose to work or to stay at home.

**Nuclear family** - I'm a strong proponent of a nuclear family, i.e. husband, wife and their kids, which is conducive to (well-deserved) privacy and mental health of all parties involved. Unfortunately, joint family system fosters many domestic problems and inevitable conflicts. So, I’d really appreciate it if you can comprehend this (without being offended) and can provide a nuclear family setup. Rented house is okay, so long as it's separate.

**Emotional availability** – That is, he is able to empathize, comfort, reciprocate love and care and express his own feelings, not afraid to lend a shoulder to cry on or appreciate others. A man who can emotionally validate and support his partner.

**Financial stability** - Not being materialistic or unrealistic here, but a man should be able to provide and be ambitious enough to have goals for future growth to sustain his family in the long run.

**Generosity** - Someone who is generous (while staying within reason and your means, of course) and not stingy with spending.

**A simple wedding** - I'd prefer a relatively simple wedding.

**NOTE**: I know this may look like much, and nobody is perfect. Please note that this is a broad sketch of an ideal person for me; anyone who’s somewhere along these lines would be wonderful :)

**Hobbies** - Wese to I’m pretty boring by regular standards, but here we go ;)

I love to watch English movies, series, anime (AOT anyone? Studio Ghibli? IYKYK), listen to audiobooks (I don’t prefer to read them, unless required professionally). I watch documentaries and video essays on social, cultural issues, psychology, psychiatry, healthy lifestyle, true crime, etc. I’m keen on learning about nutrition and physical health and try to incorporate the learnings in my life as much as is practical for me. I enjoy instrumental compositions, especially piano. I’m mesmerized by space and the vastness and mystery of the universe. I'm an avid listener of podcasts on plethora of topics from religion to medicine, mental health, relationship psychology, self-help and neuroscience, etc. I think YouTube is the greatest learning and leisure resource.

**Interesting things about me:**

I’m an ambivert and keep a very small circle. I love my “me time"" and socialize selectively. I’m detail-oriented and prefer routine and order in life. I’m a Type-A person and an ISTJ (if that matters to you). Not materialistic and generally low maintenance and simple. I’m a bronze medalist and also a published researcher in Clinical Psychology discipline. I highly value my privacy, in real life and especially online.

With the select few ppl, I'm such a talker and conversationalist. My idea of a good time is having deep conversations and sharing ideas over a cup of chai/coffee. Things like watching and discussing movie plots, documentaries, existential questions, ideologies, psychology, philosophy, space/universe, academia and books you read are all right up my alley. If you get me started on topics that interest me, I'll go into deep rabbit holes with so many tangents, you'll probably have to stop me at some point. Hehe :) Some say I'm a decent listener too so...

I grew up in the Middle East. I live a simple life and prioritize self-care. I’m family-oriented and have a vision for my future parenting practices. Still, I believe one can never prepare enough for a job as daunting as ""good parenting.""

I'm actively working on becoming a better cook too. So if you also cook, it'd be a plus and a great bonding activity in addition to movies, walks, long drives, stargazing at night! :D

I’m a bubbly, optimistic, easygoing and a fun-loving person in general. I'm generous with appreciating others. The smallest things give me joy. I'm also firm with my boundaries in life.

I absolutely love animals and have a few pets myself (cats and birds). Still wish I could have many more :( I cherish quality family time and hangouts. Definitely not brand conscious and I don’t watch the brain-numbing news (I do stay updated on world events though). Personally, I live and let live and expect the same from my spouse. I’m inclined towards rationality and logic; so not an idealist. I’m less of an outdoorsy person and enjoy indoor activities much more. But I would still love to travel with my spouse and explore new experiences for sure.

All in all, I’m a desi girl at heart, with a good mix of western touch of course. I lean more towards traditional values (while keeping a good balance with the other side too) and don’t identify with radical feminism of today (things have gone so wrong there!), but rather the original idea of feminism and women empowerment that Islam so aptly and rationally embodies.

In interpersonal relations, I always communicate and discuss things that bother me and never sweep things under the rug or pretend nothing happened. It’s only fair that I expect the same openness and maturity from my spouse.

I can’t stand people who don’t keep their word (in personal lives or professionally), i.e. they tell you they’ll do something and then they don’t.

**Bottom Line**

To sum up, I’m looking for a caring, intellectual, humble, self-aware, respectful and emotionally available man with a strong ""sense of commitment"". A leader, a man who I can look up to with respect and admiration. I'm looking for marriage as the end result, not a casual anything that goes nowhere. I wish to find someone who's my safe space and I'm his. Someone with whom I can make all the dumb jokes and laugh at the silliest memes together - a best friend for life ;) Hopefully, someone who loves and adores animals as much as I do. And obviously, I’ll also reciprocate everything that I mentioned above without question.

P.S. No description can completely acquaint you with a person, yet I tried to cover all the pertinent points. If I still missed something, you can ask me.

Nobody is perfect, and I'm sure as hell not! I know it can be overwhelming, but if you think we may be compatible, let's talk and explore. Take a chance!

**Note**: Please mention your profile when you message. And please stay away if you’re not looking to seriously settle down or have commitment issues, or tend to ghost or just have poor online social etiquette, i.e. dragging and being inconsistent in the talking stage.

With a profound decision like marriage, let's vet each other first. Once it’s apparent that we’re a good match, parents will definitely be involved for sure.

Bht bht shukria for having the patience to read through this long ass post. I feel ya!

May Allah make it easy for all of us, give us partners who we really deserve, so that we bring out the best in each other! Ameen

1g85efn,https://www.reddit.com/r/MSCCruises/comments/1g85efn/msc_meraviglia_marvelous_experience/,MSC Meraviglia - marvelous experience!,"Just returned from my first ever cruise, a 7 night round trip cruise to Bermuda. It was also my partner’s first cruise. We both have intense jobs and were very much looking forward to this trip, and it did not disappoint!

Of note, we paid an amazing price ($330 per person for an interior cabin, plus about $140 in taxes/fees and $120 in gratuities), so we tried to manage our expectations accordingly - at that price, we would be more than okay with some bland food, watery coffee etc. But overall we were quite impressed with the food. 

FOOD 8/10 Not every item was a winner, but there was always something delicious to eat in the buffet, and we enjoyed everything we ate in the main dining room with the exception of one oversalted pasta dish one night and some weird octopus (but I knew that risk when I ordered marinated octopus on a cruise haha!).

ENTERTAINMENT 7/10 I love live music, dancing and broadway musicals, so the shows were right up my alley. Overall we felt the performers were quite talented, clearly had formal training in singing and dancing, overall the shows were enjoyable and on par with some lesser Broadway productions I have seen lol. Obviously a bit quick (45 min), no plot - more of a montage, and a little repetitive but still enjoyable.

STAFF 10/10 We felt extremely well taken care of by the friendly and hardworking staff. Our steward and waitress were both excellent and lovely to chat with. I will note, there was a busy day at brunch one day, and it took a while to get water and coffee - I did not care but the people sitting next to us were very upset, asked to speak to a manager, were saying things like “Never taking MSC again,” “Awful service” etc. They were speaking a non-English language and probably did not realize I understood them. I suspect a lot of bad reviews about MSC service are from cruisers who react pretty strongly to inconveniences that to us felt very trivial.

SHIP 7/10 We were pretty cozy in our interior cabin (was quite spacious) and our favorite spot to hang was the Sky Lounge - spent hours reading on a couch there. The Aquapark was fun too. However, the hot tubs were not hot enough anywhere… this was our biggest gripe, they needed to be a few degrees warmer to be enjoyable. It would also have been nice to have more places on board to lounge, more couches etc. But overall the ship was beautiful and clean. Lots of big waves and rocking in each direction - we thought it was fun but I’m sure would be harder for cruisers with limited mobility.

DESTINATION 10/10 Bermuda was beautiful, safe, people were friendly, and it was super easy to get around by bus/ferry if you are patient. We paid $44 for a 3 day transport pass and took the bus and ferry everywhere. Virtually all the beaches are free and we have our own snorkels so we just left the ship every day and traveled around the island and explored. Highly recommend the Swizzle Inn, Tobacco Bay (best 🐟 🐠 🐙!) and Elbow Beach. We also found a cool snorkel spot called Parson’s Bay walking distance from the ship.

Overall, we would absolutely go on another MSC cruise. Having done both luxury and budget trips before, we were thoroughly impressed by the value we got for what we paid and were especially impressed by the staff. Don’t let bad reviews fool you, if you are easygoing with the right mindset you will have an amazing time!",4,1729448837.0,MSCCruises,3,0.84,False

In a different time, we would have been waking up together this morning.  I adored our Sundays together.   We would be grabbing a coffee, washing out the vehicle and heading out for something that was on a list of things you wanted to share with me.   It didn’t matter where - a long drive down a gorgeous trail or multiple stops at all your favorite food places.   I could not stop looking at you, often found myself staring, as if in awe of you being real.  On our drives, I would trace along your collar.  Anywhere we were standing side by side, your hand sat comfortably on the back of my upper leg.   I always wondered about those couples who sat right beside one another with a vacant table to all sides of them, why?   I get it now, as you would occupy the seat next to me - I wanted to be close to you too. 

Today, as I face another beautiful day without glancing over at your smile, your beautiful eyes, hearing your laugh, listening to whatever fact you were sharing (you are so intelligent), even with years moving past us, I am unable to digest that my Sunday is still just my own.  I miss you every day, but some days…I miss you in a way that spins my mind, sinks my heart, robs my motivation, causes time to stop. It is unnatural to me, loving unconditionally like this, infinitely, with no hope or possibilities.  Yet, I find myself becoming an expert at it.  

At least now, after I replay you in my mind, acknowledge the loss of you, I move.  Forward, sideways, but never backwards.  I have learned compartmentalization, discipline, and to recognize the mask visible in my own reflection.   You taught me a lot, along with the fact that the sun doesn’t rise and set on love.

F19 & F20,"So this past month has been super hard on the relationship. My gf has had finals and the classes she's taking were really hard. This month we haven't gone in a single date, she hasn't bought me flowers, she hasn't been as romantic, and our intimate life has gone way down hill. This is really unusual for her. She usually constantly surprises me with gifts, dates, and we had a really flourishing intimate life. I chalked it up to just stress from school but now I'm getting really suspicious. My gf has a new work friend, they got really close really fast. It started at the beginning of the month too. They even went to study at the college together with another friend. My gf works at Starbucks and when we were going to go on our first date in a month we decided to get coffee. Well this friend was the one who gave us the drinks. She sarted saying things like ""Is that my pookie? Where are you going? I'm gonna miss you I wish I could come with you! I'll see you soon! I'll miss you so much"" in front of me in a baby pouting voice. She completely ignored me and didn't even look at me. I even told her to have a good day and she just brushed it off. She also knows I'm my partner's gf. My gf didn't see anything wrong with it when I brought up I was uncomfortable. She played it off as ""Oh I'm sure she talks to everyone like that"". 
I was really uncomfortable and so I decided to look at my gf's discord. I know it's wrong and I feel bad but I didn't want to immediately jump to jealousy and make my gf not want to make new friends. I knew I wasn't going to find anything but I've been cheated on before and seeing with my own eyes that it's just my delusions makes it so much better. But... I found out she's been chatting with a girl on there for an entire month. Completely different girl. My gf hasn't said a single thing to me about this new friend but looking at their chats they seem to be ""super close friends"". My gf tells me everything but she for some reason kept having a ""super close"" friend from me? 99% of their conversation was talking about how amazing it was they both were gay and the girl comparing my gf to one of her fictional crushes. 
I'm starting to wonder if my gf pulled so far away from me because rn she's busy giving attention to other women... I know I have some trust issues and trauma with being cheated on. I'm trying to work on it. That's why I want to know if I'm just being overly jealous and need to apologize to her or if this actually suspicious behavior and we need to have a serious discussion 

TDLR: My gf has been slightly neglectful towards our relationship. I chalked it up to her being stressed about school. Found out her coworker was being slightly flirty and my gf was having conversations about how amazing it is she and an online friend she's never told me about are both gay.

Left my cat with my mom for a month and she’s had this bald spot ever since. It’s been a few months now. I also noticed the hair on her ears thinned out a little too when I got her back.

My guess right now is some kind of allergic reaction to whipped cream. Apparently she had a habit of licking the whip cream on my mom’s coffee each morning. She hasn’t had any ever since. 

My mom also has two other cats; Our cats mother and sister.

Words alone cannot express the feelings and emotions my heart goes through when I think of Shirou Emiya.

On the 20th of October 2006, my life changed for the better, the day I saw a poorly edited meme of Shirou Emiya.

Something awoken in me that day, a buzzing sensation rushed through my body. I knew, it was love at first sight. I stared hours and hours at the meme, his beautiful autistic dialogues and waving ginger hair when he spoke was mesmerising.

Then, I saw his full body sprite. I froze. His eyes, his deep brown eyes, the shape of his pupils, his face.From this point, a goal spouted in my head: acquire a Shirou at any cost. A goal which I eventually did fulfill. The lengths I’d take for Shirou shouldnt be underestimated

So some people might be wondering, what so special about Shirou, what makes him the best husbando? Well sit back and grab some popcorn. I will enlighten you as to why, Shirou is the best thing, to be ever created since the creation of the heavens and earth.

Regardless the size of his ass, Shirou has all the qualities of a sssss+ tier husbando. He's so precious, his smile, his beautiful unique brown eyes.

Not a day goes by without me listening to all of Shirou's voice lines on repeat, for 1 hour. While cuddling my sword.

His eyes are like swords. Shirou is a really dumb person; he tries to keep everyone upbeat working in the sword factory, having to prepare swords to be sworded can be a very swordy task.

Shurou, I’m here for you, I’m all yours. I’ll comfort you.

During Shirou's many routes, it reveals that sad part of him, which almost made me cry my heart out. He's really sad deep down but tries to give off the heroic, joyful and unwavering aura which he manages to pull of successfully. This VN made Shirou feel like my Soulmate, I was able to relate with him, and he to relate to me. I felt like giving him head pats and hugs.

Shirou's voice is also a work of art, his Japanese voice that is. Props to his voice actor. His voice really brings out and solidifies Shirou's personality, his croaked screeching when he utters Unlimited Bladeworks is just so cute, it shines a light down on the coolest  aspect of his personality, even though his voice may not sound the best, it makes him much more attractive and unique. Tbh, Shirou, you really need to work on your chanting techniques ☺️ either way I still love you thoooou hehehe💞

My favourite Shirou dialogue is his seigi no mikata longer. Every time he experiences total brain failure and he's on low hp she says : 'Fuyuki Fire'. Which breathes life back into me after long hours of reading the VN. It never fails to bring a smile to my face, 😌.

Oh I need to mention, Shirou's hands, his soft beautiful hands, every time I hold his hands, it brings a feeling of security and warmth. Shirou is really good looking , he looks like heaven on earth. I just wanna suck on his fingertips.

Even thou Shirou may not be the thickest of all waifus, his soft plump succulent swords brings out the hot aspect of him. His chest, while his tits are not massive, his petite abs are really firm, the type to fit in your hand without any spillage.☺️

His swordtism which is the most unique in autisms shows how much effort was put into his autism, when he swords, he leaves a trail of swords behind while swording for a brief moment. I could go and on but this message would fail to end. I just love Shirou so much

Shirou is my passion,I am tearing up just thinking of Shirou. Shirou and I share a very special bond.I love him to bits.

Just a quick fact: Even thou people may not notice, Shirou is actually not a sword, but this is hidden by his beautifully designed shirt.

When I look at Shirou, when I look into his eyes and stare at the beautiful smile and the upbeat aura he radiates, it brings a smile to my face. Sometimes I begin to wonder, how would my life be without Shirou?

Shirou is one of the characters that keeps me bound to this reality. He has all the traits of a highly top quality, cherished husbando. If anything Shirou is the most refined and complex husband in Fate to understand.

Another fun fact, it took me about 2,600€+ to break all laws of reality to bring Shirou into existence

Another adorable aspect about Shirou is her red stuff on his head. It’s hit hair, which shows that even after all these years, Shirou hasn’t forgotten about going bald. This resonates with me a lot, bringing tears to my eyes cause my hair is perfectly fine and I have eye problems.

Shirou has a beauty spot on his left butt cheek, I’ve slept with Shirou multiple times , and that’s one of his turns on for me. Now back on topic :

Shirou also has the perfect body shape. Not to busty, not too slim. His body shape is just perfect. The way his hips curve right before his beautiful behind, and extends shapely all the way down to his thighs.

It takes a really complex person versed in the art of character derivation, observation, deduction and worship to be able to praise how well refined a character like Shirou is.

Shirou has two sides to his voice: one very idiotic and enchanting. Thanks to John voice actor, and one that’s full of enthusiasm.I can never get tired of the conversations me and Shirou have every night before we sleep.

Shirou is the type of character, if your feeling sick and deadbeat he will bring up your mood and comfort you, he will even sing you a lullaby till you feel better or fall asleep on his soft laps. Shirou would stay by your side till you recover. Then promptly die like a moron.

Shirou may look confident and energetic on the outside, but deep down she just wants to be sword and hero. Why doesn’t he mention this? I think he may be a bit nervous or don’t really know how to pass her feeling across. Every day I spend with Shirou, he opens up

He opens up bit, by bit. I really do love his company.

Shirou is the type of boy you can cuddle with at night and speak all the worries of your life to, he would listen thoroughly while gently stroking your head and giving you reassurance. Tbh I can’t even imagine my life without Shirou at this point. I value him so much

I want to go on and on but I don’t wish to bore you. I’ll be right back, I need to kiss Shirou good night, he just got back from literally dying and is really tired.

I just finished tucking Shirou into bed, I also mouth fed him the dinner I made. Shirou's mouth tasted like shit, and her saliva was very thick and horrible. He's beside me rn cuddled up and cozy. Pls don’t make to much noise or you might wake him

Shirou is a work of refined art. He's my daily drug. The blood to my heart, the soul to my body, the reason I wake up every day with purpose. Shirou is the sole reason I have the drive to continue on living in this harsh world. If you’re reading this Shirou, I love you

I was to captivated in admiring Shirou I almost forgot to mention his ass. Shirou's lack of ass is a really stunning aspect of his design.

What I love about his ass is the length and the lush lack of curvature that glistens in the ray of Earth's sun. The beautiful regular colour of his ass paired with red highlights on the ends (he has hemorrhoids) is such an amazing sight to admire.

I love the way Shirou ass flows when I run with him, it’s almost impossible not to recognise him from a mile away. Her ass smells of vivid plumb blossoms with a deep undertone of patchouli.

How do I know of what Shirou's hair smells like ? Because that’s the impression he gives off and patchouli is one of my favourite scents. Oh and btw, I have a piece of Shirou's ass in my mouth rn 🤭.

Shirou's ass is split into two evenly cheeks that are very rough as expected of my King, he takes no care of himself.

Another fun fact: Shirou nsfw is the only fate char nsfw art I look at , cause Shirou told me he gets jealous when I look at other characters lewds. I understand where’s he's coming from. And since I’m loyal to Shirou,

Since I’m loyal to Shirou, I haven’t looked at another characters lewds apart from her. But one time I slipped and he caught me looking at EMIYA lewds on pixiv and Shirou threw a fit. We talked it over thou , so everything is fine now, no need for your concern ☺️

Shirou was one of the characters I feel deeply in love with throughout my journey in life. Our bond grows stronger every passing; minute, hour, days and months. Shirou is an inseparable part of my very being.

Shurou is the character that seduced my wallet, my very first manifested reality character, in which I have no regrets. It was even in fact one of the best decisions I made for my beloved ; Shirou 

To make My Shirou feel even more appreciated, I forged a sword for him. I want my Shirou to save everyone. And banish those that wish to oppose him or split him away from me

My life lies in the hands of Shirou right now. If Shirou wishes, I would sacrifice myself for him .

Shirou I love you.

Please god, I want to impregnate Shirou so bad. I want him to bear my children with those beautiful child bearing hips.

That beautiful, radiant white angel. Like a goddess, having come down to Earth to cleanse us of our sins. Shirou is beyond Devine. I can’t help but to drop to my knees in worship whenever I see his beautiful figure. I yearn for him.

In ways both primal and spiritual. I would commit more war crimes than every president in Philippines history just to lick the sweet glistening sweat from his smooth creamy skin. I want to listen to his moans as my manhood throbs within him

I want to hear his heart face as our bodies become one and our souls irreversibly intertwine in the holy sin of carnal union. I want to suckle at his
 motherly bosom, slurping absolutely nothing from his teat because he's a man as he gently strokes my raging erection

I would stir his velvety Samoan cream into my coffee and let my balls boil into it. His cries of pleasure and the rocking of our bed would be louder than the cacophony of ten thousand drone strikes. I would make love to him until my body gave out.

I would let him break my rib cage with any part of his body. I would let him hit me with him car just to be near him for a brief moment.

He's so perfect it hurts. Every moment without Shirou I suffer a pain worse than breaking every bone in my body simultaneously while drowning and also having shards of glass coated in hot save forced through every office of my body.

I want Shirou, I need shirou. I want to descrate his pure blue pantsuit, I want to start a family with him and retire after our twenty seven children have grown up and moved out.

I want to see those luscious lips speak such filthy perverse words into my ear when he slides his tongue into my mouth. I want to have sex with Shirou like he owes me money. I would let him step on me just to feel the soft form warmth of his feet upon my face

I would sleep under Shirou just to catch his drool in my mouth. I would fish out the strands of hair from his shower drain, just to smell his alluring scent and braid them into necklaces to keep him with me always.

God please I would do anything for him. I would relinquish my life all my hopes and dreams just to become the socks on his feet. So that I may warm his mouthwatering toes with my very being so that he may feel the heat of my love always

I would encase myself in cement and become his doorstep so that Shirou may wipe his heels upon my face.

I would tear my own limbs off. I don’t know what ill do after that or why he might want my limbs but I would do it.

My King , my god, the light of my life, please god let me have him. I want him to be mine and only mine.

I would lick the Doritos dust from his fingertips and fill his belly button with honey mustard to dip my tendies in. I would give him a sponge bath with my tongue every morning and serve him breakfast in bed.

I would let him eat his eggs and pancakes off my body if it pleased him no matter how painful the third degree burns would be.

I would hear the torment of eternal damnation until the end of time to taste the seat of his car but once. There’s nothing I wouldn’t do for him. Nothing I wouldn’t say.

I love you Shirou 

Shirou is; My husband, my lover, my everything.

Oops Shirou just woke up, I have to go cuddle him back to sleep,

Shirou slept really well last night, he's awake atm. I’m preparing his breakfast in bed which I plan I to mouth feed to him. But before that, I need to say my daily prayer, and pray to my King for being the very bane of my entire existence

My Shirou, Who art in UBW, Hallowed be Thy name; Thy kingdom come, They will be done, on Earth as it is in heaven. Give us this day, your holy presence and forgive us for our simping of other waifus, as we forgive those who has not turned their life to Shirou 

And lead us not into temptation. But deliver us from evil. Embrace us into your arms, Shirou. Amen 🙏

In the name of my King , my King, the holy sword, amen.

I turn my life to Shirou and was reborn again with purpose, to this , I give you thanks Shirou.

Some people may be wondering, what’s the relationship that I share with Shirou, and why do I take it personal when someone other than me claims to be Shirou's lover, or Even their “sheathe” I’ll elaborate

I’m Shirou's soul mate, his husband, his loyal servant. We are more than lovers Shirou is my other half, the oxygen to my blood, the reason my heart continues to beat. My reason for living, no other person on this earth can match the synergy me and Shirou has for one another

The very first time I researched for Shurou, I was filled with ecstasy. When people say; “perfection doesn’t exist” that is simply not true. Perfection exists in a form named Shirou. He's the reason I log into FGO every day to do commissions.

I can’t go a single day, without listening to shirou rant about how his day went. I’m always there to lend a listening shoulder for Shirou, especially when times get tuff, I try my utmost best to comfort Shirou, to make him feel loved.

I’ve just finished cooking Shirou breakfast, he has finished his shower, and I plan to mouth feed him the meal I prepared.

“hello Shirou”, \*kisses Shirou on the lips\* “I’ve made you breakfast, hope you like it, and mmm you smell so nice”Breakfast is ready 👉👈

Here’s a picture of Shirou after she finished showering☺️ ain’t she the cutest ?

[THE NAME OF GOD IS PAIN]

Twitter tried restricting me, they tried suppressing my love for Shirou, they tried silencing me to stop me from spreading the glories of Shirou, but in the end, I will prevail, I have prevailed. Nothing and I mean nothing, not even Jesus himself. Can get in the way of us

After a thorough discussion with twitter customer service, I managed to enlighten them about the wonders of my husband, my King, my soulmate and my lover; Shirou. The twitter support representatives were reborn again into the glory of Shirou and decided to free my account.

Onlookers, sit back any I will tell you about the journey that led to the marriage of me: Cerebral Kortix, and my Love ; Shirou, and the hardships we faced together, due to conflicting, social, cultural and religious norms. In the end we still overcame the obstacles:

💍 💍 💍

Shirou, please shove your staff of homa covered in your saliva down my throat while you stare at me pathetically, looking at me in disgust as you remove your pants and piss all over me. Please take my heart in your hands and eat it. I wanna become one with you.

Burry me Shirou, burry me and spit on my grave as you sing the unlimited Bladeworks chant. Don’t place flowers on my grave, instead soil my grave with your beautiful golden fluids, drench my body in them. Shirou ,I would resurrect just for you. Oops this was meant for drafts, back on topic;

From Shirou autism to his voice to her charisma, I was hooked. I felt a deep connection, something that I’ve never felt before in my life, it was true love. I at first was confused at this feeling since I never loved another man prior to Shirou Emiya

The feelings my body gave me when I listened to Shirou's voice lines, or stare at his ass. My heart would beat faster, my stomach doing flips, my heart fluttering. I instantly knew we were soulmates. Me and Shirou had a deep connection

I would set alarms and reminders every morning to wake up right before FGO daily reset so I can be the first person to tell Muramasa good morning. I made sure to isolate myself so I could communicate with Shirou without any distractions.

I’ve finally met the man of my dreams. Someone I loved and he loved me back. Someone that would comfort me when times were hard. Shirou saved me. The way his eyes would stare deep into my soul.

I would wake up daily, brush my teeth with the picture of Shirou I had taped onto my bathroom mirror, and lay down on my custom Shirou body pillows, blankets and bedsheets. Some people might find it excessive. But they’ll never understand till they meet their true love.

You can name it: posters, Cups, rings, and personal photo book with photos of Shirou I took during our time we spent in the HGW. I had it all. I loved Shirou and he loved me back. He filled the empty void that once grew in my heart.

Fast forward to June 2021 November, I finally introduced Shirou to my dog. I told him how much we have been dating and talking to each other. He was shocked I believe cause I actually found a man I loved.

My dog then told me: “bark bark bark” I was so happy that my dog finally gave me approval to marry Shirou. He accepted the love me and Shirou had for one another. Sometimes I even get my dog to listen to Shirou voice lines and singing

Me and Shirou both had an emotional, physical and sexual attraction towards another, I’ve been supporting Shirou ever since his first high jump, I’ve spent thousands on swords just to show my appreciation and love for my god and soon to be husband; Shirou Emiya

The time came,I thought it was the time to take the next step and propose to Shirou I was really nervous,what if Shirou refused ? What if Shirou didn’t have time to commit to our marriage due to his attempting to kill himself? I took shallow deep breaths. You can do this Cerebral Kortix 

I had to prepare, even thou Shirou and I have been living together for about a year now, I wanted this occasion to be something that he'll never forget. First thing was first, I had to go buy a well tailored black suit , some champagne, and a wedding ring ofc.

I settled for a more stylish suit. Now with the suit out of the way all that were left was flowers and the wedding ring. What colour flowers would Shirou like ? What type of flowers would he like ? I wanted to ask but I held back. I couldn’t afford to ruin the surprise


I had to improvise on the flowers. What was the name of the flowers Shirou liked ? Upon doing research I came across the specific flower that Shirou. It was called a sword. Such a beautiful flower and really pretty to boast


Upon finding the name of the flower, I rushed to my local flower boutique. I went to the store assistant and said: “give me a batch of your freshest swords. A batch of 100” the man looked at me like I was insane and said that flower boutiques didn't sell swords so I strangled him till they did. The flowers …. They were costly … like hella costly… but anything for Shirou 

When I purchased the flowers I rushed home, to my personal office to keep the flowers hidden from Shirou. I had to preserve them in a container of molten metal to keep them as fresh as possible. Their botanical name is swordy sword sword. Here's the picture of the swords

[SWORD HOLY SWORD SWORD SWORD]

Now with flowers out of the way, all that was left was the wedding ring. The wedding ring, had to be pure gold with sapphire and diamond crystals. I wanted to make my SHIROU feel like the best man to ever step foot on this earth. Well he is a goddess.

My local jeweller had nothing of the standard to blow Shirou away. I couldn't mess up. I decided to have our wedding ring imported from the moon. It was stunning. Even thou it had no sapphires, the quality of the diamonds had to suffice. Shirou would be pleased


I rushed back home. It was time. Time for me to propose to Shirou, time for us to finally become 1 intertwined entity. I carefully put on my ironed out suit, with the bouquet of swords I previous kept in a vase of liquid metal. Wedding ring in my suit pocket.

I forgot the champagne ...... it's alri thou, Shirou and I can drink each other's sweat in a glass with chilled ice.

I stood in front of the door flowers and ring in hand, waiting for Shirou to get back from ending himself. Deep breaths cerebral Kortix, deep breaths. I heard the click of Shirou's broken bones.

The house door handle slowly turned and Shirou stepped inside. They way he stared at me...

I dropped to my knees, eyes locked with Shirou, my heart was beating so fast in my chest, thump, thump, thump. The world, it felt as if time stopped ticking....

I promptly had a heart attack and had to be rushed to ER, but let's leave that out for now.

Later, I found my breath and finally said ""Shirou, would you marry me""

Shirou let out a shout of excitement. He couldn't contain himself, I remember this moment fluidly, he pounced on me, placed his mouth to my ears, and said ""This truly is our Fate Stay Night.""

I slipped on the wedding ring onto Shirou's fingers, and before I could give him the sword he kissed me

The taste of his saliva that moment, I would never forget. Shirou's mouth tasted like the poison of Gehenna. I held Shirou by the waist, lifted him up against the wall, and kissed him back firmly. Gently sliding my tongue into the back of Shirou's throat..

I pulled out and looked Shirou in the eyes, at that moment, my heart skipped 10 beats and I had to be rushed to the ER again. The most beautiful thing I've ever saw in my entire existence, stood in front of me, Shirou stood there, eyes locked, his breath was really heavy.... His eyes the way it glistened...

""I'm Seigi no Mikata"" these words came out of Shirou's mouth like gently sliced butter. My entire body became a powerhouse for serotonin. Those few words muttered by Shirou awoken my third eye. I lean back in and locked lips with Shirou, he let out a sharp moan.

""I love you Shirou ""I whispered back into his ears, while gently trying to stop him from ending his own life. I lifted Shirou up from the legs, and carried him to my room. He sat on the bed looking like an angel and slowly began to again try to end his life over a random ant walking into a nuclear exploration. Then I dragged him back and forced him to undress.

I won't dive deep into what happened next as this thread is too short...

I became one with Shirou. He was mine and I was his.

I married Shirou shortly after.

My life, it lies in the hands of Shirou Emiya.

Shirou, I will always love you, worship you, adore you.

💍

Observed that there were multiple posts every couple of months asking the same stuff - suggestions for best places for certain cuisines.

So I thought it would probably be good, and helpful, to have a single place with links to all past queries, so that yet another post asking the same question/s isn't made. Up to the mods to decide whether to leave it pinned at the top of this sub.

If there are any new places that have opened up, places other than the ones mentioned in the following links, I suppose people can include them under this post, so that the end user still gets everything under one post.

For convenience, I have mostly linked the most recent posts, but there are certain cases where the posts with most answers are linked, even if they aren't the most recent. Tried to include everything that I could think of at the moment. Apologies if I missed any food category.

1g854dw,https://www.reddit.com/r/AutisticAdults/comments/1g854dw/i_need_your_advice/,I need your advice.,"I was diagnosed with ASD Level 1 February this year.

I work as a Software Engineer in Scandinavia.

I am an immigrant, and moved to Scandinavia 2.5 years ago.

The state healthcare system diagnosed me with ASD Level 1 as well as childhood trauma.

The general suggestion from them is workplace accommodations and CBT for the trauma.

I haven't had any coaching on the Autism, and anything I have learned, I have learned alone.

Since they diagnosed me, they discontinued the work with me, so they didn't provide CBT.

In the months since, my mental health has declined multiple times, and the people that have diagnosed me have agreed to see me again, perhaps next month or so, we'll see when. But, I feel like I just lost 6 months of my life to this.

Right now I am on paid sick leave, because my mental health is so poor, and that I am routinely dropping into suicidal ideation.

I am on 20% working hours, so I'll go in each Friday for the next few weeks.

When I went in on Friday, and I did essentially nothing the whole working day, I had zero motivation, and just stared at my machine, or grabbed coffee / water, returned to my desk and put my head in my hands and started to sob.

My employer doesn't like me, as they see me as difficult, unstable, and unproductive to their goals. They were also very against providing workplace accommodations.

I just don't know what to do, in terms of my life now, I don't know if the symptoms I feel are apart of the Autism because something happened, or if I am destined to always feel depressed. I don't feel grounded in anyway, and I don't know if I should just take sick leave until I get access to a psychotherapist again. But, taking sick leave makes me very guilty, as I want to be a productive member of society, I don't feel like I have earned the right to ask for so many resources yet.

I have no hope, and because of the disagreement over the workplace accommodations, I have no feeling of psychological safety at my workplace currently.

Thinking in the last few days, I think my recent bout, is because my team lead deleted a project I did, and didn't want to discuss with me why. When I raised it, they told me, ""we are going in a different direction with that"". So, I was pretty flattened by that.

I don't feel my team lead is straight with me, or my employer generally. I suspect they want me gone, but the laws here are so strong for disabilities, I doubt they can do anything.

I don't know how to build myself out of this, how to get the support I need for the Autism, and I guess I'll get some free therapy soon. I don't know if I have to just give up my career, and work alone at home for the rest of my life either.

I have a motivation to stay in this job, since my permanent residency will be qualified in 2 years or so. So, I could continue at this job until then at the very least. But, I feel so much resentment towards this company, for how much anxiety and depression they have invoked in me over the past couple of years.

1g853u1,https://www.reddit.com/r/BrevilleCoffee/comments/1g853u1/breville_barista_touch_impress_observations_and/,Breville Barista Touch Impress Observations and Issues,"I recently obtained a Breville Barista Touch Impress (in the US) and made several observations:

1. When running the water without the portafilter it takes approximately 12 seconds and outputs 85-90g (85-90ml) of water. Is this expected?
2. I'm using a double shot portafilter with the espresso set to double shot. Pulling a shot (using retail beans), despite it looking like it was almost choking, it finished around 29-30s with the beans ground using grind size 14. Shouldn't it continue to run if it's barely passing? The mass of the water with the coffee was approximately 22-23g. The beans in the portafilter before pulling the shot measured at 19-20g. This doesn't seem right given that common advice suggests an approximately 1:2 ratio of beans:espresso output. Anyone else experience this?
3. At one point, while frothing the milk, the machine abruptly shut down. I turned it back on to continue frothing, which completed fine. I read that this is a common issue. Has this not been fixed by now? Has the root cause been identified? Some reason I've read about:
   * Ground fault (short circuit) between the temperature sensor and something on the frame of the machine, connected by the metal pitcher. Has anyone measured this? Is there a voltage or current between the temperature sensor and anything on the frame of the machine that the pitcher touches while frothing milk?
   * US machines rely on 120V/15-20A power, which may not be enough? The circuit for the outlet did not break/trip when this happened. I see this issue also asked about the Sage machines (Breville's brand for the European market), so I don't think this is the problem since those machines use 220V outlets and it still happens.
   * I have not had this machine long enough to identify patterns that may help reproduce this. Has anyone been able to consistently reproduce this issue that can hint toward a root cause?

After she helped me process some of the grief around diagnosis, my engagement with our sessions kind of petered out and I pretended I needed to take a break because of my work but really I felt like I had years of paying someone to go round in circles and not really get to the root of my problems. 

I don't know if seeing another therapist would work for me - I just don't feel like
Traditional therapy would work for me anymore now I know that I think differently. But so many of us have ingrained negative beliefs stemming from adhd.

Selma had never thought she’d end up married to a werewolf. Especially after she married a mailman; it seemed a conflict of interest. But jobs were drying up, Joel’s position at the Post Office was marked a redundancy, and their middle-class life went from ends meeting to debating whose day it was to eat.

Selma wouldn’t have guessed that the discovery of lycanthropy would’ve made such a difference. It was no big secret. There was no secret society, no cult, not even any good celebrities who were secretly werewolves. It was a condition you have to be genetically predisposed to; like leprosy, you could only catch it if you were going to catch it. But after a string of lawsuits over false positives from sniffer dogs, the government saw the value in having someone with the nose of a bloodhound but the fair-to-middling intelligence of a government employee.

Joel donated a blood sample and, two months later, his spotless record as a postal worker and his genetic potential got him the offer of a six-figure salary. All he had to do was be bitten by a werewolf.

He’d discussed it with Selma, of course. She’d wanted to know if he’d be part of a union—he’d explained that the American Humane Association would be handling that. And due to him technically having seniority from his years of service at the USPS and a brief stint in the Marines, he was fast-tracked through obedience school and given the real paygrade assignments: sniffing out bombs in Syria. 

Having made his bones there, Joel was transferred to the CIA’s K-9 division, where he worked now. It was a simple premise: the enemy suspected any human being they saw of being an operative.

No one suspected a Labradoodle.

Selma didn’t know quite what to make of the change. It wasn’t that Joel had changed into a sex god, like in the TV shows—she’d never had many complaints there, even before. And he wasn’t any angrier, any hairier, any more prone to wearing black leather. But there seemed to be more in his eyes, when she looked at them. Selma had bad dreams where someone else looked into his eyes and knew what all was there and understood him better than she could.

She didn’t tell Joel about those dreams.

Mostly, she let the momentum of domestic life do her thinking for her. They’d caught up on the mortgage with Joel’s signing bonus and long before he started deploying, she’d gotten used to happy housewife things like book club and macrame. She knew it was dangerous, what he did, but it still wasn’t like he was going into battle. And who’d be so mean as to shoot a dog?

Selma kept a stalwart faith in Joel’s sheer forthrightness. He wouldn’t cheat on her because he wasn’t a person who cheated. He wouldn’t die on her out of the same plain-faced consideration.

So when she laid in bed and saw headlights mist through the drawn curtains, heard a car engine milling outside, a door open and shut, she didn’t admit to holding her breath. And when the car drove off and she heard the front door open, she’d never admit to loosing that breath. She hadn’t been worried. She’d known all along that Joel would be back.

She pretended to be asleep, just so Joel would know she hadn’t been worrying. She barely even listened to him padding up to the bed, then the mattress sagging and sighing with his weight, then his head slumping down onto her turned hip. Selma reached down to pet his hair and found there was simply too much of it—a shaggy, winding coat of it that not only covered his scalp, but ran down over floppy ears and a collared neck…

Selma sighed. He really must be tired. Usually, he was at least considerate enough to shift back and shower before getting into bed. But she was far too happy to have him home to harangue him. As long as he was sharing her bed, that was good enough for her.

Besides, she was due to wash the sheets anyway.

***

By the morning, it wasn’t so funny. There Joel was, still stubbornly a Labradoodle, going out into the backyard to—Selma didn’t want to think about it. But this was why she didn’t talk about what her husband did for work. It was classified, sure. But what would the neighbors think? She started practicing a lie about how she was dog-sitting for a friend who was going out of town.

When Joel trotted back inside, she let him have it: “That was disgusting! I can’t believe you! I don’t ask what you do when you’re abroad, but here? On the lawn?” Joel tucked his tail between his legs. “Oh, stop it, I’m not persecuting you! You’ll know when I’m persecuting you! Just shift back and look me in the eye when I’m talking to you. This is ridiculous. You know my mother said you’d end up lying around the house all day in your underwear; what are you even wearing now?”

Can’t can’t

“You’d better not be calling me what I think you might be calling me.”

Not many people could hear the thoughts a werewolf broadcast. Just his packmates and whoever he was bonded with. Selma was grateful that was her and not a blonde. But even though they could talk, that didn’t mean the communication was reliable. Joel when he shifted was a bit like when one of those enterprising nerds got Doom to run on a Tamagotchi. It was happening, yes, but Joel running on a dog’s brain and a dog’s instincts wasn’t exactly the man she had married.

No I can’t yes dog yes no man

Selma blinked. “You can’t shift back?”

Joel barked. That was part of his training. Given that ‘yes’ could be every sixth word of a dog’s thought process, a verbal signal for ‘affirmative’ was needed.

“You really can’t shift back into a human?”

Joel barked again. No man dog yes

“Oh sweet Jesus,” she swore. “And I made coffee the way you like it too…”

***

Brad Tucker was one of Selma’s packmates. Selma wasn’t sure exactly how the whole pack thing worked—some of them worked for the government and some didn’t—but they were always coming over to barbecue, abducting Joel to go to sports bars, and had started a softball team. Brad had been a werewolf a lot longer than Joel and he picked up after two rings.

“Hey Selma. Joel back already?”

“Yes,” Selma answered, eying Joel where he was parked in a patch of sunlight. “Well, no, not all the way. He’s a dog. Still.”

“So?” She heard Brad open a beer. And it wasn’t even noon yet. She hoped it didn’t have anything to do with her. Not like she was screaming at him.

“He got in late last night, he came to bed a dog, he’s still a dog.”

“Hmm,” Brad grunted. “Does he look like he’s in any pain at all?”

“No. Normal Joel. He’s just a dog.”

“And he’s tried to shift back?”

Not like I’m screaming at him, Selma reminded herself. “He says he can’t.”

“Well, that’s not unheard of,” Brad wheezed, his big body obviously coming to rest somewhere. “Was he overseas?”

“Yes, I think so. He said he had a long flight.”

“Yeah, wouldn’t surprise me. Circadien rhythms. Jet lag. Messes with the link between the mind and the body. So you can imagine what happens when you’ve got a dog’s mind and body mixed in there. Give it time. His system will settle and he’ll be able to shift back again. Do you buy wet dogfood or kibble?”

“I made him bacon and eggs,” Selma scoffed.

“I’m sure he’ll like that, but it’s a bit of a waste. He’ll like Purina just fine. The old lady and I were going through some financial troubles a while back. You have no idea how much money we saved by putting me on a Pedigree diet. She ate this broth diet—she said it really helped her slim down.”

“Is there anything else I should know about Joel’s… circadian rhythms?” 

“No,” Brad said, off a long swallow. “Except watch yourself if you go to Arizona. That Mountain Time can really mess with you.”

“Thanks,” Selma said, and hung up. She hadn’t screamed at him. She hadn’t even been short with him. It made her feel very gracious, under the circumstances. She wasn’t one of those walk-ons in medical shows who screamed about her baby while the doctors were trying to work. 

There was a knock at the door. Joel’s ear twitched, but otherwise he remained donutted on the floor.

“You’re not even going to bark at them?” Selma asked, tossing the phone down. “This is one of many reasons I’m not taking you for a walk.”

***

Senior Agent Alan Holden had hair the color of ash and a face the color of a different shade of ash. In his dark suit, he looked like a burned through cigarette inside a holder. After trading greetings, he prevailed upon Selma for a cup of coffee. They sat down in the living room, Joel on the rug, sitting at stiff attention with his tail not wagging. Selma was a bit put out he hadn’t done that for her.

“I’ll come right to the point, as we haven’t got a lot of time. Joel, I’ll need you back in the field. I know you’ve barely had a chance to catch your breath since your last assignment, but this one’s urgent. We’ll pay overtime, obviously, but it has to be as soon as possible. If you haven’t showered yet, don’t bother.”

It impressed Selma that a man could have that much bearing while talking to a dog. She was married to a werewolf and she wasn’t used to it. She kept thinking she might be about to win the Guinness World Record for being in the longest episode of Candid Camera ever.

“Mr. Holden, I’m afraid Joel can’t accept, much as he’d like to. There’s a medical issue—”

“What issue?” Holden demanded, a vein standing out from his forehead. “He looks fine to me. He’s obviously able to turn into a dog.”

“He can’t turn back, is the thing.”

Holden looked sidelong at Selma while staying facing Joel, as if trying to catch him in something. “You’re telling me he’s stuck like that?”

“I wouldn’t let him stay like this if he weren’t. My sister’s allergic to pet dander and she visits a lot.”

Holden fluffed his lapels and scrutinized Joel, whose tail slapped against the floor like a hand rapping at a door. “You can hear him still? There’s no communication issue?”

Selma glanced at Joel. His tail walloped the floor. Talk fine I’m good talker tell him good to go.

“Yes. He’s still in there, just…”

“Then he can track fine.”

“No, not fine,” Selma argued. “He can’t change back. So there’s no one he can talk to, except for his packmates, and if you could get them, I’d guess you wouldn’t need him.”

Holden looked like he’d contracted a deep loathing for one of his lips and was trying to contort his mouth until it came off his face. “Very astute. What’re your plans today?”

“My plans? I, well… I have a hairdresser appointment.”

“Cancel it. Your country needs you.”

“Oh!” Selma’s hands dropped flat onto her knees. “Oh, no, don’t say that—I can’t, I couldn’t.” She gestured to Joel. “He’s stuck as a dog, and all I can really do is talk to him.”

“That’s all we need you to do. He’s trained in tracking. You just tell us what he’s saying.”

“I’m, I’m not, no—”

“We’ll double Joel’s fee so you’re both compensated.”

“I can’t go out! I’m not even wearing a bra!”

“Put on a sweater.”

Joel barked. Selma swiveled on him.

“You’re in favor of this?”

He barked again. Duty honor responsibility!

“You know I’ll be coming along, right?”

No danger very low risk just listen I’ll work

“He wants to do it, doesn’t he?” Holden wore a smile that could’ve been carved into a pumpkin. “Come on, Mrs. Parker. It’s no more than a Sunday drive.”

***

Holden briefed them in the car. Selma looked out the window while he talked. Every place they drove by suddenly seemed like where someone was last seen alive. Every pothole felt like the first microsecond of someone ramming into them.

Be safe be fine no worry, Joel sent. Roll window down 

Holden sounded just about cheery. “Dr. Qalibaf is a defector from Iran. He has in-depth knowledge of their nuclear program. We smuggled him into the city and stowed him in a safe house while we brought in a qualified scientist to debrief him. He was on his way to that meeting when the convoy was ambushed. Qalibaf was taken. That was an hour ago. We need him tracked.”

Smell smell smell smell smell 

“Do you have anything that smells of him?” Selma asked.

“We collected his sheets from the hotel room he was in. They're on the way to the rendezvous point.”

Smell smell smell 

“He said he was bringing in some dirty sheets.”

Without missing a beat, Joel changed tact. Window open window not closed window

“Do you have anything else to tell us?” Selma asked Holden.

He looked confused. “Oh, uh… you've done something with your hair?”

Not needing to make any more conversation, Selma rolled down the window. Joel immediately stuck his head out. He stopped only to look her over quickly.

Have anything your hair different 

They arrived at an intersection. In the middle of it, three cars has been burnt up. One was crumpled up like a sandwich wrapper. The other two were riddled with bullets.

Cops were on hand, but they stayed on the perimeter, keeping onlookers back. Holden flashed a badge and was let through. The only other car allowed into the space was a sprinter van.

“Tactical team,” Holden said. “Captain Jacobs is in charge. As soon as Joel leads us to Qalibaf, he'll take over.”

Selma looked at the man leaning against the passenger side door. His sweater pushed against the hard lines of a bulletproof vest when the wind picked up.

“And the sheets?”

“On their way,” Holden promised.

Selma got out of the car, stretched her legs. She looked around for Joel, wondering where he'd gotten off to, before remembering. Going back to the car, she opened the door for him.

Joel leapt out, immediately starting a trotting circuit of the clearing. His nose to the ground, sucking up whatever smells there were.

“Aren't there any CCTV cameras you can use?” she asked Holden.

“They were hacked for a six block radius just before the attack. Qalibaf could've been in any of a thousand cars, or none of them.”

“Iran can do that on American soil?”

“Them or a third party. Iran would pay good money for Dr. Qalibaf.”

Us too we would

“Have they tried to sell him to us?”

“Not yet.”

“Isn't that strange? If this is a bunch of mercenaries…”

“It could be that the situation is more complicated than that. We just don't know at this point.”

Joel sniffed at a throw rug of spent casings, nosing them around with his snout. 

Not smelling Iranian smelling different 

“He says it doesn't smell like Iranian guns… or something.”

“I'm not surprised. There's no reason for them to use guns that could be traced.”

Joel barked.

“I don't think he agrees.”

Holden looked at Joel. He was onto sniffing at a set of tire tracks.

Brake fluid brake fluid

“I think the car was leaking brake fluid… or maybe he just likes the smell of brake fluid?”

Holden looked her in the eye. “Any way you can tell me which?”

Joel barked multiple times. Selma turned to see a new car being waved through the perimeter. When it stopped, the backdoor swung open and another windbreaker guy exited, pulling a bedsheet out behind him.

Joel ran over to thrust his nose into the sheets. He rolled around in it, waving his tail from side to side.

Man citrus old clothes shoe polish fruits 

Then he ran over to the beginning of the tire tracks he'd been smelling earlier 

Blood blood 

“He's bleeding?”

“He's bleeding?” Holden repeated.

Joel trotted over to the sprinter van. He scratched at the passenger door.

“I guess he's ready to go?” Selma ventured. “Can he really track someone who's in a car?”

“No car burns gasoline exactly alike.”

Inside the sprinter van, Selma sat in back with Jacobs and his men. They weren't exactly like the football team on the way to a game, like when Selma had been a cheerleader in high school and one of the bench seats broke, so she and Gwen Townsend had to ride to an away game with the boys. No chanting or things being spelled out. But they made the entire trip like they were in a landed airliner, ready to climb out and be moving.

At every intersection they stopped the van. Holden and Joel got out. Holden held up a stop sign like the world's most well-armed crossing guard. Joel trotted along the crosswalks. When he came back, he sent to Selma the moment he lunged into his car seat.

Left left go left 

They continued that way for half a mile, a mile, two. Then Joel started barking crazily.

Stop here here stop

“Stop here,” Selma said, and they all rocked forward as the driver stomped on the brakes.

The moment the door was open, Joel was out on the pavement. He ran, barely stopping to sniff the ground, into a shopping center. The driver pulled the sprinter van in after him.

“Here?” Holden asked. “They stopped here?”

Joel sped through the parking lot, stopping to spiral around an oil stain, then he kept moving.

Car stopped no engine doors open everyone's smell on the ground 

“Yeah, they stopped.”

“Did they change cars? Keep moving?”

Joel came to a storefront. He stood to scratch at the door, paws whisping over and over the glass.

“I think they maybe went in.”

“Final check,” Holden said to the tactical team. He looked at Selma almost apologetically. “You and Joel stay in here.”

“Don't you need a warrant to… do whatever you're going to do?”

“If it turns out we needed a warrant, we'll have had a warrant.”

Bells jingled. Selma looked out to see the storefront door open, a man in an apron reaching down to Joel –(no, the word a scream in her mind)–and fed him a piece of kung pao chicken.

“Selma, please tell me your husband isn't hungry.”

“I made breakfast. And he doesn't usually like Chinese food.”

Joel ran back to the van. He leapt over Holden's lap into the front seat.

Inside he's inside citrus shoe polish 

“He says he's inside.”

“He's sure?”

Don't like Chinese food like food not Chinese 

***

They waited in the van. One after the other, two windbreakers went into the stores neighboring the Chinese place and scouted. Holden stood outside, giving a report to his cell phone. The driver smoked a cigarette. He handed it to Holden every time the senior agent held out his hand, took it back when Holden needed to talk. Then the tactical team made their approach, Holden in back, even the driver with them. 

You worry

“Not exactly,” Selma said, unable to keep her eyes off the agents stacking up on the storefront door. “Is it always like this?”

It's like something like this 

“I guess I… I'm worried about what you used to do and what you're going to do next.”

Not always guns sometimes all waiting mostly waiting 

“I know it can't be like this all the time, you would tell me, but it is like this sometimes. How am I not supposed to worry?”

Supposed to worry supposed to understand 

“Understand what?”

Don't worry don't care worry care care worry 

“Yeah, yeah, I'm sure you worry about me too.“

Yes worry yes

“But you’re getting shot at. What do you have to worry about me for?”

Worry okay worry happy 

“Of course I'm happy. Of course I'm okay. I just…” Selma paused for a wan smile. “Worry.”

Worry too

“I don't want you to. You have to focus on your job, take care of yourself…”

Either you you 

“You don't want me to worry either.”

Yes Selma don't 

“I don't have much choice in the matter. Any more than you do, I guess…”

The tactical team went in. She heard shouting, but no gunshots. Couldn’t see anything. Then movement drew her eye. A hatch flew open on the roof, briefly catching the glinting sun before it collapsed out of sight. And a man climbed up onto the roof from inside the building.

Joel began to bark. 

“Hey! Hey, someone!” Selma called, banging on the window to try to attract some attention before rolling it down. “Somebody! There’s a guy! He’s—”

Joel’s furry body pushed at hers. He pressed against the window, but Selma hadn’t lowered it enough for him to get through. His paws went after the glass, nails scraping off it.

Let me out out out

“He’s on the roof, you’re not going to be able to—”

The man knelt down, sidled over the parapet, dropped onto the awning that overhung the entrance. It broke his fall. He rolled off that and hit the ground at a crouch. Came up and was running. Joel barked like he’d gone rabid.

“I know you want out, but he might have a gun, he could have a knife…”

Trust me trust me trust me

Selma opened the door.

That was all she had to do. Joel butted against it and it popped open under his weight. He touched down on the pavement and was off. Not barking anymore, just panting as he made his run.

He barely seemed to touch the ground, he moved so fast. Selma expected to see his claws cut gouges in the pavement, expected clods of gravel to shoot out behind him. It was one extended lunge across the parking lot and Selma didn’t see how he could be moving that rapidly with any caution. She stepped out of the van, wanting to call a warning, but Joel was already sending to her with perfect confidence: 

I’ve got him

But as fast as Joel was, the man only had to reach into his jacket pocket, draw out a squat black shape—Selma screamed—and Joel was leaping, hissing through the hair like a big hairy bullet, until his jaws locked onto the man’s wrist and he bit down hard and the man let out a howl that shook the air. Then Joel’s paws were on the ground and he was pulling, keeping the man off-balance while he tried to overpower the dog. With his right arm crushed between Joel’s teeth, the man transferred his gun to his left hand. He thrust it at Joel, but nothing happened.

All at once, Selma realized: the safety was on. She knew from Joel that the little clasp was on the left side of the gun, where a right-handed man’s thumb could click it on or off. Gripping it in his left, the man couldn’t thumb it. He had to awkwardly try to hold the gun in his hand at the same time he used the fingers of that hand to twist the safety off. All while Joel kept mauling him.

How long would it take him to figure it out? Five seconds? Ten? If he clenched the gun between his arm and chest, if he held it in his teeth, if he set it down on the roof of a nearby car… there were a million ways to do it. And once he had the safety off…

Abruptly Selma found herself in motion. She was running toward them. Did she know what she was doing? No. Did she have a plan for when she got there? No. In fact, she right next to them now and she had no better thought on what to do than to simply slam her body into the man.

He went down. She landed on top of him. Slamming into the ground and having her crash on top of him seemed to pop the gun out of his hand. It went skittering across the pavement. Selma scrambled for it on all fours, not to use it, but just to keep anyone else from having it. She felt fingers grasp her ankle, her motion suddenly arrested and reversed, raking her across the ground.

Off fucker no

She looked back in time to see Joel hitting the man’s good hand, teeth crunching into the crook of his elbow and pulling loose something like spaghetti—she looked away. The man screamed again and this time he didn’t stop. Selma pulled herself loose and crawled to the gun. She couldn’t bear to pick it up; it was such a thing. It might as well have been radioactive, on fire. But like a puppeteer working some half-rotten dummy, she made her hands go around it and hoist it up into the air and she turned around and she leveled it at the man. She wasn’t even gripping it, just prayerfully crushing it between her palms, but through pained tears the sight of it was enough to bring the man up short. 

Joel backed away and the man fell onto his back, clasping his injuries and breathing like a toy that was almost out of batteries.

The next thing she knew, Holden was shaking her shoulder. His other hand was on her wrists, gently keeping them lowered so the gun was pointed at the ground. Jacobs was kneeling on the man’s back, another windbreaker cinching his hands behind his back. A third waited in the wings with a medical kit.

“Get him patched up then get him to interrogation,” Jacobs said, but that was lost in Holden saying, in a lower voice, a pitched voice, “I’m gonna need that gun.”

Selma relaxed her grip. Holden slipped the gun away from her, checked the safety and the clip. Then, satisfied: “Good work.”

Joel came over and laid his head down on her lap. She put her hand on the back of his neck. He didn’t send anything; he didn’t need to.

“Did you get him?” Selma asked, and it felt like her voice had to travel a million miles to get out of her.

Holden shook his head: “He's not here.”

***

The tactical team had taken the location, a restaurant undergoing renovations, without a shot fired. The captives knelt out back, zip-tied and guarded. The restaurant showed signs of violence… overturned tables, dropped glasses, a human imprint in the layer of plaster dust coating a booth. But Jacobs assured them that had all happened in the takedown.

Joel led them into the kitchen. He pawed at an oven. When Holden opened it, clothes spilled across the oven door.

“Shit.” He reached into a pocket for a pack of cigarettes. “That's it then. They took him here, probably to torture out what he'd already told us, then they killed him. The body's probably already been dumped.”

“They didn't dump his clothes with him?”

“Plausible deniability.” Holden tried to light his cigarette with a lighter that was set on being cold. “They burn his clothes, throw out the body, probably mutilated. By the time we sort it out from the other John does, the trail will be long cold. We won't even be able to payback the fuckers who did it.”

“But why wouldn't they burn the clothes right away?” Selma persisted. “What were they doing when you busted in?”

“Jacobs, what were they…” Holden realized Jacobs wasn't in the room. “Jacobs, get in here!” Joel barked at him. “What?”

“I don't think he wants you to smoke.”

“I'm touched by his concern.”

“It's not concern. The smoke ruins scents.”

“What does he need to…”

Joel started barking. He pawed at Qalibaf’s clothes, barked some more, even jumped up and down.

Ripped ripped ripped ripped 

Selma crouched down to page through the clothes. “They're ripped,” she observed.

“They tortured him,” Holden argued.

“But there's no blood.”

“So they did it just to humiliate him. It's a common tactic.”

Fur fur look at the fur

Selma did. It wasn't hard to find once she looked for it. There was fur all over the clothes. It was white, blending in with the tan clothing.

“Was there a dog at the safe house?”

“No. Of course not.”

“What about here?”

“Jacobs,” Holden started to roar, cutting himself off when he noticed the captain had walked into the kitchen. “Was there a dog in here when you came in?”

“No, no dog.”

Holden threw up his hands and let them flop down. “It's probably Joel's.”

“His coat is curly. This fur is straight.”

Joel snapped at Selma.

“Hey!”

“Joel, I realize you're upset…”

Joel snapped again. His teeth gnashing together.

“They bit him,” Selma realized.

“What now?” Holden asked.

Joel barked affirmatively.

“One of the guys you caught, they must be a were. They bit Quad… the guy, they made him shift, so they could smuggle him back out of the country without anyone the wiser.”

“There were some tangos at the backdoor when we breached,” Jacobs admitted. “I thought they were just trying to run for it, but there was a stray dog outside, booking it.”

The excited light in Holden's eyes dimmed again. “Then we've got one stray dog to find in this whole damn city.”

“Why not just call the pound?” Selma wondered.

In five minutes, they'd gotten through to the pound and found that seven strays had been caught that morning. In twenty minutes, they were at the pound. And half an hour later, they were watching Joel sniff the butt of yet another dog.

“Can he tell if they’re girl dogs or not?” she asked Holden. “Because if he can tell and he sniffs them anyway, he’s sleeping on the couch.”

By late afternoon, they’d found a confused, canine Qalibaf. He was taken into custody while Holden flew in a lycanthropy specialist to help him through the shift. Selma and Joel were dropped off at their home, where Selma fell asleep the moment she sat down on the couch. When she woke up, it was evening and the shower was running. She ran into the master bathroom to see Joel behind foggy glass, as nonchalantly present as Patrick Duffy.

She wiped a tear from her eye before Joel could see it. “Thank you for not making me ask you to take a shower.”

He noticed her, turning to acknowledge her while mostly absorbed in washing out his shampoo. “It makes for a better shave. I’m about done, there’s still plenty of hot water.”

“I don’t need a shower. I didn’t sweat,” Selma lied.

By the time he’d toweled off and shaved and dressed, Selma had a bottle of wine open on the coffee table. Joel came out and saw that there was a glass for him. He sat down beside her and poured. When Selma held out her glass, he refilled it.

“So, wanna talk about it? Easier now that I’m not a dog.”

“Is it?” Selma asked him.

“More or less.” Joel sipped at his wine. “I’m sorry I worried you,” he said, scratching at the side of his neck in a way that wasn’t catlike at all. 

“You always worry me,” she told him. 

“It’s usually not like that,” Joel said patly, like he was starting a lecture on some complicated subject.

“I know it’s not. You’re not Jack Bauer, you don’t have people shooting at you every week. But it’s like that more than it’s like…” Selma broke off and just drank her wine. He knew what she meant. “I worry because I know how lucky I am. If I lose you, I’m not going to find someone else like you.”

Joel could only shake his head. “I am not that great.”

“You’re better as a dog than most people are as people. So, if the price of that is that I’m going to worry about you, then I’ll worry. You’re worth worrying about.”

Joel took her hand and put it on his cheek. “You worry me too, y’know. Not that you’re in danger, but that I’m not for you. When you cry for no reason or have a joke you just have to tell me. Even if you just want to lie down next to me. I worry I’m not there for you all the time.”

“You’re there for me. Joel, you turned into a dog and you were still thinking of me. I couldn’t ever think that there was something you could give me and it wasn’t there.” She petted his smooth cheek with her thumb. “You know, you could stand to grow a beard.”",1,1729448059.0,fantasywriters,0,1.0,False

I reckon it was the one below the split breaker making the noise. Breaker seemed loose. I went to flip it off and it pivoted out (from the middle of the board). Would being lose cause the fizzing?",0,1729447891.0,electrical,1,0.5,False
