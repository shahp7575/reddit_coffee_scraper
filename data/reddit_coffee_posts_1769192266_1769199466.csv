1ql1nnz,https://i.redd.it/n8jw6a6ok5fg1.jpeg,The Wegovy pill is no joke,"My doctor and I have been skeptical about the pill's efficacy, and this may all be placebo, but to me the pill is no joke. It's only day five for me but it's really packing a punch. 



**PROS**

The food noise is gone (at least I think it is). I have had no temptation to eat poorly, binge, or order Doordash. I haven't wanted a real meal in the last few days. When I've tried to eat one, I can only get through about 1/3 of it. I usually inhale my food, but it's been taking quite a bit of time to finish eating. 

Strangely, the idea of eating has disgusted me at times. I went out to get coffee/dessert with a friend on day two, and only got through two bites of it before I pushed the plate away. I just stared at it thinking ""I have no desire to eat this. I'm getting sick just looking at it."" I pushed the plate away and wasn't even tempted to go back for a second try. As a binge eater who always empties her plate, this has NEVER happened to me before. 



**CONS (depending on how you look at it)**  
As mentioned above, I haven't really been able to stomach a real meal.  I've been surviving on bananas, fruit smoothies, yogurt and protein shakes as they're the only things I can really stomach. It's gotten to the point that I've had to force myself to get something down, even when I'm not hungry. 

I constantly feel a vomity sensation in my chest/throat, but I also have GERD so the pill may just be exacerbating it. The cold smoothies and Tums have helped somewhat, will try some probiotics to see if that helps. I'm forcing myself to drink water so I don't get dehydrated and to help soothe some of the acidity. The nausea/heartburn is almost unbearable, but it's keeping my appetite in check so I'm determined to power through it. 

  
Overall, I'm thrilled that I'm feeling the pill work this quickly. I have a scale coming soon and look forward to seeing the progress/sharing with you all. Feel free to ask me questions! ",1,1769199343.0,Wegovy,1,1.0,False
1ql1nme,https://www.reddit.com/r/migraine/comments/1ql1nme/after_10_years_of_chronic_migraines_i_have_been/,"After 10 years of chronic migraines, I have been 90% pain-free for 3 months now. This feels like a miracle.","If you or someone you love suffers from chronic pain, I hope this helps. 

I've had migraines for ten years. I can’t describe to you the anger, frustration and helplessness I felt during these periods of pain. I couldn’t work, couldn’t play with my kids, couldn’t be myself. 

I felt down, depressed, and wanted the pain to just stop. 

As someone lucky enough to have good insurance, I saw specialist doctors at Kaiser & Stanford. We tried the pre-established rounds of medical treatment. The confusing thing was that most medications would work initially. I’d feel grateful - hallelujah, it’s solved! I once gave my GP a virtual hug over Zoom. And then, after about 2 to 3 weeks, the pain would return.

I tried non-medical approaches too. Diets, mindfulness, physio, chiropractors, acupuncture, breathing techniques. Cutting out coffee. Having lots of coffee. Just like the meds, they worked for a couple of weeks. Till they stopped.

I sometimes asked God (or the infinite intelligence or nature) why I was being put through this.

I met a friend for brunch and told him what was going on. He said something that frustrated me: ""If everything you've tried has kind of worked, then the problem is in your mind. Read 'Mind-Body Medicine' by Dr. John Sarno. I haven't read it myself but I've heard great things.""

I wanted to strangle him. You don't know what I'm going through AND you haven't read the book you're recommending? But I was desperate, so I read it.

The book argued that my mind and body were actually fine - the pain was something called Tension Myositis Syndrome (TMS), a distraction my body creates to handle repressed emotions. The fix was psychological, not physical.

I rolled my eyes, but I did the work. I used specific techniques to break the pain loop:

* Emotional thinking: Asking my subconscious self what was bothering me when I felt a pain sensation in my head
* Somatic tracking: Watching the pain without fear and seeing if the sensation changed
* Outcome independence: Living my life regardless of how I felt that morning

The thing is, unlike the pills, this kept working. The frequency and intensity dropped.

I’m not at 100% yet. But for the last 3 months, I’ve been at 90%.

I’m no doctor or guru. But I am surprised that it took me 10 years to discover this. I'm starting a free email list to share the exact books, videos, and daily habits that are helping me - [here](http://apoorvamodi.substack.com/)

PS: This isn't medical advice. Mainstream medicine is valuable, but this was my missing piece.

PS2: I also posted this in chronic pain incase it helps someone there - hope it's allowed as per the rules...

“you were our first choice, until we met with our last interview today. A big part of my job is to match personalities, and this was someone whose personality mirrored the others on the finance team. She seemed like she may be able to fit in a little bit more to allow for a more cohesive unit.”

I asked if anything negative stood out and they replied with this 

“ Ithink some people naturally give off a warm-natured personality, and some don’t. It’s difficult too when you are interviewing and you want to be viewed as professional. Find a way to make the process fun and invite people into your head. It puts you on their level and eases the tension that surrounds interviews. Usually, I treat interviews like coffee with friends. Doing that has always landed me the position I was after.

We just want to feel like we have an idea of who you are as an individual, rather than an employee if that makes sense.”

1ql1jrf,https://i.redd.it/elhn3gx8p5fg1.jpeg,Beginner Review of My Fragrance Collection (Mostly ME) + Need Recommendations,"I’m a complete newbie who had few designers and recently got into hoarding ME’s (feels like an addiction?). I can’t identify individual notes, I judge only opening, dry-down, performance, and overall vibe. If I say something wrong about your beloved fragrance , please bear with me.

Armaf CDNIM (Batch 06/2025) – Manly , Harsh opening but amazing smoky, masculine dry-down; even got asked if I was wearing Aventus once. Projection is weak for my batch?. Nobody can smell it after 45mins

Rasasi Hawas Ice – Absolute favorite. Super fresh, slightly sweet, uplifting, and beast performance in both projection and longevity. Now i understand the all the hype behind it. 

Lattafa Asad Bourbon – Feels like a less sweet Khamrah with a premium vibe; smooth, cozy, and great for winter evenings.

Paco Rabanne 1 Million – Very classy and confidence-boosting; my go-to for clubs and nights out, old but still relevant.

Ventana Marine –  Soapy, Fresh aquatic with a slight floral touch; some say its a clone of bdc ( never smelled ) good scent but projection lasts \~2–3 hours before becoming a skin scent.

Nautica Voyage – Overrated and underrated at the same time; pure fresh ocean vibes, perfect for errands and casual wear.

CK One – Generic fresh aquatic; used an entire bottle during office days, nothing fancy but easy to wear.

Joop! Homme – Smells like agarbatti to me; complete disappointment, can only be used during hawan at home. 😁

Acqua di Gio (Giorgio Armani) – its musky aquatic; smells great but havent worn it much to talk about performance. But yes i really like it. 

Hugo Boss Green – Excellent value for money; fresh, versatile, and easy to wear, liked it enough to buy the 200ml. 

Zara Night Homme II – got this as a gift , Invictus-style scent; works well for gym, casual wear, and even office use.

Armaf Hunter Intense – Very underrated; smells premium, performs well, and is great for office wear. Opening Smells a bit like zara home ii but still very different. Might re-buy

Bvlgari Jasmine – Found this in my sister’s drawer; haven’t used it much, planning to try layering sometime.(chatgpt told me) 

Police (Aquatic) – Nothing memorable; rarely worn.

Dolce & Gabbana The One – Got this purely out of hype. Smells hot and intimate but terrible projection; becomes a skin scent very quickly. Sometimes i cant even smell it on me. Wish it had better performance. 

Tres Nuit – Bought as a GIT clone; smells like clean detergent to me, mostly used post-shower at home.

Zara Silver – Former office favorite and got compliments; decent performance but weak projection. recently got to know its a gucci guilty clone. ( are their any good ME clones for that? ) 

Adidas Ice Dive – Cheap, generic gym fragrance; nothing special.

Decants : Afnan 9PM – Very sweet synthetic sugar bomb; not sure when I’d wear this, maybe I’m too old for it (30+).

Khamrah Qahwa – Sweet coffee from start to finish; cozy but doesn’t evolve much.

Liquid Brun – Slightly polarizing opening, then very vanilla-heavy; extremely sweet.

I’m from North, and for the longest time I thought fresh aquatic fragrances were the only ones that smelled good for all occassions (probably because of the heat?). Gourmand scents were completely new to me, so Khamrah Qahwa and Liquid Brun felt overwhelming initially. They are slowly growing on me, but I’m still figuring them out. Recently, I asked two friends to choose between Qahwa and brun, and both said none 😅 so yeah, take that how you will. Please don’t blind buy. 

Need Recommendations: Based on my taste what are your views on Jean Lowe Immortel, Rasasi Hawas Fire, Rue Broca Theoreme, Afnan Supremacy Collector Edition, and Rayhaan Lion (they say its better version of 9PM)?

We used r/roadtrip heavily while planning this, so here’s the full payoff post. October turned out to be an excellent shoulder-season window for this loop. Fewer crowds, dramatic weather, and still very drivable.

Trip snapshot  
• Dates: Oct 9–31  
• Total time: 23 days  
• Route: Durango CO → UT → ID → WA → OR → WA coast → Olympic Peninsula → North Cascades → MT → ID → UT → home  
• Style: Scenic driving, light hiking, coast + mountains, not rushed  
• Lodging: Mostly small hotels, lodges, inns, and B&Bs

[Route overview](https://preview.redd.it/apw9q0g7n5fg1.png?width=1628&format=png&auto=webp&s=2a69f0bc9234abd497d4dc270c798ff6c4b19d94)

Note: We had a family visit in Pullman, WA. Without that stop, we would have adjusted the inland routing slightly. (Pardon the duplicated letterings for stops - best I could do with google maps!)  


[High Level Itinerary](https://preview.redd.it/hyv2atpnn5fg1.png?width=2378&format=png&auto=webp&s=ea7e60eb35206f618769d1d2e6b4a00c0bc9cc2b)

What it was like in October  
• Shoulder season meant lighter crowds almost everywhere  
• Coastal weather was moody but manageable  
• Mountains were still accessible, except Hurricane Ridge in Olympic NP due to the government shutdown  
• Fall color peaked in places like Winthrop  
• Lodging availability was strong with reasonable pricing

Pacing reality check  
• Best multi-night stops: La Push and Port Angeles (Sequim). Absolutely worth slowing down  
• Right-sized stops: Hood River and Yachats  
• Most tiring drive days:  
– Twin Falls → Pullman. Longer than expected but very scenic  
– Port Angeles → Winthrop. Long day with a ferry leg  
– Pocatello → Moab. Yes, I-15 through SLC is still not fun  
• These were intentional and buffered with lighter days before or after

Standout segments  
• Capitol Reef NP as an early anchor. Quiet, beautiful, and a great way to start the trip  
• Columbia River Gorge + Mt Hood loop. Easy win with huge payoff  
• Oregon Coast near Yachats. Classic, dramatic, never boring  
• Olympic National Park. Lived up to the hype and then some  
• North Cascades drive into Winthrop. Peak fall color and empty roads

Unexpected wins  
• Westport, WA. We missed a planned day elsewhere and added this stop. Sea lions and great coastal energy  
• October beaches. Windy, wild, and empty in the best way. Sneaker waves are real  
• Small-town lodging. Friendlier and quieter than expected this time of year

 Our favorite road trip gadgets  
• 12V cooler plus a soft cooler bag for hotels. Game changer for groceries, leftovers, and farmers market finds along the way  
• AeroPress and small electric camp kettle. Perfect for scenic coffee stops. We bought fresh beans from local roasters throughout the trip  
• Offline maps downloaded ahead of time. Essential on the coast and in Olympic NP  
• Compact power strip for hotels. One outlet turns into a charging station

Who this itinerary is ideal for  
• Couples or adults traveling without kids  
• People who enjoy driving as part of the experience  
• Travelers who like balancing structure with flexibility  
• Shoulder-season fans who don’t need perfect beach weather

What we’d change next time  
• Add one more night in La Push  
• Honestly, not much. This truly felt like a once-in-a-lifetime trip

We found some fantastic boutique hotels, inns, Airbnbs, farm-to-table restaurants, farmers markets, and wineries along the way. Happy to share specific recommendations if helpful.

I completed my bachelor’s in Pakistan and my master’s in London. I now work full time as a Data Analyst at a fintech. 

In the long run, I see myself settling either in the UK, Canada where I already hold PR, or mainland Europe depending on where life leads. I come from a Syed Shia family in Pakistan. I would describe myself as culturally Muslim. I believe in God, but I am not religiously very practicing.

My parents are separated, and I have a younger sibling. I was raised in a conservative environment but over time I have come to value freedom, mutual respect, and emotional honesty. I do not smoke or vape and would prefer someone who does not either. I am not much into cooking, but I am happy to share other household responsibilities. Cleanliness and personal hygiene are very important to me.

I would describe myself as loyal, patient, and emotionally grounded. I take relationships seriously and value openness, maturity, and emotional stability. I stayed away from relationships in the past because I was not ready for marriage then. Over time I have seen that people sometimes carry emotional weight from previous experiences, and I would prefer to begin with a clean slate. This is not about judging anyone, just a personal preference for starting something genuine and new.

I believe in showing up for my partner through consistency, patience, and small acts of care. For me, love is built more through everyday reliability than grand gestures. I am a romantic person, and my primary love language is physical touch. I value affection and warmth in a relationship and believe love grows best when both people are emotionally present and genuinely care for each other’s well-being.

I enjoy staying active and usually work out four times a week. I like sports, especially football, tennis, and cricket. I also enjoy history, international politics, long walks, and meaningful conversations over good food or coffee. I take care of my appearance and appreciate someone who does the same, with a simple and modern sense of style.

My movie taste is varied. Some of my favourites are The Godfather, Inception, LOTR, TDKR, Parasite, and Goodfellas. I have enjoyed shows like Breaking Bad, The Office US, HOTD, Community, The Good Place, ATLA, FMAB, and AOT.

I am looking for someone between 23 and 32, ideally Shia, emotionally intelligent, kind, loyal, and grounded. Someone who is comfortable in her own skin, carries herself with quiet confidence, and has a balanced outlook on life. I am drawn to people who are comfortable in modern settings and can adapt naturally to life in the West.

I prefer getting to know someone gradually before involving families, to make sure there is real understanding and compatibility before taking the next step. At this stage, I am not looking for perfection, just a genuine connection built on kindness, respect, and shared direction in life.",1,1769198357.0,ShiaMuslimMarriage,0,1.0,False

1ql14fy,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskPsychiatry/comments/1ql14fy/am_i_schizophrenic/,Am I schizophrenic?,"About two years ago I started seeing things, not every day and not constantly. It was around October 2024 when I realized these things were not real. I would often see animals like spiders bugs and weird flying insects that were not actually there. I usually was not aware of it until I called my parents and they told me there was nothing there or I tried to touch them and they disappeared.

After about a month the hallucinations became somewhat stronger if I can say so. It usually happened in the evenings. I would see my dead relatives most commonly my grandma who passed away in 2016. I would have full conversations with her only to realize she was not really there. At some point I understood that it was not real and that I was imagining it, bringing it up to my parents didn't do any good as they just said im grieving, which I still kind of believe.

Sometimes I see faint human faces and bodies in my kitchen making coffee or in my room just looking through the window. In the past the majority of these hallucinations were not harmful but I have encountered somewhat harmful things once or twice back then, I do not remember both experiences clearly but I do remember the first one. It was not a person but a voice telling me to do certain things like push ups squats or make my bed or else there would be consequences I did not want to face.

I told my parents and tried bringing it up at a mental health facility but both times it was brushed off as teenage delusions. I am 17 years old and I am still struggling with it. It has gotten somewhat worse. The people I see sometimes tell me to harm myself or harm others, like my friends, saying that’s the only way to get rid of the them and make them stop. I often see people chasing me or charging at me in my peripheral vision or just right in front of me. I see uncanny looking humans with weird limbs walking toward me, it does not happen every day, usually 2-3 times a month but it's playing a significant role in my mental health and overall well being.

Lately, I’ve been having a lot of difficulties focusing because reality sometimes blurs and merges with my imagination. It’s hard to tell what is real and what isn’t, and sometimes I catch myself believing things that are clearly not true. I often feel like I’m losing control over my own thoughts. I find myself wanting to accept any explanation, even if it doesn’t make sense, just to understand why I’m thinking and behaving this way. It’s exhausting and scary.

I have tried dealing with it on my own and searched online for help but I genuinely do not know what to do anymore. Am I actually schizophrenic or is this just teenage delusions?

I love those fancy flavored coffee shop coffees like almond joy, snickers, etc. Even when I make coffee at home, I need a good bit of creaminess to make it drinkable. I cannot make it on one or two tablespoons of creamer. I'd seen someone previously suggest oatmilk instead of creamer as it was lower calorie/fat by volume than creamer, but it just made my coffee kind of watery and cold. 

Recently, I decided to research and invest in my coffee habits--to save money and have more control over ingredients/calories. I did buy a French press which I think really allows the coffee flavor to develop, and I invested in a bodun milk frother. Frothing the milk warms it and makes it somehow seem creamier. So if I use oatmilk I can have 3 oz of creamy goodness in my coffee for 50 calories/3g fat/3g sugar vs trying to ration the number of tablespoons of creamer. 

I also invested in some sugar free coffee syrups on amazon so that I can have a peppermint patty or almond joy or whatever the heck flavor coffee I want. I do add some stevia on top of the syrup because apparently I like my coffee super super sweet. 

So yeah, I've cracked the coffee code. I can have creamy sweet coffee without adding a ton of extra calories/fat/sugar. A little bit of money to get started as I did not have syrups, a milk frother, coffee grinder, or french press--but in the long run it should be cheaper than $6.50 lattes at the store (or $8 at Starbucks!) and lower calorie/fat/sugar.",2,1769197904.0,loseit,2,1.0,False

I thought all of my problems would be solved last year when I was diagnosed with Endometriosis. Prior to my endo diagnosis, I had always assumed it was PCOS because I had all of the typical symptoms. However, my gyno said I did not have it - my testosterone and thyroid levels have always been normal. I had surgery in April of 2025 to remove endo the lesions, and they placed a Skyla IUD in at the same time to manage symptoms if, and when, my endo comes back.

From when I hit puberty, I've always had thick, dark facial hair that would grow back almost overnight, even if I plucked it the day before. I also have the same dark hair on my chest, underarms, stomach, thighs, etc. (and I'm naturally a dirty blonde). The hair on my head is naturally curly, and it has always come out in clumps in the shower. My hair is thin but I have a lot of it. I expressed the facial hair symptom to my gyno post endo surgery, and they put me on 100mg of spirinolactone per day. I also stopped growing in middle-school, and stayed at 5 feet 1.5 inches ever since. My mom's side of the family is pretty tall too.

Fast forward from April 2025 to today. My facial hair hasn't changed. When I'm not on my period, I still have waves of cramps. I have acne on my chin that presents itself as unpoppable cysts. I have always slept extremely well since I was little - but now even if I wake up rested, I get abnormally fatigued around 1pm, even if I've had coffee, and take my ADHD medication. I'm also on 20mg of an anti-anxiety medication. I had told my primary care about the fatigue, and she ordered a sleep test. The result was a diagnosis of mild sleep apnea. I'm not stressed, I don't wake up in the middle of the night, and I dream nearly every night. My blood pressure and insulin levels are normal too. So I don't quite understand that. I expressed my interest in a cortisol test to my primary care doctor, but she said it would likely be pointless since I have sleep apnea, and my cortisol would already be elevated because of that.

It's starting to affect my life. I've been following an anti-inflammatory diet, and swimming at the gym for exercise. I gained a lot of weight in 2020-2021, and ever since then, with my lifestyle changes, the weight just stays on. I don't feel like myself. I barely have motivation to do anything other than work (I love my job), and watch tv.

The symptoms of NCCAH seem to align closely with what I'm experiencing. I'm curious if anything I said resonates with anyone, and if it does, what would be the first step to moving forward?

I've been working on **Pixelbound**, an incremental game that mixes idle mechanics with active mining

**The core mechanic:** You start with a tiny 4x4 pixel grid. As you mine resources, you purchase upgrades and automation. You slowly expand resolution of pixel arts you build.

**Key Features:**

* **Miner:** Let him do the heavy lifting for you
* **Pixel Picker** Automatically gather dropped resources
* **Auto-Building:** Watch images assemble themselves while you sip your coffee

I just released a playable demo on Steam and I'm looking for feedback from this community

She remembers how you like your coffee, how you wear your part, and exactly how you felt the last time you tried something new. Over time, it becomes about so much more than hair—it becomes about trust, comfort, and connection.

The industry continuously is making cuts and layoffs…in some instances.. sell offs... that ultimately delivers its listeners a crappier experience and its advertisers a worse and worse product.  
  
I do believe that video doesn’t have to kill the radio star (cliche) but it will if  radio doesn’t stop being so lazy and starts getting more creative.   
  
For small and medium sized businesses who are still entrusting radio ads as their driver of business - it’s time to reconsider where most of the world’s interest is. Radio is now not where your dollars are best spent. Yes there is definitely still an audience there, but the rates no longer align....  
...Less people are listening and listenership is fragmented like never before…In my community there’s 3 local listening options plus CBCRadio , on top of all the other obvious choices we now have with sirius XM, Apple Car Play, Spotify, podcasts on all the platforms podcasts exist .The. List. Is. Long.  
  
Times have changed….here's a bit of my personal story in radio:  
When I was engulfed in the world of broadcast marketing, I worked in a super small market of Northwestern Ontario (still here, but now helping local businesses and organizations with marketing advertising in the best ways possible) back then I was successfully selling radio commercials TRIPLE the cost of our direct local competitor. The differentiator was always the brand.. Brand is a symphony of all things, but here's some of it: the commitment to our audience, the commitment to our clientele, to make sure people were listening. Our team was working as one ensuring we were delivering local news and content that our communities actually cared about and making sure we delivered it fast and first. When a business owner or a community interviewee walked in the door, they were offered a coffee and provided a tour of our station. We worked hard to make our brand big even though we operated in a city of 16,000: we broke a Guinness world record, we threw huge contests like flying listeners to New Orleans to see Justin Timberlake, gave away side by sides. ""Big City"" promotions, but in a tiny market.  
  
Now I see that emphasis on community is dwindling as corporate becomes more and more involved with their zero-knowledge of what the listeners of their stations actually want, and as they downsize and condense their teams. The result is under served customers… when you underserve your customer (and your not McDonalds)… you lose your customer. Listeners are leaving.  
  
Small town radio..will dwindle out if they don’t change.  
Now more than ever they need to get competitive and creative… but from what I can see that’s not happening.   
I guess it’s just another form of shrinkflation. Expect to get less but pay the same (or more).  
  
Where should your business first advertise?  
It’s in your own pocket.   
  
Disclosure: This is based on my personal experience and observations. Maybe your community has a killer station? If so, let me know so I can listen in (and judge).",1,1769197752.0,u_Informal-Fig3376,0,0.99,False

Hats off to the Pineward team! The packaging is beautifully done and they clearly enjoy crafting fragrances.

I'm interested to hear everyone's thoughts and see if this influences/de-influences anyone from pulling the trigger on these intriguing scents. Overall, I really like the brand. I can have a very sensitive and picky nose but adore sampling unique perfumes. This was quite a journey.

The list is organized alphabetically. Here goes nothin'!

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

**Acadian** (7/10) - Starts off with a sharp woody scent that blends nicely into damp earth. Leans masculine.

**Akero** (7/10) - Patchouli softened with sweet apple. An excellent Autumn scent for those who love an earthy and fruity apple fragrance.

**Apple Tabac** (8/10) - This shows up precisely as promised with a honey sweet bite of apple, tobacco, and dried fruit. Imagine apple cider on a porch in the middle of Autumn. Leans feminine.

**Bindebole** (6/10) - Opens up to a masculine aroma, likely thanks to the crisp pine and warm cedar. Overall a clean yet woody fragrance where the citrus adds a touch of brightness. Masculine.

**Boreal** (8/10) - A resinous and minty fresh pine that presents a pleasant smokiness when warmed on the skin. Unisex leaning slightly masculine.

**Brokilan** (6/10) - A true pine scent. This is what I would imagine a burly lumberjack wearing on a weekend date night. Pine needles, cones, resin, and wood. Masculine.

**Bucolic** (1/10) - Powdery fresh… urinal cake? Do not pass Go, do not collect $200.

**Caravansary** (8/10) - Herbs, tea, snow-kissed fir branches. An herbal pine that hints at vanilla and floral tones. Dries down to a clean and mellow scent. Beware of wearing light colors! The perfume is a deep blue. Unisex with an herbal feminine lean.

**Clemenpine** (6/10) - Sweet citrus peel settles atop leather and fresh cut wood. Some sweetness and essences of blooms arise once the stronger scents find their place. Leans feminine.

**Coastal Veil** (8/10) - upon first sniff, it smells exactly the way you would expect a fresh pine fragrance to show up. Pleasantly fragrant, sharp and peppery. The eucalyptus sweeps through at the end, leaving a hint of earthy freshness. Leans masculine.

**Coffee Tabac** (10/10) - I expected a heavy sweetness but was met instead with a pleasantly spiced vanilla coffee bean. The tobacco, wood, and resinous properties encourage the top notes to linger. The dry down becomes an alluring sweet and spicy vanilla on the skin. Unisex.

**Cotswold** (5/10) - Smells as if a fresh pine tree spritzed with vanilla extract were on fire. This one is heavy on the smoke and hits you like the smell of a crackling bonfire. It's incredibly interesting but difficult to wear, I'd imagine. I suppose this is unisex but a scent that heavy on smoke would generally be considered masculine.

**Delfiño** (8/10) - Starts with a bright citrus peel and settles into a light bed of leafy green. She’s summery, she’s likable, she’s probably on the Amalfi coast right now. Likely an easy wear for most. Feminine.

**Eldritch** (5/10) - Dark, sharp, and earthy. Mysterious with a slight welcoming warmth to keep you coming back. The smoke and patchouli take over in the end. The sharpness in the dry down is intriguing. Leans masculine.

**Fanghorn II** (6/10) - A thick murky pine. Fir and pine needles hit the ground and mingle with lichen, moss, and wet earth. Masculine.

**Funerie** (5/10) - Earth, wood, and a hint of herb-like florals. There’s a dankness to it, likely caused by the mushroom and decaying floral and thick wood notes. The fragrance is certainly complex and one that earned quite a few wafts to “figure out”. Leans masculine.

**Greymist** (8/10) - A more sheer experience in the Pineward collection. It is crisp, airy, and fresh like facing the piny forest wind on a winter day. While it is very pine forward, it hints at a citrus element. A very clean and easy to wear fragrance. Unisex.

**Gristmill** (5/10) - Smoky and nutty wood that keeps warm with amber. Heavy on cedar. Leans masculine.

**Hayloft** (5/10) - Sweet honey and hay. This one really lives up to its promises. Very warm and sweet, leaning gourmand. I know people that would love this but I’m not much of a thick and sweet fragrance person. Leans feminine.

**Icefall** (7/10) - Cedar, pine, and sandalwood sharpened by a punch of grapefruit. Leans masculine.

**Ivymoss** (7/10) - It’s leafy, mossy, and curiously fresh. I imagine a patch of moss-coated conifers surrounding a floor of creeping ivy and mint. Citrus notes - especially lemon verbena - lace through the greenery. This may be a good pick for those who like tomato leaf notes or floral lovers looking to diverge from the norm. Feminine.

**Juniperus** (10/10) - Very herbal with juniper, rosemary, and lavender. This is what I would imagine an alchemy witch’s pockets to smell like. Settles into a beautifully botanic lavender. Herbal feminine.  
(Added note: I brought the sample with me as a travel perfume and ended up loving it more every time I used it. I’ve purchased a full bottle and am awaiting its arrival as we speak.)

**Lime Cola** (3/10) - Yep! The initial fragrance really does give a hit of citrusy cola which is very intriguing, but dries down in a “Pine-Sol-esque” way on the skin.

**Meadowmoss** (4/10) - A powdery and slightly earthy floral that vaguely and nostalgically reminds me of my grandmother’s vanity drawers. Excellent for classic and vintage perfume lovers. Feminine.

**Murkwood** (5/10) - Woody licorice with a wisp of earth at the end. Masculine.

**Nocturnis** (4/10) - Opens with a clean pine quickly followed by a mysteriously deep sweetness, likely brought forth in the hay, tobacco, and herbal/floral notes. It is then grounded by patchouli, amber, and earthen oak moss. Unisex with a masculine lean.

**Noki** (8/10) - It opens up to a mysterious sweetness, almost like a wad of mint bubblegum… in a good way. On the dry down, it offers a promised note of tropical fruitiness. The sandalwood and ambergris send some warmth and creaminess through otherwise bright aromas. Noki is an overall easy and enjoyable scent. Excellent for spring and summer. Feminine.

**Oxylus** (5/10) - Damp, earthy pine needles. Makes me think of walking through a cool misty forest after a few days of rain.

**Pastoral** (8/10) - Starts with a sweet bite of apricot that smooths into herbal tea. Think of a dried fruit plate and a warm cup of tea surrounded by buzzing bees. Calms into a lovely sweet honey. This is what I imagine Matilda’s Miss Honey smells like.

**Ponderosa** (6/10) - A sweet and buttery ponderosa pine. The sweetness is creamy from the vanilla, butterscotch, and beeswax. The strawberry lends a slight fruitiness that lingers between the pine and warm touches. Feminine.

**Revelries** (8/10) - Begins with a stimulating spiced apple that leans into rum and further spice. Oud and hazelnut add smoky and sweet warmth, respectively. If you want to smell like an Autumn market, this is it. It didn’t settle well on me and became a bit sour but may be lovely on someone else. Unisex with a sweet feminine lean.

**Shire** (7/10) - Opens up with apple-like sweetness followed by an earthy and nutty warmth from hay and oatmeal. Would be excellent as a honeyed Fall fragrance.

**Snoqualmie** (3/10) - Starts off quite piney and dried down to an almost old lady smell on me. Fir, cedar, tamarack, and resin.

**Steading** (5/10) - Maple syrup but make it perfume. Wood and hops linger beneath the sugary warmth. Imagine a syrup-drenched pancake on a camping trip. Obviously gourmand.

**Sturbridge** (8/10) - I don’t know what I was expecting with an amber-colored fragrance called “Sturbridge” but it wasn’t this. It begins with a bright fruity element from the apple and then sharpens in the presence of pine. The apple and pine combination is then smoothed over with frankincense, myrrh, and amber.

**Subalpine** (9/10) - It starts out very pine forward, as the name suggests. The pepper comes through nicely just behind the fir. This feels true unisex and wears on the sheer side.

**Tome** (5/10) - Sweet leathery vanilla. This would be a good fragrance for those who love the smell of old books on a rainy day.

**Treacle** (3/10) - As the name suggests, it is very thick and sweet. This would be a gourmand-lover’s treat with molasses, tobacco, and raisin reigning supreme. Not for me, definitely for someone else.

**Velvetine** (8/10) - You’re faced initially with a beautiful vanilla aroma as if opening a bottle of extract. A hint of clove creeps through as it is warmed further by wood, amber, and ambergris. Perfect for winter.

**White Fir** (8/10) - A very pleasant first whiff! This fragrance is brighter than most of its siblings thanks to orange, ginger, and vetiver. The bright notes play well with the sharp, fresh pine. Some spiced notes calm the brighter levels, bringing it lightly back down to earth. This could be a year-round fragrance. Unisex but leans slightly feminine.

**Christmas/Winter (2025):**

**Christmas Wine** (8/10) - Tart, spicy, and herbal. The pine, juniper berry, and spices take center stage at the finish. A fragrance for those who would prefer to smell like Yule over Christmas. Deep fruity feminine. 

**Gingerbread** (9/10) - It smells *exactly* as promised. Imagine the aroma of a baked gingerbread cookie: festive, classic, and endearing. If you want to smell like the epitome of holiday baking, this is the way to do it. Settles into the skin with a sweet and spicy ginger. Even with the description in mind, I do find that it settles slightly more mature than one might assume. Could be unisex, but with mom’s baking in mind. 

**Glühwein** (8/10) - A bit sweeter than its Christmas Wine cousin. If you give it a moment to settle on the skin, Glühwein will transform from grape-like fruitiness to a deeper winter berry with a mild hint of winter greenery. This is the sweet winter digestif of fragrance. Deep fruity feminine. 

**Sugar Plum** (7/10) - Sweet, plummy, and cute. It reminds me somehow of the color purple with a rounded fruity note topped with sugar. Sweet feminine.

**Additional Notes if you’ve made it this far:**

Very recently, I ended up purchasing a full bottle of Juniperus in preparation for spring as well as a small bottle of Gingerbread. I’m sitting on Coffee Tabac and Velvetine as I continue to explore spiced vanilla fragrances. Though I tend not to label myself as much of a gourmand-lover, my propensity toward Gingerbread and Coffee Tabac have me thinking I should be exploring more non-cloying gourmands.  

A family member of mine is a huge fan of Apple Tabac and Sugar Plum, both of which are lightly sweet and fruity. They smell lovely on her.

However, I have time to think now so why not.

Predicament: I own and enjoy the original Elements tech brief (the one with detachable backpack straps, not integrated and stowable ones). I had used this in grad school and it was really nice on days I had a computer or a tablet to carry and not much else (maybe a water bottle and an extra canvas tote. I still like the bag and think it would be functional for me I am tempted to add an additional bag, ie a tote or another shoulder/hand carry option. Is two bags ridiculous? Yes? But... maybe no? 

Idea #1 Alpaka elements tote (M or L) I have had my eye on this for a while, looks clean, can match with my other Alpaka bag. Flimsy magnetic closing mechanism with no zipper and slippery handles that may just fall short under a bulky pack. These all make me hesitant even if it is still the best price category.

Idea # The rest of them... I wont go through all the other brands because honestly I feel like I have looked at all of them and I cannot pick one that makes ideal sense for the use case of secondary catch all tote.

\- zipper to close

\- small handle + shoulder loops or small handle + cross body

\- clean looking enough for an office setting

\- 15-25L

\- a price that is max $100, I know this is a tall order and might not be reachable. 

I want to carry my lunch, my coffee and water, maybe some groceries, gym clothes, sweater, or other bulky things. 

Is this a bag that exists? Am I asking too much for a secondary bag? Is it foolish to want to carry all that into the office and look like a guy going to the airport? Just find a backpack dude?

Apologies.  
  
That framing is not wrong, but it often feels incomplete.   
  
Humans have always tried to regulate how they feel. That part is not new. What is new is the environment we are doing it in.   
  
For most of history, stress was situational. Something happened, the body reacted, and then it passed. Today stress feels ambient. It lives in phones, jobs, news cycles, constant comparison, and the ongoing pressure to be productive and improving.   
  
A lot of mainstream mental health language points to this idea. Awareness is often described as the first step. The nervous system responds to its environment. That language can sound corny at first, but it becomes harder to dismiss once it is actually observed in daily life.   
  
Human nervous systems did not evolve for constant input and constant comparison. So it is not surprising that people reach for whatever helps shift their internal state. Coffee, alcohol, work, scrolling, medications, achievement, distraction. That does not automatically mean pathology. In many cases, it may simply be adaptation.  
  
 A growing perspective is that much of what we call mental illness may actually be friction between an old biological system and a very new way of living.  
  
 The next phase of mental health may not be about eliminating uncomfortable emotions or optimizing ourselves out of them. It may be about understanding what these reactions are responding to in the first place, and creating environments that allow for regulation, connection, and recovery.  
  
For those who have begun making steps toward healing and awareness, sharing what has helped can matter more than it seems. Humans have always built upon each other’s knowledge and experience. It is one of the things that makes us resilient and powerful as a species.

1ql0v4q,https://www.reddit.com/r/JUSTNOMIL/comments/1ql0v4q/mil_insists_on_helping_with_the_kids_but_has_no/,MIL insists on helping with the kids but has no follow-through or ability to be on time.,"TL;DR MIL insisted on watching kids in early morning for my surgery, still decided to get black out drunk the night before making me an hour late. 

**Background:**

My MIL is an extremely jealous person. Any time she hears that my mom or dad is watching the kids she gets all huffy with my wife and says that *she* could have watched the kids (even though she was literally busy or out of town). In reality she sees and watches the kids plenty.


My MIL also has a **drinking problem.** She is *never* awake before 9AM, and never off the couch/bed before 11AM (normally more like 1PM). If she goes out to dinner, she is *guaranteed* to over-drink, and magically have ""food poisoning"" the next morning. As she lacks *any* accountability, it's always ""food poisoning"" and everyone in her family is too afraid to put her straight. She regularly guilts FIL to come home from work (45 min commute) to bring her lunch because she is too ""sick"" to get off her fucking ass and make or even get food delivered. Yes, her husband spends an extra 1:30+ in the car during the workday to bring her lunch because she is such a lazy piece of shit.


**Surgery and Babysitting:**

FIL and MIL are over for dinner, and we tell them that I have to have a pretty major surgery in a few weeks. It's at 9AM, more than an hour away, and my wife will have to drive me obviously. MIL instantly volunteers to watch the kids. My wife told her she'd have to be over *before* 7AM. MIL acted like it was nothing. I suggested she stay the night before, MIL said no since they had dinner plans (I didn't understand how that would interfere with sleeping at our house...).

So the morning of the surgery comes and my wife texts MIL at 6:45, no answer. 7AM, no answer. By 7:15 my wife is calling MIL and FIL, no answer. By ~7:20 we get desperate and I finally call *my mom*, apologizing profusely, and ask her to come over. She comes as fast as she can, but still doesn't get there until about 8AM, and we bolt it.

8:15 my wife gets a call from MIL. No apology or explanation, just excuses. ""How could *you* expect me to be there that early when *you knew* I had dinner plans the night before?"" ""Why did you need to leave so early anyways?"" ""You probably don't even have any coffee brewing for me."" On and on.

Around 8:30 FIL calls on his way to work and 'explains' that MIL has the infamous ""food poisoning"" and that also, uh, unrelated, she drank two bottles of wine at dinner last night, so ""please go easy on her.""

My mom had her own dr. apt around 11, so unfortunately MIL still needed to come by 10:30. I was in surgery, but my wife retells that MIL *also* couldn't get there on time for that so *my dad had to drive all the way to my house and watch the kids for 20 minutes so my mom could leave.*",16,1769197554.0,JUSTNOMIL,13,0.94,False

The deadline's looming, your boss is breathing down your neck, or maybe you're just drowning in everyday chaos. And here's what nobody tells you: it's not just ""stress."" Your brain is literally rewiring itself to handle pressure worse each time you crack.

I spent months diving into the science behind this, reading everything from neuroscience papers to Navy SEAL training manuals, listening to performance psychologists break down what actually separates people who thrive under pressure from those who melt. And honestly? Most advice out there is useless garbage. ""Just breathe"" doesn't cut it when your entire world feels like it's on fire.

But here's the thing. Your brain cracking under pressure isn't a character flaw. It's biology. It's learned patterns. It's your nervous system doing exactly what it's been trained to do. The good news? You can retrain it. And no, it doesn't require becoming some zen monk or pretending stress doesn't exist.

## Step 1: Stop Fighting Your Stress Response (Seriously)

Here's where everyone gets it wrong. Your body's stress response, that fight or flight thing, isn't the enemy. It's a performance enhancer that got a bad reputation. Stanford psychologist Kelly McGonigal literally wrote the book on this (The Upside of Stress, won multiple awards, completely flipped the script on stress research). 

When your heart races before a big presentation, that's not panic. That's your body sending oxygen and energy where you need it. The problem is when you interpret it as ""I'm falling apart"" instead of ""I'm getting ready.""

Reframe it like this: Next time pressure hits and your body responds, say out loud, ""This is my body helping me perform."" Sounds stupid, feels stupid at first, but the research is wild. People who view stress as helpful actually perform better AND recover faster. Your interpretation of the physical response literally changes how your body handles it.

## Step 2: Build Your Stress Tolerance Through Micro Exposures

Your brain is like a muscle, except it's not, but you get the idea. You can't just suddenly handle massive pressure if you've been living in your comfort zone 24/7. Navy SEALs don't just wake up one day able to handle insane situations. They practice getting uncomfortable in controlled doses.

Try this: Deliberately put yourself in mildly stressful situations. Cold showers (yeah, I know, everyone says this, but it works). Public speaking at small meetups. Difficult conversations you've been avoiding. High intensity workouts where you push past comfortable.

The neuroscience is simple. Each time you face moderate stress and don't die, your brain updates its threat assessment. Gradually, what used to send you into panic mode becomes manageable. But you have to actually do it, not just think about it.

Tool rec: Check out the Wim Hof Method app. It combines breathing techniques with cold exposure. Sounds like wellness BS, but Wim Hof literally had his immune response studied at Radboud University and the results were insane. The app teaches you to control your stress response through gradual exposure. Start with the breathing exercises, work up to cold showers.

## Step 3: Create Pre-Performance Rituals That Anchor You

Athletes do this religiously. Before high pressure moments, they have specific routines. Not superstitions, actual neurological anchors that signal to their brain ""we've done this before, we know what happens next.""

Michael Jordan wore his college practice shorts under his NBA uniform every game. Serena Williams bounces the ball exactly five times before her first serve, twice before her second. These aren't quirks, they're neural shortcuts.

Build your own: Before any high pressure situation, do the exact same sequence. Could be three deep breaths, touching your thumb to each finger, saying a specific phrase, whatever. The key is consistency. Do it before everything that matters until your brain associates that ritual with ""time to perform.""

I use a specific breathing pattern (4 count in, 4 hold, 6 out, 2 hold) before anything stressful. Did it before small stuff first, now my brain automatically shifts gears when I start the pattern.

## Step 4: Train Your Brain to Stay Present Under Fire

When pressure hits, your brain time travels. You're worried about what might happen (future) or replaying what already went wrong (past). Meanwhile, the actual present moment where you could be handling shit gets ignored.

Mindfulness isn't hippie nonsense: The US Marine Corps literally added mindfulness training to their combat prep after studies showed it improved decision making under extreme stress. Not because it makes you calm, but because it keeps your brain from spiraling.

Daily practice that actually works: Download Insight Timer (it's free, has like 100,000 guided meditations). Start with 5 minutes daily of a simple body scan or breath focus meditation. Not to relax, but to train your brain to notice when it's time traveling and pull it back to now.

When pressure hits in real life, you'll catch yourself spiraling faster and redirect. That's the skill. Not some magical calm, just the ability to notice ""oh, I'm catastrophizing about tomorrow instead of handling right now.""

## Step 5: Controllables vs Uncontrollables Framework

This comes straight from Stoic philosophy but also modern sports psychology. Your brain cracks under pressure partly because it's trying to control everything, including shit that's literally impossible to control.

Make two lists for any pressure situation:

Can control: My preparation, my effort, my response, my attitude, my next action.

Cannot control: Other people's reactions, outcomes, past events, future possibilities, what others think.

Pour 100% of your mental energy into the first list. Completely ignore the second list. Sounds simple, but most people waste 80% of their mental bandwidth on things they cannot control, then wonder why they crack.

Book rec:[ The Obstacle Is the Way](https://www.amazon.com/Obstacle-Way-Timeless-Turning-Triumph/dp/1591846358) by Ryan Holiday. He's basically the guy who made Stoicism trendy again, but this book is legitimately useful, not just philosophy porn. It breaks down how historical figures used this exact framework under insane pressure. Turned what I thought was abstract ancient wisdom into actual daily practice. This book will make you question everything you think you know about handling adversity.

## Step 6: Physical Prep Is Mental Prep

Your brain runs on your body. When your body is wrecked, sleep deprived, nutrient deficient, your mental resilience is shot before pressure even hits.

Non negotiables:
- 7-8 hours sleep minimum. Not ""when I can,"" actually schedule it.
- Regular exercise that makes you breathe hard. Your brain needs that.
- Actual protein and real food, not just coffee and anxiety.

Neuroscientist Andrew Huberman breaks this down constantly on his podcast (Huberman Lab, one of the biggest science podcasts). Your brain's ability to handle stress is directly tied to sleep quality, dopamine regulation, and physical state. You can't mental toughness your way out of biological dysfunction.

## Step 7: Post Pressure Recovery Protocol

Nobody talks about this. You can't just go from high pressure back to normal instantly. Your nervous system needs to reset or you'll stay in elevated stress mode, which makes you MORE likely to crack next time.

After any high pressure situation:
- Do something physical to discharge the stress hormones (walk, workout, even jumping jacks).
- Practice what psychologists call ""stress inoculation review."" Write down what happened, what you handled well, what you'd do different. Not to beat yourself up, but to update your brain's database.
- Give yourself actual recovery time before the next pressure situation when possible.

App rec: Try [Finch](https://apps.apple.com/in/app/finch-self-care-pet/id1528595748) for building this into a habit. It's a self care app that gamifies daily practices. Sounds cutesy but it actually helps you build routines around recovery and mental health maintenance without feeling like homework.

For those who want a more structured way to internalize all this stress resilience knowledge, there's [BeFreed](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/befreed-learn-anything/id6739747450), an AI-powered learning app that pulls from performance psychology research, neuroscience studies, and expert insights to create personalized audio content. 

You can set a goal like ""build mental toughness under work pressure"" or ""stop freezing during presentations,"" and it generates a learning plan specifically for that, pulling from sources like stress research, peak performance books, and expert talks. The content adjusts from quick 10-minute overviews to 40-minute deep dives with detailed examples. Plus you can pick voices that actually keep you engaged, like a calm coaching voice or something more energetic if you're commuting. It connects a lot of these concepts, like the books mentioned here, into one cohesive learning path instead of jumping between resources.

## Step 8: Embrace the Suck (Not Toxic Positivity)

There's a difference between toxic positivity (""everything happens for a reason"") and actually accepting that pressure sucks but you can handle it anyway. You don't need to pretend it's all good. You need to acknowledge it's hard AND that you're capable.

Former Navy SEAL David Goggins talks about this in Can't Hurt Me (bestseller, his story is legitimately insane). He calls it ""callusing your mind."" You acknowledge the pain, the pressure, the difficulty. Then you do it anyway. Not because it feels good, but because you're building proof for your brain that you can.

Every time you don't crack under pressure, you're creating evidence. Your brain keeps receipts. Next time, it'll remember ""oh yeah, we've survived this before.""

## Step 9: Get Brutally Honest About Your Patterns

When do you crack? What specific situations? What thoughts run through your head right before you fall apart? Most people never actually analyze this, they just keep repeating the same pattern.

Track your cracks for two weeks:
- What was happening?
- What were you thinking right before?
- What physical sensations showed up?
- What did you do in response?

Patterns will emerge. Maybe you crack when you feel judged. Maybe it's time pressure specifically. Maybe it's when you feel out of control. Once you know YOUR specific triggers, you can build specific strategies.

## Step 10: Build Your Support Infrastructure Before You Need It

Trying to build resilience alone while under pressure is like trying to build a parachute after you've jumped out of the plane. You need people, systems, and resources in place BEFORE shit hits the fan.

Set this up now:
- At least one person you can text when you're losing it who won't just say ""calm down.""
- A therapist or coach if you can afford it (BetterHelp or Talkspace if in person isn't an option).
- A list of things that have worked before when you were stressed.

Your brain under pressure is not your smartest brain. It needs a pre-made map to follow.

Look, building a mind that doesn't crack isn't about becoming some unfeeling robot or pretending pressure doesn't affect you. It's about training your nervous system, reframing your responses, and building actual skills through practice. The science is clear. Your brain is plastic, it changes based on what you do repeatedly. Right now it might be trained to crack. But you can retrain it. Just takes consistent practice and actually implementing this stuff instead of just reading about it.",0,1769197533.0,focusedmen,0,0.5,False
1ql0uae,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1ql0uae/aitah_for_not_coming_outside_to_meet_my_friend/,AITAH for not coming outside to meet my friend?,"My mom (45F) throws this giant dinner party every year at our house where everyone comes wearing very extravagant clothing and loads of makeup and they dance and do whatever they like doing. I don't know, I (20F) usually just sit in my room and wait it out or deliberately make different plans to skip this dinner party.

Before you think to yourself, ""Oh, why is this person such a massive loser?"" I'd like to give some context. My mom is very beautiful. She is slimmer and taller than I am, too. I am the complete opposite of that: overweight, short in stature, and pretty unimpressive looking visually. Growing up, people would tell me: ""Your mom is so beautiful, what happened?"" (My dad did.) I digress; my mom would tell me to sit in my room when she had guests over and would say things like: ""I don't want to see your face for the rest of the night."" 

I always assumed it was because I was unattractive, and I had this in my mind for as long as I could remember. I developed a lot of self image issues because of this and refused to go out in public a lot or meet new people and often avoided even being seen with my mother because everyone would say something stupid to her like, ""You're so beautiful. THAT'S your daughter?""
I just found ways to make life easier, and being invisible was one of them. 

Back to the present; a few weeks ago my mom started planning this party, as usual. She has a few friends whose daughters I grew up around but never saw often. I asked my mother if one of those daughters - let's call her Hana - was coming. 
She said: ""I don't know."" 
I referred to Hana as my friend in the title, but I don't think we are. We enjoy each other's company and always see each other when we're in the same place, but we don't communicate outside of that. I've tried befriending her, as she's complained before about not having friends, but she's awful to make plans with because she genuinely doesn't stick to them. 

Anyway, I called Hana because there's a chance she'll be coming if her mother is, and even though I hate my mom's parties, I figured Hana and I could just hang out at my room instead of outside with everyone else where I'd get judged (I am not making an assumption, I quite literally get judged: my mother once reported to me that one of her friends called me fat, and that I should do something about it). 

Hana never picked up my call or texted back until about four days before the party. She asked me why I called. I asked her if she was coming, and she said: ""Probably not."" and we left it at that. Simple. 

A few days later, it's party time. I'm outside having coffee with my sister. I get a call from Hana. I immediately get a sense of what's going on. I answer the call. Hana doesn't say anything except, ""Hey, are you home?"" 
No, I'm not home. 

I had to take a deep breath to answer her in a way that didn't reflect how pissed I was starting to get. I told her I wasn't, and she responded with a: ""Oh, well I forgot what number your house is and what I should press on the elevator."" 

I let her know and she hung up. When I got back home, she called me again and asked whether or not she'd get to see me. I told her we could hang out in my room away from everyone else like my other friends usually would do when a big gathering like this would happen, and I asked for her ETA so I could figure out what I had time for when it came to fixing up my appearance. 

She said 10 minutes. 
20 minutes later, she sends me a text. Asking me to come out. Listen, I didn't flat out refuse. I opened the door to my room and walked over to see what I was dealing with, and there it was. 

It was a long time since I'd actually seen what my mother's parties look like, so I was a bit starstruck. Actual ballgowns, giant pinned up hair, full glam makeup. I was wearing my nice shirt and jeans and lip balm. If I went there looking like that, I'd genuinely never live it down, and I'd hear my mom complaining about how I need to upkeep my appearance better for days on end. Absolutely not worth going out there. 

I went back into my room and texted something along the lines of: ""Sorry, don't think I can go out right now. If you'd like to see me, I'll be in my room."" 

She texted back and asked me to go out again. This in particular annoyed me because I told her on our phone call that I looked a mess and was going to freshen up for her and wear a casual outfit. She knew the dress code for the party and was still asking me to meet everyone and sit with them. 
Honestly, by that point, I just ignored her text and went back to doing whatever I was doing, until I got a call from my mother asking me to say hello to Hana. 

I told her I just don't feel comfortable seeing everyone and I don't mind meeting Hana; she can just come to my room. My mom was starting to guilt trip me into it and when I wasn't taking the bait she just hung up on me. 
I get that what I did was pretty ""high-maintenance"" but I just can't do it. I don't want to surround myself with people I grew up around who always told me to ""stop eating"" or to ""wear baggier clothing"" because it made me ""look like a tent"". 

Hana doesn't know about that, so I do feel like I'm being a bit unfair towards her, but I don't want to share this with her anyway because I don't think she'd understand, and she actually never contacted me again after that. My mom seems pretty disappointed though, for some reason.

1ql0u74,https://www.reddit.com/r/FictionWriting/comments/1ql0u74/not_interested/,Not Interested,"Nathan Ridgway first heard about the accident while buttoning his cuffs.

The television murmured in the background of his penthouse kitchen, a calm anchor describing twisted metal and a stalled rush-hour artery. A sedan had crossed the median on the Don Valley Parkway. One fatality. No name released yet. The words slid past him like traffic seen from a high window—unfortunate, distant, irrelevant.

He adjusted his tie, took a sip of coffee, and left.

By midmorning he was already ahead of schedule, a rare and pleasant thing. Deals moved cleanly when people were afraid of losing him. Meetings ended early. Numbers bent the right way. Hunger arrived precisely at eleven-thirty, as it always did, and he descended to the basement of the office tower where his favorite takeout place hid between a dry cleaner and a forgotten shoe repair shop.

He ordered without looking at the menu. The cashier smiled with the practiced warmth of someone who depended on tips. He nodded back, distracted, already calculating the afternoon.

Food in hand, he turned toward the elevator bank—and stopped.

A thin line of light leaked from a hallway he had never noticed before. It ran between two concrete pillars, narrow and oddly clean, as if it belonged to a different building entirely. The light wasn’t bright. It was patient.

Standing at the entrance was a man he recognized instantly, despite the years.

“Daniel?” Nathan Ridgway said.

Daniel Mercer smiled, the same easy, unguarded smile he’d worn in university. Back then Daniel had been the one who stayed late to help classmates, who talked about meaning and responsibility while others talked about starting salaries.

“I thought it might be you,” Daniel said. “Still in a hurry?”

Nathan Ridgway laughed. “Always. What are you doing here?”

“A bit of minor business,” Daniel replied, and gestured down the hallway. “Care to join me?”

He hesitated only a moment. Curiosity, like hunger, had always been a reliable motivator. “Sure. I’ve got a few minutes.”

They stepped inside.

The hallway stretched farther than it should have, its walls smooth and dark. As they walked, the walls flickered—and became screens.

The first image bloomed to life: a cramped office, years ago. Nathan Ridgway—young, sharper, hungrier—sat across from a junior employee who clutched a folder with shaking hands. The screen replayed the moment he’d cut her off, dismissed her concerns about a faulty report, and later let her take the blame when the numbers collapsed. The fallout followed: her termination, her apology email unanswered, her name quietly disappearing from the industry.

He frowned. “That was business.”

Daniel nodded. “Quite a decision that was.”

They walked on. Another screen ignited: a handshake that sealed a merger, followed by layoffs announced via email. Faces blurred past—people packing desks, calling spouses, sitting silently in cars. Another screen: a zoning deal, a neighborhood hollowed out, small shops shuttered. Another: a friend passed over for promotion, trust broken with a smile.

With each step, the screens multiplied. Not every moment was cruel, but the weight of them pressed in. Nathan Ridgway felt something unfamiliar tightening in his chest.

“I didn’t see all this,” he said. “I couldn’t have.”

“You saw enough,” Daniel said gently. “You just learned how not to look. How not to care.”

Nathan Ridgway slowed. “I did good too. Scholarships. Donations.”

A screen answered him: a charity gala, applause, a check presented. Then the quieter aftermath—the program underfunded, the initiative abandoned once the press moved on.

His throat went dry. “Why are you showing me this?”

“I’m not,” Daniel said. “You are. I’m just here to help you understand it. What exactly you were really trying to do with these acts … look good.”

They continued until the hallway seemed to hum with images, overlapping voices, consequences rippling outward. Nathan Ridgway’s breathing grew shallow.

“Enough,” he said. “I don’t need this. I get it. I made hard choices.”

Daniel stopped walking. “Hard doesn’t mean harmless.”

“I said enough.” He turned away, covering his eyes as if that might shut the screens down. “Turn it off.”

When he looked again, the screens had gone dark. The hallway felt emptier, colder.

“I can’t do this anymore,” Nathan Ridgway said, pressing his palms to his temples. The hallway pulsed faintly, the dark screens whispering with half-seen moments. “I’m done. Turn it off.”

Daniel stopped walking.

For the first time, his expression shifted—not disappointment, not anger, but something closer to resignation. He looked past Nathan Ridgway, down the length of the hallway, as though listening to a voice only he could hear.

“I have to go,” Daniel said.

Nathan Ridgway exhaled sharply. “Good. Then go.”

Daniel didn’t move right away. “I was told to stay as long as there was interest.”

“Interest?” Nathan Ridgway scoffed. “In what?”

“In you,” Daniel replied. “In whether you were willing to look. To learn. To understand.”

Nathan Ridgway straightened, irritation flaring. “And now?”

Daniel met his eyes. “Now my boss isn’t interested anymore.”

The words settled heavily between them.

“Your boss?” Nathan Ridgway said, forcing a laugh. “You always needed someone telling you what to do.”

Daniel smiled faintly. “Someone always does.”

The hallway dimmed, the walls losing their sheen. The screens went black.

“I need to help other people,” Daniel said, already stepping back. “Some of them are still listening. They are still willing to learn.”

Nathan Ridgway felt a sudden, irrational chill. “Wait,” he said. “You don’t get to judge me and just walk away.”

“I didn’t judge you,” Daniel replied. “You did. I just help put together the paperwork.”

He opened his mouth to respond—some sharp remark, something final—but before the words could form, Daniel was gone. Not walking away, not fading—simply absent, as though he had never occupied the space at all.

Nathan Ridgway stared at the emptiness, then laughed under his breath, shaking his head.

“Figures,” he muttered. “You finally get a job, and you still can’t keep it.”

The hallway flickered—and vanished.

A vibration in his pocket startled him. His phone rang.

“Yes?” he said, too loudly.

His assistant’s voice came through, tight and careful. “There’s been an update on the accident from this morning.”

He closed his eyes. “What now?”

“They’ve identified the victim. It was Daniel Mercer. Your former close friend from university.”

The basement seemed to tilt. Nathan’s world seemed to spin for a few moments.

“He was pronounced dead just after 9 this morning,” she added quietly. “Just over an hour ago.”

The call ended. The line went dead.

Nathan Ridgway lowered the phone, his reflection staring back at him from the dark screen—older than he felt, smaller than he remembered.

Somewhere above him, the elevators chimed, doors opening and closing, still very interested in where he was going.

I’m 23F and my brother is 19. I’m honestly at my breaking point and need outside perspective because I feel angry, sad, and exhausted all at once.

Growing up, I worked really hard in high school, jobs, good grades, overachiever type. I didn’t really get to “enjoy” life the way other kids did. Because of that, when my siblings were younger, I tried to be generous so they could have things I didn’t. Little stuff like food money, outings, or just not stressing about money the way I did.

With my brother, that turned into a lot more.

During his high school years, I gave him access to my card for coffee/food because I wanted him to focus on school. I also had money saved at home, over $7,000, that he secretly took and spent on drinking, ditching school, and messing around. He hid it from me for a full year. The only reason he told me was because I was about to accuse my parents of taking it.

That alone crushed me.

On top of that, I helped him get a car from my dad, constantly defended him in the family, paid his phone bill, and covered things for him, all while I didn’t even have a car and was working twice as hard. When he finally confessed about the money, I had just had surgery and was still pushing through school and work. By the way my PARENTS don’t give us money or help us out at all, I have 4 siblings. 

Since then, he hasn’t shown real change. He quit track, failed/dropped college classes, smokes weed constantly, drinks, and avoids responsibility. He says he “feels bad,” but only pays me back when I directly ask. He never took initiative. He didn’t confess on his own. Nothing about his behavior actually changed.

Meanwhile, I’m waking up at 5am multiple days a week for school, commuting by train, stuck in a job I hate because I can’t afford to quit yet, and trying to save to buy a home. Some days the trains don’t even run back properly, and I’m just exhausted. Watching him sit at home with access to a car and no real responsibilities honestly makes me furious.

I feel taken advantage of. Not just financially, but emotionally. What hurts most is that I wasn’t giving to be nice. I was giving because I wanted my siblings to have some enjoyment in life that I didn’t get. And he took advantage of that.

At this point, he feels like a liability to the whole family. I’m seriously considering telling him he needs to move out in a few weeks and cutting financial support completely. I feel guilty even thinking that, but I also feel like if I don’t choose myself now, I’m going to drown.

Am I wrong for wanting to cut him off and finally put myself first?
Does this sound like real remorse on his end, or just guilt with no action?

I genuinely don’t want to become bitter or cold but I can’t keep living like this either.

I’ve been wanting to go on photo walks in the city but as a 5’0 girlie I usually don’t feel safe walking around on my own *especially* with my gear.

I was wondering if there’s anyone interested in going on photo walks together in different parts of the city? I’d love be accompanied by chill girlie pops. I’ve tried those photographer meetup events but the experience has been spoiled by men being men.

So I’m thinking of doing once/twice a month meet ups, all skill levels welcome. Any camera/medium is ok! I can also offer mini lessons and offer help for anyone brand new to the hobby. I think it’d be nice to do a different walk each month and then end at a cafe/coffee shop nearby. Would anyone be interested in something like this?

I’m an ambivert myself (more on the introverted side but I can lock in and be host) so I really wouldn’t mind if it’s just silent company if that’s more your speed. I mainly don’t want to pressure people to socialize when the purpose is to do photography. I’m thinking along the lines of a “Shy Girlie Photography Club” if that makes sense.

Would love to know if there’s any interest! Feedback & ideas are welcome as well. If enough people are interested I’ll put together a group chat or a way to communicate. 💗",4,1769197094.0,LAhotgirlies,3,1.0,False

I’m 30F, my mom was 52. She was diagnosed with ALS about two years ago and regressed quickly, passing away on Christmas Day. As I write this, I’m about to start getting ready to go to her service.

Mom was my best friend. She was a wonderful woman-a poet, a writer, a singer. She had an infectious laugh and bright sense of humor. She had many friends and people who loved her, especially me. Before her diagnosis and before her body became too weak, we did everything together-concerts, karaoke, going on walks, getting coffee. She understood me and empathized with me like no one else. Even in her condition, we spoke every day-now, my life is quiet. People check in and say nice things, but the gap in my life is overwhelming.

I’ve had thoughts of suicidal ideation-no plan,  but thoughts of “how can I go on without her?” I’m having a hard time accepting her illness-why did she have to have ALS and be taken away from me so soon? It’s not fair. My older sister died of cancer ten years ago so it feels like the strong women in my life that I looked up to are gone. Why did they taken from me, it seems so cruel. Life feels very dark, sad, and meaningless.

We are so back and deep in the trenches working on the next wave of updates!

https://preview.redd.it/y60kwlp6i5fg1.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=f3544656ee38a5f4aef4c2ec91d743a1897d2e06

While Autonomica is officially in early closed Alpha, which includes some dust and the occasional rogue physics glitch. We are also pushing forward at a steady, high-voltage rate and shifting to a new rhythm for releases, because we want to get new toys into your hands faster to show off clearer progress in real-time!

 It is also a good way to let all of you know that we haven’t been abducted by a rogue AI!

https://preview.redd.it/4e5zjsj9i5fg1.png?width=1045&format=png&auto=webp&s=0bf0f8d0fa3d322c7b55990ff316f2089e70b9b5

We are splitting our work into two different speeds. 

First, we have **Chapters**, which are our major milestones. These will not be just content drops, but the moments where our systems and story will finally click together. 

Each **Chapter** will wrap up a specific narrative arc and finish off a whole set of features that represent the completion of that stage of the journey. 

https://preview.redd.it/t67zxf7bi5fg1.png?width=1161&format=png&auto=webp&s=11a0930dba5484b4ef07ee67636839adb1663658

And yes, they will end on cliffhangers.  
We are doing that on purpose because **we are mean** like that!

https://preview.redd.it/zoaaozsci5fg1.png?width=1045&format=png&auto=webp&s=b727f51d4e745b6deb8a5fffe79faa747c76b0a1

Inside those Chapters, we will be dropping **Sprints**. 

These are smaller, faster updates that tackle specific features. We plan to have multiple sprints per chapter and you can expect to see these on a monthly or semi-monthly basis, depending on how much coffee we have had! 

*Of course, hotfixes are still their own thing. If the game starts acting like a haunted toaster, we will push a fix as soon as we can.*

https://preview.redd.it/lqgelckei5fg1.png?width=1045&format=png&auto=webp&s=0937f81625725368f79bfc1ef90294dc79e0b84b

Right now, we are deep in the development of Sprint 1 for Chapter 1, titled **First Contact.**

The mission here is to beef up the core systems and finally introduce your lovely companion bot and resident harshest critic, **Black Box.** This Chapter introduces our dialogue systems, so you can talk to Black Box and maybe some other mysterious voices lurking in the fog. 



We are also building out a proper quest flow that we expect to include more than 30 quests! This will feature improved and rebalanced versions of the old ones. We know **Pacing** in a survival game is everything, and we will continue tuning this until it feels just right.

Later in the Chapter, we will introduce **NPC Supply Requests**. You will help the Autonomics (local engineers, we will talk more about the game lore in our next update so keep tuned in!) keep this place from falling apart by delivering goods in exchange for rewards that actually matter for your progression.

We are exploring a multi-questline structure so you are not stuck on one main quest rail! You might choose one day to be a **Pioneer Farmer** and follow that quest chain to establish a sustainable ranch. Then perhaps another day be **Automation Architect** building production chains. You might  just want to be a **Homesteader**, where you can focus on building meaningful Living Structures that actually feel like a home and not just a box where you keep your bed. With this system you will be able to go up any quest line at any time you want! 

There will be detailed customization tools coming soon in this chapter, we are guessing within Sprint 2 or 3. It will finally allow you to pick custom patterns, colors, and materials during the object customization process.



*WORK IN PROGRESS UI SUBJECT TO CHANGE.*



On the automation side, we are making things modular and intuitive. We are working on vertical machine stacking and better conveyor tools so your production line looks less like a plate of mechanical spaghetti.

On another note, we are also working on Multiplayer in parallel! We are not planning on doing a ""big bang"" release here and taking our time with it. We may not have an exact timeframe on this, but the current plan is to roll out test features in small steps, with early co-op starting to show up toward the end of Chapter 1 or the start of Chapter 2.

https://preview.redd.it/ywynj6qji5fg1.png?width=1045&format=png&auto=webp&s=484e50839fe57c5145b34c6ebd063196024e0b27

***RELEASE DATE: AROUND THE END OF FEBRUARY***



Our first Sprint, titled **Artificial Non-Intelligence,** should land in the next few weeks.

This update is all about making Black Box useful! Black Boxes are the smart planes’ autopilots, flight recorders, and ***emergency survival guides***. 

https://preview.redd.it/fto7e0gli5fg1.jpg?width=1343&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=a15e6972259a79ec46aff612977c06064b4aad2b

After the plane crash, the Black Box is still online and *very* chatty, piping up with hints like it is running a survival podcast. It is helpful, sure, but it is also your biggest critic. Don’t be surprised if it judges your design choices or points out your survival failures while wondering aloud why you are walking in circles.

  
Keep in mind that it's still heavy work in progress and a lot of things that you see is still a prototype or a placeholder.

https://i.redd.it/ymr2pkymi5fg1.gif

You will be able to use Black Box to locate and/or bring you resources. It can also scan your base to reveal construction integrity, highlighting weak points in your construction before it becomes ""accidental modern art!"" 

This Black Box is damaged, though, and as you help it recover the memory modules it is missing it will transform and offer even more assistance. It will tell you more about the incident and help you in the search for your best friend that got lost after the crash *(more on lore, coming soon).* 

Black Box is voiced by a real talent Tor (you can even talk to her on our [Discord server](https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?u=https%3A%2F%2Fdiscord.gg%2Fautonomica) by tagging u/Black Box, but please be sensitive and don’t overwhelm her and we will need her for a lot of Voice Over lines) She brings just the right amount of whimsy and sass to the Black Box that we think you guys will love!



Check out our early prototype of the Black Box:

Looking further down the road, we will be moving toward Phantom hunting and the first steps of extraction through **Time Travel.** 

Check out new Phantom Animations:  
[Autonomica Report: New Phantom Locomotion Discovered](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XuCpDes7WQ8)

This is the big ""**Autonomica becomes Autonomica**"" moment!  
As you will be helping **Autonomics** *(lore)* build a massive vertical kinetic system called **Tremor** *(lore - duh)*, which is designed to unlock time travel in the game. You are going to be the pioneer for the first real-time jump in this world. 

Good luck.  
We are sure the timeline will stay perfectly intact...  
Mostly…  
Maybe…

We love open development and your feedback is what makes this game awesome. More soon!

Stay tuned, Autonomics!

I knew my marriage was screwed and had given up trying to rescue it (wife is a covert narc) and was already gearing up for divorce. I developed a crush on K, well it had always been there but i stifled it because i was married. But it grew. 

Thinks took a turn when i told her about my marriage breaking down and to my surprise she said her marriage was pretty screwed up. She'd tried to end it a year ago but her husband convinced her to go into couples counselling but she said that he wasn't taking accountability and it felt like going through the motions. I developed a limerence (check my limerence posts if you wish) and asked her for coffee and basically confessed my feelings. She was happy and reciprocated and we embarked on an affair. 

This wasn't just a lusty thing, we started spending time together more and more and building on the tremendous connection we already had. We both saw that we were highly compatible on every level. When we consumated our affair a couple of months in, the sex was slow, tender and incredibly connected.  We confessed our love. The feelings had been there for a while but we cried happily when we told each other.

K had asked her husband to leave a total of three times in the 4 months we were together. He did move out for a few weeks but he cane back. I was of course disappointed and she was angry at herself for letting it happen. Her husband is a succesful guy but he has some complex issues and is coercive and controlling.

We continued through christmas and new year, making our escape plans and she was getting coaching off her therapist on how to end it. My divorce now well progressed. Things were looking good for me and K. She was visibly stressed, though she said it was the stress of living with him under duress, it was also down to the conflict of lying and keeping secrets which she played down to me, i think to protect my feelings. 

Up until last friday we were meeting 3x a week, dates and just hanging out, being in love, kissing, making plans for the future, even looking at houses. 

Then we got found out. Saturday my soon to be ex wife found evidence of us (she spotted a love heart emoji on my phone from K) and grabbed my phone and locked herself in the bathroom. Screenshotted everything and then left and confronted K at her house (bear in mind i was single before i went near K, she just wanted to wreck people) and she sent the screenshots to K's husband. 

We were blown wide open. K went silent for a few days then asked to meet me on Wednesday where she finished with me.  It was a very teary farewell for both of us, lots of hugs and for around two hours. She said no contact, which I'll honour. She said the conflict and guilt was too much. She said she regretted our involvement which hurt badly. She said that she was mentally just in a bad place and needed to regroup. She said that she was sorry for everything and u told her that she was forgiven and that i wished her well. She said that the shame was too much.

I said i thought she'd try to make it up with her husband. She didn't rule it out. I asked if we could reconnect in future. She didn't rule it out. I wished her well and wished that she'd find her happiness wherever it is.

I know i need to leave her alone now. I'm devastated and i know she is too. I know she loves me but she can't do this anymore. 

I'm hoping she'll reach out in due course. But in reality it looks like this shared dream became a dirty little secret. Totally gutted! ",1,1769196955.0,adultery,3,1.0,False

My schedule is 2x a week I work 6pm to 630am. My commute is 40 mins by car. When I’m driving on the roads leading up to the interstate I am fine. But when I get onto the interstate and go 70mph I start going in and out of it. I have to turn up the music while driving. I heard about opening the window while on the drive but the problem is for the next 10 days at least in my area it will be below 15°f so I start coughing cause of how cold it is. I heard from some people, that chewing gum helps? Sometimes my dad is awake when I get off so he calls me and that helps until he hangs up then I get tired again. I don’t drink really anything other than water and sweet tea when I go out to eat or have takeout. But mainly I drink water, no coffee or energy drinks.

I left a well paying job because the empathy burnout was incredibly intense (I was managing 3 stores without any general managers on site, and had to deal with the typical service industry ups and downs of 30+ employees, plus had to cover shifts between these three locations when someone inevitably called out on an almost daily basis. Plus manage operations on an upper management level too). Sine then, I’ve been laid off three ish times in the past 6 months. I’ve been making some career changes as well, which includes moving into some self employment. Which obviously takes time to even see any financial payout. Still very much not giving up full time job searching. But life has been…. Difficult to say the least.  I’m lucky enough to have some financial support from my mom, but she can only help so much. And frankly, I feel like a deep burden to her at this point. 

I have very few friends. I spend most of my time at home because I can’t even afford a coffee from the shop on my corner most days, which I would love to be able to just do some work not at home. Various bills are getting bounced from time to time. My bank account is constantly overdrawn. I feel like a burden to the entire world. 

If it weren’t for my cat and a group of 8 year olds I teach twice a week, I would be deeply inclined to cease existence in this moment. I don’t feel like I have a whole lot to live for. I feel like I’m a waste of space on this planet. I feel like a complete failure. 

I do go to therapy regularly, and will continue to talk to my therapist about these feelings. But it’s been completely overwhelming the past couple of days especially. I feel so exhausted all the time. I can’t remember the last time I saw any people in my life. Not even from my own volition, but because no one has the time to even answer my texts with the exception of maybe two people in my life. I just feel so deeply alone all the time. And it’s hard not to feel like everyone would be better off without me. ",1,1769196750.0,depression,0,1.0,False

Also just got rejected from a coffee shop. My friend is a manager at another location and recommended me, gave me all the interview questions beforehand, i rehearsed and gave good answers. Not sure what else i could’ve done.

This is purely just for me but i firmly believe if i stick with it, it will lead to something even if only indirectly.

Unreal/real. True/false. Us/them. You/me. Duality/nonduality. The illusion. I call it the “world”. 

Where does this world come from? 

This is our curriculum with Spirit. If Ivan’s path is followed, only Ivan’s enlightenment is found. And may not be a good fit. Yogi must bivouac his own sojourn - with Spirit - to 0ne Mind. Our divided minds, unveiled in our yearning for conscious-awareness; Whole Mind.

>³Spiritual vision looks within... ⁴Perfectly aware of the right defense it passes over all others, looking past error to truth. ([ACIM, T-2.III.4:3-4](https://acim.org/acim/chapter-2/the-altar-of-god/en/s/63#4:3-4))

Spirit meets you at the altar, you have prepared in the previous lessons. Take everything to Spirit and the truth of your errors are illuminated. Lighting the way to joy - the feeling of 0ne Mind’s inclusive love.  ([ACIM, T-6.II.5:1-3](https://acim.org/acim/chapter-6/the-alternative-to-projection/en/s/99#5:1-3))

Spirit is the Guide of Sonship, the hand with which Jesus reaches out to us. We are all Sonship manifested here & now as indivisible-individuals yearning to reunite in 0ne conscious awareness. 

In other words, do not listen to me - take only that which resonates with your path, gives comfort, encourages your walk with Spirit.

The sanskrit word for “thought” is vritti. It is the sound of dry leaves in a sudden breeze.

We see the tree, feel the breeze, smell their crush. Images - the taste of hot chocolate - flashes across our minds. Memories stir. We turn toward home. Planning, anticipating, when we walk in the door. 

My fingers type my thoughts as I lounge on my sofa kingdom. Coffee chilling on the side table. 

* These thoughts do not mean anything. 
* I am upset/anticipating/fearing/enjoying because I see something that is not there
* I am never upset/anticipating/fearing/enjoying for the reason I think

I see, hear, feel, smell, and taste throughout my day. Not there? How did I wrap my mind around that? Being one who has learned to understand something, before brushing it aside - I had to find out. 

Materialism (science: mathematics, physics, neuroscience, social sciences) is devoted to the identifying & measuring of the illusion of duality. They have proved acim correct, even on science discoveries post-acim-revelation.

Materialists agree there is nothing “out there” but electromagnetic particulate. Genesis calls it dust to dust. The Vedas use this image as does acim:

>Within this kingdom the ego rules, and cruelly. ²And to defend this little speck of dust it bids you fight against the universe. ³This fragment of your mind is such a tiny part of it that, could you but appreciate the whole, you would see instantly that it is like the smallest sunbeam to the sun, or like the faintest ripple on the surface of the ocean. ([ACIM, T-18.VIII.3:1-3](https://acim.org/acim/chapter-18/the-little-garden/en/s/226#3:1-3))

>³You groped but feebly in the dust and found your brother’s hand, uncertain whether to let it go or to take hold on life so long forgotten. ([ACIM, T-20.III.9:3](https://acim.org/acim/chapter-20/sin-as-an-adjustment/en/s/244#9:3))

Ego is dust formed into thoughts. It has been measured by materialists from emergence (ubiquitous brain noise), embedded in matter (weighted by dust), interpreted ([vision](https://www.bing.com/images/search?q=optical+illusion&form=HDRSC3&first=1) targets dust). Decaying when forgotten. Dust to dust. 

The ego is constrained by perception. Ego is thought, thinking (projecting) dust into “concepts”. Solid conglomerates for my dusty body to sit on while my mind images rewarmed coffee. 

The world is constrained by forces. Quantum physics cosplaying Isaac Newton here & now in the world, bored. Home from Oxford; quarantined by the plague epidemic at 23. He sat in the garden intuiting an apple - not falling - but grasped by the hand of an unknown force to be pulled to the center of the world. Stopped only by the garden lawn. He invented calculus to communicate thoughts of gravity and planets. And then spent the rest of his isolation breaking “ordinary” light into spectrums. 

Everyone always obeys the law of gravity - unrealized. Mindlessly taken for granted. No one breaks it. We do mindfully, consciously, think of loopholes to get around it 🎈. 

All kinds of minds in the [umwelt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Umwelt) of my sofa kingdom, each perceiving our little spot differently. The dogs, hearing and seeing what I cannot. I perceive detail and colors they cannot. This keeps our sleeping forms anchored safely to the world. And this is the true calling of ego.

Stirring from sleep, awakening to 0ne Mind, we begin to see 0ne Truth of an unveiled Mind.

First of all, thank you to the kind, selfless people who run this group and comment while going through such a difficult situation.  

I had been having some mild weakness in one hand and both legs for a few months.  In the past few weeks, the weakness is now in both hands and is much worse.  I feel like I’m losing my dexterity to some degree.  my legs are a bit worse too.  I saw my doctor a few days ago and she kind of blew it off and said maybe carpal tunnel.  The weakness seems to stem from my forearms if that makes sense.

When I saw my doctor, she examined me and said I was having muscle spasms in my back and shoulders.

I m mostly functioning okay but have dropped a few things and m constantly aware of what going on with my hands.   I’m having a little trouble cooking and even lifting my coffee mug feels weird.  I can walk several miles briskly even though my legs feel weak.

Today, this evening, 45 minutes ago, I (21 years old) had a discussion, lasting about an hour and a half, with my little brother (17 years old). I was afraid of this discussion. I'd been putting it off for almost 13 years. I didn't feel comfortable talking about it. Either because I wasn't sure of myself at first, or because I was ashamed, or because I was afraid of what others would think... But even after I was sure, after I was no longer ashamed, or no longer afraid of what others would think, he was still my little brother, and I didn't want to force this discussion on him. So, since I've noticed a chill between us for the past 5-6 months, I finally took the initiative to talk to her about it.

It was one of my worst conversations to date about this (the fact that I'm a woman. A trans woman.) Just imagine a random person you could tell your deepest secrets to, who, as soon as you start talking, becomes defensive, practically refuses to talk, or tells you they already know everything about the subject but says all sorts of nonsense at the same time, without ever looking at you. Or someone who tells you that you should get a therapist, see a shrink, give up, that it's not the ""right path,"" who ""suggests"" you stop this nonsense, who tells you that you've been brainwashed, that you're the product of ""propaganda."" WHO TOLD YOU YOU CAN NEVER BE WHO YOU ARE?! WHO KEEPS DENYING ALL YOUR EXPERIENCES SO FAR?! WHO AFTER ALL THAT CLAIMS TO SUPPORT YOU?! WHAT KIND OF SUPPORT IS THAT???

... I was up against a brick wall. That wall was my little brother.

Just to be able to talk to him about something that was ""close to my heart,"" ""very important to me,"" I had to insist for 10 minutes. In the end, it was all for nothing. All of that, all of my experiences, my entire identity, it's nothing to him. To him, I have ""no value anymore."" To him, I'm lying to myself. For him, I could never be who I am, who I've always been. For him, I'm lost. I should open my eyes. For him, the role I supposedly played (I've played a guy's role all these years) is my true identity, and by revealing myself to him as I really am, I'm lying to him. For him, I'm narrow-minded, I always have been. For him, it's like pretending to be ""a coffee table,"" which makes no sense. Spoiler alert: it has nothing to do with that.

For him: There must have been a trigger, something that would make me think this way ""today,"" even though I've always been this way. Everyone is different. There can be many triggers, or none at all. In my case, there wasn't one. I've been who I am from the start, and to avoid this kind of reaction, I'd retreated into a guy persona that I couldn't stand anymore 8-9 months ago (maybe longer, I don't know at this point). Unsurprisingly, from the very first minute, I was in tears just to tell him that ""I'm trans."" He remained silent for 2-3 minutes with his arms crossed, looking like he couldn't care less. Surprisingly, he did that the whole time. Then, a ""debate"" ensued, which at one point felt more like an interrogation, with him asking me biased questions like, ""Why do you want to be a girl?"", ""What made you say that?"", ""What did you look up on the internet to think that?"", ""How long have you thought that?"".

I didn't open up to him to go through this. I was expecting a real connection between us. Support from him. Real support, unlike what he said. I wasn't ready to cry so much in front of him. I don't even want to imagine the day I have to talk to my dad about it. Yes, another long story. Maybe I'll talk about it in a future post. Right now, I just want to forget about it. And my conversation with my little brother reminded me of a ""discussion"" I had with my dad on the phone where I also cried. Anyway, I hadn't prepared a speech for my little brother, and I should have.

My little brother is transphobic. Now I'm sure of it.

I tried to defend myself as much as possible. I defended myself against his various accusations and questions. I also defended the entire LGBTQI+ community as much as I could. I'm sorry, little brother. It's true, we don't understand each other. We may never understand each other, I imagine. But know that I'm happier than I was before playing this shitty role. That my documents are in the process of being changed (first name, ID photo, gender, etc.). That I'm already seeing people who perceive me as a woman. And that no matter who says things similar to what you said, I won't listen to them. I am who I am. I am a woman. There were no triggers for any of this. YOU are transphobic. What you call ""support"" is about as useful as a hedgehog in a condom factory! I won't back down. You think I'll never be a woman. Spoiler alert: I already am!

Trans women are women! Trans men are men! Be who you want to be! Not who you're told to be! You are beautiful, beautiful, and you have the right to speak. So don't let anyone steal your identities! I love you. I will fight if I have to. Not just for myself. Also for others. Well, you might say I already do that lol. And if I die having been able to be who I am, then so be it. I will be happy ✨️🧢❤️",0,1769196514.0,MtF,0,0.33,False

Isabelle Foster woke up in a bed she didn’t recognize.  
She looked around groggily at the unfamiliar room and tried to piece together what had happened. Yesterday was the department dinner, and she’d accidentally had way too much to drink.  
After that…  
Her mind suddenly snapped into sharp focus as the memory hit her. His deep groans still echoed in her ears like they were haunting her.  
She cut off that train of thought right there and just wanted to get the hell out of this mess.  
She picked up her torn white shirt from the floor, but there was no way she could wear it out like this. Her hands shook as she tossed the ruined fabric aside, and then she spotted a clean outfit laid out on the bed. He’d obviously left it there for her—a professional skirt suit.  
She threw it on as fast as she could. The clothes weren’t her usual style, so he’d probably just grabbed something random to deal with the situation.  
When she checked herself in the mirror, she noticed her neck was completely clear, but everything below her collarbone was covered in marks.  
*Ha! Am I supposed to thank him for being a gentleman or something? Like he was so worried about people knowing he’d slept with someone!*  
Isabelle sighed and walked out of the bathroom, taking in her surroundings.  
This was a massive suite, but it felt completely lifeless, like no one actually lived here. It didn’t quite feel like a hotel, but it also kind of did.  
She grabbed her purse from the nightstand and headed for the door.  
Turns out it definitely wasn’t a hotel.  
When she opened the bedroom door, a huge living room stretched out in front of her, and a familiar figure immediately caught her eye.  
He was sitting on the couch wearing headphones, with a pillow balanced on his lap and a laptop resting on top of it. He was wearing black loungewear and looked totally relaxed and casual.  
When he heard the bedroom door open, he looked up with those intense eyes of his.  
The man sitting there was her boss, Damian Cross.  
Wasn’t he supposed to be this legendary CEO who never got involved with anyone?  
Based on last night’s performance, he definitely wasn’t holding anything back. He’d acted more like a starving wolf who’d been locked up for decades.  
She stood there completely stunned and was about to say something when Damian spoke first.  
“I’m in a meeting.” His voice came out low and rough.  
Isabelle shut her mouth immediately because she knew exactly what he meant.  
“Come here and eat breakfast.” He leaned forward slightly and used his fingers to push a glass of milk across the coffee table, sliding it in front of another plate of food.  
But he didn’t notice that when he leaned forward, the hickeys all over his neck pressed right up against the camera, and every single executive in that meeting got a crystal-clear view.  
Isabelle’s face turned bright red with embarrassment. Those were probably hers—she hadn’t realized her, uh, suction skills were that intense.  
She really wished this was just some hotel room where she could walk out the door and go straight home.  
She sat down with shaky hands and kept her eyes wandering everywhere except at him. All she could do was obediently sip her milk and eat the sandwich that looked exactly like his.  
Damian had a reputation for being cold—cold personality, cold temper, just cold in every possible way. So yeah, Isabelle had basically messed with the wrong guy. She must’ve gotten in the wrong car last night.  
*But even if I got in the wrong car, why wouldn’t this ice-cold boss realize I was the wrong person? He’d just slept with an employee. Didn’t he care about his reputation at all?*  
Fifteen minutes later, he wrapped up the meeting and closed his laptop. Then he finally started eating his breakfast at this leisurely pace.  
“Sorry, I didn’t know it was your first time. I was a little rough.” His tone stayed just as cold as it had been during the meeting, and his face showed absolutely zero expression while he said it.  
Isabelle had just gotten her emotions under control, but now her face flushed red all over again.  
*What happened happened. Could you please just stop bringing it up?*  
“The family doctor will be here soon. Wait until after you see him before you go.” His voice was completely matter-of-fact.  
*Please, is he worried I’ll get pregnant with his kid and try to claim his fortune or something?*  
Isabelle finished the milk and picked up the glass of water next to her. She drank it slowly, one sip at a time, because she had no idea what to say to him.  
He ate really fast and finished everything in no time.  
“Just wait here. I still have to go into the office today, so I’ll have my assistant drive you home.”  
Isabelle quickly tried to stop him. “Mr. Cross, I can get home by myself. It’s no trouble at all.”  
“Are you saying I didn’t perform well enough last night?” He looked up slightly, and something in his expression almost seemed hurt.  
“What?” For some reason, Isabelle’s heart started pounding like crazy.  
*How could I possibly dare say that?* She was completely speechless and had no idea how to argue with what he’d just said. This was the first time in her life someone had verbally steamrolled her like this.  
If he wasn’t her boss, she would’ve already lost her temper and told him off.  
“Mr. Cross, Dr. Morgan is here.” An older maid appeared nearby.  
He didn’t say anything. He just kept watching Isabelle quietly.  
Isabelle was gorgeous—smooth, sun-kissed skin and beautiful golden hair. She was mixed race, and absolutely stunning.  
Her body was incredible too, the kind that made other guys jealous of whoever was dating her.  
All the staring made her uncomfortable, and her cheeks were already red before her whole body started heating up.  
“Come with me.” Damian’s voice cut through the tension, and he let out this barely audible sigh through his nose.  
Isabelle obediently followed him because what else was she going to do? She’d somehow managed to piss off one of the biggest names in fashion.  
When they got back to the bedroom where they’d gone at it all night, her heart started pounding and her palms got sweaty just looking at that bed.  
At least the maids had already cleaned everything up and made it spotless.  
A female doctor walked in, and then Damian walked out and closed the door behind him.  
Isabelle thought maybe she was getting the morning-after pill or a shot or something, but no. The doctor was there to examine her down there and apply medication.  
It was absolutely mortifying having someone else inspect last night’s damage like that.  
Though she had to admit, the ointment really did help with the soreness.  
She kept her hands covering her face the whole time because she wanted to die of embarrassment.  
When she finally came out, Damian was already gone.  
The only person waiting for her was Brian Hughes, Damian’s assistant.

“Yep, future Mrs. Cross.” Brian was clearly enjoying himself, and then he launched into this dramatic play-by-play.  
“I’ve known you for a while now, and I’ve never seen you drink that much. You got in the wrong car, stumbled in, threw your arms around Mr. Cross, called him Baymax, and then just went to town kissing him. It was aggressive!  
“Last night, Mr. Cross had been drinking a little too, but he didn’t even dare move. You know he’s got that whole germaphobe thing going on, right? Well, you ripped his shirt. Buttons went flying everywhere.”  
She hung her head and tried not to picture it too vividly.  
Brian added, “We were gonna take you home, but since you live alone, Mr. Cross was worried you’d be a mess by yourself, so he brought you to his place instead.”  
“Ha.” She forced out a laugh.  
“So, you and Mr. Cross…” Brian looked her up and down.  
She had to hand it to Damian—he’d been smart about it. There wasn’t a single mark on her neck.  
“Exactly what you’re thinking.” She pointed at her unmarked neck.

Isabelle Foster woke up in a bed she didn’t recognize.  
She looked around groggily at the unfamiliar room and tried to piece together what had happened. Yesterday was the department dinner, and she’d accidentally had way too much to drink.  
After that…  
Her mind suddenly snapped into sharp focus as the memory hit her. His deep groans still echoed in her ears like they were haunting her.  
She cut off that train of thought right there and just wanted to get the hell out of this mess.  
She picked up her torn white shirt from the floor, but there was no way she could wear it out like this. Her hands shook as she tossed the ruined fabric aside, and then she spotted a clean outfit laid out on the bed. He’d obviously left it there for her—a professional skirt suit.  
She threw it on as fast as she could. The clothes weren’t her usual style, so he’d probably just grabbed something random to deal with the situation.  
When she checked herself in the mirror, she noticed her neck was completely clear, but everything below her collarbone was covered in marks.  
*Ha! Am I supposed to thank him for being a gentleman or something? Like he was so worried about people knowing he’d slept with someone!*  
Isabelle sighed and walked out of the bathroom, taking in her surroundings.  
This was a massive suite, but it felt completely lifeless, like no one actually lived here. It didn’t quite feel like a hotel, but it also kind of did.  
She grabbed her purse from the nightstand and headed for the door.  
Turns out it definitely wasn’t a hotel.  
When she opened the bedroom door, a huge living room stretched out in front of her, and a familiar figure immediately caught her eye.  
He was sitting on the couch wearing headphones, with a pillow balanced on his lap and a laptop resting on top of it. He was wearing black loungewear and looked totally relaxed and casual.  
When he heard the bedroom door open, he looked up with those intense eyes of his.  
The man sitting there was her boss, Damian Cross.  
Wasn’t he supposed to be this legendary CEO who never got involved with anyone?  
Based on last night’s performance, he definitely wasn’t holding anything back. He’d acted more like a starving wolf who’d been locked up for decades.  
She stood there completely stunned and was about to say something when Damian spoke first.  
“I’m in a meeting.” His voice came out low and rough.  
Isabelle shut her mouth immediately because she knew exactly what he meant.  
“Come here and eat breakfast.” He leaned forward slightly and used his fingers to push a glass of milk across the coffee table, sliding it in front of another plate of food.  
But he didn’t notice that when he leaned forward, the hickeys all over his neck pressed right up against the camera, and every single executive in that meeting got a crystal-clear view.  
Isabelle’s face turned bright red with embarrassment. Those were probably hers—she hadn’t realized her, uh, suction skills were that intense.  
She really wished this was just some hotel room where she could walk out the door and go straight home.  
She sat down with shaky hands and kept her eyes wandering everywhere except at him. All she could do was obediently sip her milk and eat the sandwich that looked exactly like his.  
Damian had a reputation for being cold—cold personality, cold temper, just cold in every possible way. So yeah, Isabelle had basically messed with the wrong guy. She must’ve gotten in the wrong car last night.  
*But even if I got in the wrong car, why wouldn’t this ice-cold boss realize I was the wrong person? He’d just slept with an employee. Didn’t he care about his reputation at all?*  
Fifteen minutes later, he wrapped up the meeting and closed his laptop. Then he finally started eating his breakfast at this leisurely pace.  
“Sorry, I didn’t know it was your first time. I was a little rough.” His tone stayed just as cold as it had been during the meeting, and his face showed absolutely zero expression while he said it.  
Isabelle had just gotten her emotions under control, but now her face flushed red all over again.  
*What happened happened. Could you please just stop bringing it up?*  
“The family doctor will be here soon. Wait until after you see him before you go.” His voice was completely matter-of-fact.  
*Please, is he worried I’ll get pregnant with his kid and try to claim his fortune or something?*  
Isabelle finished the milk and picked up the glass of water next to her. She drank it slowly, one sip at a time, because she had no idea what to say to him.  
He ate really fast and finished everything in no time.  
“Just wait here. I still have to go into the office today, so I’ll have my assistant drive you home.”  
Isabelle quickly tried to stop him. “Mr. Cross, I can get home by myself. It’s no trouble at all.”  
“Are you saying I didn’t perform well enough last night?” He looked up slightly, and something in his expression almost seemed hurt.  
“What?” For some reason, Isabelle’s heart started pounding like crazy.  
*How could I possibly dare say that?* She was completely speechless and had no idea how to argue with what he’d just said. This was the first time in her life someone had verbally steamrolled her like this.  
If he wasn’t her boss, she would’ve already lost her temper and told him off.  
“Mr. Cross, Dr. Morgan is here.” An older maid appeared nearby.  
He didn’t say anything. He just kept watching Isabelle quietly.  
Isabelle was gorgeous—smooth, sun-kissed skin and beautiful golden hair. She was mixed race, and absolutely stunning.  
Her body was incredible too, the kind that made other guys jealous of whoever was dating her.  
All the staring made her uncomfortable, and her cheeks were already red before her whole body started heating up.  
“Come with me.” Damian’s voice cut through the tension, and he let out this barely audible sigh through his nose.  
Isabelle obediently followed him because what else was she going to do? She’d somehow managed to piss off one of the biggest names in fashion.  
When they got back to the bedroom where they’d gone at it all night, her heart started pounding and her palms got sweaty just looking at that bed.  
At least the maids had already cleaned everything up and made it spotless.  
A female doctor walked in, and then Damian walked out and closed the door behind him.  
Isabelle thought maybe she was getting the morning-after pill or a shot or something, but no. The doctor was there to examine her down there and apply medication.  
It was absolutely mortifying having someone else inspect last night’s damage like that.  
Though she had to admit, the ointment really did help with the soreness.  
She kept her hands covering her face the whole time because she wanted to die of embarrassment.  
When she finally came out, Damian was already gone.  
The only person waiting for her was Brian Hughes, Damian’s assistant.  
Brian was her age—they were both 22—and they’d graduated from the same university, interviewed at the same time, and started working on the same day. The only difference was their positions.  
He was Damian’s only assistant and pretty much his right-hand man.

Hurricane,Utah 
Friday, March 15, 2024 
6:00 a.m

It was the beginning of another day in the famous city of Hurricane. Sunlight softly reflected off the old vintage buildings as people hurried out of their homes toward work, and the neon signs of restaurants and diners flickered off one by one.
In the old suburbs of the city, in a quiet and cozy neighborhood, stood an old house—large, yet with a welcoming appearance.

In one of the rooms of this house, where sunlight delicately filtered through the curtains, the space was filled with posters and vintage objects. There, Emilly slept deeply in her bed, surrounded by stuffed animals and cozy blankets. Then, the persistent sound of the alarm clock echoed through the room, accompanied by the meow of Kitty, her black cat, waiting outside the window.
The young woman finally opened her eyes and reached out to turn off the alarm.

—Okay, okay… I’m awake, Kitty— murmured Emilly, her voice still heavy with sleep, as she stroked the cat’s head.

She slowly sat up in bed, her long, voluminous golden hair cascading over her shoulders. She picked up her phone from the nightstand to check her reminders and realized she had a meeting scheduled in two hours at the famous Freddy's Family Dinner.

—I still can’t believe I got an offer from such a big company like Fazbear Entertainment. I wonder what the owner himself wants to talk to me about— Emilly wondered aloud, a mix of curiosity and anxiety in her voice.

She then slowly got up and walked to the bathroom to get ready and take her medication.
For several long minutes, Emilly stared at her reflection in the mirror. The scars on her body drew attention—deep, irregular, unpleasant marks spread across nearly all her skin, except her face. They were silent reminders of a past she couldn’t fully recall and one of the main reasons she had suffered bullying at the old psychiatric orphanage where she had lived before finally leaving upon turning eighteen.

These thoughts began to fade when Kitty started rubbing around her legs, purring softly.
—Are you hungry, Kitty? I’ll put your food out in a moment, little glutton. I have a feeling today’s going to be a very long day— said Emilly, letting out a small smile after swallowing her last pills.



Freddy's Family Dinner 
Friday,March 15, 2024
7:50 a.m.

The day was sunny with only a few clouds in the sky. Emilly rode her small red scooter unhurriedly toward the famous Freddy's Family Dinner, still lost in thought about the email she had received from William Terrence Afton, the current owner of Fazbear Entertainment, a few days earlier. Of course, he was one of the four original co-founders of the company, alongside Henry Joel Emily, Edwin Davis Murray, and Fiona Margaret Murray. Yet, deep inside, Emilly felt an overwhelming discomfort mixed with fear whenever she saw or read about Mr. Afton.

She had often heard stories from some of the town’s older residents about the tragedies and incidents that had occurred at the company’s establishments during the seventies, eighties, and nineties—ranging from disappearances and murders of children and employees to bodies found inside animatronic suits. Although the police never caught the culprit, these cases were quietly shelved due to lack of evidence and company bribery. Over time, they gave rise to urban legends and rumors that the restaurants were haunted, though eventually, these tragedies were mostly forgotten, remembered only as tales to scare children.

As she thought about this, Emilly finally caught sight of the façade of the famous Freddy's Family Dinner, one of the many company restaurants still standing since the eighties. She parked her scooter in the crowded lot, despite it still being early. She looked toward the entrance and saw a crowd of people, mostly children, entering the massive building alongside their parents, wide smiles painted on their faces.

—What could be so special about this place?— Emilly wondered as she stepped inside the restaurant. Upon entering, she noticed a large reception area where a familiar old face stood behind the counter. Wearing the restaurant’s caricatured security uniform was Mike Schmidt, an old high school friend Emilly hadn’t seen in years.
—Mikey? Is that you?— Emilly asked.

—Emilly? Wow, what a surprise! It’s been ages since high school. How are you? Are you still in photojournalism and working as a freelance reporter?— Mike said, surprised to see her, despite his tired face, seemingly trying his hardest to stay awake while on the job.

—Yes, I am. I got an offer to work on a documentary and some reporting here, and I’m heading now to meet the owner himself. By the way, do you know where Mr. Afton might be?— Emilly asked.

Mike looked at Emilly with a weary expression and pointed in a direction.

—Ah, my boss… well, his office is backstage. I’ll ask Ness to help you since… I’m way too busy— Mike said.

—That won’t be necessary, Mike. I’m already here— said a voice. Suddenly, a man with a friendly appearance appeared, wearing glasses and a yellow bunny pin, accompanied by a young woman with pink and purple streaked hair tied in a ponytail, dressed in a security uniform like Mike.

—Ah, Vanessa, you brought your dad. I was just about to ask you to help Emilly find him— Mike said, returning to his work.

Vanessa nodded slightly, a faint smile on her lips, while William adjusted his glasses.

—Miss Emilly, it is a pleasure to finally meet you in person. I hope your trip here was pleasant— he said, extending his hand.

—It was fine, Mr. Afton— Emilly replied, shaking his hand while trying to mask the immense discomfort and fear growing inside her.

—Well, we have much to discuss, don’t we? Let’s go to my office, away from the noise— he said, gesturing for Emilly to follow him.
Emilly nodded and followed.

They passed through internal corridors where the sound of children laughing and cheerful music gradually gave way to a strange silence, broken only by the distant hum of machinery and the soft creak of the old floor. The walls were adorned with vintage Fazbear Entertainment posters—smiling mascots with unnaturally large eyes frozen in artificial poses.

For a brief moment, Emilly had the unsettling sensation that those eyes were following her.
William stopped in front of a wooden door and opened it.

—Please, make yourself comfortable. I believe this conversation will be very productive— he said with a polite smile.

Freddy's Family Dinner, Management Office
Friday, March 15, 2024
8:10 a.m.

The room was silent. Emilly sat in a chair, facing William, who was sipping a bit of coffee.
—Well, I suppose you’ve seen the email I sent you, haven’t you?— the man asked.

—Yes, I saw it a few days ago, but tell me, Mr. Afton… why would such a large and famous company like yours want a documentary and promotion produced by a small company like mine?— Emilly asked.

William let out a soft laugh and turned his gaze toward the window, observing the distant activity of the restaurant.

—To be honest with you, my young lady, I don’t trust these big media companies. They always find a way to twist everything involving Fazbear Entertainment, and it’s extremely difficult to disprove those lies once they spread. That’s why I’m looking for someone fair, competent… and with true journalistic talent. Someone like you— William replied.

Emilly took a deep breath.

—I see. So what exactly do you expect from me? A documentary? A promotional video? Or something beyond that?— Emilly asked.
William smiled. He then opened one of the drawers of his desk and pulled out a yellow envelope, which he carefully placed in front of her.

—Here is everything you need to know. I want a full documentary and a promotional video. In this document, I’ve listed the areas of the restaurant you may film and photograph… oh, and I also included the payment amount and the period you may stay with the company— the man said.

Emilly looked at the document and was quite surprised to see an incredibly high sum of money—enough to buy a larger studio, a team of professionals, and high-quality equipment. On top of that, the time frame was ten months. An offer impossible to refuse.

—So, Mrs. Campbell, do you accept the job?— William asked, extending his hand.

—You can count on me, Mr. Afton. I’ll give my best to create the documentary and promotional video— Emilly said, shaking his hand. William’s expression showed satisfaction at her response.

—Then welcome to our family. You’ll begin your work tomorrow night, as it’s the only time the restaurant isn’t busy— William said.
Emilly nodded, gathering the documents and standing up from the chair.

As she left the office, she had the strange sensation that the moment the door closed behind her, an unusual chill began to creep over her.
William Afton remained seated, watching the
closed door, his coffee slowly cooling on the table.

A subtle smile formed on his lips.

—Oh… this is going to be very fun— the man murmured.

Some people are polite, patient, say thank you, joke around, even apologize to an AI. Others are aggressive, dismissive, or treat it like trash just because “it’s not human.” And that contrast feels weirdly telling. If someone is kind when there’s no social reward, no pressure, no consequences — isn’t that low-key a green flag? Not saying this is a scientific personality test lol, but the way someone treats something that can’t judge them back might reflect how they act when power dynamics are skewed.

Do you start your day in a fog and end up late? I am here to fix that for one week.

​Who I am:

I'm a doctoral degree holder and fluent English speaker. My internal clock is naturally set for early mornings, so I'm wide awake and alert by 6:00 AM EST while you're still fighting your pillow. I'm a professional conversationalist who knows how to read people and provide the right level of ""firm but encouraging"" pressure.

​The ""Out-the-Door"" Package (1 Week Trial):

​The Wake-Up: A live call at your designated time (between 6:00 AM and 7:00 AM EST).

​The Conversation: We stay on the line while you perform your morning tasks (coffee, teeth, dressing). No falling back asleep on my watch.

​The Exit: The call only ends when I hear your front door lock or your car start.

​Duration: 5 consecutive weekdays.

​Why this works:

Unlike an app, you can’t ""mute"" a live person who is expecting a conversation. I will ask you about your goals for the day and ensure you are physically moving.

​Investment:

$50 USD for the week, paid upfront via \[PayPal\].

​Logistics:

We will use WhatsApp or Google Voice for privacy. I only have room for ONE client this coming week to ensure my full focus is on your schedule.

​If you are ready to stop being late, DM me your ""Out-the-Door"" goal time.",2,1769196101.0,accountability,0,1.0,False

I met my ex while we were in Delhi. It was love at first sight. While travelling back from a place we met. We had a mutual friend. She introduced us to each other. But somehow we couldn’t exchange number that day.

To share pictures of the day mutual friend created a group in which she added her. But i was not sure about what should i text her or what she will think if i randomly text her hi or something. 

But we had discussed about a event we both liked and we all were planning to go. Somehow i texted her about the passes of the event and she replied immediately. After that we texted each other the whole day chatting about different things. 

I wanted to meet her. But she was not ready. Even though we were few blocks away. It took sometime but then we started meeting in group for tea coffee and some other stuffs. 

Slowly steadily we started meeting alone. Holding each other hands, looking into each others eyes, sharing about each others life. Day by day we started getting closer and closer. We started going out, eating and meeting each other frequently. But she was not ready for relationship.

It took me almost six months to convince her to start dating. Once we started dating, we were both so happy with each other. We were travelling, going on dates, partying and having all the fun together.

Then because of job i had to shift from city. But we were firm about long distance and we were sure about each other. We celebrated 2nd anniversary together. We were even sure about thinking about future with each other.

But suddenly things started changing. She said we are not compatible and things wont work. I dont think we should compromise for life. I tried everything but she was firm for breakup. In the as there was no option she brokeup with me. I could even meet her while breaking up. 

Now its been six months, i think i am now again ready to meet new people and loce someone deeply again. If you are someone in same boat, i would love to connect and chat with you. ",1,1769196054.0,BreakUps,0,1.0,False
1ql06kg,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskElectricians/comments/1ql06kg/gfi_only_trips_downline_outlet_doesnt_cut_its_own/,GFI only trips downline outlet - doesn't cut its own power - + a host of electrical issues across multiple circuits - is the potential problem something obvious?,"I'm curious if anyone has any insight into what I might be dealing with. The electrician who has been here 8 times wired the place and still has no clue. 

Preface: It's an apartment. I have no control over who shows up or what they do. 

When I moved in 7 months ago the dishwasher breaker was tripped. It kept tripping 2x a week with no load. I wasn't even using it. I don't use appliances, either. Other than a coffee maker. It would trip overnight. 

The lights kept dimming in the kitchen, the stove, and dining room - all in rhythm with the fridge compressor kicking on, which I thought was the issue. Fridge got to 85 decibels, could be heard outside, I unplugged it, the fan and compressor were cleaned, screeching noise stopped, but the compressor has still been knocking and the lights are still dimming.

Electrician said ""the lights are old everything is AFCI it's sensitive nothing to worry about""

Then a month later I started smelling burning wires in the kitchen (a smell I know well). One outlet downline from the GFI lost power. I can reset it with the GFI button but the GFI outlet itself is not cutting its own power and the light stays green the whole time. 

A GFI outlet on the other side of the kitchen has been blinking red. Electrician says it doesn't mean anything when it blinks red.

Now two weeks after that appointment, the heater in the bedroom (central, baseboard) started tripping the bed/bath circuit immediately upon turning it on. Electrician replaced the thermostat. Heater stopped tripping the bed/bath circuit. He said the wires for the bed/bath and heater must be going up the wall together and the trip was caused by inductance.

But the next day turning on my range oven (electric) tripped the bed/bath circuit. So then he told me the wires for the bed/bath and range oven must be going up the wall together and the trip was caused by inductance.

He replaced three breakers that were related to the issues - the dishwasher breaker, the bed/bath breaker, and one for the kitchen. He also replaced the GFI connected to the outlet that was losing power... but he did not replace the GFI that was blinking red.

One of the breakers was a Siemen's AFCI that has a class action lawsuit for nuisance trips. But I was smelling burning wires and I'm still having problems in the kitchen with dimming lights on a set rhythm and the outlet cutting power while the GFI outlet maintains power, so I don't think that was the issue.

Nobody will check the refrigerator to see if it's drawing too much power, but I know it is because the lights all dim in rhythm with the compressor cycle.

Replacing the breakers solved the bed/bath circuit tripping (so far, we'll see...) but not the kitchen. I find it hard to think the issues are unrelated but I have no idea.

I've already had them out here 8 times. 

I swear he said on the first trip there's a shared neutral in the box, which I understand could be a problem. I'm not able to discern that myself visually, though.

Other than the refrigerator is there an obvious possible culprit or is this a lost cause since I can't control who comes out? I have a good electrician who did amazing work for me but this is an apartment and I don't call the shots.",1,1769196053.0,AskElectricians,3,1.0,False

He’s my first partner. At the beginning of our relationship, I wasn’t sure if I even wanted to be in a relationship yet. I wanted to take things slowly, but he was very romantic right away, and “I love you” meant much more to him than it did to me.

He was always very physically affectionate. If we were out with friends, he constantly needed to touch me, holding my arm, thighs, feet, hugging, kissing. Not in a toxic way, more like a lost puppy. I don’t mind affection, but it started to feel overwhelming and restrictive. We went to the same school, so this happened every lunchtime, and he would even kiss me in front of teachers. It made me really uncomfortable and felt disrespectful. I talked to him about it, and he stopped.

We have a lot in common, but we almost never actually do anything together.

In the first two years of our relationship, the only thing we did when we were alone was have sex. We went out maybe 3–4 times, always my idea, and even then he would want to leave early to go sit in his car. This also happened when we were out with friends.

I struggle with mental health issues. When something was bothering me, I would tell him clearly that I wasn’t asking him to fix anything. I just wanted him to listen and understand. Instead, he would either compare my situation to his (which felt very invalidating) or change the subject completely. Being ignored when you open up about something personal really hurts.

About 8 months ago, I left my parents’ home (basically ran away) and moved in with his parents. I’ve been trying to find a job for a long time with no success. I don’t care what kind of job it is. I just want some income. He works as a server, so I do most of the housework (laundry, cleaning, etc.). His mom and sister live here too; his sister is married and has two kids. So we do everything in house. But that doesn't mean I should search for his underwear all over the place or constantly cleaning after him.

When he gets home, I try to talk to him, make him coffee, and connect, but it feels pointless. He talks more to a friend he sees once a month than to me, even though we share a bed. When he plays games with that friend, he’s talkative and engaged. With me, I get short answers and no effort.

A few months ago, he got a new PC. Since then, his routine is work , games ,sleep. We barely communicate at all. Most of our conversations happen only when his family is around. When we’re alone, it’s silent.

I constantly ask him to do something with me. I don’t mean going out or spending money. I even made a list of free things we could do at home. He always says he’s tired, doesn’t know how, or “we’ll do it tomorrow.” We play similar games, but even when I asked to play together on his sister’s PS4, it never happened. He always had excuses, yet he plays with his friend.

On bad depression days, I can’t get out of bed. He used to ignore me completely until I sent him a long message about how I feel about our relationship. He told me that three years ago I asked him not to talk to me when I’m in a bad mood. Maybe I did but that was three years ago, and a lot has changed. After that conversation, he made some effort briefly, but it didn’t last. I don’t even remember the last time we had sex. He only initiates when he’s drunk.

I know he’s a good person. I really do. I feel guilty because he gave me a roof over my head and financially supports me right now. I feel like he deserves better. I know I’m not perfect either, and I’m willing to work on myself, but he never tells me what I do wrong. Every deep conversation is started by me. I just want honesty so I can try to fix things.

At the same time, I don’t see a future with him. I never wanted marriage or kids, and he used to agree. Recently, his family keeps bringing it up, and I think he’s changed his mind. That’s okay but kids are a dealbreaker for me, and I don’t want to hold him back if that’s what he wants.

I don’t know what to think anymore. I don’t know if I still have feelings for him, or if I’m staying because I’m scared. If we break up, I have nowhere to go. I don’t want to go back to my parents, and I don’t really have friends I can stay with. I also don’t want him to feel like I used him just to escape my family.

I feel stuck, confused, and guilty, and I don’t know what the right thing to do is.

TL;DR - My long-term relationship feels emotionally empty. We don’t spend time together, don’t communicate, and I’m unsure if I still have feelings or if I’m staying because I have nowhere else to go.

I (21F) am a barista, I’m mostly in charge or making orders and cleaning/ organizing the shop. I rarely have to interact with costumers, I try to engage in small talk with my coworkers to seem “normal” and practice my communication skills. I have high function ASD, I’m quite reserved and often find speaking to people complex and stressful. Growing up being homeschooled put a dent in my understanding or conversation and social queues. I’ve never flirted, or have been in a relationship. I’m working on improving this all little by little, it gives me extreme anxiety but I don’t want to feel helpless in life.

Anyways, there is this guy who come into my work who I’ve been crushing on for the past few weeks. He gets the same coffee each time, and when my coworkers, ( they are aware of this crush and encourage me ), tells me he’s here I always make it. I walk away to the back before he even sees which one of us made it, which is stupid, I know, but when I try handing it to him (which I’ve only done once) my hands shake uncontrollably. It’s so embarrassing x

For about 2 weeks now I’ve been writing a smiley face and my initial and a heart on his cup, even that was big step for me. 

“ :)  C ❤️” .

He smiles every time her sees it. It makes me so happy so see I made him smile, I start shaking and my nerves get all wacky. I think he’s out of my league, he’s gorgeous. But I really want to try making “a move”…however thats done.

My overall question; is what I’m doing creepy? Should I stop? Is this appropriate/ is this a normal way people flirt or show interest in one another? My coworkers say I should write my number/ socials on his cup and see what happens, but just thinking about doing that horrifies me.

Normal life of normal people seemed deeply sinful to me and I was always in my own mind, far away from reality. I denied every part if my body, personality, hobby, etc. because I thought all that was sinful and ""worldly"".

I always hyperanalized everything I did and I always found something that labels it as sinful. Even if act or hobby is slightly ""worldy"" or has not-100%-holy purpose I would completely dismiss it. So I was left with nothing basically because my all personhood is basically ""worldly"". I refused to make money more than my basic needs, I refused to get extra income, I didn't go anywhere (concerts, nightouts, socializing, coffee shops, malls, games, hangouts, ...). I was just extremely cautious not to sin or not to be even slightly unholy.

And now, I realize that I don't have it in myself. I don't have that active go getter attitude. I don't want to use what is in front of me, I don't have any internal motivation for anything because for 20+ years all that was to-be-rejected. I don't have willingness to get mental help or even physical help because I don't see living in world worthy. I don't have that ""I want to fight my mental illness so I can live fully"" attitude because ""living fully"" in this world is deeply wrong and worthless to me.

This is the irregular era you could kind of say. But when regular someeetimesssss its good if im like yes properly working and so therefore also based on day to day activity even then id eat just sufficient or like okay upto the mark that i have set in my head.

Monday: I've been having this murmura ladux2 so that and then thepla 2.5 and then 1.5 pack of maggie. 

Wednesday: I don't even remember a few (1/2) dates filled with a coconut dryfruit filling and a new drink I tried after seeing a chocomalt milk recipe on instagram made of ragi and wanting to have it so bad so tried that and loveddddd it. And Dhokla.
Winter came and it was so difficult to fulfill my protiem intake and i was used to whey cold coffee as my protien source in summer so yah and wasn't able to take whey with anything else and as its bidding its goodbyes ive finally found a recipe for my winter protein intake and winter bulk. Wanted to do one this winter couldn't ofc.

I walk away to the back before he even sees which one of us made it, which is stupid, I know, but when I try handing it to him (which I’ve only done once) my hands shake uncontrollably. It’s so embarrassing x

For about 2 weeks now I’ve been writing a smiley face and my initial and a heart on his cup, even that was big step for me.

“ :)  C ❤️” .

He smiles every time her sees it. It makes me so happy so see I made him smile, I start shaking and my nerves get all wacky. I think he’s out of my league, he’s gorgeous. But I really want to try making “a move”…however thats done.

My overall question; is what I’m doing creepy? Should I stop? Is this appropriate/ is this a normal way people flirt or show interest in one another? My coworkers say I should write my number/ socials on his cup and see what happens, but just thinking about doing that horrifies me. I don’t know what I’m doing but I’ve been thinking about the situation outside or work now and it bothers me. Is this weird?",0,1769195339.0,Advice,2,0.5,False
1qkzu7n,https://i.redd.it/bi7sqknyd5fg1.jpeg,World outside Zootropolis,"Hey 👋🏼 
I am just posting stories of what life looks like outside Zootropolis. What is going on outside Judy and Nick. There loads of great posts about Judy and Nick (I'm shipper) but I am veeeery curious about what else are out there. What does the world looks like? What other animals are up to? What mysteries are there? 

I recently posted drawing of character I created called Molly Foxglove. Now I'm starting to get very curious what her life would looks like. Because she is assistant curator, I took her into her workplace in the art gallery, and there are plenty of things going on. 

Molly is chatting with two birds on the bookshelf - Harry Lopez and Roger Hawkins. They all kept getting in trouble with their supervisor - Reginald Peacocke who just overheard them chatting way too much. He had his eyes on them constantly. Harry and Roger usually the one that gobs way too much and Molly gets easily distracted by them. 

Reginald Peacocke is supervisor and he can be snob but he cares about his team. 

The penguin that was running is Nora Waddleton. She is receptionist that always on the clock, updating everyone timetables and making everyone coffee. She was supposed to be at the desk in the gallery, but somehow she was running around all the time.

The hedgehog is called Gizmo Thompson. He doesn't have clothes that suit his body so he end up with holey shirt. He had many of them at home. He is little bit crazy but in general is nice. 

The rooster is Oscar Cluckspeare. He is quiet unless he had something important to say.

The dalmatian pelican is their boss, Samuel Dockery. He is one of those nasty boss that just makes your life difficult as much as possible. Reginald is hoping he will retire soon so he can take the management role and take over the gallery. Dockery just won't retire and Reginald don't understand why. ",4,1769195302.0,zootopia,0,1.0,False

It’s very different from the hoof! More gain on tap. Less mid forward. More controlled. Tighter. I really like this pedal. More a distortion than a fuzz? Sounds f&@#%ing awesome.

My current situation is that I have a Roth IRA with $23k, a travel fund (I have weddings this year and enjoy traveling) with $2.2k, a general high yield savings with $1,000, and my emergency fund which has $1,200 in it. I only have been saving for travel and emergency fund since November of 2025 due to unfortunate circumstances last year.

I have $24k student debt that I pay down every month, and I am in $7,000 of credit card after financial hardship last year on a 0% interest credit card until June 2027 that my partner and I are actively paying down every month. When I saw the bill at the vet, I put it on the no interest credit card. But, this would put me at over $8,000 on the credit card. I am thinking I’ll use my emergency savings, which would drain the account, but at least I would be in less debt?

What are your thoughts? Should I leave the vet bill on the credit card and pay it off and keep adding to my emergency fund? Or should I pay off the $1,100 immediately and just start replenishing my emergency savings? 

I’m asking you to be kind and not judge my situation, I am trying to save money and cutting back on everyday high spending habits (coffee, ordering food. I am implementing no buy days, and have made a “no buy list” of things I just won’t buy new or used this year at all to improve my financial situation). I just want to know the best way to approach this situation for my wallet and savings. ",2,1769195149.0,moneyadvice,2,1.0,False
1qkzrj3,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_scottjohnday/comments/1qkzrj3/mf_the_promise_keeper_part_1/,[MF] The Promise Keeper  Part 1,"Bob Long trudged up the mountain trail. Winter had not released its grip on the mountain yet. Bob normally wouldn't be up on the mountain this early in the year, but he made a promise to his Dad. He just had to be extra careful on the trail. He knew the dangers of hiking the trail in the spring. There would be patches of ice covered by a thin layer of snow. The ground had started to thaw and could shift and toss a person into a ravine. He shouldn't be up here but he had to keep his promise. 

While Bob was still a toddler his Dad Jerry bought an eighty acre parcel in the mountains that didn't have much on it but an old cabin and a spring. His Dad always said that this was all that you needed to live a better life than you could have in the city. You could find peace here. His father always taught him the mountains are the safest place to be. The cities are where it is dangerous.

Every summer it was almost a ritual that they would hike up to the mountain summit behind the property. It took a day to hike in and another day to hike out. They would wake up before sunrise and watch the sun rise behind the mountains. It was almost a religious moment. To recognize that the sun had risen over those mountains since the beginning of time and would continue to do the same long after they were gone was both humbling and empowering at the same time.  

Bob's Dad always told him no matter how bad your problems may seem, the sun will continue to rise over those mountains. Will those problems seem so significant in a year, or ten years from now? Spend your time finding a solution. It is a problem only until you find a solution, then it simply becomes a situation that has to be dealt with. 

That advice that Bob received watching the sun rise over the mountains when he was a preteen served him well all through his life. 
When he started working with the Fire Department as an EMT it especially came in handy. When arriving on a scene and everyone was in a panic, it became second nature. Evaluate what the situation is, find a solution, and execute the plan. That saved time and saved lives when every second counted.

It was on one of their hikes to the summit and they were packed up and about to hike down the mountain that Jerry took a long look at the scene that unfolded before him. He called Bob over to stand beside him. Jerry was in a very serious mood as he slowly said “When I die, promise me you will have me cremated then bring my ashes up to this spot and cast my ashes out over the mountain as the sun rises over the mountains. Will you promise me to do that?” 

Bob immediately asked if he was sick, and his Dad smiled “No, I am  fine. I had a friend that died recently and he hadn't specified his wishes. His family descended into an all out war over every detail. I don't want that to happen to me and leave you to deal with that. I am meeting with my lawyer to get it all in writing. I just want your promise to carry out my wishes. You are the only one left who I know will do it. There are ones in my family that are greedy and would do something like that.” After hearing that, Bob promised his Dad to carry out his wishes.

As Jerry was getting close to retirement he was looking forward to moving up to the cabin. He was ready to leave the city behind. He was an executive for a large firm. It paid very well but was extremely high stress. Jerry only had just over a year left until his retirement day. He actually had a large calendar with a countdown to his retirement. It was an exciting 
time for Jerry.

Then Bob got the call. His Dad had a massive heart attack at work. He was found still at his desk. The only consolation Bob had was that it happened quickly and his Dad didn't suffer. At his memorial many spoke of Jerry's dedication and dying with his boots on. Bob was disgusted, it was the job that killed him. There were family members that were there that were asking for certain items. His Dad was right about relatives. Bob told them that they had to wait until the reading of the will. Everything still belonged to his Dad until then. A lot of grumbling but Bob stood firm.

At the reading of the will they all showed up. Relatives showed up that Bob hadn't seen in decades, some he never saw in his life. It had gotten around that Jerry was loaded so they were trying to get their cut. The reading of the will was what Bob was expecting, except for one caveat that displayed Jerry's twisted sense of humor. The attorney read the preamble with a straight face. “This is the last will and testament of Jerry Long. Any who dispute my wishes or any person or persons who dispute, disagree with or attempt to receive anything other than what I specify in this document at any time shall be disinherited and will automatically forfeit any portion of my estate. All of my worldly belongings as listed below, I leave to my son Bob with the exception of,” the attorney paused and covered his face while he tried to mask his chuckle with a cough. He then resumed “with the exception of, to the rest of my lowdown and greedy relatives I leave the following, the garbage I forgot to take out, it should be nice and ripe by now and the contents of the pit under my outhouse.”

Most of the relatives stormed out cussing out loud. Jerry's sister, Bob's Aunt Nancy came up laughing and put her hand on Bob's shoulder. She coughed out between her fits of laughing “Oh gosh, that was classic Jerry. He really outdid himself with that one. I'm going to have to take notes for my will.” Then she broke out into another fit of laughing. 

Bob always liked his Aunt Nancy. She was one of the few of his Dad's family that he saw growing up. She had moved in for a while when his Mom died to care for him and his Dad. When she calmed down she said she had to go. Bob gave her a long hug and asked her to stay in touch, he would love to get together and share stories about his Dad. When he looked at her she had a tear running down her cheek. She said that she would love to do that.

When Bob was cleaning out his Dad's house, there was a countdown calendar on the wall beside the refrigerator. He looked at it. His Dad was down to 381 days until retirement. Bob slowly took it down. 

Bob received his Dad's ashes so it was time to keep his promise. Bob packed his SUV and headed for the property. The morning after he arrived at the cabin he took off to keep his promise. 

He was going slower than usual because he was lost in memories of his Dad and the many times they had hiked this trail. The trail had slick spots where it was shaded so he was being careful. When Bob was halfway up the mountain he was lost in his memories of his Dad. He didn't watch where he was stepping and stepped on a slick spot. When he did that, Bob slipped off the trail and fell down the forty foot slope to the bottom of the ravine. The backpack protected his back but his foot caught on something and Bob felt the searing pain immediately. 

As Bob lay crumpled at the bottom of the ravine, the first thing he thought of was what his Dad told him all those years ago. He only had to find a solution then it would only be a situation that he would have to get through. First he checked his ankle. He wasn't going anywhere on that ankle for a day or two. It was sprained but not broken. He always carried a roll of duck tape with him while camping. He taped his ankle to immobilize it. He could hobble around a bit so he set up his tent. He had planned on camping at the summit so he had food and water with him. A tree that had blown over in a storm was close by so he got some limbs to build a fire. He found a long straight stick. He fashioned a crude spear in case a hungry animal came by. It may be enough to dissuade it and get it to move along. 

After a day of rest, Bob felt he could make it off the mountain safely. Using the spear as a walking stick, he set off. It took him all day to make it back to the cabin. As he thought about it, his Dad would be thrilled to know that they had one last adventure together. He pulled out his Dad's favorite Scotch. He drank a shot then had a second shot for his Dad. “Here's to you Dad.”

After a few days at the cabin Bob was ready to finish what he came to do. He packed up the bottle of Scotch that he had been drinking from. He carried his walking stick with him as a reminder. He still had to be careful but he arrived at the summit by late afternoon. He set up his camp and turned in. He had to be up before sunrise tomorrow. It was going to be a big day. 

Bob woke up an hour before sunrise. He had a quick breakfast then prepared to complete his promise. He hadn't thought about what he was going to say as he released his Dad's ashes. He decided to improvise and speak from the heart. It wasn't like anyone would be there to listen if he messed up. As the sun peeked out from the horizon Bob stood at what his Dad called the Overlook. It was where they always watched the sunrise.

Bob said what came to his heart. “Dad, you may be gone but you will always be with me in my heart. You will be there in the sun and in the rain. You will be with me in my big moments and in the small quiet moments. I will always love you and I have always been so happy that you were my father.” 

Bob then pulled out the ashes and scattered the ashes over the mountain as the sun fully came up fully. He next pulled out the Scotch and drank a shot then poured a shot over the ashes. There was a trunk from a massive tree that had fallen decades ago. He and his Dad would always sit on the trunk after watching the sunrise and talk. So he sat there just replaying the conversations they had sitting there. He spent the night there then headed back to the cabin the next morning.

Months later when he was headed up to the cabin again, Bob invited his Aunt Nancy to go with him. She enthusiastically agreed. When they got to the cabin, Bob informed Nancy of the ritual he and his Dad had. He mentioned that he wasn't sure if she would want to join him. It was an all day and difficult hike. He had slipped on the trail once and hurt his ankle. He had the walking stick to prove it. She laughed at him, “If you can do it, you better believe I can do it.” 

At first light the next morning they left for the summit. Bob was thinking that they may not make it all the way when they started. He had her in front of him so he could keep an eye on her. Every time he asked her if she needed a break, she would simply smile back at him and pick up the pace. 

By lunch time Bob was worried he wouldn't be able to keep up with her. It was chilly when they left so Nancy dressed in layers. As the day warmed up she started stripping off layers until she was in shorts and a T-shirt. It was the first time Bob realized just how fit and toned his Aunt was. He had always seen her in loose fitting clothes. She was in better shape than a lot of girls his age. No wonder she was making him struggle to keep up.

When they reached the summit Bob was winded. He raised up his hands in surrender. “I give up. I should never have questioned you. I never knew you were so fit.” Nancy gave a devilish laugh and said “I love being under estimated. It gives me the advantage every time. Do you believe me now?” Bob just smiled. He said weakly “Aunt Nancy…” 

Bob was silenced by her angry look. She sneered “First of all, no more of this Aunt Nancy. That makes me feel ancient. My friends call me Nancy, unless you would rather be my enemy.” Bob knew that he would come out on the losing end of that one so meekly said “Nancy it is from now on.” Nancy gave him a warm smile and patted his cheek.

Bob suggested they turn in as they needed to be up before sunrise. The next morning they were up and standing at the Overlook. Once the sun cleared the horizon, Bob sat on the stump. Nancy stayed there by herself. Finally she called Bob over. As he walked up he could see she had been crying. 

She took hold of his hands and looking in his eyes said in a sad voice “Jerry looked after me my entire life and kept me safe. I haven't felt safe since Jerry died. Will you promise to look after me and keep me safe like Jerry did? Please?” She was searching Bob's eyes, pleading. “Of course  Au .. uh, Nancy.” She thought for a minute then said “Promise your father. I know you would never break a promise to your father. Promise him!” Bob didn't know what to say so he said out loud “Dad, I promise you I will look after Nancy and keep her safe.” Nancy threw her arms around Bob, hugged him tight and didn't let go. She cried on his shoulder.

Nancy drank Scotch all day. By that evening she was quite inebriated. Bob told her that they were supposed to be headed to the cabin in the morning so they should turn in. As they lay there Bob heard Nancy stir, then in little more than a whisper “Bob, will you hold me? I don't feel safe.” Nancy crawled over and Bob hugged her.

Nancy started to tell him stories about his Dad's childhood he had never heard. “Our parents were both alcoholic, and when they would drink which was always, they would fight and things got crazy. Jerry would take a beating but wouldn't let our parents beat on me. As far back as I can remember, as soon as things started to get crazy, Bob would grab me and slip out the door with me. He had found a little clearing in the woods behind our house that we called the secret fort. I couldn't say anything to anyone about it. Jerry would hug me tight to keep me warm. Over time he built a shelter so we could stay out multiple days. Jerry would pick up odd jobs from the neighbors to buy food that he stored at the fort so I wouldn't go hungry. When I was fifteen Jerry left to attend the University. Without Jerry to protect me my life spiraled. I started to take the whiskey that my parents left out when they were drunk. I kept it hidden in a thermos in my closet. I was going to school drunk everyday and wound up with my boyfriend. My boyfriend would get me drunk then take advantage of me. He didn't know the meaning of no, then after he had his way he would beat me.”

“Jerry showed up at home unexpectedly and saw the bruises. I never saw him so angry before. He grabbed me and took me to the fort. He made me tell him everything. He took off and I didn't see him until late the next day. I never saw my boyfriend again. The only thing I heard was he suddenly left town.”

“Jerry took me to the fort and had a heart to heart talk with me. He told me how disappointed he was in me. I would have rather been beaten. He asked if I wanted to be just like Mom? Because that is where I was headed. That really hurt. He made me promise not to drink again. If I would keep that promise he would have me come to live with him as soon as I graduated high school. I kept my promise and he kept his. Jerry had been hired as soon as he graduated. He had an apartment by then and moved me in.” 

“Jerry insisted that I enroll in the University, that I needed an education. It was there that I met the man I later married. After I was married for a few years, I became suspicious that my husband was cheating. Working late all the time, work conferences out of town, it just didn't add up. I mentioned it to Jerry and he told me not to worry, he would check into it. Nothing was said for several weeks until my husband told me he was going to a work conference. Then I received a call that there had been an accident and neither occupant survived. I got a copy of the accident report and my husband had a married coworker with him. His pants around his knees indicated distracted driving.”

“I know that my husband thought life insurance was a scam but he had signed up for nearly a million dollar policy. I know Jerry had something to do with the insurance, but I don't know about the rest of it. He never said anything and I never asked, like I never asked about my boyfriend that disappeared.” 

“So when your Mom died of cancer, I took care of him. I made sure you had everything and tried to fill the spot your Mom left. I'm not sure how well I did.” 

Bob took a deep breath. He slowly said “There wasn't anyone who could have done any better. I knew that I was loved, although I know I was a real pain. I couldn't understand why my Mom left. I was still too young to understand what had happened. So I acted out.”

Nancy hugged Bob tighter and snuggled in closer. Bob woke up just before dawn and Nancy was still snuggled up beside him. He thought of his Dad holding her tight to keep her warm those nights at the fort. He thought about how that affected her for the rest of her life psychologically. He hugged her tighter and drifted back to sleep.

Bob was considering staying another day at the summit or he would wind up carrying Nancy down the mountain. As Bob was considering the options, Nancy popped her head in the tent. “Are you going to stay in bed all day, sleepyhead? Coffee is ready.” She then flashed him a dazzling smile. How could he resist an invitation like that? As soon as they had breakfast and packed up, they made one more stop at the Overlook. As they stood there looking out, Bob thanked her for telling him about his Dad's early years. He had never heard about that. It gave him a deeper respect and understanding for his Dad. 

They headed down the mountain with Nancy taking the lead and Bob had trouble keeping up with her. Here was a woman that drank nearly an entire bottle of Scotch yesterday and now she was practically running a very difficult trail. He didn't drink a tenth of what she did and it was affecting him today. Bob couldn't understand it.
One of life's great mysteries.

When Bob dropped Nancy off at her house, he helped her carry her bags to the door. She invited him in, but Bob told her that he would love to but he had to be up early for work in the morning. She looked at him almost apologetic “Can you hug me? I'm sorry, Jerry was my rock and anchor my entire life. Once he died, I’ve been a mess. I'm scared. When Jerry went away to school, I tried to have someone else hold me but they took advantage of me. I was used and abused all my life. Especially at home once Jerry wasn't there to protect me. The only time I felt safe was when Jerry held me. And you are just like Jerry.”

Bob wrapped her in a tight hug and softly said “I promised both you and my Dad to take care of you didn't I?” Nancy started crying softly. “It seems so long since I felt safe.” Once Nancy calmed down Bob asked if she was feeling better now? She nodded then gave him a quick kiss with a smile. Bob told her to call him if she needed anything. Her smile widened and she said with a twinkle in her eye “That goes both ways, give me a call if anything comes up.” She gave him another kiss and whispered in his ear “Thank you.”

One evening Nancy was dropping some things off for Bob when she noticed that Bob was in pain when he moved. She asked what happened. Bob told her that he was called out to a bad accident. Someone was trapped in a car and he had strained his back trying to get the person out. Nancy suddenly became very serious and ordered Bob into the shower. “Get the water as hot as you can take it. That will relax the muscle.” 

As soon as the shower turned off Nancy rushed in and pulled him over to the bed. He didn't even have time to protest that he wasn't dressed or dry. She already had towels laid out on the bed and had him lay on them. It was then that Bob realized that she had changed into one of his old T-shirts. Nancy started massaging his back and he felt himself melt under her hands. When she moved to his head and shoulders, he felt like a rag doll and couldn't move if he had to. He vaguely remembered her working on his legs and feet, he had never felt so relaxed in his life. He passed out at that point.

I asked if anything negative stood out and they replied with this 

“ Ithink some people naturally give off a warm-natured personality, and some don’t. It’s difficult too when you are interviewing and you want to be viewed as professional. Find a way to make the process fun and invite people into your head. It puts you on their level and eases the tension that surrounds interviews. Usually, I treat interviews like coffee with friends. Doing that has always landed me the position I was after.

One day I posted my girlfriend and me on social media (I’m femme-presenting, my girlfriend is masc-presenting, and this friend is also masc-presenting). My friend replied saying we were “goals,” and it came up that we should all hang out together.

Since then, we’ve gone out together a few times (clubbing, drinking, etc.). For context, my friend doesn’t have a girlfriend.

Recently, my friend came back from a trip and asked my girlfriend to get coffee, she wanted to give us a souvenir, I was working that day, but I don’t think I was invited at all. That already made me feel a bit off, but I tried not to overthink it. 

Then later, my friend texted my girlfriend something along the lines of: “Do you think [my name] would be upset if [friend’s friend] and I steal you?” My girlfriend initially thought the message meant I was invited too, but when I read it, it was clear that I wasn’t—it was just them.

What’s bothering me isn’t that my girlfriend has friends—I’m fine with that. It’s that this was originally someone that I introduced, both of our friend at this point. I already spoke to my partner and I don’t think she understands my perspective. All she asked was, “aren’t you happy that i’m getting along with your friends?” The wording of the text also made me uncomfortable, especially since it seems like they assumed I might not be okay with it.

For context, we’re all queer women, and both my girlfriend and my friend are masc-presenting. I don’t know if that matters, but I’m mentioning it in case it affects how people interpret the dynamic.

Am I overreacting for feeling uncomfortable and excluded here? Or is this something that would reasonably bother other people too?

I forgot to add that they also decided to pregame at our (my and my gf’s apt).",2,1769194756.0,WLW,4,1.0,False

Exclusively pumping while traveling is a lot. I'm lugging my pump, a separate Yeti cooler, ice packs, milk bags, cleaning supplies, etc., through airports and to and from the hotel and office.

I've noticed that some nursing rooms in airports are clean, while others really need some TLC. 

I got annoyed when I asked the hostess at a Chill's in the airport if they had ice to fill my Ceres Chill, I mentioned it was for medical reasons and she told me no. I could literally see the bar, so it felt

frustrating because I know they have ice. 😑 If she'd said, ""only for paying customers,"" I would've happily bought a drink.

Meanwhile, Dunkin's customer service was much nicer - they said yes, so I bought a coffee from them.

The Marriott I'm staying at has also been supportive and is keeping my ice packs frozen for me, which I really appreciate. Since there's only a fridge in the hotel room.

## 🖤 From Chaos to Calm: Why Adult Coloring Isn’t Just Child’s Play (Free Download Inside)

I used to think coloring books were strictly for kids — tiny hands gripping crayons, doodling dragons and rainbows without a care in the world.  

Then, one evening after a long, soul‑sapping workday, I tried it myself. Just me, a cup of tea, and 30 minutes of coloring. Something magical happened — my brain quieted down. Stress levels? Dropped. Overthinking? Paused.  

Turns out, those “childish” pages are a secret therapy session we all forgot we needed.  

Let me share a few truths most adults discover once they try mindful coloring:  
• Coloring taps into the same part of the brain used in meditation — deep focus replaces anxiety.  
• It gives you a tangible way to *finish something beautifully*, even if the rest of your day was chaos.  
• The simplest lines and shapes can pull you right back into the present moment (no yoga mat required).  

That’s why we designed a **free adult coloring book PDF**, filled with art that soothes but still inspires — botanical patterns, mandalas, and elegant scenes that restore calm after a hectic day.  

👉 **Download Your Free Coloring Book PDF Here:** [https://cashflowmanifest.com/Free-ebook](https://cashflowmanifest.com/Free-ebook)

I’ve heard from hundreds of people using it as their *5‑minute evening ritual*. Some color while listening to lo‑fi beats; others use it as a mini morning meditation with coffee. It’s simple mindfulness — no seconds wasted scrolling, no pressure to be perfect.  

If you’re new to adult coloring, here’s a few insider tips:  
🖍️ Forget perfection — just *flow*.  
🌈 Use whatever pencils or digital tools you have.  
☕ Pair coloring with your favorite drink or playlist — it’s basically therapy wrapped in color.

We made this to help people unwind, focus, and reconnect with small joys again.  
It’s easy to forget we deserve pauses, too.  

So if you’re ready to trade doomscrolling for daydreaming, try this little act of peaceful rebellion — one page at a time.

But recently I have started to develop some sort of mental paranoia because of a specific question that my head had about Islam. So I am not talking about hadiths or continuation, my question is since arabic is a complex language and has different meanings for each word how do we know that we know about the quran is even the right meaning ? Seriously like I dont know if Im just completely crazy but I often see guys that says this verse doesnt mean this and things like that, so it led me to question the entire reliability of the arabic language, if we can do this with one verse why cant we do it with another verse and so on. This would mean nothing can be clear and the Quran could convey a whole other message that we dont know in arabic since mistranslations could be possible. So this puts me in a psychosis of not knowing what is right or wrong or not knowing actually ANYTHING. What if the whole translation was mistranslated what if a word that could mean something meant the complete opposite\*\*.\*\* What if marriage and family was completely haram, what if alcohol was halal what if we had to pray a different month during ramadan, it feels like psychological torture like thinking that the good that we know is bad and the that the bad might be good. Because I have no proof that it is the right translation, marriage could as well mean coffee, war could mean tree and fire could mean apple in arabic. And the argument I often get is the fact that there were poems in Arabic back then that were using these terms in this specific way, it doesnt really solve it, it amplifies it because nobody said that God was going to use the most common term to talk. He might have used the less known meanings. So it feels like a complete psychosis where Im being paranoid of everything. Also people tell me that the hadiths show that the prophet PBUH did what is written in the Quran which means its well translated but again the hadiths themselves run into the same issue that is in the arabic language in general, terms could mean different things, I feel like everything could be a lie told by translators and that we cant know anything, and i say that myself as an arabic speaker (north african so not perfect arabic), this terrifies me constantly.",1,1769194173.0,MuslimAcademics,2,1.0,False

Before then, I had been using nicotine for probably ~8 years (juul, cigs, zyn, chops). I had been using zyns for ~3 years, and anywhere between 4-6 pouches a day. I stopped because I had a few instances where I would become incredibly lightheaded and feel as though I was going to pass out in conjunction with some chest pain on the left side just below my clavicle. This happened 3 times.

The first two times this happened I was pretty hungover and attributed it to that. The third time was the worst. It happened at work when I was not hungover and pretty much sent me into a panic attack. I left work and went to urgent care where they said that everything looked fine (ekg, BP, chest x ray, blood test, troponin). I was pretty spooked and anxious after that and didn't feel like I wanted a zyn, so 2 days went past without me having one.
Then, I stumbled upon this sub and found a bunch of other people saying that they had similar symptoms as what I was feeling and kept the streak going.

Now, 17 days in -I still am feeling pretty anxious and having a lot of brain fog/fatigue. There was a couple of days earlier this week where I felt pretty good, but it's crept back. I used to have a lot of coffee daily, but it's been feeling like it makes me more anxious as of late. The chest pains have definitely subsided.

I'm wondering for anyone else who had similar use to mine - when can I expect the brain fog and anxiety let up? I definitely don't plan on going back to Zyns - but I'm hoping this goes away soon.",1,1769194000.0,QuittingZyn,0,1.0,False

I just found out I passed my second attempt in 85 questions after failing in 150! \*\*All of my praise goes to God!!!\*\* TRULY!!! 

I wanted to share my two cents on \*\*HOW TO PASS THE NCLEX:\*\*

\*\*\*✨MY FIRST ATTEMPT\*\*\* \*(failed in 150)\*

\* \*\*What I studied:\*\*

   \* Listened to Mark K lectures 1-12

   \* Arch3r (I took one CAT exam and passed, and I took 7 readiness exams and got VH, VH, BL, VH VH, H, H in that order. No practice questions)

   \* Listened to Dr Sharon must know meds 1-10 videos

\* \*\*How the exam went:\*\*

   \* Walked in feeling confident

   \* Finished in 150 questions, it felt way harder than any nursing exam I’ve ever taken

   \* I think I had 7 case studies, one bow tie, one picture to identify, etc

   \* I left knowing I failed... it was awful

\*\*\*✨MY SECOND ATTEMPT\*\*\* (passed in 85)

\* \*\*What I studied:\*\*

   \* NCLEX Crusade on YouTube (red and blue background videos)

   \* NCLEX Bootcamp 30 days

   \* Dr Sharon on YouTube

   \* Listened to Mark K lecture 12 on the way to my exam

\* \*\*How the exam went:\*\*

   \* Walked in feeling confident (paranoid but confident)

   \* Finished in 85 questions, it was WAY easier than my first attempt

   \* I had 5 case studies (they all felt quite easy expect for the 5th one was kinda hard), lots of multiple choice

   \* I left feeling certain that I passed!!! I literally cried tears of joy when I got in my car

\*\*\*✨WHAT I RECOMMEND STUDYING:\*\*\*

\* \*\*NCLEX Crusade 7 day training on YouTube\*\*

   \* Red background videos

   \* Blue background (NGN) videos

   \* I thought the info in these vids were pretty obvious but it was a nice way of re-introducing studying when I was still grumpy about retaking lol. It introduces test strategy well

\* \*\*NCLEX Bootcamp!!!\*\*

   \* I followed the 30 day study plan. I truly love bootcamp, and it made the studying process somewhat enjoyable (or at least, way more bearable)

   \* I wanted to make SURE I gave it my all to pass my second attempt, and I think Bootcamp definitely strengthened my knowledge & prepared me to accomplish that

   \* \*\*\*My Bootcamp stats:\*\*\*

\* I finished all case studies + watched the review videos (so helpful!)

\* I did 1830 questions of the Q bank (read all rationales and took notes on only some)

\* Did all of the fundamentals questions & repeated the ones I got wrong until I got them right (NCLEX loves fundamentals!!)

\* Overall performance was 72%

\* I got very high on every readiness exam (73%, 79%, 71%, 74%)

\* \*(The most important thing is to do a ton of practice questions and READ THE RATIONALES and understand WHY you got it wrong)\*

\* \*\*Dr Sharon on YouTube\*\*

   \* “Prioritization strategies” playlist (watch all of the videos)

   \* “Fundamentals” playlist (for any topics you struggle with)

   \* She’s great for understanding test strategy! I would pause her videos to do the practice question by myself and then unpause to see how she explained her thought process

\* \*\*NCSBN has an NCLEX exam preview\*\*

   \* I didn’t do this, but if you wanted extra study practice, there’s an NCLEX preview exam on the NCSBN website

   \* There’s a quizlet with the correct answers to check your work

\*\*\*✨My MISTAKES the first time:\*\*\*

\* \*\*I only took practice tests.\*\* I remediated those exams but didn’t look at the categories I was doing good/bad in. It wasn’t a comprehensive approach

\* \*\*I didn’t take breaks during my study sessions.\*\* I literally only took practice exams with no breaks. It burnt me out. For my second attempt, some days I'd do 20 questions at a time then a break and then more questions, and some days I'd lock in for a practice exam. It wasn't nonstop grind every day

\* \*\*I didn’t do any practice Qs\*\*. It’s so helpful to get immediate feedback on questions right after you answered it so that you can immediately correct yourself & evaluate your thought process. Then test yourself with practice exams to simulate the exam

\* \*\*I didn’t reaaally think I needed to study!\*\* I had a 3.96 GPA, did very well on the exit exam, my college has a 96% pass rate, Arch3r said I had >98% chance of passing. But I didn’t do a comprehensive study approach and didn’t realize I was lacking in a few knowledge areas— then the NCLEX noticed I was getting those topics wrong and kept testing me on them 

   \* (for example, I didn’t realize I struggled with infection control. But I still scored well on the practice tests before my first attempt because I performed well enough on the rest of the test and didn’t review the categories of where I needed to study more. Then on my first attempt of the NCLEX, it kept giving me infection control Qs because I was getting them wrong and then it led me to being on the cusp of passing. All I needed was a little refresher on infection control rules, but I didn’t realize that until after I failed and looked into it)

\* \*\*I didn’t know that the NCLEX was more of a critical thinking exam\*\* and not simply a content exam. Idk maybe I was living under a rock but no one told me this?? I was freaked out on my first attempt when I got diseases, meds, etc that I had NEVER heard of, and then I just thought “well I never learned about this, so I guess I have to guess??” I didn't know the strategy. I wish I knew that critical thinking is the WHOLE POINT of the NCLEX! If you don’t know something, use critical thinking skills + use the strategies from Bootcamp rationales & Dr Sharon videos

\* Also, just a side note, \*\*consider not telling anyone when you’re taking the test.\*\* It takes the pressure off. And it killed me having to tell all of my friends, family, etc that I failed (especially because they all expected me to pass without a doubt, so I felt like even more like a let down lol. Very humbling!)

\*\*\*✨CRITICAL THINKING ADVICE:\*\*\*

\* \*\*Look for key words\*\*— what is the question REALLY asking? The answer should address it

\* If a question asks what is the FIRST thing you would do or what would you PRIORITIZE… I will think “okay, that means all of the answer choices could be true.” Instead of trying to figure out what’s right or wrong, assume they all are correct. Then say, “if I could only do ONE thing, what would I do first / which is the MOST important?” (Also, there is usually a difference between the FIRST and BEST action)

\* \*\*Look for absolute words\*\* (always, never, only, etc)… that could mean that answer choice is incorrect

\* \*\*When in distress, do not assess!\*\* If the patient is in severe life or death distress, you probably aren’t going to evaluate something— you are likely first going to take an action to help them

\* \*\*If you don’t know, use process of elimination!\*\* If the question has a random disease or disorder you don’t recognize, look at the answer choices and try to see if you know any of those and then eliminate them if it’s something else!

\* When evaluating answer choices… \*\*if you could only do ONE thing, which one would you do?\*\* NCLEX tends to like the most SAFE and LEAST INVASIVE possibility that will fix the problem

\* \*\*Don't choose the answer choice you don't know over the one that you do know!\*\* Dr Sharon says this all the time. If you're going through the answer choices and you see one that you think is right, and then you see an answer choice that you've never heard of and don't know if it's right or wrong... DON'T CHOOSE THE ONE YOU'RE UNSURE OF!

\* \*\*Compare two answer choices at a time!!!\*\* This was one of the most helpful strategies for me!! Especially for questions that ask for the “best” nursing action. Think to yourself \*\*\*“If I do A but not B… would that be better than if I did B but not A?”\*\*\*

\* \*\*Prioritization strategies to remember:\*\*

   \* Unexpected vs Expected

   \* Early vs Late

   \* Acute vs Chronic

   \* Objective vs Subjective

   \* Physiological vs Psychosocial

\*\*\*✨Studying advice:\*\*\*

\* While studying, \*\*take it seriously like you would on test day!\*\* If you get a question you don’t know, you might want to just guess because it’s just a practice Q… but would you just guess on the exam? Probably not! You would likely take it more seriously because it’s the exam! Pretend like your studying is the exam. If you don’t know a question, rack your brain or try to use critical thinking to narrow it down. It might work or it might not. But you practice your critical thinking! And if you get it wrong, you can evaluate your thinking / learn the content and then apply it next time you come across an unknown question

\* \*\*Limit distractions.\*\* Put your phone AWAY! Practice answering questions with focus. I would put my phone in a drawer, and it actually helped so much with focusing.

\* \*\*Act like your practice test is the exam.\*\* Simulate it! Take it at the time your exam is scheduled for. Don’t go on your phone between questions. Don’t sip on coffee or water during your practice test (you can’t bring food or drink into the actual test room). Only get up for a bathroom break or a water/snack break if you need it. 

\* If there’s a day you’re feeling particularly anxious (especially as your exam date approaches), try to \*\*study while trying to manage your anxiety\*\* (think of it as practice for test day!)

\* \*\*Study areas that you know you’re weak in!\*\* Bootcamp gives you percentages in each category which can help identify your weak spots. And you should watch Dr Sharon vids in those categories too!

\* \*\*STUDY FUNDAMENTALS!!!!!!!!!!\*\*

\* \*\*STUDY PRIORITIZATION & DELEGATION!!!!!!!!!!\*\*

\*\*\*✨When going to take the exam…\*\*\*

\* \*\*Mentally prepare\*\*

   \* Tell yourself, “I know I’m going to feel anxious. I know I might see things I’ve never heard of” etc …don’t freak out about! Just make sure to breatheee and go slow and \*\*think clearly\*\*

\* \*\*Reread the question!!\*\* So many times if I got a practice Q wrong, I’d read the question over and realize I misread the question!

\* If you don’t know the answer right away, SIT AND THINK! \*\*Don’t just guess and move on immediately.\*\* At the very least, try to narrow it down or rack your brain

\* \*\*Expect 150 questions.\*\* I don’t care how smart you are. I went into my first attempt feeling so confident and assumed I would get 85 questions since so many of my peers did and I had good scores blah blah blah. HUMBLED!!! When I got to 86, I didn’t panic— but it certainly didn’t boost my confidence. Just get over your pride and expect 150 Qs and be pleasantly surprised if you pass in anything less

\* \*\*Don’t select SATA questions based on vibes\*\* lol. I would always make that mistake and over-click answers because “I feel like it sounds right.” I’d rather under-click correct choices and get partial credit than over-click and accidentally click something wrong. There were a couple times I only selected one answer choice on SATA of my passing exam

\* \*\*Use the whiteboard!\*\* I didn’t use it on my first attempt but it really helped me straighten out my thoughts on my second attempt!!

\* \*\*Pray!!!!! Pray, pray, pray!\*\*

\*\*\*✨The last thing I will say:\*\*\*

\* \*\*My first attempt felt SO MUCH HARDER than my second attempt.\*\* 

\* Maybe if I knew the test strategies I would’ve felt differently, but the content itself truly threw me for a loop too. I genuinely didn’t know how to target my studying for my second attempt at first because the exam felt like NOTHING I had studied for previously. And then my first Bootcamp exam when prepping for my retake said that I had no categories to improve in, so I was like what am I supposed to improve in to pass??

\* I think learning the test strategies was really helpful (expected vs unexpected, etc), but also I do think the content on my second attempt was SIGNIFICANTLY easier. I GENUINELY think it was just an easier exam. Knowing the test strategies made it even easier. But I feel like if I had my second attempt exam for my first attempt, I would’ve passed. But who knows! And who cares!

\* Regardless, I’m glad I studied hard for the second attempt because you just never know what kind of test you will get! And it allowed me to walk in confidently despite the nerves from the possibility of failing again. So, \*\*LEARN THE TEST STRATEGIES!!\*\* And \*\*use NCLEX Bootcamp\*\*!!! If I could go back, I would have rather overstudied the first go around than have to tell everyone I know that I failed, pay another $550 to retake, and spend hours and hours studying for a month and a half leading up to my second attempt (it sucked... but I'm so grateful to be done).

I pray this was helpful!! And if you’re retaking, \*\*you CAN and WILL pass!!!\*\* I know it feels never-ending, but \*\*PERSEVERE!!\*\* The Lord is your strength!

Happy to answer questions!! \*\*God bless :)\*\*

1qkyy0v,https://www.reddit.com/r/self/comments/1qkyy0v/in_response_to_those_who_oppose_the_arresting_of/,"In response to those who oppose the arresting of protestors interrupting church service in Minnesota: Dr. MLK Jr. wrote his letter from a Birmingham Jail, not a coffee shop.","There has been much moral high ground taking by the masses who vehemently disagree with the current administration's handling of ""interior border control"". I count myself as one of them, in political opposition to the use of ICE, but further a stronger objection to the illegality and immorality of ICE actions. There is a moral objection to what is going on with ICE, as a majority of people see. Last weekend protestors entered the place of worship and brought a church's service to a halt. That is a certainly an illegal act under U.S. Title 18 Code § 248.

To claim that these protestors' moral highground gives them immunity to legal action is a slap in the face of the greatest human rights activist who ever lived, Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., one of his best documents being a letter he wrote to fellow clergymen **literally from jail**. I won't pass judgement on the similarity of MLK Jr to the current situation, but it is worth noting that one of church protestors also reportedly ""offered for her to turn herself in peacefully, but the Trump administration insisted on arresting her"".

I strongly encourage you to read Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.'s ""Letter from a Birmingham Jail"" for the lengthy but eloquent explanation. However, since this is the internet, and our attention spans are that of Goldfish, I will quote the most relevant sections and relate them here:

>You express a great deal of anxiety over our willingness to break laws. This is certainly a legitimate concern. Since we so diligently urge people to obey the Supreme Court's decision of 1954 outlawing segregation in the public schools, at first glance it may seem rather paradoxical for us consciously to break laws. One may well ask: ""How can you advocate breaking some laws and obeying others?"" The answer lies in the fact that there are two types of laws: just and unjust. I would be the first to advocate obeying just laws. One has not only a legal but a moral responsibility to obey just laws. Conversely, one has a moral responsibility to disobey unjust laws. I would agree with St. Augustine that ""an unjust law is no law at all.""...

>An unjust law is a code that a numerical or power majority group compels a minority group to obey but does not make binding on itself. This is difference made legal. By the same token, a just law is a code that a majority compels a minority to follow and that it is willing to follow itself. This is sameness made legal.

Here we can apply MLK Jr.'s logic to ICE: not only is a single law unjust, but the entire strategy - from conception of detaining perfectly ordinary and law abiding community members to the tactics of violently ripping them from their homes - screams out in injustice. It follows that we shouldn't help ICE, and we should interfere. MLK Jr. Continues:

>I hope you are able to see the distinction I am trying to point out. In no sense do I advocate evading or defying the law, as would the rabid segregationist. That would lead to anarchy. One who breaks an unjust law must do so openly, lovingly, and with a willingness to accept the penalty. I submit that an individual who breaks a law that conscience tells him is unjust, and who willingly accepts the penalty of imprisonment in order to arouse the conscience of the community over its injustice, is in reality expressing the highest respect for law.

And here we have the crux of the argument that makes Martin Luther King Jr. the genius advocate and philosopher that he is. You cannot claim that your moral superiority gives you power to be above the laws, whether unjust or not. The power in civil disobedience comes from commitment to the moral principles that *you knowingly accept and invite the consequences of your actions*, and by accepting that fate you do not tarnish the image that others perceive. By accepting your fate, you take away the fuel of the other side's fire when they want to say ""these punks want to break down church doors without any consequences"". The protestors almost certainly knew they were going to be arrested, probably knew the statue of the law they were breaking, and did it anyway. We all do them, and civil rights forbearers, a disservice by tarnishing their actions by saying they're above the law. They know what they are doing. If your cause is just, *believe it enough to commit to your actions and their consequences*. These protestors did.

If you're hoping to break the law and tweet about your experience from the comfort of your apartment afterward, you need to re-evaluate your own strategy. I'm not saying do stuff to land in jail, and I have doubts that MLK Jr. would have approved of the church protest, but be conscious of what you're doing by making public comments on people who break laws being above the law. It discredits the idea that *no one is above the law*, a central theme of political life in 2026. Don't give ammunition to the administration (""These liberals are invading churches and the rest of them think they shouldn't go to jail"") by half assing your moral purpose. Protest in a way that draws attention to the matter (as many have been doing) while not breaking laws, and respect those who take further steps and have strategized a more sacrificial act of civil disobedience. The history is long, as Dr. King Jr. reminds us:

>Of course, there is nothing new about this kind of civil disobedience. It was evidenced sublimely in the refusal of Shadrach, Meshach and Abednego to obey the laws of Nebuchadnezzar, on the ground that a higher moral law was at stake. It was practiced superbly by the early Christians, who were willing to face hungry lions and the excruciating pain of chopping blocks rather than submit to certain unjust laws of the Roman Empire. To a degree, academic freedom is a reality today because Socrates practiced civil disobedience. In our own nation, the Boston Tea Party represented a massive act of civil disobedience.

Don't do these modern civil rights activists dirty, claiming they are above the law, instead tell their story ""what they saw in their own communities was so awful they went to jail to stop it"". The injustice is plain to see. You don't have to point to anything different (protestors going to jail) and take the focus off of ICE's cruelty.

I used ChatGPT to figure out what is available and it recommended [this fork](https://www.partstown.ca/eureka-coffee-grinders/ekcg2313-1800kit?srsltid=AfmBOoqi7GYhXDkCkZCPk_rmI8mz4njiZZ0zW0H-FgrVQ5dCc7CEPBoM), which I have fitted, along with a regular 58mm dosing cup.

Unfortunately I didn’t question what ChatGPT told me, and when I fitted it on the grinder I realized this is actually designed to hold a portafilter. The dosing cup I bought is too tall (73mm) to sit on the fork and catch the ground coffee. 

I was hoping someone else might have done something similar, or could offer some alternative? I’m willing to replace the fork or get a new container to catch the grounds, or even both. Ideally I would get some kind of container that has a shape on the bottom that would slot into the fork, but that's definitely a long shot. Eureka have a kit with a dosing cup and a fork to hold it, but that is $150. I am based in Canada, so ideally it would be a solution I can get here.

This guy who works in the same building as me we always cross paths randomly. He said he would get coffee last year and he finally did after  not doing it the next day like he claimed he would. During our quick coffee run we exchanged numbers and followed each other on IG. During our text exchange said he wanted to get know me and possibly do a situationship and if things progressed then he’d be fine with that too. ( I took that with a grain of salt cause I’m okay with just fucking I’m in a 2 year drought cause look at the caliber of men I am encountering LOL).

——————————————-

However the type of person I am you gonna have to put effort in regardless of what we doing. He said he wanted us to go to happy hour it never happened and he never followed up but he would text me randomly good morning and I nipped it in the bud telling him that he gonna have to do more than text me and sell dreams.  Then he unfollowed me off Instagram I never asked about it because it didn’t bother me we were (and still don’t) not talking like that.  Last few months I just stayed out of the way he wasn’t even a thought on my mind .

————————————————————

Fast forward to yesterday I stepped out to get coffee and he was walking into the building and we made eye contact but I turned my head and kept it pushing because I don’t have time for that this year. Well, idk what got into him because he ended up texting me saying he was thinking about me and asked if we could eat lunch together , and that he wanted to take me on a date. I responded to his text with my availability and went to see if he saw it or responded and noticed my message was green .

—————————————————————————

Meanwhile,lunch came he never texted me and I knew better than to think he would  but wanted to give him a chance lmao thankfully I always bring my lunch so that was okay. The day was over I went home and text him again saying “ I’d like to ask what happen but this is our norm” message still green. This the most offputting shit a man has down how you ask me on a date the block me , I hate to make theories it’s a bad habit because I be wanting stuff to make sense and it just don’t. But i wondered if he had a girl and she found out or he wanted to get revenge for me walking past him but whatever the reason he gets no acknowledgment from me ever again and I will continue to ignore him physically and he is blocked

It just makes me feel weird I don’t want to be alone forever but I keep having men approach on me on some weird shit which is why I never go out of my way to put myself out there.

* Spending my first night close to the airport after a late arrival was really great - it meant I could get into bed and then also have a late start as the hotel had an 11am check-out. This was really helpful after a 20+ hour trip. It was also super fun having the robots to check-in!
* Suica card on my iPhone made travelling around Tokyo, and Kyoto to some extent, super easy. Could also use it at Conbinis and some restuarants.
* I bought my Shinkansen tickets a couple of days before I took the train. You can buy them on the day, but I was so happy to have mine bought when heading back to Tokyo - the snow caused delays across the country, and the Osaka train station was chaos!! So many people had to wait for hours because they hadn't bought a ticket prior to that day.
* The logistics of the Kumano Kodo can be a little challenging, but it is such an exquisite part of Japan. The forests are so ancient, and it is breathtaking walking through them. If you can't do the multi-day Nakahechi walk, it is seriously worth considering the Daimonzaka and Dainichigoe. Each is only a couple of kilometres, and takes an hour or two. They do both involve serious uphill sections, though. And Yunonmine Onsen is just wonderful!
* If you're going to visit Koyasan, just stay the night!! The magic of the place is really in being there rather than just passing through.
* I loved the gachapon! And the ones in Kyoto were very different to those in Tokyo. You could get really beautiful little miniatures - I got a little matcha tea set, a 3D image of a famous painting, a little stone deer and a fat cat fishing! When I go back, I will definitely be looking for more.
* I also recommend collecting goshuin (temple/shrine stamps) as well as train and location stamps - just keep them separate. Goshuin are sacred and require their own book.
* I also bought omamori charms, and kept of record of what each was for and where it was from. I then gave these as gifts with a note on the origin, and people loved them! And of course KitKat in funky flavours!
* My best souvenirs are the ones I use every day - a kitchen knife (just from Loft), tenugui towels that I use as dish towels, and the little gacha minis that sit on my shelf.
* Definitely agree with packing light! Places like Muji and even conbinis have such awesome travel-sized toiletries, it is so worth not bringing extra weight from home.
* I thought that I had a fairly slow-paced itinerary, but I was still on my feet all day and out of my hotel from morning to night. Going back, I plan to go even slower!
* Also, there doesn't seem to be a lingering culture when it comes to coffee shops or restaurants - you sit, you eat, you go!
* And the stairs!!! So many stairs! If you want to prepare physically for a trip, forget the treadmill and get on the stairmaster!!
* And yes, a few basic phrases in Japanese do go a long way. Most people really appreciate the effort. I bought the most amazing stuffed cheese ball thing from a street vendor near Nakamise dori - it was so good, and I walked back and bought another. But the best part was seeing the vendor's face just light up when I said ""totemo oiishi desu"" (this is really delicious).

Day 1: My flight landed at Haneda at 10:30pm and I chose a hotel close to the airport for the first night. (Henn na Hotel Haneda….it’s the one with robots and dinosaurs at the check-in counter - a super cool introduction to the craziness of Japan!)

Day 2: Sent my luggage to my Shibuya hotel using Airporter (super convenient - could pre-book and pay online). Then made my way to Shibuya via Zojoji temple and Tokyo Tower. (Tokyo Tower was great to get a sense of the vastness of the city….it literally stretches as far as the eye can see. Zojoji temple has the Garden for Unborn Children - this is an incredibly beautiful and moving sacred space).

Day 3: Walked from Shibuya, up through Meiji Park and Shrine, to Shinjuku. Explored a bit and then walked back via various shops and department stores.

Day 4: Morning Shinkansen to Kyoto. Went straight to Arashiyama from Kyoto Station and stored luggage in locker at the station. Took a taxi to Otagi Nenbutsugi and then walked back down to Arashiyama Main Street via Adashino Nenbutsuji (the one with the secret bamboo grove!) and Toriimoto Preserved Street.

Day 5: Walked to Kiyomizudera early - it started to snow which was magical! Also did a Kimono experience and Tea Ceremony through Ju-An at Kotokuji Temple - highly recommend. Finished the day with a walk through Nishiki Market.

Day 6: Spent the whole morning at Fushimi Inari, climbing the mountain through the back pathway and bamboo forest, and then walking down through the main Torii gates. Really enjoyed this approach and saw so many extraordinary shrine spaces on the way up.

Day 7: Attended the Setsubun festival at Yasaka Shrine where they have a special performance by local maiko. This was an amazing experience to be a part of!

Day 8: Sent my main luggage back to Tokyo - the guesthouse helped with this - and kept a small backpack for 4 nights. Took an early train to Shingu (about 4hrs) on the Kii peninsula. Visited the Hayatama Taisha, one of the three shrines that make up the Kumano Sanzen.

Day 9: Train to Nachi and walked the Daimonzaka section of the Kumano Kodo to the Nachi Taisha Shrine (the one with the pagoda and the waterfall in the background). Then back to Shingu and onto a bus to Yunomine Onsen. (Arrived to falling snow and steam rising from the river!)

Day 10: Walked the Dainichigoe section of the Kumano Kodo to Hongu, and the last of the Kumano Sanzen shrines. Bus back to Yunomine Onsen.

Day 11: This was the most logistically challenging day of my trip. I had to take a bus from Yunomine to Tanabe, and then three trains, a cable car and a bus to Koyasan. Arrived in the early afternoon and checked in for my temple stay at Saizenin Temple.

Day 12: Experienced the early morning prayers at the temple - the singing is otherworldly. Spent the day exploring Okunoin cemetery - the whole area was covered in snow and it was sublime. Took an afternoon train to Osaka. Got a hotel in Namba close to the Shinkansen station, and just explored Dotonbori for the evening.

Day 13: Shinkansen back to Tokyo (delays due to heavy snowfall along the route). Stayed with friends. Went to izakaya and karaoke!

Day 14: Explored Kichikoji with friends

Day 15: Explored Ameyokocho shopping area and then Yanaka and Nezu. Stayed in a capsule hotel (just for the experience!) in Asakusa.

Day 16: Visited Sensoji and Nakamise shopping street as well as Kappabashi before meeting friends in Ginza.

Day 17: Packing and final bits of shopping before heading to the airport for an 11pm flight.

1qkywen,https://i.redd.it/nwo01tuw75fg1.jpeg,Hello? (Part 2.),"Chapter 3: The Journey to the Cabin.

I set out on my hike to the cabin. The pull along cart I was given, well. it wasn’t the best, but it worked. It had an awkward handle to hold on to, that made a little difficult to pull. but thankfully it had big wheels and handled the weight of a year’s worth of supplies without much issue. But could be better. The trail was mostly flat and smooth, nothing too challenging yet. Thankfully.

From the station to the cabin, I had about a five hour hike ahead, giving me a chance to preview the area I’d patrol.

A nice introduction to everything.

I passed a few small creeks Rich had mentioned, stopping to note some landmarks like some distinctive rocks and trees, the water flow, and small animals going about their day. Nothing unusual for the woods.

After about two and a half hours in, I needed to take a break, the cart's weight was starting to wear down on my legs, a hard reminder of my last two years glued behind a desk. I stopped and pulled out a snack and a thermos of water from my backpack. I sat down on a rock next to the creek and enjoyed the views while eating a candy bar. Taking in the sights and sounds of nature, as I'm writing down more notes and eating. I suddenly noticed something odd.

All the normal woodland noises, wind rustling leaves, birds chirping, animals scurrying, all started to fade ever so gradually, until it was eerily quiet.

No birds, no critters, not even the creek beside me.

And then, very faintly, something whispered through the air, growing closer until it was right by my ear, a gentle “Hello?”

My heart skipped. I froze, the candy bar halfway to my mouth. “I’m hearing things. No way that was real."" I thought. But the voice had been so clear, very soft, an almost curious voice. like it was testing me. I glanced around, I saw nothing, but trees and the trail, not a soul in sight.

My mind raced. Why would something out here say “Hello”? I remembered the woman I spoke with on the phone, Jonah’s offhand mention at the gate, Josh’s vague warning, and Rich’s intense stare when he drilled the rule into me.

They all acted like saying “Hello” was life or death, but no one explained why. Was it some local superstition? A park tradition? Or something else entirely, something tied to this unnatural silence?

I swallowed hard, feeling exposed. I hadn’t said “Hello” when I stopped here, and now the woods felt… watchful. “Okay, fine,” I muttered to myself, following their instructions. “Hello? Sorry I didn’t say that earlier. I'm new around here.”

As subtly as the silence had crept in, the sounds returned: wind, water, birds, squirrels. All normal again. I exhaled, tension easing, but questions gnawed at me. What was that voice? Why did saying “Hello” seem to reset the world around me? It wasn’t just politeness, there was weight to it, like a key to something I didn’t understand.

I made a mental note to press Josh or Rich later, though their cagey responses so far didn’t promise answers.

“Okay, I have to remember to say ‘Hello’ anytime I enter a new area,” I told myself. “Apparently, something out here needs to hear it.” But what? And why did it feel like the woods were listening, waiting for me to slip up?

I finished my candy bar, packed up my trash, checked my map and compass, and continued for the remaining two and a half hours.

After what felt like forever, I finally reached the cabin just before nightfall, with the sun low enough to cast a golden glow on a small, picturesque log cabin, like a postcard scene.

Trees formed a canopy overhead, a clean walkway led to the door, birds and animals bustled, wind and water whispered sweetly. It was simply perfect.

I pulled the cart to the front door, then I start to search for a lockbox Rich mentioned, around back, hanging under a foundation leg i. I went around back and retrieved the key where Rich said it was. Then I returned to the front door and as I go to unlock the door, it happens again.

The silence crept in slow.

birds stopped, animals hushed, the woods goes quiet, and I start to hear the same sound when the voice went by my ear. My stomach twisted. Not again. Was this going to happen every time I forgot their damn rule? Was there something out here enforcing this ritual, waiting for me to acknowledge it? I didn’t know if I was being paranoid or if the woods were playing tricks, but I wasn’t about to test it.

“Hello out there!” I called, louder than necessary, my voice echoing slightly.

The sounds returned, just like before. I stood there, key in hand, staring into the darkening forest.

“Why does this keep happening?” I muttered. “What’s causing it? And why the hell does something out here say ‘Hello’ first?”

I wanted to chalk it up to exhaustion or my imagination, but the voice on the trail felt too real, too deliberate. It wasn’t human, not quite, but it wasn’t an animal either. It felt… expectant. Like it was part of some unspoken pact I’d stumbled into. I shook my head. “Only time will tell, I guess.”

I opened the door, dust billowed in the fading sunlight, visible through the windows. Clearly, no one had been here in a while. I stepped in and said, “Hello, I’m new here! I’ll be staying for a while, hope that’s okay?” My voice sounded small in the empty cabin, but I wasn’t taking chances after the trail. If saying 'Hello' kept the silence at bay, I’d do it, even if I didn’t understand why. Maybe it was just a quirk of the job, but the way Rich’s eyes had bored into me when he said it made me think there was more to it, something he wasn’t telling me.

Nothing responded, so maybe the “Hello” I said outside sufficed. I began unloading the cart, brought everything inside, and got settled in. I checked the computer, tried to figure out the old oven (knobs worn, hard to read temp and timer), I inspected the bathroom (shower with running water, but toilet was an outhouse-style seat over a deep hole, no strong smell, given the vacancy). After unpacking into drawers and the closet, it was dark out. I radioed Rich and logged today’s findings.

“This is Cabin 12 to Outpost Chance. Anyone copy?”

After a moment, Josh replied. “This is Ranger Josh with Outpost Chance. You make it to 12 alright? Over.”

“Yes safe and sound, I just finished getting settled in. Over.”

“Good. Glad you’re safe. What do you think of it, Alex? Over.”

“So far, so good. Gorgeous views, plenty to explore. The Cabin’s a little more Rustic than your dad let on, but it’s home now. I’ll make the best of it. Over.”

“Yeah, it's a bit run-down, and could use some updates. But it’s a roof and a bed. So make it home. How was the walk? Over.”

Rich said report anything, but not to discuss the 'Hello' rule. How do I explain the silence and faint voice? I needed answers. “On my way, I stopped halfway for a break—”

Josh cut in before I could finish, “Did you make sure to, well, you know? Over.""

Knowing he understood, I pushed for clarity. “Not at first. I sat down to rest, ate a little bit and suddenly everything went dead quiet. Then I swore I heard a faint ‘Hello’ go by my ear. I said it back, and everything went back  to normal. The same happened when I reached the cabin, but I remembered in time. Josh, what’s the deal? Why does something out here say ‘Hello’ and need to be told it back? What am I dealing with? Over.""

He let out a sigh, his voice sharp with urgency. “Make sure, I mean 100% sure, you say it! Every time you enter your zone. No matter what. Just do it and trust me, okay? Over.”

I didn’t fully trust him, not when no one would explain, but what choice did I have? “Okay, I trust you. I’ll keep it up. But besides that, the walk was uneventful. Copy that? Over.”

“copy, have you filled out your report yet? And is everything working? Power, water, fridge, oven? Or does anything need repairs? Over.”

“All good. The Oven’s a bit tricky cause the knobs are a bit messed up. but I'll make it work. And I'll have my report soon, before bed. How Copy? Over.”

“Copy. And Drop the extra radio lingo, no need. But good to hear. Make sure to radio in if you need anything. Oh, also get up sometime tonight for a quick peek outside. The Fire crossed our line unexpectedly. Over.”

“Can do. An Alarm is set for three hours from now. I’ll radio in if it’s important. Over.”

“Sounds good. I’m signing off. Sleep well, stay safe. Josh out.”

“Night, Josh. Alex out.”

I turned off the radio, grabbed a snack, and  sat down at the computer to log my report, omitting the silence and voice, but including notes and observations. Submitted it to the board's and Rich’s email.

Now With that done, I checked out the games on here. There was three. Tetris, Spider Solitaire and Texas Hold ’em. Better than absolutely nothing, I guess.

I started to play the poker game, turned on some music from my phone. And got lost playing for awhile. Then after some time. Without warning, silence fell. Absolute quiet, no music, no outside sounds, not even my own breath. fear hit, as I did begin to hear... multiple loud knocks at the door… Followed by a deep, gentle… “Hello?”

End of Chapter 3.

Chapter 4: The Knocking.

Loud, continuous knocking shook the door, followed by a deep, gentle “Hello?”

“What the fuck?” I thought, heart pounding.

Rich had said no one was allowed in zone this time of the year. And especially with the fire going on near by. staff only he said.

But possibly a lost hiker, maybe? Or even one of the guys messing with me?  I didn’t know, but the knocking grew louder, harder, insistent.

I stood frozen, glancing at the machete by the desk. Better be safe than sorry. I slowly get up to grab it, then tucking it behind me to avoid scaring a potential hiker, and I then crept to the door. Just in case, I called out, “Hello?”

The knocking stopped. Dead silence.

I gripped the knob, turned it slowly, and pulled the door open. Nothing. Not a soul, not even a footprint in the dirt.

The woods stared back at me, still, like they were holding their breath. I ran back inside and grabbed a flashlight from the desk and back outside to check around. I circled the cabin, staying close to its walls. Crickets chirped, owls hooted in the distance, all was peaceful, normal. But something felt wrong, like the silence was waiting to return.

“What the actual hell was that?” I muttered to myself. I headed back inside. I locked the door, checked every window and made sure they were all locked. and shut off the lights. It was nearly 1:30 a.m. I’d done my nightly check outside, as Josh had asked basically. and everything seemed fine except for the visitor there.

I was exhausted and needed to sleep. So I went to get ready for bed. I brushed my teeth, washed my face, grateful for the heated water. As I was leaving the bathroom. The toilet caught my eye as I passed. It was too deep, not like a normal outhouse style toilet. too dark, not dark in the it's just black down there. I mean dark like a bad presence was down there. like it led somewhere beyond dirt. I shivered, avoiding it.

I got changed into my sleep clothes. I then got into my sleeping bag, the bed seemed comfy but well worn, its sheets being clean are questionable though. The cabin was pretty chilly, so the sleeping bag a smart choice on all accounts. I zipped myself in tight. got comfortable, and passed out quicker than I thought. the woods now peaceful and sweet sounds lulling me to sleep. A good night, despite everything.

The next morning I woke up around 8:30 a.m. and surprisingly slept fairly well. I unzip my sleeping bag, the cold air biting me. Getting out of my sleeping bag took serious effort, who likes waking up freezing?

I got started on my morning routine. Get the coffee going, brush my teeth, put on clean clothes, have my coffee, and be ready for the day and my new life ahead.

(Several months pass)

Time had flew by out there.

When I arrived, it was starting to get chilly, leaves just starting falling. And now, a blanket of snow draped over everything, turning my zone into a breathtaking winter wonderland. The beauty of these woods never ceased, but I couldn’t shake the memory of that first night’s visitor or the way the silence felt alive, just waiting.

I spent my days out patrolling, mapping out important landmarks, the creeks near by, all the trees and what one's may fall at any time. I noted all the animal patterns. a massive buck with an impressive rack leading a herd deer, the squirrels scurrying about and playing. I saw a colorful duck flying overhead one day, with a unique neck band. Never seen one like it before.

I snapped a cute photo of two chipmunks sitting on a snow dusted log, snowflakes falling gently past them.

My reports to Rich and headquarters were detailed, sent via the cabin’s ancient computer. I was beginning to get pretty damn good at Texas Hold ’Em in my downtime, I started one of my puzzles and I'm almost done with one of my books. the oven’s worn knobs still baffled me, not sure what the temp actually is or anything like that, I've just been cooking by turning it on and wait for it to warm up, and then cook by guesswork and pull it out before it gets to burnt.

No more silence or ghostly visitors since that first night. I said “Hello” every time I stepped outside, entered a new area, or returned to the cabin. It was second nature now, a ritual to keep whatever called these woods home at bay.

Things felt and were normal...for a while.

Then one morning, I woke up late, around 10 a.m. Something was wrong.

Silence. Absolute, suffocating silence.

No animals outside, no wind rushing by, nothing at all.

“Maybe I’m still half asleep,” I told myself, heading to the bathroom. I peed, couldn’t hear myself go. I brushed my teeth, washed my face. no sound of water, no clink of the sink. It was like the woods had swallowed sound itself, just like that first night.

Had I forgotten to say “Hello” at some point yesterday and it's just now going silent? I didn’t think so, but I wasn’t taking chances. “Hello!” I called, waiting for the woods’ sounds to return, like before.

Nothing. No noise came back like the times before, just absolute deafening silence.

I couldn’t even hear my own voice, haven't had that happen before.

Panic crept in. I threw on a pair pants, a tee shirt, and some slippers I brought, stepped outside, and yelled, “Hello!” Still nothing. Just silence.

“Oh shit, this can’t be good.” I hurried back inside, went to the computer, and emailed the station.

""Rich, Josh, you two there? I just woke up and I can’t hear anything. What’s going on?”

A few minutes later, Jonah replied.

""Alex, it’s Jonah. Rich and Josh are out meeting with the neighboring rangers about some downed trees blocking the road coming in to the park. I’m watching the station while they're gone. Have you been making sure you're saying ""Hello""?""

“Yes, every damn time I move or breathe! I’ve been religious about it. Are you saying it?” I typed, frustrated.

He replied “I've been here for Four years and have never slipped up once. But the station’s safe space, The fence keeps it out. So I can hear just fine. Are you sure you’ve been saying it?”

“YES, I SWEAR! But If I'm making sure to say it out here. Then why is this happening?”

Jonah took a while to respond.

""Well, a year ago, during the off season. A homeless man wandered into the park, no one knew he was here, until the Silence hit.  we only knew what was happening cause Rich went to check the gate due to a brunch falling on it and noticed, after an hour of searching we came up with nothing. the Police were called and a massive search began. After a few days they found him. he couldn’t speak, just stared blankly. The police took him and after 3 days, the silence lifted. We never learned why it did""

My stomach dropped.

""So, then someone is probably out here? Like a hiker or something? And why didn't he speak?""

Jonah replied. “No clue, he couldn't even write or do anything at all. It's like he was in shock. But If there's someone new in the zone, it stirs things up and it won't stop until they are found and told to say 'Hello'.""

“Alright so should I head to the station to meet with you and then we both go search together?”

“No, I can’t leave. Rich’s orders: someone stays for radio and messages. Start at your cabin, search east heading toward the station and I'll be waiting for you.""

Great. I had to find a lost person in this silent hell, alone, without hearing. Whatever was out here didn’t just want ‘Hello’ it needed it, and someone’s silence was breaking everything.

""Okay, I'll pack a few things and start east. What’s the safe code? I'm not going out there without the Shotgun.""

""We're not allowed to give it out to anyone in the cabin unless it’s an absolute emergency.”

“THIS IS AN ABSOLUTE FUCKING EMERGENCY JONAH! GIVE ME THE DAMN CODE!”

“Okay fine. 2709. there's Shells inside a bag inside. Be safe, bring your radio in case you find someone. If you’re not here by nightfall, I will come out looking.”

“I’ll do my best, hopefully I'll hear from you soon"" I replied.

I threw on my cold weather gear, packed some food, water, an extra jacket, flashlight, batteries, and the radio. I opened the safe, loaded the 12 gauge, slung the ammo bag over my shoulder, grabbed my map, and headed east.

As I went out into the woods, the silence felt heavier, like it was watching me. I had 10 miles to cover before dark, hoping to find whoever was causing this and stop it, for their safety and all of ours.

Five miles in, around 2 p.m., I made good time despite the silence. Dark clouds rolled in, and snow fell hard, blanketing the trail. I neared a pond I’d marked, expecting it frozen, empty of all animals and life right now.

I was wrong.

The massive buck I’d noted was thrashing in the pond, breaking ice, covered in blood. Along the bank, laying all Around it, the bodies of his herd lay scattered, torn apart. The silence wasn’t just quiet it was driving the woods to slaughter.

“What the hell is going on?” I thought, frozen, watching the buck’s frenzied destruction.

It then suddenly stopped, it turned towards me, it saw me, and then charged at me.

1qkyw2z,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1qkyw2z,FoCo Dive Bar Challenge - FINALS - Trailhead vs Town Pump,"This is it, the finals!! The moment we have been building towards for months. It's like Dive Bar Christmas. The Olympics of the over-served. Like the moon landing, except this actually happened (JK, I believe in NASA). 

  
We have spent months visiting the [Reddit-nominated](https://www.reddit.com/r/FortCollins/comments/1lt93ml/foco_dive_bar_bracket_bonanza/) dive bars on our list, eliminating one location each night. Check out any of the previous blogs to see how this contest has worked all along. But we don't have time for rules today. Today is a day for crowning champions!  


So, let's get to our ultimate winner and Fort Collins reigning Dive Bar Champion. To decide on the champion of the finals, we changed things up. No more 11 sections of criteria and numerical scores. We simply invited all our previous judges, as well as calling up some practice squad friends for their first experience. Then we enacted democracy! One person, one vote. We visited both locations on one night for a fantastic time. *Shout out to Surfside as well, for hosting our after-party.*

Let's get to the results:

* Trailhead: 5 votes
* Town Pump: 4 votes
* Surfside??: 2 votes

This is a problem. Surfside was not on the ballot and these write-in votes were unexpected. Well, Fort Collins is a ranked choice voting city. With 11 votes cast, no single candidate got 50% of the votes. Therefore, we need to eliminate the lowest candidate and reallocate those votes. Going with people's second choice:

* Trailhead: 5 votes
* Town Pump: 6 votes

That left **Town Pump** as our Dive Bar Bracket Challenge winner!! A big congratulations to Fort Collins oldest bar for still being the champ to this day.

We had an absolute blast on this journey. Thank you Reddit for your support along the way as we followed our dreams of silly and unnecessary bracket competitions for fun. We loved the support. We loved the insults. We loved the random people recognizing us in the streets from this. This is an amazing city and I am so happy to call this place my home. 

Stay tuned for us visiting Old Town Coffee Shops. This one likely won't be a competition, more just happy reviews of all the great shops.

She was with her boyfriend, I didn't pay much attention to her. All I remember is that she was wearing a bright yellow top.

Halloween party this year, I went to the same friend's house party. She was there. My friends hinted that she was recently out of her previous 4-year relationship. I went up to talk to her. We were both incredibly drunk and she offered shots. We talked about our love for food, and I saw curiosity in her eyes. She invited my to her house party the next day, she hugged me goodbye when I left.

I showed up to her party, she gave me a big hug. Tension rose at the party. I needed to kiss her, she took me upstairs, and I felt her lips and body for the first time. It was incredible.

We started going on dates. Things are starting to go where I am comfortable. She created distance and told me she was not looking for a relationship. I said I was fine with that.

More dates. She revealed that between her breakup and meeting me, she was dating another mutual friend of ours. He wanted to be in a relationship, and she broke it off because she didn't know what she wanted.

I retreat. I started calculating the weight of my gestures. Still, I cooked for her, gifted her books, and took care of her when sick. It felt natural.

She took me to a teahouse to listen to jazz. The silence between us and the shared attention to the music felt warm and comforting. I fell in love.

More dates. I told her I was falling in love with her. She said that made her feel better about us. I knew she was not going to say it back, but it felt good to release the weight. I had never been the one to say it first, and she told me she was always the one to say it first. She kissed me harder, but I didn't feel the distance shorten.

I took her to a coffeeshop. She said her parents would love the pour over here. I said you should show them this place. She said I should show them instead. I brushed it off. She hates coffee.

I love to be physically close to the person I like. She said physical touch is at the bottom of her list of love languages. She rarely initiates touch with her hands. However, she'd often sneak in a kiss while we're walking or waiting in line at a busy supermarket. She said her love language is acts of service, like cooking for people. I have done most of the initiating, she brought me leftover curry she made once.

She is surrounded by love from her friends. Her phone is constantly lit up by texts from group chats. I feel lucky to have her attention, but not lucky enough to have all of it. I'm afraid my loneliness would scare her off.

I think about her all the time. I think about the confusion she brings me. I think about my insecurities when she talks about her busy plans with friends. I think about how her presence resolves the tension in a second.

I know I love her. I know she likes me a lot. I don't know if I should love her.

First one was when I first took it about 2 months ago – I took it (50mg) with my morning coffee and a prescribed antibiotic for a sinus infection, and had horrible anxiety where I was convinced something was wrong. My heart was pounding, my hands were sweating, my face was tingly, and so on.

At the time I spoke with a doctor that told me to hold off on it for a bit while I finished taking my antibiotics. I don't remember whether or not I mentioned having coffee that morning, but either way, not the psychiatrist who prescribed it to me or this doctor told me to avoid caffeine.

Then a couple of days ago I forgot to take desvenlafaxine for a couple of days, but took it on Wednesday morning. Then, at 5pm or so, I had a coffee with my mom and she didn't finish hers so I drank hers too before going to the gym. At the gym, I couldn't do much at all. I felt a kind of ""low blood pressure weakness"", where I wasn't dizzy or faint but something felt off. I felt breathless and anxious, my chest hurt a bit, and did pretty light exercises because of it. Then after the gym, my chest hurt a tiny bit, on and off, for the rest of the night. I've felt a little bit off ever since but much better.

I've just read desvenlafaxine and caffeine together may be dangerous and cause seratonin syndrome, but this information wasn't given to me at all.

Am I okay with the symptoms I just gave? I'll stop with the coffee for sure for now on, but I'm worried for my health now.",1,1769193198.0,AskDocs,1,1.0,False

however, as of lately i've been taking notice of some of her habits and feeling extremely irritated by them. i can't tell if i'm overreacting or if i'm just snobbish.

susy is a work from home worker so she's in the apartment all day while i work a 9-5 outside of the apartment. i've noticed that, especially recently, whenever i come home the living room is always a mess. opened snacks on the coffee table, tv is on, but she isn't in the room. sometimes there's empty dishes or the blankets are never folded and put back. i don't care what she does with her spaces, but i don't think i like our common spaces being left dirty. though, i will admit, that's not something that we've ever communicated.

she also always has friends over, usually without a heads up and usually at really weird hours of the night. a lot of her friends are also male and as a woman, while they aren't loud, it makes me uncomfortable trying to sleep at 1 oclock in the morning knowing there's some strange dude in the other room or wandering our kitchen.

i think it bothers me so much because she's hypercritical about everything. she comments on how i load the dishwasher, she always asks me not to make certain foods because they smell weird (i'm asian). she's even critique'd me on the type of shows i watch as if that's any of her business. so, maybe my annoyance is coming from a year of feeling like my every move is being judged. i'm not sure.

am i overreacting? is this something i should bring up with her or just thug it out until our lease is up and leave? thanks!",2,1769193034.0,AmIOverreacting,14,0.67,False

On Christmas Eve, eight months pregnant, I waited at home for my husband Wilfred Gallagher to return, my heart filled with anticipation. 

But he burst through the front door in a panic, cradling his childhood sweetheart. 

When I stepped forward to help, he shoved me hard to the ground. 

My belly hit the edge of the coffee table. Pain instantly shot through me, cold sweat slicking my skin, but Wilfred didn’t even spare me a glance. 

“Out of my way! Someone drugged Annie at the bar. If I don’t help her, she’ll die!” 

Clutching my belly, I grabbed my phone. “I’ll call 911 for you…..” 

Before I could finish, he ripped the phone from my hand and smashed it to pieces; then wrapped his fingers around my throat. 

“Are you trying to ruin her reputation? If word gets out, how is she supposed to live with it?” 

To prevent me from “causing trouble,” he ignored my desperate pleas and locked me out on the balcony, leaving me there in a thin nightgown. 

“Stay out there and cool your head. Don’t come back in until you’ve learned how to behave!” 

I pounded the glass door in despair, tears streaming down my face. 

Helpless, I watched as they carried out their shameless acts on the living room carpet, Christmas carols playing cheerfully in the background.

Furious, he cursed aloud, “Delicia Kearney! Where the hell did you go? Annie’s stomach hurts. Get your ass in here and make her some soup!”

He strode up to the balcony door.

Wilfred’s eyes traced the rope downward, stopping at the delivery guy’s footprints in the snow. 

“Well down, Delicia. Quite the acrobat, huh? 

“Even pregnant, you still managed to climb down two floors on a rope. Guess that belly pain yesterday was all an act, too!”

It clawed at the glass frantically, nails screeching against it. 

It caught my scent, knowing I was out there. 

Annoyed by the noise, Wilfred lifted his foot and kicked Daily hard in the stomach. 

“Shut up! Stupid dog!” 

“Awoo!” Daily whimpered, tumbling across the floor from the kick, but still tried to crawl back to the balcony 

“Wilfred, stop!” I cried hysterically, lunging forward to shield Daily. “How can you be so cruel?” 

A memory came rushing back. 

Three years ago, I was depressed after a miscarriage. I couldn’t sleep at night and constantly thought about ending my life. 

One day, Wilfred returned home with fluffy little golden retriever and gently placed it in my arms.

I did search and read different reviews but I just can't decide...

I'm leaning more towards the K2 as some reviewers say that the K2 produces more balanced flavor as the K6 leans to make it taste more acidic, but other people flat out recommend the K6 as it is more adjustable which I guess makes it more versatile.

Help pls","My symptoms dramatically improved same day, the day I switched to black tea.

Labs were fine, h pylori negative, abdominal ultrasound fine…

It’s been about a month and a half since the switch. Today I’ve had 2 cups of black tea, maybe 1/2c of Greek non fat yogurt, 1 bowl of plain grits, maybe 1c of broccoli from the air fryer. That’s it. Food, oddly, isn’t what makes me feel full. Its water. I used to slam a whole bottle of water no problem, now if I have 4oz I feel like I’m going to explode.

Nothing is burning, haven’t really had reflux since I dropped my coffee. I was doing better, and now I’m not. Nothing really hurts anymore. This started 5 months ago with gnawing hunger pangs even if I just ate, then a few days later came the acid reflux that made coffee taste like chemicals and burned my throat. Then I couldn’t swallow as well and chased my bites with sips of water (improved significantly weeks after I stopped drinking coffee). After I ate it felt like food just sat there at my solar plexus for like 45 mins, it was so uncomfortable. I would regurgitate water if I bent over. Sharp stabbing pains that would last a second at a time and came and went but was weird.

Regurgitation now is very minimal and rare. All of my main symptoms have resolved. No pain. But right now, just after a bit of broccoli and idk half of a bottle-ish of water, I feel like a balloon and it’s uncomfortable and like it wants to come up. Not in a nauseous way but like. Idk how to explain it. But also, now I do get nauseous if I eat anything remotely acidic or spicy. If I try to burp, it feels like the broccoli is going to come up? This all seems to have started overnight. One night I was fine, the next day it started & never stopped. 5 months. 5 freaking months.

What the heck is going on? I had an endoscopy scheduled but we cancelled it since my symptoms resolved so quickly. Honestly at this point I’m terrified I’ve given myself stomach/esophageal.. at 28 because I drank so many white claws over the last 7 years. Idk.

Is this normal?! I struggle with anxiety, and I have a 2.5 year old daughter, I get very disconnected from my reality when I spiral on this because all I can think about is her not having a mom.

I have two (ish) questions! 

1. Is anyone interested in creating/joining a writing/reading club? 

1.5: Are you guys familiar with Reedsy contests/prompts? 

1.75: Would anyone be interested in a writing group that follows Reedsy prompts?

I would really love to meet folks doing writing, or wanting to talk about what they're reading. I'd want to make the group have a main focus on writing. However, it's been said by some of the greatest writers that one must be a good reader if one wants to be a good writer. That's why I'd like it to look like this: WRITING/reading group. I don't care wh a t your style is. Silly, satire, serious, mystery, romance, the great American novel (lol) poetry, short story. I work better in a group, and even better in a diverse group: age, backround, culture, LGBTQ+, Race, ethnicity, political beliefs.... I am not interested in working with bigots, people unwilling to be honest and challenge themselves. Finally, I'd like to find a group of folks who are able to laugh, joke, and enjoy themselves, even if whatever you're working on is serious. Did I say ""age""? hahaha I'm 54, and want to work with all ages. so if you're 19, or 85, or in between, bring it darling! let's teach, learn, laugh, drink coffee, break bread!!!

Finally:

2. What do Vancouver residents call ourselves? IE New York residents are New Yorkers....are we Vancouverers? Vancouverites? Couvies? 

oh... one more thing:

2.25: This weather! AMIRIGHT!!!  I suffer hard with winter depression. This sun is so great for me. However, not so much if you ski. I suppose not so much for the environment, either. I love PNW but always consider moving somewhere with more sun. This winter is doing right by me, and I'm sorry, 😆

1qkyrcx,https://www.reddit.com/r/Pristiq/comments/1qkyrcx/worried_about_symptoms_of_desvenlafaxine/,Worried about symptoms of desvenlafaxine,"So, I've had two episodes where I had a hard time with desvenlafaxine. First one was when I first took it – I took it (50mg) with my morning coffee and a prescribed antibiotic for a sinus infection, and had horrible anxiety where I was convinced something was wrong. My heart was pounding, my hands were sweating, my face was tingly, and so on.

At the time I spoke with a doctor that told me to hold off on it for a bit while I finished taking my antibiotics. I don't remember whether or not I mentioned having coffee that morning, but either way, not the psychiatrist who prescribed it to me or this doctor told me to avoid caffeine.

Then a couple of days ago I forgot to take desvenlafaxine for a couple of days, but took it on Wednesday morning. Then, at 5pm or so, I had a coffee with my mom and she didn't finish hers so I drank it before going to the gym. At the gym, I couldn't do much at all. I felt a kind of ""low blood pressure weakness"", where I wasn't dizzy or faint but something felt off. I felt breathless and anxious and whatnot, and did pretty light exercises because of it. Then after the gym, my chest hurt a tiny bit, on and off, for the rest of the night. I've felt a little bit off ever since but much better anyway.

I've just read desvenlafaxine and caffeine can be dangerous and cause seratonin syndrome, but this information wasn't given to me at all. Am I okay with the symptoms I just gave?

I'll stop with the coffee for sure for now on, but I'm worried for my health now.",2,1769192955.0,Pristiq,1,1.0,False

1qkyq5z,https://www.reddit.com/r/lonely/comments/1qkyq5z/i_cannot_handle_the_grief_of_my_friend_leaving/,I cannot handle the grief of my friend leaving for Germany..,"Today my best friend from school returned to Germany at midnight, after visiting my city for 6 months. Coping with this is so painful. The sense of loneliness and isolation this causes to me is so damn painful, and this hits me like a truck. She is the only person who wanted to hang out with me at the cinema, at the park and the mall. She gives me company. She understands me and likes being with me. And now this company is gone for a few years. And I don't have anyone else near me who has the same closeness to me, understands me and who gives me the same amount of affection as she gave me. And I love her so, so much that I even have some romantic feelings for her, even if I have a partner right now (who is 8 hours away from me), so seeing her depart to Europe for a long time breaks me a lot. And I don't know how to replace the company that she gave me, because I don't have anyone else.

And I don't know how to find someone else, because when I contact the friends I know here in my city, they're always busy or they're just not interested in hanging out with me. I just want that connection, that closeness, that understanding… but no one wants to provide that to me. I think I am too repellent, weird and autistic for people. I feel most people can't stand me. Some months ago, an asshole who I called friend dumped me right after I begged her for a birthday meetup that she promised because she couldn't attend. When she dumped me, she told me that she wasn't the friend I needed. Like.. why did she decide to be my friend then? She could have easily spared me from a lot of sadness, suffering and pain. And now, I don't even know if anyone wants to come to my birthday party this year.

Thinking about the weekend is so painful, because I now do not have anyone to do things with. I'll have to go to the park and the cinema alone, while feeling miserable and pathetic. Going to those places without a person who is close to me and I enjoy being with is just not the same. It really feels sad. And it breaks me seeing friends with their squads hanging out, families enjoying the moment while I am there, being a pathetic lonely loser, having to conform with plushies, action figures, or fictional worlds I create to at least enjoy some company. And I just don't know how I can replace the company she gave me. I haven't been able to connect with people. Everyone ends up treating me as if I were a burden to them and then they just end up vanishing. They just pretend they're friends with me, but they always treat me very condescendingly. And they don't seem to care for me. They never text me. They never ask me how I am. They never invite me even for some coffee. I just don't feel valued. I feel no one likes me. That my personality is just too much for people. It's so sad living like this.

This means I will need to stay home with my boomer, conservative, transphobic and abusive father. I don't like being with him. He makes me feel that I'm not in a safe place. But my other safe places are disappearing. That is why I'm grieving this so hard. Because I need spaces where I can be myself. Where I am treated well, and where I enjoy the company of people who value me and make me feel cozy.

And my brain just wants more connection, closeness, depth and love. And I am very angry that I haven't been able to find the love that I deserve.  I don't know what else to do..

Obama:(Looking through his papers before finding The Right One) Okay then let's start with the most obvious question Why leave your position as Chief of Police to Run What many called a long shot Campaign 

Brown:(taking a Sip Office coffee and then clearing his throat and speaking with a serious father like Tone) well Through My years of serving The Great state of Ohio and my home Town of Urbana I have theme people from every Walk of Life every type of background investors Construction workers garbage Men Teachers Rich or poor I have seen them all but what was a Constant was the abandonment of the Ordinary American by the political Elite in Columbus and Washington and I just knew One Day that enough was Enough so I started my campaign I knew it was a longshot to the governor's Mansion hell even today It's still unbelievable that I am here as Governor but I know I had to try and then Ordinary American started donating to me and volunteers Came out of the woodwork and soon we were leading in the Polls And here we are months 

Obama: inspiring Story Here is a statement from Pat Buchanan about your Victory that a lot of the questions are about and it reads""this little Rebel from Ohio Thinks that he can take on over 200 years of Political history I would like to see him try he will burn Bright but he will not burn long""What do you say to Buchanan?

Brown:(with a Smirk) I see it as a challenge and I will not give into the Dangerous frankly unamerican populism that is so close to Mr Buchanans Poor Old Heart and I will let my results do the talking for me 

Obama: Well you seem to have a strong mandate to push through your reforms with your Ordinary American party winning both the State House and State Senate Can you share some of your plans?

Brown: Not really because I like to keep my Cards close to my Chest but I can give you a hint one of the things I am gonna be pushing for is a Stronger welfare system that Pushes people forward by pushing them to be productive Which will lead to a Stronger economy by getting more people into the work Force and giving them money to spend Which will drive the economy even more a self feeding cycle

Obama: sounds promising now to end The Interview a question about the Future of the Ordinary American Party What is your plan for that? 

Brown: Well it's a Two Way Solution We have First We Focus on doing a Good job here in Ohio there for we make our ideas look even better Second We have a bottom up strategy we Focus on local elections and then work our way up because if we go straight for federal we are gonna be totally knocked out

1qkylwh,https://www.reddit.com/r/MenWithDiscipline/comments/1qkylwh/the_psychology_of_confidence_sciencebased/,The Psychology of Confidence: Science-Based Strategies That Actually Work,"so i've spent way too much time researching confidence. like an unhealthy amount. books, research papers, podcasts where psychologists break down human behavior. why? because i noticed something disturbing: we're living in a world designed to keep us insecure. social media algorithms profit from our self doubt. dating apps gamify rejection. work culture demands perfection while celebrating imposter syndrome.

and here's what nobody tells you: confidence isn't something you're born with. it's a skill you build. neuroscience confirms this. your brain literally rewires itself based on repeated behaviors. so if you keep avoiding eye contact and apologizing for existing, congrats, you're training yourself to be anxious. but the reverse is also true.

this isn't some rah rah motivational BS. these are actual techniques backed by behavioral psychology that work if you consistently apply them.

stop treating confidence like a personality trait

confidence isn't who you are. it's what you do repeatedly until your nervous system stops freaking out. dr. Amy Cuddy's research at Harvard showed that holding a power pose for two minutes increases testosterone and decreases cortisol. your body literally changes your mind. sounds fake but it's been replicated multiple times.

start small. before any situation where you need confidence (dates, presentations, confrontations), find a bathroom stall and stand like superman for 90 seconds. feels ridiculous. works anyway.

the exposure ladder technique

therapists use this for anxiety disorders but it applies here. you can't go from terrified to fearless overnight. you build tolerance gradually. afraid of public speaking? start by speaking up once in a meeting. then present to three people. then ten. your amygdala (fear center) learns these situations won't kill you.

i found this concept expanded brilliantly in ""The Confidence Code"" by Katty Kay and Claire Shipman. they interviewed neuroscientists, military leaders, athletes. the book destroys the myth that confident people don't feel fear. they just act anyway. insanely good read if you want the science behind why action creates confidence, not the other way around.

kill the highlight reel comparison

you're comparing your behind the scenes footage to everyone else's highlight reel. of course you feel inadequate. researchers call this ""social comparison theory"" and it's destroying gen z mental health at unprecedented rates.

unfollow accounts that make you feel shit. seriously. your brain doesn't distinguish between real life competition and some influencer's curated fantasy. use the app ""one sec"" which adds a breathing exercise before opening social media. sounds simple but it interrupts the dopamine loop that keeps you doomscrolling into self hatred.

develop actual competence in something

real confidence comes from evidence. fake it til you make it only works short term. you need proof you're capable. pick one skill and get annoyingly good at it. cooking, coding, jiujitsu, whatever.

the progress creates genuine self efficacy (belief in your abilities). psychologist albert bandura spent decades proving this. when you've overcome plateaus and seen yourself improve through effort, that confidence transfers to other areas. your brain generalizes the lesson: ""oh, i CAN get better at hard things.""

check out the podcast ""the knowledge project"" by shane parrish. he interviews experts across fields and the pattern is obvious: mastery breeds confidence. episode with navy seal commander rich diviney breaks down how competence under pressure is built through progressive stress exposure.

fix your internal monologue

you talk to yourself more than anyone else talks to you. if that voice is a critic, you're fucked. cognitive behavioral therapy teaches thought interruption. when you catch yourself thinking ""i'm so awkward"" or ""everyone thinks i'm stupid,"" stop. ask: would i talk to a friend this way?

replace it with something neutral, not even positive. ""i'm learning"" or ""that was uncomfortable but i survived."" this isn't toxic positivity. it's basic cognitive restructuring that actually changes neural pathways over time.

the book ""Feeling Good"" by david burns (stanford psychiatrist) teaches this systematically. it's technically about depression but the techniques apply to any negative thought pattern. this book will make you question everything you think you know about your own mind. clinical trials show it's as effective as medication for some people.

embrace strategic discomfort

confidence grows at the edge of your comfort zone, not in the middle of it. make a habit of doing one thing daily that scares you slightly. order coffee in a weird voice. wear something bold. disagree respectfully with someone.

each small win recalibrates what your nervous system considers threatening. eventually things that paralyzed you become mundane. this is systematic desensitization and it's the gold standard for treating phobias.

body language shapes brain chemistry

stand tall, take up space, slow down your movements. this isn't just about appearing confident to others. studies in embodied cognition show your physical state directly influences emotional state.

slouching increases cortisol and negative thoughts. expansive posture does the opposite. try the app ""aloe bud"" for gentle reminders to check your posture and breathing throughout the day. sounds basic but most people spend 8 hours hunched over screens wondering why they feel anxious.

if you want a more structured approach to all this, there's BeFreed, an AI learning app that pulls from psychology research, confidence-building books, and expert insights to create personalized audio lessons.

you can set a specific goal like ""build unshakeable confidence in social situations"" or ""stop second-guessing myself at work,"" and it generates a learning plan tailored to your exact struggle. the depth is adjustable too, from quick 15-minute overviews to 40-minute deep dives with real examples and actionable strategies. built by a team from Columbia and Google, so the content quality is solid and science-backed. worth checking out if you want something more systematic than piecing together random advice.

reframe failure as data collection

confident people fail constantly. they just don't internalize it as identity. when something goes wrong, ask ""what can i learn?"" not ""what's wrong with me?""

this shift from fixed to growth mindset (carol dweck's research at stanford) is the difference between people who give up and people who keep improving. treat your life like an experiment. some tests fail. you adjust variables and try again.

look, nobody's born walking into rooms like they own the place. that's learned behavior built on thousands of small actions that prove to your nervous system: you're capable, you're safe, you can handle whatever comes.

the biological factors are real. some people have naturally lower cortisol or higher testosterone. some grew up in environments that fostered security. but neural plasticity means you're not stuck with the factory settings. you can literally rebuild your confidence operating system through consistent practice.

it's not fast. it's not always comfortable. but it's entirely possible and the research backs every single technique mentioned here. start with one thing today.",1,1769192619.0,MenWithDiscipline,0,1.0,False

(and beyond!) - My wild coding journey","Hey Reddit, I wanted to share my coding origin story, because honestly, a few years ago, the idea of writing a single line of code felt like trying to decipher ancient hieroglyphs. I was stuck in a dead-end job, feeling pretty restless and uninspired, just scrolling through life with no real direction. The world of tech seemed like this exclusive club for super-geniuses, and I definitely wasn't one of them.

Then one day, a friend showed me a simple Python script they'd written to automate a boring task, and something just clicked. It wasn't the code itself that blew me away, but the sheer *power* it offered – the ability to build and create, to make computers *do things*. I remember feeling this weird mix of intimidation and intense curiosity bubbling up. So, I bit the bullet and signed up for a free online course, heart pounding with a mix of dread and excitement.

Oh man, those first few weeks were BRUTAL. Variables, loops, functions... it all felt like a jumbled mess in my brain. There were so many moments I just wanted to slam my laptop shut and declare myself officially 'not a tech person.' I spent hours staring blankly at error messages, feeling a fiery flush of frustration creep up my neck. I distinctly recall one particularly awful debugging session where I swore I could *smell* my brain melting. But then, *poof*! A tiny 'Hello, World!' appeared on my screen, and it felt like I'd just discovered fire. That little win, that tiny spark, kept me going.

From there, it became an obsession. Late nights fuelled by questionable coffee, surrounded by half-eaten snacks, meticulously building small projects, breaking them, and then painstakingly fixing them. Every successful line of code, every bug squashed, felt like a miniature triumph. The frustration never really went away, but it was replaced by a deeper sense of accomplishment and a quiet confidence that grew with each new concept I grasped.

Fast forward to today, and I'm actually working as a junior developer. It still feels surreal sometimes, like I've tricked my way into this cool club. The journey was wild, full of doubt and despair, but also incredible highs when a complex piece of logic finally clicked into place. It's a testament to just showing up, day after day, even when it feels impossible.

So, what's your coding origin story? Did you jump right in, or was it a slow, painful climb like mine? What was that one moment that made you think, 'Hey, maybe I *can* do this?'",1,1769192371.0,u_Leather-Buddy-7902,0,1.0,False

I'm quite new to the hobby and need help regarding grinders – thanks a lot in advance! 

I currently own a DF54, which I mainly use for espresso. Recently, I started to get into filter coffee (V60) and also bought an Aeropress, which I quite enjoy. The DF54 does a reasonably fine job, but I am thinking of an additional (manual) grinder for two reasons:

1) I'd like to up my coffee game while travelling. In the warmer months I do motorcycle trips sometimes and would like to bring an Aeropress in the future, so portability is a factor. But mainly:

2) I'd like to do the beans I buy and brew at home justice and have a grinder at hand that works better for pourovers then my DF54.

1qkyg84,https://www.reddit.com/r/ynab/comments/1qkyg84/i_built_a_receipt_scanner_that_autosplits_line/,I built a receipt scanner that auto-splits line items into YNAB categories,"Hey r/YNAB,

I've been using YNAB for years, and there's one thing that always bugged me: I can see I spent $800 on groceries last month, but I have no idea how much of that was actual food vs. cleaning supplies vs. the snacks my kid swears he'll eat (he won't).

I wanted to track spending trends at the item level — like, am I actually spending $50/month on coffee creamer? (Spoiler: yes.)

I looked for an app that could scan receipts, pull out the line items, and split them into YNAB categories. But everything I found either didn't sync to YNAB, didn't do splits, or wanted to upload my receipts to their servers. No thanks.

So I built my own. Took way longer than I expected (thanks, OCR edge cases), but it works. I've been using it for months now and it's actually changed how I budget.

Then I posted here to see if anyone else cared about this level of detail — turns out I'm not the only nerd. Got some great feedback, found edge cases I hadn't thought of, and realized maybe this is worth sharing.

It's on the App Store now if anyone wants to try it.

Quick rundown: you scan a receipt, it extracts the line items using on-device AI (nothing leaves your phone), suggests category splits, and syncs to YNAB. As far as I know, it's the only receipt scanner that does automatic splits and keeps everything on-device. If I'm wrong, someone please tell me — I looked for months.

There's a free tier (10 scans/month) if you just want to try it without committing. The AI tier is $29.99/year — that's $2.49/month, less than a coffee.

A couple things to know upfront: the AI features require an iPhone that supports Apple Intelligence (iPhone 15 Pro or newer). And the AI learns your category preferences over time, so the first few receipts you'll need to set categories yourself. After 5-10 receipts it gets pretty accurate.

Happy to answer questions if anyone's curious about how it works or wants to tell me what I got wrong.

I'm curious — how would having this level of detail on your receipts help you budget better?
