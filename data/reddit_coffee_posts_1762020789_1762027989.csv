1olxlpl,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1olxlpl/work_relation_that_likely_wont_kick_off_because/,Work relation that likely won't kick off because it feels illegal. M28 / F32,"Hey everyone! 

Feel like such a doughnut for even having to ask advice around here for this issue, but I really need some other people's opinions on things, and a huge thanks in advance for anyone taking the time! I've been working at my job for about a little less than a year now. I'm M28 btw, the counterpart in question is F32. She is also my superior on job. We work in a pretty large , very carreer driven company, and honestly have such a great time when we do. However we're likely starting to cross boundaries of what you would call ""normal workplace dynamics"". There is a click for sure, time goes by so fast and conversations last hours effortlessly. No judgement at all and just such understanding on both ends. Constant compliments, constant eye contact, trying to be around eachother when we get a chance. But all of this always still happens on the verge of being ""sfw"" if that makes sense. Like keeping eachother interested hoping the other person shows a first crack.

However I feel like we reached some form of deadlock, where neither of us act upon the feelings we have because it feels ""taboo"" under our work circumstances. She has a lot going for her, she's a divorced mom for about a year or 2 - 3, a superior to a lot of co-workers that she is responsible for.

I know the type of struggles she could end up in if I were to open up. And both a yes and a no for her answers would bring complications. No bringing the obvious ones, where I would likely have to be placed elsewhere away from being under her lead, if not get a new job altogether. Find it hard to believe I'd get fired for it, but tbf I'd much rather spare us both from the awkward situation that would follow and just move to a new job all together. 

If she said yes, it would, ofcourse, make my day, but also bring countless difficulties. I'm obviously against putting your loved ones above others at work. Everyone should always be treated equally at work, no matter what relation you have. But I feel like this is really the kind of company that wouldn't be too accepting of it. And that is just the ""on paper"" side of things. There are obviously plenty of social barriers too. Co workers on both sides who are likely unaccepting of it. 

And I know for a fact she has similar thoughts as in like ""wouldn't it be weird as the slightly older superior to ask a lower collegue to go out somewhere?"" Or ""man, it would bring me in so much trouble if he doesnt reciprocate these feelings and told people"". And all those are just work related trains of thought. There are obviously way more thoughts on both ends about non work stuff, but these thoughts are what i would classify as the ""normal"" thoughts. 
""Are we compatible?"" , ""does he care i'm a mom"", ""does she mind that i'm younger"", ""is he capable of taking care of both me and my kid"" etc. All of these are equally important things, but with the talks, topics and just good times we had I feel like we're pretty lined up in those aspects. 

What makes it worse is that I didn't plan for this to happen at all. I had actually been keeping myself from ""engaging"" in love for a few years. She wouldn't even fall under what I would say my ""type"" has been, even though I find it hideous to put it that way. I had been shutting feelings down but this time I just couldn't because I fell so hard for someone I never expected to. 

My main goal is to not cause any disorder in either of our lives. Like i'd rather lose a chance with her knowing she'll be fine and not lose out on job oppertunities. But part of me feels like i have never fallen like this before and might regret not telling her afterwards. Like she actually feels like someone I could effortlessly spend the rest of my life with, as much as that sounds like generic love talk lol.  That finally brings me to these 2 questions. 

1 Would any of you, in this situation, actually follow through or back out of the situation and why?

2 If you were to move on, how would you without raising suspicions on work? Bear in mind we haven't seen eachother outside of work because asking for a date or just grabbing a coffee together would raise questions all around, even if friendly. 

Again thanks for taking the time, prolly overthinking WAY too much.

This I‚Äôve found odd as I‚Äôve lived in the UK for the past 8 years and have never experienced it, but I have heard that it happens when a place is damp.

I‚Äôd like to get a dehumidifier, I intend to move next year back home where a dehumidifier isn‚Äôt needed, and I don‚Äôt intend to bring it with me. 

In the previous flat I rented last year, it came with dehumidifiers and my question is whether I could ask my landlord to purchase a dehumidifier for the flat, or if I should just get one myself. What‚Äôs the usual procedure here? I don‚Äôt mind getting one myself, and I‚Äôve never asked landlords for anything before.

For further context, my landlord is very nice and the flat came pretty much all kitted out - had everything from umbrellas to cutlery to a cool coffee press, so I thought a dehumidifier might be something they‚Äôre alright with getting. ",1,1762027451.0,HousingUK,3,1.0,False
1olxjbo,https://www.reddit.com/r/SaaSMarketing/comments/1olxjbo/how_i_doubled_saas_engagement_by_switching_from/,How I doubled SaaS engagement by switching from batching to real-time content creation,"For 8 months, I ran our SaaS content engine like most teams: batching everything. Monday was ""content planning day,"" Tuesday-Thursday were ""creation days,"" and Friday was ""scheduling day."" We'd queue up 2-3 weeks of content in one sitting.

Our engagement was... fine. 2-4% CTR, decent reach, but nothing exciting.

Then I had a coffee chat with a founder who said something that changed everything: ""Your audience doesn't live in batches. Why does your content?""

Here's what I switched to (and the results):

**THE SHIFT:**

1. **Killed the content calendar** \- Replaced it with a ""content pulse"" system. Instead of planning 3 weeks ahead, I track 3 things daily: what users are asking in support, what's trending in our niche, and what competitors just posted.
2. **30-minute rapid response window** \- When something relevant happens (a user wins, industry news drops, competitor launches), we create content within 30 minutes. Not 3 days later when it's cold.
3. **Template system, not from scratch** \- Built 12 content templates (win stories, workflow tips, myth-busters, hot takes). Each takes 10 minutes to customize vs 2 hours to create from nothing.
4. **Real-time engagement tracking** \- Check engagement every 2 hours, not every 2 days. If something hits 20+ reactions in first hour, we double down with follow-up content same day.

**THE RESULTS (90 days):**

‚Ä¢ Engagement rate: 2.3% ‚Üí 4.7% (104% increase) ‚Ä¢ Response time to trends: 3 days ‚Üí 45 minutes ‚Ä¢ Content creation time: 6 hours/piece ‚Üí 25 minutes/piece ‚Ä¢ Viral posts (1K+ reach): 1 per month ‚Üí 8-12 per month ‚Ä¢ Demo requests from content: +67%

**WHY IT WORKS:**

Batching optimizes for YOUR schedule. Real-time optimizes for THEIR attention.

When you respond to what's happening NOW (not what you planned 2 weeks ago), you:

* Ride existing conversation momentum
* Sound like a human, not a content robot
* Catch people when the topic is already on their mind
* Show you're actually paying attention to the industry

**THE UNCOMFORTABLE PART:**

This feels chaotic at first. You lose the comfort of a filled content calendar. Some days you post 3 times. Some days nothing. Your inner control freak hates it.

But here's what I learned: Consistent mediocrity gets beat by strategic spontaneity every time.

**HOW TO START (if you're skeptical):**

1. Keep batching for 70% of content
2. Reserve 30% for real-time opportunities
3. Track engagement differences between batched vs real-time
4. Adjust ratio based on what performs
5. In 3 months, you'll probably be at 70% real-time like me

**TOOLS I USE:**

‚Ä¢ Slack alerts for support keywords ‚Ä¢ Feedly + IFTTT for competitor/industry monitoring ‚Ä¢ Notion database with the 12 templates ‚Ä¢ Buffer for still scheduling some evergreen stuff

Happy to share my template system or answer questions about the workflow. This shift saved me 15+ hours/week while doubling results.

1olxesh,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1olxesh,Thoughts from my recent visit :p,"so i visited Vietnam with 2 of my friends for 13d12n. we visited Hanoi, Halong Bay, Hoi An, Danang, Bana Hills, HCMC (in the same order)

it was a phenomenol experience. the people were very kind and inviting. even old uncles would always greet you with a smile and a hello (which is a big thing considering their lack of use of english).

the cities were clean af. though i really found it quite hard to find a dustbin in hanoi lol. had to carry bottles and food boxes for like a kilometer before we found a public dustbin (we refrained from throwing our garbage into another food stall's bin)

i found the parties to be best at Hanoi (specifically Old Quarters). we didnt party in Danang and in HCMC it was just filled with prostitution (which was really sad to see).

the only drawback i had in my whole trip was food. me being a vegetarian (no eggs) was a major problem for me but even my non-vegetarian friend had difficulty choosing because he himself doesnt like seafood. and according to him, even the meat wasnt that good (we're indian jbtw). even foreign cuisines like italian, american and french were just fine and nothing to talk home about. Only in HCMC did we have really really good food. I visited one pizzeria (dont remember the name but it was on the 2nd/3rd floor) in the cafe apartment building and it was one of the best pizzas I've ever had (i've eaten A LOT of pizzas lol) and the american burger joint Eddie's in District 1 was very nice. even pizza 4p's was good enough and better than most places we ate at in vietnam.

I also really liked the War Remnants Museum in HCMC. I spent like 2-3 hours there reading all the articles on the floors. it was really an eye opener and at the same time, it was a shame that similar atrocities are still happening throughtout the world. after going through it all, i could really connect the dots and felt the differences in culture, accents and even the normal lifestyle of the northern and southern vietnamese people. i wished i knew all those details about the war before my trip. it'd have led to an even deeper connection and understanding.

my favorite part was chilling in a sea facing bnb in danang. it was such a nice vibe. something i'd really like to do for a longer duration (1-2 months) given that i work remotely anyway. the only thing holding me back would be the food lol.

one thing i'll definitely suggest to avoid is staying at Mercur hotel in Bana Hills. it was such a farse and a very mid hotel costing so much money. just do a day visit and try to reach early (8-9am). that'll be more than enough. the only ones i would recommend it to is young couples because of the insane amount of spots to have fun at lol. also, there was this coffee shop called AnBana. they have THE BEST hot chocolate i've ever had. it was the salted hot chocolate. i had it twice (first in the evening and then the next morning) but only the first was great. the second one was just fine. the first one was made by some dude while the second one was made by some woman. the first one was soooo soooo good, damn!

overall, i really loved the country and would love to visit again. next time i'll do the Ha Giang Loop, Ninh Binh and Phu Quoc (among others).",1,1762027148.0,VietNam,0,1.0,False

This story has been heavy on me for months. I finally cut off someone who broke me piece by piece, and writing this feels like my last step to let go. I know some of you will say I should‚Äôve left a long time ago, but it‚Äôs not that easy when you‚Äôre emotionally trapped but like every abusive relationship you feel overreacting 

From the start, he said everything I wanted to hear that he loved me, that we‚Äôd get married, that I was his only one, his peace, his priority, the one he‚Äôd do anything for. He‚Äôd call me 50 or 60 times if I didn‚Äôt answer, text me nonstop, and say he couldn‚Äôt go a day without hearing my voice. Even during important meetings, he‚Äôd hide in the bathroom just to FaceTime me for a few minutes that‚Äôs how obsessed he was.

But when it came to actually seeing me in real life, he never showed up. Every single date had an excuse: ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sick,‚Äù ‚ÄúI‚Äôm tired,‚Äù ‚Äúsomething came up.‚Äù And then he‚Äôd go to dinner or back to work the same night. I‚Äôd get dressed, look beautiful, wait for him, and end up crying in bed. When I told him how hurt I was, he‚Äôd turn everything around say I was crazy, dramatic, that I didn‚Äôt respect myself, that I needed to stop the ‚Äúdrama‚Äù and get back with him.

Still, I stayed, because each time he‚Äôd come back saying he loved me and would change. And when he wanted to, he could act so loving and gentle.

He‚Äôs rich, powerful with drivers and everything. He could‚Äôve come to me anytime but I think he liked seeing me wait. It gave him control. Yet he couldn‚Äôt go even one day without talking to me. If I pulled away, he‚Äôd spam my phone, insult me, and tell me I was the reason he acted that way and that he would say anything to piss me off because I treat him as a dog

Today was the day I finally woke up. We had planned a date after he convinced me for 3 days He promised he‚Äôd call his driver to come pick me up. I trusted him again. I got ready  wore a dress and heels, looked stunning. And it‚Äôs not me saying it everyone who sees me says I‚Äôm beautiful, even strangers. Even him even when he was angry, he‚Äôd still say I was ‚Äúextremely beautiful.‚Äù

When he didn‚Äôt call, I decided to drive myself to his house because I wanted to see what excuse he‚Äôd come up with this time.

He came downstairs looking miserable dirty t-shirt with holes, coffee stains all over, flip-flops, smelling like coffee and sweat. And the first thing he said to me, while looking me up and down, was:

‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs this dress and heels? Are you going into a ball?‚Äù

For the first time, I didn‚Äôt even feel angry. I just saw how pathetic he looked next to me. I take care of myself that day I looked radiant. He‚Äôs short, overweight, unkempt and I never judged him for his looks. I chose him because I thought he had a good heart.

Then he said, ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre nothing.‚Äùyou‚Äôre not impressing me Then He tried to sit inside my car and said, ‚ÄúMove your dirty bag and your dirty glasses, I don‚Äôt want to touch them,‚Äù and kicked them with his leg. It was my car, my own car and he acted like he owned it. Then he said, ‚ÄúThese glasses are fake as fuck.‚Äù My bag was designer, my glasses were real. He just wanted to humiliate me.

Then he said, ‚ÄúI treat you like my employee,‚Äù even though I never asked for or accepted a single penny from him. I‚Äôve always paid for myself. He‚Äôs never given me anything, and still treated me like I was beneath him.

In the past, he‚Äôs told me to ‚Äúshut up,‚Äù ‚Äústop opening your dirty mouth,‚Äù and once when I was stressed and got my period twice in one month, he said, ‚ÄúYou‚Äôll never have kids.‚Äù That‚Äôs when I realized he wanted to break me down and make me feel worthless because deep down, he felt that way about himself.

When I told him today, ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs just say goodbye, we‚Äôre done,‚Äù he looked at me and said:

‚ÄúOkay, I have 2‚Äì3 girls waiting. I‚Äôm gonna fuck a bit since I didn‚Äôt fuck you.‚Äù

He said that word for word. I just stared at him. I didn‚Äôt even cry this time. He‚Äôs always told me he says cruel things just to piss me off, but it only shows who he really is.

I blocked him ‚Äî but he‚Äôs been calling me from unknown numbers. He even said, ‚ÄúGod will make you pay for the pain you caused me.‚Äù When in reality, I was the one crying every single night for months.

He always told me he couldn‚Äôt go a day without talking to me, that he‚Äôd go crazy if I disappeared. This time, I know he will but I finally won‚Äôt.

I chose him for his heart, not for his money or his looks. And I lost so much of myself trying to heal someone who only wanted power, not love.

And the worst part after hurting me in the worst ways possible and I stay silent I tell him I‚Äôm going home he tells me look people are looking at you because you‚Äôre crazy you have no shame stop this drama and close your mouth and let‚Äôs be actually together and work on it

If you made it to the end, thank you for reading. I‚Äôd be really grateful for your support or advice it truly means a lot.",2,1762027059.0,AmIOverreacting,0,1.0,False

by [https://www.gptsportswriter.com](https://www.gptsportswriter.com) **Dallas vs. Detroit: A High-Altitude Honeymoon for the Pistons? Or a Mavericks‚Äô Revenge Plot?**

The Dallas Mavericks and Detroit Pistons are set to clash in Mexico City like two boxers trading jabs in a ring filled with confetti and altitude-induced headaches. Let‚Äôs dissect this matchup with the precision of a sports analyst who‚Äôs also, inexplicably, a stand-up comedian.

---

### Parsing the Odds: Numbers Don‚Äôt Lie (Mostly)

The Pistons enter as 75% favorites, while Dallas clings to a 29.4% chance like a toddler holding a melting ice cream cone. FanDuel‚Äôs spread? Detroit -7.5. That‚Äôs the kind of line that makes you wonder if the oddsmakers bet on this game themselves and then immediately regretted it.

**Key stats to chew on:**

* **Cooper Flagg‚Äôs Points Under 16.5**: The rookie is averaging 13.4 PPG, so this feels like betting on a cautious investor‚Äîsafe, but not exactly thrilling.
* **Cade Cunningham‚Äôs Points Over 25.5**: At 22.2 PPG, this is a ‚Äúbuy the rumor, sell the news‚Äù play. Cunningham‚Äôs like a caffeinated squirrel in a basketball jersey‚Äîhyper, productive, and occasionally knocking over your coffee table.
* **Total Points Line**: 226.5-227.5. Given Detroit‚Äôs 135-116 shellacking of the Magic last time out, the ‚ÄúOver‚Äù is tempting. But Dallas‚Äô 10th-ranked defense (110.3 efficiency) might turn this into a ‚Äúlow-scoring thriller‚Äù for the birds.

---

### News Digest: Injuries, Altitude, and One Very Confused City

**Dallas‚Äô Woes**: Anthony Davis is out with a calf injury, which is like losing your team‚Äôs quarterback to a paper cut‚Äîminor, but it stings. They‚Äôre leaning on P.J. Washington (15.2 PPG) and Flagg, who‚Äôs proving he‚Äôs not just a ‚Äúone-hit wonder‚Äù (yet). Max Christie and Klay Thompson will attempt to rain three-pointers on Detroit, though Thompson‚Äôs 1.4 threes/game is about as reliable as a weather forecast in Mexico City.

**Detroit‚Äôs Drama**: The Pistons are missing Jaden Ivey (knee surgery) and have a turnover problem‚Äî25 giveaways in a recent loss to Cleveland. But Cade Cunningham is playing like he‚Äôs auditioning for an MVP speech, and Tobias Harris is still a human highlight reel. Their defense (10th in efficiency) is solid, but can they handle Dallas‚Äô altitude advantage?

I‚Äôve worked at my first and current MSP for about 8 months, initially I was more front desk oriented but I got promoted in June to Tier 1 NOC. I thought this would be great, pay jumped up a bit too! At first it was fine, we are merging two companies and I  was trained on the acquired companies side which was almost always just me sending the cases to the required tier 2 team. This part I  actually enjoyed and my days were fine.

For the last 2 months I  have been flipped onto the other companies side which is heavy troubleshooting in comparison. Mainly though, the phone queue has been draining me so much. To put it bluntly, our shifts are 12 hours 3-4 days a week, I also have an hour commute each way too, so when I get home I maybe have 2 hours before bed. 

I have been having horrible sleep these last few months and I cannot fix it. I am beyond stressed out. I‚Äôm trying everything but I always wake up multiple times throughout the night and feel horrible even on my days off. 

The work itself isn‚Äôt terrible despite the heavier troubleshooting, mixture of network, firewalls, data protection, and cloud cases. 

The phone queue is crazy though and I feel like every other call is something niche that I don‚Äôt know. Trying to do everything is just so draining, tracking my time for every little thing, getting back to back calls where I  can‚Äôt focus on just one case, not having much for support from the tier 1s or 2s, etc. For the tier 1s there is only two others on my shift besides me. I started the phone queue maybe 2 months ago and at first it was fine, but it‚Äôs been stressing me out more and more and i‚Äôve been physically breaking down crying at least twice a week after my shifts. I can‚Äôt get work out of my mind, I bring it into every aspect of my life. 

How do yall manage the stress, anxiety, and everything else? Will it eventually get better? I have some PTO for Christmas so i‚Äôm just trying to make it until then for right now. 

I‚Äôm trying to break into cyber but the market right now is brutal. Internally i‚Äôve made good connections to the SOC team through a few of them and even had a coffee chat with the manager of the SOC team a few months ago to learn more about what they are looking for and their internal tooling but at BEST the earliest position would most likely be March-May and even then I may not get it. 

As a side note, I live with my parents still as they are some of the best people on this planet and my family has been nothing but supportive. They have mentioned time and time again that I look like death and are worried about me. I‚Äôm trying my best to power through but as i‚Äôm writing this i‚Äôm on the verge of tears trying to just suck it up and power through. ",7,1762026988.0,msp,2,0.89,False

It's the first time I am writing in reddit for something like that, so please be gentle with me and don't hate me for the huge rant!! Haha üòÖ

I (36M) had a thing with a girl (31F) last year, for about 3 months. I live in the balkans by the way. 
Fact is that I didn't know what a situationship is, until I lived it. So I met this very cute girl in a bar, talked to her, exchanged numbers and started texting about when to set up a date. 

After a few dates, which were perfect, from drinks to theaters and restaurants, we eventually got intimate and had sex. Which was also perfect, every single time, except from maybe the first time, which was somewhat a journey of one discovering another's body. Sex was so good for both, that she even mentioned the fact that after many years she was finding herself enjoying having sex, because in her last big relationship (which was about 3 years) she didn't enjoy sex at all, and that's when she promised to herself that sex would play a big role in her future relationships. She worked evening hours, so about midnight I would go to her house 2 times per week or so, spend the night there (also asking her if she would like me to leave after sex, in order to sleep alone or whatever.. I didn't wanna apply pressure to her, but every time she wanted me there) and then the next day go out for breakfast, coffee and generally stay with her until next day 16:00 when she would have to work. We told each other everything about our lives, and it was obvious that we had a very good chemistry. We continued meeting often, indoors or outdoors. It felt like it was progressively going into something beautiful, and I liked it. I started having feelings about her because we did all the things that couples do. 

Waking up to find messages and reels from her was such a pleasant surprise for me, because I wasn't used to a woman showing such interest to me. Usually it was the other way round. 
I also received late night calls from her at 03:00, ranting about her past mistakes, the pressure that she felt about her new job and many more.. I was understanding and tried to help her with those issues. 
Fact is that maybe I shouldn't have been so understanding and good with her.. Because when we reached 20th of December, we had our last meeting before Christmas break. Again visited her after work, spent the night together, next day went for brunch and shopping, and then kissing each other goodbye for the Christmas holidays which we would spend in different cities with our families and telling each other that we would meet in about 8-10 days. 

So.. During the holidays, she was getting colder in the messages, I could feel that. Slow and taciturn replies, the exact opposite from what I was used to. And at the 30th of December, she texts me this 

""I wanna share something that bothers me with you. Unfortunately, there's no right timing to say something like that. I had a great time with you, but for me it's obvious that we have to stop seeing each other. I can't do this anymore. I am so sorry..""

Needless to say that she fucked my feelings. I never saw it coming, because she had expressed thoughts and feelings that you normally don't share with someone that you plan to just have sex with and then dump him. I tried to reply in a calm and polite way, and we stopped talking after a few texts, because it was obvious that she had made her decision. 10 days later, she wishes me for my name day, around midnight, telling me that she also lost her grandma and she had a bad day. Again, I replied in a polite and respectful way, telling her to reach out to me if she needs something and we never talked again. From what I can tell, she was obviously weak when we first met, then gradually felt better and better as the time went by, and when she felt really really good with herself, after healing during the time she was with me, she dumped me. 

NOW, let's go to the REALLY interesting stuff.

I found out that she's in a relationship with a guy since we broke up. From what I can tell, she must have started dating him while we where together, because very shortly after we broke up, they were together. 
Fact is, about a month ago, that this guy is following ANOTHER girl and starting texting each other, while being in a relationship with my ex. Liking her stories, photos, and subtly kind of flirting with her. As a man, you NEVER like photos and stories of a girl you don't even know, when you have a relationship. 
Turns out this girl is a friend of mine and I accidentally found out about him texting her when she received a message from him while we were having a coffee and she showed his profile to me. 

Now, what do I do?
My friend asked me if I want her to follow my ex on Instagram, so that the ex will see the mutual friend (aka the guy) and start having doubts and questions about him, and she even proposed to go one step further, texting my ex out of the blue and asking her if she knows the mutual friend (aka the guy) because they have been chatting for a while and she wants to know more about him from someone who knows him, since he's a complete stranger. 

What do you suggest? 
Do I stay put and tell the friend to simply stop talking to him, or do I tell her to go all the way, follow her and talk to her about him? 
I know it's bad for me to say it, but part of me wants a revenge, wants my ex to find out about him talking to other girls.

1olxb0j,https://www.reddit.com/r/ActualLesbiansOver25/comments/1olxb0j/check_in_or_no_contact/,Check in or no contact?,"TL;DR: 
Hi from Italy! 
I (35F) had a short LDR ‚Äúalmost relationship‚Äù with a 26F who isn‚Äôt ready.. avoidant? (ex in the background.. (only happy birthday messages actually) closeted at home, job instability). We briefly ‚Äúended‚Äù in late Sept; 5 days later I broke NC with a playful message ‚Äúfrom my dog,‚Äù she was happy I reached out, we met again‚Ä¶ and she still said she wasn‚Äôt ready (‚ÄúFOR NOW it‚Äôs better not to be in touch‚Äù). Since then she views my stories fast and likes, but takes no concrete steps. Should I send one neutral ‚Äúhow are you / work updates?‚Äù in mid/late Nov, or go full no contact?

Background:
	‚Ä¢	I‚Äôm 35F, came out years ago; ended a 7-year relationship (4 years marriage) last year.
	‚Ä¢	She‚Äôs 26F, lives 2 hours away (different regions), hasn‚Äôt come out to family, was left by her ex 1.5/2 years ago. She once said if they met again ‚Äúsomething might happen, i wouldn‚Äôt stop it‚Äù, 
	‚Ä¢	Job: her fixed-term contract just ended; unsure what‚Äôs next.
	‚Ä¢	I‚Äôm anxious-leaning but self-aware; quiet lifestyle (dog, nature), want someone who adds to my life.

What happened:
	‚Ä¢	We met twice; I initiated. She was tender and even cried.
	‚Ä¢	End of Sept we ‚Äúbroke it off.‚Äù After 5 days, I messaged again fron my dog point of view and She seemed genuinely happy, we met a second time, chemistry was there‚Ä¶ but she repeated she wasn‚Äôt ready and staying in contact now would become ‚Äútoxic.‚Äù
	‚Ä¢	Final: she cried, cuddled me, and said: ‚Äúfor the moment it‚Äôs better this way.‚Äù I said: ‚ÄúI won‚Äôt reach out; if things change, you know where to find me.‚Äù Even if i know that even if she really wanted, she wouldn‚Äôt.

Since then:
	‚Ä¢	She views my IG stories within minutes, even the dog‚Äôs account, and often likes my dog/nature/me posts very quickly.
	‚Ä¢	No DMs, no proposals to talk/meet.
	‚Ä¢	I‚Äôve noticed she also likes heartbreak/quote posts that likely relate to her ex, i guess.


My dilemma now:
	‚Ä¢	Plan = one neutral check-in mid/late Nov (about a month after the job ended):
‚ÄúHow are you? Any work updates?‚Äù
Then stop.
	‚Ä¢	Part of me thinks don‚Äôt message at all: breaking NC in Sept brought her back emotionally but didn‚Äôt change her availability. I don‚Äôt want to be her ‚Äúvalidation fix.‚Äù

Questions:
	1.	Given this pattern (tender ‚Üí ‚Äúnot ready‚Äù ‚Üí spectator mode on IG), is one neutral check-in reasonable, or is strict no contact healthier? (I know)
	2.	Do story views/quick likes mean anything beyond nostalgia/avoidance unless paired with words + actions?
	3.	Did breaking NC once (via my dog) teach her that I‚Äôll restart contact?
	4.	If I send the check-in and get ‚ÄúI‚Äôm fine, no updates, you?‚Äùwhat‚Äôs the clean, boundary-respecting exit line?
	

What I‚Äôm inclined to do (open to feedback):
	‚Ä¢	If I feel calm by mid/late Nov, send one neutral text. If she‚Äôs short/silent ‚Üí accept the data, mute everything for 30 days, and move on.
	‚Ä¢	If she‚Äôs warm but vague ‚Üí no chasing; I‚Äôll require clear steps (a short call or coffee).
	‚Ä¢	If nothing changes ‚Üí full NC. 
Compatibility includes availability.

Thanks for reading, chatgpt helped me with the recapü§£ I‚Äôm not trying to ‚Äúwin‚Äù her, just to choose the healthiest next step for me (which i know would be full NC, but i‚Äôm kinda antisocial and finding a person i liked in many ways and so compatible with me and not having a chance to try and see where we could be going is messing with my brainü•≤)

I feel like there is a great deal of connection within popular culture to us. The fact that Scream has become a cross generational experience and gave life to the meta art movement; we were given both the Star Wars prequels and sequels; Stranger Things celebrates our youth, childhood friendships, and stars Winona Ryder; our TV shows such as Roseanne, 90210, Full House, Saved by the Bell; Boy/Girl Meets World, etc. have been rebooted/torch passed down; the music my young adult kids are into in mostly ours and most local bands in my area are 90s cover bands; the appreciation and nostalgia for Blockbuster nights; Tic Tok and Instagram have their roots in us with our camcorders; flannels and doc martins still tend to be the dominant style; people still hang out at coffee shops (more corporate now though); and a trick or treater even showed up at my door dressed as Marty McFly last night.

1olxarb,https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/1olxarb/the_light_is_green/,The Light Is Green,"There is a fire burning.

Gently, as gently as a atomic flame can rage. Just a small one, a national forest set alight unintentionally by a tactical warhead. Eventually, it will burn out, leaving nothing but devastation no more, just like DC, like LA, like god only knows how many cities. 

Tonight, Simon has one job. To add another flame.

His helicopter is banking low, the pilot skilfully delivering his cargo at minimum altitude and maximum speed, their best chance against Hekatian air defences. The 160th SOAR has been hollowed out by this brutal war, and the pilot seems rather discomforted by the knowledge of who he must convey, but he does it anyway.

In the back of the state-of-Humanity‚Äôs-art helicopter sit 5 soldiers, 1 device, and 2.5 kilotons of hell. Simon bears the monster himself, an untested fresh iteration of a classic that has been rushed into service so quickly as to not even receive a proper designation. It has a name, though. Atomic Demolition Munition. A last-and-next generation atomic solution to a problem he *really* wishes wasn‚Äôt his generation‚Äôs.

None of this could have been expected. But it has been prepared for.

The helicopter makes another manoeuvre, and begins to land, moving dramatically. It takes years of skill to perform as well as this pilot has, and there is every chance he will be swatted out of the sky helplessly on his way home. But he will try, just as Simon will, and just as uncountable soldiers have.

He and his team dismount, the 55 pound device strapped to Simon‚Äôs back. It looks like a small barrel, hardly as menacing as one would assume. Also present are Simon‚Äôs rifle, and various necessary supplies for the mission and their way home, leaving him heavily laden. The rest of the team has no easy load either, and the rest of the trek will be gruelling. But it is the job.

They move steadily, quietly. Simon, like the rest of the team, has served for years in the more *regular* special forces, fighting other Humans what feels like a lifetime ago. Then the Contact War came, and the Teams were formed, resuscitating the ideas of the Cold War for a new apocalypse. Only a thin sliver of the best get to be here, now, because only that thin sliver is capable enough to ensure the device gets where it needs to, mission-focused enough to sacrifice everything for it, and resilient enough to have a chance of getting out. It is mostly the middle part that command prioritises.

It feels heavier. The dummy should have been an accurate weight, but it feels so much heavier here and now. Maybe Simon‚Äôs favourite rumour is true, that the real thing has a pack of 4 Medals of Honor stuffed inside. Not like there‚Äôs a President around to pass them out anymore. Maybe it‚Äôs just psychological. Maybe he‚Äôs tired from this entire war. Does it matter?

It is an arduous trek, but they move at a good enough pace. The Hekatians have the tech to spot them, but they do not have the numbers, and so they arrive at the target area in good time and with no issues.

Simon looks down from the hills, at what must be obliterated. For Humanity‚Äôs sake. It is not a major bridge, a military base, a landing site for alien craft. It is a truck stop, one with the distinct bad luck to be built along I-40. A rural spot, surrounded by steep hills and dense woodland that make an approach near-effortless, and let the device do what it does best, turn nature itself against an enemy. Severing this road cuts a spine out from the alien forces occupying most of America, occupying Simon‚Äôs home. Their tanks, transports, supplies, will die, or find an impenetrable wall of rubble and an irradiated road for their troubles.

The enemy‚Äôs patrols are visible, a small maintenance unit having set up at the stop. It‚Äôs really more of a gift with purchase to the main effort. But these are not crack troops, and they clearly aren‚Äôt even expecting partisans. Any guerilla that tried could probably overrun this stop easily‚Ä¶ and get obliterated by enemy air cover, for very little strategic gain. 

Simon looks elsewhere, at the lay of the land. He‚Äôs taking it in, assessing optimum siting, routes to get there, and potentially hidden patrols or sensors. But he is also appreciating this spot that will cease to exist. Nature has taken millenia to form these hills, that river. Humanity has taken decades to put it right here, right now, through dams and dredging and defences. Now, Humanity will beat it‚Äôs own record, reshaping the landscape with just milliseconds. All to buy days, weeks, months, maybe? Perhaps only hours. Who can say?

Not Simon‚Äôs job to.

Picking a site is easy. Securing it is even easier. The bomb is emplaced as close as they can reasonably get, to maximise destructive effect. Even with a nuke, distance and terrain counts.

Sadly, the rumoured medals turn out to be a myth, as does the competing rumour of a good bottle of whiskey. But the bomb is there as promised, which knocks out a third rumour that it was all just an elaborate prank. Setup is easy, anticlimactically so. 

They unspool the wire detonator, travelling in as close to a straight line as possible with the thing. Unfortunately, a artifact of the rushed development of the device is no one produced a detonation cord long enough for a safe distance to be attained. So they move carefully, trying to prevent it getting snagged. Every meter increases the chance of survival, but the best way of evading the fireball is to be using the remote trigger.

When they run out of wire, they set the wire, then retreat to the actual firing site, sheltered by rocks and trees. Here, Simon gets his first rest of the night. It is only brief, given when dawn comes it arrives with the lead elements of the Hekatian 648th armoured division. Or so Simon understands. The reality is that this is in fact the 723rd, but that reality changes nothing, for they will die all the same. The 648th have been spared, and the 723rd doomed, by the simple act of a commander being asleep when the movement order was given. Incompetence will save thousands, and competence kill more, for this is the nuclear battlefield.

There has been some debate amongst the team as to when to go for it. Simon has a specific idea, and while it was dismissed by his colleagues as ‚Äòvibes based‚Äô, it‚Äôs he who is at the detonator today, and so it is his choice. He is waiting for the first mixup, when an IFV travels between two tanks. He thinks it is a sign of complacency, the point at which density is highest, alert is lowest, and anyone that doesn‚Äôt instantly die is liable to make mistakes in response that injure and kill more.

Sure enough, he can see what he was searching for. And so he does it. He presses the detonator, eyes shut, facing away. He expects, even in this pose, to be half blinded by the fury. But nothing comes. He tries again, and the world remains silent.

He turns his head, to see the enemy continue to advance. The detonator has failed, perhaps a jammer, perhaps error, perhaps because it is a kludge in a war full of kludges. It doesn‚Äôt matter, what matters is that there is a failure. There is an anti-tamper device that still ensures the desired effect, but for it‚Äôs detonation to be relevant, that would rely on Hekatian combat engineers to be effective, something this war has given little reason to count on. 

He sighs, and shakes his head. Then he runs, like never before. Forward, only forward. Deep down, he knew this would be a one way operation. Just not like this. But what difference does it make, really?

It would have been nicer to have a longer cord, though.

33 y/o guy with a cute smile (have been told so) with a career in tech ( but not a tech bro ), a calm presence with a life that has been a wild adventure of extremes, I thrive on intellectual chaos. I like to read, anything everything from systems theory to modern french history, particularly energy and clean (it‚Äôs one of my passion).

**What I‚Äôm Looking For:**

A **childfree, progressive partner** who sees life as a playground of possibilities, not a checklist. Someone unapologetically herself‚Äîsexually liberated, intellectually fearless, and allergic to societal scripts. Let‚Äôs skip the small talk and dissect the big questions: How do we live ethically in a burning world? Can love exist without ownership?

**Why We Might Click:**

* **Staunchly Childfree :** I don‚Äôt want kids (ever), both for personal freedom and because bringing new life into an overburdened world feels tragically naive. Let‚Äôs channel that energy into activism, art, or adventure instead.
* **You crave depth :** My attachment style is securely rooted. I‚Äôm here for mutual growth, not games. Whether we‚Äôre debating moral gray zones or testing new boundaries in the bedroom, I value curiosity over judgment.
* **You‚Äôre a shapeshifter :** Artist, scientist, activist, hedonist.... you refuse to be boxed in. Bonus if you‚Äôve got stories from living unconventionally or a passion project that keeps you up at night.
* **You laugh easily :** My humor leans dry, my vibe is warm, and I‚Äôll absolutely lean into the absurdity of dating via Reddit posts

\*\*The Vibe:\*\*Imagine slow mornings with coffee and *Sapiens* debates, weekends volunteering at climate marches or getting lost in a neon-lit bar abroad. I‚Äôm driven but not ruthless, my version of ‚ÄúMachiavellian‚Äù is designing a life that‚Äôs sustainable, joyful, and defiantly *ours*.

I'm right now focusing on building female friendships, and I've really been loving hanging out with my girlfriends and how emotionally attuned and supportive they are. Several weeks ago, I had two coffee dates where both of the women gave me gifts. And it made me think, I'm getting my emotional needs met and getting gifts - what is the point of a man lol?

I feel like the only thing that a man would provide me that I don't have is sex, and even then, there would be no guarantee that it would be good, or better than what I can provide for myself.

out of nowhere, we were facetiming and he said he thinks this is it for us and broke up with me. that morning, he told me i had his whole heart and couldn't wait for me to move home. he said he was having doubts and had a gut feeling and wasn't sure if we were a right fit.

we talked a lot about our relationship after we broke up and he said doesn't think he'll find someone better or find a better relationship than ours and he was happy, but it's just what he needed.

it was hard for me to give him space, and i know i shouldn't have, but we called a few times and each time he said he missed me, but he was relieved he didn't have the big decision weighing over him. i asked if he was relieved we weren't together and he said that wasn't it at all.

he's avoidant. it took a lot to get him to open up and i even had coffee with his sister who he's close to and she was surprised by how the breakup went down because he never told her about it. i'm sure he hasn't spoken much to his friends either.

he asked me to stop calling him, then afterwards asked me to remove him from my private story and deleted our pictures off his instagram. when i offered to unfollow him he said that wasn't what he wanted and he was sorry and he knew none of this was fair to me.

tiktok is making me go crazy. i keep seeing all these posts about avoidants just need time and they'll come back. in my heart, i don't think we're done, but my mind obviously can't know. i think he still loves me and got overwhelmed by how serious we'd be getting by me moving home.

we've been no contact for two days and i plan not to reach out. but how do you know when it's over? i know i need to work and focus on myself, but does it sound like this is over? i'm so heartbroken, sad, and confused. i know no one can know for sure, but some insight would help",2,1762026052.0,BreakUps,0,1.0,False

I am aware that this will not be popular. However, before you come to a conclusion, please just hear me out. I need advice that is grounded in my perspective (you will see what I mean).

I have savings and investments that are broadly distributed and are safe investments that I will not touch (and I will add to) for the next 40 years until I retire (this has been done professionally not by myself.

However, I have a sum of money that I do not need to have in cash (I have sufficient cash savings) and ultimately I do not need for my retirement fund.

I wanted (because I want to also live a little as a young man, I understand I can just make my retirement pot bigger and bigger) to invest this money into vanguard s&p 500 etf and then just sell it each day at a random positive position. 

Lets say this sum of money (I will not say the actual amount as I hope you respect) is ¬£100. If the etf goes up by 0.5% at a random point in the day (I wfh so I can check regularly), I will just sell the 50p. (As it will be ¬£100.50). I will then keep aside the capital gains tax percentage (to pay later) and what I have left ~40p, I will use to literally buy ice cream or a coffee etc. 

This is money I do not want or need to invest in my pension and it is money I do not need in cash.

I KNOW I can make way more money buy utilising compound interest and leaving it for decades. But, I want some fun with it now and at the same time, I am extremely risk averse, so I do not actually want to bet on individual stocks and shares or crypto.

Also, I am fully aware that the ¬£100 could crash and I would have to accept that my 'daily ice cream fund' would be out of action for perhaps 5+ years (until it goes above ¬£100 again).

What do you think of this? For my purposes and wants, is that okay? (P.s. I am aware of platform fees for selling, and I would factor that into the amount of money I would be making). Just want a bit of cash in hand that otherwise would be languishing.

Here‚Äôs what my first 30 days looked like.,"Alright, r/SaaS, I have a confession. I‚Äôm a builder who‚Äôs terrible at marketing. My video ads looked like PowerPoint presentations from 2005.

So, I built an agent to do it for me. It‚Äôs an AI Art Director that generates short, professional video ads.

Here‚Äôs how it works: I built an automation on Chase Agents that acts as the ""director.""
1.  The user gives it a simple prompt (""a cozy ad for a new coffee brand"").
2.  The agent uses **NanoBanana** to generate a stunning base image that captures the vibe.
3.  Then, the agent hands that image and a new set of instructions to **VEO3**, which animates it into a short, dynamic video ad.

The agent is the brain; the models are the highly-skilled hands. I productized this workflow.

**The raw numbers from my first 30 days:**
*   **MRR:** ~$0 (Yes, I'm crushing it. The API costs are a rounding error when you‚Äôre making this much bank.)
*   **Stack:** A single, powerful Chase Agents automation. That's it.
*   **Marketing:** A few honest posts on Reddit.

**What I learned (the hard way):**
1.  **Your first users are not who you think.** I built this for myself. My first users were small agencies using it for client mockups.
2.  **Churn is a monster.** People generate the videos they need and vanish. I'm now desperately trying to figure out how to build stickiness.
3.  **The ""product"" is the workflow.** The value isn't the AI models themselves, but the seamless orchestration between them.

1olwtr2,https://i.redd.it/trnzzmd37pyf1.jpeg,Breville Bambino Plus for 124.99 $ USD,"Hi everyone,

I'm completely new to the espresso world. I've been a tea drinker my entire life and honestly didn‚Äôt even know the basics of espresso until recently. But over the last few months, I‚Äôve been trying coffee at different caf√©s and I‚Äôm slowly starting to enjoy coffee more than tea.

This sparked an interest in learning how to make coffee at home. Since I‚Äôm a beginner and on a limited budget, I initially looked into entry-level espresso machines‚Äîespecially the Casabrew models in the $100‚Äì$120 range‚Äîjust to learn the basics. To be honest, I‚Äôve never made any type of coffee myself before.

Surprisingly, the Best Buy near me refreshed their Breville display lineup, and all their display units went on open-box sale. During my visit, I came across a Breville Bambino Plus display model that had never been used. It was labeled as ‚ÄúFair‚Äù condition for $124.99, mainly because the following accessories were missing:

1-cup Single-Wall Filter Basket

2-cup Single-Wall Filter Basket

1-cup Dual-Wall Filter Basket

Cleaning Disc

Cleaning Tablets

Descaling Powder


All other accessories were included and unused. I purchased it for $124.99 and also added a 2-year Geek Squad warranty for $20.

Was this a good deal considering the condition?

I‚Äôd also like guidance on the following:

1. Where can I buy the missing accessories?


2. Are the cleaning-related accessories mandatory? ( I mean do we need them immediately? )


3. Should I stick with Breville-branded accessories or are there good alternative brands for replacements?



Note: I know espresso is best with freshly ground coffee, but a grinder isn‚Äôt in my budget for at least the next 6 months. I plan to start with pre-ground Lavazza espresso. I‚Äôve heard that dual-wall baskets work better with pre-ground coffee, and I usually prefer 2-cup shots.

My plan is to first buy the cleaning disc and cleaning tablets, and then purchase the 2-cup single-wall basket later.

Any recommended brands for the 2-cup single-wall basket and affordable cleaning tablets? )

I'm completely new to the espresso world. I've been a tea drinker my entire life and honestly didn‚Äôt even know the basics of espresso until recently. But over the last few months, I‚Äôve been trying coffee at different caf√©s and I‚Äôm slowly starting to enjoy coffee more than tea.

This sparked an interest in learning how to make coffee at home. Since I‚Äôm a beginner and on a limited budget, I initially looked into entry-level espresso machines‚Äîespecially the Casabrew models in the $100‚Äì$120 range‚Äîjust to learn the basics. To be honest, I‚Äôve never made any type of coffee myself before.

Surprisingly, the Best Buy near me refreshed their Breville display lineup, and all their display units went on open-box sale. During my visit, I came across a Breville Bambino Plus display model that had never been used. It was labeled as ‚ÄúFair‚Äù condition for $124.99, mainly because the following accessories were missing:

1-cup Single-Wall Filter Basket

2-cup Single-Wall Filter Basket

1-cup Dual-Wall Filter Basket

Cleaning Disc

Cleaning Tablets

Descaling Powder


All other accessories were included and unused. I purchased it for $124.99 and also added a 2-year Geek Squad warranty for $20.

Was this a good deal considering the condition?

I‚Äôd also like guidance on the following:

1. Where can I buy the missing accessories?


2. Are the cleaning-related accessories mandatory? ( I mean do we need them immediately? )


3. Should I stick with Breville-branded accessories or are there good alternative brands for replacements?



Note: I know espresso is best with freshly ground coffee, but a grinder isn‚Äôt in my budget for at least the next 6 months. I plan to start with pre-ground Lavazza espresso. I‚Äôve heard that dual-wall baskets work better with pre-ground coffee, and I usually prefer 2-cup shots.

My plan is to first buy the cleaning disc and cleaning tablets, and then purchase the 2-cup single-wall basket later.

Any recommended brands for the 2-cup single-wall basket and affordable cleaning tablets? )

My house is quite small and I was on a budget, so I had to keep the guest list to 20 people max (I only invited my closest friends and their partners). 

My best friend (*25F*), let's call her ***Liz***, had *history* with two of the male guests. One of them, lets call him ***John***, kissed her when we were in highschool and she hated him since (from what i remember, they went out for coffee and he made the unwanted physical advance), the other one, let's call him ***Ray***, was in love with her a couple years ago but she didn't reciprocate and they stopped talking. In addition to that, another one of my guests, let's call them ***Blake***, was one of her best friends until a while ago Liz decided to stop talking to them and get them out of her life, not because of anything in particular, she just felt they grew appart. When I told Liz I was gonna throw a party, I sent her a tentative guest list with most of the people who were attending, but I didn't add John, Ray and a couple more of my friends, not to hide anything from Liz, but because they hadn't confirmed their attendance. I didn't think much of it until the day of the party. Guests began to arrive and I came down the stairs to greet them, since I heard Liz get there, I was expecting to see her, but she wasn't there. I had ordered a few pizzas and my delivery driver was outside so I came out, Liz was outside my house, talking with her companion, she looked at me and said ""Why is he here? (John)"" and I said I had invited him, but since he didn't confirm I thought he wasn't going, she hugged me and told me she loved me ""too much"". For most of the party, things seemed perfectly fine, Ray and Blake got there a little later but she didn't seem to be bothered by them, she spend the whole party with her companion, holding hands, talking. It was getting late and since it was a sunday night a lot of the guests had to go, they had school or work the nex day, Liz and her companion got up their seats and told me they had to get going, Liz and I hugged, she told me she loved me and I said I loved her too. As soon as they left, all of the remaining guests asked what the hell was her problem, they sasked me if she was mad and I said I didn't know. They told me she didn't even greet them or engaged in conversation the whole time she was there, I said she was probably upset about John, Ray or maybe even Blake, but that it was a party with all my friends, and I wanted them there...

  
She hasn't replied to my texts or dms, but I know she's active on social media since she keeps posting stories, she hasn't blocked me, she hasn't told me we need to talk.

1olwq8b,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1olwq8b/ive_finally_ended_it_after_8_months_of_emotional/,I‚Äôve finally ended it after 8 months of emotional torture,"Hi everyone, I‚Äôd really appreciate it if you could take the time to read this. This story has been heavy on me for months. I finally cut off someone who broke me piece by piece, and writing this feels like my last step to let go. I know some of you will say I should‚Äôve left a long time ago, but it‚Äôs not that easy when you‚Äôre emotionally trapped.

From the start, he said everything I wanted to hear that he loved me, that we‚Äôd get married, that I was his only one, his peace, his priority, the one he‚Äôd do anything for. He‚Äôd call me 50 or 60 times if I didn‚Äôt answer, text me nonstop, and say he couldn‚Äôt go a day without hearing my voice. Even during important meetings, he‚Äôd hide in the bathroom just to FaceTime me for a few minutes that‚Äôs how obsessed he was.

But when it came to actually seeing me in real life, he never showed up. Every single date had an excuse: ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sick,‚Äù ‚ÄúI‚Äôm tired,‚Äù ‚Äúsomething came up.‚Äù And then he‚Äôd go to dinner or back to work the same night. I‚Äôd get dressed, look beautiful, wait for him, and end up crying in bed. When I told him how hurt I was, he‚Äôd turn everything around say I was crazy, dramatic, that I didn‚Äôt respect myself, that I needed to stop the ‚Äúdrama‚Äù and get back with him.

Still, I stayed, because each time he‚Äôd come back saying he loved me and would change. And when he wanted to, he could act so loving and gentle.

He‚Äôs rich, powerful with drivers and everything. He could‚Äôve come to me anytime but I think he liked seeing me wait. It gave him control. Yet he couldn‚Äôt go even one day without talking to me. If I pulled away, he‚Äôd spam my phone, insult me, and tell me I was the reason he acted that way and that he would say anything to piss me off because I treat him as a dog

Today was the day I finally woke up. We had planned a date after he convinced me for 3 days He promised he‚Äôd call his driver to come pick me up. I trusted him again. I got ready  wore a dress and heels, looked stunning. And it‚Äôs not me saying it everyone who sees me says I‚Äôm beautiful, even strangers. Even him even when he was angry, he‚Äôd still say I was ‚Äúextremely beautiful.‚Äù

When he didn‚Äôt call, I decided to drive myself to his house because I wanted to see what excuse he‚Äôd come up with this time.

He came downstairs looking miserable dirty t-shirt with holes, coffee stains all over, flip-flops, smelling like coffee and sweat. And the first thing he said to me, while looking me up and down, was:

‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs this dress and heels? Are you going into a ball?‚Äù

For the first time, I didn‚Äôt even feel angry. I just saw how pathetic he looked next to me. I take care of myself that day I looked radiant. He‚Äôs short, overweight, unkempt and I never judged him for his looks. I chose him because I thought he had a good heart.

Then he said, ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre nothing.‚Äùyou‚Äôre not impressing me Then He tried to sit inside my car and said, ‚ÄúMove your dirty bag and your dirty glasses, I don‚Äôt want to touch them,‚Äù and kicked them with his leg. It was my car, my own car and he acted like he owned it. Then he said, ‚ÄúThese glasses are fake as fuck.‚Äù My bag was designer, my glasses were real. He just wanted to humiliate me.

Then he said, ‚ÄúI treat you like my employee,‚Äù even though I never asked for or accepted a single penny from him. I‚Äôve always paid for myself. He‚Äôs never given me anything, and still treated me like I was beneath him.

In the past, he‚Äôs told me to ‚Äúshut up,‚Äù ‚Äústop opening your dirty mouth,‚Äù and once when I was stressed and got my period twice in one month, he said, ‚ÄúYou‚Äôll never have kids.‚Äù That‚Äôs when I realized he wanted to break me down and make me feel worthless because deep down, he felt that way about himself.

When I told him today, ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs just say goodbye, we‚Äôre done,‚Äù he looked at me and said:

‚ÄúOkay, I have 2‚Äì3 girls waiting. I‚Äôm gonna fuck a bit since I didn‚Äôt fuck you.‚Äù

He said that word for word. I just stared at him. I didn‚Äôt even cry this time. He‚Äôs always told me he says cruel things just to piss me off, but it only shows who he really is.

I blocked him ‚Äî but he‚Äôs been calling me from unknown numbers. He even said, ‚ÄúGod will make you pay for the pain you caused me.‚Äù When in reality, I was the one crying every single night for months.

He always told me he couldn‚Äôt go a day without talking to me, that he‚Äôd go crazy if I disappeared. This time, I know he will but I finally won‚Äôt.

I chose him for his heart, not for his money or his looks. And I lost so much of myself trying to heal someone who only wanted power, not love.

And the worst part after hurting me in the worst ways possible and I stay silent I tell him I‚Äôm going home he tells me look people are looking at you because you‚Äôre crazy you have no shame stop this drama and close your mouth and let‚Äôs be actually together and work on it

1olwp0h,https://www.youtube.com/@VitalSips7Ds?sub_confirmation=1,From magical drinks to losing weight and immune-boosting blends to focus-sharpening tonics,"**What is ‚ö°Chia Spark+?**

‚ö°Chia Spark+ is a refreshing, \*functional drink\* designed as both a ritual and a science-backed, metabolically active drink to help you **lose weight and fight laziness**. Built on just four simple ingredients: (1) chia seeds (soaked), (2) grapefruit juice (you can alternate as of your choice), (3) a pinch of pink salt, and (4) sparkling water. This combination combines hydration, metabolism support, and sustained energy into one fizzy, uplifting sip. Unlike \*heavy energy drinks\* or crash-inducing \*coffee\*, Chia Spark+ is light, natural, and ritual-ready, making it easy to integrate into daily life.

**How and Why it Works?**

The magic of ‚ö°Chia Spark+ lies in the synergy of its ingredients:

* **Chia seeds** absorb water and form a gel-like texture, slowing digestion, promoting satiety, and keeping you hydrated longer.
* **Grapefruit juice** provides vitamin C and natural compounds that support metabolism and fat oxidation, while adding a tangy, refreshing flavor.
* **Pink salt** replenishes electrolytes, helping maintain stamina and preventing the sluggishness that comes from dehydration.
* **Sparkling water** delivers effervescence that stimulates the senses, creating a psychological cue of alertness and energy.

Together, these elements create a drink that not only **reduces cravings and supports weight loss goals** but also **delivers steady stamina** to push through lazy moments without the crash.

**What to Avoid While Using ‚ö°Chia Spark+?**

* **Overconsumption of chia seeds**: Too much can cause digestive discomfort; stick to 1‚Äì2 teaspoons per serving.
* **High sugar additions**: Avoid sweeteners or syrups that undermine the weight‚Äëloss benefits.
* **Excessive intake**: One or two servings a day is sufficient; balance it with a healthy diet and hydration from plain water.
* **Medical considerations**: If you‚Äôre on medication (especially for blood pressure or blood sugar), consult a professional before making it a daily ritual, since grapefruit can interact with certain drugs.

‚ö°Chia Spark+ is more than a drink ‚Äî it‚Äôs a **ritual of energy, clarity, and discipline**, designed to help you stay light, focused, and unstoppable.

From this void, a fledgling consciousness emerged‚Äîa fragment of chaotic potential without form, name, or purpose.Over endless time, this void[born consciousness developed a distinct ego, naming itself Beruem. It wasn‚Äôt created by gods or wills; it simply became‚Äîalone in the void, self[aware and unsatisfied.With no physical body, Beruem extended its presence by forging Ultimate Skills‚Äîbeginning with Tartarus,God of Nothingness (devouring souls, collapsing voids, creating infinite prisons)‚Äîa means to influence, collect, and assert dominion.Following in the footsteps of Veldanava‚Äôs virtues‚Äîand inspired by Twilight‚Äôs greed fragmenting‚ÄîBeruem created Heavenly Sins series skills, embedding shards of his consciousness within each. These fragments communicate back to him, forming a vast, evolving network.Beruem‚Äôs skills reflect a transcendental journey-from void to A Peusdo-True Dragon, from scattered fragments to a unified identity reshaping reality. There‚Äôs no divine creator above him‚Äîhe is both origin and orchestrator.

1olwh21,https://www.reddit.com/r/autism/comments/1olwh21/i_suspect_having_asd_and_adhd/,I suspect having ASD and ADHD,"I (31M) went to a psychiatrist two weeks ago, my psychologist sent me after concluding the same suspicions I had (without telling her) I told her a big list of behaviors, my history of life, the history of how I had depression and anxiety. She concluded I might have ADHD or ASD based on her experience with child, but the psychiatrist concluded that I didn't qualify for the proof cause I have a career and I'm married (recently married but me having meltdowns for problems in my marriage is reason I went to the psychologist).

I had the same list but this psychiatrist didn't even leaft me show her the list because it wasn't printed. I felt very intimidated by her, I got very nervous and forgot to tell her about the behaviors I can easily remember. After finishing the meeting she asked me how I felt about not qualifying for the test and I said OK, but at the next morning I woke up feeling bad, sad, frustrated, disappointed. Also the tests are expensive but this meeting just made me feel very bad, and I have a week and a half thinking of me being just exaggerated or dramatic.

I just wanted to know if my concerns are valid.

Here is the list, apologize my English, my first language is Spanish. Also used Google translate for the list:


I like to repeat certain sounds I hear (wolves, dogs, cats, roosters, hens, turkeys, goats, sheep, horses, pigs, sirens, etc.), and whenever I associate a word with a song, I sing it.
I'm forgetful and lose things very often: keys, cell phone, wallet, work documents, and other items.
I have trouble starting activities, and I remember that I have to do them, but I don't do them and I just jump from one activity to another at home.
I've had hearing problems since I was a child. I hear well, but I often can't quite make out some words, and sometimes I fill in conversations with what I think was said based on the context and the sound I hear.

I need time to process emotions in the moment... and I don't know how to explain them when they arise. I don't miss my family or friends, and I forget to contact them.
Sometimes I'm reluctant to change my mind, even if it's for the best and I know it's better, but it feels frustrating inside, like finding a place closer when I had already planned another one.
In very emotional moments, I tend to have a song on repeat.
Slightly increased sensitivity in my skin and to smells.
Sometimes it takes me a few seconds to reply.
I usually feel more mentally active after 11 pm; I'm described as a night owl, but that doesn't mean I don't feel tired, although sometimes it passes if I don't fall asleep at that time.
When I'm told to do something I'm already doing, I get angry.
I really like to go unnoticed in places where I know I'll be noticed.
I tend to hold my breath if I know someone will walk by quickly so I don't smell them.
I ate a sandwich and a smoothie daily for a decade.
I'm a picky eater.
I used to hold in my urine. until I finish what I'm doing so as not to lose concentration or postpone it.
I can concentrate so much on something that I lose track of time, hunger, sleepiness, and the urge to use the bathroom, and I don't hear if someone is speaking to me or I get irritated if I'm interrupted.
I was addicted to video games; I could play from dawn till dusk for months without eating or going to the bathroom. I also used marijuana, drank alcohol, was promiscuous, and suffered from anxiety and depression.
I don't like strangers or acquaintances touching me or invading my personal space; only family and friends, and only when I want them to.
Every time I see a spider, bee, or wasp, I get scared even if I know it won't hurt much or cause harm, and sometimes I sweat or leave quickly.
I have trouble understanding sarcasm instantly, but I analyze the context and the contradiction of the message and understand the humor.
I get nervous and stutter. I often have trouble finding the words during a conversation, and sometimes I lightly hit my head out of frustration.
I'm good at finding patterns.
I am Meticulous
I can't describe myself in words most of the time, even though I've read a lot.
I have several collections.
I become quite knowledgeable when a topic interests me, but I get bored quickly and drop it.
People consider me stubborn.
I seem childish.
I'm naive; my friends and family easily deceive me.
I find it hard to lie. I can't stand being in noisy places for very long. I feel awkward at social gatherings with acquaintances and family, even if I know them, except if it's my own party.
Conversing with older people isn't always easy for me; I don't always know what to talk about.
Sometimes I struggle to know when to speak in a group conversation. I learned to socialize in my 20s with people who don't share my interests.
I tend to interrupt conversations when I feel like I'm going to forget something.
I know how to be extroverted, but it leaves me mentally exhausted, and if I'm serious, I feel relaxed.
When my personal space is cleaned and my things are moved, I feel anxious.
I'm very curious.
I like to get absorbed watching animals and understanding their behavior; it's very satisfying.
I tend to be very expressive.
I'm clumsy with my body.
There was a time in first grade when I would skip class and wander around aimlessly.
I don't have favorite foods because I eat them so much that they disgust me. I often have problems with overeating, although I learned to limit myself more four years ago.
I still ruminate on ideas for several days after things I've said or things that have happened to me.
I like to think and find explanations for things; I jump from idea to idea.
I often have imaginary conversations about hypothetical situations.
When I can't concentrate or pay attention, I need to do something: move my leg, eat seeds or whatever, draw, play with something.
I get passionate about certain topics and I'm very expressive.
After social interaction, I feel tired. I usually get impatient while eating and get up from the table and walk around for a while, thinking about something interesting and chewing my food (since I was a child).
I have to wear socks to sleep.
I need a heavy blanket to sleep even if I sweat.
I can't wear rings, bracelets, or necklaces; they make me feel uncomfortable.
In extremely stressful emotional situations, I think about suicide.
Every time I take a deep breath and want to feel relaxed, I let out a wolf howl.
I tend to be overconfident and am often late.
I can tell when the shower water is hot by the sound of it.
I clean my hands every time I touch something sticky or wet in the kitchen while I'm cooking, even if I get dirty afterward.
In certain work situations, like instructions with implicit information, I struggle to understand and make decisions. They're simple instructions that others seem to understand, but I feel like I'm drowning in a glass of water.
I avoid drinking coffee alone because it makes me very nervous.  I had difficulty learning to drive and relaxing while driving for over a year, and even after learning to relax while driving, I had momenta where I got lost in my thoughts and got really mad with other drivers.

Btw, a fed this list to the different AI and concluded the same, I feel doing this like throwing a bottle in the sea.",0,1762024833.0,autism,2,0.5,False
1olwf6j,https://www.reddit.com/r/McKinsey_BCG_Bain/comments/1olwf6j/how_to_actually_become_a_partner_a_nobs_guide/,How to actually become a Partner (a no-bs guide),"I originally found out about this subreddit after I was alerted by a candidate I interviewed that someone leaked their interview question with my firm on here (bold move... I hope those of you who leak recall you agreed not to do that). Anyway, after perusing through here, I am disappointed with the quality of advice - especially as it relates to how to become a Partner.

Folks with offers come here and ask how to be a Partner. Unfortunately, this sub is full of misinformation with the exception of a few comments... It's clear half the people in this subreddit pontificating about what it takes to be a Partner have never even worked at MBB. Can't believe I am going to take a stab at writing this but here goes nothing. I have actually achieved what many of you say you want to achieve.

**Myth-busting:**

1. **STOP AIMING for Partner.**¬†You do not know what the job entails and the odds are you will not make it. Moreover, everyone I started with who said they were going to be a Partner is no longer with my firm yet I still am.
2. **I completely disagree**¬†with the advice people say about being incessant about coffee chats. That's how you piss people off. I can't speak for other MBB but at my firm, you will just piss me and other Partners off if you email us asking for a coffee chat. We will pretend to be nice and recommend you set them up but they will lead to nothing.

I will no show or use that slot for feedback / problem solving time with my other teams. When people talk about networking, they don't mean kiss people's ass. Yes, maybe it looks like that from the entry level perspective but I choose to sponsor people who are rockstars with their toolkit. I want someone who I can trust to deliver the project for me seamlessly.

**Okay so what does it actually take... how do you actually perform well?**

**Step 1:**¬†For your first 6 months, do nothing except toolkit. toolkit. toolkit. I don't give a hoot what all the gurus on here say or your buddy who's only been at your firm for a couple years says. The only thing that matters is¬†**YOUR TOOLKIT.**¬†Become a scientist and study your managers' and Partners' decks rigorously. Ask yourself:

A. How did they make the message so crisp in this page?

B. How did they simplify the page?

C. How did the client react? ALWAYS THINK ABOUT HOW YOUR AUDIENCE WILL REACT TO A PAGE.

Keep a notebook of how to perform on the job. I did this when I first started fresh out of college and meticulously jotted down leadership observations, feedback from clients / my teams. I spent hours on the weekend doing Excel practice by myself and trying to get as fast at Powerpoint as humanly possible.

I did debate in high school so verbal communication always came easily to me but if it doesn't, join a Toastmasters!

You need to transform yourself into a rockstar that can make slides / do analysis at a lightning fast pace, uncover deep third-order insights, and communicate in a clear, simple manner. If you are unable to do this, you're doomed. Do not worry about client hands at this stage. As long as you're not a socially awkward weirdo, you'll be fine.

At this stage, don't worry about politics or managing up. It's incredibly stupid. Just ensure that you are working to be¬†**visible**. Easy way to do this is to ask your manager to let you speak up and explain your analysis during problem solving sessions with Partners. I will pressure test your assumptions and messages and I want YOU to have a 2-way conversation with me. That's how I can guage whether you actually know what you're doing. Remember, every problem solving session is a golden exposure opportunity. Do not waste them. Ensure you're speaking.

You should also practice thinking 3 steps ahead and practice full ownership. If a Partner needs to review a deck, you should view it as YOUR RESPONSIBILITY to get them to review. A Partner is scaterred across several projects, proposals, internal firm initiatives, and constantly getting added to random calls to fight fires. It's stressful and most Partners will simply not review many random decks you send without reminders. So send multiple text reminders to your Partners to review the content you send. That's part of ownership - not just emailing the deck on time (consulting is a weird environment).

Don't ask your manager questions like ""What should I do?"" Instead, say, ""I'm thinking about doing X, what do you think?"" Doing this repeatedly will allow you to become calibrated as your manager will course correct you and you'll start to develop your own intuition about what X should be.

**Step 2:**¬†Once you have become a master of the craft as it relates to page-making, excel analysis, and verbal communication, it's now time to build your network. If you completed step 1 properly, you're a rockstar who I can trust on my teams. You should have developed a positive reputation for performance. Remember, every project in consulting has a limited budget internally and you cost a certain amount (cost goes up each year). If you're too expensive and your toolkit isn't aligned with your cost, you're not getting staffed.

So now leverage your positive network to do the work you want to do. Let's say a hot topic like sustainability. You can:

A. Listen to the charlatans on this sub and do 100 cold emails to people in that practice, get ghosted, and end up with nothing.

B. You blow me away on my unrelated project and then I as a Partner email Partners doing sustainability work and say ""Jane is incredible! Fantastic outputs and top-down communications. Would highly recommend staffing here.""

Which approach do you think will be more effective? Hint... Option B is the correct answer. This is why toolkit is most important. Not anything else. Your toolkit enables you to build a network to get people to sponsor you.

Sponsorship is when someone believes in you so much¬†**BECAUSE OF YOUR PERFORMANCE**¬†because having you staffed makes their projects run so smoothly. As a result, they will create opportunities for you. So overperform for people repeatedly and show loyalty by constantly helping them with proposals and their projects. In return, they'll create opportunities for you. Rinse and repeat with several folks and boom, you have a network. Notice how nowhere in this did I ever say cold email randos and beg on coffee chats?

Now, get more strategic with your network by intentionally working with folks who do work you're interested in. Soon, you'll start to become known within a practice by all the Partners a stellar performer who they can rely on.

Start doing firm building things for your practice like building knowledge assets to help others. This is a great opportunity to collaborate with Partners in your practice and impress them so you become further known.

**Step 3:**¬†Okay by now, you have mastered the toolkit. You then used your performance to get sponsors. You then focused your sponsors to be a coterie of people within a practice. And now you're known in that practice as a stellar performer. It's time for you to start thinking about building a ""calling card"" of sorts. What is a hot topic that'll give runway for projects that you're going to be the go to person at your firm for? Think about it. Start to intentionally choose projects that address this topic so you can build knowledge.

**Step 4:**¬†By now, you have stellar toolkit, sponsors, and are known in a practice + have some ideas of a ""calling card."" It's time to make it to Manager! If you did all the prior steps, you'll be fine and get the manager role no problem.

I can keep going forward with how to progress from here but I'll leave it at this for now. Realize most of you saying you want to be a Partner will statistically not get beyond manager (some of you won't even get that far). It is a high bar.

**Disclaimer:**¬†The advice above applies to my firm specifically but most of its general principles should apply across MBB.

**P.S.**¬†Please don't be a weirdo when you start and tell your start class / leadership you want to be a Partner. I cringe everytime I hear it. Now if you were a senior manager or an associate partner saying that? Different story.

But it's analagous to being a high school student and saying you want to work at MBB. You come off as a weirdo. You will have no friends and your social life at your firm will suck. Come off as a chill person even if you're a hardo. Clients and colleagues alike prefer chill vibes person who will still deliver incredible outputs.

Lmk if you have questions in the comments. If people found this informative, I can make it a series on what it takes beyond manager or how to succeed in reviews or anything.

To remedy the situation, my grandma and I offered to clean her car for free, getting the stains out and everything, she still said at the end with no thank you to any of us, that shes still getting her car detailed, and shes giving me the bill of $150, which I paid almost immediately after she asked.

‚ÄºÔ∏èI KNOW I MIGHT HAVE MISSED SOME SO FEEL FREE TO LEAVE THEM IN THE COMMENTS SO I CAN ADD THEM‚ÄºÔ∏è",2,1762024130.0,kpoppers,3,1.0,False
1olw6jc,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1olw6jc/the_man_at_the_end_of_the_path/,The Man At The End Of The Path,"I used to think the city had rules. Little, invisible rules ‚Äî where sidewalks turned into alleys, where streetlights came every hundred feet, where the hum of traffic became a blanket you could pull over your ears. I believed those rules kept chaos at a distance.

I learned the truth the hard way.  


My route was simple: out the front door, left along Hawthorne, two blocks to the riverwalk, around the old boathouse, up past the warehouses, and home. It was a half-hour loop. A route so memorized it was almost muscle memory. I liked walking alone at night because it cleared my head. The office would be a mold of fluorescent light the next day and the walk was permission to be something else for a little while.

The first few months I did this, I hardly noticed anyone else. There were the usual figures ‚Äî the lonely man in the blue jacket who always fed pigeons at the corner, the couple who argued in low voices and then held hands like nothing had happened. Once a week a delivery truck idled by the warehouse and a driver would smoke a cigarette like a ritual. Familiarity made me complacent in small, useful ways; familiarity made the city comfortable.

The first night I noticed him it didn‚Äôt feel like a notice so much as a shift in the air, a sliding of a stage curtain that made everything else look different.

He stood at the far end of the path near the water, where the river curved and the lights thinned. My first thought was practical: a fisherman, a late jogger catching his breath. He was a shadow more than a person at that point ‚Äî a dark outline against a darker background. But even from forty meters away I noticed two things: his posture was wrong, and he was looking straight at me.

It wasn‚Äôt a casual glance. The kind of look that says you are an object to be measured. It put the hair on my arms up. I looked away because that‚Äôs what you do in a city ‚Äî ignore people. I told myself to keep walking. I did not.

I kept walking because after ten minutes you want to finish the route, you want the quiet house again, you want to pretend nothing unusual ever happened. But I found my pace slowed. I found myself counting the lamps between me and the boathouse. Three lampposts. Two. One. The man did not move. He stood like a punctuation mark at the very end of the path.

By the time I reached the old concrete bench I realized he was still there, exactly where I‚Äôd left him. And then he smiled.

Not a polite smile. Not a city smile. It was small and private, like someone holding a secret between teeth. That was the moment my stomach went cold. Not because of the smile itself ‚Äî people smile for terrible reasons all the time ‚Äî but because there was a current to his smile. It was earned, rehearsed, like a fisherman who knows the exact knot to tie to catch a certain type of fish.

I kept walking. I pretended I was late. I told myself he would be gone when I turned the corner. He was not.

The next few nights became exercises in small horrors. He was there at the end of the path again and again, and each time I saw him his smile had the same lean precision. Sometimes he would be farther away, sometimes closer. Sometimes he would be leaning against the railing, looking at the river. Once he cupped his hands to his mouth and whistled a single, short note. It sounded like a question mark.

I started to change the route. The shortest path felt contaminated. I took alleys with thicker light. I walked with my phone between my fingers even though the battery was almost always dying. I stopped looking at the water; the river had become a possibility rather than a place. But discomfort is patient. It waits.

A week in, I found the first sign that it wasn‚Äôt just me interpreting harmless quirks as threat. My neighbor, a woman named Emily on the third floor, asked if I had seen ‚Äúthat guy by the boathouse.‚Äù Her voice had a strange, brittle edge I‚Äôd never heard from her. She described him the way you describe a bruise: ‚ÄúI saw him last Tuesday. He stood there for an hour like something fixed in place. I thought maybe he was sleeping at first but when I crossed the bridge he looked up and smiled at me. It was like‚Äîlike he already knew I believed something about him.‚Äù

She stopped speaking as if words had become dangerous when pronounced aloud. We both knew we were using the same word without saying it: wrong.

We started to notice things that weren‚Äôt smiles. A discarded glove near the bridge. A shoe on the other side of the path facing toward the city, not the water. A mark on a lamppost ‚Äî two parallel scratches that looked like a shorthand scribble. None of these were threats on their own. A glove could belong to anyone. But collected like bones on a table, they composed an uneven sentence.

I began carrying pepper spray, which made me feel more adult than brave. Emily started walking earlier. She began to leave a light on the balcony each night, and would sometimes shout a little to prove to herself she wasn‚Äôt alone.

It‚Äôs important to tell you the timeline here because fear grows like a plant in drainage: gradually, then suddenly. For three weeks nothing else happened. The man stayed. We avoided him. The city kept being the city. Then, on a Tuesday with rain, the pattern broke.

I was late: the office had spilled into overtime, and the sky had darkened into a slow, grey wash. I took the riverwalk because the other roads were clogged. The rain had thinned everyone‚Äôs numbers. He stood knee-deep in shadow near the boathouse and when he saw me approach he lifted a hand, palm outward as if waving hello. His smile matched the motion ‚Äî small, internal, private ‚Äî but his eyes were different. They were too bright, like lanterns seen through fog.

I felt foolish for being afraid in the face of a human gesture, and then he called my name.

He said it with a precision that implied he had been practicing this favor for a long time. ‚ÄúDavid.‚Äù My name. Not a nickname. Not the safer, less particular form. He said my name the way someone says the last line of a poem.

My breath snagged. I hadn‚Äôt told anyone I had a name I went by after college. I hadn‚Äôt told people at the office. The fact that he said it like it was a private code made every rule I had about privacy and safety crumble a little.

‚ÄúDavid,‚Äù he said again, softer. ‚ÄúYou always take the riverwalk.‚Äù

The reasonable thing to do would have been to turn and go. To sprint, to call our building security, to do any of the dozens of ordinary things a person does when a stranger knows their name. Instead I found myself walking toward him, as though the city‚Äôs small rules were a string I kept tugging on to see how it would behave.

Up close he looked like someone assembled from parts of other people. A face whose features were vaguely familiar but never quite right ‚Äî a nose the precise width you‚Äôd expect from a suit, a jaw that suggested he was used to smiling for the camera rather than for people. He smelled faintly of gasoline and something cleaner ‚Äî ammonia, or bleach, like he had been carrying different fabrics. His clothes were ordinary: a dark jacket, jeans. No bag, nothing that suggested where he had been.

He smiled. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre late tonight,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúYou can‚Äôt be late forever.‚Äù

I laughed, but it came out small. ‚ÄúDo I know you?‚Äù

He shrugged in a careful, slow way. ‚ÄúYou already do. We all do.‚Äù His eyes were too steady. ‚ÄúI like this path,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs honest.‚Äù

I told myself then ‚Äî because the brain likes scaffolding ‚Äî that he probably worked nearby and was lonely, or had been on some long, aimless walk. I told myself he might be strange but harmless. I told myself that‚Äôs what people always say in the story before it becomes something else. I said those lines out loud like talismans.

He tilted his head in a manner that suggested gratitude. ‚ÄúIf you walk later you will see more,‚Äù he said.

I asked him what he meant. He cupped his hand and pointed at the dark water. ‚ÄúWhere the light ends is a place for little things to be forgotten,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúIf you know how to look at them, you can make them belong again.‚Äù His smile sharpened then, like the closing of a camera iris.

I felt the hair on my arms rise. There are certain metaphors that are fine in books‚Ä¶and metaphors poisonous in conversation. This was one of them. I told myself I was being dramatic. I told myself it was raining and every strange thing looks like a story in the rain. I walked home with a sense that I had passed through a narrow doorway.

That night I did not sleep well. I dreamed of riverbanks with small piles of shoes, of miles of abandoned umbrellas standing like soldiers. I dreamed of the man at the boathouse walking with a cart and setting things down with reverence, arranging them like offerings.

Three days later Emily knocked on my door at eight in the morning. She looked like someone who had been scraping frost from glass and had found a live thing under the ice. Her hands trembled. She had two paper bags ‚Äî one with coffee, one with something wrapped in tissue.

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know what to do,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúI found it on the path.‚Äù

I took the tissue carefully. Inside was a small, battered cassette tape, the plastic case clouded with fine scratches. There was a handwritten label: *For later*. Stupid, useless handwriting. My first thought was nostalgia ‚Äî there was an old mixtape culture, a private economy of tapes and notes. But then I saw the corners. They were damp. The tape smelled faintly of river and rust.

We debated whether to open it. There‚Äôs a dangerous grammar to curiosity ‚Äî the way it pronounces possibility in your head like a lit fuse. In the end we popped it into my old boombox because two people who have lived on the same path learn to use each other as resistors. We pressed play.

Silence, at first. Then a soft voice, male, very close to the microphone. A small pause. A breath. Then the sound of the river, very close and suddenly enormous in the recording, as if the tape had captured not a river but an ocean. Low static. Then the voice returned, again the same softness.

‚ÄúYou found it,‚Äù the voice said. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre the one I think of. Keep walking when the lamps go out.‚Äù

A laugh, gentler than a chuckle. ‚ÄúThey stop seeing each other when the city gets quiet,‚Äù the voice went on. ‚ÄúLittle things collect. If you know how to place them right‚Äî‚Äù There was a sound like paper folding, the careful slide of something being arranged on cloth. ‚Äú‚Äîyou can put them back where they belong. Keep the path honest.‚Äù

At the end of the cassette a sound roared ‚Äî a small, animal sound and then something like a metal object scraping along a long rail. It was abruptly cut.

We sat in silence for a long minute. The tape was wrong in a hundred small ways. The voice on the tape was him. The cadence. The private, practiced smile in his words. We listened to that line again about keeping the path honest until it made our mouths feel like something sour.

We brought the tape to the police. They were kind but corporate, used to indignation and less used to the sediment of private fear. They wrote a report, gave me a number. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôll check the area,‚Äù the officer said. He had the look of someone who wants to be helpful while also protecting his time. We gave them the tape. Two days later, we received a call that their patrols had found nothing. No items, no evidence, no man.

The city is sometimes a sieve ‚Äî it filters what it wants to keep and discards the rest. The police believed the physical realm; the physical realm gave them nothing. So we were left with an uncanny object and the feeling of a sentence left incomplete. It did what uncanny objects do best: it made a place into a story, and then made the story personal.

The nights changed after that. The boathouse hummed with a sensitivity. People started to remove their jackets more quickly. The couple who argued stopped emerging for midnight walks. An old man who used to sleep on a bench started feeding his birds earlier, as if the light at midnight had become unreliable. The city rearranged itself around the memory of the tape.

One night, a week after the police call, I saw him kneeling by the lamp post near the third bridge. He had a crate of things with him‚Äî small, deliberate objects wrapped in cloth. When he saw me he didn‚Äôt stand. He lifted his face and there was blood along the corner of his mouth like somebody had used his teeth as a tool. It was the first time he looked unpracticed.

‚ÄúDavid,‚Äù he said softly.

I tried to keep calm. ‚ÄúWhat are you doing with those things?‚Äù I asked.

He put a gloved finger to his lips. ‚ÄúShh,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt have to know the name of everything you see. You only need to know they are placed.‚Äù

It was childish and diplomatic and absolutely insane. He had a method. He had the grace of a tidy ritual. He set one of the wrapped objects on the base of the lamp, then another on the bench, then a row of small things along the railing. Each placement was like a punctuation mark.

Then he stood. He walked toward me with the careful, measured gait of someone performing an exercise. When he was a few feet away he reached into his jacket and pulled out a small photograph. It was old and faded. On it, in a faint sepia, was a child with a bright hat beside a woman whose face had been scratched away, as if someone had taken a pencil and drawn lines through the features. The edges of the photograph had been browned with water.

‚ÄúI used to forget faces sometimes,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs a terrible ache to that. The city forgets what it doesn‚Äôt want and then pretends things never existed. I make things belong.‚Äù

I felt something ‚Äî not quite rage, not quite pity, something like being spoken to by a strange weather. ‚ÄúWhat does that mean?‚Äù I asked.

He smiled. ‚ÄúIf something is misplaced you can put it back. If a face is erased you can set a photograph near the place where it should be and the world will remember it again for a while.‚Äù

I should have walked away. I should have run. Instead I took the photograph, curious the way people are curious at the foot of a cliff, and I looked at the place where the woman‚Äôs face had been scraped away. The paper was rough as a wound. For a moment‚Äîjust a flicker‚ÄîI thought I saw the ghost of a face in the scratches, a map of what had been removed. It wasn‚Äôt a face I knew, but the idea of it made me dizzy.

He reached out and with one finger tapped the photograph, like striking a bell. ‚ÄúPlace it at the bridge,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúTonight. Place it where the light falls least.‚Äù

There are moments in life when the rational world hands you a fork with impossible prongs. Most people take the safe path: they put the fork down. They choose the comfortable option and they sleep. Some people, however, choose out of exhaustion or perverse curiosity. That night I chose.

Partly it was the tape. Partly it was the photograph that looked like an accusation. Mostly it was a tired stubbornness that comes from living in a city that teaches you to negotiate with small discomforts until they become tolerances.

I wrapped the photograph back up, placed it in my jacket pocket, and after midnight I walked down to the bridge. The lamps were fewer than usual ‚Äî some were flickering, some stubbornly dead. At the place the man had pointed to, the light pooled in the cracked buckle of a concrete seam. I set the photograph on the seam like someone tucking a note into a hymnbook.

I stood for a long time after placing it. The river made a sound like a soft argument. The photograph trembled in the wind and then lay still. A dog barked in the distance. I felt the city tightening like a hinge.

I went home and slept a little. It felt like a mistake even as my eyelids closed.

The next day the photograph was gone. Not stolen, not carried away ‚Äî simply not there. The seam was empty, as if whatever had been placed there had never existed. My stomach dropped. I walked to the police station because that‚Äôs what you do when you have done a ridiculous thing your better judgment already knew was foolish. They pretended to listen. Paper was filed. Hands were wrung. An officer offered me tea.

Two more photographs disappeared from the city in the following week. An old glove, carefully folded and placed on a windowsill at dusk, vanished by morning. A single child‚Äôs shoe appeared on a rooftop and then was not there when the sun rose. People began to speak about small things in new, reverent tones ‚Äî the way you speak about a shrine. A whisper climbed through the neighborhood: he is making them belong again.

But the word that slipped closest to the truth, the word that fewer people used because it tasted like a throat that had closed, was this: replacement.

Replacement is an ugly verb. To replace is to take one thing and put another in its place. You can replace a bulb. You can replace a lock. You can‚Äôt replace a person. Or at least you can‚Äôt in any ethical vocabulary that matters. We began to suspect the man was not simply keeping memory ‚Äî he was assembling it differently.

The city has many inhabitants who will not punish imagination. The man, whatever he was, was one of those beings. He had found a way to manufacture a story until the story became more persuasive than the truth.

People eventually stopped walking after dark. The cafes closed earlier. The warehouses across the river taped flyers that read *Do not leave objects unattended* and *If you see something, call*. The man‚Äôs appearances became less frequent and therefore more notable ‚Äî like an eclipse you notice even though it is small.

One night, months in, I confronted him.

I found him under the bridge, where the cold collects and the light is merciless. He had a cart then, a small hand-cart, piled with things wrapped in gray cloth. He looked larger in the weak light, as if the absence of brightness made his outline more meaningful. He watched me approach with the same mild attentiveness, like a merchant considering a customer.

‚ÄúYou can‚Äôt keep doing this,‚Äù I said.

He looked at me like someone acknowledging an old acquaintance. ‚ÄúWhy not?‚Äù he asked.

‚ÄúBecause it‚Äôs not‚Äî‚Äù I started, then stopped. Words are often inadequate when the thing they name is monstrous. ‚ÄúBecause people are missing,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúThings disappear. Faces are ruined. You can‚Äôt‚Äî‚Äù

He put a hand on the cart, soft and certain. ‚ÄúI put them where they belong,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúSome things cannot live with the way they were arranged. They hate their position. They stay wrong. I set them.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou set them?‚Äù I repeated.

He tapped the cart lightly. ‚ÄúWe all make mistakes with placement. A child lost here, a photograph misplaced there. The world forgets because no one takes the time to place things neatly. I place them so they will be seen.‚Äù

The thing he said next is the thing I remember like a pressure in my throat. He said it without drama, with the tone of someone talking about cooking. ‚ÄúDo you want to see what happens when you don‚Äôt?‚Äù

The cart hummed open like a lid. He reached into a bundle and unwrapped a thing tenderly. It was a small cloth doll, one of those homemade things with button eyes. But its face had been removed, the stitches torn like someone had unpicked a seam. Where its face should be there was a small, dark aperture, the inside like a throat.

He smiled then, and his smile looked almost like the one from the first night but older, as if it had collected seasons. ‚ÄúWhen something is wrong, they make noise,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúThey gnaw until the city notices. I quiet them.‚Äù

There is a cruelty that is mechanical; there is another cruelty that is accidental. The man seemed to practice both. For the first time since noticing him, I felt something like anger. I shoveled it up inside me.

‚ÄúYou arrested someone for this?‚Äù he asked, amused. ‚ÄúFor making them belong?‚Äù

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know what you are,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúBut you have to stop.‚Äù

He looked genuinely surprised. ‚ÄúOh,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúStop? Who would I answer to? The city?‚Äù

He waved at the water like a man waving at a river. ‚ÄúDo you know what is harder than placing things?‚Äù he asked. ‚ÄúLetting them rot where they will be forgotten. That‚Äôs worse.‚Äù He put the doll back in the cart with a tenderness that made my skin crawl.

After that night, the city refused to be easy. A woman two blocks over reported waking to the sound of something scraping at her window at three in the morning. A local bar posted a photograph of a missing man on its board. The man with the cart was seen less and less in public, and more often on the roofs, at the margins, delivering his small packages like an itinerant priest.

And then, finally, something happened that changed the shape of our fear from unease into a concrete, cold dread. Emily did not come back from her run.

She left at dawn, like she always did, with a playlist in her ears, and a pair of earbuds tucked in when she crossed the bridge. She was due back in forty minutes for coffee at the corner store. Her phone went straight to voicemail. Her key was still in the apartment door. The police found her headphones near the lamppost; her watch was under the bench. No sign of a struggle. No blood. Only an emptiness that seemed to spread like spilled water.

For a week the city emptied of small pleasures. People called in to work. Flowers lay at the bridge and were gone by the morning. Someone chalked a heart near the boathouse and then it was smeared away. At the funeral the priest said words about fate and the cruelty of random things.

I went to the bridge at night after the funeral because that‚Äôs what people do when grief becomes an instruction manual. There was a fresh photograph on the seam where I had first placed my photograph months before. It was a photograph of Emily ‚Äî one I recognized from a party where she had worn a yellow dress. But her face had been carefully, deliberately removed with that same blunt tool. It was worse than the missing photo before because this one had had life and laughter and then it had been erased. The city had done a justice I could not accept. The photograph was placed there like an accusation.

I understood then with the sort of slow horror that loosens your knees: he was not just placing things. He was choosing spaces where people left themselves vulnerable.

People will tell you that monsters have lairs. Sometimes they do. But sometimes monsters prefer transit: they live in the spaces between things, the cracks and seams where the city forgets to look. You can‚Äôt necessarily storm a lair; you have to change the path.

I decided to go back to how it began: the routine. I laced my shoes as though I was preparing for a chess endgame. I padded out in the hour where the city holds its breath. I took no phone. I left all talismans at home. I wanted to feel the risk in my hands like a physical object.

At the riverbend he stood as usual, face in shadow. He looked up as I approached and then smiled like an old acquaintance. I could feel the air tighten around him. He had something in his hand ‚Äî a wrapped bundle. It might have been a photograph, a toy, something indescribable. He placed it on the seam of the bridge like a man setting down a tiny altar.

‚ÄúYou do this because you think it is mercy,‚Äù I said.

He cocked his head, genuinely interested. ‚ÄúMercy?‚Äù he echoed.

‚ÄúYes. Mercy.‚Äù

He made a small sound that could have been a laugh or a sigh. ‚ÄúYou think my work is mercy?‚Äù he asked. ‚ÄúPeople forget. They make mistakes. I fix it.‚Äù

‚ÄúFix it by taking them.‚Äù The word was a rock dropped into the river, and I felt the splash.

He looked at me for a long moment and then, calmly, as if reciting a final instruction, he said: ‚ÄúPeople replace what they cannot hold. They make space for what matters. If someone must be thin for others to hold space, they become thin. The city always asks a price.‚Äù

There was no lightning. There was no theatrical event. The man folded his hands and waited like a teacher. I think at some point you realize the world doesn‚Äôt operate on climaxes. It operates on small, steady cruelty‚Äîon schedules and habits.

He reached into his jacket and produced a tiny photograph peeking from the cloth. He offered it like a man offering you the truth of a coin.

‚ÄúWould you like to place it?‚Äù he asked.

I looked at the photograph. It was a child‚Äôs face, the mouth open in a laugh. I thought of Emily‚Äôs photograph, the missing face. I thought of the cassette and the cart. I thought of every small thing misplaced on our path. I felt a pressure to choose.

I closed my fist around the photograph. I dropped it into the river instead.

It made no sound that I could hear. The current took it and a soft eddy replaced the place it had been. The man watched the photograph disappear and the smallest part of the smile on his face shifted, like a clock hand twitching.

‚ÄúYou can‚Äôt make them belong by throwing them away,‚Äù he said finally.

‚ÄúNo.‚Äù I answered. ‚ÄúBut I can refuse to be the one to place them.‚Äù

His eyes widened for just an instant as if there had been a possibility he had not calculated. Then he laughed softly, a sound like thin ice cracking. ‚ÄúRefusal is a kind of choice,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúIt will not always be enough.‚Äù

I don‚Äôt know if what I did changed anything. People still left photographs and gloves near the bridge from time to time. The man was seen less often, but sightings continued on nights when the lamps stuttered like tired fireflies. Sometimes a pedestrian would find a small object placed gently by the railing ‚Äî a coin, a toy ‚Äî and for a day they felt less alone. Other times whole families felt the nameless absence of someone who had gone out and never returned.

Some nights I still walk the path because the city has a way of demanding that you live with the small unanswerable things. There are quiet hours when I think I see him in a doorway across the river, a dark shape that isn‚Äôt quite a person. I never spoke to him again. I suppose that decision‚Äîmy refusal‚Äîwas my own small statement. It felt like honesty.

People will tell you the practical steps: report, get security, move, call the police. Do them. They are not misplaced. But also remember this: a city can collect a story and hold it like a lantern. The story will glow depending on how many people choose to look at it. If we stop looking, it disappears. If we look too closely, sometimes it bakes and hardens into something we cannot easily change.

The worst thing about my story is not the man with the cart. It‚Äôs the way ordinary nights learned a new grammar ‚Äî a grammar that asks you to place things, or watch them be placed, or refuse to place them at all.

So if you walk by a river alone at night, and you come to the place where the light thins and the lamps forget their numbers, don‚Äôt be tempted to collect what‚Äôs been left. Don‚Äôt place anything unless your hands know the difference between mercy and substitution. Walk across and never look back.

But if you must look back ‚Äî if your curiosity is the sort that tugs at the hem of your resolve ‚Äî do it at a distance and with your fingers around your coat, like a person who has learned that sometimes the city will whisper your name and mean more than it says.",3,1762024118.0,nosleep,0,1.0,False

Now I know it‚Äôs the click of a microphone that never stops recording.

It started three weeks ago, when the subreddit r/TrueWhispers went dark. No posts. No comments. Just a single pinned thread titled ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre still here. Are you?‚Äù with 4,127 upvotes and zero replies. I was a lurker, always had been. I‚Äôd scroll at 3 a.m., headphones in, hunting for the kind of audio that made your skin crawl‚ÄîEVP recordings, abandoned asylum walk-throughs, the usual. But r/TrueWhispers was different. They didn‚Äôt post files. They posted instructions.

Rule 1: Only listen alone.
Rule 2: Never speak back.
Rule 3: If you hear your name, close the tab. Do not hesitate.

The final post was a 47-second .ogg file. The thumbnail was black. 

The title: ‚ÄúFor the ones who stayed.‚Äù I downloaded it out of habit. Curiosity is a hell of a drug.

That night, I plugged in my noise-canceling cans, dimmed the lights, and hit play.

At first‚Äînothing. Just the low hum of my own pulse. Then a voice, soft as breath on glass:
‚ÄúYou‚Äôre late.‚Äù

I yanked the headphones off. My room was empty. The file was paused at 0:03. I laughed it off‚Äîsomeone pranked the sub, layered a whisper under the silence. I put the cans back on.

‚ÄúDon‚Äôt stop now. We‚Äôve been waiting.‚Äù

The voice was mine. Not similar. Mine. The exact timbre, the slight rasp from too much coffee. I checked the metadata. Uploaded by u/echo_epsilon. Account created today. Zero posts. Zero comments.

I should‚Äôve deleted it. Instead, I replied in the thread:

u/4_digit_iq: anyone else hear their own voice?

No response. The thread was gone. The entire subreddit‚Äîgone. 404 like it never existed. But the file was still on my desktop, icon pulsing like a heartbeat.

I played it again. This time, the voice said my full name. The one I never use online. The one on my birth certificate.

I unplugged my mic. Smashed it with a hammer. Didn‚Äôt matter. The next morning, my phone buzzed with a notification from an app 
I‚Äôd never downloaded: WhisperBack. Icon: a black circle with a white mouth.

I opened it.

Incoming call from: You (47 seconds ago)

I didn‚Äôt answer. The voicemail transcribed itself: ‚ÄúYou broke Rule 2. We‚Äôre coming through the static now. Count the clicks.‚Äù

That afternoon, every device in my apartment started clicking. The smart fridge. The TV. My car‚Äôs Bluetooth. One click per second, perfectly synced. I ripped out batteries, cut power cords. The clicks kept coming‚Äîfrom inside the walls.

I drove to the library, used a public computer. Searched my username. Found a new subreddit: r/LastListener. One post. My post. The .ogg file, re-uploaded. 12,004 upvotes. The top comment:

u/echo_epsilon: He‚Äôs almost ready. Don‚Äôt let him speak.

I haven‚Äôt slept in four days. The clicks are louder now, layered under everything‚Äîmy heartbeat, the rain, the hum of the streetlight outside. Last night, I caught my reflection in the blackout screen of my monitor. My mouth was moving. No sound came out, but the subtitles appeared at the bottom:

‚ÄúThank you for staying. Press record.‚Äù

I‚Äôm typing this with one hand. The other is holding a knife to my throat. If I speak, they win. If I don‚Äôt post this, no one will know.

The file just auto-played. It‚Äôs 47 seconds of my own screaming‚Äîexcept I haven‚Äôt screamed yet.

The cursor‚Äôs blinking. It wants me to hit submit.

I hear them breathing through the speakers. They sound just like me.

Don‚Äôt download the file.

Don‚Äôt read the rules.

I‚Äôve bootstrapped a startup, taught tech to thousands, and now split my time between campus case discussions, weightroom therapy, and discovering new filter coffee spots. My happy weekends are bookstores, board games, indie films, street food, and long walks where the conversation wanders further than we do. Values: empathy over ego, growth over gossip, craft over clout.

Seeking: an intellectually curious woman (21+), emotionally literate, open to slow-burn connection. Someone who lights up at a great question, a surprising insight, or a beautifully argued essay. Bonus if you enjoy museums, flea markets, quizzes, midnight desserts, or debating whether cities should be designed for cars or children.

What we can do: chai and a stroll through a bookshop; swap our top five life-changing reads; co-create a tiny fun project; or simply sit on a quiet bench and talk about the thing you can‚Äôt stop thinking about this week‚Äîeconomics, cinema, sport, design, psychology, poetry, cricket, F1‚Äîyour pick.

Boundaries: strictly SFW; safety first; no pressure to escalate; consent is culture; kindness is non-negotiable.

If any of this resonates, send a thoughtful opener: your city, a recent idea that shook you, and a niche hill you‚Äôd die on. I‚Äôll go first‚Äîmine change often, but right now: ‚ÄúSpeed is a habit; depth is a practice.‚Äù I reply best to messages with curiosity, clarity, and a little wonder.

1olvy10,https://i.redd.it/ilb7rqm20pyf1.png,I have a... complicated relationship with coffee. So I built an iOS app to model my cortisol rhythm,"Like many of you, I'm pretty sure my blood type is ""espresso."" I love coffee. The problem is, I'm also *wildly* sensitive to it. A 3pm latte could have me staring at the ceiling at 2am, wondering where I went wrong.

I tried a bunch of caffeine trackers, but they all just told me my *total milligrams*, which didn't really help. I wanted to know:

1. Why do I still crash at 2pm even after two coffees?
2. *Exactly* when will this 3pm drink be out of my system so I can actually sleep?

This sent me down a massive rabbit hole into chronobiology, caffeine half-life, and cortisol.

The big ""aha!"" moment was learning about the Cortisol Awakening Response (CAR). Turns out, most of us drink our first coffee when our body's natural energy hormone (cortisol) is *already at its absolute peak*. This blunts the caffeine's effect and all but guarantees a hard crash later.

So, being a dev, I built the tool I wished I had.

It's called **Mindful Coffee**. It‚Äôs an iOS app that models your caffeine decay curve on top of your body's natural cortisol rhythm.

The main chart shows your day with a simple color-coded legend: ""Best"" (your cortisol is low, caffeine will be most effective), ""OK,"" and ""Avoid"" (if you want to sleep tonight).

It's been my personal tool for a while, built 100% natively with SwiftUI, SwiftData, and HealthKit (and all the modeling is 100% on-device for privacy). I finally put it on the App Store.

As a community that truly gets the ""scratch your own itch"" journey, I'd genuinely love to know what you think. Is this a problem anyone else has, or am I just a one-man, caffeine-anxious focus group?

Any feedback on the concept or the UI is super appreciated.

I've been drinking a lot of tea and coffee lately, too. I'm trying to see what the best tea and coffee out there. Coffee, I recently tried grinding beans, and it really does make a huge difference. I bought a house recently and been turning it into a homestead.

I love learning new things/hobbies. I'm really into houseplants and aquarium keeping. I have over 100 different houseplants. I just got a small greenhouse now, too. I have a whole room dedicated to the fish and tortoises. I have an outside enclosure i built them for the summer. I also have one cat and one dog too.

I'm into video games, too. I mainly play Marvel Rivals, Valorant, Overwatch, Palworl,  and Ark ASA. Just bought Dinkum, too. I built a PC to play on a couple of years ago.

I'm down to chat about any random stuff you like to chat about. Love learning about people or hobbies they enjoy",1,1762023212.0,MakeNewFriendsHere,1,1.0,False
1olvo6a,https://www.reddit.com/r/nespresso/comments/1olvo6a/nespresso_vs_coffee_shops_analysis_of_savings/,"Nespresso vs Coffee Shops, Analysis of Savings","A few weeks ago, I decided to do an analysis of how much I've saved going to the Nespresso OL line, where I now enjoy probably about 75% of my coffee-based drinks vs the 12 months prior, which was a mix of places like Starbucks, as well as local coffee chains such as Alfred, La Colombe, Philz, Blue Bottle, and the like (Los Angeles area).

This certainly is not scientific or exact, since my wife also uses the Nespresso, but was never much of a coffee person who would frequently visit coffee shops, except for the occasional visit with me. So in a way, our overall coffee consumption has increased as a result of the switch.

Anyhow, I got my Creatista Plus back in early 2023. So this analysis is further imperfect due to inflation, but I am basically considering the 12 month period prior to obtaining our Nespresso machine, covering March 2022 - Feb 2023, vs the most recently ended 12 month period, October 2024 - September 2025.

This analysis was made possible by the fact that I keep detailed financial records using Quicken software (yea, I know) as well as online purchase history available via Amazon & Nespresso.

Anyhow, I found it interesting enough to share, So here are my findings:

**COFFEE SHOP VISITS Mar 2022 - Feb 2023 - total spent: $1,904**. This is across 289 visits (transactions) for an average of $6.59 per transaction. This is, admittedly, not accurate since there is also going to be the occasionally enjoyed croissant or whatever other food item purchased along with my coffee drink. About 30% of the transactions at Starbucks, while the rest were spread out among a total of 13 different coffee spots.

**NESPRESSO PURCHASES Oct 2024 - Sept 2025 - total spent: $289.25**. This is across 10 orders, taken from [Nespresso.com](http://Nespresso.com) and a few Amazon orders. It also does not include costs  of milk (which typically I do a latte or cappuccino in the morning + espresso shot after lunch). It also includes a breakfast / bday party we hosted where I probably used 50-60 pods in a single day. Lastly, I also still visited various coffee shops a total of 72 times in the past 12 months, where I spent a total of $438.48 ($6.09/avg per visit), again I am sure some of that was food/pastries

Regardless, even taking into consideration the numerous variables I cant isolate for, its clear the savings is significant. I also very much like the convenience.

End of the day, this thing is one of the best investments I've made! I've also set a goal for myself in 2026 to cut down coffee shop visits to like 2x a month and review in a year from now and see what the results look like.",11,1762022884.0,nespresso,9,0.92,False

I‚Äôve had a few rejections, but my ‚Äúsuccess rate‚Äù for getting a number is around 60-70%, which sounds impressive until you realize it‚Äôs followed by a 50-80% ghost rate. Every single one of those interactions felt genuine: shared laughs, curiosity, good energy. I only asked when it felt mutual. I usually text them right after the event or the next morning, thanking for the good time 

Last night I met someone at a Halloween party. We talked for about half an hour, ended up among the last people there, and I offered her a ride home. She‚Äôs new to the area and seemed genuinely excited when we talked about places to explore. The night ended with a hug and a lot of laughter and we agreed to coordinate to meet next weekend.

For context, there‚Äôs one woman I met at an event and we‚Äôre planning our fourth date. Her interest seems to be fading, but I still count it as a win. It‚Äôs no different from online dating.

1olvng5,https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueAnon/comments/1olvng5/a_little_more_grapesposting/,A little more Grapesposting,"CHAPTER 25

THE SPRING IS BEAUTIFUL in California. Valleys in which the fruit blossoms are fragrant pink and white waters in a shallow sea. Then the first tendrils of the grapes swelling from the old gnarled vines, cascade down to cover the trunks. The full green hills are round and soft as breasts. And on the level vegetable lands are the mile-long rows of pale green lettuce and the spindly little cauliflowers, the gray-green unearthly artichoke plants. 

And then the leaves break out on the trees, and the petals drop from the fruit trees and carpet the earth with pink and white. The centers of the blossoms swell and grow and color: cherries and apples, peaches and pears, figs which close the flower in the fruit. All California quickens with produce, and the fruit grows heavy, and the limbs bend gradually under the fruit so that little crutches must be placed under them to support the weight. 

Behind the fruitfulness are men of understanding and knowledge, and skill, men who experiment with seed, endlessly developing the techniques for greater crops of plants whose roots will resist the million enemies of the earth: the molds, the insects, the rusts, the blights. These men work carefully and endlessly to perfect the seed, the roots. And there are the men of chemistry who spray the trees against pests, who sulphur the grapes, who cut out disease and rots, mildews and sicknesses. Doctors of preventive medicine, men at the borders who look for fruit flies, for Japanese beetle, men who quarantine the sick trees and root them out and burn them, men of knowledge. The men who graft the young trees, the little vines, are the cleverest of all, for theirs is a surgeon's job, as tender and delicate; and these men must have surgeons' hands and surgeons' hearts to slit the bark, to place the grafts, to bind the wounds and cover them from the air. These are great men.

Along the rows, the cultivators move, tearing the spring grass and turning it under to make a fertile earth, breaking the ground to hold the water up near the surface, ridging the ground in little pools for the irrigation, destroying the weed roots that may drink the water away from the trees.

And all the time the fruit swells and the flowers break out in long clusters on the vines. And in the growing year the warmth grows and the leaves turn dark green. The prunes lengthen like little green bird's eggs, and the limbs sag down against the crutches under the weight. And the hard little pears take shape, and the beginning of the fuzz comes out on the peaches. Grape blossoms shed their tiny petals and the hard little beads become green buttons, and the buttons grow heavy. The men who work in the fields, the owners of the little orchards, watch and calculate. The year is heavy with produce. And the men are proud, for of their knowledge they can make the year heavy. They have transformed the world with their knowledge. The short, lean wheat has been made big and productive. Little sour apples have grown large and sweet, and that old grape that grew among the trees and fed the birds its tiny fruit has mothered a thousand varieties, red and black, green and pale pink, purple and yellow; and each variety with its own flavor. The men who work in the experimental farms have made new fruits: nectarines and forty kinds of plums, walnuts with paper shells. And always they work, selecting, grafting, changing, driving themselves, driving the earth to produce.

 And first the cherries ripen. Cent and a half a pound. Hell, we can't pick 'em for that. Black cherries and red cherries, full and sweet, and the birds eat half of each cherry and the yellowjackets buzz into the holes the birds made. And on the ground the seeds drop and dry with black shreds hanging from them. The purple prunes soften and sweeten. My God, we can't pick them and dry and sulphur them. We can't pay wages, no matter what wages. And the purple prunes carpet the ground. And first the skins wrinkle a little and swarms of flies come to feast, and the valley is filled with the odor of sweet decay. The meat turns dark and the crop shrivels on the ground.

And the pears grow yellow and soft. Five dollars a ton. Five dollars for forty fiftypound boxes; trees pruned and sprayed, orchards cultivated‚Äîpick the fruit, put it in boxes, load the trucks, deliver the fruit to the cannery‚Äîforty boxes for five dollars. We can't do it. And the yellow fruit falls heavily to the ground and splashes on the ground. The yellowjackets dig into the soft meat, and there is a smell of ferment and rot. Then the grapes‚Äîwe can't make good wine. People can't buy good wine. Rip the grapes from the vines, good grapes, rotten grapes, wasp-stung grapes. Press stems, press dirt and rot. But there's mildew and formic acid in the vats. Add sulphur and tannic acid.

  
The smell from the ferment is not the rich odor of wine, but the smell of decay and chemicals. Oh, well. It has alcohol in it, anyway. They can get drunk. The little farmers watched debt creep up on them like the tide. They sprayed the trees and sold no crop, they pruned and grafted and could not pick the crop. 

And the men of knowledge have worked, have considered, and the fruit is rotting on the ground, and the decaying mash in the wine vat is poisoning the air. And taste the wine‚Äîno grape flavor at all, just sulphur and tannic acid and alcohol. This little orchard will be a part of a great holding next year, for the debt will have choked the owner. This vineyard will belong to the bank. Only the great owners can survive, for they own the canneries, too. And four pears peeled and cut in half, cooked and canned, still cost fifteen cents. And the canned pears do not spoil. They will last for years. The decay spreads over the State, and the sweet smell is a great sorrow on the land. Men who can graft the trees and make the seed fertile and big can find no way to let the hungry people eat their produce. Men who have created new fruits in the world cannot create a system whereby their fruits may be eaten. And the failure hangs over the State like a great sorrow. 

The works of the roots of the vines, of the trees, must be destroyed to keep up the price, and this is the saddest, bitterest thing of all. Carloads of oranges dumped on the ground. The people came for miles to take the fruit, but this could not be. How would they buy oranges at twenty cents a dozen if they could drive out and pick them up? And men with hoses squirt kerosene on the oranges, and they are angry at the crime, angry at the people who have come to take the fruit. A million people hungry, needing the fruit‚Äîand kerosene sprayed over the golden mountains. And the smell of rot fills the country. Burn coffee for fuel in the ships. Burn corn to keep warm, it makes a hot fire. Dump potatoes in the rivers and place guards along the banks to keep the hungry people from fishing them out. Slaughter the pigs and bury them, and let the putrescence drip down into the earth. 

There is a crime here that goes beyond denunciation. There is a sorrow here that weeping cannot symbolize. There is a failure here that topples all our success. The fertile earth, the straight tree rows, the sturdy trunks, and the ripe fruit. And children dying of pellagra must die because a profit cannot be taken from an orange. And coroners must fill in the certificate‚Äîdied of malnutrition‚Äîbecause the food must rot, must be forced to rot. 

The people come with nets to fish for potatoes in the river, and the guards hold them back; they come in rattling cars to get the dumped oranges, but the kerosene is sprayed. And they stand still and watch the potatoes float by, listen to the screaming pigs being killed in a ditch and covered with quick-lime, watch the mountains of oranges slop down to a putrefying ooze; and in the eyes of the people there is the failure; and in the eyes of the hungry there is a growing wrath. In the souls of the people the grapes of wrath are filling and growing heavy, growing heavy for the vintage.

I have a dilemma. My cousin is celebrating her 20th birthday this weekend, on Saturday night. I didn‚Äôt go to her 18th birthday because I was in medical high school and had to study a lot. Looking back, I think I could have gone and still done well.

Now I‚Äôm in medical college ‚Äî the hardest one in the country ‚Äî and it‚Äôs extremely demanding. I‚Äôm in my first year, so I‚Äôm still learning how everything works. I‚Äôve fallen behind on lectures because I was mostly focused on anatomy, but I believe I can catch up if I use my time wisely.

At her birthday, there will probably be alcohol. I like to drink, but if I do, I‚Äôll have to stay overnight and spend all of Sunday recovering, which means I‚Äôd lose the entire weekend. If I go, I‚Äôd only be free for three or four hours on Saturday; if I don‚Äôt, I‚Äôll have the whole day to study.

I thought about going and leaving around 1 or 2 a.m. without drinking, but the party starts at 11 p.m., so being there for only two or three hours doesn‚Äôt seem worth it. Some of my friends say I should go; others say I should focus on my priorities. I agree that I need to stay disciplined ‚Äî I really want to become a doctor, and I‚Äôm stressed and worried about falling behind.

So I was thinking of calling her for coffee before her birthday, maybe bringing a small cake or taking her to dinner, as a way to make up for not going to the party. Do you think it‚Äôs okay if I don‚Äôt go? I‚Äôd feel bad for missing it, but I‚Äôd feel even worse if I failed my exams.",1,1762022661.0,Advice,0,1.0,False

I just think Russillo‚Äôs raison d‚Äôetre, his persona, his vibe, has a very narrow appeal.

#The Son
Enter Yuki Kiriyama, who travels back in time to make his parents smile. 

Yuki is the product of an unhappy marriage. When he was first born, his mother Aoi wanted to go right back to work. However, his father Kenji wanted her to be a stay at home mum. At least until Yuki was three years old.¬†This caused a continuous friction between the couple. When Yuki finally turned three his mother was not as willing to go back to work because of all the responsibilities she had at home. His father as very dismisses of the level of work she did at home when compared with the ‚Äúreal‚Äù work he did for his job. 

Once Christmas Yuki‚Äôs parents decide to take him to Disneyland. The journey itself commences bitterly as Kenji wants Aoi to drive so he can get on with some work, but he proceeds to backseat drive (THE WORST KIND) on the way there. Seeing this bickering, Yuki wishes he could drive in place of his mum so that his parents would be happy. From this, his parents decide to do what they can to ensure Yuki isn‚Äôt upset. They decide to no longer argue and Kenji puts away his laptop.

When they get to Disneyland all the queuing means they only have time for one ride. Fortunately it‚Äôs the one attraction Yuki was most excited for. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a Small World.‚Äù This attraction is home to the urban legend that if you make a wish as the Gondola passes the final gate, your wish will come true. Yuki wants to, and successfully does, wish for his parents to be happy. 

On the journey home, as it Christmas Day, all restaurants are booked up. The family decide to go into Funiculi Funicula for their meal. They get in some drinks and a Christmas cake, enjoying the festivities, when all of a sudden **DONG** the clock strikes 7:30 and this prompts Yuki‚Äôs parents to tell him they are splitting up. Upon hearing the news Yuki cries. 

Later on, Yuki goes to stay with his mother who introduced him to her new boo thang. Upon hearing of this Yuki can‚Äôt help but picture his sad, lonely father. Aoi informs him that part of the reason for their split was they both found new boos. She then lets him know that they‚Äôve decided he‚Äôll live with each of them for 1 month before choosing his forever home. 

In the present, Yuki tells Fumiko of this entire story. He wishes to travel back in time to the day his parents told him of their split because he cried. His inspiration for travelling is the fact that while living separately with both parents, he noticed that they were constantly happy and smiling. A stark contrast to their moods while they were together. He realises that his wish did come true as they are both now happy and he wants to remove any semblance of negativity from their lives by returning to Christmas Day and smiling instead of crying. 

Fumiko doesn‚Äôt seem happy at the idea of a seven year old boy time travelling or drinking coffee, but Kazu has no qualms. She reads Yuki his rights and then pours the coffee for him to go back. When he lands back to that day, Yuki tries to hold his best poker face, when all of a sudden **DONG** the clock strikes 7:30 and his parents ask him why he‚Äôs crying. Turns out he couldn‚Äôt stop himself from crying even though they didn‚Äôt tell him their news this time around. He apologises, downs the coffee and returns to the present. 

Yuki is picked up by his grandfather, Aoi‚Äôs father, Kozo Morita. Fumiko asks Kozo who Yuki is planning to live with but Kozo says Yuki is undecided, and he‚Äôs annoyed at his daughter for putting Yuki in this position. Kozo later returns to the cafe and informs Kazu that Yuki decided to stay with I‚Äôm instead, looking out for both his parents. Kozo also thinks Yuki does it so he won‚Äôt be alone as he lost his wife not too long ago.

Outside of the stories we learn more about the cafe: the drink‚Äôs temperature cannot be altered by anything but time, the nature of the cafe is such that patrons aren‚Äôt impacted by the sudden appearance of someone in *that* seat. Their brain just says ‚Äúhuh‚Äù and moves on. Also Miki is as bright and bubbly as ever. Kazu however, is pretty down in the dumps. 

What a tear-jerker!

#The Nameless Child
Enter Megumi Sakura, who travels back in time with her baby.

Megumi and Riuji Sakura are love‚Äôs young dream. To add to this Megumi becomes pregnant. The couple ponder over knowing the child‚Äôs sex before birth but settle on the decision that it will remain a surprise for Riuji only (he‚Äôs a bit of a Kidult). This also means that they decide naming the child will be done once it‚Äôs born. 

Unfortunately Riuji is the victim to an attack after trying to prevent an attacker on the train, and this happens the day before Megumi gives birth. She decides that she will go back in time, taking her newborn baby with her, to allow Riuji to name and see his baby girl. 

When Megumi relays her story to Fumiko, she once again has apprehensions about the customer‚Äôs time travel. This time around the issue lies in the fact that she would be giving Riuji a glimpse of the life he won‚Äôt be living, and thus informing him that he will die. Megumi decides to go through with her plan, after questioning Nagare on the logistics of time travelling with a baby. Fortunately, the rules do not explicitly state anything about time travelling with another person so as long as she keeps hold of her baby at all times, the two of them will be able to travel. 

When she returns to the past, Riuji immediately figures out she‚Äôs from the future. Being an avid fan of urban legends, it wasn‚Äôt difficult for him. On top of this he deducted that he dies but initially keeps this to himself. Riuji inquires about wether he can be the one to drink the coffee, and receives a subtle nod from Kazu. Megumi is annoyed by this questioning as she sees it as him being a kidult. When they finally get to discussing her reason for travelling she asks him to name their daughter and he immediately responds it‚Äôs ‚ÄúYu.‚Äù He‚Äôd been thinking about a name for the child and had one designated for a boy, Yutaka, which in short hand would be suitable for a girl. 

Megumi had attempted to keep track of time in the cafe but was looking at the wrong clock (the central one which only accounts for time in the present and so had paused upon her travelling back in time). The couple realise they have very little tie, and Riuji gets upset at the reality of the situation. He then hurriedly downs the coffee. Megumi thought he was mad at her for bringing their daughter but it turns out he did it out of love because he knew Megumi wouldn‚Äôt have been able to finish the coffee and leave Riuji alone and upset in the cafe. She has an epiphany that he isn‚Äôt;t so much a ‚Äúkidult‚Äù as he is someone that loves her and so looks out for her best intentions. What she saw a childlike playfulness was Riuji preempting her not being able to finish the drink. 

Outside of the mother and child, we see Miki continuing to be vibrant self, questioning Fumiko on spending so much time in the cafe. We also learn a lot more about the cafe‚Äôs rules - more than one person can travel at a time, anyone can be the one to drink the coffee, patrons can only be cursed once, and can only be cursed if they desire to go back in time. 

If I thought the first one was tear-jerky, this one was tear-biltong‚Ä¶ (I‚Äôll see myself out).

**Short version: these are bite-sized updates on things generally not reported by the local paper, Facebook groups, and other sources of news.**

**If there are specific topics you want to hear about or you wish to give feedback, feel free to send me a message or leave a comment!** 

This month was a little drier in terms of new developments in the Village, but nonetheless, here is what I could scour:

\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Coffee with the Council:**

¬∑¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† According to one of the organizers selected by Cook County for early voting, out of roughly 96 locations in Cook County, Schaumburg‚Äôs Trickster Gallery holds the third largest turnout.

¬∑¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† According to Police Chief Wolf, the Schaumburg Police Departments conducts the highest traffic stops than any other police department in the region, citing 15k-20k traffic stops a year

¬∑¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† A resident from the newly developed 90 North homes asked why there wasn‚Äôt a playground. A trustee responded saying these homes were originally designed with empty nesters in mind. Regardless, the trustee said they would have the Director of Community Development look into it.

**Schaumburg Social Workers**:

¬∑¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Schaumburg Police Human Services now has five full-time social workers. In 2024, they were more integrated into public safety operations, equipped with radios and police dispatch system to allow for quicker on-scene responses. They are now more involved in cases of missing persons and mental health crises. There‚Äôs been a notable increase in calls related to suicidal ideations, homelessness, and other mental health concerns.

¬∑¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† One new member speaks Polish, but they are still needing members fluent in Spanish, Mandarin, Urdu and other languages to meet the community‚Äôs needs.

¬∑¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Follow-up support is always provided for victims.

**390 Gateway Logistics Redevelopment Area**: more details on the redevelopment of the unincorporated parcel (bounded by Frontage Rd, Gary Ave, Metra tracks). The developer is proposing to annex the property into Schaumburg, remove the homes and build two industrial buildings. This area is also eligible for designation as a ‚Äúconservation area‚Äù, but the Redevelopment Plan would like to reduce or eliminate conditions that qualify this area as such in order to proceed with new construction.

**Planning Building and Development:**

¬∑¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† The village employed 85,000 individuals in March 2019. Presently, that number is down to 77,000 on account of the pandemic, but it is slowly increasing again.

¬∑¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† The Village lost five non-chain restaurants but gained seven this year, bringing the total number of non-chain restaurants to 95.

¬∑¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† The number of solar permits increased to 138 residents due to available federal credits/state grants.

¬∑¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Of the inspections done on single-family homes from October 2024 ‚Äì April 2025, there 99 missing handrails at the front entrance stairs, 54 peeling paint on exterior home or shed, and 32 with dead trees

Your approach, results, etc.** I know I‚Äôll be pretty nervous with these, and with only 3 shots at it, want to hopefully nail every cup and be set with a rock solid approach for best results. 

Obviously I could just default to my standard high altitude Panamanian Gesha approach, but for these  would prefer just to copy something that has turned out great cups for these specific beans. 

I have an unofficial spending limit for amazing beans of $30-ish for 50g, or $60 overall. That range, while pricey, still ends up at $10/cup max, which isn‚Äôt too far off what you‚Äôd pay at a shop, about same as a glass of beer out, and cheaper than a glass of wine.

But past that range just seems like too much, even when there are truly amazing beans.

**Until I read that Sey founder Lance Schnorenberg said he thinks this Finca Sophia Gesha lot is the best coffee Sey will sell all year.** Thank you u/theindex-coffee for sharing that, great stuff!

1olvdk2,https://www.reddit.com/r/espresso/comments/1olvdk2/grinder_suggestion_to_complement_df83_v2/,Grinder suggestion to complement DF83 v2,"I am looking for suggestion for a 2nd grinder purchase. My budget is \~$250-300; and I am OK buying a used grinder in that range.

I brew pourover filter coffee \~70% of the time; and milk-based Espresso for the remaining \~30% of the time. Plain/Black Espresso and Americanos are rare for me, perhaps once or twice a year at best.

I roast my own coffee in SR800, and usually prefer light roasted african or central american coffees with acidity and fruitiness. However, I am still learning to roast more consistently, and I often land in light-medium range instead of light range. This should get better as I learn, but for now its safe to assume that I will be drinking coffess in light to medium ranges.

I currently own a DF83 and a Kingrinder K6. I used the K6 for pourover (using Hario Switch), but was not very happy with the cup taste. It produced way more fine and resulted in either very astringent or very sour cups. I could never dial it in well to a taste I prefer. So I decided to experiment and use the DF83 for pourover. I am a lot more happier with the coffee I can brew using DF83 - I can taste the acidity and don't get the astringency at grind settings that are at the upper-end of Moka Pot. However, I still do not get the taste clarity and separation of flavors. That said, it's a cup I still enjoy every day.

The problem now is that for Espresso, my choice is to either switch back and forth (and purge some coffee in between) or use the K6. Given I drink mostly milk-based, the K6 has been fine for taste. The milk pretty much hides all the imperfections to the point where I am OK with the K6 from a taste point of view, but not from workflow. Grinding at Espresso setting on a K6 is, lets just say, a good workout! I prefer an electric grinder instead. I also don't like to switch back-and-forth and waste coffee, and sometimes have to dial-in again as its impossible to get to the same exact setting with stepless grinders.

SO, long story shot, I am now looking to add an extra grinder to my setup. My budget is \~$250, but I am willing to go to $300 if needed.

The choices I see are:

1. **Use DF83 for Espresso, buy a dedicated pourover grinder**. Options here are mostly hand grinders (K-Ultra, ZP6) or mid-end used electric grinders (Ode 2 or Varia VS3). I would love to get a Timemore 078, but realistically it is way out of my budget even as a used grinder.
2. **Use DF83 for pourover, buy a dedicated espresso grinder**. Handgrinders are not an option here due to workflow issues. But I could perhaps settle on a conical burr grinder like Baratza Encore ESP Pro. Later, I could sell the K6 and perhaps buy dedicated DLC brew burrs for the DF83 to improve the flavor separations.

I am looking for suggestions here. What should I go towards - my mind says option (1) since I am not 100% satisfied with the pourover taste; but then I will have to be OK with the hand grinder with pourover (which is less preferred but fine).",1,1762022188.0,espresso,5,1.0,False

On Friday, Oct. 31, the music mogul, 55, was photographed in the yard at the Federal Correctional Institution, Fort Dix, in New‚ÄØJersey. He was transferred to the prison the day before to serve the remainder of his 50-month sentence for federal sex crimes.

On Friday, Oct. 31, the music mogul, 55, was photographed in the yard at the Federal Correctional Institution, Fort Dix, in New‚ÄØJersey. He was transferred to the prison the day before to serve the remainder of his 50-month sentence for federal sex crimes.

In the photo, first obtained by TMZ, Combs is seen wearing a dark blue jacket with a beanie on his head.

He was photographed with a full white beard as he looked out into the distance.

Combs is staying in a dormitory-style unit in the prison, where he is allegedly being fed a much more pared-down menu than he‚Äôs used to.

The prison‚Äôs breakfast menu includes fruit, hot oatmeal and whole wheat bread and jelly, along with a serving of coffee and skim milk, to be served before the sun has fully risen at 6:00 a.m. local time.

For lunch served at around 11 a.m. on Saturday, Nov. 1, Combs is expected to be given a more basic menu that includes chicken fajitas, cilantro rice, black beans, whole kernel corn and a fruit beverage.

That will carry him up until dinner at 4 p.m., when he will be treated with roast beef or lentils, mashed potatoes, mixed veggies with brown gravy, a whole wheat bread, margarine pat and beverage on the side, according to the prison‚Äôs menu.

The new setting is different for Combs, who previously occupied his days with family visits and even orchestrated a six-week ‚ÄúFree Game with Diddy‚Äù business and entrepreneurship class while he was at the Metropolitan Detention Center in Brooklyn (MDC), a spokesperson for the Federal Bureau of Prisons told PEOPLE.

Combs‚Äô legal team requested that the musician be transferred from MDC to the prison Fort Dix in New‚ÄØJersey, a low‚Äësecurity prison that offers the Residential Drug Abuse Program (RDAP). U.S. District Judge Arun Subramanian has recommended that Combs be considered for any available substance‚Äëabuse program.

Last month, the mogul was sentenced to 50 months in prison after being convicted on two counts of transportation to engage in prostitution in July.

His trial in the Southern District of New York resulted in him being acquitted of the most serious charges he faced, including sex trafficking and racketeering, which potentially carried a life in prison sentence if he had been found guilty.

Prosecutors asked at the time that Combs be sentenced to 11 years in prison, claiming in a sentencing memorandum that they believed he was ""unrepentant"" about his actions. However, the musician's defense asked that he receive a sentence no more than 14 months.

His legal team filed a two-page court document on Monday, Oct. 20, intending to appeal his conviction.

According to the Federal Bureau of Prisons, Combs is projected to be released from prison on May‚ÄØ 8,‚ÄØ2028. The release date suggests Combs, who had already served about a year in jail before his October sentencing, could be released a few months early for good behavior, though that date could still change.

Combs has been in prison since he was arrested in Sept. 16, 2024 at a Manhattan hotel.",0,1762022027.0,CasesWeFollow,0,0.5,False
1olvarg,https://www.reddit.com/r/WoneSuiteCommunity/comments/1olvarg/undercharging_by_38_because_my_spreadsheet_forgot/,Under-charging by 38 % because my spreadsheet ‚Äòforgot‚Äô to count revision rounds‚Äîhow we added $11k MRR overnight after one filter.,"You‚Äôre a pro at what you do, but if you're still pricing by gut feel and hopeful agreements, this story is for you.

It was a regular Tuesday. With Coffee in my hand, I was reviewing our P&L when I noticed our flagship client‚Äîthe one we love‚Äîhad a gross margin thinner than a razorblade. We bill them a premium rate, so my brain instantly flagged an error.

I dove in. And I found the culprit: my beautiful, color-coded, ""perfect"" spreadsheet had a silent leak.

It was politely, systematically ""forgetting"" to count revision rounds. Not out of malice, but because it relied on a human (me, three months ago) to manually decide what¬†*felt*¬†billable. The result? 312 client-requested micro-changes, each billed at $0 because the spreadsheet considered them ""included.""

The math hit me like a ton of bricks: 312 hours x $135 =¬†**$42,120**¬†of unbilled effort. My stomach dropped. The emotional cocktail? One part rage, two parts sheer embarrassment. I felt like a fraud. How could I lead a company if I couldn't even track our most basic costs?

But here‚Äôs the pivot from tragedy to strategy. This wasn't a client problem; it was a¬†*system*¬†problem.

We stopped relying on memory and moral dilemmas. Inside¬†**WoneSuite**, we created a simple, non-negotiable rule: any revision after the second round is auto-tagged as ""Phase 2,"" with its own pre-attached hourly rate. No human debate. No ""is this too petty to invoice?"" It just happens, automatically, like gravity.

Then came the hard part: the conversation. I sent what felt like the most vulnerable email of my career:

\*""Hey \[Client\], in the spirit of total transparency, we noticed some scope creep happily tap-dancing through our project hours. To keep everything fair and sustainable, we'll route any additional tweaks beyond the agreed rounds through a bite-sized Phase 2 budget at our standard rate. Sound fair?""\*

I held my breath, waiting for the backlash.

The reply came in eight minutes:

*""Totally fair‚Äîyour team's been superhero-level patient. Just send the estimate over when ready.""*

No pushback. No awkward call. Just a professional partnership working as it should.

The result? Thirty days later, those auto-tracked Phase 2 hours began to roll in. The first invoice was for¬†**$9,840**. The client paid it in three days. By the end of the month, we had added¬†**$11,340 in pure, incremental MRR**.

That‚Äôs¬†**$11,000**¬†we were literally leaving on the table every single month. Money that directly extended our company's runway by 47 days.

In 2025, the conversation around brain optimization has officially moved beyond caffeine and energy drinks. It‚Äôs about **sustainable mental performance**. And that‚Äôs exactly where **LucidFlow by Apex Performance Life** comes in.

Let‚Äôs talk about why this **natural nootropic** is taking the **biohacking** and productivity world by storm ‚Äî especially among Reddit communities that love science, self-improvement, and high performance.

# What Is LucidFlow?

**LucidFlow** is a **cognitive enhancement supplement** developed by[ **Apex Performance Life**](https://apexperformance.life) ‚Äî a performance nutrition company founded by **Michael Cummings** in Palo Alto, CA. The supplement was built for **high-achieving professionals, entrepreneurs, academics, and adult students** who want more out of their day ‚Äî sharper focus, improved memory, and calm, sustained energy.

Unlike typical caffeine-loaded boosters, LucidFlow isn‚Äôt about quick fixes. It‚Äôs a science-driven blend of **10 proven compounds** that work synergistically to optimize your **brain‚Äôs neurotransmitters, stress response, and neuro-adaptive balance**.

In short, it‚Äôs mental fuel for people who want to think clearer, longer, and smarter ‚Äî without the crash.

# The Science Behind the Formula

LucidFlow is not a random mix of herbs and buzzwords. It‚Äôs a formula built on neuroscience and decades of research into **brain function supplements**. Each ingredient is chosen for its role in supporting cognitive longevity, neural repair, and peak performance.

Here‚Äôs the breakdown of what‚Äôs inside ‚Äî and why it matters:

* **Alpha-GPC:** Enhances learning speed and memory by boosting acetylcholine levels.  
* **Citicoline (CDP-Choline):** A powerhouse for brain energy and communication between neurons.  
* **Bacopa Monnieri:** A time-tested adaptogen that improves memory recall and cognitive endurance.  
* **L-Theanine:** Found in green tea, it promotes calm alertness and keeps your mind from racing.  
* **L-Tyrosine:** Supports dopamine and norepinephrine production, helping you handle stress while staying motivated.  
* **DHA (from algae):** Vital omega-3 fatty acid that nourishes brain cells and enhances focus.  
* **Phosphatidylserine:** Supports cognitive flexibility and helps with memory formation.  
* **Lion‚Äôs Mane Mushroom:** Stimulates nerve growth factor (NGF), promoting long-term brain health.  
* **Rhodiola Rosea:** Reduces fatigue and increases mental stamina.  
* **Paraxanthine:** A clean, advanced form of caffeine that offers alertness without anxiety or crashes.  

All ingredients are produced in **FDA-registered, GMP-certified facilities in the U.S.**, with **third-party testing for purity and potency**. No proprietary blends, no shady dosages ‚Äî just transparency.

That alone sets LucidFlow apart from 90% of supplements in the market.

# Designed for People Who Think Differently

LucidFlow was made for a specific tribe ‚Äî people who live and breathe high performance. Whether you‚Äôre an early-stage founder juggling strategy calls, a software engineer deep in code, or a graduate student buried in research papers, mental fatigue is your real enemy.

LucidFlow‚Äôs formula helps you:

* Lock in **deep focus** for hours.  
* Maintain **mental calmness** during high-stress situations.  
* Stay **motivated** and alert without caffeine dependency.  
* Improve **memory recall** and information retention.  
* Enhance **multitasking** capacity without burnout.  

The concept is simple: if your mind is your main tool, it deserves the best possible fuel.

# How to Use LucidFlow in Your Daily Routine

Apex Performance Life intentionally designed LucidFlow to **fit into your existing routine**. There‚Äôs no complicated prep or weird flavor. Each pack dissolves easily into your preferred beverage ‚Äî coffee, tea, juice, or plain water.

Just pour one stick of LucidFlow into your morning drink, and you‚Äôre good to go. The formula has a **neutral taste**, so it doesn‚Äôt mess with your coffee flavor or post-workout smoothie.

**Recommended use:** 5 days per week for optimal neuro-adaptive balance, with 2 days off to reset your natural brain chemistry.

If you‚Äôre already into intermittent fasting, productivity sprints, or bulletproof coffee, LucidFlow slides right into your stack seamlessly.

# The Story Behind Apex Performance Life

The story of LucidFlow starts with its founder, **Michael Cummings** ‚Äî a software designer and lifelong learner who spent decades solving complex digital problems where mental clarity wasn‚Äôt optional.

His inspiration came from his father, **Urban Cummings**, a Stanford engineer who lived an active, vibrant life until age 96. His daily rituals ‚Äî stretching, supplements, swimming, and a relentless curiosity ‚Äî demonstrated how much habits shape long-term vitality.

Michael wanted to build something that captured that same spirit ‚Äî the connection between science, routine, and performance. After years of experimenting with various **natural nootropics**, he realized there wasn‚Äôt a single formula that truly covered every base: focus, calm, clarity, and neuroprotection. So, he built one.

LucidFlow is the result of that lifelong pursuit ‚Äî a brain supplement that feels as natural as it is powerful.

# Radical Transparency in the Supplement Industry

Let‚Äôs be honest ‚Äî the supplement industry is messy. Hidden blends, exaggerated claims, and underdosed ingredients are common. Apex Performance Life is actively pushing back against that culture.

Their mantra? **‚ÄúRadical transparency.‚Äù**

Every ingredient in LucidFlow is clearly listed with full dosages. No ‚Äúproprietary blends.‚Äù No marketing tricks. Just measurable, verifiable science.

LucidFlow is also **third-party lab tested** for purity, ensuring that every scoop delivers what it promises. It‚Äôs the kind of transparency that‚Äôs rare ‚Äî and sorely needed ‚Äî in a market flooded with hype.

# Join the Founder‚Äôs Club

One of the coolest parts of Apex Performance Life‚Äôs mission is their **Founder‚Äôs Club** ‚Äî a community for early supporters, biohackers, and cognitive performance enthusiasts. It‚Äôs not just a newsletter list. Members get access to:

* **Free samples and product testing invitations**  
* **Exclusive founder events and webinars**  
* **Opportunities to contribute ideas** for future formulations  
* **Priority access** to new product launches

I decided to put that to the test and brewed multiple cups throughout the resting period to determine if resting really makes a difference. Spoiler, it does haha. 

This month I was happy to get my hands on Halloween Candy from Black and White coffee roasters.

Immediately after receiving 
As soon as I got the bag I had to smell it‚Ä¶ I mean the name ‚ÄúHalloween Candy‚Äù and tasting notes were just too tempting. Immediately, I‚Äôm hit with a funky, fruity melody of peach rings and sour gummy worms. The coffee actually smelt true to the tasting notes. I was excited. But that excitement was soon about to fade lol.

Grabbed the V60, I went fine, 20 clicks on my commandante which is about 600 microns. 1:15 ratio using a 3 pour method 45 second bloom at 200f water temp. 

Initial sip. Distinctly and very loud peach rings and sour gummy worms at the front of the palette. However that delightful initial taste which I was so excited to experience, was immediately, almost comically drown out by muddy brown bitterness with overtones of almost a minty-like menthol on the backend. It was horrible, like drinking diner coffee at Denny‚Äôs and stirring in a dollop of Colgate hahaha. But thankfully, this is not the end of our story!

Brewed again this time on the other end, course. 30 clicks on commandante around 900 microns, 5 pours, 45 second bloom letting each pour drain all the way through. This time very sour and astringent. Still getting those initial Halloween candy tasting notes but that flavor quickly disappears and is overshadowed with that same bitterness and minty taste. By far the worst tasting out of the two.







1 week resting -
I waited a week and brewed again same away above. This time the Halloween candy notes were present in the cup but not as pronounced and distinct as those first few cups. The cups still had those negative overtones of bitterness and mint, however the minty taste was more muted. The coarser grind was still sour and astringent, still my least favorite method. It seems there is some improvement from resting, but I wasn‚Äôt sure if it was in my head. So I waited another week. 






Two weeks resting -
Wow! Resting really is essential! I will continue to experiment with other processing methods to verify. But I can say with absolute certainty for coferments, rest your coffee! It‚Äôs night and day difference. Had I just tasted those first few cups and thought that was it. I would have never bought that bag. But today it doesn‚Äôt even seem like the same bag! 

Brewed fine, 3 pours as stated above. Peach rings and sour gummy worms at the front of the pallet. The cup was decent, especially when compared to the previous cups however it was a bit hollow and dry on the tongue. The flavor was trying to shine but that sweetness and clarity was still a bit muddy and flat. But amazingly the bitterness was pretty much gone and absolutely zero mint taste. 

Now the 5 pours. The sweetness and clarity I was looking for really started to shine, still wasn‚Äôt quite there but the best tasting so far. The syrupy mouth feel I was looking for was in the cup. But there was a bit too much acid that took away from the fruity sweet notes.

Brought it down to 28 which is about 840 microns. A beautiful symphony of peach rings and sour gummy worms. The peach is most pronounced. A little bit of grape. Bright, sweet, and syrupy. Velvety mouth feel, that nicely lingers on the tough before faintly and slowly disappearing, leaving you eager to enjoy the next sip. The coffee is delicious. No bitterness, No mintiness. Just a sweet fruity and dynamic cup. And most importantly the confirmation that resting is crucial!

‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî


Results-
From what I‚Äôve learned, it appears that the initial taste of unrested coffee has very distinct fruity flavors. I would argue that those flavors are the most intense and distinctive initially, however they cannot be enjoyed because of overwhelming bitterness and other unpleasant flavors which for me appeared as minty overtones. As the coffee rest, the fruity flavors begin to mellow out and are not as intense. They are very clearly still in the cup, just slightly subdued. However more importantly resting seems to remove distracting and unpleasant flavors that rob the joy and sweetness from the cup.

I‚Äôm going to do another post on diving into different pour techniques to see if I can elevate this cup anymore!

From the outside, everything looks fine. Stable job, loving partner, a place to call home.
But lately, I‚Äôve been feeling‚Ä¶ heavy. Like I‚Äôm carrying something invisible all the time. The stress from work, the pressure to keep moving forward, the quiet fear that maybe I‚Äôm just running on autopilot.

There are days when I wake up already tired. My body‚Äôs moving, but my mind feels far away. Sometimes I catch myself spacing out, staring blankly at nothing, wondering what happened to that lighter version of me ‚Äî the one who used to dream, laugh easily, and get excited over small things.
I love my life, truly. But there are moments where the noise in my head gets too loud ‚Äî the anxiety, the burnout, the constant ‚Äúwhat ifs.‚Äù It‚Äôs hard to breathe sometimes.

One night, I was lying in bed scrolling through my phone, too drained to think. I stumbled upon a clip from an old anime I used to love back in college ‚Äî one of those shows I‚Äôd stay up watching, crying over the characters, laughing at their dumb jokes, feeling alive in every episode.
On a whim, I decided to rewatch it. Just for nostalgia. Just to pass the time.

But the moment that familiar opening song started playing, something in me softened. It was like being gently pulled back into a memory ‚Äî a version of me that felt safe, hopeful, alive. The colors, the voices, the emotions‚Ä¶ they wrapped around me like a warm blanket.

For the first time in a while, my chest didn‚Äôt feel so tight.
It was‚Ä¶ peace.
It was comfort.
It was like I had found a tiny light in all the noise.

As I watched, I started remembering the small things that used to make me happy ‚Äî the smell of coffee at night, the sound of rain while watching anime, laughing with friends over silly theories. I realized that somewhere along the way, I had buried those little joys under the weight of adulthood.

And sitting there, rewatching an old show, I felt like I was meeting my old self again. The me who wasn‚Äôt always tired. The me who found meaning in stories, hope in characters, and beauty in the smallest moments.

The world didn‚Äôt change after that, but something in me did. The stress is still there, but it doesn‚Äôt drown me as easily anymore. The anxiety still visits, but I know where to find a bit of calm when it does.

Now, whenever life feels too heavy, I go back to those old anime worlds. They remind me that I‚Äôm still allowed to slow down, to rest, to feel safe. They remind me that I don‚Äôt have to be strong all the time.

It‚Äôs strange, isn‚Äôt it? How a simple show from years ago can quietly heal parts of you that words can‚Äôt.

Maybe I don‚Äôt have everything figured out yet. Maybe I‚Äôm still learning how to breathe again, how to live gently.
But for now‚Ä¶
I have a bit of peace.
And maybe, just maybe ‚Äî that‚Äôs enough.

Currently I am building an app which reminds you everyday to add some positivity to this world.

Simply...

It will give you three tasks every single day...

For ex: Feeding a stray cat, buying coffee to your colleague or watering a plant outside or whatever small act of kindness.

And completing thase tasks every single day will create a streak for you in the app. 

Also it gives you 20 ripples on every task completion. And from collection of these ripples, you can unlock some app themes with some background animations.

Also when you complete a task, you can upload a picture or a video of what you have done to keep it in your memory list with a caption.

Plus you can post that picture or video within the app in the community with like minded people and can see others posts about what ripple effect they have created.

You know that moment ‚Äî the shock, the hop, the involuntary curse, the full-body cringe where nothing else exists but that tiny spot of pain?

Now imagine it happens while you‚Äôre giving a presentation to a packed room.

You‚Äôve got to keep talking, pretending everything‚Äôs fine, while your whole body‚Äôs screaming.

That‚Äôs what it‚Äôs like being one of us ‚Äî the ones who feel deeply.

Honestly, if you gave in and screamed mid-meeting, it would probably be worth it.

Because swallowing pain is worse than letting it out.

But that‚Äôs the kind of restraint people like us live with every day.

When we finally do express what‚Äôs boiling inside, you‚Äôve only seen the tiniest fraction of what‚Äôs been happening behind the scenes.

We‚Äôre the emotional equivalent of someone who doesn‚Äôt flinch when they slam their toe on the coffee table ‚Äî for your comfort.

So the next time you tell us to ‚Äúcalm down,‚Äù picture yourself trying to calm down right after ramming your shin into a metal bed frame.

‚∏ª

How often do you stub your toe or hit your funny bone?

Maybe once a week? Once a month?

We smash our emotional funny bone on the hour.

Sometimes it‚Äôs not even our pain.

It‚Äôs yours. Or someone we love‚Äôs. Or the pain we can see coming from three exits ahead.

It‚Äôs not always bad stuff ‚Äî joy hits big, too.

But whatever it is, it‚Äôs always big.

‚∏ª

I once watched a video about ACEs ‚Äî adverse childhood experiences ‚Äî and it hit me harder than I expected.

High school kid, lighting a cigarette, says: ‚ÄúJust coping with my ACEs.‚Äù

I laughed, but it stuck.

When you‚Äôve carried pain since before you had words for it, ‚Äúcoping‚Äù isn‚Äôt a hobby ‚Äî it‚Äôs a lifelong side quest you never signed up for.

‚∏ª

People love to tell us how to handle our emotions.

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre allowed to feel that way.‚Äù
The fuck I am. As long as I express it quietly, neatly, and in a way that makes everyone else comfortable.

‚ÄúNo one gets to tell you how to feel.‚Äù
Except everyone does. Eye rolls. Sighs. Dismissive silence.

‚ÄúOther people aren‚Äôt responsible for how you feel.‚Äù
Really? So if my partner cheats, and five minutes ago I was content, now I‚Äôm gutted ‚Äî that‚Äôs my fault?

Pain doesn‚Äôt just appear out of thin air. It has a source.

‚∏ª

This philosophy? Manufactured.

It‚Äôs a safety net for people who can‚Äôt handle their own feelings.

They say, ‚ÄúYour emotions are your problem,‚Äù while quietly avoiding the fact that they don‚Äôt know what to do with their own.

I‚Äôd bet the first person who said those words didn‚Äôt do it from a place of wisdom, but from shame ‚Äî shaming someone who felt too deeply for their comfort.

And yes, I‚Äôve earned the right to be cynical.

I live in a world that tells me I‚Äôm too much, and fitting into those constraints takes more labor than anyone has invested in learning how to receive what I feel.

‚∏ª

We‚Äôve felt the weight of the world ‚Äî even the parts that aren‚Äôt ours.

We know what others feel, even when we can‚Äôt make sense of our own.

And yet, here we are, still standing.

The nerve of people to call that ‚Äútoo much,‚Äù when half the time, we‚Äôre holding the emotional load they refuse to touch.

You want me to settle down? I‚Äôm holding your energy so you can be comfortable.

That‚Äôs like telling a blanket not to warm you up when you‚Äôre cold.

‚∏ª

Maybe we‚Äôre not too much.

Maybe they‚Äôre just not enough.

Because the world doesn‚Äôt need more people who feel less.

It needs more people who have felt everything ‚Äî and are still willing to show up anyway.

So to all my fellow ‚Äútoo much‚Äù people out there ‚Äî don‚Äôt shrink.

You‚Äôre not a problem to be solved.

You‚Äôre proof that others have yet to solve their own problems.

A soulmate to share magnetic vibes, engaging companionship, and a feeling of belonging with each other as though we‚Äôve both won an AGT Golden Buzzer for true love.

I live alone in a nice house with Asian decor and live a simple ‚Äúhomebody‚Äù life, yet also enjoy occasional dining out, shopping, and attending shows. I‚Äôm passionate about living a healthy lifestyle with no smoking, no drinking, no coffee, and an intermittent-fasting vegetarian diet (except for a few seafoods).

I like a wide variety of music, but favorites include Depeche Mode, The Cure, The Smiths, Enya, KISS (with makeup), INXS, Mannheim Steamroller, Twelve Girls Band, and composers such as John Williams, Hans Zimmer, Danny Elfman, Martin O'Donnell, and John Barry.

My entertainment interests include sci-fi (Star Trek, Stargate, The Matrix, Terminator, etc), action/adventure (James Bond, Jason Bourne, Pirates of the Caribbean, etc), fantasy (Game of Thrones, Harry Potter, Once Upon A Time, etc), comedy (The Big Bang Theory, The Office, Will & Grace, etc), superheroes (Marvel, Batman, etc), Godzilla, Doris Day, and much more.

Things we could do together?

* Cuddle under a shared blanket watching movies & TV shows
* Gaming:
   * Board games
   * Card games
   * Chess
   * Video games like Halo, LEGO, and others
   * Artsy-crafty DIY stuff and creative hobbies
   * Cooking and baking, with whole foods and flirty mischief, kisses, and soft jazz music
   * Snuggling while listening to music by candlelight
   * Bubble baths in a large tub drawn for two
   * Forehead kisses ‚Ä¶and full-body kisses
   * Bicycle rides
   * Nature walks
   * Housecleaning (I know, not fun ‚Ä¶but someone‚Äôs gotta do it, so we‚Äôll team up and get it done in half the time)

‚Ä¶Basically share a happy life together with love, respect, and frequent physical touch.

I‚Äôm seeking a deep relationship with a large age gap, built on common interests and emotional honesty with somebody who was born female. She should have traditional values, no tattoos or piercings, no unhealthy habits such as smoking or drinking (including wine), no kids, and already (or be willing to be) cruelty-free. I‚Äôll also be impressed if she‚Äôs solved the mystery of folding fitted sheets. üòÜ

I like a feminine woman who enjoys clingy hand-holding, hugs & kisses (even in public), prefers wearing dresses & skirts, has long-ish hair length (up top only, smooth everywhere else), naturally pretty & clean complexion without needing makeup, and enjoys wearing no pajamas after saying ‚ÄúAlexa, turn off the bedroom lights‚Äù ‚Ä¶with sensual nightly ""rodeo practice‚Äù in silk sheets before falling asleep wrapped in each other‚Äôs arms and legs. ü•∞

My job hours and reserved personality make it almost impossible to meet anybody, especially in my small remote town, so I‚Äôm hoping to find someone compatible online for getting to know, dating, and developing a friendship with romantic intent.

Thanks for reading all this but alas there‚Äôs no prize at the end, except maybe a connection between us. How about sending me a chat request and becoming the best part of my day? ‚ù§Ô∏è

Every Black Friday, kitchen threads on r/HomeImprovement and r/BuyItForLife light up with deal hunters asking:¬†*‚ÄúAre those 40% off microwaves legit or fake?‚Äù*¬†The truth -most ads exaggerate savings. That‚Äôs why Reddit buyers track the¬†**real markdowns**¬†and share which models are genuinely worth buying, based on wattage, build quality, and reliability.

In 2025, the spotlight shifts toward smart-sensor microwaves, mid-century retro designs, and high-efficiency inverter models. From TOSHIBA‚Äôs polished stainless units to GASLAND‚Äôs over-the-range powerhouse, Reddit‚Äôs verified picks below combine style, durability, and everyday practicality.  
*Updated hourly through Cyber Monday 2025 to reflect verified community findings.*

* [**TOSHIBA ML4-EM12PA(BS) Countertop Microwave Oven** ](https://www.pricedropdeals.com/2025/11/01/black-friday-microwav-deals-2025/#lg-48-inch-class-oled-evo-ai-c-5-series-oled-48-c-5-pua-22-off)**‚Äì 10 % Off**
   * Reddit cooks praise this 1000W Toshiba for its even heating and quiet operation. The Smart Sensor auto-adjusts time and temperature, preventing overcooked leftovers -a common frustration in budget units. Its 1.2 cu. ft. capacity fits dinner plates comfortably, while the 13 auto menus simplify tasks like popcorn and frozen veggies. The stainless finish resists fingerprints, giving it a premium look. The control panel backlight could be brighter in low light, but for under $150, it‚Äôs one of 2025‚Äôs most consistent performers.
* [**Farberware FM09WEISS Microwave, 0.9 Cu. Ft.**](https://www.pricedropdeals.com/2025/11/01/black-friday-microwav-deals-2025/#strong-strong-strong-strong-strong-strong-strong-strong-strong-dell-latitude-3550-ultra-7-155-u-32-gb-ram-1-tb-ssd-strong-strong-28-off-strong-strong-strong-strong-strong-strong-strong-strong-strong) **‚Äì 13 % Off**
   * This compact white model is perfect for small kitchens, apartments, and dorms. With 900 watts of power and straightforward dial controls, it‚Äôs built for reliability over flash. Redditors like its easy defrost mode and consistent output for oatmeal, soups, and coffee reheats. Limited interior space means full dinner plates won‚Äôt fit; best suited for single servings and light use.
* [**BLACK+DECKER Countertop Microwave Oven 0.9 Cu Ft**](https://www.pricedropdeals.com/2025/11/01/black-friday-microwav-deals-2025/#strong-strong-strong-strong-strong-strong-strong-strong-strong-strong-corsair-hs-65-surround-strong-strong-strong-strong-strong-strong-strong-strong-strong-strong) **‚Äì 20 % Off**
   * Known as the ‚Äúworkhorse microwave‚Äù on Reddit, this unit‚Äôs 10 power levels and memory function allow precise reheating. The digital control panel feels modern yet simple, while its 6 auto menus cover essentials. Users appreciate the built-in child lock and quick one-touch start button. The exterior can get warm during extended cooking, but it‚Äôs sturdy and reliable for everyday use.

   * Another popular option for renters, the Farberware Black version adds an LED display and express-cook buttons. Reddit users say it delivers ‚Äúno-fuss performance‚Äù for small portions and frozen meals. The sleek matte finish hides fingerprints better than stainless models. The door button is slightly stiff at first, but it softens over time -a minor quirk for its price point.
* [**Nostalgia Mid-Century Retro Microwave Oven (Red)**](https://www.pricedropdeals.com/2025/11/01/black-friday-microwav-deals-2025/#strong-strong-strong-strong-strong-strong-strong-strong-strong-strong-strong-sony-wh-1000-xm-5-strong-strong-strong-strong-strong-strong-strong-strong-strong-strong-strong) **‚Äì 43 % Off**

It features 8 pre-programmed settings and a large chrome dial that‚Äôs easy to use. The red design brightens up minimalist kitchens, and the display clock glows softly at night. Slightly slower cooking than 1000W models, but unbeatable aesthetic appeal -great for small apartments or retro-themed setups.

* [**COMFEE' Retro Small Microwave Oven (Green, 0.7 Cu Ft)**](https://www.pricedropdeals.com/2025/11/01/black-friday-microwav-deals-2025/#strong-strong-strong-strong-strong-strong-strong-strong-dji-avata-2-fly-more-combo-1-battery-27-off-strong-strong-strong-strong-strong-strong-strong-strong) **‚Äì 11 % Off**
   * A compact, Instagram-famous microwave that Reddit users love for its personality. The position-memory turntable returns to its starting point after use -meaning handles on mugs always face front. It‚Äôs ideal for small spaces or studio apartments. The mute function adds nighttime convenience. 700W power limits it to light tasks; not ideal for large frozen meals but perfect for quick heating.
* [**Chefman Countertop Microwave Oven 0.7 Cu Ft**](https://www.pricedropdeals.com/2025/11/01/black-friday-microwav-deals-2025/#strong-strong-strong-strong-strong-strong-strong-strong-strong-strong-logitech-g-733-lightspeed-wireless-strong-strong-strong-strong-strong-strong-strong-strong-strong-strong) **‚Äì 20 % Off**
   * This eco-mode microwave wins praise in r/Frugal for energy efficiency. Ten power levels, six cooking presets, and a child lock make it family-friendly. The sleek black finish complements modern kitchens. Reddit users highlight its quiet operation and strong reheating consistency for soups and leftovers. Slightly smaller turntable (9.6 inches) limits full dinner plates, but it‚Äôs compact and reliable.
* [**Panasonic 1.2 cu. ft. Inverter Microwave 1250W (Renewed)**](https://www.pricedropdeals.com/2025/11/01/black-friday-microwav-deals-2025/#strong-strong-strong-strong-strong-strong-strong-strong-strong-strong-logitech-g-733-lightspeed-wireless-strong-strong-strong-strong-strong-strong-strong-strong-strong-strong) **‚Äì 12 % Off**
   * Featuring Panasonic‚Äôs famous inverter tech, this 1250W unit delivers steady power for even heating -no more hot edges and cold centers. Redditors note the difference in defrosting precision and lower energy consumption. As a renewed model, it‚Äôs eco-friendly and cost-effective. Lacks the glossy finish of brand-new versions, but the performance is identical at a fraction of the cost.
* [**GE GCST10A1WSS 4-in-1 Microwave Oven**](https://www.pricedropdeals.com/2025/11/01/black-friday-microwav-deals-2025/#strong-strong-strong-strong-strong-strong-strong-strong-strong-strong-logitech-g-733-lightspeed-wireless-strong-strong-strong-strong-strong-strong-strong-strong-strong-strong) **‚Äì 15 % Off**
   * The multitasker of 2025. Redditors call it ‚Äúthe Swiss Army knife for kitchens‚Äù -combining microwave, air fryer, convection oven, and broiler. Its 1.0 cu. ft. capacity and stainless build make it great for dorms or small kitchens. The air-fry feature produces crisp fries without preheating. Learning curve for convection settings, but once adjusted, it replaces several appliances in one.

# Buying Tips from Reddit Threads 2025

* **Check wattage:**¬†900‚Äì1000W is the sweet spot for even cooking.
* **Avoid fake markdowns:**¬†If a model was ‚Äú$199‚Äù for months, it‚Äôs not a real 40% off.
* **Over-the-range models:**¬†Confirm venting direction before purchasing -Redditors report common misfits.
* **Aesthetic shoppers:**¬†COMFEE‚Äô and Nostalgia models get the most upvotes for design + value balance.

1oluwz5,https://www.reddit.com/r/pourover/comments/1oluwz5/grinder_suggestion_to_complement_df83_v2/,Grinder suggestion to complement DF83 v2,"I am looking for suggestion for a 2nd grinder purchase. My budget is \~$250-300; and I am OK buying a used grinder in that range.

I brew pourover filter coffee \~70% of the time; and milk-based Espresso for the remaining \~30% of the time. Plain/Black Espresso and Americanos are rare for me, perhaps once or twice a year at best.

I roast my own coffee in SR800, and usually prefer light roasted african or central american coffees with acidity and fruitiness. However, I am still learning to roast more consistently, and I often land in light-medium range instead of light range. This should get better as I learn, but for now its safe to assume that I will be drinking coffess in light to medium ranges.

I currently own a DF83 and a Kingrinder K6. I used the K6 for pourover (using Hario Switch), but was not very happy with the cup taste. It produced way more fine and resulted in either very astringent or very sour cups. I could never dial it in well to a taste I prefer. So I decided to experiment and use the DF83 for pourover. I am a lot more happier with the coffee I can brew using DF83 - I can taste the acidity and don't get the astringency at grind settings that are at the upper-end of Moka Pot. However, I still do not get the taste clarity and separation of flavors. That said, it's a cup I still enjoy every day.

The problem now is that for Espresso, my choice is to either switch back and forth (and purge some coffee in between) or use the K6. Given I drink mostly milk-based, the K6 has been fine for taste. The milk pretty much hides all the imperfections to the point where I am OK with the K6 from a taste point of view, but not from workflow. Grinding at Espresso setting on a K6 is, lets just say, a good workout! I prefer an electric grinder instead. I also don't like to switch back-and-forth and waste coffee, and sometimes have to dial-in again as its impossible to get to the same exact setting with stepless grinders.

SO, long story shot, I am now looking to add an extra grinder to my setup. My budget is \~$250, but I am willing to go to $300 if needed.

The choices I see are:

1. **Use DF83 for Espresso, buy a dedicated pourover grinder**. Options here are mostly hand grinders (K-Ultra, ZP6) or mid-end used electric grinders (Ode 2 or Varia VS3). I would love to get a Timemore 078, but realistically it is way out of my budget even as a used grinder.
2. **Use DF83 for pourover, buy a dedicated espresso grinder**. Handgrinders are not an option here due to workflow issues. But I could perhaps settle on a conical burr grinder like Baratza Encore ESP Pro. Later, I could sell the K6 and perhaps buy dedicated DLC brew burrs for the DF83 to improve the flavor separations.

I am looking for suggestions here. What should I go towards - my mind says option (1) since I am not 100% satisfied with the pourover taste; but then I will have to be OK with the hand grinder with pourover (which is less preferred but fine).",2,1762021100.0,pourover,4,1.0,False
