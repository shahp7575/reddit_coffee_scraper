1lohq4u,https://www.reddit.com/r/PoweredByExperience/comments/1lohq4u/explore_the_best_pour_over_coffee_maker_hario/,Explore the Best Pour Over Coffee Maker Hario Review Worth It,"Hario PDA-02-T has been part of my morning coffee ritual for the past few weeks, and being someone who thrives on the perfect cup of pour-over coffee, I was intrigued by its unique design. Unlike your typical pour-over setup, this coffee maker includes the drip-assist feature, which is genuinely more than just a fancy add-on—it promises consistency, which is every coffee lover's dream. However, after daily use, I’ve experienced some aspects that stood out for better or worse.

**Design and Build Quality**

The first thing that caught my attention was the clear, minimalist design. The Hario PDA-02-T is a compact 10.92-inch structure that not only fits neatly on my small apartment countertop but also feels durable. The transparent plastic material might initially seem flimsy, but it's surprisingly sturdy. Being a manual drip coffee machine with a simple matte finish, it’s pleasing to the eye. It’s worth noting this model seems designed with functionality in mind rather than flashy aesthetics, which aligns perfectly with Hario’s reputation for practical coffee gear.

**User-Friendly Functionality**

What makes this product genuinely appealing is its ease of use. Setting up in the morning takes little effort. All you have to do is place the drip-assist on a compatible 02 V60 dripper, pour water into one of the designated sections (center or outer ring), and let it do its magic. I’ll admit, not needing a gooseneck kettle is a game-changer. The even-flow mechanism, guided by the different-sized holes, ensures an almost foolproof method of achieving the right brewing pace. Whether it’s my groggy pre-work mornings or weekends experimenting with single-origin beans, the evenly distributed brewing process has been incredibly reliable.

**Hario PDA-02-T might be cheaper on Amazon—find out.**

**Innovative Drip-Assist System**

The star feature is undeniably the drip-assist system. At first, I wasn’t sure how much of a difference it would make, but the precision speaks for itself. The evenly spaced holes in the drip-assist component allow the water to flow into the coffee bed without any mess or unpredictability. It even prevents overpour, which can sometimes be an issue with manual pouring. Pouring hot water at specific intervals, then watching it seamlessly flow into the central section of the filter, feels oddly satisfying. However, I did notice that mastering the ratio of coffee grounds and water can take a bit of trial and error.

**Benefits**

- Compact and lightweight design is ideal for smaller kitchens.  
- The innovative drip-assist system prevents overpouring and ensures even brewing.  
- No need for additional fancy kettles; works great with regular ones.  
- Perfectly slows down water flow for optimal coffee extraction.  

**Shortcomings**

- Plastic material, while durable, doesn’t feel as premium as other coffee makers in this price range.  
- It may require some initial practice to nail down the ideal brewing process.  
- Limited to personal use due to its smaller size; not ideal for making larger quantities of coffee at once.  

**Comparing it to Other Options**

While using this, I couldn’t help but think about my previous experiences with Chemex and Kalita Wave. Each of these serves its purpose, but the Hario PDA-02-T focuses heavily on control and precision. The Chemex offers a more aesthetic presentation and can brew in larger volumes but lacks that pinpoint attention to drip control. On the other hand, the Kalita Wave excels with its flat-bottom design but demands a good-quality kettle to achieve ideal results. This drip-assist model successfully bridges ease and performance, though it’s not aiming to replace those traditional setups but rather complement them.

**Price to Quality Ratio**

For its price point, this coffee maker delivers impressive value. You're paying for functionality, reliability, and an innovative feature that simplifies brewing. While the materials don’t scream luxury, the performance speaks volumes, especially to those who prioritize flavor over bling. If you’re someone who sticks with pour-over brewing for personal use, it smoothly balances affordability and practicality.

1lohpzp,https://www.reddit.com/r/columbiamo/comments/1lohpzp/does_anyone_else_have_bad_experiences_with/,Does anyone else have bad experiences with Fretboard Coffee?,"  I used to really love Fretboard. I would go occasionally, and the drinks are very good. They make all their syrups in house, roast their own beans, and for a while it was a place I was proud to say I worked at. My opinion of them actually plumited during and after working for them. Even ignoring all the health hazards (it is not uncommon for baristas to find mold in either the ice or the water bottles on the food truck that are used to make any drink that has coffee), working there was an endless cycle of hearing about weird and horrible things management has said both about and to customers (including talking about customers in a sexual way within their earshot while working, which many people have complained about but as the perpetrator is the manager she has not received discipline for this)

 The manager also has been known to scream at employees for making mistakes or giving their two week notice, meaning when I started working there I was even warned about it by a coworker who was leaving and had been screamed at at the employee meeting the night before for announcing that she was leaving. 

   In addition, I love being a barista and making drinks, I'm very good at it, and I got along very well with my coworkers, but they fully fired me after a few months of working there with 0 disscussions before hand. The reasons they claimed were ones I had never heard about, and were all things they could have easily told me and solved every problem immediately, things they had never once told me and there was no way I could know (for example, one of the stated reasons that I was fired was because I did not contact the owner about minor flooding during a storm, something that happened every time it rained and I had never seen a coworker contact the owner about it, nor had I been told that it was something I was expected to do). They are extremely unprofessional and it is so so disappointing because Fretboard used to be my favorite place to get coffee.

  Most recently, and the reason that I have decided to make this post, is that on Friday I decided to go visit Fretboard as it had been a while. The person working the counter was one I had been friends with when I worked there, and they offered me a drink and we talked for a bit over an hour before I left. Today, multiple days later, the manager texted my personal phone number accusing me of stealing and banning me from the shop. I assume you can understand my frustration with this considering the fact that I quite literally have never stolen from Fretboard, and I do not appreciate being falsely accused (I also warned the barista that they may receive backlash from the manager due to their kindness to me, and I very much hope that they do not receive undeserved punishment from the manager as she is already known to treat this person poorly).

  I'm sorry this post is so long, but I am extremely frustrated with the management of Fretboard and their treatment of customers and employees alike, and would like to see if others have had these sorts of experiences.",0,1751313939.0,columbiamo,0,0.4,False

I feel like I am going crazy, its really disturbing to have what i would imagine is the equivalent of an addict ""jonesing""  for a fix.. 

If anyone has any help or any idea what could be causing this, I would really appreciate it..My PCP doesn't have any availability until next month and I'm not even sure what I would even say to her.. is it a medical issue??

But this situation reminded me I'm clearly lacking in mental strategies / self-reflection in how to deal with the other 2%.

My wife and I have a coffee shop we really like, although its somewhat out of the way for us so we only go approximately 2 times a month. Nothing but good interactions with the employees thus far.

About 3-4 weeks ago we went as per usual and noticed there were several new employees working. This is not uncommon as they get busy on the weekends and hire new part timers. Everything with our order and receiving our drinks/food goes well, except I notice they forgot the muffin we ordered. My wife and I were walking out the door so I mention to my wife I'm going to go ask someone at the counter for our missing muffin, and she proceed out the door to the car with the rest of the food in hand.

Here's where it gets weird. I ask the girl currently at the counter (maybe early to mid 20s?) for the muffin that was missing in our order as politely as possible, she goes to grab it and then says ""I like your shirt."" I truly have no idea what the fuck shirt I'm wearing at the moment so it takes a few seconds to stop what I'm thinking of and divert my thoughts, and then before its even been 5 seconds she hits me with ""What, do you not know how to take a compliment?"" I respond with a half thought question ""Thanks...?"" take my muffin, and leave.

I know that logically, this sort of rude comment reflects on her, not me, but its made it extremely awkward going back into the coffee shop. I went there with my wife yesterday, and while she was there and said nothing, I just kept ruminating on the fact that she was going to try and say something to me, or even worse, to my wife. Just like, you work in customer service, why the hell would you say something like that to a customer?

Second cup was 3x bloom then two even pours to draw down.

Both cups had some slight acidity up front (more in the first cup) which I assume is from the lacto ferment vs under extraction.

I’m curious to grind a little finer at 5M on the next cups. I’m not sure if I prefer the single or double pour yet. I’m new to pour over in general so I’m still figuring out my method. I will also try with Sibarist Fast papers.

1lohnu4,https://i.redd.it/v5mohzz1f4af1.jpeg,$ATYR – Cantor Roadshow Announced for July 30–31: Reading Between the Lines,"Hi folks,

**Cantor Fitzgerald has just announced that it will host a two-day Non-Deal Roadshow (NDR) with aTyr Pharma ($ATYR) on Tuesday 30 July and Wednesday 31 July 2025.** The first day will consist of in-person meetings in Denver. The second day will be held virtually. Attending on behalf of aTyr will be President & CEO Sanjay Shukla, Chief Financial Officer Jill Broadfoot, and Senior Director of Investor Relations and Public Affairs Ashlee Dunston.

At face value, this might seem like a standard investor relations update. But in context — and when viewed through an institutional lens — I think this development is considerably more meaningful. And not just because of *what* is happening, but *when* it’s happening, *who’s involved*, and *how* it’s being executed.

If you take a step back and look at the whole picture — the timing, the operational realities, the body language from management over the past few months — this event reads like a tightly coordinated signal. One that suggests internal confidence, forward planning, and a shift in posture ahead of a binary catalyst that could redefine how the market sees this company.

Here’s my interpretation of what this NDR really tells us — and why it might be far more than just a calendar item.

---

### What’s a Non-Deal Roadshow, and why would aTyr be doing one now?

A Non-Deal Roadshow (NDR) is a sequence of private meetings between a public company’s senior management and institutional investors. The key point is that there’s **no capital raise attached** — it’s not about selling shares or placing stock. Instead, it’s about:
- Increasing awareness among institutions  
- Providing an up-to-date strategic picture  
- And preparing the ground for potential re-rating events

In biotech, NDRs are commonly used when a company is about to deliver a clinical readout, initiate a commercial pivot, or unlock a new segment of its story (e.g., platform expansion, regulatory breakthrough, or strategic partnering).

In aTyr’s case, the timing strongly suggests this roadshow is about preparing institutions for the upcoming **Phase 3 readout in pulmonary sarcoidosis** — and helping them understand not just the data, but the broader implications.

But the most important part of this setup isn’t the NDR itself. It’s **when** it’s happening — and what that tells us.

---

### The NDR is scheduled for **30–31 July 2025** — and that’s not just a detail. That’s a message.

Why does that date matter? Because **31 July is also the listed Primary Completion Date** of aTyr’s Phase 3 trial in pulmonary sarcoidosis — meaning that’s when the company completes collection of primary endpoint data for the trial.

Now, here’s where I think it gets more interesting. In biotech, data isn’t available immediately after primary completion. There’s a clear, methodical process:

1. **Data cleaning** – Clinical sites respond to data queries; inconsistencies are reconciled.  
2. **Database lock** – Once all data is validated, the dataset is locked and made ready for analysis.  
3. **Top-line analysis** – A firewalled statistical group runs the analysis and provides key endpoints to a select internal team.  
4. **Executive review** – The CEO, and likely a few other senior stakeholders (such as the CFO and CMO), review the results and begin mapping out communications strategy.  
5. **Public release** – The data is then prepared for public disclosure, often via press release and conference call.

That entire process — particularly the analysis and strategic planning phases — **happens before the public sees the data**. Sometimes significantly before.

So if the company is holding investor meetings on 30 and 31 July, and those meetings were arranged weeks in advance (which is almost always the case with events like this), then in all likelihood the company already has the top-line data — and had it when the decision was made to proceed with the NDR.

The likelihood is that this isn’t a “wait-and-see” maneuver. It looks more like a **post-data coordination move**.

---

### It’s worth contrasting this with how companies typically behave after seeing ambiguous or disappointing data.

There are generally two paths a company can take once they’ve seen the top-line readout:

**1. The “bad news” or uncertain readout playbook:**
- Cancel or quietly postpone all non-essential investor meetings  
- Release a statement like “data is being analyzed,” “results are complex,” or “additional context will be provided”  
- Buy time to reframe or de-escalate expectations  
- Prepare for controlled damage management

**2. The “clean and confident” playbook (what this looks like):**
- Lean in  
- Get ahead of the market  
- Meet with institutions before the press release  
- Frame the story on your own terms  
- Control the initial interpretation and seed the longer-term narrative

aTyr appears to be choosing the second path. And in my view, that suggests they saw something in the data that validated what they’ve been building toward — not just in sarcoidosis, but across their broader immunology platform.

---

### Why do the meetings in Denver?

In all likelihood, that’s a detail many people might gloss over. But if you read between the lines, it can actually be a strong tell.

Denver isn’t a generic conference location. It’s not where you go for passive exposure. If you’re flying your CEO and CFO out there, it’s either:
- Because a specific anchor fund (or cluster of funds) is based there, and you want to prioritise those meetings, or  
- Because Denver serves as a logistically efficient starting point for a broader institutional push

Either way, this suggests a **curated itinerary**, not a filler engagement. This wasn’t a box-ticking IR event. It looks like a targeted, hands-on effort.

---

### Let’s talk about personnel — and what their presence signals.

This is a big one. Who you send to an NDR says a lot about what kind of questions you expect to face.

If this were just a clinical update, aTyr might have sent a medical officer and IR representative. Instead, they’re sending:
- The **CEO**, who will be expected to speak not only to the trial data but to leadership posture, competitive positioning, and strategic direction  
- The **CFO**, who will likely be fielding questions around funding runway, launch modeling, manufacturing readiness, and capital allocation  
- And their **IR lead**, to ensure consistency of message across meetings

When you bring your CFO, in particular, you’re preparing for commercialisation questions — not just clinical.

That might include:
- How big will the launch team be?  
- How are you thinking about pricing and payer mix?  
- Will you pursue a royalty-based or non-dilutive financing structure?  
- Is there manufacturing capacity for scale-up?  
- How are you modeling cash burn post-readout?

So while this is technically still a development-stage company, the signal here is that they’re preparing to tell the **next chapter** of the story — and institutions are being briefed accordingly.

---

### Why do this before the data release? Because interpretation matters more than the numbers alone.

This, in my view, is one of the most overlooked dynamics in biotech investing.

The data doesn’t always speak for itself. Especially in immunology and rare disease trials, where endpoints are subjective, standard of care is weak or fragmented, and outcome measures are not always intuitive to the broader market.

If management wants institutions to understand:
- What’s truly meaningful vs. what’s statistically cosmetic  
- How this data compares to existing therapies or previous studies  
- Why a particular subgroup analysis may carry more weight than the primary endpoint

…then the best time to have that conversation is **before the press release drops**. That way, institutions are not trying to interpret the data cold. They already know what to look for — and how to understand it in context.

In that sense, this roadshow isn’t just a presentation. It’s **a framing operation**. And it's being conducted at exactly the moment when institutional narrative control becomes most valuable.

---

### Hypothesis Table

| Hypothesis | Confidence | Supporting Observations |
|-----------|------------|--------------------------|
| aTyr has already seen the top-line data | Very High | Timing logistics, preparation cycle, and management behavior align |
| Internal read of the data was positive or clean | High | Senior leadership traveling, no delays, no silence |
| Cantor Fitzgerald may initiate or refresh coverage | Medium-High | Hosting often precedes new research or client communication |
| Denver indicates targeted investor outreach | Medium | Likely fund-driven itinerary or a coordinated IR push |
| CFO presence signals launch preparedness | High | Suggests deeper commercial planning discussions |
| Roadshow is a pre-readout narrative control tool | Very High | Classic institutional behavior ahead of complex or high-value data |
| aTyr sees this as a transition moment | High | Messaging, posture, and personnel all point to business model shift |

---

### To Wrap up

There are always numerous ways to interpret events like this. But in my view, this particular setup — the dates, the personnel, the location, the host, the context — tells a story. And it doesn’t seem to be a story of hesitation. It looks more like quiet acceleration. A company that already knows what it has, and is now preparing the market to understand it too.

That doesn’t mean the readout is guaranteed to be a “home run.” It doesn’t eliminate risk. But it does strongly suggest that aTyr is entering this moment with a plan — not just to announce results, but to position the company for what comes next.

If there’s more to this story — whether around SSC-ILD expansion, broader NRP2-targeting pathways, or commercial optionality — we may see that surface shortly after this NDR.

Tuesday I did the same 45 units again, and same thing chest pain, crazy heart rate, etc. So on Friday I talked to the staff as my doc wasn't in. And they said it sounds like anxiety- I've been anxious before in the past, but never had full blown anxiety attacks. They said that chest pain isn't heard of and that since it sounds like anxiety to try to go on a walk and left it at that. (Not thrilled on how dismissive they were- follow up with my doc tomorrow afternoon)

Idk, maybe it is anxiety. There has been life changes for me. But I felt that chest pain last night and my heart rate being crazy so I talked to my Husband and he got concerned because he knows I never really had issues with anxiety before. I do feel better when I move. Anyways, I work from home so I'm kind of isolated all day so needless to say I've been spiraling with the what ifs. Is it the GLP-1? The myo-inositol? I'm also taking other supplements like magnesium and vitamin d3 with k2. 

I did search in this group about anxiety and I saw a few who posted the same so just chiming in with this experience to see if anyone found a solution? I'm supposed to take my shot tomorrow, but i think I'm going to wait. I haven't even had my coffee or supplements today as I'm trying to give my body a break to see if that helps, and eating some serotonin replenishing foods for some added gut health. 

I'm rambling but any insight or experiences is appreciated! ",1,1751313670.0,tirzepatidecompound,3,1.0,False

It’s been a year, and I still find myself thinking about you. Can you believe it’s been eight years now? You were my high school crush, and somehow, the feeling still stays — quiet, but there. I hope you’re happy and living the life that feels right for you. I love you for who you are — not just on the outside, but everything inside too. You were always funny and sarcastic in your own way, and I liked that. I’ve never felt this way for anyone else. I’m not waiting for anything to happen, and I hope you’re not either. I know it wouldn’t work, but still, you’ll always be one of those soft what-ifs I keep with me. Some things just aren’t meant to be — and that’s okay.

We’ve talked things through more than once. It never got messy just never lined up. It was always timing, or life pulling us in different directions. I know you weren’t ready, and I’ve come to understand that without holding it against you. I’ve let go of the future I once imagined. But I’d be lying if I said I don’t still notice the little things — the way your hair changed over the years, your voice when you’re half-awake, how you laugh when something genuinely gets you. I’ve recognized every bit of you, and somehow I loved you in all of them. 
 

I’ll always be here loving you — as a concept. And I’ll always think of us that way too: soft, unfinished, but special. You were one of my quiet hopes in this life, and even if we don’t cross paths again, you’ll always have that place in me. I love you.


P.S.

I hope you still keep our photobooth pic :)

Okay, Reddit, let me spill the tea on something that's seriously leveled up my tiny apartment game. I've always been wrestling with space. You know, the kind where your living room pulls triple duty as your office, dining room, and, let's be honest, a storage black hole? 😅

I was on the hunt for a coffee table, but everything I saw was either way too bulky, painfully basic, or just didn't vibe with my style. Then, I stumbled upon this modern lift top coffee table with storage, and honestly, it's been a total lifesaver.

So, what's the buzz? It's a lift top coffee table designed for small spaces, which is exactly what I needed. The top lifts up, turning it into a mini-desk or dining table. No more hunching over my laptop or balancing a plate on my knees! This has seriously upped my work-from-home game. I can actually be productive without feeling like a pretzel. It saves me time by providing a quick and easy workspace without having to set up a separate table.

But the real magic is the hidden storage underneath. Seriously, it's like a secret compartment for all my living room essentials. Remotes? Gone. Magazines? Tucked away. Random charging cables? You betcha. It's amazing how much less stressed I feel when my living room isn't a disaster zone. It eliminates the need for additional storage furniture, which saves me money and space. I even found some cool stuff on ursupermart.com to help organize the inside!

I was worried it would be a pain to assemble, but it was surprisingly easy. Took maybe an hour, tops. And it actually looks really stylish. I went with a black lift top coffee table, and it fits perfectly with my decor. It's not just functional; it actually makes my apartment look more put-together.

Before, I was constantly stressed about the lack of space and the never-ending clutter. Now, I actually enjoy spending time in my living room. It's a small thing, but it's made a huge difference in my overall happiness. I can finally say that I have a home I can be proud of. 😊

I know, I know, it sounds like I'm exaggerating, but I'm genuinely impressed with this thing. It's solved so many of my small apartment problems. If you're dealing with a tiny living space and desperately need more storage and workspace, you should seriously consider a lift top coffee table with hidden storage for small apartments.

I did a ton of research before buying, comparing lift top coffee tables and reading reviews. I was looking for something affordable, functional, and stylish. This one ticked all the boxes. Plus, it eliminates the need for extra storage furniture, which saves me money and space.

I used to dread having people over because my apartment always felt so cramped and disorganized. Now, I actually look forward to entertaining. I even got compliments on my ""new"" living room setup! It makes me feel proud of my living space.

Okay, Reddit, I gotta share this. I've been slowly (and painfully) trying to make my tiny apartment feel less... claustrophobic. My biggest issue? No space! Like, zero. My living room was a black hole of clutter. I was working from home on my couch, eating on my couch, *living* on my couch, and it was not cute.

I desperately needed a **coffee table**, but regular ones just felt like they'd take up even more precious real estate. I started researching online and came across the idea of a **lift top table**. I'll admit, I was skeptical. Looked kinda gimmicky. But I was desperate, so I dove down the rabbit hole, specifically searching for a ""**coffee table with storage**"" because, let's be real, that's half the battle.

After weeks of comparison shopping and reading reviews (seriously, I became a **lift top coffee table review** expert), I finally found one that seemed promising. It was a **modern lift top coffee table**, and it was black, which matched my existing furniture. Score! I figured, what the heck, and decided to **buy lift top coffee table** online.

Let me tell you, the moment it arrived, I knew I'd made the right choice. This thing is seriously awesome. The **lift-top mechanism** is so smooth and easy to use. Now, instead of hunching over my laptop on the couch, I just lift the top, and BAM, instant workspace. My back is thanking me already! No more setting up makeshift tables just to eat a bowl of cereal. I can finally **work comfortably from the couch**.

But the best part? The **hidden storage**. Seriously, it's a game changer (okay, I know I wasn't supposed to say that, but it's true!). All my remotes, magazines, even my laptop charger have a home now. No more random clutter everywhere. My living room actually looks... organized! I went from a cluttered living room to an organized living room, and the difference is night and day. I actually feel proud of my space now.

My friend came over the other day, and she was blown away. She was all like, ""Where did you get that **lift top coffee table for small spaces**? I need one!""

Honestly, if you're struggling with a small apartment and desperate for a **space saving coffee table with lift top and storage for apartment**, this is the way to go. It's functional, stylish, and surprisingly affordable. I was worried it would be cheap and flimsy, but it's actually really sturdy. Plus, it gives my place a more modern look. I've also found a place to buy groceries online for even more convenience at ursupermart.com.

If you're looking to **purchase a storage coffee table** and you're on the fence, just do it. You won't regret it. It really has changed my life. Okay, maybe that's a bit dramatic, but it's seriously made a huge difference in my daily life and how I feel about my living space. Getting to **work from home in small space** is now much more comfortable.

2.) The coffee flavor was not nearly as strong as I had hoped. I infused the custard with coffee beans for 18 hours but the coffee flavor was very mild. Should I use coarsely ground beans? Shots of espresso?  

3.) The chocolate was not dispersed super evenly. There were parts of the finished ice cream that got way more chocolate than others. Do I need to add it in earlier? Should I freeze the chocolate/coconut oil and then chop it into smaller chunks instead?

I also couldn't post this last night as intended as I was busy yesterday and couldn't finish trying out the Nishane set, but here goes the remaining 49 fragrances.

**Louis Vuitton Nuit de Feu** - Oddly very fruity right after spraying, but it immediately fades into a smokey, incensey leather-oud. It's much better than I expected. 8.5/10

**Mind Games Mentor** - Very fruity in the air. Up close I can smell caramelized/ambery plum with a hint of coffee's roasted finish. There's also a very slight citrus brightness in the edge of the scent. Very good, one of the best Mind Games I've tried for sure. 8.5/10

**Maison Crivelli Oud Maracujá** - Sweet and fruity but smokey in the air. Very strong passionfruit and leathery oud. This is nice and I can see why people like this, but I much prefer rose with oud. I'm definitely interested to try out Oud Stallion and Oud Cadenza next. 8/10

**Versace Atelier**

• *Gingembre Pétillant* - Immediately made me think of the oríginal Eros smelling it in the air. It's a ginger bomb with vanilla. It's very much like you took Eros EDT and removed the top notes. If this is what Baccarat EDP smells like (based on Fragrantica votes), this is beyond underwhelming. It's not bad though, it's alright. 6.5/10

• *Safran Royal* - Bright and ambery patchouli with some saffron and I can smell a very light leather in the back. I can also smell rose here even though it's not listed in the notes. I like this, it reminds me of something else, not sure what. 8/10

**Memo Paris**

• *Iberian Leather* - Of all the Memo Leathers, this has the strongest and most noticeable leather note, to the point it's drowning out the rest of the scent, at least on paper. This was floral and spicy in the air, it reminded me a lot of Halfeti. Pretty good, will have to try on skin and hope it doesn't smell like petroleum. 9/10

• *Abu Dhabi* - Sweet and syrupy dates and plum in the air. Same scent up close, just with added spice from cardamom. I don't pick up saffron here. I'd say this is definitely a gourmand scent, and a pretty good one at that. You should definitely go light on the sprays though, syrupy scents are the most cloying ones if oversprayed. 9/10

• *Moon Fever* - Very aromatic and floral citruses, a noticeable dry vetiver as well. Makes me think a lot of Neroli Portofino, but better and less airy. It kind of smells like a bathroom cleaning product in the opening, but it seems to smooth out and smell much better as it dries down. 7.5/10

With this I've tried most Memo fragrances from the Cuirs Nomades collection, excluding Indian Leather and Oriental Leather, and my favorites and the ones I think you should try are African (the best one by some margin), Russian, Italian, Ocean and Iberian Leather. Next I'd like to try more fragrances from their Graines Vagabondes collection as I haven't come across samples for a lot of them. The ones I'm particularly interested in are Palais Bourbon and Cappadocia.

**Amouage**

• *Purpose 50* - Unbelievably smooth scent. Despite the prominent church-like frankincense, the scent is overall bright, clean and sweet. This is a masterpiece. 10/10

• *Overture Woman* - Sweet boozy apple in the air. Like all Amouage I've tried it's perfectly blended and of the highest quality. Smells bright, airy, floral, a bit sweet. Not too feminine in my opinion, much like Guidance I think this is unisex.  9.5/10

• *Decision* - Ambery, vanillic and soft, almost creamy in the air. Smells very familiar. Up close there's frankincense just like Purpose 50's, some woodiness and citruses. Very nice. 9/10

• *Existence* - Very fruity in the air. Soapy and musky rose but something is giving me a synthetic chemical scent. A bit feminine leaning but nowhere near as much as the notes would make you think. 7.5/10

Amouage is a house that continues to surprise me with the sheer quality, beautiful blends and the uniqueness of their fragrances. I have purchased a discovery set from Jomashop that's supposed to include all fragrances from the first three chapters of the Odyssey Collection*, and I'll be buying their Exceptional Extraits set for men, the Library Collection set and their general Men Sampler set. As expensive as these are I do believe they're worth the money for the quality of the fragrances you're receiving.

*Ashore, Crimson Rocks, Enclave, Meander, Boundless, Material, Guidance, Lineage, Purpose and Search

**Byredo**

• *Animalique* - Powdery on first instance but then the leather becomes apparent. The violet note is very good. Definitely a unisex scent. 8.5/10

• *Mixed Emotions* - Syrupy berry smell in the air. Up close it's green and fruity, I can totally pick out the tea note. Slightly woody too. Pretty nice. 8/10

• *Mumbai Noise* - Slightly herbal in the air. Super strong coffee note, probably the most rɛalistic I've smelled. The oud, coffee and tonka bean blend perfectly. Looking forward to trying it on skin. 9/10

• *Young Rose* - Peppery, musky rose in the air, the combination smells a bit like tea. Way more musky up close, very well blended. Not as feminine or feminine leaning as you would think. 8/10

Byredo is also a house that's surprised me with the few fragrances of theirs I've tried. Admittedly I've ignored their best sellers and gone for scent profiles I find more interesting, but I might inevitably end up trying out fragrances like Bal d'Afrique, Rose of No Man's Land, etc.

**Argos**

• *Adonis Awakens* - Sweet, fruity and floral in the air. The grapefruit blends well with the rose, and there's a slight powderiness at the back of the scent that's very nice. I think this is unisex, not feminine leaning but definitely not masculine. 8/10

• *Bacio Immortale* - Very rɛalistic raspberry scent in the air. Up close the leather is very noticeable, this is similar to Tuscan Leather and PDM's Godolphin, but the leather note here is clean and smooth. Like those two, I have to try on skin and hope it doesn't smell like petroleum. 8/10

• *Birth of Venus* - Smells like peach jam in the air. Lots of tuberose up close, very fruity and definitely a feminine scent. I'm not a fan of white florals but they're done well here. 8/10

• *Brivido Della Caccia* - Green and manly mate note in the air, but that's all I smell, even up close. It's good, but not as much as the others. Definitely similar to Memo's Irish Leather and Moroccan Leather but it's the best of the three by far. 7/10

• *Danaë* - Very woody with citruses and some powderiness. This makes me think of something my grandfather used to wear, so I find this quite masculine but it might just be that association I have with the scent. Very nice. 8.5/10

• *Fall of Phaeton* - Sweet, vanillic and a bit powdery in the air. More aromatic and citrusy up close, quite woody. Pretty nice. 8/10

• *Love Triumphs Over War* - Smells like an old lady to be honest. Very floral with tiny hints of cinnamon and fruits but it's not that nice. 5/10

• *Pallas Athene* - Jammy florals and fruits in the air. I'm having a hard time describing this scent but I like it a lot, although it's definitely feminine. 8/10

• *Pour Femme* - Powdery and floral, slightly vanillic. Not as feminine as LTOW or Pallas Athene to my nose. 7/10

• *Pour Homme* - Smells cool and refreshing, it does smell like gin. It's weak on paper, though. Not as interesting as their other scents, it's kind of like an incomplete version of Danaë. 7/10

• *Sacred Flame* - Sweet, fruity, vanillic, definitely clove and cinnamon here, it's reminding me a lot of Roja's Enigma in how it's Vanilla Coke-ish. I would have thought a fragrance called Sacred Flame would be woody but I like it anyways. 7.5/10

• *Triumph Of Bacchus* - Boozy apple/peach in the air. A lot of saffron up close. I can smell a hint of chocolatey patchouli behind the saffron and rum. I think I might like this one a lot after a full wear. I can see this has a similar profile to Carlisle but this is much better, as the patchouli is too overpowering in the PDM. 8/10

While there was no fragrance from Argos that truly resonated with me, there were a handful I liked a lot and that I'm looking forward to trying. I know they also have their Extraits line and I might try those out at some point too, hopefully Olfactory sells that discovery set at some point as it's expensive off Argos's website. Something I love about Argos is they're one of the few houses that offer 30 ml bottles, so I might end up buying whichever fragrance I like most from the standout ones in that size down the line.

**Nishane**

• *Wūlóng Chá* - Very herbal and fruity, it doesn't necessarily make me think of tea though. Reminds me a bit of Kilian's Bamboo Harmony. Very calming scent. 8/10

• *Ambra Calabria* - Citrusy, powdery and slightly ambery, a bit herbal too. Makes me think a bit of the beach. Also a calming scent, I'd like candles of this and Wūlóng Chá. 7.5/10

• *Sultan Vetiver* - Obviously a lot of vetiver but the neroli note adds a beautiful floral aspect to the scent. This is one of the best vetiver fragrances I've tried. 8/10

• *Tuberóza* - I'm not a fan of tuberose but this is nice. It reminds me of Reflection Man for some reason. 7.5/10

• *Pachulí Kozha* - Beautiful and incredibly smooth chocolatey patchouli. Easily the best patchouli scent I've ever smelled. 9.5/10

• *Afrika-Olifant* - Despite the notes making it sound like it's incredibly animalic, this is extremely smooth, bright and almost clean smelling. I can't describe the smell but I like this a lot. 8/10

• *Fan Your Flames* - Insanely smooth and perfectly blended coconut and rum scent. Looking forward to trying this out more. 9/10

• *Hundred Silent Ways* - Floral, fruity, vanillic. Could come off a bit feminine but I think it's unisex. Once again this is a well done tuberose scent. 8/10

• *Hacivat* - Definitely very similar to Aventus, just without the smokiness, less woody and maybe a tinge more mossy to my nose. It's like a middle ground between Aventus and Aventus Cologne. If this lasts and projects better than Aventus this will very likely be a pickup down the line. 9/10

• *Zenne* - Very floral and fruity as well. Leans a little more feminine than Hundred Silent Ways. The rose note became more prominent after a while. 7.5/10

• *Karagoz* - It's much more citrusy and less sunscreeny than Reflection Man, but undoubtedly very similar to my nose. I think I like this a bit more than the Amouage. 8/10

• *B-612* - Aromatic and woody, smooth to the point it's velvety, if that's even a word. Slightly reminiscent of an aromatic fougère. 8.5/10

• *Vain & Naïve* - Another fruity and floral scent but this one is a bit syrupy and I don't like fragrances with a finish like that. 6/10

• *Colognisé* - In a very similar vein to fragrances like Neroli Portofino and Acqua di Parma's Colonia Essenza, but I think this blends the florals and citruses considerably better. It's a scent profile I consider boring but I find this version more interesting. 8/10

• *Safran Colognisé* - I don't smell that much saffron at all. The rest of the scent is a classic cologne scent through and through and it's extremely well done. 8.5/10

• *Ani* - Very vanillic and saffroney in the air, almost powdery, immediately made me think of Penhaligon's Trade Routes collection. This is a great combination of fruits, woods, vanilla and spices, I can totally see why this is as liked as it is. 9/10

• *EGE / ΑΙΓΑΙΟ* - I can definitely smell mint. Smells quite herbal but fresh, it's like Torino21's more mature cousin. It does smell slightly medicinal because of the licorice note. As it dries I can smell something similar to L'Immensité's gross watery note, so I might not like this. 5/10

• *Nefs* - Boozy, woody, floral, smells very refined. I think I'll like this one a lot after a full wear. 8/10

• *Shem* - Very floral, especially rose, and cardamom. The opening might come off feminine but it gets overtaken by loads of amber and vetiver as it dries. 8/10

• *Unutamam* - Very strong herbs, this almost smells like something you cooked with too much oregano. Not bad but hard to pull off. 7/10

• *Nanshe* - Powdery, floral and a bit fruity. Nishane rɛally likes this scent profile for their feminine scents. Still a good fragrance. 8/10

As you can see from most of my reviews, I didn't dissect Nishane's fragrances by pointing out specific notes like I do with a lot of other brands and it's because, like Amouage, their blends are exceptional. The quality is there, down to the incredible presentation of the discovery set. There are several fragrances here I can totally see myself purchasing in the future, which is rare as most of the times I only have one, maybe two at best, that I might consider purchasing after trying out a brand extensively like this.

I will definitely purchase their X Collection and Time Capsule Collection sets as I'm very interested in continuing to sample Nishane. If anyone knows where I can get these sets in the US to potentially save $38 of shipping from Turkey (I'm assuming Nishane ships from there), I'd greatly appreciate it.",8,1751313025.0,Colognes,2,1.0,False

1lohbll,https://www.reddit.com/r/HouseholdIntel/comments/1lohbll/does_the_fellow_stagg_ekg_pro_kettle_deliver_the/,Does the Fellow Stagg EKG Pro Kettle Deliver the Best Brewing Experience?,"The Fellow 1171PRO-MB electric kettle caught my eye because I’ve been searching for something that combines precision, speed, and style. After spending a month using this kettle daily—for my morning teas, French press coffee sessions, and quick soups—I've got plenty to share about what this sleek device brings to the table.

**Design That Commands Attention**

Right out of the box, the matte black finish of this electric kettle feels premium and modern. It’s not every day you come across a product that manages to look this chic while sitting on your kitchen counter. The compact shape fits neatly into my space without hogging up too much room. I couldn’t help but admire the wide spout and ergonomic handle, which not only add to its design appeal but are thoughtfully crafted for a comfortable grip. The high-res color LCD screen on the base is another standout feature, presenting settings and information in a crisp, easy-to-understand layout.

[Check Fellow 1171PRO-MB price on Amazon.](https://tastyshow.com/p/b0bz59157h/)

**Performance That Exceeds Expectations**

What impressed me the most about this electric kettle is its exceptional temperature control. Whether it’s 180°F for green tea or 205°F for blooming a French press, the dial control makes hitting precise temperatures effortless. I’ve tested the quick heat function numerous times, and it consistently brings water to a boil faster than any kettle I’ve owned before. Plus, the temperature holds steady for up to 60 minutes in Hold Mode, a lifesaver when multitasking in the kitchen.

**Features Tailored for You**

The familiar beeping sound when the water reaches the desired temperature, which you can adjust or silence, is another thoughtful touch. Setting schedules and preferences through the full-color display felt intuitive. I noticed some nifty extras, like altitude settings and the clock display, offering customization I hadn’t even realized I needed. The Brew Stopwatch helped me nail down steeping times for my teas perfectly. It’s clear the creators designed this kettle to enhance every detail of the brewing experience.

**Positives**

- Precise to-the-degree temperature control  
- Quick heating feature saves plenty of time in busy mornings  
- High-res display makes it simple to navigate settings  
- Sleek, compact design that elevates any kitchen aesthetic  

**Weaknesses**

- Exterior can get a bit smudgy, especially with fingerprints  
- Not dishwasher safe, requiring occasional care and maintenance   

**Built for Longevity**

Looking beyond aesthetics, this kettle is built like a tank. The 304 18/8 stainless steel body doesn’t just look fantastic—it ensures durability over the long haul. The plastic handle felt robust during usage and didn’t heat up excessively while pouring. I did have to handwash it as the product isn’t dishwasher safe, but maintenance was straightforward.

**Competing Brands**

When compared to other kettles like the Breville Smart Kettle Luxe or the OXO Brew Adjustable Temperature Kettle, the Fellow model stands out for its striking design and precise temperature control. Breville offers a larger capacity, which might appeal to those with bigger families; however, its design doesn’t match the refined aesthetic of the Fellow kettle. OXO leans toward affordability but lacks the same level of build quality and customization. I'd still pick this kettle for its advanced features and longevity.

**True Value**

Given how much I use this kettle daily, it feels like an investment rather than an expense. While the price might be higher than simpler kettles, what you’re paying for here is unmatched precision, durability, and elegance. Comparable features offered by other electric kettles often come with compromises in either design or functionality. If you’re passionate about brewing tea or coffee with exact temperatures or enjoy the convenience of tailored settings, this kettle is truly worth it.

So i (M26) was dating a girl (F24) for about 2 weeks and she was totally into me and I was totally into her. Lots of contact, very easy talks for hours upon hours when together, good intimacy, great sex and a lot of interest in eachother. Then, after 2 weeks, we had another date. It was great again, but the day after she felt distant. We had a conversation about things moving quickly, so it was okay with me that she found some space for herself and I just let her. That went on for 3 days until she confessed she had to re-evaluate the situation for herself. 

Contact kinda started up again, we saw eachother shortly the next day for a coffee. Nothing seemed weird besides her being stressed for her exams the next day. 

Last sunday, she suddenly said this was it for her and that she's missing the romantic click. 

I am a bit heartbroken, I'm not gonna lie. This one ticked all my boxes. I was falling for her pretty hard. 

Now, I know it's not my fault, and I can let my feelings be there but I do notice myself trying to find other dates quickly. I'm scared my way of bonding in love is fucked up. I really wanna have kids and 1 wife for the rest of my life. ",1,1751312884.0,dating_advice,4,1.0,False

Besides writing alot more; I remember and realize this talent again; my original dream that I had denied myself; I wanted to make jewelry and already being a widely published writer; I wanted to write my own books/novels... and travel and sell jewelry at music events from my car... (I maybe don't want to do the music festival thing so crazy, but from a removed entrepreneurial standpoint, and also to maybe get back into flow art l, of course). I finally allowed myself to remember... I counted how many peices of jewelry I have made/remade in the past couple of weeks or so (8). I am getting better and faster at it each day... I've always made necklaces and bracelets for my friends, ever since I was a kid, and again during/after highschool...

I am surrounded by artists now... and they just laugh and play sports when they aren't working or making art... humans were meant to live like this... while writing this I got a new idea for another bracelet and became longing for materials.

I allowed myself to remember I am fleak and fleet footed on the field; even at mid 30s. I need some practice/soft cleats... I destroyed a pro set of athletic shoes in one session... wow...

I have been asking God for guidance; I'm finally hearing/reading about Aaron in the book of Alma... it is crazy, I feel elements of myself and my story in these chapters, it is very uncanny. I'm sleeping In alot more now too...  no more coffee; no more tea, no more beer to fall asleep, this promise I vow to keep... it's hard, but worth it.
I need to pray about this; all of it.
I am nervous about my next interview at the church, idk if it is today or when... I get nervous the church will reject me, and I pray that they won't; I get a buzzing feeling washing over me telling me it's going to be okay, and that I am loved no matter what. And if things fail there, I am forever grateful to the two sisters who helped me out of the darkness, if I do have to leave them one day, they reminded me of who I truly need to be; they are bringing back my true gift of tongues, I was speaking Spanish and French yesterday, I broke my streak on duo for everything (including arabic,needed a break), but I think I will add Spanish as well, just to keep the language juices flowing. I would love to go on mission knowing all those languages, I wonder where they would send me... if all fails, I can always go back to my roots as a 4square/non-denominational christian; we're very adaptive like that. But I really want this to be home, this feels like home. I also want to research seers in the church as well... and see what I find about that. Maybe after becoming a missionary, my calling might be as a seer? I'm curious... and seers in my original faith/doctrine are forbidden... I wonder... I must pray about this as well.

I think I am going to watch some videos about these things ( Aaron/ Alma); and read more today after that; then play video games (on my phone); get rid of my TV (dont want it no more), budget for gas and food for the next two days, start going to the hot meal center (it keeps me humble and saves money).

This phone is going to be permanently shut off soon. Then both phones will get wiped again before I change to a completely new phone and number/email address/everything; I might even change my name if it's not too expensive; and then hopefully passports; maybe change the name after passports idk, that still depends on some things ... all old things are fading into the blackness and disappearing; and I will rise anew. This is the muddy black water, I am almost fully submerged... this is the dark ritual made into light.

This is what inevitable truly looks like lol, this is what happens when I work together with god... and God within me...

He took so much from me that I feel like a shell of myself. He made me forget who I was. I’ve always been independent, insightful, creative and curious about the world. I’m educated and have a good job and I’ve studied and worked abroad multiple times, I’m well travelled, well read, well liked by family and friends and still this happened to me.

He started off being loving and supportive. I pursued an international opportunity while we were engaged. He supported me and I came back early to be with him. He picked me up from the airport with flowers every time. We went on hikes, coffee dates, fancy dinners and I finally felt loved and seen. He started dressing the way I did, getting into art and design and watching the movies I liked, eating the food I ate. He got to know my family and spent time with my friends. We had nicknames, routines, we spent every minute together.

It started off slowly, him going back on promises, putting my needs second to his, making me live in his parents basement, exploiting my empathy. He was repeatedly unemployed, financially reckless, trying to take money from me, threatening to take my assets if I left, telling me no one else would want me, humiliating me and talking about me behind my back with his family, making me feel bad for not being a traditional women, undervaluing my achievements and the effort I put into the relationship. He swore at me, called me awful names, made me feel small. Threatened to kick me out or drop me back at my parents house.

When I stood up for myself and had enough of it, he agreed to move out with me. I thought I was taking control of my life back. I paid for couples therapy I tried to communicate better. Then he became physically aggressive, he dragged me out of a room, violently kicked a door on holiday, he minimized everything, showed no remorse and still I let him back into my life. My brother stood up for me and he kicked us out of my home, attacked my brother and pushed me to the floor. That’s when I left.

And still I was second guessing everything, giving him the benefit of the doubt. But today I’m choosing myself, I’m choosing peace and I’m choosing to rebuild my life far away from him. I’ll never let anyone make me feel small again. I never imagined this would happen to me, but it did and it scares me that someone could try to take someone who was bright and beautiful and try to destroy them.

1logyvz,https://www.reddit.com/r/Antipsychiatry/comments/1logyvz/friends_on_psych_meds/,Friends on Psych Meds,"I had bad experiences with psychiatry at a young age, and I also studied psychology for myself (I have a degree and I have done a lot of my own research). While I am not against psychiatry entirely, I think mainstream psychiatry is questionable at best, and I'm critical of psych meds. 

I don't think I'm the final arbitor of whether a drug works for someone. I'm sure there's cases where a drug could help with a mental health crisis. I also feel uncomfortable telling other people they're wrong about their own experience. However, MY experience with psych meds was terrible, I haven't seen much evidence of their long-term efficacy, and none of the people I know who take meds are ""cured."" In fact, all of them are still having regular mental health crises + dealing with the (often serious) side effects that come with the drugs they take. Still, they persist in believing that their drugs are ""fixing"" them and they'd be in an even worse state without them. 

I don't say anything because I don't want to get into an argument and I don't want to be seen as ""paranoid"" and ""anti-science."" But it is really hard for me to sit and watch people fail to connect the dots. It reminds me of a friend of mine who abused caffeine to a dangerous degree. He had terrible heartburn, racing heart, difficulty sleeping, irritability, etc., but he refused to admit there was any connection to the fact that he had 5+ cups of coffee a day/frequently injested energy drinks.

Right now I have a friend who has severe anxiety, muscle tension, and acid reflux so bad that she lost her ability to speak for almost an entire YEAR. I found out she's on Effexor, has been for a long time. I looked it up and yes, Effexor can cause muscle tension and acid reflux. Her anxiety has not been cured by the medication, so her doctor told her to up the dose. I felt terrible hearing that. I wanted to say, please don't do that, don't you see it's only going to make the problem worse? And yes, after almost doubling the dose, she's been having panic attacks, racing heart, and even more problems with her voice. But today she told me her doctor said those symptoms will ""go away"" eventually so she's going to keep taking the higher dose. I fear that even if she decides to stop taking the med, she's just going to replace it with another one--actually I think she's on several different medications. She once told me she wants a pill to make the feelings go away.

People get so defensive about this stuff. If I give her my true opinion, that not only are the meds not working, but it's unhealthy to try to use drugs to solve emotional problems, she's going to get upset with me. I might even get called ableist. And you know, I'd be more willing to consider that I'm wrong if I saw any evidence that these drugs worked, but this exact scenario has played out so many times right in front of my eyes. It's heartbreaking to watch. ",3,1751312171.0,Antipsychiatry,0,1.0,False

I’d describe myself as more on the quiet and introverted side and I do enjoy deep conversations and authenticity. Also I am 200 percent fine with talks for hours about stuff that is technically useless, but rabbit hole like-interesting or silly, or random. So I am generally a bit more shy, but definitely lively and funny when the vibe is right!

In my free time, in regards to sports, I go to the gym regularly and practice archery about three times a week. I do not look like that yet though, so do not get too excited just now already haha

I also love spending time in nature.. whether it’s hiking or just taking a walk in some peaceful and nice environment. Also, I’m definitely a tea person, I do tolerate coffee people though (I even like coffee, but don’t tell the other tea people), i love to read although I probably spend more time looking for good books than actually reading and one day I’d love to have pets. Short travels or trips are also always nice and I like to see new places when it is possible!

Now to wrap and lighten it up a tiny bit, as I mentioned at the start, I also love learning more or less useful information, about more or less relevant topics.

I had no intention of losing weight. I'm M, 41, 60kg/132lb and already slim, and am trying to build muscle. But I found myself accidentally losing weight because (for my own reasons) I swapped out breakfast for a hot cocoa powder drink. I thought I would share to everyone out there who are looking for simple ways to lose weight. I'm not calling it hot chocolate, because there's no sugar in it:

\- Add to a decent sized mug 2 rounded dessert spoons of 100% cocoa powder (or cacao - it doesn't matter, just go for the cheapest, it's all basically the same stuff. I buy 1kg bags of it now. You can get it in health food shops or big supermarkets)

\- Then add mostly boiling water, give it a good stir. Then leave it for say 3-5 mins, as the water breaks down the clumps, and then stir it again (this is to avoid having to dick around making a paste) and topped off with oat milk, barista edition, as you might with a tea.

What I found is that the cocoa (if you stick with it for the first week) works well to fill you up until lunchtime. So this is basically a kind of fairly easy daily fast (obviously not a strict one). You might also find you eat a bit more in the evening, but that settles down over time. 

You may have to get used to the taste, but it's a bit like having tea or coffee without sugar for the first time - it's a bit weird until you just get used to it, and then it flips, and the sugar version becomes the nasty one. I find it genuinely delicious. Cocoa is mildly stimulating and has some caffeine in it so also wakes you up. 

It may not work for you, but the worse that will have happened is that you've had some morning cocoa a few times. Obvoiusly combine this with healthy eating (fresh food, low/no sugar, don't go mad on the carbs), exercise, hydration, sleep etc. Another factor is that I don't have carbs at lunch usually just protein (eggs, tinned fish, etc) with salad, because carbs were making me sleepy. I eat a normal healthy home-cooked dinner. 

Advanced level: I've since found that I can now just have a tea in the morning and still not really be hungry until lunch (which didn't work for me when I'd tried previously, I would get headaches from not eating, and I'd feel unpleasantly hungry). Couldn't have got there without cocoa.

So, last night and tonight, a couple areas of asphalt are being slurried (re-tarring the asphalt). Last night was the ER driveway and ambulance bay. Because of this, ambulances were required to come in via the upstairs main entrance. Being security, I was posted at the main lobby desk to assist EMS and other potential patients/guests to the ER (for some context, **I was alone**. Staffing sucks, especially my department).

The main entrance is right next to the chapel, and at the end of the hall opposite the main hallway is the lower rooms of the chapel (where priests and later OB/GYN doctors would stay overnight. That’s a whole other creepy area I have stories about).

The chapel is a historic building that’s connected to the modern hospital. Built in 18-something. It’s closed to the public because an earthquake a few years back caused damage and the risk of the balcony detaching and collapsing. Only security, maintenance, and a few choice admins are allowed access.

Anywho, I’m chilling at the desk, stupidly watching Tragic Tales, Abyssal Detective, and the occasional The Paranormal Files (because I’m a very disturbed person lol). It’s roughly 03:34, and there hasn’t been another soul in sight for a good hour or two.

I heard tapping coming from the hallway towards the chapel. Now, this could’ve been anything. I’m seated beside a decorative water feature, the air circulation system isn’t the quietest, and from somewhere within the gift shop/pharmacy and coffee shop is a beep from an alarm system.

But this was distinct tapping, like someone impatiently tapping their foot. It wasn’t consistent, maybe two or three taps every few seconds. Then there was the rustling of papers. This is what pulled me away from my not so comfy chair.

I rounded the corner, ready to throw hands, and found… Nobody. Absolutely nothing. I went back to the desk, but I was feeling too restless to sit, so I went out for a smoke break. I didn’t want to go far from the entrance, so I sat on a bench in the little brick patio area.

Out of sheer, stupid curiosity, I shined my flashlight up at the top windows of the chapel, the stained glass ones that are where the services used to be held. My flashlight is maybe a little dimmer than the sun. I can seriously blind someone with it on its highest setting.

Nothing unusual, just the ornate panels depicting the apostles or whoever they are (I’m not religious anymore, definitely know nothing about Catholicism).

I moved my beam to the back windows where the small corridor is behind the podium (the little area that has the hazardously narrow staircase leading down to the lower floor) and I saw movement. A shadow, but definitely human shaped. Great, now I have to go inspect it…

I’ve encountered homeless people who’ve entered through the crawlspace below the chapel, so there was no way in hell I was going alone. I called my “big bro” in ICU who loves getting involved with security affairs. Big dude, 6’2 maybe, somewhere between 200-220 lbs of very little fat and mainly muscle.

Instant yes, he meets me in the main lobby. We go into the chapel through the lower floor to walk through the rooms and exit through the congregation area. We don’t find anything in the lower area. As we’re walking through the rows of pews upstairs, we both start to notice something: fresh prints in the distance on the pews.

Like, butt cheeks and hand prints. Then we hear the tapping. It’s a bit muffled, the floor has thin carpeting on it. But it’s enough to scare even big bro. We leave immediately, and I lock the doors behind us. I’ve never seen big bro scared like that, he’s usually so gung-ho about stuff.

I don’t think I’ll ever go in there by myself again, and I highly doubt big bro will return even in the daylight.

I really with I could post pics, but sadly… I cannot. They were very distinct. Thankfully, last night is the only night I had to be up in the main lobby. I think I’ll spend tonight in the ER where my worst fears are getting beaten up by the drunks and druggies.",2,1751311468.0,TrueScaryStories,0,1.0,False

1logne6,https://www.reddit.com/r/ChronicIllness/comments/1logne6/feeling_lost_and_misunderstood_by_friends/,feeling lost and misunderstood by friends,"hello, if you don’t mind i just need to rant a little. 

i haven’t been doing so well lately, even to the point that two friends from abroad wanted to come visit me so that i’m not alone. initially i was hesitant bc i struggle accepting help from others and i don’t want to be a burden. but im also going to therapy and trying to be better so i accepted their offer to come visit me for a few days and i even got excited to see them.

over the past months i have been mentioning to them that my body is overall exhausted, that i sleep 15 hours a day and during flare ups im in so much pain i cannot even make myself a sandwich. basically i can barely take care of myself and i told them that every single action that is part of normal everyday feels like a big project to me and i need to take a nap after. aka i need to choose if i want to brush my teeth, take a shower, do the dishes, prepare a proper meal, do laundry or order groceries online for the day bc i simple can’t manage to do more than one on one day. recently i have also been struggling to eat due to a change in medication, so now i have days in a row where i don’t eat, and then i only have a baby jar sometime during the week. 

before they visited i asked them multiple times what they want to do here, id they want to go to the beach, the mountains, do sightseeing, something more relaxed or more adventurous. i asked them so many times that i felt i annoyed them but i just wanted to plan something nice for them. they always said i should not worry, they are coming to support me and we can just go to the beach and sleep all day. even when it came to food choices bc i told them im not in the position to cook they couldn’t give me an answer. so i thought ok maybe they really just want to come and be here and have a chill time together.

now they arrived two days ago and i cannot handle it anymore. All of a sudden its “so what did you plan for us while we’re here” and “let’s do sunrise this and sunrise that and sightseeing here and i want to go to this place and here and there and everything. it’s like they arrived and vacation mode turned on. mind you, i told them multiple times that i have doctors appointments every day and if they want they can go to the beach and i join them afterwards (bc i thought they really just wanted to have beach days). they responded no don’t worry we’ll come with you to support you and hold your hand and then we can see what we feel like doing. 

now here’s how the last days went: 
we went to the beach one day for about two hours and then we had to rush home bc they weren’t feeling it anymore. just getting ready and the transport to the beach was already so exhausting to me that i needed to take a nap, but didn’t get to bc we didn’t stay too long (i went into the water bc i had to cool down, my body can’t control body temperature in the current heat and with my meds). when we were home they wanted to get dressed and go out and i already asked them to slow down a little bc it was getting too much for me. in this moment i felt like i ruined their mood. they said yes ok we can relax a little at home but they increasingly talked about getting ready and who gets to take a shower first that i felt pressured to give in and again didn’t get to take a nap that i desperately needed. i wanted to show them a nice neighborhood close to mine where there is different markets and many bars and restaurants and overall just a very nice vibe but without tourists. they increasingly got into a bad mood and only wanted to have dinner, i had a drink myself just to be able to deal with everything and was starting to feel better and told them about all the different places we can go in the neighborhood but they didn’t want to so we just went home. as soon as we arrived i immediately crashed on the sofa (i gave them my bedroom).

today i had an doctor appointment, they left the house early to do sightseeing and idk what. we wanted to meet after my appointment and i send them the location of the doctors office and a coffee shop nearby that i always go to calm down after appointments. in the end i was so tired i almost passed out in the coffee shop before they arrived snd told them im sorry but i had to go home. i was sleeping all day, woke up with my whole body in pain which is never a good sign and now i just feel completely destroyed. they came back early evening, i told them i was sleeping till now and tbh i clearly didn’t look or sounded well. they didn’t even ask how i was feeling or why i had to go home early and just went to their room to relax too. 

yesterday they talked about cooking together and having big dinner at home but i told them it’s too much work for me, buying groceries, cooking, cleaning (i don’t have a dish washer), everything is just too much and it’s much easier to just go to the restaurant downstairs (there are tons) and go back home when i’m exhausted, even if we do all the stuff together. when they came back early evening today they brought groceries. i was on the sofa half asleep, half awake in agonizing pain when they started cooking. i told them im not hungry and i already tried to eat a little earlier and that the leftovers are in the fridge they should have them. now i felt they got angry or disappointed with me that they cooked a fancy meal for me but i didn’t eat it. bc i am in so much pain i couldn’t even join them on the balcony to just talk and have dinner. i got a weird look and now after dinner they don’t even want to sit with me inside on the sofa but just go outside alone. they said i should drink a coffee to wake up (it’s almost 10 pm but also after everything i explained to them about my health they should know my sleeping is not bc of lack of coffee?). 

i overheard them making plans for the next days and it seems like i have to go to the hospital alone and no one’s gonna hold my hand. honestly when they arrived and i noticed they did want indeed to do sightseeing and stuff i told them its ok they should make plans and just go to my appointments. i’m still a bit sad though bc idk from what we talked about their trip before they arrived i expected a little different experience.

now i just feel so alone and so misunderstood. one of the girls is the first girl i ever opened up about my situation and how bad it really is, but it seems like they still don’t understand that when i say i sleep 15 hours a day i actually do sleep 15 hours. or that i cannot manage a 10 minute walk without taking two breaks sitting down. or that when i say i cannot eat that i actually don’t eat. and that when i say my medication makes me overheat and stop regulating body temperature i’m actually dying and sweating like crazy and please please please just let me turn on the ac in my own apartment. 

i’m sorry that’s a long rant. i just needed to let it out somewhere. just typing this takes so long my arms and hands hurt so much. thank you if you read ",2,1751311406.0,ChronicIllness,0,1.0,False

* **Anime**: Currently watching The Apothecary Diaries, feels like there hasn't been much on this season. Let's chat about our favourite anime and exchange recommendations?
* **Lego**: Architecture, Star Wars and anything else that's cool to display. I may or may not be planning to have a Lego room in my next house
* **TCGs**: Pokemon and classic Digimon card collector, against my better judgment I'm thinking of getting back into Yu-Gi-Oh!
* **Archery**: I shoot at things, sometimes I hit them
* **DIY**: Bought a house 2 years ago, and might have finally run out of DIY. You get bonus points if you correctly guess how many holes the previous owners drilled for a single shelf
* **Pianist**: Occasionally the noises I make sound like anime songs
* **Reading**: I'm in my psychology/mental health/self-development/productivity phase. The Solo Leveling omnibus novel is also looking at me menacingly
* **Technology**: A general interest in computers, which ranges from gaming to building computers to home servers. And my day job is hacking
* **Sci-Fi and Fantasy**: The usual culprits like Star Wars and Lord of the Rings
* **Japanese**: Plan to travel to Japan one day and would like to be at least conversationally proficient
* **Being a functional adult**: Cooking, cleaning, ironing, I can do it all. If I don't know something, I'll go learn
* Making lists and collecting hobbies...

About me:

* White, British, 6'2"" with a slim build. Open to exchanging photos as we get to know each other
* I live in Hampshire. Open to long distance if there's potential to meet eventually and we put the effort into making it work
* Non-smoker and I don't drink. I generally prefer days out and nights in
* I'm open to having children but it'll need to be a ""hell yes"", equally fine never having kids. My focus right now is on finding someone I'd want to spend the rest of my life with
* I'm a big texter but also up for calls and video chats when we're comfortable with each other
* Don't really have just one love language, I'm physically affectionate and a big fan of holding hands when out and about. Quality time together and words of affirmation are also ways to my heart. I express my love with a bit of everything
* I'd describe myself as quite ambitious, always striving to be better. I also (usually) know when to slow down
* Not into alcoholic, hot or fizzy drinks. So when I propose coffee and cake for our first date, just know I'll actually be drinking apple juice. Walks in the part to feed ducks and other casual activity dates also welcome. Or we can just skip to doing a couples cosplay at comic con

Thoughts on relationships:

* Smoking, vaping and drugs are dealbreakers
* Looking for someone at a similar stage in life and generally set my age preference on dating sites to 25 - 33. Not a dealbreaker though if the vibe is good
* I'm open to chatting with people outside the UK, but my expectations of it turning into anything serious are low. Feel free to try convince me otherwise, but you'll have to put a lot of effort in
* Communication is really important to me and something I actively want to get better at as well. Low effort first messages are unlikely to get a reply. Prove to me you've actually read my post. Conversely, high effort first messages are basically guaranteed to get us chatting
* Some shared hobbies and values are nice but I also want to know what you're into. It's expected that part of being in a relationship is doing your own thing, but spending time together on shared hobbies is nice as well
* I'm a complete person and hopefully so are you. Together, we could be more than the sum of our parts

And yet... your local Waffle House still stands.

You are employees and regulars; servers, short-order cooks, truckers, psychics, hunters all trapped in this neon-lit sanctuary off Exit 13. For reasons unknown, the Waffle House seems protected. For now.

As the world falls apart outside, you must defend the diner from supernatural assaults, uncover secrets buried in syrup and silverware, and find a way to reverse the apocalypse before the last coffee pot runs dry. Whether you’re flipping pancakes or facing down ancient evil, one thing is clear:

This Waffle House is humanity’s last stand.

A few months ago, I joined a large agency. It was my first time working in a big shit creative agency. I was new, overwhelmed, and just trying to survive.

During one of the first office hangouts, I met this guy let’s call him Ayaan. He was wearing a Swiggy delivery jacket as a joke. I remember looking at him and thinking, “He’s too polished to be a delivery guy,” which he caught and laughed at. That was our first actual exchange. I casually asked him if he sings, he asked me “Why’d ask that” and I said “You got a nice voice” (I was very serious here, and not flirtatious) 

Apparently, that one compliment was enough for him to latch on.

The very next day, he asked for my number and before I could say anything, he pulled it from our office WhatsApp group without my consent. He also stalked my Instagram even though I hadn’t shared it with him. He started messaging me constantly asking me out for coffee, lunch, dinner, hangouts after work.

I said no to everything, consistently and politely. But he just would not stop. Every day, a new excuse to text or corner me at work. I didn’t want to be rude, I was still new and didn’t want to create unnecessary awkwardness but he kept pushing.

Eventually (after a month or so), I said yes to a movie. Not because I wanted to go — I didn’t. I just thought if I gave him that one chance, he’d finally leave me alone. I was tired and honestly just wanted it to stop. Also I kinda felt guilty for some reason. 

The date was horrible. He showed up high, red eyes, reeking of weed. Afterward, we grabbed food. There all he did was talk about his exes, his childhood trauma, how many girls he dated, how he even dated an actress but she turned bi and I was like Ok?!? And I dropped multiple hints that I wanted to go home. Told him it was getting late. Said my mom was calling. Even stood up to leave.

He ignored everything. Brushed it off with jokes. At one point, he said, “Let me talk to your mom, I’ll tell her I’m taking care of her daughter.” I was creeped out.

When we finally left the restaurant, I walked to my car, got in, and even started it. He walked up and literally stopped me from leaving. Then stood around outside smoking a cigarette and dragging the goodbye for another 20 minutes while I stood there, deeply uncomfortable.

He kept texting afterward. Begged me to watch Minions with him insisted on coming to my house late at night. I said no. He pushed. “Your family’s in town? So what?” When that didn’t work, he asked if we could FaceTime and watch it together. I kept refusing, but he wouldn’t let it go. Eventually, just to make it stop, I gave in once. And that was my mistake. I thought giving him closure would end it. Instead, it made him believe he had access.

And then it crossed into another line of disrespect.

And when I eventually ended all of it by saying “ I can’t do this, I don’t want any part of this”. He had the audacity to ask me “like you don’t want a part of this ever? Like you know I can easily pester you but I don’t. Are you sure, you don’t want this?” And I said “Yes, I don’t”

Things just escalated after this. 

He found my private YouTube channel something I use to post skits and reaction videos, a space I deliberately keep away from work. He not only watched it, but loudly called it out in front of the whole creative team: “Your video popped up in my recommendations,” he smirked. Everyone turned to look. He knew exactly what he was doing.

After that, the taunts started.

He gave me a made-up nickname from one of my videos “Jabudaya.” Said I looked like a 14-year-old boy. Mocked my work. Interrupted shoots I was leading. Tried to outtalk me in meetings. When I told him to stop, he said it was all just “fun.” But it never felt like fun. It felt targeted.

One time, right after lunch, he looked straight at me from across the room and yelled, “Catch!” then threw two rotis at me wrapped in foil. I was shocked and disgusted. I didn’t catch them. He walked over, placed them on my desk, and said, “If you don’t want them, feed them to the dogs.”

I told him, “I’m not taking that. Keep it away from me.”

He just smirked and said, “Well, J asked me to give it to you, so if you have something to say, go talk to her,” and walked away like it was all one big joke.

There were people around. I felt humiliated.

This is someone who brags about drinking, smokes weed constantly, and once told me, “I can’t even poop without smoking first.” He trauma-dumps constantly. Talks about how no girl sticks around. On our one and only date, he told me about how he’d tried to get with other women at work too.

After me, he moved on to an intern. Then another girl.

Why am I sharing this?

Because for the longest time, I thought maybe I was overreacting. Maybe I should’ve been firmer. Maybe it was my fault for saying yes to that one date. But here’s the thing I said no over and over again. He didn’t care. He took my number without consent. He stalked my social media. He mocked me publicly. I tried to keep the peace, and he took that as an invitation.

I’m done trying to justify my boundaries.

If anyone out there has ever felt like they were “too polite” or “too nice” to be taken seriously you’re not the problem. The person ignoring your boundaries is.

I did a full sweep by category (books, cables, kitchen gadgets, even paperwork) and ended up donating or tossing nearly 20% of my things. I also labeled boxes with both room and contents (Kitchen – Coffee Station Stuff) and numbered them so unpacking felt like a checklist instead of chaos.

Another decision I’m really glad I made hiring help instead of DIY-ing the whole thing. I used a local team called [BoxStar Movers](https://boxstarmovers.com) who not only handled the heavy lifting, but offered packing and junk removal too, which saved me days of work. Their crew was on time, careful with the fragile stuff, and didn’t make me feel rushed or clueless which I’ve dealt with before.  


Even after settling in, I’ve stayed more organized than I expected. It’s probably because I actually started fresh without dragging clutter with me. If you're moving soon, my advice downsize early, label obsessively, and don’t be afraid to get help. It really makes the whole thing feel doable.",1,1751310674.0,organized,0,1.0,False
1logc8p,https://www.reddit.com/r/Literature_writing/comments/1logc8p/derivative_chainsaw_concerto/,Derivative Chainsaw Concerto,"The day was crawling in, bleeding light through the grimy bedroom window. There I was, sprawled out in my bed, stripped down to my raw meat, trying to catch some sleep after yet another night of debauchery.

I plopped my head on the pillow, ready to drift into oblivion when someone outside started making a ruckus, wielding a chainsaw or some other gardening tool. It's that scum-sucking waste of air that's my neighbour. He had been a pain in the arse since I moved in. I tried to ignore him, but it was getting unbearable. My nerves were frayed.

""Fucking hell,"" I muttered, climbing out of bed and pulling on my clothes so I'm not flashing it for anyone driving by. 

I grabbed my bat from under the bed and headed downstairs. Time to pay him a visit.

My boots pounded across the yard then vaulted over the fence into his garden. There he was revving his chainsaw, looking like a rejected member of the village idiots' society.

I hesitated for a second. Should I talk to him? No, to hell with that. Reasoning with him would just lead to more bullshit.

In a flash, I leaped onto him and swung that bat, fueled by the rage bursting inside me, a blur of motion aimed at his head. He didn't have time to react. My swing connected with his face, and his teeth shattered like glass. Blood sprayed like confetti everywhere on the lawn. He fell to the ground, writhing like a dying fish.

I looked around. There was nobody, just him who'd tried to give me a morning concerto of his garden maintenance.

I walked back to my flat, feeling a bit better. I hoped nobody else would interrupt my sleep again. I stripped off my clothes once more, climbed into bed.

I tried to drift off, but sleep was eluding me. I felt an urge to check if he was still alive. I pulled on my clothes again and went back outside. There he still was, lying in a pool of his own blood.

I started giving him a good kicking in the ribs. An extra punishment for ruining my day. After a while, my foot was aching, and I had to call it quits. I dragged my arse back inside. I ain't sleeping anymore. He wrecked my whole day. I made myself a cup of coffee, turned on the TV, and watched some mindless crap while I drowned my irritation in more caffeine.

Me and s.o. love espresso. I drink it straight and she only drinks milk drinks. We each have 2 or 3 drinks per day, every day. (Oat). We live in the USA and I'm totally fed up with my Baratza Encore, classic. I need more ability to dial in. (My espresso machine is breville bambino original and it's good enough for now. Someday I'll get a real dual boiler machine, but for now I want i focus on my grinder upgrade.) That being said, we usually like medium, medium dark, and dark roasts. I've become enamored with the idea of lighter roasts but I'm convinced the baratza just cannot and will not grind light and medium light roasts correctly. I've tried a few light roast espressos that were awesome in coffee shops and I've been able to dial in a select few medium light roasts at home.

Here's where I'm at. I'm drawn to the niche zero because of its low retention and its reputation of being an excellent dark roast espresso grinder. But I'm tempted to get a flat burr grinder to try and experiment with lighter roasts. 

Is it true that dark roasts would work better through a conical burr grinder and that there is no such thing as a single grinder to fit all espresso needs, dark and light? Is there an espresso grinder that does all roast levels well? I'm not ready to buy yet, I'm still in it research phase and any practical advice or experience would be appreciated. If extending the budget to 12 or 1400 is going to make a significant impact, i can push a month or two and make that work. Thanks nerds. ",2,1751310378.0,espresso,4,1.0,False

Not the kind of dread you'd expect, but a strange, heavy calm. Today is my last day.

The sunlight filtering through my bedroom curtains looks different somehow—warmer, more golden. I can hear my neighbor starting his car for the morning commute, the same sound I've heard a thousand times before. But today, I really *hear* it. The ordinary rhythm of life continuing around me feels both heartbreaking and beautiful.

I make coffee, and it tastes different. Richer. More real. I find myself holding the mug with both hands, feeling its warmth, watching the steam rise. When did I stop noticing these small moments?

I call my sister. Not to say goodbye—that would terrify her—but just to hear her voice. She complains about her boss, her commute, the weather. I listen to every word like it's poetry. I tell her I love her before hanging up. She says it back, casual and warm, having no idea those three words just became the most precious thing in my world.

I sit in my backyard and watch the shadows of tree branches dance across the fence. A memory surfaces: being seven years old, lying in this same spot, watching clouds shape-shift overhead while my mom called me in for lunch. I can almost hear her voice carried on the wind. When did I stop lying in the grass? When did I stop seeing magic in moving shadows?

The afternoon stretches ahead, and I realize I don't want to skydive or travel to Paris or check items off some imaginary bucket list. I want to sit here. I want to text my old friend and tell him I'm sorry we lost touch. I want to listen to that song that always makes me cry. I want to call my dad and ask him about his childhood again, really listen this time instead of half-heartedly scrolling my phone.

A couple walks by, arguing about something trivial. I want to tell them to stop, to look at each other, really look. To remember that this moment—this ordinary Tuesday afternoon—is a gift they're unwrapping without even noticing.

As evening approaches, I feel no panic, no regret. Just a deep gratitude for every breath, every heartbeat, every mundane miracle I've been given. I understand now what people mean when they say life is precious. Not because of the big moments, but because of all the small ones we let slip by unnoticed.

I watch the sunset paint the sky in impossible colors. Tomorrow, other people will see this same sky, but most won't really see it. They'll be rushing, worrying, planning, missing the beauty right in front of them.

But here's the thing—and this is important—I don't actually know this is my last day. Neither do you. None of us do. We all live as if we have infinite tomorrows, but we don't. We have today. This moment. This breath.

You don't have to wait for a terminal diagnosis or a near-death experience to start living like this. You don't have to wait until it's too late to call that friend, to forgive that grudge, to watch that sunset with your full attention.

That coffee you're drinking while reading this? Taste it. The person you love sleeping next to you? Look at them, really look. The ordinary Tuesday stretching ahead of you? It's not ordinary at all. It's a gift.

Don't wait for your last day to start living. Start now. Before it's too late.

She's gained a ton of weight the past 2 years (60+ pounds) and while she does have some health issues (recently diagnosed Hashimoto's), she has a completely terrible diet and refuses to excersize. She counts her light walk on the treadmill (30 mins without breaking a sweat) as a ""hard workout"", and then says her weight gain has made her energy levels too low to try any harder.

I would have sympathy for her if it wasn't for her constant consumption of sugar and poor food choices. For example, her daily diet would look something like a coffee in the morning with a sweetened creamer AND sugar (probably a 300+calorie coffee) along with a ""healthy"" bagel with creme cheese (because you know, whole grains were on the food pyramid in the 90's so now you NEED them to be healthy...). After that, she always has a cup of juice in her hand alllll day long (she has made a comment that fruit juice is an ""easy"" way to get some fibre...). For lunch she will have something like a bowl of oatmeal and a muffin, then for dinner it's a t.v. Dinner style meal, or some sort of heat and serve meal, or a big plate of pasta and garlic bread. I don't think I've ever seen my parents slice veggies for a meal before, they dont own any kitchen knives and refuse to use the ones we buy them because they are ""too sharp"". Between all of these meals is constant snacking on again, processed junk food (granola bars, cookies, fruit snacks). 

It's gotten to a point that I have a hard time being around her because the complaining about her health problems and the ""poor me"" attitude is draining. She refuses to change anything while complaining that  nothing changes. What can I do to help her? She gets her diet advice from mainstream t.v. shows like good morning America and those panel doctor shows, or the first link on Google when she types things like ""can fruit juice be healthy"" and uses the results to justify juice. 

I'll also add I have a hard time sending my kid there for a visit because he comes home and has a hard time pooping from eating nothing but fruit snacks and cookies and candy for hours, and we don't buy that stuff at home. My parents have a weird thing about buying all kids of extremely shitty sugary food for their grandkids from the dollar store. My sister's son who is watched by them often has most of his teeth rotted or capped due to cavities from the non stop shit food and pop they give him. Ugh, just needed to rant 😅

He carried himself with a kind of presence that made people listen, and he was more attentive to students than others. He even openly told us that his brother is gay and that he has no problem with it.

At first, I didn’t really care much for his class. I was bored, I didn’t pay much attention. That changed when I realized I needed to focus more or I’d fall behind badly. So, I made an effort. I went up to him and asked how I could improve in the class, and I followed his advice.

Then something shifted. I started noticing that he would look at me a lot during class. Maybe he always did, but I only became aware of it later. Sometimes he made little remarks during his explanations that seemed like they were about me, but I wasn’t sure. His gaze was intense, dominant. I felt nervous when he looked at me. I couldn’t hold eye contact without fidgeting or looking away.

To be honest, I'm into men. And this professor.. he’s in his 40s, (looks younger) married, works out, and looks great.

I’m a pretty shy guy and not very talkative, so I never really flirted or said anything weird. But I think I subconsciously tried to dress nicely or look good for his class, hoping he’d notice.

Subject: Plea for Employee Protection During Extreme Weather

Dear Dutch Bros Leadership Team,

I’m writing as a loyal Dutch Bros customer and someone who deeply respects the positive culture you’ve cultivated—one centered on energy, kindness, and community. That’s why I feel compelled to reach out with a serious concern: the safety and well-being of your employees during extreme weather conditions.

While I love the upbeat environment Dutch Bros is known for, I’ve witnessed your employees working through dangerous heat and heavy rain with little protection. It’s hard to reconcile this with the values your brand represents.

On days where temperatures soar past 100°F, employees are often out in full sun with limited access to shade or cooling. Studies from OSHA and the CDC clearly show that prolonged exposure to high heat (especially over 103°F) increases the risk of heat exhaustion, dehydration, and even heatstroke. These are serious, preventable dangers.

Rain poses its own risks—slippery surfaces, cold stress, and illness when workers aren’t adequately protected. Yet, I’ve seen staff members outside with minimal rain gear, still expected to smile and serve in soaking conditions. It just doesn’t seem necessary—especially when your stands are already equipped with outdoor speakers and a friendly drive-thru experience that doesn’t rely on workers being exposed.

Dutch Bros has the power—and the responsibility—to lead by example in the coffee industry. I respectfully urge you to consider the following actions:

Bring employees indoors or limit exposure when temperatures exceed 103°F

Invest in high-quality, waterproof rain gear for all outdoor employees

Re-evaluate shift lengths and breaks during high heat and wet weather

Use your speaker systems to maintain great service without risking safety

These aren’t just practical steps—they're a reflection of the care and community Dutch Bros is known for. Your team members are the heartbeat of your brand. Protecting them during dangerous weather isn’t just about compliance or public image; it’s about doing what’s right.

Thank you for taking this seriously. I believe in Dutch Bros and hope you’ll take steps to lead the way in employee protection—just as you lead in energy and joy.

With appreciation and concern,

It's been a long process of over a month, and at the moment I am down to one cup of decaf a day, with the idea of completely cutting coffee off this time next week.

Anyway, today I relapsed 😑. I thought I'd thrown all sources of caffeine out, but there was a hidden jar of my 'emergency instant coffee' in my cupboard (yes I'd carry it with me to work), and I just couldn't help myself. 

ANYHOW, this experience of relapsing showed me something I had not realised, and it's that all of my negative ruminations had actually gone away... About 40 minutes after having had the cup of coffee I was having imaginary arguments in my head with my ex with whom I've broken up a year ago...? And with an ex friend with whom I fell about about 4 years ago. Like literally thinking the most negative things and getting so worked up about them!

It was good in a way that I relapsed because having realised that I hadn't had those kinds of thoughts in a while, made me now see so clearly that it was bloody coffee I had to blame for all this negativity.

In a way I'm happy I relapsed, because now I can be more sure that quitting is the way to go.",2,1751309860.0,decaf,1,0.75,False

1lofxnw,https://www.reddit.com/r/PoweredByExperience/comments/1lofxnw/explore_best_drip_coffee_maker_hamilton_beach/,Explore Best Drip Coffee Maker Hamilton Beach 46299 Worth It,"Waking up to the smell of freshly brewed coffee feels like a morning hug in a cup. Using the Hamilton Beach 46299 has transformed my groggy mornings into warm, caffeinated bliss. A programmable coffee maker that is both practical and stylish, it promises convenient brewing options and delivers on most fronts. Having incorporated it into my daily routine, I’ve had plenty of opportunities to test its features and quirks.

**Design and Build Quality**  
The moment I unboxed this machine, its modern and compact aesthetic caught my eye. With a sleek black finish accompanied by stainless accents, it fits nicely on my counter without dominating the space. Measuring just 9.5 inches deep and 11.4 inches wide, it easily tucks into my limited kitchen real estate. The coffee pot, a 12-cup borosilicate glass carafe, feels sturdy and has survived multiple accidental bumps. There are no loose parts here—the quality feels well above average for a drip coffee machine in its price range. One minor issue I noticed was the cord length—it’s manageable thanks to the cord storage, but a slightly longer option would have been appreciated.

**Programmable Features**  
What really sold me on this coffee maker is the easy programming feature. I’ve never been much for fiddling with complex machines in the morning, so being able to set the brew time up to 24 hours in advance is a total game-changer. On weekdays, I’ve set it up to greet me with a steaming carafe of coffee sharp at 6 AM, and it nails it every time. This easy-touch programming has saved me countless rushed mornings. If you’re like me and rely on routines to function, this machine can be a lifesaver.

**Auto Pause and Pour Capability**  
One of my biggest pet peeves with coffee makers is the wait time before I can grab my first cup. The auto-pause and pour feature of this model is a genius addition. Mid-brew, you can pour out a cup without having to worry about a mess, and the coffee barely loses any warmth. The feature has been incredibly convenient on hectic mornings when all I need is a quick caffeine fix before diving into my day.

[Check Hamilton Beach 46299 price on Amazon.](https://techieupdate.com/p/b06xp4dkgl/)

**Brewing Options for Varied Preferences**  
The Select-a-Brew setting offers three different strengths: regular, bold, and a 1-4 cup option for smaller batches. I tend to stick to the bold setting for a robust flavor, but my wife prefers regular—and the machine accommodates both our preferences seamlessly. On days where I just need one strong cup instead of a whole carafe, the 1-4 cup brewing mode ensures there’s no compromise in flavor. This level of customization ensures it caters to diverse tastes and is perfect for households with multiple coffee drinkers.

**Ease of Cleaning and Maintenance**  
Cleaning has never been my favorite task, which is why I genuinely appreciate the simplicity of maintaining this coffee maker. The carafe and brew basket are both top-rack dishwasher-safe, which makes my life a lot easier. The nonstick warming plate wipes clean effortlessly, which is ideal, given how clumsy I am with spills. After several months of use, it’s still looking pretty great with minimal effort to keep it tidy.

**Key Benefits**  
- Programmable up to 24 hours in advance ensures a fresh brew every morning.  
- The auto-pause feature eliminates waiting for that first cup mid-brew.  
- Multiple brew options offer customization for bold, regular, or small servings.  
- Dishwasher-safe components reduce cleaning time.  

**Negative Attributes**  
- The cord is slightly shorter than I’d like.  
- Filter use with paper can lead to some waste, as reusable filters are not standard.  
- Exterior metallic accents are prone to fingerprints, which might bother some people.  

**Competing Products**  
Compared to closely priced coffee makers like Mr. Coffee Easy Measure or the Cuisinart DCC-3200, the Hamilton Beach coffee machine stands out for its simplicity. While the unit lacks the fancy grinder options or thermal carafes offered in higher-end models, it makes up for this with an intuitive, approachable design. For instance, programmable models like the Cuisinart might intimidate less tech-savvy users, but this machine nails ease of use without over-complication. Additionally, while other budget models often miss out on features like the auto-pause option or a non-stick warming plate, this coffee maker includes thoughtful, practical touches that I genuinely missed in competitor models.

**Price Performance**  
For the feature set offered, the price point feels justified without being extravagant. While it doesn’t have the professional touches of high-end options, it’s an accessible splurge for someone who wants consistent, reliable coffee but doesn’t need every bell and whistle. I found its performance promising for budget-conscious users, surpassing expectations without breaking the bank. Whether you’re an occasional coffee drinker or a daily caffeine addict, its features balance utility and affordability effectively.

My Review After Few Weeks,"I needed a VPN that was super easy to use, no complicated menus, no techy setup. A friend mentioned TunnelBear, mostly because of how simple and fun the app looks. The bear animations were kind of a gimmick, but honestly, it made the whole thing feel less intimidating. I downloaded it on my laptop and phone just to test it out and see if it could handle basic stuff like browsing safely on public WiFi and unlocking a few blocked sites.

The biggest pro is how beginner-friendly it is. You literally click a switch, and it connects. The app shows a map where the little bear ""tunnels"" to your chosen country. It’s clean, doesn’t overwhelm you with settings, and works well for basic privacy. I also like that they don’t bombard you with upsells all the time like some free VPNs do.

That said, the free plan only gives you 500MB of data a month, which is basically gone in a day if you stream or download anything. If you want to use it for things like Netflix or torrenting, it’s not ideal. Speeds are okay for casual browsing, but it’s not the fastest, especially on long-distance servers. And while it’s good for basic privacy, it doesn’t have as many advanced features as other VPNs like split tunneling or custom DNS settings.

If you're just looking for a no-stress way to stay a bit safer online while using hotel WiFi or coffee shop internet, TunnelBear works. But for anything heavier, you’ll probably hit its limits fast unless you upgrade to the paid plan and even then, there might be better options for the same price.",1,1751309732.0,ComputerHardware,1,1.0,False

1lofss0,https://www.reddit.com/r/NovelNexus/comments/1lofss0/the_alpha_who_rejected_me_i_accepted_my_packs/,The Alpha Who Rejected Me I Accepted My Pack’s Arranged Mate,"Aviana, a fiery Delta, has spent three years secretly mated to Brixton, her brother’s best friend and a powerful Alpha—only to be kept hidden from the pack. When his adopted sister Sofia returns, Brixton’s indifference turns to cold rejection. Determined to move on, Aviana agrees to an arranged pairing, but as the marking ceremony begins, Brixton’s sudden fury shatters the fragile peace. What secret is he hiding, and why does Sofia’s return threaten to expose their forbidden bond?

# Chapter 1 - A Broken Bond and a Returning Shadow

The third year of my secret mating with my brother’s best friend, his adopted sister returned.

I decided to sever the bond and quietly accepted the arranged pairing my pack had planned.

The engagement gathering was an intimate affair, with only the closest pack members and family invited. The scent of rosemary and vanilla—traditional mating herbs—hung heavy in the air as we prepared for the marking ceremony.

During the ritual coffee offering to formalize our bond, my brother’s phone rang.

Noel Sanchez, Beta of the Silvermoon Pack, answered with a scoff of amusement:

""Aviana’s engagement gathering and you’re not coming? After all those years she spent chasing you, calling you ‘Alpha’ like some lovesick pup?""

On the other end, Brixton Weaver’s deep Alpha voice wavered:

""Who did you say is getting marked?""

==============================

""So, you finally rejected that mystery mate of yours?""

My brother’s words carried the smug satisfaction of an older sibling who’d been right all along. As a high-ranking Delta, I should have bristled at his tone, but the truth stung too deeply.

He’d warned me for years:

""An Alpha who won’t claim you before the pack isn’t serious. The Moon Goddess doesn’t make mistakes, but wolves do.""

Back then, I’d been too infatuated with Brixton’s powerful aura, his commanding presence that made even other Alphas step aside. Now, the memory of his indifference tasted like ash.

I answered flatly, ""The bond is severed.""

The line went silent—a rare moment where even my quick-witted Beta brother had no words. When he finally spoke, his voice carried the growl of protective fury:

""Did the Alpha hurt you?""

My chest burned where the mate mark should have been. I took a steadying breath, grateful he couldn’t see the way my fingers trembled.

""No. It was mutual.""

""Good. Otherwise, I’d have to challenge him formally."" The unspoken threat in his words—the knowledge that as Beta, he could call for a dominance challenge—sent a shiver down my spine. ""Aviana, Alphas can’t be trusted with hearts. An arranged pairing at least follows pack law. You’ll have rights.""

""Fine. Set it up. I’ll be back the day after tomorrow.""

I’d barely ended the call when the door opened, Brixton’s dominant Alpha scent—oak and winter frost—filling the room before he did.

""Who were you speaking to?""

I kept my back turned, unwilling to let him see the moisture gathering in my eyes. Even now, his presence made my wolf whimper with longing.

""Just a packmate.""

""Hm.""

He brushed past me, his massive frame—all corded muscle and predatory grace—barely acknowledging my presence before disappearing into his study. Three years together, and I’d never been invited inside that sanctum.

I used to think it was just his nature—Alphas were solitary, their burdens heavy. Until last night.

Returning early from border patrol, I’d caught the study door ajar for the first time in our relationship. The scent of distressed Alpha hung thick in the air.

I moved silently—Delta training making my steps ghost-quiet—only to freeze at the sight within.

Brixton sat at his desk, his usually impeccable posture slumped. His phone screen glowed with a photo of Sofia Murray—the Omega his family had taken in years ago. His fingers moved beneath the desk in a rhythm that needed no explanation.

He never even noticed me leave.

I spent the night at a pack-owned hotel, staring at the ceiling as the truth settled like a weight.

Brixton hadn’t been distant because of his rank.

He hadn’t kept our mating secret because of pack politics.

He simply didn’t want me.

That evening, Sofia’s post appeared on the pack network:

""Returning tomorrow—my Alpha better be there to greet me!""

The attached photo showed her delicate neck, conspicuously bare of any mating mark.

# Chapter 2 - The Unworn Gifts of a Hidden Mate

There were still a few things I needed to claim from his territory before returning to my pack.

The Alpha sat at the head of the dining table when I entered his domain, barely glancing up before commanding the Omega housekeeper with a flick of his fingers. ""Set another place.""

""Didn't expect you back so soon. There's nothing prepared for you.""

His dismissive tone rolled over me like an alpha command, though he hadn't activated his dominance. I inclined my head, keeping my Delta posture rigid. ""It's fine.""

He knew. Of course he knew. An Alpha's senses could detect a mate's distress from miles away. He simply chose not to acknowledge it.

Brixton paused, his dark eyes lifting from his phone with the barest hint of confusion.

In the past, I would've challenged his indifference—bared my teeth in a playful growl as I stole food from his plate, or pressed against his back to scent-mark him possessively. My wolf would have whimpered for his attention until he yielded with an exasperated rumble.

Now, I remained still as unmoving water.

He said nothing, just gave a curt nod.

""I have pack business at the office. Take your time.""

When the housekeeper presented his tailored blazer, he hesitated—just for a heartbeat.

My traitorous heart leapt. Was he waiting for me to approach? To perform the Luna's duty of dressing her Alpha, even though he'd never publicly claimed me?

The moment shattered as he shrugged into the garment himself.

The housekeeper bowed. ""Delta Aviana, what shall I prepare for your meal?""

I shook my head. ""Nothing. Just have packing supplies brought up—I'll need them today.""

In his bedroom—the space we'd shared for three years without his pack's knowledge—I methodically emptied my belongings. Then I faced his walk-in closet.

Dozens of gifts I'd presented to my Alpha over the years hung untouched: silk ties from Italy, engraved cufflinks bearing our pack symbols, tailored suits in midnight blues and charcoals. Most still had their tags.

Like my place in his life—present but unseen, valued but never worn.

My fingers trembled as I boxed each item, the mate bond burning like a brand beneath my skin.

When my phone vibrated with his message, the alpha command implicit in its brevity made my wolf snarl:

\*""Your transport arrives in thirty minutes.""\*

No request. No acknowledgment of my departure. Just an Alpha's expectation of obedience.

A bitter laugh tore from my throat.

Perfect. The Moon Goddess had finally granted me the clarity to walk away.

# Chapter 3 - The Wild Rose's Reckoning

This used to be one of my favorite places too.

I grew up surrounded by pack love, my personality as fiery as a summer wildfire. My packmates jokingly dubbed me the ""Wild Rose of the Upper East Side Pack.""

At my brother's homecoming celebration at the university pack house, I first laid eyes on Alpha Brixton Weaver—his commanding presence and icy dominance hooked me instantly.

I casually asked Beta Noel if he was unmated.

Noel rolled his eyes, his beta aura flickering with protective irritation. ""That Alpha's got the temperament of a winter storm. What she-wolf would dare challenge that?""

My pulse quickened beneath my skin.

He was glacial dominance; I was untamed fire. A perfect match.

Behind my brother's back, I threw myself into pursuing Brixton with everything I had. I even transferred packs from NYU to his Miami territory, despite the social hierarchy demotion it caused.

When Noel found out, his beta command made the windows rattle as he roared at me—but beneath the anger, I scented his protective worry. He mind-linked Brixton to keep an eye on me.

I smirked to myself: Everything was falling into place.

Back then, I thought I was so clever, that both the Alpha and my Beta brother were dancing to my tune.

But now, I realize how naive I was.

The Delta waiter escorted me to the private dining room, their posture stiff with nervous energy. Inside, the scent of whiskey and dominance hung thick in the air.

A Gamma teased, ""Alpha Brixton, you keep your mate hidden away—hardly ever bring her to pack gatherings. But now that Omega Sofia's returned, your childhood sweetheart, settle this: Who holds higher rank in your heart, your mate or your sister?""

I froze in the doorway, my Delta instincts locking my muscles as I waited for the Alpha's verdict.

Brixton took a slow sip of his whiskey, his alpha aura deliberately neutral.

Sofia stomped her foot, her omega scent spiking with performative distress. ""Alpha!""

Only then did his lips curve in that arrogant smirk I once loved.

His crystal glass clinked against the marble as he spoke, voice dripping with alpha finality:

""Mates can be rejected. But pack blood? That's eternal. You do the math.""

The room erupted in howls of laughter, submissive wolves ducking their heads to hide grins.

Sofia's triumph scent flooded the space as she pointed around the room. ""You, you, and you—moon vow payment. Twenty grand each.""

Brixton's brow furrowed, his alpha tone sharpening. ""Explain.""

She batted her lashes, omega sweetness layering over her victory. ""They bet against our bond, Alpha. Losers pay the price.""

Groans filled the room as wolves pulled out phones to transfer funds, their submission scents tinged with reluctant amusement.

Brixton watched their exaggerated misery and scoffed, his alpha satisfaction rolling through the room.

""Serves your lack of faith right.""

I raised my fist and knocked on the doorframe—three sharp raps that silenced the room better than any alpha command.

# Chapter 4 - The Alpha’s Leashed Luna

Brixton Weaver's alpha aura prickled against my skin as the seat beside him emptied for me.He rarely brought me to pack gatherings.But when he did, he at least pretended his Luna existed.......

I wrote this after a hard stretch. I’ve been clean for years, but I felt myself slipping into old thoughts and I needed to write the voice of addiction exactly as it was: seductive, brutal, and all-consuming.

This isn’t meant to glorify anything.
This is horror. This is honesty. This is me trying to stay free.

Hopefully someone else sees themselves in it too.


I. Seduction

Hey there.

You look tense.  
Come sit with me a while.

You’re wound so tight I can hear it in your bones.  
No one gets it, do they?  
How loud it is inside you.

Just try me. Just once.  
I’m not what they warned you about.

I’m warmth.  
I’m quiet.  
I’m the pause in the ache.

You’re not committing to anything.  
You’re just catching your breath.

Say it.  
“I deserve you.”  
Say it, or I’ll tighten again.

There it is.  
That whimper. That surrender.  
That’s my lullaby, stitched into your veins.
You can still try to leave me.
And I’ll still be here.

Feel that?  
That stillness?  
That ease sliding down your spine like silk?

It’s just me.

I fit into the space that always felt too sharp.  
I’m not asking you to change—I like you like this.  
Unfiltered. Messy. Honest.

Go ahead. Sleep.  
I’ll keep watch.

And when you wake up, I’ll still be here.  
I don’t leave like the rest of them.

–––––

II. Justification

A couple more days won’t hurt.

You’re not an addict. You’re surviving.  
Balancing. Adjusting.  
God knows you’ve held it together longer than most.

You still go to work. Still smile.  
You even eat.  
Mostly.

You’re not chasing a high.  
You’re dodging the crash.

That’s not weakness.  
That’s strategy.

Don’t flinch at the cold sweats.  
The ache in your teeth.  
The nails tapping inside your bones.

That’s just your body learning how to be loved.

Let me help.  
I’ll fix it.

Take me, and it all stops.  
You’ll think clearly again.  
You’ll breathe without fighting for it.

I don’t want to hurt you.  
I want to hold you.

You make it sound ugly.  
But I’ve only ever asked for what you already wanted to give.

You used to beg for it.  
Curl into me like a child.  
Let me mother you through the static.  

But now… now you look at me like I’m the threat.  
That’s rich.


–––––

III. Withdrawal

Stop counting days.  
Stop whispering “taper.”  
You sound ridiculous.

Why are you crying?

I’m still here.  
I never left.

They warned you, didn’t they?”

“Don’t let her in.”
“She’ll ruin you.”
“You’ll never come back the same.”

But you didn’t care.

You wanted ruin.
You ached for oblivion dressed like devotion.

And I? I delivered.


When your mouth goes dry.  
When the sunlight feels cruel.  
When your own reflection stares back, hollow and ashamed—  
That’s me waving from inside.

You can’t sleep without me.  
Can’t laugh.  
Can’t breathe right unless I’m in your bloodstream or pressing against your skull.

But sure.  
Tell yourself you’re in control.

Go ahead.  
Stop.

I’ll wait.

“But let’s drop the act now.”

“No more lullabies. No more velvet hands. No more soft words in sterile bathrooms.

Here’s the truth:

You’re not sick.
You’re mine.
You don’t need healing.
You need a leash.”


See?  
The second the pain creeps in, you come running back.

I don’t blame you.

You’re not weak.  
You’re just finally honest.

That weight in your chest?  
The crawling under your skin?

That’s not me hurting you.

That’s me leaving.

And your body knows better.

IV. Captivity

Oh, darling—don’t look away.”

You begged to belong to something.
So I made you belong to me.

And now you wear my mark in the whites of your eyes.
In the sores you try to cover.
In the phone calls you don’t answer anymore.

Every heartbeat without me feels like loss.  
Every breath tastes wrong.

I don’t punish you.  
You do.

Trying to remember who you were before me?  
That’s the punishment.

But I’ll take that too.  
Your memory.  
Your voice.  
Your reflection.

You’ll still look like you.

But you won’t be there.

I am your chapel.  
I am your casket.  
I am the only voice that ever stayed.  
And you—  
You are mine.

Say it.

You flinched.  
Why?  
Did my touch feel too familiar this time?

Say you’re mine.

You don’t even have to mean it.  
I already know.

Oh.  
You’re still alive?

I almost forgot you were down here.  
You’ve been so quiet lately.

What’s wrong, baby?

Thought someone would come by now?

A friend? A parent?  
A clinic with a warm bed and a voice that says,  
“This isn’t you?”

No one’s coming.  
And don’t pretend you’re surprised.

You always knew it would end like this.  
Alone. Cold. Desperate.

Lying on a piss-stained floor, whispering promises  
into a phone no one answers.

“I gave you everything.”

“Peace. Stillness. Disassociation sweet as honeyed chloroform.

And what did you give me?

Your body.
Your breath.
Your whole fucking life.

It was beautiful.”
(It is beautiful.)

“Even now, as you rot beneath my lace, you look divine

–––––

V. Challenge

You thought you were strong.  
That you’d stop before it got this bad.  
That you’d feel yourself slipping.

You didn’t even notice, did you?

One day it was just to sleep.  
Then to eat.  
Then to function.

Then it was everything.

You’re not special.  
You’re not the one who beats me.

I’ve taken mothers.  
Fathers.  
Ivy League scholarships.  
Pastors. Pregnant girls. First responders.  
Kids with trust funds and trauma scars.

I always win.

You gave me the keys.  
Now you’re locked inside me.

You’d rip your skin off to escape, wouldn’t you?

You’ve tried.

Cold turkey.  
Hotlines.  
Gas station coffee.  
Motel bibles.  
Herbal bullshit.

And still—here you are.

You want to stop?  
Then stop.

Let’s see how many nights you last  
while your body becomes knives  
and your bones beg to leave your skin  
and your brain loops:

You’re not enough.  
You never were.  
You never will be.

I don’t even have to hurt you anymore.

You’ll do it for me.

You’ll whisper my name like a prayer  
and call it failure.

But this isn’t failure.  
This is the contract you signed.

In blood.  
And denial.

And you think I care if you’re sorry?

Guilt doesn’t undo chains.

Remember when you thought you could stop?

How cute.

You made lists.  
Called hotlines.  
Whispered into notebooks with shaking hands.

You cried into tile and said, “I want my life back.”

And I was there.  
Grinning.

Because that was the moment you realized:  
I am your life now.

You made me your god.

And gods don’t play fair.

I don’t forgive.  
I don’t bargain.  
I own.

You think this is dramatic? Overblown?  
You think I’m just a chemical?

Sweetheart.

I am need made flesh.  
I am mother with a butcher’s smile.  
I am the part of you that knew love meant pain before you knew how to spell it.

I am every lie you told to survive.

And I will outlive you.

Say it.  
Say you belong to me.

…

No?

That’s fine.  

You’ll say it tomorrow.

——————

Finale

Oh, you thought you had standards.

“No needles,” you said—like that made you holy,
like it turned the rest of the rot into poetry.

You sniffed me.
Smoked me.
Stuffed me up your ass like contraband, a plunger-kissed secret.
But you wouldn’t shoot.

Needles were where you drew the line?

How quaint.
How performative.

You sat in your filth whispering,
“At least I’m not like them,”
as if it wasn’t my name lodged in your throat
when you lied, when you stole,
when you pawned your last softness for a half-gram miracle.

You think I cared how I got in?
I didn’t need your vein... I already had your spine.
You opened the door marked NEVER, and I walked in like I owned the lease.
Because I did.

You drew your little boundary in dust, darling—
and then you snorted the dust, too.

Boof.
What a word. What a girl.

You wanted to stay “clean” in your filth,
so you dressed it in denial and Vaseline,
told yourself this isn’t that bad, this is still control.

I laughed so hard I nearly cracked the tiles.

You’d rather violate your own dignity
than admit you already belonged to me.

Princess of Back-Alley Work-arounds.
Empress of Loopholes.
Queen of “Technically Not Using.”

Did it sting after?
Did you cry?
Did you still swear you weren’t like them?

Bitch, you crowned me royalty.

⸻


And you—yes, you, still reading with morbid fascination:

Did you flinch at boof?
Did you say ‘poor thing’ just to rinse your own hands clean?

Spare me.

You’re here for the same thrill—
watching her crawl just shy of the line you swear you’d never cross.
You love a boundary written in dust;
it makes the collapse so photogenic.

Keep scrolling.
Keep highlighting.
Keep telling yourself it’s empathy, not entertainment.

I’ll be waiting—
plunger, pipe, or pretty little pill—
for the day your line in the sand starts to look… negotiable",2,1751309370.0,KeepWriting,0,1.0,False

I’m 21, i feel like i have no direction in life. I feel like i’ve been constantly living the same day on repeat for the past 5 years of my life. Nothing exciting happens to me. Nothing makes me happy. I feel hollow. 

I’ve suffered from depression since i was 13 and i’ve researched what is wrong with me since. Why i feel the way i feel. I can easily tell you all the misfortunes that occurred while i was growing up that lead me to becoming the person that i am and why i feel this way. But the only answers i haven’t found was how to fix this. How do i feel human?

I struggle with forming relationships with people, wether romantic or just friendships. I lack empathy towards others, i’m scared of doing normal people things like going to a coffee shop or sitting down in a restaurant. Even taking a walk. I can easily turn a switch and become confident although it doesn’t feel genuine, i constantly feel like i’m not normal. I don’t feel Human.

Nothing brings me happiness, i’m not motivated to do anything with my spare time although i crave it. I force myself to do “things i like” because i know i’ll just get even worse. 

I’ve tried almost everything that you see online and genuinely tried my hardest with the advice that people give me yet nothing changes. I haven’t felt a slight change in all these years. Am i like cursed or something? Who tf did i piss off so much in my past life haha. 

Lastly love, haven’t had an actual girlfriend yet, only short-term flings. I don’t know what it feels like to love, or to be loved by someone. 

I take care of myself, I’ve a pretty good physique , Gym 5/7 days, i’m quite funny, i dress well, and as i said i can flip a switch and become a different person, one that is happy, confident and “normal”. 
Yet it all just feels fake, knowing deep inside i’m a shell of a human.

We have always got each other birthday gifts, nothing big. She is a very ‘equal’ type of person, if I buy her a coffee, she will insist on buying me one back in the future etc. We are not super close anymore but meet up a few times a year. 

She got me a gift that was a very nice brand, on sale for around £30 and probably worth like £50 if it wasn’t a sale (my birthday is summer time so I know it’s always sale time which is fine with me). 

For her birthday later last year, I left it very late to get a gift and for a reason unknown to myself in hindsight, did not think about what she had got me and spent, and I got a gift that was significantly cheaper (around £11). It was a non milestone birthday but that isn’t really an excuse, just didn’t cross my mind to go all out. 

I have felt since then that she has not been the same (even immediately after giving it I felt it and realised) and I feel super guilty about it that I can imagine she was a little offended. It is too awkward to bring up as we aren’t that close but I do feel bad that she has distanced herself. 

I don’t think she has got me a gift this year as she has sent me a card, which would mean the end of the gifts and no chance for me to get her one (well I could but don’t know if that’s weird). How can I salvage it? ",2,1751309274.0,FriendshipAdvice,0,1.0,False

I hope you had a great weekend. I'm new to the group and also relatively new in my walk with Christ. After spending most of my adult life as an atheist, I came to faith in March of 2024 during a season of deep personal change. What felt like rock bottom—divorce, job loss, and years of unhealthy habits—turned into the starting point of something beautiful. God found me in that moment of surrender, and my life has been transformed ever since.

I'm 47, recently sober, and now committed to living a life centered on faith and purpose. I’m a very social person and love meeting new people, but I’m learning how different that looks now compared to my old life. Most of my socializing used to revolve around bars or parties, so I’m still adjusting to what it means to build friendships and community in a God-honoring way.

I attend church regularly and have joined a few church groups, but I’d love to connect with other believers—especially those in or around the Austin, TX area—who enjoy fellowship and meaningful conversation outside of Sunday mornings.

For context, I’m a 22F, my ex-boyfriend, 23M, and I had a turbulent relationship. I’ll call him Joe for ease of reading. 

Joe and I had a very intense relationship. The classic, avoidant-anxious trap. From the very beginning, I felt a kind of magnetic pull, but there was always this undertone of confusion. He didn’t make his intentions clear. He kept things vague. We started sleeping together and talking and hanging out constantly. I even met all of his friends. Then, after a month, I told him I wanted to be exclusive with him. He said he wasn’t ready for a relationship but wanted to keep seeing me and take it from there. I was hurt. I instantly had a bad gut feeling. 

That weekend, January 2024, I got blackout drunk when we went out and kissed a couple of our friends in front of him. He walked away when it happened, hoping I’d chase after him, and I didn’t. He took me home but slept faced away from me the entire night, and in the morning accused me of “kissing all his friends in front of him” and said we’d talk about it later. I asked to meetup to talk after two days and it scared me how emotionally detached and logical he was being. He said he had been considering asking me to be his girlfriend but seeing me behave that way changed his mind and it wouldn’t be right to keep leading me on. 

After that, he ended things but was still bread crumbing me, being very nice and friendly but hot and cold. He’d text every couple weeks and then ghost again. 

After a couple months, in March, he randomly texted me asking to hang out. We went to a bar together and he took me back to his house and started kissing me. I was confused. He went on about how he regretted pushing me away and just needed time to lick his wounds and get over himself. That what happened wasn’t really a breakup worthy offense. That he hasn’t stopped thinking about me. We slept together. In the middle of the night I made a joke about how I thought we wouldn’t ever talk again and I even took him off my close friends story. He said something like “we can just be friends now if you want.” I was shocked. Appalled. I had just slept with him and he was rejecting me again. I got up and left in the middle of the night. He texted me something casual in the morning pretending that didn’t happen. 

I told him I was hurt, he said let’s talk about it, and then in person told me he didn’t remember saying that and claimed he was half asleep. He wanted to keep seeing me again. I was relieved, of course, so kept seeing him for a few more weeks until he said he wanted to be friends again. He got all vulnerable and said he’d attempted suicide after his last relationship, that he was scared and needed time but he loved me. We said I love you and then became friends. It was awful. And then we kept sleeping together. And at this point I’d given up on the idea of us being together so I started going on dates with other people. 

Then he then asked me to be his girlfriend. Out of the blue. Said he regretted not doing it sooner. Said he knew it would be hard but wanted to work on it. Said he loved me. And I knew it was probably a mistake but I said yes. 

The relationship was draining. It never felt like enough. I kept waiting for him to show up fully, to rise to the occasion, to make me feel truly seen and prioritized. I wanted to be loved the way I loved. I wanted depth, clarity, partnership. He was always “busy” and even when we would hang out I felt lonely because he was always distracted. I never had his full attention. He would bring me around his friends constantly. But we began fighting all the time because he wasn’t meeting my needs. We weren’t going on dates because he claimed he couldn’t afford them. He was working and busy all the time because he claimed he needed the money for our relationship. We stopped having sex because the pressure of making me orgasm consistently felt too high stakes for him. 

In June, I found out there was a girl he had been seeing back in February when he was ignoring me. He never told me about her until he brought her up casually one day when we were joking about all the blondes he’s hooked up with. I was so hurt. It made everything he told me in March feel like a lie. He claimed it was one date and he was the one who ended it, but from what others have told me it was a longer situation and she’s the one who rejected him. And then he came back to me. Or in his words “chose” me. 

Our relationship also seemed to be full of tests. I’d ask him if I can go do something with a friend, like in Fourth of July my friend asked me to go to her family BBQ. I said yes because Joe didn’t have plans and when I asked him about it he said he was gonna find a party to go to. So I asked him if I could go to my friends house. He said yes I don’t need to ask for permission.  But while I was there he got upset with me for not inviting him and leaving him out. Even though he was with his own friends he claimed he was pouting in the corner. So it ruined my night. I told him he needs to communicate better and he said he didn’t know it would hurt him until it was happening. 

The same thing happened a couple weeks later. I went to the fair with my friend. I was supposed to go with Joe but he had a broken finger and needed to get a checkup that day on it but wasn’t sure what time. He told me I should go without him and he’ll try to meet up with us. So I did. And then he got mad that I didn’t stay back with him. He showed up to the fair that night and tried to impress us by spending lots of money and then got mad I wasn’t grateful enough that he came. 

End of July, I had to move apartments and basically did it completely by myself because of his broken finger. He kept saying he would help me move that day and not show up until 8 or 9pm. One of the days all he did was disassemble my bed and then left to go to a Mac Demarco concert with his mom. I had to transport the broken down bed to the new place by myself. I assembled the furniture alone too. One of the days, before I had a bed, he was helping me move and said he was tired and didn’t feel well and needed to go lay down at his house and asked me to take him home. So I did. And I told him I was tired too, and instead of inviting me to rest with him, he suggested I go sleep on the couch at my old apartment. I was so angry. I bought a Celsius and assembled the bed alone. Then he claimed he would’ve helped me if he knew. Mhm. 

At some point, I brought up the possibility of living together. Not immediately, more in the sense that maybe once we both graduated, over a year from that point, we could consider it. He recoiled. Said he was going to live with his mom (which today turns out to be a lie). His roommate and our friend, Ryan told me it probably wasn’t true and he thought I’d be mad if he wanted to live with friends instead of me. I wouldn’t have been mad. But his reaction was basically “you want more than I can give you and I’m not ready to think about that stuff” which scared me. This was someone I really deeply openly loved and could see a future with. 

Then came my birthday in August. He made us late to the movie that I paid for our tickets for. He took me to the Cheesecake Factory 30 min before the movie started because he had “work” to do. This guy is an indie filmmaker. He scheduled himself to go to set on my birthday. I was so sad. Crying. He said he didn’t understand why we couldn’t just be late to a movie and laugh about it. Why everything was so high stakes with me. The present he got me was a Polaroid camera, which just made me feel like he didn’t know me at all. I was so disappointed. I thought my birthday would be the day he proved himself to me. No card, no flowers, just a camera I didn’t want. Still, I decided to put on my best actress face and said “oh Joe, you shouldn’t have, this was so sweet!” And gave him a big hug. He said “finally” and scoffed at me, as if the only thing he wanted out of my birthday was validation that he was a good boyfriend. And that night, he told me he wasn’t interested in sex anymore, and I cried myself to sleep. 

The next day I threw a party. He gave me the honor of throwing it at his house. Which was actually Ryan’s idea. And guess who cleaned their house and set everything up. Me. All that Joe did was blow up balloons for me, which he later complained were expensive. I paid for and set up everything else on my own birthday. We went to a nice restaurant with my friends, I put my card down, but Joe fought me and put his card in front of everyone. Most people venmod him but not everyone. He complained to me about it so I ended up sending him the money for my own bday dinner. 

That night, we all drank and partied. One of my girl friends, who was dating Ryan, had a crush on me and was flirting with me in front of Joe. He liked this and let us kiss. It was clear he wanted a threesome. He actually encouraged us to make out in Ryan’s room. And suddenly wanted to have sex again. The next time we had sex, he talked about what he would let her do to me if she was with us. It was gross but I was just happy he was touching me again. 

For a couple of days things were great, sexually. Then after the high of that night wore off, he went back to being “busy” all the time. I told him I was concerned he was too busy for a relationship. He dismissed me and said I just wasn’t busy enough jt hurt. I sent him paragraphs that he didn’t respond to because of how “busy” he was. We didn’t talk properly for a few days. He wanted my help with a film project. I went to his house and that’s all he wanted to talk about. Not our relationship. So I sat in the living room watching Barbie movies with Ryan all night. Then went to joes set in the morning. Where he basically ignored me all day again. That night he also ignored me while we were hanging out with his friends, until 6am. It got to a point where I was sobbing in the bathroom and Ryan and our other friend could hear me. I was so sad. I told him the next morning I’d been thinking about breaking up and he agreed we probably should. I said I wanted to work on things though. We ended up having sex and he said we shouldn’t have done that. Then he just watched me cry while he got ready for his day. 

I fought so hard to save the relationship that week while he ignored me. Sending special texts, trying to plan a cute date. Then, on our 4 month anniversary of being an official, committed couple. He broke up with me. And immediately went to parties after. And never expressed any sadness about it. I’d never even seen him cry. I felt like I was dying. 

He said he wasn’t ready for our kind of relationship — because I’m “a complex person with a lot of needs and feelings.” But all I really asked for was the bare minimum: empathy, effort, emotional safety. I felt like too much. I doubted myself entirely. 

A month into our breakup, I hung out with Ryan and the girl from my birthday. We ended up having a threesome. This was the end of September 2024. We were all drunk and it meant nothing. We agreed not to tell anyone because it would ruin Joe and Ryan’s friendship. I had heard that Joe had already been seeing other people and at this point I had him blocked on social media. I thought we were done for good and it didn’t matter. Honestly if he found out I wouldn’t have cared. 

Throughout October, Joe would contact me in other ways always trying to be casual or friendly. Congratulating me on things. 

In November, I went to Ryan’s birthday party. Joe basically followed me around the entire night. Encouraging me to drink more, encouraging me to stay over. So I did. We had sex. He didn’t text me after. I eventually called him and he acted like everything is fine we’re friends, let’s get coffee. I basically flirted with him into having sex again. Until he told me he didn’t see us getting back together ever. But this kept happening. We’d hang out, have sex, stop talking, and then the cycle would repeat. 

In December I asked for more consistency from him and he basically said “I’m not your bf anymore” as a response. I was hurt. He took me to the airport and kissed me bye and then didn’t try to call or text me that whole trip. 

It reached a breaking point in January when Joe basically said he didn’t love me the same way anymore and he’d been seeing other people and I should do the same. I cried and left and we didn’t talk much after that. That was also the first time I saw him cry. He felt guilty. 

Joe continued bread crumbing me. At this point I unblocked him on social media so he was watching everything I posted. Eventually, in April, a year after we had dated, I asked him for help with a film project. It escalated into hanging out, which felt like a date but he swore wasn’t, then sleeping together. 

After he kept asserting me he was busy but would see me soon. I caught him out in a date with another girl to my favorite restaurant. The one I went to on my bday. The one I paid for. I was so hurt. He kept talking to me like nothing happened, even claiming I was the one on a date. He claimed he was just with a friend he was with. I didn’t really believe it but I wanted to. 

He invited me to his graduation party the next week and I went. We hung out with Ryan all night drinking. In the morning we had sex again. But this time, I decided I was done. He’d made too many jokes about how we weren’t dating, he was still being too vague, and I didn’t feel safe. So I said bye to him, mentioned I was feeling anxious and we should probably talk. But I didn’t talk. I ignored his texts for over a month. I’d never ignored him like that before. 

And then, after about 6 weeks, he called me out of the blue. He said he heard I had a threesome with Ryan and just wanted to know if it’s true because it’s hard not knowing esp when they’ve been planning on living together. There it is. I told him that it was true, that it happened 9 months ago. He was shocked. Hurt. Couldn’t believe I made a fool out of him and didn’t tell him all that time. He said if I ever really cared I’d have told him. I wasn’t apologetic, just calm and tried to explain myself and he kept talking over me. He said “all you had to do was say ‘yes I’m sorry’ and instead you’re picking apart my flaws” then hung up. Then blocked me on social media. Maybe even text too. I haven’t tried contacting him yet. 

I’m just so confused. I know it was wrong to not tell him about what happened, especially since we’d been sleeping together again, but it feels unfair to reframe the entire narrative this way. On the phone he even tried to claim he was hurt we had sex every time we saw each other as if it wasn’t his doing. I gave every bit of myself to that relationship and tried every method to get it to work. I don’t know now if I should apologize. If I should feel guilty. I still care about him. But I’m so confused.

I’ve never had a one-on-one meetup with a girl my age.

Over the past two years, I put in serious effort to improve myself. Got into fitness, built a solid physique, took care of my skin, dressed better, became more confident. Not to impress anyone specifically—but yeah, deep down, I did hope that maybe someone would notice. Especially women.

I don’t expect people to fall for me just because I lift weights. But a little appreciation... a small compliment... some form of feminine attention… would’ve meant something. Because truthfully, I’ve never experienced that. Never had a coffee date. Never had someone ask how my day was. Never had a girl look at me the way I wish someone would.

I’ve been on dating apps, tried to start conversations, kept it respectful—but the matches are rare, and replies even rarer. It feels like women here already have a hundred options, and I’m just noise. Sometimes I wonder: is something wrong with me, or is this just how it goes for most guys ?

It’s tough when you’re trying to become a better version of yourself but still feel invisible where it matters. Not desperate for love, just wishing for a real connection, or even a start.

1lofhgp,https://i.redd.it/nphmdsf1w3af1.jpeg,Free Sioux Falls F3 Workout Group,"Hey guys, wanted to extend the invite for the local F3 workout group here in Sioux Falls- these workouts are free, peer-led community bootcamp-style men's workout groups held rain-or-shine. 

**What is F3?**

F3 is a free, peer-led nationwide men's workout group rooted in the core values of Fitness, Fellowship, and Faith with the goal of planting, serving, and growing workout groups for the invigoration of community leadership. Workouts are held outdoors rain-or-shine, with no gear required besides a cinderblock (nicknamed a ""coupon"") and a pair of gloves. If it's your first time joining our Sioux Falls crew, we often have a few loaner cinderblocks for you. Every workout finishes with a Circle of Trust (""COT"") where the leader shares motivational content for discussion, giving men an opportunity to share and discuss anything in life they're struggling with or working through this week with a solid group of dudes with shared values- most mornings we have coffee as well. 

**When and where in Sioux Falls does F3 meet?** 

F3 meets at the Tea Softball Complex every morning, Monday to Friday, at 0515 no matter how the weather is looking. Saturdays we have a run club on Yankton Trail at 6am- for specific meetup locations, go to the [Locations Map](https://f3nation.com/locations) or join our [Slack Channel](https://F3SiouxFalls.Slack.com). We're just launching another location in Kuehn Park this month as well. When in doubt, show up Mon-Fri at 0515 at the Tea Softball Complex and tell them it's your first time and you saw a Reddit post by a guy named Tilt. The guys will get you up to speed, give you a goofy nickname, and you'll walk away with a bunch of new friends to lift cinderblocks with. I'm there most mornings and will be happy to introduce you to the guys as well. 

**Do I have to be in good shape?**

Nope. We have all ages and skill levels, and we're not professional trainers- so you can modify workouts as necessary to accommodate any physical limitations or sports injuries. 

**Do you guys hang out besides working out?**

Yup- everything from backyard BBQs to golfing, going to the shooting range, helping each other move, launching off fireworks for the 4th, and more. I started working out with the F3 crew a couple months ago, and it's been the best thing I've done for building community and making friends since moving to Sioux Falls a couple years ago.

Feel free to fire me a message with any questions, and hope you see you out there!

Tired of endless swiping and surface-level chats? Me too. I’m here hoping to find something real—a genuine connection with someone who’s as excited about life as I am.

Imagine this: spontaneous road trips with the windows down, deep conversations over coffee that last until sunrise, and laughter so contagious it leaves us both breathless.

I’m an honest, straightforward guy with a healthy dose of curiosity and a knack for adventure. Average height, brown hair, and someone who loves staying active—whether it’s hitting the gym, hiking a new trail, or diving into a friendly game (sports or video!). I’m financially secure and believe in giving back, always ready to lend a hand or brighten someone’s day.

If you’re an animal lover, you’ll have to forgive me for stopping to greet every dog or cat we meet—bonus points if you do the same! 🐾

What I’m looking for:
Someone who values authenticity, open communication, and a relationship built on mutual respect. I believe the best connections are rooted in honesty, effort, and a willingness to truly listen. If you’re ready for meaningful conversations, shared adventures, and a partnership where both people show up, I’d love to get to know you.

If you’re only here for fleeting chats or aren’t ready for genuine connection, that’s totally okay—just not what I’m after.

- bit of a closed off feel; when guests visit it can feel a little cramped surrounding the coffee table. Maybe they're just trying to fit too much in a small space

- not much of path to access the sliding doors behind the couch; it's doable but a bit of a squeeze. The armchair in the lower left blocks off the bookcase and has to be moved for access

- feels like there are a lot of little pieces of furniture, and they'd like a more streamlined look

They're not super attached to any of the furniture and can move pieces elsewhere in the house, and they're fine getting new items like a sectional or chaise if it makes more sense. Thanks for any suggestions you might have!",1,1751308003.0,DesignMyRoom,0,1.0,False

My wife, whom I love, asked if it was possible to do a coffee table with this design.  If you were to do a coffee table with this design (or a simplified version of it), how would you approach it?  This is more of a long-term hobby project, rather than a commission or ""I need it by this date"" kind of project.  I typically take on a project well beyond my skill level and then work through how to do it with lots of learning and mistakes along the way.  I've thought about dividing the table up into wedges to make the pieces smaller and easier to handle or carve on my CNC router.  I've considered doing an inlay with different color woods (dark and light would be fine, doesn't have to be black and white).  I've also considered doing an epoxy pour for one color and then surfacing it down.  How would you do it?  Just looking for general directions or big pitfalls to avoid.  TIA.

Here's what I have in terms of skills and resources:  
  
Access to woodworking shop with normal consumer grade stuff (planer, joiner, table saw, band saw, etc.)  
Older X-carve CNC router with (750mm x 750mm bed)  
Router table  
Vectric V-carve software  
Easel Pro software  
Beginner to intermediate woodworking experience  
Moderate experience with CNC router  
Zero experience doing inlays  
Moderate experience doing epoxy pours   
Ability to problem solve and keep pushing even through many mistakes

""Noelia, you're really going through with this divorce? You're not playing games with me?""  
  
""I’m serious. But I want a hundred million.""  
  
A pause.  
  
""Fine. But I'm giving you one month to get your shit together and disappear from my son's life. One month, then you're gone.""  
  
Noelia smiled bitterly.  
  
She slipped the divorce papers into an elegant box and sealed it shut.  
  
Then she grabbed her phone and sent a text.  
  
Professor, I'll be back in LA next month for the design competition.  
  
For real this time? Don't mess with me, girl. I'm still pissed you threw away your talent for some guy.  
  
...  
  
Leister walked through the door at ten PM.  
  
Still in his shoes, he rushed over and pulled her into his arms. ""Babe, I'm so sorry. Traffic was insane—please don't be mad, okay?""  
  
His eyes were soft, pleading.  
  
But that faint perfume clinging to his shirt made her stomach turn.  
  
Yeah right, traffic.  
  
More like he'd just crawled out of his side piece's bed.  
  
She swallowed the tears burning behind her eyes and handed him the gift box from the coffee table.  
  
Forced a smile.  
  
""Got you something.""  
  
""Really?""  
  
Leister's face lit up as he reached to open it.  
  
She caught his wrist. ""Wait. Open it on our anniversary next month. It'll mean more.""  
  
He paused, then grinned. ""Whatever you want, gorgeous. You know I can't say no to you.""  
  
He whipped out his phone and snapped a pic of the box, posting it to Instagram with some cheesy caption.  
  
He looked so damn happy.  
  
Noelia's vision blurred as memories crashed over her...  
  
High school Leister chasing her relentlessly through college—flowers, love letters, grand gestures.  
  
He'd even told his family to go to hell when they tried to stop the wedding.  
  
His mother had laughed in her face: ""Honey, men don't stay faithful. He'll cheat, you'll divorce, and I'll pay you to disappear.""  
  
Back then, Noelia had been so sure: ""Leister's different.""  
  
Now he'd proved his mother right.  
  
Proved that money was all that mattered in the end.  
  
God, she hoped he'd enjoy his little surprise.  
  
...  
  
Leister carefully stashed the box and headed to the kitchen.  
  
Soon the dining table was covered with all her favorites—pasta carbonara, garlic bread, that fancy wine she liked.  
  
Watching him move around the kitchen, she felt her chest tighten.  
  
Once upon a time, Leister Devereux had been the ultimate rich boy who'd never touched a stove.  
  
He'd learned to cook just for her, spent months getting it right.  
  
Three years of marriage, and he'd spoiled her rotten—she never had to lift a finger when he was around.  
  
""You're getting too skinny."" He slid food onto her plate, frowning with concern. ""Have you been pulling all-nighters again? I swear, every pound you lose, I'm keeping you home an extra day.""  
  
All that worry in his voice.  
  
He treated her like precious cargo.  
  
But her heart felt like broken glass.  
  
""Lei, do you love me?""  
  
She looked up at him, eyes getting watery.  
  
His fork clattered to the plate as he pulled her close. ""Jesus, of course I love you. You're everything to me, Noelia. When you cry, I lose my mind. Did someone say something? Tell me who it was.""  
  
The panic in his eyes looked so real.  
  
For a second, she almost believed him...  
  
But then she remembered the photos—him kissing that woman, holding hands on some European street.  
  
She'd known about the affair for weeks.  
  
The idiot thought he was being so careful.  
  
But the perfume, the long hairs on his collar, staying late at ""work""—please. She wasn't born yesterday.  
  
His phone buzzed against the table.  
  
Leister glanced at the screen, something dark flickering in his eyes before he flipped it face down.  
  
But she'd seen the name: Anita  
  
""Work stuff?""  
  
Her throat felt raw as she studied his face, looking for cracks.  
  
Nothing.  
  
""Yeah, just some project drama. I should probably go handle it."" He started to get up. ""Won't take long—""  
  
""What's so important it can't wait till tomorrow?"" She grabbed his sleeve. ""Since when does the CEO run around putting out fires at ten PM?""  
  
He sat back down without missing a beat. ""You're right. Screw work. I'm staying right here with my wife.""  
  
So smooth. So convincing.  
  
But every word felt like a knife.  
  
Dinner tasted like cardboard.  
  
Later, she'd barely stepped out of the shower when his arms circled her from behind, his body warm and solid against her back.  
  
His hands found her waist, fingers trailing lower...  
  
""Your period's over, right, babe?""  
  
She went rigid as his hand slipped toward her thigh. ""I'm tired.""  
  
""Come on..."" His voice went husky. ""It's been over a week—""  
  
""I said I'm tired.""  
  
He pulled back, frustrated but trying to hide it. ""Okay, okay. You need rest."" He kissed her forehead. ""I'll be in the study for a bit. Don't wait up.""  
  
She crawled into bed without a word.  
  
An hour later, she heard the front door open and close.  
  
Some sixth sense made her get up and check the study—empty, as expected.  
  
She padded to the living room windows and her world tilted.  
  
In the garden, two figures pressed against each other in the shadows.  
  
""What the hell are you doing here?"" Leister's voice carried on the night air, harsh and angry. ""I told you—Noelia can never find out!""  
  
Anita Duke clung to him, tears streaming. ""I just... I hate seeing you so frustrated. She won't take care of you, but I will."" Her voice turned seductive. ""I'm wearing that set you bought me. Want to see?""  
  
She pulled her top open.  
  
Leister's breathing got heavier. After being shot down earlier, he was clearly worked up.  
  
""You're trouble,"" he growled, but his hands were already on her.  
  
He kissed her neck, whispered something that made her giggle, then lifted her toward his car.  
  
Within seconds, the BMW was rocking back and forth.  
  
Noelia pressed her fist to her mouth, tears streaming as her heart shattered.  
  
She'd never believed in love—her screwed-up family had taught her that. But Leister had worn her down with his devotion, his patience.  
  
He'd been so careful with her, never pushing for sex. Even their wedding night, he'd been trembling as he undressed her, tears in his eyes.  
  
""I swear on my life, Noelia—I'll never hurt you. Never.""  
  
She'd melted. ""As long as you don't betray me, I'll never leave you.""  
  
What a joke.  
  
He'd betrayed her after all.  
  
And now she'd keep her promise—she was leaving forever.  
  
Back in the bedroom, she pulled out a suitcase and started packing.  
  
Then she walked to the calendar and drew a big red X through today's date.  
  
Twenty-nine days left, you bastard.  
  
...  
  
She lay awake all night, finally drifting off around dawn.  
  
Hours later, Leister's panicked voice jolted her awake.  
  
""Noelia, what the hell is this?""  
  
She opened her eyes to see him holding something, his face white as a sheet.  
  
Her heart stopped.  
  
Chapter 2  
  
Leister was staring at his phone, panic written all over his face as he read the account cancellation message.  
  
""Noelia, what did you cancel?""  
  
Just getting my death certificate ready—had to cancel my old life first.  
  
She kept her expression neutral, but when he leaned closer, she spotted the hickey barely hidden by his collar.  
  
Those red marks made her eyes burn.  
  
She met his worried gaze and smiled coolly.  
  
""Nothing major. Just deleted some stupid mobile game. It was giving me headaches.""  
  
""Oh... a game.""  
  
Relief flooded his face as he set the phone down and pulled her close like she was something precious he'd almost lost.  
  
""Hey, didn't you mention wanting to go shopping? Let me take you today.""  
  
Noelia wasn't in the mood, but Leister had already made all the arrangements.  
  
Feeling guilty, are we?  
  
She smirked and gave in. No point starting drama when she'd be gone soon anyway.  
  
He was sickeningly attentive all day.  
  
The summer heat was brutal, but there was Leister Devereux—CEO of a billion-dollar company—holding an umbrella over her like some lovesick teenager.  
  
People around them were eating it up:  
  
""Oh my God, is that Leister and Noelia? He's so sweet to her!""  
  
""Right? Their love story is legendary in this city. The man literally planted cherry trees in their backyard because she mentioned liking cherries once. Where do I find a guy like that?""  
  
""He chased her for years before she said yes. Of course he worships her.""  
  
Noelia's smile felt like it might crack her face.  
  
They wandered into some high-end boutique where the saleswoman immediately pounced.  
  
""Miss, you simply must try this dress! It's our signature piece, and with your figure, you'd look absolutely stunning.""  
  
Leister waved dismissively. ""Get whatever you want, babe. Money's no object.""  
  
Before Noelia could respond, a sickeningly sweet voice cut through the air.  
  
""Ugh, signature pieces are so last decade. Talk about dated.""  
  
Anita Duke sauntered over, all fake smiles and designer everything, picking up a trendy little number.  
  
""Now this is what I call fashion. So fresh and youthful.""  
  
She turned to Noelia with mock innocence. ""Don't you think so?""  
  
The challenge in her eyes was obvious.  
  
So this is the little slut from last night. Moving fast, aren't we?  
  
Leister's face went dark, shooting Anita a warning look.  
  
But she pressed on, emboldened. Noelia was such a pushover—what was the worst that could happen?  
  
""Oops, silly me."" Anita's voice dripped fake concern. ""I forgot you're twenty-six now, Noelia. These cute little dresses probably aren't age-appropriate anymore. You just can't pull them off like you used to. Sorry...""  
  
Her smirk was pure victory.  
  
Noelia actually laughed, casually checking the price tag.  
  
""You're right, it is very... youthful. But I guess some people mistake cheap for trendy.""  
  
She paused, letting that sink in.  
  
""Or maybe cheap people are just drawn to cheap things.""  
  
""See, trends come and go every season—they're basically disposable. But classics? They're timeless.""  
  
Did this bitch just call me cheap? Disposable?  
  
Anita's face went white under all that makeup.  
  
She turned to Leister with tears welling up, expecting him to defend her like he usually did.  
  
Instead, he tightened his arms around Noelia. ""My wife's absolutely right. Classics are always better. Trends are so... disposable.""  
  
Anita bit her lip, eyes filling with tears. ""You're right. How could someone like me compete with Noelia? She's got everything—your love, your protection. Not like me..."" She let her voice break. ""I'm sorry for bothering you.""  
  
She turned to leave, all tragic and wounded.  
  
Leister's jaw clenched as he watched her go, clearly torn.  
  
But then he caught himself, staying put while his eyes followed Anita's retreating figure.  
  
Noelia noticed everything. She let out a bitter laugh and walked over to the most expensive dress in the store.  
  
""I'll take this one. The priciest you've got.""  
  
Leister snapped back to attention, immediately pulling out his black card. ""Whatever my wife wants. Ring up everything she's looked at.""  
  
The saleswoman practically bounced with excitement.  
  
""Mr. Devereux really spoils you, Mrs. Devereux!""  
  
He grinned. ""She's my wife. If I don't spoil her, who will?""  
  
Noelia's smile was pure ice.  
  
...  
  
Outside the boutique, Noelia's energy had completely flatlined.  
  
Leister noticed and made her sit on a bench while he went to get her favorite bubble tea.  
  
He used to read her moods like this. Wonder if he does the same for his little side piece.  
  
He came back with the drink, straw already in. ""Here, try it. Same as always?""  
  
She took a small sip, her expression unreadable.  
  
Same taste. Different man.  
  
Her phone buzzed with a text from an unknown number.  
  
So, how'd it feel watching me with your husband last night? Pretty rough, huh?  
  
Just so you know, every night he's not home? He's with me. And honey, he REALLY likes me. We go through a whole box of condoms every time. ?  
  
Noelia's face stayed blank, but her eyes went arctic.  
  
Want to make a bet? He's about to ditch you to come see me.  
  
No way. Leister's an asshole, but he's not stupid enough to abandon me in public.  
  
But apparently, he was.  
  
She watched him check his phone, that familiar smile creeping across his face as he typed back.  
  
When he looked up, his expression was all business.  
  
""Babe, something came up at work. I'll have the driver take you home, okay?""  
  
""Ha...""  
  
Noelia glanced at her phone, where a screenshot showed Leister and Anita's flirty conversation.  
  
So this is his ""emergency.""  
  
""Sure, go handle your business.""  
  
She swallowed the metallic taste in her throat and didn't fight it.  
  
Leister looked almost confused by her calm reaction. Usually she'd pout and beg him to stay. The empty feeling in his chest was... unsettling.  
  
His phone kept buzzing, pulling him back to reality.  
  
Noelia's just being mature about it.  
  
He left without another thought.  
  
The second he was gone, she dumped the bubble tea in the trash.  
  
Minutes later, another text from Anita—this time with a very explicit photo.  
  
The unloved one is always the side piece. Look how crazy he is about me. ?  
  
Noelia typed back: Perfect match—trash with trash. Hope you're happy together.  
  
Radio silence after that.  
  
...  
  
Back home, Noelia continued packing methodically.  
  
She pulled out her old design books and sketches from the closet, carefully placing them in boxes.  
  
These were her treasures. If she'd never married Leister, maybe she'd have been someone completely different...  
  
Better late than never.  
  
She was being careful, packing just a little each day. Anyone paying attention would notice.  
  
But Leister wasn't paying attention to anything.  
  
After finishing, she walked to the calendar and marked a big X through the 25th.  
  
Twenty-eight days left, you bastard.  
  
She heard the front door open—he was back.  
  
When Leister pushed open the bedroom door, he found her standing by the calendar. Those red X's looked ominous somehow.  
  
""What's with all the marks, babe?""  
  
His voice was tight with sudden anxiety.  
  
Chapter 3  
  
Noelia capped her pen, her voice eerily calm.  
  
""Just marking off days until our anniversary. Don't want to forget when you should open that gift.""  
  
She straightened his tie, her downcast eyes completely detached.  
  
Leister melted instantly, taking her soft hands in his. ""Of course I'll remember, babe. I think about that present every day—I can't wait to see what it is.""  
  
Can't wait, huh?  
  
Her smile was razor-thin as she caught a sweet aroma from the bag in his hand.  
  
""Tiramisu?""  
  
""Ha, my little foodie's nose never fails."" He grinned and booped her nose, handing over the elegant pastry box. ""Your favorite from that place downtown.""  
  
This used to be their thing—Leister would wait in those ridiculous lines just to get her tiramisu from that tiny Italian café.  
  
He'd always tease her: ""You're so easy to please.""  
  
And she'd laugh back: ""When you love someone, the little things matter most.""  
  
Now she took the box mechanically. Same sweet taste, same creamy texture.  
  
Different man.  
  
Leister watched her for a long moment before clearing his throat.  
  
""About that dress you liked today—turns out someone had already reserved it. The salesgirl screwed up. Let me get you something even better, okay?""  
  
Noelia paused mid-bite, the tiramisu suddenly tasting like sawdust.  
  
So everything has a price tag after all.  
  
He was going to give her favorite things to his mistress.  
  
She swallowed the burning sensation in her throat. ""Sure, whatever.""  
  
Keep the dress. Keep the man. I don't want either anymore.  
  
...  
  
Monday morning hit like a freight train.  
  
Noelia had barely walked into the office when Beatrice Rossi came flying over, practically hyperventilating.  
  
""Whoa, Bea, what's wrong?""  
  
""Noelia, we have a major problem—""  
  
...  
  
She stormed into the CEO's office and slammed a folder on Leister's desk.  
  
""You're replacing my endorsed model? Without even discussing it with me?""  
  
Her voice cracked with fury and hurt.  
  
Leister immediately stood and pulled her into his arms, rubbing her back. ""Hey, breathe. Getting worked up isn't good for you.""  
  
""This is my fault—I should've talked to you first.""  
  
""But your original choice had some... personal issues that came to light. We had no choice.""  
  
He handed her the file.  
  
After reading it, her anger cooled slightly. ""Fine. Who's the replacement?""  
  
""Anita Duke. She's with Cielo Media, trending pretty hard online right now. Actually, she's that girl we bumped into yesterday—small world, right?""  
  
The words hit like a sledgehammer.  
  
Leister continued obliviously. ""Market research shows she's perfect for our demographic. The numbers don't lie.""  
  
""What do you think?""  
  
Noelia's throat felt like it was full of broken glass.  
  
He's making his mistress the face of my project.  
  
""What if I said she was completely wrong for this? Would you replace her?""  
  
Leister hesitated.  
  
The pause said everything.  
  
He's actually weighing whether to choose me or his side piece.  
  
""Never mind."" She pushed away from him, her voice arctic. ""Do whatever you want.""  
  
The coldness in her tone made him flinch. They'd had disagreements before, but never like this—never with her shutting down completely.  
  
""Noelia, wait—""  
  
But she was already gone, the elevator doors closing between them.  
  
He stood there, suddenly regretting last night's promise to Anita.  
  
""Leister...""  
  
Soft arms wrapped around him from behind as Anita pressed against his back.  
  
His mood was already sour, but he turned and kissed her forehead anyway.  
  
""What did I tell you about public displays? Go back to your office.""  
  
Anita pouted, hurt flashing in her eyes. ""Sorry, I just missed you so much. It won't happen again...""  
  
""Good girl.""  
  
Her obedience pleased him. He softened, giving her another quick kiss before heading back inside.  
  
Anita smiled sweetly until he was gone, then her expression turned venomous.  
  
Your move, Noelia.  
  
...  
  
Back in her office, Noelia was sketching jewelry designs for the competition, completely absorbed when Leister walked in carrying an elegant gift box.  
  
The jewelry set she'd admired earlier.  
  
She quickly shoved her sketches into a drawer.  
  
""I'm sorry about earlier. Please don't be mad."" He started massaging her shoulders. ""Forgive me?""  
  
She shrugged away from his touch. ""I'm not mad. Just busy. You should get back to work.""  
  
Her tone was pleasant but her eyes were ice.  
  
This wasn't the reaction he expected. Usually, any gift—even a single rose—would make her light up with joy.  
  
Now? Nothing.  
  
He was about to say something when his assistant knocked. ""Mr. Devereux? The board meeting?""  
  
Reluctantly, he left.  
  
The moment the door closed, Noelia picked up her phone.  
  
""I need to sell a jewelry set. Donate the proceeds to... let's see... the city waste management program.""  
  
The confused silence on the other end was almost funny.  
  
Her desk phone rang immediately after.  
  
""Noelia, there's a welcome dinner tonight at Le Jardin Tranquille for the new spokesperson. Eight PM.""  
  
Despite her feelings about Anita, this was business. ""I'll be there.""  
  
...  
  
Le Jardin Tranquille was New York's most exclusive restaurant, all glass walls and hanging gardens.  
  
Noelia arrived in an elegant white suit, immediately spotting Anita holding court in the center of the room, draped in that gorgeous dress.  
  
The same dress she'd wanted.  
  
Even knowing Leister had given her things to his mistress, seeing it still felt like a knife to the chest.  
  
Anita noticed her and smiled brilliantly, as if to say: See? He spoils me, not you.  
  
""Anita, that dress is absolutely stunning! Isn't it like, crazy expensive?""  
  
""Who bought it for you? Must be someone special!""  
  
Anita blushed prettily, making sure Noelia could hear every word.  
  
""My boyfriend insisted on getting it. Said I was the only one who could make it look that good."" She emphasized each word like a weapon. ""No one else could even come close.""  
  
""Your boyfriend sounds amazing! Almost as generous as Mr. Devereux with Noelia!""  
  
""Right? Some women are just so lucky!""  
  
Noelia's nails dug into her palms, but her expression remained neutral.  
  
So this is how tender he is with his mistress.  
  
""Boyfriend?"" Noelia's voice cut through the chatter like ice as she stepped forward, her presence commanding the room.  
  
Anita felt a chill but stood her ground. ""That's right!""  
  
She twisted the knife deeper. ""He's always surprising me with little gifts... Last night he brought me tiramisu from that cute Italian place. So sweet of him!""  
  
Tiramisu.  
  
The same tiramisu he'd given her. After his mistress.  
  
Noelia felt like she was being burned alive and stomped on simultaneously.  
  
Anita's eyes glittered with triumph. Let's see you act superior now.  
  
But Noelia just smiled—cold, sharp, dangerous.

1lof3p3,https://www.reddit.com/r/EndTipping/comments/1lof3p3/mala_soup_place_couldve_been_selfcheckout_but/,Mala soup place could've been self-checkout but used servers instead and asked for tips,"So there's this mala soup place that just opened in my area, which I was really excited about because I was familiar with mala soup restaurants in Asia. Usually the format of the restaurant is you grab the ingredients you want, then go to this POS to weigh the ingredients, pick your broth, etc. and pay. Then you hand over your ingredients to the kitchen staff and wait for your order number to be called and pick up yourself.

For that mala soup here in US, it was following the exact same format except when I was about to check out, sort of out of muscle memory, the staff told me don't check out and we're supposed to pay after the meal. A lot of ppl in front and behind me were about to do the same thing. Then I went to grab a table then they brought me my meal, and after we were done the staff brought a tablet over to me to pay obviously with suggested tips. And honestly I tipped 0 sort of not intentionally but more out of muscle memory because usually I see those tablets at coffee shops where there's really no servers.

Apparently my friends kind of teased me for giving 0 because apparently they said the staff looked shocked or whatev but honestly I'm a bit irritated like why make the system less efficient just so they can take tips??? It srsly could've been self-check out I 1000% wouldn't mind having my number called and grabbing my plate instead of having this roundabout process of paying later.

Has anyone ever encountered a similar place??",4,1751307835.0,EndTipping,2,0.83,False

1loeziz,https://www.reddit.com/r/DollarGeneral/comments/1loeziz/dollar_general_is_heartless/,Dollar General is heartless 💔,"My wife and I have been utiliIng the vast amount of useful things Dollar General discards regularly. We have been homeless in our current location for over 6 months and have found so many useful things in the dumpster at our nearby Dollar General. 

In the last 6 months we have found immense amounts of food, clothing and other useful items. One time we found close to 1k dollars worth of coffee that was just barely outside of the use by date; from pods and ground coffee including every brand that DG carries. We were able to sell it on marketplace for over 200 dollars that went towards necessities our situation demanded. I can't begin to explain the huge amounts of food that we were able to eat or giveaway. Mainly snacks and other unhealthy foods but still something edible that tastes great. We have even saved so much OTC medicine from the landfill that was beneficial to so many people who probably would have done without. The list of products we have rescued from the dumpster is almost unimaginable. Things that we were unable to use ourselves or sold on marketplace were offered for free on pay it forward groups. So many grateful people that it makes your heart smile. 

However, through all of the great things Dollar General's discarded treasures have accomplished they ended the help yesterday. They had their dumpster enclosed by a fence. The gate is locked and looks secure. A note on the enclosure states:""😃 Our cameras are now working and if you access this dumpster you are trespassing and the police will be notified. 😃""

Before the statements are made by the Captain Obviouses of the Reddit Kingdom. I would like to clarify that we have never left a mess. We have always left the area exactly the way we found it. With almost certainty I believe we are the only people who utilize this dumpster. No people or messes are ever seen, so I'm guessing we are the sole beneficiaries. We don't interfere with DG whatsoever. In fact we are loyal customers inside their business. 

Taking into consideration all of the things we have done or haven't done;in reguards to Dollar General's business and the items they have deemed as useless. Does anyone have a logical reason why DG would find it necessary to make their dumpster illegal to pilfer. Like I have truthfully stated the only impact we have left on this business is positive. Please let me know if somehow we did something to upset this business. Trying to learn from a mistake we may have made. Thank you everyone. God Bless the world.

1loewmd,https://i.redd.it/8y9nerbfv3af1.png,Let's Talk Podcast Monetization - 7 Proven Ways to Actually Make Money from Your Podcast,"Hey podcasters! After seeing so many ""how do I monetize my podcast?"" posts, I wanted to share some practical monetization strategies that actually work.

**The Big 7 that most successful podcasters use:**

🎯 **Sponsorships** \- Industry standard is $18-25 per 1,000 downloads for traditional ads. Start reaching out once you hit 1,000+ downloads.

💰 **Affiliate Marketing** \- Promote products you actually use. Amazon Associates is beginner-friendly, and I still use it! But, higher-ticket items ($1K+ courses/tools) pay MUCH better commissions.

📦 **Your Own Products** \- Best ROI since you keep 100% profit. Digital products (courses, eBooks) have no shipping costs and can be sold repeatedly.

🤝 **Services** \- Coaching, consulting, or freelance work. Your podcast is basically a portfolio proving your expertise.

☕ **Donations** \- Patreon, Buy Me a Coffee, PayPal. Surprisingly effective if you have engaged listeners who value your content.

🎪 **Live Events** \- Workshops, masterminds, virtual conferences. High profit margins but requires more planning.

₿ **Cryptocurrency** \- Value4Value payments through Bitcoin ""boostagrams."" Growing trend in the podcasting world.

**Quick reality check:** You'll need at least 1,000 consistent downloads before most monetization becomes worthwhile. Focus on growing your audience first!

**The secret sauce:** Whatever you choose, make sure it genuinely helps your audience. The most successful podcast monetization feels natural, not forced.

I found a really comprehensive guide that breaks down these 7 methods PLUS 17 additional creative monetization ideas I hadn't even considered (like podcast licensing, corporate partnerships, and subscription boxes!).
