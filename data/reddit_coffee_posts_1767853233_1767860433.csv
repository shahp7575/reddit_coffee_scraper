I recently achieved my PhD and got gifted the round sum of 400€ (Europe) to spend on coffee.

So I need to upgrade from my Molino Molita electric grinder used with a moka pot (it's been 7 years), and I am willing to discover the pourover and AeroPress world first. Espresso may happen later, but it looks like a few years will pass before I acquire a good machine.

Usage: daily coffee (often AP or moka) and post-lunch slow, enjoyable coffee on weekends (the ideal sweet spot for pour-over, I think, currently mainly AP or FP).

So with such a sum available, I don't know if I should directly aim for a high-end coffee grinder (K-Ultra, Comandante) that will last for years, a mid-range option such as the X-Ultra (from what I looked up, it looks like it sits alone in a weird middle spot, a premium-looking mid-range grinder), or entry-level portable good-quality ones like the Kingrinder K6, Timemore S3, or 1Zpresso Q.

I also need to budget for a scale, a kettle or at least a thermometer, and a Hario Switch.

What's your opinion?
IMO, I should first buy a hand grinder (then which one?) and learn to prepare good specialty coffee with the things I own (AP, FP, moka) before moving to pour-over. But I am so lost in all the battles around Reddit.

I am torn between the ""buy once, cry once"" approach of a high-end grinder and the idea that I won't perceive the taste difference between a 100€ and a 250€ grinder.",1,1767859950.0,pourover,0,1.0,False

1q764p7,http://misbellgroup.com,What Are Geometric Designs? How to Use Geometric Designs in Modern Interiors?,"

Geometry is everywhere from the symmetry of nature to the structure of architecture. In interior design, geometric patterns are more than just shapes; they are a visual language that can define space, movement, and emotion. When used thoughtfully, geometric designs can infuse interiors with bold energy, contemporary style, and artistic depth.
At Misbell Group, we believe in the transformative power of shapes. In this blog, we’ll explore what geometric designs are, and how to use them effectively in modern interior spaces, from walls and floors to furniture and accessories.

What Are Geometric Designs?

The Harmony of Shapes, Lines, and Patterns
Geometric design refers to the use of precise shapes and patterns, often repeated or layered, to create visual interest. These can include:
Circles – often soft and harmonious


Squares and Rectangles – create structure and order


Triangles – dynamic and directional


Hexagons, Diamonds, Zigzags – add energy and rhythm


Lines and Grids – guide movement and create balance


Rooted in mathematics and symmetry, geometric designs have been used in art, architecture, and decoration for thousands of years from Islamic mosaics to Art Deco patterns.
Why Geometric Designs Work in Modern Interiors
A Blend of Simplicity and Sophistication
Modern interiors often emphasize clean lines, minimalism, and functionality. Geometric patterns complement this aesthetic by adding:
Visual structure without clutter


Bold accents that feel intentional and modern


Balance and proportion through repetition and symmetry


Playful contrasts between soft furnishings and sharp forms


Whether you're working with neutral palettes or vibrant colors, geometric elements help to anchor a space and express personality.

How to Use Geometric Designs in Your Interiors

Let’s explore practical and creative ways to incorporate geometric elements in different parts of your home or commercial space.

1. Walls: From Flat to Fabulous

a. Geometric Wallpaper or Paint Patterns
Accent walls using geometric motifs add drama and dimension. Try a herringbone, chevron, or tessellation pattern in bold or monochrome tones.
b. 3D Wall Panels with Geometric Textures
Materials like MDF, gypsum, or stone can be laser-cut or molded into raised geometric panels. This adds both texture and depth.
c. Wall Tiles with Geometric Cuts
Waterjet cut tiles in marble, glass, or metal offer precise, intricate designs that stand out in luxury interiors.

2. Floors: Geometry Underfoot

a. Patterned Tiles
Hexagonal or triangular tiles are excellent for bathrooms, kitchens, or foyers creating movement without overwhelming the space.
b. Parquet and Herringbone Wood Floors
Wood laid in geometric patterns (chevron, basketweave) adds elegance and sophistication with a timeless feel.

3. Furniture and Decor

a. Furniture Shapes
Opt for chairs, tables, or shelving with angular or curved frames. Think hexagonal coffee tables or circular bookshelves.
b. Textile Patterns
Cushions, rugs, and curtains with geometric prints can tie a room together especially in minimalist settings.
c. Mirrors and Art
Wall decor in geometric frames or abstract forms works as both function and statement.

4. Lighting Fixtures

Pendant lights, chandeliers, or wall sconces in polygonal or spherical shapes are a subtle but powerful way to bring geometry into the mix.
Balancing Geometric Designs
Don’t Overwhelm Complement
While geometric patterns are visually striking, they must be balanced with softer, simpler elements to avoid a chaotic look. Tips include:
Limit bold patterns to one or two surfaces per room


Use neutral colors to let the shapes speak for themselves


Pair sharp lines with soft textures like velvet, linen, or natural wood


Repeat similar shapes (e.g., hexagons) in different elements for cohesion


The key is intentional placement and thoughtful repetition.
Popular Styles That Embrace Geometry
Interior Style
How It Uses Geometry
Modern Minimalist
Clean lines, grid patterns, and neutral tones
Mid-Century Modern
Organic shapes, repeating circles, and angular legs
Art Deco
Bold, symmetrical patterns and metallic finishes
Scandinavian
Subtle geometric motifs in soft color palettes
Contemporary
Mixed materials and contrast using geometric layers


Geometric designs offer a perfect harmony between art and structure. They bring rhythm to rooms, highlight architectural details, and give interiors a fresh, modern personality. Whether you’re creating an eye-catching accent wall or adding geometric decor, these patterns help define and energize your space.
At Misbell Group, we offer a wide range of wall panels, waterjet mosaics, and tile solutions that embrace the precision and beauty of geometric design. Let us help you turn your space into a stunning composition of shape, shadow, and symmetry.

1q763a1,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskMechanics/comments/1q763a1/driver_door_issues_in_colder_weather/,Driver door issues in colder weather,"I have a 2020 Skoda Karoq SportLine. Bought Feb last year so first winter with the car.

\- First issue: Car was frozen overnight. I couldn't open the drivers side door so opened it from the inside via the passenger side. The drivers door then wouldn't close (latch). I gave the latch a clean/dry and a spray with de-icer and it then latched without issue. Had no further problems with the latch not closing

\- Second issue: 2 days later I was out in the car and stopped for lunch. It wasn't particularly cold and the car hadn't been frozen over that morning. After lunch I got back in the car, the door latched however the OBC didn't recognise that the door was latched and was telling me it was open. A couple of restarts of the car and open and closing of the door done the trick and the car registered the door was closed and again no problem with that since.

\-Third issue: I had to defrost the car this morning. I drove the car for 40 minutes or so and pulled into the garage to grab a coffee. The door wouldn't open from the inside this time. I had to put down the window to let myself out. 5 minutes later after parking at work I was able to let myself out using the inside lever without issue.

I apologise for the vast amount of detail but there is clearly a link between the three issues I have had. 

I have sprayed the latch with WD40 once the temp was up at 6 degrees then after an hour with some silicone lubricant and worked the handle open and closed a few times to try and work it round the mechanism after the second issue I had.

  
I'm in Scotland and we are currently in a cold snap but no colder than -4 so I would not expect to see issues at these temperatures.

Most likely some water ingress into the mechanism and it is freezing over now that the weather is getting colder however was just looking for some expert advice before a trip to the dealership.

Chapter 1: The Marriage Deal

Matthew Langford, a man in his thirties, carried a raw and unfiltered desire that was almost palpable.

Adriana Xander had lost count of how long he had been relentless. Her body felt as if it were unraveling, overwhelmed by a lust so fierce it left her gasping for air.

Matthew knew every inch of her intimately, his touch precise and deliberate. Not a single caress was wasted; his movements were smooth, practiced, and sure.

“Clear my schedule starting tomorrow. I’m taking the week off. Book two tickets to Neocoralis,” Matthew declared as he finally pulled away, standing beside the bed while slowly dressing.

Adriana shifted her aching waist, a spark lighting her tired eyes. “You’re taking me on vacation, Matthew?”

He paused, a slight frown crossing his face as he looked down at her. “I’m going with Natasha.”

Her smile faltered instantly, replaced by an awkward lowering of her gaze. “Okay, Mr. Langford…” she murmured, the words tasting bitter.

Noticing the sudden paleness that crept over her face, Matthew’s tone softened slightly. “Adriana, you’re just an orphan. You’re young. I can’t marry you.”

She met his eyes, forcing a tight, bitter smile. “I never expected you to marry me. But now that Ms. Jones is divorced and back, should we end this… affair?”

Matthew’s expression darkened. He reached out to gently rub her head in an attempt to soothe her, then placed a card on the nightstand. “Be good. Buy whatever you want.”

“Mr. Langford, I don’t want to be a mistress,” Adriana said stubbornly, her gaze unwavering. She knew deep down he would eventually marry Natasha Jones.

“You’re jumping ahead. We’ll deal with that when the time comes. Don’t throw tantrums. Whether this ends or not isn’t up to you.” Growing impatient, Matthew glanced at her one last time before leaving.

As the door clicked shut behind him, Adriana’s ears rang with silence. The world around her seemed to fade away.

Adriana was an orphan. During her freshman year, her appearance had drawn the cruel wrath of Mia Langford, a wealthy girl whose bullying left Adriana deaf in one ear, with a crushed pinky toe, and almost blinded by a cigarette burn.

Someone had recorded the abuse and posted it online, sparking a scandal that engulfed the school.

The administration summoned the parents. Representing Mia was Matthew—her brother.

Perhaps to protect the Langford Group’s reputation, or maybe out of pity, Matthew reached out to the battered Adriana. The first words he spoke to her were, “Don’t be scared. I won’t let anyone hurt you again.”

Spineless. Pathetic.

Adriana had fallen for him. At her most vulnerable, Matthew fed every fantasy she held about love and safety.

She once believed he was her salvation. But now… he didn’t love her. He only refused to let her go.

At the Langford Group.

\*\*\*

Matthew had a meeting to finalize his handover. Natasha waited patiently in his office.

Soon, they would be flying to Neocoralis together, ready to spend seven romantic days side by side.

Adriana set a cup of coffee in front of Natasha, her chest tightening as if it were being sliced open. “Ms. Jones, enjoy your coffee.”

Natasha glanced at her with a gentle smile.

She came from a privileged background, perfectly suited to Matthew. Childhood sweethearts, she exuded a refined, elegant aura. Born into wealth, she moved effortlessly with grace—just sitting there, her confidence burned into Adriana’s eyes.

Adriana knew she had lost. She never truly stood a chance.

A prince never really falls for a poor girl. He only uses her to pass the time.

Setting down the cup, Adriana practically fled the office.

Confidence deserted her. The label of orphan, the weight of poverty, the scars left by abuse—all screamed insecurity from every fiber of her being.

“Mr. Langford and Ms. Jones are going on their honeymoon? I heard they’re official now. Once they return, the engagement will be announced. Both families have already given their blessing,” coworkers whispered in the pantry.

As Adriana poured herself a cup of tea, the boiling water suddenly splashed onto her hand, turning her skin bright red.

The cup slipped from her grasp and shattered on the floor. Startled, she hurried to run her burn under cold water.

Matthew and Natasha were getting married.

That meant she and Matthew were finished. And so was her internship at the Langford Group.

“Adriana, Mr. Langford wants you to drive him and Ms. Jones to the airport at 11,” a coworker called out.

She forced a bitter smile. Matthew… was merciless.

She knew this was deliberate. There were drivers available, but he chose her—to remind her of her place, to crush any foolish hopes she might harbor.

In the end, both Matthew and Mia were bullies, just with different methods of breaking people.

One shattered her body. The other crushed her already broken heart.

Pulling out her phone, Adriana hesitated for a long moment before dialing a number she had once blocked.

“Hello, Mr. Lincoln. You once said… if I agreed to marry you, you’d sponsor my studies in Pastalia. Does that offer still stand?” Her voice trembled with uncertainty.

Marriage might be her only escape from Haldoria, and the only way to break free from Matthew.

“Think it through,” the man’s deep voice replied. “Come to Clarke Residence on the 13th at 7 p.m. We’ll discuss the details.”

Her smile faltered instantly, replaced by an awkward lowering of her gaze. “Okay, Mr. Langford…” she murmured, the words tasting bitter.

Noticing the sudden paleness that crept over her face, Matthew’s tone softened slightly. “Adriana, you’re just an orphan. You’re young. I can’t marry you.”

She met his eyes, forcing a tight, bitter smile. “I never expected you to marry me. But now that Ms. Jones is divorced and back, should we end this… affair?”

Matthew’s expression darkened. He reached out to gently rub her head in an attempt to soothe her, then placed a card on the nightstand. “Be good. Buy whatever you want.”

“Mr. Langford, I don’t want to be a mistress,” Adriana said stubbornly, her gaze unwavering. She knew deep down he would eventually marry Natasha Jones.

“You’re jumping ahead. We’ll deal with that when the time comes. Don’t throw tantrums. Whether this ends or not isn’t up to you.” Growing impatient, Matthew glanced at her one last time before leaving.

As the door clicked shut behind him, Adriana’s ears rang with silence. The world around her seemed to fade away.

Adriana was an orphan. During her freshman year, her appearance had drawn the cruel wrath of Mia Langford, a wealthy girl whose bullying left Adriana deaf in one ear, with a crushed pinky toe, and almost blinded by a cigarette burn.

Someone had recorded the abuse and posted it online, sparking a scandal that engulfed the school.

The administration summoned the parents. Representing Mia was Matthew—her brother.

Perhaps to protect the Langford Group’s reputation, or maybe out of pity, Matthew reached out to the battered Adriana. The first words he spoke to her were, “Don’t be scared. I won’t let anyone hurt you again.”

Spineless. Pathetic.

Adriana had fallen for him. At her most vulnerable, Matthew fed every fantasy she held about love and safety.

She once believed he was her salvation. But now… he didn’t love her. He only refused to let her go.

At the Langford Group.

\*\*\*

Matthew had a meeting to finalize his handover. Natasha waited patiently in his office.

Soon, they would be flying to Neocoralis together, ready to spend seven romantic days side by side.

Adriana set a cup of coffee in front of Natasha, her chest tightening as if it were being sliced open. “Ms. Jones, enjoy your coffee.”

Natasha glanced at her with a gentle smile.

She came from a privileged background, perfectly suited to Matthew. Childhood sweethearts, she exuded a refined, elegant aura. Born into wealth, she moved effortlessly with grace—just sitting there, her confidence burned into Adriana’s eyes.

Adriana knew she had lost. She never truly stood a chance.

A prince never really falls for a poor girl. He only uses her to pass the time.

Setting down the cup, Adriana practically fled the office.

Confidence deserted her. The label of orphan, the weight of poverty, the scars left by abuse—all screamed insecurity from every fiber of her being.

“Mr. Langford and Ms. Jones are going on their honeymoon? I heard they’re official now. Once they return, the engagement will be announced. Both families have already given their blessing,” coworkers whispered in the pantry.

As Adriana poured herself a cup of tea, the boiling water suddenly splashed onto her hand, turning her skin bright red.

The cup slipped from her grasp and shattered on the floor. Startled, she hurried to run her burn under cold water.

Matthew and Natasha were getting married.

That meant she and Matthew were finished. And so was her internship at the Langford Group.

“Adriana, Mr. Langford wants you to drive him and Ms. Jones to the airport at 11,” a coworker called out.

She forced a bitter smile. Matthew… was merciless.

She knew this was deliberate. There were drivers available, but he chose her—to remind her of her place, to crush any foolish hopes she might harbor.

In the end, both Matthew and Mia were bullies, just with different methods of breaking people.

One shattered her body. The other crushed her already broken heart.

Pulling out her phone, Adriana hesitated for a long moment before dialing a number she had once blocked.

“Hello, Mr. Lincoln. You once said… if I agreed to marry you, you’d sponsor my studies in Pastalia. Does that offer still stand?” Her voice trembled with uncertainty.

Marriage might be her only escape from Haldoria, and the only way to break free from Matthew.

“Think it through,” the man’s deep voice replied. “Come to Clarke Residence on the 13th at 7 p.m. We’ll discuss the details.”

1q7618s,https://www.reddit.com/r/ConnectBetter/comments/1q7618s/how_to_hold_a_conversation_without_running_out_of/,How to Hold a Conversation Without Running Out of Things to Say: The Psychology-Based Guide That Actually Works,"You know that moment when you're talking to someone and suddenly your mind just... blanks? Like a computer screen freezing mid-sentence. You're standing there, mouth slightly open, brain screaming for literally anything to say, and all that comes out is ""so... yeah."" Painful, right?

I used to think I was just bad at conversations. Turns out, most people feel this way. After diving deep into communication research, psychology books, and studying how charismatic people actually talk (not the fake ""just be confident bro"" advice), I realized something: Running out of things to say isn't about being boring. It's about not having a system.

Here's what actually works.

## Step 1: Stop Trying to Be Interesting

Here's the paradox that'll blow your mind: The more you try to come up with interesting things to say, the faster you'll run out of material. Why? Because you're in your head, not in the conversation.

The shift: Stop performing. Start being curious.

The best conversationalists aren't the ones with endless stories. They're the ones who make OTHER people feel interesting. When you're genuinely curious about someone, you never run out of questions. And questions lead to topics. Topics lead to stories. Stories lead to connections.

Quick fix: Next conversation, set one rule for yourself. Ask three follow up questions before you talk about yourself. Watch what happens.

## Step 2: Master the Thread Technique

This is straight from Never Eat Alone by Keith Ferrazzi (bestselling networking bible, the guy literally built his career on conversation skills). Every statement someone makes has multiple threads you can pull on. Most people just let them hang there.

Someone says: ""I just got back from Colorado.""

Weak response: ""Oh cool.""

Thread pulling: You've got at least five threads here.
* What brought you to Colorado?
* How was the weather compared to here?
* Did you do any hiking or outdoor stuff?
* Was this your first time or do you go regularly?
* Are you more of a mountain person or beach person?

Each answer creates NEW threads. It's infinite. You literally cannot run out of things to say if you're paying attention to threads.

Pro move: When someone mentions anything, location, hobby, job, food, literally anything, there's a ""why"" question hiding in there. ""What made you get into that?"" or ""How'd that come about?"" are conversation gold.

## Step 3: Build Your Experience Bank

Look, if you do nothing, see no one, and experience nothing, yeah, you're gonna struggle with conversation. Not because you're boring, but because you've got nothing feeding your conversational well.

The fix: Consume interesting inputs. Read weird articles. Listen to podcasts about random topics. Try new restaurants. Take different routes home. Watch documentaries. The goal isn't to become a walking encyclopedia. It's to have a varied mental library to draw from.

I started using this app called Finch (it's technically a self care app with a cute bird, don't judge me). It gives you daily prompts and tiny challenges that get you doing small new things. Sounds silly but it actually helps you accumulate micro experiences that become conversation material.

BeFreed is an AI-powered learning app that pulls from books, research papers, and expert interviews to create personalized audio content based on what you want to learn. Type in ""improve social skills"" or ""become a better conversationalist,"" and it generates a custom podcast with an adaptive learning plan tailored to your goals. You control the depth, from quick 10-minute summaries to 40-minute deep dives with examples. The voice options are surprisingly addictive, there's even a smoky, sarcastic style that makes learning feel less like a chore. Built by a team from Columbia and Google, it's been useful for fitting real learning into commute time without needing to sit down with a full book.

Book rec that changed how I think about this: Range by David Epstein. This book destroys the myth that you need to be deeply specialized in one thing. Epstein shows how generalists, people with broad interests, actually have massive advantages in problem solving and yes, conversation. The research is insane. Scientists, artists, and successful people across fields all had one thing in common: diverse experiences. This book will make you question everything you think you know about expertise and make you feel way better about having multiple interests. Insanely good read.

## Step 4: Use the IFR Method (Inquire, Follow, Relate)

This is a system I picked up from studying improv comedy techniques. Yes, improv. Those people literally create conversations out of thin air.

Inquire: Ask an open ended question.  
Follow: Listen to the answer and ask a follow up based on what they said.  
Relate: Share something brief from your experience that connects.

Example:
* You: ""What's been taking up most of your time lately?"" (Inquire)
* Them: ""Honestly just trying to get better at cooking.""
* You: ""Oh interesting, what kind of cooking? Like specific cuisine or just general?"" (Follow)
* Them: ""I've been really into Thai food.""
* You: ""Dude, Thai food is no joke. I tried making pad thai once and it was a disaster. What's the hardest thing you've tried to make?"" (Relate + Inquire)

See how it flows? You're not monologuing. You're building together.

## Step 5: Embrace the Pause

This sounds counterintuitive but hear me out. Silence isn't your enemy. Awkward silence is only awkward if you make it awkward.

Confident people pause. They think before they speak. They let conversations breathe. When you're desperately trying to fill every second of silence, you come across as anxious. When you're comfortable with a beat of quiet, you seem confident.

The move: When there's a pause, take a breath. Smile slightly. Then either ask a question or make an observation about your surroundings. ""This coffee is actually really good"" or ""How do you know the host?"" or whatever fits. Pauses reset the conversation.

## Step 6: Have Go To Topics in Your Back Pocket

Yeah, having backup topics isn't cheating. It's smart. Charismatic people do this. They have mental categories they can pull from when conversation stalls.

The big five categories that almost always work:
* Travel/places: ""If you could live anywhere for a year, where would it be?""
* Food: ""What's your go to comfort food when you've had a rough day?""
* Childhood: ""What were you like as a kid?""
* Hypotheticals: ""Would you rather have the ability to fly or be invisible?""
* Passions: ""What's something you could talk about for hours without getting bored?""

Keep three of these loaded in your mental chamber. When things get quiet, fire one off.

## Step 7: Listen to How People Actually Talk

This might sound weird, but go listen to good podcast conversations. Not scripted interviews. Real flowing conversations. The Tim Ferriss Show is perfect for this. Ferriss is a master at pulling threads and keeping conversations going for hours. You'll notice he's not trying to be clever. He's just deeply curious and follows interesting threads.

Another one: WTF with Marc Maron. Maron makes people feel comfortable enough to go deep. His secret? He's vulnerable first. He shares his own awkwardness and struggles, which makes guests open up.

Study how they transition topics. How they circle back to earlier points. How they make connections between seemingly unrelated things. This is learnable.

## Step 8: Get Comfortable Sharing Small Vulnerabilities

The Charisma Myth by Olivia Fox Cabane breaks this down with actual neuroscience. When you share something slightly vulnerable, like ""Man, I totally blanked during that presentation yesterday,"" people's guards drop. They relate. They share back. Suddenly the conversation has depth.

You don't need to trauma dump. Just be human. Mention small struggles, funny failures, or honest opinions. It gives people permission to do the same.

## Step 9: Practice in Low Stakes Situations

You know where I got better at conversation? Talking to baristas, Uber drivers, and people in grocery store lines. Low stakes. No pressure. If it goes nowhere, who cares? You'll never see them again.

But here's what happened: I got comfortable with the rhythm of small talk. I learned which questions led somewhere and which ones died. I figured out my natural style. By the time I was in situations that mattered, conversations felt easier.

Your homework: This week, have one unnecessary conversation with a stranger. Coffee shop, wherever. Just practice.

## Step 10: Stop Fearing the End of Conversations

Not every conversation needs to last forever. Some conversations are meant to be five minutes. And that's okay. The pressure you feel to keep things going indefinitely is made up.

If a conversation naturally ends, you can literally just say ""Well, it was really nice talking to you"" and exit like a normal human. No one's judging you for ending a conversation. They're probably relieved too.

The goal isn't to talk forever. It's to make the time you do talk feel genuine and connected.

## Real talk for a second

Running out of things to say isn't a personality flaw. It's a skill gap. And skills can be built. You're not broken. You just haven't learned the mechanics yet. Every smooth talker you see had to learn this stuff too. Some figured it out naturally. Others, like most of us, had to be intentional about it.

Start with one technique from this list. Just one. Try it in your next three conversations. See what happens. Build from there. You'll be surprised how fast this becomes natural.",1,1767859281.0,ConnectBetter,0,1.0,False

Towards the damning end of court where I stuck up for myself and ridiculed for how the system made me homeless, I fled back to my home state back home with giving up. It didn’t work out there any better as I was taunted about failing in life. The abuse (physical, emotional, and psychological) resumed from childhood. 

It wasn’t long before I was homeless again, sometimes on the street and sometimes in a shelter. I did everything I could do to survive (sodomized in the streets and otherwise assaulted in the shelter system). The shelter system is very tough; mostly treated like criminals / addicts that SHOULD respect a bug-ridden 1” mattress, a boiled egg for breakfast, no lunch, and a dry hot dog with canned beans for dinner (no condiments). I do have pictures of the Salvation Army’s “for profit” BS… which would be shocking!

MOVING FORWARD, I met my roommate at a bar (after sitting at a coffee shop, they opened early and provided Wi-Fi) while I sat in the corner minding my own business looking for rental housing. I think I was a target…

He introduced himself and we became friendly. He eventually hired me to do “a bit of dusting,” to check out the place — and, with only my life to lose at the time, I checked it out! 

It was a hoarders home, but without any other choice? I was convinced to move in and create a home. I was asked to create their “home” that took me 18 months to get a start. It was bad… 

I didn’t know TWO of my roommates are insane alcoholics .. I’ve been assaulted, sexually assaulted, and there are holes on my bedroom door (when I took refuge in my room). 

I looked and still look for my own place, but my progressive disabilities make it real hard to finally live on my own. So, I’ve been here for about 10 years… 

I built up the rental home, got a tree off a sidewalk, taught my roommates how to cook from scratch (instead of ordering in); while I also did all domestic work, paid for upgrades by starving myself, and dealt with my own personal struggles.

They got a decorated tree, presents each year from me over Xmas .. they gave me nothing, not even a “Merry Christmas“ or a thank you. They also expected a full turkey dinner from me .. but as obnoxious drunks, they could never help despite my disabilities ..

Come to today, drinking from 4 a.m. ? I was told, “Just make the stuffing, don’t let the meat go to waste, loser, and you can do the frozen turkey later! We‘ll have the Stuffing as a SNACK *after* ‘our dinner’.” 

Well, they still expect a full turkey dinner ( fully on my dime, with only a Brussels sprouts contribution ), split up now .. and I have no desire to continue to make this their home at my full financial and physical and emotional cost ! 

im tired, let down, and not sleeping anyway due to my disabilities .. 

Am I overreacting for wanting to say, “FUCK YOU!” ?

This was mostly for added sugars. I haven’t had any sweets and the only sugar (besides the smoothie recipe below) I’ve had was in the form of creamer once by accident. That is all to say maybe I ate something that contained a small amount and I didn’t realize it. 

I was drinking this smoothie recipe to cope but then I remembered that broken down and blended fruits basically turn into added sugar. I wanted to see if this makes any difference. Keep in mind too, this smoothie basically substitutes a meal and I intermediate fast. 

Smoothie contents
1 avocado (ran out recently)
1 banana (2 sometimes because I ran out of avocados)
3 handfuls of blueberries
1-2 spoonfuls of pomegranate
1-3 handfuls of spinach (what the recipe normally calls for, only bought it again yesterday and was not including it)
1-2 handfuls of walnuts
1-2 big spoonfuls of zero sugar Greek yogurt
Raw honey (probably what negates the whole detox, only included because it is supposed to help with skin but nixing it for the rest of the detox)
Ginger
Turmeric
Black pepper
Garlic (sometimes)
Oregano (sometimes)
Coffee (sometimes)
Water
Ice

Basically, should I be starting from square one? What should I not include? Should I switch to yogurt bowls instead in order to prevent higher sugar intake? I do not have any sugar cravings probably due to the fact that the honey and fruits are fulfilling that spot.

She's a classmate from my college, when I used to just see her here and there in class, I didn't know her personally , but I was always curious about her, she seemed different from everyone I've ever met, she was quiet, peaceful, her eyes, and her smile, stirred something in me. I ended up texting her, asking her out for a coffee, and we did end up going out to eat a month later, after our midterms ended, I helped her with materials and important topics so she was like ""I wanna show how thankful I am"", and I am afraid it was just that, her showing appreciation for what I did to help, as she knew I wanted to go out with her.
We met once again for a movie a few days back, I asked her to hang out once before I leave home for holidays. Slowly as time has gone she now feels like the most beautiful thing in the world to me. She is not much expressive verbally , she doesn’t fill silence just to fill it, if a conversation clicks it just clicks. A quiet, self-contained personality she is. I like her for everything she is, but it makes it hard on me at the same time. There's no hints, from her side, I can't seem to notice any green signals, and I'm afraid telling her about my feelings would just put unnecessary trouble on her, create unnecessary pressure on her to hold feelings she hasn't agreed to hold yet. I feel empty, there's no next step, holidays have increased distance.
She doesn't text first, but she's always warm, polite, positive with anything i tell her or plan with her. I guess she let's me steer. 
I wanna text her more, i wanna talk to her, but now even a simple ""had lunch?"" text is hard for me to send to her. What if shes just forced to reply to me, and maybe with each time I reach out to her first, she'll be more sure that I like her? Idk what to do. 
I guess, what hurts me is that my shyness/nervousness/hesitance to fuck up around her doesn't let me show my feelings for her to see through her eyes, like the way I just casually handed her the earrings I got her as a gift, how I accidentally released the door on her while exiting the cinema hall, how I can't look at her properly while talking. I want to tell her what meeting her means for me, or what her existence feels to me. I don't wanna demand anything, i don't wanna ask for reassurance, I just wanna let her know.

He seems like a nice, fun, smart person to have around, but I feel no attraction towards him.

One year later, Guy and I are close friends. I've shared with him that I’m struggling with anxiety and depression. We're in contact on a daily basis and go out for drinks often. 

Guy is dropping subtle hints that he's attracted to me, but I ignore them. I have been happily celibate since the pandemic and I intend to keep it that way.

Guy invites me to eat dinner and watch a series at his place. The obvious thought comes to my mind, but I push it aside bc I actually want to watch the series. I tell myself nothing's gonna happen if I don't want it to, so I accept.

I go to his place, eat pasta he cooked, watch a few episodes on his couch. He looks a bit perplexed when I thank him for the evening and leave.

A few days later, he invites me over to watch more episodes. He orders some bad sushi, I pay for my part. When the last episode is over, I express my wish to go home, but it's cold outside, so I snuggle under the blanket for a moment.

We haven't had any previous physical contact, so I freeze when Guy's hand gropes my hip. I decide to stay and see if I can get any enjoyment out of the situation.

The sex is just plain boring. I do my best to get something out of it, but I don't pretend to enjoy it. After what feels like ages, it's finally over, so I excuse myself and rush out. I drive back home, scrub myself in the shower and go to sleep.

A couple of days later, I message him that I won't be having sex with him again bc I need intimacy to be meaningful, but it'd be cool to continue our friendship. He then demands that we meet for coffee. I'm bewildered by his sudden earnestness, but I decide to listen to what he has to say.

Face to face, Guy expresses that he's hurt that I assumed he's casual about sex. I explain I didn't intend to imply that, plus the reason for me not wanting to have more sex with him actually runs deeper.

I remind him that I'm in a terrible place mentally (I've already spoken to him about this extensively) so I'm trying out things to see what feels good - thus, I've now decided that I want to stick to celibacy. To this, he accuses me of using him as a test subject. I argue that I didn't even intend to have sex in the first place, and he points out he made it very obvious that HE did bc he lit candles in the living room. He also points out that it's unreasonable to expect a horny, straight man like him to not want sex from me.

I end up crying and justifying myself by saying I prob couldn't enjoy the sex bc of the meds I'm taking. He softens up. I pay for both our coffees and we leave.

So, AITA for letting Guy hit just to figure out if I could get any enjoyment out of it, even though I knew I probably wouldn't and would have to bruise his ego?",1,1767859040.0,AITAH,17,1.0,False

Big Success in her Career after Dumping her Ex-boyfriend
Chapter 1
Stefan Palmer once gave Verena Oliver a glass jar. 

He said to her, ""Every time you make me happy, I'll put a red bean inside it. When the jar is full, I'll marry you.""

But when Stefan once again left Verena alone for the sake of another woman, Verena grew completely disheartened. 

She poured out all the red beans and made some red bean soup. 

After finishing the red bean soup, she was hospitalized for three days due to acute gastroenteritis. 

She then realized something important. 

Just as one shouldn't keep spoiled food, one shouldn't hold on to spoiled love. 

She knew it was time to end her relationship with Stefan. 

... 

Verena stood in the airport arrival hall. Even before stepping outside, she could feel the biting cold wind sneaking in through the door cracks. 

Last week, when she left for her business trip, the temperature there was still in the twenties. 

But when she came back that day, the entire city was blanketed in snow. 

Before boarding the plane, Verena had called Stefan and told him her arrival time. She asked him to bring some thick clothes to meet her at the airport terminal. 

Stefan had promised her, saying, ""I'll be there on time. I won't let my baby catch a cold.""

The echo of his promise still lingered in her ears, yet now, as all the other passengers from the same flight had already dispersed, he remained nowhere to be seen. 

She called him, but he was unreachable. She sent him messages on WhatsApp, but she got no reply. 

As the night wore on, the airport grew emptier. 

Unwilling to give up, Verena took out her phone once more and found Stefan's name on the contact list. 

The same mechanical female voice answered, ""The number you have dialed is unavailable now. Please try later...""

This wasn't the first time such a thing had happened. The reason was always the same. 

Though she was reluctant to believe it, Verena searched her contacts for a name she knew all too well--Noreen Patel. 

Noreen was the unavoidable ""complication"" that would always linger in her relationship with Stefan. 

The call was answered almost immediately. Noreen's deliberately softened voice came through. ""You're looking for Stefan, right? He's indeed here with me. In this snowy weather, our heater suddenly broke, and I was freezing. Stefan was worried about me and insisted on keeping me company.""

Verena took a deep breath and tried to calm herself. ""Let me speak to Stefan,"" she said. 

Soon, Stefan's voice came through. ""I'm at Noreen's. The heater has a broken part, and it's a complicated repair. I'm afraid I can't make it to pick you up. You'll have to get a cab yourself.""

Verena retorted angrily, ""Isn't that what repairmen are for? You can't fix heaters, so why are you there?""

Stefan replied with righteous conviction, ""The repairman is a guy. I don't feel comfortable leaving Noreen with another guy. It's too risky.""

""I'm only wearing a skirt."" Verena's voice was dry, like sandpaper. 

""Just hang in there,"" Stefan said nonchalantly. ""It's only a few hundred meters from the exit to the taxi stand. Once you're in the cab, you'll be warm.""

In the background, Noreen's voice could be faintly heard, ""If it's too much trouble, you'd better go and pick up your girlfriend. I can't keep bothering you for everything.""

Stefan comforted her gently, saying, ""Don't say that to me. If anything happened to you, I would feel guilty forever.""

Verena closed her eyes, and forgotten memories, like a stirred-up hornet's nest, rushed back to sting her heart. 

On her birthday, Stefan had promised to join her for a candlelit dinner. 

But as soon as the first appetizer was served, Noreen called him. She told him that she was trapped in her bathroom because the door lock was broken. 

Stefan grabbed his coat and left immediately, leaving Verena to watch the meticulously cooked dishes grow cold. 

Last winter, Noreen had an early flight, and Stefan was concerned that it would be difficult to catch a cab at that time. So he had gotten out of bed at three in the morning. 

When Verena asked where he was going, he didn't even have time to answer before he was out the door. 

She lay awake until dawn, feeling an emptiness inside. 

That closed door seemed to have shut out the last warmth between her and Stefan. 

This past New Year's Day, Stefan had promised to accompany Verena back to her hometown. 

On their way, he received a call from Noreen. She told him that she'd cut her hand while chopping vegetables. 

Stefan left Verena stranded at a highway stop and sped back. 

Verena stood in the cold wind and watched his car disappear. She felt like a homeless kid. 

Again and again, Noreen always had some trivial reason, and Stefan would unhesitatingly leave Verena for Noreen. 

Verena had fought, yelled, and lamented, but Stefan always said, ""Noreen had a rough past. She suffered from domestic abuse when she was with her ex-husband. As a friend, I have to help her when I can.""

Stefan seemed oblivious to the fact that a broken door lock could be fixed by the property manager, an early flight could be arranged with a ride service, and a cut finger could be bandaged or treated with a call to emergency services. 

But Noreen always turned to Stefan, and he would always abandon Verena for Noreen. 

Verena wasn't naive. She clearly understood that Noreen was using those trivial matters to hint at something. 

Noreen was reminding Verena, ""You'll always be second to me.""

Verena took a deep breath and suppressed the bitterness and anger in her heart. 

She dragged her suitcase and made her way out of the arrival hall. 

The glass doors slid open, and the cold wind, laden with snowflakes, hit her, making her shiver. 

Snowflakes landed on her and melted into cold droplets instantly. 

The wind made her teeth chatter. Each step felt like walking on shards of ice. 

Yet Verena felt her heart was even colder than she could feel physically. 

When she finally got a cab, the driver saw her underdressed and asked in surprise, ""It's cold today. Why didn't you have a family member or friend bring you some clothes?""

Verena simply smiled and turned her face to the window. 

The snow fell more heavily and blurred the city's neon lights and the remnants of hope in her heart. 


Chapter 2
When Verena returned to her rented apartment, it was already eleven at night. 

Verena had used her phone to switch on the warm air from the air conditioner in advance, so she was enveloped by the cozy air when she entered the room. She sighed comfortably. 

She couldn't help but marvel at how reliable modern technology was compared to her boyfriend. 

The air conditioner could precisely let her feel warmth, but Stefan left her waiting in the cold when she needed him most, although she had loved him for five years. 

Verena sat on the sofa and stared at the glass jar on the coffee table blankly for a long time. 

Stefan gave it to her in their second year together. 

Stefan said back then, ""Every time you make me happy, I'll put a red bean in here. When it's filled with red beans, I'll marry you.""

Back then, Verena held the jar and laughed joyfully. 

To fill the jar quickly, she would sneak red beans inside whenever Stefan didn't notice. 

When Stefan found it out, he just smiled and ruffled her hair, never exposing her secret. 

Verena thought it was tacit approval, indulgence, and deep love. 

But now, she realized it was merely self-deception. 

If Stefan truly loved her, why would he repeatedly leave her, forcing her to endure countless lonely moments to cope with her heartache alone? 

Suddenly, Verena stood up and picked up the jar. 

She opened the lid and poured out all the red beans at once. 

The clattering sound echoed clearly in the silent living room. 

The red beans were scattered on the coffee table, like broken hearts. 

One, two, three... Verena counted the beans while reminiscing about her past with Stefan. 

Each bean represented a cherished moment of sweetness or grievances, anticipation or disappointment, surging like tides in her mind. 

She recalled the early days of their relationship, when Stefan remembered her menstrual cycle and prepared some remedy for menstrual discomfort. 

He quietly delivered warm milk and late-night snacks when she worked overtime. 

He clumsily bandaged her wounds when she accidentally got hurt, and his eyes became red with concern. 

But when did everything change? 

Was it when Noreen appeared? 

When he counted the beans for the third time, Verena made a decision. 

She went into the kitchen and boiled some water. 

As the water gradually heated, she placed the red beans, once symbols of love and hope, into the pot one by one. 

Red beans were tough to cook, requiring slow simmering over low heat. 

She sat on a small stool in the kitchen and watched the beans tumble in the water. They transformed from hard to soft, from bright red to dark red, just like her love, which had drained her energy, moving from fervor to decay. 

By the time the beans were fully cooked, dawn had broken. 

Verena ladled some red bean soup into a bowl. The steaming broth slid down her throat and warmed her stomach to the point of discomfort. 

She had it slowly. She seemed to be swallowing the five years of love, grievances, and unwillingness along with the soup. 

After finishing the red bean soup, Verena felt exhausted. She went to the bedroom and went to sl\*\*p. 

Yet she hadn't sl\*\*t long before a sharp stomach pain woke her. 

Her stomach felt intense pain. Then she vomited and had diarrhea, leaving her too weak to stand up. 

She struggled and dragged herself to the hospital. The doctor saw her pale face and frowned, saying, ""This is acute gastroenteritis. Did you eat something unclean?""

Verena replied, ""I made red bean soup with beans that have been stored for years. Is it unclean?""

The doctor said in a bad tone, ""That's not advisable. While beans can be stored, old beans are not recommended for consumption.""

Verena felt terrible, but her mind was unusually clear. 

Through this incident, she understood a truth. 

Spoiled food should not be eaten, and unhealthy relationships should be ended. 

She realized it was time to end her relationship with Stefan. 


Chapter 3
On the following day of Verena's hospitalization, Stefan called her. ""Where did you go? I bought your favorite cake, but I didn't see you when I got to your place.""

Verena replied flatly, ""I'm sick and in the hospital.""

After asking for the address, Stefan hurried over. 

He arrived with a thermal container, and he looked as gentle as ever. ""I especially bought some soup for you. It's good for your stomach.""

Verena looked at the soup Stefan handed over and felt it was laughable. 

It was like giving a small consolation after a big disappointment. It was no different from taming an animal. 

For so many years, she had been fed with such ""sweet treats,"" so she lost herself and forgave his neglect and betrayal again and again. 

Stefan always hurt her and then used a bit of insignificant kindness to make amends. So she always had illusions until she was hurt again. 

She didn't want to continue like that. 

Verena lifted her head and met Stefan's gaze. 

Her voice was soft but unusually firm. ""Stefan, let's break up.""

Stefan's hand froze mid-air. He frowned in disbelief. ""Why? Just because I didn't pick you up at the airport yesterday?""

In fact, Verena had many things she wanted to share with him. She wanted to tell him about how desperate she felt when she was shivering at the airport, how lonely she had been when she was left alone on her birthday, and how helpless she was when she was abandoned at a service area on New Year's Day. 

But she had voiced her grievances countless times, only to be met with endless arguments. 

For the last time, she wanted to keep some dignity and avoid another quarrel. 

So she nodded and said calmly, ""You are right. It's because you didn't pick me up at the airport.""

Stefan's expression darkened. ""Verena, how can you be so inconsiderate? I had important things to do. I didn't deliberately refuse to pick you up. ""Forget it. You're upset right now, and I don't want to argue with you. Come to see me when you've thought things through.""

After a pause, Stefan added, ""I hope it won't take too long.""

With that, he turned and left. 

Verena shouted, ""I'm serious.""

But Stefan didn't look back and walked straight out of the hospital room. 

Shortly after Stefan left, Verena's boss, James Norris, called her. ""Verena, I've heard you're in the hospital. Is it serious? Don't worry about work. Focus on getting better now.""

Verena responded, ""Thank you for your concern, Mr. Norris. The doctor says it's a stomach bug, and I'll just need a few days on a drip.""

Then she tentatively asked, ""Mr. Norris, about the overseas assignment you mentioned before, is it still possible for me to apply?""

James was clearly stunned at the other end of the line. He sounded surprised. ""Why did you change your decision? I remember you said last time that you had someone you cared about here, so you didn't want to leave.""

Verena replied softly, ""I did have someone I couldn't bear to leave, but now the situation has changed.""

James sensed her sadness and also the resolve in her voice. 

He said, ""It's great that you've come to this decision. The position is a level higher than your current one, and the salary is twice what you're earning now. It is an opportunity that many employees would fight to get. I'll start the process for you right away. You prepare yourself and go there in a month.""

Verena said sincerely, ""Thank you, Mr. Norris.""

After hanging up, Verena felt a sense of clarity. 

It was not as difficult as she had imagined to start a new life. 


Chapter 4
Verena stayed in the hospital for three days. After she was discharged, she began sorting through her belongings. 

She packed what she needed into a suitcase to take with her. The rest she planned to give away or simply discard. 

There were still some of Stefan's things at her place. She put all of them into a large cardboard box. 

Her movements were swift and decisive without hesitation. 

Once she finished, she sent Stefan a message on WhatsApp. ""I've packed up your things. Are you coming to pick them up, or should I send them over?""

Stefan quickly replied, ""I'll come over this evening.""

That evening, as Verena was about to have dinner, the electronic lock on the door beeped in alarm. 

Soon after, the doorbell rang urgently. 

Verena opened the door to find Stefan standing outside. He was unsightly. 

""Why couldn't I open the door with the code? Did you change it?"" Stefan asked. 

""We're no longer in a relationship, so it's not right for you to still have access to my place,"" Verena replied. 

She then pointed to the large box by the door and continued, ""You don't need to come in. All your things are here. You can just take them.""

Before Stefan could respond, Noreen peeked her head out from behind him. ""I heard you and Stefan had a quarrel. I guess you must have misunderstood him and me, so I came to clarify. We really have nothing going on. Stefan just feels sorry for me. I'm a divorced woman. How could I possibly be worthy of him?""

Noreen's words were pitiful, and she seemed to have suffered a great injustice. 

Verena looked at her coldly and felt sick. 

Over the years, Noreen had repeatedly used her fragile appearance to gain Stefan's sympathy. She had consistently undermined Verena's relationship with Stefan. 

Verena said icily, ""Noreen, stop acting like the innocent woman in front of me. I'm not falling for it. This is my place, and you're not welcome here.""

""What kind of attitude is that, Verena?"" Stefan frowned. ""Noreen came out of kindness to clear up the misunderstanding. Do you have to be so harsh? You know that she married a loser and that she's already suffering. Why do you have to bring up her painful past and rub salt in her wounds?""

Verena sneered, ""Stefan, I knew you were blind. Are you deaf now? When did I mention her marriage? She brought it up herself, didn't she? It happens every time. As long as there's a conflict between Noreen and me, I always make mistakes. I don't want to see either of you anymore. Take your things and leave.""

Stefan's face darkened. ""Verena, I'm very disappointed in you. I'm going to punish you this time. Give me back the jar of red beans. Until I've calmed down, I won't be adding any more beans to it. I won't let you sneak any in either.""

Stefan seemed to think that the jar was his last bargaining chip with Verena. 

He believed she would comply with whatever demands he made to keep it. 

But he was wrong this time. 

Verena pointed at the carton box on the floor and said, ""It's already packed. As I said, everything of yours is in the box.""

Stefan found the jar, only to discover it was empty. 

He looked up sharply at Verena, disbelief in his eyes. ""Where are the red beans that were in here?""

Verena said emotionlessly, ""They've been turned into some red bean soup, which I ate."" She seemed to discuss something trivial. 

Stefan was stunned. ""How could you? Do you know what those red beans mean?""

Verena said word by word, ""I don't want to marry you anymore, so they hold no meaning.""

Stefan's ch\*\*t heaved with anger. He was clearly provoked by Verena's words. 

He glared at Verena and said through clenched teeth, ""You'll regret this. Verena, you have to know that no one will ever treat you as well as I do.""

""Really?"" Verena raised her eyebrows, and her gaze was full of relief. ""Then let me see if I can live better without you.""

Stefan was left speechless. He glared at her before picking up the box and leaving. 

Noreen followed him out. As she passed Verena, her previously innocent and fragile facade dropped. Instead, she gave a smug and malicious smile. 

She was like a peacock strutting after a win and reveling in her triumph. 

Verena couldn't be bothered to look at Noreen's petty satisfaction and slammed the door shut. 


Chapter 5
Verena's colleagues knew she was being transferred, so they threw a farewell party to bid her farewell. 

At the restaurant where the party was held, Verena unexpectedly ran into Stefan and Noreen. 

Stefan was momentarily stunned to see Verena, but he quickly walked over to her and said, ""Verena, don't get the wrong idea. We're not on a date. We're just here for a class reunion.""

Verena replied with a faint smile, ""So, you and she are classmates. That's news to me.""

Stefan looked embarrassed. 

He and Noreen had never attended the same school, not even as alumni. 

Noreen looked as innocent as ever. She said, ""It's Stefan's class reunion, and they asked everyone to bring spouses. Since you and Stefan have been having a tiff, I came along to make up the numbers so he wouldn't be laughed at.""

""That's great,"" Verena said. She ignored Stefan and Noreen and was about to head to the room she was supposed to be in. 

However, Stefan wouldn't let it go. He held onto her arm and said, ""Verena, you really misunderstood. There's nothing between Noreen and me. It's been half a month since our last argument. You should be over it by now. Let's make up,"" 

Stefan pleaded, his eyes filled with anxiety. 

But he didn't notice the spiteful glare Noreen shot at Verena as he tried to clear up any misunderstanding about him and Noreen. 

Noreen was like a poised snake, ready to strike at any moment. 

Just as Verena was about to break free, a piercing scream echoed down the hallway. ""Fire!""

Thick sm\*\*e followed shortly after, filling the air. 

Panic ensued as restaurant guests screamed, cried, and rushed toward the exit in a frenzy. 

Tables and chairs were knocked over. The sound of shattering glassware was constant. 

In the chaos, Stefan instinctively tightened his grip on Verena's hand. He said anxiously, ""Don't panic. Follow me.""

Meanwhile, Noreen suddenly screamed and collapsed to the floor. 

She cried hysterically, and her voice was louder than the chaos of the fire. ""Stefan, I can't move. My leg is cramping. I'm so scared...""

Stefan immediately stopped in his tracks. 

He rushed to Noreen instantly, crouched down, and lifted her in his arms. 

Noreen wrapped her arms around his neck and buried her face in his shoulder. 

Then, she suddenly raised her head and flashed a triumphant and malicious smile at Verena. 

Stefan carried Noreen toward the exit without a glance back at Verena. 

He was oblivious to the fact that as they passed by her, Noreen took advantage of the chaos to shove Verena hard. 

Verena stumbled to the floor. Right where flames had just ignited, the fire quickly caught her skirt. 

Instinctively, she tried to pat out the flames on her leg, and her fingers burned with pain. 

Fortunately, the firemen arrived in time to extinguish the flames on her. 

Verena was helped to the open space outside the restaurant. Her hands and legs were swollen and blistered. 

Medical personnel crouched in front of her and treated her wounds. The antiseptic's sharp sting caused her to g\*\*p. 

Her phone rang repeatedly, but she was in no condition to answer. 

""Verena, there you are.""

She looked up to see Stefan. 

""I've been searching for you everywhere. Why didn't you answer my calls? I was so worried about you. How did you get injured? You were too careless.""

Verena replied softly, ""I was injured because Noreen pushed me into the fire. Would you believe my words?""

Stefan immediately furrowed his eyebrows. ""Verena, I know you're upset because you're hurt, but you can't take it out on Noreen. She wouldn't harm a fly. How could she intentionally hurt you? You can't accuse her just because you have a bias against her.""

Verena laughed, though tears began to fall. 

She said, ""Stefan, haven't you always wanted to know why I wanted to break up with you? Look, that's the reason. In your eyes, no matter what happens, you will always protect Noreen, who always seems the weak one. And you always blame me for making a fuss over nothing and ignore me. We're destined not to work out.""

Stefan's eyes were filled with panic and reluctance. ""It's not like that. I only sympathize with Noreen. I've never considered marrying her. I love you. After all these years, can you really break up with me? Tell me what I did wrong, and I'll change.""

Verena shook her head. ""I love the one who loves me, cares for me, and accepts me. But I don't love the guy who leaves me behind and unconditionally believes another woman. Stefan, we can't go back.""

""But I promised you a future."" Stefan's voice was choked with emotion. His eyes were locked on Verena as he tried to evoke memories. ""We promised to get married, have two adorable children, keep many pets, and travel the world together. We planned so much for the future. Have you really forgotten?""

""Your future plans never really included me,"" Verena said, closing her eyes tightly. 

When she opened them again, there was no longing. 

""In your future, there's always a place for Noreen. She needs your protection and care. And I... I'm just someone not as important. I don't care for such a future.""

My wife and I went over to say our goodbyes after they gave us the bad news, and they placed us in a small room with her cooling body. There was a plaque on the wall that said “I am Always with you”.

That phrase struck me that day, and it has remained with me. In the days following her passing, I spent hours looking through the photographs on my phone. Lilly was a special needs cat from birth, so her health was up and down throughout her almost nine years of life. I took lots of pictures of her because we didn’t know how long we would have her with us. After going through all the pictures of her on my phone, I started going through all the photos of her on my family’s shared photo album on our cloud account. There were hundreds of photos and videos that included Lilly. And as I went through them, I realized something.

She was Always with me.

These were mostly photos of me, taken by my wife or family, but Lilly would be in the picture. She was under the coffee table by my feet as I watched TV. She was on the back of the couch behind my shoulders as I smiled for the camera. She was wrapped up in a blanket at the door of the bed while I sat there reading. My wife took dozens of photos of me sleeping because Lilly was in my arms, or by my hip, or on my pillow.

I'm not really looking for a diagnosis just opinions from those who know what they have and can maybe relate to this and want to share their opinions.

I've been in a state of dark struggle for a very long time. I was very social as a kid, I was raised homeschooled and out of all of my siblings I was the one who approached people, talked to adults confidently. I begged my Mom to put me in public high school when the time came, I had this image in my head based on all the movies I'd seen where I'd get a skateboard and friends and I could be moody and cool. It was a disaster from day one and it was 3 years of hellish social anxiety and horrible grades until I dropped out and switched to online. In my sophomore year I stayed wide eyed and sick with anxiety but I let myself grow some sort of personality based on class clowns I'd also seen in movies. I wasnt very funny but there were 2 or 3 people who found me funny and they were my friends. I can remember being somewhat more confident then I am now when I was a kid and for a brief period when I was a teen where I felt like I had very little to lose and I started approaching people. I've been graduated for almost 5 years now, living at home. I know what I want to do in life but I can't find a school for it I can afford. I exit my house to go to work and occasionally coffee shops. When a stranger talks to me it instantly zaps all thoughts from my head and I go on polite autopilot, I mishear them, I say sorry or thank you too many times. I worry all the time about people thinking I'm a pervert or weird that I have a crush on them and then my body starts acting based on those scary thoughts, walking too fast, I dont even know. I went on some Omegle ripoff today out of boredom and decided to do video chat which I never do. I'm a conventionally attractive person so my looks arent really what I worry about but as soon as it's time to talk to someone I immediately just think of rejection and then I want to escape. So these feelings are based in insecurity for sure, but its constant debilitating insecurity that feels like theres no affirmation for. Based on what I just wrote, could I have a larger problem such as autism which would have been with me my whole life and is now becoming noticeable, or could it just be because I am an isolated person who struggles with putting themselves out there. I don't know why I want to know this information, I don't know what it would do for me. I know it might be hard but please don't tell me to just go get a therapist, I've attempted to do that for a year with zero success, its unnecessarily difficult where I am for multiple reasons and its just not something I want to tire myself with right now. Not looking for a diagnosis or healing just general opinions. Thank you!",2,1767858487.0,aspergers,1,1.0,False

Nora’s POV

“Here’s something interesting,” I mutter, spinning my silver blade between my fingers while staring into the shadowy forest ahead. “This is beginning to feel like a personal vendetta.” I pause, shutting my eyes to better sense the dark energy swirling around me. Something wicked and otherworldly is prowling nearby, but it hasn’t revealed itself yet.

“It’s not as if I reek of anything offensive.” I lift a strand of my chocolate brown waves to my nose. “I bathed thoroughly and everything. Even wore matching socks today.” The thick clouds drift away from the moon’s face, flooding the landscape with ghostly silver radiance. I tilt my head skyward, drawing strength from the full moon’s energy. “Come now, let’s have a civilized conversation.” I rise from my spot, needing to work the stiffness from my legs. I’ve been perched on these frigid stone steps of this centuries-old farmhouse for over an hour, waiting to make my kill. Dark shapes dance across the porch and my pulse quickens. Multiple demons are lurking out here and I’m completely alone.

Perfect.

A wicked grin tugs at my mouth. Eyes closed, I breathe deeply and absorb power from every direction.

I’ve been hunting this particular demon for weeks, following a string of disappearances involving hikers in this national park. Without any evidence of violence, law enforcement concluded that the missing hikers simply wandered deeper into the park toward the lake, where they presumably drowned and were carried away by dangerous currents. The lake has been thoroughly searched, naturally, but dragging all of Lake Michigan for remains is impossible.

But I understand the truth. No evidence of violence exists because every fragment of those bodies was devoured completely. More innocent hikers will vanish unless I eliminate these demons. They reach maximum strength beneath the full moon’s glow, transforming from incorporeal spirits into beings with solid forms. This might spell trouble for me, except tonight is also the only time they can be permanently destroyed.

Forever.

Assuming I can reach the incantation I’ve scribbled on paper and tucked in my pocket in time, because precise words must be spoken to banish these creatures into the earth for their final rest. I raise the dagger in one hand while fumbling for the spell with the other.

The temperature around me drops, and I sense at least one approaching. Damn. So much for retrieving the spell. Yes, I realize I should have committed it to memory, but Latin has always challenged me, and I was counting on being able to consult the paper rather than rely on recall. I can almost picture Charlette’s disapproving glare as she crosses her arms in that familiar I-warned-you expression.

I hurry down the remaining stone steps and circle to the house’s side, keeping my gaze fixed on the darkest section of woods near me. One demon charges forward with a thunderous roar, fangs exposed and clawed hands reaching. The other remains concealed, and without sensing the darkness enveloping it, I wouldn’t detect its presence.

“Foolish demon. You should realize better than to trust a witch when she claims she only wants conversation.”

It springs toward me and I dodge sideways, knowing I cannot stop to access the spell now. I cannot destroy it yet. I lift the dagger, its blade catching moonlight.

“Strike him swift and strike him true. Pierce the heart and make him rue,” I whisper, feeling magic surge through my palm into the weapon. Without hesitation, I leap up and pivot, hurling the dagger into the darkness. It strikes one demon, burying deep in its chest while crackling with crimson magic.

The second demon, humanoid in shape but covered in rough gray hide, hisses and springs away, whirling toward me with talons spread in my direction. I extract the spell from my pocket and unfold the paper. Just as I glance down at my messy handwriting sprawled across the page, something seizes my hair and jerks me backward.

The paper slips from my grasp, floating to the ground. I snap my head back, skull connecting with whoever lurks behind me. A demon snarls and lashes out from the impact, shifting its grip from my hair to my waist.

It drags me closer and something warm and slick drips down my neck.

“Revolting,” I say, driving my elbow back sharply. I strike it hard in the ribs, twisting and breaking free from its grasp. No time to cringe at the demon blood trickling down my skin. The demon without a blade in its chest charges forward. I leap aside, diving to the ground and rolling back onto my feet in a practiced maneuver. Wind gusts up, carrying the spell-inscribed paper away from the house into the woods.

“Damn it all,” I curse and thrust out my hand, launching a sphere of magical energy at the demon. It stumbles backward, knocked flat by my power’s force. I use this brief distraction to my advantage and turn toward the paper. The other demon yanks the dagger from its chest and flings it at me.

I dive forward, barely avoiding a blade to the chest. It grazes my shoulder instead, slicing through flesh. I crash to the ground, groaning in pain. Muddy grass squelches beneath me, staining my already-destroyed shirt. I push off the earth, snatching the paper and springing upright.

“Mater et luna voco,” I begin reading, and the demons shriek. They know what’s coming and I relish this moment every single time. “Redde unde exierunt,” I continue, voice rising. “Cinis cinerem. Pulvis sunt pariter!”

I rip a crystal from my neck and hurl it at the demons’ feet as I finish the incantation. It ignites, sending magical waves through the air and reducing the demons to nothing but ash piles.

“Good morning,” Ophelia calls cheerfully, entering the bookstore with two coffee cups. It’s our unspoken agreement that whoever doesn’t open our shared store stops by Linus Café for morning coffee. She places my black coffee on the counter and waves at the blinds, making them rise magically.

“What happened to your shoulder?” She rounds the counter and stores her purse in the cabinet beneath the register.

I’m wearing a black off-shoulder sweater and leggings, and hadn’t realized the cut was visible.

“Stubborn warbler demon hurled my own dagger back at me. After I’d impaled him with it.”

“Disgusting.” Ophelia wrinkles her nose. “I hope you cleaned it properly.”

“I did, and used the last of my healing balm this morning.”

“I’ll prepare more for you.” She walks across the store, trailing her fingers over book spines and activates the open sign.

“Thanks.”

“How did the hunt go? Did you eliminate them?”

“Don’t I always?” I grab my coffee and remove the lid, letting it cool.

“Don’t get overconfident now,” Ophelia teases, though it’s amusing because I’m not. I’ve spent years training, and most importantly, I understand my limitations.

“I’ll do my best not to,” I respond. “Really, these lower-tier demons don’t offer much resistance. I didn’t even need to call my familiars for assistance.”

“That’s fortunate.” Ophelia shudders and unlocks the door, opening the store to customers. Two people enter before she returns to the counter. Ophelia and I met years ago, and while we both possess magical abilities, we’re quite different.

Which makes us excellent friends.

Ophelia is a peacekeeper. She enjoys creating love potions, healing balms, and fortune charms. She spends free time gardening and watches only HGTV. But cross her or hurt someone she cares about, and the lapdog becomes a hellhound.

“I’m going shopping later today,” she says, returning behind the counter and retrieving a notebook from the register drawer to begin a list. “Shopping” means she’s traveling to another coven for magical supplies. “Do you need anything?”

“Black salt and mandrake root,” I tell her quietly, watching the couple who went straight to romance novels. We’re the only independent bookstore locally, and after the last big chain closed, business really improved.

“What about vervain and garlic?”

“Yes. Better prepared than sorry, right?”

“Exactly my thinking. Though the local vampires have been fairly courteous so far.”

“It’s always the quiet ones who become ruthless killers.”

“Rather like you,” she teases, though it’s accurate. Killing demons is more unpaid public service than murder, but it’s still killing.

Generally, vampires have integrated into society better than anyone anticipated once they revealed themselves to the world several years ago. But witches aren’t ordinary citizens.

We have a complicated history and exposing vampires puts all magical folk at risk of discovery. Which we absolutely don’t want. Witches faced persecution once, and we refuse to be in the spotlight again.

With bottled animal blood available, vampires claim no need to feed on humans anymore. And if they crave fresh living blood, they can pay premium prices for “privately and ethically sourced” human blood. The whole situation remains hotly debated, with some arguing it should be illegal to sell human blood when the Red Cross faces constant shortages. Others believe we should control our own blood, and if selling it to be filtered into fancy black bottles is someone’s choice, we should allow it.

“That’s everything you need?” she asks, adding more items to her list.

“Yes, I inventoried everything a few days ago and I’m stocked. Though if you can visit Collins Mortuary, I could use more Dead Man’s Blood. Preferably something fresh and not from anyone with heart disease.”

“I can stop by and check their selection. Want me to deliver everything tonight?”

“No, bring it next time you see me.”

Ophelia lives downtown, walking distance from the store, while I live on Vivian Hill’s outskirts in an old house I renovated myself.

The morning continues normally. I recommend my favorite indie author to college girls, connect an older couple with a romance series to rekindle their love life, and find the perfect self-help book for a shy teenager who’s probably skipping school right now, but who am I to judge?

Ophelia leaves during the lunch lull, and I slip into the back room quickly to use the restroom and grab my meal. I turn on music, dancing in place as I open a container of last night’s leftovers. I hold my hand over the spaghetti, using magic to heat it. I sit behind the register, thinking I’ll get a moment’s peace before another customer arrives. But then the bell chimes as the door opens.

I blink several times and look up, focusing on the dark-haired woman who just entered my store.

She glances around nervously, wringing her hands, uncertain. It’s her first visit because, trust me, I’d remember if this woman had ever stepped foot here before.

Because she’s my sister.

“Lena?” Her name escapes my lips and I feel as surprised as she appears. It’s been over a year since we’ve seen each other, and when she turns to meet my eyes directly, something tugs at my heart.

I miss her.

“Hello, Eleonora,” she breathes, eyes wide.

“Nora,” I correct, then feel guilty. Maybe she forgot I don’t use my full name anymore. “What brings you here? I mean, it’s wonderful to see you. Wait, is everything alright?” I spring from the chair behind the counter and smooth my hair back again. I slept on it damp and it dried completely wavy. Trying to tame it is pointless.

“I wanted to see you.” She moves into the store enough to clear the entrance but doesn’t venture further. Gripping her Gucci purse strap, she surveys the space before returning her attention to me. “Elodie turns one soon. We’re throwing a party.”

“One year already,” I repeat, feeling my heart clench. “That passed quickly.”

“Tell me about it,” my sister says, still not advancing into the store. She steals another glance around, unsure if the books will remain stationary.

“It’s an ordinary bookstore,” I assure her. “You’re perfectly safe.”

“I know, I’m not afraid, it’s just…” She shakes her head, stumbling over words. Clearing her throat, she reaches into her purse and produces a cream envelope. “I’d love to have you at Elodie’s party.”

I circle from behind the counter and accept the invitation from her. I swallow hard, refusing to let emotion overwhelm me.

“It’s at our house,” she continues. “We’re renovating our kitchen, so all food is being catered from Luciano’s. You still enjoy that place, right?”

“Yes,” I say, though I haven’t visited in years.

“Perfect, because there’ll be tons of food. And their famous red wine.” She meets my gaze with a small smile.

“I do enjoy wine,” I say, neither agreeing nor declining to attend my only niece’s birthday celebration. “I thought your house was new. You’re renovating already?”

“Oh, right. You wouldn’t know. We bought a place in Mark Park.”

“Really?” I say, unable to hide my surprise. “I thought that penthouse was your dream home and so convenient to your hospital.”

Lena looks down and her cheeks flush red.

“We just thought a change would be good. For Elodie. The new place is near the lake and a park.”

She’s withholding something, but I won’t press. As long as she has shelter and safety, I don’t care where she lives.

I look down at the invitation, uncertain what to say. She’s my older sister. I’ve known her my entire life. But this feels awkward and suddenly I forget how normal people behave. I look back up, finding her examining the store.

The bell chimes behind her and she steps forward, ensuring she’s not blocking anyone.

“This place is lovely,” she says with a smile. “You always were an avid reader.”

“Yes. Books were my sanctuary.”

“I’d really appreciate it if you came to the party.” Her gaze finds the cut on my shoulder. She inhales as she studies me. “You look wonderful, Nora.”

I wave dismissively. “You don’t need to lie, Lena. I had a late, difficult night.”

“With a man?” She offers a tentative smile.

“A few men, actually.” I raise my eyebrows playfully.

“Sounds entertaining.”

Is that a genuine smile I see on my sister’s face?

“It’s not what you’re thinking. I’m just ridding the world of evil.”

“Nora, I’m sorry for everything that happened before,” Lena begins and reaches for my hand. Her fingers brush over my skin and my heart expands in my chest. I close my eyes and push all feelings aside.

“I know you are, and I don’t hold it against you.” I squeeze her hand. “It’s good to see you again.”

“You too. Maybe we can make this a somewhat regular occurrence.”

“Maybe,” I say with a smile, but I’m completely lying. There’s a reason I left home and never returned.",1,1767858152.0,romancenovels,1,1.0,False

Others believe we should control our own blood, and if selling it to be filtered into fancy black bottles is someone’s choice, we should allow it.



“That’s everything you need?” she asks, adding more items to her list.



“Yes, I inventoried everything a few days ago and I’m stocked. Though if you can visit Collins Mortuary, I could use more Dead Man’s Blood. Preferably something fresh and not from anyone with heart disease.”



“I can stop by and check their selection. Want me to deliver everything tonight?”



“No, bring it next time you see me.”



Ophelia lives downtown, walking distance from the store, while I live on Vivian Hill’s outskirts in an old house I renovated myself.



The morning continues normally. I recommend my favorite indie author to college girls, connect an older couple with a romance series to rekindle their love life, and find the perfect self-help book for a shy teenager who’s probably skipping school right now, but who am I to judge?



Ophelia leaves during the lunch lull, and I slip into the back room quickly to use the restroom and grab my meal. I turn on music, dancing in place as I open a container of last night’s leftovers. I hold my hand over the spaghetti, using magic to heat it. I sit behind the register, thinking I’ll get a moment’s peace before another customer arrives. But then the bell chimes as the door opens.



I blink several times and look up, focusing on the dark-haired woman who just entered my store.



She glances around nervously, wringing her hands, uncertain. It’s her first visit because, trust me, I’d remember if this woman had ever stepped foot here before.



Because she’s my sister.



“Lena?” Her name escapes my lips and I feel as surprised as she appears. It’s been over a year since we’ve seen each other, and when she turns to meet my eyes directly, something tugs at my heart.



I miss her.



“Hello, Eleonora,” she breathes, eyes wide.



“Nora,” I correct, then feel guilty. Maybe she forgot I don’t use my full name anymore. “What brings you here? I mean, it’s wonderful to see you. Wait, is everything alright?” I spring from the chair behind the counter and smooth my hair back again. I slept on it damp and it dried completely wavy. Trying to tame it is pointless.



“I wanted to see you.” She moves into the store enough to clear the entrance but doesn’t venture further. Gripping her Gucci purse strap, she surveys the space before returning her attention to me. “Elodie turns one soon. We’re throwing a party.”



“One year already,” I repeat, feeling my heart clench. “That passed quickly.”



“Tell me about it,” my sister says, still not advancing into the store. She steals another glance around, unsure if the books will remain stationary.



“It’s an ordinary bookstore,” I assure her. “You’re perfectly safe.”



“I know, I’m not afraid, it’s just…” She shakes her head, stumbling over words. Clearing her throat, she reaches into her purse and produces a cream envelope. “I’d love to have you at Elodie’s party.”



I circle from behind the counter and accept the invitation from her. I swallow hard, refusing to let emotion overwhelm me.



“It’s at our house,” she continues. “We’re renovating our kitchen, so all food is being catered from Luciano’s. You still enjoy that place, right?”



“Yes,” I say, though I haven’t visited in years.



“Perfect, because there’ll be tons of food. And their famous red wine.” She meets my gaze with a small smile.



“I do enjoy wine,” I say, neither agreeing nor declining to attend my only niece’s birthday celebration. “I thought your house was new. You’re renovating already?”



“Oh, right. You wouldn’t know. We bought a place in Mark Park.”



“Really?” I say, unable to hide my surprise. “I thought that penthouse was your dream home and so convenient to your hospital.”



Lena looks down and her cheeks flush red.



“We just thought a change would be good. For Elodie. The new place is near the lake and a park.”



She’s withholding something, but I won’t press. As long as she has shelter and safety, I don’t care where she lives.



I look down at the invitation, uncertain what to say. She’s my older sister. I’ve known her my entire life. But this feels awkward and suddenly I forget how normal people behave. I look back up, finding her examining the store.



The bell chimes behind her and she steps forward, ensuring she’s not blocking anyone.



“This place is lovely,” she says with a smile. “You always were an avid reader.”



“Yes. Books were my sanctuary.”



“I’d really appreciate it if you came to the party.” Her gaze finds the cut on my shoulder. She inhales as she studies me. “You look wonderful, Nora.”



I wave dismissively. “You don’t need to lie, Lena. I had a late, difficult night.”



“With a man?” She offers a tentative smile.



“A few men, actually.” I raise my eyebrows playfully.



“Sounds entertaining.”



Is that a genuine smile I see on my sister’s face?



“It’s not what you’re thinking. I’m just ridding the world of evil.”



“Nora, I’m sorry for everything that happened before,” Lena begins and reaches for my hand. Her fingers brush over my skin and my heart expands in my chest. I close my eyes and push all feelings aside.



“I know you are, and I don’t hold it against you.” I squeeze her hand. “It’s good to see you again.”



“You too. Maybe we can make this a somewhat regular occurrence.”



“Maybe,” I say with a smile, but I’m completely lying. There’s a reason I left home and never returned.",1,1767858110.0,Hot_Romance_Stories,1,1.0,False

Nora’s POV



“Here’s something interesting,” I mutter, spinning my silver blade between my fingers while staring into the shadowy forest ahead. “This is beginning to feel like a personal vendetta.” I pause, shutting my eyes to better sense the dark energy swirling around me. Something wicked and otherworldly is prowling nearby, but it hasn’t revealed itself yet.



“It’s not as if I reek of anything offensive.” I lift a strand of my chocolate brown waves to my nose. “I bathed thoroughly and everything. Even wore matching socks today.” The thick clouds drift away from the moon’s face, flooding the landscape with ghostly silver radiance. I tilt my head skyward, drawing strength from the full moon’s energy. “Come now, let’s have a civilized conversation.” I rise from my spot, needing to work the stiffness from my legs. I’ve been perched on these frigid stone steps of this centuries-old farmhouse for over an hour, waiting to make my kill. Dark shapes dance across the porch and my pulse quickens. Multiple demons are lurking out here and I’m completely alone.



Perfect.



A wicked grin tugs at my mouth. Eyes closed, I breathe deeply and absorb power from every direction.



I’ve been hunting this particular demon for weeks, following a string of disappearances involving hikers in this national park. Without any evidence of violence, law enforcement concluded that the missing hikers simply wandered deeper into the park toward the lake, where they presumably drowned and were carried away by dangerous currents. The lake has been thoroughly searched, naturally, but dragging all of Lake Michigan for remains is impossible.



But I understand the truth. No evidence of violence exists because every fragment of those bodies was devoured completely. More innocent hikers will vanish unless I eliminate these demons. They reach maximum strength beneath the full moon’s glow, transforming from incorporeal spirits into beings with solid forms. This might spell trouble for me, except tonight is also the only time they can be permanently destroyed.



Forever.



Assuming I can reach the incantation I’ve scribbled on paper and tucked in my pocket in time, because precise words must be spoken to banish these creatures into the earth for their final rest. I raise the dagger in one hand while fumbling for the spell with the other.



The temperature around me drops, and I sense at least one approaching. Damn. So much for retrieving the spell. Yes, I realize I should have committed it to memory, but Latin has always challenged me, and I was counting on being able to consult the paper rather than rely on recall. I can almost picture Charlette’s disapproving glare as she crosses her arms in that familiar I-warned-you expression.



I hurry down the remaining stone steps and circle to the house’s side, keeping my gaze fixed on the darkest section of woods near me. One demon charges forward with a thunderous roar, fangs exposed and clawed hands reaching. The other remains concealed, and without sensing the darkness enveloping it, I wouldn’t detect its presence.



“Foolish demon. You should realize better than to trust a witch when she claims she only wants conversation.”



It springs toward me and I dodge sideways, knowing I cannot stop to access the spell now. I cannot destroy it yet. I lift the dagger, its blade catching moonlight.



“Strike him swift and strike him true. Pierce the heart and make him rue,” I whisper, feeling magic surge through my palm into the weapon. Without hesitation, I leap up and pivot, hurling the dagger into the darkness. It strikes one demon, burying deep in its chest while crackling with crimson magic.



The second demon, humanoid in shape but covered in rough gray hide, hisses and springs away, whirling toward me with talons spread in my direction. I extract the spell from my pocket and unfold the paper. Just as I glance down at my messy handwriting sprawled across the page, something seizes my hair and jerks me backward.



The paper slips from my grasp, floating to the ground. I snap my head back, skull connecting with whoever lurks behind me. A demon snarls and lashes out from the impact, shifting its grip from my hair to my waist.



It drags me closer and something warm and slick drips down my neck.



“Revolting,” I say, driving my elbow back sharply. I strike it hard in the ribs, twisting and breaking free from its grasp. No time to cringe at the demon blood trickling down my skin. The demon without a blade in its chest charges forward. I leap aside, diving to the ground and rolling back onto my feet in a practiced maneuver. Wind gusts up, carrying the spell-inscribed paper away from the house into the woods.



“Damn it all,” I curse and thrust out my hand, launching a sphere of magical energy at the demon. It stumbles backward, knocked flat by my power’s force. I use this brief distraction to my advantage and turn toward the paper. The other demon yanks the dagger from its chest and flings it at me.



I dive forward, barely avoiding a blade to the chest. It grazes my shoulder instead, slicing through flesh. I crash to the ground, groaning in pain. Muddy grass squelches beneath me, staining my already-destroyed shirt. I push off the earth, snatching the paper and springing upright.



“Mater et luna voco,” I begin reading, and the demons shriek. They know what’s coming and I relish this moment every single time. “Redde unde exierunt,” I continue, voice rising. “Cinis cinerem. Pulvis sunt pariter!”



I rip a crystal from my neck and hurl it at the demons’ feet as I finish the incantation. It ignites, sending magical waves through the air and reducing the demons to nothing but ash piles.



“Good morning,” Ophelia calls cheerfully, entering the bookstore with two coffee cups. It’s our unspoken agreement that whoever doesn’t open our shared store stops by Linus Café for morning coffee. She places my black coffee on the counter and waves at the blinds, making them rise magically.



“What happened to your shoulder?” She rounds the counter and stores her purse in the cabinet beneath the register.



I’m wearing a black off-shoulder sweater and leggings, and hadn’t realized the cut was visible.



“Stubborn warbler demon hurled my own dagger back at me. After I’d impaled him with it.”



“Disgusting.” Ophelia wrinkles her nose. “I hope you cleaned it properly.”



“I did, and used the last of my healing balm this morning.”



“I’ll prepare more for you.” She walks across the store, trailing her fingers over book spines and activates the open sign.



“Thanks.”



“How did the hunt go? Did you eliminate them?”



“Don’t I always?” I grab my coffee and remove the lid, letting it cool.



“Don’t get overconfident now,” Ophelia teases, though it’s amusing because I’m not. I’ve spent years training, and most importantly, I understand my limitations.



“I’ll do my best not to,” I respond. “Really, these lower-tier demons don’t offer much resistance. I didn’t even need to call my familiars for assistance.”



“That’s fortunate.” Ophelia shudders and unlocks the door, opening the store to customers. Two people enter before she returns to the counter. Ophelia and I met years ago, and while we both possess magical abilities, we’re quite different.



Which makes us excellent friends.



Ophelia is a peacekeeper. She enjoys creating love potions, healing balms, and fortune charms. She spends free time gardening and watches only HGTV. But cross her or hurt someone she cares about, and the lapdog becomes a hellhound.



“I’m going shopping later today,” she says, returning behind the counter and retrieving a notebook from the register drawer to begin a list. “Shopping” means she’s traveling to another coven for magical supplies. “Do you need anything?”



“Black salt and mandrake root,” I tell her quietly, watching the couple who went straight to romance novels. We’re the only independent bookstore locally, and after the last big chain closed, business really improved.



“What about vervain and garlic?”



“Yes. Better prepared than sorry, right?”



“Exactly my thinking. Though the local vampires have been fairly courteous so far.”



“It’s always the quiet ones who become ruthless killers.”



“Rather like you,” she teases, though it’s accurate. Killing demons is more unpaid public service than murder, but it’s still killing.



Generally, vampires have integrated into society better than anyone anticipated once they revealed themselves to the world several years ago. But witches aren’t ordinary citizens.

1q75kk7,https://www.reddit.com/r/shoppingaddiction/comments/1q75kk7/making_progress_after_loosing_almost_40k_life/,Making progress after loosing almost 40k life savings!,"Okay story time.

I’ve always been extremely frugal. Like… since I was a kid. My parents were big on teaching me how to save and spend money early on. I had an allowance for chores, then pocket money, and if I wanted a “raise” I literally had to write a letter explaining why I deserved it and what I planned to do with the money. So yeah, I grew up very aware of money.

I worked summers starting at 16, saved a lot, and even in college I was terrified of going even $5 over budget. There were times I’d eat beforehand and just sit at restaurants with friends so I wouldn’t have to buy food. That was probably too extreme, but honestly being scared of spending felt better than spending without limits.

Then I met someone who was the complete opposite.

In my last year of college, I became close with a girl who gave me some great memories, but also totally wrecked my spending habits. Everything deserved a “little treat.” Homework? Treat. Bad day? Treat. Fight with roommates? Treat. Turned in an essay? Somehow that meant buying 10 copies of the same album. It slowly rewired my brain. Donut for studying. Takeout after class. Overpriced latte to focus. Clothes because they were cute.

I didn’t even notice how bad it got until money stopped feeling real. I had no idea where it was going, which just gave me more anxiety… and then I’d spend more to cope.

Then real life hit…

I moved to Hawaii for grad school (insanely expensive), then later to South Korea where I’ve been living and working for the past 3 years. My spending habits did not prepare me for:
1.	being told I wouldn’t receive funding for my second year of college 
2.	having to take out massive loans
3.	my school realizing too late I could graduate on time → forcing me into a summer graduation that cost ~$11k out of pocket
4.	getting laid off from my first job with zero income for 5 months in a foreign country

I started 2021 with almost $40k saved, which was money I’d built up since childhood, and ended up with about $100 after I lost the job in which I was living paycheck to paycheck. My parents helped me out (thankfully), but it was humiliating. Worse, I kept spending unnecessarily even with the money they gave me.

Something finally snapped this year. I got into my first truly stable relationship and started thinking about an actual future—marriage, family, a home—things that had felt impossible before. I looked at my bank account and felt genuinely embarrassed. I knew I had to change.

Over the past few months I’ve made a real budget, audited my finances (which was brutal but necessary), and decluttered my home and realized how much stuff I never use.

Seeing the numbers brought me back to reality. Cutting small things made a huge difference: meal prepping, making my own matcha and coffee, baking, working at home instead of cafés. One of the biggest helps was also building a capsule wardrobe. Fewer clothes, better quality. I’d rather buy one $300 coat I’ll wear for 10+ years (was also on sale) than tons of cheap stuff I never touch. It’s saved me money and made getting dressed easier.

It took a few years, but I’m finally digging myself out. I don’t blame that person entirely as I was responsible too, but it really showed me how much the people around you influence your habits. I’m proud of where I’m at now, and if things go well this year, I’m hoping to save around $8k–$10k!! 

I’m curious if other people have had similar experiences or success stories! For reference I’m 26 so I’m glad I caught this now to be honest, but it’s still tough living with the guilt. It almost feels like grief, especially that 11k… ",7,1767857535.0,shoppingaddiction,1,0.89,False

hey everyone, figured i'd share a quick parking rundown for the nils show on 01/11. parking on shelter island is always a whole thing, especially for a 6:00 pm start when the dinner rush is hitting. but you have a few solid choices to make it easy.  
  
my top recommendation, honestly, is to check out prked. i'm not affiliated or anything, but they're an app where locals rent out their driveways or unused garage spots. for humphreys, you can often find a spot on a side street or maybe behind one of the condos nearby, and it's way cheaper than the hotel lot. plus, you skip the whole shelter island drive traffic line by parking off the main drag and just walking a couple blocks.  
  
if you want the absolute easiest parking, you can use the humphreys half moon inn lot itself. it's right between the hotel and the restaurant, super convenient, but they charge $25 for event parking. that's the price for being right next to the door.  
  
the main free spots are your best bet if you get there early, and i mean early, like 5:00 pm or before. the port of san diego has tons of free public parking spaces along shelter island drive. look for the big public parking lots at the shelter island boat launch ramp or shoreline park. they are totally free, but they fill up fast. just make absolutely sure you do not park in any yellow-marked boat trailer spots, those are for trailers only and you will get a ticket. also, port parks close at 10:30 pm, so don't linger too long if you park in a lot like shoreline park.  
  
there are some metered spots as well, like near portside coffee across the street, and a metered lot over there too. the big risk here is the time limit, which might be only two hours. since the show starts at 6:00 pm, two hours is just asking for a ticket, so you'd need to know exactly when the meters stop charging for the night (sometimes 6 pm, sometimes later), and if the two-hour limit is still enforced after that. read the posted signs super carefully before you pay.  
  
pro tip for getting out: shelter island drive can back up at the end of the night. if you want a fast escape, park further down the island, closer to the rosecrans exit, and walk the extra distance to humphreys. it's a nice walk, and you'll save a ton of time not being in the queue for the roundabout.

*Just Another Interview*

Another chair, another room, the same sterile air,

""Why leave your post?"" they ask with a practiced stare.

""Growth and opportunity,"" the hollow lie I sold,

Though we both saw the hunger for the silver and the gold.

Then came the ghost of the future, that old familiar line:

""Where do you see yourself in five years' time?""

I wished I could tell them of a life yet to begin,

Of the love of my life and the warmth of their skin.

Of a small, quiet bundle of joy in my arms,

Far from the reach of these office alarms.

Just sipping on coffee as the sun starts to set,

On a balcony peaceful, with no tasks to met.

But I tightened my tie and I played out the part,

Of the ""MNC leader"" with a cold, hollow heart.

""A better position, helping the firm to expand,

The same tired script every soul in the land

Has recited ten times by the time it is noon—

A well-rehearsed chorus to a corporate tune.

""Why hire you?"" They probed for a reason to buy,

And ""Don't"" was the word that I suppressed with a sigh.

You’re looking for slaves at a reasonable fare,

I’m looking for exits, if I’m being quite bare.

The larger paycheck is the bait on the hook,

While the weight of my burdens is all that it took.

So I’ll lock up my heart, put the feelings away,

To survive the second round later today.

But one day the weight of the world will be light,

And I’ll walk in that room and I’ll give up the fight.

I’ll speak with a soul that is ""actually chill,""

And give them a truth that they never can kill.

No more ""blah blah,"" no more scripted demands,

Just a man with his life held in both of his hands.",2,1767857296.0,TwentiesIndia,3,1.0,False

I feel in some way I have been building towards 75 Hard the last 2 years. My motivation and discipline is on another planet compared to that point in my life. 

I was gambling, smoking weed, drinking heavily, vaping daily and living just for living sake. I had no purpose. 

2 years ago I hit rock bottom. I was crying on the phone to my Dad on Christmas Eve having gambled my monthly pay in a morning, with no money left for getting to my parents or even buy any presents. 

In a way, I am so glad I lost it all that morning and I didn’t prolong my pain for any longer. 

The journey started Christmas 2023. It’s been a rollercoaster since… in a good way. 

I got married, we purchased our first house, I went non-drinking for 6 months, I got back into the gym, and I’ve cut my debt in half. 

Something had been missing through the last 2 years - a purpose. I was building the discipline in a way but never committing and being “all in”. I can only only attribute that to not having a purpose. 

Now I have a purpose. I have a wife and we have a baby on the way. My purpose is being the man I know I can be. 

I have completed the first 7 days of 75 Hard going into Day 8. 

Here is a run down of my first 7 days:

Day 1:

All tasks completed

Indoor Workout: Yoga (great recommendation I found on here for Yoga with Adrienne - YouTube)

Outdoor workout: 1 hour walk (that is how long the loop is)

Day 2:

All tasks completed

Indoor Workout: Gym - Chest / Back

Outdoor workout: 1 hour walk 

Day 3: 

All tasks completed

Indoor Workout: Gym - Shoulders / Arms

Outdoor workout: 1 hour walk 

Day 4:

All tasks completed

Indoor Workout: Gym - Legs / Abs

Outdoor workout: 1 hour walk 

Day 5:

All tasks completed

Indoor Workout: Gym - Chest / Back

Outdoor workout: 1 hour walk (wrong shoes so now have some cracking blisters)

This was first day back in the office so woke up at 5am. Had taken a photo, read my book, been to the gym before work started. 

*The penny dropped here with the picture - I got changed and had to take my clothes off again at 5:02am because I forgot to do it! Makes for a very silly photo, with trackies round my ankles.

Day 6: 

All tasks completed

Indoor Workout: Gym - Shoulders / Arms

Outdoor workout: 1 hour walk 

Tough day - my wife wanted a takeaway, so she got a Dominos and I had one tuna wrap and a chicken wrap…. I locked her in the bedroom for her to eat it!

Day 7:

All tasks completed

Indoor Workout: Gym - Legs 

Outdoor workout: 1 hour walk 

Diet is protein > 150g, calories deficit. No fast food, no cheat meals and no sugar / chocolate (big one for me).

I have been drinking water and black coffee only. 

Creatine only supplement. 

Protein powder, Greek yoghurt & a fruit of your choice is a life saver for when craving something sweet.

Sometimes cafés aren’t available, sometimes plant milk isn’t stocked, and carrying cartons isn’t practical.



I’m curious:

• In these situations, what do you usually do?

• Do you just skip milk coffee, settle for black, or DIY something?

• Would a ready-made, non-dairy option ever be useful, or is DIY always good enough?

She claims I’m her best friend and favorite person to hang out with, but we never casually hang out.

Her reasoning is she is broke and has tons of debt, yet she goes on multiple trips a year like a weeklong family vacation every summer, multi-day music festivals, spontaneous road trips, etc. She’ll usually include me in these grand plans like the yearly family vacation or road trips, but this is the only time we ever hang out and I don’t have an endless supply of cash or PTO to always be making plans like that just to see my friend.

I’ve asked her to hang out in the past doing things that are low cost and low effort such as getting coffee or going to cheap local shows, but I’ve stopped doing that since I’ve been the only one to extend an invitation. She talks about how we should do the things I suggest, but never wants to plan them herself.

I asked her why we never hang out unless I’m the one making plans and she said she’s “really bad about that” and she “doesn’t think about stuff until it’s in the moment”. She then went on to say part of her not doing much was because of recent expenses when she was already on a tight budget and she can’t afford anything other than get groceries and go to work. She told me this back on 12/2 and 12/3. I know this is getting long, so bear with me here.

So on 12/4 I messaged her back reassuring her we can do stuff that’s free like go on hikes or play video games. I also mentioned it felt like she was doing stuff with other people while I was getting left out because I had logged into my Instagram after several months to delete my account and saw a post where she went to a haunted house with her sister and another friend. I asked her if I’d done something to upset her because last year (2024) I invited her and her sister to a haunted house but didn’t get the invitation reciprocated this year (2025).

She said the reason for that was because this friend, Green, had another group of friends she was originally going with, but they had all bailed on her, so Green invited Pink and then Pink came with her sister. It doesn’t upset me that she took her sister, but I’ve also met Green before and I don’t think she would’ve minded me being there either.

Pink then said she doesn’t want space from me or anything like that and does want to do stuff with me, but again she never made plans. The last time I saw her was at a NYE show I had invited her to. I brought my boyfriend and when I got up to dance, all my other friends eventually got up too and she asked my bf to watch their bags while we all just danced in front of him and he sat alone. Once I noticed this, I went and sat with him, but all of them putting him in that position didn’t feel right to me. I told him to never agree to watch someone’s stuff anywhere ever again. He’s really nice and not the kind of person to dance, so I’m sure he didn’t mind, but it was rude of them regardless.

A few days later on 1/5, Pink suddenly told me she’s going to Disney World soon and paid $800 for a 5-day ticket not including travel or food expenses. She’s going with a couple she’s known for just a while longer before she met me and they’re covering lodging.

I’d already sworn to myself I’m not inviting Pink to anything anymore. It basically feels like a slap in the face that she goes on and on about being broke and in debt so we never do something like get coffee, claims I’m one of her closest friends regardless, then out of nowhere has $1k+ to blow on another vacation. Wtf, man.

# TLDR, my friend is always too broke to hang out with me, her best friend, but has money to spare when it comes to lavish vacations. Fucking end me.

I'm also feeling lots of cabin fever lately in Sacramento and in addition to nature, would love to visit a small town (or city) that has a coffee shop, bookshop, places to wander around etc. This could be on the way to or back. 

Asking this thread because I'm unfamiliar with places that are impacted by snow / winter driving conditions north of Sacramento (Humboldt, Shasta, etc). It's not my first rodeo car camping, I'd be open to either camp or lodging.

I've most recently spent time at Van Damm SP and Gualala. I'd like to avoid the Bay Area and have been to Tahoe plenty times. Grew up here so I'm familiar with Santa Cruz, Monterey, Carmel, SLO, etc. Haven't spent much time north of Sacramento though.

Any spots to recommend? I was looking at Whiskeytown / Redding but there maybe snow? Open to ideas, I just wanna get outta town and go somewhere new! ",1,1767856031.0,norcalhiking,1,1.0,False

But honestly? It felt quiet in a way I wasn’t expecting.
After checking in, I went outside just to walk. The streets were bright, clean, alive yet everyone seemed to be moving in their own world. Couples passed by, friends laughed, delivery scooters zoomed past, and I was just… there. Alone, surrounded by a city that didn’t know me.

I didn’t feel unsafe. Actually, I felt very safe. But I felt small. Like I had stepped into someone else’s life instead of starting my own.

I remember standing near a convenience store, holding a warm coffee, watching people come and go. That’s when it hit me: traveling or moving to a new country isn’t always exciting. Sometimes it’s just you, your thoughts, and a place that hasn’t accepted you yet.

That night didn’t feel like Instagram.
But it felt real.
And somehow, that quiet loneliness made me realize this is the beginning of my story here, not the highlight.

Basically I been hooking up with one of my friend who I been in love with since late 2022. We were hooking up but then We had a falling out from April 2024 until May 2025. We rekindled our friendship that May, so naturally my feelings for him reappeared. Eventually our friendship evolved into Friends with benefits once again. About a couple months into its started feeling like we were doing more than just hooking up. We would hangout a 2-3 times week, grab coffee, shopping, but mostly chilling at his apartment. First off, I have problems expressing my feelings to anyone so it took me a while to confront him about it not feeling so casual on my end AND IF HE HAD FEELINGS FOR ME. He stated that what we were doing this for just fun and things are different. ( prior to our previous falling out in 2024 he confessed to me that he had feelings for me, he already knew I had feelings for him at that point) Soooo naturally I was hurt but I now had to make it seem like I didn't have feelings for him because I didn't want it to be a one way love. So after that conversations months went by, I reframed myself from always texting him first in the mornings, or ill try to be nonchalant, I would even try to create distance with him but that part was sooo hard. flash forward to last Saturday, we decided to go to a club and a random guy basically came up to me and started kissing me, I didn't kiss back but I also didn't move. My friend asked me, ""if you need my help, pull my arm.' but the music was loud so I didn't really understand what he was saying. the guy stopped kissing me and started dancing on me right after that. He then kissed me again and again I just let it happened, he then said, let's make your friend jealous and that's when I pulled away. My friend then said we were leaving, we left and as we were leaving he said, ""Just so you know, after today we are never speaking again"" I got mad and told him we aren't even exclusive. He said I disrespected him (which I get) and then said that's why my previous relationship didn't last and that made me more mad. We got in the car and again I told him how can you be mad when you said what we were doing was just for fun and you didn't feel the same, and he said he told me last week that he wasn't hooking up with anyone but me. That doesn't establish boundaries though, that doesn't make us exclusive at all. If he had  asked if we could be exclusive I would take it in a heartbeat but he never asked. I also told him about a time he kissed his friend in front of me prior to our first falling out but he claimed it’s different because that was just his friend and it was just a peck. So he's really upset about the whole thing claiming he was disrespected (again I get) but like you can't be mad at me when he didn't want to be exclusive, or tell me his feelings for me have changed. Is is valid for him to get upset with me and want to end things? I need unbiased opinions

1q74wuo,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheMoodyCapricorn/comments/1q74wuo/a_letter_to_my_ex/,A Letter To My Ex,"There used to be a time that I envied you. 

Back in 2006 when I told you, at 4 months pregnant, that I wanted nothing more than to be a stay at home mom in the early years the way my mom was; baking cupcakes for every classroom birthday party (of course they had to be store bought and riddled with warning labels by the time I had kids); helping with school and making sure the house was pristine; making a home cooked dinner every night... Your reply was ""That is an old, outdated 1950's way of thinking, and we will both be working to support our family.""

I did get to stay home with our first born for the first 9 months. That was wonderful. I loved the daily tummy time and watching OPB until first nap, then it was time for my soap operas while doing house chores. I would proudly get up in the wee morning hours to brew you coffee before you had to wake for work. I would make you lunch to take with you and sometimes breakfast. While the baby was napping I would wash the mornings dishes and prep for making dinner so I could make sure to have a hot meal ready when you arrived home in the evenings. You hated this job, and you quit when the baby was 6 months old. For the next 3 months we lived off what little savings we had while you half-heartedly looked for work at McDonalds and Winco. 

I only went to work because I had to. And you stayed home with the babies for the next decade. I envied you. I wanted to be at home with my babies. You got to teach them their ABCs and how to tie their shoes while I was at work keeping a roof over our heads and food on our table.

  
But today? Today I pity you. 

  
Today you have no idea who our children are. The baby that made me a mom will be 20 this year. And our baby baby just turned 18. This month it's been 4 years since you spent any real time with our kids. And yet, I am the evil one? Our youngest is closer than I ever was to graduating high school. But you'd prefer they quit school and work with you (not like it's your own business, you're not even a manager there) and live with your best friend who has never met them? You think I'm the weird one, for being creeped out by this person that friended our minor child online and started talking to them without ever being introduced in person first... so yeah, I asked them to block the person until I knew what was going on. Our child's safety being forefront of my mind certainly makes me evil.

  
Now that they turned 18 and did not immediately drop out of school, move in with someone they do not know, move to a town they never lived in more than every other weekend when you USED to spend time with them; and work a job they have no interest in - now you want to tell them you're not their dad anymore? Because the moody teen thing to do is call everyone ""bruh"" (I proudly wear my name) you think it's ok to disown your child? Because this child and your own mother have TRIED over the last few years to make dates to see you and you're always sick or busy? You prioritize your friend over your kids and they feel angry about it. We've invited you for holidays and I've offered to bring the kids anywhere to meet you. I've offered to leave the house so you could come over. I've made suggestions including your family to be the ones to get the kids from me so you do not have to see me. But the excuse you give our 18 year old who wanted nothing more than to spend time with you that the idea of being around me is so horrible that you'd rather spend Christmas alone at home throwing a pity party while your kids get angry that they aren't worth your time. We have lived 45 minutes apart the entire decade of our divorce, but now we ""live too far away""? All you're showing the kids is that you are too important for them. They see you as a joke. They see you working at the hut going nowhere, while mom has been promoted and moving up over the last 19 years. 

  
Need I remind you that we discussed getting divorced, TOGETHER? We were sleeping in separate rooms. Not talking other than about the kids. You filed for divorce behind my back.  But now, I kicked you out of your family? Then, after asking for full custody and the house and me to move out; you meet a non-maternal single mother on Reddit and you IMMEDIATELY asked to move to every other weekend so  you and your new woman could have alone time together. But as of this week, you tell our youngest that it's my fault you missed out on being a dad after the divorce!? 

  
Do I also need to remind you how much you hated your dad for not reaching out and using ""the phone goes both ways"" excuse? You said ""he's the parent, it's HIS job to keep this relationship going"". But now it's our kids' job? You write off the oldest, who is Autistic and has to be hounded to respond to texts from anyone (I barely get any responses and have to call little sibling to get big siblings attention) but since they never reach out to you first they're basically dead to you?!

  
Yeah. You may have gotten the babies. You got to do more early year teaching and fun play times and school activities. But I got to earn my babies trust by being their ride or die throughout some of the hardest years of their lives. I was here for every holiday, every bad day, every report card, every melt down, every birthday, and every time you bailed on plans. 

  
I will gladly take every ""bruh"" thrown my way, because it's always said with a grin on the face of someone that loves me. 

  
I feel sorry for  you. I feel sorry that you cannot see the damage you've been doing over the last 4 years. Holding on to hate you have for me and letting it crumble the relationship you had with our children. I used to envy you for being their safe place. I had to be the bread winner while you stayed at home and spent money on things we didn't need. But since your Reddit momma kicked you out for lacking motivation and drive; and you're all alone in your refuse filled, cigarette ash covered single apartment feeling sorry for yourself; that doesn't give you the right to lash out at our children for standing up to your BS. 

  
""Good luck living with your mom the rest of your life."" They will. They will both always be allowed to live with me for as long as they want or need. Because over the last 10 years I have learned a lot about myself and being a mother and I have done a lot of apologizing and making up for early years. I have been improving myself and discussing these improvements with our children so they can see first hand that I am always upgrading myself for them. Because I love my children I drive 3+ hours a day to get to and from work. Because I love my children I sacrifice what I want to do sometimes to accommodate what they want to do. Because I love my children, they know what love is and they know they deserve a hell of a lot better than you.",1,1767855189.0,TheMoodyCapricorn,0,1.0,False

if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

I'd go with you, side by side, wherever you may go. Through time and space and nations far. Just say the word and reach for me, I'll smile and make it so.

I’m seeking help with understanding what a nutritional morning routine should be like for a woman. I’m probably not saying that correctly but am looking for insight on things 30+ women may eat and drink in the morning that could help beneficial to my health and wellbeing.

I am tired nearly all the time. I do feel stuck in life currently but am working on figuring out how to get myself out of a situation that doesn’t make me feel safe. 

Food hardly ever sounds good to me. Taking bites of food I used to really enjoy and having a hard time getting them down is eye opening to me that my eating is much worse than ever before in my life. I try to distract myself when I’m eating something so I do not think about it. I put collagen in my morning chai tea or coffee to try to get something in me at the start of my day but I’m choking it down and I realize now that it’s not a correct protein that I should be intaking. It’s easier for me to drink things but I do not know what to intake. 

I am going to speak with my new primary care doctor about more of what led me to the position I’m in now but want to know what may have helped any of you start and maybe stay steady with a more healthy eating habit in the morning. I think if I started off with enough protein and whatever else that I’d have more energy through the day and crave less dopamine craving activities. I am not aiming for perfection right now, just a step in the right direction so anything you have to say if helpful and important to me. Thank you for your time, energy and support.

Keeping your home clean and hygienic is essential, but traditional cleaning products can be time-consuming, harsh, and sometimes ineffective. Many people struggle with stubborn stains, limescale buildup, grease, and unpleasant odors, especially in kitchens, bathrooms, and appliances.

1q74nh6,https://i.redd.it/zpcut0xim2cg1.jpeg,That one time I experienced the most scariest part of my life which still makes me think if it was all real from what I've got to experience. The image is where I took it during daytime. But it might be a bit too unsettling at night especially from the view you get from those tree.,"I don’t usually talk about this because it sounds fake when I say it out loud, but this was a real experience and it still messes with me years later. (And this is the second time posting the same thing after posting it somewhere else) (17/M) - Atlanta

When I was 16, there was this one night where I couldn’t sleep at all. My head was pounding, not like a migraine but that dull pressure that won’t let your brain shut up. I figured I’d just step outside and walk it off. I live in Atlanta, and there’s a small park not too far from my place with a bunch of tall trees. Nothing sketchy, just quiet.

It was past 1 AM. Streets empty. No cars, no people, no noise except the wind and my footsteps.

At first, everything felt normal. I was walking, trying to clear my head, when I suddenly stopped because I thought I smelled something… off. I couldn’t even place it at first. I shrugged it off and kept walking, but the feeling didn’t leave. The smell came back stronger. It was this weird mix of something foul and something oddly familiar, like boiling potatoes. And that made zero sense. Who the hell is boiling potatoes at 1 in the morning with no houses around?

The deeper I walked, the quieter everything got. No lights ahead, just trees lining the road. My heart started pounding out of nowhere. I wasn’t scared consciously. I wasn’t panicking. But my body absolutely disagreed. My chest tightened, heartbeat going wild, like my instincts were screaming while my brain was trying to stay calm.

Then that inner alarm hit hard. Not imagination. Not paranoia. Just this overwhelming feeling of RUN. TURN BACK. SOMETHING IS WRONG.

I didn’t argue with it. I turned around immediately and sped up, almost power walking back the way I came. The smell followed for a bit, then faded. I didn’t stop until I was far away. I didn’t look back once.

After that night, things didn’t end. They just… shifted.

I’ve heard people say that encounters like this don’t always show up as something obvious, but they mess with your head later. Nightmares. Anxiety. Weird patterns. That part ended up being true.

I started having dreams that felt way too real. In one of them, I walked into a grocery store and bought snacks like it was a normal day. The store was nearly empty. Just me and a few strangers. Two men and a woman. They were friendly. Smiling. Too friendly. Even in the dream, I felt uneasy, like I was being watched but couldn’t tell by who.

After that, I got into my car and drove off. A few minutes later, the car broke down. I was standing outside waiting when a guy around my age showed up and offered help. Calm, polite, normal. He said he’d call for backup, and until then, we could wait at a house nearby. He pointed toward it.

That’s when I realized something weird. I hadn’t seen that house before. And it definitely wasn’t there earlier.

I didn’t feel like I had a choice, so I went with him.

Inside was a small family. Parents. A little girl, maybe seven. Everything looked normal. They offered coffee because it was cold. We talked. But the entire time, this heavy dread kept building in my chest.

Then I noticed the guy.

His eyes changed. Not glowing or anything dramatic. Just… wrong. Empty. Before I could react, his neck twisted at an angle no human neck should ever twist.

I ran.

I bolted back outside to my car, except the car wasn’t mine. It was old. Blue. Not the black one I owned. I turned around to see if he was chasing me.

The house was gone.

No house. No lights. No people. Just empty space like it never existed.

I woke up with my heart slamming so hard it hurt. I couldn’t move. Putting my feet on the floor felt impossible. I didn’t want to turn my back to the room. I was convinced something was watching me. I stayed buried under my blanket until sunrise, waiting for daylight just to feel real again.

Years later, out of curiosity, I Googled the smell I experienced that night. Turns out I’m not the only one. Some people report food-related scents during supposed paranormal encounters. Cooking smells. Baked goods. Even specific things like boiling potatoes. Some believe it’s linked to a departed person, like a memory or presence lingering. On the darker side, a lot of reports mention foul odors too. Sulfur. Decay. Chemical smells. Those are usually associated with something negative or malevolent.

I’m still trying to make sense of it. I don’t claim to know what’s real or not. But part of me wonders if places hold onto people who died there. Like depending on how they lived, how they died, maybe they don’t move on. Maybe they cling to what they think is theirs. And if someone crosses that line, even accidentally, the aftermath isn’t always immediate.

Sometimes it’s just nightmares. Sometimes it’s anxiety. And sometimes… it’s worse.

I stay away from that park now. I don’t do late-night walks in quiet places anymore. Maybe it was stress. Maybe my brain played tricks on me. But whatever it was, it felt aware.

And if I ever came face to face with something like that again, I’m not gonna lie. I’d probably pass out on the spot. Ain’t no way I’m dealing with shit like that while my own eyes are wide open. So passing out is the best option other than staring at something disturbing that’ll make me regret till I’ve get my memories reset or sum....",6,1767854317.0,strange,5,0.64,False

His cousin's jaw dropped. His sister made this choking sound.

""He's been so distant since she got sick. I know it's wrong but I can't keep being the strong one.""

I tried to stand up and he held up his hand without even looking at me. Just kept reading in this flat, dead voice that made my skin crawl.

""Come to room 237. I don't want to be alone tonight.""

His grandmother started crying. Not because of the funeral, because of me. I could tell the difference.

I don't even know how he found them. I'd been so careful. But apparently when he was writing on his laptop at 2am, trying to find the right words about his mom's kindness and strength, my phone lit up on the coffee table with Marcus's reply. ""Last night was exactly what we both needed.""

He'd unlocked my phone. Read everything. Then decided this was how he wanted to honor his mother's memory, by exposing what kind of person her son had married.

When he finished reading he looked right at me and said ""My mother always told me to surround myself with people who would show up when things got hard. Guess she was right about spotting who wouldn't."" Then he sat down and his sister started the actual eulogy while I sat there with everyone staring at me like I'd pissed on the casket.

I left before the reception ended. What else could I do.

But here's the thing. I wasn't lying in those texts. He HAD been distant. For six months while his mom was dying he barely touched me, barely talked to me about anything except hospice schedules and medication times. I felt invisible. Marcus was a bartender at the hotel where I'd gone to ""clear my head"" and he actually listened to me. He saw me as a person, not just a support system.

One night turned into texting. Texting turned into meeting up again the night before the funeral because I genuinely could not handle being in that house with all that grief pressing down on me. I needed air. I needed to feel something other than suffocated by someone else's sadness.

I tried to explain this to him two days later when he finally answered one of my calls. Told him I was sorry for the timing but he had to understand how alone I felt. He laughed. Actually laughed. Said ""You felt alone? My mother died. You felt alone.""

Then he told me he'd already called a lawyer and I needed to be out of the house by the end of the week. I said we could work through this in counseling and he said ""There's nothing to work through. You showed me exactly who you are.""

His family has completely frozen me out. His sister blocked my number. His dad won't respond to my messages. And now I just found out his mom left some money and property in a trust, and there's going to be a reading next month where they distribute everything. I'm still legally his wife. I should be there.

I called the lawyer handling the estate and she said my husband specifically requested I not be allowed to attend. She was polite about it but I could hear the judgment in her voice. Like I'm some villain.

But I'm not. I made a mistake during the hardest period of our marriage. I was drowning and he was too wrapped up in his own pain to notice. Yes, the timing was horrible. Yes, I should have waited. But does one night of weakness really erase four years of marriage? Does it mean I deserve to be publicly humiliated and shut out of everything?

I've tried to apologize. I've sent letters to his family explaining my side. No one will listen. And now I'm being excluded from legal proceedings that directly affect my financial future because he's turned everyone against me.

Am I really the monster here?

I cried so hard today, waves and waves of tears, because someone I’m dating said he couldn’t handle it when I’m drinking and he called it quits. 

He said “we’re done.” We chatted more and I explained a bit of my side and he said let’s put a pause on the relationship for a week and see what happens. He said he loves me and doesn’t want to lose me. My last text to him was “Ok.” Just quiet acknowledgment and maybe acceptance that this is really over.

I went outside for a walk with my sunnies on and was crying when I got to the cafe, the barista gave me a coffee and a cake for free. It was really nice of her. I was trying not to cry in the cafe but couldn’t help it.


Loved ones want me to quit. My parents are alcoholics and my sister said it scares her to see me “acting like them”. I need to quit, for my stability, peace, and maybe for any chance of love. I can’t moderate my drinks or substances, it doesn’t work that way for me. I had 15-20 standards of tequila last night, and every now and then I’ll have a similar night/incident of binging especially around relational stress and anxiety. 

So I’ve decided that I’m done.

I’ve been sat down with four times to discuss how my alcohol consumption affects others in the last three months. I don’t want to be alone. I don’t want to push everyone away. I don’t want to continue down the path of family drinking.

I’m popping this here for accountability. Maybe someone can relate or understand. I feel so lonely right now and can’t stop thinking about him.

**MY YEARS IN FLUX** by Mira Hoffman, Published by Moon River Publisher, Collection: Heroes of Our Times, Date: c. 211X

So, we were stuck. Marooned on Mars with zero way back to the *Lucky Luke* and no line to Earth. The ship probably got a distress signal out before the crash, but right now, we were basically ghosts to the rest of the world.

Captain Nadia Rhodes wasn't interested in a pity party—not while we were burning through precious oxygen. Our mission commander is basically made of titanium and coffee, and she doesn't do ""giving up.""

“Listen up,” she snapped, her voice echoing in my helmet. “Everyone’s alive, which is a start. Now, we inventory the wreckage. Kazumi, Kai—go through the storage and tell me what isn't junk. Mira, Silas—you’re with me. We need a roof over our heads before the sun drops.”

Just like that, I was part of the team. My official job title on the manifest was ""Content & Documentation Specialist""—meaning I was the fluxer meant to stream our triumphs to a billion followers back home. But with the comms array smashed into a million pieces, there was no one to ""flux"" to. My new job? Muscle. Basically, I was just a grunt.

We found the microfiber package labeled “Main Quarters” and thankfully it was intact and on top. Dr. Silas Varma, our lead scientist, and I found a nice flat place to put it. Silas usually spends his time looking at microbes under a microscope, but he was surprisingly handy with a cargo winch.

Behind us, Kazumi and Kai were already tearing into the storage containers like their lives depended on it—which, honestly, they did. Our chief engineer and our ace pilot were knee-deep in crates, scanning barcodes and checking seals to see what actually survived the impact.

""Keep moving, Mira,"" Silas muttered, wiping red dust off his visor. ""The temperature's going to dive in two hours, and I'd rather not be a popsicle when the fans back home finally see your footage.""

I checked my wrist-cam. The ""Offline"" light was a depressing shade of red, but I kept the record button pinned anyway. If we were going down, I was going to make sure someone, someday, saw how hard we fought back.

Nadia hauled a heavy-duty sled over to us, loaded down with a compressor and a couple of high-pressure air tanks. We spent the next thirty minutes on our hands and knees, obsessively checking every seal and inch of the microfiber skin for tears. If there was even one pinhole, this whole thing was just a really expensive body bag. Once we were sure it wasn't a death trap, we signaled Kazumi and Kai to drop the inventory and join us. It was time for the main event: the inflation and the external bracing.

The compressor kicked in with a low, vibrating hum that felt like a heartbeat. Watching that microfiber skin bloat and stretch was like watching a ghost come to life. While the habitat took shape, I was hauling the solar arrays—twenty sleek, heavy slabs of silicon that were our only ticket to a warm night. Kazumi was already wrestling with the exterior interface, her fingers flying as she slotted in the battery blocks. They were green-lit and fully juiced, enough to keep us going for a week as long as we didn't get greedy with the heaters.

Kai jumped in to help me pivot the panels one by one. We aligned them dead-north, making sure the micro-motors were primed to hunt the sun the second it cleared the horizon. We even double-checked the night-shrouds—the automatic silver covers that snap shut to protect the glass from the freezing cold or the sandpaper effect of a Martian dust storm. If those failed, we’d be sitting in a dark, silent tent by Tuesday.

While we were playing tetris with the solar slabs, Nadia and Silas were wrestling the airlock into position. This thing was a serious piece of tech—super advanced, zero-leak, and built like a vault—but it was a total bottleneck. It could only cycle two people at a time, and the ""empty"" cycle was a grueling twenty-minute wait while the pumps fought the Martian vacuum. The refill? That was the easy part—ten seconds of a massive *whoosh* and you’re inside. It’s basically the world's most high-stakes elevator, and right now, it was our only way into the one place on this planet that wasn't trying to kill us.

Stepping inside was the first time I'd felt my heart rate drop since the crash. It wasn't just a plastic bubble; the interior walls were lined with a soft, warm-toned fabric that made the place feel less like a lab and more like a home. We spent the rest of the day in a blur of motion, clicking the five living alcoves into place and getting the micro-kitchen online. By sunset, we even had the communal space set up with the monitors and the local server. It was loaded with enough entertainment vids to last us a decade, which felt like a weirdly grim insurance policy.

Nadia stood in the center of the communal area, her helmet finally off. She looked like she’d aged five years in five hours, but she managed a tired smile.

“Good work, everyone,” she said, her voice sounding small without the suit’s speakers. “Congratulations on a job well done. Now, let's get some warm food in us and survive our first night on Mars. Tomorrow, we start the real work.”

I thought I wouldn't be able to sleep with the excitement and all that, but ""tomorrow"" came in an instant. That’s what hard work does to you—it skips the loading screen.

Breakfast was fast, and then we hit the briefing. ""First priority is long-term survival,"" Nadia said, pacing the small communal space. ""What did we lose in the crash?""

“The good news? The shock absorbers and the landing rockets saved the shuttle's shell, so we've got the hardware,"" Kai said, leaning against a storage crate. ""The bad news? The engines are toast, and the high-gain comm unit was turned into a pancake.""

""Then we focus on the basics,"" Nadia decided. ""Food, water, oxygen. Once we're stable, we figure out how to phone home. Maybe they'll send a rescue op, maybe they won't, but we aren't waiting around to find out.""

Easier said than done. It took five years to build the *Lucky Luke*, and I knew for a fact there wasn't a backup ship even on the drawing board.

“I suggest we build a small temple to *'The True Path of the Void Hermit,'*” I joked, flashing a grin. Everyone actually laughed. Even in the middle of a disaster, everyone knew about the Hermit’s supposed miracles—though the Hermit himself probably wouldn't care if we were stranded on Pluto, let alone Mars.

The next few weeks were a blur of ""real work."" We scouted ice patches, hooked up the refineries for water and oxygen, and I got stuck with the most glamorous job of all: the insect farm. Turns out, my followers back home would've loved the ""Protein Queen"" content, but here, it was just me and a lot of crickets. Kai and I spent our extra hours on the vegetable plots, trying to grow enough greens to keep us—and the bugs—alive. I kept fluxing the whole thing, recording silly interviews with the crew to keep our spirits up.

Then the ""Routine"" hit. And on Mars, routine is just another word for ""trying not to lose your mind."" To keep the space-madness at bay, Nadia had us spend our evenings brainstorming the ultimate comeback story—how to actually talk to Earth again. Silas was the one who finally cracked the code.

""Look, we went full high-tech, and look where that got us,"" Silas said during one of our nightly huddles, giving us a tired smile. ""The digital array is fried. You can't repair a shattered quantum processor with a multi-tool. So, we’re going analog. Short range.""

“How does short range help?” Kai asked, skeptical. “The ship’s brain is fully digital.”

“The comm array is, yeah. But the scientific suite? That’s a different story,” Silas explained. “The ship is in auto-orbit, snapping high-res pics of the surface to see if anything changes.”

“We’re the change!” I interrupted, getting that old fluxer spark back.

“Exactly. It’ll detect the camp and beam the images back eventually. But it’s also listening for radio noise on every frequency. So, we build the most archaic radio device possible and send pulses. Three shorts, three longs, three shorts. Morse code. SOS. If that doesn't get the AI’s attention, I’m officially retiring to a crater.”

So, we all became ""Analog Ops"" specialists overnight. My job? Building the ""Antenna-Foil Monster."" I spent days crafting a massive three-meter antenna out of scrap metal and literal kitchen foil. It was a total monstrosity—looked like a giant's DIY science project gone wrong—and the emitter we hooked up to it was a frankenstein-beast of old wires and stone-age tech.

But when we finally flipped the switch, it felt like we were throwing a flare into the dark. We started sending our first message of hope into the stars, praying someone, or something, was listening.

My eSIM backup saved me,"So there I was in Lisbon last Tuesday, 9:50am, coffee ready, notes prepped, waiting to jump on a quarterly review call with a client who pays 40% of my monthly income. The kind of call where you absolutely cannot reschedule because their whole leadership team blocked out the hour. The Airbnb listing said ""high speed fiber internet"" which I now understand means ""sometimes works when it feels like it.""

At 9:50 the WiFi just... vanished. Not slow. Not spotty. Gone. I tried the classic unplug the router, wait, plug it back in. Nothing. Messaged the host who responded ""oh yes sometimes this happens, usually comes back in few hours."" Few hours. My call was in ten minutes. Sent three more messages asking if there was a backup router or if neighbors had WiFi I could use. Got left on read. Thanks for that.

I've been doing this remote thing for three years now and honestly thought I had my systems figured out. Backup battery, noise canceling headphones, portable monitor. But I got lazy about connectivity redundancy because ""Lisbon has great internet everywhere"" according to every nomad blog ever written.

Started sweating, frantically opening every app trying to figure out options. Genuinely considered running to the cafe down the street and just taking the call from there like some unhinged person. Then I remembered I had an eSIM on my phone, some random one I grabbed before the trip (Yoho Mobile I think?) mostly for walking around data so I wouldn't burn through my home carrier's international rates. Never actually planned to use it for work.

Hotspotted from my phone and weirdly it just... worked? Didn't drop once through the entire 45 minute call, client never knew anything was wrong on my end. I was genuinely shocked it held up for video.

What I do now: I treat WiFi as primary and cellular as the real backup, not the other way around. Test the hotspot speed before any important call day, not during the panic. And I stopped trusting Airbnb listings that say ""perfect for remote work"" without checking reviews specifically mentioning video calls.

Left the host three stars and mentioned the WiFi situation in the review. She responded publicly saying I should have ""contacted her sooner"" about the issue. I messaged her literally the moment it went down but okay.

The irony is I've had way more WiFi disasters in supposedly ""digital nomad friendly"" cities than in random small towns. Lisbon, Medellin, Bali... all places where the infrastructure gets hyped but individual apartment connections are a complete lottery. Meanwhile some tiny town in Portugal had rock solid fiber because only three people were using it.",0,1767853510.0,digitalnomad,14,0.3,False

Posting to this community because I know he has bipolar (manic type, not sure which one that is though I apologize) and wondering if maybe that has something to do with the way he treats me. 

I’m 20 and live with my father still, this past year was the worst year of my life. My husband who I loved very much cheated on me and is still with his new lover, I had to move out quickly due to him getting aggressive with me. I’ve never had a real relationship with my dad growing up, he was absent most of the time and barley remembered to call or text and while he claims my mom withheld us from him I don’t buy it. 

But this past year I’ve also been trying to get closer to my dad, so when my husband was getting violent with me and I knew I had to leave quickly the first person I called was my father. My mom paid for my flight to leave and my father picked me up from the airport. 

In the beginning it was great, it felt like he really cared and was trying to help me gain my confidence back, he was taking me fun places, brought me with him when he was doordashing so I wouldn’t be lonely at the house and built me a bunk bed so I could stay in the same room with my 5 year old sister. It was really great until the 3rd month being there. He started getting more snappy over small stuff with me and started talking about how “old I look for my age” and about how “when I was your age I looked so young, but you look really old”. Basically he just started trying to put me down whenever he could but weirdly also complimenting himself in the same breath. It felt weird and at first I thought I was overreacting but now that I’m 7 months into living with him I know he’s doing it, I just don’t know why. Every chance he gets he reminds me of how talented and well liked he is and how I’m not. We argue quite frequently now too although I try to defuse before it goes too far, if I don’t it usually ends with him curling into a ball and crying or punching something. The last argument that really bothered me was about my little sister. 

Ever since I’ve been here i had been babysitting her and had to take very little hours at work, just so he could go back to work (he had been living off of disability before I came). I plan on getting a good job soon, I’ve been preparing the last 3 months and I told him abt how when I move out I could still babysit her from my apartment as long as he could drive her to me. But he started getting all cryptic and was like “dont worry about it, I already have a plan”. I asked him if he had found a different babysitter for her and he was like “stop asking abt it, I already said I have a plan” I got so confused by the sudden rudeness and questioned further and that caused him to scream at me that I never know when to stop and that I don’t shut up, I got upset and started yelling too and that argument ended with him punching my thermos and spilling coffee all over my lap. After that we both went quiet and I was just trying to focus on not crying. Finally we got to our house and he just told me “I don’t like you, I love you, because you’re my daughter, but I don’t like you. Just stop asking me stuff I can handle on my own from now on” and ushered me out of the car before he drove off for work. I just went to my room and cried. I know he said he loved me but it really feels like hate, especially with how he’s been pinning my little sister against me. In the beginning, he was trying to bring us closer and he would reprimand her whenever she was bad (mostly her kicking, hitting or throwing a tantrum when I don’t give her what she wants) but recently he almost encourages it and sometimes even starts it. 

Just today as my father was driving me to work I was playing a game with my little sister when my dad reached back and took her cat headband off her head and put it on his own, she kept trying to grab it but he’d swerve and at one point he said “your big sister told me to steal it from you” which caused her to turn to me and kick me before pouting, I grabbed it off of his head and handed it back to her and told her she knows that I wouldn’t do that and he said “baby who do you think is telling the truth” and she looked at both of us before deciding he was. My dad just laughed and my little sister kept pouting and trying to scratch me. I kept telling her she needed to be good and she told me “I just can’t be” and that caused my dad to laugh and tell her “good job” before she went back to trying to scratch me. It really made me feel like I had no one who cared, and I know it’s stupid because she’s still so young but I have a feeling she will genuinely never like me as she gets older. 

I genuinely think he hates me but I don’t know why, I’ve tried everything. I tried overachieving, I’ve tried helping him out, ive tried giving him space, I’ve tried straight up asking him how I can make him like me, but nothing works. It seems like he hates me more and more everyday yet I always find myself going to him for advice, I have other people in my life I could ask but I always go for him. I don’t know why I do, I’m always telling him abt my goals and dreams too even though he makes it obvious he’s not listening . 

The one time in this whole time I’ve been living here is when I briefly dated this woman, she was so sweet and adventurous , in my 3 months of dating her she showed me around the state and showed me all of the good spots to hang out, go clubbing, or just kill time together. I introduced her to my dad because I was over the moon. But her second time meeting my dad he ‘accidentally’ convinced her to breakup with me. She had no idea I was depressed, she knew abt my husband and our ongoing divorce and the whole backstory but part of the reason she liked me so much was because even after all that I was still so positive. I am depressed, I won’t lie, but I never told her, I just felt I should show her the very best of myself and eventually my sadness would go away, which it did start to with her. But he sat on my bed chatting with her and started drilling in how depressed I was. “Look at how messy her room is, if it weren’t for work she wouldn’t even leave her bed” “she’s always crying about something, she thinks she’s being secretive and that I can’t hear it but I do” “she was so depressed when she first got here I had to help pick her up” “you’re so nice and happy to be around, but she’s such a negative person, maybe you can make her nicer one day”. He said so much more but with everything he said I saw her getting more and more overwhelmed, she just kept politely laughing and looking at me. After that he guilt tripped her into helping me pick up my room even after I told her to please not and after an hour of helping she left, the next week she told me she had no idea I was so depressed and that with her also having depression it would be too much to handle and broke up with me. I was so upset I didn’t even know what to do. For 2 days I stewed on what to say to my dad, then finally when my little sister was at her moms house one day and he was driving me to work I told him how she broke up with me, and why. At first he didnt care or even pay attention to it until I told him I couldn’t trust him anymore. Then he got upset, he started yelling at me and told me it’s my fault for not telling her in the first place but I snapped and started crying and told him how there was no reason for me to tell her if it was something I was trying to fix and something she didn’t see. He tried arguing but when he saw me crying he tried hugging me, whenever I cry in an argument he tries to hug me yet never actually apologizes and I hate it. I told him I don’t want his hug and he just tried telling me how I shouldn’t blame him because “how was he supposed to know she would leave me over that”. I didn’t argue anymore and just went into my work when we arrived.
 

 I just wish I knew what to do, how do I stop talking to him about my life and asking for advice and care when all he has ever shown me at best was disinterest. Has anyone else ever lived through this before and been able to solve it? I don’t even know where to begin on what I should do, I feel so alone and dejected.

Mia(27F) was friendly and actually asked me questions, so I ended up talking to her more and discussing the book with whoever would engage. Still, it felt awkward because I was only there because Tara pushed so hard.

  
I’m not trying to psychoanalyze her, but I’m confused and annoyed. What’s a normal way to address this at work without making it dramatic?

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

Here is no Question of Holy Books quotes, Personal Experiences, Faith or Belief. i accept that Sometimes Faith is also Blind. Here is already Practical explanation which already proved that every\`1 else in this world is nothing more then Busy Foolish and totally idiot.

Source(s):

every \`1 is already Blind in this world and if you will follow another Blind then you both will fall in hole. so try to follow that person who have Spiritual Eyes who can Guide you on Actual Right Path. ( my Authority & Guide is my Spiritual Master "" Srila Prabhupada "" )
