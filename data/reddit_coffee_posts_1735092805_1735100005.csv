1hltexr,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1hltexr/the_ideal_of_getting_over_one_guy_by_getting/,The ideal of getting over one guy by getting under another?,"I was with my ex and the father of my children for 6 years. It was not a great relationship, but it could've been worse in many ways. Before the end, I sort of checked out. It was clear there was nothing left we could do to fix anything between us. On my end, it felt like he had changed so much from the man I first met to the one he was now and I was just sick of all the lying and begging him to work harder on making better decisions for himself and our family. We broke up almost a year ago now. He left town (where our families are settled) for about 6 months. He called to talk to the kids once a week for 5 minutes at a time but no one really knew what he was up to. I wanted nothing to do with him. I hated him. He came back all happy, and I was struggling with taking care of our kids and working a full time job to keep us off the streets. It made me feel resentful; but strangely, it felt nice to see him. We were actually able to sit and talk, and laugh with eachother for the first time in what felt like forever.. It was almost like when we were kids falling in love. 
So, getting the news that he's been seeing someone else and feeling upset was a huge thing. I dont want to be with him. I know now he's not good for me, even if I wish I could give my children a 2 parent home that I wish I had had. But it wasn't just 6 years gone by with him. It was all the memories, good and bad. The big and little touches. The love and the heartbreak. Do I want him because he was what I had? Because he's what I'm used to? Why can't I just stop thinking about him? 
Now that he has the children every weekend, I found I had a lot of free time on my hands. For the first week, I cleaned the house top to bottom, caught up on laundry, and read a book. It just seemed like the only thing to do without my kids. Then the next weekend came and I found myself needing to do something. Anything. So I went to the big town near me. No plan, just looking to interact with anyone new. I met a man in a coffee shop. He was kind, and I asked to chat. We talked for a few hours. He's a single dad with 2 kids, too, and he seemed like a great guy. We exchanged numbers, but I had no real intention of pursuing him and didn't think was serious about contacting me. I mean, I'm still caught up on my ex and I definitely don't consider myself 'a catch'.  But he did contact me and now I've met New Guy a few times. When he asked to meet for lunch a week later, I explained my situation better. ""I'm not interested in being with anybody right now. Although I know I won't go back with my ex no matter how much my heart tells me that I still want to, I'm not physically or emotionally ready to start something with somebody. It wouldn't be fair to either one of us."" He said he understood and just needed someone to talk to and hang out with. So I accepted, and it's been great hanging out with someone new and refreshing.   Now that New Man is in my life, I've been struggling with the thought of 'maybe I should just sleep with him'. He mentioned a few times how pretty I am and even gave me a chaste kiss on the side of my lips on time to say goodbye. In passing, he has mentioned being ready to be with someone, and how he thinks I could be the one to love him right. It didn't feel weird for him to say that, it was actually rather sweet. He is rather handsome, and we have so much in common. Our children have met and get along well. I not in love him, but I consider him a good friend now. I don't know what to do.. On one hand I struggle with knowing that if my ex and I did ever get back together I would feel like I cheated on him if I slept with someone else, even though I know he could be doing that very same thing right now and not bat an eye. And also knowing how I feel about sleeping with a man I do not love, I just keep saying that it's not a good thing to do. On the other hand, it's been almost a year... A woman has needs! And he's really good looking! And if I put my feelings aside, I have no reason to say no. I mean, it'll be fun, most likely... He's a good man, and a good friend. I can trust him, right? But isn't that just getting over one guy by getting under another? I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO!",1,1735099795.0,BreakUps,0,1.0,False

1hltcfo,https://www.reddit.com/r/AddictionAdvice/comments/1hltcfo/going_through_a_lot_at_one_time_and_need_advice/,Going through a lot at one time and need advice before it’s too late. ,"So just to start off with some context. I was introduced to ice when I was 19. I’ve always had hyperactivity and hyper sexuality from a young age. I was sexually aware and socially aware very early (5-6 y/o). I was never touched as a child but I did go through a fair amount of abuse. My mom had a toxic boyfriends when I was very young about the same age I stated above. The bf would do stuff like take his anger out on me by spanking me randomly or taking my toys, turning my tv off,  cursing at me and speaking ugly when my mom was present. Finally, I remember being woken up to my stuff being packed and we loaded up in my mom’s Honda and hauled ass to a family home. My great grandfather had a big house with a big pool and a whole den that led to a small suite on the side of the house. My mom was always at work and I’m the first born male, son, grandkid etc. Basically, I was brought everywhere by everybody as a child. So much in fact that for a long time whenever I went to the doctors office, sign ups for school, the dentist etc they would see the last name and call my aunts name instead of my mom’s.  My grandad has always looked out for me like nobody truly. He was a college athlete and didn’t finish due to having kids normal shit.  He would create small mini games out of any chore or task. If we had to clean the toys up, we would throw them like shooting a basketball stuff like that. My mother eventually got her stuff together to a degree and got a small apartment with her new bf when I was 7. It was nice at first and the bf like playing video games and going to the park to work out and he always made me set chore lists daily when I got home to complete. I was a good kid or responsible I should say so I always did chores and stuff. Then one night I remember hearing my mom screaming in the room. The following week he comes in my room in the middle of the night and says “if you piss in the bed again I’m gonna spank you”. So I got spanked a few times then stopped ofc. I then had a small $5 prepaid phone that only worked for a certain amount of min real old school. I kept texting my mom to get me a Pepsi when I got out of school. When I got gone he was sitting in a chair with a belt and a 2 liter of Pepsi and he told me to drink it. He told me if i throw up he will beat me. So essentially set me up for failure and he beat me buttnaked in the kitchen and my friend/cousin was there too. This pattern would continue to keep ramping up. He lost his job and before we went to family outings he would tell me not to tell my grandpa or he would beat me… but I was 7 and I knew it wasn’t right to keep stuff on top of my grandfather being a very intelligent man. So he would pry the info out of me and bitch at my mom. He then started to do stuff like make me hold bats with my arms out or plank for hours and Ik that’s hard to believe for my age but it happened so I’m guessing it’s a fear factor type thing. If I dropped that bars or stopped holding position he would beat me and make me do it again. My mom who was also being abused started to sit on the couch and join in by laughing at me shaking or hop. One day she finally got upset with him bc he was really digging into me. He then made her bend over and he spanked her in front of me and made her spank me after. They eventually ended up having an accidental pregnancy and I had a sister. When they both had to work at the same time, they would take me out of school and have me watch her quite a bit. My father was trying to be in my life and he wouldn’t allow it. When we moved u to a new house that my grandpa got us, it’s got worse. They had another kid as well so now I had a baby brother. Whenever the two kids would fight  or they didn’t pick etc . He would beat me and say mean stuff to me. Then he would turn around and wake me up in the middle of the night when I had school and play video games with me and buy me food and say don’t tell your mom. Both of them would go through vicious cycles of working a lot and being absent. Then they would turn around be jobless for a month or two or three lol. Whenever he was mad he would beat me very badly sometimes to the point where I’d bleed and use the bathroom on myself. They would laugh at me and even brought it up at a family gathering bc my family loved this man. I would pray all the time that I would get out that house and have a new family. They ended up being together all the way through my elementary experience and half of my middle school era. We were dirt poor and lived with my grandad. They would not do the small shit he asked like make sure that the kids room was clean upstairs, or the den be clean, or don’t smoke in the house. And they would make me lie to my grandad on a daily bases. He was so blind that I finally hinted that my step dad was abusing me bc he asked me if my parents were working and I didn’t wanna answer bc the look on his face was so heartbreaking. I told him that I’m not allowed to answer that. He said it’s his house and he’s the man of the home also that he does a lot for me so I better cough it up. I told him yes with such pain in my face. He got upset with me and told me all we do is lie to him. I then told him the truth finally. About a lot of stuff and it broke my heart when he said that “it’s their decision and he can’t be involved” I know he was saying that for his own reasons but to this day he’s still my role model I always thought that moment would’ve went down drastically different. I was never allowed to leave the yard bc I had to watch my siblings even at the age of 14. Around that time, we lived in a small trailer park. They were still doing the same patterns. His ps3 broke and he made up some shit where I told him to hush or something and that I didn’t clean up my room bc my grandparents got me a ps3 for my bday. He kept mine in a box less than a month after getting it. I was good at basketball and he would come outside and take the ball from me while I was playing with my friend(s) and would say I’m not watching my siblings but he was home jobless. I won two shootouts at carowinds and when I was picking my prize he picked for me and gave the ball to my baby sister with his favorite team’s logo on it. I was getting closer to my teenage years so I started not giving a fuck about the abuse part and genuinely stopped buying into the bs. I made sure to do all my shit and was doing great in school and sports. I would also get my siblings up in the am for school and walk the to the bus but also clean up after them completely before he could say his usual shit. So then he started pulling dishes out of the cabinets and making me washing them bc he felt they were dirty every single day haha typing this makes me laugh bc wtf lolllll. So I came home from school and he had them sat out on the counter tops per usual and I didn’t say anything and I washed them with a smile on my face. He asked me why I was smiling and I said “you know why” he got in my face and said if I think I’m man enough then do it. I continued to smile and told him his breathe stunk. He grabbed and drug me in their room and started beating me. But this time I kept rolling and I kicked him in the face. My mom came home from work and told him to stop. They then argued and all the other abusive routines. I then get called into the living room and he’s holding a gun to his head saying that if my mom doesn’t love him anymore he’ll kill him self and that if they are breaking up it’s because of me. Come to find out my dad had found his number by calling around for years and got real mouthy calling him all types of shit. So my mom and I started talking shit about my step dad on the side and then my mom betrayed me after engaging initially… whenever she didn’t like something I said, or if a family member was giving her grief based off their observations of me etc, she would tell him everything and I would get fucked up. He started doing stuff slapping me in my face to wake me up for school. Or he would keep me away from my family members. I begged my mom to make me a Facebook and finally she did when he was home. And I told my grandma and he husband. They came and got me randomly and told me to have a bag. I brought a few pairs of clothes and that was it. My step grandpa got upset with me for not having enough stuff to stay for a school year and he starts yelling at me. I told him I only have like two pairs of pants and that I had been going into their bathroom and using toiletries bc I didn’t have anything for weeks when I ran out. After realising how much there was to be done they dropped me off a few days later and I was so hurt. I don’t want to put it like that bc it’s not their job to a degree but damn it hurt like hell and I’m an adult now that can clearly understand what was really going on. A few months later, I got pulled out of school again per usual, this time it was because my grandma went to my grandpa and told him a lot of what’s happening. He conceited my step dad while we were at school. Next thing I knew with a snap of a finger over night all that transpired and I’m back living with my grandfather. My mom was still staying away from him in his house. He and I were like best friends. I started getting into basketball because I was never allowed to play that sport specifically bc my step dad didn’t play it. (My bro and sister both played soccer and he never in his life played soccer) I had to box or play football. School was going good as well. When I was 15 my mom wakes me in the middle of the night and a man was standing in the kitchen when I came down stairs. It was my biological father. We talked for a bit and he said he was gonna get me clothes and a phone. He did. And a ps4. We then started spending everyday together at my cousins house. We were at my granddads house one day and my grandad walked in. He said my father had to leave. Then he checked my mom and said she knows better. I then started asked my family and friends of my mothers about my dad and they said he was tough charismatic but also violent and ignorant. (Surprise surprise). So one day we are sitting at my cousins house playing madden and in trash talking him. He told me that if I keep doing that he was gonna bend me over and spank me. Keep in mind I’m 15. Then he kept going and going and wouldn’t stop poking at me then we almost got physical in the living room. He told my mom to take him home. Yes that’s right. My mom was hauling him everywhere and not working. And she had the little ones with her bc she would leave them with me or my grandad and he threatened to kick only her out. She started to sit outside all day and all night in the car with him parked in the driveway. I would see her sneak him I and stuff like that. Eventually we went a a vacation trip to Gatlinburg Tennessee funded by my grandfather once again. And they get into it at the condo we were staying in. It was me and my immediate fam and my mothers long time best friend and her son who is my cousin I keep referring to. We are one year apart. My father slapped my mom and grabbed her by the neck in front of everybody and  drug into the room then slammed the door behind them. I told my cousin to take my sibling in a room bc he’s not really that type. And I kicked in the bedroom door of the condo and tackled my father into a closet. He grabbed me by my hair and I’m taller/ larger than him so I was putting him in a hold to some degree. My mom and her friends started breaking us up and they all started yelling at each other in the kitchen. My dad then put his hands on my mom and her friend and my cousin kris started yelling and I went back in for round 2 haha. We were tussling on the floor and did a lot of damage to the kitchen. All three of them jumped on us trying to break it up and I went and sat down on the couch silent with my brother and sister. He was pacing back and fourth for hours (i do that too when I’m upset) he randomly walks up to me and grabs me by my hair unexpectedly while I’m in resting position in a recliner and balls fist and said he’d wipe me.i told him to do it with tears in my eyes and the police walked in. My mom’s friend called them secretly. So I thought it was the end of him. But nope my mom stayed in Gatlinburg and got him bailed out by lying to the authorities. She then realised that she was being alleged as a contributor to abuse and she was shocked. L O LLL. I’m back at my grandads getting ready for school in the am and my mom walks in with my father, they waited till my grandad left. He comes in and says that I disrespect him and ion call him dad and all this shit. I just smiled like I use to with my step dad. He  slaps me in the middle of taking a drink of my coffee. I didn’t start with him because I refused to disrespect my grandads home. All I did was stare at my mom bc she was looking in shock at what just happened. Then I went to school per usual. She then proceeds to keep trying to push a relation over and over. I got tired and told my grandpa the truth. He gave my mom one month to get her act together and move into the trailer from my childhood. Her and my dad move in there. They brought my brother and sister. They were upset I didn’t wanna come LOLLLL. They started influencing my brother and sister to not interact with my grandfather. He then always thought they didn’t like him their whole life but they were scared of him bc of my mom. My grandpa was going into retirement and I was in 10th grade. He told me it sucks but imma have to go back to the house with my mom. And I understood. I’m even brought to tears thinking of all he’s done for me. Not even a whole year into being there I went from a A-B student projected to go to Winthrop university and had also gotten accepted into Johnson and wells university. To skipping school all the time or being so angry or so grown or so tired as teenagers tend to do that I would sleep the whole day and stay in my room depressed. The house quickly fell apart bc nobody cleaned but me and I’m not making this to seem as tho in the only person based on bias… I really was. My brother sister we’re use to me doing it and my mom always blamed everybody for shit and didn’t ever do it herself. I’ve spent most of my life being her big brother while she ruins mine. I dropped out my 11 th grade year. Stuff at home had gotten so bad and she’d still try and blame me or my siblings for things. There were so many roaches and spitters u couldn’t see the floor in the middle of the night and they would crawl all over you. Moody pits and pans stuffed in the oven, I could never have anybody over or anything. When I finally let my friend group that I loved into my home it backfired bc one of them stole my vape and when I confronted them they went home and called DSS and told people at school about my living situation. I also had respitory infection and eventually contracted mono. I lost a bunch of weight and had no energy. My grandad randomly showed up in the middle of the day and the first thing he’s says is “damn son are you doing drugs?” That shit hurt me so deep inside. We were eating out of church blessing boxes or the one fast food meal my mom bought when she got off. My mom was training for a job for two months and the training was a state away. I stayed with my siblings the whole time. But yet she’d tell the family how disappointed she was in me for dropping out. My aunts husband didn’t let my cousins come around me and said I was a bad influence but again I was very aware at a young age… so why did you say shit when these things were happening to me. This tends to be the theme. My mom then becomes pregnant AGAIN and have my full biological sister. A few months prior to that my dad finally just left after an every day trauma marathon. I yelled and cried at my mom and told her to get rid of it. I had just had an abortion with my high school sweet heart and she was at my house recovering as well. I told my mom I didn’t wanna watch my siblings go through the same thing I did bc they were already on track to. I told her she’s selfish and knows that she’s gonna make them do the same thing but they won’t be as responsible bc they aren’t the oldest nor have the had to clean up after themselves. When my sister was born me and my gf at the time watched her so much that she started saying my name before the simple ma-ma. I also was given a car by my grandfather and she told him all types of shit and we would argue. He said he’s gonna get another car since my mom keeps needing rides or taking mine and when he got it he told us to decide amongst ourselves who would get the newer car and we started arguing and he always got frustrated and called us both selfish. Then I didn’t understand but as an ADULT it’s fucking obvious how ungrateful that was. And even at the time I gave the new car to my mom. After getting super close to my baby sister for essentially being her dad. I come out my room one morning and see my father holding her and she was asleep on his shoulder and my mom was sitting beside her. After that, my siblings repeating a lot of the same behaviours, and my long time lover and I broke up I moved out. I had always excelled at cooking and was currently working as a manager at culver at age 18-19 and I also had homebody with homes bc we worked on music together. I was upset with my grandpa for all the one foot in and one foot out and also blaming my siblings for their behaviour bc he wasn’t and still isn’t realizing how much he enables his daughters own behavior. I had become a head chef at 20 living in an apartment with my friend. I finally reached out and spoke with him and said a lot of good things…. And a lot bad things….. when it was over we agreed to create a partnership bc he and I both needed each other for credit history. Me for my age and for him it was something until he could draw social security and keep an income on file while also being consistent within sustaining his credit by adding more debt to his history. I then asked him to co-sign on a brand new car and if not it would be fine I don’t think he owes me a thing and I appreciate him a lot. He then told me he was very proud of the man I have become and I’m very good person with a good head on my shoulders. Once I moved into my home I went through a whole era of trying to help my siblings deal with my mom and I picked my baby sister up every other weekend. She would cry and say she wants to live with me. It still tears me up inside. I’m now 23. I’ve been an executive chef a few places and I also took classes and now mix and master music on the side. I tried ice a few times but never had the urge for it. I’ve always just smoked weed and I dont drink much either. My sister and brother both still carry this animosity for leaving my moms and I told them that I had to as we all have to one day. I tried to help my bro I was driving him to summer school across the city and going to work then picking him up when u got off. I found out he’d been cutting the whole time. After I gave him a place to stay, a phone, clothes, and I got him a job making $15/hr at 14. When uo fronted him he slammed stuff around in my house and called my mom to get him. My other sister just doesn’t talk to me at all and she lives with my old step dad, her biological father. My moved to Columbia and I couldn’t see my baby sister every other weekend anymore… come to find out she was dropping her off at my fathers house and that he lived 10 min away from me. My ex came back into my life and she had a baby on me. My homies are getting older and settling down. All the people around my age try to use me. Whether that be for music , advice , transportation, etc. I use to think it wasn’t using until again I became wiser. So my brother has been dodging the police so he doesn’t have to go to school, my sister isn’t almost done with high school and she’s doing alright. She just doesn’t talk to me but I understand. And my baby sister is lonely in Columbia everyday. I use to travel and work on tons of peoples music and bring in a lot of money. Now I’m jobless and have been mixing and managing artists from to time to time just to pay my bills. I was short on my agreement with my grandfather for the first time this past year but he had also lost his youngest brother and oldest sister. And was also diagnosed with cancer. I am hyper active so my need for communication is a lot to handle and now I’m not even communicating with people much at all and I’m so lonely. I have always been highly addicted to nicotine as well and I’m pretty sure it’s a stimulants thing. I took and IQ and EQ test as well as personality tests. I found out my IQ is 120-135 and I have very high emotional maturity. And barely have any empathy it showed up in both tests. I stop and take 3 week breaks from ice and have been for a long time. But when I binge I binge out. I have a lot of sex, and I mix tons of songs and I’ve made a lot of money due to the proactive ness. But I think the draw back is my emotional and spiritual connections to others… it just keeps getting more and more tragic and lonely. I have been through so much but never have I felt this level of “incomplete or lost or just void of any real life. Music isn’t fun. And working as a chef isn’t either. And neither is the meth. But I still keep doing all three. Does that mean I need to step away even more distant from family and friends? Does that mean I should take a break from it all? I can’t I have to pay bills and gotta get the stress of my grandfather I love that man to death. I wanna walk across that stage and I have to be alive to do it. I wanna walk that stage before he passes it would make him so happy. PLEASE give me tips or strategies or anything that’s you think would help me solve this cluster fuck of a life I’m in. 😣😣😣",1,1735099499.0,AddictionAdvice,0,1.0,False

","Generally I keep to 2-3 cup of coffee a week and it has been going well, but in the past when i quit coffee(and somewhat now since I havent had any in a few days) my thoughts start acting odd? 

I do have adhd, which im guessing is the reason. I'll quit coffee entirely and after some time, mainly a few days or so my thoughts seem to seperate from what im conciously thinking and it starts to feel like im getting someone elses thoughts? to the point where ive felt like someone was trying to communicate with me/asking if anyone heard them? and it sounded more like a thought than someone speaking but it was sort of close? 

And I wouldnt describe the thoughts as originating from myself cause it really doesnt feel that way? Then I drink some coffee a couple days a week and eventually that dies down or back to ""hey yeah its just random flyaway thoughts"". Right now I feel like its more of me somehow listening to my subconcious thought processes, but in the past i thought it was something spiritual (lol)

Not sure what else to do but i've been dealing with it by having a coffee routine.  (Coffee is odd it also sometimes makes me hyped up but usually doesnt, just makes me feel sad sometimes or really anxious and jittery). So far its just having no effect but i guess stopping my brain from being weird. Ive had a few occasions though when I thought someone said something like called my name or asked me to go to another room they were in, but then i realized that it didnt happen which was weird af.

========================================================

When you're cuddling up with your furry buddy, there's nothing quite like that warm, unconditional love. But then, out of nowhere, they lean in for a kiss, and you’re hit with a wave of… well, let’s call it “fragrance.” That's right—dog breath can be pretty potent! But in those moments, you might find yourself wondering, is dog bad breath normal? The truth is, while some degree of doggy breath is expected, especially after they've enjoyed something flavorful (like their favorite kibble or a tasty treat), persistent or foul-smelling breath can indicate underlying health issues.

In this article, we're diving deep into the world of canine halitosis. We’ll explore the causes and treatments of bad breath in dogs, when to worry, and how to keep your pup's breath fresh and pleasant. So sit tight, grab a cup of coffee, and let's sniff out the facts together!

What Causes Bad Breath in Dogs?
-------------------------------

Just like humans, dogs can have bad breath for a multitude of reasons. Sometimes it’s as simple as what they eat, but other times, it might be a sign of an underlying health issue.

### Diet and Feeding Habits

First up on our list is diet. You know what they say: you are what you eat! Well, dogs are no different. Foods that are high in sugars or fats can lead to an increase in bacteria, which can turn your dog’s mouth into a breeding ground for odor-causing culprits. Here are some dietary factors that may contribute to bad breath:

- **Sugary Treats**: Too many treats high in sugar can create a perfect playground for bacteria.
- **Low-Quality Dog Food**: Sometimes more affordable options contain fillers or preservatives that don’t do your dog any favors.
- **Rotten or Spoiled Foods**: Just like us, dogs can experience digestive issues if they munch on something gone bad!

### Dental Hygiene

Now, let's not beat around the bush—dental hygiene is crucial for your dog. Believe it or not, poor dental care is one of the most common causes of bad breath in dogs. Just picture this: if you never brushed your teeth, you’d surely have some whiffy breath too! Here’s what can happen:

- **Plaque and Tartar Buildup**: Bacteria form plaque, which hardens into tartar if not removed, leading to gum disease.
- **Periodontal Disease**: As tartar accumulates, it can lead to periodontal disease, causing inflammation, pain, and even tooth loss.
- **Gingivitis**: This early stage of gum disease can lead to a fishy smell emanating directly from your dog's gums.

### Medical Conditions

If your pup's breath smells beyond typical ""dog breath,"" it could point to potential medical issues. Here are a few to keep an eye out for:

- **Kidney Disease**: A distinct ammonia-like smell can indicate kidney issues.
- **Diabetes**: Sweet-smelling breath might suggest diabetes, particularly if accompanied by excessive thirst or urination.
- **Liver Problems**: An unusual, foul odor can signal liver troubles that require immediate veterinary attention.

How Can I Tell If My Dog's Breath is Abnormal?
----------------------------------------------

Okay, so we’ve established that some dog breath is normal, but how do you know when it’s time to head to the vet? Well, there are several signs that might just raise a red flag:

### Signs of Abnormal Breath

1. **Strong or Foul Odor**: If your dog’s breath smells worse than usual, it’s worth investigating.
2. **Changes in Eating Habits**: If your dog suddenly loses interest in food or has difficulty chewing, don't ignore those signs.
3. **Excessive Salivation**: Drooling more than normal can indicate oral issues or discomfort.
4. **Weight Loss**: Unexplained weight loss often accompanies other health concerns.
5. **Behavioral Changes**: If your lively pup suddenly seems lethargic or in pain, it’s best to consult a professional.

What Can I Do About My Dog's Bad Breath?
----------------------------------------

So, you’re probably wondering what you can do to combat that pesky bad breath. Fret not! There are plenty of strategies to tackle this issue head-on.

### Regular Dental Care

You wouldn’t skip brushing your own teeth, right? So why should your dog miss out? Here’s a quick list of dental care tips:

- **Brush Regularly**: Aim for brushing your pup’s teeth at least a couple of times a week—or every day if you can! Use toothpaste specifically made for dogs.
- **Dental Chews**: Opt for dental chews that can help reduce plaque and freshen breath. Just be sure they’re appropriate for your dog’s size!
- **Regular Vet Check-ups**: Schedule regular dental cleanings with your veterinarian. Professional cleanings can prevent serious dental diseases.

### Healthy Diet Choices

What’s going into your dog's bowl matters immensely. Switching to a high-quality diet can make all the difference. Here’s what to consider:

- **Whole Ingredients**: Look for foods made with whole meat sources and minimal fillers.
- **Balanced Nutrients**: Ensure your dog's food has balanced nutrients tailored to their breed and age group.
- **Hydration**: Keep fresh water available. Hydration helps maintain saliva production, which naturally cleanses the mouth.

### Home Remedies for Fresh Breath

Sometimes, home remedies can be just the trick to fresher breath. While these aren’t substitutes for veterinary care, they could help manage mild cases:

- **Carrots and Apples**: Crunchy fruits and veggies can help remove plaque and freshen breath. Just remember to cut them into puppy-sized pieces!
- **Coconut Oil**: Some pet owners swear by coconut oil for its antibacterial properties. A little spoonful mixed into their meals could do wonders.
- **Parsley**: For a natural breath freshener, sprinkle some chopped parsley onto their food. It’s safe and can help with odor.

When Should You Consult a Veterinarian?
---------------------------------------

Now that we've covered the basics, when should you actually pick up the phone and make an appointment? Here are some pointers:

- **Persistent Bad Breath**: If bad breath lingers despite proper dental care and feeding practices, it’s time to consult a vet.
- **Accompanying Symptoms**: If bad breath is alongside vomiting, diarrhea, or lethargy, don’t wait!
- **Frequent Oral Issues**: If your dog frequently has dental problems, a full dental check-up may be in order.

Preventing Bad Breath in Dogs
-----------------------------

Prevention is always better than cure, right? Here are some effective strategies to keep your pup's breath as fresh as a daisy:

### Daily Care Routine

Creating a daily care routine is essential. Here's what you can do:

1. **Brush Their Teeth Daily**: Make it a fun part of your bonding time.
2. **Choose High-Quality Treats**: Look for treats designed to improve oral hygiene.
3. **Offer Plenty of Fresh Water**: Always ensure they have access to clean water to help rinse away food particles and bacteria.

### Regular Vet Visits

Don’t skip those vet appointments! Regular vet visits can uncover hidden problems before they become serious. Here's a checklist:

- **Annual Health Checks**: Keep your dog's health in check with consistent check-ups.
- **Professional Cleanings**: Schedule yearly or biannual professional cleanings as necessary.
- **Observe Changes**: Keep an eye on any changes in your dog's behavior or health, and report them during visits.

Is Dog Bad Breath Normal? The Final Word
----------------------------------------

In conclusion, dog bad breath is a common concern among pet owners. Although some odor is to be expected, especially after a hearty meal, persistent foul breath may signal a problem that requires attention. By being proactive about your dog’s dental hygiene, choosing a healthy diet, and consulting your veterinarian when necessary, you can help ensure your furry friend enjoys fresh breath.

Remember, a little bit of prevention goes a long way in maintaining your dog’s overall health and happiness. As you cuddle up and enjoy your time together, make sure your dog’s breath is as sweet as their lovable personality!

1hlt91c,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskMenAdvice/comments/1hlt91c/a_love_that_never_fades/,A Love That Never Fades,"When I first stepped onto my college campus for my master's degree, I noticed her immediately. Tina (changed name). I didn’t know her name yet, but I could feel something about her that made my heart race. But I was determined to focus on my studies, to keep my head in the game. I had a goal — to secure a job by my final year. I wasn’t interested in distractions, not even the allure of romance. So, I stayed away from social events, gatherings, and all those college activities that seemed to invite fleeting connections.

My first semester went well. Really well. I ended up with a 9.02 GPA. My classmates were surprised, but I was pleased. It was Tina who congratulated me first. Her words, along with the messages that followed — “Can you clarify this doubt for me?” — gave me a sense of pride, but also something else. An inkling of connection.

Despite this growing curiosity about her, I couldn’t shake Riya (my undergrad crush because of which I’m doing a master’s to get into her company) from my mind. Riya, the girl I had always imagined myself with. Even though she probably wouldn’t have cared, I felt a strong sense of loyalty to her. So, when I landed a job offer in Riya’s company in 3rd semester — in the same location as hers — I was elated, hoping this would bring us closer. I sent Riya email after email, sharing my excitement, but she never replied. Slowly, I realized how little my presence mattered to her. And it shattered me.

A few weeks later, I learned something unexpected. Tina had a crush on me. Despite having a boyfriend, she started talking to me more. I told her everything — about Riya, about how I had feelings for her but she doesn’t care about it. I had feared getting emotionally attached because I couldn’t bear the thought of getting hurt again. But Tina was different. She wasn’t like the others.

She was stunned at first. “But you’re the college topper,” she said, “and lots of girls have a crush on you.” I had to reassure her. “It’s not about that. I like you for who you are, Tina.”

And so, we began talking. More and more. What started as casual chats between classes quickly became something deeper. We laughed, joked, spent hours in each other’s company — movies, restaurants, and endless days just being together. She knew sides of me no one else did. She saw beyond the studious, reserved guy everyone else knew. I would even flirt with her in class, teasing her with a glance when the professor wasn’t looking. I’ll admit, those were some of the happiest moments of my life.

But Tina was in a relationship. I never wanted to pressure her. I respected her choices and always told her, “Go where you’ll be happiest. If you’re happy with him, then that’s all I want.” But as time passed, I noticed the cracks in her relationship. They fought often, and I was always there for her, offering a shoulder to lean on. One night, during a coffee shop visit, after one of their many breakups with the same person, Tina looked at me seriously and said, “Rahul (changed name), you’re too good for me. You’ll find someone, and you'll leave but what about me? Where will I go?”

I didn’t have an answer, so I pulled out my phone and jokingly said, “Should I call my dad and tell him I want to marry you?”

She laughed, but there was a trace of sadness in her voice when she replied, “It’s not that simple.”

Despite everything, Tina eventually patched things up with her boyfriend. We stayed close — too close for comfort. We went out, kissed a few times, but the truth was, my feelings for her were growing stronger by the day. Yet, I never wanted to push her away or make her choose. I just wanted to be there for her, even if it meant nothing more than being her friend.

I begged her to at least be my friend. “I’ll move to another city, Tina. You can be with him, and I’ll only visit once a month. But please, don’t go away from my life.” She reluctantly agreed, but it wasn’t enough to stop her from slipping away from me entirely.

The last time I saw Tina was on June 14, 2019. After that, it felt like she was gone for good. But I couldn’t move on. I still loved her. I always would. So, I sent her messages from time to time, hoping to get something, anything. But she would always block me again. The cycle continued

Eventually, after some time apart, Tina started avoiding me more. I couldn’t understand why at first, but as weeks went by, I realized I was losing her. The phone calls became fewer. Arguments started over trivial things.

A few years later, on July 12, 2021, I broke down. I was living away, dealing with my own struggles, and there was no one to talk to. I cried for the thousandth time thinking about her. In a moment of weakness, I asked a friend to pretend to be my girlfriend and message Tina, telling her to leave me alone. That only pushed Tina further away.

I gave up for a while. Until August 10, 2022, when I tried one last time. I was preparing to go to the U.S. for further studies, and I finally had the courage to reach out to her. I told her I was leaving the country, and asked if we could meet. I confessed I had asked my friend to message her in the past, since I don’t have the courage to push you away. She responded with a curt message: “It’s not possible, Rahul.”

And that was it. She was gone again.

When I arrived in the States, I told myself I was done. I needed to focus on my new life. But out of nowhere, we started talking again, like the old days — the same effortless conversations, the same connection. Her words lingered: ""You’re the only one who makes me smile, Rahul,"" and ""I feel more comfortable with you than anyone else."" For a moment, I allowed myself to hope that maybe, just maybe, things could work out.

But soon, our conversations started fading. She pulled away again, and I didn’t press her. I didn’t want to appear desperate, so I let it go, or at least tried to. Then, just before her birthday last year, she blocked me. A friend later told me she had gotten engaged to her boyfriend. My heart sank. 

But when I went back to India last year, I reached out again and despite my best wishes for her, I still asked if we could meet. She refused, and I was left with nothing but a silent, painful goodbye. I sent a smile emoji, deactivated my account

I still think about her every day. The feelings haven’t gone away, even though she’s changed. I can’t forget the way she made me feel. The way she told me I was the only one who could make her smile that way, the way she said she felt more comfortable with me than anyone else.

But what hurts the most is realizing that everything she said was a lie. All the promises, all the reassurances — they meant nothing in the end. She’s moved on, and I’m still here, holding onto the memory of a love that never really was.

I still love her, despite everything. And that’s why I never shared this with anyone, not even her— because I don’t want her to feel bad for how she treated me. I don’t want her to think she did anything wrong. I want to be a part of her life, even if it’s just as a distant friend. I want to be there for her if she ever needs me. I never want to be the bad chapter in her life. And no matter how far apart we drift, the love I feel for her never truly fades.

Thank you for taking the time to read my story and for considering my thoughts and emotions. It means a lot to me. I feel stuck in this past, unable to move on, despite not having seen her for six years. If you have any advice on how to finally let go or if you think I’ve made any mistakes along the way, I’d really appreciate your perspective. I trust my ability to build a future for myself — I’ve just completed my master’s and am working hard towards landing a good job in the States. But I’m still unsure whether I should reach out to her again, especially if she’s not married yet. Do you think there’s a possibility for closure, or am I just holding onto something that’s long gone? Your thoughts would mean a lot to me right now.",1,1735099115.0,AskMenAdvice,1,1.0,False

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Teeth whitening has become a popular choice for many looking to enhance their smiles. The transformation of teeth before and after whitening is often remarkable, and it can significantly boost a person’s confidence. In this article, we'll explore real-life cases that show the dramatic effects of teeth whitening, demonstrating how it can change not just the color of teeth but also the way individuals perceive themselves.

Many people initially approach teeth whitening with a sense of skepticism. They wonder about the effectiveness and safety of the products available. However, testimonials and before-and-after pictures paint a clearer picture. These visual transformations often lead prospective patients to consider teeth whitening seriously.

One of the most striking transformations can be seen from a case involving a young woman named Sarah. Before whitening, Sarah's teeth were a shade of yellow due to years of coffee drinking and smoking. She felt embarrassed to smile and often covered her mouth during conversations. After undergoing a professional whitening treatment, which took about an hour, Sarah saw her smile transform. Her teeth became several shades lighter, showcasing an immaculate white smile. The change impacted not only her self-esteem but also her social interactions, making her feel more confident engaging with others.

In another case, consider John, a 45-year-old man who had been trying over-the-counter teeth whitening strips for years with little success. He was discouraged by the lack of noticeable change. Following consultation with a dentist, John opted for an in-office whitening procedure. The results were impressive. His teeth transformed from a dull yellow to a bright, pearly white. This dramatic change encouraged him to smile more openly, fostering better relationships in both his personal and professional life.

Before proceeding with teeth whitening, it’s crucial to understand the different methods available. Here's a quick overview:

Check The Details Here: https://prodentim.myofferdeals.com  
  
- **In-Office Whitening:** This method offers immediate results, as it's performed by professionals. It often uses stronger bleaching agents and applies special light treatments.
- **At-Home Whitening Kits:** These kits generally provide a less intense whitening effect and require a longer duration for visible results.
- **Whitening Toothpastes:** While these can help remove surface stains, they typically do not lead to significant whitening.

It's also important to consider aftercare for maintaining the newly whitened teeth. Avoiding certain foods and drinks, such as red wine, coffee, and dark berries, can help prolong the whitening effects. Moreover, regular dental check-ups and cleaning will ensure that your smile stays bright and healthy.

Real-life examples further highlight the differences that teeth whitening can make. Take, for instance, a middle-aged woman named Linda. For years, she avoided photos because she was self-conscious about her discolored teeth. After consulting with a dentist and deciding on a professional treatment, Linda's transformation was astonishing. Her teeth, once stained from years of neglect, were now radiant and white. This change not only improved her appearance but also gave her the courage to smile in photos and socialize more. Linda’s story illustrates how much whitening can impact someone’s life.

It's important to remember that results can vary. Factors such as the original tooth color, the type of whitening treatment, and adherence to aftercare tips all contribute to the final outcome. Seeking advice from dental professionals can provide reassurance and ensure that you choose the best method for your needs.

The transformation of teeth before and after whitening is indeed a journey worth exploring. From boosting self-esteem to transforming social interactions, the benefits are undeniable. If you're considering this treatment, take a look at testimonials and visual transformations. You may find inspiration in the stories of others who've undergone this beautiful change.

Factors Influencing the Results of Teeth Whitening Treatments
-------------------------------------------------------------

Teeth whitening treatments have grown in popularity, providing a brighter smile and boosting confidence for many. However, the results can vary from person to person. Understanding the factors that influence these results is essential for achieving the best possible outcome. Here are several key aspects to consider:

### Type of Whitening Treatment

There are numerous teeth whitening options available, including:

Check The Details Here: https://prodentim.myofferdeals.com  
  
- **In-office treatments:** Professional whitening done by a dentist, which typically yields immediate results.
- **At-home kits:** Whitening strips or trays you can use at your convenience; they may take longer to show results.
- **Natural remedies:** Some people opt for DIY methods, like baking soda or activated charcoal, though these can be less effective.

The type of whitening treatment you choose directly influences how much brighter your teeth become. In-office treatments generally offer stronger agents and immediate results, whereas at-home kits might be milder and take more time. Do your research to select the best method for your needs.

### Initial Tooth Color

Your natural tooth color plays a significant role in the final outcome of whitening treatments. If your teeth are naturally darker or have deeper stains, the results might be less dramatic compared to someone with whiter teeth. Factors that can affect your tooth color include:

Check The Details Here: https://prodentim.myofferdeals.com  
  
- Genetics
- Age
- Dietary choices (such as tea, coffee, or red wine consumption)
- Use of tobacco products

Being aware of your starting point helps you set realistic expectations. You may need multiple sessions or a stronger treatment to achieve the desired brightness if your teeth are significantly stained.

### Stain Types

Stains on teeth can be classified into two main categories:

Check The Details Here: https://prodentim.myofferdeals.com  
  
- **Extrinsic stains:** These are surface stains caused by external factors like food, drinks, or smoking. They tend to respond well to whitening treatments.
- **Intrinsic stains:** These are deeper stains that may result from factors like trauma to the teeth, medications, or excessive fluoride. Such stains are often more challenging to treat.

Knowing the type of stains on your teeth can help you choose the most effective treatment. Consult with your dentist to discover the best approach for your specific situation.

### Frequency of Treatment

Over-whitening can lead to adverse effects, such as sensitivity or uneven results. It’s crucial to follow the recommended guidelines of your chosen treatment. Typically, in-office treatments can be done every six months, while at-home whitening can be repeated more frequently, depending on the products used.

Check The Details Here: https://prodentim.myofferdeals.com  
  
### Personal Oral Hygiene

Maintaining good oral hygiene is essential for maximizing whitening results. Brush and floss your teeth regularly and consider using a whitening toothpaste. This will help eliminate plaque buildup, which can dull the brightness of your smile post-treatment.

### Dietary Impact

Your diet influences your teeth's color as well. After whitening, it’s good to avoid foods and drinks that can stain your teeth, especially for the first 24 to 48 hours. Some items to steer clear of include:

Check The Details Here: https://prodentim.myofferdeals.com  
  
- Coffee
- Tea
- Red wine
- Berries
- Dark sauces

These substances can quickly undo the effects of your whitening treatment. Instead, focus on eating crunchy fruits and vegetables that help clean your teeth.

### Expectations and Aftercare

Setting realistic expectations about how white your teeth can become is crucial. Remember, the results can vary significantly, depending on the factors mentioned. Following your treatment, adhering to proper aftercare can prolong your results. This includes regular dental check-ups and touch-up treatments if recommended by your dentist.

Check The Details Here: https://prodentim.myofferdeals.com  
  
The results of teeth whitening treatments can be influenced by numerous factors, including the type of treatment, initial tooth color, and personal habits. By considering these elements, you can take informed steps toward achieving the bright smile you desire. A little knowledge goes a long way in ensuring your teeth remain dazzling and healthy.

### Conclusion

A bright smile can significantly boost your confidence, and the transformation of teeth before and after whitening is a testament to this. Real-life cases showcase the remarkable difference whitening treatments can make, turning dull, discolored teeth into radiant, eye-catching smiles. Many individuals have shared their stories, highlighting how these changes have positively impacted their social interactions and self-esteem.

However, it's crucial to understand that the results of teeth whitening are not solely dependent on the treatment method employed. Various factors come into play, influencing the effectiveness and longevity of the results. Each person's dental health, the type of stains (extrinsic versus intrinsic), and even lifestyle choices, like diet and smoking habits, can sway the outcome. Knowing these factors helps set realistic expectations for your whitening journey and allows for better decision-making when choosing a treatment.

There a man fell to his knees. “I’m tired” the man cried out to the sky as he always had, hoping for a response. A response never came. The ground felt like ice to his weary skin, yet he still felt. He still felt. That would be his last time.



Time moved on without the man, like he never existed. I would tell you his name, but no one remembers it anyway. The sun continued to rise, joggers kept their pace, and the diner sold its terribly overpriced coffee as they always had. The man loved that coffee. He never thought it’d end this way. Face down on the same frigid road his dad taught him to ride a bike on. He thought that maybe he’d teach his son one day. “Maybe on the same road” he thought. That thought quickly faded. That was a common occurrence for the man; fading thoughts. Only the good ones though, The bad thoughts had a habit of lingering.



I think about that man often. I ponder where he is now, or if he’s anywhere for that matter. I wonder about his last moments; what he thought about, who was on his mind. I have a theory that on the brink of death, you discover what truly matters. What did the man discover that day?

As I reached into my pockets , I realized my wallet wasn’t there. My heart sank. I started checking every pocket in my bag, then my coat. Nothing.

I told the cashier I’d forgotten my wallet and would come back. She smiled and said it was fine, but I felt so embarrassed. I left the store quickly, rushing back home

I got home and started searching everywhere—my desk, the kitchen, even under the sofa. Still nothing. I was sure I had it when I left in the morning.

Then I remembered;  I’d used it at the coffee shop earlier.

When I walked in, I went straight to the counter. “Did anyone find a wallet here today?” I asked.

The barista nodded and pulled it out from under the counter. “Someone handed it in earlier. Is this yours?”

'F\*ck Yeah' I thought, as I thanked her

On the way home, I couldn’t stop thinking about how lucky I was. Whoever found it could’ve just kept it, but they didn’t. It reminded me there are good people out there.......... Gotta be less clumsy tho !",5,1735098663.0,PointlessStories,0,1.0,False

1hlt2c7,https://www.reddit.com/r/TotalHipReplacement/comments/1hlt2c7/waiting_on_os/,Waiting on OS,"Good evening all.
I (54M) just found out about 4 months ago from my family Dr. that I need to see an OS about my hips.   I went to see my family dr about some lower back pain I haa been experiencing for 5-6 years.  He asked if I had recent back and hip xrays.   Which I had.   After he pulled them up, he just  blurted out that I need HRS.   Probaby on both.   He said that one is missing 30% and the other is missing 50% of the cartalidge.  To say the least, I was shocked.    LOL

I have since then (late Aug) been waiting for the OS to set an appointment.   I am in West Central Saskatchewan, and so have no idea how long this will take.   And so my thoughts have been running rampent since then.

I have been getting cortisone shots to help with the pain.   80ml per hip.   It does help, but it doesn't last very long.   I can't say I am an active person, but I love to build things for and around the house.   I am a computer programmer, so anything to get out of the chair at the end of the day is always the plan.   They typically last about 6-8 weeks.

My pain level is at about a 7, if using the 0-10 scale in a previous post.   Some days are even higher and some are lower.  Putting on socks seems to be a big deal.   Getting up or sitting down has to be thought out and planned.   And some days, just walking from my home office to anywhere in the house takes courage and determination.  The thing that gets me the most is that the pain level can be different day to day.  or even hour to hour.   I can be fine getting up and going to work.   But an hour later,  just walking to the kitchen to refill my coffee can be painful.   

I am not sure if this is all 'normal' or not.   Never been through this before.   I have a thousand questions and very few answers.   Very few resources to ask prior to the appointment date as well.   I have used ChatGPT to get some but would love to hear more from this group as well.   Just found you all tonight.   LOL  

Is my level of cartalidge loss low, normal or high?   
Is this level conducive to HRS??
What is the probablity of needing both done asap?   Time frame between??   

etc.....

Any comments, suggestions, or input would be greatly apreciated.

Not sure which option is best.","I had it a silicone case, but of course the speakers and the charging port were exposed. I can't tell you how much water got in it or even if any got in, but I don't see how it couldn't have and the case had water inside I think I may have dabbed it after I grabbed it. I tried to keep it level after I grabbed it off the counter and set it aside, but it was tilted down a bit. 

Yes, I did the stupid thing when I took the case off I dried it and put it in rice until I read that doesn't work. I took it out, sprayed it with some canned air to get any rice dust out of the holes in the port. Now it's turned off just sitting here on the coffee table, screen side up.

It's only been a few hours, so it's absolutely too soon to tell if there's any water damage or if I got lucky. Considering the fact that my entire kitchen flooded for an unknown reason then I'm gonna have to say I might be in trouble. I  just bought it in May.

Options:
1. I have AppleCare+, but I don't know if they're just gonna send me a refurbished one that will last me a year before it starts glitching.

2. Turn it in to homeowners insurance, but will they also just give me a refurbished one that will last me a year before it starts glitching?

3. Wait it out to see if it starts glitching. Issue with waiting is that I don't know how long it will take to start showing signs of water damage and I also don't know how long I have to turn it into homeowners insurance or AppleCare+ if when it glitching since I was aware of the possibility of water damage.

We do not have an Apple Store here where I live. I'm not even aware of a place I can take it for them to check it out. It's VERY important that I have a well working and reliable iPad and I do not have the money to buy another one.

The backstory:

For most of my adult life, I've always been a little overweight, anywhere from 10-25 pounds on the heavier side of ""normal"" depending on various factors.  About 12-15  years ago, I really decided to get myself healthy. I quit smoking, joined a gym, decreased my drinking and made a conservative effort to eat health(ier). Since it was just my wife and I, it wasn't very difficult to focus on ourselves and keep moderately healthy, and I felt pretty good most of the time.

About 10 years ago, we were blessed with our  daughter, which of course changed our routine a bit. I was still able to maintain some similance of a healthy lifestyle, but it took some time to get back to a routine after her birth. 8 years ago, we were blessed with our son, and as most of you could guess, it got a little tougher to exercise and we had to give up a healthier lifestyle to keep up as two working parents raising two youngsters.

About 3 years ago, I took a new job that was 100% administrative, so my days of doing any physical activity at work came to a screeching halt and I gave up my fairly active career for a desk job. My new schedule is supposed to be 9-5, except that it is never 9-5; it changes day to day, but no matter what, the moment I step foot into my house, it's all family/home life occupying all of my time until 9 pm, which is usually when I finally get a moment to unwind. The only way I unwind is to pour a big glass of something, be it wine, bourbon, vodka or gin, and then ultimately fall asleep at 11, then repeat the next day and the next. It's rare that I get a weekend off, but when I do, I try to do a little yard work or house work, and assuming the kids don't have some random activity, we try to find one small activity to do as a family. We usually fail at it because my wife and I are usually just completely wiped out from the week and we just spend the day in the house doing very little.

My daily routine is that I get up at 5:45 am, have coffee and then get the kids ready for school and out the door at 715am. I usually get back home around 745am and have about 45 minutes to eat, shower and head to work. My usual breakfast is two eggs, a meat (like bacon, ham or maybe an occasional small piece of leftover steak) and either toast or granola+yogurt with coffee. When I get to work, I'll have another cup or two of coffee mid morning, and unless I have a moment, I typically skip lunch since I don't normally have time to step away and I'm really bad at bringing lunch to work. When I get home, I basically go strait into dinner mode after some light housekeeping and spend the next 2 hours cooking and cleaning. Dinner usually consist of a meat, a veggie or two and a bread of some sort. The kids have a treat and my treat is a cocktail of some sort. After we put them to bed, I'll finish up whatever cleaning needs to happen and go right to the couch with a pretty heavy pour of something and try to get to bed by 11pm.

That's my life now... I have no time for anything for me. It's home, work, home and repeat. I have no time to exercise and have no time to really take care of myself. I know I need to cut out alcohol, but it's the only ""me"" thing I have left in my life and I'm trying to mentally prepare myself for the inevitable sobriety that needs to happen
 Even if I cut that out, I still have no time to do anything of the things I need to do to shed these pounds. I'm now at 265 pounds and I want to get back to at least 240. I miss exercising and I can't make time for it. I hate that I can't find time to prep healthy meals. I hate that I'm spiraling into becoming a functioning alcoholic.

Anyone have some advice on how someone who's about to turn 50, hasnt excersiced in almost 3 years and has a completely boring desk job can start the journey back to being healthy?

I had stopped for a few months and have been on and off.  There is no doubt how much it amplifies any anxiety I may have.  I work as a car salesman so coffee is always plentiful and essentially a right of passage.  

Couple days ago the ruminating was cranked to 11 and I decided enough was enough.  I know how great I felt off caffine before so it was time.

One thing that really helps me is taking b1 ( Benfotamine) and magnesium.  The 1st day headache was there but manageable.  

I already feel so much better.  The addiction to caffine is real and now it's time to heal for good.

Also doing OMAD for fasting because they say fasting helps reset dopamine receptors.  And ...so far so good.  ",2,1735097261.0,decaf,0,1.0,False

Hello everyone! I’m planning my first trip to Kyoto from 12/31 to 1/4 and just found out that many places might be closed around New Year’s. I’d love any recommendations you have about:

	1.	Special Events at Shrines/Temples:
I’ve heard there are unique ceremonies or traditions during this period. Any must-sees or tips for a memorable New Year’s Eve/Day experience?


	2.	Places That Stay Open:
With many shops and restaurants closed, which areas or specific places are more likely to be open during the holidays?

I’m a big café fan, but don’t mind chain restaurants or coffee shops like % Arabica and Blue Bottle. Any suggestions on chains or local favorites that remain open?

Thanks a ton in advance! Any insight about New Year’s in Kyoto would be greatly appreciated. Happy holidays and よろしくお願いします!",2,1735096143.0,JapanTravelTips,0,1.0,False

I spend most of my days at home hanging out with the cats, one of whom loves to play fetch. I've loved art ever since I was very young. Right now I've been playing around with some watercolors. I have big ambitions to have my own graphic design gig some day, but right now I don't currently work.

I love video games. I got a lot to play on. PS5, Xbox One, Switch, Meta Quest 2, and my iPad. So, like, pretty much everything but PC 😅 I'm a achievements/trophy hunter. I also collect PS1 & 2 games to play on my PlayStation 2. In recent years I've been very casual with my gaming, playing a lot of platformers and survival/crafting games. I'll play a bit of everthing, though, except for, like, sports games.

I love tabletop games. Star Wars Legion, Warhammer 40K/AoS, Magic: The Gathering, Pokémon TCG, Digimon TCG, Lorcana, and Star Wars Unlimited. I love to paint miniatures as well, but it's a bit of a struggle to actually get people to play with me. Never really gotten the chance to play an TTRPG, but would love to. I suffer from a bit of learning curve. Certified dyslexic.

I love music. Dance Gavin Dance, Papa Roach, Twenty-One Pilots, A Day To Remember, stuff like that. Bit of an elder emo. I wish I could play an instrument, but I fear I may be tone deaf 🙃

I love Marvel. Spider-Man's probably my favorite.

I love Harry Potter. Pretty sure my house is Hufflepuff.

Huge fan of The Office. I've seen the whole series countless times.

I love horror movies and got into true crime on YouTube few years ago. My favorite horror movie is The Blair Witch Project, second to the 2003 Texas Chainsaw Massacre.

I love anime and manga. Demon Slayer is by far my favorite. I also really love Fullmetal Alchemist, Attack on Titan, Digimon, Dragon Ball, Dandadan, and Sword Art Online.

I'm doin' the Japanese, Spanish, and music courses on Duolingo right now.

I love baking, coffee, and grilling. I don't have too much confidence in my cooking skills 😅 But I'm trying new recipes all the time. I'm rather adept at baking though, and I love smoked meats 🤤

I needed a simple app to manually track and manage my spending, including credit card payments, bank transfers, and cash expenses. Manually recording expenses helps me stay aware of my spending habits and manage them effectively. This led me to launch the Money Keeper app in July. 🚀✨

Thanks to the incredible feedback from many of you, I’ve been working on updates based on your suggestions. Recently, I added a much-requested feature: the ability to set the calendar start day based on your payday 📆. Your continued support and feedback mean the world to me! 👍

\---

# 💡 What is Money Keeper?

\- An app that lets you view your income and expenses at a glance on a monthly basis.

\- Manage regular expenses and recurring (fixed) expenses separately.

\- Set the calendar by payday.

\- Supports iPhone, iPad, and Mac apps with fast synchronization ⚡️

\- Monthly Summary: Visualizes your expenses.

\- Ability to create and customize expense and income categories.

\- Simplicity that allows you to focus solely on managing expenses.

\- Free with limited features. Supports a reasonably priced one-time membership for full features.

\- No ads, no data collection.

\---

The app is still in its early stages, and there’s plenty of room for improvement. However, I’m committed to developing it with the help of users like you, to make it a useful tool for those looking to manage their expenses manually. 👍

I’m carefully recording all the feedback I receive and using it to gradually add new features. If you give it a try and have any suggestions, feel free to leave a comment 💬.

A huge thank-you to everyone who’s started using Money Keeper to manage your spending. I hope you stay healthy 💪 and have a wonderful holiday season 🎄✨.

This was all happening alongside gut issues, acid reflux, bloating/belching, and lightheadedness. My main symptoms were tachycardia (which I've never experienced before) and heart palps. All my stats were normal aside from my elevated HR (95), EKG, and Blood Panel including Thyroid, Electrolytes, and Tropinin.

My ER doctor said that he had also gone to the ER for GERD and thought he was having a heart attack. I was prescribed Famotidine and Prilosec. 

I used to be a coffee/caffeine addict, so I've pretty much cut all of that out. It seems like my gut is irritated because I went from being able to eat whatever to now, and it seems like everything irritates my stomach.

1hlsg97,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1hlsg97,First time at Vail & Beaver Creek! (Detailed trip report),"Spent the last 4 days skiing at Vail and Beaver Creek and just wanted to share how amazing it has been. Wish we weren’t leaving so soon but also kind of glad we’ll be getting out before the Christmas crowds arrive. Hope this trip report helps other people who are visiting as tourists!

**Lodging**
We stayed at an Airbnb in Silverthorne (about 30-40 minutes to Vail and 50 minutes to Beaver Creek). The drive is pretty scenic so it wasn’t too bad doing it everyday, and we saved a lot of money. 

**Parking**
We opted to park at Lionshead Garage ($40), and Ford Garage ($50) on two of the days when we carpooled with other people. Then for the other two we went with Red Sandstone Garage ($20) in Vail, and Bear Lot ($13), when it was just the two of us. Generally arrived around 9am and had no issue finding a parking spot, in fact there were still plenty of spaces.

**The Villages**
Both Vail and Beaver Creek are modeled after European ski towns so it’s pretty quaint and romantic. They are super bougie, decorated for Christmas. 

Vail has two mini towns, the Lionshead one is smaller and main Vail one is bigger (but honestly both are not very big.) Recommend checking them both out, but if you only have time for one the main Vail Village is nicer. 

Beaver Creek village was smaller than Vail but it’s situated within a massive gated “country club”-like area that has multiple bases like Ritz Carleton, Riverfront Resort, and other resort neighborhoods. There are escalators to get around the Beaver Creek village, which is the first I’ve seen at a ski resort. It feels a step more fancy than Vail. There are fire pits everywhere with cushy seating. 

There isn’t that much to do in the towns, you could probably finish walking around and checking out the shops within 1 hour, then do apres-ski. Food in the villages is expensive, but there are some nice deals to be found! (More on food at the end of the report)

**The Mountains**
We were lucky with sunny bluebird days so the views were gorgeous and the sun helped soften up the snow a bit. We got 2-3 inches of fresh snow one night and the next day was amazing!

Vail had a lot of catwalks. It’s very wide and spread out, there’s a frontside and also several backside bowls. Easy to get lost and it takes quite some time to traverse back and forth to different areas. Overall there’s a good mix of intermediate and advanced terrain. On one of the days we joined a free Mountain Tour which was really fun! They showed us how to get across the mountain and avoid lift lines, and shared the backstory behind several of the trails. We also stopped by Legacy Hut to learn about Vail’s history and send some postcards for free. 

Beaver Creek has the most beautiful views. It is much more beginner friendly - noticed more kids and ski school folks. Lots of chill green runs near the top of the mountian so you can cruise and enjoy the views. McCoy Park was amazing on the powder day… 

Both resorts were generally pretty empty in the early morning but started to get a little crowded around 11am, and then more so later in the afternoon. Even when it got “crowded” we didn’t wait longer than 5-10 minutes at any of the lifts. And most of the runs are very wide anyways. 

**The Food**
Lots of food options in Vail were Swiss or Austrian or German style food. Also quite a few Italian restaurants. Very high prices, so we did a mix of packing our own lunch and buying food at the resort, and also cooked some meals at the Airbnb. Lunch is around $15-$20 (for a burger or hot dog), dinner in a restaurant is around $50-$75 per person. 

**Food review:**
- The Blu Cow: Swiss hot dogs, kinda pricey for a hot dog ($17) but was tasty
- Vail Brewing Company: We got lucky and snagged seats by the fire pit overlooking the ice rink, so it was a nice spot for apres-ski 
- Almresi Vail: Cozy atmosphere, maybe a little too kitschy but it’s nice for Christmas. Had cheese fondue, schnitzel, pork loin, & rosti. All the food was delicious!
- Mamie’s Mountain Grill: Amazing views and outdoor dining on a sunny day. They serve Pretzel bun hot dogs. Again it was around $15 for a hot dog, but by now we were used to the high prices. 
- Cookie Time at Beaver Creek: At 3pm Beaver Creek gives out free chocolate chip cookies at the base of the mountain. Look for the crowd of people waiting next to Powder 8 Kitchen & Tap. The cookie is just average, but it’s a cool tradition and free food is always nice!
- Aritza: Spanish tapas, live music, and with happy hour 50% cocktails and tapas it was not too expensive. The Hot Toddy was so delicious (it’s hot whiskey with lemon honey and cinnamon). Paella was great too. 
- Blue Moose Pizza: Got a slice of the Vintage pizza which has roasted red peppers and meatball. By far the best tasting “cheap” eat at $6 for a slice. 
- The One Sushi and Ramen (Silverthorne): Sushi rolls pretty good, ramen was average. 
- Red Buffalo Coffee & Tea (Silverthorne): Salmon bagel was really good, as was the coffee.

1hlsfsp,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/1hlsfsp/date_asking_me_intrusive_questions_about_my/,Date asking me intrusive questions about my hearing aid. Should I continue to see her?,"I (35 year old male dentist)went on this one date with this 34 year old pharmacist. We went out on 1 date at a coffee shop. It went well and it was about 1 hour.

Some background. I do have a hearing disability (severe hearing loss in one ear) since childhood. Probably was born with it. My parents didn't know until I was around 5 years old which is when I started wearing a hearing aid.

On first date, I did bring it up about my hearing aid which she seemed okay with. However, after the 1st date and we talked on the phone next day, my date asked me some bizarre questions such as:  ""Have you ever had genetic testing done?"" , ""Any relatives with hearing issues?"", ""Have you ever been bullied in childhood due to your hearing aid?"", ""If someone were to present a word on a piece of paper to you, can you speak the written word?"". I kinda stumbled to these questions and felt kinda annoyed.  Especially the last question. I mean, I am a dentist after all, I know how to say words from a piece of paper, lol. I understand women are going to be curious and ask questions but I felt these kinds of specific questions were improper.

Should I bother seeing her again or give her a chance? It just comes off she may lack kindness/empathy over a superficial thing and somewhat neurotic about it.  What do you think?",0,1735095689.0,dating_advice,6,0.5,False

1hlse17,https://www.reddit.com/r/gravesdisease/comments/1hlse17/hello_i_need_some_advicehelp_3/,Hello I need some advice/help <3,"So I met up with my endo beginning of December on the 5th, before I met her I was taking meth and propanolol 3 times a day 10mg each my primary doctor instructed me to do. Once i met up with my endo she told me to take all 3 meth and all 3 propanolol at once and ever since then I'v felt like death. Went to the ER on the 7th because I was scared, luckily she got back to me the next day and told me to wait about a week to start taking my medication again and told me to take 1 of each at 10mg once a day but ever since I never felt the same. Wake up with anxiety, hot flashes on and off all day, dizzy, nauseas. She also told me she didnt tell me to take all 3 propanolol at once even though my mom was there for support and heard her say to take all 3 at once as well. I see her next Friday but idk if i should see her again and get a new endo even though that process takes forever. Also to note I quit smoking cigs ( I rolled my own tobacco) so im thinking a lot of my symptoms are coming from detoxing as well. Its been about 2 weeks of quitting tobacco. I was able to smoke, drink coffee, smoke weed, walk my dog no problem before i met her and now I'm in constant anxiety.",2,1735095500.0,gravesdisease,0,1.0,False
1hlsdov,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1hlsdov/dont_turn_dont_look_dont_think_just_focus/,Don’t turn. Don’t look. Don’t think. Just focus. ,"*Marty. This is all about focus.* 

*Think about Alice. Keep driving. Eyes on the road.* 

*The hitchhikers will step out eventually. They always do.* 

*Just don’t look back at them. Don’t ever look back.*

*Don’t think, just drive.* 

—-----------------------------------

I have a lot of love for my parents, having the generosity to take Alice and me in after her leukemia relapsed, but goddamn do they live far from civilization. Or maybe there just ain’t a lot of civilization in Idaho to go around - not in a bad way; the quiet is nice. I’ve been enjoying the countryside more than I anticipated. That being said, they could stand to spend some taxpayer dollars on a few more Walgreens locations. 

Feels like I’ve been driving all night; must almost be morning. They have to be worried sick. Alice may actually be physically sick without her antinausea meds.

I shook my head side to side in a mix of disbelief and self-flagellating shame. Took a left turn when I should have taken a right - a downright boneheaded mistake. The price for overworking myself, but I mean, what other option do I have? Chemotherapy ain’t exactly cheap. 

For a moment, I forgot where I was and what I was doing. Accidentally looked in my rearview mirror at the five hitchhikers in the backseats. Silent and staring forward with dead and empty eyes at nothing in particular.

Furiously, my eyes snapped forward, not wanting to linger too long on them - wasn’t sure what else I’d see. 

Can’t be doing that on this road. Maintaining focus is key. 

—-----------------------------------

Despite my near-instantaneous reaction, I did see the new hitchhikers, but only for a moment. No surprises this time, thankfully. They wore suits like all the others, monocolored with earthy tones from head to toe. Same odd fabric, too - rough and coarse-looking, almost like leather. Honestly, never seen anything like it before tonight. 

But I haven’t ever been in a situation like this before, either. Whatever backwoods county I got myself turned around in, it likes to follow its own rules. 

For example, I didn’t pull over to pick up these hitchhikers. Somehow, they just found their way in. Or maybe I did pull over and let them in? Been so tired lately; who could even be sure. They don’t say much, no matter how many questions I ask. Would love to know where I am, but I guess it isn’t for them to say.

My gaze again drifted, this time from the road to the car’s dashboard, and I let myself see the time. Big mistake.

7:59PM.

Nope, that ain’t right. I rapidly blinked a few times, adjusted myself so I was sitting up straighter, and then looked back to the clock again.

Now, it didn’t show any time at all. 

*Marty, Jesus. Focus up.* 

I blinked once more, this time for longer. Not sure how long I was blinking, couldn’t have been longer than ten seconds. 

If I close my eyes for too long, they become hard to open again. Requires a lot of energy. Anxiously, I peered back at the dashboard for a third time.

4:45AM. 

See, there we go. Now *that* makes sense. By the time dawn arrives, I’m sure I will have found a gas station to pull over in. Ask for directions back to…whatever my parent’s address is. I’ll figure that out later, right now I need to focus. 

—-----------------------------------

Funny things happened in this part of the country when you didn’t focus. Sometimes, the yellow pavement markings would change colors, or disappear entirely. Other times, the road itself would start to look off - black asphalt turning to muddy brownstone at a moment’s notice. 

At first, it scared me. Scared me a lot, come to think of it. Made me want to pull over and close my eyes.

But Alice needed her nausea meds, and judging by the time, I had work in two short hours. I needed to make it home soon so I can check on her, give her a kiss before school. Hopefully, I’ll have time to brew a pot of coffee, too. 

My eyes, though - they just don’t seem to want to stick with the program. Dancing around from thing to thing like they don’t have a care in the world. 

They have one job: watch the road for places that might have a map or someone who can tell me where I am. Well, two jobs. Watch the road *and* focus on the road. 

At least it wasn’t treacherous. The path has been pretty much straight after the wrong turn. 

—-----------------------------------

Initially, Alice was nervous about starting at her new school. And I get it - that transition is hard enough without factoring in everything she has had to manage in her short life. We’d been lucky though, finding a well-reviewed sign language school - in Idaho, of all places.  

She’s amazing - you’d think that the leukemia and the deafness from her first go with chemotherapy would have crushed her spirit. Not my Alice. She’s tough as nails. Tough as nails like her dad. 

I smiled, basking in a moment of fatherly pride. Of course, you can’t be doing that on this road. You’ll start to see things you don’t want to see. 

When my eyes again met the rearview mirror, I noticed there was now only one hitchhiker now, but he had transformed and revealed his real shape.

His face was flat like a manhole cover, almost the size of a manhole cover, too, but less circular - more oblong. He was staring at me with one bulging eye. It was the only one he had, the only one I could see at least. No other recognizable facial features. Just the one, bloated, soulless eye. 

What’s worse, I saw what was behind him. Behind the car, I mean. 

I closed my eyes as soon as I could, but my mind was already rapidly reviewing and trying to reconcile what I had seen behind the car. There was a wall a few car lengths away. No road to be seen, just an inclined wall with tire tracks on it. The atmosphere behind me had a weird thickness to it. Lightrays shone through the thickness unnaturally from someplace above. The ground looked like dust, or maybe sand, why would the ground look like -  

*FOCUS. Think of Alice, and focus*

When I finally found the courage to open my eyes, it all looked right again, and I breathed a sigh of relief and chuckled to myself from behind the wheel. Straight road in front of me, framed by a starless black sky. Everything in its right place. Until I saw something snaking its way into my peripheral vision. 

The hitchhiker was now in the passenger’s seat.

He turned to me and leaned his body forward over the stickshift; his lips were pursed and nearly pressing against my ears, rhythmically opening and closing his mouth but making no sound. I could have sworn he was close enough to touch my ear with his lips, but I guess he wasn't because I couldn’t feel it. Instead, I felt my heartbeat start to race, or I imagined what it was like to feel your heartbeat race. 

Why did I have to imagine...?

*Don’t turn. Don’t look. Don’t think. Just focus.* 

But I couldn’t. Something was wrong. I thought about closing my eyes. For a while, not just for a little. To see what would happen. I was curious what would happen. Had been all night, actually.

But then, like the angel she was, Alice’s visage appeared on the horizon. She was standing at her second-story window in my parent’s home, watching and waiting for me to return from this long night. I wasn’t getting closer for some reason, but she wasn’t getting any further away either. 

She was far, but even at that distance, I could see her doing something in the window. When I squinted, it looked like maybe she was waving.

Alice was waving at me. Alice could see me.

Must mean I'm close.

*Eyes on the road. Focus*

—-----------------------------------

Every night around 8PM, Alice would stand and watch the road from her bedroom on the second story of her grandparents' home. What she was waiting for didn’t happen as often anymore, but her birthday was a week away - the phenomenon seemed to be more frequent around her birthday. As the clock ticked into 8:03PM, she saw a familiar sight - two faint luminescent orbs traveled slowly down the deserted road in her direction, creating even fainter cylinders of light in front of them. 

Like headlights from an approaching car.

The first time this happened, Alice was nine. To cope with her father's disappearance, she would watch the road at night and pretend she saw his car returning home. One night, she saw balls of light appear in the distance, and it made hope explode through her body like fireworks. 

The balls of light turned into the driveway. And when they did, Alice noticed something that made hope mutate into fear and confusion.

The headlights had no car attached, dissolving without a trace within seconds of their arrival.

For months, this was a nightly occurrence, and only she could see it, which scared Alice. But when she formally explained to the phenomenon to her grandfather for the first time, how they looked like headlights without a car, a weak and bittersweet grin appeared on his face, and he carefully brought up his hands to sign to her:

*I’d bet good money that’s Marty making his way home, sweetheart. He just loved you that much.*

From then on, the orbs comforted Alice and made her feel deeply connected with her long-lost father, wherever he was. But in the present, at the age of nearly seventeen, she had modified the purpose of her vigil.

Originally, she liked the idea of her father’s endless search for her. It made her feel less alone. But as she lived life and matured, she realized how alone he must be looking for her from where he was. Now, all she wanted was for Marty to stop looking. She wanted her father to finally rest. 

Now, when the orbs passed by, she would sign to them from her window, desperately hopeful that even from where he was he could see her hands move, communicating an important message to him:

*I love you, and I miss you. But please, Dad, let go.*",6,1735095460.0,nosleep,0,1.0,False

Grew up with a gambling addict dad who provided the bare minimum financial support to ensure I had food and shelter. Spent most of his money gambling but occasionally pitched in to buy video games or something. Other than that I don't recall him teaching me much or spending time with my brother and I except taking us to the racetrack where he gambled or the local coffee shop where we inhaled tons of second hand smoke while he read his newspaper.

After my mom passed and my son was born seven years ago (my son was born 6 months before my mom passed), my relationship with my dad became quite strained as I saw how he treated my mom in her dying days. He said mean things and didn't value her in my eyes. Maybe he couldn't cope properly but it was still outwardly rude to me. I adored my mom as she was a saint who would help everyone, work 10 hours and come home to cook and try and teach us what she could.

Back to the point - after I became a dad myself I realized how much I wanted to do for my son. It made me realize as well how little my dad tried to do for us - despite having the potential financial means (he made decent money just didn't use it on us). To top it off, my son is now 7 and he's never asked to come see him unless I invite him over for holiday events and get togethers with my in laws (much more ""normal"" nuclear family).

It was Christmas Eve in the small town of Evergreen. The snow was falling gently, casting a serene silence over the quiet streets. But amidst the joy and festivities, a sense of unease settled over the residents of Evergreen.

For Emily, a young girl who lived in a small house on Elm Street, Christmas was a time of wonder and excitement. She loved decorating the tree, making cookies, and singing carols with her family.

But this year, Emily's family had received a strange gift. A mysterious package had arrived at their doorstep, wrapped in black paper and tied with a crimson ribbon. There was no note, no card, just a small, ornate box with a strange symbol etched onto its lid.

As Emily's family gathered around the tree to open their gifts, they couldn't help but feel a sense of trepidation. Something about the box seemed off, seemed... evil.

But Emily's curiosity got the better of her. She picked up the box and examined it closely. As she did, she felt a sudden chill run down her spine.

Suddenly, the lights on the tree began to flicker, and the room was filled with an eerie, pulsing glow. Emily's family tried to scream, but their voices were frozen in their throats.

And then, the box opened.

A dark, swirling mist poured out of the box, filling the room with an unspeakable horror. Emily's family was consumed by the mist, their bodies contorting in ways that were not humanly possible.

As the mist cleared, Emily was left standing alone, her eyes frozen in terror. She stumbled backward, tripping over her own feet.

As she fell, she saw a figure standing in the corner of the room. It was Santa Claus, but not as she had ever seen him before. His eyes glowed with an otherworldly light, and his smile was twisted into a grotesque grin.

""Merry Christmas, Emily,"" he said, his voice dripping with malevolence.

And with that, the room went black.

The next morning, the police found Emily's house abandoned, the front door wide open. The only sign of life was a small, ornate box on the coffee table, wrapped in black paper and tied with a crimson ribbon.

The symbol on the lid seemed to pulse with a malevolent energy, as if it was waiting for its next victim.

The people of Evergreen whispered about the strange occurrence, about the dark side of Christmas that had consumed Emily's family. They knew that some secrets were better left unspoken, and that some horrors were too terrible to be revealed.

And so, the town of Evergreen kept its secrets, locked away in the darkness of the Christmas season. But the legend of the cursed box lived on, a cautionary tale about the horrors that lurked in the shadows of the holiday season.",1,1735094678.0,Horror_stories,0,1.0,False

1hlryt0,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPDlovedones/comments/1hlryt0/giddy_up_for_a_long_post/,Giddy up for a long post.,"Here I am; almost ten years into a relationship with a man. Feeling unfulfilled, unloved, needing something more, and I suggest us finding a third. He says yes, no problems there, we trust each other and we have no issues. 

I start talking to this cute girl, she’s well aware I have a boyfriend. She’s saying all the right things. Doing all the right things. Making me feel like I own the entire world and nothing can stop me. We talk about how we were looking for a third, she says she totally down, she just feels like it would take her more time to get comfortable with the boyfriend than with me. I’m like okay yeah that’s totally cool. 

A couple weeks turns into a month, we have sex for the first time without my ten year partner. She is still saying and doing all the right things, always showing up for me, making sure I’m good, bringing me coffee, buying me lunch, bringing me cards, etc.  then she tells me, she’s not okay with the boyfriend. She doesn’t want any part of that. I’m like okay, well I’ll talk to the boyfriend and see how he feels about me having a girlfriend and see if she changes her mind later (dumb of me, I know idk why I thought that) but she came into this knowing I had a boyfriend and he wasn’t going anywhere. 

So, she starts making up issues with my boyfriend. Saying he’s inconsiderate and he doesn’t treat me well, etc etc. which, the second part was a lie but she kept saying he wasn’t intentionally doing things to piss her off. So, she decides to break up with me. I’m distraught. This is the best I’ve been treated in 5 years, right? I’m in shambles. I’m saying “you said you’d never make me choose” blah blah blah. We don’t talk for a few days, and then we end up talking and getting back together a few days later. A week or two goes by and she does it again. 

Now, I’m over here thinking… well she’s right, my boyfriend doesn’t treat me well, why would I stay with him? When I could just be happy with her?? So her and I talked and I decided that I was going to leave him. So I told him I was done. But again, she became insecure and broke up with me again… and said she was done talking to me. So I decided to make it work with my boyfriend. She decided to tell me “I knew you would do this the whole time, that’s why I ended things.” So I just stopped talking to her. 

But I started missing her so much, missing that feeling. Yall know the feeling. The fucking feeling of being so in love it’s intoxicating. Idk how they do it. And the next part I TAKE FULL ACCOUNTABILITY FOR!! I went out of town with my best friend and came back and immediately had to work, after work instead of going home to my boyfriend, I went to her house… I cheated on my boyfriend. I KNOW IM A POS for it. Spare me please. I told my boyfriend, and he ofc wants to separate. I do not blame him. She wants to get back together, but as we’ve talked about many of times, we just don’t work. My boyfriend and I decided we were going to work it out, but he kept accusing me of things I wasn’t doing. I couldn’t handle it anymore, so I told him I thought we should split up. 

She messaged me saying ALL the right things again, and I told her that I wanted to just be friends and take things slow, I told her that I wanted to go with the flow and see how things went. And she agreed that that would be best for us. We ended up messing around, nothing crazy, but still maintaining those boundaries. She kept saying she wanted to get things right this time. She was going to give me time to grieve my ten year relationship and be easy on me, then the next day, she was cold to me. 

I asked her if she was okay and she said yeah she just had a long conversation with her friend. I asked her how that went and she said that they decided that they were going to be together…. I was shocked… what happened to her only loving me? Me being the love of her life? She can’t live without me? What happened to that? 

I know that it’s just how things are, I’m processing things each and every day, but it still hurts. Every day. 

In between all these times she’s getting me cards telling me how much she loves me, getting me gifts, talking to me, remembering little things I tell her. But the longer we’re together the more she stops asking about me and only talking about herself. I should’ve noticed the red flags. But I was so happy feeling something other than alone I just couldn’t think straight. Point of the post is to say, I’m 3 days no contact, I’m sad, I’m mad, I’m hurt, one minute I want to freak out, the next I want to reach out, the next I’m telling myself it’s going to be a repetitive cycle.

I just don't have it in me to write up the whole thing rn. I'm in my 50s and about at the end of my rope with insomnia issues. It has ruined my career and my financial situation. Lack of sleep is aging my body and my mind. 

I currently take alprazalom at night to sleep. I don't get supremely restful sleep but it's better than nightmares, anxiety, and no sleep. I've tried many (a dozen and a half or so) other meds over the years. The only ones I've been able to take with any success are Valium and alprazalomalprazalom. I hate that my entire life is ruled by the fact that I have to take sleep meds and go to sleep early so I can get up and function for work. Very little flexibility in my sleep schedule. Anyway, I'm sure that I'm far from the only one here that feels this way so here is my actual question.

Typically, if I wake up really early, I end up eventually just getting up, making coffee, sitting on my meditation cushion until it's time to function. Every once in a while, I put in my earbuds and fall back to sleep listening to some yoga nidra or meditation music. It never fails, though, that I feel even more exhausted when I wake up again and hour or two later. I end up basically non-functional, as I do if I forget to take my sleep meds. It happened this morning. I was just too tired to get up at 4am today so went back to sleep to some yoga nidra. Spent all day watching re-runs, with chest pains and feeling like absolute crap. I had things to do! If it was a work day, I'd have had to call in sick.

Generally, I believe that I get my deepest sleep in the early morning because I often feel that when I wake up between 3 and 5 that I’m being pulled out of a dreamdream. Not sure if that matters. Just mentioning it in case it is a factor. 

Does this happen to anyone else? Why do I feel worse for having gone back to sleep??

1hlrqur,https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueOffMyChest/comments/1hlrqur/i_hate_my_sister_and_my_mom/,I hate my sister and my mom,"I 21f hate my older sister 24f so much. I never thought I'd say that but I don't think she'll ever change and I simply can't deal with it anymore.
My sister and I grew up getting beat by our mom who is of african descent and thinks beating your kids is perfectly fine if they ""deserve"" it. Problem was we always ""deserved"" it. Especially me.
I proved to be the ""problematic"" one while my sister seemed more proper and put together, both mentally and physically.
This is also a reason why as we got older, she distanced herself more and more until she eventually moved out to college. She hated my hygiene habits as a teen because I wouldnt really shower due to trauma and depression. I wet the bed until I moved out to college where the bed wetting miraculously stopped but often times when it happened as a teen, I would just put my clothes on and go to school. As a kid I would also often pee in weird places without any real reasoning behind it. My teeth were also often unbrushed and my hair unkempt. This is another reason my mom would beat me.
Until I went to therapy I never realised where these habits may come from and that it might not all be my fault. Maybe I'm not the monster they say I am. Maybe I wasn't born like this. Maybe locking both your kids up in a room with only a bucket as the toilet might fuck them up, at least one of. Maybe instead of beating your kids, it might just be your responsibility as a parent to help them to do things like brush their teeth instead of just saying ""6 is old enough, there's no reason you shouldn't do it by yourself"". 
Maybe a parent should be patient with their children instead of beating them every time they don't get things right. Kids don't get things right all the time. Whether I'm 6 or 16, surely I deserve a fair chance at living a good life, instead  of giving up on me before I ever reached 10.

The funny thing is, I always defended my mom at therapy before I would talk about the things she would do. I would talk about how life couldn't have been easy for her either being that she comes from a developing country and that things are different there.  
I would talk about how hard she worked to bring money home. I would talk about how she juggled college and kids and how I feel for her in retrospect.
But now I finally realise that none of it is an excuse.
Especially being that the reason she locked us in a room with a bucket as the toilet was because she thought my dad was molesting us. But now I ask myself, what kind of mother wouldn't leave? Instead, she chastised us, beating us into making statements about things I'm not even sure really ever happened like that.

What we call home has always been a warzone. After we caught my dad cheating, my mom used us as instruments against him. She would get my sister to hack into his email and as time passed, they seemed to gather lots of evidence of his double life. Online, he's a bisexual male who likes to crossdress and do...things...many....things with other men. 
As much as this should've shocked me, I hated being in the middle of all of it more than I hated my dad cheating on my mom. Especially because no matter what he does in his own time, he's never beaten me and always listened to me cry to him about all the things my mom would say and do to me.
I'm not saying he's perfect, let alone any better because by staying in that relationship he put us in harms way but that's not what this is about. I'm also pretty sure my dad is mentally very unwell but again, that's a whole other hay ride.

Before we were even born, my dad and grandad built the house my parents and my grandad live in, but back in the day they were always in legal battles with eachother over money so they thought the best decision was finding neutral ground -which back then was my sister.
And so, they ended up putting the house in her name so that none of them can have it. The idea was that she'd surely give me half as soon as she turns 18.

 

Fast forward to Saturday: I hadn't seen her in a year so my mom and I went to visit her and after a nice evening together, I decided to ask her if I can have her old room as it's 

1) being used for storage, there's already another room that has been prepared for her if she ever decides to come home: spoiler- she doesn't come home

2) she got the bigger one because she's older. It also has a garden door which would come in clutch for me as I have a dog whom that door would be handy for, and with my boyfriend joining me often when I come home on weekends, a bigger room would be really nice because we're cramped.

3) She. doesn't.come. home. She cut contact with both my grandad and dad and barely talks to me.

 She doesn't like talking to my grandad because he ""tells her about problems too much"" which ""stresses her"". And she doesn't talk to my dad because she thinks he's not a good dad. 
Whatever her reasons are, good for her but she had no problem taking my granddad's money until she moved out and she also had no problem asking my dad for things before she left. She also has no problem keeping the house they built with their own two hands.
One of my favourite memories about her hypocrisy is when I really wanted a bass guitar for Christmas because I love playing music and she convinced my father not to get it for me until I ""actually learn to play guitar"" (I'd been playing for a few years at that point, same as her) but then asked for one herself and got it.

Anyways so, she straight up said no to me getting her old room because ""I am the owner of the house"". I got upset and wanted to leave her place in the early morning hours and she stopped me ""for my safety"" which may be legit, yes but she was hurling insults at me the whole time and acting vey threatening. I'm sure if her boyfriend hadn't been there she would've beat me too, like she also sometimes liked to do when she couldn't control her temper.
My mum was watching videos on her phone the whole time while all this was happening, every now and again joining in the verbal assaults which is when I realised the situation I'm actually in.

These people do not care about me. They do not love me. I am not on an equal level as her. I will never inherit my share of the house. I will never find understanding.
She's always hated me for things that I had done when I was younger like for example not showering and thats how I embarrassed her at school when in my opinion, I feel I was purely neglected by my parents. When she left she never looked back. I ended up with a severe eating disorder I still struggle with daily and have almost died from it multiple times. She stopped caring pretty quickly when I didn't get better quick enough for her and started blaming me again. ""Why should I care about you if you don't care about yourself"" isn't going to help me. An eating disorder is an illness and I'm sorry to burden YOU with that.

Her boyfriend and his dad kept trying to justify her saying that I need to understand that she doesn't come from an easy household like??? no shit Sherlock you think I didn't live through the same shit?
I also loved hearing ""you think owning a house is easy? you don't get government aid for college with something like that!!1!"" well.... YOU WEREN'T MEANT TO KEEP IT ALL WERE YOU? Poor girl, while you cry to your new family about how terrible your life is and how horrible I am, I was sitting here alone, almost getting suckered and pressured into signing a loan by my mom because I had nobody to tell me any better. Struggling to stay alive. I started working at 15 so I could buy shoes where the soles weren't falling off because its so hard to get my mom to spend money on me, and sometimes still left some money that I earned for her so she can buy her and hopefully some new friends a coffee at college.  
Her boyfriend told me that its ""hard for her that I have a good relationship with my dad and grandad"" which....i just don't understand. Just because I talk to them doesn't mean i should be punished for it. And why does she just assume I have a good relationship. Just because I don't talk about that specifically too much, doesn't mean I don't also struggle with it often. Also, my grandad is 88!!! Im sorry but I'm not going to abandon him and as much as you want everyone to respect and understand your choices, you can respect and understand that different people can decide to do different things.
He also said ""Her old room is the only connection she has to home"" Welllll ... you're more than welcome to come home then. Oh wait, you don't want to, which is fine but its not like you don't OWN THE WHOLE FUCKING HOUSE, THATS NOT CONNECTION ENOUGH????? ITS  LITERALLY BEING USED FOR STORAGE YOU SELFISH BITCH *AND* YOU ALREADY HAVE ANOTHER ONE.
But of course, everyone is on her side. Poor girl, her shitty little sister dare ask her of anything. Her shitty little sister needs to learn empathy.
While her and my mom both constantly rag on me as a fun mother-daughter bonding activity, she seems to forget the beatings, not being allowed to do normal kid/teen things like visiting friends,  being insulted daily, etc. etc. But of course IM the bad one. And given that were true, where was I meant to learn good behaviour? Does nobody understand that I was a kid in a shitty environment. Why am I being held accountable for shit that happend a long time ago when the person people should be looking at when kids are noticeable in a negative way is the parent.
 
Im sick of the blatant favouritism. Some people always feel the need to exercise power over others. Imagine expecting the rights and privileges of being an older sibling but saying you owe nothing to nobody when it comes to fulfilling the duties of an older sibling.

If it weren't for my boyfriend, I would probably be battling with thoughts again that I wouldn't wish on anyone. 
It's hopeless trying to talk to them because everything you say is laughable to them. Everything you say, everything that happens is mocked, ridiculed and turned around. Thats the most frustrating part tbh. I'm always meant to listen to my sister and accept what she says but if I dare do the same she's offended and angry and any peace we had goes to shit.
To hell with them all. I'm done.
