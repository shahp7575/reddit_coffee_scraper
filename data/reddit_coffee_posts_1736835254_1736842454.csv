40h in and 200 runs later, i'd say it's about 65% luck and 35% skill. The game seems to be about setting up little advanatages for yourself and having that eventually snownball into a win.

For the most part i think im on the right mindset, i skip cards that arent exactly enticing, discard junks at the shop, take notice about the upcoming boss and try and plan around that, having a balance of block/debuff and dmg.

Having already passed Praha Libe≈à and with the morning coffees catching up on me I decided to make use of the train facilities. 

Nipped into the loo, unzipped, and entered the tunnel.... Glanced knowingly at the ""don't use the toilet in stations and tunnels sign"" so decided to wait. 
Then the train stopped....in the tunnel. So I waited.
A few minutes pass and I hear movement outside, with others interested in also using the conductor's throne.

And I waited...

No train movement. 

I considered exiting, but then the people outside would think I'd used it in the tunnel. So I waited.
The conversations outside the door speculated on my stomach issues, and that I'm probably just watching TV.

I couldn't possibly leave now. Then they would see my face. I would be ridiculed. So I waited more. I hadn't even gone yet. It was terrible.

Finally, after about 25 minutes, we pulled away again. I saw the perverbial light at the end of the tunnel, and I did my business.

I had to wait for the train to reach the station and at least half the carriage empty before I made my break for it.

I set some personal boundaries and visited a friend during his last lapse so I could breathe. When I returned he told me he needs to end the cycle of substance abuse. I‚Äôm proud of him for not drinking and I make sure to affirm to him that I‚Äôm proud. He‚Äôs ‚ÄúCalifornia sober‚Äù now so he vapes weed and drinks coffee and energy drinks. Tbh I don‚Äôt care about that stuff as long as he doesn‚Äôt go through a vape in 2 days or a case of energy drinks a week. He‚Äôs learning to moderate the weed and caffeine with help  from his therapist and a recovery coach. Now onto the situation at hand. He‚Äôs been sober for close to 2 weeks (or longer) but he is miserable. He‚Äôs on 40 mg Latuda a day and has his therapist and recovery coach. He‚Äôs still miserable. He‚Äôs used all his vacation days because he was too miserable to go to work and could potentially get a write-up when he goes in today because of how he took the time off and didn‚Äôt let his job know in advance. His desire for self-care and hobbies waxes and wanes. There are times where he says things like, ‚Äú I don‚Äôt want to work on myself‚Äù or ‚Äú I‚Äôm not even gonna try anymore‚Äù etc.
We‚Äôve already figured out that he has Generalized Anxiety Disorder and Seasonal Affective Disorder. He has his weed, his caffeine, and his video games but he‚Äôs always just pissed or depressed. He has a horrible habit of black-and-white thinking and when he‚Äôs too depressed or annoyed he doesn‚Äôt care about changing his way of thinking.
I know that his intense lapses over the last 2-ish months had to do something to his brain and it‚Äôs now kindled to hell but‚Ä¶why is he so depressed that he can‚Äôt manage to go to work, is annoyed at everything, and can‚Äôt see anything good in life? Is this PAWS? Or is the Latuda not working? Is it common for alcoholics who are trying to get sober/stay sober to be horribly depressed?

1i115rr,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_homeandsoul/comments/1i115rr/the_ultimate_rug_size_guide_finding_the_perfect/,The Ultimate Rug Size Guide: Finding the Perfect Fit for Every Room,"A rug can make or break the look and feel of a room. Too small, and it feels out of place; too large, and it can overwhelm the space. Choosing the right rug size is just as important as selecting the design or material. Whether you're searching for [rugs for living room](https://www.homeandsouldubai.com/textiles/rugs), a cozy [white carpet](https://www.homeandsouldubai.com/product/black-and-white-rug) for the bedroom, or a durable [outdoor rug](https://www.homeandsouldubai.com/outdoor/textiles/outdoor-rugs), this guide will help you find the perfect fit for every space.

# 1. Living Room: The Anchor of Your Space

The living room is often the focal point of a home, and your rug should tie the space together. When selecting rugs for living rooms, consider these layout tips:

* **Large Area Rugs:** Ideal for placing all furniture legs on the rug, creating a unified and spacious look.
* **Floating Rugs:** Center the rug under the coffee table, leaving space between the rug and the surrounding furniture.
* **Proportion Matters:** The rug should extend at least 6-8 inches beyond the sofa's edges for balance.

**Tip:** For a sleek and modern vibe, opt for a white carpet that contrasts with darker furniture or complements neutral tones.

# 2. Bedroom: Add Warmth and Comfort

A rug in the bedroom isn‚Äôt just for aesthetics‚Äîit provides a soft surface to step onto in the morning. Here‚Äôs how to choose the right size for [bedroom rugs](https://www.homeandsouldubai.com/textiles/rugs):

* **Under the Bed:** A large rug placed under the bed should extend at least 18-24 inches beyond the sides. This works well for queen and king-sized beds.
* **Runners:** Place runners on either side of the bed for a cozy yet practical touch in smaller bedrooms.
* **Small Rugs:** For single beds or twin-sized rooms, a small rug at the foot of the bed can add charm without overwhelming the space.

**Design Note:** If you're leaning towards a minimalistic look, a plush white carpet adds luxury while maintaining simplicity.

# 3. Dining Room: Define the Space

Dining room rugs should be both functional and stylish. Here‚Äôs the key to getting the size right:

* The rug should be large enough for the table and chairs, even when the chairs are pulled out.
* Measure your table and add at least 24 inches to each side for an ideal rug size.

**Pro Tip:** Choose low-pile rugs to make sliding chairs easier and prevent tripping hazards.

# 4. Outdoor Spaces: Durability Meets Style

Transform patios, balconies, or gardens with the right outdoor rug. These rugs should be weather-resistant, easy to clean, and proportionate to the space:

* **Small Spaces:** A compact rug can define a cozy seating area with a few chairs and a table.
* **Large Patios:** Use a larger rug to anchor sectional furniture or outdoor dining sets.

**Style Idea:** Neutral tones with geometric patterns can elevate outdoor decor while blending seamlessly with nature.

# 5. Hallways and Entryways: Functional First Impressions

In high-traffic areas, rugs not only enhance the decor but also protect flooring. For hallways:

* **Runners:** Choose a runner that leaves about 4-6 inches of floor visible on either side.
* **Entryways:** Select a durable rug that fits the space without obstructing door movement.

# 6. Other Essential Tips for Rug Sizing

* **Layering:** In large rooms, consider layering smaller rugs over a larger base rug for added depth and texture.
* **Balance:** Ensure the rug aligns with furniture placement and leaves equal floor space around the room for symmetry.
* **Material Matters:** For spaces like kitchens or dining areas, opt for stain-resistant and easy-to-clean materials.

# Why Size Matters

Selecting the wrong rug size can disrupt the visual flow of a room. A well-sized rug enhances your decor by grounding furniture, adding warmth, and creating defined spaces. Whether you're placing rugs for living rooms, adding soft bedroom rugs, or styling an outdoor rug for your patio, size is a key factor in achieving harmony and balance.

# Final Thoughts

Finding the perfect rug size doesn‚Äôt have to be complicated. By considering your room‚Äôs layout, furniture placement, and functional needs, you can elevate any space effortlessly. Whether it‚Äôs a timeless white carpet for the bedroom, stylish rugs for living rooms, or a weatherproof outdoor rug, the right size can transform your home into a cohesive and inviting haven.

We wake up, we eat breakfast, we go to work, we argue about the best pizza toppings, and then, just as suddenly as we arrived, we‚Äôre gone. Poof. Disappeared. Like a puff of smoke in the vast, cold emptiness of space.

Let‚Äôs zoom out for a second‚Äîway out. Like, 13.8 billion years out. That‚Äôs how long the universe has been around. You know what that means? The dinosaurs were a flash in the pan. Your lunch break is probably longer than the amount of time it took for dinosaurs to go from ‚ÄúHey, look, we‚Äôre the top species on Earth!‚Äù to ‚ÄúWell, that was fun, until the asteroid showed up.‚Äù And the universe, like an indifferent chef, just tossed them into the cosmic oven and moved on. No big deal.

Now, I don‚Äôt mean to be a party pooper, but the truth is, your existence‚Äîmy existence, all of our existence‚Äîis a blink. Not just any blink, either. A blink that happens while the universe is yawning. Imagine being at a concert, and for the entire length of the show, you‚Äôre frantically waving your hands in the air, hoping someone will notice you. Meanwhile, the band is playing, the lights are flashing, and the crowd is enjoying the music. No one cares about your little hands. They‚Äôre just focused on the fact that the concert is happening. You‚Äôre a speck of dust on a very, very large stage.

There are stars out there older than human civilization by billions of years. Some of them will burn out and collapse into black holes long before we‚Äôve even figured out how to stop fighting over where to put the coffee machine. The universe? It won‚Äôt even blink. It‚Äôll just keep on expanding, with or without us. In fact, it might not even notice we were here, at all.

Think about the fact that right now, right this very second, the universe is bustling with activity. Galaxies are colliding, supernovae are exploding, and distant stars are forming out of dust. It‚Äôs all happening in real-time, while we argue over whether pineapple belongs on pizza. In the grand cosmic scale, we are ants on a treadmill. And not the cool, intelligent kind of ants either‚Äîthe kind of ants that just walk into walls and wonder why it‚Äôs getting dark.

And yet, we sit here, convinced that our daily concerns are the center of everything. Who cares if your Wi-Fi isn‚Äôt working? The internet‚Äôs been down for billions of years before humans invented it, and guess what? The universe didn‚Äôt care then, either. So why would it care now? Why stress over a deadline or a typo in an email? The stars couldn‚Äôt care less. The universe doesn't have time for your existential crises. It‚Äôs too busy becoming galaxies, black holes, and supernovae.

In the end, we‚Äôre just here for a fraction of a fraction of a fraction of a second. A flash. A spark in the cosmic night. We live, we die, and in the vastness of space, it‚Äôs as though we were never even here. But here‚Äôs the kicker: it doesn‚Äôt matter. Because even though we‚Äôre insignificant on this grand scale, we still get to be here. We still get to experience this blink, this brief, beautiful moment where the universe didn‚Äôt wipe us off the map right away.

So, why waste this tiny moment being angry, upset, or bitter? Who cares? We're here, and we're gone, so let's enjoy the ride, the blink, while it lasts. Even if it's just one tiny grain of sand on the beach of time, that grain of sand can still sparkle in the sunlight for a second. And that‚Äôs something.

Understanding Teeth Whitening Pens: How Do They Work?

Teeth whitening pens are innovative oral care products designed to provide a targeted and efficient whitening experience. Unlike traditional whitening methods, these pens offer precision application and portability that make them incredibly user-friendly. The key to their effectiveness lies in their specialized whitening gel, which typically contains hydrogen peroxide or carbamide peroxide as the primary whitening agent.

The Science Behind Teeth Whitening Technology

The whitening mechanism is relatively straightforward. When the gel is applied directly to the teeth, the active ingredients break down stubborn stains and discoloration. These compounds penetrate the tooth enamel, targeting:

- Coffee and tea stains
- Nicotine discoloration
- Wine-related tooth staining
- Age-related yellowing

Benefits of Using a Bright White Teeth Whitening Pen

Modern consumers are increasingly seeking convenient and effective beauty solutions, and teeth whitening pens perfectly fit this demand. Here are some compelling advantages:

1. Portability and Convenience
2. Precise Application
3. Quick Results
4. Cost-Effective Alternative to Professional Treatments
5. Minimal Sensitivity Compared to Traditional Methods

Luma was dying.  

Its skies, still as beautiful as ever, seemed almost mocking in their brilliance. Swirls of lavender stretched endlessly above, marbled with streaks of golden clouds that shimmered like liquid sunlight. Beyond the horizon, three moons hung in perfect alignment, their soft, opalescent glow bathing the world below in a light that felt both warm and distant. For centuries, these skies had been the symbol of Luma‚Äôs vibrance, but even now, cracks were beginning to show.  

Cristina leaned against the window of her apartment, her prismatic eyes tracking the distant shapes of the city‚Äôs spires. Her reflection stared back at her‚Äîa kaleidoscope of colors shimmering faintly in her irises as they caught the light. Her sleek exoskeleton, a deep obsidian shade with faint silver undertones, caught the sunlight spilling through the dirty glass. It was the only thing she truly liked about herself‚Äîher unique, otherworldly beauty. But even that had faded in her eyes, dulled by exhaustion and the heavy weight of her life.  

Behind her, Marius‚Äôs voice broke the silence. ‚ÄúYou gonna stand there all day? Or maybe, just maybe, you could do something useful for once.‚Äù  

Cristina‚Äôs arms tightened around her chest, her two upper hands gripping her elbows while her lower pair hung loose at her sides. She didn‚Äôt need to turn to know he was sprawled on the couch, his shirt discarded, an empty bottle teetering on the armrest.  

‚ÄúI‚Äôm thinking,‚Äù she said softly, her tone carefully neutral.  

‚ÄúThinking? That‚Äôs rich. Thinking about how much better your life would be without me?‚Äù he spat, the familiar bitterness seeping into every word. ‚ÄúGo ahead. Say it. You always have that look on your face like you‚Äôre too good for me.‚Äù  

Cristina closed her eyes briefly, willing herself to stay calm. ‚ÄúI wasn‚Äôt thinking about you, Marius.‚Äù  

The words struck a nerve. He stood abruptly, the bottle clattering to the floor as he took a few uneven steps toward her. ‚ÄúOf course not. You‚Äôre always in your own little world. You think you‚Äôre some kind of saint? Some perfect little angel stuck with a guy like me?‚Äù  

Cristina turned to face him, her expression unreadable. Marius towered over her, his humanoid frame slightly bulkier than hers. His once-charcoal skin had taken on a sickly hue, and his bloodshot eyes were darkened by the heavy bags beneath them. His unkempt hair, once a vibrant jet black, was now streaked with gray.  

‚ÄúI‚Äôm not a saint,‚Äù Cristina said evenly, her lower hands curling into fists. ‚ÄúBut I‚Äôm also not your punching bag.‚Äù  

Marius laughed bitterly, a sound that grated against her nerves. ‚ÄúPunching bag? You think this is bad? I put up with your nagging, your whining‚Äî‚Äù  

‚ÄúStop.‚Äù Her voice was sharp, cutting through his tirade. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm tired, Marius. Tired of this, tired of you blaming me for everything wrong in your life.‚Äù  

‚ÄúBlaming you?‚Äù He stepped closer, his voice rising. ‚ÄúI wouldn‚Äôt have to blame you if you actually did something! You don‚Äôt cook, you don‚Äôt clean‚Äî‚Äù  

Cristina‚Äôs eyes flashed, her exoskeleton glinting in the dim light. ‚ÄúI do everything, Marius! I work. I clean. I pay for this apartment. All you do is sit here and drink, acting like the world owes you something. I‚Äôve had enough.‚Äù  

The silence that followed was deafening. Marius stared at her, his face a mixture of anger and something else‚Äîhurt, maybe, though Cristina couldn‚Äôt be sure.  

He grabbed his bottle from the floor, his movements jerky. ‚ÄúFine. You‚Äôve had enough? Then leave. You‚Äôre so damn perfect, Cristina. Go ahead. Find someone better.‚Äù  

Cristina didn‚Äôt reply. Instead, she turned on her heel, grabbing her work bag and heading for the door. The slam of the bottle against the wall echoed behind her as she stepped into the hallway, her chest heaving with the effort of holding back tears.  

The walk to the shuttle terminal was her sanctuary. The streets of their neighborhood were far from idyllic‚Äîcracked pavement, flickering neon signs, and the faint hum of power lines overhead. Yet, there was a strange peace in the chaos.  

By the time she reached Station Astra, her emotions had settled into a dull ache. The facility loomed ahead, its sleek structure a testament to Luma‚Äôs technological advancements. Inside, the hum of machinery and the chatter of coworkers provided a comforting backdrop.  

Neil was the first to greet her, his voice booming across the common room. ‚ÄúCristy! You look like you‚Äôve been dragged through a tar pit. Rough morning?‚Äù  

Cristina gave him a half-smile as she dropped her bag onto a chair. ‚ÄúYou could say that.‚Äù  

Neil‚Äôs rocky features twisted into a grin, his granite-like skin catching the fluorescent light. Moss sprouted in patches across his broad shoulders, a sign of his species‚Äô health and vitality. His humor, though often groan-worthy, was a constant source of levity in the workplace.  

‚ÄúHey, at least you‚Äôre here,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúMornings are always brighter with you around.‚Äù  

Cristina rolled her eyes, but her smile widened slightly.  

Carrie was next to chime in, her smooth, amphibian-like skin shifting to a soothing shade of teal. She perched on a stool near the coffee machine, her antlers catching the light as she sipped her drink. ‚ÄúRough morning?‚Äù she asked, her voice warm and motherly.  

Cristina nodded, sinking into a chair beside Neil. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs nothing I can‚Äôt handle.‚Äù  

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs my girl,‚Äù Carrie said with a wink.  

Before the conversation could go any deeper, the door to the common room slid open, and Daniel walked in.  

Cristina had seen him around before, but something about him seemed different today. His bioluminescent skin glowed faintly, the light pulsing in rhythm with his heartbeat. His tall, lean frame moved with an easy confidence, though his shoulders carried a subtle tension. His glowing blue hair was tousled, as though he‚Äôd just rolled out of bed, and his piercing green eyes scanned the room with a detached amusement.  

‚ÄúMorning, folks,‚Äù he said, his voice deep and laced with dry humor. ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs the gossip today?‚Äù  

The room came alive in his presence.  

Neil leaned back, a sly grin on his face. ‚ÄúWell, Joey nearly blew himself up again. Nothing new there.‚Äù  

Daniel chuckled, a low, rumbling sound that sent a ripple through the group. ‚ÄúClassic Joey. What was it this time?‚Äù  

‚ÄúSomething about calibrating the particle accelerator,‚Äù Tara chimed in, her bronze-and-emerald feathers ruffling as she spoke. Her sharp wit and bold demeanor matched Daniel‚Äôs in a way that often made Cristina wonder about their history.  ",1,1736840705.0,romancenovels,0,1.0,False

1i10zvj,https://www.reddit.com/r/SelfDrivingCars/comments/1i10zvj/the_future_of_cars_could_autonomous_driving/,The Future of Cars: Could Autonomous Driving Redefine Mobility?,"What lies ahead for cars? Autonomous driving is already transforming how we perceive cars, shifting their role from a tool for driving to a pure mobility service. Passengers, freed from the task of operating the vehicle, can fully embrace the conveniences enabled by technology. Moving from one point to another could one day feel as effortless as taking an elevator‚Äîsimply stepping in and stepping out. Is this seamless mobility the ultimate vision for the future of cars? Or are there even greater possibilities waiting to be unlocked?

**From DynaTAC to iPhone: Lessons in Transformative Innovation**

In 1973, Martin Cooper, an engineer at Motorola, introduced the DynaTAC, the world‚Äôs first commercial mobile phone. Standing 33 centimeters tall and weighing nearly 800 grams, it offered just one hour of talk time and could store up to 30 numbers. Clunky and rudimentary by today‚Äôs standards, it nonetheless marked the birth of wireless communication and ushered in a new era of connectivity.

Fast forward to the early 2000s, when the mobile phone market was dominated by Nokia and Motorola. These devices, with their simple interfaces and core communication features, occasionally supplemented by rudimentary games like Snake, reflected the limitations of what phones were expected to be at the time.

Then, on January 9, 2007, Steve Jobs introduced the first iPhone with a bold proclamation: ‚ÄúToday, Apple is going to reinvent the phone.‚Äù This marked a turning point when phones were no longer just phones‚Äîthey became music players, cameras, navigators, e-readers, health monitors, and AI assistants, all in one. The iPhone redefined the role of mobile devices and reshaped an entire industry, leaving traditional players like Nokia and Motorola struggling to remain relevant.

**Lead the Automotive Revolution: The iPhone Moment for Cars**

What about cars? Today, autonomous driving is in its infancy, with technological advancements steadily unfolding. Yet the question looms: will cars remain defined by their role as transportation tools, or could they transcend this function entirely? Who will step forward as the automotive industry‚Äôs Steve Jobs, and what innovation will claim the mantle of being the industry‚Äôs ‚ÄúiPhone‚Äù?

Founded in 2013, PIX Moving is a company at the forefront of exploring the potential of autonomous driving. Its core innovation lies in intelligent skateboard chassis technology, which serves as the foundation for commercially viable products like the Robobus, an autonomous shuttle, and Roboshop, an on-demand mobile shop. These vehicles are no longer confined to the traditional notion of transport‚Äîthey are mobile spaces, purpose-built for specific functions.

The company‚Äôs founder, with a background in architecture, believes the rigidity of modern cities is one of the biggest barriers to addressing the dynamic needs of urban residents. Buildings, as they stand, lack the flexibility to adapt to changing lifestyles or immediate demands. Autonomous driving, he argues, could offer a solution.

Leveraging modular skateboard chassis, PIX Moving is redefining the concept of space. Restaurants, gyms, and coffee shops can be mounted onto autonomous mobile platforms, turning spaces into dynamic, moveable resources. This vision enables spaces to interact with people, offering services at the tap of a button and transforming cities into fluid, responsive ecosystems.

**The Allure of Disruption: Breaking Rules to Build the Future**

Whether from a technical or an ecological standpoint, the exploration of autonomous driving is still on going. But every revolution starts with a single act of imagination. Transformative change often requires breaking existing norms and definitions, and this is where the true allure of innovation lies.

The future of autonomous vehicles is not just about rethinking how people travel from point A to point B. It‚Äôs about reevaluating the relationship between space and humanity. When cars no longer need to be driven, does their identity remain tied to the people they transport? Or will they evolve into something far greater‚Äîintelligent, adaptable spaces that reshape the way we live, work, and connect?¬†",2,1736840686.0,SelfDrivingCars,1,1.0,False

1i10wsc,https://www.reddit.com/r/thelongdark/comments/1i10wsc/last_night_i_spent_a_week_near_andres_peak/,Last night I spent a week near Andre's Peak,"I've been playing TLD since Dec 2016.  
This game continues to deliver.

**Goal:** to reach the summit in Sundered Pass  
**Why:** because its there, its the highest location on Great Bear Island

I read a post suggesting that the best region to spawn a survivor run is Ash Canyon.  I though it was crazy but now I get it.  You will fail more often but you can walk out as a badass with a technical backpack and crampons by day 3.  Each run is different.  Its not the same vibe as if you spawned near a gas station looting potato chips and grape soda from a vending machine.

And to reach my goal, I need the crampons; I hear they are a must to reach the SP peak.

So I started my run in Ash and after a couple fails by day 3 I'm in Timberwolf Mountain region and I think I need to find some more clothes. Instead of taking the route through Echo Ravine I came in at Deer Clearing.  I'll bet there are clothes in these crates.  I need a hacksaw.

I ended up in a region of TM near Andre's Peak; there is a frozen river, Cave C and an engine.  This is a region I have only ever passed through on my way down from the summit trying the haul loot down to Mountaineer's Hut like a n00b.  I ended up spending a week there and I will go back because its a new favorite spot.

I wasn't planning on staying since I was out of food (72 hours to earn back ""well fed"") and I noticed a bear pacing along the far shore.  But I got food poisoning (2 for 2 eating raw animal fat, remind me not to do that again).  The stump right outside the cave has 3 shrooms, so yay I'm drinking tea in my cave and sleeping the afternoon away. Well rested but between the food poisoning and some failed parkour move I was only at half health.

Despite my condition I thought I'd check out Andre's Peak since I'd never been.  The night was crystal clear with no wind.  Just glorious.  I wish I had that Polaroid camera.  No aurora but the sky was glowing faintly green. The wind picked up and I decided to scoot back down to my cave and heal up in for a leisurely mid-morning stroll down the mountain.  About 50m from the cave I heard a grunting noise behind me.  Do I sprint for the cave or crouch behind a tree?  Do I have the flare gun? No that was last run.  I have the pistol with 2 rounds in it.

Crouch behind that tree.  
Spin.  
Draw.  
Wait.

The bear sauntered up and placed his head right where I was already aiming.

BAM.  He ran off.  Did I get him? Blood.  Yes.  
OK.  Go to bed.  Go find him in the morning.

After warming up I used a mini-hack which is to check the stats for the current sandbox:  
Bears Killed = 1

Well that was fast. Must have been a headshot.  Swoosh.

Then my stomach growled.  (both IRL and in the game)  
I realized two things. I was still at half-health due to food poisoning and it is time to FEAST.  I found the bear laying down about 100 m up river.  I built two fires and was happy to have enough coal so I harvested and cooked all the meat through the night as large snowflakes fell. Did any wolves bother me?  No, not me, not the guy standing between two fires singing sea shanties. I've got one bullet left you know!

I took the bearskin and guts and laid it out in the cave with a deerskin and my 6 maple saplings. Hmm 50%.  I need to get this stuff to the workbench in the hut to build my first Travois!

Whats the rush?  I've got food for days.  Maybe I hang here for the rest of the week!

I took this screenshot as I went to pick up the last 4 steaks.  
Sadly the bear disappeared since it was fully harvested.  
I went up river to loot the crates when I came by I dismantled the two campfires.  All that's left is a heap of animal fat. OK, fine I'll pick it up to make cooking oil.  Who needs this much cooking oil? Just don't eat it.

Lessons learned:

\* aim improves the fewer bullets you have

\* don't eat raw animal fat (I didn't think I had to write that one down) use it as decoy

\* spawn in Ash Canyon: you get the swag and the swagger

A little back story.  I put up a post on the lesbian gamers sub.  I was looking for new people to play with that maybe I could relate to as most of my friends are straight. I'm just gonna call her üå™.  She answered me and after a while we started to play together.  Not only was she good, but she was honest and funny.  It was nice for a change. 
On a whim she decided to come and meet me.  Which is not something that we had done yet, but both really wanted.  Listen but don't judge,  so we've only been talking a few weeks.  She lives in North Carolina and I'm in Central Mississippi. This move shocked me.  I had no idea that she would do anything like that, but yes, yes I wanted to see her.  So she came. We were both a little shy at first but it didn't take too long to start working past it.  She ordered us some really good food and we watched some TV.  She patted her bed and said I could lay with her.  I don't even think my feet touched the floor, I got up so fast.  Here I got to cuddle up with her which was amazing by the way. We kissed, (and let me just mention that those TV fireworks actually happen in real life) we touched, and we were just close to each other for a little while. I'm not going to go into other things that may or may not have occurred.
The dilemma fell today.  Everything seemed great.  We went and got coffee and then came back to the room.  I figured we'd either spend the day in bed or maybe go and sight see a little as she'd not been here before.  All of the sudden she said she needed to go home.  That she needed to take me home and drive back today. There hadn't been a phone call or text.  She just had to go and she had to go now.  Since she'd came from so far away, I did try to get her to stay, but she told me that I was worrying about what I wanted in that moment.   And looking back, she was right.. I tried to ask her what was up, what did I do?  She said it was her, not me.  Suddenly I'm feeling like she's leaving for good and I'm about to vomit.  I get my things together and we really do leave. I was in shock the whole ride.  Did I mention she came a long way?  She held my hand most of the way back.  And she kept saying that she couldn't put into words what was on her mind at that time.  That she needed to process her thoughts.  I'm guessing her feelings too. She has had a very rough past, and also has to deal with mental illness.  I think the sudden withdrawal is coming from her past.  I feel like I triggered something, but I really don't think I did anything. I mean she hasn't ghosted me, she is still talking to me. I have been trying my hardest to hold back from texting her.  It's very hard. I want her to know that I'm here for her and that I'll always stand by her romantic or not.  I'm just afraid of losing what's developing between us.  She's unlike anyone I've ever met. And I just hope that she'll consider everything before she makes up her mind.  I've been telling her I'm in this all the way, and up until this she has been too. Am I being too selfish? Like if she said no more then I have no choice but to leave her alone.  I dunno.. thanks for reading my 1 am ramblings..",2,1736839925.0,LesbianActually,1,1.0,False
1i10tk5,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/1i10tk5/advice_needed/,Advice needed.,"Hi Reddit,

Some background: I‚Äôm a 31-year-old male, and I‚Äôm seeing a 28-year-old female. I have an anxious attachment style and really struggle with non-commitment and the fear of being abandoned, which I feel is taking a toll on my mental health. This changes to secure attachment once I know everything's good.

I met this girl on a dating app a few weeks ago, and we hit it off like a house on fire from her very first reply. We talked for hours and really got to know each other. We agreed on a first date, and it went well‚Äînothing sexual, just coffee and a walk in a nice area, where we really talked and opened up to each other.

The next day, she panicked and said she needed space. I knew she was an anxious over thinker, so her reaction didn‚Äôt completely surprise me. After some thought, I decided that needing space the day after a date wasn‚Äôt something that was likely to work, so I ended things.

A week later, I reached out again because I remembered her mentioning how stressful work was, and I wanted to check in on her. We hit it off again, talking from 8 PM until 5 AM. We decided to meet up for a second date. She set a clear boundary, saying we‚Äôd be ‚Äújust friends‚Äù because it was less pressure and ‚Äúwe‚Äôll see how it goes.‚Äù During the date, she explained she felt overwhelmed by our connection and freaked out. We talked through our differences and how we could support each other moving forward. The date went really well and ended with a kiss, which I found confusing, given the ‚Äújust friends‚Äù boundary.

We‚Äôve continued talking most days, texting and having late-night phone calls. Our work schedules align, so it‚Äôs easy for us to find time to connect.

We went on a third date, which I planned around her interests‚Äîshe had mentioned liking puzzles, so we went to an escape room (max difficulty) and managed to complete it with just a minute to spare. It was a lot of fun, and we learned more about how we handle pressure together.

During our conversations, she opened up about her past. She was in a nine-year relationship that started in her teens and ended in her mid-20s. Her ex was emotionally distant‚Äîfor example, he didn‚Äôt want to live together or spend COVID lockdown together.

She told me she loves our connection, really likes me, and thinks I‚Äôm ‚Äúhusband material‚Äù with a potential future together. However, she also admitted she doesn‚Äôt know if what we have is unique or if she could feel this connection with anyone. She‚Äôs currently talking to another guy and plans to meet him for a second date once he‚Äôs back from overseas. She said she feels pressured to decide what she wants and apologized for being a ‚Äúbitch,‚Äù but she‚Äôs adamant about going on that date to figure things out for herself.

Naturally, I‚Äôm devastated‚Äîespecially since I‚Äôm not talking to or interested in anyone else, which she knows. After hearing this, I re-downloaded a dating app and set up a profile. She‚Äôs aware of this and has been making ‚Äújokes,‚Äù saying things like, ‚ÄúOh, you‚Äôre off the table now until you stop dating other people.‚Äù and she also said me dating other people ""really hit her hard"". I‚Äôve told her I‚Äôd be exclusive if that‚Äôs what she wants but that she shouldn‚Äôt set rules for me while not following them herself.

I feel like this situation is wrecking my mental health. I‚Äôm torn between whether I‚Äôm the problem‚Äîbeing too fixated on her‚Äîor if she‚Äôs not treating me fairly and I‚Äôm letting myself be walked over. Part of me would feel relieved to let her go and stop caring, but this connection is rare for me. I‚Äôve only felt it once before, with someone I was engaged to and spent seven years with.

At this stage, what would you do? It‚Äôs clear the connection and attraction are strong, and we both see a potential future, but we‚Äôve only been on three dates. Whenever I mention how I'm feeling she says ""Well it's only been X amount of dates"" but then that same day she'll say she dreamed about me the other night.  I've been really trying to distance and protect myself but at the same time, why should I have to?

1i10p8p,https://v.redd.it/s3kkhl77vwce1,A Single dose solution! üò±,"Ok. So I‚Äôve been doing aeropress (and of course other brewing methods for longer) for maybe a decade now and have had all sorts of adventures with it. I‚Äôve always just grind a 1/2# of beans and use that grind, sadly, through all the brewing techniques. 
So the most recent step is my family lovingly gifted me a Baratza Virtuoso Plus for the holidays!! I can finally get the correct grind for what ever brewing technique I decide upon. Aeropress, Siphon, French Press, Drip, Hand Pump Espresso, pour over, etc. 
So before I even grind my first beans, I have to do a deep dive into everything on the grinder. I find about retention, fly away, static‚Ä¶etc etc‚Ä¶
The one MAIN thing I want to do is dose the right amount of beans and get them into my Aeropress. 
SOOOO I got a dosing and bellows from Andrew over at Introvertmakes
from Vancouver, BC and now I‚Äôm all excited about single dosing or rather, ‚ÄúAeropress Dosing‚Äù!! ‚Ä¶but I then want to get all the coffee goodness into the Aeropress main chamber without all that flyaway mess. I‚Äôm looking on line for two hours. Making measurements thinking I can rig something after buying something and then modifying and then‚Ä¶..blah blah blah. 
But wait!! Lo and behold is a meek empty jar of Sake and it looks ..like magic‚Ä¶
It fits perfectly inside the Virtuoso + and then fits perfectly INSIDE THE AEROPRESS so there‚Äôs no flyaway!!!!

As I‚Äôve gotten older, I‚Äôve realized how easy it is to lose the closeness we once had with people. Friends move away, life gets busy, and those deep, meaningful connections start to fade. I‚Äôm here hoping to find someone to rebuild that with ‚Äî something real and lasting.

I‚Äôm 32, based in California. I work a steady job that keeps me busy, but in my downtime, I‚Äôm all about the little things that bring me peace. I love music (I‚Äôm always looking for new playlists), getting lost in a good book, and watching anime to unwind. Coffee is my go-to comfort, whether it‚Äôs a quiet morning cup or a late-night conversation over a fresh brew. Lately, I‚Äôve also found a lot of joy in gardening ‚Äî there‚Äôs something calming about taking care of plants and watching things grow.

What I‚Äôm looking for is simple: genuine connection. Someone who wants to talk about life, passions, dreams, and even the random little things that make us who we are. Whether it‚Äôs deep conversations or lighthearted banter, I‚Äôm here for both. Romance isn‚Äôt necessarily the goal, but if something more grows from a connection, I wouldn‚Äôt be opposed.

If any of this resonates with you, I‚Äôd love to hear from you. Let‚Äôs see if we can make this disconnected world feel a little smaller.

I took the plunge and got the C3 and an AeroPress, mostly because my Moka is a 3cup variant and making just 1 cup with it is tad wasteful. Also, started having black coffee.

Experience so far ‚Äî

1. First cup (AeroPress) was a DISASTER! BlueTokai/Medium roast - I used around 16 clicks to grind. Coffee was Sour AF!

2. Second cup (AeroPress) was better, same beans, around 23 clicks (coarser grinds seem to work better for medium to medium dark roasts) 

3. Third cup (Moka) - Medium roast (13 clicks) - it was not great, mostly watery.

4. Fourth cup (Moka) - Medium Roast (11 clicks), much improved, but low quantity of extract .. 

Mind you, all of the above were prep of black coffee (Americano).

The experiment continues!

1i10dsn,https://www.reddit.com/r/encounteredjesus/comments/1i10dsn/my_testimony_from_age_16_to_age_32/,My testimony... from age 16 to age 32,"At age 16, I was confirmed in the Catholic Church.

At age 17, I smoked weed for the first time.

At age 18, I graduated from high school with a 4.3 GPA and received a half-tuition scholarship to attend a top 30 university in the U.S.

At age 18, I moved out from my parents home, moved into the dorms at university, and joined a fraternity.

At age 19, I moved into my fraternity‚Äôs house, did cocaine for the first time, and lost my virginity while nearly blacked out to a woman I‚Äôd never see again.

At age 19, I had my first psychedelic experience with magic mushrooms and instantly became obsessed with using psychedelics as a tool for personal and spiritual growth.

At age 20, I started a personal development blog from scratch, wrote 80+ long-form articles, and over the next few years my online writings garnered over 1M+ views.

At age 22, I graduated from university with a degree in systems engineering and secured a full-time job at a global technology consulting firm.

At age 22, I quit my corporate job to pursue my passion and started an online life coaching business which I ran for the next six years while traveling the world and living the ‚Äúdigital nomad‚Äù lifestyle.

At age 24, I joined a New Age cult, fell in love with a girl, and had my heart broken.

At age 25, after ""manifesting"" a nearly $10,000 month in my life coaching business, I bought a one-way ticket to Bali. I didn‚Äôt realize it at the time, but I was trying to run away from myself, without realizing that no matter how far away you run‚Ä¶ there you are. Just as soon as I thought I‚Äôd ‚Äúmade it,‚Äù my world came crashing down. From experiencing food poisoning to homelessness, and from having one of the most profound (sober) spiritual experiences of my life to nearly dying while on a vision quest‚Ä¶ I have countless stories from my time living in Bali, some of which I can probably never tell. But in the end, after being interrogated by the customs officials while doing a visa run, I had to call my parents to buy my plane ticket back home because I was out of money, out of options, and out of energy. This was the first big public failure of my life and my first ‚Äúcoming back to God‚Äù moment.

At age 26, I smoked DMT (the strongest psychedelic known to man) for my first time. I experienced hell and saw demonic spirits. It was the most terrifying experience of my life. I was told that I didn‚Äôt ‚Äúbreakthrough‚Äù because I didn‚Äôt fully surrender to the experience (aka - it was my own fault and the demons were just manifestations of my own fears).

At age 27, I smoked DMT for a second time, determined this time to ‚Äúbreakthrough.‚Äù And I did. I fully surrendered to the experience and I experienced a death and rebirth. My consciousness fully left my body and then I quite literally re-experienced being born again from my mother‚Äôs womb. It was the craziest, most bizarre, and also the most blissful experience of my life. It‚Äôs literally impossible to explain it in words. But after this experience, because I believed that I had conquered death and achieved oneness with God, my pride became dangerously inflated.

At age 28, I met a girl at a Hollywood mansion party the night of my birthday and we instantly hit it off. Turned out she was visiting LA from Portland, OR. A couple of months later, I decided to move to Portland to be with her. The next year was the most hellish year of my life as I suffered from extreme verbal, emotional, and psychological abuse‚Ä¶ I was in denial of this for a long time, but it‚Äôs the truth. Little did I know she was a narcissist with borderline personality disorder (undiagnosed, but according to her own mother and based upon my own research and experience with her, all her symptoms seemed to line up). When I finally ended our relationship, she ended up in the hospital after trying to jump out of the car on the highway. Thanks be to God she was okay, but this experience truly brought me to my knees because after trying so hard to be the savior of the situation, and to help her, I realized that there was only one person who could save us, and help her, and it wasn‚Äôt me‚Ä¶ it was Jesus. This was the darkest period of my entire life and I was completely broken and traumatized from everything I experienced in that relationship, but at the same time, I knew I was going to be okay, because I‚Äôd found Jesus.

At age 29, within a couple of months after ending that relationship, I repented of my sin-ridden past, renounced all of my New Age spiritual practices, and surrendered my life to Jesus Christ. In that moment, God poured his Divine Mercy upon me and I was filled with the Holy Spirit. Then after a short stint of exploring various Protestant/non-denominational Christian Churhces, I found my way back home to the Catholic Church. For the first time in 12 years, I was sober and had a sound mind. The moment I gave my life to Christ, my entire life was flipped upside down and the desires of my heart were changed. No more weed, no more psychedelics, no more pornography, no more fornication. I wanted nothing to do with these things anymore, and suddenly all the things that used to repel me from the Catholic Church (tradition, dogma, authority) were now the very same things that attracted me to the Church. I started going to Mass daily (sometimes two or three times in a day), Confession as frequently as possible, and spending hours in front of the Blessed Sacrament. Over the next year, I experienced more healing than I had in the previous 10 years.

At age 30, I got engaged to a woman I met at Church after the best 7 month relationship I‚Äôd ever had with ayone. It was the complete opposite of my previous relationship. Everything seemed perfect. We picked a venue and had a date set for our wedding. But one month after she said yes, we got in a fight (our first fight) and she broke off our engagement via a video call. 24 hours later, she sent me back the ring, blocked my phone number and blocked me on all social media channels. I never heard from her again. My heart was broken once again, and I was angry at God, but at the same time I had a peace in my heart knowing that no matter what I lose in this life, as long as I have Jesus, I‚Äôll be okay.

At age 31, six months after my ex-fiance broke off our engagement, I got sued by a lending company for an old loan I had taken out many years ago. This unexpected lawsuit sent my spiraling into a very dark place. Two back-to-back hits in such a short period of time were a true test of my faith. Thanks be to God, some good lawyers, and the support of family, I managed to work through this situation and finally reached a settlement with the lender. The lawsuit was dropped and my credit score is actually better now than it‚Äôs ever been.

At age 32‚Ä¶

Well, we‚Äôll see what happens. I turn 32 in less than 3 months. I recently started a job as a barista at a local coffee shop. It‚Äôs hard work, and it‚Äôs very humbling. This is only a temporary job, but I‚Äôm grateful for it and I‚Äôm also enjoying it a latte‚Ä¶ Okay sorry for the corny coffee pun, but jokes aside, I‚Äôve finally mastered pouring latte art hearts, which I am pretty stoked about. Life is so interesting‚Ä¶ This is not at all what I expected my life to be, but to be honest, I didn‚Äôt ever think I‚Äôd live past 30. So everything from here on out truly feels like a second chance at life. I still have hopes of one day getting married, raising a family, and living a normal, quiet life. But we‚Äôll see what God has in store for me. Given everything I‚Äôve already lived through (this was only a tiny snapshot of some of the key events), I know that it‚Äôs only by the grace of God that I‚Äôm still here today. I don‚Äôt deserve to be here, but I guess God still has a purpose for me to be here. And that purpose, I believe, is to bring others to Him. The only problem is, I don‚Äôt know how exactly He wants me to do that‚Ä¶ I suppose that‚Äôs why I‚Äôm writing all of this. Maybe this can be a start.

If you made it all the way to the bottom of this super long post‚Ä¶

I pray that God uses this post and my crazy life story to speak to you in some way. To bless you in some way. Perhaps to give you some hope, to encourage you, or to comfort you in some way. Or if nothing else, perhaps just to remind you that you are not alone and that no matter what you‚Äôve gone through in the past, no matter how many mistakes or stupid decisions you‚Äôve made in the past, no matter how badly you may think you‚Äôve screwed up your life or how hopeless or un-redeemable your life circumstances might seem right now, no matter how lost or confused or hurt or sad or angry or depressed you may feel right now‚Ä¶ despite all of that, I promise you‚Ä¶ you are still deeply and¬†*perfectly*¬†loved by the One who created you.

So if you‚Äôre at the end of your rope like I once was, do not be afraid.

Speaking from personal experience, you‚Äôre blessed when you‚Äôre at the end of your rope. Why? Because when there‚Äôs less of you, there is more of God.

Hey, fellow Travel Trotters! üôå After clocking in miles and memories across 50 diverse countries, I'm excited to bring you a treasure trove of unique travel experiences that you won't want to miss. Whether you're a backpacking newbie or a seasoned voyager, there's something in here for everyone. Let‚Äôs dive in! üåç‚úàÔ∏è

---

### 1. Start with the Unexpected üó∫Ô∏èüîç

While mainstream attractions are always worth visiting, don't skip out on the lesser-known spots. For example, while in Japan, instead of sticking solely to Tokyo's bustling streets, take a detour to the quaint village of Shirakawa-go during winter for a snow-laden wonderland experience!

**Tip:** Research local blogs and talk to residents. They often reveal gems hidden from the typical tourist trail.

---

### 2. Eat Like a Local üç±ü•ñ

Food is the universal love language! From Bangkok's street vendors dishing out spicy Pad Thai to Rome‚Äôs cozy trattorias perfecting pasta carbonara, immerse yourself in the local culinary scene. 

**Tip:** Join a local cooking class. It‚Äôs a perfect way to learn the secret behind your new favorite dish and engage with locals in a very fun (and tasty) way.

---

### 3. Cultural Deep Dive üï∫üé®

Every country has a story, and understanding its culture is like discovering the soul behind the scenery. Whether it's joining a Tango class in a Buenos Aires milonga or participating in a traditional tea ceremony in China, these experiences offer invaluable insights.

**Anecdote:** In India, I stumbled into a vibrant Holi festival, unplanned. Covered in colors, the warmth of the people turned strangers into family.

---

### 4. Eco-Conscious Travel üå±üö¥‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

Being mindful of our planet is crucial. Consider eco-friendly accommodations, support local artisans, and engage in sustainable activities like hiking or cycling.

**Tip:** Bring a reusable water bottle and tote bag to cut down on plastic waste.

---

### 5. The Art of Downtime üååüõå

Not every moment needs to be filled with activities. Sometimes, the best memories come from watching the sunset in Santorini or sipping coffee at a Parisian caf√©, soaking in the vibes.

**Tip:** Schedule some downtime in your itinerary to recharge and reflect.

I have been given both a BenQ GV50 and a Dangbei Atom (comes with the stand) from which i can choose one. The projector will be used in either my bedroom or livingroom.

My bedroom only has one natural light source (a door to my balcony), which has both a roller curtain and a folding curtain, which means i'm able to almost black it out. When used in my bedroom, the projector will be placed on a nightstand approximately 3 metres away from the wall which it will project onto, and it will be projecting at a slight angle.

In my living room there is large window at the end of the room which is around 2 metres wide and 3.3 metres tall. This has currently got no curtain, but at some point i will add a thin folding curtain. The projector will be placed about 3.5-3.8 metres away from the wall which it will project onto, and it will also here be projecting at a slight angle. In my living room i do have the option to keep the projecter on a coffee table almost directly infront of the wall, but this is only gives me about 2.3-2.6 metres of distance, which then again translates to a smaller ""screen""size. I do prefer having a larger image (atleast 100""-120""), when projecting.

I like the idea of the projecter having a soundsystem which is... adequate... and therefore wont force me to add an external speaker. But if i have to compromise on image size and ambient light levels, then it doesn't matter.

The projector will probably be used 80% of its time in a dimly lit bedroom for movies, but i'd like to have the possibility of using it in my living room before nighttime, if there is a sports event.

What projector do you think i should keep?

TLDR:  
Should i go with the BenQ GV50 or the Dangbei Atom if screensize and ambient light options are important to me? Will i lose more in picture quality and speakers by going with the Atom than i would lose in brightness and screen size by getting the GV50?",2,1736837762.0,projectors,0,1.0,False

I just got my license and I'm curious to know more about all of your experiences with PDIs/ Instructors/ Driving School as most of my friends have got their license about 7 years ago or so. 

For some context, I got my contact for my PDI through a friend who was taking her license last year and she highly recommended him because he was able to fast track her BTT / FTT / TP etc. My PDI mainly teaches students who got their license revoked because they're ""easier"" to teach and it's ""fast money"" because he charges them a flat fee at a higher rate to fast track their license for them. 

Just for laughs, I'll share some things about him, will love to know if any of you can relate too.

* Most of my lessons are 1 hour and 30 mins - unless i'm going into circuit, then it'll be just an hour. And i'll always opt for the last slot because i have work. Usually i start at 6pm, but he always ends earlier. At about 7:10pm. Fault's on me though, because i didn't voice out about it. Just found it quite sickening because i paid for the full lesson and found it to be quite ""wasted"".
* He loves to get me to drive him to the coffeeshop to buy his newspaper where he'll stand there and talk to his friends and drink his coffee, while I'll be waiting at the side of the road in the car, and also loves to get me to drive him to the petrol kiosk to top up petrol. 
* Always uses his phone to watch videos/ shows on max volume (it gets quite annoying because he doesn't pause his videos/ shows when he is teaching me.... he leaves it running in the background and its really loud), talks on the phone with his friends on loud speaker... From the first lesson, all the way till my very last lesson. 
* He can be quite personal at times by saying things like ""you know old and fat people are very slow when it comes to driving... just like you"" - for context, I just turned 27 and I'm nowhere near fat....
* LOVES TO DIG HIS NOSE THEN FLICK IT IN HIS CAR... ALL THE DAMN TIME. FML. 

But the good thing about him is, he was able to fast track my BTT/ FTT/ TP. All in all, i still do appreciate him because he taught me a lot of tips/ tricks even though he has all these little quirks and I'm glad i never have to go through this again LOL.

Please share your experiences! Will love to hear them.",1,1736837729.0,drivingsg,6,1.0,False

I‚Äôve worked, obviously. Last week was less full on than I was anticipating but I can feel it picking up this week. Some of the sectors are beginning their change this week and the remainder next week so the on flow of that is a lot. As well as involvement in it. I never want to be a BL. Ever. Nor do I want to specialise in ER. That being said I don‚Äôt feel the same reluctance when I consider specialising in change/restructure‚Ä¶ does that make me monstrous? Probably. I just like that it‚Äôs based on numbers, logic and there‚Äôs no personal behaviour involved. Don‚Äôt get me wrong I find the behavioural matters fascinating (as fascinating as they can be anyway) but I don‚Äôt have the same level of interest in it in the sense of *doing*. I like my work to be based around fact I think, it leaves less room for error I suppose. Eg. you‚Äôre being let go of because we need to reduce by $X and this role is chosen to be disestablished because XYZ - as opposed to you‚Äôve done XYZ which are against code of conduct/the law/policy/whatever and your behaviour towards these people warrants this outcome etc. The former feels more detached and for someone who is incredibly emotional herself and I am never a robot with people at work, but I like that it‚Äôs more detached. And it doesn‚Äôt drag on - there is a defined period and structure to the process. I sound like such a robotic stickler, don‚Äôt I? If I had half a brain I think I would enjoy a technical job of some kind. Where you can zone out on one or two projects and just focus and fixate. Though is my mind cut out for that? Then again I did say if I had a different mind, didn‚Äôt I. I really don‚Äôt know if HR is for me. But also what else is there for me? I genuinely don‚Äôt feel like I have the brain, skill set or general capability for anything much. That isn‚Äôt me being down on myself, I know I am a conscientious worker and I know I‚Äôm not *stupid* but I‚Äôm also not smart in almost all the ways that matter or exist and idk. I feel stuck. Anyway, work is picking up. My focus is still half way around the world - it‚Äôs truly avoiding me. 

I bought a new drink bottle today. I need one that isn‚Äôt made of metal and therefore weighs half a tonne. It‚Äôs green and transparent and cute. I can put it in my new handbag when it arrives! :) I need to stop spending money! :) In my defence the things I have bought - water bottle, work bag, coffee machine - are all things I have mulled over for months - even the $47 water bottle that I could have just bought on a whim but *I didn‚Äôt*. And also yes I could have got one for a lot less $$$ but my therapist said I‚Äôm allowed to surround myself with things that aesthetically please me, she said she gives me permission (within reason) because I need to seek joy where I can find it and being surrounded by aesthetically pleasing items is something that brings me joy. Doesn‚Äôt mean expensive, just means nice. 

I cleaned my bathrooms today :) I‚Äôm pleased I did, they didn‚Äôt *need* it but I wanted them to feel fresher and it can hardly hurt. Anyway it was a last minute decision to power clean in the last bit of my lunch break. I vacuumed, I cleaned the surfaces, the loo, the shower and the basin. And then I swapped out all the towels and mats to be cute pink ones and I refreshed my orange blossom diffuser. Pretty! I could do with giving them a mop but you can get absolutely wrecked if you think I‚Äôm mopping on a lunch break. I have mopping. I think it‚Äôs a PTSD thing from my first cafe job and I would be on the closing shift and I would sometimes have to mop the whole place and it was big, like **BIG**. And it was the octopus mop where it looks like a wig and I‚Äôd be carting it up and down and I am not someone who likes to do a bad job when I‚Äôm getting paid like I don‚Äôt cut corners and so I would do it very thoroughly every single night - mostly because I didn‚Äôt like doing the bathrooms surprise surprise. So I would do the cash up and the mopping and clean the surfaces. And other stuff. Idk. I liked working hospo, I was good at it/with people and I enjoyed being constantly busy but not really having to think. And I liked the barista who would make me hot chocolates or iced coffees on the sly, he was nice. 

My coffee machine arrived! I haven‚Äôt unwrapped it and tbh I was excited for it and yet have zero desire to unwrap or test it out now. My therapist said this is how depression shows itself in smaller way. I will get excited for the idea of it and the reality of it, but then the time comes and I just do not want a bar of it like I don‚Äôt care and I don‚Äôt have any drive to act on it. Mental health is kinda funny. I always thought my being like this was just my personality, I mean I‚Äôm sure it is to an extent but so anyway my point is - wait idk what I‚Äôm even talking about. Nvm. I ought to try set the machine up tonight so I can use it tomorrow though. Shouldn‚Äôt I? Hm. It‚Äôs almost 6pm. I have two hours. I‚Äôd kind of rather read. 

Okay time to start the reread of this IF book. The third comes out next week. I don‚Äôt even like this series much but whatever. Or maybe I do really like it? I don‚Äôt remember. I don‚Äôt care about any of the characters much, nor the premise or the world building and it‚Äôs not written all that well either. So basically I don‚Äôt like it much but I also think I get hooked when into it. Idk guess we‚Äôll see as I begin this reread. It‚Äôs not massive, 623 pages, but they‚Äôre big pages. Like it‚Äôs a lot bigger than a regular sized paperback. Idk. Who knows and who cares. 

Okay I think I will try with this coffee machine. Maybe I can cook dinner at the same time? Idk what to make. Hm. Hm hm hmmmmmmmmm. 

I did it! It took all of ten minutes, maybe less. Another lesson in that things that are daunting to me need not really be at all. It works :) And I am not an espresso girl :) YET. I would like to be. I‚Äôd like to be able to enjoy - or at least enjoyably tolerate - black coffee. It‚Äôs much better for me health wise and I‚Äôm sure if I were to a) care and b) expose myself more to it, I would enjoy the richer flavour of the coffee. Eventually. Or maybe I shall just make my milky flat whites and call it a day. I‚Äôm almost tempted to get some caramel syrup - sadly but obviously the low/no calorie kind - and make flavoured lattes! How fun! I want the milk frother jug now. Next pay day. I‚Äôll also by then have a better idea of what kinds of coffee I like and can buy some more pods too. Sensible. Also the Nespresso box is bigger than the one I had for Andy before so now I can finally get it all prepped for shipping to him via express post because the boxes I had before were all too small. I‚Äôm not even sending much at all! 

Okay it‚Äôs 6:34pm - time to make some dinner. I‚Äôm not that hungry though. I bet I will be later though. What shall I make? I don‚Äôt really feel like anything. Actually what I feel like is a plate of fried halloumi with wilted garlicky spinach - yummmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm. Maybe this weekend at mum and dads! They always just get whatever I suggest. Even if I mention it in passing they‚Äôll go buy it. Anyway. 

I made beans. Spicy beans with cucumber, avocado in a mini tortilla. I had two as well as some lettuce on the side for basically zero nutrients and more so I feel the Health feelings coursing through my veins. 

Okay time to shower. And then guess what? TIME WITH MY HONEY! Baby baby babyyy.

1i109sm,https://www.reddit.com/r/Empowish/comments/1i109sm/the_5minute_habit_that_will_radically_shift_your/,The 5-Minute Habit That Will Radically Shift Your Mindset,"‚ú® Hey Empowish family! Sometimes life feels like a constant pursuit of dreams and goals, right? We juggle work, relationships, and ambitions, hoping to strike the perfect balance. Let's chat about something that's small but mighty‚Äîsomething that can transform not just your day but your entire mindset: the 5-minute habit. üß†üí™

Many of us think that transformation takes grand gestures or significant time investments. But what if I told you that just 5 minutes a day could radically shift your mindset? Intrigued? Let‚Äôs dive in! üåä

1. **Morning Gratitude Ritual üåÖ**

Start your day by taking 5 minutes to jot down three things you‚Äôre grateful for. They could be as simple as the sunshine streaming through your window or the smell of fresh coffee. This practice trains your brain to focus on the positives rather than the overwhelming negatives. Over time, you‚Äôll notice a shift in your general outlook‚Äîa subtle yet powerful positivity boost! Plus, acknowledging small wins can be satisfying and motivating.

2. **Mindful Breathing üå¨Ô∏è**

Life gets busy, and stress often tags along for the ride. But we can combat it with just 5 minutes of mindful breathing. Close your eyes, take slow, deep breaths, and focus solely on your breathing pattern. Doing this as a daily habit can decrease stress, increase focus, and enhance emotional resilience. Bonus: this is your quick go-to whenever you feel overwhelmed.

3. **Intentional Visualization üé®**

What if you could 'sneak-preview' the future you desire? Spend 5 minutes visualizing your goals as already accomplished. Imagine the details: where are you, what do you feel, and who is with you? Visualization isn‚Äôt just daydreaming‚Äîit‚Äôs a tool that athletes and leaders use to elevate performance. It can align your daily actions with your deepest desires, creating an unstoppable momentum in your life.

4. **Daily Affirmations ‚ú®**

Affirmations can be potent when you repeatedly hear empowering beliefs aimed at success and happiness. Craft a few affirmations that resonate with your goals and values, and speak them aloud every day for 5 minutes. Whether it‚Äôs ‚ÄúI am building my dream life‚Äù or ‚ÄúI am worthy of the success coming my way,‚Äù let these affirmations act as your mental armor.

5. **Reflection & Journaling üñãÔ∏è**

End your day with 5 minutes of reflection. Ask yourself, ‚ÄúWhat went well today?‚Äù or ‚ÄúWhat did I learn?‚Äù Writing down these thoughts can help you acknowledge achievements and recognize growth areas. It‚Äôs a rewarding practice that will also improve self-awareness and mental clarity over time.

‚ú® Remember, beautiful journeyers of Empowish, big changes often start with small steps. These 5-minute habits are straightforward, yet when practiced consistently, they initiate profound growth and foster a fresh, dynamic mindset. üåü

Despite that, even just having a chat is all good so my expectations are realistic I guess haha.

About me:

\- I'm a creative person. Right now that means playing & making music, as well as writing.

\- For my music, at the moment I'm just playing guitar & singing, though I'd like to pick up the piano again :)

\- I work from home with a family business. I make enough to live comfortably, though not extravagantly (yet?)

\- Because of my job, I can travel & move quite freely. I'm open to eventually relocating/moving out of NZ

\- I work out a lot, and I really like it

\- I'm about 5'8, slim-average build (working on putting some muscle on though), buzzed hair & stubble. Green eyes and tanned (but white) skin

\- I have multiple tattoos (just counted, there's 9). They all have meaning and make me happy daily

\- I'm big on travel. As much as funds allow, of course. Hopefully that's something I could do with my partner

\- In addition to travel, I love exploring new places. Whether it's urban or natural, it's also something I'd love to do with my partner!

\- I like reading, a lot. I read on average a book a week. I've just got a John Muir book out from the library and I'm stoked on that!

\- I like a mix of ambient & heavy music. Lots of old punk bands and drone artists in my playlists haha

\- I'm very liberal

\- I don't smoke, drink, or do any drugs (except coffee)

\- I don't have kids, and I don't want them

\- I'm happy sharing photos pretty quick, though I know it can be a point of anxiety for some so there's no pressure or rush in that regard!

About you:

\- I don't mind your gender or any of that. Just let me know your pronouns if that's important for you :)

\- please be hygienic. Regular showers and clean clothes are important! Not being disheveled and having a skincare routine is a massive plus

\- please don't be an addict, or if you are then please be working on recovery

\- I don't have any physical preferences, though making sure you look after yourself is a plus!

\- I don't mind where you live. Though being open to & able to travel is a big bonus (obviously)

\- please don't be conservative/right-wing

\- preferably be between the ages of 20 and 39, though anyone 18 or over is welcome to message me

That's about all I have to mention. If there's any details you're curious about don't hesitate to ask, I'm here for communication after all.

# How Does Digital Real Estate Master Class Compare to Similar Courses?

The [Digital Real Estate Master Class](https://ecowebdesign.co.uk/digital-real-estate-master-class-official) enters a competitive space filled with programs promising success through the **rank and rent business model**. Let‚Äôs take a look at how it measures up against a few notable alternatives:

# Rank and Rent Local Lead Generation (Udemy)

This course is budget-friendly and provides over 8 hours of content, making it an attractive option for beginners. However, it lacks the personalized support found in the **Digital Real Estate Master Class**, such as live coaching and mentorship. If you‚Äôre looking for more hand-holding through the process, the latter is the better choice.

# Job Killing by Dan Klein

A premium-priced course, **Job Killing** offers detailed instruction and access to an active community. While it shares similarities in structure, it leans heavily on upselling additional products and tools. The **Digital Real Estate Master Class**, in contrast, feels more self-contained and straightforward, with fewer unexpected costs down the line.

# Hybrid Lead Generation by Mike Martin

This course focuses on integrating Google My Business (GMB) listings into the rank-and-rent strategy, which is a strong point. However, the **Digital Real Estate Master Class** is more comprehensive in teaching **SEO for lead generation** and scaling across multiple industries, offering greater flexibility.

# Lead Generation Empire (Udemy)

Another affordable Udemy course, **Lead Generation Empire** is great for those testing the waters but doesn‚Äôt go deep into advanced strategies. The **Digital Real Estate Master Class**, with its more thorough training on **website monetization** and personalized support, offers a significant advantage for long-term results.

To the peanut gallery over at r/SugarBabyOnlyForum,

It‚Äôs cute how a sub dedicated to sugar babies suddenly feels qualified to throw stones at a sub that unapologetically caters to the very men they depend on. Your attempt at a ""PSA"" reads more like a cry for attention than an actual call for safety. Let‚Äôs dissect this masterpiece of cluelessness, shall we?

1. **The Condom Crusade**: You‚Äôre mad that Sugar Daddies and Sugar Babies are engaging in sex without condoms? Sweetheart, let me spell it out for you: that‚Äôs called *normal people having consensual sex.* Adults in the bowl make their own choices. If you‚Äôre out here confusing us with the professional hoes that you are, that‚Äôs on you. No-brainer condom policies exist for escorts‚Äînot for Sugar Babies having intimate arrangements with their Daddies. Know the difference.
2. **Allowance Austerity**: Crying about someone setting terms under $500 PPM? Here‚Äôs a newsflash: Sugar dating isn‚Äôt charity. It‚Äôs a mutually beneficial dynamic, emphasis on mutual. If you can‚Äôt convince a man you‚Äôre worth it, maybe stop blaming him and look in the mirror. The bowl rewards quality, not entitlement.
3. **Horny Dumb?**: Let‚Äôs address this one because it‚Äôs almost funny. Calling Sugar Daddies ""horny dumb"" while banking on that ""dumb money"" is laughable. You‚Äôre out here chasing allowances while dragging the men funding your designer bags? The irony is palpable, but don‚Äôt let self-awareness ruin your narrative.

Here‚Äôs the thing, ladies (and I use that term loosely): You don‚Äôt have to like what we do here. You don‚Äôt even have to agree with it. But the moment you come after us, pretending you hold the moral high ground in a world built on the exchange of resources, you look foolish.

And here‚Äôs some advice: worry less about what we‚Äôre doing and focus on staying relevant. Because let‚Äôs be real‚Äîwithout us, the bowl dries up, you know it ;)

You‚Äôre welcome for the free attention. Now run along. Get back to your regularly scheduled programming of DMing strangers and hoping they‚Äôll send you $50 for coffee.

It‚Äôs only getting worse and worse. I want my life back. This is an actual fucking nightmare beyond words.","There are no words for the nightmare I'm living every day. There's no joy, happiness, excitement, anger, passion, sadness - nothing, not even anxiety. I used to appreciate the small moments, my morning coffee, a good chat with a friend, a workout, a weekend trip - there was so much worth living for.

I am suffering beyond comprehension. My life makes no sense, my mind doesn't work, my body doesn't work. No matter how much I rest, sleep, workout, accept - it never gets bigger, in fact it's getting worse as the days go on. All of my friends are traveling and living their life, while I can barely do the most basic things. No one can tell my why I'm suffering and what to do about it. Nearly 3 years of my life is gone to this and it only gets worse and worse. I have no connection to who I am, where I am, what I'm doing. I am void of any person or any sense of a life. I wish I could just disappear, I am exhausted, I can't do it anymore. I can't even enjoy a meal, a hot shower, cuddling my dog, a hug from a friend. I don't feel weather around me, or what time it is, what season it is, where I live. When I tell you every single waking moment of my day is hell, I mean it.  There is no break from this, it's 24/365 loss of all feelings and senses. I don't want to die - I want to live the way j did before, the vivid, beautiful, real world I used to know. This is just pure agony. All day every day. No time passes in my mind, I can't even feel anxiety anymore. I don't know what to do. I feel completely broken and my life destroyed. I've held on for so long but I'm losing my grip. My life is not real, I am not real. I don't even feel like I have a body, there's no internal sensations or feelings. I am chronically tired all day long. I see no purpose in anything. No one can help me, I am suffering in silence. I'd take my depression or anxiety any day before this. This is loss of everything, completely dead and gone. No one understands, I've been sentenced to death by my own mind yet I'm still alive to witness it.

The most important thing for your LEEP procedure to go well, is finding a skilled & masterful female OBGYN

I was so so so so worried- I have never felt such fear in my life about anything- and after today‚Äôs procedure, I really wanted to post on here to give other females some positive encouragement that it will all be okay!

I believe that the experience was so successful because my doctor & I worked TOGETHER. She is the most supportive, loving & caring doctor I‚Äôve ever had, as well as the most SKILLED and MASTERFUL doctor for LEEPS‚Äî so I want to stress, if you can find a doctor you feel comfortable with, who you know is talented at what they do, you can & will get through this!! 

As much as you want to mentally prepare, it‚Äôs difficult to navigate uncertainty and fear. But if you can marry fear with unwavering faith, on the other side of facing that fear, is your most badass warrior self!  I want to encourage hopeful thinking, not ‚Äúdoomsday‚Äù thoughts. (It feels incredibly empowering to be on the other side of this fear now, I have never felt so strong & proud)

When I first received the news that my precancerous cells had come back, I was spiraling in anxiety for the entire two weeks leading up to the procedure- to the point where I was having trouble functioning in day to day life from how scared I was.

Now, 8 hours out from the procedure, I cannot believe how unnecessary all of those mental mind games were that I was playing on myself, what was i so worried about? The LEEP honestly felt easier than the colpo / biopsies. 

Here is a breakdown of my experience:

3:30p arrived at Stonybrook Medicine
(I highly suggest DR KOWALSKA if you are in the NY area or can travel here for your procedure- she is, in my experience, THE VERY BEST)

4p was in the chair & ready to begin.

5p was in the car heading home already!

Pain & discomfort levels of each part

Speculum insert; (and the moving around of the speculum during the entire ordeal)

	‚ÅÉ	1 out of ten: To my extraordinary surprise, this was the most painful & uncomfortable part

 3 needles into my cervix;

	‚ÅÉ	0 out of ten!: this is the part I was MOST scared of, and I DIDNT FEEL A THING. I didn‚Äôt even know she did it! I still cannot even believe it. Our bodies are so incredible, our cervix is made to ensure SO much, remember how resilient your body is!

Two separate excisions, one deeper into the canal;

-0 out of ten!: because of the numbing, I didn‚Äôt feel a thing 

Stopping of the bleeding;


-0 out of ten!: because of the numbing, I didn‚Äôt feel a thing

ECC; (uteran scraping)


-0 out of ten!: (It seems that) because of the numbing, I didn‚Äôt feel a thing (or perhaps it‚Äôs where I‚Äôm at in my cycle? I‚Äôm days out currently from my period)

^this was the second part I was most scared of. Even my doctor told me that the ECC & after cramping would be worse than the colposcopy, because of how much is done to the body beforehand. But I was shocked & surprised to find out that it was painless (the colposcopy biopsy + ECC, however, was definitely painful and uncomfortable‚Äî which is the procedure you get BEFORE the Leep procedure)

After cramping;

	‚ÅÉ	1 out of ten; if you‚Äôre like me, and you have endometriosis, or just really bad monthly period cramps, this will be a breeze! This was NOTHING compared to what I go through every month on my period.

Hours after the procedure; 

-0 out of ten! I‚Äôve been feeling a bit of pressure, a bit uncomfortable,‚Äôbut nothing serious at all. I‚Äôm mainly feeling a lot of movement in my stomach area. As if my body has discovered it just went through something big, and is tending to it with all its magical healing. But, it‚Äôs an interesting feeling, for sure! My stomach is doing a lot of talking, a lot of rumbling,‚Äôa lot of.. what feels like.. assistance in getting back to optimum health. Like there are little elves in there working overtime to make sure i heal up just right. :p but, no pain!

*I have been keeping very still, binge watching shows & painting with a heating pad on my belly. I‚Äôm eating very slowly just so as not to agitate or overwhelm my body too much, and eating gentle things like soup and juice and rice. I just went to the bathroom for the first time since the procedure, and it was painless. A little yellow discharge coming out so far, but nothing more than that. I expect the next week to have a lot of different ‚Äúcoffee grind‚Äù type stuff to come out, as well as bleeding and continued yellow discharge, as the doctor said, but nothing too crazy just yet.

Overall, I‚Äôm feeling REALLY good :) 

I also want to add that for 2 years I avoided the procedure through Ayurvedic Indian medicine that WORKED. It‚Äôs only when I stopped the herbs, that the abnormal cells came back. I also want to encourage women to look into alternative holistic methods because they really do work. I used the same Ayurvedic doctor that worked for a friend of mine, and will now continue to take these herbs for the rest of my life to ensure I give myself the greatest chance to never have abnormal cells again. (highly recommend DR JAY with Athreya herbs in long beach California)

Do all of your research, ask EVERY question, learn about your individual situation and do NOT let anyone push you or force you into going through with it until you are ready, confident and sure it is the best decision for YOU and your circumstance. 

I hope this post can ease many of your concerns. I know I felt so much relief from the positive Reddit posts I read prior to the procedure, and I hope I can be apart of that relief for you, too. Blessings for you & your journey. <3 (remember, you are a WOMAN and you are STRONG! And you can do this! Believe in yourself, show up for yourself, and know that you got this!)

It was six months ago that I had become so consumed with coffee in order to see the meetings through. I did try some ways to avoid burnout as my sleeping kept getting worse. By the time I couldn't balance work with life, I knew I needed something more than [simple sleep tips](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01D70FWOS).

I have been joining various wellness programs for workers, but this time I joined a full burnout recovery retreat. Here is how this program changed the way I handle sleep and work stress.

# Understanding How Stress Affects Sleep

That was in these stress-relieving classes that I learned how burning out really changes the way we sleep. Further, these sleep experts showed me that my sleeping troubles were not just a bad habit; this unending stress from work keeps my body in ""fight or flight"" mode all day and night, and good sleep could not be possible this way.

# Restoring My Body's Sleep Clock Through Mindfulness

Instead of quick fixes, the program actually taught me sleep strategies that would last. We did daily mindfulness practice for sleep, among other wellness activities. These really help in resetting my body's natural sleep timing. The mental health team explained that meditating outside in the morning helps create a natural pattern for better sleep.

# Dealing With Emotions: What I Was Missing

The section that really helped me deal with job stress was the one that did not just give simple tips on handling stress but actually explained why I was feeling anxious about work. We did some sessions on recovering from burnout, and I saw how poorly my efforts to rebalance life and work were affecting all those attempts to sleep better. Things started to get finally better when I employed their tips on preventing burnout during the day.

# Help That Lasts

But what really made this program special was the follow-through after it was over. Tacked onto the end of the retreat are three months of extra support, including online workshops about stress and sleep tracking. Having people to check in with who really get the challenges of work burnout made it easier to stick with these new stress management habits.

But the most important thing was not to learn how to sleep and different tricky ways to do so, but it all starts with how one responds to work stress throughout the day. When you balance work and life well, better sleep will naturally come out.

Has anyone tried special programs against burnout or sleep help because of work stress? Which method of handling stress worked best for you and helped balance your job with sleep?
