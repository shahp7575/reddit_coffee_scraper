1g75nd6,https://www.reddit.com/r/sleep/comments/1g75nd6/lions_mane_for_sleep_anxietypanic/,Lions Mane for Sleep Anxiety/Panic,"I’m pregnant and began having sleep anxiety/panic attacks at about 5 months. Every time I’d try to sleep an immense panic would set in, or if I did manage to get to sleep I would wake up in a panic and just cry from how bad the anxiety was hitting me. It got so bad I was barely sleeping. My husband puts lions mane in his coffee every morning for mental clarity during work and he said why not try it. I was already doing Epsom salt baths, magnesium, unisom, everything I could do safely with pregnancy. I almost got on Zoloft to ease the anxiety, but I didn’t like the potential side effects for baby. 

It completely took away the sleep anxiety within about a week, maybe two of taking it before bed. I went back to being able to sleep normally. Then comes the biggest evidence. I’m currently nine months pregnant and the sleep panic came back so bad in the last few days. I woke up my husband because he helps me breathe when I’m having an anxiety attack. Then he goes “did you take your lions mane?” And light bulb!!! I did not. See, I do a 30 day pill container with my supplements like prenatal, magnesium, potassium, iron etc. And I filled it three days ago, but forgot the lions mane (the package is a bag not a pill bottle so I looked over it this time). 

All in all, I feel like I can’t live without it now. I’ll try when I’m not pregnant anymore, but I also see no negative continuing to use it since it’s just a mushroom. If you’re having sleep anxiety give it a try!! ",1,1729332196.0,sleep,0,1.0,False

I started liking him from the first sight. I really liked his calm energy, he’s rather introverted person, quite reserved and a bit shy. He doesn’t talk much and he’s definitely not a type you can have a smooth small talk with. He barely says hi and bye. But I noticed that sometimes while waiting for his order he looks at me. Few times when he was leaving and closing the door he turned his head into my direction and looked at me. Last time when he came he said „good morning” which was very unusual and looked me deeply into my eyes and on the way out quietly said „have a great day” and I was like frozen and I barely said anything to him that day except looking at him and trying to smile to him. He definitely noticed that I like him because I was totally nervous around him. 
Anyway for the last few days I noticed that he was passing by the coffee shop early in the morning but didn’t come in or didn’t even look inside through the window which gave me a sign that he might actually not liking me at all.
My friend advised me to talk to him more and ask him random questions but well probably it’s not a good idea and I could just scare him away if he’s shy. Should I just move on or should I try to approach him somehow the next time he comes in.   Since I’m actually not sure if he likes me I don’t want to nervously and pointlessly approach him.

There's so many dishes from sri lanka which are quite hard to make, hard to get that authentic flavour and finish, takes a lot of time to cook or isn't available in the place u live.. 

Under that case do ull have any food that ull love but rnt able to have it regularly. 

For me, when I was in sri lanka I loved lumpraise but I didn't have it frequently cuz I ve never tried to cook nor anyone from my family knows how to cook lumpraise so it's just a food that I order when I go out but I wish I could have it more frequently. 

Then, egg hoppers, none knows to cook but I love the taste of egg hoppers with kata sambal, pol sambal, seeni sambal and spicy fish gravy, first class food but sadly it's something that I eat very few times every year. 

Since I'm in a different country I miss hell lot of food like sri lankan fried rice, kottu roti, asmi, beli mal with pol roti, tea bun, roast paan, ice coffee, fish cutlet, manyoca chips, orange king coconut, kadala from streets, isso vade, parripu vade sold in trains n near wine stores with fried chillie, mixture, acharu, kimbula bunis, bombay mutai, seeni sambal bun, star tipitip, falooda, dodol, alapa, lavariya lumpraise, hoppers etc 


I wish I could have them as before..

NC for this as personal/outing. Am wondering AIBU? Or WWYD?

Began seeing a local man met on OLD. We matched so perfectly: same age, local, some mutual acquaintances, similar hobbies, outlook, politics, music taste, humour etc. Found him incredibly sexually and emotionally attractive and vice versa.

We became very close and cosy very quickly: daily contact, usually in person, in and out of each others' houses for coffee and a chat, sleeping over at each others houses often, meeting each other's friends and family. Talked loads, for hours, about a wide range of subjects and very frankly. Within weeks we were so close and comfortable with one another it felt like we'd been together for ages.

The only thing that wasn't perfect was that he had no spare spending money. He had gone part time at work to give him the time to renovate his house, singlehandedly, and those renovations also ate up all the money he had left over after paying mortgage and bills. He warned me that, until the house was finished and he returned to full time working, he could not afford to spend much on going out, going away, buying me gifts, unless it was cheap and we split the costs. I am not materialistic so I did not care and to be honest I am a homely person who is more than happy to have dates at each other's houses, cooking each other a meal or watching a film. For Xmas he saw something in a charity shop window which he knew I would love and he even admitted it had cost him only £2 and said he felt guilty and mean and sorry and hoped I would tolerate his being skint until he got back to work and could treat me properly and take me to a swanky restaurant now and again.

Whilst chatting and being in his home whilst things were happening in his daily life he would mention now and again that he was down to his last few pounds, or that the purchase of some essential building materials or an emergency dental problem or vet bill had wiped his bank account. I am not wealthy but I do have a couple of hundred pounds left over every month which I usually just put into a savings account. He never once asked me for money and in fact when I offered to lend him money once or twice he absolutely refused. When I offered to treat him to a fancy meal out or a theatre ticket he also refused, saying that unless he could pay at least his own share, he would not go. I saw these refusals as a confirmation of his honesty and integrity.

One day I was at his house reading the paper after breakfast and he was opposite me on his laptop. As he went to answer the front door I took the dirty plates to the sink and as I turned round to walk back to the table I could not help myself, my eyes were drawn to the screen which had some kind of spreadsheet of figures. I was absolutely staggered to see that he had stocks and shares and an ISA totalling £1.5m. When he came back into the room I just pretended I had not seen anything because I knew I should not have been snooping but I went home and was literally in shock and also really angry that he had been lying to me the whole time.

Next time I stayed at his I deliberately snooped when he was in the shower, and read an open letter about the sale of a flat he owned (which he had never mentioned to me). £250,000 from the sale had been deposited into my boyfriend's bank account about a week before, and yet that very day he had been saying how broke he was.

Am I in the wrong for snooping or is he in the wrong for telling me for a whole year the lie that he is struggling financially from month to month?

What would you do? Confront him and admit you snooped? End it? Tell yourself his finances are none of your business?


AmIbeingUn · Today 10:32

One of the ironies is that he actually set me up with stocks and shares and an ISA after I told him that I was putting what I had left over every month into a bank savings account. He explained that I could do better by investing that way. Then we actually sat together at my laptop and he showed me how to open the accounts online and all through doing this he never once said, ""I have these accounts myself.""

Also I would add that the inheritance he will get from his elderly wealthy mother's property and savings will give him at least £1m so he really does not need to squirrel away every last spare penny for his old age.

We do go out now and again if its something he really wants. For example one of those tribute bands was playing at our local theatre, a tribute to one of his favourite bands, and we went BUT he chose the cheapest possible tickets (ie the worst seats) and I had to pay for my own because he ""could not afford"" to pay for us both. Also I had to buy my own Maltesers in the lobby and he would not pay the theatre's inflated price. And in the interval when everyone made a dash to the bar he pulled out a small carton of Ribena.

Some people have mentioned about me ""liking"" him. We are well past that stage, telling one another ""I love you"" every day now for nearly 2 years.

The stupid thing is, I genuinely DO love him as a person, even as a totally skint person. This is about him lying to me, not about me wanting to get my hands on his money. The fact that I am still with him after nearly 2 years of no treats, no trips and constant frugality proves that.

Yes I agree, I can see that makes sense BUT does he have to be QUITE so stingy? He could have just acted like his finances were like any normal working person. I mean, he could have bought me a £25 Xmas present, it did not HAVE to be a £2 charity shop gift. (I bought him a winter coat that cost me £75.)

If you haven't already I would book those theatre nights just for you. His reaction should be revealing

Oldraver, I do go to lots of things without him. But I would like to have weekends away, maybe an actually holiday, with my boyfriend now and again, just like normal people.

What's annoying is he constantly says he cannot afford it, when in fact he has ten times as much savings as I do!

He's very stingy, I would find this deeply unsexy. I am genuinely poor and find it offensive that a rich person would pretend not to have any money. Also if he can lie about this what else can he lie about?

The other thing that occurred to me is, by buying all his clothes in a charity shop he is preventing genuinely poor people from buying those items. With £1.5 million invested and another quarter-million in his bank account he can easily afford to fork out on some reasonably cheap clothes from a chain store or whatever.

1g75gf1,https://www.reddit.com/r/RelationshipIndia/comments/1g75gf1/got_rejected_from_my21m_5_year_long_best/,"Got rejected from my(21M) 5 year long best friend(21F) , who behaved like a gf . ","
So last year on Nov I(21M, CS student) suffered breakup (my first love and relationship) well it was worse than betrayal.

I was devastated from it. She ( 21F at that time) was my only important friend in my department, my everything and she was like not even a dry leaf had fallen in her world. Smiling , talking with other boys ( she doesn't have any female friend in our dept. only her younger sister). Even my buddies were talking with her as I stood alone and watched.

I had also a girl best friend (21F) from high school years, we like other part of ourselves but due to some misunderstandings, I was angry with her the whole year. So even after her breakup I wasn't there for her as much as I should have been. Even if I was angry with her, looking to let her go, after she clears NEET and finds new friends to replace me...deep down she was my best friend, even though I felt betrayed by her (misunderstanding).

So some unexpected people, old friends and her helped me to heal. Constantly hearing my rant, helping me to find a reason, conclusion whatever... if she wasn't there I wouldn't have clearly survived.

Well then comes the new chapter. I was ashamed that she helped me when I wasn't there for her. So I promised myself that I would also be there to protect her. And I tried to do everything I could. Always heard her, called her, pushed away her insecurities when she shared her problems...etc. like a best friend and her sworn protector.

Time went on and on.... some months later, I developed some soft corner for her.

I consulted it with a college friend of mine and he said it was bcz ""she is the only one who is showing kindness to you when you needed. That's why you are feeling these things, that are not your real emotions""

So I ignored those feelings from then on. But as time passed, as we more talked... My feelings for her grown more and more. But I was really uncomfortable and angry with it bcz what if she thinks that I am thinking of her as a rebound or backup or like bcz she is the only girl I talk with. What will aunty think about me? She trusts me so much like her own son, even she will be disappointed. And I really wanted to prove our friendship, like we can be this close and be good friends (without overstepping the boundaries of course).

Then came a day in May, she wanted to gift me a shirt fro my birthday, so she asked me to go shopping with her. It was like a date. I held her hand to cross the streets, made her try some dresses, clicked some photos of her in those. Went to a momo restaurant, fed her and then returned to her home holding hands in e-rickshaw and till we reached her house gate. And talked further in her house enjoying coffee made by aunty(regular things)

Then in July similar things, we walked holding hands all throughout the street until a e-rickshaw came. I pulled her towards me by her waist. I told her to rest her head on my shoulder and she did it. We were so close, we could hear our breaths.

We also used to send each other romantic best friend posts or videos in Pinterest ( I didn't have social media).

But there was another side to it. Every time I returned to home. I just argued, fought to myself thinking ""What am I doing! Am I just taking advantage of her, my life saver?""

And like this, the more I fell for her, the more I was conflicted between my feelings, as a reason whenever we fought, I would distance herself bcz I didn't want to think about her like that and also not to say anything rash... or I would forever regret saying something I didn't even mean, because she used to hurt me in the exact spots where my previous and only relationship of life left wounds. But of course she was hurt too. She would always say sorry.. Almost like begging me sometimes. I of course felt more pain when she did this. Like my ex used to misbehave to me like that, I would always say sorry.

So after a few months, just 10.days ago.. I called her out of mere frustration,

""...... Sometimes you treat me like your best friend and sometimes like no one, so please either hold me or leave me alone""

She gave an positive answer, "" I want to be your safe heaven.....""

So I finally decided to be honest with my feelings and decided to propose her 2 years later on her birthday, when I will be in [M.Tech](http://M.Tech) so she wouldn't think that I am doing this just because I'm lonely.

But life took some unfortunate turns, bcz of my sheer anxiety I just proposed her( Ostomi).

I proposed her of course bcz I knew we were something more than friends.

But don't know what happened.

Her response :

So...actually I had also feelings for you in May when we went out, I thought of it like a date but you said that it was just an outing. Even in Rakhi, I wanted you to tell me, that ""do not tie Rakhi on me""...

But after the recent fights, I don't know what I feel. I want to keep our friendship...

She is a Muslim and I'm a Hindu. But I told her that, when I said I love you, I meant that with every consideration. There are thought roads ahead but I am prepared to walk through that. And take your time, I am just confessing my feelings I will propose you 2 Yrs later.

She said, she will give her answer in 2 months but I insisted her to wait for my graduation and she agreed.

And told her that , you liked may right ? Those were the times I couldn't suppress my feelings , so just sit back and let me love you as I want bcz I decided to be honest with my feelings only some days before.

Then we talked like normally, sent reels on Instagram.

In afternoon, she asked whether we would be friends even if she says no.

And I said : No. You know that I can't love and unlove someone. And if we keep being friends I will suffer each and everyday. So I don't want to.

Maybe you would find someone better than me, your college life is just starting and mine is close to being finished.

But I want you to know that, I don't see you as an option.

So you have to decide if I am worth fighting for.

Then I got to my studies.

Few minutes later I checked WhatsApp and saw her message.

""So to be honest. I don't know if I will find someone better but.

I don't think we are good as couples, although we are good as friends.

If it was may I would have accepted it in a heartbeat, even I wanted to tell you my feelings first.

But after those many fights, some part of died.

.

.

.

We have both changed....

.

.

.

I can fight for you as a friend but nothing more...

Sorry to break your heart. Please don't hate me.

I love you even though it's not the way you wanted..

.

.

If it helps you hate me a lot""

(Blocked)

I just don't get why she said this. She loved me in September (tied Rakhi) and not now(October)?

We both know each other for 5 years. A time tested friendship, we know each other more than anyone.

Each and every issue she raised as problems. All of it was addressed, explained and some were apologized ( bcz I didn't hurt her intentionally, but I was conflicted with my emotions )

She used to lecture me , "" I don't give a fuck about society."" ,"" My papa said , don't ever listen to society""...( on the other hand I cared and still decided to take responsibility of us ).

I wanted to protect her from her Insecurities, wanted to give her all the love she deserved and earned from me.

For the most of this we're we were something like ""more than friends but not lovers""

But doesn't want commitment? Or responsibilities of both of our feelings.

Was I her love, her best friend or just a cheap emotional and physical attachment?

Now when I thought more and more about her. Only thing I understood that.

• In May, I was her necessity( she was emotionally vulnerable, still missing her ex and her another best friend) so she said ""I would have accepted it in a heartbeat"". But now she has "" glown up""(many people, guys compliment on her pics in social media, some flirts) so... I am not a necessity anymore nor my feelings just an emotional need/ attachment.

She, my best friend of 5 years just played with my feelings and rejected me when I wanted a proper relationship not a almost relationship.

\[\[\[ I don't have many high school friends.

I she, her ex, another friend were the only remaining.

Her ex and I had bad terms even before her relationship ( he thinks he is a big shot cuz he studies in IIIT Bhubaneswar).

And I go to gym with the other friend.\]\]\]

This pain is nothing compared to my breakup. But still it hurts. I never thought she would do this to me. Maybe she doesn't even realize, but she just had put me in a situationship.

Sometimes I imagine her crying and ask my friends if I should reach her out. But I don't want to kill my self esteem again, while doing that.

But I feel empty. Can't focus on my studies. Can't sleep more than 5 hours. Every morning after waking up, all those sad thoughts plays into my mind.

Don't know when I can focus on my studies. I have GATE studies 🙂. Semester is near.

It feels so much unfair , she knows more than anyone the type of person I am . She herself said, you're handsome, kind .. like every girl's dream. WE both treated each other like lovers, and now this ? had feelings for me in September but not in October? She promised me to always be with me, support me even when I gave her the option to leave me alone. But now I can't hate her bcz of the tone of her text. And I am left broken once again when now even a year has passed I was betrayed.",1,1729331317.0,RelationshipIndia,2,1.0,False

A week ago, I had a great life ahead of me. I owned a successful company thanks to something I did for the government (I honestly don't remember what it was I did; memory loss, they called it. Whatever it was, I'm just glad I got out of it alive) I had a wife and two sons, I'm particularly proud of those boys, looks like they're growing to be real men, just like their father. I also had a hot secretary to satisfy all my... needs at work, the wife didn't have to know. Now, I'm in this room, under investigation for something I had absolutely nothing to do with.

It all started a few days ago. I was preparing to give a presentation to a prospective business partner; it looked like we were about to seal the deal of a lifetime. But God knows what happened to my presentation (someone definitely hacked it), but instead of the final slide, what came out was porn! And not just any, oh no... if it were that, we could've likely just laughed it off as a harmless prank (we were all men in the room, as it should be). What it was, even I had reservations on it. I swore up and down that that wasn't mine and someone likely hacked it, even launched an internal investigation into it (I never thought this would backfire on me later). Needless to say, despite my efforts, the damage was done. The deal fell through, and worse, word of my gaffe spread through the industry.

A painful, but recoverable loss, I thought (at the time). We were still relatively stable, and this investigation would reveal who messed with my computer; and when I find out who, oh, I will make sure that person regrets ever breathing my air. I suspect it was that new IT girl, what's-her-name. She never liked my jokes, maybe this was her version of a prank. Anyway, until that's confirmed, I just had to keep running the company and raking in the dough. Except...

Two days ago, someone gave an anonymous tip to the local news. Apparently, the investigation had too much of a conscience from what they found and decided to go public on it. The entire board of directors, myself included, was found to have... illegally explicit material on our computers. And not just the work computers; apparently, even our home PCs had gigabytes of the stuff. All of us, all good men, someone framing us for being disgusting pigs! I knew that bitch had something to do with it, and I'll ruin her if it's the last thing I do. At least, that's what I told myself as we were being brought in by the police. I just had to post bail; I have the money for it

...I had the money for it.

I tried to post bail through my accounts, but when I checked, they were all cleaned! Down to the last cent. Transaction history showed that the money was sent to multiple accounts - Susan's Coffee and Pastry, Sam's Cleaning Products, Steve's Corner Post - the list goes on. I was completely broke. My last hope was my wife; my wonderful, obedient, loving wife. She would never abandon me.

When she came to where I was being held, I was overjoyed. I knew she had enough to get me out, and we can leave this place, flee and begin our lives anew. We had the resources (thank God she didn't listen to me when I asked her to join our accounts). I was about to reach through the bars to hold her when

""I'm filing for divorce""

Her words shook me to the core. Before I could even work on the words to respond, she pulled out her phone. Someone had sent her the security feed from my office, on a day when my secretary and I were having... our one on one discussions.

""I didn't want to believe the news, but when I saw the evidence, and now this, Chris? How old is your secretary? Is she really that much older than the girls on those videos? How can I trust you when this is clear as day?!""

I had no words. I knew nothing I could say can convince her.

""I'm taking the boys with me. They're disgusted that you could do something like this.""

She turned and left. At that, I knew I was screwed.

That was a day ago

This morning, I was brought out of my cell by one of the guards. I knew they couldn't keep me locked up too long without a proper trial and sentencing, but until then, I still had no idea what I was gonna do. Now I'm in what looks to be an interrogation room, perhaps waiting for the investigators to start grilling me. Imagine the shock when...

""Mr. Byrnes, all charges are being dropped"" one of the men said in a begrudging tone as he entered the room, followed by a woman who looked like she belonged to a higher post than him. I internally scoffed at the thought.

""Apparently, you have some friends in high places, and the case is being dropped in exchange for your assistance to them with a... certain matter"" he continued as he glared to the blonde beside him.

""Follow me if you accept these terms"" the woman said curtly

""Yes! Thank you, I'll do anything!"" I leapt from my seat, thankful for whatever favor I had done in the past (which I still have no recollection of) and followed the lady. I ignored the embarrassment I felt from following a woman, especially since she had just given me my freedom back... not to mention she was also quite easy on the eyes

We entered a nondescript black SUV (figures, it is the government after all). We entered the vehicle where she offered a drink from her canteen as she drove. It was a strange flavor, perhaps an energy drink? Figures, she didn't look like a person who enjoyed coffee.

""So... what can I do for the damsel who brought me out of distress?"" I put on my charm to see what a girl like her could want from a guy like me. Even though there is plenty a guy like me has to offer to her

""You'll find out when we get there. Now drink up, you'll need to be well hydrated for the task"" she replied in the same curt tone from earlier. I just realized this is still the third sentence she spoke to me ever since we met.

""Normally, I'm the one offering a lovely lady her drink, but thanks"" I chuckled as I downed the rest of the canteen. I didn't know when it happened, but somewhere along the drive, everything went dark.

I awoke to cold water being splashed on my face. As I took in my surroundings, I realized I was restrained to a chair. Cuffs linked my wrists and ankles. I also felt a piercing pain in my back, but I couldn't identify the source. I began to panic, looking around before I saw my captors.

One of them was the agent who had ""rescued"" me. The other one, apparently the one who doused me, was... that bitch from IT

""YOU!"" I shrieked as I struggled against my bindings

""Hello Dr. Byrnes. Hope you had a wonderful sleep."" IT bitch smirked and tossed the bucket in my direction, bouncing it off my head. Although it was a plastic bucket, it felt like I got slapped with a baseball bat. I reeled in pain and wondered how something so light thrown by her of all people could possibly hurt so bad. It looks like the agent read my expression, as she walked closer, holding a vial of a strange liquid.

""It's amazing how specific of a drink you can request from SCP-294"" the agent smugly twirled the vial between her fingers

""For example, I could request a cup of liquid immortality with a double shot of pain sensitivity amplifiers... and a touch of tranquilizer, but I didn't need 294 to do that for me""

I didn't get it, what the *fuck* was SCP and what's with the numbers?

""Ah, yeah, you have no idea what we are talking about, Dr. Byrnes"" she smirked

""You don't understand, you have the wrong guy... I'm no doctor, never have been!"" I pleaded with my captors

""Of course you wouldn't remember, you slimy pig!"" IT bitch screamed at me as she yanked at a chain. All of a sudden, I felt as if my back was hit by a shotgun as I was pulled backwards. I realized why my back hurt so much. The backrest of my seat was actually a meat rack.

The agent held up a picture. A young lady, couldn't be 30 years old. She looked like a nurse, or a pharmacist. But I had no clue who she was.

""No?"" the agent changed the picture. It looked like the same young lady, but she looked disheveled, one would say broken. It would've turned me on if my back wasn't on fire.

""Of course you wouldn't"" IT bitch chimed in, giving the chain a quick yank. I screamed as my back felt like it was being torn to pieces.

""You wouldn't but she remembered you all too well, you sadistic fuck"" she spat and brought out a fire axe

My eyes widened at the axe. They were going to butcher me, all for some chick I didn't know

""Please! You have the wrong guy! I'm telling you! Please, I don't wanna die!"" I pleaded with them

The agent looked at me with a smile on her face and fury in her eyes

1g75c61,https://www.reddit.com/r/self/comments/1g75c61/i_believe_in_true_love_but_the_last_3_woman_i/,I believe in true love but the last 3 woman I dated told me they had an actual long term boyfriend 2 weeks into us meeting with dating intentions. Is that normal?,"So for context. The first one was a sort off an obvious thing with hindsight I just have too much trust. So this woman dated with as much as kissing and mentioneeld she really likes showing affection by gifts. Which ya know I am fine with it. I can respect the appreciation on physical value etc. And I don't mind actually doing that if the person is okay with showing me affection by a way I like (which she did). Anyway she told me after a while that she wanted to get gifts because she doesn't wanna work and wanted to get presents to hey boyfriend. Look it's fine red flag we meet only w few times and kissed after 3 dates. So it's fine shit happens some crazy people.

The 2nd happened about a year after. I wasn't really interested in dating but ran into this girl at the bar we chatted and bla bla bla. Ended up having sex on our date at like end of 2nd week. So anyway youd imagine that means it's going great. Well about 2 days says after she hits me with ""btw I know this will sound terrible but i am still with my boyfriend of 2 years. I just wanted some space from him but we never actually broke up so... And he phoned me yesterday and bla bla bla"". Now I hate the fact I slept with someone who is with someone. Technically on a break but not officially. Regardless I felt disgusted she told me and I've never been that speechless. Just got up and left. (She ended up telling him and I believe they are still together I haven't really said a word to either of them other than an apology to the guy by text as I got his number a bit later. He was cool about it. Mistake/I didn't know anyway. 

The 3rd one is sort of like okay I guess. But it's the fact it was 3 in a row. We meet for coffee and not to say too much I wrote her a letter like a dork. She really liked it got in touch with intentions of meeting to see how we are. (It was a bartender at a wedding I attended. And no no it wasn't weird it was just me saying she really put the bride at odds for the best looking person there. So anyway over 5 days. 3 days I was working night shifts so we agreed to meet on day 5 but those 3 days we texted a lot and she said she wants to see how it goes at coffee and see where it leads. Now it might be just me. But words like that sort of indicate hey I am up for meeting and seeing if we vibe for a future date/whatever And we did? We laughed a lot actually and had a similar humour and the way we talked. But anyway apparently she got back with her boyfriend after a fight that lasted basically a day before she messaged until day 4.and a bf of atleast 18 months? They got a damn hidden meaning tattoo on both of their left leg. Like. Okay listen. It's okay. I am not mad. I won't judge someone for wanna be on a break and be open about it. Especially if it's just meeting for a coffee but it's just....

Idk just like you have this guy you love apparently and you're okay saying randomly you're on a break and approaching men and going far with them etc. I am not trying to hate. I am just wondering if this experience is just the unluckiest thing ever or? 

And none of of them ever really showed me the vibes of someone who sleeps around. Like all of them would engage reply fast and make time etc. It's so weird. Anyway if you got this far thank you for reading. I dont really need advice. And please don't have my English writing show I am angry/hateful towards them or anything like that. I've made mistakes in my life. And the only people that need to be okay with it is the person that that person effected. And there is nothing of me thinking the next girl I meet will do the same. I am sort of trust until you break it sort of. So it's fine. Was just wondering after w hard night shift haha",1,1729330744.0,self,1,1.0,False

No coffee - went without for a year and switched to decaf!

I was wrong.

1g75ap6,https://www.reddit.com/r/CasualConversation/comments/1g75ap6/to_feel_that_being_an_outsider_stifles/,To feel that being an outsider stifles friendships in England? ,"Good morning, this post isn’t intended to be inflammatory. I’m just talking about my experiences.

Of course throughout my time I have met lots of lovely people in England. 

__

To clarify, I am Northern Irish but would essentially be regarded as an outsider in England, equivalent to a foreigner in some respects.

Since living in England (I have lived here a total of six years off and on, mostly on the south) I have found that English people can be friendly but are a hard nut to crack. 

I have found that they almost never open up or release as in get to know you or show their true selves. 

Let me give some examples:

1. Had one or two acquaintances my whole time at university. Invited people out for coffee but was a hassle to get it arranged and often gave up. Only had one acquaintance who I regularly hung out with.
2. In my job (not gonna elaborate), very closed off people. Nobody talks to me at all. All go off on lunches which are arranged privately or prior when I’m not around. Don’t feel respected.
3. Neighbours rarely interact with me.
4. Had one close colleague who I felt that I got along with. We spoke every day, sometimes for an hour or more. They left, I spent £50 on a present for them, we met up for lunch afterwards once. I haven’t heard from them since. This stings and I feel like an idiot for thinking we got along well. 

I find in general that people here just aren’t interested. Everything is very surfacey but also people prioritise being polite over honest so often times issues aren’t resolved so you’ve got this passive aggressive behaviour etc.

I also feel that the out of sight out of mind policy is common here. For example, I was off with a virus for two weeks, nobody contacted me to ask me how I was. I also broke my leg bones and same. At home people would’ve visited/sent a gift at the very least. 

I honestly find myself getting along much better with people from abroad even though I was born in the UK. 

It can just get lonely and sometimes seems as though people just don’t like you because you’re not English.

First I checked for the price on  the usual e-commerce site Amazon, but because on their website it was available for cheaper price, I decided to order from there. And now I am regretting that decision. The order procedure was smooth, it selected items, proceeded to add details like name, email address, mobile number, delivery address etc and finally the payment section came. I usually pay online, because in many cases I am not available to take the order, so the delivery guy drops it to security. It was a razorpay payment gateway, and a qr code for the payment was shown. After I paid via UPI to the account, I was waiting for  the screen to redirect and expected a message like payment done. I didn't get any. I waited for 12 minute, because it was written not to refresh or go back. Nothing happened. A message on the screen came to try again. Immediately, I took a screenshot of everything and emailed continental coffee's customer email address telling everything that happened. On the next morning I replied to that email asking them to respond. Till now, I did not get any response. My and I both called their customer service phone number at least 10–15 times. No one picked it up. Then we decided to file a complaint on Consumer forum. We filed a complaint but got an auto generated response. At this I point, I don't know what to do. The amount was ₹663.10. If anyone has any suggestion, please share. Thanks.

Long story short, I have an online close  friend I met on IG art community last year, let’s call her Mikaela[18], my dream girlfriend who is really cute, artistic, introverted , otaku, hardworking and nice. Mikaela has all of those traits and I wanted to confess to her and meet her in real life someday,but I don’t think I have a chance because she lives so far away and  we’re financially broke so we can’t meet each other and she has a crush in her school. I sort of lost interest with her three months ago because of that. Long distance relationships don't always work all the time and I have trust issues. 

Anyway my school year started around the last week of  August and I’m the first classmate to chat with her. We became friends and she’s cool, she admired my dedication to be an artist and my responsibilities for my family. Actually she is extroverted, a gamer girl and also loves to watch anime and horror films.
After one month and half, I don’t know why,  when I’m walking to the canteen and Francine is waving at me and says hi. It’s really cute, which is weird because I’m not usually into extroverted and gamer girls. Maybe I’m interested in other types of girls too? When I started to like her, she had a boyfriend that was quick with my classmate.His rizz it’s so strong. 

I’m obviously devastated and heartbroken, but part of me is that I won’t be a good boyfriend anyway because  I’m not physically attractive, I’m financially unstable,Im introvert, I have responsibilities at home and I have a mild adhd that makes my life more difficult, so what more if I have a girlfriend? However, I’m her seatmate and my classmates refuse to switch seats with me, all the class projects, I’m always in Francine’s group and even worse, we’re partners in thesis defense  research for two months, so we survey people, and she comes to me and discusses what’s our next plan for the research always in happy mood. It makes it even more awkward and heartbreaking for me knowing I still have a crush on her and I do have dreams about her at night. The dreams are about me and Francine dancing at prom or we date in the coffee shop. I’m trying to move on and forget about her, but we’re always in project groups and partners for thesis project. I’m already losing interest in Mikaela even though she has all of the traits of my dream girlfriend, however Francine opens doors for me that I can always explore other traits of people too. 

My heart is breaking.

1g74wmf,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_ImTechTales/comments/1g74wmf/confession_i_secretly_love_to_stealbut_not_in_the/,Confession: I Secretly Love to Steal—But Not in the Way You Think!,"Okay, so I need to confess something that sounds way worse than it actually is. I have this weird little thrill that comes from stealing… but hear me out! It’s not what you think. I’m not talking about robbing banks or shoplifting; I’m talking about the little things that don’t really matter but still make me feel like a master criminal. Here are some of my most ridiculous “heists”:

	1.	The Free Samples Bandit:
I don’t care if it’s a grocery store or a Costco; I live for free samples. I’ve perfected my technique of casually strolling through the sample station like I’m conducting serious taste-testing research. I go back for seconds, thirds… sometimes I even pretend to have a friend with me to justify the extra bites. I’m basically a food thief, and my loot consists of tiny cups of salsa and bite-sized cheese cubes. I swear, one day I’ll have my picture on the wall of the store as “The Sample Bandit.”
	2.	The Napkin Ninja:
I have an embarrassing stash of restaurant napkins at home. I don’t just take one or two—I grab an entire handful. They’re just so fluffy and soft, and I can’t resist! My friends think it’s a joke, but I genuinely feel like a thief every time I walk out with my ill-gotten gains. When I host dinner parties, I proudly serve dinner on a collection of “free” napkins. No one knows the truth, and I’m living the high life!
	3.	The Mystery Mug Heist:
I’ve “borrowed” so many mugs from various coffee shops that I’ve lost track. I keep telling myself they must have a “take a mug, leave a mug” policy, right? I once showed up at a work meeting with a bright pink mug that said “World’s Okayest Employee.” Everyone loved it, but little did they know I snatched it from a café three towns over. I like to think I’m doing the world a favor by spreading joy through my mug collection.
	4.	The Library Looter:
Okay, I don’t actually steal books, but I’ve definitely “borrowed” the same book from the library like four times. Each time, I tell myself, “This will be the last time I check it out,” and then I find it nestled under a pile of laundry weeks later. I swear the library is on to me, and I’m just waiting for the day they send me a stern letter or a fine for my “repeat offenses.”
	5.	The Shopping Cart Caper:
I’m not ashamed to admit that I’ve taken a few shopping carts home after grocery runs. I tell myself it’s a “temporary loan” because I’ll definitely return it—someday. My neighbors probably think I’m starting a grocery store in my garage. I even have a little cart family now, and they all have different names. My friends just shake their heads and laugh, but I’m living my best life in a cart-filled wonderland!

So there you have it! My not-so-dangerous life of thievery is filled with laughter, snack-sized victories, and a collection of random items that make me feel like a secret agent.

Imagine brewing the perfect cup of coffee. It requires a delicate balance of elements: the right beans, precise temperature, and a touch of artistry. Just like crafting a delicious brew, successful marketing involves a blend of strategy, creativity, and a deep understanding of your audience.

# 1. The Grind: Target Audience

Just as grinding coffee beans to the right consistency is crucial for a great brew, understanding your target audience is essential for effective marketing. Identify their needs, preferences, and pain points. Tailor your messaging and offerings to resonate with them on a personal level.

# 2. The Water: Market Research

Like water, market research is the foundation of a successful marketing campaign. Gather data on your target audience, competitors, and industry trends. This information will guide your decisions and help you refine your strategy.

# 3. The Roast: Branding

The roast of coffee beans determines its flavor profile. Similarly, your brand identity sets the tone for your marketing efforts. Develop a strong brand message that resonates with your target audience and differentiates you from competitors.

# 4. The Brewing Method: Marketing Channels

There are various brewing methods, each with its own unique characteristics. In marketing, choose the right channels to reach your target audience. Consider factors like demographics, preferences, and budget when selecting platforms like social media, email marketing, or content marketing.

# 5. The Temperature: Timing

Brewing coffee at the right temperature is essential for a delicious cup. In marketing, timing is crucial. Analyze your audience's behavior and preferences to determine the best time to reach them with your message.

# 6. The Crema: Customer Experience

The crema, the layer of foam on top of coffee, enhances the overall experience. Similarly, a positive customer experience can foster loyalty and advocacy. Focus on providing exceptional service and exceeding customer expectations.

# 7. The Taste: Measurement and Analysis

Just as you taste coffee to assess its quality, you need to measure and analyze your marketing efforts. Track key performance indicators (KPIs) to understand what's working and what's not. Use this data to refine your strategy and improve your results.

**Conclusion**

Marketing, like brewing coffee, is a delicate art that requires skill, knowledge, and a passion for excellence. By understanding your target audience, crafting a strong brand identity, choosing the right channels, and continuously measuring and analyzing your results, you can brew a successful marketing campaign that leaves a lasting impression.",1,1729328323.0,godigitalwithaadityas,0,1.0,False

I will make a new post when this version is ready for public use. You can still use the v0.5 tracker at the below link, you just won't be able to edit anything.

1g74qvq,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskIndia/comments/1g74qvq/got_rejected_from_my_5_year_long_best_friend_who/,"Got rejected from my 5 year long best friend , who behaved like a gf. ","
So last year on Nov I(21M, CS student) suffered breakup (my first love and relationship) well it was worse than betrayal.

I was devastated from it. She ( 21F at that time) was my only important friend in my department, my everything and she was like not even a dry leaf had fallen in her world. Smiling , talking with other boys ( she doesn't have any female friend in our dept. only her younger sister). Even my buddies were talking with her as I stood alone and watched.

I had also a girl best friend (21F) from high school years, we like other part of ourselves but due to some misunderstandings, I was angry with her the whole year. So even after her breakup I wasn't there for her as much as I should have been. Even if I was angry with her, looking to let her go, after she clears NEET and finds new friends to replace me...deep down she was my best friend, even though I felt betrayed by her (misunderstanding).

So some unexpected people, old friends and her helped me to heal. Constantly hearing my rant, helping me to find a reason, conclusion whatever... if she wasn't there I wouldn't have clearly survived.

Well then comes the new chapter. I was ashamed that she helped me when I wasn't there for her. So I promised myself that I would also be there to protect her. And I tried to do everything I could. Always heard her, called her, pushed away her insecurities when she shared her problems...etc. like a best friend and her sworn protector.

Time went on and on.... some months later, I developed some soft corner for her.

I consulted it with a college friend of mine and he said it was bcz ""she is the only one who is showing kindness to you when you needed. That's why you are feeling these things, that are not your real emotions""

So I ignored those feelings from then on. But as time passed, as we more talked... My feelings for her grown more and more. But I was really uncomfortable and angry with it bcz what if she thinks that I am thinking of her as a rebound or backup or like bcz she is the only girl I talk with. What will aunty think about me? She trusts me so much like her own son, even she will be disappointed. And I really wanted to prove our friendship, like we can be this close and be good friends (without overstepping the boundaries of course).

Then came a day in May, she wanted to gift me a shirt fro my birthday, so she asked me to go shopping with her. It was like a date. I held her hand to cross the streets, made her try some dresses, clicked some photos of her in those. Went to a momo restaurant, fed her and then returned to her home holding hands in e-rickshaw and till we reached her house gate. And talked further in her house enjoying coffee made by aunty(regular things)

Then in July similar things, we walked holding hands all throughout the street until a e-rickshaw came. I pulled her towards me by her waist. I told her to rest her head on my shoulder and she did it. We were so close, we could hear our breaths.

We also used to send each other romantic best friend posts or videos in Pinterest ( I didn't have social media).

But there was another side to it. Every time I returned to home. I just argued, fought to myself thinking ""What am I doing! Am I just taking advantage of her, my life saver?""

And like this, the more I fell for her, the more I was conflicted between my feelings, as a reason whenever we fought, I would distance herself bcz I didn't want to think about her like that and also not to say anything rash... or I would forever regret saying something I didn't even mean, because she used to hurt me in the exact spots where my previous and only relationship of life left wounds. But of course she was hurt too. She would always say sorry.. Almost like begging me sometimes. I of course felt more pain when she did this. Like my ex used to misbehave to me like that, I would always say sorry.

So after a few months, just 10.days ago.. I called her out of mere frustration,

""...... Sometimes you treat me like your best friend and sometimes like no one, so please either hold me or leave me alone""

She gave an positive answer, "" I want to be your safe heaven.....""

So I finally decided to be honest with my feelings and decided to propose her 2 years later on her birthday, when I will be in [M.Tech](http://M.Tech) so she wouldn't think that I am doing this just because I'm lonely.

But life took some unfortunate turns, bcz of my sheer anxiety I just proposed her( Ostomi).

I proposed her of course bcz I knew we were something more than friends.

But don't know what happened.

Her response :

So...actually I had also feelings for you in May when we went out, I thought of it like a date but you said that it was just an outing. Even in Rakhi, I wanted you to tell me, that ""do not tie Rakhi on me""...

But after the recent fights, I don't know what I feel. I want to keep our friendship...

She is a Muslim and I'm a Hindu. But I told her that, when I said I love you, I meant that with every consideration. There are thought roads ahead but I am prepared to walk through that. And take your time, I am just confessing my feelings I will propose you 2 Yrs later.

She said, she will give her answer in 2 months but I insisted her to wait for my graduation and she agreed.

And told her that , you liked may right ? Those were the times I couldn't suppress my feelings , so just sit back and let me love you as I want bcz I decided to be honest with my feelings only some days before.

Then we talked like normally, sent reels on Instagram.

In afternoon, she asked whether we would be friends even if she says no.

And I said : No. You know that I can't love and unlove someone. And if we keep being friends I will suffer each and everyday. So I don't want to.

Maybe you would find someone better than me, your college life is just starting and mine is close to being finished.

But I want you to know that, I don't see you as an option.

So you have to decide if I am worth fighting for.

Then I got to my studies.

Few minutes later I checked WhatsApp and saw her message.

""So to be honest. I don't know if I will find someone better but.

I don't think we are good as couples, although we are good as friends.

If it was may I would have accepted it in a heartbeat, even I wanted to tell you my feelings first.

But after those many fights, some part of died.

.

.

.

We have both changed....

.

.

.

I can fight for you as a friend but nothing more...

Sorry to break your heart. Please don't hate me.

I love you even though it's not the way you wanted..

.

.

If it helps you hate me a lot""

(Blocked)

I just don't get why she said this. She loved me in September (tied Rakhi) and not now(October)?

We both know each other for 5 years. A time tested friendship, we know each other more than anyone.

Each and every issue she raised as problems. All of it was addressed, explained and some were apologized ( bcz I didn't hurt her intentionally, but I was conflicted with my emotions )

She used to lecture me , "" I don't give a fuck about society."" ,"" My papa said , don't ever listen to society""...( on the other hand I cared and still decided to take responsibility of us ).

I wanted to protect her from her Insecurities, wanted to give her all the love she deserved and earned from me.

For the most of this we're we were something like ""more than friends but not lovers""

But doesn't want commitment? Or responsibilities of both of our feelings.

Was I her love, her best friend or just a cheap emotional and physical attachment?

Now when I thought more and more about her. Only thing I understood that.

• In May, I was her necessity( she was emotionally vulnerable, still missing her ex and her another best friend) so she said ""I would have accepted it in a heartbeat"". But now she has "" glown up""(many people, guys compliment on her pics in social media, some flirts) so... I am not a necessity anymore nor my feelings just an emotional need/ attachment.

She, my best friend of 5 years just played with my feelings and rejected me when I wanted a proper relationship not a almost relationship.

\[\[\[ I don't have many high school friends.

I she, her ex, another friend were the only remaining.

Her ex and I had bad terms even before her relationship ( he thinks he is a big shot cuz he studies in IIIT Bhubaneswar).

And I go to gym with the other friend.\]\]\]

This pain is nothing compared to my breakup. But still it hurts. I never thought she would do this to me. Maybe she doesn't even realize, but she just had put me in a situationship.

Sometimes I imagine her crying and ask my friends if I should reach her out. But I don't want to kill my self esteem again, while doing that.

But I feel empty. Can't focus on my studies. Can't sleep more than 5 hours. Every morning after waking up, all those sad thoughts plays into my mind.

Don't know when I can focus on my studies. I have GATE studies 🙂. Semester is near.

It feels so much unfair , she knows more than anyone the type of person I am . She herself said, you're handsome, kind .. like every girl's dream. WE both treated each other like lovers, and now this ? had feelings for me in September but not in October? She promised me to always be with me, support me even when I gave her the option to leave me alone. But now I can't hate her bcz of the tone of her text. And I am left broken once again when now even a year has passed I was betrayed and now feel maybe I am not a person worth fighting for. ",1,1729327963.0,AskIndia,2,1.0,False

1g74ovw,https://www.reddit.com/r/nairobi/comments/1g74ovw/update_nataka_kugusa_murima_tena/,Update: Nataka kugusa murima tena,"I don't know if y'all remember a post I did in this community talking about how I had been in constant communication with my murima ex and we had decided to meet on Saturday to spend the whole day together. Well, here's the update...

So, we finally did meet... I had planned a good day for us. Started with coffee hapo Mint and Salt, then headed to Ol Donyo Sabuk for a hike and picnic at its summit. I knew that would take the better part of the day and give us time to talk. We did talk, well, tbh, I did talk... A lot. I was excited about the day, and about her of course. She was wearing these jeans that really bring out her figure, her hair was in a bun exposing her big forehead that I love so much, and for once she was walking in tandem with me not trying to outwalk me. Perfect. I knew what would get her talking so I was okay with being the chatterbox at that moment. 

The picnic wasn't much. It was more of snacks so that we don't collapse and get mauled by the wild animals on our way down. I would have loved if we had stayed long enough to see the sunset over the undulating landscape of Nairobi and Thika(y'all should try Ol Donyo Sabuk btw, the trail is not too long, and the views are quite nice, and it's close to Nairobi) but I knew we needed to have a good meal somewhere. 

You see, I love hikes and nature walks. She doesn't. But if I am going to spend a whole day with someone, on my bill,  then trust me to sneak in activities that interest me. The hike was one of those. One thing I know, however, is that this woman loves food. And cocktails. I wanted a place that would have both, and still have something that I'd love doing. I'd gone to Fun City Utawala a while back but hadn't tried the rides yet. I knew that the food and cocktails are great. And one added bonus was that it was close to my place, I stay in Utawala. Unaona strategy. Most people while outside think that that ride that rotates vertically as your seats rotate on their axis(can't remember it's name) is the scary one, but have you tried that ""banana ride""? Nothing beats seeing the ground coming up to meet you fast, over and over again. So, guess what we did as we waited for our food to get ready. You are right😅😅. 

I know you are wondering why I'm giving you the minute details of the day. I need you to understand my decision at the end of this post. 

Food was ready, we decided to eat it at the main building. We had the option of the rooftop or their lounge, we chose the lounge since it's a bit private and she likes playing footsie(huyu ni mwanamke najua vizuri sana), also we could order the cocktails from there without needing to move. Once she eats and sips her drink she gets chatty. I ask her about what happened to her friends(she had this clique of friends back then that I never liked but that's a story for another day), two moved abroad, one is married and she fell out with her best friend. Carol, her best friend, is someone I remember very well. If she had said I'm not cute I'd not have dated this woman. She had the power. Of course, I was shocked to hear they had a falling out and I asked what happened. Waaahh... Turns out, a few weeks after me, remember Kitale (refer to my previous post), my ex started dating this guy who was friends with Carol and then almost at the same time Carol started dating this guy's friend. Long story short, waligongania😅. So they all broke up, ubeshte ukaisha hadi. 

A few months later the 2 ladies make up again, talking about we can't let men separate us and shiii. By this time each of them is dating different people. They are happy in their relationships. Guess what happened after a few weeks. Wakagongania tena😅😅😅. By this time, my flabbers are ghasted. I'm asking her who was starting these kugongania things, she tells me that in Kitale it was Carol who did it first so she(my ex) was only retaliating. The second time my ex did it first(yeye si mtu wa kushindwa) and Carol retaliated and went ahead and added my ex's brother as a bonus😅😅😅. Wueeehhh. We are now on the third cocktail. Then I ask her what she did after Carol pita'd with her bae and brother, you know what she said? Since Carol doesn't have a brother, my ex knows her(Carol's) childhood friend, a guy, they are really close... You can already guess what happened. The silver lining is that these cycles ended right after that. Or so she says. 

I did try to ask her if she's seeing anyone at the moment. That question was ignored each time I asked. Nikaachana nayo. In my mind I'd already decided that this wasn't going beyond that night. I can't have someone who would sleep with someone else for revenge. That's stupid. We took a few more cocktails as I tried to forget what the hell I'd just been told. There was no way I was taking this woman to my house. What if akatalie uko? Or she does this thing where she shows up randomly and uninvited? I couldn't have that. I am a man of nyadhi. 

There are beautiful Airbnbs in Utawala, the kind of beautiful you only see in the morning after you've slept with your ex. Only God knows how we got there. 

It's been a week since that ordeal, she's been texting me saying that she had a nice time last weekend. I don't think she remembers what she told me. I've since resumed ndoano with that single mom I told you guys about, at least she genuinely likes me for who I am, and of course for what I can become(potential father to her 3 year old daughter). Before I make any decision about dating, her and I must have a cocktail date. Na kugusa murima maybe nikitumia mti ya mop.",7,1729327698.0,nairobi,4,1.0,False

Hey there,

I’m a 42-year-old INFP from Nevada looking to connect with people who enjoy diving deep into conversations beyond small talk. If you value authenticity, introspection, and thinking for yourself, we might get along!

About Me:

Emotions are important to me—empathy, honesty, and real talk are my thing. I appreciate conversations where both sides feel understood.

Music is my life’s soundtrack—I’m into everything from In Flames, Aether Realm, and Blink-182 to Sum 41, Electric Callboy, Breathe Carolina, and Our Last Night. Lately, I’ve been listening to a lot of The Anix. Lyrics are like the subtitles to my experiences.

I enjoy deep conversations about life, exploring new ideas, and what makes people tick.

I’m a big fan of sci-fi, horror, and comedy—whether it’s the universe of Star Trek, the thrills of Evil, or the laughs from Shaun of the Dead, Cooties, and Zombieland. I also enjoy reading about and watching videos on the paranormal.

I’m fascinated by psychology and human behavior, always seeking new insights and challenging conventional thinking.

Nature provides moments of peace and reflection, even if I don’t get outdoors often.

Team Pepsi (though Dr Pepper’s my favorite), I love tea, hardly drink coffee, I’m team Star Trek, neither Democrat nor Republican, and I prefer Twizzlers over Red Vines. Now we’ve covered potential disagreements!

I tend to get along best with other INFPs and INFJs.


I don’t care about age—so if you’re a free thinker who doesn’t follow the crowd (for example, you’ll eat any food type for breakfast without a second thought), bring the peanut butter, and I’ll bring the bread. Let’s see if we can make something great together!

1g74okr,https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueOffMyChest/comments/1g74okr/confession_of_a_stepfather_my_obsession/,Confession of a Stepfather: My Obsession,"I never thought I’d be here, typing these words, revealing my most humiliating truths to the faceless depths of the internet. Yet here I am. I need to confess, to unload this weight, even if it's only to strangers who might understand.

She’s 22. I’m 50. She’s beautiful, like the girls who used to laugh at me when I was her age. I was invisible then, and I’m invisible now, even in my own home. My stepdaughter, *Emma*—not her real name, of course—she lives with me, and every day is torture. It’s like fate placed one of those untouchable girls right in front of me, dangling her presence just close enough for me to ache. She has no idea what she does to me, or maybe she does. Maybe that’s why she avoids me.

She’s everything I’m not—confident, vibrant, young. And me? I’m a ghost in my own house, an aging man with thinning hair and a gut that doesn’t disappear no matter how hard I try. Every look from her is dismissive, cold, like she knows. Like she *knows* I want to fall at her feet, that I would give anything to worship her. And that’s where the shame starts to bubble up.

I don’t want her to love me. No, it’s not like that. What I want is darker, more pathetic. I want her to *use* me. I want her to treat me like I’m less than nothing. She could command me to do anything, and I would. I dream about it—her ordering me to fetch her coffee, to carry her bags, to do whatever demeaning task she could think of just to see that look of disdain in her eyes. That’s what drives me crazy. It’s not just about her beauty, though that certainly doesn’t help. It’s the way she holds herself, like she’s untouchable, like I’m beneath her. And in many ways, I am.

There’s something inside me that craves it—her power over me. The idea of submitting to her, of being nothing more than her servant, her plaything... it haunts me. And I know I’m not alone. There are others like me, older men who see the younger women in their lives—stepdaughters, nieces, coworkers—and feel this same sick, twisted need to serve. I know what you’re thinking. How pathetic. And you’re right. It is pathetic. I am pathetic.

But that doesn’t stop the fantasies. It doesn’t stop the gnawing need to be humiliated by her, to be reminded every day that I am worthless, that I exist only to serve someone as perfect as her. Every time she walks past me, every time she ignores me, it feels like a slap in the face. And God, I wish she would actually slap me, just to acknowledge I exist.

I want to send this confession out into the void, hoping that maybe, just maybe, other men will understand what I’m going through. I want to hear from you—older men who feel the same thing. How do you cope? How do you live with this consuming need to submit to someone who would never even look at you twice?

I don’t know how this ends. I don’t know if I’ll ever tell her. Maybe she already knows, and that’s why she treats me like I’m beneath her. And maybe that’s exactly what I deserve.",0,1729327666.0,TrueOffMyChest,0,0.5,False

Do not go in if you are Indian! 

The freckle faced lady who was serving,was pretty rude.I stepped in and asked for a coffee..she said it is 300 fils(apparently she perceived that as a luxury for me; Since I was dying for a cup of coffee,it was more of a necessity and I am capable of paying that by the grace of God). Very strong racist vibes right there.
Once she came back with the coffee, I asked her if I can do benefit pay and she started lecturing me on how benefit pay number and QR code is already there and I should have paid even before my 300 fills coffee came to me- as if I am guilty of some grave crime...and I will never forget how she treated me like I am some con artist.

And the 300 fills coffee which was served in a cup of gold(jk) was simply the worst;I wanted coffee for waking up my senses,not for numbing them any further.Plus,the bitter taste of hate still lingers in my mouth.
(Besides I keep asking myself why I drank that coffee when I have heard numerous nightmare -inducing stories of kitchen staff messing with the food)

1g74l7r,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskWomenNoCensor/comments/1g74l7r/scared_of_dating_dishonest_men/,Scared of dating dishonest men,"Recently, I (19F) overheard a conversation at my local coffee shop that left me feeling so icky. A group of men were discussing whether they should tell the women they were dating if they’d ever been to a prostitute. Without hesitation, they all agreed they wouldn’t, laughing about it like it was no big deal. Am I crazy or isn't this really worrying??? To me, this is a MASSIVE violation of trust. Whether it’s women or anyone else, there are boundaries that people have every right to set in their relationships. For some, the idea of dating someone who’s been to a prostitute crosses a line they simply aren’t comfortable with. It’s not about being judgmental. It’s about personal values and MORALS. I’m one of those people. I wouldn’t want to date someone who’s done that. What’s even scarier is how common this seems to be apparently?? So many men visit prostitutes and then lie to the women they date about it. How can you build trust with someone if they’re hiding something so significant? It makes me question how many people are walking around with secrets that could affect their relationships, all because they’re too selfish or too dismissive to be honest.

Thankfully, I’m also into women, so my dating pool is broader, but I'd still like to date guys without worrying about this you know? There’s something really unsettling about knowing that dishonesty around this issue is so normalized. It’s not just about the act itself, it’s also about the deception and the way these guys laughed it off like it didn’t matter. What do you guys think? I don't want to cut out dating men once and for all, but I don't know how else to navigate this.",1,1729327237.0,AskWomenNoCensor,24,0.54,False

1g74kop,https://www.reddit.com/r/exmormon/comments/1g74kop/returning_and_reporting_after_a_byu_football_game/,Returning and reporting after a BYU football game,"My father-in-law gave us tickets to the BYU vs OSU game tonight and I took my kid. I didn’t attend BYU but have been to 1 or 2 games over the years since my in-laws are huge fans and always have tickets. 

A few things that struck me tonight as an exmo:

- first off, it was a great game. Super entertaining and exactly the kind of football you hope for when you’re sitting on freezing bleachers till near mid-night. 
- thank the lord they sell caffeine now. I would’ve preferred some hot coffee, but I was happy to at least have fountain coke. Crazy they sell it at BYU now. 
- WTF is up with cougar tails?? $15 bucks for a cold, foot long maple bar donut that tastes worse than a store bought from Maceys, but ppl rave about them
- I was surprised at how many African American players are on the team now. Last time I looked at BYU they had a bunch of Polynesian players and maybe 1 or 2 black players. It seemed like at least half the players were black or brown and, after looking at the roster, it seems many of them aren’t LDS? This was especially interesting to see after just finishing the book 2nd class saints and hearing Harold Lee say he’d “shut BYU down” before letting the Fed Gov force him to actively recruit “negroes.”
- the prayer at the beginning so so jarring and awkward. They went straight from blasting “Hypnotize” by Biggie to an extremely Utah Mormon dude giving a prayer complete with all the 16th-century English and being grateful for the “Atonement” …and then there was awkward clapping right after - so bizarre.
- On the topic of rap, I love that they played (a heavily edited version of) “Goodmorning” by Kanye and blasted the lines “they tell you ‘read this, eat this, don’t look around, just peep this, preach this, teach us-Jesus. Okay, look up now, they done stole your streetness” - which ironically, is EXACTLY what BYU is doing
- sitting in front of two ultra-TBM boomer guys who were delusional, but also kind of adorable with lines like “c’mon Lord, help your team out” and (after BYU won with one minute left) “that was a miracle, that proves there’s a God”
- finally, they do a great job with Cosmo and all the fan service and pageantry. It’s easy to sit in those bleachers and look around and feel like being a part of “the church” is something special. I think it’s one of the places where theyre still really killing it from a culture building perspective when so much of the other fun cultural elements have been stripped out over the years.

1g74ge3,https://www.reddit.com/r/friendship/comments/1g74ge3/looking_for_intelligent_friends_who_arent_afraid/,Looking for intelligent friends who aren't afraid of feelings.,"Hey there,

I’m a 42-year-old INFP from Nevada looking to connect with people who enjoy diving deep into conversations beyond small talk. If you value authenticity, introspection, and thinking for yourself, we might get along!

About Me:

Emotions are important to me—empathy, honesty, and real talk are my thing. I appreciate conversations where both sides feel understood.

Music is my life’s soundtrack—I’m into everything from In Flames, Aether Realm, and Blink-182 to Sum 41, Electric Callboy, Breathe Carolina, and Our Last Night. Lately, I’ve been listening to a lot of The Anix. Lyrics are like the subtitles to my experiences.

I enjoy deep conversations about life, exploring new ideas, and what makes people tick.

I’m a big fan of sci-fi, horror, and comedy—whether it’s the universe of Star Trek, the thrills of Evil, or the laughs from Shaun of the Dead, Cooties, and Zombieland. I also enjoy reading about and watching videos on the paranormal.

I’m fascinated by psychology and human behavior, always seeking new insights and challenging conventional thinking.

Nature provides moments of peace and reflection, even if I don’t get outdoors often.

Team Pepsi (though Dr Pepper’s my favorite), I love tea, hardly drink coffee, I’m team Star Trek, neither Democrat nor Republican, and I prefer Twizzlers over Red Vines. Now we’ve covered potential disagreements!

I tend to get along best with other INFPs and INFJs.

1g74gdg,https://www.reddit.com/r/managers/comments/1g74gdg/lost_trust/,Lost trust,"So i am a GM for a smaller business, 30-40 employees between 8 stores in multiple adjacent counties

After about 5-6 years, mainly around covid, i developed a bond, or at least what i thought was, with one of my county managers. During covid we all know things got boring, to keep staff close we would send each other meme vids(links only, never followed each other on social), funny meme pics etc all after work hours..   
That grew into her confiding in me about family, me giving her advice, etc and me vice versa but prob not as deep, some via text (yeah i know better). Its never been anything sexual or intimate, never invited her for drinks, dinner or even coffee etc.

Couple years later time she becomes pregnant( not me, some local trust fund dude she met while working at one of our shops), her productivity falls off ten fold, we find out about the pregnancy, we reassure her, we will make it work along the way due to her years of work, which is what she told us she wants. That she wants to continue even after she gives birth.

So come 2 weeks in after that talk, and she begins to withhold info any GM should know, hormones i guess, she deliberately didn't write staff up to protect them, we write her up for a major, 2 weeks later, does the same, this time she also lies in my face about giving a verbal warning to an employee(she admits to she lied in to me straight up). Owner is made aware and talks to her being we terminate on 3rd write ups, and decides its the hormones and we need to give her a chance after 7 years of service(she was manager for 5 years).

I trusted her to get the job done, and she improved work wise after the 2 major write ups. Where the debacle starts, being we audio record everything on the sales floor(Legal where i am to do so)( for customer and employee protection as we have had both customers and employees make wild accusations)funny, which was kind of her job to check on staff remotely at other shops.  i happen to listen to her tell multiple new employees personal/business things, where for years she's told me the complete opposite.  before that I had a small 5% of trust within me before reviewing footage, hoping to rebuild it. 

At this point, i lost all trust and will not talk anything personal anymore, and haven't brought it up to her or owner. But she is the manager below me, and any leader needs to trust the person below them to execute all task, without having any ounce of doubt there will be lies or deception.

i am conflicted, cause she seems to be getting the task done, but there's that voice in the back of my head telling me to be careful and check her work, which just defies her whole role, which is to manage task i need off my plate so i can focus on bigger picture for the company. 

So what would yall do? its been months since the 2nd write up.   
Give owner ultimatum?

So I've been having bad stomach issues for a few weeks, and I have gained 11lbs in weight in the space of 3 weeks. 

I'm suffering from constipation. I normally poop several times a day, but I had been doing once for a few weeks, and they were not properly formed. Type 5-6. I was in pain where I needed to poo more, but it wasn't coming out

For a couple of weeks, I have been drinking green tea, espresso coffee shots, having gut cleanse tablets, dgl liquorice tablets, chewing ginger, drinking apple cider vinegar etc to try and help, and it has been helping me. I've also taken laxatives a couple of times too. 

On Monday this week, I decided to cut out wheat and dairy temporarily to see if it made a difference. 

I've suffered with bloating since I was a teenager, and have issues with IBS, but I also have two forms of kidney disease too, and have been on a number of tablets over the years. I know that this is nothing to do with my kidney condition. 

But for the last few weeks, I have had the bloating worse than ever, blinding headaches, severe dizziness, constipation, diarrhea, my stomach feels lumpy, feeling the cold even more than usual, nausea, appetite is lower etc.  

I'm still going to the gym, and exercising as much as I was before. I've cut my portions, and it's not helping with the weight issue. I've been exercising when I've been dizzy, which I know is not sensible. 

I should mention that I have previously lost nearly 11 stone in weight naturally too. 

I'm just posting asking for advice, because I'm scared. ",1,1729325872.0,ibs,0,1.0,False
1g74acg,https://www.reddit.com/r/Manipulation/comments/1g74acg/am_i_being_manipulated/,Am I being manipulated ,"I (Male 21) been friends with this girl (22) on and off for 3 or so years. We both would get each other mad and we stop talking. She ended up moving to another state. Two reasons, one for her mental health, and she got the opportunity to watch a family members kid. About a year ago, one of us reached out to the other person (I don't remember but in the past, we both would reach out) and we apologized for our actions (nothing crazy, I was bad at understanding how my actions effected how others felt and she would handle things in an immature way imo) and we started being friends again. We would talk like once a week give or take. Felt like responses would take a while sometimes and I was told she just is busy. At this point in time, I didn't have feelings for her so I wasn't upset by it. Over time, we ended up getting closer and talked more often. I ended up developing feelings and expressed it to her. I was essentially told no at the time because she lived across the country and I'm friends with her ex. I didn't ask her out exactly but you get the idea. July/August she ends up moving back to Florida (where I live) and we hung out a lot. She literally would ask me to hang out 3 times in a week. Just with timing it didn't really workout too often. There was one day I remember waking up to a text saying she was coming over in 30 minutes and having lunch at my place (we work at a fast food restaurant). This is all very new to me, never have I had a girl just tell me she is coming over. We do end up hanging out a few more times. I was taking some PTO when she first got hired. Once I came back, we worked a few shifts together. (For context, 4 years ago, we worked at the same restaurant, I ended up transferring to another store and she applied to the store I work at now, her main concern was not getting involved in drama again). I gave her a heads up on people she should avoid if she doesn't want to get involved in drama. Joe was someone I told her is someone she really should avoid, he has a history of using women and just trying to sleep with them and he's super good at getting girls to do whatever he wants. She understood and I didn't think too much of it. One day Joe is at work and she is working that night. The girl and I are messing around with each other throughout the shift and at the end, I could tell something was super off. She got very short with me and she left very quickly after work. We usually hang out after for a bit and we would hug each other bye and it was really out of the ordinary. Turns out, Joe mentioned it looked like we were flirting. The girl and I ended up talking about everything and expressed she just wants to keep our friendship outside of work. She doesn't want to be seen as the ""flirt"" at work. I do eventually end up accepting it but we did end up having an argument over it but it was resolved very quickly. We still hung out but it definitely wasn't as often and I felt I had to initiate us hanging out more often than before. We still talked every single day. She would constantly complain to me how rumors are spreading that she wants to date Joe and she hates that. Like I would hear her complain to me every other day. Eventually, one day we are talking and she mentions we need to get coffee together sometime. I take the initiative and make plans that Sunday. We ended up sitting and talking for hours and that's when I started getting super strong feelings for her. Again during this ""date"" she mentioned she wants nothing to do with Joe without me really even having to ask. We were talking about relationships in general and boundaries on dating coworkers. After that, things just felt really odd between us. We still talked but I really don't know how to describe it, just something seemed weird. Bunch of other little small stuff of us running into each other and one day she hit me with ""im trying to avoid hanging out one on one with guys"". Turns out literally while she is messaging me, she is meeting up with Joe. From what she eventually told me they met up to ""discuss on how to address the rumors at work"". I ended up not talking to her for a couple days just because I needed space to clear my head. We ended up getting into a huge ass argument where she is convincted I'm telling ppl at work she is hanging out with Joe. I thought we ended the argument on good terms but I could tell immediately something was off. I felt she was being extremely short with me on everything. Then suddenly one day she ends up blocking me, Joe, and Joe's ex on social media (they are still having sex but aren't dating). Next couple days are just weird. She ends up getting upset because I talked to Joe's ex and she texted me asking if I was talking to her. I ignored it. Next day she ends up texting me again saying she needs to eventually talk to me. I end up finally replying the next day saying our relationship is extremely important and I do not want to lose it again, and if we are going to talk and work things out, we will need to talk in person. She agrees and says she will lmk when she is ready. She tells me she is going through a lot of stress and needs space from everybody. As far as I am currently aware, the girl and Joe and no longer hanging out and she still has him blocked. I've been friends with her before and I feel like she got manipulated herself into believing I was not her friend because Joe does this kind of thing. So in my heart, I want to trust her and believe her but my friends are all telling me I'm the one being manipulated in this situation and need to drop her out of my life.

1g74a88,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1g74a88,6 months of aggravated veins,"I woke up about 6 months ago to very red eyes - mostly small veins that were now visible and prominent. I had relatively clear eyes with hardly any vessels showing before so it was very noticeable when I woke up to my eyes looking like this. I’ve been to the ophthalmologist 3 times (2 different ones) and on the last visit in June she said I have a bit of dry eyes (yes she said “a bit”). She put temporary punctual plugs in my tear ducts and told me to take dry eye plus supplements and Artelac preservative free single dose drops. I try to be consistent with them but they can be quite pricey. Before all of that I tried the usual eye drops but left them when I could see there was no improvement and to also not cause rebound redness. 

I have stopped drinking coffee, alcohol, drinking much more water and trying all the methods I’ve been given. Sunglasses outside, limit screen time. Cold and hot compresses but I am truly at my wits end. To the point that it has put a knock to my self esteem. There is even some discolouration now. Other conditions were ruled out. I wear glasses that have that blue lense/tint and I have never worn contacts as my eyes are not too bad (I can go sometimes without wearing my glasses)
Does this ever get better? Do I have to accept that my eyes will always look like this? Should I get another opinion? 

There are some days where they look better than others but the veins have basically taken over my sclera. Even at the bottom of my eyes. It is just baffling to me that something can change so easily overnight - I even remember the day. 

Does anyone have any advice or tips that I may have overlooked? Maybe even diet or a vitamin that I should consider.

I’m really worried about my blood orange tree. I accidentally put coffee grounds in the soil, and it attracted some small bugs. I didn’t notice the problem until it was too late, and now there are dead branches.

On a positive note, I can see some new green branches and leaves growing, but I’m still anxious about its health. I’ve already replaced the soil with citrus soil, and I haven’t seen any bugs lately, but there’s some amber-looking residue on the tree.

What can I do to help my tree recover? Should I use any specific fertilizers? I love this tree dearly; I got the seed from Italy, and it has been growing for about three years.

Thank you for your help!

I’m looking to switch to a bottomless filter with a non pressurised basket, that’s 51mm with 2 ears (similar to the one in the photo)

However given that it’s not a commonly used machine here, the compatible portafilter is hard to come by, it’s not available on the usual coffee equipment sites nor can I find one on Amazon that isn’t being imported. 

Is anyone over here aware of where I can find one? Or is my best bet to get friends/family to pick it up from abroad/calling from eBay?",3,1729325583.0,IndiaCoffee,0,1.0,False

At bleak round tables.
When I asked you what you would have done differently.
“Military,” you say.
I hold my tongue but think louder than any words could speak.

O’ ill-fated love, how you would have been the perfect soldier:
Your lack of empathy.
Your willingness to follow orders.
Your blackened childhood.
                  How rage was the first person to cradle you in her arms and tell you it’s alright.

But God struck you down- as always.
Diabetic, anemic- you bleed substanceless, thin.

                  O’ ill-fated insulin love, how you could have been the perfect soldier.

But you aren’t.
For the same reasons that no one is.
You are still human.

Ignore the rest… 


They met on a rainy afternoon in a crowded café, both seeking shelter from the storm. She was absorbed in her book, a quiet escape from the world, while he nervously sipped his coffee, stealing glances her way. When their eyes finally met, it was as if the noise around them faded. He smiled, she smiled back—simple, warm, and shy.

Days turned into weeks, and their encounters became frequent. They shared stories over cappuccinos and laughter over pastries, slowly peeling back the layers of each other’s hearts. Their connection felt effortless, like they’d known each other in another life.

One evening, under the glow of the streetlights, he confessed his feelings. His words were quiet but full of certainty. She looked at him, her heart swelling, and took his hand. In that moment, the world felt still, and the storm that had once brought them together seemed a distant memory.

They knew they had found something rare—love that felt like coming home.",2,1729325427.0,SFWr4rIndia,0,1.0,False
