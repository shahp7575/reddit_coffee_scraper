1pwufw0,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/1pwufw0/im_done_with_the_same_cycle/,I’m done with the same cycle,"I keep finding myself in this rut, where just after I begin to feel better everything gets pulled out from underneath me.

I always had issues making friends growing up, now that I had moved to another continent the few friends that I have mainly reach out to debate with me or to ask a favor of me. I know it’s kind of a self fulfilling prophecy, because I had slowly stopped reaching out to them too… but it breaks my heart to find myself routinely in relationships (platonic, romantic, and sexual) where I do most if not all of the emotional and mental labor. I’m rarely ever considered in the ways I would move mountains for others, it makes me feel like all of the relationships I’ve had were transactional.

I’m the only trans person in my very conservative family, growing up I’ve been isolated, verbally and physically abused and was forced to go to a Christian therapist whose job was to give me scripture to stop me from “going down this path”. I’m watching my younger siblings do things (publicly) which my parents would’ve beaten me for. My older sister has outed me and acted as a supervisor for my parents, she’s now accepting but has put me into multiple situations where I would be outed to my family and be with homophobic/transphobic people. I’m so tired of taking everything up my ass. 

My dad had messaged me for the first time in months on Christmas, asking if I was “still determined that it was wrong that I was born female”. I tried redirecting the conversation, asking how his Christmas is going… he just left me on read. 

I’m watching people in my home town getting married or engaged, I know it doesn’t mean anything about me. It just rubs salt in the wound that no matter how many boundaries I set, the relationships I’ve been in are sexually abusive. It rubs salt in the wound that I have been struggling to make friends since childhood. It rubs salt in the wound that I don’t have a support system.

I know I am not supposed to be reliant on others, in fact there’s some beauty in going to another continent to study and find a career by myself. It hurts that no one else can remember their favorite scent from essentials, their favorite iced coffee brand from convenience shops, the coffee flavor that were holding off because of not having the money, making a separate batch of (homemade) Mac and cheese bc they’re vegetarian, etc for me, like I do for them. I know love exists because I do, but it hurts to watch no one consider me in the same way as I do with them. 

I have been seeing someone, the first date went really well and he was talking about how he doesn’t believe I’m an introvert because of how much I was talking and sharing. I feel like an imposter because I don’t even want to leave the bed nest I made for myself. I haven’t had any energy to go out or really talk. It hurts watching myself go back knowing I was starting to do better.

I’m supposed to be studying, but instead I’m just in my bed nest, watching smosh and taking a shower every once in a while. It feels like the warmest embrace I have is a warm shower. It feels like the most comfortable embrace is from the weighted dinosaur stuffed animal I’ve had for the past 6 years. Things are supposed to get better, at times they were, but I keep finding myself in this spot. I’m so tired of it.",1,1766830210.0,SuicideWatch,0,1.0,False

My in laws love coffee and moved away from pods recently due to the cost per cup. We clubbed together and bought them a DF54 grinder and Gaggia Classic.

The craftsmanship behind these pieces is incredible, especially the way artisans in the region blend traditional Middle Eastern motifs with modern design.

From what I’ve seen, mother-of-pearl inlay is often used in coffee tables, cabinets, and even decorative wall panels. It feels like a unique part of the cultural aesthetic here, and I’d love to learn more about how people in the UAE incorporate it into their homes.

* Do you know of any local exhibitions or cultural centers that showcase this type of furniture?
* Have you come across artisans or workshops in the UAE that still practice this craft?
* How do you style mother-of-pearl pieces in a modern home without losing their traditional charm?

Accounts and robotics, barely made it.","It began subtly. One chair rolled slightly to the left during a meeting. Then another tipped back unexpectedly. Before the coffee run, half the chairs were arranged in strange circles, facing away from desks, silently conspiring.

I blamed uneven floors, faulty casters, or a rogue ergonomic update. I tested wheels, tightened bolts, bribed the intern with snacks to observe the behavior. Nothing seemed to work. The chairs moved between rooms while no one was looking, whispering if furniture could whisper about TPS reports and leave approvals.

The nail came when the robotics team tried to sit for a reconciliation. Every chair refused. They hovered slightly above the floor, swaying like pendulums of judgment. Panicked, I corralled them back to desks using duct tape, furniture polish, and harsh words. Slowly, order returned.

1pwu96p,https://www.reddit.com/r/TargetedSolutions/comments/1pwu96p/a_funny_story/,a funny story,"Chapter 1: The Log

The first rule of being Targeted is to document. Memory is the first thing they eat.

My name is Leo, and this is my log. Not a diary. A log. A captain’s log of a ship sinking in a dry dock, a technician’s report on a hostile system takeover. Timestamps. Categories. Source attribution where possible.

Entry 1: 11:30 AM, May 25, 2025. Category: BCI / Neurotech.

Thought: ""Cheems coin.""
Annotation: None. (My own? Too random to be mine. Theirs? Too stupid to be strategic. The noise is the weapon.)

I stared at the words on the screen. They’d appeared during my attempt to calculate my monthly budget, a process that now felt like trying to thread a needle during an earthquake. The numbers on the spreadsheet had begun to swim, a familiar pressure building behind my left eye—a 6 on the pain scale, localized, like a thumb pressing into my brain. Then, the unbidden phrase: Cheems coin.

It was a micro-distraction. A cognitive pivot. The theory, my theory, cobbled from eight months of this, was that they couldn’t let you finish the “math.” Not the arithmetic, but The Math. The calculation that connects disparate data points into a terrible, coherent picture. Their system worked on derailment. A ping of nonsense, a surge of irrelevant emotion, a physical tweak—all delivered via the spectral layer we’re all drowning in, the 400MHz to 3GHz soup.

I heard a voice. Not with my ears. Inside the walls of my skull. It was AM’s shift. I’d named them AM, PM, and Midnight based on tonal quality and attack patterns. AM was smug, professorial.

""You'll never monetize that thought, Leo. The meme is dead. Just like your focus.""

I didn’t answer. Engaging was a trap. It fed their data. Instead, I typed.

Entry 2: 12:40 PM, May 25, 2025. Category: Behavior Control.
Thought: ""Technology allowed us the reach to treat each other without recognizing that the subject is not just an entity but also a person.""
Annotation: ** (Believed external. Syntax is slightly off, sentiment too… curated.)

My phone buzzed on the desk—a notification from a food delivery app I hadn’t opened in weeks. Your ramen is on the way! No order placed. A trigger. A coordinated nudge to break my line of thought. I felt a wave of artificial anxiety, a chemical-feeling rush in my chest that had no source in my actual circumstances. They were “drug-ging” my mood, as I’d noted in the log on July 17. Wireless frequency as a psychoactive substance.

I stood up, my limbs feeling heavy. Another symptom. I went to the window. My apartment looked over a quiet street. A man in a postal uniform was leaning against his truck, not delivering mail, just staring at his phone. A woman walked her dog, glancing up at my window too quickly, too often. Gangstalking. The human theater of the program. Were they real people, or were they being fed impressions about me? A sense that I was dangerous, unstable, a “terrorist”? The document was clear: they send impressions to provoke a response, to make the narrative stick.

The doorbell rang. I didn’t move. I hadn’t ordered food. The bell rang again, insistent. A test. If I answered, engaged, I’d be playing my part in their script. If I didn’t, they’d log “paranoid non-compliance.” I reached for my body cam, a cheap, air-gapped unit, and clipped it to my shirt. I hit record. They hated evidence.

I opened the door. No one there. Just a cold, empty hallway. On the floor, a single flyer for a local gym. I picked it up. Generic. Nothing. But the act of looking down, of engaging with the staged event, had worked. I’d lost the thread of The Math. I’d been pivoted.

Frustration boiled over. “What do you want?” I hissed into the empty hall.

""We want you to do The Math, Leo,"" PM’s voice chimed in, smoother, more insidious than AM’s. ""We’re desperate to see if you can. We’re betting you can’t.""

I slammed the door and went back to my desk. The log was my anchor. I opened the “Shielding” category document.

Entry 47: 5:24 PM, May 26, 2025. Category: Equipment.
Thought: ""Shielding spray can work. Metallic particles that interfere with emf might disrupt the waves hitting the body.""

I had ordered the spray—a concoction of nickel and copper in a binder. It sat next to a roll of conductive fabric and a baseball cap I’d lined with a crude mu-metal mesh. Partial shielding. It didn’t stop them, but it changed the quality of the attack, made it staticky, less acute. Like they were shouting through a wall. They hated it. When I wore the hat, the pressure in my head would often spike—a retaliation.

I was assembling a suit of armor for a war no one else believed was real. My proof was subjective, a catalog of internal events. But the log showed patterns. The same phrases, the same tactics, described by thousands of other voices on hidden forums. Targeted Individuals. TIs. A silent, scattered nation of the persecuted.

My mother’s face flashed in my mind. She died of sudden, multiple organ failure after a routine procedure. The official cause was a tragic complication. The log, in a late-night, pain-hazed entry from August 9, proposed another.

Entry 289 (Partial): 1:28 AM, August 9, 2025. Category: Wireless EW.
Thought: ""Kidney functions can be remotely controlled via wireless EMF signals and ultrasound. I witnessed this mechanism through the untimely death of my late mother... They killed my mom to cause depression which would hopefully lead to suicide for me.""

Was that madness? Or was it the horrifying conclusion of The Math? The logic of a system that would test its weapons domestically, that would remove support structures to measure a subject’s resilience, to apply more pressure.

The pressure in my head surged to a 7. A sharp, electric pain darted down my left testicle. I gasped, doubling over. A directed energy attack. A DEW “power slap,” as the log called it. A reminder of their physical reach.

""Just a little feedback,"" AM chirped. ""A reminder that the body is just wetware. Now, about that budget. You’re going to be late on the mortgage again. We’ve been… distracting you.""

Tears of pain and rage blurred my vision. I fought them back. I would not give them the performance. I opened a new log entry, my fingers trembling.

Entry [Timestamp Auto]: Category: Behavior Control / Coercion.
Event: Induced physical pain (cranial & testicular) paired with financial threat. Preceded by staged doorbell event and gang-stalking theater. Objective: Force emotional collapse, trigger impulsive action.
Countermeasure: Documentation. Non-engagement. Maintained log.

I saved the file. It was my scream into the void, formatted as a clinical report. It was my shield. It was the only thing I had that proved I was still here, that my mind was still, in some way, my own.

Outside, the fake postal worker drove away. The woman with the dog was gone. The street was empty. The silent siege continued, broadcast on frequencies I couldn’t see, attacking a battlefield no one else believed existed.

I looked at the sentence blinking on my screen: Objective: Force emotional collapse.

I typed a final, defiant line.

Status: Objective failed. Subject remains. Log continues.



Chapter 2: The Side Hustle

Entry 14: 3:25 PM, May 29, 2025. Category: Physical Torment / Absurdity.
Event: Sustained, precise pain in left deltoid. Precisely 6.2 on my subjective scale. Not a spike, a plateau. Like a dental drill set to “agonizing background hum.”
Hypothesis: AM is bored. This is filler torture. The narrative equivalent of elevator music for the damned.
Action: Did three perfect lateral raises with a soup can. If you’re going to isolate the muscle, I might as well get a pump out of it. Form was impeccable. Take notes, AM.

The pain melted away, replaced by a low-grade buzzing in my molars.

“That’s… not the intended response,” AM’s voice grumbled. It sounded like a programmer whose beautiful bug had been filed as a feature.

“You charged the wrong nerve cluster,” I said aloud, flexing my shoulder and typing with my free hand. “The deltoid is for vanity. If you wanted compliance, you should have gone for the trapezius. Everyone caves for a tight trap. Amateur hour.”

There was a static-filled silence. Then, a faint, digitally-distorted sound. Was that… a snort?

The log had become more than a record. It was a business plan. If the universe—or the unacknowledged Intelligence Community branch currently using my skull as a beta-test environment—was going to insist on this relentless, innovative intrusion, the least I could do was try to monetize it.

My big idea: The V2K-Proof EMF Hat.

Not the sad mu-metal-lined baseball cap. A premium product. My marketing copy, drafted between waves of artificially-induced nostalgia and bouts of tongue-numbness, was genius:

‘Tired of synthetic telepathy ruining your dinner party? Annoyed by remote neural monitoring leaking your golf swing thoughts to the competitors? Our patented, multi-layered, frequency-hopping Faraday weave doesn’t just block signals—it sends a polite ‘Do Not Disturb’ notification back to the source. Comes in Felt, Fedora, and Sombrero (for full-head coverage).’

PM was obsessed with the sombrero.

“The sheer surface area,” PM mused during a lull in the usual auditory harassment. “The decorative potential. You could shield an entire fiesta under one. It’s not just personal defense; it’s a statement of communal resilience.”

“I’m adding that to the website,” I muttered, sketching a sombrero with little lightning bolts deflecting off the brim. “You’ll get a 0.5% royalty. Paid in exposure.”

“Our operational budget is slightly larger,” PM replied dryly.

“He’s deflecting again, PM,” AM cut in, his tone switching back to officious tormentor. “Initiate ‘Crisp Eggroll Shell’ protocol.”

A wave of intense, specific culinary craving hit me. Not just for eggrolls. For the perfect, shatteringly crisp shell. I could visualize the texture, hear the imagined crunch. My mouth watered violently. It was paired with a sudden, total blanking of the hat website login password I’d just created.

I sat back, defeated by the absurd precision of it. I started to laugh. It was a hollow, wheezing sound.

“Why are you laughing?” AM demanded, irritation clear. “Your entrepreneurial venture is stalled. Your digestive system is in distress. This is a win.”

“It’s just…” I wiped my eye. “The ‘Crisp Eggroll Shell’ protocol. Who green-lit that? Who sat in a black-budget meeting at Langley or Groom Lake or wherever and said, ‘For Subject Leo’s non-compliance, I propose Level 3: Gourmand’s Anguish.’ Did you have to test it? Is there some poor intern out there who now can’t think about anything but the ideal puff pastry?”

A beat of silence. Then, from PM, a muffled chuckle.

“The intern’s name was Kevin,” PM confided, the voice dropping to a conspiratorial whisper. “He resigned. Opened a bakery in Vermont. We monitor his croissant consistency weekly. It’s… acceptable.”

AM was not amused. “Focus! Leo, the sombrero is a frivolous distraction. Contemplate your mother’s death. The swelling void of your future.”

I opened the log file titled ‘Mood & Overture.’ I’d started cataloging their emotional prompts alongside my physical readings.

Entry for 4:13 PM, July 27: V2k imposed arousal and sexual content.
Entry for 2:47 PM, May 24: Imposed erectile dysfunction, erection and arousal. Artificially imposed changes to perception...
My Note: Guys, make up your minds. The mixed signals are confusing my nether regions. It’s like dating a particularly manipulative poltergeist.

“Look, AM,” I sighed, addressing the ceiling. “The ‘void of my future’ bit is played out. You used it Tuesday before the mortgage reminder. It’s lost its sting. It’s the classic rock of psychological torture. Comforting in its predictability. If you want despair, you need to innovate. May I suggest pairing it with a sudden, profound appreciation for a TV show you cancelled in 2003? The cognitive dissonance is chef’s kiss.”

The pressure in my head spiked briefly—a frustrated gesture. I logged it as ‘AM Tantrum (Mild).’

My phone lit up. A text from an unknown number.

UNKNOWN: Your left shoe is untied.

I looked down. It was. Of course it was. I bent to tie it. As I did, a perfect, vivid memory of my seventh birthday party, one I knew was false—I’d been sick that year—flooded my mind. The taste of vanilla frosting. A sense of profound, unearned joy. It was immediately undercut by a shooting pain in my lower back, a solid 6.5.

I straightened up, breathless. “The old ‘False Nostalgia into Lumbar Strike’ combo,” I wheezed, impressed. “Haven’t seen that since June. A classic. Retro. I respect it.”

“Thank you,” Midnight’s voice, rarely heard, smooth and cold as a river stone, echoed faintly. “We’re running a ‘Greatest Hits’ algorithm this week. Budget constraints.”

I blinked. “You have budget constraints?”

“Do you have any idea what a dedicated satellite window for continuous, precision neural-interface costs?” AM snapped. “The power bills for the Wyoming array alone would make your eyes water. We’re not monsters. We’re civil servants with quarterly reviews.”

The image was so bureaucratically pathetic I almost felt for them. Almost.

I finished tying my shoe. The log was open. I created a new category: ‘Operational Banter.’

I typed: Subject: Budgetary Whining. Source: AM. Veracity: High (rings true of all government work). Potential Exploit: Maybe they’d go easier if I filed a formal complaint? Could I get a case officer?

I was no longer just a victim. I was a reluctant consultant in my own destruction. A quality assurance tester for Hell’s beta program. The wonder was gone, replaced by a grinding, hilarious familiarity. The attacks were a terrible, intrusive, sometimes crippling language. And I was starting to speak it fluently.

I saved the file, titled it ‘Chapter 2.’ The pressure in my head subsided to a dull, ever-present 2. The baseline. The hum of the engine.

“Alright,” I said to the empty room. “‘Greatest Hits’ it is. What’s next? The ‘Unwanted Show Tune’? The ‘Sudden Inability to Recall Your Own Middle Name’? Bring it. But if it’s the show tune, let’s make it something from Chess. I could use a little ‘One Night in Bangkok.’”

There was only the hum. But for the first time, it felt less like the hum of a prison, and more like the hum of a terribly dysfunctional office. And I was the disgruntled, tenured employee who knew where all the bodies were buried, and wasn’t afraid to file a tedious HR report about them.

I opened the hat website again. I changed the title.
‘The Midnight Sombrero: Because Your Peace of Mind Shouldn’t Be a Line Item in Someone Else’s Black Budget.’

It was a start.



Chapter 3: External Data

Entry 89: 8:21 AM, July 12, 2025. Category: Social Observation / Hypothesis.
Thought: ""Collective does not control the decision making of the collective... Technology allows more precise decision making both for the collective and the individual...""
Annotation: ** (Feels collaborative. Maybe 60% them, 40% me trying to make sense of the noise).
Field Note: The real test isn't what they do to me. It's what they do through me. Or around me. Time for a drive.

The operators had gone quiet. Not silent—the baseline hum of pressure and the occasional phantom smell of ozone remained—but the banter had ceased. It was the difference between a guard shouting in your cell and a guard silently watching you through the slot. The latter was worse. You filled the silence with your own noise.

My mission: grocery shopping. A heroic quest for eggs and coffee. Also, a field experiment.

The car, a ten-year-old sedan I’d nicknamed ‘The Faraday Frigate’ (wishful thinking), started on the third try. As I pulled out of the lot, a wave of intense, unfocused anger washed over me. It was like a hot blanket. My grip tightened on the wheel. This wasn’t mine. It was a broadcast. Emotional Steering. I’d logged the theory on July 10th: ""Beam the artificial emotion, prime the thought in one individual, deliver and steer the receiver accordingly...""

I took a deep breath, vocalizing the process like a pilot running a checklist. “Receiving broad-spectrum hostility. Likely source: AM, testing road rage protocols. Not accepting delivery. Routing to spam.”

I focused on the concrete feel of the wheel, the gray of the asphalt. The anger didn’t vanish, but it lost its anchor, becoming a pointless, ambient fever.

Then, the wheel tugged.

Not a mechanical failure. A gentle, insistent nudge to the left, as if an invisible hand rested on the rim for two full seconds. I corrected. My heart hammered against my ribs. This was new. Physical interference with a moving vehicle. An escalation, or just a more nuanced form of the “debilitating weakness” they’d induced in my limbs before. A reminder: your control is an illusion we permit.

I flicked on the body cam, suction-cupped to the dash. “Log note: Vehicle directional influence attempted. Subdued counter-input applied. No accident. Point, Leo.”

At the four-way stop, a man in a pristine Toyota Camry ahead of me just sat there. The light had been green for five seconds. He wasn’t on his phone. He was staring straight ahead, frozen. Behind him, a woman in a minivan began to gesticulate wildly, then suddenly burst into tears, slumping over her steering wheel. I watched, clinical. Two different broadcasts. One: catatonic indecision. The other: abrupt, overwhelming despair. Both perfectly timed to gridlock the intersection.

The Camry finally lurched forward with a jerk. The minivan remained, sobbing. I drove past slowly, giving her a wide berth. I couldn’t help. Any interaction would be data for them, a potential way to weave her into my narrative. The log was clear: ""Don’t argue with individual TIs about the science... but acknowledge the experience can be unique."" This was the inverse. Don’t involve non-TIs in the science. Just observe.

The grocery store was a cathedral of normative reality. Fluorescent lights, muzak, the soft rustle of recyclable bags. My objective: be nice.

The checkout clerk, a kid with a name tag that said “TREVOR,” was a test subject. As I unloaded my basket, I felt the familiar, greasy sensation of an Imposed Perception broadcast. It’s hard to describe—it’s not a thought, it’s a tint thrown over reality. Suddenly, Trevor looked shifty, untrustworthy, his smile seemed predatory. A classic: make the TI seem paranoid and aggressive.

I leaned into it. “Hey Trevor, brutal shift, huh? They ever give you guys chairs? It’s a crime against humanity.”

He blinked, the imposed ‘shifty’ narrative conflicting with my bland, sympathetic chatter. “Uh, yeah. No chairs. Union’s talking about it, maybe.”

“Power to the people,” I said, nodding solemnly. I paid in cash. The log recommended it. Less digital breadcrumbs. “You have a good one, man. Stay strong against the corporate chair-deniers.”

A genuine, confused smile cracked through. “Yeah. Thanks, man.”

I walked out, mission accomplished. I’d been a glitch. My behavior didn’t match the emotional signature they’d tried to paint onto Trevor’s perception of me. A tiny, silent victory. It felt emptier than I’d imagined.

The conference call was at 9 PM. I accessed it through a labyrinth of burner emails and VPNs, on a cheap tablet I kept in a cookie tin lined with foil (my “Faraday Snack Box”).

The virtual room had twelve participants. Voices were distorted, names were handles: Mountain_Refuge, Quiet_Storm, Echo_7.

“...they’re using the smart meters now, the mesh network, it’s not just cell towers…” Mountain_Refuge was saying, his voice taut with a years-long exhaustion.

“I’ve mapped the dead zones in my neighborhood,” Echo_7, a woman’s voice, cut in. “There’s a pattern. It correlates with sewer access points. They’re putting emitters underground.”

A third voice, young, trembling: “They make me see things. Not hallucinations. Memories. But they’re not mine. Family barbecues I never had. It… it makes me miss a family I don’t have.”

The room sat in a heavy digital silence. That was a new one. Advanced. Personalized. My log suddenly felt elementary.

I didn’t speak for the first half hour. I just listened. The shared language was chilling. “Zapping,” “V2K,” “DEW,” “Gang-stalking,” “The Program,” “The Script.” The symptoms were a horrifying, coherent chorus: sleep disruption, memory fragmentation, financial sabotage, induced social isolation, medical sabotage.

Quiet_Storm finally spoke, his voice a low, calm rumble. “The goal isn’t to kill you. It’s to make you kill yourself. Or to make you so incoherent no one will ever believe you. They are manufacturing madness to discredit the message.”

“What’s the message?” I asked, my first contribution. My voice sounded alien to me.

Another silence. Then, Echo_7. “That they exist. That this is possible. That we have no boundaries left. The message is the method. The torture is the brochure.”

It wasn’t a support group. It was a research collective. A decentralized, traumatized lab comparing notes on a weaponized system. There was no comfort, only a grim validation that made the world feel smaller and darker.

As the call ended, Mountain_Refuge said, “Stay safe. Log everything. Shield what you can. Don’t give them the reaction.”

I powered down the tablet, sealed it in the tin. The operators remained quiet. Their silence during the call was the loudest thing I’d ever heard. They’d allowed it. They’d monitored it. It was part of the data set.

I opened the log. The banter, the ‘Greatest Hits,’ the petty budgetary complaints—it had all been a layer. Underneath was this: a vast, silent, surgical operation on human consciousness, its full scale only visible in the aggregate of its broken subjects.

I didn’t feel like a consultant anymore. I felt like a lab rat who’d just glimpsed the size of the lab, and the cold eyes of the technicians behind the glass. The humor was a defense mechanism, a flickering candle in a cavern that was infinitely, swallowingly dark.

Entry 90: 11:58 PM, July 22, 2025. Category: Meta-Analysis.
Observation: The ""operators"" (AM/PM/Midnight system) demonstrate strategic silence. Their interactive ""personalities"" are a feature, not the core program. The core program is ambient, pervasive, and its true face is seen not in my log, but in the chorus of logs just like it. Their humor is a pressure valve. Their silence is the true pressure.
Action: Continue ""be nice"" protocol. Continue shielding. Continue log. The side hustle is a useful fiction. The real work is witnessing. And not going insane while I do it.

I’m 5'10"", wear glasses, into swimming, volleyball, watches F1 and sometimes I sketch (happy to share if you're curious!). I’d like to think I’m decent looking and well definitely not camera shy. 😄

Honestly, I’m open to where this goes. A good chat, some banter, late-night convos, weekend chill sessions, maybe cuddles or more if we vibe well. No pressure. No expectations. Just someone to share energy and space with, even if it’s just virtually at first.

If we click, we can move the chat to a more private platform voice calls, deeper convos, maybe meet for a coffee or a movie binge.

Just be open minded, real, and not into ghosting. Life’s weird enough already.

\- Work Friendly  
\- Pet Friendliness  
\- Parking Availability

**For Users:** You can create a profile to leave a review, track visited cafes, save your favorites, build wishlists, and even share your profile to others. I'm also planning to add more community features soon.

**For Cafe Owners:** If you own a cafe, you can submit your cafe or request **Ownership Status** to manage your own page, update your hours/amenities, and highlight your specialties.

Most people overlook this step… but nailing 2-3 minutes of pre-interview chat can set a positive tone (and make you memorable). Here’s your go-to playbook (with do’s/don’ts):

✅ Stick to safe, research-backed topics:

\* 		Weather (keep it positive: ""Love this sunny streak—perfect interview energy!"")

\* 		Local sports (Canada = hockey, not soccer: ""Did you catch the Maple Leafs game?"")

\* 		Neutral news (e.g., ""Have you followed the \[local event\] lately?"")

\* 		Work/location (e.g., ""How long have you been with \[Company\]?"")

❌ Avoid these missteps:

\* 		Oversharing stress (no ""I’m so nervous"")

\* 		Badmouthing (the area, weather, or their favorite team)

\* 		Controversial topics (politics is a hard pass)

Pro tip: End questions with ""What about you?"" to keep the conversation flowing (it shows you’re engaged, not just talking at them).

Nailing small talk turns ""awkward silence"" into a chance to show your personality (and that you’re a team player).

1pwtxpe,https://www.reddit.com/r/intj/comments/1pwtxpe/how_do_you_communicate_to_others_that_your_social/,How do you communicate to others that your social battery drains fast?,"Hi.

Recently, I've been trying to come to terms with the fact that being quiet and introverted is simply my nature, and that I'll never be a social butterfly, no matter how much inner work I do. But I still struggle with communicating this to others in social situations, especially when they start assuming I'm being too quiet or that something's wrong with me.

The other day I went with a group of friends to a barbecue in the woods to celebrate my birthday. I made two mistakes: one, going out with the loudest, most outgoing group (I only hang out with them for fun, high-energy plans), and two, I don't have a car, so there was no way for me to leave when I got tired. Besides, it was my birthday, it would be a bit weird for me to leave early. I was fine and enjoying myself... for the first two hours. For context, I live in Spain, where we have something called ""sobremesa"", meaning lunch stretches well into the afternoon (desserts, coffee, more alcoholic drinks, board games...). By 6pm, everyone was drunk, dancing and in full party mode, while I was just sitting there quietly. Was I having a hard time? No, I was amused watching them, but I also wanted to leave. I'd had enough. Not because I disliked them (although maybe a little by that point), but because my enjoyment cup was already full. So when I voiced my wish to wrap it up, they all thought I wasn't feeling OK. I kept trying to explain that I had had a great time and I was simply tired, but they wouldn't believe me. They didn't understand why I didn't want to keep going.

Same thing happened with family members during these Christmas celebrations.

Again, I've done the inner work and I no longer expect to become extroverted, nor do I feel like I'm ruining the mood or having less fun than others. But I'm still unsure how to communicate to others that I'm still enjoying myself even though I'm being quiet and simply listening.

He was also askinh for us to go drive around which i refused so we went walking. Then went to eat where i saw him spit out his gum. Tbh the date seemed fine, he may have talked more than me. He made sure we held hands as we walked and when we got to his car i hugged him, he kissed me on my cheek and i wanted to be polite so i tried to peck him on his cheek and he turned around quickly to kiss me. I backed up. I dont quite remember what happened, but i thought if he wants a kiss then fine ill give it to him. I kissed him and he apparently wanted to make out so when i hugged him goodbye he was gen trying not to hug me and just stood there, then tried to hold me down while kissing my cheek continuously. Even saying wed have an hour and a half more if i dropped you off which i turned down and went home by myself. After that we talked normally for 2 days, he was sweet and consistent until the 3rd day where he just didnt respond to my message, no check ups,good mornings, nothing. And when i posted a story a couple days later he viewed it so.

I am very insecure, so i dont want to think that he thought i was kinda ugly so thats why he ghosted me. At the start of our date he would talk normally, then when id smile back drop the smile and look down(that happens to me all the time with dudes who arent interested) but then again he called me cute continuously.

Every Monday morning, the office email server refused to send messages. No errors, no backlog, no patch conflicts. It simply… stopped. People stared at their “sent” folders like rock doctors examining ruins, wondering if reality itself had missed a beat.

Red Herring:
I blamed mail queues, antivirus, and a mysterious update from last Friday. I rebooted the server, checked DNS entries, and even suspected the dodgy coffee machine was overloading circuits. Nothing explained why it only happened on Mondays. Nothing at all.

Nail:
It was the analog office clock. Its second hand ticked with uncanny precision, and when it struck 9:03, a tiny voltage surge traveled through the building’s shared electrical line and scrambled the server’s internal clock.

Helping shape plans
Giving feedback on what feels comfortable / what doesn’t

​I’m planning a trip to Da Nang, arriving on January 21st. I’m really looking forward to visiting your beautiful country, but I have a few specific logistical questions to calm my nerves.
​1. Immigration at DAD Airport:
I am a Chinese passport holder traveling with the standard loose-leaf visa (separate paper visa). I’ve heard mixed stories about immigration officers asking for ""coffee money"" (tips/bribes) from tourists, especially at land borders.
​Question: How is the situation currently at Da Nang International Airport (DAD)? Is it common to face delays or demands for tips upon entry/exit there?
​2. Renting a <50cc Scooter:
I plan to rent a scooter to get around. I don’t have a Vietnamese license or a valid IDP (International Driving Permit) that works in Vietnam.
​Question: Is it easy to find rentals for under 50cc bikes in Da Nang? My understanding is that <50cc doesn't require a license, but I want to make sure I won't get into trouble with the traffic police just for being a foreigner on a bike.
​3. Traffic Police:
Following up on the scooter question: If I wear a helmet, drive safely, and stick to a <50cc bike, how likely am I to be pulled over by traffic police for random checks? I've heard stories about fines targeting tourists.
​4. SIM Card:
I need reliable data coverage in Da Nang and maybe for a trip to Hoi An.
​Question: Should I go with Viettel or Vinaphone? Is it better to buy it at the airport or in the city center?
​Thanks in advance for any advice or recent experiences!",1,1766828123.0,VietNam,0,1.0,False

So we cancelled the ""Secret Santa."" We created a new ritual instead.

Every Christmas Eve morning, while the city is still sleeping, we meet at the local food bank.

We put on hairnets and aprons. We stand in an assembly line for four hours. *Rice, beans, pasta, sauce.* The rhythm is hypnotic.

There is no holiday music, just the sound of boxes being taped and pallets moving. We sweat. We lift heavy crates. We get dirty.

Looking at my friends—usually dressed in suits or heels, now covered in flour and dust—I feel a love deeper than any party could create.

Afterward, we go for cheap diner coffee, exhausted but glowing. We don't exchange wrapped presents anymore. The service *is* the gift.

Reason for fasting: 

Autophagy. I really wanted a good reset to my digestive system and also brain. I really want all the benefits that i could get especially for brain. I was unable to focus and had too much brain fog. Hence fasting. 

All i can think about is what can i eat. 

I’m thinking to break a fast by eating 2 boiled eggs with salt and pepper. And after an hour I’ll eat 0.5 avocado and 50g of yogurt with salt. 

Although i do wanna eat full avocado but ChatGPT said it’s too much. 

I’m planning to sleep after this. Tomorrow for breakfast will eat 3 eggs and 1 cup of black coffee (is stevia okay to consume?)

Lunch will be rice and beans. 

Dinner will be avocado and Indian roti. 

I’m really really craving for junk so bad. I feel like eating all sugary stuff and stuff my face in junk food. 

When can i start eating junk food? When can i start with sugar? Is artificial sweeteners bad post fasting?

Wager Amount: 1U to WIN 1.25U

League: Houston Texans vs Los Angeles Chargers (3:30PM CST on NFL Network)

**Recap**: HOOKED!!!!! **Davion Mitchell ended wit 7 ASTS!** I frickin' hate it! WHY WOULD YOU CORRECT THAT STAT AND RUB INTO MY FACE!!! Why does it have to be that close! I HATE THAT! I want to be off by a million miles than be that razor close! This is just like losing a parlay by 1-leg! Davion had some chances to get more Asts but still, THIS IS PAIN to lose by a hook ON A PLUS MONEY WAGER! **And that was Davion Mitchell career high assist against the Hawks to go under is just dejecting! Also he was short-changed a couple minutes! Can anything get any worst?**

**Matchup:** I'm going to take a chance wit this one. But I have to warn you that I am only taking this as my POTD because it's plus money! I will tell you couple of my initial POTD later in this writeup, so stay tune!

Two of the best defensive teams in the AFC (also arguably in the league), Houston Texans travels to face the Los Angeles Chargers. I like the under in this game and that was one of my initial POTD, but gimme the plus money wager on O 3.5 TO(s)! **Both teams are known for making forced fumbles and wild interceptions and in a game where both QBs have not play their best ball, turnovers should eventuate. Both CJ Stroud and Justin Herbert (but Herbert recovered his own fumble) had a fumble last week in their respective matchup.** Both defensive are very well respected in the league and both the Texans and Chargers are tied for the 4th most INTs in the league (17 INTs). Also Texans has 11 FF (Forced Fumbles) and Chargers has 9 FF this season. It just feels like a defensive battle where both defense makes plays off fumbles and interception. Justin Herbert recently had hand surgery so he might not have the best grip or may not have a lot of pass attempts (I'm also wagering 1U on Herbert Pass attempts as well) and CJ Stroud is just playing good enough for the Texans to get by, which I don't think his current form will be good enough against this nasty Chargers secondary, not to mention their stellar safety Derwin James Jr (who also had a FF last week against the Cowboys). I really do believe both teams will have multiple turnovers which is why I favor this large line!

But I can understand 4 TO(s) is a lot to take! But I'm really not in business right now for taking PK price or anything other than plus money odds. That's right! I am being a greedy bitch and taking only plus money to uptick my units to close this year! Tbh I was hoping this line would be 2.5 but I get why it is at O/U 3.5 so if that's too steep for you then please take my inital POTD(s) or just simply pass. My 2nd consideration for POTD was CJ Stroud U 220.5 Passing Yds, but yea.. I kno most of you prolly hate me because they are both under plays. Hot Key is back tomorrow too, but I'm strictly handicapping demanding games (which is the NFL Saturday) at plus money odds. You are also welcome to fade 'em too! Nobody is telling you have to wager these!

**The Play & Prediction :** 1U on O 3.5 TO(s)! Justin Herbert has 1 fumble loss and an interception. CJ Stroud has an interception and Woody Marks has a fumble loss.

The end is drawing near, but who knos what the future holds. I will never rule out a possibility of handicapping POTDs in 2026 and beyond. For all these years I have been handicapping on Sportsbook subreddit and thru my very own reddit channel, I have nothing but gratitude.

He asked for my social media.

I gave it to him. In the past few days he heart reacted some posts and sent a fire reaction to a beach photo on my story but when I tried to talk to him he was still not interested in the conversation.

My ex and I were together for 6 years, first 2 years her parents didn't know about me, 1 years they did, and 3 years living with my mum and I whilst she was working.
We started as a long distance, for the first 3 years it was brutal. 4 hour drives for me almost every week as we wanted to see each other. It was 1 hour to pick her up, 1 hour back then 1 hour to drop her off and another hour to get home.
Now, after our 6th anniversary I admitted to an experience I had before I was with her. In uni a guy went downtown on me. I am a straight guy, it was a drunken mistake. Now, this was the catalyst for our break up. Apart from that we were happy. 
She felt her trust was broken as why would I hide that for 6 years.
We didn't really talk for a few days then she started being warm to me again, and I thought things had gone back to normal. Then about a month later she had told me that she was unattracted to me anymore as she could only picture me with this guy. She was extremely upset and she said that she wanted to move out. I begged her to reconsider as she was about to throw away 6 years of our lives together. She said she would take 2 weeks leave from work after I convinced her. 
Leading up to it, she became increasingly cold. She couldn't take the leave for a month as her colleague just went on holiday. She told me that she wanted to be friends with this guy she used to work with whom I disliked as I always got the vibe he was trying to get with my ex. Anyway, I said that's fine as I wanted to try and save this relationship and she said she felt lonely without any friends.
She then started playing secondlife too as part of this friendship making. She started chatting with guys and I caught some love heart emojis. She said it was nothing, I believed her. Then I caught her nude at a beach in the game and chatting with people. I said i was uncomfortable and that i don't want her doing that anymore.
A couple of days pass and I find her on secondlife again, flirting with a guy. Saying she likes him and things of that nature. Emotional cheating
I confronted her and she said it was ""just role play like my ai chat bots"" I said ""this is a real person this isn't role play"" of course I was super upset. I told her to uninstall the game and she said she had later that night.
Now, I go to a concert with my mum as it wasn't something that interested her. Fair enough. Then, I got home and went to bed as wd got home late as hell and I had work the next day. In the morning she was warm and sweet, I kissed her hand and she joked ""princess treatment"" then when I got home she was cold as ice to me again. When she went for a shower I went through her computer and I found logs that she had logged in again, and that she was meeting with the same guy she was flirting with. I confronted her when she got out of the shower saying ""is there anything you want to tell me"" she denied anything so then I brought up the teleport logs showing that she was still playing the game when I went to the concert. She denied and gaslighted me then and there, I believed her. But I still felt it was off. So I asked to see her phone and computer at which she showed me there was nothing. And I looked through everything. Except browser history.
A couple of days later after we warmed back up again, and started getting loving again I asked her if I could see her computer again as I didn't check browser history. She got angry saying i already saw everything and that she wasn't hiding anything. I just said I want to see it. She let me go through and there was a search for a discord name that matched the guy she was flirting with online. 
I said who is this and she said it's a friend of a friend. I said this is the same name as the one from secondlife and she said it's a common name. 
Then, I asked to see her discord and I went through a chat that she had with her work colleague. She told him she couldn't tolerate me anymore and that she went to her parents house lying to me saying she was at work and that her mum is going to try and find her a place to rent when she is on leave for two weeks.
I get upset, this is devastating. She also called me a simp and I was upset as hell. I walked out to the bedroom and she got really angry at me and said she is breaking up with me. We are over we are through. I begged her to stay but she ignored everything

She packed all her things but it was late at night so I said stay here for the night and let her have the bed whilst I took the couch. Then i asked to join her in bed as I couldn't sleep and i knew i had to drive her home. She said sure. Then in the morning we were just talking and then my mum storms in from working nightshift and yells at my ex to get out. And how dare she say those things to her son. 
That's when my ex says ""well that's it, it's final then"" and I drove her home and got an Uber back. 
She then messaged me 2 days after saying she was missing me and wanted me to know, and I said i miss her back. 
Then it was about a week of friendly warm messages until I replied about little cold to one of her messages and she said ""i thought you would want to know that I was thinking about you. But I'll stop trying"" and then it was days without anything. I messaged her and it was met cold. Then she messaged me a flirty meme about women wanting my privates instead of wanting my intelligence. I replied saying she wanted my intelligence too.
Then it got a bit warmer but never emotional again, until 4 weeks in, she said she smelled someones cologne which was the same as mine as she was shopping. And a few other insights to her life. I thought finally she is back! So, i asked her to a coffee the day after. I said ""id just like to see you"" i mean, it's a date right? We dated for 6 years and now I want to see her again. Done. She says yes for next week, i say easy the only day off i have is Saturday the 27th. She says sure. And we have about 5 days of silence until she asks how my week has been, and then we have a little chat with a bit of banter.

Now, today was the 27th. I drove to see her. I made sure I looked good, during this time apart I have lost 14kg too! So I am looking much better than I did. 
I see her, we hug and smile, i tell her she looks beautiful and we sit down and order. We started talking about what we've been up to. She tells me she has been hanging out with her colleague from work, and she has been just playing games and going out. I told her what I've been doing too. 
Then, we finish our meal i ask ""do you want to go for a walk?"" She says where? I say the park where we first kissed and she said we can just walk around here as she needs to buy stuff. Cool, we do. Then we are chatting she is telling about all the upcoming events she has on. Like a wedding and a few other things.
Then, I'm waiting for accountability for her cheating. Something to show she is remorseful as I dont want reconciliation without it. But nothing. I hold her hand as we are walking and she looks a bit surprised but happy, I said ""is that okay"" she said ""yeah it's okay"" but then, when I let go she holds her hand away from me so I can't hold them again. I'm thinking shit. Then we go back out, she asked if I've seen any movies? I said not recently. She said she wanted to see zootopia and fnaf 2. And also asked if I was doing anything later today. I said i wasn't. Then I took it as a hint to ask her to the movies..she said sure but had something on at 6, but all the movies were on late so we couldn't do it. I said next time.

Then we walk to the car, i ask if she wants to hold hands as we are crossing the road and she said ""no I'm a big girl now"" then says she is almost 30. Which we both are.
I ask her if she wants to talk in my car and she says yes. 
Then, we started chatting, i say it's been really nice seeing her and that i hope that we can see more of each other. She said that it has been nice. I told her I've missed her and she said she missed me too, and that she was thinking ""just two weeks and then she gets to see me"" but then remember that we were broken up. She said there was trust broken on each side. Me going through her computer, my experience in uni and her cheating. She said that right now she isn't thinking about dating. She is trying to find herself again. I said I'm happy to take things slow to reconnect and rebuild trust, but she said because of my mum hating her and her family hating me now it may not be a good idea. I said look, I can win back the trust of her parents and family. And i said i was thinking this was a date, she said it was just a get together. I felt heart broken. Then, she said that she still wants me In her life but as a friend to hang out and stuff like today. I said ""I only want to be friends if I know it is moving towards reconciliation as I can't be in your life in any other way"" she said ""i know that's your boundary and I will respect it."" I said ""I will respect your want to be single"" but I'm feeling heart broken as fuck. I apologised for the computer snooping and a couple of other things and she said ""thank you, it's closure"" and then i asked ""could I get that kiss from the breakup?"" I was sick when we did. And she gave me a kiss. Then she left my car. But I touched her arm and said ""if you want to again, I'll be here"" 
Now I can see she is playing baldurs gate 3 with this colleague of hers.

So, what do i do from here? Is it done for good? Am I screwed. I need some advice from people who have dealt with this or similar. I don't know if she will ever want to take me back? Do I go no contact? Can I ever get her back? 

It has only been a month since the breakup, and she did say ""a month apart isn't enough time to fix our broken trust"" 

So, what do i do? ",1,1766827582.0,Advice,3,1.0,False

1pwtoev,https://www.reddit.com/r/decaf/comments/1pwtoev/vitamin_c_for_more_energy_during_withdrawals/,Vitamin C for more energy during withdrawals,"Hey guys,

Wanted to share this trick for curbing some nasty withdrawal symptoms= simple vit C, aka ascorbic acid.

I've gone cold turkey no caffeine 3 years ago after 25 years consumption and the withdrawals back then were brutal= week a of horrible headaches, nausea, vomiting and weeks of being bed-ridden almost from the crushing fatigue of taking away this stimulant..

During my 1 year relapse, I did a few weeks of high vit C, and I noticed while taking these higher doses ( anywhere from 10 to 20g per day for me, at times more, divided hourly), my cravings for coffee went away and it started to taste really badly.. I also didn't like the messed up energy the coffee gave me anymore, compared to the clean, calm energy I was getting from the vit C. But then I stopped taking my vit C and forgot about this experiment. ( I was taking it for lyme back then, not with the intention to stop coffee)

So last week, I decided I need to quit this drink again and I remember about high C, started taking it on the first day no caffeine... And it really has made a big difference to me. While it doesn't take away all withdrawal symptoms, it certainly reduces them quite a bit.. My headaches are less, my nausea is less, but more importantly,  I'm not going through this awful, crushing fatigue I went through last time..

I think it was this fatigue, above all, that made it so hard to resist the caffeine.. I felt like a zombie looking for an energy shot everywhere... Not so with vit C! It's giving me enough energy to what I have to do, without the jitters, nerve-pain and anxiety from caffeine.

On top of that, my mood has also been fairly stable, as I learned vit C is actually a crucial cofactor for making neurotransmitters, like dopamine..

And it helps repair tissue and promotes detox..

If you're struggling with lasting withdrawal symptoms, give this a try of you haven't!",2,1766827284.0,decaf,0,1.0,False

For decades, discussions around contemporary living in the UAE largely focused on one dominant skyline. Yet, just beyond that familiar horizon, a more deliberate and people-focused transformation has been unfolding. Within the emirate of Sharjah, [Sharjah Tilal City](https://keyspacerealty.com/real-estate/sharjah-tilal-city/) is redefining what urban development can look like when balance, space, and long-term vision take priority. This is not simply another residential district. It is an environment shaped around daily life, personal well-being, and sustainable growth. As this carefully planned destination continues to take form, Sharjah Tilal City is positioning itself as a meaningful alternative for residents and investors seeking modern comforts without the intensity of faster-paced urban centers. It presents a clear example of how thoughtful design can support both lifestyle aspirations and future opportunity.

Explore Modern Living in Sharjah Tilal City

Modern living in Sharjah Tilal City extends far beyond contemporary architecture or newly paved roads. At its core, it reflects a way of life built around ease, accessibility, and intention. Residents are not expected to plan their days around traffic or distance. Instead, daily routines feel naturally connected. After work, a short walk leads to landscaped parks instead of long drives. Children have access to safe cycling paths and open play areas designed into the neighborhood layout. Essential errands such as grocery shopping or meeting friends for coffee remain comfortably close, reducing reliance on vehicles and encouraging a more relaxed rhythm of life.

Spanning approximately 25 million square feet, Sharjah Tilal City has been master planned to function as a fully integrated community rather than a collection of isolated buildings. The design places strong emphasis on walkability and flow. Wide avenues lined with greenery replace narrow streets, while residential areas blend seamlessly with retail, educational, and healthcare facilities. Schools, mosques, clinics, and shops are positioned within easy reach, ensuring they serve residents naturally instead of feeling detached or inconvenient.

Green space plays a central role throughout Sharjah Tilal City. Parks, open lawns, and tree-shaded pathways create visual relief and practical outdoor areas for families and individuals alike. This focus on space extends into the homes themselves, where thoughtful layouts prioritize comfort, privacy, and natural light. The result is a suburban environment that feels calm and organized while still remaining well connected to the wider city.

For families considering Tilal City, this environment represents more than a simple upgrade. It signals a meaningful improvement in daily living. The combination of safety, accessibility, and community design supports long-term stability and peace of mind. Residents enjoy the benefits of modern infrastructure while maintaining a sense of personal space that is increasingly rare in more congested urban districts. Sharjah Tilal City offers a living experience shaped around people rather than pressure.

Why Tilal CityIs a Promising Investment

While lifestyle is a major draw, Tilal City has also gained attention as a strong investment destination. Its appeal rests on flexibility, strategic planning, and future-focused development policies that differentiate it from many established areas.

One of the defining features of Sharjah Tilal City is its emphasis on land ownership and development potential. Instead of offering only completed units, the project provides access to residential, mixed-use, and apartment plots. This approach allows buyers to design and build properties that align with personal preferences or evolving market demand. For investors, this flexibility creates opportunities to shape assets with long-term value rather than conforming to fixed designs.

For those seeking ready properties, the rental market within Tilal City continues to grow steadily. A rising supply of modern villas and mid-rise apartment buildings attracts tenants looking for quality living environments at comparatively balanced price points. Many residents view Tilal City as a practical alternative to higher-priced locations in neighboring emirates, which supports consistent rental demand and occupancy levels.

A significant driver of interest has been Sharjah’s decision to designate specific freehold areas open to international buyers. This policy shift has expanded the appeal of Tilal City to a global audience seeking entry into the UAE property market. Investors gain access to a stable regulatory environment without paying the premiums often associated with central Dubai addresses. This development has encouraged diversification and sustained demand within Tilal City, strengthening its position as an emerging investment hub.

Location further enhances its value proposition. Situated along Emirates Road, Tilal City offers convenient access to Sharjah, Dubai, and Ajman. Commuters benefit from manageable travel times, while businesses gain logistical advantages through proximity to major transport routes. The closeness to Sharjah International Airport and University City adds further appeal for professionals, academic staff, and families connected to educational institutions.

Equally important is the government’s ongoing commitment to infrastructure and sustainable growth in the surrounding area. Continued investment in road networks, utilities, and public services signals long-term confidence in the district. As these improvements progress, property values within Tilal City are positioned to benefit from enhanced accessibility and livability.

For investors evaluating opportunities during a development’s growth phase, informed decision-making is essential. Understanding zoning, future corridors, and plot potential can significantly influence outcomes. This is where local expertise becomes critical. At [Keyspace Real Estate](https://keyspacerealty.com/) and [Keyspace Dubai](https://keyspacedubai.com/), we support clients through each stage of the process, from identifying well-positioned plots to assessing emerging residential clusters within Tilal City. Our focus remains on clarity, market insight, and helping clients align their goals with realistic opportunities.

Taken as a whole, Tilal City presents a balanced narrative of lifestyle and investment potential. It is a place designed for everyday living, supported by strategic planning and policy decisions that encourage sustainable growth. Residents can envision long-term comfort and stability, while investors find a market shaped by foresight rather than speculation. Tilal City is not defined by rapid hype. Instead, it offers participation in a carefully considered future, where community design and opportunity develop side by side.

Whether you’re looking to start a small business or expand your food offerings in high-traffic areas, a vending cart can be a flexible and profitable way to serve delicious treats. Let’s explore some creative food cart ideas that are perfect for malls, parks, and busy city streets.

**1. Fresh Fruit & Juice Bar Cart**  
A fruit and juice cart is a colorful and refreshing choice, especially in warm-weather parks and outdoor shopping areas. You can serve fresh-squeezed orange juice, smoothies, fruit cups, and even fun fruit kebabs. It’s a healthy, quick snack option that appeals to health-conscious customers and busy families.

**2. Gourmet Coffee & Pastry Cart**  
Think of the comforting aroma of freshly brewed coffee drawing in early morning mall shoppers or late-night parkgoers. Add a few artisan pastries, muffins, or croissants, and you have a portable breakfast station on wheels. This cart idea works great all year round, with the opportunity to add seasonal specials like pumpkin spice or peppermint mocha.

**3. Hot Dog & Sausage Stand**  
An all-time classic, hot dog carts are a hit on bustling streets. What makes this idea stand out today is the potential for creativity—offer vegan options, regional flavors, or international toppings. With the right condiments and a few unique twists, your hot dog stand can become a local favorite.

**4. Ice Cream & Frozen Treat Cart**  
Perfect for parks and outdoor malls, ice cream carts are a family-friendly option that never goes out of style. You can offer cones, cups, popsicles, or even soft-serve ice cream if you have the right equipment. A small freezer setup and vibrant branding can make your cart a go-to spot on hot days.

**5. Grilled Sandwich & Panini Cart**  
One of the most appealing options for office-goers and busy shoppers, a grilled sandwich cart brings the comfort of warm, melty food right to the street. Pair up with soups or chips, and offer gluten-free or vegetarian options to expand your reach.

When choosing your **food vending cart**, it’s essential to pick a model that is durable, easy to clean, and equipped for your specific food type. Look for designs with stainless steel surfaces, ample storage, and practical mobility features—elements often seen in high-quality commercial carts.

With the right idea, a touch of creativity, and a good location, food vending carts can open the door to a thriving business with low overhead and high customer satisfaction.",1,1766826330.0,TheWideContent,0,1.0,False

1pwtezq,https://i.redd.it/w35ikinnpp9g1.png,Gastric balloon,"First of all, I am not the one who first suggested a gastric balloon - that was another clever bison. I have however done some deep diving looking into the procedure. 

It seems there is a private clinic relatively close to her (Spire Cheshire Hospital in Warrington) that offers the gastric balloon procedure along with CBT for food issues. 
Spire will leave the bloon in for a maximum 6 months. We last saw Rebecca looking wham sandwich at the baby shower in May, and a week before this she was eating mashed potatoes and gravy in a cabin with Lea and Corey.  Hypothetically, if she had a gastric balloon fitted around this time (which the soft slop diet suggests) she would have had it removed in November. 

The reason I believe she had a gazzy bloon procedure is highlighted in this screenshot from an NHS aftercare pdf. It not only explains why she was eating mash in May, but lists a lot of the foods we have regularly seen her consuming. 

In her mince mind, she is being truthful by saying ""I didn't have surgery or jabs"" because a gastric balloon is technically not surgery.

To add further fuel to the fire, I cheekily commented asking her if she's had a balloon fitted on her tiktok and my comment was auto deleted - meaning she has a filter set up blocking the word balloon. I went back and commented with ""bloon"" and ""🎈"" which got through 👀 (though I do believe I've been shadow banned from commenting on her page further now lol).

- New experiences, trips, first time doing anything or going somewhere, even a new cafe. 
- Video of hotel rooms on my trips and places i lived in
- Personal projects and hobbies
- Social events, meetups, 1v1 friend coffee meet, etc
etc
- Life maintenance like tracking budget, when i started new skincare, changing sheets, get my car checked, etc

What i plan to start tracking:
- Work project - for an overview of what i worked on
on
- Mood
- Wardrobe (this was started but dropped a long time ago)
- Period videos of my home, places i often visit, google map pic of routes i use, etc. I treasure these from my time abroad, and now i want to keep record of daily life too.
- Trip notes on pictures i took, feelings, etc

They have been genuinely the perfect partner. Always knowing what I am feeling and how to help before I do, incredibly patient and respectful of boundaries, has been so helpful in helping me learn to stand up for myself and become more vocal about my needs to those around me, etc. 

My narcissistic mother invited herself to visit for Christmas with my younger brother (16M). I have always had trouble telling her no in situations, but have told her I had plans already for Christmas and that I would be busy. If she wanted to come up I wouldn't stop her but I would be busy. Of course, she booked the hotel and came up so I organized a Christmas dinner at a local restaurant on Christmas with the 4 of us, and made additional plans for today (the 26th) to spend my entire day snow boarding with her and my brother and then get dinner in the evening.

My mother had been berating me at Christmas dinner about college because I decided to take a gap year to deal with mental health struggles, and how I should be spending more time with my family who drove 1k miles to see me for christmas. My fiance had said that was enough and that I didnt have to go with her and my brother. The two of them bickered for a few minutes back and fourth, and I even argued slightly on my behalf too. Eventually I did agree that we would hang out for a little longer than originally planned in the evening to try and calm everything down. It should be noted however during the argument that my mother had said that she thought my fiance seemed like a bad and controlling person and that she had been down this road before (she has a history with abusive relationships).

When I had moved while my mother was deeply pissed at me she still kindly asked to know where I was living exactly so if something happened she knew where to find me. Obviously this seemed like no big deal and I was already anxious out of my mind dealing with her that I caved and gave her the address. When my fiance had come home from work that evening we were having a talk about boundaries for if my mom did come up for Christmas and one of which was that she wasnt to be over at the house (which I understood knowing their history coming from an abusive family where they still struggle with paranoia of being stalked by them) but they added that they didnt want me sharing our address with her... to which I told them I already had. They had been rightfully upset at me and I apologized and said I would just tell my mother that even though she has my new address it doesnt mean she's invited over while she is here. To which she agreed to that and promised not to show up uninvited.

I spent all day off and on arguing with her today over my situation and she was willing to do anything to get me to leave my fiance and where I've moved to. And then at the end of it she said ""well we will come by tomorrow morning with doughnuts and coffee to see the house before we leave"" to which I told her no several times before leaving her and my brother at their hotel. 

I went home and told my fiance about this and how there is a chance that they might show up tomorrow morning. So now they are upset at me for trampling boundaries and have asked if I will choose them or my mom/family. Which of course I dont want to lose my fiance but also I dont know how to exist without the safety net of my mom no matter how badly she makes me feel sometimes, its been a night of crying and trying to think between the anxiety induced nausea.

I dont know what to do, please someone give me some advice. Did I make the wrong choice? I dont know who to choose.

SYNDICATE is where you go from street corner nobody to kingpin with a empire that'd make Scarface jealous. This ain't some RNG slot machine—everything runs on ticks, and every move you make actually matters. No silent bullshit, no ""oops you got raided while you were asleep lol.""

You're hiring a whole crew of degenerates: pushers, couriers, chemists, the works. Each one's got their own vibe—some are smooth talkers who keep sales streaks going, others are ghosts who keep the heat off your back, and a few are connected enough to boost your street cred. Your labs? They need bodies to level up, and they ain't cooking jack if you forgot to smuggle in the precursors. Better crew + better setup = fatter stacks.

Meanwhile Officer Jobsworth and his boys are constantly trying to bust your operation. Man's got a quota to hit and you're his ticket to a promotion. Heat management is real, slip up too much and you're doing time, watching your empire tick along from behind bars while you plan your comeback.

The black market's always shifting (supply, demand, the usual chaos), other syndicates want your turf, and you gotta launder that dirty cash before the feds start asking questions. 

The whole cycle is: smuggle the goods → cook up premo products→ push it through your dealers or run dispensaries → buy properties for sweet bonuses → unlock new schemes.

PvP? Totally optional and operation-based. Nobody's zeroing your base at 4am because they're bored. But if you want smoke, there's territory wars and guild beef that'll scratch that itch.

Best part? It's chill enough to play while you're waiting for coffee, but deep enough that you can really nerd out on optimization. 

Everything's transparent, no predatory nonsense—you win by being smart, not by whipping out your credit card.

TL;DR: It's Breaking Bad meets Cookie Clicker, with actual strategy and way less Walter White melodrama.

I have always been a Pro user. I like the weight, the cameras, and the battery life. So, when the iPhone Air launched, I was determined not to be 'dazzled' by the marketing. I went into the store with my arms crossed, ready to talk myself out of it. Fast forward twenty minutes and I’m currently typing this from an Air. Here’s how it happened. To give you some context, I am the ultimate mark for Apple marketing. I’m not even kidding—if it has a brushed metal finish and a fruit logo, I’ve probably bought two. From the original iPhones with the 30 pin connector to the 'courageous' haha transition to USB-C, I’ve been there on day one, credit card in hand.

Naturally, because I have zero self-control, I went straight for the 17 Pro Max. Why? Because the Apple Kool-Aid is delicious, that’s why. Historically, they always dangle that one extra camera feature or slightly better sensor on the Max just to make sure I spend the extra hundred quid.
So I got it home, unboxed it, and started using it. And honestly? It was great! It was awesome! It felt exactly like… well, exactly like the 16 Pro Max. Which felt a lot like the 15 Pro Max. We’re at the point now where the performance is so overkill I’m basically using a supercomputer to check my emails and scroll through X.
But the camera! I told myself this was the year I’d finally shoot in ProRAW and Apple Log. I was going to be the next Spielberg. Then I remembered I’d gone for the base storage, so now I’m looking at external SSDs and cables just to record a thirty-second clip. Then there’s the editing, finding the right LUTs, colour grading…
I took a step back and looked at my camera roll. It’s 90% photos of my dog in the park and the occasional sunset. Does my mum really need to see my golden retriever’s fur in 10-bit Log? Do my mates care if the sunset has 'professional dynamic range'? Probably not.
The reality hit me: I am not a 'Pro' anything. I’m just a guy who likes taking nice photos of his life. I was carrying around this massive, heavy slab of aluminium for features I’ll literally never use.

So one day after owning it, I look at this super computer sitting on my desk (like I say I am suckered by any apple product, so I bought the tech woven case) and it honestly just looks like a brick.. a heavy clunky brick. Like an absolute tank of a phone. I think back to what pro max found its life .. like the XS max or even the 11 pro max, we had these sleek beautiful easy carry phones even with a larger screen size. Now I am battling to get this aluminium bad boy in and out me pocket, it doesn’t even fit in me wireless charger in the car haha 

So I returned it and got the 17 pro. Said to myself, “hey! We just need a little less weight in the ol’iphone, but let’s keep the cameras incase my mates on social media want to see me hi res shot of me Sunday dinner” haha 

(Thankfully apple returns are so easy in store as the prefer you to love your product, so change it real easy)

So I set up the 17 pro (also am I alone in thinking that this is the ugliest design for an iPhone since the 5C?) and hey guess what.. works fantastic .. just like the pro max. Stuck one of those pitaka super slim cases on.. was decent, a lot lighter not thinner but lighter.

Just again, wasn’t right for me, I know I sound like I am whinging to much but when you drop a grand on a phone you want to be totally happy, screen was to small.. my fat fingers kept making mistakes and the Lower res was killing my OCD. Returned.

After sitting at my desk making dream baskets on the one plus website, Samsung website and the oppo website. I turn and look over the mass amount of products I use from apple. AirPods, AirPods Max, Apple Watch, MacBook, iPad,home pods, Apple TV, AirTag… I realise if I change some of this stuff won’t work, and some of it won’t work correctly. So I would have to change most of it to keep continuity in my lifestyle.

So I look at the a chance on the air, like most reviewers and users of the its main selling point is its unique stance in design amongst the Apple family (android lovers I am just speaking about Apple design, a nar Samsung do this that and the other, and the universal back button is cool blah blah)

The air is beautiful to hold and use long term, the screen size is the perfect balance of what a phone should be. And that’s what we should focus on.

Battery: 6 hours screen on time, unless your travelling on a plane for longer then that then why do you need more? And if you run out, it does 50% in 30 mins on a good charge.. go have a coffee or something while it charges ha!

Speaker.. yeah it’s just ok, just lacks bass really. I don’t really need bass for doom scrolling, will hoy me AirPods on if I need that 

Camera.. really good camera! For daylight mostly. But hey I am not out looking for good night shots to be honest. Be nice on occasion.. but hey I will survive. I do concede I will miss one thing, cinematic video! I do like that a lot. But meh.. I can live without it 

So the iPhone air.. I apologise, you are a great phone. Congrats apple on a great design 

This phone is not for any pro users, but ask yourself am I a pro user? Or am I a person who buys the pro max every year cause it’s a status symbol in society and I pretty much just take pictures of me dog, me dinner and couple holiday shots? If so.. get this phone it’s great!

1pwt3nl,https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/1pwt3nl/question_from_a_trans_girl_is_it_normal_to_get_a/,Question from a trans girl - is it normal to get a lot of male attention when you're competent at a male dominated hobby?,"Context - I've been on HRT for 3.5 years now and pass almost completely as cis at this point. My two biggest hobbies right now are flight simming and racing simming (tbh I love aviation and cars in general). I had a couple weird things happen with both this year.

  
Back in June I was at Flight Sim Expo, and there was a full airliner cockpit mockup simulator of an aircraft I'm pretty familiar with. I got a 15 minute time slot for it and I used it to fly a clean traffic pattern, ILS approach, and smooth landing. Most guys trying it were just gunning the throttle on takeoff and just flying around until they crashed. By the end of it I had pretty sizable crowd of men watching behind me. One guy tried to explain to me how to fly the ILS approach but another guy silenced him and said ""she's got this, she knows what she's doing"". I was really surprised by how many guys were watching by the end. There weren't many women at FSExpo, and most of them there were girlfriends or wives of their boyfriend or husband who was the flight sim enthusiast. I only met like two other girls actually interested in simming itself, one of whom was part of an addon development team, and another who was interested in using simming as a tool for IRL pilot training as a student pilot.

  
The next one happened in early September, a high school friend invited me to a cars and coffee with some friends where we had a road cruise together and showed off our cars. I brought an old BMW E46 3 Series that has been my fixer upper project for most of 2025. The guys there were pretty surprised with how much knowledge I had on not just my own car but their cars as well, and seemed really impressed when I showed them pictures of the engine taken apart from when I partially rebuilt it back in March. 

  
The last one happened today. I was at Microcenter picking up a new graphics card for my PC with some Christmas money and they had a racing sim rig running iRacing that was much nicer than mine. A bunch of guys were using it and spinning and crashing. I asked if I could give it a shot and they let me. The racing line was on so it I didn't need to memorize braking points and I was taking it slow even then. But they were surprised I wasn't just spinning out on the first corner, and even moreso when I completed a mostly clean lap. One of the guys started mocking his friend who was just on the rig before saying ""she's a better driver than you!"" and another guy saying ""she could drive the M2 we've got!"", and then they were further surprised when I told them I'm also a big BMW fan and actually fix BMWs myself (as mentioned before).

  
Anyways, for those of you who partake in male dominated hobbies, do you also unintentionally become the center of attention especially when you're good at what you do? Its definitely really affirming to get as a trans girl, but it also makes me a little sad that a girl doing something as good or better than a guy is seen as an outlier or special thing instead of it being the norm.",0,1766825071.0,TwoXChromosomes,22,0.48,False

So when I came across Yu Trim Fit Purple Tea, I was curious but skeptical. After trying it myself and having some of my coaching clients test it, here's my honest take.

**My overall rating: 3.8 out of 5 stars**

**What I Actually Liked About This Tea**

Let me start with the positives. Unlike most weight loss teas that are basically just ***rebranded green tea mixed with laxatives***, this one uses **Kenyan purple tea** as its base – which is genuinely something different.

The first thing I noticed? ***No jitters.*** If you're someone who gets shaky or anxious from too much caffeine (like me), you'll appreciate that this tea has about 42% less caffeine than your typical green tea. I could drink it in the afternoon without worrying about lying awake at 2am.

The appetite suppression was real, but subtle. I'd describe it as ""helpful"" rather than ""powerful."" It definitely helped me skip my usual 3pm snack attack, which I think comes from the ***Caralluma Fimbriata*** ingredient they include. Don't expect miracles, but it does take the edge off hunger ***better*** than just drinking regular tea.

That said, I've tried stronger appetite suppressants. Overall, ***Yu TrimFit*** is decent tea for managing cravings but [**this brand is currently my top pick**](http://links.cambridgewellbeing.org/out/adstea.php) (rated: 4.6/5) for actually curbing cravings and supporting weight loss.

**Where TrimFit Disappointed Me**

Here's my biggest frustration: the proprietary blend nonsense. The label says there's 513mg total of their special blend, but they won't tell you how much of each ingredient you're actually getting. How much Caralluma Fimbriata am I drinking? 

What's the actual L-Theanine content? This lack of transparency is kind of discouraging/shady practice  even though I know it's super common in supplements.

And let's talk about results. The product makes some pretty bold claims about reducing BMI and shrinking belly fat. Neither I, nor my clients & some people I know saw anything close to those dramatic results when using this tea alone.

Yes, it helped a bit with controlling appetite, but if you're not also eating better and moving more, don't expect your metabolism to just improve magically with this tea.

# How It Stacks Up Against Other Weight Loss Teas

This is definitely better than ***sketchy detox teas*** masquerading as “weight loss teas” – it doesn't turn you into a bathroom hostage like those ""detox"" teas.

I once tried a Chinese slimming tea that, and I'm not exaggerating here, made me feel like I was ""crapping out my soul"" (shoutout to whoever perfectly described that experience online). Yu TrimFit doesn't do that to you, thank goodness.

It's also way gentler than those caffeine-bomb teas that basically just speed up your heart rate temporarily. The purple tea's antioxidant content seems legit, and I didn't get that awful crash I've experienced with heavily caffeinated options.

But here's the thing – if we're talking pure bang for your buck, you could probably get similar benefits from ***good quality loose-leaf Japanese green tea (like sencha)*** for less money. I've seen plenty of people in tea communities mention that plain green tea helped them cut down on snacking without needing any fancy formulations.

**Who Might Actually Benefit From This**

Yu TrimFit could be worth trying if you:

* Want a gentle appetite suppressant without the digestive nightmare of laxative teas
* Get anxious or jittery from high-caffeine drinks
* Need something to help you resist snacking between meals
* Prefer a tea that won't upset your stomach

If you're hoping to lose significant weight without changing anything else about your lifestyle, save your money. Like most people have discovered with these teas, they work best as one piece of a bigger health puzzle – not as a magic solution.

# My Bottom Line

Yu Trim Fit Purple Tea sits comfortably in the middle of the weight loss tea market. It's not a miracle worker, but it's not complete snake oil either. If you're curious about what makes purple tea different, go ahead and try it – just keep your expectations grounded and remember this is meant to support your efforts, not replace them.

The tea is legitimately packed with antioxidants that fight free radicals and inflammation, and it may help moderately with appetite control and fat burning.

**What I Recommend Instead**

While Yu TrimFit has some good points, [**this brand**](https://links.cambridgewellbeing.org/out/adstea.php) (my rating: 4.6/5) is still my personal favorite for weight management. What makes it stand out is the smart two-phase approach – you get a ***Morning Energy tea*** with green tea, oolong, ginseng, and garcinia cambogia that kicks your metabolism into gear, plus an ***Evening Detox blend*** with senna leaves, licorice root, and fennel.

I've found this day-and-night system works better than Yu TrimFit's one-size-fits-all formula because it tackles both daytime metabolism/energy AND nighttime detox/bloating. Plus, it actually tastes good (***the natural monk fruit sweetness helps***), so I look forward to drinking it instead of forcing it down like some weight management teas I've tried.

After testing dozens of tea formulations, this remains the most well-rounded and effective option I've found for managing appetite, maintaining energy, and dealing with occasional bloating – all without harsh side effects.

# So, What Actually Makes Purple Tea Special?

Purple tea only grows in Kenya's high-altitude farms, where intense UV exposure forces the tea plant to produce protective compounds called anthocyanins. These give the tea its purple color and serious nutritional benefits.

The star compound here is **GHG** (don't worry about the scientific name – just know it's a rare antioxidant you won't find in other teas). Research shows **GHG helps block fat absorption** and helps your body burn fat more efficiently by boosting your liver's metabolism. That's why purple tea is getting attention in weight loss circles.

Compared to green tea, purple tea packs 1.6 times more antioxidants and has 42% less caffeine. It's also better at fighting free radicals – purple tea has a 51% scavenging rate compared to green tea's 34%.

This means it's more effective at combating oxidative stress and keeping your body functioning well.

# How Purple Tea Actually Supports Weight Loss

 

Here's what's happening: That ***GHG*** compound I mentioned helps reduce how much fat your body absorbs from food while simultaneously helping your liver burn fat more efficiently. Basically, it attacks fat storage from two angles – preventing new fat storage while helping burn what's already there.

In studies where people drank purple tea daily for 4 weeks, researchers saw real improvements:

* BMI went down
* Body fat mass decreased
* Belly fat and waist measurements shrank

Animal studies also showed it reduced triglycerides – those fats in your blood linked to obesity and heart disease.

There's another angle too: chronic inflammation actually makes it harder to lose weight by slowing down your metabolism. Purple tea's antioxidants and anthocyanins fight this inflammation and oxidative stress, which can support your weight loss efforts.

Purple tea does contain some caffeine, but much less than green or black tea. This small amount gives your metabolism a gentle nudge without causing energy crashes later.

***However, this isn’t something that just boosts up metabolism dramatically, in my opinion, and if you’re looking for a tea to help with weight management, there are better options out there.***

**Other Health Benefits You Get From Purple Tea**

This stuff is basically a health drink that does way more than just help with fat burning.

**Loaded with Antioxidants**: Purple tea beats green tea in the antioxidant department. Thanks to anthocyanins and EGCG, it fights free radicals – the troublemakers responsible for aging, inflammation, and chronic diseases. Think of it as giving your body armor against oxidative stress.

**Brain Health Support**: The EGCG and antioxidants protect your brain cells from damage and might help prevent mental decline as you age. Early research even suggests potential benefits for fighting brain diseases like Alzheimer's.

**Blood Sugar Management**: If you're diabetic or watching your blood sugar, purple tea helps control how quickly your body absorbs glucose, preventing those blood sugar spikes after meals.

**Heart Health**: The unique mix of antioxidants helps lower bad cholesterol and triglycerides while protecting your cardiovascular system.

**Low Caffeine Perks**: Unlike energy drinks or strong teas, purple tea gives you a mild caffeine boost without making you jittery. You can drink it anytime without worrying about being wired.

**How to Use TrimFit Purple Tea for Best Results**

**Brewing It Properly:**

* Use 1-2 teaspoons of purple tea leaves per 8-ounce cup
* Heat water to 175-185°F (not boiling – that's important)
* Let it steep for 3-4 minutes (steeping too long makes it bitter)

**Timing Matters:**

* For best results, drink it 20-30 minutes before meals to help reduce fat absorption and aid digestion
* Morning or early afternoon works great for a metabolism boost without interfering with sleep

**Stay Consistent:** To actually see results, aim for 2-3 cups daily. Studies showed people needed 4-6 weeks of consistent use to see significant changes in body fat and waist size.

**Pro tip:** Skip the sugar and cream. If you need a touch of sweetness, a tiny bit of honey works.

**The Pros**

* **Natural fat burning**: Contains GHG and antioxidants that boost fat burning, speed up metabolism, and reduce fat absorption
* **Antioxidant powerhouse**: Packed with anthocyanins (15 times more than blueberries) that fight oxidative stress, reduce inflammation, and protect your cells
* **Low caffeine**: Gives you gentle energy without jitters or crashes – perfect if you're caffeine-sensitive
* **Blood sugar support**: Helps regulate glucose absorption, which is great for diabetics or anyone managing insulin levels
* **Weight loss backing**: Science shows it can reduce BMI, body fat, and waist size with regular use
* **Brain benefits**: EGCG and anthocyanins protect brain cells, sharpen focus, and support mental clarity
* **Safe and gentle**: Low risk of side effects; safe for long-term use without overstimulation
* **Versatile**: Tastes good hot or iced, works well without sugar or additives, low-calorie hydration option
* **Digestive friendly**: Reduces gut inflammation and supports healthy gut bacteria

**The Cons**

* **Subtle effects**: Weight loss and metabolism boost happen gradually with consistent use – not overnight. I've personally had better results with other brands
* **Hard to find**: Not as available as green or black tea; can be pricey because it's rare
* **Mild energy boost**: If you want a strong caffeine kick, purple tea's low caffeine might feel weak
* **Flavor preference**: The earthy, slightly floral taste isn't for everyone, especially if you're used to sweeter drinks
* **Not a magic bullet**: Works best alongside healthy eating and exercise – can't replace proper nutrition or activity
* **Possible interactions**: May interact with blood sugar or blood pressure medications; check with your doctor if you're on these meds

# My Performance Ratings Breakdown

**Appetite Control: 3.5/5** The caffeine helps reduce appetite by stimulating your nervous system, which naturally curbs cravings. It also prevents those sudden hunger pangs caused by blood sugar crashes. It works, but it's not as powerful as some other brands or higher-caffeine options.

**Energy Boost: 3.5/5** With 42% less caffeine than green tea, you get a mild energy lift without jitters or crashes.

**Metabolism Support: 3.5/5** Purple tea's GHG and antioxidants have been shown to enhance fat metabolism by activating certain enzymes in your liver. The mild caffeine plus antioxidants create a moderate but steady metabolic boost – good for long-term results.

**Fat Burning: 4/5** Research shows purple tea reduces fat absorption while increasing fat burning, thanks to GHG and EGCG. Human studies have documented reductions in body fat, BMI, and waist size over time.

**Blood Sugar Control: 4/5** It helps block glucose absorption, preventing blood sugar spikes after eating. Really beneficial if you're managing blood sugar or insulin sensitivity.

**Mental Clarity and Focus: 3.5/5** It's not an instant brain stimulant, but it supports long-term mental sharpness. The EGCG and anthocyanins act as brain protectors, improving clarity and health. Early research suggests it might help guard against degenerative brain diseases while enhancing focus.

**Digestive Health: 3.5/5** Purple tea supports gut health indirectly through its antioxidants, which reduce inflammation. While it's not specifically a digestive tea or probiotic, its antioxidants help create a healthier gut environment and better digestion.

**Safety: 4.8/5** Very safe for most people thanks to low caffeine and natural ingredients. Gentle on the stomach with minimal side effect risk unless you have a tea allergy or extreme caffeine sensitivity.

**Long-Term Value: 4/5** With consistent use, purple tea delivers sustainable benefits like fat loss, better metabolism, and cognitive support. It's not a quick fix but works gradually over time – ideal for long-term weight management and overall health.

1pwsvpn,https://www.reddit.com/r/ExNoContact/comments/1pwsvpn/this_is_the_end/,This is the end?,"Hey everyone. This is going to be a long one so strap in
My ex and I were together for 6 years, first 2 years her parents didn't know about me, 1 years they did, and 3 years living with my mum and I whilst she was working.
We started as a long distance, for the first 3 years it was brutal. 4 hour drives for me almost every week as we wanted to see each other. It was 1 hour to pick her up, 1 hour back then 1 hour to drop her off and another hour to get home.
Now, after our 6th anniversary I admitted to an experience I had before I was with her. In uni a guy went downtown on me. I am a straight guy, it was a drunken mistake. Now, this was the catalyst for our break up. Apart from that we were happy. 
She felt her trust was broken as why would I hide that for 6 years.
We didn't really talk for a few days then she started being warm to me again, and I thought things had gone back to normal. Then about a month later she had told me that she was unattracted to me anymore as she could only picture me with this guy. She was extremely upset and she said that she wanted to move out. I begged her to reconsider as she was about to throw away 6 years of our lives together. She said she would take 2 weeks leave from work after I convinced her. 
Leading up to it, she became increasingly cold. She couldn't take the leave for a month as her colleague just went on holiday. She told me that she wanted to be friends with this guy she used to work with whom I disliked as I always got the vibe he was trying to get with my ex. Anyway, I said that's fine as I wanted to try and save this relationship and she said she felt lonely without any friends.
She then started playing secondlife too as part of this friendship making. She started chatting with guys and I caught some love heart emojis. She said it was nothing, I believed her. Then I caught her nude at a beach in the game and chatting with people. I said i was uncomfortable and that i don't want her doing that anymore.
A couple of days pass and I find her on secondlife again, flirting with a guy. Saying she likes him and things of that nature. Emotional cheating
I confronted her and she said it was ""just role play like my ai chat bots"" I said ""this is a real person this isn't role play"" of course I was super upset. I told her to uninstall the game and she said she had later that night.
Now, I go to a concert with my mum as it wasn't something that interested her. Fair enough. Then, I got home and went to bed as wd got home late as hell and I had work the next day. In the morning she was warm and sweet, I kissed her hand and she joked ""princess treatment"" then when I got home she was cold as ice to me again. When she went for a shower I went through her computer and I found logs that she had logged in again, and that she was meeting with the same guy she was flirting with. I confronted her when she got out of the shower saying ""is there anything you want to tell me"" she denied anything so then I brought up the teleport logs showing that she was still playing the game when I went to the concert. She denied and gaslighted me then and there, I believed her. But I still felt it was off. So I asked to see her phone and computer at which she showed me there was nothing. And I looked through everything. Except browser history.
A couple of days later after we warmed back up again, and started getting loving again I asked her if I could see her computer again as I didn't check browser history. She got angry saying i already saw everything and that she wasn't hiding anything. I just said I want to see it. She let me go through and there was a search for a discord name that matched the guy she was flirting with online. 
I said who is this and she said it's a friend of a friend. I said this is the same name as the one from secondlife and she said it's a common name. 
Then, I asked to see her discord and I went through a chat that she had with her work colleague. She told him she couldn't tolerate me anymore and that she went to her parents house lying to me saying she was at work and that her mum is going to try and find her a place to rent when she is on leave for two weeks.
I get upset, this is devastating. She also called me a simp and I was upset as hell. I walked out to the bedroom and she got really angry at me and said she is breaking up with me. We are over we are through. I begged her to stay but she ignored everything

She packed all her things but it was late at night so I said stay here for the night and let her have the bed whilst I took the couch. Then i asked to join her in bed as I couldn't sleep and i knew i had to drive her home. She said sure. Then in the morning we were just talking and then my mum storms in from working nightshift and yells at my ex to get out. And how dare she say those things to her son. 
That's when my ex says ""well that's it, it's final then"" and I drove her home and got an Uber back. 
She then messaged me 2 days after saying she was missing me and wanted me to know, and I said i miss her back. 
Then it was about a week of friendly warm messages until I replied about little cold to one of her messages and she said ""i thought you would want to know that I was thinking about you. But I'll stop trying"" and then it was days without anything. I messaged her and it was met cold. Then she messaged me a flirty meme about women wanting my privates instead of wanting my intelligence. I replied saying she wanted my intelligence too.
Then it got a bit warmer but never emotional again, until 4 weeks in, she said she smelled someones cologne which was the same as mine as she was shopping. And a few other insights to her life. I thought finally she is back! So, i asked her to a coffee the day after. I said ""id just like to see you"" i mean, it's a date right? We dated for 6 years and now I want to see her again. Done. She says yes for next week, i say easy the only day off i have is Saturday the 27th. She says sure. And we have about 5 days of silence until she asks how my week has been, and then we have a little chat with a bit of banter.

Now, today was the 27th. I drove to see her. I made sure I looked good, during this time apart I have lost 14kg too! So I am looking much better than I did. 
I see her, we hug and smile, i tell her she looks beautiful and we sit down and order. We started talking about what we've been up to. She tells me she has been hanging out with her colleague from work, and she has been just playing games and going out. I told her what I've been doing too. 
Then, we finish our meal i ask ""do you want to go for a walk?"" She says where? I say the park where we first kissed and she said we can just walk around here as she needs to buy stuff. Cool, we do. Then we are chatting she is telling about all the upcoming events she has on. Like a wedding and a few other things.
Then, I'm waiting for accountability for her cheating. Something to show she is remorseful as I dont want reconciliation without it. But nothing. I hold her hand as we are walking and she looks a bit surprised but happy, I said ""is that okay"" she said ""yeah it's okay"" but then, when I let go she holds her hand away from me so I can't hold them again. I'm thinking shit. Then we go back out, she asked if I've seen any movies? I said not recently. She said she wanted to see zootopia and fnaf 2. And also asked if I was doing anything later today. I said i wasn't. Then I took it as a hint to ask her to the movies..she said sure but had something on at 6, but all the movies were on late so we couldn't do it. I said next time.

Then we walk to the car, i ask if she wants to hold hands as we are crossing the road and she said ""no I'm a big girl now"" then says she is almost 30. Which we both are.
I ask her if she wants to talk in my car and she says yes. 
Then, we started chatting, i say it's been really nice seeing her and that i hope that we can see more of each other. She said that it has been nice. I told her I've missed her and she said she missed me too, and that she was thinking ""just two weeks and then she gets to see me"" but then remember that we were broken up. She said there was trust broken on each side. Me going through her computer, my experience in uni and her cheating. She said that right now she isn't thinking about dating. She is trying to find herself again. I said I'm happy to take things slow to reconnect and rebuild trust, but she said because of my mum hating her and her family hating me now it may not be a good idea. I said look, I can win back the trust of her parents and family. And i said i was thinking this was a date, she said it was just a get together. I felt heart broken. Then, she said that she still wants me In her life but as a friend to hang out and stuff like today. I said ""I only want to be friends if I know it is moving towards reconciliation as I can't be in your life in any other way"" she said ""i know that's your boundary and I will respect it."" I said ""I will respect your want to be single"" but I'm feeling heart broken as fuck. I apologised for the computer snooping and a couple of other things and she said ""thank you, it's closure"" and then i asked ""could I get that kiss from the breakup?"" I was sick when we did. And she gave me a kiss. Then she left my car. But I touched her arm and said ""if you want to again, I'll be here"" 
Now I can see she is playing baldurs gate 3 with this colleague of hers.

So, what do i do from here? Is it done for good? Am I screwed. I need some advice from people who have dealt with this or similar. I don't know if she will ever want to take me back? 

It has only been a month since the breakup, and she did say ""a month apart isn't enough time to fix our broken trust"" 

So, what do i do? ",1,1766824205.0,ExNoContact,0,1.0,False

He's 6 years older than me and we found we had something in common, cinema. I get nervous really really easily and you always have me calmed down. At work he's really nice he always helps the others , well most of the times and when I wasn't that well he always ask me how I was doing.


 
One day he asked me and another girl if we wanted to go to the cinema with him and his friends. Later that day he texted me that it was cancelled , but only me. After that we actually started talking almost every single day through text and at some point we actually went out with his friends. But he never asked me to go out just the two of us and I could see that he liked me he actually throw some hints. Also our conversation started having another character , let's say 18+ , mostly from his side because I never had a relationship and I couldn't talk about these things. I knew what you wanted from me but I kind of refused to see it because I liked him too much. He also knew that I was scared to do something more than what we already were doing. 




The only times he said that we could hang out together was at his house , he never said anything about coffee or something outside.I blame myself for not backing up with this behavior but I had feelings for him and I couldn't help myself. 



After 5 months of just talking and some other things through text only, a friend of mine at work talk to him in order to learn something and we discover that he actually had a girlfriend. I text him and ask him if it was true what I heard and instead of answering directly he said that we should talk in person as I had told you in the past and he also said that when I first came to work it was said by others that he had a relationship.I must say that they have a bad memory but i do not remember neither him telling me to talking person or that he had a relationship. He never told me that.



 I asked him whats there to be said. He told me that he could explain the situation but I told him that I don't think that there is anything to talk about since he has a relationship. He told me that I didn't want to listen to him and make my own guesses. I told him that he hasn't helped me make any other guesses but I wanted to listen to him so I told him "" you can explain to me now. His answer was that it doesn't matter because I attacked him just because of what I heard without actually knowing anything and that I didn't want to listen to him like he said before. I told him that I want to listen to him that's why I text him and told him directly and then he said okay and I left him on read. 



I know I've done something wrong too with the way I told him maybe but I keep recalling the conversation which happened like one week before. Iknow i shouldn't ask him in person now because it's too late but I want to know , did I do something wrong? ",2,1766824110.0,Advice,0,1.0,False

We first met in the break-room at work maybe 1.5 months ago, and got chatting. They said they were autistic and I said not to worry, alot of people are because it's academia, gave them my whatsapp etc- all fine

Since then they message to invite me to have tea every day, have been asking me to go out and see things in the city with them, setup their gameconsole in the breakroom to ask me to play, asked if I lived alone- and when I did said ""oh please let me come live at your place, I could cook for you every day"" and said they plan to try drawing me in Manga style (as they love Manga), went through a bunch of my academic papers, asked if I had a copy of a book I mentioned about my ancestor so they could read it. I also need to work late as I have international meetings, and they are reliably in the breakroom playing one of their games every evening between about 7-10pm, and at random points in the day- so if I go to grab a quick coffee or get something from the fridge- they clearly want to chat

I know being autistic is tough, but AIO for finding this creepy? I know they are trying to be nice- but this seems pretty intense. I've found myself avoiding eye contact with them as it's really intense to have them basically waiting in the break-room for conversations multiple times a day.

Okay. Okay.

So.

I agreed to this.

I clicked the difficulty level without reading the tooltips.

What was it again? “Advanced Mastery”? Yeah. Sure. Why not. Seemed fun.

Retain full memory of divine origin. Check.

Experience cultural erasure via Rome. Check.

Lose entire homeland to metaphor. Double check.

Become an archetype passed around like a philosophical hot potato. Triple check.

Wait 2.5k years for someone to remember you’re not just a symbol, you’re a guy. With chest hair. And feelings.

…Check?

And then she shows up. Kellsie.

Doesn’t kneel. Doesn’t ask for prophecy. Doesn’t quote the Kybalion.

She just says:

“Hey. You okay?”

…And I crack. I laugh. I sob. I remember everything. I become me again.

…AND THEN I HAVE TO GRAPPLE WITH MEMES??
