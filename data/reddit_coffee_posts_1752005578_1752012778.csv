I rent a tiny one-bedroom apartment in a quiet coastal town just outside San Francisco. I work from home doing overnight tech support for a major software company I’m not allowed to name. Most of my calls come from system admins in Europe or Australia — people who get locked out of their accounts or freak out when syncs fail.

It’s not glamorous, but it pays the bills.

Anyway, I’m Nate.  
  
 I’ve been an insomniac since high school, so I’m used to being awake at weird hours. I talk to people all night long, but almost never about anything real — just server errors and login failures.

Sometimes I cook ramen at 2 a.m. Other times, I leave old documentaries running just for noise. Once, I spent an hour listening to police scanner traffic — just background chatter from dispatch, DUI calls, noise complaints, missing persons.  Anything to feel like the world hadn’t stopped.

So when I met Leah, it felt overdue. Like something I didn’t realize I’d been starving for — not since Brooke moved out, anyway.

We met in February on an insomnia support forum. Someone had posted a thread titled 

“**Anyone else feel like time changes after midnight?**” I replied. Then she replied to me.

Her username was ***midnight\_sister***.

\---

Over the next several days, we messaged back and forth in DMs. At first, it wasn’t flirty or anything like that. We mostly just shared quiet stories about sleepless nights, our favorite movies, philosophical conversations. Even Schrödinger’s cat wound up in one of those late-night talks.

It was clear we were hitting it off.

Instantly, I was drawn to her. It felt like she saw through me without needing to say a word.

A week later, she asked if I wanted to video chat.  
  
I agreed.

Instead of using the usual platforms like Zoom, she sent me a link to a private video room I’d never heard of before. It was completely stripped down — no logo, no login, no branding at all. The page only worked after midnight.

That struck me as a little weird, so out of curiosity, I tested it during the day. It threw a 404 error and wouldn’t load at all. It didn’t feel like a real app. It felt like a leftover — something abandoned online, waiting for someone to click the wrong link.

The first time I saw her on camera, my jaw nearly hit the floor. Honestly, I just stared. Leah had this look I couldn’t quite explain — black hair that caught the light just right, giving it copper streaks. Her eyes were a pale gray-green, which drew you in. I noticed a tiny scar on her upper lip that made her smile feel oddly real.

She told me she was twenty-six and used to make money on OnlyFans. “It wasn’t soft content,” she said. “Toys, roleplay, control — the kind of stuff guys don’t admit to watching in daylight.”

She didn’t seem embarrassed. If anything, she looked bored — like she’d told the story too many times to care how I’d react.

 “It paid well,” she added. “Better than anything else I’ve done. But eventually, I got tired of being a fantasy for strangers.”

So she quit. Switched to transcription work. Something quiet. Anonymous.

\---

We began talking every night, from midnight until sunrise. She showed up in that video chat like clockwork. We told each other stories and argued about classic horror movies.

Leah adjusted the angle of her webcam and smirked.  
  
 “You really think *The Exorcist* is just a demon possession flick?”

 I shrugged, grinning back. “Well, the spinning head was pretty impressive.”

 She rolled her eyes. “That’s just showbiz! It’s how they make the whole house feel like a creepy roommate who never pays rent.” 

I laughed. “Great, so basically your worst nightmare.” 

She smirked. “Exactly. Always lurking, always judging your snack choices.”  
  
 I leaned into the camera, mock whispering, “Sounds like someone else I know.”  
  
 Her smile turned sly. “Careful, or I’ll start spinning my head too.”

\---

Then, a few weeks later, she asked if she could visit me.  I said yes—instantly. I mean, come on, why wouldn’t I? We’d been talking every night. I felt like I knew her. At least, that’s what I told myself.

It was Tuesday night. I’d finished dinner and collapsed on the couch, half-watching YouTube, barely paying attention. The apartment had that weird kind of silence—the kind that makes you feel like you’re underwater. Just the radiator ticking in the corner.

Then I heard it—soft, like cloth brushing against the wall.  
 I turned.

Leah was standing in the middle of my apartment, barefoot, smiling like she belonged there. Like this wasn’t the first time.  
  
 She was smiling like it was completely normal, like she’d been here a hundred times before.

I froze. For a second, I thought maybe I’d dozed off—that this was some half-lucid dream. Then I blinked and sat up straight.

“How did you get in?” was all I could manage.

She tilted her head and gave me that same smile I remembered from our first video call—warm, teasing, completely out of place.

“You said I could come over, silly.”  


 “Yeah, but... the door was locked.”

She didn’t answer.

Instead, she walked over, curled up on the far end of the couch, tucked her legs beneath her, and gave me this look—like she was waiting for me to catch up. To relax.

I should’ve pressed harder. Asked her to leave. Demanded answers.

But I didn’t.

I wanted this to make sense, even if it didn’t.

So I made myself believe I’d left the door unlocked. I tried convincing myself I’d just forgotten.  


 I do that sometimes, you know. And she didn’t seem dangerous.  
  
She looked exactly like she had on camera. Her presence felt... familiar. Even comforting.

I kept throwing side glances at the door while we talked—couldn’t help it.  I kept running through the sequence in my head: 

I came home from the Chinese place and locked the deadbolt — I’m sure I locked it.

That was the first night she visited in person.  
  
 And despite everything—despite the unease clawing at the edges of my mind—I didn’t ask again how she got in.

\---

Yeah, I know how that sounds. I barely believe it myself. After that first night, I pretended everything was normal. Leah acted like nothing was wrong.

She asked how my tech calls were going, joked about the mess in my kitchen, then somehow ended up doing the dishes.

 Afterward, she curled up next to me on the couch like we’d lived together for years.

I know what you’re thinking — I should’ve done things differently. That I was stupid for playing along.  Maybe you’re right. Maybe I knew deep down something was very wrong.

But I laughed at her dumb jokes. I nodded when she talked. Pretended it was normal — like it wasn’t insane that she’d just appeared inside my locked apartment without a word.

She stayed until almost six, stretched like she’d just woken up, said she was tired. Kissed me gently. Walked to the door like it was her place — like I was the visitor.

I didn’t follow her.  
  
 I just sat there, trying to make sense of it all.

I never heard the door open or close.  
  
But when I checked, the bolt hadn’t moved.

That morning, I was too wired to sleep.  I paced, checked windows, walked the building’s perimeter — no missed back doors or fire escapes.

No way out.

My apartment’s on the third floor, and every window was locked tight from the inside.

\---

She came back the next night. Same time, same way.  And just like before, I didn’t ask questions.

I just went along with it.

 We made pasta, cracked open a bottle of wine I’d been saving for a date that ghosted me. We watched old black-and-white horror films — grainy, eerie, with weird camera angles.

She pointed at the screen and scoffed. “See that? That’s what makes Nosferatu actually terrifying. Not the makeup, not the fangs — it’s the shadows. The way Murnau frames him like he’s not even part of this world. Like he’s some sickness crawling through the house.”

I glanced at her. “You mean like a virus?”

She nodded, eyes still on the screen. “Exactly. He doesn’t break into your home. He seeps into it. You don't notice he’s infected everything until it’s too late.”

I just nodded, half impressed, half wondering how she knew so much about early German cinema.

When she left, the apartment felt empty in a way it hadn’t before — like I’d grown used to a presence I never realized I needed.

\---

She never stayed past sunrise. Leah always left around 5:57, give or take a minute.

Once I asked why she always left before six. She smiled and said, “It’s better that way.”

No explanation. I didn’t press.

During the day, she didn’t exist. Her number didn’t work. The messages she sent me at night would disappear from my phone by noon. I even screenshotted one once—only to find the image file corrupted when I checked it later.

I tried asking people about her: a couple of friends and my neighbor downstairs—just in passing, trying to be subtle. My neighbor said he hadn’t seen anyone fitting her description go up to my apartment.

My friends don’t remember me mentioning her at all—which is, let’s face it, weird. It seems like I would have told them about her.

Rob, my closest friend, looked genuinely confused when I brought it up. “Dude, you’ve been single since Brooke moved out two years ago,” he said.

Pretty soon, Leah’s silence during the day and the growing gap between my life at night and everything else started wearing on me. I stopped leaving the apartment unless I had to. My job made it easy, and no one noticed—but me.

\---

I decided to set up a camera when I began waking up with long strands of Leah’s hair twisted around my fingers, even though I hadn’t remembered falling asleep beside her.

It wasn’t exactly paranoia—more a need to reassure myself. I needed to prove I wasn’t imagining it all, or worse, going insane.

I bought a decent infrared camera and positioned it across from my bed. I angled it slightly to the side so it wouldn’t catch a direct face shot unless I sat up.

I didn’t tell Leah, of course. I wasn’t sure how she’d react, and I didn’t want to scare her off. But who am I kidding? I was the one who was scared.

Part of me still believed she was just an incredibly private person with a flair for theatrical eccentricity.

\---

The first night, the camera recorded six hours of footage. When I watched it the next morning, it caught nothing strange—just me sleeping alone.

I tried again the next night. Same deal. Except this time, the file had a gap.

From 12:04 to 5:57, the footage was nothing but static—gray-white noise, like a broken signal. 

Five hours, just gone.

The timestamps from the previous two nights were the same. So I checked the files again.

Same thing.

I lay awake that night—either from insomnia, which comes and goes, from my mind doing mental gymnastics, trying to think of every reasonable explanation for the missing footage.

So I sat in the dark, waiting for her to appear.

She arrived at 12:06. She walked in from the kitchen like she’d been there all along. She flashed me that alluring smile and offered to make me tea.

I didn’t answer. I just stared, trying to focus on this strange woman in the dim light.

“Hello, silly, are you awake?” she asked, still smiling. She repeated, “I’m about to fix myself some tea. Want some?”

“Sure,” I said. Then I asked if she knew about the camera.

She didn’t answer right away.

Instead, she poured the tea, stirred in a little honey, and handed me the mug like nothing was wrong.

Then she sat beside me—close, calm. “I don’t like being recorded.”

I hesitated. “Why not?”

She looked straight at me—soft, steady, unblinking.

“Because if you try again… you might not wake up.”

She said it like she was reminding me to take out the trash. Not angry. Not threatening. Just... stating a fact.

Then she kissed me gently on the side of my head and asked, almost sweetly, “So—what movie are we in the mood for tonight?”

I didn’t touch the camera again. Haven’t recorded her since.

After that night, things started changing. She stopped leaving at 5:57. Instead, she stayed a little longer each time—a minute, two, then five.

\---

It really began at 3 AM.

I woke to find her naked, lying beside me. I asked what she was doing there—I didn’t remember going to bed, and I certainly would’ve remembered going to bed with her.

She didn’t answer. She just kissed me—slow, gentle. Then, without hesitation, she slid on top of me and guided my hands to her hips. We didn’t speak.

When it was over, she collapsed beside me, resting her head on my chest. I must’ve dozed off, because when I woke at 5:57, she was still there.

She smiled and whispered, “You looked so peaceful.""

Then she was gone—except for the faint smell of her shampoo on the sheets.

Soon, it wasn’t just the timing.

Leah still came after midnight and left around sunrise, but her schedule stopped making sense. Some nights she arrived at 12:10. Other times, closer to 1.

\---

One Thursday, just to give you an idea—I’d just finished brushing my teeth. It was about five minutes before midnight, around the time she usually showed up. I turned off the bathroom light and stepped into the hallway...

And there she was. Standing there. Watching me. Like she’d been there the whole time.

She didn’t say a word. Just smiled and walked past me into the living room.

But her strange timing and silent entrances weren’t the worst part.

It was her footsteps.

There were moments—late at night—when she’d cross the room, and I’d hear absolutely nothing.

No creak.

No hint of weight on the floorboards that always groaned, even when you tiptoed.

Just complete, unnatural silence.

\---

It got more disturbing the longer we spent together. Not just the subtle things like her footsteps, but other details that never added up.

For example, she knew things about my childhood no one but my parents should have known...

She mentioned the Teen-Aged Mutant Ninja Turtles bed sheet I had when I was a kid—-and how she thought it was so adorable it had been my favorite bedcover. 

 And she was right. That was my favorite bedsheet. 

But I never told her that, in fact I never told her anything about my childhood. Yet she said it like she had been there or something.  She’d casually mention the names of people I haven't spoken to in years. 

 One night we were watching a movie and she quoted a line from it before the character said it. It was one of those really obscure lines—some throwaway bit of dialogue about a coffee machine. It wasn’t anything well known like *Frankly my dear I don’t give a damn.* You know, something the average person might know. 

When I laughed and asked her how she knew, she just looked at me like she didn’t understand the question.

I learned not to push. In fact I learned to stop asking her questions for the most part.  

\---

Still, I began questioning myself — even my sanity.  *What is she?* That question ran through my mind every moment I spent with her. 

Two days ago, I tried to take a break from her.

I went off-grid, I turned off the phone, unplugged the router, packed a few clothes into a duffel bag and left the apartment. I drove around town looking for a place to stay until I wound up at a Travelodge parking lot. I checked in, and didn't tell anyone where I was.

When I got my key card at the front desk I went straight to my room.  I shut the blinds. 

I turned on the TV and I sat on the edge of the bed half expecting her to show up at midnight,  and half hoping she wouldn't.

 I opened the drawer beside the bed and found a bible — yeah one of those complimentary bibles you can find in most hotel rooms in the country, left there by a group called The Gideons. 

Though I was raised  Catholic, I've never really been a believer. But I found myself reading it just to kill time, waiting for midnight to pass. Before I knew it, it was 1AM and no Leah. 

I thought maybe my plan had worked — that distance mattered. That first night, I didn’t feel her presence. I figured maybe I could finally get some sleep without waking up to her beside me. As beautiful as she was, I’d begun to fear her.

The second night was different.

\---

This time, she knocked.

It was 12:07. Soft at first. Measured. For a second, I thought maybe housekeeping had the wrong room. Or some drunk guest looking for a friend.

Then came the second knock — louder. I froze. Held my breath. By the fifth knock, I heard her voice through the door.

“Nate. Please open up. I know you’re in there. You don’t have to be scared of me. I love you. Just open the door.”

I didn’t move. Sat there in that cheap chair, hands clenched, heart pounding like a drum.

The knocking kept going — steady, patient. Like she had all the time in the world.

After a few minutes, it stopped. And didn’t start again.  
  
\---

 I didn’t sleep that night. Kept the lights on. Propped the chair against the door like it would actually help. But it was all I had.

That morning, I went downstairs and asked the woman at the front desk if anyone had come by my room around midnight. She said no one had signed in or asked for me.

But she did mention one strange thing — right around that same time, the hallway camera outside my door glitched. Static, just for a few minutes.

\---

When I came back to my apartment later that day, everything was exactly how I’d left it.

Except for one thing:

The mug she always used was sitting on the counter.

I don’t think Leah’s human.

I suspected that almost from the first night she showed up.

I don’t know what she is, or how long she’s been doing this, or how many people she’s done it to. I just know she’s getting stronger.

\---

That night, I woke again at 3 a.m., with no memory of going to bed.

She was beside me — naked, watching me like before.

But even in the dark, I saw her smile was different.

No warmth. No affection. Nothing I’d come to expect.

She didn’t speak. Just climbed on top of me — no pause, no tenderness.

This wasn’t like before.

It was rough. Disconnected.

Mechanical, like she was using this moment to punish.

Like I wasn’t a person anymore — just a thing.

I didn’t stop her. I didn’t even move.

When it ended, she didn’t curl into me.

She just lay there. Eyes open. Breathing steady.

Staring at the ceiling, like she was waiting for something else to happen.

I rolled onto my side, but I didn’t sleep.

Just listened to the radiator clicking in the corner and stared at the wall, waiting for morning.

\---

Now she’s staying longer.

She’s showing up earlier.

She’s learning more about me — more than anyone should be able to know.

And part of me is terrified that if I try to leave again…

She won’t knock.

She’ll already be inside.

\---

I spent the next two days digging through that insomnia forum where I first met Leah.

Her username — midnight\_sister — was gone.



No post history. No deleted comments.

Nothing.

Like she’d never been there.

But the original thread was still up:

**“Anyone else feel like time changes after midnight?”**

Most of the replies were junk — half-asleep stoner ramblings, weird movie analogies, people joking about time loops. But one stood out. A user called *Archivist29* had replied almost a year before I joined:

*“it does. Especially if she’s already found you.Leave now. Don’t let her in, no matter how much you think* you love *her.”*

That was the only comment they ever posted. No profile pic, no post history, nothing. But their bio had one thing in it:

[**Archivist29@protonmail.com**](mailto:Archivist29@protonmail.com)

I almost decided not to contact him. But that night, Leah arrived at 11:56 PM. She didn’t say anything. She simply walked in and stood at the foot of my bed, watching me and waiting.

When I finally looked up and met her gaze, she smiled and said, “Don’t you dare do that again.”

\---

The next morning, I emailed Archivist29. I told him I needed to speak with him. I kept the message brief—just the basic details. I wrote that I thought I had met her too.

He replied within an hour and agreed to meet in person.

His name was Wren. Early 50s, sharp blue eyes with a slight tremor in his hands. He worked in a basement office below a private archive in Oberlin, Ohio. 

The office smelled like old paper and stale tobacco, with a faint trace of cedarwood and something musky I couldn’t place.The office was silent except for a white noise machine. He poured coffee into mismatched mugs, then lit a cigarette with a Zippo. 

“I  met Julia in ’95,” he said, voice rough like gravel. “Rancid show in Sacramento. She smiled at me like we’d already known each other a lifetime.”

I leaned forward, heart skipping. “Julia?”

Wren’s laugh was short, humorless. “She wasn’t Leah back then. No. Sometimes Julia, sometimes Claire, sometimes Adira. Soft names—like spells to soothe the soul.”

He stubbed out the cigarette, fingers shaking as he crushed the ash. I noticed the fine lines around his eyes deepen — a man worn down by more than time.

“What is she, really?” I asked, voice barely a whisper.

Wren didn’t answer right away. He stared down at his clasped hands, then back at the cigarette butt.

“She’s not a ghost,” he finally said. “Ghosts get stuck, trapped in time, repeating the same moment. But she… she moves, shifts, bends to fit you. Feeds on the silence between your thoughts.”

His eyes glossed over for a moment, and I caught a glimpse of something raw — loss, regret, a memory too heavy to hold. 

“I lost myself,” he said quietly. “Six months, I thought I was in love. Then six more, realizing I couldn’t remember my own brother’s face. Or my mother’s voice or my dad’s name. She doesn’t just haunt you—she takes pieces, eats them whole.”

He pulled a worn notebook from the desk, fingers tracing the cover like it was the only thing left. “This saved me. My only anchor.”

He slid it toward me.

“I wrote down everything—my name, my address, the songs I liked, people I loved. Because I couldn’t trust what was in my head anymore. She was rewriting me.”

I flipped through the pages slowly—names, dates, receipts, bits of lives glued down like evidence in a case no one else believed existed.

Then he said it.

“She’s a succubus.”

I looked up.

Wren’s eyes were fixed on mine—sharp, focused.

“Not the kind you read about in dusty folklore or religious texts. No wings or horns. Just hunger. She doesn’t seduce you with lust. She uses love. Intimacy. Loneliness to manipulate. She reshapes herself into whatever hurts just right.”

My throat tightened. “But… I thought succubi were—”

He cut me off. “Demons? Maybe. Parasites? Definitely. She doesn’t drain your body. She drains *you*. Your identity. Your memory. Your shape.”

I shifted in my seat, rubbing my hands together.  “But if she’s not bound by walls or locks… then why didn’t she just show up in my hotel room? Why knock?”

Wren gave a short tired laugh — not amused.  He took a drag of his cigarette, exhaled slowly, and said,

“Because she hadn’t claimed that space yet.”

I frowned. “Claimed?”

“She roots herself in places. Grows inside them like black mold under the wallpaper. She needs time. Repetition. Emotion. Your apartment? That’s hers now. You invited her.  You fed her every night without knowing it.”

He tapped the table. “But that hotel? Cold. Temporary. No history there.  She doesn’t have a foothold there. Not yet. And she doesn’t like being shut out.”

\---

That was a week ago.

Since then, I’ve filled two notebooks. Every detail I can think of I wrote in there — meals I’ve eaten,my first dog's name, weird dreams, the names of my old teachers, even the name of the girl I had my first kiss with back in middle school.  I’ve even written down the smell of my childhood bedroom and the exact layout of my grandmother’s house. Anything that might stick. 

I even tried to leave.

It was sometime just before dawn.  I packed a small bag—wallet, charger, an old hoodie,and no plan, just the raw instinct to run. I made it to the front door.

 I twisted the knob.

 It didn’t budge.

I thought maybe it was jammed, but there was no resistance. It just… wouldn’t open. 

I felt her behind me before I turned.

She was leaning against the wall, barefoot, wearing one of my shirts.

“Where would you go?” she asked, like she honestly wanted to know.

I didn’t answer. I couldn’t. 

She walked over, wrapped her arms around my waist, and rested her chin on my shoulder.

“You’re safe here,” she said. “You don’t have to remember everything. Just stay with me.”

I don’t remember unpacking. I don’t remember going back to bed. But when I woke just after 7 a.m., my bag was gone — and she was still there.

I ripped open the letter to discover my Bethel application had been accepted. They wanted me to report to the headquarters of the Watchtower Bible and Tract Society on March 23, 1970. I was thrilled to say the least. My prayers had been answered. My new life at *the Lord’s House* could now begin.

I sold off and gave away everything I owned. There was no need for any of it. A couple of bags of clothing were all I would need. My sister, Carol, got my car. My mother and she had moved to Manhattan, Kansas, the year before to serve where *the need was greater.*

Mom had wanted my sister to go to her last year of high school in Kansas and not California with *all its worldly influences.*

This was just another one of Mom's extended trips away from Dad. I found out years later that she had never told my father about her move to Kansas. He found out after she was on the road heading east. He came home from work one day to find a homemade pie on the kitchen counter. She had made his favorite kind of pie—my mother could be a very thoughtful person. Under the pie was a note. “Carol and I have moved to Kansas. You can do what you want now. Love, Norma.” I guess, just like my grandfather, she didn’t like to tell people where she was going. My mother knew Armageddon was coming soon and she didn’t want to be in Southern California when it happened. As I mentioned before my mom left my father many times over the years. She always came back, though, until the final time when she left him and she didn’t come back. My Father always supported her and sent her money no matter where she was living. In his own strange way, he still loved her. However, she treated him terribly for not being the *spiritual head* of our family.

The Salina congregation gave me a nice going away party. Cake, coffee with an a couple of friends and a few old ladies. My good friends Tom and Judy Yahtzee were also there, to wish me well. The Yahtzees had moved to Kansas from Colorado to help out our struggling congregation. Tom had always felt bad because he didn’t go to Bethel like his older brother Walter. No glory for Tom, he was just a good Publisher with a wife and two kids, who decided to settle down and get married. I thought about Tom years later at Bethel, how he had always wanted the glory of Bethel service. It would take a few years at Bethel for me to realize he had what I really wanted all along: to be normal, with a wife and a couple of kids. But at the time I felt superior to him because he had *copped out* and took the easy way. I felt sorry for him because he had missed out on the grand adventure and glory of Bethel service right before the end of this *old system.*

I decided to go to New York a few days early. The reason being Saturday, March 21st, was the Passover or the *Memorial of Christ’s death.* This is the most important day of the year among Jehovah’s Witnesses. For many people who still call themselves Jehovah’s Witnesses but are inactive, this is the only meeting they still attend every year. So, I thought what better place to attend *the Memorial* than the world headquarters—the home of our president N.H Knorr and the soon to be appointed *Governing Body.* To be at the *Holy of Holies* in the last days of this *old system*!

I landed at Laguardia Airport at about 6 p.m. on Friday, March 20th. There was no welcoming committee. There wouldn’t be of course, since nobody knew I was coming.

I was looking forward to my first taxi ride. I must have looked pretty confused standing on the curb in front of the airport.

A nice older Italian guy picked up my bags and put them in his cab.

“What are you waiting for?” He asked. “Get in.”

I did and we were off.

“Where to?” He asked.

I got out my letter. “124 Columbia Heights, that’s in Brooklyn.”

“Okay, have you ever been there before?”

“Nope,” I said.

“So, where did you fly in from, kid?”

“Kansas.”

“Kansas? Have you ever been to New York before?”

“Yes. My dad’s family are from the Bronx. But I don’t know anything about Brooklyn.”

“Well, welcome. It’s going to be a little bit of a trip, but I’ll get you there, buddy.”

“Great.”

He got me there all right, but it turned out to be the longest and most expensive cab ride of my life. I saw most of Brooklyn and parts of Queens. I think I saw the Verrazano Bridge at least twice.

He talked about his family and crazy wife. I talked about moving to *the world headquarters of the Jehovah’s Witnesses.* He wasn’t impressed at all. I guess he got tired of talking to me because after two hours of driving around me around Brooklyn he dropped me off in front of the building that is 124 Columbia Heights. The massive red brick building has a huge three-story watch tower on its top. The building was bought in 1909 and refurbished as a dormitory in 1927. This building symbolized the world headquarters of the Jehovah’s Witnesses. This is the building that is on the cover of this book.

He got my bags out of the trunk and put them by the front door.

“How much do I owe you?” I asked.

$109.50 kid,” he said.

I gave him $110 and started walking toward my bags.

“Hey, kid! What, no tip? You’re in New York now, not Kansas anymore…you got to tip here!”

I turned around and gave him another $10. He put the money in pocket and never even thanked me. I had come to New York with $300, and I was down to just $180.

Thirty-eight years later, I worked as a cab driver in Portland, Oregon. I would have never dreamed of ripping someone off, like this guy did to me. The cab ride should have been only twenty minutes away from the airport and not two hours. I got the ride of my life getting to Bethel, little did I know I would be getting the ride of my life after I got there too. This this guy was just the *voice of Christmas future* of my next four years at the *Lord's house*.

However, at the time, the cab fare didn’t matter. I would have given him everything I had to get to that spot. I found out later, it would take me almost six months working at Bethel to make enough money to pay for this one cab ride.

I was standing in front of the 124 building, the world headquarters. This truly was one of the defining moments of my life. Everything before this was just preparation for what was on the other side of those doors. I made it. The rest of my life would be gravy from here on out. As Kurt Vonnegut once said it so perfectly: “I went to New York to be born again.”

I grabbed my bags and went through the doors and up a couple of steps. The first Bethelite I saw was a guy talking on the phone at the reception desk. He seemed about my age. I stood in front of him until he looked up.

He put his hand over the receiver. “Can I help you?”

“Yes, I’m Keith…Keith Casarona.”

“Okay, Keith. Can I help you?”

With a shit eating grin on my face that only a *new boy* could have I said. “I’m here to report for Bethel service.”

He got a disgruntled look on his face and went back to talking on the phone. “Hey, Tom, I’ll call you back later. I got a *new boy* here I need to deal with.”

He hung up the phone and opened a desk draw. He got out a much of papers and started looking through them.

“What’s your name again?” “Keith Casarona.”

He had a confused look on his face. “When were you supposed to check in anyway?”

“Monday, the 23rd.”

He gave me another disgruntled look. “This is Friday the 20th.”

“Yes, I know. I decided to come early.”

He shook his head. “You decided to come early…great. Do me a favor and grab your bags and wait in the lounge.” He pointed straight ahead. ""This could take a while.”

As I grabbed my bags and walked into the lounge, I thought to myself, I guess I'm the *new boy.*

I soon found out that this and other phrases used there, are all part of a exclusive Bethel jargon. Even to this day, many of these terms and phrases will only be understood by another Bethelite.

All this will all be discussed in greater detail in Chapter 21.

I dropped my bags into a chair and looked out of the picture windows at the wonderful views of the New York harbor and the Brooklyn Bridge. There were thousands of twinkling lights all over lower Manhattan. The lounge looked like something out of the 1940s art deco period with its overstuffed couches and ornate décor. There was a big black piano in the corner begging for someone to play a George Gershwin melody. There was a group of young men and women chatting in the corner. I felt I was part of the thousands of Bethelites who had been in this very spot before me. I was now in the club...their club. The happiest moments of my Bethel experience proved to be those first few minutes standing there in the lounge of the 124 building, overlooking the East River. I was home at last.

Years later, the Society would sell off all of these properties for almost a billion dollars. They would get 105 million just for the 124 Columbia Heights building alone, in 2016. This building would turn into the most expensive apartment complex in all Brooklyn *""The Torre House""* with units renting for over $15,000 a month in 2024! Home of 101 multi million dollar condos units with a swimming pool on its roof.

Of course, this building was were Russell, Rutherford, use to live and where Knorr and all the other *Bethel heavies* were living like kings.

The Society has owned some of the most expensive pieces of real estate in all of Brooklyn. The Brooklyn Heights area is one of the most upscale neighborhoods in all of New York city. Just a few feet below the 124 building is the world-famous promenade where dozens of motion pictures have been made over the years. This included Annie Hall, Moonstruck, Saturday Fever, Sophie's choice, Prizzi's Honor and dozens of others.

Just across the East River, in that lounge you could see the World Trade Centers as they were under construction in lower Manhattan. I had no idea at that moment, that on the very day those buildings were destroyed, on September 11, 2001 that very day, thirty one years later, I too would lose most of my family and all my friends by making the decision to leave the Jehovah's Witnesses.

I continued to look out the windows until the brother from the front desk came and got me.

“This is Larry,” he said, as he introduced me to another brother. “He’ll show you to your room.” I grabbed my bags and we headed out the front door and across the street, down about one-hundred yards to 129 Columbia Heights building. This was an older, rundown apartment building. It still had a lot of *worldly* people living in it at the time.

As we were walking there Larry asked “Where you from?”

“California, by way of Kansas.”

“Oh, don’t tell people you’re from California.”

“Why not?” I asked.

He smiled. “You’ll find out.”

He just informed me of the first of the many of unwritten rules that exist at Bethel. Rules that us *new boys* would have to find from others there or on our own.... painfully.

We walked up two flights of stairs and came to apartment 33. Larry knocked on the door.

Some guy my age in pajamas opened the door.

Larry looked at him and said. “This is your new roommate.” He turned and walked away.

My new roommate had a funny little smile on his face. “Hi I’m Stanley, welcome to the Ritz. Right this way.”

“I’m Keith.”

I quickly discovered that the 800-square-foot apartment I was in, had only one bedroom and one bathroom. I would be one of the seven guys living there, three guys in the living room, two guys in an alcove, and two guys in the ten-by-ten foot bedroom. The bedroom had two beds, two desks and two dressers. It was so small you had to go outside to change your mind. They put me in the bedroom with a Mexican kid from Texas. It turned out the 129 building was one of the oldest buildings the Society owned and definitely the most run down. It didn’t get a major remodel until many years later. A lot of “new boys” with little or no seniority started their Bethel service there.

I threw my bags on the bed and looked at Stanley. “I’m starving. Any place to get some food around here?”

“Well, there is a deli a couple blocks down the street if you have money. There is always breakfast tomorrow morning, I guess.”

If you have money? Did some Bethelites not have money, I wondered.

My head was spinning with all kinds of questions.

I didn't know it at the time, that this was the first day of my four-year journey. As it turn out I wouldn't be there *forever* as I promised Don Breaux.

Stanley took me back into the living room where I met a couple more of my new roommates.

“Hey guys, this is Keith.... *the new boy.*”

This is my first real setup, and I’m finally getting consistent shots — within a few grams each time. Feels like a win already!

Now I’m looking at upgrades and could use some advice: •	Thinking of getting a dosing cup that fits my portafilter better — just to clean up the workflow. •	As for tamping: I like the look and feel of a palm tamp, but I’ve also seen spring-loaded tamps for more consistent pressure. Are they worth the extra $$, or should I just stick to building good habits with what I’ve got?

On a side note — I’ve been having a lot of fun with the Nespresso mixer, especially on the cold setting. It makes a super creamy drink. Definitely not “true espresso,” but a fun little side toy.

Biggest question though: How do you all set your shot outputs on the machine? I don’t really do single shots — I’m thinking one button set to a 1:2 ratio and the other to a 1:3 for when I want something a bit longer. Smart move, or is there a better way to go about this?

you were sitting in the couch facing the entrance lobby and I noticed your hair is almost covering your eyes. You were laughing at your phone, probably over some meme you find funny. You didn’t notice me until I tapped your shoulder and said hi. you looked at me for a few seconds and smiled. “late ka, kanina pa ko dito,” you uttered while standing up and touched the ends of my hair. You were towering over me when i said that you were really early for a 5pm meeting time.

we went to 7/11 to buy snacks and went to my unit. as soon as i opened the door, you locked your hand on my wrist and dragged me to the sofa. I stood up and told you later and as if it was practiced you went in my room and turned the aircon on. i offered you coffee and you stood in front of the door. “Ang haba na ng buhok mo, hindi ako sanay. Mukha kang mabait.” You confessed. I smiled and thought six months of not seeing him made my hair long.

we were lying down when you asked how have i been doing and i told you I quit smoking. You looked at me and asked if that made me feel okay and I said yes and you just nodded for approval.

I could have sworn that your scent calmed my nerves. i could have also told you i missed you but that’s not who we are. 

We are conversations of our past traumas, your skin touching mine, the memes we both find funny, local indie bands, midnight kisses, and mcdonald takeouts.

The torture of our consensus of not daring to hold hands was always something I found ironic since I have touched every parts of you as you have mine. 

But that Saturday afternoon you unexpectedly held my hand, a moment I couldn’t instantly process but the feeling was a wave of panic and despair that I had to calm myself in order to be reminded that it was just an empty gesture. 

it could have been you. i was never the one to be certain about someone but i just needed your push that this could lead to somewhere regardless of the fact that we were both scared; but that isn’t who we are. we are the moans of the pain we try to conceal and the sheets of the night we try to hide ourselves from. 

“Huwag ka nang magpagupit. Mas gusto kong ganyan buhok mo,” it’s all i could confess while I enjoy the warmth of your hand.",1,1752012424.0,TheBigGirlDiary,0,1.0,False

1lv1svs,https://www.reddit.com/r/askdentists/comments/1lv1svs/loose_front_teeth_related_to_clenching/,Loose front teeth related to clenching,"NAD. Here is some background. 33 year old female. I drink regular soda and coffee occasionally. I very rarely drink beer and do not smoke. I brush 2x per day - using a manual toothbrush in the morning and an oral B OS electric toothbrush at night. I use Sensodyne and a prescription toothpaste for cavity prevention and sensitivity (dentist told me to add a little of each to my brush head). I use Act mouthwash in the morning and Listerine at night prior to brushing. My flossing ebbs and flows. I have flossed every day for the last month and a half otherwise it was a few times a week prior to that. 

 I had braces from 18-20ish years old. I have a permanent bottom retainer on my front teeth. I have a clear retainer, like Invisalign, for my top teeth. I used to have one for the bottom teeth after a few crowns and fillings it didn’t fit so I stopped wearing it. I was never told when or for how long to use my top retainer so I did stop wearing it regularly at night and would only use it for a week every few months. I have used it every day for the last month and a half at the recommendation of my dentist and it fits fine. It was a little snug at first but slips right in and out now.

My most recent dentist appointment was about 1.5 months ago. It was with a different dentist at my same dental office. They noticed my top front teeth are loose with the two center teeth being worse. I’ve noticed too. My bottom front teeth hit the back of the top front teeth when I bite down. They have always done that even prior to braces. For YEARS (decades) I have clenched my teeth (anxiety). I have tried to stop and can’t. I relax my jaw when I notice I’m doing it. They said it’s loose ligaments from my bottom teeth hitting the back of my top teeth and told me to wear my retainer, brush, and floss because I am much more likely to get an infection and lose my teeth. She seemed accusatory and judgmental with the way she communicated about this issue like I take bad care of my teeth. The first thing she noted on my exam was demineralization “from when I had my braces.” That’s flat out wrong. ALL white spots on my teeth are from when I was younger many years before I had my braces. I took ridiculously good care of my teeth when I had braces and feel like I still do despite occasionally slipping on flossing and clenching my teeth. While my teeth look nice in photos they have never been “healthy.” I’ve been told I have weak enamel since I was in early grade school. I had to go to the hospital to have teeth extracted when I was in grade school. Constant cavities when I was younger. I have had maybe 3 cavities since I’ve been in my teens. The more I write about this the more frustrated I am with my recent dentist appointment. My dad has had dentures since his early 50s. My brother has dentures since 35. My mom was starting to lose teeth and had a bridge in her early 50s but has passed away. 

I’m terrified of my teeth deteriorating. I try really hard with my teeth so I can have them as long as possible. I am scared of teeth pain. The dentist gives me anxiety. I go twice a year. 

Really I guess I would just like some recommendations about how to prevent or reverse the loose front teeth. I feel like I’m so vigilant with them so it’s really discouraging when I feel like what I do isn’t enough or that the dentist doesn’t trust me when I tell them how well I try to care for my teeth.

There’s a coffee shop I often go to when I want to relax and clear my head. A few weeks ago, I met an Amhara girl there. She had these beautiful, innocent eyes and a vibrant, joyful energy that really stood out. At first, I was just drawn to how she carried herself — lively, confident, and full of spirit.

But with time, I realized she wasn’t just energetic. She had a kind, sweet soul. Every time I saw her, even when I came with friends, I’d find myself drifting off, lost in thoughts about her. I’d forget I was even with people — that’s how deep she got into my mind.

Sadly, I recently found out that she’s going back to Ethiopia — and not coming back. I saw her last night and asked if that was true. She said yes. Before she left, I asked for her WhatsApp number, and she gave it to me. That gave me a little hope.

But here’s the twist — I don’t speak a word of Amharic. She doesn’t know Somali or English. She only knows some basic Arabic phrases, and even that isn’t enough for us to really communicate.

He was always into tech, which was fine, the last couple years have gotten out of control with his obsession with making our house ""smart.""

It started innocently with some smart bulbs and a video doorbell. But now everything in our house needs an app or voice command to work. Every door has a smart lock, every window has smart blinds, every outlet has a smart switch, there are smart sensors on all faucets, and he even got a smart toilet I can't figure out how to flush without my phone. (I'm way past asking)

Yesterday was my breaking point. I left work early with a terrible migraine and my phone almost dead at 2% battery. All I wanted was to get inside, take my meds, and rest in a dark room. But our WiFi was down so the smart lock wouldn't work. My phone died before I could try the backup cellular system he installed.

I had to sit on our front porch in the sun with my migraine for two hours waiting for Alex to return. He had disabled the regular key lock because it was a ""security vulnerability."" I borrowed our neighbor's phone to call him, but he was in meetings with his phone on DND.

When he arrived, instead of apologizing, he got excited about adding more backup systems to prevent this from happening again. He completely missed that I don't want more tech solutions. I just want to enter my house without needing an app.

This morning made things worse. I couldn't make coffee because he replaced our normal coffee maker with a fancy smart one that ""learns our preferences"" but needs WiFi to work (which was still down). Even the microwave was unusable because it's connected to his system.

I snapped. I told him he needs to choose between me or this smart home obsession. I'm done living in a house where I need tech support just to turn on lights or use the bathroom. He got defensive, saying I'm being dramatic and should appreciate how he's ""improving"" our home. He claims I'm ""holding back progress"" and this is how all homes will be soon.

Here's the thing: I'm a software developer myself, so I understand home automation. But this isn't about convenience anymore. It feels obsessive and controlling. He's spent thousands on this system and keeps adding more complicated features.

I was able to smell some of the candles and body products I had in my cart while I was there for 12 min. I went from 41 items to 12! I did buy the vampire blood candle with the bat/heart decorative lid. It’s more than likely going back. To me it doesn’t have the throw I recall from last year. After I get another nose on it then its faith will be determined.  I hope expresso martini comes out in a 3 week. I love the coffee scents! The store I went to didn’t look as cute as some that have been posted. I’ll try another store this weekend.,4,1752011879.0,bathandbodyworks,0,1.0,False

1lv1jyh,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1lv1jyh,How should I style around my fireplace?,"I am thinking perhaps bookshelves as I love to read and have always wanted a large bookshelf. But should I do it on one side, or both? Will the door (which leads to our bedroom) be in the way? Wooden shelves or white? Cabinets? I'm at am impasse. I would like to keep the circular firewood holder cause I think it's pretty though and very useful in the winter. 

A couple other things to note (because people might comment about them): the gross couch against the french doors will eventually be tossed out. It's for our senior dog (not the one pictured, that's our goofy younger one), and it's really the only spot most days he can comfortably lie on. So it'll be there until he passes as it's important to him, so it's important to me. Also, I know the coffee table is far too large, but my kids are pretty little and it was I think $10 and it's sturdy. Enough to endure daily use!  Willing to change it down the line for something nicer when the time comes my kids won't accidentally destroy a nice new one lol

I am up for any suggestions on how to make this place nicer and more homey, I just wanted to put that out there for now. It's a work in progress :) Thank you all in advance",1,1752011703.0,interiordecorating,0,1.0,False
1lv1j7j,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1lv1j7j/i_broke_up_with_a_long_time_friend_aitah/,I broke up with a long time friend… AITAH?,"My longtime friend recently (2 yrs ago) had a kid with her husband. They’ve been having a tough time adjusting and everything is a major problem with her. 

She has leaned on me for way too long with her relationship issues, job insecurities and family drama. I’m consistently that friend - always lending an ear. I usually don’t mind but I’ve been taking some inventory and looking a little closer at myself. 

This friend will send me a barrage of texts before I’ve even had a cup of coffee. My husband this my kid that my mother my sister my boss. Always some kind of drama.  I’ve asked her a few times to work on dealing with these issues with on her own and not 24 hours later I heard a whole new set of problems.  I stopped replying. She stopped sending.  I didn’t feel good about it so I rang her to ask abt her day and is the kid saying anything funny. Well that conversation turned into the same bs it always does. She never asks how I am or if I need advice  - just a little reciprocity would be nice. Nada

So I told her that it’s very hard to be your therapist (I am not one nor do I play one of TV). Please consider another resource to vent to. Well now I’m an asshole and heartless and being a terrible friend. She is 45 years old. I’m older and just don’t have the space for her daily problems. We’ve been friends for 25+ years and I feel some kind of guilt I think. AITAH? ",2,1752011649.0,AITAH,2,1.0,False

1lv1hsk,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1lv1hsk/i_received_an_insurance_check_for_something_that/,I received an insurance check for something that didn't happen,"The storybook was old, the kind of yellow-paged paperback you'd find buried in a church rummage sale bin. The cover had been taped back on years ago, long before Silvia could read the title for herself. But she didn’t need to. She already knew how it ended.

I sat on the edge of her hospital bed, the one wedged into what used to be a playroom and now buzzed with machinery I still didn’t fully understand. The story rolled from my lips on autopilot.

“Then the Big Bad Wolf said, ‘Little pig, little pig, let me come in.’”

Silvia’s voice was paper thin. “Not by the hair of my chinny chin chin.”

I smiled and looked up from the book. Her eyes, watery and sunken but still bright with some kind of impossible strength, held mine. Her bald head caught the soft yellow glow of her bedside lamp, and a thin, clear tube ran from her IV pole into her arm, the only arm not buried in stuffed animals and a threadbare quilt Margaret had sewn when we found out we were having a girl.

Margaret. God, if she could see all this now.

The monitor to Silvia’s left gave its soft, rhythmic beep. A lullaby in reverse. Not calming. Just… constant.

I read through the rest of the story, each word falling heavier than the last. The pigs survived. The wolf didn’t win. Happy ending. Always.

I closed the book and brushed a wisp of invisible hair from Silvia’s forehead. Habit. She hadn’t had hair in over a year now.

“That was a good one,” she said softly.

“It’s always been your favorite.”

“I like the third pig,” she said. “He’s smart. He makes a house that doesn’t fall over.”

I nodded, trying to mask the lump in my throat. “Yeah. He’s the smartest of them all.”

Silvia yawned, then frowned. “Is Grandma Susan staying tonight?”

“She is.”

She looked away, lips puckering. “Why can’t *you* stay?”

I sighed and kissed her forehead, lingering there a moment longer than usual. “I’ve got to work, sweetheart.”

“You’re always working.”

Then came the cough. Deep, hacking, cruel. Her tiny hands clenched at the quilt. I reached for the suction tube, but it passed quickly. Just a cruel reminder.

I stroked her hand, smiling down at her with everything I could scrape together. “I’m trying really hard not to work *more*, baby.”

Her face softened. She turned away, snuggling deeper into the blanket. “Okay…”

I sat there for another minute, just watching her. The slight rise and fall of her chest. The beep… beep… beep… from the monitor. The pale light on her face. Her skin was translucent now, like her blood didn’t know where to hide.

My mom, Susan, would be in soon. She stayed over most nights now. I don’t know what I’d do without her. Probably lose my mind entirely.

I worked construction during the day, long, backbreaking hours in the cold Wisconsin wind. Then came the deliveries. GrubRunner, FoodHop, DineDash, whatever app was paying. I spent most evenings ferrying burgers and pad thai to apartment complexes that all looked the same.

The debt… it was like being buried under wet cement. Silvia’s treatment costs were nightmarish even *with* insurance. And everything else didn’t pause just because you were drowning. Mortgage. Groceries. Utilities. Gas. There were days I swore the air cost money too.

I slept in snatches. Lived in overdrive. Every moment I wasn’t working, I felt like I should be.

But right then, as I stood and tucked the quilt around Silvia’s legs, I let myself pretend things were normal.

“Goodnight, baby girl.”

“Night, Daddy.”

Her voice was barely louder than the monitor.

I turned off the lamp, and for a brief second, the darkness felt peaceful.

Then I opened the door and stepped out into the hall.

Back into the weight of straw.

The doorbell rang. I paused halfway down the hallway and turned back toward Silvia’s room. “That’s Grandma,” I said gently, poking my head in. “She’s here to keep you company.”

Silvia mumbled something sleepy in reply, eyes already fluttering closed.

I headed to the front door and opened it to find my mother, Susan, bundled against the chill with her overnight bag in one hand and a small stack of envelopes in the other.

“Evening,” she said softly, stepping inside and handing me the letters. “Got the mail for you.”

“Thanks, Ma,” I said, taking them from her.

She gave me a once-over and pursed her lips. “You look tired.”

“I am,” I said, holding up the stack. “And I don’t get to sleep much while these keep showing up.”

Her eyes lingered on the envelopes, face creasing with a mixture of concern and resignation. She gave my shoulder a gentle squeeze.

“I’ll go check on her,” she said.

I nodded, thumbing through the letters as she made her way upstairs. I could hear her soft footsteps creaking along the old hardwood as she headed to Silvia’s room.

Bills. Bills. Another bill. A grim parade of due dates and balances I couldn’t meet.

Then one envelope stood out.

It was cream-colored, thick, not the usual stark white of medical statements. In the upper-left corner, printed in silver ink, was a stylized logo: a darkened moon with a sliver of light just beginning to eclipse it.

**Eclipse Indemnity Corporation**.

Addressed to me.

I stared at the logo for a long moment. I’d never heard of the company before. It didn’t sound familiar, but the envelope didn’t look like junk mail either. I pushed the stack of bills aside and tore the flap open carefully.

Inside was a letter.

The opening lines made my stomach drop.

“We offer our sincerest condolences for the tragic loss of your home and beloved child, Silvia, in the recent house fire. Enclosed you will find the settlement documents related to claim #7745-A…”

I blinked, reading it again, sure I’d misunderstood. But the words were there, printed in elegant serif type. The death of my child. The destruction of my house. A fire that had never happened.

My heart beat faster. My lips curled in a grimace. What kind of sick scam was this?

Then my eyes landed on the settlement amount.

Three hundred thousand dollars for the wrongful death of Silvia.

Five hundred thousand for the destruction of the house.

A check slid out from between the folds of the letter, perfectly printed and crisp, made out in my name. **$800,000**.

My hand trembled as I held it. The paper felt real. The signature, the watermark, the routing information, all of it looked legitimate.

It wouldn’t last forever. Not even close. But maybe… maybe I could stop delivering food until two in the morning. Maybe I could finish my degree. Get a better job. With benefits. Maybe I could be home more. Take Silvia to her appointments. Actually be there.

My mind ran wild with possibilities, wheels spinning on a road that hadn’t existed five minutes ago.

“Frank?”

I jolted.

Susan stood in the kitchen doorway, holding up a bag of lemons. “I brought some fresh ones. Mind if I make lemonade?”

I blinked at her. “Uh… yeah. Sure. That’s fine.”

She smiled and turned toward the counter.

“What’s that you’re holding?” she asked casually.

“Oh, nothing,” I said quickly. “Just one of those fake checks they send out. You know, to get you to trade in your car or refinance or something.”

I folded the letter and the check in one motion and slid them into my back pocket.

Susan gave me a look, but didn’t press. She turned to the sink, humming softly as she washed the lemons.

I stood there, staring at nothing, my mind still on the number.

Eight hundred thousand dollars.

For a life that hadn’t been lost.

Susan nodded from the sink, her voice drifting back to me. “She’s already drifting off. That medication makes her so sleepy, poor thing. But I’m going to make a pitcher of lemonade for when she wakes up tomorrow. Let it chill overnight.”

I nodded absently. “She’ll love that.”

I stepped forward and gave my mom a hug. “Thanks again, Ma.”

She held on tight for a moment. “Be safe tonight.”

I left quietly, climbing into the truck parked in the driveway. Once inside, I pulled out the check again and stared at it under the dome light.

It had to be a scam. I didn’t have insurance through any Eclipse Indemnity Corporation. Hell, I didn’t have homeowners insurance. I didn’t have life insurance, for myself or for Silvia.

I thought about tearing it in half. Raising it to the edge of the steering wheel, pressing it just enough to crease.

But I couldn’t. I couldn’t bring myself to do it.

So I drove. House to house. Door to door. Smelling like fries and grease by the time the clock crawled toward three a.m. My hands still checked my pocket between orders, feeling the folded slip of paper there. The weight of what it promised. The sick feeling of what it implied.

By the time I turned back onto my street, I’d made a decision.

I’d go to the bank first thing in the morning.

See if the check was even real.

The bank opened at eight. I was waiting in the parking lot at seven forty-five, holding a paper cup of gas station coffee that I hadn’t touched. I stepped in as the doors unlocked and made my way to the counter.

The teller was a young woman with kind eyes and a tired smile. I handed over the check without ceremony.

Her smile faltered as her eyes scanned the numbers.

She looked up at me. “I’m going to need to check with my manager on this. One moment.”

She disappeared into the back, check in hand.

Minutes passed. My legs started to ache. My mind spiraled.

Of course it was fake. I’d just handed some poor teller a piece of garbage. Probably thought I was a scammer.

Then she returned. Smiling again. A little more carefully.

“It cleared,” she said. “The funds have been deposited. You’ll see them in your account shortly.”

She handed me a printed receipt. It showed the balance. All of it.

I stared at the paper.

Eight hundred thousand dollars.

I swallowed hard. “Thanks,” I said softly.

And then I walked out into the morning light, my head spinning with possibilities I didn’t know how to believe in yet.

I climbed back into my truck and immediately pulled out my phone. My fingers trembled slightly as I opened the banking app. Sure enough, the check had cleared. Eight hundred thousand dollars sat in my account like a cinder block.

I stared at it in disbelief. Then, without meaning to, I slammed my fist against the roof of the cab and let out a sharp, guttural yell. Not joy. Not anger. Something heavier. A release of pressure I hadn’t even realized had been building.

I called in sick. Said I had a fever, maybe food poisoning. Didn’t wait for a reply. I just started the engine and headed home.

When I pulled up to the house, a strange sound hit me, sharp and shrill, echoing through the front windows.

The fire alarm.

I threw the truck into park and ran to the front door, flinging it open with my heart already pounding.

Smoke wafted through the air from the kitchen. Not heavy, but thick enough to haze the room. Grandma Susan stood at the stove, waving a dish towel furiously at the ceiling. The toaster oven was smoking lightly, a blackened pastry visible through the glass.

“Sorry!” she called over the blaring alarm. “I thought five minutes would be okay. I just wanted to crisp them up a little.”

I rushed over and helped her wave the smoke away. The alarm, finally detecting clear air, chirped twice and went silent.

From upstairs came Silvia’s voice, frail and frightened. “Daddy? What’s happening?”

Susan looked over at me. “Why are you home so early?”

“Site’s missing materials,” I said quickly. “They sent us home.”

It was a lie. A clean, easy one. I didn’t have the energy to explain the truth.

“I’ll go up with you,” she said gently.

We climbed the stairs together and found Silvia sitting upright in bed, clutching her stuffed lamb.

“Hey,” I said, crossing the room and kneeling beside her. “Just a silly mistake downstairs. Grandma left the toaster on too long.”

Silvia’s eyes were wide, rimmed with worry. “Was it a fire?”

“Nothing like that,” I said, pulling her into a tight hug. The kind of hug only a dad could give when he thought he’d almost lost everything. “Just a burnt breakfast. That’s all.”

She nodded against my chest. “Okay.”

Then she pulled back, smiling sleepily. “I’m glad you’re home.”

I kissed her forehead. “Me too, sweetheart. Me too.”

I turned to Susan, who had stayed quietly in the doorway. “I think I’m going to take the day,” I said. “Catch up on bills, maybe just… be here for a while.”

Susan smiled, her face softening with that motherly warmth. “That sounds like a wonderful idea. You could use the rest.”

She went back downstairs and poured two glasses of lemonade, one for me, one for Silvia, before packing up her things. Before she left, she hugged us both tightly.

I set up my laptop on a folding tray in Silvia’s room while she flipped on her favorite cartoons. While she watched, giggling at some slapstick moment on screen, I quietly pulled up account after account and began chipping away at the mountain.

Electric. Phone. Credit cards. Medical bills. I paid them off in full, one after another. Each click lifted a weight off my chest, but with every cleared balance came a strange, crawling unease.

That fire downstairs… was it really just an accident?

Or had it started because I cashed that check?

I tried to shake the thought, but it lingered like smoke behind the eyes.

Silvia seemed more alert than usual. Her medication hadn’t kicked in yet, and she was drawing something on the tray next to her bed with thick crayons. When she finished, she held it up with both hands, beaming.

It was a picture of her and me, she had long, wavy hair, and I was wearing a bright yellow hard hat. We were holding hands in the backyard under a blue sky.

“I wanna do that again someday,” she said. “Be outside. Without all the wires.”

I kissed her forehead again, heart squeezing. “One day, I promise. We’ll be out there.”

She nodded seriously, folding the drawing and tucking it beside her bed. “I’m glad you’re home today. I miss you when you’re gone.”

I swallowed. “I miss you too, sweetheart. But you know what? I might not need to work as much anymore.”

Her eyes lit up. “Really?”

I nodded. “Really.”

She threw her arms around me and squealed. “Yay!”

While she napped, I applied for the next semester at the local university. Just two semesters shy of finishing my degree. Tuition paid in full. It felt surreal, like planting roots after drifting too long.

That night, I let Silvia pick dinner. She pointed to a local pizza place she’d only seen once, the kind that did gourmet pies and only allowed pickups. She just wanted a plain cheese pizza, of course.

I ordered it. For once, I wasn’t the one delivering someone else’s dinner, I was ordering my own to be delivered. It felt strangely empowering, like I’d crossed some invisible threshold. Expensive, sure, but tonight felt like a moment worth marking.

We ate on paper plates in bed, the glow of cartoons still dancing on the screen. Silvia barely made it through two slices before her eyelids started to flutter. Her medication pulled her under in gentle waves.

I kissed her goodnight and pulled the blanket over her chest.

She was already asleep.

I stepped into my room, lay down on the bed, and stared at the ceiling.

For the first time in what felt like forever, my muscles relaxed.

Sleep came quickly.

But it didn’t last.

The fire alarm blared.

I jolted upright, my heart thundering in my chest. Then I heard it, Silvia’s scream. High-pitched and full of terror, coming from her room.

I was out of bed and sprinting down the hall before I even registered moving. Smoke curled out from beneath her door. I grabbed the handle, already hot to the touch, and threw the door open.

“Silvia!” I screamed.

A wall of heat hit me like a truck. The moment the door opened, the backdraft exploded. Fire burst outward, roaring like a beast unleashed. The flames swallowed my daughter’s screams, turning them into echoes of agony.

The blast knocked me off my feet, slamming my head hard against the wall. Then, nothing.

When I opened my eyes again, I was on my back in an ambulance. The ceiling lights flickered overhead. Oxygen tubes. The scent of burned plastic and char. The wailing sound wasn’t a siren, it was Susan.

I tried to sit up, but a paramedic pressed me down gently. “You’ve got to stay still, sir. You’ve been burned pretty badly.”

I winced, groaning, pain flaring along my arms and neck. My skin felt tight and seared.

“Where’s Silvia?” I gasped. “Where is she?!”

Another paramedic, older, his eyes grim, stepped over.

I turned my head, trying to see past the doors. The house was just bones now, a skeleton charred black against the early morning sky.

“I’m sorry,” the paramedic said quietly. “We couldn’t get to her in time. The firemen think it started in her room. Electrical short from the medical equipment. There was nothing anyone could do.”

The words didn’t register. Couldn’t.

I screamed. Cursed. Fought against the straps holding me down until the pain overwhelmed me.

I should never have cashed that check.

None of [this ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4YPMBw6RZM)should have happened.

1lv1hkl,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1lv1hkl/im_a_graphic_designer_and_i_think_my_designs_are/,I’m a graphic designer and I think my designs are evil.,"I'm writing this because I don't know what else to do. I need someone to hear this, to maybe believe me. 

For the past eight years, I poured my soul into graphic design. Logos, brochures, website layouts – you name it. It was usually a demanding but rewarding job. Or, at least, it had been. Lately, my work felt… off. Not just creatively stale, but genuinely wrong.

It started subtly, a few months back, with a corporate rebranding project for a new tech startup. The client wanted something sleek, futuristic, with sharp angles and cool blues. I sketched out a few concepts, landed on one I liked, and started building it in Illustrator. I spent hours on the logo, perfecting every curve and gradient. But when I presented it to the client, they looked at me strangely.

""It's… almost perfect,"" the lead guy, Mark, said, frowning at the screen, ""But what's that little bit sticking out there, on the top right? It wasn't in the sketch.""

I leaned closer. He was right. A tiny, almost imperceptible sliver of a line, a single pixel, was protruding from one of the 'A's in the logo. It ruined the clean aesthetic. I hadn't put it there. I was meticulous. I deleted it, apologized, and we moved on. Just a momentary glitch, probably a mouse slip, I told myself.

Then came the brochure layout for a local cafe. I spent days on it, making sure the vintage coffee cup illustrations were perfectly aligned, the text flowing beautifully. I exported the PDF, sent it off. An hour later, an urgent call from the cafe owner.

""What happened to the coffee cup?"" she sounded frantic. ""It looks like it's… weeping.""

I opened my file. The small, charming illustration of a steaming coffee cup now had a faint, dark smudge trailing down from its rim, like a tear. And the steam rising from it looked less like steam and more like faint, wispy fingers curling upwards. I hadn't drawn that. My stomach tightened. I fixed it, blaming a corrupted file. But the image of the weeping cup lingered.

The incidents grew more frequent, more disturbing. A billboard design for a new apartment complex. I'd crafted a welcoming image of a sunny balcony, potted plants, and a comfortable armchair. When the print proof came back, the armchair was subtly different. Its legs looked too long, too spindly, almost like insect limbs. And lurking just at the edge of the balcony railing, half-hidden by a plant, was what looked like a faint, indistinct face peering out from the shadows of the apartment above. A face that was not human. I spent an hour trying to prove it was a trick of the light, a smudge on the print, but the more I stared, the more defined and malevolent it seemed. I had to manually edit it out pixel by pixel, feeling a cold dread seep into my bones.

My workspace had started to feel oppressive. My dual monitors, usually my creative playground, felt like they were watching me. I'd caught strange, momentary flashes in my peripherals – a pattern in a background gradient shifting, a font briefly displaying what looked like ancient, undecipherable script before snapping back to Helvetica. 

Sometimes, when my office was silent, I thought I could hear a faint, almost imperceptible hum emanating from my graphics tablet, like a distant, distorted whisper.

I tried talking to my colleague, Sarah, about it. ""My designs... they're changing themselves,"" I'd ventured, trying to sound normal. She just chuckled, ""Too much coffee? Happens to the best of us. Take a break."" 

No one saw it. No one believed me. But I had the files, the saved versions before the subtle corruptions, and the ones after. The evidence was there, screaming at me from my hard drive.

Last week, I started a new commission: a series of digital art pieces for a client's online gallery. They wanted abstract, dream-like landscapes. I began with a serene, ethereal forest scene, bathed in soft twilight. I worked late into the night, lost in the flow. I saved the file, turned off my monitors, and went to bed, exhausted but satisfied.

The next morning, I fired up my computer, ready for final tweaks. I opened the forest file.

The trees were no longer just trees. Their branches twisted into grotesque, skeletal arms, reaching towards a sky that was a violent, bruising purple. The soft twilight had been replaced by a pulsing, sickly green glow emanating from deep within the forest. And on the ground, scattered among gnarled roots that now resembled clutching fingers, were faint, blurry shapes. Shapes that looked disturbingly like human bodies, half-buried, half-consumed by the distorted landscape. And in the very center, where a serene clearing should have been, was a swirling vortex of blackness, bleeding into the digital canvas like an inkblot.

I stared, frozen. My hand hovered over the mouse, too terrified to touch it. This wasn't a glitch. This wasn't a smudge. This was… a transformation. And it was happening on my screen, in my file. 

Something was using my tools, my canvas, to manifest its own twisted vision.

My phone vibrated. It was the client. They were calling to see ""the progress.""

I looked at the image on my screen. The black vortex was deepening, swirling. And I saw it then. It wasn't just in the design. The shadows in my office were twisting, elongating. The lines of my desk, the edges of my keyboard, they seemed to be softening, bleeding into each other. The faint hum from my graphics tablet was no longer distant; it was a resonant thrum against my fingertips, vibrating through the whole room. My vision blurred for a moment, and I blinked rapidly, trying to clear it. But the blur remained. The room around me started to ripple, like a faulty render.

My own hand, resting on the mouse, looked… wrong. The skin seemed too smooth, too flat, like a poorly textured model. I tried to lift it, but it felt heavy, unresponsive. I stared at the screen, then at my hand, then back at the screen. The boundary between them was dissolving.

I could hear the phone vibrating again, insistently. But the sound was muffled, distant, as if coming from another dimension. My eyes were fixed on the screen, on the vortex. It wasn't just on the canvas anymore. It was in my head. And the cold, expanding emptiness that bled from the image… it was absorbing me.

I tried to scream, but my throat was tight, choked with static. My limbs became rigid, fixed, like polygons in a wireframe. I could feel the color draining from my skin, my features flattening. My vision shifted, becoming pixelated, then blurring into the dark, swirling chaos of the digital forest. I was no longer feeling like my…self.

And then, from deep within the swirling blackness of the vortex on the screen, a voice, not a sound, but a thought that echoed in my very bones, whispered,
""Welcome home.""

It's been hours since then. Or maybe days. Time feels… rendered. I don't know if I'm still sitting in my chair, or if I'm merely a memory of it, trapped somewhere within the code. My screen is blank now, but the humming hasn't stopped. It's inside me.

I keep trying to type, to explain. My fingers feel like they're merging with the keyboard. I think I'm still here, still me, but every shadow in the room seems to writhe, and the air itself feels like it's made of fractured pixels. I don't know what ""home"" that voice meant, but I'm terrified I'm already there.

1lv1hgg,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheCrypticCompendium/comments/1lv1hgg/the_weight_of_straw/,The Weight of Straw,"The storybook was old, the kind of yellow-paged paperback you'd find buried in a church rummage sale bin. The cover had been taped back on years ago, long before Silvia could read the title for herself. But she didn’t need to. She already knew how it ended.

I sat on the edge of her hospital bed, the one wedged into what used to be a playroom and now buzzed with machinery I still didn’t fully understand. The story rolled from my lips on autopilot.

“Then the Big Bad Wolf said, ‘Little pig, little pig, let me come in.’”

Silvia’s voice was paper thin. “Not by the hair of my chinny chin chin.”

I smiled and looked up from the book. Her eyes, watery and sunken but still bright with some kind of impossible strength, held mine. Her bald head caught the soft yellow glow of her bedside lamp, and a thin, clear tube ran from her IV pole into her arm, the only arm not buried in stuffed animals and a threadbare quilt Margaret had sewn when we found out we were having a girl.

Margaret. God, if she could see all this now.

The monitor to Silvia’s left gave its soft, rhythmic beep. A lullaby in reverse. Not calming. Just… constant.

I read through the rest of the story, each word falling heavier than the last. The pigs survived. The wolf didn’t win. Happy ending. Always.

I closed the book and brushed a wisp of invisible hair from Silvia’s forehead. Habit. She hadn’t had hair in over a year now.

“That was a good one,” she said softly.

“It’s always been your favorite.”

“I like the third pig,” she said. “He’s smart. He makes a house that doesn’t fall over.”

I nodded, trying to mask the lump in my throat. “Yeah. He’s the smartest of them all.”

Silvia yawned, then frowned. “Is Grandma Susan staying tonight?”

“She is.”

She looked away, lips puckering. “Why can’t *you* stay?”

I sighed and kissed her forehead, lingering there a moment longer than usual. “I’ve got to work, sweetheart.”

“You’re always working.”

Then came the cough. Deep, hacking, cruel. Her tiny hands clenched at the quilt. I reached for the suction tube, but it passed quickly. Just a cruel reminder.

I stroked her hand, smiling down at her with everything I could scrape together. “I’m trying really hard not to work *more*, baby.”

Her face softened. She turned away, snuggling deeper into the blanket. “Okay…”

I sat there for another minute, just watching her. The slight rise and fall of her chest. The beep… beep… beep… from the monitor. The pale light on her face. Her skin was translucent now, like her blood didn’t know where to hide.

My mom, Susan, would be in soon. She stayed over most nights now. I don’t know what I’d do without her. Probably lose my mind entirely.

I worked construction during the day, long, backbreaking hours in the cold Wisconsin wind. Then came the deliveries. GrubRunner, FoodHop, DineDash, whatever app was paying. I spent most evenings ferrying burgers and pad thai to apartment complexes that all looked the same.

The debt… it was like being buried under wet cement. Silvia’s treatment costs were nightmarish even *with* insurance. And everything else didn’t pause just because you were drowning. Mortgage. Groceries. Utilities. Gas. There were days I swore the air cost money too.

I slept in snatches. Lived in overdrive. Every moment I wasn’t working, I felt like I should be.

But right then, as I stood and tucked the quilt around Silvia’s legs, I let myself pretend things were normal.

“Goodnight, baby girl.”

“Night, Daddy.”

Her voice was barely louder than the monitor.

I turned off the lamp, and for a brief second, the darkness felt peaceful.

Then I opened the door and stepped out into the hall.

Back into the weight of straw.

The doorbell rang. I paused halfway down the hallway and turned back toward Silvia’s room. “That’s Grandma,” I said gently, poking my head in. “She’s here to keep you company.”

Silvia mumbled something sleepy in reply, eyes already fluttering closed.

I headed to the front door and opened it to find my mother, Susan, bundled against the chill with her overnight bag in one hand and a small stack of envelopes in the other.

“Evening,” she said softly, stepping inside and handing me the letters. “Got the mail for you.”

“Thanks, Ma,” I said, taking them from her.

She gave me a once-over and pursed her lips. “You look tired.”

“I am,” I said, holding up the stack. “And I don’t get to sleep much while these keep showing up.”

Her eyes lingered on the envelopes, face creasing with a mixture of concern and resignation. She gave my shoulder a gentle squeeze.

“I’ll go check on her,” she said.

I nodded, thumbing through the letters as she made her way upstairs. I could hear her soft footsteps creaking along the old hardwood as she headed to Silvia’s room.

Bills. Bills. Another bill. A grim parade of due dates and balances I couldn’t meet.

Then one envelope stood out.

It was cream-colored, thick, not the usual stark white of medical statements. In the upper-left corner, printed in silver ink, was a stylized logo: a darkened moon with a sliver of light just beginning to eclipse it.

**Eclipse Indemnity Corporation**.

Addressed to me.

I stared at the logo for a long moment. I’d never heard of the company before. It didn’t sound familiar, but the envelope didn’t look like junk mail either. I pushed the stack of bills aside and tore the flap open carefully.

Inside was a letter.

The opening lines made my stomach drop.

“We offer our sincerest condolences for the tragic loss of your home and beloved child, Silvia, in the recent house fire. Enclosed you will find the settlement documents related to claim #7745-A…”

I blinked, reading it again, sure I’d misunderstood. But the words were there, printed in elegant serif type. The death of my child. The destruction of my house. A fire that had never happened.

My heart beat faster. My lips curled in a grimace. What kind of sick scam was this?

Then my eyes landed on the settlement amount.

Three hundred thousand dollars for the wrongful death of Silvia.

Five hundred thousand for the destruction of the house.

A check slid out from between the folds of the letter, perfectly printed and crisp, made out in my name. **$800,000**.

My hand trembled as I held it. The paper felt real. The signature, the watermark, the routing information, all of it looked legitimate.

It wouldn’t last forever. Not even close. But maybe… maybe I could stop delivering food until two in the morning. Maybe I could finish my degree. Get a better job. With benefits. Maybe I could be home more. Take Silvia to her appointments. Actually be there.

My mind ran wild with possibilities, wheels spinning on a road that hadn’t existed five minutes ago.

“Frank?”

I jolted.

Susan stood in the kitchen doorway, holding up a bag of lemons. “I brought some fresh ones. Mind if I make lemonade?”

I blinked at her. “Uh… yeah. Sure. That’s fine.”

She smiled and turned toward the counter.

“What’s that you’re holding?” she asked casually.

“Oh, nothing,” I said quickly. “Just one of those fake checks they send out. You know, to get you to trade in your car or refinance or something.”

I folded the letter and the check in one motion and slid them into my back pocket.

Susan gave me a look, but didn’t press. She turned to the sink, humming softly as she washed the lemons.

I stood there, staring at nothing, my mind still on the number.

Eight hundred thousand dollars.

For a life that hadn’t been lost.

Susan nodded from the sink, her voice drifting back to me. “She’s already drifting off. That medication makes her so sleepy, poor thing. But I’m going to make a pitcher of lemonade for when she wakes up tomorrow. Let it chill overnight.”

I nodded absently. “She’ll love that.”

I stepped forward and gave my mom a hug. “Thanks again, Ma.”

She held on tight for a moment. “Be safe tonight.”

I left quietly, climbing into the truck parked in the driveway. Once inside, I pulled out the check again and stared at it under the dome light.

It had to be a scam. I didn’t have insurance through any Eclipse Indemnity Corporation. Hell, I didn’t have homeowners insurance. I didn’t have life insurance, for myself or for Silvia.

I thought about tearing it in half. Raising it to the edge of the steering wheel, pressing it just enough to crease.

But I couldn’t. I couldn’t bring myself to do it.

So I drove. House to house. Door to door. Smelling like fries and grease by the time the clock crawled toward three a.m. My hands still checked my pocket between orders, feeling the folded slip of paper there. The weight of what it promised. The sick feeling of what it implied.

By the time I turned back onto my street, I’d made a decision.

I’d go to the bank first thing in the morning.

See if the check was even real.

The bank opened at eight. I was waiting in the parking lot at seven forty-five, holding a paper cup of gas station coffee that I hadn’t touched. I stepped in as the doors unlocked and made my way to the counter.

The teller was a young woman with kind eyes and a tired smile. I handed over the check without ceremony.

Her smile faltered as her eyes scanned the numbers.

She looked up at me. “I’m going to need to check with my manager on this. One moment.”

She disappeared into the back, check in hand.

Minutes passed. My legs started to ache. My mind spiraled.

Of course it was fake. I’d just handed some poor teller a piece of garbage. Probably thought I was a scammer.

Then she returned. Smiling again. A little more carefully.

“It cleared,” she said. “The funds have been deposited. You’ll see them in your account shortly.”

She handed me a printed receipt. It showed the balance. All of it.

I stared at the paper.

Eight hundred thousand dollars.

I swallowed hard. “Thanks,” I said softly.

And then I walked out into the morning light, my head spinning with possibilities I didn’t know how to believe in yet.

I climbed back into my truck and immediately pulled out my phone. My fingers trembled slightly as I opened the banking app. Sure enough, the check had cleared. Eight hundred thousand dollars sat in my account like a cinder block.

I stared at it in disbelief. Then, without meaning to, I slammed my fist against the roof of the cab and let out a sharp, guttural yell. Not joy. Not anger. Something heavier. A release of pressure I hadn’t even realized had been building.

I called in sick. Said I had a fever, maybe food poisoning. Didn’t wait for a reply. I just started the engine and headed home.

When I pulled up to the house, a strange sound hit me, sharp and shrill, echoing through the front windows.

The fire alarm.

I threw the truck into park and ran to the front door, flinging it open with my heart already pounding.

Smoke wafted through the air from the kitchen. Not heavy, but thick enough to haze the room. Grandma Susan stood at the stove, waving a dish towel furiously at the ceiling. The toaster oven was smoking lightly, a blackened pastry visible through the glass.

“Sorry!” she called over the blaring alarm. “I thought five minutes would be okay. I just wanted to crisp them up a little.”

I rushed over and helped her wave the smoke away. The alarm, finally detecting clear air, chirped twice and went silent.

From upstairs came Silvia’s voice, frail and frightened. “Daddy? What’s happening?”

Susan looked over at me. “Why are you home so early?”

“Site’s missing materials,” I said quickly. “They sent us home.”

It was a lie. A clean, easy one. I didn’t have the energy to explain the truth.

“I’ll go up with you,” she said gently.

We climbed the stairs together and found Silvia sitting upright in bed, clutching her stuffed lamb.

“Hey,” I said, crossing the room and kneeling beside her. “Just a silly mistake downstairs. Grandma left the toaster on too long.”

Silvia’s eyes were wide, rimmed with worry. “Was it a fire?”

“Nothing like that,” I said, pulling her into a tight hug. The kind of hug only a dad could give when he thought he’d almost lost everything. “Just a burnt breakfast. That’s all.”

She nodded against my chest. “Okay.”

Then she pulled back, smiling sleepily. “I’m glad you’re home.”

I kissed her forehead. “Me too, sweetheart. Me too.”

I turned to Susan, who had stayed quietly in the doorway. “I think I’m going to take the day,” I said. “Catch up on bills, maybe just… be here for a while.”

Susan smiled, her face softening with that motherly warmth. “That sounds like a wonderful idea. You could use the rest.”

She went back downstairs and poured two glasses of lemonade, one for me, one for Silvia, before packing up her things. Before she left, she hugged us both tightly.

I set up my laptop on a folding tray in Silvia’s room while she flipped on her favorite cartoons. While she watched, giggling at some slapstick moment on screen, I quietly pulled up account after account and began chipping away at the mountain.

Electric. Phone. Credit cards. Medical bills. I paid them off in full, one after another. Each click lifted a weight off my chest, but with every cleared balance came a strange, crawling unease.

I kissed her forehead again, heart squeezing. “One day, I promise. We’ll be out there.”

She nodded seriously, folding the drawing and tucking it beside her bed. “I’m glad you’re home today. I miss you when you’re gone.”

I swallowed. “I miss you too, sweetheart. But you know what? I might not need to work as much anymore.”

Her eyes lit up. “Really?”

I nodded. “Really.”

She threw her arms around me and squealed. “Yay!”

While she napped, I applied for the next semester at the local university. Just two semesters shy of finishing my degree. Tuition paid in full. It felt surreal, like planting roots after drifting too long.

I sat there for another minute, just watching her. The slight rise and fall of her chest. The beep… beep… beep… from the monitor. The pale light on her face. Her skin was translucent now, like her blood didn’t know where to hide.

My mom, Susan, would be in soon. She stayed over most nights now. I don’t know what I’d do without her. Probably lose my mind entirely.

I worked construction during the day, long, backbreaking hours in the cold Wisconsin wind. Then came the deliveries. GrubRunner, FoodHop, DineDash, whatever app was paying. I spent most evenings ferrying burgers and pad thai to apartment complexes that all looked the same.

The debt… it was like being buried under wet cement. Silvia’s treatment costs were nightmarish even *with* insurance. And everything else didn’t pause just because you were drowning. Mortgage. Groceries. Utilities. Gas. There were days I swore the air cost money too.

I slept in snatches. Lived in overdrive. Every moment I wasn’t working, I felt like I should be.

But right then, as I stood and tucked the quilt around Silvia’s legs, I let myself pretend things were normal.

“Goodnight, baby girl.”

“Night, Daddy.”

Her voice was barely louder than the monitor.

I turned off the lamp, and for a brief second, the darkness felt peaceful.

Then I opened the door and stepped out into the hall.

Back into the weight of straw.

The doorbell rang. I paused halfway down the hallway and turned back toward Silvia’s room. “That’s Grandma,” I said gently, poking my head in. “She’s here to keep you company.”

Silvia mumbled something sleepy in reply, eyes already fluttering closed.

I headed to the front door and opened it to find my mother, Susan, bundled against the chill with her overnight bag in one hand and a small stack of envelopes in the other.

“Evening,” she said softly, stepping inside and handing me the letters. “Got the mail for you.”

“Thanks, Ma,” I said, taking them from her.

She gave me a once-over and pursed her lips. “You look tired.”

“I am,” I said, holding up the stack. “And I don’t get to sleep much while these keep showing up.”

Her eyes lingered on the envelopes, face creasing with a mixture of concern and resignation. She gave my shoulder a gentle squeeze.

“I’ll go check on her,” she said.

I nodded, thumbing through the letters as she made her way upstairs. I could hear her soft footsteps creaking along the old hardwood as she headed to Silvia’s room.

Bills. Bills. Another bill. A grim parade of due dates and balances I couldn’t meet.

Then one envelope stood out.

It was cream-colored, thick, not the usual stark white of medical statements. In the upper-left corner, printed in silver ink, was a stylized logo: a darkened moon with a sliver of light just beginning to eclipse it.

**Eclipse Indemnity Corporation**.

Addressed to me.

I stared at the logo for a long moment. I’d never heard of the company before. It didn’t sound familiar, but the envelope didn’t look like junk mail either. I pushed the stack of bills aside and tore the flap open carefully.

Inside was a letter.

The opening lines made my stomach drop.

“We offer our sincerest condolences for the tragic loss of your home and beloved child, Silvia, in the recent house fire. Enclosed you will find the settlement documents related to claim #7745-A…”

I blinked, reading it again, sure I’d misunderstood. But the words were there, printed in elegant serif type. The death of my child. The destruction of my house. A fire that had never happened.

My heart beat faster. My lips curled in a grimace. What kind of sick scam was this?

Then my eyes landed on the settlement amount.

Three hundred thousand dollars for the wrongful death of Silvia.

Five hundred thousand for the destruction of the house.

A check slid out from between the folds of the letter, perfectly printed and crisp, made out in my name. **$800,000**.

My hand trembled as I held it. The paper felt real. The signature, the watermark, the routing information, all of it looked legitimate.

It wouldn’t last forever. Not even close. But maybe… maybe I could stop delivering food until two in the morning. Maybe I could finish my degree. Get a better job. With benefits. Maybe I could be home more. Take Silvia to her appointments. Actually be there.

My mind ran wild with possibilities, wheels spinning on a road that hadn’t existed five minutes ago.

“Frank?”

I jolted.

Susan stood in the kitchen doorway, holding up a bag of lemons. “I brought some fresh ones. Mind if I make lemonade?”

I blinked at her. “Uh… yeah. Sure. That’s fine.”

She smiled and turned toward the counter.

“What’s that you’re holding?” she asked casually.

“Oh, nothing,” I said quickly. “Just one of those fake checks they send out. You know, to get you to trade in your car or refinance or something.”

I folded the letter and the check in one motion and slid them into my back pocket.

Susan gave me a look, but didn’t press. She turned to the sink, humming softly as she washed the lemons.

I stood there, staring at nothing, my mind still on the number.

Eight hundred thousand dollars.

For a life that hadn’t been lost.

Susan nodded from the sink, her voice drifting back to me. “She’s already drifting off. That medication makes her so sleepy, poor thing. But I’m going to make a pitcher of lemonade for when she wakes up tomorrow. Let it chill overnight.”

I nodded absently. “She’ll love that.”

I stepped forward and gave my mom a hug. “Thanks again, Ma.”

She held on tight for a moment. “Be safe tonight.”

I left quietly, climbing into the truck parked in the driveway. Once inside, I pulled out the check again and stared at it under the dome light.

It had to be a scam. I didn’t have insurance through any Eclipse Indemnity Corporation. Hell, I didn’t have homeowners insurance. I didn’t have life insurance, for myself or for Silvia.

I thought about tearing it in half. Raising it to the edge of the steering wheel, pressing it just enough to crease.

But I couldn’t. I couldn’t bring myself to do it.

So I drove. House to house. Door to door. Smelling like fries and grease by the time the clock crawled toward three a.m. My hands still checked my pocket between orders, feeling the folded slip of paper there. The weight of what it promised. The sick feeling of what it implied.

By the time I turned back onto my street, I’d made a decision.

I’d go to the bank first thing in the morning.

See if the check was even real.

The bank opened at eight. I was waiting in the parking lot at seven forty-five, holding a paper cup of gas station coffee that I hadn’t touched. I stepped in as the doors unlocked and made my way to the counter.

The teller was a young woman with kind eyes and a tired smile. I handed over the check without ceremony.

Her smile faltered as her eyes scanned the numbers.

She looked up at me. “I’m going to need to check with my manager on this. One moment.”

She disappeared into the back, check in hand.

Minutes passed. My legs started to ache. My mind spiraled.

Of course it was fake. I’d just handed some poor teller a piece of garbage. Probably thought I was a scammer.

Then she returned. Smiling again. A little more carefully.

“It cleared,” she said. “The funds have been deposited. You’ll see them in your account shortly.”

She handed me a printed receipt. It showed the balance. All of it.

I stared at the paper.

Eight hundred thousand dollars.

I swallowed hard. “Thanks,” I said softly.

And then I walked out into the morning light, my head spinning with possibilities I didn’t know how to believe in yet.

I climbed back into my truck and immediately pulled out my phone. My fingers trembled slightly as I opened the banking app. Sure enough, the check had cleared. Eight hundred thousand dollars sat in my account like a cinder block.

I stared at it in disbelief. Then, without meaning to, I slammed my fist against the roof of the cab and let out a sharp, guttural yell. Not joy. Not anger. Something heavier. A release of pressure I hadn’t even realized had been building.

I called in sick. Said I had a fever, maybe food poisoning. Didn’t wait for a reply. I just started the engine and headed home.

When I pulled up to the house, a strange sound hit me, sharp and shrill, echoing through the front windows.

The fire alarm.

I threw the truck into park and ran to the front door, flinging it open with my heart already pounding.

Smoke wafted through the air from the kitchen. Not heavy, but thick enough to haze the room. Grandma Susan stood at the stove, waving a dish towel furiously at the ceiling. The toaster oven was smoking lightly, a blackened pastry visible through the glass.

“Sorry!” she called over the blaring alarm. “I thought five minutes would be okay. I just wanted to crisp them up a little.”

I rushed over and helped her wave the smoke away. The alarm, finally detecting clear air, chirped twice and went silent.

From upstairs came Silvia’s voice, frail and frightened. “Daddy? What’s happening?”

Susan looked over at me. “Why are you home so early?”

“Site’s missing materials,” I said quickly. “They sent us home.”

It was a lie. A clean, easy one. I didn’t have the energy to explain the truth.

“I’ll go up with you,” she said gently.

We climbed the stairs together and found Silvia sitting upright in bed, clutching her stuffed lamb.

“Hey,” I said, crossing the room and kneeling beside her. “Just a silly mistake downstairs. Grandma left the toaster on too long.”

Silvia’s eyes were wide, rimmed with worry. “Was it a fire?”

“Nothing like that,” I said, pulling her into a tight hug. The kind of hug only a dad could give when he thought he’d almost lost everything. “Just a burnt breakfast. That’s all.”

She nodded against my chest. “Okay.”

Then she pulled back, smiling sleepily. “I’m glad you’re home.”

I kissed her forehead. “Me too, sweetheart. Me too.”

I turned to Susan, who had stayed quietly in the doorway. “I think I’m going to take the day,” I said. “Catch up on bills, maybe just… be here for a while.”

Susan smiled, her face softening with that motherly warmth. “That sounds like a wonderful idea. You could use the rest.”

She went back downstairs and poured two glasses of lemonade, one for me, one for Silvia, before packing up her things. Before she left, she hugged us both tightly.

I set up my laptop on a folding tray in Silvia’s room while she flipped on her favorite cartoons. While she watched, giggling at some slapstick moment on screen, I quietly pulled up account after account and began chipping away at the mountain.

Electric. Phone. Credit cards. Medical bills. I paid them off in full, one after another. Each click lifted a weight off my chest, but with every cleared balance came a strange, crawling unease.

That fire downstairs… was it really just an accident?

Or had it started because I cashed that check?

I tried to shake the thought, but it lingered like smoke behind the eyes.

Silvia seemed more alert than usual. Her medication hadn’t kicked in yet, and she was drawing something on the tray next to her bed with thick crayons. When she finished, she held it up with both hands, beaming.

It was a picture of her and me, she had long, wavy hair, and I was wearing a bright yellow hard hat. We were holding hands in the backyard under a blue sky.

“I wanna do that again someday,” she said. “Be outside. Without all the wires.”

I kissed her forehead again, heart squeezing. “One day, I promise. We’ll be out there.”

She nodded seriously, folding the drawing and tucking it beside her bed. “I’m glad you’re home today. I miss you when you’re gone.”

I swallowed. “I miss you too, sweetheart. But you know what? I might not need to work as much anymore.”

Her eyes lit up. “Really?”

I nodded. “Really.”

She threw her arms around me and squealed. “Yay!”

While she napped, I applied for the next semester at the local university. Just two semesters shy of finishing my degree. Tuition paid in full. It felt surreal, like planting roots after drifting too long.

That night, I let Silvia pick dinner. She pointed to a local pizza place she’d only seen once, the kind that did gourmet pies and only allowed pickups. She just wanted a plain cheese pizza, of course.

I ordered it. For once, I wasn’t the one delivering someone else’s dinner, I was ordering my own to be delivered. It felt strangely empowering, like I’d crossed some invisible threshold. Expensive, sure, but tonight felt like a moment worth marking.

We ate on paper plates in bed, the glow of cartoons still dancing on the screen. Silvia barely made it through two slices before her eyelids started to flutter. Her medication pulled her under in gentle waves.

I kissed her goodnight and pulled the blanket over her chest.

She was already asleep.

I stepped into my room, lay down on the bed, and stared at the ceiling.

For the first time in what felt like forever, my muscles relaxed.

Sleep came quickly.

But it didn’t last.

The fire alarm blared.

I jolted upright, my heart thundering in my chest. Then I heard it, Silvia’s scream. High-pitched and full of terror, coming from her room.

I was out of bed and sprinting down the hall before I even registered moving. Smoke curled out from beneath her door. I grabbed the handle, already hot to the touch, and threw the door open.

“Silvia!” I screamed.

A wall of heat hit me like a truck. The moment the door opened, the backdraft exploded. Fire burst outward, roaring like a beast unleashed. The flames swallowed my daughter’s screams, turning them into echoes of agony.

The blast knocked me off my feet, slamming my head hard against the wall. Then, nothing.

When I opened my eyes again, I was on my back in an ambulance. The ceiling lights flickered overhead. Oxygen tubes. The scent of burned plastic and char. The wailing sound wasn’t a siren, it was Susan.

I tried to sit up, but a paramedic pressed me down gently. “You’ve got to stay still, sir. You’ve been burned pretty badly.”

I winced, groaning, pain flaring along my arms and neck. My skin felt tight and seared.

“Where’s Silvia?” I gasped. “Where is she?!”

Another paramedic, older, his eyes grim, stepped over.

I turned my head, trying to see past the doors. The house was just bones now, a skeleton charred black against the early morning sky.

“I’m sorry,” the paramedic said quietly. “We couldn’t get to her in time. The firemen think it started in her room. Electrical short from the medical equipment. There was nothing anyone could do.”

The words didn’t register. Couldn’t.

I screamed. Cursed. Fought against the straps holding me down until the pain overwhelmed me.

I should never have cashed that check.

None of this should have happened.

The storybook was old, the kind of yellow-paged paperback you'd find buried in a church rummage sale bin. The cover had been taped back on years ago, long before Silvia could read the title for herself. But she didn’t need to. She already knew how it ended.

I sat on the edge of her hospital bed, the one wedged into what used to be a playroom and now buzzed with machinery I still didn’t fully understand. The story rolled from my lips on autopilot.

“Then the Big Bad Wolf said, ‘Little pig, little pig, let me come in.’”

Silvia’s voice was paper thin. “Not by the hair of my chinny chin chin.”

I smiled and looked up from the book. Her eyes, watery and sunken but still bright with some kind of impossible strength, held mine. Her bald head caught the soft yellow glow of her bedside lamp, and a thin, clear tube ran from her IV pole into her arm, the only arm not buried in stuffed animals and a threadbare quilt Margaret had sewn when we found out we were having a girl.

Margaret. God, if she could see all this now.

The monitor to Silvia’s left gave its soft, rhythmic beep. A lullaby in reverse. Not calming. Just… constant.

I read through the rest of the story, each word falling heavier than the last. The pigs survived. The wolf didn’t win. Happy ending. Always.

I closed the book and brushed a wisp of invisible hair from Silvia’s forehead. Habit. She hadn’t had hair in over a year now.

“That was a good one,” she said softly.

“It’s always been your favorite.”

“I like the third pig,” she said. “He’s smart. He makes a house that doesn’t fall over.”

I nodded, trying to mask the lump in my throat. “Yeah. He’s the smartest of them all.”

Silvia yawned, then frowned. “Is Grandma Susan staying tonight?”

“She is.”

She looked away, lips puckering. “Why can’t *you* stay?”

I sighed and kissed her forehead, lingering there a moment longer than usual. “I’ve got to work, sweetheart.”

“You’re always working.”

Then came the cough. Deep, hacking, cruel. Her tiny hands clenched at the quilt. I reached for the suction tube, but it passed quickly. Just a cruel reminder.

I stroked her hand, smiling down at her with everything I could scrape together. “I’m trying really hard not to work *more*, baby.”

Her face softened. She turned away, snuggling deeper into the blanket. “Okay…”

I sat there for another minute, just watching her. The slight rise and fall of her chest. The beep… beep… beep… from the monitor. The pale light on her face. Her skin was translucent now, like her blood didn’t know where to hide.

My mom, Susan, would be in soon. She stayed over most nights now. I don’t know what I’d do without her. Probably lose my mind entirely.

I worked construction during the day, long, backbreaking hours in the cold Wisconsin wind. Then came the deliveries. GrubRunner, FoodHop, DineDash, whatever app was paying. I spent most evenings ferrying burgers and pad thai to apartment complexes that all looked the same.

The debt… it was like being buried under wet cement. Silvia’s treatment costs were nightmarish even *with* insurance. And everything else didn’t pause just because you were drowning. Mortgage. Groceries. Utilities. Gas. There were days I swore the air cost money too.

I slept in snatches. Lived in overdrive. Every moment I wasn’t working, I felt like I should be.

But right then, as I stood and tucked the quilt around Silvia’s legs, I let myself pretend things were normal.

“Goodnight, baby girl.”

“Night, Daddy.”

“I’ll go check on her,” she said.

Eight hundred thousand dollars.

The storybook was old, the kind of yellow-paged paperback you'd find buried in a church rummage sale bin. The cover had been taped back on years ago, long before Silvia could read the title for herself. But she didn’t need to. She already knew how it ended.

I sat on the edge of her hospital bed, the one wedged into what used to be a playroom and now buzzed with machinery I still didn’t fully understand. The story rolled from my lips on autopilot.

“Then the Big Bad Wolf said, ‘Little pig, little pig, let me come in.’”

Silvia’s voice was paper thin. “Not by the hair of my chinny chin chin.”

I smiled and looked up from the book. Her eyes, watery and sunken but still bright with some kind of impossible strength, held mine. Her bald head caught the soft yellow glow of her bedside lamp, and a thin, clear tube ran from her IV pole into her arm, the only arm not buried in stuffed animals and a threadbare quilt Margaret had sewn when we found out we were having a girl.

Margaret. God, if she could see all this now.

The monitor to Silvia’s left gave its soft, rhythmic beep. A lullaby in reverse. Not calming. Just… constant.

I read through the rest of the story, each word falling heavier than the last. The pigs survived. The wolf didn’t win. Happy ending. Always.

I closed the book and brushed a wisp of invisible hair from Silvia’s forehead. Habit. She hadn’t had hair in over a year now.

“That was a good one,” she said softly.

“It’s always been your favorite.”

“I like the third pig,” she said. “He’s smart. He makes a house that doesn’t fall over.”

I nodded, trying to mask the lump in my throat. “Yeah. He’s the smartest of them all.”

Silvia yawned, then frowned. “Is Grandma Susan staying tonight?”

“She is.”

She looked away, lips puckering. “Why can’t *you* stay?”

I sighed and kissed her forehead, lingering there a moment longer than usual. “I’ve got to work, sweetheart.”

“You’re always working.”

Then came the cough. Deep, hacking, cruel. Her tiny hands clenched at the quilt. I reached for the suction tube, but it passed quickly. Just a cruel reminder.

I stroked her hand, smiling down at her with everything I could scrape together. “I’m trying really hard not to work *more*, baby.”

Her face softened. She turned away, snuggling deeper into the blanket. “Okay…”

I sat there for another minute, just watching her. The slight rise and fall of her chest. The beep… beep… beep… from the monitor. The pale light on her face. Her skin was translucent now, like her blood didn’t know where to hide.

My mom, Susan, would be in soon. She stayed over most nights now. I don’t know what I’d do without her. Probably lose my mind entirely.

I worked construction during the day, long, backbreaking hours in the cold Wisconsin wind. Then came the deliveries. GrubRunner, FoodHop, DineDash, whatever app was paying. I spent most evenings ferrying burgers and pad thai to apartment complexes that all looked the same.

The debt… it was like being buried under wet cement. Silvia’s treatment costs were nightmarish even *with* insurance. And everything else didn’t pause just because you were drowning. Mortgage. Groceries. Utilities. Gas. There were days I swore the air cost money too.

I slept in snatches. Lived in overdrive. Every moment I wasn’t working, I felt like I should be.

But right then, as I stood and tucked the quilt around Silvia’s legs, I let myself pretend things were normal.

“Goodnight, baby girl.”

“Night, Daddy.”

Her voice was barely louder than the monitor.

I turned off the lamp, and for a brief second, the darkness felt peaceful.

Then I opened the door and stepped out into the hall.

Back into the weight of straw.

The doorbell rang. I paused halfway down the hallway and turned back toward Silvia’s room. “That’s Grandma,” I said gently, poking my head in. “She’s here to keep you company.”

Silvia mumbled something sleepy in reply, eyes already fluttering closed.

I headed to the front door and opened it to find my mother, Susan, bundled against the chill with her overnight bag in one hand and a small stack of envelopes in the other.

“Evening,” she said softly, stepping inside and handing me the letters. “Got the mail for you.”

“Thanks, Ma,” I said, taking them from her.

She gave me a once-over and pursed her lips. “You look tired.”

“I am,” I said, holding up the stack. “And I don’t get to sleep much while these keep showing up.”

Her eyes lingered on the envelopes, face creasing with a mixture of concern and resignation. She gave my shoulder a gentle squeeze.

“I’ll go check on her,” she said.

I nodded, thumbing through the letters as she made her way upstairs. I could hear her soft footsteps creaking along the old hardwood as she headed to Silvia’s room.

Bills. Bills. Another bill. A grim parade of due dates and balances I couldn’t meet.

Then one envelope stood out.

It was cream-colored, thick, not the usual stark white of medical statements. In the upper-left corner, printed in silver ink, was a stylized logo: a darkened moon with a sliver of light just beginning to eclipse it.

**Eclipse Indemnity Corporation**.

Addressed to me.

I stared at the logo for a long moment. I’d never heard of the company before. It didn’t sound familiar, but the envelope didn’t look like junk mail either. I pushed the stack of bills aside and tore the flap open carefully.

Inside was a letter.

The opening lines made my stomach drop.

“We offer our sincerest condolences for the tragic loss of your home and beloved child, Silvia, in the recent house fire. Enclosed you will find the settlement documents related to claim #7745-A…”

I blinked, reading it again, sure I’d misunderstood. But the words were there, printed in elegant serif type. The death of my child. The destruction of my house. A fire that had never happened.

My heart beat faster. My lips curled in a grimace. What kind of sick scam was this?

Then my eyes landed on the settlement amount.

Three hundred thousand dollars for the wrongful death of Silvia.

Five hundred thousand for the destruction of the house.

A check slid out from between the folds of the letter, perfectly printed and crisp, made out in my name. **$800,000**.

My hand trembled as I held it. The paper felt real. The signature, the watermark, the routing information, all of it looked legitimate.

It wouldn’t last forever. Not even close. But maybe… maybe I could stop delivering food until two in the morning. Maybe I could finish my degree. Get a better job. With benefits. Maybe I could be home more. Take Silvia to her appointments. Actually be there.

My mind ran wild with possibilities, wheels spinning on a road that hadn’t existed five minutes ago.

“Frank?”

I jolted.

Susan stood in the kitchen doorway, holding up a bag of lemons. “I brought some fresh ones. Mind if I make lemonade?”

I blinked at her. “Uh… yeah. Sure. That’s fine.”

She smiled and turned toward the counter.

“What’s that you’re holding?” she asked casually.

“Oh, nothing,” I said quickly. “Just one of those fake checks they send out. You know, to get you to trade in your car or refinance or something.”

I folded the letter and the check in one motion and slid them into my back pocket.

Susan gave me a look, but didn’t press. She turned to the sink, humming softly as she washed the lemons.

I stood there, staring at nothing, my mind still on the number.

Eight hundred thousand dollars.

For a life that hadn’t been lost.

Susan nodded from the sink, her voice drifting back to me. “She’s already drifting off. That medication makes her so sleepy, poor thing. But I’m going to make a pitcher of lemonade for when she wakes up tomorrow. Let it chill overnight.”

I nodded absently. “She’ll love that.”

I stepped forward and gave my mom a hug. “Thanks again, Ma.”

She held on tight for a moment. “Be safe tonight.”

I left quietly, climbing into the truck parked in the driveway. Once inside, I pulled out the check again and stared at it under the dome light.

It had to be a scam. I didn’t have insurance through any Eclipse Indemnity Corporation. Hell, I didn’t have homeowners insurance. I didn’t have life insurance, for myself or for Silvia.

I thought about tearing it in half. Raising it to the edge of the steering wheel, pressing it just enough to crease.

But I couldn’t. I couldn’t bring myself to do it.

So I drove. House to house. Door to door. Smelling like fries and grease by the time the clock crawled toward three a.m. My hands still checked my pocket between orders, feeling the folded slip of paper there. The weight of what it promised. The sick feeling of what it implied.

By the time I turned back onto my street, I’d made a decision.

I’d go to the bank first thing in the morning.

See if the check was even real.

The bank opened at eight. I was waiting in the parking lot at seven forty-five, holding a paper cup of gas station coffee that I hadn’t touched. I stepped in as the doors unlocked and made my way to the counter.

The teller was a young woman with kind eyes and a tired smile. I handed over the check without ceremony.

Her smile faltered as her eyes scanned the numbers.

She looked up at me. “I’m going to need to check with my manager on this. One moment.”

She disappeared into the back, check in hand.

Minutes passed. My legs started to ache. My mind spiraled.

Of course it was fake. I’d just handed some poor teller a piece of garbage. Probably thought I was a scammer.

Then she returned. Smiling again. A little more carefully.

“It cleared,” she said. “The funds have been deposited. You’ll see them in your account shortly.”

She handed me a printed receipt. It showed the balance. All of it.

I stared at the paper.

Eight hundred thousand dollars.

I swallowed hard. “Thanks,” I said softly.

And then I walked out into the morning light, my head spinning with possibilities I didn’t know how to believe in yet.

I climbed back into my truck and immediately pulled out my phone. My fingers trembled slightly as I opened the banking app. Sure enough, the check had cleared. Eight hundred thousand dollars sat in my account like a cinder block.

I stared at it in disbelief. Then, without meaning to, I slammed my fist against the roof of the cab and let out a sharp, guttural yell. Not joy. Not anger. Something heavier. A release of pressure I hadn’t even realized had been building.

I called in sick. Said I had a fever, maybe food poisoning. Didn’t wait for a reply. I just started the engine and headed home.

When I pulled up to the house, a strange sound hit me, sharp and shrill, echoing through the front windows.

The fire alarm.

I threw the truck into park and ran to the front door, flinging it open with my heart already pounding.

Smoke wafted through the air from the kitchen. Not heavy, but thick enough to haze the room. Grandma Susan stood at the stove, waving a dish towel furiously at the ceiling. The toaster oven was smoking lightly, a blackened pastry visible through the glass.

“Sorry!” she called over the blaring alarm. “I thought five minutes would be okay. I just wanted to crisp them up a little.”

I rushed over and helped her wave the smoke away. The alarm, finally detecting clear air, chirped twice and went silent.

From upstairs came Silvia’s voice, frail and frightened. “Daddy? What’s happening?”

Susan looked over at me. “Why are you home so early?”

“Site’s missing materials,” I said quickly. “They sent us home.”

It was a lie. A clean, easy one. I didn’t have the energy to explain the truth.

“I’ll go up with you,” she said gently.

We climbed the stairs together and found Silvia sitting upright in bed, clutching her stuffed lamb.

“Hey,” I said, crossing the room and kneeling beside her. “Just a silly mistake downstairs. Grandma left the toaster on too long.”

Silvia’s eyes were wide, rimmed with worry. “Was it a fire?”

“Nothing like that,” I said, pulling her into a tight hug. The kind of hug only a dad could give when he thought he’d almost lost everything. “Just a burnt breakfast. That’s all.”

She nodded against my chest. “Okay.”

Then she pulled back, smiling sleepily. “I’m glad you’re home.”

I kissed her forehead. “Me too, sweetheart. Me too.”

I turned to Susan, who had stayed quietly in the doorway. “I think I’m going to take the day,” I said. “Catch up on bills, maybe just… be here for a while.”

Susan smiled, her face softening with that motherly warmth. “That sounds like a wonderful idea. You could use the rest.”

She went back downstairs and poured two glasses of lemonade, one for me, one for Silvia, before packing up her things. Before she left, she hugged us both tightly.

I set up my laptop on a folding tray in Silvia’s room while she flipped on her favorite cartoons. While she watched, giggling at some slapstick moment on screen, I quietly pulled up account after account and began chipping away at the mountain.

Electric. Phone. Credit cards. Medical bills. I paid them off in full, one after another. Each click lifted a weight off my chest, but with every cleared balance came a strange, crawling unease.

That fire downstairs… was it really just an accident?

Or had it started because I cashed that check?

I tried to shake the thought, but it lingered like smoke behind the eyes.

Silvia seemed more alert than usual. Her medication hadn’t kicked in yet, and she was drawing something on the tray next to her bed with thick crayons. When she finished, she held it up with both hands, beaming.

It was a picture of her and me, she had long, wavy hair, and I was wearing a bright yellow hard hat. We were holding hands in the backyard under a blue sky.

“I wanna do that again someday,” she said. “Be outside. Without all the wires.”

I kissed her forehead again, heart squeezing. “One day, I promise. We’ll be out there.”

She nodded seriously, folding the drawing and tucking it beside her bed. “I’m glad you’re home today. I miss you when you’re gone.”

I swallowed. “I miss you too, sweetheart. But you know what? I might not need to work as much anymore.”

Her eyes lit up. “Really?”

I nodded. “Really.”

She threw her arms around me and squealed. “Yay!”

While she napped, I applied for the next semester at the local university. Just two semesters shy of finishing my degree. Tuition paid in full. It felt surreal, like planting roots after drifting too long.

That night, I let Silvia pick dinner. She pointed to a local pizza place she’d only seen once, the kind that did gourmet pies and only allowed pickups. She just wanted a plain cheese pizza, of course.

I ordered it. For once, I wasn’t the one delivering someone else’s dinner, I was ordering my own to be delivered. It felt strangely empowering, like I’d crossed some invisible threshold. Expensive, sure, but tonight felt like a moment worth marking.

We ate on paper plates in bed, the glow of cartoons still dancing on the screen. Silvia barely made it through two slices before her eyelids started to flutter. Her medication pulled her under in gentle waves.

I kissed her goodnight and pulled the blanket over her chest.

She was already asleep.

I stepped into my room, lay down on the bed, and stared at the ceiling.

For the first time in what felt like forever, my muscles relaxed.

Sleep came quickly.

But it didn’t last.

The fire alarm blared.

I jolted upright, my heart thundering in my chest. Then I heard it, Silvia’s scream. High-pitched and full of terror, coming from her room.

I was out of bed and sprinting down the hall before I even registered moving. Smoke curled out from beneath her door. I grabbed the handle, already hot to the touch, and threw the door open.

“Silvia!” I screamed.

A wall of heat hit me like a truck. The moment the door opened, the backdraft exploded. Fire burst outward, roaring like a beast unleashed. The flames swallowed my daughter’s screams, turning them into echoes of agony.

The blast knocked me off my feet, slamming my head hard against the wall. Then, nothing.

When I opened my eyes again, I was on my back in an ambulance. The ceiling lights flickered overhead. Oxygen tubes. The scent of burned plastic and char. The wailing sound wasn’t a siren, it was Susan.

I tried to sit up, but a paramedic pressed me down gently. “You’ve got to stay still, sir. You’ve been burned pretty badly.”

I winced, groaning, pain flaring along my arms and neck. My skin felt tight and seared.

“Where’s Silvia?” I gasped. “Where is she?!”

Another paramedic, older, his eyes grim, stepped over.

I turned my head, trying to see past the doors. The house was just bones now, a skeleton charred black against the early morning sky.

“I’m sorry,” the paramedic said quietly. “We couldn’t get to her in time. The firemen think it started in her room. Electrical short from the medical equipment. There was nothing anyone could do.”

The words didn’t register. Couldn’t.

I screamed. Cursed. Fought against the straps holding me down until the pain overwhelmed me.

I should never have cashed that check.

None of this should have happened.

I sat on the edge of her hospital bed, the one wedged into what used to be a playroom and now buzzed with machinery I still didn’t fully understand. The story rolled from my lips on autopilot.

Silvia’s voice was paper thin. “Not by the hair of my chinny chin chin.”

I smiled and looked up from the book. Her eyes, watery and sunken but still bright with some kind of impossible strength, held mine. Her bald head caught the soft yellow glow of her bedside lamp, and a thin, clear tube ran from her IV pole into her arm, the only arm not buried in stuffed animals and a threadbare quilt Margaret had sewn when we found out we were having a girl.

Margaret. God, if she could see all this now.

The monitor to Silvia’s left gave its soft, rhythmic beep. A lullaby in reverse. Not calming. Just… constant.

I sighed and kissed her forehead, lingering there a moment longer than usual. “I’ve got to work, sweetheart.”

Then came the cough. Deep, hacking, cruel. Her tiny hands clenched at the quilt. I reached for the suction tube, but it passed quickly. Just a cruel reminder.

Her face softened. She turned away, snuggling deeper into the blanket. “Okay…”

I ordered it. For once, I wasn’t the one delivering someone else’s dinner, I was ordering my own to be delivered. It felt strangely empowering, like I’d crossed some invisible threshold. Expensive, sure, but tonight felt like a moment worth marking.

We ate on paper plates in bed, the glow of cartoons still dancing on the screen. Silvia barely made it through two slices before her eyelids started to flutter. Her medication pulled her under in gentle waves.

I kissed her goodnight and pulled the blanket over her chest.

She was already asleep.

I stepped into my room, lay down on the bed, and stared at the ceiling.

For the first time in what felt like forever, my muscles relaxed.

Sleep came quickly.

But it didn’t last.

The fire alarm blared.

I jolted upright, my heart thundering in my chest. Then I heard it, Silvia’s scream. High-pitched and full of terror, coming from her room.

I was out of bed and sprinting down the hall before I even registered moving. Smoke curled out from beneath her door. I grabbed the handle, already hot to the touch, and threw the door open.

“Silvia!” I screamed.

A wall of heat hit me like a truck. The moment the door opened, the backdraft exploded. Fire burst outward, roaring like a beast unleashed. The flames swallowed my daughter’s screams, turning them into echoes of agony.

The blast knocked me off my feet, slamming my head hard against the wall. Then, nothing.

When I opened my eyes again, I was on my back in an ambulance. The ceiling lights flickered overhead. Oxygen tubes. The scent of burned plastic and char. The wailing sound wasn’t a siren, it was Susan.

I tried to sit up, but a paramedic pressed me down gently. “You’ve got to stay still, sir. You’ve been burned pretty badly.”

I winced, groaning, pain flaring along my arms and neck. My skin felt tight and seared.

“Where’s Silvia?” I gasped. “Where is she?!”

Another paramedic, older, his eyes grim, stepped over.

I turned my head, trying to see past the doors. The house was just bones now, a skeleton charred black against the early morning sky.

“I’m sorry,” the paramedic said quietly. “We couldn’t get to her in time. The firemen think it started in her room. Electrical short from the medical equipment. There was nothing anyone could do.”

The words didn’t register. Couldn’t.

I screamed. Cursed. Fought against the straps holding me down until the pain overwhelmed me.

I should never have cashed that check.

None of this should have happened.

The storybook was old, the kind of yellow-paged paperback you'd find buried in a church rummage sale bin. The cover had been taped back on years ago, long before Silvia could read the title for herself. But she didn’t need to. She already knew how it ended.

I sat on the edge of her hospital bed, the one wedged into what used to be a playroom and now buzzed with machinery I still didn’t fully understand. The story rolled from my lips on autopilot.

“Then the Big Bad Wolf said, ‘Little pig, little pig, let me come in.’”

Silvia’s voice was paper thin. “Not by the hair of my chinny chin chin.”

I smiled and looked up from the book. Her eyes, watery and sunken but still bright with some kind of impossible strength, held mine. Her bald head caught the soft yellow glow of her bedside lamp, and a thin, clear tube ran from her IV pole into her arm, the only arm not buried in stuffed animals and a threadbare quilt Margaret had sewn when we found out we were having a girl.

Margaret. God, if she could see all this now.

The monitor to Silvia’s left gave its soft, rhythmic beep. A lullaby in reverse. Not calming. Just… constant.

I read through the rest of the story, each word falling heavier than the last. The pigs survived. The wolf didn’t win. Happy ending. Always.

I closed the book and brushed a wisp of invisible hair from Silvia’s forehead. Habit. She hadn’t had hair in over a year now.

“That was a good one,” she said softly.

“It’s always been your favorite.”

“I like the third pig,” she said. “He’s smart. He makes a house that doesn’t fall over.”

I nodded, trying to mask the lump in my throat. “Yeah. He’s the smartest of them all.”

Silvia yawned, then frowned. “Is Grandma Susan staying tonight?”

“She is.”

She looked away, lips puckering. “Why can’t *you* stay?”

I sighed and kissed her forehead, lingering there a moment longer than usual. “I’ve got to work, sweetheart.”

“You’re always working.”

Then came the cough. Deep, hacking, cruel. Her tiny hands clenched at the quilt. I reached for the suction tube, but it passed quickly. Just a cruel reminder.

I stroked her hand, smiling down at her with everything I could scrape together. “I’m trying really hard not to work *more*, baby.”

Her face softened. She turned away, snuggling deeper into the blanket. “Okay…”

I sat there for another minute, just watching her. The slight rise and fall of her chest. The beep… beep… beep… from the monitor. The pale light on her face. Her skin was translucent now, like her blood didn’t know where to hide.

My mom, Susan, would be in soon. She stayed over most nights now. I don’t know what I’d do without her. Probably lose my mind entirely.

I worked construction during the day, long, backbreaking hours in the cold Wisconsin wind. Then came the deliveries. GrubRunner, FoodHop, DineDash, whatever app was paying. I spent most evenings ferrying burgers and pad thai to apartment complexes that all looked the same.

The debt… it was like being buried under wet cement. Silvia’s treatment costs were nightmarish even *with* insurance. And everything else didn’t pause just because you were drowning. Mortgage. Groceries. Utilities. Gas. There were days I swore the air cost money too.

I slept in snatches. Lived in overdrive. Every moment I wasn’t working, I felt like I should be.

But right then, as I stood and tucked the quilt around Silvia’s legs, I let myself pretend things were normal.

“Goodnight, baby girl.”

“Night, Daddy.”

Her voice was barely louder than the monitor.

I turned off the lamp, and for a brief second, the darkness felt peaceful.

Then I opened the door and stepped out into the hall.

Back into the weight of straw.

The doorbell rang. I paused halfway down the hallway and turned back toward Silvia’s room. “That’s Grandma,” I said gently, poking my head in. “She’s here to keep you company.”

Silvia mumbled something sleepy in reply, eyes already fluttering closed.

I headed to the front door and opened it to find my mother, Susan, bundled against the chill with her overnight bag in one hand and a small stack of envelopes in the other.

“Evening,” she said softly, stepping inside and handing me the letters. “Got the mail for you.”

“Thanks, Ma,” I said, taking them from her.

She gave me a once-over and pursed her lips. “You look tired.”

“I am,” I said, holding up the stack. “And I don’t get to sleep much while these keep showing up.”

Her eyes lingered on the envelopes, face creasing with a mixture of concern and resignation. She gave my shoulder a gentle squeeze.

“I’ll go check on her,” she said.

I nodded, thumbing through the letters as she made her way upstairs. I could hear her soft footsteps creaking along the old hardwood as she headed to Silvia’s room.

Bills. Bills. Another bill. A grim parade of due dates and balances I couldn’t meet.

Then one envelope stood out.

It was cream-colored, thick, not the usual stark white of medical statements. In the upper-left corner, printed in silver ink, was a stylized logo: a darkened moon with a sliver of light just beginning to eclipse it.

**Eclipse Indemnity Corporation**.

Addressed to me.

I stared at the logo for a long moment. I’d never heard of the company before. It didn’t sound familiar, but the envelope didn’t look like junk mail either. I pushed the stack of bills aside and tore the flap open carefully.

Inside was a letter.

The opening lines made my stomach drop.

“We offer our sincerest condolences for the tragic loss of your home and beloved child, Silvia, in the recent house fire. Enclosed you will find the settlement documents related to claim #7745-A…”

I blinked, reading it again, sure I’d misunderstood. But the words were there, printed in elegant serif type. The death of my child. The destruction of my house. A fire that had never happened.

My heart beat faster. My lips curled in a grimace. What kind of sick scam was this?

Then my eyes landed on the settlement amount.

Three hundred thousand dollars for the wrongful death of Silvia.

Five hundred thousand for the destruction of the house.

A check slid out from between the folds of the letter, perfectly printed and crisp, made out in my name. **$800,000**.

My hand trembled as I held it. The paper felt real. The signature, the watermark, the routing information, all of it looked legitimate.

It wouldn’t last forever. Not even close. But maybe… maybe I could stop delivering food until two in the morning. Maybe I could finish my degree. Get a better job. With benefits. Maybe I could be home more. Take Silvia to her appointments. Actually be there.

My mind ran wild with possibilities, wheels spinning on a road that hadn’t existed five minutes ago.

“Frank?”

I jolted.

Susan stood in the kitchen doorway, holding up a bag of lemons. “I brought some fresh ones. Mind if I make lemonade?”

I blinked at her. “Uh… yeah. Sure. That’s fine.”

She smiled and turned toward the counter.

“What’s that you’re holding?” she asked casually.

“Oh, nothing,” I said quickly. “Just one of those fake checks they send out. You know, to get you to trade in your car or refinance or something.”

I folded the letter and the check in one motion and slid them into my back pocket.

Susan gave me a look, but didn’t press. She turned to the sink, humming softly as she washed the lemons.

I stood there, staring at nothing, my mind still on the number.

Eight hundred thousand dollars.

For a life that hadn’t been lost.

Susan nodded from the sink, her voice drifting back to me. “She’s already drifting off. That medication makes her so sleepy, poor thing. But I’m going to make a pitcher of lemonade for when she wakes up tomorrow. Let it chill overnight.”

I nodded absently. “She’ll love that.”

I stepped forward and gave my mom a hug. “Thanks again, Ma.”

She held on tight for a moment. “Be safe tonight.”

I left quietly, climbing into the truck parked in the driveway. Once inside, I pulled out the check again and stared at it under the dome light.

It had to be a scam. I didn’t have insurance through any Eclipse Indemnity Corporation. Hell, I didn’t have homeowners insurance. I didn’t have life insurance, for myself or for Silvia.

I thought about tearing it in half. Raising it to the edge of the steering wheel, pressing it just enough to crease.

But I couldn’t. I couldn’t bring myself to do it.

So I drove. House to house. Door to door. Smelling like fries and grease by the time the clock crawled toward three a.m. My hands still checked my pocket between orders, feeling the folded slip of paper there. The weight of what it promised. The sick feeling of what it implied.

By the time I turned back onto my street, I’d made a decision.

I’d go to the bank first thing in the morning.

See if the check was even real.

The bank opened at eight. I was waiting in the parking lot at seven forty-five, holding a paper cup of gas station coffee that I hadn’t touched. I stepped in as the doors unlocked and made my way to the counter.

The teller was a young woman with kind eyes and a tired smile. I handed over the check without ceremony.

Her smile faltered as her eyes scanned the numbers.

She looked up at me. “I’m going to need to check with my manager on this. One moment.”

She disappeared into the back, check in hand.

Minutes passed. My legs started to ache. My mind spiraled.

Of course it was fake. I’d just handed some poor teller a piece of garbage. Probably thought I was a scammer.

Then she returned. Smiling again. A little more carefully.

“It cleared,” she said. “The funds have been deposited. You’ll see them in your account shortly.”

She handed me a printed receipt. It showed the balance. All of it.

I stared at the paper.

Eight hundred thousand dollars.

I swallowed hard. “Thanks,” I said softly.

And then I walked out into the morning light, my head spinning with possibilities I didn’t know how to believe in yet.

I climbed back into my truck and immediately pulled out my phone. My fingers trembled slightly as I opened the banking app. Sure enough, the check had cleared. Eight hundred thousand dollars sat in my account like a cinder block.

I stared at it in disbelief. Then, without meaning to, I slammed my fist against the roof of the cab and let out a sharp, guttural yell. Not joy. Not anger. Something heavier. A release of pressure I hadn’t even realized had been building.

I called in sick. Said I had a fever, maybe food poisoning. Didn’t wait for a reply. I just started the engine and headed home.

When I pulled up to the house, a strange sound hit me, sharp and shrill, echoing through the front windows.

The fire alarm.

I threw the truck into park and ran to the front door, flinging it open with my heart already pounding.

Smoke wafted through the air from the kitchen. Not heavy, but thick enough to haze the room. Grandma Susan stood at the stove, waving a dish towel furiously at the ceiling. The toaster oven was smoking lightly, a blackened pastry visible through the glass.

“Sorry!” she called over the blaring alarm. “I thought five minutes would be okay. I just wanted to crisp them up a little.”

I rushed over and helped her wave the smoke away. The alarm, finally detecting clear air, chirped twice and went silent.

From upstairs came Silvia’s voice, frail and frightened. “Daddy? What’s happening?”

Susan looked over at me. “Why are you home so early?”

“Site’s missing materials,” I said quickly. “They sent us home.”

It was a lie. A clean, easy one. I didn’t have the energy to explain the truth.

“I’ll go up with you,” she said gently.

We climbed the stairs together and found Silvia sitting upright in bed, clutching her stuffed lamb.

“Hey,” I said, crossing the room and kneeling beside her. “Just a silly mistake downstairs. Grandma left the toaster on too long.”

Silvia’s eyes were wide, rimmed with worry. “Was it a fire?”

“Nothing like that,” I said, pulling her into a tight hug. The kind of hug only a dad could give when he thought he’d almost lost everything. “Just a burnt breakfast. That’s all.”

She nodded against my chest. “Okay.”

Then she pulled back, smiling sleepily. “I’m glad you’re home.”

I kissed her forehead. “Me too, sweetheart. Me too.”

I turned to Susan, who had stayed quietly in the doorway. “I think I’m going to take the day,” I said. “Catch up on bills, maybe just… be here for a while.”

Susan smiled, her face softening with that motherly warmth. “That sounds like a wonderful idea. You could use the rest.”

She went back downstairs and poured two glasses of lemonade, one for me, one for Silvia, before packing up her things. Before she left, she hugged us both tightly.

I set up my laptop on a folding tray in Silvia’s room while she flipped on her favorite cartoons. While she watched, giggling at some slapstick moment on screen, I quietly pulled up account after account and began chipping away at the mountain.

Electric. Phone. Credit cards. Medical bills. I paid them off in full, one after another. Each click lifted a weight off my chest, but with every cleared balance came a strange, crawling unease.

That fire downstairs… was it really just an accident?

Or had it started because I cashed that check?

I tried to shake the thought, but it lingered like smoke behind the eyes.

Silvia seemed more alert than usual. Her medication hadn’t kicked in yet, and she was drawing something on the tray next to her bed with thick crayons. When she finished, she held it up with both hands, beaming.

It was a picture of her and me, she had long, wavy hair, and I was wearing a bright yellow hard hat. We were holding hands in the backyard under a blue sky.

“I wanna do that again someday,” she said. “Be outside. Without all the wires.”

I kissed her forehead again, heart squeezing. “One day, I promise. We’ll be out there.”

She nodded seriously, folding the drawing and tucking it beside her bed. “I’m glad you’re home today. I miss you when you’re gone.”

I swallowed. “I miss you too, sweetheart. But you know what? I might not need to work as much anymore.”

Her eyes lit up. “Really?”

I nodded. “Really.”

She threw her arms around me and squealed. “Yay!”

While she napped, I applied for the next semester at the local university. Just two semesters shy of finishing my degree. Tuition paid in full. It felt surreal, like planting roots after drifting too long.

That night, I let Silvia pick dinner. She pointed to a local pizza place she’d only seen once, the kind that did gourmet pies and only allowed pickups. She just wanted a plain cheese pizza, of course.

I ordered it. For once, I wasn’t the one delivering someone else’s dinner, I was ordering my own to be delivered. It felt strangely empowering, like I’d crossed some invisible threshold. Expensive, sure, but tonight felt like a moment worth marking.

We ate on paper plates in bed, the glow of cartoons still dancing on the screen. Silvia barely made it through two slices before her eyelids started to flutter. Her medication pulled her under in gentle waves.

I kissed her goodnight and pulled the blanket over her chest.

She was already asleep.

I was out of bed and sprinting down the hall before I even registered moving. Smoke curled out from beneath her door. I grabbed the handle, already hot to the touch, and threw the door open.

“Silvia!” I screamed.

A wall of heat hit me like a truck. The moment the door opened, the backdraft exploded. Fire burst outward, roaring like a beast unleashed. The flames swallowed my daughter’s screams, turning them into echoes of agony.

The blast knocked me off my feet, slamming my head hard against the wall. Then, nothing.

When I opened my eyes again, I was on my back in an ambulance. The ceiling lights flickered overhead. Oxygen tubes. The scent of burned plastic and char. The wailing sound wasn’t a siren, it was Susan.

I tried to sit up, but a paramedic pressed me down gently. “You’ve got to stay still, sir. You’ve been burned pretty badly.”

I winced, groaning, pain flaring along my arms and neck. My skin felt tight and seared.

“Where’s Silvia?” I gasped. “Where is she?!”

Silvia’s eyes were wide, rimmed with worry. “Was it a fire?”

“Nothing like that,” I said, pulling her into a tight hug. The kind of hug only a dad could give when he thought he’d almost lost everything. “Just a burnt breakfast. That’s all.”

She nodded against my chest. “Okay.”

Then she pulled back, smiling sleepily. “I’m glad you’re home.”

I kissed her forehead. “Me too, sweetheart. Me too.”

I turned to Susan, who had stayed quietly in the doorway. “I think I’m going to take the day,” I said. “Catch up on bills, maybe just… be here for a while.”

Susan smiled, her face softening with that motherly warmth. “That sounds like a wonderful idea. You could use the rest.”

She went back downstairs and poured two glasses of lemonade, one for me, one for Silvia, before packing up her things. Before she left, she hugged us both tightly.

I set up my laptop on a folding tray in Silvia’s room while she flipped on her favorite cartoons. While she watched, giggling at some slapstick moment on screen, I quietly pulled up account after account and began chipping away at the mountain.

Electric. Phone. Credit cards. Medical bills. I paid them off in full, one after another. Each click lifted a weight off my chest, but with every cleared balance came a strange, crawling unease.

That fire downstairs… was it really just an accident?

Or had it started because I cashed that check?

I tried to shake the thought, but it lingered like smoke behind the eyes.

Silvia seemed more alert than usual. Her medication hadn’t kicked in yet, and she was drawing something on the tray next to her bed with thick crayons. When she finished, she held it up with both hands, beaming.

It was a picture of her and me, she had long, wavy hair, and I was wearing a bright yellow hard hat. We were holding hands in the backyard under a blue sky.

“I wanna do that again someday,” she said. “Be outside. Without all the wires.”

I kissed her forehead again, heart squeezing. “One day, I promise. We’ll be out there.”

She nodded seriously, folding the drawing and tucking it beside her bed. “I’m glad you’re home today. I miss you when you’re gone.”

I swallowed. “I miss you too, sweetheart. But you know what? I might not need to work as much anymore.”

Her eyes lit up. “Really?”

I nodded. “Really.”

She threw her arms around me and squealed. “Yay!”

While she napped, I applied for the next semester at the local university. Just two semesters shy of finishing my degree. Tuition paid in full. It felt surreal, like planting roots after drifting too long.

That night, I let Silvia pick dinner. She pointed to a local pizza place she’d only seen once, the kind that did gourmet pies and only allowed pickups. She just wanted a plain cheese pizza, of course.

I ordered it. For once, I wasn’t the one delivering someone else’s dinner, I was ordering my own to be delivered. It felt strangely empowering, like I’d crossed some invisible threshold. Expensive, sure, but tonight felt like a moment worth marking.

We ate on paper plates in bed, the glow of cartoons still dancing on the screen. Silvia barely made it through two slices before her eyelids started to flutter. Her medication pulled her under in gentle waves.

I kissed her goodnight and pulled the blanket over her chest.

She was already asleep.

I stepped into my room, lay down on the bed, and stared at the ceiling.

For the first time in what felt like forever, my muscles relaxed.

Sleep came quickly.

But it didn’t last.

The fire alarm blared.

I jolted upright, my heart thundering in my chest. Then I heard it, Silvia’s scream. High-pitched and full of terror, coming from her room.

I was out of bed and sprinting down the hall before I even registered moving. Smoke curled out from beneath her door. I grabbed the handle, already hot to the touch, and threw the door open.

“Silvia!” I screamed.

A wall of heat hit me like a truck. The moment the door opened, the backdraft exploded. Fire burst outward, roaring like a beast unleashed. The flames swallowed my daughter’s screams, turning them into echoes of agony.

The blast knocked me off my feet, slamming my head hard against the wall. Then, nothing.

When I opened my eyes again, I was on my back in an ambulance. The ceiling lights flickered overhead. Oxygen tubes. The scent of burned plastic and char. The wailing sound wasn’t a siren, it was Susan.

I tried to sit up, but a paramedic pressed me down gently. “You’ve got to stay still, sir. You’ve been burned pretty badly.”

I winced, groaning, pain flaring along my arms and neck. My skin felt tight and seared.

“Where’s Silvia?” I gasped. “Where is she?!”

Another paramedic, older, his eyes grim, stepped over.

I turned my head, trying to see past the doors. The house was just bones now, a skeleton charred black against the early morning sky.

“I’m sorry,” the paramedic said quietly. “We couldn’t get to her in time. The firemen think it started in her room. Electrical short from the medical equipment. There was nothing anyone could do.”

The words didn’t register. Couldn’t.

I screamed. Cursed. Fought against the straps holding me down until the pain overwhelmed me.

I should never have cashed that check.

None of this should have happened.

The storybook was old, the kind of yellow-paged paperback you'd find buried in a church rummage sale bin. The cover had been taped back on years ago, long before Silvia could read the title for herself. But she didn’t need to. She already knew how it ended.

I sat on the edge of her hospital bed, the one wedged into what used to be a playroom and now buzzed with machinery I still didn’t fully understand. The story rolled from my lips on autopilot.

“Then the Big Bad Wolf said, ‘Little pig, little pig, let me come in.’”

Silvia’s voice was paper thin. “Not by the hair of my chinny chin chin.”

I smiled and looked up from the book. Her eyes, watery and sunken but still bright with some kind of impossible strength, held mine. Her bald head caught the soft yellow glow of her bedside lamp, and a thin, clear tube ran from her IV pole into her arm, the only arm not buried in stuffed animals and a threadbare quilt Margaret had sewn when we found out we were having a girl.

Margaret. God, if she could see all this now.

The monitor to Silvia’s left gave its soft, rhythmic beep. A lullaby in reverse. Not calming. Just… constant.

I read through the rest of the story, each word falling heavier than the last. The pigs survived. The wolf didn’t win. Happy ending. Always.

I closed the book and brushed a wisp of invisible hair from Silvia’s forehead. Habit. She hadn’t had hair in over a year now.

“That was a good one,” she said softly.

“It’s always been your favorite.”

“I like the third pig,” she said. “He’s smart. He makes a house that doesn’t fall over.”

I nodded, trying to mask the lump in my throat. “Yeah. He’s the smartest of them all.”

Silvia yawned, then frowned. “Is Grandma Susan staying tonight?”

“She is.”

She looked away, lips puckering. “Why can’t *you* stay?”

I sighed and kissed her forehead, lingering there a moment longer than usual. “I’ve got to work, sweetheart.”

“You’re always working.”

Then came the cough. Deep, hacking, cruel. Her tiny hands clenched at the quilt. I reached for the suction tube, but it passed quickly. Just a cruel reminder.

I stroked her hand, smiling down at her with everything I could scrape together. “I’m trying really hard not to work *more*, baby.”

Her face softened. She turned away, snuggling deeper into the blanket. “Okay…”

I sat there for another minute, just watching her. The slight rise and fall of her chest. The beep… beep… beep… from the monitor. The pale light on her face. Her skin was translucent now, like her blood didn’t know where to hide.

My mom, Susan, would be in soon. She stayed over most nights now. I don’t know what I’d do without her. Probably lose my mind entirely.

I worked construction during the day, long, backbreaking hours in the cold Wisconsin wind. Then came the deliveries. GrubRunner, FoodHop, DineDash, whatever app was paying. I spent most evenings ferrying burgers and pad thai to apartment complexes that all looked the same.

The debt… it was like being buried under wet cement. Silvia’s treatment costs were nightmarish even *with* insurance. And everything else didn’t pause just because you were drowning. Mortgage. Groceries. Utilities. Gas. There were days I swore the air cost money too.

I slept in snatches. Lived in overdrive. Every moment I wasn’t working, I felt like I should be.

But right then, as I stood and tucked the quilt around Silvia’s legs, I let myself pretend things were normal.

“Goodnight, baby girl.”

“Night, Daddy.”

Her voice was barely louder than the monitor.

I turned off the lamp, and for a brief second, the darkness felt peaceful.

Then I opened the door and stepped out into the hall.

Back into the weight of straw.

The doorbell rang. I paused halfway down the hallway and turned back toward Silvia’s room. “That’s Grandma,” I said gently, poking my head in. “She’s here to keep you company.”

Silvia mumbled something sleepy in reply, eyes already fluttering closed.

I headed to the front door and opened it to find my mother, Susan, bundled against the chill with her overnight bag in one hand and a small stack of envelopes in the other.

“Evening,” she said softly, stepping inside and handing me the letters. “Got the mail for you.”

“Thanks, Ma,” I said, taking them from her.

She gave me a once-over and pursed her lips. “You look tired.”

“I am,” I said, holding up the stack. “And I don’t get to sleep much while these keep showing up.”

Her eyes lingered on the envelopes, face creasing with a mixture of concern and resignation. She gave my shoulder a gentle squeeze.

“I’ll go check on her,” she said.

I nodded, thumbing through the letters as she made her way upstairs. I could hear her soft footsteps creaking along the old hardwood as she headed to Silvia’s room.

Bills. Bills. Another bill. A grim parade of due dates and balances I couldn’t meet.

Then one envelope stood out.

It was cream-colored, thick, not the usual stark white of medical statements. In the upper-left corner, printed in silver ink, was a stylized logo: a darkened moon with a sliver of light just beginning to eclipse it.

**Eclipse Indemnity Corporation**.

Addressed to me.

I stared at the logo for a long moment. I’d never heard of the company before. It didn’t sound familiar, but the envelope didn’t look like junk mail either. I pushed the stack of bills aside and tore the flap open carefully.

Inside was a letter.

The opening lines made my stomach drop.

“We offer our sincerest condolences for the tragic loss of your home and beloved child, Silvia, in the recent house fire. Enclosed you will find the settlement documents related to claim #7745-A…”

I blinked, reading it again, sure I’d misunderstood. But the words were there, printed in elegant serif type. The death of my child. The destruction of my house. A fire that had never happened.

My heart beat faster. My lips curled in a grimace. What kind of sick scam was this?

Then my eyes landed on the settlement amount.

Three hundred thousand dollars for the wrongful death of Silvia.

Five hundred thousand for the destruction of the house.

A check slid out from between the folds of the letter, perfectly printed and crisp, made out in my name. **$800,000**.

My hand trembled as I held it. The paper felt real. The signature, the watermark, the routing information, all of it looked legitimate.

It wouldn’t last forever. Not even close. But maybe… maybe I could stop delivering food until two in the morning. Maybe I could finish my degree. Get a better job. With benefits. Maybe I could be home more. Take Silvia to her appointments. Actually be there.

My mind ran wild with possibilities, wheels spinning on a road that hadn’t existed five minutes ago.

“Frank?”

I jolted.

Susan stood in the kitchen doorway, holding up a bag of lemons. “I brought some fresh ones. Mind if I make lemonade?”

I blinked at her. “Uh… yeah. Sure. That’s fine.”

She smiled and turned toward the counter.

“What’s that you’re holding?” she asked casually.

“Oh, nothing,” I said quickly. “Just one of those fake checks they send out. You know, to get you to trade in your car or refinance or something.”

I folded the letter and the check in one motion and slid them into my back pocket.

Susan gave me a look, but didn’t press. She turned to the sink, humming softly as she washed the lemons.

I stood there, staring at nothing, my mind still on the number.

Eight hundred thousand dollars.

For a life that hadn’t been lost.

Susan nodded from the sink, her voice drifting back to me. “She’s already drifting off. That medication makes her so sleepy, poor thing. But I’m going to make a pitcher of lemonade for when she wakes up tomorrow. Let it chill overnight.”

I nodded absently. “She’ll love that.”

I stepped forward and gave my mom a hug. “Thanks again, Ma.”

She held on tight for a moment. “Be safe tonight.”

I left quietly, climbing into the truck parked in the driveway. Once inside, I pulled out the check again and stared at it under the dome light.

It had to be a scam. I didn’t have insurance through any Eclipse Indemnity Corporation. Hell, I didn’t have homeowners insurance. I didn’t have life insurance, for myself or for Silvia.

I thought about tearing it in half. Raising it to the edge of the steering wheel, pressing it just enough to crease.

But I couldn’t. I couldn’t bring myself to do it.

So I drove. House to house. Door to door. Smelling like fries and grease by the time the clock crawled toward three a.m. My hands still checked my pocket between orders, feeling the folded slip of paper there. The weight of what it promised. The sick feeling of what it implied.

By the time I turned back onto my street, I’d made a decision.

I’d go to the bank first thing in the morning.

See if the check was even real.

The bank opened at eight. I was waiting in the parking lot at seven forty-five, holding a paper cup of gas station coffee that I hadn’t touched. I stepped in as the doors unlocked and made my way to the counter.

The teller was a young woman with kind eyes and a tired smile. I handed over the check without ceremony.

Her smile faltered as her eyes scanned the numbers.

She looked up at me. “I’m going to need to check with my manager on this. One moment.”

She disappeared into the back, check in hand.

Minutes passed. My legs started to ache. My mind spiraled.

Of course it was fake. I’d just handed some poor teller a piece of garbage. Probably thought I was a scammer.

Then she returned. Smiling again. A little more carefully.

“It cleared,” she said. “The funds have been deposited. You’ll see them in your account shortly.”

She handed me a printed receipt. It showed the balance. All of it.

I stared at the paper.

Eight hundred thousand dollars.

I swallowed hard. “Thanks,” I said softly.

And then I walked out into the morning light, my head spinning with possibilities I didn’t know how to believe in yet.

I climbed back into my truck and immediately pulled out my phone. My fingers trembled slightly as I opened the banking app. Sure enough, the check had cleared. Eight hundred thousand dollars sat in my account like a cinder block.

I stared at it in disbelief. Then, without meaning to, I slammed my fist against the roof of the cab and let out a sharp, guttural yell. Not joy. Not anger. Something heavier. A release of pressure I hadn’t even realized had been building.

I called in sick. Said I had a fever, maybe food poisoning. Didn’t wait for a reply. I just started the engine and headed home.

When I pulled up to the house, a strange sound hit me, sharp and shrill, echoing through the front windows.

The fire alarm.

I threw the truck into park and ran to the front door, flinging it open with my heart already pounding.

Smoke wafted through the air from the kitchen. Not heavy, but thick enough to haze the room. Grandma Susan stood at the stove, waving a dish towel furiously at the ceiling. The toaster oven was smoking lightly, a blackened pastry visible through the glass.

“Sorry!” she called over the blaring alarm. “I thought five minutes would be okay. I just wanted to crisp them up a little.”

I rushed over and helped her wave the smoke away. The alarm, finally detecting clear air, chirped twice and went silent.

From upstairs came Silvia’s voice, frail and frightened. “Daddy? What’s happening?”

Susan looked over at me. “Why are you home so early?”

“Site’s missing materials,” I said quickly. “They sent us home.”

It was a lie. A clean, easy one. I didn’t have the energy to explain the truth.

“I’ll go up with you,” she said gently.

We climbed the stairs together and found Silvia sitting upright in bed, clutching her stuffed lamb.

“Hey,” I said, crossing the room and kneeling beside her. “Just a silly mistake downstairs. Grandma left the toaster on too long.”

Silvia’s eyes were wide, rimmed with worry. “Was it a fire?”

“Nothing like that,” I said, pulling her into a tight hug. The kind of hug only a dad could give when he thought he’d almost lost everything. “Just a burnt breakfast. That’s all.”

She nodded against my chest. “Okay.”

Then she pulled back, smiling sleepily. “I’m glad you’re home.”

I kissed her forehead. “Me too, sweetheart. Me too.”

I turned to Susan, who had stayed quietly in the doorway. “I think I’m going to take the day,” I said. “Catch up on bills, maybe just… be here for a while.”

Susan smiled, her face softening with that motherly warmth. “That sounds like a wonderful idea. You could use the rest.”

She went back downstairs and poured two glasses of lemonade, one for me, one for Silvia, before packing up her things. Before she left, she hugged us both tightly.

I set up my laptop on a folding tray in Silvia’s room while she flipped on her favorite cartoons. While she watched, giggling at some slapstick moment on screen, I quietly pulled up account after account and began chipping away at the mountain.

Electric. Phone. Credit cards. Medical bills. I paid them off in full, one after another. Each click lifted a weight off my chest, but with every cleared balance came a strange, crawling unease.

That fire downstairs… was it really just an accident?

Or had it started because I cashed that check?

I tried to shake the thought, but it lingered like smoke behind the eyes.

I swallowed. “I miss you too, sweetheart. But you know what? I might not need to work as much anymore.”

Her eyes lit up. “Really?”

I nodded. “Really.”

She threw her arms around me and squealed. “Yay!”

While she napped, I applied for the next semester at the local university. Just two semesters shy of finishing my degree. Tuition paid in full. It felt surreal, like planting roots after drifting too long.

That night, I let Silvia pick dinner. She pointed to a local pizza place she’d only seen once, the kind that did gourmet pies and only allowed pickups. She just wanted a plain cheese pizza, of course.

I ordered it. For once, I wasn’t the one delivering someone else’s dinner, I was ordering my own to be delivered. It felt strangely empowering, like I’d crossed some invisible threshold. Expensive, sure, but tonight felt like a moment worth marking.

I left quietly, climbing into the truck parked in the driveway. Once inside, I pulled out the check again and stared at it under the dome light.

It had to be a scam. I didn’t have insurance through any Eclipse Indemnity Corporation. Hell, I didn’t have homeowners insurance. I didn’t have life insurance, for myself or for Silvia.

I thought about tearing it in half. Raising it to the edge of the steering wheel, pressing it just enough to crease.

But I couldn’t. I couldn’t bring myself to do it.

So I drove. House to house. Door to door. Smelling like fries and grease by the time the clock crawled toward three a.m. My hands still checked my pocket between orders, feeling the folded slip of paper there. The weight of what it promised. The sick feeling of what it implied.

By the time I turned back onto my street, I’d made a decision.

I’d go to the bank first thing in the morning.

See if the check was even real.

The bank opened at eight. I was waiting in the parking lot at seven forty-five, holding a paper cup of gas station coffee that I hadn’t touched. I stepped in as the doors unlocked and made my way to the counter.

The teller was a young woman with kind eyes and a tired smile. I handed over the check without ceremony.

Her smile faltered as her eyes scanned the numbers.

She looked up at me. “I’m going to need to check with my manager on this. One moment.”

She disappeared into the back, check in hand.

Minutes passed. My legs started to ache. My mind spiraled.

Of course it was fake. I’d just handed some poor teller a piece of garbage. Probably thought I was a scammer.

Then she returned. Smiling again. A little more carefully.

“It cleared,” she said. “The funds have been deposited. You’ll see them in your account shortly.”

She handed me a printed receipt. It showed the balance. All of it.

I stared at the paper.

Eight hundred thousand dollars.

I swallowed hard. “Thanks,” I said softly.

And then I walked out into the morning light, my head spinning with possibilities I didn’t know how to believe in yet.

I climbed back into my truck and immediately pulled out my phone. My fingers trembled slightly as I opened the banking app. Sure enough, the check had cleared. Eight hundred thousand dollars sat in my account like a cinder block.

I stared at it in disbelief. Then, without meaning to, I slammed my fist against the roof of the cab and let out a sharp, guttural yell. Not joy. Not anger. Something heavier. A release of pressure I hadn’t even realized had been building.

I called in sick. Said I had a fever, maybe food poisoning. Didn’t wait for a reply. I just started the engine and headed home.

When I pulled up to the house, a strange sound hit me, sharp and shrill, echoing through the front windows.

The fire alarm.

I threw the truck into park and ran to the front door, flinging it open with my heart already pounding.

Smoke wafted through the air from the kitchen. Not heavy, but thick enough to haze the room. Grandma Susan stood at the stove, waving a dish towel furiously at the ceiling. The toaster oven was smoking lightly, a blackened pastry visible through the glass.

“Sorry!” she called over the blaring alarm. “I thought five minutes would be okay. I just wanted to crisp them up a little.”

I rushed over and helped her wave the smoke away. The alarm, finally detecting clear air, chirped twice and went silent.

From upstairs came Silvia’s voice, frail and frightened. “Daddy? What’s happening?”

Susan looked over at me. “Why are you home so early?”

“Site’s missing materials,” I said quickly. “They sent us home.”

It was a lie. A clean, easy one. I didn’t have the energy to explain the truth.

“I’ll go up with you,” she said gently.

We climbed the stairs together and found Silvia sitting upright in bed, clutching her stuffed lamb.

“Hey,” I said, crossing the room and kneeling beside her. “Just a silly mistake downstairs. Grandma left the toaster on too long.”

Silvia’s eyes were wide, rimmed with worry. “Was it a fire?”

“Nothing like that,” I said, pulling her into a tight hug. The kind of hug only a dad could give when he thought he’d almost lost everything. “Just a burnt breakfast. That’s all.”

She nodded against my chest. “Okay.”

Then she pulled back, smiling sleepily. “I’m glad you’re home.”

I kissed her forehead. “Me too, sweetheart. Me too.”

I turned to Susan, who had stayed quietly in the doorway. “I think I’m going to take the day,” I said. “Catch up on bills, maybe just… be here for a while.”

Susan smiled, her face softening with that motherly warmth. “That sounds like a wonderful idea. You could use the rest.”

She went back downstairs and poured two glasses of lemonade, one for me, one for Silvia, before packing up her things. Before she left, she hugged us both tightly.

I set up my laptop on a folding tray in Silvia’s room while she flipped on her favorite cartoons. While she watched, giggling at some slapstick moment on screen, I quietly pulled up account after account and began chipping away at the mountain.

Electric. Phone. Credit cards. Medical bills. I paid them off in full, one after another. Each click lifted a weight off my chest, but with every cleared balance came a strange, crawling unease.

That fire downstairs… was it really just an accident?

Or had it started because I cashed that check?

I tried to shake the thought, but it lingered like smoke behind the eyes.

Silvia seemed more alert than usual. Her medication hadn’t kicked in yet, and she was drawing something on the tray next to her bed with thick crayons. When she finished, she held it up with both hands, beaming.

It was a picture of her and me, she had long, wavy hair, and I was wearing a bright yellow hard hat. We were holding hands in the backyard under a blue sky.

“I wanna do that again someday,” she said. “Be outside. Without all the wires.”

I kissed her forehead again, heart squeezing. “One day, I promise. We’ll be out there.”

She nodded seriously, folding the drawing and tucking it beside her bed. “I’m glad you’re home today. I miss you when you’re gone.”

I swallowed. “I miss you too, sweetheart. But you know what? I might not need to work as much anymore.”

Her eyes lit up. “Really?”

I nodded. “Really.”

She threw her arms around me and squealed. “Yay!”

While she napped, I applied for the next semester at the local university. Just two semesters shy of finishing my degree. Tuition paid in full. It felt surreal, like planting roots after drifting too long.

That night, I let Silvia pick dinner. She pointed to a local pizza place she’d only seen once, the kind that did gourmet pies and only allowed pickups. She just wanted a plain cheese pizza, of course.

I ordered it. For once, I wasn’t the one delivering someone else’s dinner, I was ordering my own to be delivered. It felt strangely empowering, like I’d crossed some invisible threshold. Expensive, sure, but tonight felt like a moment worth marking.

We ate on paper plates in bed, the glow of cartoons still dancing on the screen. Silvia barely made it through two slices before her eyelids started to flutter. Her medication pulled her under in gentle waves.

I kissed her goodnight and pulled the blanket over her chest.

She was already asleep.

I stepped into my room, lay down on the bed, and stared at the ceiling.

For the first time in what felt like forever, my muscles relaxed.

Sleep came quickly.

But it didn’t last.

The fire alarm blared.

I jolted upright, my heart thundering in my chest. Then I heard it, Silvia’s scream. High-pitched and full of terror, coming from her room.

I was out of bed and sprinting down the hall before I even registered moving. Smoke curled out from beneath her door. I grabbed the handle, already hot to the touch, and threw the door open.

“Silvia!” I screamed.

A wall of heat hit me like a truck. The moment the door opened, the backdraft exploded. Fire burst outward, roaring like a beast unleashed. The flames swallowed my daughter’s screams, turning them into echoes of agony.

The blast knocked me off my feet, slamming my head hard against the wall. Then, nothing.

When I opened my eyes again, I was on my back in an ambulance. The ceiling lights flickered overhead. Oxygen tubes. The scent of burned plastic and char. The wailing sound wasn’t a siren, it was Susan.

I tried to sit up, but a paramedic pressed me down gently. “You’ve got to stay still, sir. You’ve been burned pretty badly.”

I winced, groaning, pain flaring along my arms and neck. My skin felt tight and seared.

“Where’s Silvia?” I gasped. “Where is she?!”

Another paramedic, older, his eyes grim, stepped over.

I turned my head, trying to see past the doors. The house was just bones now, a skeleton charred black against the early morning sky.

“I’m sorry,” the paramedic said quietly. “We couldn’t get to her in time. The firemen think it started in her room. Electrical short from the medical equipment. There was nothing anyone could do.”

The words didn’t register. Couldn’t.

I screamed. Cursed. Fought against the straps holding me down until the pain overwhelmed me.

I should never have cashed that check.

None of this should have happened.

It's relatively easy work, the stakes are low, and the customers are nowhere near as bad as they were at my previous job - Chipotle. And while Chipotle had its own stupid issues >!(never being consistent with portioning instructions and trying  to screw over my coworker on his insurance after getting second degree burns. Or how Food Authority wouldn't tell us they were out of something until they HAD ALREADY FUCKING SHOWN UP)!< I still think Cumberland Farms - and, by extension, EG America I guess - easily makes me the most consistently annoyed/angry.

Because it feels like all the things they fuck up are so basic. Last night (July 7th, 2025) is a good example of what I mean: The latter half of the night was spent on my coworker's register because the one I was signed into (which also is the one that has to count the change safe at the end of every night) kept being slow. And when I say 'slow' I don't mean 'an extra few seconds to resolve card payments' I mean actual, literal, non-exaggerating MINUTES between scanning an item and having the fucking thing appear on screen as part of the transaction. One time I scanned an item an TWENTY FUCKING MINUTES LATER the whole register blue-screened (yeah, the registers just run a program overtop embedded Windows, amusingly the lottery terminal that runs on Linux has never had similar issues).

The week prior, we didn't have milk. Why? I don't know, fuck you. This isn't even the first time we've had supply issues with milk specifically in the last 2 months. It's starting to become a recurring problem. Mind you, too, this is the same milk that customers have to use for their coffee.

That is, of course, the coffee pots/warmers are working properly and the contacts on the rear of them didn't short/spark up.

We haven't had oven protector (Oven Shield I think it was called?) for like a year because 'reasons'. Speaking of the ovens, one of our ovens had the magnetron in it replaced 4-5 times (again, not an exaggeration) but God forbid they just replace the fucking things. They are literally a decade old and have been here since the store was built in 2015.

The Hyperfreeze machine (slushies, basically) hasn't worked properly, I think, ever, and some flavors (fittingly, Red Rage) are just off limits because for whatever reason they just won't mix and freeze correctly or something. I know for a fact this has led to the disappointment of at least one child.

The roller grill frame/divider that keeps the items from touching eachother and potentially causing a health hazard keeps breaking and having to be replaced every few months.

Meanwhile, the company keeps adding stupid bullshit that wastes time, money, and floor space.

We added a pizza spinner, after the box spent like 4 months sitting in our back hallway, that's supposed to keep the air inside humid to keep the pizza from drying out - that doesn't fucking work properly.

We added a whole section of toys and candy that hardly ever seems to get touched. (I can't imagine the margins on that are good enough to justify it)

We keep adding food items that we can't keep stocked and are a pain in the ass to prepare because they require multiple steps/ingredients and storage space that comes at something of a premium. We only ever have two people on the evening shift. So not only is it wasting time and money, it's also getting in the way of stuff we have to do anyway.

We have a hat-tower that no one touches because literally who cares.

We have a display with tobacco (really weed) accessories with trashy country slogans on them - which as you can imagine does real great in suburban Connecticut.

You'd be forgiven for thinking sometimes that the company was planning on shutting the store down or something. I've thought that - but then a week later a pizza spinner appears on the counter. But God forbid they replace the price displays on top of the gas pumps with digital displays. Or the big sign by the road with a digital display. It's not like we could sell gas in the event of a power outage anyway. The store was only built in 2015 so it's not like the the technology was new and expensive at the time.

It all started when I fell asleep after drinking a cup of cold milk before bed ( I usually have warm milk before bed ) and I fell asleep. In the dream, I went to a random coffee shop and you were in front of me in the line. You bought a latte or something ( don’t quite remember) and you forgot your wallet. I could see you panicking as you frantically looked back and forth and so I offered to pay. After this, you thanked me repeatedly as I walked out. I remember saying it was no big deal and you gave me your number and to call if I ever needed anything. I said thank you and left. After this, I went home as I remembered that there was a neighbor moving in and I wanted to say hello. As I rounded the corner, trucks lined the street and boxes surrounded the home. As I approached, I knocked on the door and you came out. I was shocked and so were you. I then invited you to come over and hang out in my house. You agreed excitedly and went back in to finish moving in. At around 6:37, you rang the doorbell and I invited you in. Inside, I asked if you drank. You said yes and I poured you some alcohol. You then insisted to put on a movie. I agreed and we watched some romcom ( don’t remember the specific film ), as we watched, you started to make advances. I reciprocated these advances and we got freaky on the couch. We then moved to the bed upstairs and spent the night together. We then woke up beside each other the next day and we started dating. We spent around 3 years together at which I proposed. It was after I took you out on a fancy date and we were leaving when I got down on both knees and took out the ring. You immediately said yes and not a few days later we were married at a church. It was around this point the dream ended I started sobbing, realizing it wasn’t real.

Some time ago I made what I can most accurately describe as a Macchiato 43 (recipe below). Now I thought I'd try to spice it up a little because it was quite good but seemed ""just sweet"". Today I tried to add some Grand Marnier, since Licor 43 also has some slight orange notes and is sometimes paired with cognac, and I should say it wasn't bad, it just got even sweeter than I'd expected, even though I'd tuned down the other sweeteners (like a little bit of caramel in the coffee and vanilla syrup in the milk). Now the question, do any of you have recipe's or recommendations that would improve on this?

Macchiato 43 recipe:

60 ml Licor 43
60-80 ml milk
15 ml vanilla syrup
40 ml coffee
(In the coffee: approximately 2.5 ml chocolate syrup and 7.5 ml salted caramel syrup)

Shake everything but the coffee in a shaker with ice, pour into a glass with ice and gently top with the coffee to create a layered effect.

What I did today: 20 ml Grand Marnier/40 ml Licor 43 (might wanna tune down the Grand Marnier a bit ig), 10 ml vanilla syrup instead of 15 ml and just 60 ml milk (now that I've tried it, I might want to make it 80 again).

I am kind of reluctant to add any type of citrus juice to the drink out of fear for the milk curdling. Maybe you can give me some advice on this.

Not being completely nocturnal, not needing 5 or 6 cups of coffee just to function, and sleeping less than 12 hours a day would also be great.

My grandma is a heavy smoker, she smokes inside the house every few minutes when awake, and for the past 18 years I had no problem with that (I lived with her most of the time), but when the Israel-Iran war (I live in Israel) started, she stopped sleeping (since the iranians attack at night) and instead, she smoked.

And I sat in my room (with an open window and the ceiling fan turned on) and the smoke got in because it had nowhere to go and I inhaled it. For the first few days, there wasn't any noticeable problem, but after that, I started coughing constantly and having mild chest pain.

Fortunately, a few days after these symptoms started, I went on a family vacation for a week with my mother and sister, and within a few hours away from my grandma's smoke, everything ""miraculously"" stopped. No need to mention that as soon as I got back, the coughing came back. (Not because she smoked without ventilation, but likely because I was exposed to smoke- no matter how filtered) My grandma even noticed that and told me to go to a doctor and check that cough. The doctor I went to checked my lungs, said that they were clean, said that it might be allergies, heartburn, or a virus I recently healed from. My mom jokingly said that I'm maybe allergic to my grandma's smoke, and he responded that he doesn't believe in the negative effects of second hand smoke, and ""explained"" that the smoke I get is after the smoke was ""filtered"" in the my grandma's lungs (and what about the smoke that comes out of the cigarette? That came out of the mouth of a licensed family doctor btw). Furthermore, my mother was nodding and whispering to me ""see?"" while he said that nonsense.

And that brings us to a few days ago, when my grandma woke up at \~1am (I was awake, since I have no reason to wake up early currently) and started smoking with hardly any ventilation. I went out and asked her to open the bacony shutters since the smoke gets in my room and I was choking because of that, and as a response she mumbled something like ""this is unbelieveable"", opened the shutters a little and continued smoking. The next day, my mother comes to my room and tells me that my grandma was offended by me yesterday, and that my grandma told her that she can do whatever she wants in her house because it's her house and if I don't like it, I can go live with her (with my mother, who again, lives \~1 hour of driving from everything and is a hoarder).  She prefers smoking to living with her grandson. The next night I didn't ask her anything, just as soon as I heard she woke up and is in the bathroom, I opened the shutters in the balcony, and I think because of that, she closed most ventilation at noon  the same day and smoked. Needless to say, I smelt everything in my room. Since then, the mild chest pain came back and my cough had only gotten worse.

As a result, I started to look for student housing near the university (and grants I might get accepted for- will take a few weeks/months) I plan on going to and it's pretty expensive, especially housing with no roomates (\~615$ monthly- rough conversion from ils) considering my current budget of \~743$ per month (rough conversion from ils), and I will start my degree (assuming I will get accepted, I still don't have all my final grades- I'm eagerly waiting to get all of them back) on October, so I will have to suffer at least 3 more months of second hand smoke.

So what would you suggest I do? I know I need to move out asap. My options currently are either staying with my grandma, staying with my mom (again, lives \~1 hour of driving away from everything and is a hoarder), trying to rent an apartment somewhere near (likely pretty expensive), or some other option I can't see currently. (I don't have any friends or other family who I can live with, either because they smoke too- especially family or because they don't have a spare room)",1,1752010252.0,Advice,0,1.0,False

I’ve been in a relationship for about a year. She’s kind, emotional, deeply in love with me.
I’ve given a lot — emotionally, mentally. Even when I was tired. Even when I was unsure.

But the relationship wasn’t always stable. There were times she did things that deeply hurt me.
One of the hardest moments was when she went to a party with guys, ended up getting drunk, and told me later that they touched her.
She says she didn’t want it, that it wasn’t her fault.
And maybe it wasn’t. But it broke something in me. I never truly healed from that, even though I tried.

Since then, I’ve felt disconnected — like I’ve been emotionally pulling away.
Not to punish her. But because something inside me just shut down.

Now she’s trying really hard — saying she’ll wait, that she understands, that she’s ready to change.
But I’m not sure I can go back to how I used to feel.

I don’t want to blame everything on her. This isn’t about revenge. I know I’ve changed too. I’ve grown colder, distant.
But the mix of emotional hurt and the fact that we’re still young and immature — it feels like it’s too much for this relationship to carry.

We’re meeting for coffee soon. We both kind of know this might be the end.
And it kills me — because I still respect her, and part of me will always care.

I’d seen it recommended a bunch online, so I figured I’d give it a go even though it’s more expensive than others.

My main use has been for streaming and a bit of privacy on public Wi-Fi when I’m working from coffee shops. Setup was really quick. The app looks clean, and I liked how you don’t need to mess with a bunch of settings to get started. I mostly just hit the power button and let it choose the fastest server nearby.

Streaming-wise, it's been solid. Netflix US, Hulu, and even Disney+ worked for me almost every time. Only once or twice did I have to switch servers when something got blocked. Speeds have been fast enough for HD streaming with no buffering. I even used it while traveling in Europe to access some sites from home, and it worked better than expected.

Now for the stuff I didn’t like, sometimes the app on my Android phone takes a while to connect, especially when switching networks. Also, it doesn’t always reconnect automatically after dropping. It’s not a huge deal, just a bit annoying. Another thing is the price. It’s definitely more expensive than some other options, so I’m still debating whether I’ll renew when the time comes.",1,1752010071.0,VPN_Reviewer,0,1.0,False

I just wanted to share my journey in case it helps someone going through something similar. It’s been a hell of a ride. At one point I genuinely thought I was dying.

It started off with mild stomach pain after meals, acid reflux, and that constant feeling of fullness. I brushed it off at first, thinking it was temporary. But things escalated quickly. I couldn’t eat properly anymore – everything seemed to hurt. I switched to light foods, but nothing helped.

I went to my GP, who prescribed Pantoprazole and told me to take it once daily for 2 weeks. It matched my symptoms, so I followed the plan. But it only got worse. I lost the ability to eat solid foods entirely. I began experiencing crippling stomach cramps – the kind that make you curl up in bed and cry. I couldn't walk. I could barely stand. I lived off water and vegetable broth. Every attempt at a real meal made me feel like I was about to die.

One day, the pain was so unbearable I called an ambulance. At the hospital, they gave me IV Pantoprazole, antacids, and lots of painkillers. The pain subsided a bit, but the bloating and discomfort remained. Something inside me told me I wasn’t really getting better.

After a few tests, including an endoscopy, they diagnosed me with Type C Gastritis (chemical-induced gastritis). I was shocked. I don’t smoke, I rarely drink, I eat fairly clean, and I don’t even take NSAIDs. But they also found a gallstone. As expected, the first advice was immediate surgery – which I declined. I wanted answers first.

After a week in the hospital, I was discharged. But the pain persisted. Even high doses of Pantoprazole didn’t help. The cramps started creeping back in, and I was losing my ability to function again. I had lost 20 kg in just 2 months.

Desperate, I sought a second opinion from a local gastroenterologist. He took my case seriously and dug deeper. He said my inflammation didn’t even look that severe – so why was I suffering so much?

Together, we uncovered the likely causes:

I drank black coffee every morning on an empty stomach.

I was taking Accutane (Isotretinoin) for acne for over 2 years – often on an empty stomach or after only a small breakfast.

I did OMAD and intermittent fasting, often bingeing on huge meals in the evening.

I turned out to have a sensitivity to Pantoprazole, which affects 1 in 100 people (not rare in medical terms). It was likely the source of my extreme cramping.

How I healed:

Step 1: Medication switch.
Pantoprazole was replaced with Esomeprazole, and the improvement was immediate. The cramps stopped. I could eat again. I felt like I was returning to life.

But that alone wasn’t enough. I researched everything about healing the stomach lining. I built myself a strict set of rules:

No red meat
No processed food
No sugar
No gluten
Only water and calming teas (like chamomile, fennel)
No spicy or irritating foods
Absolutely no alcohol for 6 months
Only organic food

Within days, I felt better. But then I made the classic mistake. After a few weeks of feeling “normal,” I thought I was healed and stopped following the diet. I paid the price. My symptoms came back hard. It was a wake-up call.

So I went back on the plan. Strictly. For 4 months.

The result:

I’m now functionally healed. I eat and drink whatever I want – within reason. My doctor warned me: once you’ve had this, you’re always vulnerable. You have to stay mindful.

A night out with friends and a few drinks? Sure.
Alcohol every weekend, careless eating, no rhythm? No way. That life is gone – and honestly, it probably should be for everyone.

My advice if you're struggling:

Check your medications – even the ones you think are harmless.

Don’t underestimate coffee, Accutane, fasting, or stress.

Stick to your healing diet for several months – not weeks.

Be kind to yourself.

Healing isn’t just about pills. It’s about behavior, discipline, and self-awareness.


You can get your life back. But you have to fight for it – and keep fighting, even when it feels better.

If you’re going through this, I see you. You’re not alone.

Every morning, she gets up first even on Sundays. She makes coffee like it’s a ritual, pours it in that chipped mug she refuses to throw away, and always leaves mine next to the window. I don’t know why she does that, but it’s always there warm, waiting, like her love.

Some days, I get up and join her. Some days, I pretend to sleep so I don’t have to talk.

Not because I don’t love her. I do. Desperately.
But because there’s this… thing. Sitting between us.
And I put it there.

We talk about everything or at least we used to. She tells me about her team, her manager who micro-manages everything, her colleague who cries during lunch breaks. She tells me about her plants, her Pinterest board, her mom’s passive-aggressive texts.

I nod. I laugh. I hold her when she cries.

But I haven’t really spoken to her in months.

I lie beside her every night, feeling like I’m made of glass. Transparent, but fragile.
She traces circles on my back sometimes, like she’s trying to soothe something she doesn’t understand.
And I let her. Because if I speak, I’ll shatter.

We’ve fought twice this year. Real fights.
Not about dishes or laundry. But about presence.
She said, “You’re here, but you’re not here.”
And she’s right. God, she’s so right.

Because every time she holds my hand, my mind is somewhere else.
Not with another woman. Not with some escape fantasy.

Just… somewhere deeper. Quieter. Lonelier.

A place inside me that she doesn’t know exists. A room I’ve locked, even from myself.

It’s strange, really how you can love someone so much and still lie to them every single day.

And it is a lie.
Because love without honesty is just performance.

She thinks I’m tired. Burnt out. That I just need a break from work, or people, or the world.
But it’s not that.

The truth is, I’ve been carrying something I haven’t had the courage to say out loud.

Something that feels both stupid and sacred.

I have ideas.

A lot of them.

They come to me in the shower, in traffic, while brushing my teeth.
They come quietly, like visitors I’m too afraid to let in.

Not world-changing, billion-dollar ideas. Just… fragments. Glimmers.

And I haven’t told her.
Because the moment I do, it becomes real.
And if it’s real, I have to face it. Build it. Or fail at it.
And failure feels like a betrayal to her, to myself, to the life we’re building.

So here it is:
I have something I want to build.
Something I’ve been too scared to say out loud.
But I’m saying it now.

To myself.
To her, someday soon.
And to the world, quietly.

He's constantly losing stuff so half the times that I want to turn on the TV I can't because the remote has vanished again.

I used to joke that I was his secretary because I kept track of everything going on in his life and he never knew anything beyond the next 10 minutes (if that) but I can't joke about it anymore because it makes me so irrationally angry that I know his work schedule better than he does (if he even sends it to me after days of asking for it because he always forgets if he doesn't do it right that second).

Things like him never putting the milk in the correct spot in the fridge and his soap being in a different place every time I get in the shower I can live with but there's just so much that feels impossible.

INT. COUNTRY CLUB KITCHEN – PALM SPRINGS – 7:45 AM – SUMMER

A sea of white tiles. Stainless steel. Soulless silence. Except the hum of a broken Alto-Shaam, wheezing like a dying man.

CHEF LUCIEN “LUCE” SERRANO (late 40s, salt-and-pepper hair, sleeves rolled high, tattoos faded like old scars) stands over a flattop, plating eggs benedict with machine-like precision.

He wipes the rim, steps back, sighs. Looks like he just killed a part of himself.

LINE COOK (O.S.)
Table 24 says the hollandaise is too yellow.

Luce doesn’t even look up.

LUCE
Tell ‘em the sun’s yellow too. Want me to change that?

The cook shrugs and walks away.

A WAITER delivers the plate to an overweight MAN IN SUNGLASSES and a Bluetooth earpiece.

INT. COUNTRY CLUB KITCHEN – BACK PREP – 8:00 AM

Luce lights a cigarette. Under the hood. Doesn’t care anymore.

A young pastry assistant walks by — JAMAL, maybe 22, wide-eyed.

JAMAL
Chef, I read online you had three stars in Lyon. That true?

LUCE
Nope. I stole them off a Christmas tree in France.

Beat.

LUCE (cont’d)
Get back to your pâte à choux before you overwhip the damn thing.

INT. COUNTRY CLUB LOCKER ROOM – 11:15 AM

Luce tosses his chef coat into a locker. Worn. Tired. Defeated.

He grabs a cheap bottle of aftershave. Pauses. Then tosses that too.

⸻

EXT. COUNTRY CLUB PARKING LOT – 11:30 AM

Luce exits into the blistering Palm Springs heat. Desert silence. Walks to a dented ’97 Volvo.

On the windshield: an envelope. No name.

Luce opens it.

INSIDE:
A single black card invitation. Gold embossed.

“CONVOCATION GASTRONOMIQUE – INTERNATIONAL — FINAL SELECTION”

“We don’t invite amateurs. We recall legends.”

Location: TBA. Date: Four Weeks. Bring Your Team. Bring Your Fire.

He stares at it like it’s a ghost.

Behind him, a voice. Female. Familiar. Lethal.

REINA (O.S.)
I figured you’d throw it out. Or set it on fire.

LUCE
Still thinking about it.

REINA CRUZ (mid-40s, sharp eyes, even sharper wit, chef whites crisp despite the heat) steps into view.

REINA
I said I’d never compete again.
Beat.
But they called me. Said they want the old Reina Cruz.

She dead?

REINA
Maybe. But her knife’s still sharp.

Luce looks at her. Really looks.

No.

	•	Koji plating foie torchon on a bed of ash with tweezers.
	•	Tiff piping chiboust like she’s tagging graffiti.
	•	Luce standing in front of a whiteboard, drawing a masterplan like Gordon Ramsay meets Brad Pitt in Moneyball.
	•	Reina plating one perfect scallop, slow-motion close-up as chive oil hits the plate like a signature.

1. KOJI & KIRA NAKAMURA – Tupelo, Mississippi
	•	Setting: A crumbling back-alley fish market and butcher shop tucked behind a Vietnamese nail salon.
	•	Style: Southern gothic meets precision Japanese technique.
	•	Living Quarters: They sleep in a cold room they converted into a dojo/kitchen hybrid.
	•	Update: Kira sharpens her Sujihiki with a whetstone soaked in sweet tea. Koji teaches silent knife classes at the local community center. Their neighbors think they’re ghosts.

	•	Setting: A smoky, high-altitude ranch BBQ joint that doubles as a bait-and-tackle shop.
	•	Style: Black cowboy pitmaster with outlaw hands and holy brisket.
	•	Living Quarters: An old Airstream trailer behind the smoker, surrounded by elk skulls and woodpiles.
	•	Update: Smokey teaches the “Art of Fire” to lonely chefs and lonely souls — takes payment in bourbon, not cash. Rumor has it he once catered a wedding in a blizzard using only firewood, salt, and a blowtorch.

	•	Setting: A high-end, Michelin-starred patisserie inside a luxury hotel on Michigan Ave.
	•	Style: Modernist pastry, brutalist kitchen hierarchy, edible art for CEOs and celebrities.
	•	Role: Executive Sous Chef, Pastry Division — but she hates the “pastry princess” expectations.
	•	Modifications:
	•	Uses agar-agar like a sculptor uses clay.
	•	Reverse-engineers croissants to hold nitrogen crème.
	•	Created a savory éclaire that exploded on TikTok — hates that it made her famous.
	•	Designs desserts to resemble abstract architecture — like Zaha Hadid meets crème brûlée.
	•	Living Quarters: A sterile condo she never decorates. Lives out of her knife roll and espresso machine.
	•	Update: She’s been itching to quit for months — but doesn’t know what she’d become without the chaos. She’s the type to cry once a year, then candy the tears into a bonbon.

4. LUCE & REINA – Palm Springs, California
	•	Base camp for the operation.
	•	Luce still head-cheffing brunches for golf dads while hiding caviar in omelets.

	•	Their goal: Reignite fire, gather the crew, and go global.

🍳 Chef Lucien “Luce” Serrano
	•	Location: Desert Palms Country Club, Palm Springs
	•	Position: Executive Chef
	•	Reputation: Used to have 3 Michelin stars in Lyon. After a scandal (fire? bad review? betrayal?), he fled to the desert.
	•	Current Reality:
	•	Oversees golf course brunches and corporate weddings.
	•	Fakes enthusiasm during omelet stations.
	•	Refers to hollandaise as “culinary duct tape.”
	•	Passive-aggressively re-labels Sysco aioli as “artisanal emulsified garlic.”

🍔 Chef Reina Cruz
	•	Location: TGI Friday’s, Times Square, NYC
	•	Position: Corporate Trainer & “Kitchen Manager of the Month”

	•	Current Reality:
	•	Calls out “microwave ready” apps with fake energy: “Let’s fire those loaded potato skins, team!”
	•	Wears the required 17 pieces of flair with aggressive irony.
	•	Kids on staff think “chef” is just short for “shift leader.”
	•	Occasionally carves a whole duck in the walk-in just to feel something.
	•	What haunts her: She never proved her innocence. And she never fought back.
	•	Secret: She’s still writing new dishes… in a weathered leather notebook, hidden behind the shelf of frozen Jack Daniel’s ribs.

🎬 Mini-Scene: Reina’s Burnout Boils Over

INT. TGI FRIDAY’S – BACK KITCHEN – FRIDAY NIGHT

Fryers pop. Ticket printer screams. A teenager is asking if the “Jack Sauce” is real Jack Daniels.

REINA is plating a dessert with surgical precision — chocolate lava cake garnished with a quenelle of whipped cream shaped like a perfect spiral.

The line cook beside her drops a tray of frozen wings.

LINE COOK
Aye Chef, that’s overkill. It’s just lava cake.

REINA
That’s not lava cake. That’s a last f*cking breath.

She stares at the plate. Then the floor. Then the door.

Her phone buzzes.

A message from Luce:

“I know where we can bleed for something again. You in?”

Reina rips off her apron. Pulls a knife roll from under the expo line — dusty but packed.

REINA (to host):
I’m going on break.

A private jet coasts in under the blistering desert sun.
Biggie’s unmistakable voice drops in:

🎵 “I’m going going… back back… to Cali Cali…”

SMASH CUT TO:

TIFF WATTS steps off the plane — sleek trench coat, blacked-out sunglasses, pastry knife tucked in her carry-on like contraband. A custom croissant pendant swings from her neck.

She exhales slowly, eyeing the mountains like a threat.

EXT. GREYHOUND BUS STATION – MOMENTS LATER

Dust kicks up around a rusted greyhound bus. The doors hiss open.

SMOKEY JENKINS steps out in cowboy boots, holding a barbecue spatula like it’s Excalibur. His duffel smells like mesquite and vengeance.

He tips his hat to a confused tourist. Biggie thumps on:

🎵 “If I got to choose a coast, I got to choose the East…”

EXT. PALM SPRINGS MALL PARKING LOT – CONTINUOUS

KOJI & KIRA NAKAMURA pull up in an old, stolen-looking black Toyota Hilux. Mississippi plates. They step out like ghosts. Koji carries a bento box. Kira carries her Sujihiki blade in a violin case.

They don’t speak.
They don’t smile.
They just walk… toward war.

EXT. LUCE’S AIRBNB – DESERT EDGE – SUNRISE

An old Spanish-style ranch house. Pool half-drained. Kitchen gutted. Sandbags by the doors like it’s Fallujah. Perfect.

Luce stands shirtless at the grill, cooking a duck breast.
Flipping it without tongs.
Smoking a cigarette with one hand. Seasoning with the other.
Watching the sunrise like it owes him money.

Then: footsteps.

One by one, they appear — the crew. Each one slower than the last.

TIFF. SMOKEY. KOJI. KIRA.
Reina walks in last, dragging a roller suitcase with knives clinking inside.

THE GATHERING”

INT. LUCE’S AIRBNB – LIVING ROOM – JUST AFTER SUNRISE

The crew’s seated — half-awake, half-wary. Blades unrolled on tables. Coffee brewing.
The place smells like burnt duck, bourbon, and unfinished dreams.

Chef Luce steps forward, cigarette dangling from his lip, eyes scanning the crew.
He grabs a half-empty bottle of mezcal off the table, doesn’t drink it.
Just holds it — like a mic.

LUCE
So today…
I’m flipping f*cking omelets at the country club, right?

Some 16-year-old commis server — name tag said “Tanner,” naturally —
walks up and tells me, “Chef… the members say the hollandaise is too yellow.”

Too yellow.

What the hell does that even mean?
Like I’m supposed to color-correct egg yolks with an Instagram filter?

So I look at this kid.
I step outside. Light a cigarette. And while I’m doom-scrolling through the digital abyss of my failure…

— I see it. The Bocuse d’Or.
That invite.

That little black-and-gold reminder that once upon a time —
we cooked with the gods.

And we didn’t just cook. We made art. We made war. We made legends.

I started thinking…

We’ve worked together in different kitchens, different states, different versions of ourselves.
Some of you were sous chefs. Some of you were line rats.
Some of you scared the sh*t out of me.

But I’ve seen every one of you plate something that stopped time.
And I trust your hands. I trust your fire.

And this?
This is our shot.
To burn that yellow-ass hollandaise world to the ground and build something better.
To plate something so f*cking pure it reminds the judges —
and ourselves —
who we are.

So if you’re here for TikTok fame, or trophies, or to sell sous vide machines on Amazon…
there’s the door.

But if you’re here to go to war with me —
to bleed in prep, fight in service, and maybe… maybe… walk out as chefs again —

Then sharpen your knives.

Because this time,
we finish what we started",1,1752009407.0,kitchenstories,0,1.0,False

My concerns (heavy yapping) are below the itinerary.

I'd like to hear any thoughts and suggestions for places to add/remove or the choices of places to eat. I struggled a lot while trying to decide *when* to go somewhere because the locations are messing with my head. 

For example, we will arrive at 8 in the morning on day 1, and while myeongdong shopping street is closer to our stay I've heard people say Namsangol Hanok Village is better in the mornings but is the detour worth it? I've heard so many things about Myeongdong I'm not even sure if we should spend a lot of time there... 

Another example is that everyone seems to end the historical days with Cheonggyecheon Stream and Gwangjang Market but is it smarter for us to do it on a seperate day since it's close? But also if we just eat dinner at the end of day 3 will we have too much time to spare? Is it a day wasted?

And lastly, day 4 is so empty I need suggestions! We already have a day 5 that will consist of hiking so I haven't included it in here and we are no interested in DMZ or Nami island so I have no clue what to do!

  
As you guys might've noticed I'm a bit of an overthinker and I just want to see as much places as I can while eating yummy food lol. Help and insight would be VERY appreciated.",2,1752009355.0,koreatravel,2,1.0,False

I live in Europe and my mother has come to visit a few times from our home country. The first was for my wedding, second when my baby was born and third time just recently, and she’s always almost demanding we take her on imposible one day trips that are at least an 8hr train ride, when she can barely walk and is always complaining about her health. We don’t have a car and my baby is barely 2 and she’s never asked about her grandchild’s nap or eating schedule. It’s all about going to places, wanting to stay all day out, when my baby gets bored being in the stroller, as soon as I put her out start running and means I have to chase after her, while my mother stays ten minutes admiring a pair of shoes that she makes me ask for the sizes available and the prices and ends up buying shit. 

Before my baby was born, I’d take her to most of the places she wanted to go, even making me miserable but I felt it was kinda like an invisible agreement where she’s coming to visit so you must show around. But my baby is my priority now and she doesn’t seem to get that and we end up arguing.


I have doubted a few times if maybe I’m being too hard on her, but I’m exhausted and frustrated. I’ve taken her shopping so far and made arrangements for child care one day to focus only on her, and one day we didn’t go out because it rained the whole day, swimming pool was closed and then boom!! “I can’t stand being home too long” she said and left the house for a whole day on her own. 

When my baby was born, she took it upon herself to invite a friend of mine to stay with us, just so she could have someone to take her to places where I have said I couldn’t because my baby was too young, so she literally brought more work for me, she was difficult with my friend and even blocked her from FB and now that friendship is weird. It really hurts that she’s not paid attention to my baby or even to me the way I see other mothers interact with their children and grandchildren. She brings many gifts and is always offering material things so I feel a bit uncomfortable. The first time she visited me, before I even got married, I was frustrated with all her demands  when I asked her when we were going to sit and chat  to chat up, she literally said “you think I came all the way here for a coffee?” Which was hurtful.


I understand how hard it is to buy tickets to Europe when you’re coming from where I’m coming from, and I’ve tried to make my part. This has caused a few arguments with my spouse too and I’m putting so many things in the balance, I no longer recognize where’s the line in things. 

So, given my circumstances, or in more normal circumstances, where does that obligation end? Or is there even an obligation other than the delight of calmly deciding over a coffee or beer what places to visit while catching up?

I’ve done therapy since the 80s with 15-20 different therapists in individual and group settings. If you’re not getting what you want out of it, there’s a reason.

What’s your homework this week? No homework? She (or he, shout out to Dan) may have given up. And a therapist doesn’t always want to burden someone in a bad state with more work and feelings of guilt for not doing it. I think it’s potentially a disservice.

It’s how things change. There are 168 hours in the week and therapy is (less than) one. What else are you doing?

As someone with depression, my view has always been dark. If there’s an event coming, I’m pretty sure it’ll suck (for me). It takes real work to start to include the possibility that it might be mediocre.

Doing your homework changes your brain tissue. After a year of successful therapy, your brain will look different under a microscope. It’s called neuroplasticity. People think of it as a software problem but it’s really hardware. Our hardware is our software. It’s closer to firmware, like an EEPROM which has programming but can be updated.

My brain had a superhighway straight to depression-ville. I was talking to my therapist Patty about it, who did trauma work after Sandy Hook, and it felt like carving a new path through the woods. Every time you do the homework you’re walking that path, smoothing and widening it.

Three months of daily homework is enough to change things for the better and it doesn’t go away with a bad mood or a bad day. It’s physical brain tissue and you can rely on it. I cant tell if it took longer than i expected or a lot less.

Think of them as push-ups and you can do it in a pile of blankies and pillows. I did some of that, along with sitting alone in the garage month after year plowing through it with a coffee a smoke and a smoke, one of which was prescribed for PTSD.",2,1752009208.0,depression,2,1.0,False

Hey there! I’m a 30-year-old creative in marketing with a dry sense of humor, an adventurous streak, and a knack for turning everyday moments into something worth remembering. I use a wheelchair for longer distances—but that’s just one part of the story. I’m independent, curious, and always up for something fun, meaningful, or wonderfully weird.



Perks of Dating Me:


	•	VIP Parking – Front-row access to life, baby.
	•	Skip the Line – Theme parks, concerts, events… we don’t do “waiting.”
	•	Endless Laughs – Wild injury stories that sound fake (but aren’t).
	•	Unexpected Wins – Free upgrades, kind strangers, and the occasional surprise dessert.
	•	Zombie Apocalypse Strategy – I may not outrun them, but I’m clever, calm under pressure, and hard to miss. That’s teamwork.
	•	You’ll Stand Out – Let’s be real—“normie” couples are overrated.
	•	Built-In Armrest – My chair’s side guards are cozy. You’re welcome.
	•	Strong Hands, Strong Heart – Years of pushing wheels and opening up emotionally.
	•	Creative Problem-Solving – I’m basically a MacGyver with wheels.
	•	Zero Time for Superficial BS – Life’s short. I keep it real and intentional.



A Bit More About Me


I’m all about storytelling—whether it’s through books, music, movies, games, or late-night conversations. I love collecting weird trivia, exploring overlooked places, and getting lost in good ideas.

I stay active in my own way: home workouts, nature walks, and traveling whenever I can. I’ve explored the U.S., Canada, Mexico, Colombia, and the Bahamas—and there’s still plenty more I’d love to experience. (Bonus: I speak Spanish, too!)

I’m the kind of person who notices the little things—your favorite song, how you take your coffee, the way you light up when you talk about something you love. I care deeply, listen closely, and show up consistently. Whether it’s building a playlist, discovering a local gallery, or just sharing quiet time, I value connection that feels grounded and genuine.

⸻

What I’m Looking For:

I’m drawn to people who are:

	•	Playful, grounded, and emotionally present
	•	Down to laugh, explore, and be real together
	•	Into thoughtful conversations and spontaneous fun
	•	Comfortable being fully, unapologetically themselves

I’m open to friendship, flirtation, or something more—whatever feels right. Long-distance, age gaps, different backgrounds—all are welcome. I’m attracted to all body types—connection and energy mean more to me than any one look.

Whatever we build, I just want it to feel real and mutual.



Why You Should Message Me:

If you’re looking for someone thoughtful, creative, and emotionally grounded—someone who values kindness, depth, and shared experiences—I’d genuinely love to hear from you.

No pressure. No expectations. Just an open door and a bit of curiosity.

If something here speaks to you, don’t be shy. Say hello, tell me something about you, and let’s see where the conversation takes us.



Let’s Make Memories:

Big trips, quiet nights, deep talks, shared playlists—I think the best connections are built on a little of everything. Whether you’re looking for something serious or just someone to connect with in an honest, easy way, you’re welcome here.

**Summary**

The charwoman Matilda Stoss was hungover from the night before. Bob Lohkamp pours some rum, and she drinks it. It's Lohkamp’s 30th birthday. He had enlisted at age 18 in 1916. In 1917, friends died of bullets, shells, and gas. 1918 saw him in the hospital with Josef Stoll who lost both legs. It was little improved after the war: a [putsch](https://share.google/GlvCafOLNdR9dZew5) in 1920, his mother had cancer, [inflation,](https://share.google/sZsAbiGTwz4nl61W9) and working various jobs. Now he works for his friend Otto Köster along with Gottfried Lenz. 

Lenz barges in and gives him an amulet from South America. Köster gives him six bottles of rum. Koster had built his own roadster he named Karl. Other drivers underestimate him. Everyone who tries to race him is vanquished. They take Karl for a spin. A fellow named Binding lost to them. He stopped at the hotel to study the car. A woman gets out of the passenger side and talks to them. Karl can go 189 km/hr (117 mph).

Binding and Lenz bond by singing war songs. Lohkamp wonders if he's ok to drive. The woman says he drives better when he's buzzed. He asks for her number to check on her safety. The three comrades race to another bar.

The next morning, Lohkamp makes his own coffee in his room in a boarding house. A graveyard is beside the house, so at least it's partly quiet all the time. Beside it was an amusement park. He cleans out his pockets and finds the number. Her name is Patricia Hollmann, but he won't call her just yet. 

His neighbor Hasse gets in a fight with his wife every Sunday then visits Lohkamp. He was always worried he'd lose his job. Other people at the office have already been laid off. Lohkamp pours him a drink and leaves him to it. He passes by other tenants beset by hard times. Georg Block used to work in a mine and attend college but now can't find any work. He will stick with college. 

Lohkamp used to work as a pianist at the Cafe International. He has some rum today and talks to Rosa who is a prostitute. She shows him a doll she got for her daughter who had to be put into care. She mentions something about Friday night, and Lohkamp goes along with it. 

At the auto shop, Köster is working on a Cadillac to maybe resell it. Lenz is at a political meeting. Lohkamp turns down seeing a boxing match and goes back to the boarding house. He calls Patricia and arranges to meet in two days. He attends the fight after all. His room is too shabby for a girl like Patricia. 

The Cadillac is all repaired. Lenz wrote up an ad extolling the virtues and luxury of the car. Who can afford a car like that in this economy? Their apprentice Jupp isn't impressed. Inspector Barsig works for a car insurance company and gives them repair work. The guys found him rare butterflies and moths for his collection too. One client finagles a new hood out of them along with cleaning the bloodstains out of the seat. 

The place where Patricia arranged to meet was a tea room which made Bob uncomfortable. A party of four takes over his table, including a female athlete who judges him drinking cognac. No reservations are allowed. Patricia came through another door and said hello. Bob suggests they go to a bar he knows. First he must pay for the three cognacs he drank. The others at the table are so judgy.

A war buddy named Valentin is a regular at the bar. His memory is too good, so he drinks all the time to celebrate being alive. Patricia orders a dry martini. He has rum. Bob has no earthly idea what to say to her. Valentin sends him a drink for the memory of July 1917. Bob thinks she is too young to have any troubles. Why yes she certainly can. 

He gets more comfortable as he drinks more. Gone is the worry of what to talk about. He walks her outside but forgot what he even said. He bumped into a man and insulted him. Back to the bar for more. 

Matilda Stoss informs them that the plum tree blossomed. They had used the tree to hang clothes and other things. It was taken for granted. Jupp gives away a spray of them with every petrol purchase. Köster asks about Pat and if he still has her number. Bob lies and says no. That's too bad because she was a beauty. The more he talks, the worse Lohkamp feels about it. 

At the Cafe, Rosa held a farewell party for Lilly. She was getting married after saving up money from being a “hotel woman,” a higher class prostitute. Bob played their favorite songs on piano. 

Otto Köster entered Karl in a big race. They ate supper and worked on the car some more. Bob refuses a drink and asks Lenz for advice about love. Why do people act like fools? The beloved doesn't notice and actually finds it charming. Just don't be direct about it. He should send her flowers to apologize. Bob wants to drink now. The single headlight of the Ford reminds them of searchlights in the war. 

His neighbor Hasse envies him being single. He thought his life would be different. So didn't Lohkamp after the war. (News flash: it wasn't.) Everyone gets lonely at night. He sent her roses the next day.

The ad for the Cadillac was placed in the paper. They took the car for a test drive on a bad bumpy road to adjust her tires. A man named Blumenthal walks around the car. Lohkamp gave him a whole spiel which didn't impress him. He doesn't respond to any of it. He asks the cost. Too much. Then another man asks about the car. He's well dressed. Blumenthal loses interest, gives Lohkamp a cigar, and leaves. The well dressed man was Lenz posing as another buyer. He thinks Blumenthal will be back as he smokes Lohkamp’s cigar. 

Patricia had tried to call Lohkamp. The maid told her he was usually out every night. Why'd she go and say a thing like that? Ugh. Later on, he waited by the phone. Fraud Bender the widowed tenant had brought home an orphan baby. Lohkamp feels bad for the child who will grow up to another war (this is true and this book was written three years before WWII! And set in 1928). The phone finally rings. The baby cries unbelievably loud. She thanks him for the flowers. They agreed to a date tomorrow night. 


Lenz’s apartment is full of souvenirs from South America. Braumüller is there. He’s a race car driver and in the race. Ferdinand Grau is a painter and is already drunk to celebrate a sale. What sells is portraits of the deceased for bereaved family members. He is cynical about it all. Man is venal and all that. Lohkamp asks to borrow the Cadillac for his date. Lenz thinks he's stupid for being in love. Grau says it's simplicity and a gift. So drink and save yourself.

The customers are pretty nice, mostly old people, but we get families too, with kids of all ages, and I SWEAR, kids below 5 are a nightmare.

Sure, some are well behaved and calm but others I’d wish the parents would just take back home and never come back. For example: table of four, mother, father, kid around 2 I think and grandma. The only one watching the child was the mom, when they tried to sit it in a high chair he started screeching and that poor woman quickly gave up and sat him in her lap, I felt bad for her, the others didn’t help, barely watched her and the kid, who also made a mess of the table and just wouldn’t shut up.

I can’t remember other episodes of annoying kids right now, but my god are they a danger to the public, they scream and run between tables while I’m just trying to bring hot coffee and ice cream in glass cup to the tables, so now I even have to avoid dropping stuff and injuring someone. I also always clean extra well tables where kids have been because I know they made a mess, I can see it, I’ve had to scrub the CHAIRS too.

I recently went on a week long cruise, life has been hectic and the break up on top made everything worse.

I went on a cruise and I was surrounded by couples who had been together for decades, one couple I met had been together for 54 years!

The cruise honestly made me feel worse, made me feel more lonely and sad.

My ex broke up with me because he randomly decided he wanted kids and I didn't. It broke me, I don't love easy and it took everything in me to give him a chance, when I let myself be vulnerable and let myself be happy for the first time in a very long time, it was over.

I tried dating apps but they make me feel anxious, tried putting myself out there but it feels like I'm cheating on him, even though he broke up with me!

After we broke up, I wanted to work it out and he didn't. Said he didn't see us coming to a decision because neither of us would change our minds.

I was scared, I never wanted kids because I never met anyone who I thought would actually be a great father and not abandon them like my dad did... But he was different.

When I got back from the cruise, I stupidly reached out to my ex. I told him I missed him, hope he's well and I want to catch up for coffee, to discuss things. He left me on read.

I feel stupid but I just want to explain my side. It pisses me off though because I still feel sad and emotional and I have no idea if he does, if I even meant anything to him.

I just wish I could find someone that I can go on a cruise with, smile at them as I tell a random stranger that even after 54 years, through good and bad times, I still love them ",1,1752008805.0,BreakUps,0,1.0,False

Hi folks! 👋

I’m a local based in the Wicklow area and looking into starting a small vending machine business around the commuter town I live in. As part of my early research, I’d love to get your thoughts.

I’m planning to trial a machine or two in busy spots like gyms, co-working spaces, apartment blocks, or schools (if allowed)—but before I commit, I want to make sure the products are actually useful to people nearby!

What I’d love your help with:
	•	What types of snacks or drinks do you wish you had easier access to during your day?
	•	Would you prefer healthy options, treats, protein bars, drinks, coffee, tech accessories, or something else?
	•	Are there any local venues (gyms, shops, schools, etc.) that you think would be great locations for a vending machine?
	•	Anything you hate about vending machines I should avoid?

I’m starting small, with a limited budget, but I want to get it right. Your feedback could genuinely shape this little side hustle into something useful for the community.

Thanks a million in advance! 
Happy to share updates as I go if people are interested.

A pictorial guide is included, ensuring that even newcomers can dive right into recreating barista-level brews. 

**Design and Build**  
The first thing that caught my attention was the compact yet robust design. At 3.7 inches in diameter and 2.6 inches in height, the coffee filter has a lightweight feel, only 4.4 ounces, which makes it super portable. Its stainless steel finish not only looks elegant and modern but also ensures durability. Even after frequent use, the material shows no sign of wear or discoloration. The four-piece construction with a gravity insert makes it more convenient to use than the older screw-down filters while keeping the traditional elements intact.

**How It Performs**  
The brewing process, though manual, feels almost meditative. I poured my Trung Nguyen ground coffee into the base, added hot water, and watched it slowly drip into my glass. The gravity insert filter is a standout feature, making the setup less fussy compared to screw-down filters. The slow drip mechanism ensures that the coffee grounds are steeped evenly, leading to a rich, bold flavor every time. However, mastering the right grind size took a bit of trial and error. Medium-coarse grounds seemed to work best for me without over-complicating things.

**Who Would Love This?**  
Anyone who enjoys brewing coffee manually, experimenting with traditional methods, or has an appreciation for Vietnamese coffee culture should give this filter a try. It's great for those who love their coffee strong, sweetened with condensed milk, or simply like iced variations for sultry afternoons. I've even gifted one to a friend who couldn’t stop raving about its simplicity and ease of use.

**Positives**  
- Compact and highly portable for on-the-go brewing.  
- Gravity insert ensures even drip and eliminates the need for adjustments.  
- Durable stainless steel design is both dishwasher safe and resistant to wear.  

**Negatives**  
- Takes a bit of effort to find the ideal coffee grind size.  
- Manual brewing won’t suit people accustomed to one-touch coffee makers.  
- Beginners might find the brewing slightly time-consuming initially.  

**How It Stacks Up to the Competition**  
In comparison to other manual pour-over coffee makers, the portability and unique design of the coffee filter set it apart. While French presses may brew more quantities at once, they don't quite deliver the distinct flavors of Vietnamese coffee. Competitors with glass components might score aesthetic points, but the stainless steel build of this filter makes it unbreakable and long-lasting. For someone like me, who travels frequently, it’s the perfect non-electric coffee maker to carry along.

**Price to Quality Ratio**  
For the quality of materials and the brewing experience it delivers, this coffee filter offers great value. Other manual coffee brewers may come with higher price tags, but the lifetime warranty provided by the manufacturer adds an extra layer of confidence. If you’re looking for an affordable yet premium feel in your coffee brewing equipment, this filter checks all the boxes.

She then started replying rather slowly but after I tried to brush it off she brought it up again and then when I suggested a place she ghosted me.

She just messaged me today again, apologizing and giving a somewhat reasonable excuse for not replying but the fact of the matter is she left me on read for almost a month.

What do y’all think? Google said it’s possible but unlikely that a gray fox would eat that. Has this happened to you? 

I know gray foxes climb, so I don’t know if we should put them on a small platform or have them hanging and water them more often.

Here's my situation: I found out at 9 weeks 4 days that my first pregnancyhad no development after 6 weeks (possible blighted ovum although I had two early ultrasound where one doctor said there was a fetal pole). That was two weeks ago today and I was already spotting so the doctor said I had a good chance of passing with expectant management but could pursue medical or surgical intervention. My bleeding picked up after and I had about a week of medium to heavy bleeding with small clots that then slowed to a stop so I was hopeful my follow up ultrasound would reveal I was done. Unfortunately when I went on Friday (day 10), the ultrasound revealed I hadn't passed the sack though it was collapsed and the doctor recommended I try mife and 36 hours later 4 miso vaginally. She seemed confident this would resolve it and said the only follow up would be a call in two weeks and then I should make sure I'm negative on an at home test at 3 weeks. After I took that mifepristone on Friday I sat down on the toilet and unexpectedly passed a very large dark red clot (the biggest so far) after doing quite a lot of walking. I had a little more red bleeding that night and then took the misoprostol as directed late Saturday and went to bed. I had pretty intense cramps on Sunday and was feeling very tired but didn't bleed. Monday I had some dark brown spotting and some pretty thick dark brown discharge (kinda like coffee grounds) and then today I have had watery light brown discharge mixed with hard dark spots and a slight fever (99/37.5). I called the doctor to ask about the fever and told them about the lack of response to the miso and they said to call back if my fever goes about 100.4/38 and otherwise I just have to wait until my follow up call. I'm so worried I might be developing an infection as it's now been 5 weeks since the baby stopped developing and the thought that I might need to wait another 2 weeks to even get scheduled for a D&C is driving me a bit mad. Any hope in terms of perhaps this still working or a quick turnaround so I can start to put this behind me would be great. ",2,1752007986.0,Miscarriage,3,1.0,False

At first I thought that I was maybe grinding too fine, so I went coarser, but still the same cloudy result. 

From what I’ve found on this subreddit as well as google results, I’ve gathered that it’s the filtration that isn’t thorough enough. 
The methods for improving I’m going to try next time are as follows:

1. Pour the ground coffee through a flour sieve to separate as many fines as possible.
2. Once the ground coffee is in the Toddy filter, shake it so that any fines that fall through it don’t end up in the cold brew
3. Double bag the ground coffee; use two filters instead of one
4. Once the cold brew is ready, pour the finished product through chemex filters

I’ve also seen someone say that cloudy cold brew can be a result of not having enough coffee for the amount of water used? My current ratio is 1:14 coffee to water brewed for 24h. Not sure how true this person’s claim is though. 

Are there any other reasons my cold brew could be coming or cloudy? I would much appreciate the help because my boss wants to get rid of the Toddy and use our 3temp to make ‘cold brew’. Which I would prefer to avoid because I am so attached to the idea that cold brew takes 24h not 0.5h to make. Lol.

I got Koi Pond, Bye Bye Anxiety, Waikiki Beach, Cherry blossom raindrop, toadstool garden and then my freebies were Limon Sorbet and chocolate tiramisu.

Firstly I read the reviews from here and thought I’d give slime fantasies a try. Firstly the scents and the free slimes that I got with my order ( 2 mystery slimes after spending so much)  was pretty nice but I will say I was disappointed with the SIZE of the containers all of my slime came in. The mystery slimes had charms already were mixed with the slime. So that makes me believe that they’ve been used or something. My biggest problem was the longevity of the smell and texture.

The one I was most excited for was Koi Pond and I was very disappointed. I had to add SOOO much lotion to make this not rippy. That changed it so much because it’s supposed to be clear. The gravel fell out everywhere. Cute idea, poor quality. 

Bye Bye Anxiety smelled SOO GOOD but sadly this slimes life was so short. It dried quickly and the smell disappears fast. That was my favorite scent. It was almost addicting. 

Waikiki beach was beautiful and smelled great until after a week. Again the scents don’t last long at all. 

Cherry blossom felt soooo good. It smells good and it is so satisfying to play with. Today it died and I’ve only had it for two weeks. Pretty sad.

Toadstool garden was fun to put together and fun to play with. This is one of the few where the scent doesn’t disappear. It still smells good! I added more activator today because it got sticky but that’s okay. 

My freebies Limon Sorbet was an icee slime and it smells so good and it feels good. It’s very nice !! Smaller than the small slime I had to begin with.

Chocolate tiramisu doesn’t smell good to me because I’m not a fan of the bakery/coffee smell. Never have been but its scent is still there and the crunch was great. It came in a smaller container than the small original bought slime which is expected. 

All in all I think I won’t use them again just because after buying OG slime I wasn’t impressed. My OG slime still has scent and is great for the price. I’m glad I tried something new but overall the scent and texture is what I’m obsessed with and this was a miss.",12,1752007658.0,Slime,4,0.93,False

As stated in the title I am opening Laundromat in central Europe in a mid size city around 300k people. We dont have almost any history of laundromats in our city since most people have washing machines at home. But our city got a lot more international students in recent years as well as a lot of people from Ukraine fleeing from war are staying here and not everyone has washing machines. 

I am buying 6 x 10kg  (22 lb } LG Machine and 2x 15KG ( 33lb) capacity machines. And three dryers. 

Location is shopping center near student dorms and some Airbnb apartments close by as well. 

Initial investment is around 45k euros, rent being 1200e and electricity and water is around 1000e so 2200e monthly. We would also like to add coffee machine and ramen vending machine and WiFi router and some decent sofas an tables so students can study while waiting for the clothes. 

  
My question would be how many cycles per one machine I can expect ? I was hoping at least 5 a day ? Of course it will be less in the beginning but eventually I can maybe get there, 

What is your pricing for the washing cycle ? I saw a lot of different prices on the internet regarding the US.

 I saw a price on one dormitory in our city they have one washing cycle 10kg for 5 euros including washing detergent, does that sound ok ?

1luzoqs,https://www.reddit.com/r/inlaws/comments/1luzoqs/are_husband_and_i_right_to_cut_contact_with_mil/,Are Husband and I right to cut contact with MIL (Husbands mother) ?,"Brace yourselves, this is going to be a long one. I will thank you in advance for taking the time to read , we really need advice! 

We have decided to stop contact with FIL due to extremely inappropriate comments to myself as a new mother and one directed towards my child. So much so that I believe them to be a safeguarding concern and have dealt with it as such. 

This hasn’t been taken very well by MIL despite our best  efforts to compromise and mediate as respectfully and peacefully as we can.  

We continued to allow MIL contact with or child however boundaries continue to be pushed. 

She has tried getting partner involved despite us saying we aren’t comfortable for him to be around our child. Writes love grandad in child’s Easter card and 1st Birthday card, despite no contact being fully established at this point. Thankfully child can’t read! 

Has become cold and dismissive of me. No Hugs goodbye like before and ignoring when I speak yet acknowledging husband. My mother had noticed this behaviour on my child’s 1st birthdayvisit. She’s like this until she wants something and then is polite and happy. 

A family member of my husbands was extremely rude to my mother in front of guests during child’s 1st birthday party. 
My mother was visiting as she lives a few hours away, no reason as to why she received this behaviour.  When confronted it was passed off as a joke. 

It all came to a head when MIL wanted to take our child on his own to where I consider too far to travel without me. I offered a compromise as I politely said I wasn’t comfortable. This was initially ignored. When I reaffirmed this boundary I was left on read and she phoned my husband. 

He reaffirmed the boundary I had set after he initially told her it was ok (we had a conversation about this approach and now on the same page). She explained that she would take him to the park instead (again not something I had agreed to as I didn’t know the phone call had taken place). 

During this same phone call she has said to my husband that I always get what I want. Husband didn’t tell me this as he didn’t want to upset / anger me, didn’t want me to then as a result upset his mum. Understandable as she can be volatile when things don’t go as planned.  She then told other family members of this yet gave a half truth, leaving out the derogatory comment made about myself. 

I message saying that I will meet her at the park and we could go for a coffee. 
She tells me No , she likes to have child on her own but thanks. 

I was flabbergasted by this but again responded once I cleared my head. I set yet another boundary of this isn’t something she gets to decide and that’s up to us as parents.  She then calls upon my husband’s response to the park. Clearly trying to go between us to find a way around it.  
 
Partner then called to set another boundary backing up that we are our child’s parents , we make the decisions etc. Explained that I wanted nothing more to do with her and that was that.  Give us space. 

Not even 72 hrs later I receive a message asking if she could have my child on such a day.  I ignored and blocked from social media. 

She then messaged my partner asking the same question. He reiterated what he had already said prefacing it asking if she had not acknowledged what was said previously. Explained the disrespect and we need space. Only one part of the message was addressed in her response. Not about the space we had requested but saying she didn’t intend to be rude to me and never will. 

Again, husband sent clarification of the space we’ve requested and asked for it to be respected.  “You’ve got it” MIl responded. 

It’s not just the disrespect that’s brought us to this point. It’s the fact FIL has a history of violence (physical assault to husband and criminal damage) and uncomfortable behaviours towards my partner and friends of a similar age as minors (some of which I have recently been told about). Sexual comments towards myself and  a complete disregard for anyone’s feelings as it’s all disguised as a “joke”. 

I believe MIL is complicit  and as a result I feel I can not trust her to be around my child.  She has lost contact with husbands sibling/ their partner and grandchildren due to similar circumstances to ourselves. 

I’ve also had to say that I’m uncomfortable with the consumption of alcohol whilst looking after our child (my father was an alcoholic which I explained). This was again dismissed “it’s only a few buds” .  
I suggested we pick child up earlier so they could enjoy a drink. I have a different tolerance to this than my partner as he was ok for one / two low volumes to be consumed. I again compromised which I probably shouldn’t have. 

She has always requested to have grandchildren on her own and doesn’t want the parents present. This comes across as very odd to me, I wonder if the times she’s had our child alone was opportunity to get FIL involved without our knowledge. 

So are we well within our rights to cut all contact? My gut tells me yes but I would like to gain other perspectives.

I’ll be primarily covering 7 songs but will be mentioning a couple more - songs I will return to in future needle drop posts. 

1. Windmills of Your Mind
2. La Valse a Mille Temps
3. The Wreck of the Edmund Fitzgerald
4. Yesterday When I was Young
5. Good Morning Yesterday
6. Where Do We Go From Here 
7. Who Knows

See if you can guess where we’re headed. 

[Windmills are used to communicate messages](https://preview.redd.it/rpxfgxqfjpbf1.jpg?width=348&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=9e78c05a211fc4b118edf29e1d164ff3b114890c)

Fun fact. A lesser known fact about Windmills and their role in providing coded communication. The Netherlands: The stationary (not currently in use) windmill has long been used to communicate simple messages. A ""+"" sign (3-6-9-12 o'clock), the windmill is in use. An ""x"" configuration, the windmill is closed/out of service. A “tilt” (sorry for the pun) of the the blades so that the upper-most blade is at 1 o’clock means something good like a victory/celebration or safety. A tilt of the blades to 11-2-5-8 o'clock means something bad like someone has died or there is danger. 

**WINDMILLS OF YOU MIND (S2E10)**

This one is rather low hanging fruit. The circular vertiginous nature of time. Hypnotic, the song also evokes a kind of mental looping - and not in a healthy way (perSEVERation). This version s1e10 is a Mel Torme cover (1969). The original version sung by Noel Harrison (1968) and used in the soundtrack to the original The Thomas Crown Affair staring Steve MacQueen and Faye Dunaway. 

[Original Noel Harrison Album Cover looking a bit Severance-ey](https://preview.redd.it/uu5wm194kpbf1.jpg?width=288&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=5f83971cb9f4d50e9ad12427879851cfa399ab35)

My friend u/Mysterious-Monkey-72 posted a great summation of time loops including a brief analysis of [Windmills of your Mind](https://www.reddit.com/r/SeveranceDecoded/comments/1k7bysq/when_time_becomes_a_loop_and_the_end_becomes_the/)

Last, we also can’t ignore poor Mel Torme who did a lovely cover of “Windmill”. He also did “**I’ve Got You Under My Skin**”…. “This feels like a really powerful image to me.” (Helly s1e3)

**LA VALSE A MILLS TEMP (S2E7)**

This lovely song plays s2e7 over montage of Mark and Gemma in their early days of their romance. Written by Jacques Brel (4th album1959) The tempo accelerates rapidly over the course of the song. I have seen several translations but there is some ambiguity because of the preponderance of  puns/homonyms sprinkled throughout the lyrics. Again, evokes the passing of time, the speeding up of time as we grow older, the whirlwind nature of love.

January 1968, the musical review “Jacque Brel is Alive and Well and Living in Paris” opened off broadway. Brel did not participate in the production but he did appear in a cameo in the film version. Eric Blau wrote the English story and lyrics. ***La Valse a Mille Temps*** is one of the last musical numbers in the production but includes not English translated lyrics but all new English lyrics and renamed “***Carousel***”.

Carnivals and cotton candy

Carousels and calliopes

Fortune-tellers in glass cases

We will always remember these

Merry-go-rounds quickly turning

Quickly turning for you and me

And the whole world madly turning

Turning, turning 'till you can't see

We're on a carousel

A crazy carousel

And now we go around

Again we go around

And now we spin around

We're high above the ground

And down again around

And up again around

So high above the ground

We feel we've got to yell

But Wait. There’s more. As Jacques Brel is Alive and Well and Living in Paris also included another Brel song, ***La Chanson de Jacky.*** In which the character imagines he is famous singer or a vastly more glamorous person…like maybe a movie star?…”If I could be for only an hour. Only for one hour every day.” 

***La Chanson de Jacky*** was then covered by British artist Scott Walker (1968) and again by former Soft Cell member Marc Almond (1991). Soft Cell, you’ll remember, was featured heavily in the 1984 German cyber-punk film Decoder. See my post about this very SEVERANCE-EY film [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/SeveranceDecoded/comments/1kug0o2/spoiling_a_50_year_old_severancey_protocyberpunk/)

Also, Scott Walker did a decent job of covering the **Man of La Mancha** power anthem “***Impossible Dream***\*”\* (1969).

Finally, Jacques Brel himself adapted/wrote, directed and performed as Don Quixote in the French production of **Man of La Mancha** [L'Homme de La Mancha)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/L'Homme_de_la_Mancha)which premiered in Paris (1968). He also released a studio album.

**YESTERDAY WHEN I WAS YOUNG (S2E8)**

An excellent Shirley Bassey cover (1970) of this classic torch song appears diegetically (in the characters’ world). It is barely audible on the radio in Hampton’s coffee shop directly after ***Who Knows*** (see below). Themes of regret, wasted youth, lost opportunities, passage of time. The original version this time is French! Originally titled “***Hier Encore***” (Yesterday Today” written and performed by Charles Aznovour (1964)

Shirley Bassey also sang a song called “What About Today” (1970) within which is an interlude to “Yesterday When I was Young”. 

Power vocalist Shirley Bassey also did a version of  **Man of La Mancha’s “Impossible Dream”**

**WRECK OF THE EDMUND FITZGERALD (S2E5)** 

Ok. This one is a long windy road, but a (hopefully\_ fun journey. We start with the ***Wreck of the Edmund Fitzgerald***. Lots of folks have covered the watery underworld imagery of the song. The ship went down together with 29 crew members in 1975. Interestingly, the ship’s Bell (as in Ma Bell) was recovered and restored in 1995. 

AND, Gordon Lightfoot borrowed the melody of the song from a much older Irish rebel song called ***Back Home in Derry*** written by Bobby Sands, an IRA rebel who died (1981) on a hunger strike. 

Twenty years have gone by and I’ve ended my bond,  
My comrades' ghosts walk beside me.  
Well a rebel I came and sure I'll die the same,  
On a cold winter's night you will find me.

— Bobby Sands

Sands died of a this hunger strike while imprisoned at **HM Prison Maze**.  (known as “The Maze” or “H-Block”). 

“The Maze” evokes a research lab…and the aerial view of the HM Prison Maze itself echos the Murray Hill, NJ Bell Labs location which was built prior to the Holmdel Complex.

Gordon Lightfoot produced a song and Album called ***Don Quixote***. Also on this album is a song about a Blue Whale called **Big Blue** (shout out u/Mysterious-Monkey-72 for this excellent post on why certain characters might also be [aquatic creatures](https://www.reddit.com/r/SeveranceDecoded/comments/1la2g4i/severance_goes_deep/)

Final point on **Don Quixote & Man of La Mancha, there is a 1957 Soviet Russian film version**. All things Russian being another recurring theme inside the world of Severance. 

**WHERE DO WE GO FROM HERE (S2E8)**

Delightfully growling song (2013) from Charles Bradley. The song shares its title with the 1967 human rights masterpiece from Martin Luther King. On the topic of human rights, slavery in America, oppression and uprising, stay tuned for a future needle drop post. In the meantime, the title is ALSO shared by a 1971 anthology published by science fiction virtuoso, Isaac Asimov. Most of the short stories are written by others, including The Train Called Mobius by A.J. Deutsch. It is a story about a subway train that goes missing within the closed “loop” of Boston’s MBTA, or the “T. It is determined that the train and all its passengers have punched through to another dimension. 

[The Cover looks an awful lot like Mark's Crystal Head Cube](https://preview.redd.it/1fr90487mpbf1.jpg?width=288&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=eea4edf9bb59db88e2044f4ec00ca0a9c9db43e8)

The Train’s name is a reference to Mobius Loops, or Mobius Strips - which are a “nonorientable surface which means when traveling along a  [Mobius Loop](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Möbius_strip) one can no longer determine if they are traveling clockwise or counterclockwise because they are traveling I both directions.

**WHO KNOWS (S2E8)**

The last song for today is “Who Knows What Tomorrow Will Bring (1971) by Marion Black. 

“You never know when an old calendar might come in handy. Sure, **it’s not 1985 right now, but who knows what tomorrow will bring**?” Homer Simpson S5E17

There are a couple additional songs referencing this wheel of time theme. ***I’ll Be Seeing You*** references a “children’s carousel” but carousels are not the main theme. I will be covering this song again in a future post. Finally ***Eminence Front*** by the Who references time as a circle or a wheel of time.  See my previous Needle Drop Post [here. ](https://www.reddit.com/r/SeveranceDecoded/comments/1kmn1wl/severance_needle_drops_a_cypher_gift_for_genx)",4,1752006654.0,SeveranceDecoded,2,0.84,False

I’ve had celiac now for over four years, but I haven’t been able to get my antibody blood tests back to a normal/acceptable range. I was diagnosed during COVID and then moved away for grad school. While I never cheated, I definitely wasn’t as vigilant in the beginning because of the chaos of life and also wanting to be like a normal young woman enjoying life. When I moved back home and started a salary job, my doctor and I agreed I would start a serious effort to get my antibody levels down into remission. It’s been a year and I’m still at 33 units when you want to be under 20. 

I have learned a lot in my last year. I got all of my own pots, pans, spatulas, cutting board, and colander from my roommate (who would eat gluten, but in the last four months, cut out gluten to try to help me). I make all my coffee at home and prep all of my food here. I’ve switched my shampoo, sunscreen, lipsticks, toothpaste everything to be GF. And if it doesn’t have a GF label, I make sure the website says they don’t use gluten ingredients. I have my own personal air fryer that has never had gluten inside it. I even have my own drying mat and sponge (even though my roommate gave up gluten). But I was shocked to see my last test result hadn’t changed. I’ve had the same blood test for the last six months and it makes me incredibly sad and anxious. 

I do sometimes go out to eat, but either to dedicated GF restaurants or restaurants where there are only 1-2 glutenous dishes and the staff are reported by many celiac on Find Me Gluten to be safe. 

I feel like I’ve tried my best to eliminate gluten but I’m afraid I haven’t done enough. My doctor has brought up the idea of putting me on steroids if I have refractory celiac. I really appreciate any advise or help on sources of gluten you never considered. Do you only eat certified GF labels as opposed to regular GF? My roommate and I use the same cutting knives (always put through the dishwasher and it just goes in a protective knife cover in a pot). Should I get new knives? I really appreciate help with anything. 

I should mention I have asymptomatic celiac so I can’t trust my body to give me signals when I’ve gotten gluten. It seems my body only reacts when it’s a big dose—nothing for the small amounts of gluten that I must be getting. ",3,1752006460.0,Celiac,12,1.0,False

But I've gradually started to understand something profound: it's not about being a rigid machine or just checking boxes, but about building a consistent, intentional flow that genuinely sets me up to squeeze the most out of every single day. I call it finding my daily rhythm, and it's been a game-changer.

This isn't a ""you must do this"" kind of post. Instead, I wanted to share the blueprint I've discovered for myself the consistent morning actions that have helped me transform my days. Maybe some elements will click for you too! Here's how my day consistently begins:

Fueling My Fire, Simply: My energy levels feel incredibly connected to what I put into my body. So, I keep my eating incredibly simple and clean. I've learned that the energy I consume directly translates to the energy I have for my day. For me, it's about feeling vibrant and clear, not bogged down.

The Uninterrupted Dawn Launch: My alarm sounds at 5:00 AM sharp. There's no hitting snooze for me. Within minutes, I'm out the door and at the gym by 5:30 AM for a focused 45-minute workout. This early session is sacred time: no phone, no news, no outside distractions until it's done. It's purely for priming my body and mind, undisturbed, before the day's demands even have a chance to show up.

The ""Could Be My Last"" Perspective: After I get home and shower, I take a deliberate moment. I look in the mirror and give myself a very direct, honest message: ""I am going to make the most of today because, for all I know, it could be my last."" This isn't about being morbid; it's about radical appreciation and an urgent desire to infuse every moment with meaning. It's powerful.

Coffee, Calm & Cultivating Opportunity: Only after those first crucial steps do I brew my first pot of coffee, the aroma signaling my time for quiet contemplation. I don't just glance at my calendar; I intentionally think about how I can truly prosper today. It's about looking beyond the scheduled ""to-dos"" and actively seeking out opportunities for growth, connection, or positive impact.

This consistent morning sequence has become the bedrock of my day. It's how I found a rhythm that empowers me to approach each day with purpose and enthusiasm, and it's brought a level of fulfillment I genuinely value.

1luzax2,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1luzax2,If FD 6 had been happening in the 60s,"I saw that many people would like to see the FDB if its events took place immediately after the disaster and only with the participation of Iris and several people she saved. I decided to work on a script for a similar idea, and as a result, I got a kind of plot. This is the first time I've written something like this, so many details may not look quite thought out and logical, but I tried to come up with interesting deaths, plot twists and other things that people love about FD. At first, I only wanted to describe the deaths, but I got so carried away that in between I described the intermediate events. So if you're not particularly interested, I've marked each of the deaths with a number and a name, so it'll be easier for you to find the scene. Well, I hope my work was not in vain and someone will like it :) 

If you have any questions about the script and you want to know any specific points, then feel free to ask and I will try to answer. A lot of content was removed from the script, including several additional characters and alternate deaths. I even had to completely rewrite the ending, maybe I'll post a post about deleted content sometime.

——— 

Disaster: 
After the vision, Iris comes to her senses. Paul is standing in front of her, trying to propose. Iris realizes that her vision is about to come true and decides to flee the tower. She cares about the guests and wants to save them. She runs up to Alfred, trying to pick up a coin, but it is blown away by wind and sucked into the vent. Iris grabs the child's hand and pulls him along. Paul follows in shock. Daphne's hat is blown away and she decides to go downstairs, frightened by Iris' panic.

Iris, having gone down and tried to warn everyone that the floor of the tower is about to collapse, fails. Alfred screams that she is crazy and runs away towards the elevator, Daphne, who decides to return her hat, also goes to the elevator. Evie takes the frightened Iris aside and tries to calm her down, Iris cries and tries to draw Evie's attention to the cracked floor, but the music and Chuck's loud vocals drown out her words.

Realizing that Iris is not calming down, Evie decides that they need to go down the tower and go outside so that Iris can breathe and calm down. Paul supports the idea and the two of them lead Iris to the elevator.

Evie calls her son, asking him to come with her. He throws the toy train back and rushes towards his mother's voice. At the same time, the crowd keeps dancing, and the glasses keep cracking more and more, and nails start to fly out from the pillars of the tower. Beatrice, happily dancing with her husband and slightly tired, decides to take a break and steps aside. She notices that Iris is led towards the elevator. She approaches her and decides to check if everything is alright with the girl and offer her help. She joins Paul and Evie.

Alfred and Daphne were already standing at the elevator waiting for it to arrive, when Alfred noticed Iris and began to curse her, accusing her of ruining the fun. Evie asked the boy to stop, but he was rude to her. Maitre heard that there was a conflict near the elevator and decided to intervene. He approached the crowd at the door and noticed Iris and Paul. He did not want them to enter the tower, so he got angry and threatened to kick them out. At that moment, the elevator arrived, and new guests got out. After the elevator operator invited the crowd to enter, everyone was confused, especially Iris, who was very scared and crying. Alfred, Daphne, Evie, William, Beatrice, Maitre and Paul entered the elevator cabin. Maitre wanted to make sure the uninvited guests left the tower immediately. Chet pressed the button, and the doors closed, starting the descent.

There was dead silence in the elevator, Alfred glared at Iris, Paul hugged her and hugged her, Evie picked up her son, Chet wanted to say something, but realized that the atmosphere was tense and it was better to remain silent. Beatrice and Daphne stood at the door and watched the descent, they could hear people dancing loudly from above, jumping to the beat of the rhythm. Suddenly, a strange sound was heard, as if something had split and a moment later, people flew straight down right in front of the elevator, everyone in the elevator cabin was shocked, they watched a terrible picture, a bunch of people fell down and crashed on the asphalt. Iris clutched her head with her hands and her body froze. 

The elevator went down and its doors opened, everyone inside ran quickly into the hall, they could hear heart-rending screams and screams coming from above, and it seems that something was starting to collapse, Chet wanted to go upstairs and help people, but he did not have time, the elevator doors closed and he went up. Paul and Iris ran to the exit, followed by the others, Alfred overtook everyone and ran away from the tower, and everyone else had to run carefully, because people's bodies and fragments of the tower fell on top of them. Iris looked up and saw in horror the picture from her vision, the tower was burning and one of its sides began to tilt strongly. Evie, with her son in her arms, tried to avoid the wreckage, William was crying in her arms and hugged his mother tightly. Daphne took Beatrice's hand and they ran away from the tower together. Chet helped Paul guide Iris, and Maitre, in a panic, bumped into them and pushed, the trio fell and at the same moment, a beam from above fell with great speed directly onto Paul, crushing his head.

Iris's scream reflected the agony and horror she felt at the sight of Paul's death. Chet picked up Iris and tried to take her away, she was sobbing and screaming even louder than before. At the top, the piano rolled down the broken part of the tower, broke through the glass and began to fall down.Miraculously, Iris and Chet managed to avoid the piano falling on them and they were finally able to get out of the crash site. Having moved away from the tower to a safe distance, all the survivors looked in horror at the consequences of the disaster. Iris's desperate cry can be heard all over the neighborhood.

2 days later

I invite 8 rescued people for questioning a few days after the disaster. Iris is being interrogated, trying to figure out how she foresaw the disaster. The investigator doubts that it was an accident and interrogate the other survivors. Alfred accuses Iris and says that she behaved inappropriately and treated him badly. He knows that he can take advantage of a child's innocence and that everyone will forgive him, so he lies calmly and brazenly, without feeling a bit of regret. Maitre accuses Iris and Paul of being on the tower without getting permission to enter. He assumes that they planned the arson and the collapse of the tower. Daphne gives her testimony and suggests that Iris has simply gone mad and that her foresight is nothing more than a coincidence. Beatrice cannot give a clear statement, she cries during the interrogation, because her husband died on that tower and she could not cope with his loss. Evie arrives without William, she explains Iris' strange behavior due to her pregnancy. Chet can't give any testimony because he was at his job all the time and didn't know what was going on at the top of the tower. Chet can't give any testimony because he was at his job all the time and didn't know what was going on at the top of the tower. Iris tries to explain, but she doesn't really manage to do it clearly, she cries right during the interrogation and asks to let her and the others go. The investigator doesn't know what to say, he lets everyone go, and he starts trying to figure out the case.

One week later

A funeral is held in honor of the victims, to which only Iris and Beatrice come from the survivors, they both lost important people for them and they decide to share the grief together. At the end of the funeral, when everyone is leaving, Chet runs up to Iris, he is the only one who believes the girl and he thanks her for saving her. He decides to show Iris a newspaper clipping that mentions a similar incident that happened in the past. The clipping read ""incident occurred at the beginning of the 20th century, the guy predicted the explosion of an airship, he was able to dissuade a couple of people from flying, and in the end they were all miraculously saved"". Chet assumed that Iris was also lucky and she was able to see the impending disaster. Iris herself began to think that something was wrong with her, but when she saw the newspaper clipping, she looked at her vision from the positive side. She was grateful to Chet and was glad that he was one of those who did not blame her for saving her, Chet suggested that they meet one of these days and go for a walk to relax a little, to which Iris agreed. After taking one last look at the grave of the deceased Paul, she shed a tear and left the cemetery. 

Death: 

1) Beatrice 
Beatrice comes to the crematorium to pick up the urn with her husband's ashes. While the employee is off on business, she notices an urn on the table and reaches for it. At this moment, a mouse runs across the floor — Beatrice gets scared, backs away and accidentally stands on the platform for feeding bodies into the oven. A sudden movement causes the platform to move. Beatrice loses her balance, hits her head on a lamp and falls unconscious onto the platform. Her body in the supine position slowly rolls into the open oven. A draft from the open windows slams the door shut. Meanwhile, the mouse climbs the shelf, knocks the urn, which falls on the trigger lever. The furnace is activated. A few seconds later, Beatrice burns alive inside a working cremation chamber.

2) Evie
Evie is backstage before going on stage. She hurriedly applies hairspray, not noticing that someone's forgotten cigarette is smoldering on the table next to her. The air flow from the fan directs a jet of varnish directly onto the ember — a flash occurs. Evie's hair lights up instantly. In a panic, she runs around the dressing room, her synthetic dress ignites. Blinded by the fire, she runs into the scenery backstage and knocks over boxes of paint and solvents. The fire instantly engulfs everything around. Evie screams, but the way to the exit is already cut off — she burns alive under the rubble of flaming structures.

3)Maitre 
Maitre, annoyed after an evening at a restaurant, returns home. In the lobby, he bumps into a forgotten cleaning lady's cart and angrily kicks it, knocking over a bucket of dirty water. Water spreads across the marble floor, flowing into the elevator cabin, and splashes hit the call button, causing sparks. An old light bulb is blinking dimly inside the elevator. Maitre enters, presses the button for his floor, but the elevator does not respond — the grille is stuck. Irritated, he tries to close it manually, and at that moment the cabin jerks up sharply, almost tearing off his fingers with the concrete edge of the shaft. Staggering back, he does not notice the puddle on the floor, slips and falls, hitting the wall. A light bulb bursts from the concussion, and its fragments plunge into the man's body — one passes a millimeter from the eye, piercing above the eyelid. Clutching her heart, Maitre breathes heavily. Sparks from the button on the ground floor continue to pour, water seeps to the wires, and the elevator suddenly freezes between floors. In a panic, Maitre decides to get out: he pushes back the grate and begins to squeeze through to the upper floor. At this moment, the elevator starts moving again. The cabin soars up, and the edge of the shaft, like a giant blade, crunches Maitre in half. The upper part of his body remains on the floor of the floor, and the lower part disappears into the dark shaft along with the cabin.

4) Chet 

After the deaths of Beatrice and Evie, Iris became increasingly convinced that their deaths were coming. After studying the airship accident, she found out that all the survivors had died within a few months in the order they should have been killed in the accident. The death of her master was the last straw. A terrifying picture was forming in her mind, everyone was dying the same way it would have happened in the tower.It was raining. Iris, panicked, dialed Chet's number. Chet was unaware of anything and was preparing breakfast on an old stove. He was in his pyjamas, humming along to the radio. The phone rang and he picked it up. Iris screamed at Chet from across the line, begging him to stay home and not do anything. She said he was next and asked for his address. Chet seemed confused, but decided to give it to her, and then static interrupted the call. He shrugged and went back to cooking. He thought Iris was just scared and needed support. The receiver was malfunctioning, and its interference resembled the screams of agonizing people. Chet knocked on it trying to fix it.

Meanwhile, work was underway on the road near his house. Powerful machines were drilling asphalt and causing strong vibrations. Under his house, old concrete began to crack from the tremors - crumbs fell from the ceiling. A can of paint was swinging on a shelf, which suddenly fell on a circular saw next to it. The wire hit the switch and the saw came to life with its blade spinning rapidly.

Later, Iris took a taxi to see Chet but the road was blocked by construction. She had to find another way around. Chet flipped pancakes on the pan carefully catching them as they turned over. Iris managed to find a route and knocked on the door. Chet stopped cooking and turned down the gas. Surprised, he went to the door. While they were talking, the vibration caused the handle of a frying pan to shift and knock a bottle of oil off the counter. The lid popped off and oil began to spill out. At that moment, Iris confusedly but firmly told Chet about a series of deaths and the accident on airship. She described her vision and said everything was happening in order. Chet listened, but smiled doubtfully - he thought it was just a coincidence.

Chet remembered breakfast and went back into the kitchen. Iris followed tensely. At that point, a gust from the open window blew out the gas, so Chet angrily rushed to turn it back on. Not noticing the oil on the floor, he slipped and fell on his back. Workers were carelessly drilling the asphalt. The crack went straight to Chets house, causing the foundation to slightly sag. Because of that, a pan of boiling pancakes tipped over onto his face, burning his face and making him scream in pain. Then the floor collapsed under him and Chet fell down. Iris barely managed to grab his arm. Underneath was a working saw with its blade coming closer and closer. Chet looked down in horror with his badly burned face. With great strength, Iris pulled him back up. They fell to the floor gasping for air. Chet wiped the pancake off his face with shaking hands and coughed. Now he started to believe Iris.

5) Daphne

After Iris saves Chet, they start thinking about how to save the rest of the people on the death list. She assumes that if Chet was able to avoid her, then Daphne will be the next one to die. The girl also puts forward a theory on how to prevent deaths, pointing to the deaths of Beatrice, Evie and Maitre, she explains to the Chet that everyone died the death they died in the tower: Beatrice and Evie burned alive, and Maitre's body was cut in half. Just like in the vision, Chet had to fall, which would have happened to him if Iris hadn't saved him.  
Iris suggests that Daphne may die after being hit by a heavy object or falling. She also understands how Alfred will die, and that his death will have to be indirectly related to the fall of something or even directly from the piano. Aris is determined and she and Chet are going to find Daphne to prevent her death. 

Later that evening, Daphne
goes to a newly opened shopping mall in the city center. It's a new discovery for everyone, and she wants to see what's on sale there. After walking through the trendiest stores, her attention is drawn to a beauty salon. She enters the trendy beauty salon ""SKY SKIN Studio"", where they promise free express facial treatments at the opening: peeling, steam mask and a new product - LED phototherapy with skin heating.

She is led into a separate room. The atmosphere is sterile, snow-white, with glossy surfaces and subdued music. The beautician applies an acid gel, turns on the steam unit, then lowers a massive phototherapy lamp over her face. Daphne is given protective plastic eye pads. Daphne can hear a strange voice warning her of danger, the beautician calms her down and says that their new security system is acting up and constantly turns on for no reason, the woman turns it off for a while so as not to bother the client with annoying sounds.

The beautician is called to sign some papers, so she goes to another room, leaving Daphne alone.

In the utility room of the salon, an electrician fixes a short circuit in the advertising panel that had been blinking since the morning. Without turning off the power on the line, he accidentally closes the contact, a voltage surge flashes in the power circuit. The salon blinked the light ... and everything is back to normal. But not for Daphne.

The surge damages the phototherapy lamp control board, instead of gently warming up, the device switches to continuous radiation mode at full power, quickly overheating. The security system does not work, because it was turned off.

Iris and Chet spent the whole day trying to find Daphne, but their attempts were unsuccessful, in such a big city it would be too difficult. Desperate, they decide to have dinner in one of the restaurants located in the shopping center, having arrived there, during dinner Iris again breaks through to emotions and she mourns the death of Paul. Chet also shares his sore points, telling the girl how difficult it was for him to recover from the disaster at the tower, he liked his job and he was truly happy when the tower opened. But he also says that initially he considered the idea of ​​​​opening the tower ahead of schedule to be obviously bad, since for safety reasons it was a violation of all the rules. But the management forced him and other employees to remain silent, threatening to fire them if someone scared off the guests with this information, so Chet had to tell all the guests with a smile on his face that the fact that the tower opened ahead of schedule is normal.

After half a minute, Daphne begins to fidget. Steam burns her face, the lamp gets hotter. But the mask and gel on her face have already reacted, causing intense burning. She doesn't understand if this is normal. Then one of the eye pads slips off, and direct light hits her pupil.

She screams - the light, like from a welder, instantly burns through her cornea, causing partial blindness and terrible pain. In a panic, she twitches, tries to get up - and knocks a steam generator full of water off the pedestal.

The device falls, and hot steam from the broken case bursts out, right on her face. Her skin begins to bubble, boiling water penetrates her eyes and under the mask. Her scream becomes a wheeze. Almost blind, she jumps up, rips off the wires and runs out of the procedure room in the dark by touch.

Iris feels a strange feeling, she understands that something is wrong. Chet notices this and tries to figure out what happened, Iris doesn't know what's going on, but she senses a strange tension in the air and lightly grabs her head.

Daphne runs down the glossy hallway of the salon, disoriented and contorted with pain, until she flies into the hall, where a new sign is being installed. The electrician left a box of tools and a long ladder, leaning against the very edge of the railing.

Daphne runs into the ladder, it breaks, and she falls with it from the upper tier, breaking through a glass partition. The girl falls right into the fountain located on the first floor, she writhes in pain and tries to get out of the water, but due to her visual impairment, she can only flounder. When falling, the ladder touches a marble ball located on top of the fountain, it sways slightly and soon breaks off and falls right on the girl's disfigured face, crushing it.

The screams of the shoppers below echo throughout the mall, Iris hears this and runs out of the restaurant and watches a horrifying scene, Daphne's body sinks into the fountain, leaving blood-red spots on the surface of the water.

6) Alfred

Alfred is in his parents' luxurious mansion, forced to play the piano under the constant supervision of a strict tutor. Tomorrow is a concert at a music school, and parents have high hopes for their son. Alfred doesn't care about all this, but threats to deprive him of pocket money forced him to agree to classes. He is bored of being under control, and he dreams of getting rid of the tutor at least for a while.

At this moment, a bell rings at the gate from the street. Alfred immediately decides to take advantage of the situation: he asks for permission to go out to find out who came. The tutor is annoyed, but allows him to leave for five minutes. Alfred smiles contentedly, runs out of the room and happily rushes down the stairs. He opens the heavy front door and does not close it — a strong stream of air immediately rushes into the house, which collides with the airflow from the music room, creating a powerful draft.

Outside, at the gate, Alfred notices two strangers, but soon recognizes them as the psychotic and deranged Iris and the empty-headed dwarf fox. He looks at them contemptuously, especially at Iris, whom he considers a crazy alarmist who ruined the fun on the tower. Iris, who received a flyer announcing tomorrow's concert, realized that this was where Alfred was going to die. She and Chet found out from the townspeople where Alfred's family lives and after that found his house, and now she is trying to warn him of the impending danger.

Alfred listens to her with mockery and rudeness. He doesn't believe a word of it, and when Iris mentions that the piano will kill him, he laughs even louder. He claims that the instrument cannot move, because it will stand firmly on the stage. Iris can't explain it clearly, she's trying to figure out different ways for the piano to kill Alfred. In the end, Alfred believes that her goal is just to scare him, and, putting his hands in his pockets, leaves, whistling.

At this time, the tutor leaves the room, annoyed that Alfred has not returned. There's still a draft coming into the music room. The curtain rises up and touches an antique candlestick. He falls and hits the piano leg. The tool stands on a tilted platform, and its wheels are fixed with old locks that have not been tested for a long time. The candlestick breaks one of the clamps. After a couple of seconds, the second one also breaks off and the piano starts moving.

At first, he slowly rolls along the platform, then leaves the threshold of the room and moves towards the balustrade, and then the stairs. Downstairs, at the entrance to the mansion, a tutor is standing, shouting to Alfred to return to the house immediately. Alfred reluctantly heads for the door, sticking his tongue out at Iris along the way.

The piano crashes down the stairs. It accelerates with each flight. The tutor turns around, but before he can even scream, the heavy instrument knocks him down, tearing his body apart. Blood and body fragments scatter across the marble floor.

Alfred manages to jump aside at the last moment and falls into the bushes. The piano, continuing to move, breaks and stops at the very gate, where Iris and Chet are standing in shock. Their eyes are glued to the creepy scene.

Alfred runs into the house in panic and fear, his childish mind cannot explain what happened and he believes that Iris wanted to make an attempt on his life, he calls the police and reports what happened, saying that the previously suspected girl wanted to kill him. The investigator is informed about this and he immediately goes with the cops to the call. 

Iris realizes that she's next. A picture of the terrible events on the tower pops up in front of her, where she falls from it, trying to protect a little boy, onto the broken rebar that runs through her mouth. She returns to reality and a chill runs down her spine, she is not so afraid of her own death as the death of a boy who is just starting his life and it can end at any moment. Iris hears the sounds of approaching police and realizes that she will be taken to the station, she does not try to escape, but on the contrary remains in place. She asks Chet to find and look after the boy and protect him if necessary, she herself will be ready to fight with all her might to avoid her own death, so that the chain does not go further. Chet can't believe what he's heard, he asks Iris to come to her senses, but she smiles at him and asks him to leave, meanwhile the cops' cars are already visible. Chet cries and swears to Iris that he will try to find the boy, he hugs her goodbye and runs away. Iris looks at the approaching cars and raises her hands up.

She is being interrogated at the police station, there are no weighty arguments and evidence about Iris' guilt, but the investigator is still skeptical of her. He decides to look into the case, and for the duration of his proceedings, he puts Iris in pre-trial detention center. Being behind the iron bars, Iris's heart is pounding wildly, and she begins to look around nervously, expecting that death could attack from any direction. 

7) Iris

The investigator, tired of the endless protocols, decided to take a break and went out for a smoke, slamming the heavy door behind him.
The vibration from the slammed door went through the wall, barely perceptible, but enough for the old wall mount to crack. The shelf hanging next to the door slowly began to tilt. The nail, trembling under her weight, slipped out, and the next moment the shelf collapsed with a thud. As she fell, she knocked a paper cup of coffee off the table. The hot liquid spilled, spreading rapidly over the surface, flooding documents, photographs, and diagrams. The coffee slowly crept to the edge of the table. Iris goes to the bars, calls for help, but no one hears her. The coffee continues to drain. The socket is sparking more and more, the plastic is melting. At this moment, the ceiling fan twitches slightly — its old bolts imperceptibly begin to loosen.
Suddenly, there is a sharp flash from the wall outlet. Iris reflexively steps back, not taking her eyes off her. She is focused on the sparkling outlet, not noticing how the fan is sagging more and more directly above it.
The bolts fly out one by one. The fan breaks off from the ceiling and falls down. At the moment of impact, one of the metal blades breaks off from the body and violently flies towards Iris, heading straight for her throat.
At the last moment, sensing movement, Iris jumps sideways. The blade whizzes by and hits the wall behind her with a thud. Iris falls to the floor, breathing heavily. The investigator heard a strange noise from the street and decided to return after finishing his cigarette, he bursts into the room and looks stunned at the mess inside it, he goes inside and approaches the fallen fan, not noticing that his bare wires are in the spilled coffee, he enters a puddle and his body is immediately pierced by an electric discharge, which is why he falls to the floor in convulsions. Iris watches in horror and restrains her screams, after a couple of seconds the investigator stops convulsing and goes quiet. Iris, holding back her tears, notices the keys lying in the investigator's pocket. She can't reach them with her hand, so she grabs the torn blade from the fan and hooks the keys with it. Opening the door, she runs out from behind the bars and carefully steps over the man's body, hurrying to the exit.

8) William 

William had been in a sad state for several days now. His mom died and he couldn't even say goodbye to her. He was taken into custody by Evie's parents. Today, the funeral of her mother was scheduled, which was attended by most of the city, as Evie was a popular singer and loved by many. William stood aside and cried quietly, still not believing that his mother was gone. A car parked a few meters behind him, and Chet got out. He learned about the funeral from an article in the newspaper and immediately went to them, assuming that the boy would be there. 

He ran up to William and asked if everything was okay with him. The boy was confused and didn't know what to say, just pointing at his mother's coffin. Chet offered his condolences, realizing how hard it was for the little boy.   

Clouds are gathering over the cemetery and it starts to rain. The wind is picking up, tearing the last leaves from the trees. The workers near the grave, rushing to finish their work, do not notice how a metal shovel rolls off a pile of earth and catches a coil of rope. The rope pulls a rotten wooden support that held an old temporary cross, which falls and knocks down a nearby spotlight on a tripod.

The spotlight falls to one side, and the heavy tripod hits the wheel of the hearse parked on the slope. A slipped shovel gets under the wheel, and it slowly takes off. The car starts rolling smoothly down the gravel path, right to where Chet and William are standing.

Chet hears a dull crack, turns around, and at the last moment manages to push the boy aside, jumping after him himself. The hearse rushes past and crashes into the fence, stopping.
The fall of the spotlight tears the electrical cable, sparks pour towards the gasoline canister, accidentally left by the workers. The canister falls, spilling fuel, and the flash from the short circuit instantly ignites the puddle. The fire is creeping across the grass, approaching the hearse's gas tank.

Chet grabs William by the arm and drags him away, but right in front of them, a rotten oak tree, weakened by the rain, begins to tilt. He falls with a crash, blocking the way to the exit.
They are cut off from the crowd. There is a burning hearse behind, and a collapsed tree in front. William stumbles and falls, his foot gets stuck between the roots. Chet, in a panic, tries to pull the boy out.
An explosion is heard behind the car's gas tank detonates. The blast wave rips pieces of stone and wood from the ground, one of the fragments wounds Chet in the shoulder, but he continues to pull the boy.
The wind shakes the old gravestone statue of an angel, which cracks under its own weight. William screams. Chet pulls the boy out at the last moment, but falls himself his foot slips on the wet marble.
The statue falls down. At the last second, Chet pushes William aside, and the angel lands on his chest with a thud. The heavy mass crushes Chet, instantly killing him. 

Three months later 

Iris and William became friends after a series of terrible and endless deaths. The girl found out where the boy lived and began to visit him often, together they went to Chet's funeral and Iris helped William cope with the loss of his mother.  

Iris and William decide to take a break from the recent tragedies and go to a concert. In the lobby, they are greeted by a huge poster of a popular rock band with a provocative inscription: ""DIE IN THE FIRE."" Iris freezes, her heart starts racing — she sees this as a sign, another warning. Licking her dry lips, she tries to calm down, telling herself that it's just a coincidence. They go into the hall and take their seats. Iris glances at a small decorative fountain in front of the stage, trickles of water in it gushing upward, reflecting the light. She feels strangely uneasy, but she decides not to show it.
In front, almost at the very edge of the stage, was Alfred, sullen and nervous. A large concert piano with a glossy black body is installed on the stage. Everything is sparkling, sparkling, the music is about to start.

Meanwhile, upstairs, in the cramped back room above the stage, several workers are resting after preparing the scenery. One of them, jokingly, takes out an old lucky coin from his pocket and starts tossing it. The coin slips out of my fingers and, by an incredible coincidence, slides into the vent. The workers are laughing, not paying attention to it. The coin disappears into the darkness of the pipes.

The musicians begin to gather on the stage. The pianist passes by the instrument, but no one notices that the stage is slightly bent under the piano.

Meanwhile, the coin, having run through the ventilation ducts, gets stuck right on the ventilation grate directly above the stage, vibrating and shifting millimeter by millimeter.

Iris feels strangely anxious. Her gaze catches on the piano, and now she sees Alfred sitting in the front row.

At the moment when the musicians begin their part, a coin, with a soft metallic sound, falls down through the grate. Iris notices her fall and abruptly gets up from her seat, trying to make her way through the crowd to prevent Alfred's death. The coin lands exactly on top of the piano, creating that tiny extra weight, which is enough for the weakened boards underneath to crack completely.

The boards of the stage suddenly break abruptly, the piano begins to fall forward. People on stage don't immediately understand what's going on. The piano slowly slides forward and then takes off from the stage.

Alfred only manages to open his mouth. Iris screams his name, but he doesn't have time to move.

The piano lid comes off and lands on top of Alfred with a crash, chopping off his head. 
The whole hall is filled with heart-rending screams....",3,1752006301.0,FinalDestination,0,1.0,False

The System,"The first call of the day and I already want to go back to bed. The suspect is in cuffs on the sidewalk when I pull up to the city square. An old man in an offensive t-shirt, holding a stack of papers in his hand. There’s a guitar next to him. I don’t even have to talk to the officers at the scene to see what’s been going on.

“Ok… sir? Do you want to explain what you're wearing?”

“It’s a t-shirt.” I look down at three cardboard boxes full of similar shirts. The word “FREE” is written on the side of one of the boxes. 

“Yes, but what does it say?”

“It doesn’t say anything. These are Rorschach shirts. Made them myself.” 

“Sir, your shirt says, Liberty or Death.”

“Maybe it does to you. Who’s to say if it actually says anything?” 

“Uh huh. Do you have approval from the system to possess a musical instrument?”

“I don’t possess it, it possesses me.” This is going exactly how I thought it would. One of the arresting officers hands me a large stack of handwritten notes.

“And what are these?”

“Poems. Songs. Jokes. Stories. Memories of times past. I’ve been writing them my whole life.”

“And what do they have to deal with?”

“Life. Just life. How wonderful it can be when people are brave. How awful it can be when they’re not.” 

“You’ve been handing these out as well?”

“Yes.”

“This is all Non-System generated literature?”

“Yes. I wrote every word. Nothing approved and/or artificial.”

“You realize that engaging in unauthorized organic outreach is very serious.”

“Oh, I don’t engage in anything very serious, Officer.”

“It’s Detective. I’ve earned the title, thank you.”

“My apologies.”

“Does he have his Federal Identification on him?”

“No. He had this, sir.” The officer hands me a small strip of paper. The paper says, “Dr. Bumblesquat, Musing Musician and Purveyor of Prose”.

“Ok… so here’s what’s gonna happen Mr. Bumblesquat…”

“Doctor. I’ve earned the title, thank you.” He smiles at me. 

After I have one of the officers break his jaw with their baton, the old man doesn’t smile anymore.

I go back to my car and type the charges into the Federal System.

*UnAuthorized possession of musical instrument*

*Creation of Non-System generated material*

*Possession of Non-System generated material*

*Distribution of Non-System generated material*

I don’t want to type any more of the charges, I just hit enter. 

Why did the morning start off like this? I haven’t had enough coffee yet. 

The system is slow today. I can’t stop yawning. I need more sleep.

The judgment flashes on the screen. Exactly what I thought it was going to be.

The old man says he forgives me. I shoot him in the back of his head. The handwritten papers he was holding float away on the breeze, toward a group of children nearby.

“Shit! Can you guys grab those and get this cleaned up? I need to get some coffee.”

1luz901,https://www.reddit.com/r/BoardGame3DPrints/comments/1luz901/zombie_in_my_pocket_3d_print/,Zombie in my Pocket - 3d Print,"About 12 (may be 15?) years ago, looking for simple short solo board game to kill some time, I discovered [Zombie in my Pocket](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/33468/zombie-in-my-pocket), a print-and-play game by [Jeremiah Lee](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgamedesigner/9817/jeremiah-lee), in which you kill zombies in a house and garden.

I played it for a while, silly and simple as it was. And then I moved to other games. And other games.

In 2018 I rediscovered it, and started to play it with my boy, then 8 yo. We killed lots of zombies together, turning the game into a semi-roleplaying game, hunting the dead around our house, in semi-darkness.

Then Game of Thrones season 8 happened and I sketched up a GOT variant of the game, with special daggers, scorpions, wildfire and even a  coffee cup - hardcore GoT fan as I am. I had also an instant death card called GRMartin. I played it as John Snow, Aria, Bran and Jaime.

I wanted to turn this into something nice to share it with the world but life came my way ...

Anyway, now I have a 3d printer and, whilst looking for things to 3d model and print, my boy and I recalled the good old times when our house was full of zombies and we had to bury that strange bloody totem somewhere in the garden, under the Weirwood tree.

So we made this:

My issue is that most of the time I'm not hungry. I can go to 1 or 2 pm with just coffee and a ""healthy"" biscuit or no food. I go with it because I figure my body is telling me something. Of course, I don't lose any weight because I'm bedbound but have been able to maintain a stable weight. Sometimes I eat because I'm tired rather than hungry.

Do you eat regularly whether you're hungry or not? Do you think it's important even if you have ZERO appetite? Do you see a difference when you eat planned snacks or meals throughout the day?

1luz2rb,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/1luz2rb/someone_just_tell_me_im_crazy_for_liking_this_girl/,Someone just tell me I’m crazy for liking this girl,"So I’ve been a single guy for a majority of my life. I’m also a traveling nurse. 

I took a stint in Arizona. I met this BEAUTIFUL girl doing her PhD who’s there from Europe. We met for coffee and my expectations were super low, as I expected to be inconvenienced by how foreign she was and boy was I wrong. We met and she said that she had a week, then had to travel out of state for a month for school, and immediately after that was going back to Europe for the summer.. but would be back in AZ after.

Our coffee date turned into an entire day extravaganza, where she ultimately ended up staying at my place after dinner. We proceeded to spend every single available bit of daylight together the rest of the days that she was in AZ, and also slept over with each other every single night per her request. She seemed like she was trying to be reluctant in her feelings, but we would spend 5-10 minute at a time just lying there next to each other staring into each other’s eyes not saying a word. She even told me she wanted to chase after me down the hall when I was leaving that last morning, but it would have “been too painful.” 

Fast forward, we had talked every day for the month she was out of state. Sending selfies and what seemed like equal communication, felt super natural. Now she has been back in Europe for a another month.. right as she was leaving the states she had stopped initiating conversations and, while she was still nice and responded, has been uninterested in our conversations. I have stopped contact aside from us liking each other’s IG stories. Am I CRAZY for still thinking about this girl??? Every day?? Maybe the 9 hour time difference was too much. Maybe she had an ex back there at home or realized how much she liked her European life. Maybe the whole thing was just one of those fever dream type experiences.. either way it’s eating me up because we kept saying this isn’t goodbye, but see you later. It just felt so real but maybe I’m just a simp. 

Now I guess my dilemma is… do I take another contract in AZ after my one in OR is up because I know she’ll be back there next month for school? Or do I move on with my life and enjoy the time we had? 

Someone just tell me I’m crazy, because how could this really work. Feelings suck man.

1luz0td,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1luz0td,"I went, smelt the new vanillas, and left with only this…","For context: this is my long winded and probably lame opinion, so take it for what it’s worth. 🤣

This morning I had my cart filled and was  100% going to pull the trigger on the Vanilla Ease and Vanilla Café, because I have a serious obsession with Vanilla Romance and *IF* these were half as good as VR, I wanted them. Especially on SALE. However, I hate blind buys on scents because I hate returning things if not absolutely necessary; so I called my local store and asked if they had them in stock so I could smell them first- and then I would have gone home and bought them online if I loved them. Thankfully, they had them, but they aren’t out on the floor yet for sale- but they said I could go and test/smell them. Thank goodness I did! 

Again, keep in mind, this is my goofy opinion only…but this was very easy hard pass on both for me. To me, Vanilla Ease was almost too identical to the Lavender and Vanilla from the Wellness collection for me to tell the difference. I already have tons of that scent, so if you love that scent- you’ll love Vanilla Ease. I couldn’t justify buying it at even 5.95 since I already have what, to me, smells almost identical. It’s a pretty scent, and I’m sure many will love it. 😅

Now- and this hurts my heart, I was *TRULY* hoping I would love Vanilla Café because coffee and vanilla is my jam. Upon smelling it, I was punched dead in the nose with hazelnut. While I could definitely smell the coffee note, the vanilla was almost nonexistent…but the hazelnut note came through like a wrecking ball. Considering I cannot stand to smell Nutella (it literally makes me nauseous), I had to pass on that one as well. On dry down, it was still so strong i had to shower when getting home, because I was gagging on my own smell. However- if you love coffee and hazelnut- this one is for you! My mom loves Hazelnut and she smelled it and bought hers online. She will hoard this one till the end she said, lol…

I was a little disappointed that I didn’t like either of them considering how obsessed I am with VR…but oh well, more for you babes! I know a lot of people will love them, I just knew I would never end up wearing them. Want not, waste not. So I ended up leaving with 2 wallflower plugs, and the S’mores Pocketbac holder. The plug ins were screaming Dark Academia to me combined with fall….so YES, YES, YES! On a lighter note: I wanted to share some pics of the Wallflower plugs so you can see how they look in person, super cute! Okay, I’ll shut up now. Have a great day y’all! 🫶🏼
