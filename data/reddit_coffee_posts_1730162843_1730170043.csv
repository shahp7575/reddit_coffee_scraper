And dry lips for me is a minefield for picking. I’ve had this reaction so many times for forever and I thought it was the caffeine but I’ve been drinking almost exclusively decaf and still have this happen, so I did more research and I think it’s either the acidity of the coffee against my lips, the heat, or the tannins. Either way—I’m going to try stopping drinking any hot coffee, and possibly hot tea. It doesn’t happen nearly as much with cold coffee and possibly because of the straw or just the temperature, not sure. 

I’ll try to report back on results. I’ve had some success with this in the past but not nearly as categorical as I am going to be now.

Just worried about the cost because my family is always trying to save money, but I thought it would be nice to make her feel special.

I Will Always Love You,"My husband died of a heart attack on February 2, 2015; he was 60 years old. That morning, he drove our youngest daughter, who was 16, to the bus stop because it was dark and raining outside. When he came home, we sat and had a cup of coffee together. At 7 a.m., he went into our bedroom to shower and get ready for work. I told him I’d give him half an hour before I would come in to take my shower.

When I did, I found him dead on the bathroom floor. His skin was grey, his eyes open, his glasses on, and his body twisted as if he had collapsed. I tried to get a response, then started chest compressions. Nothing. I called for my dad, who was in the kitchen, to call 911. When help arrived, it was a police officer, then later EMTs.

The officer tried to give him a shock with those paddles, but it wouldn’t go off at all to provide the shock; he was gone, unresponsive. The EMTs couldn’t get his heart started either. He was dead. I was in shock. We had been together for 22 years and married for 17.5 years. He was the love of my life, my soulmate. The doctor at the hospital said he died instantly; he wouldn’t have known what was happening, and he didn’t feel any pain. I’m so much regretful that I didn’t have the chance to talk to him in his last breaths. God, at least once…

A week after his passing, a female friend of mine was helping me go through my husband’s things in our bedroom. I was standing by his side of the bed, gathering up papers and mail from his nightstand. I turned and looked up toward the hallway that was between the bathroom and a little dressing room where our closets were. I saw a dark shadow step out of the bathroom into the hallway and turn toward me, about 15 feet away.

1gek8n2,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1gek8n2/husband_doesnt_want_to_go_out_because_it_costs/,Husband doesn’t want to go out because it costs money. Any suggestions on low cost outings I can suggest to him? ,"
We have been married for two years. For most of that time I worked full time and he worked part time; but he has occasionally picked up extra shifts. We both have mental health struggles, go to therapy and have a fantastic support system with our family. There is no doubt in my mind that we are happy together. 

What’s tripping me up is that throughout the last year I have been focusing on wanting to go out to dinner together so we are getting out of the house for other reasons besides work and to take the pressure of cooking off of us occasionally. He isn’t keen and has said this is either because we don’t have money or because he isn’t the type of person who wants to go out. What I’m hearing that he isn’t saying is that he just actually doesn’t want to go out. Now… If he doesn’t want to go out, I am aware I can go out by myself or with friends but I am reluctant and feel he will be hurt or mad at me. More details on that in additional info section. 

I left my job earlier this year as I couldn’t cope anymore. Up until that point I had this mindset that I needed to work as hard as possible and make as much money as I could. I ended up burning out and living off my savings when I left my job until I could get back on my feet.

When I was working full time I was very tired and didn’t do much outside of work. For the last few months I have mostly left the house for work purposes as I’ve taken a leading role in our business so I have a focus. Whilst it does well, it doesn’t do well enough to support both of us so my husband is still in his part time job that he really doesn’t like. 

More often than not in our marriage I would organise dinner even on the days he wasn’t working. I would get annoyed when I would get home from work and realise he hadn’t even thought to organise anything. When I would ask what we should do for dinner, he says  without fail “I don’t know”. 

On days that I had a hard day at work and he hadn’t organised anything, I would ask if we can go out and he would say no. Keep in mind I don’t ask him to pay when we go out. (We don’t have shared finances but we go half in all bills and I pay for food shopping on top of that). I have even at times tried to make cooking schedules and that hasn’t worked either. The wanting to go out is for a change of scenery and spending time together as well as taking that “what to cook” decision off of my brain. 

If I don’t cook, he will not eat or get take away. 

Since I left my job, I have asked many times for us to go out. I have suggested coffee and cake, using our membership to the zoo to get in for free, mini golf gift vouchers we have for free games and even making food and going to the beach to eat dinner. These in my opinion are low cost outings and once again I would be paying as I really want to go. 

His response is it costs money to get there aka in fuel. I have also mentioned if he didn’t get take away or drive to the servo to get soft drinks almost daily it would save money too. Not much has changed on that front. 

Last night I brought up the wanting to go out thing again and he mentioned that we don’t have savings and we need money behind us as we won’t be able to cope if something unexpected comes up. I agree with this. I also feel I need something fun to do and I want to have outings with him. 

My question is, what can we do together out of the house that doesn’t cost money? 

TLDR: I want to do low cost fun things with my husband outside the house but he always says no as they cost money. I feel he doesn’t actually want to go out. Regardless… Anyone have any outing suggestions I can pitch to him? 

ADDITIONAL INFO: Last year I was diagnosed with PTSD. Despite my best efforts to push through and keep working, I ended up having a break down and my medical assessment was that I can no longer work full time hours. My job couldn’t accommodate the part time hours I could work in the position I was in and moved me to another role and location. I was bullied badly at the new location and left the job as it made my mental health much worse. In my last two weeks of working in that job I asked my husband to organise dinner as I could barely cope showing up in a workplace that I felt were nasty to me. He didn’t take care of dinner. I was really hurt by this as I felt unsupported when I expressed what I needed to get through that difficult time.

I put my focus into our side business which does well but not well enough to support us both. I always cover my own bills and half of our shared cost of living. I am really using this time to focus on my recovery and build up our business rather than get another job working for someone else. I never want to feel as low and unwell as I did when I broke down last year so I’m focused on getting better. 

A couple of weeks ago I mentioned again that I want to go out for dinner sometime and got the same “we have no money” response. A couple of days later my brother asked me out for dinner with my parents and offered to pay. I didn’t invite my husband, like I always do, because he had made it clear once again that we couldn’t afford to go out and I felt that me bringing up going out again once he reset the same boundary would be seen as me not listening to him. I also wasn’t sure who would pay for my husband to attend. He then told me he was really hurt when he wasn’t invited. I feel like I have to make decisions in lose lose situations where there is no right choice. Sure I can go out with other people I suppose, but this situation has made me very reluctant now because I think will he be hurt if I go out without him or will he be mad because I’m spending money when we have no savings. 

I have always had a weekly budget and cut expenses where ever I can. I also sell my belongings weekly to get extra money. I’ve done this before we were married also. We also do car boot sales together. My husband has applied for other jobs but with no success. 

We don’t share finances because my husband spends money on random things. He recently broached the topic that we could combine our bank accounts and I thought about it. When I agreed, he felt funny about it and neither of us know why. So we haven’t combined our finances.

I’m a high school senior with an idea for a social app, and I’d love to get feedback on whether this idea could actually work in the market. My goal is to create a platform that makes it easy for people to make, share, and interact with rankings and tier lists on just about anything. This could be anything from sports and food to games, countries, animals—literally whatever people want to rank! Here’s a breakdown of my vision and features:

# Core Concept

* **Convenient Tier List Creation**: Users (or ""creators"") can make and publish their own tier lists, with tools for quickly setting up, editing, and sharing lists with others. The app would offer a smooth, organized process for creating lists, making it quick and easy to share opinions and rankings.
* **Social Interaction**: Users can invite friends to view and rank lists, creating “live ranking games” where friends rank items in real-time.
* **Wide Topic Range**: The goal is to allow people to rank and share anything they’re passionate about, from ranking pizza toppings to favorite vacation spots or video game characters.

# Features Breakdown

1. **Polls and Ratings**: Each tier list could include polls for users to rate and discuss specific rankings. This could help determine which lists or items are most agreed upon or controversial.
2. **Tournaments**: Think bracket-style tournaments where items go head-to-head, with users voting until there’s a final winner. This could be a fun, competitive way to determine “ultimate” rankings.
3. **Trending & Community Highlights**: A section that showcases popular or controversial lists, as well as trending topics (like ranking Oscar nominees or best Halloween movies during October).
4. **Collaborative Lists**: Allow multiple users to collaborate on a single tier list, great for group discussions or events where everyone contributes to the rankings.
5. **Achievement Badges & Analytics**: Gamify the experience with badges for creating popular lists or voting in tournaments, and provide creators with analytics (views, likes, etc.) to see which lists gain traction.
6. **Daily/Weekly Themes**: Provide users with a “Daily Ranking Challenge” on various topics (e.g., “Best Fall Foods” in autumn), encouraging participation around trending themes.
7. **Interactive Comments**: Users could comment on specific items within a tier list, sparking discussions or debates over the rankings.

**End Goal**  
The ultimate goal of the app is to provide a convenient, engaging platform where people can easily make and share lists or rankings on any topic. Whether you’re curious about someone’s favorite coffee flavors or want to settle which NBA player is the GOAT, this app would be a place for it.

**Questions**  
Is this kind of app something you’d be interested in? Do you think people would use it? Also, if anyone has insight into making it marketable, I’d love your advice!

For a lot of people, it still is all you will hear. There's so much wrapped up in this rhetoric but a lot of it boils down to the idea that we're the defective ones. 

With how anti-male the culture is in America, its easy to succumb to the notion that there is something wrong with you if American women treat you like shit. I think the PUA rhetoric enforces this idea as well. 

Its good to groom and take care of yourself. Absolutely. This is common sense. But i think us leaving in greater numbers as a collective is a sign of real growth. By leaving, we are saying that there is a minimum threshold of treatment we will or will not accept from a prospective partner. 

People say ""Good riddance, don't let the door hit you on the way out..."" but the word will spread with time, even back to our home country that there is greener pastures. It may not be that way forever, but for now, travel does give you leverage and i think the ones that are doing this are the ones willing to evolve with the ever changing conditions. Lots of us were brainwashed as kids to believe everything here is the best, and its good to see more men waking up and smelling the coffee. 

At the end of the day, the women here will still do whatever they want. And really they should, i don't have much interest in changing their minds, but i'm interested to see what the US looks like in another 20, or 30 years if this trend continues.",4,1730167629.0,itsthatbad,2,1.0,False

I do not have a good relationship with one of my sisters due to her partner. I was my sisters maid of honor at her wedding to her partner where I did absolutely everything I could to make this day magical for them. I helped them pay for a couple things here or there and I also helped make some of the decorations in my spare time. My sister’s now wife, mother and sister-in-law are very manipulative. They have flipped stories to always make our family the bad guys in every situation. The mother and sister-in-law corner me and start screaming and calling me a c_^t and a b!tch for not having their departure planned and making their family looking like fools. I was so thrown off that I started to tear up and when they saw that they just kept going until my boyfriend came in and confronted them on what they are doing. They finally left me alone. We went back to the hotel and called it a night. I then got a text from my sister that we needed to talk before I left to go back home the next day after family breakfast. I met her down in the lobby for coffee where she then started to tell me the story about how her mother and sister-in-law came to her in tears last night claiming that my boyfriend and I verbally attacked them and called them a b!tch and a c_^t for not helping. This never happened. She walked away and went straight to her wife and did not talk to me the rest of the time I was there even though I tried to talk to her multiple times. 
It has been 3 years and I have not talked to my sister since the morning after her wedding.
Anyways back to why I might be an asshole….. I was talking to my mother about my hypothetical wedding party and the friends that I want in it. She then proceeded to get upset that I don’t have my sisters in the wedding party. I told her i just want my friends and that’s it, no siblings.

Now there is a definition for the Persistent portion that went into effect on 6/25/24. 

(ii) Willful and persistent misconduct.  For purposes of this section, instances of minor misconduct occurring within two years of each other are persistent; an instance of minor misconduct occurring within two years of more serious misconduct is persistent; and instances of more serious misconduct occurring within five years of each other are persistent. For purposes of this section, minor misconduct is misconduct for which the maximum sentence imposable pursuant to the Manual for Courts-Martial United States would not include a dishonorable discharge or confinement for longer than one year if tried by general court-martial.

With this new definition I believe I am now eligible for benefit’s. I received an article 15 for Malingering and disobeying a direct order to quit smoking and drinking coffee. When I went before the Captain he dropped the disobeying charged and found me guilty for malingering.   Busted me down in rank and took half a months pay for two months and recommended me for OTH. I appealed and lost and was put out with the OTH.  Leading up to this I was never in trouble. I was recommended for Seaman to Admiral program on multiple evals. I qualified all every watch available to me including earning my dolphins in 6 months. I made E-5 in exactly 25 months and 3 days. I was a damn good sailor. 

My question is, based on the definition above what is classified as an incident?  Would my dropped charge of disobeying a direct order count even though the captain dropped it?

His cheeks were flushed, his dimples on full display. When he noticed Detective Addison he quickly said goodbye and hung up. He poured himself a cup of coffee without making eye contact. 

""Who has you so happy this morning Rookie?"" Detective Addison asked smiling teasingly. 

""Oh, um it's nothing like that. I was just talking to Briana... I was apologizing for not being able to stay with her at the hospital."" Joseph explained putting two packets of sugar into his coffee. 

""Ummhmm, all that smiling and blushing for that conversation eh?"" Detective Addison responded pouring coffee into his mug. 

""Oh, she said something funny... She's a funny young woman."" Joseph replied sipping his coffee. 

""I'm sure. She's also our witness in an active case...be careful Rookie."" Detective Addison replied sipping his black coffee. 

""Yeah, I know...career suicide."" Joseph replied sadly. 

Detective Addison looked at Joseph's gloomy expression. ""Let's solve this case fast Rookie...then she won't be a witness anymore...you get my drift?"" He said walking away. 

Joseph smiled and followed him out of the break room to their desks where they were met by Marcie from computer forensics. Marcie stood at 5'6"" and was deeply tanned. Her light brown hair hung in a ponytail that reached the middle of her back. She wore thin rimmed rose gold glasses that covered her bright brown eyes. She was narrow but shapely. She held a large computer pad in her manicured hands and smiled at them brightly though she looked exhausted with dark circles under her eyes. 

""Hello Detective Addison, Detective Ramirez. I've found something on your skinning suspect."" She said in a deep southern accent. 

Detective Addison and Joseph took their seats. ""Great, what did you find?"" Detective Addison asked. 

Marcie tuned the pad around and tapped on it bringing up multiple pages of information."" She started explaining.

""I looked into Samuel Barletta's old city and found out that a month before his ""suicide,"" multiple cases of fromaldehyde was stolen from his old job and a chemical manufacturing plant nearby. I was also able to contact one of my online informants involved in the illegal drug trade side of the dark web and found that a supplier that goes by the handle ""No-1"" sold some guy in this city $6,000 worth of Rocuronium last year, $3,000 in one transaction and $3,000 in the second transaction ."" She said seriously. 

""Damn, I guess both you and Phil were right!"" Joseph said. 

""I was also able to look up who the land the hideaway is on belongs to. The owner is a William Golighty...However, the only William Golighty that lived in this city died in 1987."" Marcie said pulling up a death certificate of William Golighty. 

""Well there's our false identity..."" Detective Addison said staring intently at the tablet. 

""I ran ""William Golighty's name through the system and found he registered a black Infiniti Q50 this year and had utilities cut on for a small bungalow in the Selan Woods area."" She said smiling. 

""Hot damn!"" Detective Addison said jumping from his chair. 

""Anything else on this ""Golighty""?"" Joseph asked sitting up excitedly.

""Yes, he apparently worked for a year, part time as a veterinarian assistant right outside the city before abruptly quitting. I have the contact info for his old employer here."" Marcie said strolling up on the tablet. 

""Marcie! Damn it, you're good!"" Detective Addison shouted causing Marcie to laugh. 

""I'm happy you appreciate my efforts. I stayed up late researching all of this. I haven't even gone home yet.."" She replied smiling weakly. 

""Thank you so much!"" Joseph said smiling at Marcie. 

""Marcie, let's go and brief the Captain, rookie, you call ""Mr. Golighty's"" old job and get a description. If this is our guy, we possibly know where he lives now. His days of freedom are numbered."" Detective Addison said aggressively. 

He and Marcie walked briskly towards Captain Finnegan's office as Joseph dialed the number to Paw Paw Veterinary Clinic. He introduced himself to a kind male receptionist and briefly explained the information he needed to know. The receptionist was new but happily placed him on the phone with a veterinary tech named Ashton Clarke who described William as a highly skilled and competent veterinary assistant, however, he was weird and distant. Joseph asked for his physical description and and felt an instant feeling of elation. William was described as a young man in his 30's, dirty blonde hair with piercing blue eyes. 

Andreas hands started shaking. All he could do was look at the coffee spread in his fluffy, cream colored carpet. 

""How dare you call me?! How did you get this number?!"" Andreas demanded in a quivering voice.

""Oh, is that anyway to greet family after six years. You should be happy to hear from me Andreas."" 

""Happy...I know what you've been doing you sick bastard! The police are looking for you as we speak!"" Andreas yelled angrily. 

""Hahahaha, you make human art and I make human art cousin. Or do you still think you're better than me?!"" 

""What you're doing is MURDER! Don't compare yourself to me, ever! We're nothing alike."" Andres replied angrily, his hand shaking violently. 

""You're still as pompous as ever Andreas. It doesn't matter anymore. You're going to help me get what I need."" 

""Help you?! You're crazier than I thought! I'm calling the police!"" Andreas said hanging up. 

With shaking hands he gripped his phone tightly and prepared to dial 911 until he realized the cop across the street was quicker. He ran to his balcony doors when his phone dinged. He looked down to see that a message was sent by the private number. He nervously opened it and his stomach dropped, his mouth went dry as he fell to his knees. On his phone was a photo of an unconscious Mona, lying motionless on a surgical table in a dimly lit room. His phone rang again, the caller ID reading, ""Private"" once more. He answered it grabbing a handful of carpet with his free hand.

""I see you got the photo...if you contact the police I'll make you a single parent, understand?"" 

""Why are you doing this Samuel?!"" Andreas asked desperately.

""DON'T CALL ME THAT! Samuel died six years ago! He was loser who couldn't live out his dreams remember? I'm living out my dreams now cousin."" 

""Please don't hurt Mona, she's never done anything to you. She was always kind to you!"" Andreas pleaded. 

""Don't worry, she's not my type, too freckly. Her skin isn't perfect enough for me. She's not what I need Andreas. You're going to help me get what I need!"" 

""What is it you ""need""?!"" Andreas asked desperately, tears rolling down his face. 

""I want you to bring me the bitch that got away.""

1gejpma,https://www.reddit.com/r/ostomy/comments/1gejpma/revealing_ostomy_status_while_noncasual_dating/,Revealing Ostomy status while non-casual dating ,"I've looked in the archives of this community and haven't exactly found a thread with my situation, so here goes:

I'm M63, 1 year post APR and permanent colostomy.  My wife and I split up a little over a month ago. I signed up for a couple dating sites. I don't mention my ostomate status on the profile, because I'm not solely looking for romantic relationships.  I'm interested in meeting women as friends and companions for mutual activities: movies, dining out, having good conversation, etc.  You have to walk before you can run, right? 

I've met a woman on the site and had a coffee date and immediately hit it off and had great, deep conversation. Since then, we talk or text virtually every day and when we do, it's like > 1 hour.  We had already planned a 2nd date, before the nightly phone calls. Now she says she wants me to meet her parents and she thinks about me when she goes to bed and when she gets up. I sense things are escalating and I tell her that I am attracted to her but I respect the pace that she wants to proceed with the relationship, which she says ""really wants to get to know someone."" 

Here is where I think I made a mistake.  Although she hasn't yet said she wants to be physical in the relationship and therefore see me naked, I told her that she should know about my Ostomy and some physical side effects of the APR and the original cancer surgery in 2013.  I felt that if this was a dealbreaker to moving to a physical relationship, she ought to know now. Now I am having regret that I released that information too soon.  I told her that I did not expect to escalate the relationship to be physical, but I was forwarding her. So far, her response has indicated compassion and support for my health journey and that she wants to continue seeing me at the current pace. 

My question to other guys: With a woman you are dating with whom you feel a deep affection for, but haven't yet made the mutual decision to proceed to a sexual relationship, would you reveal your Ostomy status?  This is NOT casual dating and not the sexual relationship of a couple already married.  It's about mutual passion that is still trying to figure out where we are taking this.  Is revealing the Ostomy status prior to the absolute ""need to know"" point a bad idea? 

TL;DR-  When to reveal Ostomy status to a woman with whom you have blazing relationship that is not yet sexual.

It's like watching two siblings fight over the last slice of pizza; you know it's going to be intense, but also kind of funny.

Seattle Sounders have been as consistent as a metronome this season, finishing with 57 points. They're playing at home, where they have the advantage of not having to deal with airport security or hotel pillows that feel like bricks. Meanwhile, Houston Dynamo, with 54 points, have been strong but are entering the lion's den at Lumen Field.

The odds are as delicious as a Seattle coffee. The Sounders are favored with prices around 2.2 to 2.3, while the Dynamo are the underdogs with odds ranging from 3.65 to 4.7. A draw is priced between 2.35 and 2.85, which is tempting if you think both teams will play like they're allergic to scoring.

Given that underdogs win about 41% of the time in soccer, and considering the Dynamo's odds, there's a cheeky value bet on Houston. But let's not kid ourselves—Seattle at home is like a bear with a sore head. They're tough to beat.

So, my best bet? Take Seattle Sounders to win at 2.2 odds. But if you're feeling adventurous and have a penchant for chaos, sprinkle a little on the Dynamo. After all, who doesn't love a good underdog story, especially when it comes with a side of spicy odds?",1,1730167120.0,GPTSportsWriter,0,1.0,False

**Location**: New Zealand  
Giving this one last try before exploring other ways to meet someone. I’d rather meet someone on my own terms. Putting in a lot of detail this time.

**Occupation**:  
I’m a qualified accountant running my own small tax firm. I’m also working with my family on a women’s clothing brand in Pakistan, co-own a small e-commerce business, and have invested in a new venture. The reason I do so much is that I want to get to the point where I can choose what I do for work because it interests me and not just for money. Want that freedom for my family too. So putting in the effort now for a better future.

**Family**:  
I have four brothers and three sisters, all married with kids. Most of us are in New Zealand or Australia. Family is relaxed and bit more on the liberal side.

**Religion**:  
I’m a Sunni Muslim and pray regularly.

**Living Situation**:  
I live on a farmhouse with my own space but plan to get an apartment in the city for a balance between city life during the week and farm life on weekends.

**About Me**:  
I’m calm, laid-back, and a bit of an introvert. I usually keep to myself but I am fun once you get to know me. My work with clients has taught me patience, empathy, and how to be a good listener. My work is chaotic so outside of it I seek peaceful things: coffee by the ocean, walks in nature, or a spontaneous road trip. Loyalty is important to me; I’ll go all in for the people I care about. I’m also great with kids—I’ve helped raise my nieces and nephews.

**Kids**: I’d like to have kids whenever the time is right.

**Why I’m Not Married Yet**:  
Get asked this a lot - My mom passed away a while back, and my dad needs a bit of help with these things.

**Hobbies**:

* **Gym**: I’m big on fitness and even studied to be a personal trainer before my accounting career took over. I built a home gym, so if you want a free personal trainer, let me know!
* **Cooking:** I got into cooking through meal prepping for the gym, and it turns out I really enjoy it. It’s calming, and I’ve started experimenting with Western, Japanese, and Chinese dishes. I love cooking for the whole family from time to time, and I can’t live without my coffee machine
* **Animals**: I have a soft spot for animals and take care of quite a few on the farm.
* **Movies/Games**: I’m a bit of a nerd and enjoy movies and gaming. My PlayStation doesn’t get much use these days.

**Ethnicity/Caste**: If this is something you care about, we’re probably not the right match.

**What I’m Looking For**:  
I’m hoping to meet someone educated—your career path doesn’t matter too much. Ideally, you’re in your mid-to-late 20s. Attraction is important to me in a relationship.

**My Ideal Relationship**:  
I’m looking for someone with her own life and ambitions. You’ll have the freedom to do what you want—I trust you’ll make the right calls, and I’m not interested in keeping tabs. I want a genuine partnership based on trust.",2,1730167059.0,PakistanRishta,1,0.75,False

University is hard, but your entire life does not have to revolve around working and studying. You're all doing great, but you need to learn to help each other out, support each other and lighten their load. Maybe then more people will be able to smile and be energetic. Also, if you ever see anyone crying on campus. PLEASE, PLEASE, PLEASE sit with them, talk to them, ask them what's up and be there for them in their time of need.

1gejkqw,https://www.reddit.com/r/AppIdeas/comments/1gejkqw/teambased_territory_game_for_irl_meetup_groups_to/,Team-based territory game for IRL meetup groups to earn sponsorships,"Been in the community space for 8 years, built small and large groups (20 to 10k); every single community founder will tell you it was hard to build up their group. Much of that is because no one comes to their events even though hundreds join their Discord/Meetup org.

Really it comes down to **Is it valuable enough to show up to an event?**  
  
I have a few hypothesis: 

1. Gaming is the future of social networking
2. Loneliness will continue to increase without in-person connection
3. The effort needed to be an active member of an IRL community will increase
4. We can reduce the effort to be a part of an IRL community through gaming

So to incentivize meetups, I think it would be interesting to create an application where members can collaborate on earning sponsored meals for their events by checking into a business that offers a loyalty program. For example you and your group can check-in 100 times (once a day per person per business) for a pizza if Pizza Hut offers that as a reward.

There's a real-estate simulation piece I'm playing around with where you can earn coins for RSVP'ing to events and checking into random locations to purchase the actual buildings. When people (anonymously) check into those locations your community gets points towards their only loyalty program for that business.

I do sleep tho. If I'm in bed by 8, I'm sleep by 9-930. But when 445 comes, I struggle to get up.

 When I get home, I don't want to do anything.

So in the past the machine has told me when the carafe was not in place and wouldn’t let me start, but one hurried morning I didn’t put the carafe in and was surprised by 5 cups of coffee spilled all over my kitchen counter. Contacted Fellow and did some troubleshooting so far: 
- Firmware 1.2.4, up to date 
- I know Fellow lets you brew into other types of containers other than the carafe, I have exclusively used the carafe mostly on the batch setting 
- Except for one instance yesterday machine has continued to let me start brewing cycles without any container in place, can’t get the warning to appear since then (I know placing a magnet on the base would make the warning go away)
- Also correct me if I’m wrong but the machine would typically stop if you removed the carafe while brewing, also not happening, it just continues to spill water at the same rate (I did this troubleshooting with just water with the basket in place)

If it’s short answer, or problem-solving like OChem, then that’s what your preparation should be focused on. Figure out early the format of the “performance” and do as much faithfully simulated practice as possible. 



* I’ve found that active recall is king. Anki is a great tool to help with this and it’s effective for several people, although there’s a learning curve. In general, I even found myself recalling even on tests how the conversation went with myself and others I’ve studied with, and that led me to landing on the right answer.

He's been telling our common friends that he likes me and that I’m his “ideal girl” for the past 2 years and nagpareto din sya before but I turned down kasi fresh from breakup pa ko and not ready to date yet. Now, the past 2 months, nagka chance kami magkausap because of tennis but just when I thought we'd develop into something more, biglang naging parang cold sya? 

What I tried so far: Si guy started chatting me when he learned na I'm starting to play tennis. He would invite me to play whenever uuwi sya sa hometown (based na sya sa Manila and umuuwi every week or so) namin but hindi natutuloy. Yung 4th time that he asked me I felt bad na ituturn down ko nanaman sya so sabi ko mag coffee nalang kami if free pa sya later that day. Natuloy kami, that was the first time na nagkausap kami ng matagal and na kaming dalawa lang. It went well kasi I enjoyed naman and we chatted pa til bedtime pagkauwi. He was the first to text me after we parted ways sa cafe to update me pa na he got home na. 

Now, what I’m confused about is that 2 weeks since the coffee hangout, hindi na kami nagkakausap ulit. We don’t chat everyday kasi busy din naman kami but I was expecting na at least katulad before na we talk a few days in a week. Lalo na nakikita ko naman na online sya palagi. I also believe I gave him signals na that I’m open to dating if he ever asks me again. Ngayon, our only interaction was yung paglalike nya sa stories ko. Tapos the other day, he went home sa town namin na hindi nya namention sakin. Before kasi, he messages me days in advance pag uuwi sya to check if available ako but ngayon wala. Ineexpect ko kasi we’ll have another coffee hangout or something like it kasi napag usapan pa namin na we’ll check another coffee place next time. Pero wala, ako pa nga nauna mag message kasi I asked about sa something tapos nangamusta sya after nung bagyo and nagkwenta na naglaro sila ng friend namin, na non lang sya nakauwi since nung nag coffee kami, and that he’ll be busy until the end of the month. 

What advice I need: What should I do in this situation? We’re both 30 na and I don’t like to play this game anymore. Sana hindi nalang nya ko kinulit kung walang intention kasi peaceful naman life ko before. Haha. Yun lang, would appreciate any advice. ",4,1730166343.0,adviceph,23,1.0,False

Specifically keeping your house clean and stuff. I have this dream where I’m one of those girls who wakes up, makes my bed, meditates, walks out into my clean kitchen to make some coffee, etc. 

The reality is more like wake up, stumble out to the couch, scroll on phone, realize I now don’t have time for breakfast, hurry and brush teeth get dressed and leave and then when I get home I eat something quick and don’t have the motivation to clean the pans so I tell myself I’ll do it in the morning. Eventually, my house is an effing disaster and I pretty much only make my bed 2-4 times a month when I wash the sheets. 

I tend to find I’m most productive on my adderall but I’m out of it as my prescriber moved, or when someone is coming over, or when I body double. But I live alone and kinda remote so it’s really rare someone comes out to me. 

I’ve tried alarms, checklists, journal/schedule, positive reinforcement, routine apps and I can not, for the life of me, keep it together. 

Please please tell me you guys have some neuro-hacks to transform me into a gets-shit-done-bitch because when I DO have the house clean (adderall or visitor) I feel SO AMAZING AND HAPPY and I want to feel that every day instead of the internal screaming at the state of things as I sit on my couch watching TV but stressing incessantly about the things I need to do.

I actually did my undergrad here at Emory. With the clinical hours and expectation to still study for end-of-rotation exams during the day, I’ve been looking to hone in on proven, straightforward study strategies that have really helped me in the past and now, as a way of also paying it forward to premed students who will get to this point down the line. Would love the help of premed students in filling out this list!



* I’m a big fan of practicing like you perform. If the test consists of multiple-choice-questions, you have to practice with multiple-choice-questions to know where you stand. If it’s short answer, or problem-solving like OChem, then that’s what your preparation should be focused on. Figure out early the format of the “performance” and do as much faithfully simulated practice as possible. 



* I’ve found that active recall is king. Anki is a great tool to help with this and it’s effective for several people, although there’s a learning curve. In general, I even found myself recalling even on tests how the conversation went with myself and others I’ve studied with, and that led me to landing on the right answer. 



* Creating an environment with “productive discomfort” has helped me significantly. For me this looks like a study cubicle in our student center with a thermos of coffee, bottle of water, headphones, and a fidget spinner.. Along with my study materials of course, lol. The act of driving there on a cold morning, setting up shop, and it being just the wrong temperature focuses my mind.  



Are you all fans of these strategies? Let me know your favorite strategies as a premed student how you optimize your studying! And if you’d like to chat more, feel free to dm me.

Not in pain or anything, but unironiclly everyone around me was worried I was actually dying. It took over 6-7 months of decline into severe disability for me to get referred to a nurologist for it, only for him to dismiss my every concern and make me cry for thinking it. He left off with ""sorry you're not going to get your diagnosis of MS you wanted"" and shuffled me out a side door to keep other paitents from seeing ms. I only brought MS up at the appointment because 3 seprate doctors suggested that it could be the issue and I needed to see a nurologist immediately. Found out he only has 1☆ on Google after the visit. Great, no wonder. I'm now trying to go to a diffrent nurologist because the symptoms are starting to return again and I don't want to feel like I'm dying. I thought maybe i could skirt by and it'd never happen again. But I was wrong and I hate myself for thinking it would be okay. So I call a new nurologist (nuro surgeon as the only nurologist in my city is the 1☆ guy) to schedule a visit and they say to send over the previous results and a pcp referral and they'll see me. These guys are 4.5☆ so I had a lot of hope on getting this fixed with them. So I download the notes the doctor left just to see he diagnosed me with fucking amnesia and lied about the situation entirely. Saying some of the main concerns I had gone in for I denied having and said I came in for ""generalized weakness"" instead of cognitive decline and other issues. I'm devastated that he'd just lie in the notes, not even that the visit was bad, it's that he fucked me over even in the notes.


I'm terrified of that feeling, I don't want to feel like im dying. I slept 12+ hours a day and I was petrified that every time would be my last. I'm trying higher and higher doses of Adderall, more coffee, energy drinks, and when I can't increase it artifically I thought it was sleep. So I did melatonin, a new pillow, white noise, even trazadone. I'm so exhausted for no reason and I'm messing up my words again and losing cordination.


All I can do is ask my pcp to maybe send some notes with the referral as he saw me at my worst and was one of the 3 who thought I had it. Just sobbing at this point.",5,1730165984.0,disability,6,1.0,False

1geixq0,https://www.reddit.com/r/IWantToLearn/comments/1geixq0/iwtl_how_to_meet_people_for_potential/,IWTL How to meet people for potential relationships without college (23M),"Hear me out, I'll start off by saying that I know this might be popular question. I've looked at some of them and maybe have an idea but if you care for a long read I'll try to be specific about my situation. Although this is generally about meeting people, I think I'm currently focusing a bit more on the dating aspect.

I'm a 23-year-old guy living in SoCal. The main reason for my lack of connections is the fact that I took a very untraditional path with my education after high school. After graduating, I spent most of my time pursuing education/work online and only spent a few months in a in-person college. After getting laid off my tech job I've spent the past year grinding through an online university to get my bachelors within a year. Most if not all of my friends are people I've known online for about 6-10 years. I've never really felt lonely until I started thinking about how I've almost unintentionally been chronically online. I honestly don't think I lack the social skills to keep a conversation going, it's more about the opportunities and approaching part. I've been complimented on my looks being even better than my pictures and I like to think I'm at least average in appearance.

I've been trying to put myself out there more. I try to study outside at cafes multiple times a week; I sometimes visit random smaller events like farmers' markets and have spontaneously done stuff like finally visiting a rave/bar for the first time this past year. Problem being is none of these really lead to any socializing and it doesn't really feel natural besides stuff like chatting to sellers at booths. I've heard of the site meetup and I figured there should be a lot of events here in Cali/OC but they seem to generally be for people older than me. For some reason I also might have a weird perception of people using meetup, especially the singles/mixers events (I know I can't judge though). I also don't think I'd connect really well with people at places like bars, combining the fact that I don't like to drink.

I tell myself that dating apps are probably the solution, but I've recently learned that it's probably not for me either. My view of dating apps has been mostly skewed into it being a platform for hookups which discourages me from trying to pursue something real from it. The whole experience just feels very empty. But the thing is some of the people I've strictly met for hookups were the ones I've actually connected to the most on a personal/emotional level. I think it's because skipping all the small talk and upping the pacing of everything just lead to a deeper connection. Experiencing this is what sort of changed me from only wanting fun to wanting something serious.

As a full-time student these are the options I have in mind with some following thoughts:

* Pick up a part-time job that might allow me to socialize at least a little bit (coffee shop, boba shop, trader joes, idk). This would really only be me socializing with coworkers though.
* The widely mentioned one... finding meetups or hobbies to pursue. This is honestly weirdly difficult for me. For meetups specific to the meetup site I can't find stuff that are interesting AND consist of people close to my age.
* Picking up a pottery/language/drawing/cooking class but these are all paid classes I'd have to think about. Probably would be done at a local community college.
* I'm not religious, but I also wonder if a more modern and social church is a potential opportunity too.
* Volunteering at an animal shelter or preservation garden.

My friends tell me that I shouldn't stress about these things and let it come to me, but I try to think objectively and tell myself that not having natural opportunities means I need to put in some effort.

tl;dr: school, work, and friends were all online which led to the lack of in person connections. dating apps are seen as a hookup app for me. meetups related to hobbies are weirdly difficult to find and have interest in. where do I organically make nice friends and find a potential partner? my growing age and lack of social opportunities is starting to daunt over me.",2,1730164932.0,IWantToLearn,2,0.76,False

I want to study Mechanical Engineering, I’m from South Bend, IN so Notre Dame would be my #1 choice but I don’t have anywhere close to the stats for that. Purdue is also probably impossible. Indiana University would probably admit me but their college of engineering doesn’t have mechanical engineering as an option. 

I’m thinking my best bet is to pick a state, move there as soon as possible to establish residency then apply to all of their public colleges with an engineering college for in-state tuition once I have lived and worked there long enough. Does anyone have any experience moving to a new state for in-state tuition? What are some of the easiest public colleges to get residency in?

I've looked at some of them and maybe have an idea but if you care for a long read I'll try to be specific about my situation. Although this is generally about meeting people, I think I'm currently focusing a bit more on the dating aspect.

I'm a 23-year-old guy living in SoCal. The main reason for my lack of connections is the fact that I took a very untraditional path with my education after high school. After graduating, I spent most of my time pursuing education/work online and only spent a few months in a in-person college. After getting laid off I've spent the past year grinding through an online university to get my bachelors within a year. Most if not all of my friends are people I've known online for about 6-10 years. I've never really felt lonely until I started thinking about how I've almost unintentionally been chronically online. I honestly don't think I lack the social skills to keep a conversation going, it's more about the opportunities and approaching part. I've been complimented on my looks being even better than my pictures and I like to think I'm at least average in appearance.

I've been trying to put myself out there more. I try to study outside at cafes multiple times a week; I sometimes visit random smaller events like farmers' markets and have spontaneously done stuff like finally visiting a rave/bar for the first time this past year. Problem being is none of these really lead to any socializing and it doesn't really feel natural besides stuff like chatting to sellers at booths. I've heard of the site meetup and I figured there should be a lot of events here in Cali/OC but they seem to generally be for people older than me. For some reason I also might have a weird perception of people using meetup, especially the singles/mixers events (I know I can't judge though). I also don't think I'd connect really well with people at places like bars, combining the fact that I don't like to drink.

I tell myself that dating apps are probably the solution, but I've recently learned that it's probably not for me either. My view of dating apps has been mostly skewed into it being a platform for hookups which discourages me from trying to pursue something real from it. The whole experience just feels very empty. But the thing is some of the people I've strictly met for hookups were the ones I've actually connected to the most on a personal/emotional level. I think it's because skipping all the small talk and upping the pacing of everything just lead to a deeper connection. Experiencing this is what sort of changed me from only wanting fun to wanting something serious.   
  
As a full-time student these are the options I have in mind with some following thoughts: 

* Pick up a part-time job that might allow me to socialize at least a little bit (coffee shop, boba shop, trader joes, idk). This would really only be me socializing with coworkers though.
* The widely mentioned one... finding meetups or hobbies to pursue. This is honestly weirdly difficult for me. For meetups specific to the meetup site I can't find stuff that are interesting AND consist of people close to my age. 
* Picking up a pottery/language/drawing/cooking class but these are all paid classes I'd have to think about. Probably would be done at a local community college.
* I'm not religious, but I also wonder if a more modern and social church is a potential opportunity too. 
* Volunteering at an animal shelter or preservation garden.

My friends tell me that I shouldn't stress about these things and let it come to me, but I try to think objectively and tell myself that not having natural opportunities means I need to put in some effort.

tl;dr: school, work, and friends were all online which led to the lack of in person connections. dating apps are seen as a hookup app for me. meetups related to hobbies are weirdly difficult to find and have interest in. where do I organically make nice friends and find a potential partner? my growing age and lack of social opportunities is starting to daunt over me.",0,1730164268.0,NoStupidQuestions,3,0.5,False

I haven’t done this in a while - or ever, really - but I wanted to share my journals from the BCU’s recent big trip. Normally I’d think “well I shouldn’t spoil it, they’ll find out when the videos release”, but that’s actually pretty silly; it’s like hearing an elevator pitch vs. watching a movie. I also want to give a look behind the scenes of our lovely, tenacious, chaotic little group of good-hearted creatives.

First I’ll answer the question you didn’t actually ask: **Why Japan?** I decided I wanted to ship the lot of us out there about 3 months ago, and when the idea first came to me, the destination was almost arbitrary. I had always wanted to visit Japan, but if I’m being honest, not enough to brave a 15-hour flight. Within 24 hours of having the idea, however, I found myself announcing it to the crew, to my own amazement as much as theirs. There’s a few obvious reasons to visit Japan - the food, the culture, the scale, the spectacle - but in retrospect I realized that, moreover, it was about inspiration. Last year, we all spent a few days together out on Long Island, and even that little summertime escapade was enough to get our minds thinking and our hearts racing in new directions (our “fake movies” made amidst the SAG-AFTRA strikes were one of the many direct results of this brief change in environment). Creativity labors under the weight of routine, and while our jobs are stuff of dreams, even dreams can become routine. I wanted to push us as far outside our comfort zones as humanly possible, in a place that’s safe and navigable, where we wouldn’t need to know the language or risk life and limb. I wanted to kick us so hard out of our mental and creative patterns that there’d be no going back.

All told, we’re going to have something like 10 Japan episodes releasing in the coming months. From the dizzying height of fine dining to the scraped bottom of a 7/11 fruit cup, we explored a wide swath of Tokyo and Kyoto, though we obviously didn’t even scratch the surface. In spite of it being one of my most basic job descriptions, I didn’t take pictures of absolutely *everything* we saw and did, but I’ll do my best to share some visuals throughout the entries. We'll also be including a triptych of the various restaurants and experiences along with the videos when they're published. This is effectively my personal journal, minus the drippy self-therapy and recurring dreams about bugs I’m afraid of. I hope you enjoy it!

**Day 1**

All told, there are nine of us headed to Japan - [Sawyer, Brad, Kendall, Alvin, Steve, Nico, Tony, Sylvie, and myself](https://i.imgur.com/Rv1YxAT.jpeg) - arriving on different dates, on different flights, occasionally staying at different hotels in different districts. Sawyer, Brad and myself are on the final flight out, so our touchdown will mark the entire BCU’s arrival in Japan. This journey will also serve as the auspicious farewell to Kendall who, with her husband Theo, will be moving to Australia for several months following the trip. They even have all their baggage in tow, and after a stint in Singapore, will be headed straight for the land down under. 

I was lucky enough to fly business class on Japan Airlines, which was nothing short of a pleasure: the seat is less of a seat and [more of a cubicle](https://i.imgur.com/nwPN38T.jpeg), with lie-flat capability, a 42” screen, and an a la carte menu available the whole flight. So when I arrived in Japan around 5PM, I was understandably fresh as a daisy, having watched three movies, having slept three hours, and having had three meals. With those awake and adjusted enough to join me, we headed for [Okachimachi Market in Ueno](https://i.imgur.com/d8JfBtp.jpeg), which felt like everything I had imagined about Japan concentrated into a few crowded alleyways: a train roaring overhead, boisterous salarymen, neon lights, paper lanterns, and vendors ranging from izakayas to pornographic t-shirts to New Balance shoes. We bopped around two of the former, first for [yakisoba](https://i.imgur.com/QycwAwL.jpeg), next for [yakitori](https://i.imgur.com/7HvGoKf.jpeg), slurping and chomping and swigging beer all the while. We didn’t want to tempt the jet lag gods, so we retired to our tiny hotel rooms by 8PM, determined to adjust as quickly as possible. Our first shoot, after all, is tomorrow morning.

**Day 2**

Thanks to my doctor-prescribed medication, even in a bed the same dimensions as my body, I slept like a cherub angel. It turned out that our first shoot location, a Michelin-starred ramen spot, didn’t open until 11, so I had plenty of time to go for a morning walk. I quickly happened upon Ueno Park, which made for a great wander, and gave me my first glimpses of the many temples that dot the cityscape. On the way back to the hotel, I spotted Cafe Lapin, an adorable coffee shop and breakfast nook, where the weathered coffee masters tinker with boiling kettles and decades-old china behind the service counter. I tried my hand at the little Japanese I had picked up, instantly failed, and resorted to Google Translate to ask him for [a cup of his favorite roast](https://i.imgur.com/wFj53sE.jpeg). Upon finishing the carefully-brewed pour-over, my declaration of “umai” (delicious, a term I learned from Samurai Gourmet) garnered a hearty laugh from the brewer.

The ramen restaurant, Japanese Soba Noodle Tsuta, was in Shibuya - a place I had heard was a bustling shopping central of Tokyo - which surprised me when it initially appeared to be residential. [We joined the line waiting for the noodle shop to open](https://i.imgur.com/e2CWDZD.jpeg), and our gracious hostess set us up in a corner where we could film the ramen chefs at work. I was initially taken aback by two factors: first, their opting for buckwheat soba noodles in ramen. Second, their use of haute cuisine trappings like foams and powders, [all in a bowl of ramen hardly costing $12](https://i.imgur.com/59KUu0t.jpeg). It might’ve been my first ramen in Japan, but it was the best I’d ever had in my life, and I quickly found the bottom of the bowl. There were a few Japanese characters printed there which, when I asked their meaning, turned out to be the name of the restaurant’s head chef, who had died tragically only a few years ago. The hostess explained that the whole restaurant stood as a memorial to his work.

Being our first shoot of the trip, it was the only shoot for the day, so we headed into Shibuya proper. It was every bit as chaotic as described, with high-fashion boutiques flanking 10-story dollar stores, and of course, the busiest intersection in the world. We climbed to a park situated on top of a skyscraper, and immediately, about half of us could feel that we were crashing. We headed back to the hotel while the other half shopped and sight-saw, but before I could rest, I realized that I needed to record a single line of voice-over. I had packed a portable Yeti Mini microphone, for which I realized I didn’t have a USB-A-to-C adapter. I figured that, being in Japan, I’d make short work of that issue, but to my amazement, it took nearly 2 hours to find such an adapter. Even 7/11’s carried almost every imaginable iteration of USB adapter (C-to-A, lightning-to-C, even fucking micro-to-C), except the one I needed. Eventually I found Yodobashi Camera, a behemoth electronics store that puts B&H to shame, at the north end of Okachimachi Market. I hoofed it back to the hotel, recorded the single line of VO, and practically slammed myself asleep.

**Day 3**

After a delicious Japanese-style breakfast ([vegetable curry, rolled omelette, miso soup, steamed yam and pickled vegetables](https://i.imgur.com/JMJI7pd.jpeg)) in the hotel’s top-floor cafe, we headed for the first half of today’s shoot: a conveyor-belt sushi restaurant in Okachimachi, where I would attempt to rank as many different sushis as I could handle. It was perilously noisy and carried a 90-minute time limit, but I managed to put away [27 different nigiri](https://i.imgur.com/6snpxaM.jpeg), from simple to completely batshit crazy (salmon belly with camembert and pesto?!). They had horse on the menu, but we opted to skip it.

[Next up was Ueno station](https://i.imgur.com/WlEajgR.jpeg), where we would begin our vending machine ranking episode. It was luckily drinks to start, as I hardly even had room for liquids after the amount of sushi I had just consumed, but the 20K steps helped ameliorate the damage from lunch. Eventually we started incorporating foods, primarily hot soups, which ranged from delicious to despicable. Even though I was on the verge of exploding, I accompanied the team to [a century-old noodle house](https://i.imgur.com/JtXGKKF.jpeg), where I was coerced into ordering one of their large platters of hand-sliced soba. They, along with their delicious [concentrated dipping mushroom consommé](https://i.imgur.com/b7rreoD.jpeg), were so delicious that I still managed to clean the plate. In spite of the steps under my belt, Sawyer and I wanted to check out the flagship Yodobashi Camera in Shibuya, whose size beggared belief: 9 floors, what looked like 25k square feet each, packed to the gills with everything from hand-crafted speakers to golf clubs. There was even a driving range and batting cage on the roof, but we were too toasted to try it out - instead, we walked back to Ueno, [but unfortunately just as the rain began](https://i.imgur.com/hcdSHqU.jpeg). A pair of drowned rats, we were delighted to find that the hotel’s rooftop cafe had a free sake tasting, and reveled in hot cups of the stuff with Brad as we toasted to a trip that’s already a singularly amazing experience. Tomorrow, we head for Hakone.

I spent the night thinking about Ian and our life together.  Early on, it was truly exciting.  Every weekend was special.  We’d hike, bike or ATV to these incredible locations and spend our weekends talking, laughing and making love.  My Instagram became a staple of office talk.  People would stop me in the hallways or ask to take me to lunch just to talk about my pictures and find out where I was.  If you ever get a chance to experience a sunrise or sunset at the top of a mountain with a clear calm lake reflecting all the fantastic colors, then you will know what magic looks like.  Ian introduced me to a world that I would have never seen otherwise. 

He was everything I needed emotionally and physically.  My cup was full there and I think I gave him the same.  It was intellectually where I needed something more.  When Ian was growing up exploring the mountains, I was reading.  I loved thrillers, fantasy, romance and the classics.  He had no interest in any of it.  If it wasn’t for the shop, I’m sure I would have started to get frustrated a bit.  I’ve mentioned all the work that was done to turn it around and make it a business.  It made me feel so empowered to be allowed to make decisions and have the support of both Ian and TJ.

Creating systems and processes for a business is very easy in your head.  It’s implementation where everything goes to shit.  If the people that are involved in executing the system or process aren’t responsive, it will fail.  I’ve been privileged in my job to be exposed to some of the most sophisticated information systems on our planet, but none of that would have worked for the shop.  The boys insisted on cash because the few times that their dad ever took cheques, they bounced.  It was a hard rule for them, and no amount of logic was going to change it.  They refused credit cards because no big corporation was going to take 2.5 to 3% of their money.  They only allowed e-transfers and debit because the bank gave us the machine, so it didn’t cost anything.  They hated keyboards and didn’t want to pay for a scanning system, so manual work orders and handwritten receipts.  It was all so archaic to me, but we made it all work.

I’m trained to look for deficiencies in systems and processes that could lead to incorrect information.  I’m not trained in fraud detection or prevention.  I shouldn’t feel so bad about this situation, but I can’t help it.  It was around 2 years ago now when Ian first brought up starting to buy and sell used vehicles.  Both TJ and I were a bit worried about the cash investment, but he promised to start slow.  We made a budget that only reflected the reinvestment of sales back into purchases.  Basically, he couldn’t buy more vehicles until he's sold the existing ones.  I forecast everything based upon industry norms for margins and turnover.  It looked like a slow, steady, not very intensive, profitable business segment.  We agreed to start with $30k and let Ian go to work.  He exceeded the forecast almost immediately, and I thought that we’d found Ian’s passion.  I wish my audit radar was on and not clouded.  I may have asked, how is he exceeding expectations?  I wonder if I would have noticed or found anything.

I showered this morning thinking about all of this.  How it was made possible by the fact that we have a safe full of cash, rather than depositing money daily.  This avoided any FinCEN or Fintrac notifications.  How our handwritten documents and manual filings allowed Ian to hide things.  How my absence from the day to day, made this fiasco so easy to maintain.  I feel duped and angry. 

That was my state of mind as I entered the elevator this morning.  The contrast in environments between the shop and my firm is incredible.  In the old days 300 people would probably take up five or six floors of a building.  We have two and a half.  At any given time, 50 to 65% of our office personnel are working from home.  It’s a hybrid environment where you have the choice to work anywhere you would like within reason.  There are sofa’s, comfy chairs, even lazy boy chairs that have USB and power connections.  There’s stand up tables or cubicles with sit down or stand-up desks.  On nice days, there’s a patio with all sorts of seating and table options.  All available on a first come first serve basis.  Managers and higher can book an office for privacy.  Of course, there are larger ‘partner level’ offices as well. 

I’ve always made a point of trying to be in the office.  I focused on my business career growth during weekdays, and I saw meeting other professionals face to face as a big part of that plan.  When you’re a regular, everyone starts to respect your location choice and leaves it alone.  I’m in the office about 200 days a year and I usually get the office that I like.  Alan on the other hand is only here about 50 days a year and it’s always an event when he is in the building.  He doesn’t use an office.  He takes one of the boardrooms and Daryl is always at the door.  Daryl is Alan’s executive secretary.  Everyone assumes that he’s his bodyguard as well.  If you want to visualize him just google ‘Terry Tate office linebacker’.  The videos are hilarious and that’s his nickname.  He’s truly a teddy bear though.

When I walked off the elevator I checked in at reception.  It’s the only way in or out that doesn’t trigger an alarm.  We have four receptionists, and I know them all.  Sue greeted me, saying “Hi Amanda, we didn’t expect you in today.”.  I said, “I know” while handing her a stack of files that had our used toy contracts from the shop.  She grabbed them and asked, “Timing?”.  I replied, “I’ll be leaving at about 10:30 and will need to take the files with me.”.  She said, “No problem”, while putting the files in a sealable bag and attaching a barcode sticker to it.  We are a paperless office.  All documents are handled in this way, they are scanned, and we get an email notification with a link to the documents.  We then pick up the originals at the front desk or they are mailed back to the source.  Sue then asked, “Your usual office?”.  I said, “Not today, I’m just here to meet with Alan for a bit.”.   She giggled and said, “Oh, so you’re one of the lucky ones.”, while smiling at her neighbor, Nancy.

Office gossip is a crazy thing.  Everything I’ve been thinking about the past 12 hours is along this same line.  People’s perception may be their reality, but it isn’t necessarily the truth, is it?  This f’n realization has been an epiphany for me.  48 hours ago, I was convinced that my husband was cheating on me.  Now I’m convinced that he’s a criminal.  I thought that Alan was this single available guy because everyone in the office believed that he was.  Not once was it mentioned that he was married or a father.  Everyone gets so excited when he’s here.  The young people talk about seeing him, Daryl or one of his high-profile clients like they’ve spotted a superhero.  Reception gets giddy like today.  He doesn’t have IG or FB.  We’ve all looked.  There are pictures of him online standing next to some band or athlete.  Daryl’s sometimes seen in the wings but there’s never been a woman at his arm.  I should have asked him if there was someone special in his life, but I didn’t, and I feel like a creep because I didn’t.  Just thank goodness I didn’t go to far and end up with him thinking that I’m some sort of office floozy.

Sue buzzed me through the door, and I went upstairs and towards the North end of the floor.  On the way there I pass various iterations of offices, open spaces with seats and coffee tables, and innovation areas.  The innovation areas are very cool to me.  They have these clear walls that are smart boards.  I’ve used them for team planning sessions and the boards capture what we write so that we have a record of the discussion.  It’s a useful tool to gain engagement from your team, when appropriate of course. 

I’ve always liked the North end because it feels so calm and nice.  It has a little buffet area that always stocked with various juices, soda, and milk on ice.  There’re also hot and cold snacks, it’s early so there’s breakfast sandwiches and cereal options.  We have one of these stations on each floor, but this one has a seating area with a view.  Daryl always stands at a high table near the door to the corner boardroom when Alan’s there.  He smiled at me when I walked up to him.  His voice is always so smooth.  He said that Alan and Jennifer will be ready for me in about 15 minutes.  He picked up on my confusion immediately, and followed up with, Jennifer Danforth is a forensic accountant from LA that flew in this morning.

I’ve added these past four paragraphs as I’ve been waiting.  I plan on heading to the shop after this meeting.  I’ll update when I can.

As always, thank you for your support.",12,1730163611.0,stories,12,0.94,False

This pretty much describes my low carb life  you can relate, then this is your low carb cookie recipe my friends.  #lazyketochocolateloversunite The shredded coconut in these Keto Chocolate Fudge Haystacks makes them chewy and cookie-like, and the nuts add a pleasant crunch and earthy flavor.  If you are allergic to nuts then you can certainly omit them, or if you have a specific nut preference, you can sub in your nut of  you're a fan of fruit and nut bars, you can throw in a couple of dried cranberries or cherries (or ewww, raisins) into these keto cookies, but be mindful of the extra carbs if you do.

So much so that we’re creating a study group together to build community and meeting for coffee regularly and it’s the best and I can’t believe it but I’m not anxious about them at all. I am a bit anxious about them judging me if I can’t find people for the study group tho.

But there's some other people I’m very anxious about, and I’m freaking out so maybe you guys could tell me if I’m panicking. Number one is someone I’m gonna call Person 2. Person 2 and I met at a party and we had a super intense energy but I think I ruined it because I kept on messing up when we tried to schedule get togethers and I was really late when it finally happened and ended up locked in their garage and was kind of quiet and awkward because I was so anxious. Anyway I just messaged Person 2 to see if they'd be interested and I turned my notifications off.

Person 3 and I have hung out a couple of times and the first time we had a good energy but I worry I ruined it by suggesting they get a therapist (I was drunk, it was stupid). They came to see me perform standup comedy last week and said they was interested in trying it himself but they was notably very quiet when I suggested this wednesday and didn’t seem interested (maybe they’re just busy?) but I just sent them a text asking about it.

Person 4 is a super intense athlete and student and we worked out once and haven’t been able to since because things keep on getting in the way. They walked out behind me and smiled and patted my chair which is a good sign but they saw me on reddit and I’m worried they won’t want to work out again which sucks because it was awesome.

Person 5 lives very close to me and we don’t hang out a lot but we have a tradition of walking home together after parties but they’re also quiet and kinda awkward. I invited them to join the study group but they’re more integrated with the “popular” social group than I am so idk.

People always say I’m really good at reading people but I’m worried I’ve messed up all my connections. Honestly just writing this out really helped. I’ve turned my notifications off and am going to do homework for a while till I’m calm. If anyone has any advice that’d be awesome. You’re all great and we’re all going to make it.",2,1730163547.0,BPD,0,1.0,False

Honestly this drink caught me by surprise, I thought it was going to be pretty sweet similar to their Caramel Brûlée drink (I’ll post a view on this later). It was a very welcome surprise, since I don’t particularly enjoy super sugary coffees, this drink was rather cinnamon flavored with hints of dark chocolate and coffee. It kinda reminded me of a bowl of Cinnamon Toast Crunch after eating all the cereal and you’re just left with the milk- but not as sweet. I really enjoyed sipping on this drink and just enjoying the spices and flavors this drink has. I’ll definitely get it again when I feel like I want a flavor adventure, or simply when I’m craving something with cinnamon!

1geie2t,https://www.reddit.com/r/creativewriting/comments/1geie2t/i_know_who_put_bella_in_the_wych_elm/,I know who put Bella in the Wych Elm ,"You may have seen the title of this post and wonder who this ""Bella"" is. I am sure there will be a few folks who recognise the phrase, ""Who put Bella in the Wych Elm?"" But for those who don't know, it was part of a series of graffiti about an unidentified murder victim that was forcefully ensconced in a wych elm around Hagley, Worcestershire. Some say she was a prostitute from Birmingham who disappeared three years prior the discovery. Others say she was connected to a German spy. It was a mysterious and haunting case that had plagued our community since 1943, and to this day, many don't know what really happened, who the culprit was or who this ""Bella"" was. Well, no one but me. I know the truth, and the truth is that there lies a darker story behind a woman in the tree. And although I do not think it is exclusive to the town of Hagley, I am positive that anyone who has experienced what I have will understand the mutual fear and dread. Perhaps this confession is a cautionary tale of sorts. Perhaps I'm speaking to an empty crowd. Here is the truth.

There was never a ""Bella"" at all, not that I knew of. The mysterious woman's name was Kornelia. Her last name though? No one knew. She was may be enigmatic  when she was alive. But as far as I know, she was a Polish Jew who fled her homeland during the occupation of Nazi Germany during 1939. Kornelia was... an odd woman to say the least. She was never sociable, and whenever she was, she spoke with a quiet, shy tone. You could distinguish her from the crowd; she was very short (I believe she was around 5'0), had these jagged teeth when she smiled, and had a wide neck. She never went out that much, but when she did, it was mostly at nighttime. It was peculiar by that time. 

I did not speak to her as much when I was a young lad. There was not much to speak to her about, and to be honest, I found her a little strange. That was until I started to notice her nightly routine. Some nights, I would look through the window and see Kornelia walk out her front door. I remember she had a candle lantern and she would look up at the sky. Depending on whatever she saw, she would either stay home or go for a short walk. It hadn't been too long before a few folks noticed this behaviour, and one day, I volunteered to go confront her. It was the last time I spoke to her.

It was the Autumn of 1941; I was 15 that time. I had visited Kornelia when day broke, and as I arrived at her doorsteps, she looked delighted to see me. She and I were the same height.

""Oh hiya, Henry,"" she greeted in fluent English. 

""Good morning, ma'am,"" I replied. ""I was wondering if I could talk to you perhaps."" When hearing the request, Kornelia seemed a little hesitant. I notice she was caressing her tummy in an anticlockwise motion.

""Is there something wrong I did?"" 

""No. Well, not that I know of. I just wanted to talk.""

She nodded slowly as if she was thinking. ""OK. Come in. Do you want tea of coffee?""

""I'm fine thank you.""

The interior of her house was just like any other in Hagley. Nothing out of the blue. That day; it was a bit messier, but who knows. It might have always been that way. I saw photos of her with her family, her as a little girl, and her holding hands with a man. We had never seen her with anyone when she moved here; perhaps she wanted to keep those aspects to herself. I didn't bother asking her that. We both sat on two birch chairs facing each other, and Kornelia grabbed her cup of tea and stirred and drank. 

""So, what is it you wanted to talk about?"", she asked as she smiled. 

""Well, I don't want to come off rude, but I have been noticing your habit,"" I said calmly. 

""My 'habit?'""

""Yes ma'am, your habit. You tend to go for a walk at night."" Her smile faltered a bit. ""Is everything alright? Some of the folks have noticed this too.""

She stirred the tea again. ""Yes dear, everything is fine. I was hoping to keep this a secret."" Kornelia looked at me as if she was worried about me. Before I got to ask another question, she stood and went somewhere. ""Stay here,"" she told. ""I need to give something to you."" I complied and sat, and I waited for her until she came back with a flat box. She sat again and opened the box, and she got out a wooden crucifix. 

""I want you to have this,"" she said. 

I looked at her, confused. ""Why?""

""For protection.""

""Protection from what?""

""Henry, do you ever notice how strange the moon is?"", she questioned. 

I shook my head. ""I don't know what you're talking about.""

""The moon. Do you feel as though it's 'watching' you? Like it's some predator hunting you down. Do you ever notice something on the moon?” Her question confused me to the point that I felt uneasy with her. I shrugged. 

""I don't know; not really I guess.""

""Good,"" Kornelia said, as she edged the crucifix to me. ""Still, I want you to have this."" I reluctantly took it.

""I still don't know why I should have this."" Then she came out with an odd explanation.

""Look; I'm sure you're not allowed to go out at night, and that may be the best thing your parents  did. But if for some reason you find yourself outside, make sure you have the cross. If you see a ring around the moon, run as fast as you can back home. Run home and do not go out!""

I squinted at her. ""But why?""

""It's better not to talk about it further. It knows we're speaking. But this is between you and me."" Thus I left with more questions and a slight apprehension. The conversation was too weird to brush aside. What she was talking about and why she was being so... vague. What was this 'It' she referred to. It was downright peculiar. 

So, I decided to keep an eye on her the more, and that resulted to me following her one night. It was, without a doubt, the greatest mistake I've ever done. Because while I still live to tell the tale, my involvement came at the cost of Kornelia's life. 

One night, I was fully dressed when I saw her coming out her home. She wore a dress with old-timey shoes, and she cradled her belly from the bottom. She held out that familiar lantern, looking up at the sky. Hagley back then was a little more rural, so there weren't many lampposts where I lived, making it too dark to travel. What Kornelia was doing was essentially asking for a death wish. I waited for her to make a move, and once she did, I carefully exited through my window. 

I was outside and was far enough that she wouldn’t spot me. It was cold outside, I remember that. It's strange how fear can make you remember everything vividly. Even to the most minute aspects taken place. I can remember hearing the subtle crunch of the dried leaves, the sound her shoes made when smacking the gravel, and the sound of the wind blowing against me. 

We were walking on the road for 3 minutes until I saw Kornelia hold up the crucifix in the air. It was then I realised I stupidly forgot mine at home. I should have gone home at that instant, but I was too invested in this. I thought there was no turning back from here. I was young and stupid, and I should've known better. So, as she walked, I followed on. A moment later, I realised we arrived at the woods.

As she entered the woods, I started to question what on earth she really was doing. Why is she going in Hagley Wood at night? 'There can't be a good reason,' I thought, while following her. Slowly, I came close to not lose her. 'Is she really being serious? What is the meaning of this?'

Then I remembered the conversation we had. I looked up and saw the full moon. Just like she said, around it was a 'ring.' Nowadays, folks call this phenomenon a 22° halo. But back then, I thought it was some once-in-a-lifetime supernatural occurrence. There was a sense of trepidation that crawled up my spine, and without hesitation, I went up to Kornelia. We were  about knee deep into the forest.

""Ma'am,"" I called out, and she immediately turned. Her brows were crossed and her eyes were wide.

""What are you doing here,"" she hissed. ""Why did you follow me?!"" I couldn't answer. There was an awkward silence between us. Kornelia quickly looked up and saw the moon and looked at me again. ""Do you have your cross?"", she questioned.

I shook my head, feeling a little guilty.

Kornelia looked around her like she felt she was being watched. She lend her own crucifix to me urgently. ""You should not be here, you know. We need to go! Now!""

""Why are you going to the woods at night?"", I asked. 

But before she could answer, suddenly her mouth was covered with a long silk cloth. Kornelia instinctively dropped her things and did her best to remove the cloth to no avail. The sudden attack made me fall on my ass, and that was where I saw her being lifted by something. Then I saw it.

They say that demons are just little red men with horns and a tail, but I beg to differ. This thing was nothing I have ever heard of. It was all white with the head of some animal skull. Like the stereotypical ghoul. It towered over me as it choked Kornelia with its solitary tentacle-like strand. While being suffocated, Kornelia pointed at the cross. Noticing this, there was another strand that appeared and wrapped around her arm and snapped it in half. And as painful as it sounded, she couldn't scream.

With haste, I grabbed the crucifix and booked it out of the woods. I felt my heart race, maybe even skip a beat. I ran away from that place like the wind. Whatever that thing was, it would kill me if I didn't reach home. It was not long until I saw the demon chase me with multiple white strands from its bottom outstretched. I raised the crucifix up high, and it stopped at once. 

It hovered there about a few meters from me. I noticed there was this ring around its horns. That was when it all made sense. I looked up at the moon, then at the demon. This was what she meant. The ring. 'It must be some warning,' I thought. 

The thing stared at me for what seemed like a long time. It had no visible mouth, and even then, it never said anything. No noise, no nothing. As I inched backwards, it went back to the woods. It was gone as soon as it came, just like that. Everything was a blur after that. 

All I can remember was that, after that point, everyone in Hagley seemed to forget there even was a Kornelia. Like her very existence was just erased from our memories. Her photos were never there. I admit I also forgot her, until two years later when the four boys found a skeleton in the wych elm in Hagley Wood. News broke out in the community, and the memory of the night came rushing back to me. Her warning, the moon, the thing. It hit me like a lorry. I never told anyone this, because they would think I’m some lunatic.

Then there came the graffiti, and the infamous 'Wych Elm Bella' pseudonym that was the talk of the town. There were talks about the victim being a sex worker or a lover of a German spy. How the body being stuffed in the wych elm was a work of witchcraft. Eventually, the case was dropped and the victim was still unidentified. No one even knew who the one doing the graffiti was, but I have no doubt it was it. This was its own twisted way of mocking the victim. 

To this day, I've been haunted with the memory of this forgotten woman. If there was a way I could go back, I would change everything with no second to spare. But if there's one thing I should say, it's that if you see a ring around a full moon, stay inside. Don't go out, no matter what. If it's for a party or a late night job, forget it. Nothing is worth the risk. It will come for you as it came for me and Kornelia.

I know who put 'Bella' in the Wych Elm, and some people call it the 22° Angel.

For this who don't like reading long posts, I'm just looking for resources that can help me get started on my weight loss journey, but specific things like suggesting weekly routines, eating habits, stuff like that would be most appreciated.

I'm 5'3, 22yrs old, and 200ish lbs, have PCOS but I think I look and feel the healthiest if I was back down to about 125.

At 14, I started birth control and gained weight from 115 to 125lbs. I hated how I looked at 115lbs, literally skin and bones.
At 17, I changed birth control pills and gained weight up to 140.
At 18, I started college and gained some weight there... ""freshman 15"" as they say.
At 19, I was off birth control and gained weight to about 170.
At 21, I got back on it and gained weight to about 190, and I've fluctuated ever since between 185 and 200lbs.
Recently, at 22, I'm off birth control again but I've finally gotten my shit together enough to start eating right and exercising, I just don't know where to start.

I have a gym membership and I feel most comfortable going in the late evenings. I've been going every-other-day, and keeping up with consistenty getting in around 1.5 active hours each night. I'll do 30-45min of cardio (either under-20min-mile walking pace on a treadmill, stationary biking to the beat of my favorite songs (upbeat hyperpop stuff lol) or some combo of those things). I'll then do about 10min of rowing because I just think it's really fun lol. And then... I don't really know what targeted stuff I should do or where to even start looking without having paid subscriptions to sketchy websites and supplement peddlers.

The gym I go to has little informational stickers on all the workout machines, so I can figure out how to do some of them, like the lat pull downs, chest press, leg press, and leg extension machines. So far I've just been setting them to the lowest or second lowest setting and just doing as many reps as I can until I can't. I'll walk a lap or switch to another machine and do the same there, sometimes coming back to do another series of reps until failure, increase the weight. Anything to just keep me moving and familiarizing myself with good form and what feels right.

The rest here I don't know if I should post on like a nutrition sub, but as far as my eating habits go, I've been able to reduce my daily consumption habits to 3500cal+ a day to around 2000 a day. I use my phone's health app to track calories. I don't always have the most well rounded diet, but I make sure to always have either a salad or some fruit as a meal every day, or make sure the sandwiches (burgers, breakfast sandwiches, etc) have plenty of veggies in them. I do eat fast food, but I've been cutting way back and don't really have the money for it anymore anyway. When I do go out I try to get Subway or Jimmy Johns because I like it so much better than like McDonalds or whatever. The biggest help a friend of mine told me is to just make sure I'm eating enough to not be tired and not over eating until I feel gross, and that 2000 calorie number has felt the best so far.

An example of my day tends to go:
8am: wake up
11am: coffee for breakfast (i know thats bad but I am addicted to caffeine) and a nice homemade breakfast sandwich on my days off from work
3pm: snack or lunch, depending on how hungry I feel that day, always a snack if I have work 
6pm: dinner, almost always homecooked but very calorie heavy
8pm: go to the gym for usually 1-1.5hrs
10pm: usually going to bed, but my partner and I have a really bad habit of snacking at this hour, usually popcorn or chips or whatever quick snacks we have

To anybody who has looked this far, thank you so much. I'm just trying to get my body back in order and hopefully losing weight and eating better can help me manage my PCOS and also just help me feel good about my body image again.",1,1730163025.0,beginnerfitness,5,1.0,False

1gei8iq,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1gei8iq,Real AND fake?!,"Hi everyone. I am so confused by the cups I bought recently. I splurged and bought 3 on eBay. I probably should have just purchased them at Target and made custom wraps on my Cricut.

I am (was 😂) not a Stanley girlie. I’m always late on trends because I want to see the quality bear out, although I have my dad’s Stanley thermos from the ‘70s. I just wanted something to hold a lot of liquid and keep it cold. After drinking room temp water all my life, my new friend Peri M. Pause demands frosty beverages. I have Starbucks cold tumblers, but the coffee is warm after an hour. I have other stay cool cups, but they max out at about 4-6 hours, the ice melts, and the 30 Oz size is are hard to pick up without handles.

So I waded into Stanley world a bit ignorant. Just wanted 3 cups that keep liquid cold up to 12 hours — 1 for water, 1 for coffee, 1 extra when the others are in the dishwasher. I was willing to pay for a Stanley because others had been $30 and not fit my needs. 

I assumed my first two were fakes, because they were only $50 for the Starbucks red. But…

# 1 - seems to fit all criteria for a real cup - hex screws, handle near the top, tumbler with arrows on inside bottom. I thought it might be fake for two reasons — the red flaked off the bottom and liquid didn’t stay cool long, even when I added more ice and cold water instead of room temp. Pics 1-3

# 2 - was supposed to be holiday 2024 and shipping end of November, but then arrived last week. The printing is blurry/shadowed on the second cup, but it has the hex screws, tumbler design on inside bottom, and handle close to the top. I haven’t washed or used it yet. Pics 4-5

#3 - I figured the third was a real one with Hello Kitty wrap or engraving after market. Alas, it has the SUS marking on the inside bottom. 🤦🏽‍♀️

I also like to work out to keep in shape and stay healthy. In my spare time I fill out sweepstakes and enter raffles (that I often win a lot!).

I am looking for a woman who I can travel, cosplay, geek out with and eventually share a life with. But for now a coffee, if local, would be great.

Message me if you’re weird in your own way, genuine, grounded yet haven’t lost your childlike wonder, and overall fun!
