1ky1ein,https://www.reddit.com/r/badreviewer/comments/1ky1ein/is_the_tozo_ht2_hybrid_active_noise_cancelling/,Is the TOZO HT2 Hybrid Active Noise Cancelling Headphones Worth It? A Bad Reviewers Analysis,"Can you really get decent **active noise cancellation** for under $35, or is this just another case of ""you get what you pay for""? When I spotted the [TOZO HT2 headphones review](https://amzn.to/4mCxoLL) requests flooding our inbox, I was genuinely curious whether these **budget active noise cancellation** headphones could compete with big-name brands costing 5x more. As someone who spends hours daily in coffee shops and noisy co-working spaces, I needed a reliable pair of **wireless noise cancelling headphones under 50** that wouldn't break my freelancer budget. After six weeks of real-world testing, here's my honest take on whether these **best cheap wireless headphones** deliver on their bold promises.

# Sound Quality & Performance

The [TOZO HT2](https://amzn.to/4mCxoLL) surprised me with its balanced sound signature that doesn't fall into the typical budget headphone trap of overwhelming bass. The 40mm drivers deliver clear mids and surprisingly detailed highs for **affordable ANC headphones** in this price range. While audiophiles might notice the lack of ultra-fine detail in complex orchestral pieces, these handle everything from podcast dialogue to electronic music with impressive competence.

The **hybrid ANC headphones review** experience reveals effective noise reduction that genuinely blocks out ambient chatter and air conditioning hum. It's not quite Sony WH-1000XM5 territory, but for **budget audiophile headphones**, the active cancellation combined with decent passive isolation creates a notably quieter listening environment that enhances focus during work sessions.

# Battery Life & Charging

Forty hours with ANC off, 35 hours with it on – those aren't typos. This **wireless headphones with microphone** setup genuinely delivers marathon battery performance that puts some premium competitors to shame. During my testing period, I charged them maybe three times total, which is liberating when you're constantly on the move.

The USB-C charging port feels modern and convenient, though the included cable is disappointingly short. A full charge takes about 2.5 hours, and the quick-charge feature provides roughly 3 hours of playback from just 10 minutes plugged in – perfect for those ""oh no, dead headphones"" moments before important calls.

# Comfort & Fit

Extended wearing comfort often separates truly usable **best budget noise cancelling headphones 2025** from desk drawer dust collectors. The memory foam ear cushions feel soft initially, though they do compress somewhat after several hours of continuous wear. The adjustable headband distributes weight reasonably well, and at 250g, these won't cause neck fatigue during long listening sessions.

However, people with larger heads might find the clamping force a bit tight initially – though this does improve the passive noise isolation. The ear cups swivel and fold for portability, making these surprisingly travel-friendly for daily commuters.

# Controls & UI

Physical buttons win over touch controls every time in my book, and TOZO agrees. The tactile buttons on the right ear cup handle play/pause, track skipping, and ANC toggling without the accidental activation issues plaguing touch-sensitive alternatives. The dedicated ANC button provides satisfying feedback when switching between modes.

Call quality through the built-in microphone performs adequately for video conferences, though background noise rejection isn't stellar. For **TOZO headphones vs Sony** comparisons, the call quality definitely favors the pricier options, but it's perfectly functional for remote work needs.

# Build Quality & Durability

The plastic construction feels solid enough for the price point, though it lacks the premium materials of higher-end models. The hinges and adjustment mechanisms operate smoothly without excessive play or wobbling. After weeks of daily use, tossing in backpacks, and general abuse, they show minimal wear beyond some minor scuffing on the glossy surfaces.

The included carrying case feels flimsy – more of a dust protector than actual protection. I'd invest in a proper hard case if you plan on traveling frequently with these **noise cancelling headphones for students** or professionals constantly on the go.

# Additional Features

The transparency mode works surprisingly well for quick conversations without removing the headphones entirely. While not as seamless as Apple's implementation, it's genuinely useful for coffee shop orders or brief interruptions. The EQ presets accessible through the TOZO app provide some customization options, though the default tuning works well for most content.

Multi-device connectivity allows pairing with two devices simultaneously, which proves handy for switching between laptop work and phone calls. The connection stability remains solid within typical Bluetooth range, with minimal dropouts during normal use.

# Pros & Cons

**Pros:**

* Exceptional 35-40 hour battery life
* Effective ANC for budget price point
* Comfortable memory foam ear cushions
* Reliable physical button controls
* Multi-device Bluetooth connectivity

**Cons:**

* Plastic build feels somewhat cheap
* Call microphone could be clearer
* Tight fit on larger heads
* Flimsy included carrying case

# Value Proposition & Price Analysis

At $33.99, the [TOZO HT2](https://amzn.to/4mCxoLL) delivers remarkable value that's hard to ignore. Compared to the Sony WH-CH720N ($149) or Audio-Technica ATH-ANC500BT ($199), you're getting roughly 70% of the performance at 20% of the cost. Even against the Soundcore Life Q30 ($79), these emerge as the clear **best cheap wireless headphones** for budget-conscious buyers.

This represents the **best budget noise cancelling headphones 2025** sweet spot – genuine ANC functionality, solid audio quality, and marathon battery life without premium pricing. For students, remote workers, or anyone wanting to test ANC waters before investing in flagship models, this is an intelligent entry point.

**👍 Would I recommend the** [TOZO HT2](https://amzn.to/4mCxoLL) **to budget-conscious users seeking their first ANC experience? Without hesitation.**

These headphones prove that effective noise cancellation doesn't require a $300+ investment. While they won't satisfy critical listeners demanding absolute audio perfection, they nail the fundamentals that matter for daily use: blocking distractions, lasting all week on a charge, and delivering pleasant sound quality. The build quality feels appropriate for the price, and the feature set exceeds expectations at every turn.

1ky19c6,https://www.reddit.com/r/stories/comments/1ky19c6/arthur_lost_everything_in_la_and_was_doomed_for/,Arthur lost everything in LA and was doomed for life on the streets,"The Los Angeles sun beat down on Arthur as he trudged along Ventura Boulevard. Eight months. Eight months since he'd landed in the City of Angels, full of dreams and ambition. Now, all he felt was the crushing weight of reality. The layoff had been a kick in the teeth, a reality check delivered with the force of a wrecking ball. His meager savings, a paltry $3,000, were dwindling faster than his hope.

He remembered his supervisor's sympathetic, yet resolute, face as she explained the furloughs. He'd pleaded, argued, but the decision was final. The expensive rent gnawed at him, a constant reminder of his precarious situation.

For weeks, he tried to maintain a facade of composure, but the dam eventually broke. He desperately needed therapy, a lifeline in the storm, but he couldn't afford it. The call to his mother, Jane, was a desperate plea for help. Her response, ""Arthur, I told you so,"" echoed his own growing fears. ""The new city gleam is over. We can't move you again, Arthur. That cost us $7,000 last time. You're going to have to figure it out.""

Figure it out. Easy for her to say. He felt utterly alone, stranded in a city where the smiles felt superficial, the kindness transactional. He missed the genuine warmth, the down-to-earth sincerity of Texas, even if it wasn't always wrapped in perfect politeness.

Week five post-termination arrived like a fresh wave of despair. The only jobs he could find were rideshare and food delivery, barely enough to keep him afloat. He found himself wandering through Westfield Fashion Square, the sterile, air-conditioned environment a stark contrast to his internal turmoil. When Barbara Streisand crooned ""What Kind of Fool"" over the Bloomingdale's speakers, it felt like a personal indictment.

A missed call from DW, her contact picture a shot of her beaming in front of the Dallas Reunion Tower, sent him spiraling. Tears streamed down his face, blurring the image on his phone. He should have listened. He should have stayed.

He sought solace in his friends. Alex, initially sympathetic, offered only a curt ""tough luck"" during their meeting at Bobby's Coffee Shop in Woodland Hills. Ela apologized, but was ultimately unhelpful. Tanya, the counselor, provided only textbook responses, paraphrasing his pain without offering real solutions. Buster, consumed by his need for constant snacks, dismissed him with a hasty apology. Muffy, hoarding her wealth for a Fijian vacation, was unable to help.

He had ignored the warnings, the whispers of California's exorbitant cost and demanding nature. He was truly screwed.

Finally, in desperation, he called DW. He poured out his regrets, his fears of homelessness, his realization that DFW hadn't been the problem, but rather his own unresolved depression and anxiety.

DW listened, but her response was swift and jarring. ""I have to go. Emily's in town, and we're going to the Fort Worth Stockyards. Gotta drive down Preston Road to the PGBT."" And then, silence.

A panic attack gripped him in his cramped apartment. He envisioned himself on the streets, another statistic in Los Angeles' growing homeless population.

Five days later, he found himself back at a mall, this time Westfield Topanga, with Alex. As melancholy music filled the Macy's, the tears returned. The sad contemplation music played on the speakers.

""I just wish I never moved,"" he choked out. The music was still playing over the speakers while Alex talked.

Alex, surprisingly insightful, pointed out, ""That's why I still live at home. It's too expensive to rent here. Me, Arnold, Robert, Chris, Mitchell, Ela, Tanya... we all live in our childhood homes, man! Muffy's dad bought her a house, because he a millionaire."" He wrapped Arthur in a brief, awkward hug. ""Find a way back to Texas, man. Find a way.""

That evening, his phone rang. It was DW. ""Ready to come back?""

""Yes,"" he whispered, his voice thick with emotion. He apologized and thanked DW a lot.

DW offered him a lifeline, a loan for the move, payable in monthly installments. His credit was ruined, loans were out of the question, and relying on family was his only option. He accepted, grateful for the chance to escape.

He was going home. Los Angeles, with all its promises and perils, had broken him. He wanted to see everyone one last time, and hopefully say goodbye. He realized Los Angeles and California were better for vacationing and not living. ",1,1748490873.0,stories,0,1.0,False

This unusual cello sibling features very little in contemporary composition.  It the late 20th century, it started to die out:  it's constructed from a 40cm round drum resonator with python snakeskin (increasingly hunted) and awkward to construct, carry and maintain.    

  
Nonetheless, it has a softer nuanced gentle timbre compared to the more woody cello.    

Here it is paired with two Chinese instruments:  the Erhu 2 string fiddle and the pear shaped lute called the Pipa.

F17 4'11 110lbs,"Hi guys! This post will be organized chaos, but I'm just brain dumping. I am not looking for a diagnosis, just validation that I'm not hypochondriacal, and some guidance on what I should do. I am not diagnosed with anything, but have been told by PT that I am hypermobile. Also, if you have any other sites/forums/articles that could be helpful, I'd appreciate it. 

1. Growing up, I would get god awful growing pains. I would be awake for hours, crying while my mom massaged my legs. We tried ice because that's what the internet said to do, and I remember that it would make it so much worse, so instead I'd wrap an electric heating pad around my legs and burn the pain away. To this day I still experience this, not as often as I did when I was a child, because then it was happening nightly.  

2. My ankles frequently get throbbing, stabbing pains for absoultly no reason. I used to roll my ankles all the time as a kid because I had ""loose"" ankles, as I would call it. This still would be happening to me if I were still playing sports. I sprained my ankle in gym this year playing basketball.

3. My thumbs get achey and stabby and freeze up almost every single day. Sometimes it's random, sometimes there is a cause. I have the message out or hold my thumb. 

4. My elbows lock up, and then I get a stabbing pain when I straighten them out, which in order to do that, I have to twist my arm inwards to do so, or I can't unstick it. There is always a loud pop. 

5. If I sit for any period, my back cracks like crazy with absolutely zero force. 

6. When I was playing sports, my hips would frequently sublux multiple times a day. It was so painful and I wouldn't be able to walk. Eventually, I tore my hip flexor. This still happens to me if I walk too much or sit for too long and walk. This happened to me for years, and I went to so many doctors for it and no one had an answer because it was a subluxation. Then I went to PT and learned I'm hypermobile in my hips. This was before I tore it. 

7. I sit like every meme I've seen of someone with hypermobility, and cannot stay in a certain position for longer than 10 minutes or it starts to hurt. 

8. Constant aches and pains for no reason at all.

9. If I open my mouth, I can feel my jaw shift back in place. I do have an underbite, so this could contribute..

10. Standing is extremely exhausting, but sitting hurts.

11. If I'm trying to stay hydrated (which I will be honest am horrible at) I have to constantly pee and I am not this way with coffee, and I am an avid coffee drinker.

13. When I shower, I become exhausted and my legs turn purple. 

14. Simple things like making my bed and doing laundry make me super hot and sweaty. I am not overweight, I am young and a normal amount active.

I had lowered my weight in a year to 88kg/194lb and kept the weight off and kept losing weight at a healthy and sustainable habits. I achieved that through non structured exercise, mostly cardio and a 1700kcal diet. 

But last year I had an event in my life that left me isolated from everyone I knew and also lost my job from redundancy.

I don’t know if it was just purely stress that messed me up because I was stressed over the years I was doing well for losing weight. I didn’t change my diet, I didn’t stop exercising and yet I gained weight rapidly which has messed me up too since I sold all my old clothes that didn’t fit me before and now I’m spending money on clothes again.

I had blood tests too, and they were all healthy, multiple doctors couldn’t figure it out, got referred to a dietician. 

Then after 3 months of massive weight gain while putting in the same effort as before I gave up for another 3 months. After that time I’m now 110kg/242lb again, I look different than I did before and don’t look obese in the face is the only difference.

I started exercise and diet again, slowly going into it and no results for 2 months. Tried more protein and exercise, tried more fibre, tried more resistance exercise, tried intermittent fasting, tried calorie label only meals, tried eating more, tried eating less, all at the guidance of a dietician who approved of each attempt. I can’t afford weight loss medication so that’s out of the picture for me (there is no coverage in my country for this).

I do the following currently which results in maintenance at 110kg/242.51 week on week:

- Eat 1500kcal in a 20/4 schedule
- Resistance exercises at gym 3 times a week for 1 hour + cardio for 30 minutes 
- Walk about 5km daily
- Don’t use caffeine outside maybe a cup of coffee in a day
- Eat lower carb and higher protein and fibre intake

1ky0s74,https://www.reddit.com/r/UnsentLetters/comments/1ky0s74/hello_goodbye/,Hello. Goodbye.,"I’m moving back to California this week. Not to LA, though. My partner is coming. We moved in together a couple of months ago. 

I was at his brother’s wedding this past weekend, and I almost wore the same dress I wore to your brother’s. I couldn’t help but compare, of course. His brother is a doctor, and there were several in attendance finishing up their training where you did. I wondered if they remembered you. Then, I kept thinking about the times I’d drop off corn man when you were on call, or the early mornings we’d race our cars down Sunset, you on the way to work and me back to the westside. These memories burned a hole in the pit of my stomach as I sipped sangria and met uncles and cousins and childhood friends who kept telling my partner I’m beautiful.

It doesn’t hurt, but there’s a hollowness there when I think about you and our memories. I don’t know if it’s because we never got closure or if you’re really the one that got away. Will it go away when I’m walking down the aisle? Or holding my child in my arms for the first time? Or when I’m dying?

I saw there was a conference for your specialty here where I live a few months ago. I happened to go to a Starbucks by the convention center and saw an iced coffee, no sugar, a little room for milk sitting on the counter in a pool of its own condensation with your name on it. I looked around, wondering if it was yours and you were avoiding me. Is that deranged? Well anyway, if you do see me somewhere, say hi. Or rather, goodbye.

Groundbreaking research from unexpected fields reveals that lasting achievement stems from specific, actionable habits anyone can develop. Here's how to cultivate success that resonates with your deepest values.

https://preview.redd.it/80t6vrt64n3f1.jpg?width=1920&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=523cb4641a2ab1622bb93e7a5e635ee08e466ec7



1. Redefine Success with the ""Three-Legged Stool"" Principle

Neuroscientists at the University of Zurich identified that truly successful people balance three elements:

\- Mastery (continuous growth)

\- Connection (meaningful relationships)

\- Autonomy (control over your time)



Take inspiration from Dr. Jane Goodall: Initially criticized for her unconventional chimpanzee research methods, she combined these elements to revolutionize primatology while maintaining her unique approach to life and work.



Your move:

\- Weekly, rate yourself 1-10 in each area

\- Adjust your priorities to keep all three within 2 points of each other



2. Cultivate ""Deep Work"" Stamina

A 9-year MIT study of breakthrough innovators found they shared one habit: the ability to focus intensely for 90-minute blocks without distractions.



Like composer Ludwig van Beethoven, who:

\- Composed in strict morning isolation

\- Counted coffee beans to measure his doses (exactly 60 per brew)

\- Walked daily with a sketchbook for musical ideas



Build your focus muscle:

1. Start with 25-minute focused sessions

2. Gradually increase by 5 minutes weekly

3. Protect these sessions like medical appointments



3. Develop ""Antifragile"" Confidence

Researchers at King's College London discovered that people who view challenges as ""stress tests"" rather than threats develop what psychologists call ""unshakable core confidence.""



Consider Viola Desmond's story:

\- The Canadian businesswoman refused to leave a whites-only cinema section in 1946

\- Her subsequent arrest and trial sparked Canada's civil rights movement

\- She later said: ""Each 'no' I received made my next 'yes' more powerful""



Try this reframe:

After any setback, ask:

\- What did this teach me about my strengths?

\- How has this prepared me for bigger opportunities?



4. Master the ""Invisible Skills""

A Harvard Business School analysis of 10,000 professionals revealed that ""below-the-radar"" abilities account for 68% of career breakthroughs:

\- Reading emotional undercurrents

\- Timing your requests strategically

\- Turning rivals into allies



Take a page from chef José Andrés:

His disaster relief efforts succeeded because he:

\- Studied local food cultures before helping

\- Built trust by cooking alongside community members

\- Let others take credit for joint successes



To develop these skills:

1. Observe masters in your field for 10 minutes weekly

2. Note their subtle interactions, not just obvious actions



5. Create a ""Success Ecosystem""

Ecologists studying rainforests found that diversity creates resilience—a principle that applies to personal growth. The most successful people intentionally cultivate:

\- Diverse mentors (different ages, fields, backgrounds)

\- ""Reverse mentors"" (people who challenge your assumptions)

\- Cross-pollination spaces (unusual environments that spark ideas)



Like engineer Hedy Lamarr:

The Hollywood actress/inventor:

\- Discussed radio technology with aircraft designers at parties

\- Combined musical concepts with weapons research

\- Developed frequency-hopping technology that paved the way for WiFi



Build your ecosystem:

\- Monthly ""learning lunch"" with someone outside your field

\- Quarterly visit to an inspiring space (museum, lab, nature reserve)



6. Practice ""Strategic Patience""

Longitudinal studies at the University of Bern show that people who pair immediate action with long-term perspective achieve 3x more than those focused solely on hustle culture.



Learn from mountaineer Nirmal Purja:

When breaking the record for climbing all 14 highest peaks:

\- He moved swiftly but rested at calculated intervals

\- Took time to acclimatize properly at each stage

\- Finished in 6 months versus the previous 7-year record



Apply this:

For every goal, set:

\- 1 immediate action (today)

\- 1 mid-range milestone (3-6 months)

\- 1 long-term vision (5+ years)



7. Measure What Truly Matters

Pioneering research from the Copenhagen Institute of Happiness proves that successful people track unconventional metrics:

\- Energy Return on Investment (does this activity give or drain energy?)

\- Relationship Capital (who have you helped without expectation?)

\- Legacy Moments (what will people remember you for?)



Like librarian Luis Soriano:

He transformed rural Colombian education by:

\- Measuring books delivered by donkey (over 4,000 weekly)

\- Tracking children's dreams sparked rather than test scores

\- Counting community-built libraries (27 and growing)



Create your dashboard:

\- 1 traditional metric (income, weight, etc.)

\- 1 emotional metric (joy, fulfillment)

\- 1 legacy metric (impact on others)



Your Success Blueprint Starts Today

True success isn't about beating others—it's about becoming the best version of yourself while lifting others up. As cellist Pablo Casals advised at age 90: ""Never retire from your passion, only from your job title.""



Take these steps now:

1. Choose one principle that resonates most

2. Implement it for 21 days

3. Note how your definition of success evolves



""Success is planting trees under whose shade you'll never sit—but whose fruit will nourish generations."" — Adapted from Greek proverb



Which principle will you try first? Share using AuthenticSuccess



Why This Works:

\- Evidence-based from diverse scientific studies

\- Features unconventional role models

\- Balances achievement with fulfillment

\- Provides immediate action steps",1,1748489239.0,mypersonaldevelopment,0,1.0,False

I always thought of myself as the girl who wanted that fairytale story: the tall, dark, stranger who was there for me, and loved me for every inch of my intellect, personality, and muffin top rolls. I wished for a man who I would marry, have children, and grow old with. Considering I never had that typical American-style family with even a broken down white picket fence, I told myself I would do better than my parents, and create the life I dreamed. I never imagined that the first time I actually fell in love would be with a married man.

I never really saw anything in John when I initially meet him a few years ago when I started. He was this brooding man who really didn't seem to smile. Time went on and I transitioned from cashier, to floor associate, but when he took a chance by promoting me to a manager, that is when things changed. We interacted frequently, I brought him coffee on our weekends, I involved the team in playing practical jokes on him, encouraged him to participate in the staff spirit days and activities. Gradually, we started getting closer, at least on a professional level where he became a mentor, but there certainly was a connection. We were comfortable physically being in each others personal space, he would hand me his phone to browse his vacation photos, he gave me hours close to full time when I was only part time and now know that he wasn't allowed to do, he let me write off lots of things for staff activites or just to have fun in the store – again not allowed. One of the biggest gestures he made was buying me a blanket from our internal charity fundraiser auction to say thank you for oraganizing.

Things were good with us. My coworker and friend even spotted that we shared a connection. Then the worst day happened and he was fired. Don't know the reason, but have been able to figure out it was nothing malicious on his part, maybe stupid and coming from a person with a big heart, but nothing greedy or with ill-intent. I have been there for him, though, the last 2 months. I supported him and made sure he was doing alright. We texted practically every day. We became friends, he even said so. I gave him heartfelt messages that made him cry, I flirted more than I did at work asking his opinion on dress pictures I sent, complimenting him on his new profile picture, or telling him i wore his work sweater to keep warm, which he loved. He even called me one day because he sensed I was feeling down and we talked for almost an hour!

Then something has happened and his responses are less frequent and he seems to not want to talk too many days in a row. I feel like I'm getting the cold shoulder. I also been trying to get him to want to meet up for coffee, as friends do, but he keeps saying he's not ready. I like being friends, but obviously would like more. It's hard to read through text and just want to see him in person.

I've officially become an adultress with another MM purely for sexually needs so it's not all sexually lust I want with John or am driven by which some have suggested. It's dumb, but I actually love John so can't help what I feel. I've thought a lot about every scenario and if he is fine, I want to start an affair. Call me a bad person, but if he doesn't have the same feelings for his W but he does with me, honestly, why can't he have both especially considering she is older than him and I am younger? 

Anyways, this is my story so far. Thank you for reading.

Designed to seamlessly integrate into high-end kitchens and provide a consistent supply of exceptionally clear, pure ice, these ice makers are a testament to Sub ZeroS commitment to quality and innovation. For discerning homeowners and culinary professionals,a Sub Zero ice maker is not merely an appliance,but an investment in convenience,performance,and the ultimate ice experience.

Built with advanced filtration and freezing technology, Sub Zero ice makers ensure that every cube is free of impurities and boasts optimal clarity, elevating the quality of beverages and culinary creations. Their quiet operation and sleek designs make them an unobtrusive yet essential addition to any sophisticated space.

## Key Features Analysis

The Sub Zero ice maker is renowned for its advanced engineering and premium materials, resulting in exceptional performance and durability.

**ice Purity and Filtration**

Sub Zero ice makers incorporate sophisticated water filtration systems that remove impurities, minerals, and chlorine from the water supply before it's frozen. This multi-stage filtration process ensures that the ice produced is crystal clear, odorless, and tasteless, enhancing the flavor of beverages and preventing the accumulation of scale and sediment within the ice maker itself. The filtration system typically includes a sediment filter, a carbon filter, and potentially other specialized filters tailored to address specific water quality concerns. the filters are designed for easy replacement, ensuring consistent ice quality over the lifetime of the appliance.

**Clear Ice Technology**

Sub Zero ice makers utilize a unique freezing process that creates exceptionally clear ice. Unlike conventional ice makers that freeze water quickly from the outside in, trapping air and impurities, Sub Zero ice makers employ a gradual, controlled freezing process. Water is circulated slowly over a freezing plate, allowing impurities and air bubbles to be flushed away, resulting in dense, virtually transparent ice cubes. This clear ice not only looks more appealing but also melts more slowly than cloudy ice, minimizing dilution and preserving the flavor of drinks.

**Ice Production Capacity**

The ice production capacity of a Sub Zero ice maker is a key performance indicator, typically ranging from 30 to 50 pounds of ice per day, depending on the specific model. This generous output ensures an ample supply of ice for entertaining, large families, or commercial applications. The ice maker's control panel allows users to adjust the ice production rate to match their specific needs, conserving energy during periods of lower demand. The storage bin capacity is also a crucial factor, with models offering varying levels of storage to accommodate different consumption patterns.**Quiet operation**

Sub Zero engineers have prioritized quiet operation in the design of their ice makers. Advanced insulation, vibration dampening materials, and optimized compressor technology minimize noise levels, allowing the ice maker to operate discreetly in even the most noise-sensitive environments.The quiet operation is notably beneficial for open-concept kitchens, home theaters, and other spaces where noise can be disruptive. Many users note that the ice maker is virtually silent during normal operation,blending seamlessly into the background.Key features of the Sub Zero ice maker include:

   Advanced Water Filtration

   Clear Ice Production

   High Ice Output

   Quiet Operation

The Sub Zero ice maker provides several critically important benefits, making it a worthwhile investment for those who value convenience, quality, and performance.**elevated Beverage Experience:** The crystal-clear ice produced by a Sub Zero ice maker considerably enhances the presentation and flavor of beverages. Drinks look more appealing with clear, sparkling ice, and the slower melting rate minimizes dilution, preserving the intended taste and aroma.

**Consistent Ice Supply:** Never run out of ice again with a Sub Zero ice maker. With its ample production capacity, you can rely on a steady supply of perfect ice for any occasion, whether it's a small family gathering or a large-scale party.

Chefs and home cooks use clear ice to chill seafood displays, create stunning buffet presentations, and keep salads and other perishable items fresh and appealing. The clarity and purity of the ice enhance the visual appeal of food, while its slow melting rate helps maintain optimal temperatures for longer periods.

## FAQs Section

Here are some frequently asked questions about Sub Zero ice makers.**What type of water source is required for a Sub zero ice maker?**
Sub Zero ice makers can be configured for either a direct water line connection or a manual fill option with a water reservoir. A direct water line connection provides a continuous supply of water, eliminating the need for manual refilling. For locations without easy access to a water line, a reservoir model offers greater flexibility. The water source should be potable and meet local water quality standards.

**How ofen do I need to replace the water filter?**
The water filter replacement frequency depends on water quality and usage. Generally, it is recommended to replace the filter every 6 to 12 months. Sub Zero ice makers often include an indicator light that alerts you when it's time to change the filter. Regular filter replacement is crucial for maintaining ice purity and preventing scale buildup within the ice maker.

**What is the typical lifespan of a Sub Zero ice maker?**
With proper maintainance, a Sub Zero ice maker can last for 15 to 20 years or more.

In the quest for alertness, many individuals turn to popular stimulants like coffee. However, an increasing number of people are exploring alternatives such as SumaTonic, a herbal supplement designed to provide sustained energy without the notorious crash associated with caffeinated beverages. But how do these two options stack up in terms of effectiveness and user experience? 

Coffee is well-known for its high caffeine content, which can produce immediate results in boosting energy and mental clarity. However, this quick spike often leads to a subsequent energy drop, causing feelings of fatigue and irritability. The jittery sensation that accompanies a strong cup of coffee can be a significant downside for many, leaving them looking for a smoother, more consistent energy source.

SumaTonic, on the other hand, offers a unique blend of natural ingredients that aim to enhance focus and stamina. Users frequently report feeling more balanced and alert without experiencing the intense highs and lows tied to coffee consumption. Key herbs in SumaTonic, like maca and ginseng, are known for their adaptogenic properties that help the body manage stress and promote overall vitality. 

Comparing SumaTonic vs. Coffee, the results can vary based on individual sensitivity to caffeine and personal health goals. Here are some factors to consider: 


    Duration of Alertness: SumaTonic tends to provide a longer-lasting, steady state of alertness.
    Crash Factor: Coffee often leads to an energy crash post-consumption, while SumaTonic aims to minimize this effect.
    Health Benefits: SumaTonic includes various vitamins and minerals, promoting health beyond just alertness.


Ultimately, the choice between SumaTonic and coffee depends on personal preference and lifestyle. While coffee delivers an immediate boost, SumaTonic may be the better option for those seeking prolonged focus without unwanted side effects. Exploring these alternatives can lead to a more productive and balanced daily routine.

1ky0ji0,https://www.reddit.com/r/ufl/comments/1ky0ji0/making_friends_couples_edition/,Making friends - couples edition,"Looking to make some new friends — ideally another couple!

Hey everyone! I’m a 22-year-old grad student at UF (engineering), originally from USF. I’ve been here for about a year now, and one thing I’ve noticed is that most people already seem to have their social circles, which has made it a bit tough to meet new folks.

My fiancée (also 22) moved to Gainesville with me. She’s a professional baker and incredibly creative — she’s into all kinds of artistic hobbies and is thinking about trying out pottery next. Since she’s not a student here, it’s been extra hard for her to find new friends, and I’d really love to help her feel more at home here.

We’ve tried going to a few events and meetups, but it's been tough breaking into groups that already know each other well. So I figured I’d just put this out there directly:

Are there any other couples out there — maybe a nerdy guy/artsy girl combo like us — who’d be down to hang out sometime? Whether it's grabbing coffee, going to a local art class, or just chatting about life in Gainesville, we’d love to connect.

Feel free to DM me or comment here. You can also reach out on Instagram (@sorakh3). Totally no pressure if we don’t click — just figured it’s worth trying to meet some new people in the area",7,1748488535.0,ufl,0,0.89,False

Hey there—👋 If you’re tired of swiping and craving something real, let’s talk. I’m a laid-back 5’8” guy with a wicked sense of humor, looking for my fellow nerd, you can be normal too as long as you got a big heart and a bigger butt (joke) 

Picture this: cozy nights after work debating dinner plans or cuddling on the couch watching shitty shows mixed with dumb jokes and hand holding. I love concerts, museum hangs, and low-key adventures, but I’m just as happy spending time together or sharing experiences together.

I’m all about loyalty, honesty, and keeping it real—life’s messy, and I want someone to laugh with through the chaos, hug it out when things get heavy, and grow alongside. You’re probably introverted with a big heart, a little nerdy about something obscure (tell me!), and you balance self-care with not taking life too seriously. (Bonus points if you can be super outspoken—and if you game on PC, if you don't that's fine, be open to getting a PC haha)

About me: Peanut butter-skinned, 160lbs, affectionately tactile, and the guy friends call to fix their Wi-Fi. 

I’ll make you laugh, remember your coffee order, and stick around when things get deep. If you’re a homebody who occasionally craves live music or midnight convos, and you want a drama-free connection (plus a hoodie to “borrow”), DM me. No rush, no pressure—just two weirdos seeing if our chaos aligns. Let’s trade stories and see where it goes.


Thanks for reading, genuinely I'll be around.

This will be our first MSC cruise and we were thinking about getting the non alcoholic drink package since my wife and I don’t drink. 

Now my question is the following. My 5yo and 3yo don’t drink soda at all and really don’t like juice. They mostly drink water or maybe once in a blue moon they will ask for OJ during breakfast. Do I absolutely have to get a drink package for them and waste 200+ dollars on something they will not use? My wife and I enjoy mocktails, coffee, and some specialty drinks by the pool. So for us it’s a no brainer. But bow I feel like this is pretty not cool from MSC if it’s mandatory that minors have it too if in the same cabin.

Ive cruised on Royal, Princess, and NCL and none of those requires minors to be on the same drink package specially a 5yo and a 3yo.

1ky0epk,https://www.reddit.com/r/foodscience/comments/1ky0epk/questions_about_syrup_safety_and_consistency/,Questions about syrup safety and consistency,"Hi all! Hoping this is a good place to post these questions :) 

My coffee shop is wanting to start making our own syrups but I personally want to make sure everything is super safe and consistent before we start rolling it out and have to backtrack if something goes wrong. 

So my knowledge so far is that a 2:1 rich syrup is as high of a concentration as you can get before the sugars will start crystalizing. And that this equates to roughly 67 brix (working on getting a refractometer for checking this.) 

So assuming this base knowledge is right, my first question is: because this is the lowest water content possible without crystalizing sugars, is this the lowest risk concentration for things like mold and bacteria growth?

I’m fairly confident in making syrups that are more straightforward like sugar+water+vanilla bean paste(or cocoa powder/lavender/spices/etc.) where I’m a little more worried is with fruit based syrups and the risk of fermentation, mold, bacteria, etc. 

More on the fruit syrup front: I started an experiment with some cheongs of various fruits using the 1:1 sugar to fruit by weight ratio and they definitely started to ferment after a few days. Everything I’ve seen says that a higher sugar content would have prevented this but didn’t mention how much more sugar. So what would be the lowest sugar content to prevent fermentation in fruit syrups? Or, should I aim for the same ~67 brix measurement to keep water content down and inhibit bacterial growth? Which leads me to my next question: how could I measure the amount of sugar to get a consistent result in these fruit syrups? From what I’ve understood from my little bit of research, I could theoretically measure the brix of the liquid in the fruit, then do math to figure out how much more sugar I need to add to get it to ~67 brix. But I also saw that the refractometers are not necessarily accurate when measuring the sugar content of fruits because it’s just measuring the dissolved solids and not actually the amount of sucrose only (if I understood what I read correctly at least.) 

Or is there some super simple solution that I’m missing and I’m just severely over complicating things for myself?

In all the travels to every corner of the vast country, I had never been in the right place at the right time to see a bear, let alone have my equipment ready to capture some images. This polar bear was seen at the end of April 2025. 

I normally shoot icebergs and landscapes, hence the username. I only spend time in remote parts of Greenland like this area, Ittoqqortoormiit or Scoresbysund. It's the world's largest fjord system and the only place in Greenland where the 350 residents of the town routinely coexist with bears. They also have to survive on the harvest of a small quota of bears every year. Full disclosure. But after the quota is reached, the bears are everywhere. This was such an occasion last month. We saw three bears this day. A lone one and two younger ones near each other - likely 2-year-olds that just left their mother.

The luggage limit is so low that I did not bring my good equipment with me. I have never gotten any passable wildlife in the 20 years I've been a photographer. Just a beat up Fujifilm X-T3 (that was stolen in Iceland later - long story) and the 70-300 with a broken 2x teleconverter (also stolen).

I was so nervous that the batteries would fail but somehow the stars aligned and I was able to spray and pray to get some of these.

I had inspiration from the most well known wildlife photographer in Greenland. His book was on the coffee table so I showed my guide the kind of images I wanted to capture. I did not know that wildlife photography involved having the image in mind from the outset. I waited patiently while the bear swam and turned off my camera to preserve the battery.

I’m still drinking coffee, and eating spicy buffalo chicken, plus way more nuts, (dark) chocolate and salty foods than when I’m not eating keto. So I’m pretty sure it’s none of those common causes of general mouth sores. 

Gluten comes up as a possibility, but while I’m definitely eating way *less* gluten, I doubt I am eliminating it fully as I’ll still eat low carb tortillas, soy sauce and whatever else I’m sure gluten hides in. Could simply reducing gluten eliminate symptoms like this or would it need to be total elimination?

Generally my gut just feels like shit until lunch and then gets better in the afternoons but doesn’t really feel calm ever. It seems like I have a ton of trapped gas because I just rarely pass gas (fart) anymore. It’s either I have diarrhea or it stays inside. If I do it’s not very relieving, and is silent or very quiet. Usually doesn’t smell either. 

I’ve experimented with different kinds of probiotics in the past year and haven’t really found one that works great but I do keep experimenting with new ones because it does help with the amount of times I get the urge. It used to be about 6-10 times now it’s 2-4. Right now I’m using align 24/7 digestive support. 

I recently started taking a multi vitamin (43 days ago), cut out coffee and caffeine in general (24 days ago) and started taking 1 500mg tablet of psyllium husk (13 days ago). I take all of these at night before I go to bed. Even more recently I started taking 1 tablet of NOW super digestive enzymes with lunch and dinner (6 days ago)

The first 5 days of taking the psyllium husk I felt like a new person. I was having 1-2 almost perfect bowel movements a day but then my symptoms came back again after about 5 days.

I realize the dose of these supplements are very low but I read that with fiber you should gradually work your way up. I’m wondering what works best for you all. When should I take them, and how “slow” should I be ramping up my dosages? Also if you have any questions for me I am happy to answer!

My takeaways, for anyone out there following after me: 
1) These were the kindest, friendliest people I’ve ever met worldwide.  
2) The A84 turned my hair white.  Dear heavens above, how do Scots drive and stay sane?  Once we got out into the countryside where the roads were a bit wider (or single track), it was much easier.  
3) In a restaurant, you have to explicitly ask to pay the check.  If you simply say, “we’re all set” or “no, thank you, nothing more,” the servers might pointedly ignore you for as long as you care to sit there.  That was a funny game of chicken until we figured it out. 
4) We were cashless the whole time except for one public toilet in Oban which wanted 50p.  But the distillery gift shop had a lovely restroom for free. 
5) Opening hours for shops and restaurants are shorter than Americans are accustomed to.  Don’t expect anything (even coffee shops) to be open very early.  
6) Speaking of early things, we had great success by getting on the road very early.  The traffic, even just “normal” local traffic on any size road, really added to the overall stress as the day went on.
7) For heaven’s sake, walk a couple of blocks off the high street of the towns and cities, especially Edinburgh.  The Royal Mile felt like Disney/Universal but without the cool roller coasters or efficient crowd management.  Find a local pub and a little guesthouse in a smaller town and you’ll enjoy the hell out of it. 
8) This was one of the best trips of my whole life.  Thank you, Scotland, for the gorgeous scenery, friendly people, fascinating history, delicious food, and all-around good time.

1ky06ue,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1ky06ue,Some bakery and coffee shop reviews from a recent trip,"1. Funny Face Bakery (Seaport) - We walked past this random place and were lured in by the smell. The chocolate chip cookie was surprisingly good if you like that kind of thing (large with a gooey interior and crisp exterior). 4/5
2. Supermoon bakehouse - Walking into this place, we were surprised by its minimalist layout/design. We went here after dinner so basically everything was sold out except ice cream, gelato, and a couple cruffins. We got the ube/pandan ice cream sandwich and the ferrero rocher cruffin. The ice cream sandwich was great! The ice cream itself was sorta salty in a wonderful way and seemed to contain pieces of something, maybe toffee. The cake part of the sandwich was soft and moist. We didn’t enjoy the cruffin much though. The filling was mid and the croissant was good from a technical standpoint, but it wasn’t very “moreish” (as the British would say). We each had a couple bites and then put it away and never finished it. 4/5
3. Sey Coffee - My bf got the Colombian drip coffee which was $6. He found it very good indeed. But it was a large quantity of coffee (I guess that’s typically a good thing though). 4.5/5
4. Radio Bakery - I’d decided prior to this trip that I definitely wasn’t going to go here. I’d heard about the hour-long lines. But we were visiting the Brooklyn Botanic Garden anyways…and we were hungry. So we figured we’d swing by their Prospect Park location and see how long of a wait they had. This was at around 1:30pm on a Sunday. The line was quite short, maybe 5-10 minutes? Most things were sold out, of course. But we were able to get the matcha mango morning bun, chocolate chip cookie, and a tofu sandwich. 2 of the 3 were good. The tofu sandwich was exceedingly delicious, probably in the top three most delicious foods of the trip. Whatever chili oil they use in it is very good. My bf didn’t care so much for the morning bun (he found it “confusing”) but I did enjoy the flavor combination. Very well-made. The chocolate chip cookie, on the other hand…we agreed that they perfectly replicated the taste and texture of a cookie you’d get in the bakery section of a grocery store. I don’t know why they sell such a thing. I’ve made many chocolate chip cookies and never had them taste like they were from a grocery store so this was quite a feat from Radio Bakery. 4/5

Black Fox Coffee (not pictured) - I don’t have a picture but I wanted to note that my bf found this to be very good, perhaps even better than Sey. 5/5



1. Elbow Bread - There was maybe a 10 minute wait on Memorial Day morning. We got the garlic bread bialy, blueberry kolache, and nori chocolate chip cookie. All three were excellent. The blueberries were so flavorful and the nori flavor worked very well in the cookie. Highly recommend. 5/5
2. Roasting Plant Coffee - This place has some cool pneumatic coffee contraption. They have several coffee options and you choose one (my bf got the guatemalan) and then the beans are shot from their receptacle into the grinder and ground up. Unfortunately, bf found the coffee to be kinda bad. 2/5
3. Culture Espresso - This was a great way to end the trip! We’ve been to this place several times before but we’d never tried the corn cookie, only the chocolate chip one. This time, we got both. My bf found the corn cookie, which tastes like a very good sugar cookie with corn, to be even better than the chocolate chip one. Their chocolate chip cookie is kinda similar in structure and texture to the one from funny face bakery, but it tastes even better. Highly recommend. As for the coffee, my bf was disappointed to get cold brew when he asked for iced coffee as he doesn’t typically care for the taste of cold brew. But apparently it was very good cold brew. 5/5",18,1748487451.0,FoodNYC,3,1.0,False

It is reported that this intelligent agent, jointly developed by Luckin Coffee and Volcano Engine, integrates the Doubaoda model to enable functions such as voice ordering, personalized recommendations, and faster ordering, providing users with a new coffee consumption experience of ""ordering coffee with just a few words"".

Leveraging the robust AI capabilities of the Doubaoda model, the Luckin Coffee AI intelligent agent incorporates two core technologies - intent recognition and slot extraction, acting as a well-trained ""intelligent coffee butler"" that accurately predicts consumer ordering preferences based on historical order data.

During the ordering process, the Doubaoda voice recognition model offers a natural voice input experience, allowing users to simply say ""help me order a Coconut Latte"" or input keywords to complete quick voice transcription, accurately understand ordering requirements, analyze specifications, temperature, flavor, and other key information, and automatically match the optimal service process, significantly improving ordering efficiency.

According to the introduction, the Luckin Coffee AI intelligent agent also possesses continuous learning capabilities, able to continuously iterate and optimize based on user feedback, truly achieving ""the more you use, the better it understands you.""",1,1748487186.0,LKNCY,0,1.0,False

I’m a 20F who attends University. I am very extroverted and it's really easy for me to have conversations with strangers and new people I meet. During my Freshman year, I met a lot of new people and even developed a relationship with a lot of these individuals. We would get coffee, do activities, or even pass by each other on campus. However during the end of my Freshman year, I noticed how these same people that I thought we developed a relationship, would never text me, check on me, or barely hangout with me. However I would go out of my way to ask these individuals to hangout or even check up on them once in a while. Flashback to the beginning of my Sophomore year. I noticed the same pattern and had the realization that these individuals were really not my friends.  Because of that I had to cut off these people which has been a relief, yet has made me feel even lonelier during the school year.

The issue is the parents relax a little too much? I was never really familiar with this until seeing it first hand so wanted to know if I’m crazy or other parents have seen this too in these spaces. I’ve been to all kinds of toddler story times, playgrounds, etc and never encountered it.

The parents just do not watch their kids. The age range is wild too, there are 8 year olds running where 10 month old babies are crawling, and I can’t even tell who are their parents. Last week I pulled a baby out of the ball pit because her brother put her in and she was screaming almost completely covered on her back…even when I picked her up and put her down, parents said nothing? Didn’t even see them. Today a baby crawled and got stuck under a sofa before the mom even noticed.  Some of the parents have multiple kids and I’ve heard them yell at their older children (who literally cannot be older than 10) to watch their younger siblings (which they don’t, they want to play as kids should)…and I’ve overheard them boasting about being chill parents who don’t hover over their kids (kids meaning babies and toddlers under 3)

I get we all like to yap and relax but…my kid is 20 months old and I’ll let her walk off in a safe place but I’m watching and usually following her….questioning if I am just a helicopter parent? Is this just a play room thing?",2,1748486933.0,NewParents,0,1.0,False
1ky00ww,https://www.reddit.com/r/scarystories/comments/1ky00ww/the_sound_of_life/,The Sound of Life,"“What is evil?” The question resounded against the walls of the lecture hall

A few students stared at each other, others mumbled off topic.

One student raised his hand. He was pale. Dark wavy hair and dark eyes. 

“Evil is a consensus of ideas about the nature of immorality” he said flatly 

“Evil is subjective, in other words” I stated “and throughout this philosophy course I am going to open your third eyes to its non-existence”

I’m not a skeptic. I thought as class dismissed itself, I’m just trying to explain philosophy.

The boy who answered the question with dark, wavy hair lingered in the hallway. Staring into the classroom almost longingly. 

“Can I help you?” I asked

“Maybe,” he said walking away

The next class filtered in and as we progressed through the initial ideas of nihilism. A student raised his hand. 

It was the same student from the last class. I hesitated, but eventually I motioned to him to go ahead and speak.

“If evil is objective and therefore nonexistent,” he started “does that mean morality is also a farce?”

I paused for a moment at the curious nature of this student. 

“I suppose,” I began slowly “that the concept of evil is the ugly offspring of morality.”

The student beamed.

As the day progressed, I saw the student in almost every lecture. Pretending to leave, but then returning once the bell rang. He must not have wanted to speak face to face. I assumed and shrugged it off. 

It is a strange time for incoming freshman. They are not used to the open minded atmosphere of university and tend to awake with great delusion.

I began to gather up my belongings for the day and exit the rather large lecture hall. Tenure allowed me certain privileges.

“Hey” said a small whisper voice from around the hallway doors

I ignored and continued strolling towards the voice and the exit.

“Please, stop moving” the small voice grew slightly louder

“I’m not sure I have time for this” I said growing disgruntled

There was silence. Finally the voice said,
“I’m curious about death”

I froze. I assumed it must be the new student who attended all my lectures.

“Well, my friend, we all have our interests and it’s nothing to be concerned about-“

“I wanna know how it feels” The voice said

I didn’t move a muscle but felt a twitch in my shoulder. 

“Maybe we could discuss this face to face”

There was silence.

I quickly and quietly moved towards the door at an angle I could see but when I got to my position the student was no longer there.

I made it a point the next day to do roll call with the student that seemed very interested in my lectures.

His name was David Straith. A political science student from the West coast.

I spent the day lecturing, he spent the day listening to my lectures, again,

“There can be no existence of an equal and just consensus of the concept of evil. We all draw the line of true evil differently and those slight variations prove there is no absolute truth.”

I watched the wavy haired student closely.

“You there, where do you draw the line” I asked the student with dark wavy hair, “what is true evil?”

“A life without purpose,” he answered swiftly “a life who does not see its value”

“And for some,” I continued “it is murder…”

The room was silent.

At the end of the day, as I gathered my belongings I noticed a note on my desk and did not see who left it. It read:

*I agree with what you said*
*the values of some remain unchanging*
*while others see the light of truth*

I wondered which student could have left it.

The next day was a break day for me. I kept busy with papers and studying.

That night my phone rang. I do give out my personal number during the first class for any class related questions but I make sure to have my available hours on the same paper.

This was not during them, this call came at 2:07 A.M.

“Hello?” I barely got out before the response

“I know what I have to do to change them,” the voice said 

“Change who?” I asked

“I like when they scream.”

The phone beeped signaling the end of the call.

The next day came swiftly and I was nervous to get back on the saddle. 

The entire day came and went without the appearance of the delusional student.

I sighed relief.

As the evening of lecturing closed and I made my way home I stopped at a quick coffee spot on the way home as per usual.

It was a boutique coffee shop next caddy corner from an abandoned office building.

I walked past the alley of the abandoned building. 

I then heard a familiar whisper,

“Hey”

I followed it down the alley to an open door and went in. No one appeared to be inside and I turned to leave before I heard something distant through the walls. The sound of mourning.

I used to research Sudanese genocides and the sound of wailing instantly caught my ears. I followed it.

On the top floor of this building the sound was clear. I started to run fearing the worst and tripped over a body with its entrails strewn about.

“I got carried away” the voice said

I looked up to see the blood matted hair of the dark wavy student.

He helped me up.

“Come look though. I'm doing what you and I talked about”

Inside the room was an unconscious, bloody student I recognized from class.

“There is no evil” David Straith said “I know you see that”

What I was seeing were stars. The immediate urge to vomit almost betrayed me. 

“Yes, yes” I said trying to remain calm 

“I feel different” David Straith said “I’m proud now”

His beaming smile made me almost roll over right then and there.

“I try not to cut as much off cuz’ I like the sound of life” David Straith stated

I started to move backward slowly, calculating my chances of escape.

“She’s like a newborn baby, full of life” as he bent down to kiss her forehead, I bolted

Blurry eyes running. The hardest I ever have. Down stairs and over desks.

Once outside I ran to the coffee shop and phoned the police.

They still haven’t caught him.

The bad guys still lost 30% to 70%, because their main proponents were not well liked and were very fake/phony (think high school mean girls acting ""nice""), their campaign materials were printed out of town, their campaign workers were from out of town, and they didn't have authentic connections to people.  

Meanwhile, our side was all local, we hand made a lot of our campaign materials (RIP my printer), and we got out and talked to people, remembered their names and the issues they were worried about, and explained stuff to them patiently and in-depth on an individual level if that's what it took. If somebody asked me about my campaign button while I was in a coffee shop, I stopped and answered their questions for as long as I could,  even if it meant my latte got cold. We talked to our family, friends, neighbors, and coworkers.  

Be ready with information and facts about our Great Khan. Be ready to explain your reasons for supporting JB. Be ready to answer people's questions. He's a billionaire, but he wants to tax billionaires! He even spent a bunch of his own money trying to tax Illinois billionaires! He inherited his wealth, but both his parents died before he was an adult and his mom was an alcoholic (relatable!) The tax break on the toilet-less mansion was legal, but it's messed up that tax loophole exists in the first place, and he paid the taxes anyways. He took action to prevent book bans in Illinois, to protect abortion rights in Illinois, and protect trans people in Illinois.  

Now, it helped that our opposition's main guy was almost cartoonishly evil, and many of his campaign staff had obvious disdain for the voters, thinking everyone was too dumb to notice the campaign doing shady shit. That's an important point here - don't condescend to your audience. Don't call them illiterate dumbfucks. Don't blame them for the last election's results. Seriously, DO NOT BLAME THEM for the last election's results. If somebody tells you they didn't expect the leopards to eat their face, grimace slightly and reply that we were *all* lied to*. Commiserate.  

We also memed the heck out of our campaign. Funny memes with the bad guy's face superimposed over 80s movie villains. Serious memes with statistical breakdowns and a catchy hashtag. Info-heavy memes. Easy to understand memes for our moms to Like And Share. Friendly memes, safe memes, snarky memes. Something for everyone. Pritzker Pals are already doing a pretty good job on memes, so share them with your relatives on Facebook. Make some memes your Aunt Karen can understand. Get the name recognition out there. Get the Khan's words of wisdom out there.  

Authentic connections are what people need, not influencers and sponsored content.  

* we were all lied to, but some of us saw the lies for what they were as soon as they were spoken, and some didn't and still don't. Try not to gloat about it.",42,1748486911.0,PritzkerPosting,7,0.95,False

NBME 31 - 71( 3 days )

STEP 1 - 05/07 - PASS

As you can see, my scores were more or less consistent but i did not have a thick buffer, NBME 31 gave me some confidence to sit for the exam. 

I started my prep in the last week of december, got burnt out in mid march, completely lost my mind, took a break for about 2 weeks. 

This journey was full of self doubt and constant frustration because my scores were not increasing, used to cry every alternate day, wanted to give up so many times! (I am an IMG from india).

After NBME 31 felt confident, but for some reason could not study for the last 3 days, and the night before exam, i was extremely nervous, took a zolpidem at 10, felt asleep, woke up at 12:30. Had a fever, took a Dolo, tried to get some sleep but could not. Got out of bed at 5ish, had a cup of coffee, went for a morning walk with my mother who kept telling me ""you,ve studied hard, trust your prep, have some confidence"". 

Exam day - Marked 15-20 questions in the first block, almost ran out of time, took a 5 min break, told myself i am not gonna give up. took a break after every block, felt tired and sleepy after 4th block, had a coffee. Finished the exam, went down, both my parents were waiting for me, got in the car and cried my eyes out. Spent 3 weeks thinking about other options.

I just wanna say that it is very common to feel like you tanked this exam, but have some faith in yourself.

1kxzzz4,https://walrod.substack.com/p/ulysses-at-100,Ulysses at 100: Visiting Joyce's Dublin in 2022,"Like Odysseus himself, *Ulysses* (1922) has come home after a long exile. Its author James Joyce never did. Born in 1882 in Dublin, then part of the United Kingdom, Joyce left for continental Europe in 1904 and returned once, briefly, in 1909. “I will tell you what I will do,” Joyce’s alter ego Stephen Dedalus says in *A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man* (1916),

>

Living and writing in Trieste, Paris, Rome and Zurich, where he is buried, Joyce never set foot in the modern Republic of Ireland, founded as the Irish Free State in 1922. Thus both Joyceans and the Irish nation as a whole celebrate an important centennial this year. The first great retelling/creative reinterpretation of Homer’s *Odyssey*, Virgil’s *Aeneid*, was commissioned by the emperor Augustus as a national epic for the then-new Roman Empire, a mythic origin of both the city of Rome and the Julio-Claudian dynasty. *Ulysses*, released the same year as the founding of modern Ireland, has become a kind of national epic in its own way.

Joyce’s work sparked controversy in his home country since the beginning of his career. He wrote the short stories collected in *Dubliners* between 1904 and 1907 but could not find a willing Irish publisher; the book was finally published by London-based Grant Richards in 1914.

*Ulysses*, serialized in magazines between 1918 and 1920 and first published as a novel by Sylvia Beach’s Shakespeare and Company in 1922, was banned in the United States until 1934 and in the United Kingdom until 1936. Deciding *United States v. One Book Called Ulysses*, district Judge John M. Woolsey read the entire novel — 1,088 pages in a modern Oxford University Press edition — and [concluded](https://law.justia.com/cases/federal/district-courts/FSupp/5/182/2250768/) that *Ulysses* was not pornography but instead an “honest effort to show exactly how the minds of his characters operate.” Joyce’s use of ‘dirty’ words, he argues, reflects a commitment to realism which encompasses the “preoccupation with sex in the thoughts of his characters,” not an appeal to readers’ prurient interests. “*Ulysses* may therefore be admitted into the United States,” as Judge Woolsey famously ends his decision.

In Ireland, however, the novel attracted the ire of the ‘Committee on Evil Literature’ whose agitation led to the creation of the Censorship of Publications Board in 1929; key member William Magennis argued that Ireland needed to protect its youth from “the debasing influences of evil literature” such as *Ulysses*, which he once described as “moral filth.” (Magennis, who taught at University College Dublin while Joyce was a student, is actually mentioned in the novel’s 7th chapter, “Aeolus.” Struggling young lawyer J.J. O’Molloy tells struggling young writer Stephen Dedalus that “Professor Magennis was speaking to me about you,” hinting that Dedalus’ own poetry may be attracting unwanted attention from censors-to-be.)

“The book was simply kept out of the country,” Liz Evers writes in the [*Dictionary of Irish Biography*](https://www.dib.ie/blog/irelands-banned-authors-dib). “It was neither imported nor printed here and thus was not widely available in the country until the 1960s.” While *Ulysses* the novel became available in the sixties, Irish audiences could not see the Oscar-nominated 1967 film adaptation until 2001, when the government finally lifted a 33-year-long ban.

Ireland has embraced Joyce decades after his death, not least because Joycean Dublin has taken its place as a major tourist attraction alongside the Guiness Storehouse and the Book of Kells. Before the switch to the Euro, for instance, Joyce’s portrait adorned the Irish ten pound note. Bloomsday, the celebration of the single fictional day — June 16th, 1904 — chronicled in *Ulysses* has become a multi-day, citywide festival in Dublin involving retracing the steps of the novel’s characters, dressing up in period clothing, reciting passages of Joyce’s prose and consuming food and drink mentioned in the novel. In the words of the Visit Ireland website’s [2022 Bloomsday Guide](https://www.visitdublin.com/guides/bloomsday-guide), “there’s a dizzying array of events both free and ticketed, and something to suit everyone from the literary aficionado to Joycean newbies.”

In addition to the James Joyce Centre and James Joyce Museum (two separate institutions), a variety of Dublin cultural spots celebrated the 100th anniversary of Ulysses, including the National Gallery of Ireland, The Abbey Theatre and the Museum of Literature Ireland. During my stay I visited Lincoln’s Inn pub, which celebrates its historical connection to the author with three exclusive Joycean beers, including Bloomsday Lager and Joyce’s Stout, and Davy Byrne’s pub, which was visited by fictional protagonist Leopold Bloom in *Ulysses* and still serves the lunch he ordered: a gorgonzola sandwich. (Of course I ordered it.) One can buy copies of Joyce’s books, Joyce greeting cards, coffee mugs, 100th anniversary pins, a variety of t-shirts and even a handmade “[James Joyce Decoration](https://shop.nationalgallery.ie/products/james-joyce-decoration?_pos=1&_sid=46f1b7f37&_ss=r),” or stuffed doll. Like Elvis, Joyce has inspired a cohort of impersonators, who don copies of his hat, glasses, eyepatch and walking stick every Bloomsday.

he's kind, charismatic, and also christian (but his practice is lacking) and clearly has an interest in me and i believe i feel the same. i can't stop thinking about him and i believe we went on our first date last night. we were both at uni late and decided to go out for dinner. we went to a secondary location from the school, he drove and paid, drove me to the train station and we stayed in his car for an hour because we missed my train and it was freezing outside.

he has had many experiences with relationships, and for some reason i find that so appealing, as well as his experience in his work field. he's in the army and also has worked with exactly what i want as a career.

but i'm scared. i've been begging and praying to God to give me a sign if he's meant to be in my life; either husband or learning experience, as i have NEVER been in a relationship before or have had a crush like this.

he's offering a second dinner, or in general a second catch up like coffee before class. but even if we get into a relationship i don't think it will work out. i'm moving universities at the end of this semester, he lives three hours away from me (if he's looking after his brother. he lives an hour from me if he's living on campus) and works two jobs part time.

i don't even know if i love him, but we work so well together. we have so much in common, but then again it could just be the honeymoon friend phase. i just have a lot of overwhelming thoughts and anxiety but i'm wondering... should i continue? i'm so scared, like so extremely scared. of getting hurt, of embarrassing myself. i've never dated, i've never been in a relationship, i've never had a mutual crush with someone before. but it's so clear that something could happen and i guess i just don't know what to do.

additionally, many are concerned about the age gap. what 22 year old guy do you usually hear taking out an 18 year old girl for dinner and paying, even platonically? i genuinely do know i am mature for my age, many of my mid-twenties and even thirties friends are always confused about my age because i've been through so much and have a lot of spiritual wisdom, more than they do. i am blessed with this knowledge and my maturity from God, but still.. the numbers are off-putting. i'm not very concerned but when looking back in retrospect, it does become concerning.

We have worked together for a little over a year on the same team, but she does not report to me, although I’m in a more senior role. 

We live in different countries though I feel we communicate constantly - over Zoom, Slack and WhatsApp and have great rapport, always joking and laughing

We recently had our company meetings at headquarters. It’s the second time we’ve been together in person. She sat next to me almost every meal, event, bar outing. We talked and laughed constantly. I feel such a connection with her, unlike I’ve felt before. 

We were talking one day and I came to learn she’s thinking about leaving. I was crushed and I told her so. We had a really heartfelt conversation and I told her I hope she sticks around and this would suck if it were the last time we were together in person. She seemed a bit emotional in the discussion too. We went on to have a fun night, the last one before we went home. 

I am not suave, I could not think of a way to ask her back to my room. I’m also not so forward, and also feel there is a risk of upsetting her, losing our friendship, or risking my job, if I were to invite her to my room. 

That night we were texting. I said how much fun I have with her; she said “me too”. And I said “there is more I’d like to say but it’s late…” but I didn’t get an answer. 

The next day the two of us plus two other coworkers traveled the airport together. We sat having coffee before each of our respective flights. She was the first to go, and gave our two coworkers hugs, then me. She walked away, then turned back and gave me another hug and said quietly “I love you”

I was dumbstruck. I couldn’t speak. She walked away and I just stared. 

A few minutes later I went over to her gate, found her and gave her another hug. I lingered a bit, and then said “let’s talk when you get home.” 

I was on such a high. But then I started thinking - what if she meant just as friends? 

She hasn’t given me any crystal clear messages or hints like “I want you” but I’m not sure if it’s a cultural thing, if she’s playing hard to get or what. I feel like it’s a bit of mixed signals, and when she said “I love you” oh man did that mess me up. 

We have continued talking since we both returned home, basically every day on WhatsApp. She asked if I’d come visit, but made it sound like she wanted time to visit the rest of our coworkers at that office too. 

I don’t know how to interpret this, and I’m not sure of a good way to broach the subject without making her feel uncomfortable or risking our friendship (not to mention risking my job if I’m completely wrong). Any advice on how to address it with her? 

TLDR; I feel a strong connection with my coworker but I’m not sure if I’m overblowing things or, if I’m right, how to talk to her about it? ",1,1748485596.0,relationships,4,1.0,False

I recently rented a 2022 Mazda Miata ND RF and absolutely loved the drive but ran into some fitment issues due to my height (6’3”, 195 lbs). I was able to make the stock seat work *just* enough for normal street driving but when I hit the canyons, my shins started digging into the dash and more critically, the rearview mirror blocked a huge portion of my forward-right visibility. I had to duck to see around it which feels unsafe in tight turns.

I believe an aftermarket seat mounted lower (e.g., Bride, Sparco, or custom rails) could solve the problem but before I commit to buying a used Miata and spending the money on mods, I’d really appreciate the chance to **sit in (or take a short ride in)** an ND RF that’s already been set up this way.

**Anyone in the Los Angeles or San Francisco area** with a low-mounted aftermarket seat in their ND RF willing to let me check out the setup? I’ll bring coffee, beer, or lunch as a thank you, whatever your style.

Appreciate any help or advice!",1,1748485481.0,Miata,2,1.0,False

That night I had to tell my mom and younger brother. The next day I received a call from the coroner of the county to give me information. They told me he had been there for 6-8 weeks in his apt since he died, and was found by a maintenance man posting his second late rent notice. I authorized an autopsy and started making arrangements to travel to that county to sign for his belongings and begin cleaning out his apartment. Cleaning out the apartment was the most traumatic thing I have ever done, he had just moved in to this apartment and didn’t even unpack anything. The entire apartment looked like wild dogs had been living there using the whole place as a toilet and ordering ipa six packs on DoorDash. Apparently it is known as coffee ground emesis and is a symptom of end stage alcoholism. He didn’t ever reach out for help from anyone. He was going through tons of Valium from a dark web source and the spot where he was found in his apartment has basically been dissolved from where he laid on it. 

I don’t know how I am going to go forward, I keep having nightmares and not eating. I have to be back at work and I can barely function or take care of myself.

1kxzigf,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1kxzigf/husband_34m_says_ive_32f_changed_and_thats_a/,Husband (34m) says I’ve (32f) changed and that’s a problem.,"TL;DR:
OP (32F) has been married to her husband (34M) for 7 years, together for 10. After years of dismissing relationship issues as life stress, therapy has helped her recognize emotional abuse and neglect from her husband, who has shown increasing narcissistic behavior since they had children. He criticizes her for “changing” (i.e., becoming a responsible parent), while he avoids parenting responsibilities, smokes weed, and contributes little at home. She’s overwhelmed as a stay-at-home mom to three kids (with twins on the way), while he’s disengaged and demanding. Attempts at counseling failed, and he’s made threats when she tried to leave. Despite some good moments as a father, he refuses to acknowledge his role in their issues, leaving her torn and emotionally exhausted.————————-

Husband (34M) and myself (32F) have been together 10 years, married 7 years. The past couple years have been rough, but we’ve weathered through it….more like I’ve just ignored it thinking it was ‘just the season of life’ we were in and a series of misfortunes that had caused the rough patches. The past couple months I’ve been doing weekly therapy, which has made me realize husband is emotionally abusive, and I’m too much of a pushover to address the behaviour. He has a lot of narcissistic tendencies that didn’t start showing up until we started having kids 6 years ago. I’ve gotten up the nerve a couple times to probe deeper into little things my husband has said to me, and it’s basically come to light that since having kids I’ve changed too much for him and he doesn’t consider me fun anymore. 
When I probed deeper on that, he said because I don’t smoke weed all day everyday anymore. ( because we have 3 young children and I’m currently pregnant again with twins ) I don’t view it as changing- more like evolving and you know, becoming a responsible parent. Husband goes to work, comes home smokes weed and cigarettes outside in the garage while scrolling his phone, comes and joins us for dinner MAYBE if I’m lucky we’ll get to watch a tv show together, then he’s back outside until I text him that the kids are ready for bed to which he comes inside and plays with them for 10-20 minutes, leaves me to put them to bed and goes back outside. I’m a stay at home mom and am basically responsible for everything around the house and kids. I RARLEY get time to just scroll on my phone and just chill because there is too much work to be done around the house. I don’t get to sit down until around 10pm- to which he says that’s my own fault because I could just leave ‘all the mess’ until tomorrow and relax- which in reality yeah I could, but then we would have plates and old food sitting out because nobody can clean up after themselves, and it would give me that much more work to do the next day, plus I’m required to make sure not only the kids lunches are made, but his as well and his coffee mugs are hand washed only and placed in the correct spot otherwise I get yelled at. If I do manage to get free time and try to spend it with him, he gets super annoyed at me. He tells me he loves me, but his actions have shown me otherwise. I really feel like he just wanted a family because ‘that’s what a man’s supposed to do’ and he’s not up for the actual responsibility of it. He’d be happier getting ‘a newer model’ who hasn’t been ‘damaged’ by childbirth, who isn’t too tired, who can keep the house clean because there isn’t a bunch of kids running around, who has no problem being intimate all the time. ( currently we have no intimacy. It’s hard to get over the fact I feel like an object from the way I’ve been treated like one, plus all he ever does is expect me to be foaming at the mouth for him and instantly ready to go. ) 
I’ve put so much time and effort into this relationship and honestly just want to feel like I felt in the first 4-5 years before kids again where he treated me like I was his everything. 
Yes, we’ve tried couples counselling ( one time ) he’ll never do it again. Yes, I’ve tried leaving with the kids and taking a break and that resulted in one week of good behaviour and him threatening to end himself if I ever did it again. I’ve thought of leaving for good, but he promised to destroy me if I ever did and honestly I wouldn’t put it past him to do everything in his power to ruin my life or steal the kids and run. 
My therapist eludes to ‘if he doesn’t want to see himself as a problem, or a part of that problem and has no desire to improve himself or fix himself than what’s the point in staying?’ But I mean, when he does spend time with the kids he’s a great dad and they would be absolutely crushed if we divorced. I’m at a loss on how to verbalized or show him that maybe it’s not the fact I changed, but maybe it’s the fact he hasn’t that’s caused us to become stagnant.

Option 2: Ice fishing game. This game seems harder to make due to its larger amount of content and lots of moving things on the screen. This is the game that my friends all say I should make but I am not sure if they are blinded by nastalgia due to this game being super fun.

Note: Due to time restraints, there is a chance I would need to cut some content from the ice fishing game such as a few of the hazards, but I would not cut anything from the other game.

I recently reconnected with someone I dated 6 years ago that I was very smitten with, but the timing was off as I was moving abroad and it fizzled out because of that. So I always thought about what could have been.

So I recently reach out as we both moved to the same city and I had figured out he is recently out of a long term relationship. Side note, when I reached out he did not know I knew this. So we meet up and he told me he ended things in March (said my timing is crazy as he is recently single…. Sir I knew that already🤭😆).

We’ve hung out 3 times in the past month but no explicit dates… just coffees and happy hour. He has been busy with his PhD studies so I haven’t been pressing to hang out much as I understand it’s demanding at the moment. 

When we do hang out, he is borderline flirty (gives multiple compliments on my physical features, mentions how we get along so well, etc) but nothing explicit to indicate he’s 100% interested. Which I understand, he is newly single. He does seem generally happy with his decision to be single again, and while I haven’t pressed for details about the breakup, he gives me the impression that that was that and he is going no contact.

Sooooooo, my question is, how long did it take you to get over a LTR? I am excited at the prospect of continuing to get to know this version of him, but don’t want to be delusional in thinking he’s ready to explore anything yet. Totally fine. Just want to strike a balance and be realistic about timing :)
