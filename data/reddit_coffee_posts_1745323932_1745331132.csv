I had a slight taper, and still the ensuing 10 days were a brutal slog of paranoia, anxiety, full on panic attacks, tiredness, insomnia, and other sypmtoms (here's the [1 week post](https://www.reddit.com/r/decaf/comments/1jmobqu/one_week_down_feels_like_im_coming_apart_at_the/) I made).

&nbsp;

On the 10 day mark I had (what seems to be) my last true moment of panic due to withdrawal.  I woke up early in the morning and I couldn't calm my brain or my emotions.  It felt like everything was dialed up to 11 with no way to compensate or work through the panic.

&nbsp;

Since that day things have slowly gotten better.  It might be all psychological, but I feel as if life moves at a slower pace.  I feel less panic and anxiety.  I feel more relaxed and less frustrated at minor inconveniences.  And I find myself happier, even sillier, and more prone to letting life happen instead of trying to maximize efficiency in every waking moment.

&nbsp;

The downsides have been mostly physical.  Sleep has been intermittent and sometimes impossible.  At times I wake up hours before my alarm and my brain simply says ""you're up for the day.""  This occurred much more in the 2-3 week period than in the last week (but on the positive side I don't find myself anxious over the possibility of it happening again - if it happens, it happens).

&nbsp;

The biggest negative issue has been GI changes.  For years I lived the rhythm of wake up, eat, coffee, bathroom.  And my gut seemed to be tentatively ok with that schedule and diet.  Removing coffee (and caffeine) from my daily schedule has been like setting off a bomb in my gut.  They say it can take several months to restore, fix, or rebuild gut health so I'm taking the long view on this and eating and drinking fermented foods with live cultures every day. (Even being able to take the long view and not being anxious about this process is something I could have never done while on caffeine - I would have been googling it every five minutes).

&nbsp;

tl;dr The first 10 days were brutal. The ensuing 21 days have been getting better. I cannot imagine a future where coffee & caffeine are a part of my life.",2,1745330931.0,decaf,0,1.0,False

# Introduction

Imagine tapping into the magic of viral videos without ever picking up a camera. That’s the promise of Viral Valet, a clever tool that lets you ride the wave of trending content to drive traffic and grow your online presence. Whether you’re an affiliate marketer, a small business owner, or just starting out in digital marketing, this cloud-based app makes it simple to create engaging videos by legally repurposing what’s already working. The Viral Valet Bundle takes it up a notch, packing every feature, upgrade, and bonus into one exclusive package at a 60% discount. 

But here’s the catch—this deal won’t last long. Let’s break down why this bundle is a game-changer and how it can help you get free viral traffic in any niche.

# What is Viral Valet?

Viral Valet is a cloud-based tool designed to make video marketing accessible to everyone, even if you’ve never created a video before. It’s built around the idea of legally leveraging existing viral videos to create your own content that grabs attention. Instead of starting from scratch, you can take trending videos from platforms like TikTok, YouTube, Instagram, or Facebook and transform them into something fresh using features like split-screen, stitch-style, or reaction videos.

The core idea is simple: find what’s already resonating with audiences, add your unique spin, and share it to drive traffic to your offers, products, or brand. It’s not about copying content illegally—Viral Valet ensures you’re working within platform guidelines, so you can focus on creating without worrying about copyright issues. Whether you’re adding commentary, reactions, or branding elements, this tool streamlines the process so you can publish attention-grabbing videos in minutes.

# The Viral Valet Bundle: What’s Included?

The Viral Valet Bundle is the ultimate package, combining the core app with every upgrade and bonus for a fraction of the usual cost. Here’s what you get when you grab this exclusive deal:

* **Viral Valet Web App**: The heart of the system, giving you access to all creation tools and analytics from any device.
* **Split-Screen Creator**: Combine your content with viral videos in a side-by-side format that’s perfect for reactions or comparisons.
* **Stitch-Style Video Generator**: Mimic TikTok’s popular stitch feature to add your take to trending clips.
* **Commercial Rights**: Create and sell videos for clients, opening up a new revenue stream.
* **Done-For-You Features**: Pre-made scripts, reaction videos, and an influencer database to save you time and effort.
* **Monthly Video Creation Limits**: Depending on your plan, you can create a set number of videos each month, with tracking to manage your output.
* **Account Tracking Capabilities**: Monitor your videos’ performance and optimize based on real data.

This bundle includes every one-time offer (OTO) and upgrade, so you’re not left piecing things together later. It’s a complete toolkit for anyone serious about leveraging viral content to grow their brand or business.

# Features That Set Viral Valet Apart

What makes Viral Valet stand out in a sea of video marketing tools? It’s the combination of simplicity and powerful features that cater to both beginners and seasoned creators. Here’s what I love about it:

* **Done-For-You Viral Video Library**: The app comes loaded with thousands of pre-selected viral videos across niches like fitness, food, tech, and more. The library is updated regularly to keep you on top of the latest trends, so you’re never stuck searching for inspiration.
* **Trend and Account Analysis**: Want to know why a video went viral? Viral Valet’s tools let you analyze trending videos and accounts to uncover what’s working in your niche. It’s like having a cheat sheet for creating content that pops.
* **All-in-One Video Creation Modes**: Whether you prefer split-screen for side-by-side reactions, stitch-style for seamless transitions, or picture-in-picture for a professional touch, the app has you covered. These modes make your videos look polished without needing advanced editing skills.
* **Performance Analytics**: Track how your videos are performing across platforms. See which ones are getting views, likes, and shares, and use those insights to tweak your strategy for better results.
* **Cloud-Based Accessibility**: No downloads or complicated setups. Access Viral Valet from your phone, tablet, or laptop, and create videos wherever you are.

These features make it easy to jump in and start creating content that resonates, even if you’re not a video editing pro. The analytics and trend tools are especially handy for staying ahead of the curve.

# Who Can Benefit from Viral Valet?

Viral Valet is versatile enough to work for a wide range of users, no matter your experience level or goals. Here’s who I think will get the most out of it:

* **Affiliate Marketers**: Use viral videos to drive traffic to your affiliate links. A quick reaction video showcasing a product can grab attention and boost clicks.
* **E-commerce Store Owners**: Create engaging videos to highlight your products. Pair trending content with your brand to increase visibility and sales.
* **Content Creators and Influencers**: Grow your following by jumping on viral trends. The stitch-style feature is perfect for adding your personality to popular clips.
* **Local Businesses**: Attract nearby customers with videos that tap into community trends or local events. A split-screen reaction to a local festival could draw in foot traffic.
* **Beginners in Digital Marketing**: If you’re new to video marketing, Viral Valet’s done-for-you tools and simple interface make it easy to start without feeling overwhelmed.

I’ve seen firsthand how this tool can work for different niches. For example, I used it to create a quick split-screen video for a local coffee shop, pairing a trending coffee-making clip with their branding. The result? A spike in social media engagement and more customers through the door.

# How to Use Viral Valet in 3 Simple Steps

One of the best things about Viral Valet is how straightforward it is to use. You don’t need to be a tech wizard to get started. Here’s how it works:

1. **Pick a Viral Video**: Browse the pre-loaded library of trending videos or paste a video URL to analyze its performance. The app shows you what’s hot in your niche, so you can choose a clip with proven appeal.
2. **Create Your Version**: Use the built-in tools to customize the video. Add your reaction, overlay text, or apply effects like filters or transitions. The split-screen and stitch-style options make it easy to blend your content with the original.
3. **Publish**: Once your video is ready, post it directly to platforms like TikTok, YouTube, Instagram, or Facebook. The app integrates seamlessly, so you can share with a single click.

I tried this process myself, and it took less than 10 minutes to create a reaction video for a trending fitness challenge. The video got more views than my usual posts, proving how powerful this approach can be. Ready to try it yourself?[ Get the Viral Valet Bundle today](https://softtechhub.us/Viral%20Valet%20Bundle).

# Pricing and Bundle Details

The Viral Valet Bundle is designed to give you everything at a steep discount. The front-end offer starts at a low price, but the bundle is where the real value lies. For a one-time payment, you get the core app plus all OTOs, including:

* **Agency+ Upgrades**: Create unlimited videos and manage client accounts, perfect for starting a video marketing agency.
* **Picture-in-Picture Mode**: Add a professional touch by overlaying your content in a corner of the viral video.
* **DFY Reaction Videos Library**: Access pre-made reaction clips to save time on content creation.
* **DFY Influencer Database**: Connect with influencers in your niche to amplify your reach.

Buying each upgrade separately would cost hundreds more, but the bundle wraps it all into one package at a 60% lifetime discount. The exact price depends on the launch phase, but early-bird buyers can lock in the lowest rate. Compared to other video marketing tools, this is a steal for the features you get.

# Bonuses Included in the Bundle

The Viral Valet Bundle comes with some fantastic bonuses that make it even more appealing:

* **Agency Rights**: Create and sell videos for clients, turning Viral Valet into a side hustle or full-fledged business.

* **30-Day Viral Challenge Blueprint**: A step-by-step plan to grow your audience with daily actions, perfect for staying consistent.

These bonuses are a huge win, especially the agency rights and script templates. I used one of the templates for a client video, and it saved me hours of brainstorming. The 30-day challenge is also great for keeping you motivated.

# Pros and Cons of Using Viral Valet

Like any tool, Viral Valet has its strengths and areas to consider. Here’s my take:

Pros

* Saves time by letting you skip original video creation. You’re repurposing proven content instead.
* Beginner-friendly interface that doesn’t require editing experience.
* Monetization opportunities for affiliate marketers, businesses, and agencies.
* Works seamlessly with major platforms like TikTok, YouTube, and Instagram.

Cons

* Basic plans have a cap on monthly video creations, which might limit heavy users.
* Advanced features like analytics take a bit of time to master if you’re new.

Overall, the pros far outweigh the cons, especially if you grab the bundle with unlimited video creation options.[ Don’t miss out—get the Viral Valet Bundle now](https://softtechhub.us/Viral%20Valet%20Bundle).

# Why Choose the Viral Valet Bundle?

The Viral Valet Bundle is the best way to get full access to every feature and upgrade without breaking the bank. Here’s why it’s worth it:

* **Complete Access**: You get every tool, from the core app to advanced OTOs, in one package.
* **Cost Savings**: The 60% lifetime discount means you save big compared to buying upgrades individually.
* **Priority Support**: Bundle users get faster responses from the support team, which is a lifesaver if you need help.
* **Agency Potential**: With commercial and agency rights, you can build a business creating videos for clients.

I’ve used other video tools before, but none offer this level of value in a single package. The ability to start a viral video marketing agency is a huge draw for anyone looking to turn this into a profitable venture.

# Refund Policy

Not sure if Viral Valet is right for you? The 30-day money-back guarantee has you covered. If you try the tool and don’t see the results you expected, you can request a full refund within 30 days of purchase. It’s a risk-free way to test the app and see how it fits into your marketing strategy. I appreciate this policy because it shows the creators are confident in their product.

# Launch Timeline and Availability

The Viral Valet Bundle launched on April 21, 2025, with early-bird pricing available for a limited time. The 60% discount is only guaranteed during the initial launch phase, and prices are set to increase after the first few days. If you’re reading this shortly after the launch, you still have a chance to lock in the deal. After the early-bird period, the bundle will remain available, but at a higher price. My advice?

TLDR : How does one go about being granted the status of ""honourary Canadian"" for the purposes of watching ice hockey?

NTLDR : Having only watched two ice hockey games in the previous 48 years of my life (London Knights at the London Arena in about 2001, and a game at Alexandra Palace in 2004), the family and I went with friends to watch UK team the Sheffield Steelers take on the Manchester Storm a couple of months ago and I was hooked. 

On returning home, I found highlights of NHL games on Youtube, but (a) there were adverts, and (b) they're only ten minutes long. 

I started just watching one a day, but it wasn't enough, and I was soon watching three or four a night. 

I told myself I wasn't an addict, that I only did it socially, and I could quit any time I wanted to, but at three o'clock one morning, after I'd finished binge-watching ""Faceoff : Inside the NHL"", I realised deep down, that I was lying to myself. I got up, watching the crumbs of Pringles fall off my unshaven chest on to the carpet, reached for my wallet, and subscribed to NHL TV.

It still wasn't enough. I needed skin in the game. I needed a team to support. 

I don't have a great record of supporting things in sport - any time I bet on the Grand National, the horse I back tends to not just fall over, but then be shot. I supported Nottingham Forest for three years in the late 90s, during which they were relegated from the Premier League. Twice. At least in the NHL, I told myself, you can't get relegated. Probably.

I studied all the teams carefully, then immediately discounted all US teams - sorry, but it's my small form of protest against the Mango Mussolini.   
  
From the remainder, I rapidly settled on the Habs - I didn't realise, at that point, that they were in the running for the playoffs. They had a storied history, a great logo, and they got additional points for the Franglais name.

I should mention, at this stage, that my wife used to play, but has plumped for the Rangers as her team of choice. I don't think it's quite a divorceable offence, but I'm checking with my lawyer.

I have invested in a baseball cap (pictured) to wear when watching games (which I tend to do on catch-up, as they're on at an unsocial hour over here). I have also invested in a little Canadian flag badge to wear, just in case anyone who walks in on me watching a game gets confused and thinks I'm American.

Other than that, are there any other steps I have to take to be granted the privilege of being considered an honourary Canadian for the purposes of watching the Habs play? 

If it helps sway any committee decisions, I am happy to learn the national anthem (in both English and French). I will be unfailingly nice to everyone, sipping coffee out of a Tim Horton's cup whilst eating maple syrup by the spoonful. But if there are any other things I need to do, then let me know. If there's some sort of ceremony, or someone could perhaps make an official pronouncement, then I will happily print that out and ensure I've got it on my person, and will present upon demand, when watching games.

Thank you in advance, fellow Habs.

Should I send a ‘closure’ text or wait?,"I(25M) went on a date yesterday with someone(35M) I’d been talking to for a few days. Honestly, I thought the date went really well. We sat and talked for about two and a half hours, and he even drove me home afterward. While grabbing coffee, I paid, and he said something like, “I’ll get it next time,” so I thought there *would* be a next time.

When I got home, I texted him to say, “Thanks again, I’m really glad we met,” and he replied, “I’m glad too, thanks.” I liked his message, but he didn’t say anything more. I was kinda waiting for a “good night” text, but eventually gave in and messaged, “Good night then, and kisses to Momo” (his dog). He replied like an hour and a half later with, “Good night, I was already asleep lol.”

This morning, I was hoping he’d text first, but he didn’t. So around 10:40 AM I messaged, “Hey, how are you feeling? Are you feeling better after the cold yesterday?” (He’d mentioned being a bit sick the day before and getting a bit cold.)  
It’s now 5 PM and still no reply.

I’m starting to wonder if I should just send a closure text. I genuinely thought we had a good time, and I felt a connection, so this silence is confusing.

For a bit of context:  
When we first started talking on an app, he asked to move to Telegram. At first, he was sending really short, one-word replies, and I told him it was hard to keep a conversation going like that. He said it was weird of me to bring that up so early, that we’d just started chatting, and then ended the convo with something like, “Hope you find someone who suits you.” I replied “OK,” and when my message didn’t go through, I assumed he blocked me — so I blocked him too.  
Later he messaged me on the app again, saying I didn’t need to block him there. I told him I thought *he* had blocked me, and explained that I just didn’t feel we were able to communicate well. He admitted he hadn’t been very available, but didn’t want to leave me on read either.

So now I’m torn — if I send a quick “ending” message, will it trigger that same weird energy from before? But at the same time, it’s been nearly a full day and he still hasn’t responded. What would you do?",1,1745330338.0,dating_advice,1,1.0,False

So I went on a trip to Japan last month and tried the matcha latte from both Beck's Coffee Shop and Starbucks, I kid you not when I say they were the most delicious matcha latte I've ever had in my entire life lol (same with matcha ice creams, so freaking good).

I want to replicate the recipe at home but I don't know what they use to sweeten it, tried adding white sugar to one yesterday and it absolutely butchered the mix.

Any ideas would be greatly appreciated!!

I just broke rule 2,"[Part 1](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1k47cw8/comment/modya8c/?context=3)





*Rule 2: Don’t answer calls after 3:00 a.m.*

Since you guys are paying attention, I figured I’d tell you a little more about myself. I left a link above for a list of the rules and what I have encountered so far.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Working the night shift wasn’t exactly part of my master plan.

But after a nervous breakdown at my last job, I needed something quiet. Something far away from screaming bosses, impossible deadlines, and the kind of stress that turns your bones to dust.

So here I am. Working overnights at a tow company with a car loan at 26% interest, a binder labeled ""New Tuna"" that contains everything I need to know about my job... and... this list that some old guy left on my desk.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

The system we use is called PulsePoint. It tracks trucks via GPS, lets me assign calls, upload videos, and stream live footage from the field. Each truck is equipped with three cameras: a front-facing dashcam that shows the road, a cabin cam mounted inside to monitor the driver (oh, trust me, they LOVE that), and a rear camera bolted to the back of the truck. Supposedly for ""safety."" The official reason is to protect us during accidents or disputes.

Unofficially?

I think Henry, or whomever is really running this operation, uses it to make sure wheel lift drivers aren’t driving with their booms down.

My job’s pretty simple.

A call comes in, I log the info, assign it to a driver, and monitor their progress.

That’s it.

No customers. No pressure.

Just me, the screen, and whatever snacks I remember to bring. But I don't think you guys care much about that... and I really need to tell you about what happened this past shift.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

The night was going pretty normal. I had Tyler working on heavy duty, Mike on personal property impounds, and Damon on call just in case we got a police call.

It was just after 3:00 a.m. when the phone rang. The sound cut through the silence like a jack knife. The caller ID... blank. Numbers scrambled in a way that didn’t look accidental. I stared for a second too long before answering.

""Thank you for calling Henry's Runners and Wreckers. How can I help you?""

A woman’s voice came through. She was breathless, frantic.

“Please. There’s been an accident. Route 19 just past Wells Hollow. My husband’s unconscious. He won’t wake up.”

Now this was already odd for me because I am not a police dispatcher. The police are the ones who call me, but I was told during my training that it is not unheard of when people are in accidents they sometimes call us after they call the police if the accident is not that bad. I slipped into routine. Got the location, exact coordinates, and entered it into PulsePoint. Assigned the job to Tyler, one of our newer guys, since he was the closest (4 minutes out). We hadn’t met in person, but he seemed solid. Friendly, too. I liked him.

I tried to keep her talking. “Is he breathing? Are you hurt? Do you need help contacting police?”

“I already called them. They said they’re on the way. But someone needs to get the car out of here. It's not safe,” she said.

It made no sense, but I did not argue.

“There was something in the road. He swerved. We hit the guardrail.”

Her voice started to fade. The line went quiet, but I still heard faint breathing. Or something that sounded like breathing.

“Ma’am?”

Click.

I stared at the phone and then at the screen. Tyler’s icon was moving down the highway, closing in on the location. I was just about to call the police to make sure they got a call from her and it wasn't some prank, but the dispatch phone rang. It was Tyler.

“Hey, Rach? I’m here. There’s nothing. No car, no wreck, no people. Just road.”

I pulled up the front-facing dashcam. His headlights stretched ahead into the dark. Just pavement and trees.

I switched to the rear camera.

That’s when I saw it.

Something was there.

Tall. Upright. Just beyond the glow of the taillights.

It wasn’t moving. Not even a little. Not the kind of stillness you expect from a person or an animal caught in headlights. This was different. Intentional. Like it had settled into place long before Tyler ever pulled up.

Like it had been waiting.

The dark clung to it in a strange way. Not like a shadow. More like the world around it didn’t recognize it. As if the light knew something was wrong and chose to pass it by. Not avoiding. Just forgetting.

No features. No face. No eyes. Just a shape. Still. Watching.

But it didn’t feel like it was watching the truck.

It felt like it was watching the camera.

Watching me.

Like it knew I was there. Like it had been aware of me long before I noticed it.

And for a second, I wasn’t sure who was really looking in on whom.

I swallowed. “Tyler... don't get out. Can you check behind your truck? Put the truck in reverse. Do you see anything?”

“Okay?” he asked, unsure why I wanted him to, but doing it anyway. “It’s just trees back there. Why?”

I flipped to the cabin cam to make sure he was looking. He was.

I switched back to the rear cam.

The figure was gone.

Before I could react, the phone rang again. Same scrambled number. I picked up.

“Dispatch.”

“It’s me,” the woman said. Her voice was softer now. Distant. Detached. “Are they coming?... Are you coming?”

I steadied my voice and tried to maintain my composure. “Our driver is already there,” I said. “But he can’t find you.”

“I see you,” she whispered. “He just doesn’t see us.”

I gripped the receiver tighter, uneasy with her choice of words. “Stay on the line. I’ll have him check again.”

I switched back to Tyler.

“Can you drive up and down that stretch one more time? She swears she sees you.”

“Sure,” he sighed, almost as though he had accepted the fact that this was some prank, but I wouldn't. “But there’s still nothing. It’s just empty.”

I watched his headlights scan the road. Nothing. No wreck. No body. No trace.

Before I could speak, the woman’s voice returned. Like she had waited until I came back.

“He’s here with me now,” she whispered.

Quiet.

Too quiet.

“But he’s not breathing.”

My mouth went dry. “Ma’am, who’s with you?”

She hesitated.

“I didn’t make it.”

Then the line went dead.

I stared at the screen. My hands hovered over the keyboard, useless. I switched back to Tyler.

“I’ve looped around twice. Still nothing. Want me to keep looking?”

“No,” I said. “You’re clear. Head back in.”

“Copy that.”

I checked the CRM for that scrambled number. Buried in the history was a note. All it said was:

DO NOT ANSWER THIS CALL AFTER 3 A.M.  
\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

That morning, when the sky finally started to bleed gray and the weight of night began to lift, I found Carl out in the shop.

Carl was supposed to be retired. At least, that’s what the company email said. But there he was, leaning against the side of his former flatbed, coffee in one hand, cigarette in the other, staring at the concrete like he expected it to crack open beneath him.

I stepped into the shop slowly, still shaken from the night.

“You’re not gone yet?” I asked.

He didn’t look up. “Came to grab my last paycheck,” he muttered. “Left a couple things in the toolbox.”

He took a sip of coffee, then added, almost like it hurt to say it, “Guys like me don’t really retire. We just fade out.”

I hovered in the doorway, unsure if I should bring it up. But the silence between us was too loud, too expectant. So I did.

“I got an email the other day…” I began, not knowing how on earth to explain it.

Carl finally looked at me, eyes unreadable. “You got it, then?”

I nodded. “That was you? It didn’t have a sender. Just a blank address. How did you even do that?”

He didn’t answer. Instead, he took another drag of his cigarette and stared toward the dispatch office.

He stared at me for a moment. Then, almost too softly, he said, “You didn’t reboot after it blinked, did you?”

“It’s not about the window,” he said. “Not really. The window’s just where they knock first.”

“What the hell is going on, Carl? I need direct answers. None of this cryptic shit.” It was a demand, but it came out as a plea.

He just stared at me. His eyes sizing me up. Almost as though he was trying to see if I was ready to hear what he had to say.

“Fuck this. You guys are messing with me,” I said and turned on my heels, starting to head out.

“You spoke to her?” he asked.

The question made me freeze dead in my tracks. I slowly turned around. When our eyes met, he didn’t need to elaborate on who it was.

We both knew.

I nodded.

“I’ve heard that voice before,” he said after a long moment. “It was years ago. Maybe thirty-nine or so. I was new. First year on flatbed. My dad was retiring, so he was showing me the ropes.”

He lit another cigarette. His hands were steady, but his voice had gone low. Empty.

“Call came in from PD. Said a car had swerved off Route 19 near Hollow. They wanted a flatbed because it was too mangled for a wheel lift.”

He looked up at me for a second, then away again.

“I remember pulling up. It was still dark. Police were already on scene, lights spinning through the trees. But there was no one in the car.”

He took a long drag and exhaled slowly.

“There was blood. A lot of it. Driver’s side. Passenger side. Smeared across the windshield. But no bodies. No footprints. No drag marks. Just a warm car and empty seats.”

I stayed quiet. My throat felt tight.

“We waited,” he said. “Watched the cops comb the woods for what seemed like a lifetime before they told us to get the car out of there.”

He glanced at the far wall, like the memory was still playing out there in the shadows.

“They never found anyone. Not that night. Not ever. But that’s not the part that sticks with you.”

I waited.

“The part that sticks,” he said, flicking ash onto the floor, “is that the calls never stopped. Always the same time. Always a number that doesn’t look right. Always the same woman. Thats why you need to follow the rules kid.”

He turned and looked at me again, and I could see it in his eyes now ... the fear he’d been trying not to show.

“She cries. Says her husband isn’t breathing. Begs for help.”

Carl crushed his cigarette under his boot.

“She doesn’t know she’s dead,” he said. “She still thinks someone can save her. Like the crash is still happening.”

I could barely get the question out. “Why didn’t you… someone… tell me?”

Carl laughed, but there was no humor in it.

“Because once you answer, it’s too late. That’s how she finds you. Not through the wreck. Through the phone. Through the ones who pick up.”

He stood slowly, brushing ash off his jeans.

“You think ignoring it will help. That you’ll forget her voice. That the sound of the line cutting out won’t crawl into your dreams. But it doesn’t work like that.”

He looked toward the dispatch office. The monitors were glowing behind the blinds, casting faint white light across the floor.

“She knows who hears her,” he said. “And she remembers every single one.”

I slowly took a step toward him.

“When did you hear her first?”

He didn’t answer.

I swallowed.

“When did you hear her *last*?”

A pause. Too long.

That’s when Tom walked in.

“Carl,” he said. “Your check.”

Carl stood slowly and took it with a nod.

Tom turned to me next. “You should probably be heading home,” he said. His eyes never quite met mine.

And just like that, the moment was gone.

Carl disappeared into the yard, envelope in hand. Tom walked back inside.

And I stood there, alone again. Wondering who would knock next. Or what would answer if I did.",0,1745330292.0,nosleep,1,0.5,False

1k56vzw,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPD/comments/1k56vzw/troubles_navigating_bpd_x_autism_relationship/,Troubles navigating BPD x Autism relationship,"I am 32F, was diagnosed with BPD at age 18. 

My partner, 57M, has ADHD and Autism, diagnosed in 30s/40s. 

*(we met when I was 30 at a community event, were friends for 1 year before he told me he had feelings for me, and started dating slowly due to age gap + diagnoses. We have been together for nearly 1.5 years)* 

I am unmedicated but have undergone intensive and years-long therapy for my BPD. It of course doesn't 'go away,' but it's been 7+ years since I've had a splitting episode, when I can tell I'm starting to have a FP I deal with it very quickly, and my panic attacks are down to once every few months and no longer last hours. I have noticed in the past couple years I've become more avoidant - when my insecurities, anger, abandonment, etc. is triggered I tend to shut down a bit and hide in my career (I'm self employed and work from home). I am actively working on this as it's unfair to others.

My partner is also unmedicated (used to be, didn't work for him) and is semi-managing. He regularly skips his therapy appointments so he has one every 4-6 weeks (they're free and he can go up to once per week), though he has done a significant amount of work prior to us meeting regarding his mental health and neurodivergence. 

The majority of the time, I feel like I've met my long-term partner. I feel seen in a way I haven't before, loved and accepted truly for who I am, and at ease with him. We moved in together in November, one month before our 1 year anniversary. This wasn't the plan (we were actually planning on moving in together around now), but the person he was renting from wanted to sell the house and other options were extremely limited.

And then, about once per month, it feels like we're at odds (and no it isn't during my period, so it's not like I'm just extra cranky). The last 4 days, he's been dealing with a lot of Autistic Overwhelm but whenever I offer to help (cook, clean, etc.) he says he doesn't need it (and if I step in, he feels it's me calling him incompetent so I don't do that anymore). And during his moments of Overwhelm, I feel myself getting very angry and annoyed and pulling back, which triggers his overwhelm and abandonment more, causing things to be harder for him, I get more annoyed, round and round we go... 

(when I get avoidant, I turn to work, scrolling, or napping - I don't scream, leave the home, etc. - I just don't want to engage) 

A few things to note:  
  
\-he hasn't worked since December. I asked him all Dec + Jan to cover his own costs (about $1k / month) and I'll cover mine + shared, and because of that he'll take on the bulk of house-related work. In early Mar I brought it back up as spring is my slow season, so that $1k from Mar - May would make a difference, he said he would - he has not and we're at the end of Apr. He continually says he doesn't know how to balance 1 week of work (in his field this is what it would take for him to make $1k) with the housework responsibilities, I say we'd split them more equitably while he's working, he says it's overwhelming and he can't figure out how to balance it all, round and round we go... 

\-doctors told him his Autism would become more severe as he ages, and instead of leaning into the supports + coping mechanisms he currently has (and finding more if needed), he's actively leaning out of them. He has admitted he gets a lot of his validation from our relationship, and it's part of why he barely speaks to friends anymore, doesn't go for his hikes and wellness retreats, etc. He's also said he feels guilty if he goes for coffee, to do art, etc. because he isn't contributing financially to the home and feels like he needs to be 'on call' 24/7 for home things (which I always reassure him he does not). He then feels frustrated because he doesn't have 'his own things' anymore. 

In times like this, I struggle to see us working out long-term. I am extremely driven, I love experiencing new things (restaurants, travel, etc.), money is important to me, and I retreat inwards and avoid / isolate when things get too difficult, and don't feel I get a lot of my internal validation from our relationship (or any!). He has ambition but can be distracted / overwhelmed easily, struggles with new things and prefers to stay home, doesn't care about money, and (has admitted) gets a lot of his validation from the relationship.

Sometimes I feel like I'm losing my autonomy to a relationship that demands intense proximity, reassurance, and a type of 'taking care of' that feels more like parenthood than partnership. Sometimes I feel like I deserve someone more 'on my level' - someone in their 30s, loves to travel + try new things, makes decent money, and is also independent. And them sometimes I feel like I can't trust my own opinions of things because of the BPD, because 90% of the time our relationship is great and I feel like I found my best friend who supports me so much and I just click with and why would I ever want to be without that.

And then round and round I go... 

So for those of you with Autistic partners, how did you find navigating the relationship? What difficulties did you have, and how did you resolve them? What remains unresolved and an ongoing struggle?",1,1745330059.0,BPD,0,1.0,False

wir haben jetzt seit 2,5 Jahren einen Hund (Großpudel). Ich komme mir bei vielen Themen immer noch wie ein Anfänger vor, merke aber auch immer wieder, wie wenig andere Hundebesitzer über Training wissen.

Wir waren zu Ostern bei der Familie von meinem Mann. Seine Cousine hat einen Chihuahua, der auch mit dabei war. Zwischendurch haben sie erzählt, dass sie mehrmals versucht haben dem Hund beizubringen so einen roten Buzzer zu drücken, aber er wäre zu blöd dafür, wäre ja schließlich ein Chihuahua.

Ich habe den Hund immer als recht pfiffig wahrgenommen, also ""Hold my coffee"" und als wir dann am Abend nach Hause gefahren sind, ist er mit dem Signal ""Buzzer"" einmal mit den Vorderpfoten auf den Buzzer gestiegen um ihn zu drücken.

Die Faszination war groß, ich war quasi ein Hundeflüsterer. Dabei habe ich dem Tierchen einfach nur beigebracht, auf einen roten Knopf zu steigen. Das war für sein Frauchen überhaupt nicht greifbar. Sie hat mir auch heute auf Whatsapp ein Video geschickt, wie gut er das immer noch kann.

Das war auch nicht das erste Mal, dass mir sowas passiert ist. Ich frage mich, wie diese Leute eigentlich mit ihren Hunden zusammenleben? Der Buzzer ist natürlich ein sehr spezielles Beispiel, aber Verhalten aufzubauen zieht sich ja durch sehr viele Themen.

1k56te8,https://www.reddit.com/r/twinpeaks/comments/1k56te8/twin_peaks_the_return_personal_summary/,Twin Peaks: The Return Personal Summary,">!I finished rewatching the whole of Twin Peaks for the third time about a month ago and I feel like this time I connected more dots than the first two times. I have watched Dune Prophecy and finished reading Dune: Messiah since but I can't help but find myself thinking about Twin Peaks all the time. I've been meaning to write this a few times but it has felt so overwhelming that I had been postponing it til now. I've been wondering how nobody from the Black Lodge suspected Mr C. to swap Coop with Dougie tulpa. First thing I thought of when I saw Douglas Jones was douglas firs. This made me wonder at how much of Cooper is inside Mr C. despite Mr C being the polar opposite of our beloved special agent Dale Cooper. Douge lives on Lancelot Court, Dougie and Jade had their ride on Sycamore Street, Dougie had the ring. Aren't these enough for Mike and the Arm or the Fireman to suspect or at least be aware of Mr C's shenanigans? Once DougieCoop comes back home at the red door there are owls. So only now they are inspecting DougCoop but had no idea of what Mr C's planned. Another question that popped up in my head this morning is Is Dougie tulpa the son of Bob? Mike says that Bob feeds on fear and the pleasures. They are his children. Dougie tulpa was prone to gambling and prostitutes. We see that the new Dougie was created by Mike with Cooper's hair. We never see who created the original Dougie tulpa and Diane tulpa. What if Mr C. is not capable of doing that and it was Bob who made them? Also Dougie tulpa likes coffee and Mr C. doesn't. We know this cos DougieCoop drinks his coffee from a mug with This is Dougie's coffee. We learn that there are no records of Dougie prior to 1997, so I also doubt whether Sonny Jim is Dougie tulpa's or Mr C's son. !<

>!We learn about the two birds with one stone plan by watching the talk between the Fireman and Coop in the lodge but Gordon Cole knew about this somehow without even having contact with Coop for 25 years which makes me wonder when did the talk between the Fireman and Coop took place? Even the Major was in on the plan so this must have taken place shortly before Cooper enters the black lodge. Also another thing I have always wondered is where have Cooper's body been for the past 25 years he was in the lodge? I always assumed that the lodge is a non-physical dimension so after 25 years I assumed that Cooper's body would not age. Considering Mr. C was out while Cooper was in, as Mr C's body aged so did Cooper's. This is how I tried to explain myself this. !<

>!We know that time is not linear inside the lodge and that Cooper appears there both in dream and after the physical entrance that leaves him inside for 25 years. I've read multiple theories about super imposed Cooper but the way I see it is what if superimposed Cooper is one that is in the lodge and he is watching an event in timespace 3D reality in a certain point in time and space. Few years ago I had an ineffable experience of seeing myself as an 8 years old in the school yard. I was aware of being in bed at the same time and seeing myself as a kid. Seeing superimposed Cooper reminded me of this experience and this is my way of understanding what's going on in that episode.!<



>!Anyone has an idea what this might mean from the missing pages of Laura's diary? There were 4 missing pages and 3 more were found, with 1 more left missing. Who's Nancy?!<

>!I'm not gonna talk about ~~Judy~~  the ending. In fact we're not gonna talk about the ending, we're gonna leave it out. Regardless of how you look at the ending, whether you think it was positive or negative, I don't understand the criticism of Coop. The 430 plan is the Fireman's, Laura is his creation. I feel like everything Cooper went thru was in the Fireman's grand scheme to save Laura. Coop entered Twin Peaks first and foremost as a policeman tasked with solving a murder. The Fireman used Cooper as a way of saving his creation, Laura. After passing 25 years in the lodge, losing the woman he loved, finding himself with a new family, the way Coop wept when seeing Sonny Jim in the car waiting, I don't think Coop had no better idea then to jump dimensions and risking forgetting everything again. He felt tasked and he thought it's the only way to defeat the evil and save Laura. !<

I have been working in software development and obsessing over coder performance for a few years now. I have come to understand that being successful in our industry boils down to doing 3 things consistently and efficiently:

1. Learning effectively and retaining information  
2. Being able to keep deep focus for extended periods of time  
3. Managing and increasing tolerance to stress

Learning well allows quick additions of tools, concepts, and best practices to our toolbelt, while extended periods of deep focus help us quickly apply these tools and build implementations for jaw-dropping features. Being more stress resilient protects us from potential burnout that comes with the heavy mental load of a great learning or long focus session.

As I got progressively better at these three, I have felt the quality, throughput, and impact of my work improve with them. And lately, I have gotten more and more interested in the biohacking space, in the lookout for a brain supplement to help me optimize for these 3 KPIs.

A lot of what I see out there is a bit general, like ""improves memory"" or ""helps with energy"". What is your experience in this space? Have you ever tried out a brain supplement to aid with programming performance? I know we all drink coffee, of course. What are your thoughts on these 3 performance indicators? Do you think they make sense, or am I waaay off?

Advice needed.,"I've been with my fiancée for 5.5 years and find myself at my second breaking point. Throughout our relationship, I've felt constant pressure to be more romantic and outgoing, while struggling with my mental health and focusing on keeping us financially stable.

# First Breaking Point

Around the 4.5-year mark, I was completely burned out. Running my own business while managing mental and physical health issues had left me anxious, irritated, and low on energy, also I've gained a lot of weight and picked up some bad habits. Meanwhile, my girlfriend was feeling pressure mainly from people on her socials getting married, having babies and so on.

She began pushing me toward marriage, and I felt pressured into proposing during our vacation. After that came her friend's wedding, which I attended reluctantly. The bachelor party became my breaking point – I didn't know anyone, was bullied and made fun of for being weird, and the experience left me traumatized. I had a complete mental breakdown.

After returning home, I confided in her about experiencing a complete mental breakdown. I explained that I needed to heal and was considering checking into some kind of facility or spa for a week or two. Rather than showing concern, she became angry with me—not because I was struggling, but because I hadn't offered to bring her along.

That moment became the turning point. I realized it was time to end our relationship.

What followed were multiple exhausting conversations where I felt entirely misunderstood. Eventually, I made the difficult decision to move out while she was at work. I sold our apartment and despite having always been the one financially supporting us, provided her with enough money to secure her own mortgage. At that point, I simply needed space to rebuild myself, I just wanted everything to be over as soon as possible.

# The 6 Month Break

During our separation, I quit my job, focused on healing, and returned to hobbies I'd abandoned. Honestly was depressed and in a bad place, was even contemplating suicide. We both tried to date other people unsuccessfully. Eventually she started calling constantly until I gave in. About a year ago, we reconciled and moved in together again – she rented out her apartment and joined me in my new place.

# Where We Are Now

* My situation: I've been focusing on personal growth—getting out of my shell, returning to work, and starting to lose weight (the main reason for my low energy). I've also been prescribed new medication, quit alcohol, and eliminated other bad habits.
* Her situation: She's financially stable, living rent-free with me while earning income from her work and from renting her apartment. I bought her a new car last month, however seems that it made her happy and grateful for like 2 weeks. She's trying to quit bad habits and loose weight together with me, however it seems that it's taking a toll on her an she's taking it out on me.

Despite all things going well, apparently emotionally we're dealing with the exact same problems as before.

The core issue remains her need for constant affection. If there's even a short period without romantic attention – like going a week without sex – she starts nagging and we end up fighting. Nothing I do seems enough, even though I show love in my own ways: hugs, kisses, deep talks, bringing her coffee, helping with errands, maintaining her car, and paying for appointments. I even arranged for us to take three months off work so we could take a road trip together and work on improving ourselves. Everything seemed to be fine during the roadtrip but once we came back home, I didn't see any motivation from her to work on herself or improve herself. None of that seems to matter when she feels she hasn't received enough attention for a week or two. Everything seems to go through the window.

# Our Latest Fight

Yesterday exemplified our problem perfectly. After an exhausting weekend spent between visiting her and my parents, I needed just one day to recover, catch up on work, and prepare for the week ahead. I told her that like two times. Yet still, on my only day off, she pressured me to go out biking. I declined, and she went alone.

While she was out, a friend made a surprise visit, we talked for some time and he left. After my fiancee returned, I told her that my friend visited me, which made her visibly irritated so she poured herself a drink. We watched TV together, then went to lie down around 6pm. I was exhausted and saw my friend messaged me, so I started texting with him.

She became furious, threw a tantrum about ""all the attention"" I give to my friend. She said that I'm talking too much about him, and she deeply hates him. Then she stormed out to the living room where she eventually began frantically cleaning at 9pm. Feeling angry and overwhelmed, I left my own home for an hour just to get away so I could collect my thoughts and understand wtf just happened.

When I returned, I tried once again to explain my situation – that I was drained from the weekend, affected by my ADD medication which makes me less emotional, dealing with health issues, and simply not able to be the romantic, energetic partner she wants right now. I need to take care of myself before I can share energy and joy with her. But she didn't seem to understand, and instead criticized me for not buying flowers for our ""6th anniversary"" (which I don't even count as a full six years since we were apart for six months). In the end we just went to sleep.

Today instead of starting my week I can't even focus or work for that matter, I feel completely messed up. Only thing that I do know is that these kind of tantrums can't and shouldn't be happening anymore, especially if we are planning any kind of future.

# My Current Dilemma

I'm starting to understand that my girlfriend might be struggling with depression and low self-worth herself – her mother is extremely depressed, manipulative and insufferable, and sadly I see similar patterns in her behavior. She doesn't have real close friends, nor hobbies. Instead, she seems to prefer chasing endless adventures or social media as an escape, while criticizing me during the times when she's not getting enough validation from me. Though she's aware of this, I'm losing hope that she'll ever work on herself.

As painful as it is to admit, I'm seriously questioning whether she's emotionally stable enough for us to have a future together, even though we've been planning to get married in the next 6-10 months.

Fact is, I'm not going to build any feature with a person who keeps getting silently resentful and throws childish tantrums in order to victimize herself and frankly has needs that I'm not able to always meet. I don't even understand why she reached out to me during the break, if it was that bad in the first place. I mean she knew exactly what she was signing for. It's not like I'm not improving and not working on myself. I am, it's just that everything takes time.

Currently I'm thinking of moving out for a week or two and suggesting couple's therapy, but at this point I don't even know where to start or if it's even worth spending my time/energy or even savings for that matter at this point anymore. 

Main question is this: What advice would you give someone in my situation - should I try one last time with therapy or accept that we may be fundamentally incompatible despite our history together?

This isn't exactly a problem specific to med spouses but something I could still use some advice on and the last time I posted something on here I got some really lovely insights so I thought I'd give it another try.  
My partner (M27) and I (F28) have been together for a little over 1,5 years now. He’s the best person I know and I love him deeply. He's in his second year of residency and even though his first year in neurology was complete and utter hell, somehow we managed and made our relationship thrive, which I am so incredibly grateful for.  
  
He has only been in one serious relationship prior to meeting me. He was with his ex (let's call her Eve) for about ten years. They grew up together and lived together but rather quickly realised that they were nothing more than friends and eventually broke up in 2022. Because he was still in med school back then and she was getting her master's degree in biology, they chose to continue living together until they both finished school (which was in July 2023, we got together in December 2023).   
They still check in on each other occasionally and meet up for coffee every few months. When we first started dating it was rough for me, but we’ve talked a lot about this and still do and I’ve met Eve a few times. Now that I feel more secure in our relationship, I really am fine with them still being friends. Whenever they do talk or meet up, he tells me about it in advance and keeps me updated on their contact as well as what's going on in her life, so I feel fairly involved. She has been with her new partner for quite a while now as well and it's all going smoothly.  
However, I don’t want to be friends with Eve. We’re very different people and like I said, we’ve met before and obviously are polite with one another but we just don’t click. I don’t mind this at all, but I’ve told my partner that I’m not interested in getting to know Eve any further. I'll exchange pleasantries with her, of course, but I don't see us getting close and quite frankly don't intend to try and change this. He’s very understanding with all of this, he knows how difficult this was for me in the beginning and he doesn’t pressure me into anything at all, but I can tell he’d love for me to be more involved with Eve as she’s the only childhood friend he still has. I’m conflicted about this because I want to be able to do this for my partner, but at the same time I feel like people just have different comfort levels with these things and I shouldn’t force myself to be close with someone I obviously don’t really vibe with.

(this is my first post bear with haha)

Hi me (21m) and my fiance (20m) have been dealing with his mother (56f) who is the entitled parent of this story.


Some background information to help explain, my  fiance who I will refer to as T lost his father young to a brain tumour, he was 10 when he passed away so for the past 10 years it's been him and his mum, his mum has controlled alot of aspects of his life down to keeping his meds and not letting him explore options for medication while T has fibromyalgia and suffers from anxiety to he point of throwing up when he tries to travel T had a really traumatic experience with this death  so his anxiety is based around medical situations and death it's self. Despite knowing this his mother has constantly shown 'tough love' which to her means little to no empathy and constantly pushing T to do things he's unable to. When living at home he would
-cook for her
-clean for her 
-make her bed
-walk the dogs 
-feed the dogs 
-make her coffee whenever she asked 
-look after his gran 
-laundry 
-mow the lawn 
-basicaly anything she can't be bothered to do 
The list goes on and on as said previously he has fibromyalgia which means he is in pain most of the time and things like making the bed would leave him having to lay down for hours. Through out his life his mom has talked him out and into so many situations against his own better judgement beginning with what GCSEs he took to his image and self expression. 

His mother has been a center point of his anxiety too mainly because of the way she is with him, insisting he's the only one who can help her with his Gran and more guilt tripping tactics. T has stated he can't go through the process of a terminal ilnesss taking over another person he loves, his mum seems to think she has him and only him.

Basically everything with her is an issue if not to her liking, when we began dating T opened up to me about her and from the beginning I have advocated him to leave home as the detrement it has on his  physical health and mental health. T had 0 space to talk about this behaviour from his mom so when he began living with me in Feb 2025 he has been able to open up to a therapist. Anyway that's the backstory. 


Last December of 2024 his gran had a fall and he assisted her along with his mum and told her on this day he can't handle the deterioration of his grans health. Due to this me and him (while I was recovering from lung surgery) emptied the front room for his gran to live with him and his mother. Ts gran moved in. During moving things Ts mum was ordering us about and trying to micromanage every step and that's when I fully understand exactly what he has managed with his whole life. Anyway after this the thank you was practically non existent. I only helped as I didn't want T to go through this alone. 

On new year's eve Ts mum broke her foot which ment T and I had to stay with her for awhile in this time I witnessed the audacity of this b*tch. I smoke w**d and Ts mom suggested an entirely new wardrobe of clothes for when I am at her house cause the smell made her feel sick. I rely on benefits entirely as I am disabled and have C-ptsd induced phycosis. So I can't afford this. I didn't smoke in her house or around her it was just my clothes smelling a bit grassy. It was endless comments and chores. At the end we would be excited to come back to mine. Just to rest. 

This was the situation for months and we were getting so fed up and burnt out. In Feb 2025 we left Ts mum's for our usual 4 days off (sarcasm but it felt this way) however from this point we have not been back. This is because Ts anxiety had a major relapse and left him sobbing in my arms and throwing up at the thought of leaving the house. Due to this the car has become a major difficulty and a source of chronic panic. His mum has not understood this and therefore has damaged the little relationship they had. 

We have been looking to move out of my current flat due to beeping unhappy where we are but Ts mum wants us to live within walking distance of her however me and T have plans to move to York and no where else. 

Anyway now 22/5/25  his mother rings him asking about how the move is going (ATM it's looking for anything we can afford with the help of my social worker) and she has been constantly recommending closer to hers and today she a asked us to move closer so we can give her a break from looking after Ts gran, suggesting we move closer and clame carers allowance when nither me or him are able or willing to do this, it's a responsibility neither of us can hold. Our life is hard enough as is and looking after the elderly is not something we're able to do. It's not about abandoning family it's about the trauma and disabilities and the simple fact of we don't want to live there. 

In this call I lost my patience and said ""we can't pause our life and just move where you want, T has trauma already"" I bearly finished this sentence before she interrupted insisting I took it wrong. T was anxious as f**k and I was raging sick of this woman and sick of her thinking her son is just there to support her. She is his mother and yet the roles are reversed! 

After the phone call T received a message asking to speak with out me present, this was to say again I misunderstood. I didn't misunderstood I stood up for T and she didn't like that. 

We have had enough of her behaviour and manipulation, any advice?

From the day he was diagnosed — swollen abdomen, no energy, barely eating — to now:  
🐾 No more fluid  
🐾 Active, playful, eating well  
🐾 Gained weight steadily (3.1 kg now)  
🐾 Most blood values are improving

The end of treatment is near — **only 15 days to go** — but I’ve run into a wall financially.  
Each vial costs **$75 USD** in Argentina, and because of Bruno’s weight, I now need one every 6 doses. I also need to cover his final **bloodwork and ultrasound** by the end of April.

I’m doing this alone. I care for my mother full-time (she’s in a wheelchair and fractured her wrist a few weeks ago). I’ve sold things, reached out everywhere, and relied on kindness from strangers who helped me make it this far.

If you’ve ever helped, shared, or even just sent a kind word — thank you.  
And if anyone can help us finish this, even with the cost of a coffee, you’d be helping save a life that’s fought so hard to live.

Bruno doesn’t know how close he is to the finish line — but I do.

It's also a very large multinational company.

Anyways, shortly after I applied I reached out to the hiring manager, a director, and manages to secure a coffee chat to discuss the role which I am hoping goes well as this role would be perfect for me at the time and I match it about 70%. The part I'm worried about is during that time and before our coffee session next week I received a rejection email from the role (probably from recruiting or ATS system maybe). As a result do I mention it or do you think they may catch up to it and just tell me in person the role is not for me? How should I navigate this to secure the role.

Ok Saxbys is cool and all but it rlly depends. I keep having this one particular person end up making my drink and it’s never right. First time is was the wrong size and when I mentioned it they looked irritated w me (I even apologized for it.) This time my drink was extremely sugary (could barely taste the coffee) so I asked if I could get it less sweet and they just looked at me like I was being difficult but remade it (they didn’t even want to acknowledge me at first when I was there). They gave it to me and didn’t taste a single part of the flavor that came with it. I just wanted the regular amount it was supposed to have and I had never tasted that overly sweet before.

I’ve been a lead barista, and I think one of the things that can make you not a good one is not accepting that you can make mistakes. Mistakes are what can help make your craft better in the long run. Every time I order a drink is a different look or consistency from there whenever I order during non busy times 😭. I don’t complain then, I’m understanding of it as things can get hefty sometimes. Some people have the skill and some people may not.",1,1745329153.0,GaState,5,0.67,False

Sitting back in my seat, I remind myself that four more hours and the annual Alpha meeting would finally be over, and I can go home. Well, as long as Dad doesn't force me to go to the ball and babysit Lydia. Dad loves to drag me to these silly meetings, even though I find them boring. Mostly, they just argue or boast about their latest business affairs.The meeting is held in the main part of Nightshade City, which is neutral territory. All the packs are on the outskirts, surrounding the city. So, it makes sense for the city to be a neutral ground because otherwise, movement within the city limits would be restricted. All five packs rely on it not only for business to thrive, but also to keep supplies coming in.I've spent all my school holidays in these sorts of meetings. Despite literally nothing important happening in them, my father has still insisted I attend even though my stepmother volunteered to go in my place. Dad, however, wasn't having it, lecturing that I needed to learn the ropes of running a pack and how these meetings are a big part of it.I guess I am an accessory, and I'm one step away from becoming his fanny pack at this point. I'm already his notetaker, calculator, mediator, and coffee maker. He might as well just hand the pack over already.A few of the other Alphas have brought their sons and daughters. It is strategic on their parents' part, a way to strengthen alliances through marriages.However, I had no such interest, and it is clear I wasn't the only one who wasn't interested in parental antics. The only person I will marry one day is my mate, if I find him or her, that is.I often wonder what my mate will be like... who my wolf will choose... if I find my mate before Deacon marks me, that is. One part of me is conflicted if I should wait a year to see if I find my mate. Deacon wants to mark me once I get my wolf, we've been together two years but occasionally, I am not so sure. Finding my mate, that person who was made for me, sounds so exciting and enticing.I am brought out of my thoughts by Dad's irritated voice.""This is ridiculous. Where is he?"" he growls, smacking the table with his fist. Alpha Zayn is notoriously late, and as Dad had explained earlier, he doesn't seem to care much for these meetings. Well, that is one thing we have in common, I guess. But that explains why I've never met the man, since he's apparently too busy to attend.Maybe now's my chance to slip out to the bathroom and not come back. Dad seems preoccupied enough with Alpha Zayn's tardiness. I peer around the room, only to find the young man across from me staring. He smirks, and I bite back the urge to ask him to stop staring when he leans over the table.""Have you heard the good news?"" Boyd asks. My brows furrow when his father elbows him harshly, giving him a look that seems to tell him to shut his mouth. Boyd leans back in his seat and folds his arms across his chest, looking rather smug like he knows something important I don't. Confusion washes over me, we don't have much to do with their pack. My father never really liked Alpha Dane, who is Boyd's father. I glance at my father, who is suddenly stiff as a board beside me.""Dad?"" I elbow him.""Well, discuss it later,"" he whispers back before diverting his attention back to the conference room door. ""For frig sake, where is he?"" my father snaps angrily, glancing at his watch.""Hush, Joseph, I would prefer no bloodshed at this meeting,"" Alpha Samuel states, glancing at the other Alphas nervously.Rumors have spread that Alpha Zayn's father met an untimely death, and the circumstances surrounding it remain quite murky. Yet, Alpha Zayn looks guilty as sin. His father goes missing, and he is suddenly ruling over the largest pack in the country. Yeah, that doesn't sound shady at all.Dad groans at his words, drumming his fingers on the oval table. We are one of the smaller packs surrounding the city, and we rely heavily on alliances, especially when it comes to rogues and hunters. Without alliances, we would never have won the last rogue attack. It was sheer luck that Alpha Samuel's pack was visiting at the time because otherwise, we would have been completely destroyed.That's the subject of today's pack meeting. Rogue numbers have grown out of control, and packs are constantly under threat or being attacked. Even the city has been targeted a few times.If something does go down at this meeting after my dad warned against it, I'm blaming the alphas who refused to listen.The double doors swing open as if summoned, and Alpha Zayn stalks in. The room stills, all eyes turning to him. He exudes power and confidence with every step, those piercing gray eyes taking in everything and the energy in the room, waltzing in like he owns the place. My breath catches as I drink him in. Messy dark hair, stubble accentuating a sharp jawline, and tattoos peeking out from his open collar. He looks like sin personified. Maybe this meeting won't be boring after all.Chapter 2""Is there an issue, Joseph?"" Alpha Zayn demands. Only then do I glance at my father, who is shooting a look of daggers in his direction. I kick him under the table, and my father sits back in his chair, folding his arms across his chest while shooting me a glare.""Behave!"" I mouth to my father. Gee, now I need to tell him how to act!""Not at all, Alpha Zayn,"" Dad denies quickly.Looking back at the Alpha, I quickly avert my gaze when I realize that me kicking my father under the table didn't go unnoticed. Yet when I dare to look up, Alpha Zayn is still staring at me as if I am some puzzle he is trying to solve. He shakes his head and moves toward his seat. My eyes follow him to take his seat. When he does, his gaze finds mine for a heated moment before he turns his attention away, clenching his jaw. I feel my cheeks flush and quickly turn my attention to the huge board Alpha Samuel spent a good ten minutes writing on earlier.I swallow, not liking the way he is staring so intensely, and I can once again feel his gaze on me. A shiver runs up my spine. Thankfully, Alpha Samuel clears his throat, drawing his attention away, and I let out the breath I didn't know I was holding.My eyes wander around the room, taking in the tense expressions of the Alphas as they discuss alliance strategies and resource management. All this talk about pack politics and territory borders is exhausting. I can't wait to escape back to my life outside these walls.""Alpha Joseph, your input on the new trade agreement would be appreciated,"" Alpha Samuel says, his voice cutting through my thoughts. Was I close to dozing off again? My dad straightens up in his chair, preparing to speak, but I can't bring myself to care about whatever he's going to say. Instead, I find my gaze drifting towards Alpha Zayn, who sits across the table, every bit as disinterested as I am.""Very well,"" my father begins, launching into a lengthy explanation about supply chains and tariffs. I try to focus on his words, but it's hard not to get lost in my own fantasies, especially when they involve the enticingly dangerous Alpha Zayn. His dark hair and the Alpha's steely gray eyes make it difficult to concentrate on anything else when my phone vibrates on the table. I snatch my phone off to glance at the message lighting up my screen.Leaning down, I look at it under the table to see it's from Deacon, making me grin mischievously.'Meet me outside in ten minutes'I quickly type a reply. 'You decided to go?' I reply back to my boyfriend. His reply is just as quick.'Jailbreak, meet me downstairs.' I can't help the goofy smile that splits onto my face.I quickly reply, telling him I will find an excuse when my phone is suddenly snatched from my hand. I grit my teeth, expecting it to be my father, but I am shocked to find it is Alpha Zayn. He raises an eyebrow at me.""Is there something you'd like to share with the rest of us?"" Alpha Zayn asks suddenly, his gaze piercing through me. My cheeks flush with embarrassment, but I can't deny how my heart races at his attention. I shake my head, staring at the man wide-eyed.""Um, no,"" I stammer, trying to regain my composure. ""Sorry for the interruption.""""I'll hang onto this until after the meeting,"" he tells me, and his eyes flicker to his wolf as he peers down at my phone, reading my text messages. I reach for my phone, but he pulls it away, and I glare at him.""You can't take my daughter's phone,"" my father quickly growls. Alpha Zayn merely glances at him before pocketing it.""I already did,"" he states, giving me a pointed look. I turn back in my chair, and my father looks like he is about to leap out of his chair, when Samuel speaks up.""Joseph!"" Samuel shakes his head, warning my father to back off, and reluctantly, he does while Alpha Zayn retakes his seat across from me.The meeting drags on, a mind-numbing cycle of posturing and politics. A few future Alphas sneak out, using the bathroom as their excuse, and no one bats an eye. The temptation is too much. Leaning closer to my father, I murmur, ""Bathroom.""He nods without looking, and I’m out of my seat in seconds. The hallway feels like a breath of freedom—until I remember Zayn still has my phone. Fantastic. I’ll have to find Deacon and sort it out later.Heading for the stairs, I nearly collide with a tall figure. Boyd—one of the Alphas' sons, and the guy who’s been practically burning holes in me with his stare all night. His smirk says he’s been waiting for this.""Cleo!"" he calls out, and I stop, fisting my hands and turning back to face him.""You escaped?"" he laughs.""Trying to, but you're intent on getting me caught if we are going to be lingering outside the door,"" I tell him. He glances back at the conference room door.""I'm not taking over. My brother is. No purpose for me in those meetings,"" he says, draping his arm across my shoulders. ""I heard your father is handing down the pack to you. I'm surprised it's not going to Lydia, since Samuel's pack is bigger. It would make sense if they joined packs,"" he tells me.However, this time, I try to step away. I may not like having to attend these meetings, but there is no way I would let that woman take over my mother's pack. I couldn't dishonor her like that.""Oh, sorry, I didn't mean to offend you. Come on, let's get a drink. My father wants to discuss alliances with your father anyway. It seems we'll be getting to know each other better soon anyway,"" he says, and I stop in my tracks at his words.""Excuse me?""""Your father hasn’t told you?"" Boyd’s voice is low, laced with intrigue.I take a step back, my heart picking up pace. Lydia’s earlier taunt echoes in my mind—could this be what she meant?Before I can press him, Boyd’s gaze sharpens, his posture stiffening. I bump into someone behind me. Warm fingers grip my hip, the touch electric, igniting a shiver that races up my spine.Turning, I meet the intense gaze of Alpha Zayn, his dark eyes locking onto mine.I try to step away, but Zayn’s grip tightens, pulling me closer until every inch of his body aligns with mine. His fingers brush under the hem of my blouse, igniting a trail of heat on my skin.""Shouldn’t you be in the Alpha meeting?"" Zayn’s voice cuts through the tension, calm yet razor-sharp. Boyd freezes, his confidence draining as he meets Zayn’s piercing gaze.""My father… he said I could leave,"" Boyd stutters, sounding anything but convincing.I stay still, caught between wanting to thank Zayn for intervening and cursing him for ruining my escape. But then his hand moves again, firmer, sending a shiver down my spine.""Good,"" Zayn growls, his tone dripping with authority. ""Then leave.""Boyd’s eyes flick to Zayn’s hand on my hip, his expression darkening. He steps closer, his hand reaching toward me in a weak attempt to assert control.""Cleo, let’s go,"" Boyd says.My heart pounds as I glance between them. Boyd’s outstretched hand feels hollow. Zayn’s presence, on the other hand, feels like a storm, dangerous and impossible to ignore.Zayn leans down, his breath warm against my ear. ""Do you really want to go with him?""Chapter 3I shake my head slightly, unable to form words, and that’s all the permission Zayn needs. His grip tightens possessively.Boyd falters, his confidence crumbling under Zayn’s gaze. He steps back, muttering something under his breath before turning and retreating down the hall.As the sound of Boyd’s footsteps fades, Zayn's hand doesn’t move, his body still pressed against mine as if daring me to protest. My pulse races, and for a fleeting moment, I wonder if I’ve stepped out of the meeting and into something far more dangerous.""Cleo is using the bathroom. She is required to attend since she'll be Alpha. Isn't that right, Cleo?"" his fingers dig into my hip harder. No Alpha has ever... disciplined me like this. I glance up at him and swallow when I find his eyes glaring daggers at Boyd.""I guess I'll see you later, Cleo, if you come down to the ball,"" Boyd quickly states before rushing off down the stairs.I gulp, peering up at Alpha Zayn, who leans down and points behind me. .""Bathrooms are right there,"" he tells me, and I glance back toward the conference room door, which the bathroom for both genders' door is next to the conference room.I give him a nervous look.""You weren't sneaking off now, were you?"" he asks.""Just using the bathroom, but then I ran into Boyd,"" I say, awkwardly turning for the bathroom when I stop. ""May I get my phone back, please?"" I ask him. He raises an eyebrow at me.""Why, so you can message Boyd?"" he asks, and my face falls.""What, no? It's my phone."" Why is he so concerned with who I'm messaging?""Until the end of the meeting, it is mine. Now, hurry, your father was worried about you,"" he snaps.""So, what? You’re running errands for my father now?"" I sneer, crossing my arms and rolling my eyes. Who does this guy think he is? My babysitter?If Alpha Zayn expects me to fall in line just because he's an Alpha, he’s got another thing coming. I’m an Alpha too, and I don’t bow to anyone.His expression darkens, his voice dropping to a lethal growl. ""I’m waiting for my Beta. But go ahead, take your time in the bathroom. Or should I let Alpha Dane know how thrilled you are to become Boyd’s Luna and join the Claymore pack?""The blood drains from my face. ""I am not taking him as my mate!"" I snap.Zayn’s lips curl into a wicked smile, his eyes glinting with satisfaction. He’s enjoying this way too much.""Then you better get back to the meeting to say that, I heard Alpha Dane ask to speak with your father after the meeting about an alliance proposal.""""What did my father say?"" I ask him, slightly worriedly. This is common within packs, my father married my mother as part of a pack alliance, he then took over her pack only to find his true mate in my stepmother. It made things complicated, but at first, my mother had accepted it, though Linda wasn't as accepting as my mother. This is one thing that constantly worries me, even if we take a chosen mate, we will still recognize our true destined mate.""I didn't hear. My Beta mindlinked me,"" he says as he steps closer and leans down.""But he can't marry you off without your consent. So make sure you don't give it,"" he tells me.""You know it's not that easy,"" I tell him, noticing how good he smells as he leans in closer, making me want to lean closer so i can soak up his scent. I almost follow that instinct when I snap out of the weird hair I'm under before embarrassing myself.""Isn't it?"" he says, and my brows furrow.""It could cause pack wars,"" I remind him.""You'll have strong alliances,"" he tells me.""I highly doubt Alpha Samuel will go up against Alpha Dane, given they're best friends, and he is the only alpha my father currently has an alliance with."" My eyes suddenly burn at the thought as tears spring to my eyes.""The only thing that would stop that going ahead,"" he begins to say, then smirks, and I want to slap him for hurting me possibly being married off.""A mate, I know!"" I snap at him, and his brows pinch. It's alright for him; he isn't being forced to marry someone he doesn't like. I gulp, a horrible lump in my throat. How will I explain this to Deacon? We have plans. Plans that don't involve political alliances.""Are you seriously not going to..."" his words cut off when someone in the distance calls his name.""Alpha?"" mutters a voice. Peering around him, I see his Beta standing on the stairs.Using his momentary distraction, I turn to the bathroom, push the door open, and quickly move inside. I wash my hands, not actually needing to use the bathroom, just trying to buy time. Now the urge to escape extends beyond avoiding an annoying meeting. I need to speak to Boyd and try to get him to talk his father out of that idea. Deacon will be my mate if my wolf doesn't find her own. He's insisted. We've already discussed it. Walking back out, Alpha Zayn is still talking to his Beta, and I internally groan. So much for escaping.""I should go back into the meeting,"" he tells the man he is speaking with, and I know I won't be sneaking off anywhere with the Alpha around to alert my father. He turns and moves toward me. I quickly rush back into the meeting and retake my seat.Alpha Zayn follows me a second later. My father once again looks furious about having to wait for Alpha Zayn.""Sorry, my Beta needed to speak with me,"" Alpha Zayn states, and the other Alphas don't seem to mind. However, my father does.""That's what the mindlink is for,"" my father snarls.""Really? I wouldn't have known, Joseph. Last I checked, the mindlink provides me with access to his thoughts, not his eyes. He had something to show me. Now, can we continue?""My father's lip tugs in the corners, and I know he is biting back what he wants to say.I lean back in my seat, sulking that I can't escape to see Deacon. Yet, one part of me is grateful to Boyd for the heads up about my dad's master plan. If he thinks I'm marrying Boyd, he is severely mistaken.The meeting drags on, tensions rising as Alpha Zayn continues to shut down my father's every argument. I can see Dad's temper boiling, his hands clenching into fists on the table. They spoke about the threat of the rogues and new treaty deals. But the longer the meeting goes on, the angrier my father becomes, each of his points shot down without mercy.None of the other Alphas dare to interfere, and I wonder what my father did to infuriate this Zayn so badly.Surely it can’t just be that look he shot him when he entered. Eventually, my father finally snaps. His outburst rips through the room like thunder, making me jump in my seat.Chapter 4""Screw this. If you are just going to hand him control of the city, then I am done here,"" my father snarls abruptly, making me jump.""Sit down, Joseph, my men on your borders are the only thing keeping the rogues off your land. So sit down and shut up!"" Alpha Zayn growls, and his fist comes down on the table with a loud thud: the wood creaks and groans, a crack slivering right up the middle of it makes my eyes widen.My father laughs and shakes his head. ""I have no alliance with your pack!""""Regardless, if you bothered to go out to your borders for once, you would see my patrols. Every pack here is under my pack's protection, and I will revoke it if you don't sit down!""""Samuel's men help patrol my pack borders, not yours,"" my father snaps, gripping my arm and yanking me to my feet.I curse, hitting my knee on the table. Great, why am I involved? Flinching, I'm nearly tossed to the ground, at the force of which my father grabs me and pulls me up beside him. My chair tips over, and I stumble over the top of it. A menacing snarl leaves Alpha Zayn's lips.""Samuel, would you enlighten this old fool,"" Alpha Zayn growls murderously, and my father stops, his grip on my arm becoming crushing.Now I wish I paid attention. My father never puts his hands on me, but something has really got under his skin for him to grab me like this.Alpha Samuel shrinks in his seat as my father's gaze turns to him.""What he says is true. I haven't had the numbers after the last attack, so I asked Alpha Zayn to patrol the pack's borders,"" he explains, looking somewhat embarrassed.Alpha Samuel's pack is the second largest and usually runs the city's protection and the border patrols. That is what my father pays him for: his protection.""Excuse me? I pay you every month,"" my father spits at him, but it is Alpha Zayn that answers.""Now, you pay me. So sit down and unhand your-"" he pauses, looking me over, having lost his train of thought.""My daughter, Cleo,"" my father answers. The Alpha nods once, his eyes on my father's hand that is still locked onto me in a death grip. What is going on here?""I know who she is.""My father growls, and I cry out as his grip crushes my arm. The other Alphas stare in shock. Alpha Zayn's eyes blaze, a snarl on his lips.""Dad,"" I plead. ""Let go! What's going on? What are they talking about?"" I say, feeling like there's something big I'm missing out on.""Let her go,"" he commands, voice holding a deadly lilt. ""You're hurting her.""My father blinks, glancing down at the bruises and scratches already forming on my skin where his claws had slipped out and scratched me. Horror floods his face, and his hand falls away.My cheeks burn a brilliant shade of scarlet. I am frightened and embarrassed as my father released his vice-like grip on my arm, the intensity of it leaving behind the clear outlines of his fingers.""Cleo? Crap, I'm sorry, sweetie,"" he apologizes, the tone of his voice changing abruptly from venomous to remorseful. I can't help but feel like some sort of prize or trophy, one that he nearly damaged with his careless actions and temper.""I'm fine. Just leave me,"" I whisper, trying to hide my humiliation from him and the others in the room.Swatting his hand away, I sheepishly try to hide the bruises on my arms. The weight of their gazes bear down on me, making me acutely aware of how much attention has been placed on me at that moment, but I refuse to look at any of them. Instead, I focus on keeping my thoughts and emotions in check, remembering the countless lessons I have taken about controlling my reactions.""Now sit down. We must finish; I haven't got time for another meeting later,"" Alpha Zayn snaps, my father's head whips in his direction, and he growls, not liking being spoken down to by someone younger than him.""You are all fools, giving this lunatic control of the city and our packs,"" my father snarls at Alpha Samuel, then turns to glare at Alpha Zayn. ""Shove your protection up your behind. I will not bow to the likes of you!"" he growls, glaring at the young Alpha before tugging me from the room.""Dad!"" I hiss, still majorly confused about what's going on. He growls daringly at me, but even I know the importance of having those patrols.""We need his help,"" I grit out, but he isn't hearing it. Instead, he rips me away from the meeting room and toward the stairs leading to the restaurant.""Dad!"" I snap when we reach the bottom and are out of earshot.""No, Cleo, I am not leaving my pack in the hands of that monster,"" he growls, stopping so abruptly that I slam right into his back. He grips my shoulders and looks at me with a sigh, and drops his head.""Look, one day you will understand, but for-"" Sirens suddenly go off, ringing from everywhere. My dad straightens up, his eyes darting around as the sirens grow louder, signaling the city is under attack. My eyes widen, and I glance around as people panic and screams ring out from outside. My father shoves me behind him.""Cleo, go, find somewhere to hide!"" my father screams before shifting into his huge gray wolf. My heart beats like a drum in my chest, panic, and fear filling me, and I take off only to be knocked down by the stampede of panicked humans. I crawl to a nearby table, ducking under the tablecloth, when the windows all around suddenly shatter. Gunshots ring out deafeningly, and the roars and growls only get closer and louder.""Cleo, run!"" my father screams through the mindlink when a giant malt-colored wolf upturns the table. I scream, scrambling back on my hands and knees, only for my father's wolf to attack the wolf. Turning, I try to get to my feet when teeth rip into my arm, sending jarring pain through me.Chapter 5My scream echoes through my skull as the beast shakes its head violently, flinging me toward the kitchens. My body flies through the air, and I crash heavily on the floor. Groaning, I scramble to get to my feet, slipping on the tiled floor that is drenched in blood. Bodies are strewn across the restaurant floor, and I run for the kitchen doors just as I am tackled to the ground-another wolf is upon me.The wolf's teeth tear into my thigh, and this time, when I hear my father's panicked voice ring out, I know he has shifted back to find me.""Dad!"" I scream for him before hearing his strained voice.""Samuel, get to Cleo!"" I hear his gurgled cry from another room before I hear the snapping of bones again. I kick out, trying to get the wolf mauling me off while keeping my arms over my head, knowing if he gets to my neck, I am gone. Claws rake down my sides, and I scream in agony as the wolf drags me closer.I thrash, screaming and kicking when his weight is suddenly gone from on top of me. I gasp in relief only to see a massive black wolf standing over the rogue that attacked me. The rogue now lies dead at his feet. I crawl back on my hands and feet, my leg throbbing as my blood spills onto the floor, mingling with the rest of the bright red stains. I shriek when I notice another rogue lunge at my face, only to stop midair when the black wolf mauls it. I try to escape, but I am caught beneath the black wolf.He takes down the rogue, and I clutch his fur, wondering which Alpha it is because I haven't seen this wolf before. He doesn't snarl as I use his body to pull myself out from under him so that I can stand, but the wolf sniffs my leg and whimpers when I notice more rogues spilling in through open windows. The wolf snarls, spinning on his feet before snapping his teeth at me, his way of telling me to run without the mindlink.I don't need to be told twice. I clamber to my feet, ignoring the pain and running toward the kitchen to find somewhere to hide and catch glimpses of rogues everywhere. They are going to kill everyone, I think, panicked. There are too many. Sliding along the floor, my leg throbs to its own beat, and my arm is gushing blood when four rogues come into the kitchen from the other end. I come to a jarring halt before spinning, only to find my exit is now blocked, and I am surrounded.""Cleo, where are you?"" my father calls through the mindlink.""Dad, I'm..."" a snarl pulls me from the mindlink.""Hold on, Bub, I'm trying to get to you!"" he calls back, but my eyes track the movement of the wolves surrounding me.Looking around, I grab a knife off the counter, trying to watch them as they stalk toward me. The one at the exit I just came in from charges at me, and my eyes fly wide, a shriek leaving my lips when it too is suddenly mauled, mere inches away from me.The huge black wolf from before starts ripping it to shreds and knocking me out of the way when the other four join the fray, trying to kill him. Scrambling back on my hands and feet, I turn, looking for a way to escape, when I see one wolf tear into the black wolf's hind leg. Panic ripples through me at the sight, knowing that the wolf is the only thing keeping me alive.I stare at my hand and remember the knife. Getting my hands and knees, I scramble to my feet. I rush toward the one ripping at his rear leg while two try to get at him from the side, the other dead on the ground. I plunge the knife into the filthy gray wolf. It rears back and snarls then wheezes when I pull the knife out just as quickly.Only it doesn't kill him. It only fuels his rage. Panic surges through me as I watch him stalk toward me, his eyes burning with fury. The other two wolves are still being torn apart by the black wolf when more rush in. My breath catches in my throat. I'm trapped. Before I can even move, the gray wolf lunges at me, its fangs sinking into my shoulder, and I scream as pain rips through me.The wolf shakes its head violently, tearing into my flesh. Blood spills out, pooling around me as I try to scramble away, but the wolf releases me just as quickly, leaving me gasping, shivering in agony.I roll onto my side, every movement sending waves of pain through me. Blood slicks the floor beneath me, making it harder to drag myself toward the walk-in freezer. I reach for the handle, desperate, my hands trembling, but the sound of the battle intensifies. More wolves charge in, knocking over steel benches, sending utensils flying through the air, the chaos growing by the second. The black wolf, my unexpected savior, is now surrounded, outnumbered, bloodied, and still, he fights.With each blow, I see him slow, his body weakening, blood seeping through his fur. Yet he doesn’t retreat. His body moves with a precision that defies the odds, positioning himself between me and the wolves.I feel completely powerless, trapped in a human body, unable to shift, unable to help. My heart aches with the weight of it. All I can do is watch as the wolf continues to protect me.Who is he? Why hasn’t he abandoned me to save himself?

It's also a very large multinational company.

Anyways, shortly after I applied I reached out to the hiring manager, a director, and manages to secure a coffee chat to discuss the role which I am hoping goes well as this role would be perfect for me at the time and I match it about 70%. The part I'm worried about is during that time and before our coffee session next week I received a rejection email from the role (probably from recruiting or ATS system maybe). As a result do I mention it or do you think they may catch up to it and just tell me in person the role is not for me? How should I navigate this to secure the role.

Throughout our relationship, I've felt constant pressure to be more romantic and outgoing, while struggling with my mental health and focusing on keeping us financially stable.

# First Breaking Point

Around the 4.5-year mark, I was completely burned out. Running my own business while managing mental and physical health issues had left me anxious, irritated, and low on energy, also I've gained a lot of weight and picked up some bad habits. Meanwhile, my girlfriend was feeling pressure mainly from people on her socials getting married, having babies and so on.

She began pushing me toward marriage, and I felt pressured into proposing during our vacation. After that came her friend's wedding, which I attended reluctantly. The bachelor party became my breaking point – I didn't know anyone, was bullied and made fun of for being weird, and the experience left me traumatized. I had a complete mental breakdown.

After returning home, I confided in her about experiencing a complete mental breakdown. I explained that I needed to heal and was considering checking into some kind of facility or spa for a week or two. Rather than showing concern, she became angry with me—not because I was struggling, but because I hadn't offered to bring her along.

That moment became the turning point. I realized it was time to end our relationship.

What followed were multiple exhausting conversations where I felt entirely misunderstood. Eventually, I made the difficult decision to move out while she was at work. I sold our apartment and despite having always been the one financially supporting us, provided her with enough money to secure her own mortgage. At that point, I simply needed space to rebuild myself, I just wanted everything to be over as soon as possible.

# The 6 Month Break

During our separation, I quit my job, focused on healing, and returned to hobbies I'd abandoned. Honestly was depressed and in a bad place, was even contemplating suicide. We both tried to date other people unsuccessfully. Eventually she started calling constantly until I gave in. About a year ago, we reconciled and moved in together again – she rented out her apartment and joined me in my new place.

# Where We Are Now

* My situation: I’ve been focusing on personal growth—getting out of my shell, returning to work, and starting to lose weight (the main reason for my low energy). I’ve also been prescribed new medication, quit alcohol, and eliminated other bad habits.
* Her situation: She's financially stable, living rent-free with me while earning income from her work and from renting her apartment. I bought her a new car last month, however seems that it made her happy and grateful for like 2 weeks. She's trying to quit bad habits and loose weight together with me, however it seems that it's taking a toll on her an she's taking it out on me.

Despite all things going well, apparently emotionally we're dealing with the exact same problems as before.

The core issue remains her need for constant affection. If there's even a short period without romantic attention – like going a week without sex – she starts nagging and we end up fighting. Nothing I do seems enough, even though I show love in my own ways: hugs, kisses, deep talks, bringing her coffee, helping with errands, maintaining her car, and paying for appointments. I even arranged for us to take three months off work so we could take a road trip together and work on improving ourselves. Everything seemed to be fine during the roadtrip but once we came back home, I didn't see any motivation from her to work on herself or improve herself. None of that seems to matter when she feels she hasn't received enough attention for a week or two. Everything seems to go through the window.

# Our Latest Fight

Yesterday exemplified our problem perfectly. After an exhausting weekend spent between visiting her and my parents, I needed just one day to recover, catch up on work, and prepare for the week ahead. I told her that like two times. Yet still, on my only day off, she pressured me to go out biking. I declined, and she went alone.

While she was out, a friend made a surprise visit, we talked for some time and he left. After my fiancee returned, I told her that my friend visited me, which made her visibly irritated so she poured herself a drink. We watched TV together, then went to lie down around 6pm. I was exhausted and saw my friend messaged me, so I started texting with him.

She became furious, threw a tantrum about ""all the attention"" I give to my friend. She said that I'm talking too much about him, and she deeply hates him. Then she stormed out to the living room where she eventually began frantically cleaning at 9pm. Feeling angry and overwhelmed, I left my own home for an hour just to get away so I could collect my thoughts and understand wtf just happened.

When I returned, I tried once again to explain my situation – that I was drained from the weekend, affected by my ADD medication which makes me less emotional, dealing with health issues, and simply not able to be the romantic, energetic partner she wants right now. I need to take care of myself before I can share energy and joy with her. But she didn't seem to understand, and instead criticized me for not buying flowers for our ""6th anniversary"" (which I don't even count as a full six years since we were apart for six months). In the end we just went to sleep.

Today instead of starting my week I can't even focus or work for that matter, I feel completely messed up. Only thing that I do know is that these kind of tantrums can't and shouldn't be happening anymore, especially if we are planning any kind of future.

# My Current Dilemma

I'm starting to understand that my girlfriend might be struggling with depression and low self-worth herself – her mother is extremely depressed, manipulative and insufferable, and sadly I see similar patterns in her behavior. She doesn't have real close friends, nor hobbies. Instead, she seems to prefer chasing endless adventures or social media as an escape, while criticizing me during the times when she's not getting enough validation from me. Though she's aware of this, I'm losing hope that she'll ever work on herself.

As painful as it is to admit, I'm seriously questioning whether she's emotionally stable enough for us to have a future together, even though we've been planning to get married in the next 6-10 months.

Fact is, I'm not going to build any feature with a person who keeps getting silently resentful and throws childish tantrums in order to victimize herself and frankly has needs that I'm not able to always meet. I don't even understand why she reached out to me during the break, if it was that bad in the first place. I mean she knew exactly what she was signing for. It's not like I'm not improving and not working on myself. I am, it's just that everything takes time.

Currently I'm thinking of moving out for a week or two and suggesting couple's therapy, but at this point I don't even know where to start or if it's even worth spending my time/energy or even savings for that matter at this point anymore. 

Main question is this: If she didn't understand me after all this time, what will another break or some few therapy sessions will change? Is it even worth putting effort anymore if there seems to be some fundamental mismatch between expectations?

TL;DR: After 5.5 years with my fiancée, I'm at my second breaking point because despite my efforts to improve myself and maintain our stability, she still demands constant affection and throws tantrums when she feels neglected. I'm questioning if she's emotionally stable enough for our future together, as her patterns of resentment and need for validation haven't changed even though I've been working on my mental health and personal growth.",1,1745328937.0,BreakUps,0,1.0,False

My husband, Ryan, is standing on the karaoke stage, making a fool of himself. His shirt is unbuttoned halfway, his tie long abandoned, and his cheeks are flushed from too much whiskey.“And I………will always love you…..” he sings, closing his eyes.His voice is terrible.Standing next to him, practically glued to his side, is his secretary, Emily. Her left arm is around Ryan's waist, her fingers lightly grazing his back as she sings along. She’s younger than me, at least by half a decade, all wide eyes and perfect curves, dressed in a tight, low-cut dress that makes it impossible to ignore her presence. She leans into Ryan, whispering something in his ear, and he throws his head back, laughing. He looks at her like she’s the funniest person in the world.I’ve never seen him this happy.The last time I saw him this happy was on our wedding day, seven years ago. Back then, his eyes sparkled when he looked at me. Now, the light in them has grown dimmer; they're shining for someone else.Around me, everyone is laughing. It’s the company’s quarterly review party, and the employees are loose after a few too many drinks, finding Ryan and Emily’s performance hilarious. But I know what they’re really laughing at. They’re laughing at me. The CEO’s wife, sitting here while her husband practically gropes his secretary in front of everyone. The whispers, the side glances, they don’t even try to hide it.“Do you think they’re going to kiss?” someone whispers behind me.“Definitely. Bet they’ll be doing more than kissing after this,” someone else replies, and they both chuckle.I turn around to look at the people talking. Young, drunk, probably high on weed too. They must be interns. Only people with zero knowledge of the company’s hierarchy would make such a statement close to their employer’s wife.Or maybe they just don’t care.The girl, with messy blonde hair and red cheeks, locks eyes with me. “Hi!” she says, a little too loud. “Do you work here?”Do I work here? My eyes narrow. She's definitely an intern.She’s pretty, the kind of pretty that comes with youth and arrogance. The boy next to her drapes his arm lazily over her shoulders.I don’t respond. I just stare at them, cold and unblinking.Before I can say something that would make them regret their existence, I hear my name called.“Julie!” the voice says, drawing my attention.Even before I turn, I know who it is. Samantha, the vice president of marketing. We both work for Paragon Jewels, Ryan’s company, the leading manufacturer of luxury jewelry in North America. Her position is just below mine, so she’s one of the few who calls out my name like we’re friends, even though we’re not.“Samantha,” I reply, forcing a polite smile.“I didn’t know you were here, Julie. I was just telling the marketing team we have to get you involved more!”“Oh?” I say. “Why’s that?”“Well, you’re the head of marketing, and everyone wants to meet you! You’re so hard to catch these days. And besides, we never get a chance to chat at work,” she says, with an overplayed wink.Her gaze drifts to the stage where Ryan and Emily are swaying together, sharing the mic, laughing like they’re on some private date instead of a work event.“So, Mrs. O’Brien,” she says, smirking, “how are you enjoying the show so far?”She's mocking me. The fucking bitch.I force a bright smile. “Oh, it’s… fantastic,” I say, struggling to keep a straight face. “I’m thrilled to see my husband’s hard work is being rewarded with such… dedication from his staff.”The crowd is clapping now, giving Ryan and his secretary a standing ovation. I guess they're done with their nonsense.But then Ryan speaks into the microphone. “Before we get down, we’ve got one more song for you!”More applause. More laughter. And I just want the ground to open up and swallow me.Samantha looks at me with pity in her eyes. “Well… umm,” she says. “I’ll catch up with you later.”She quickly excuses herself.Behind me, I hear those interns whispering again. “Oh, my God. Did you hear what she said? That's Mrs. O’Brien.”I turn to glare at them one last time, and the boy shifts uncomfortably, pulling the girl to her feet. “Let’s go,” he mutters under his breath, and they stumble away, sneaking a look at me before disappearing into the crowd.Good. Let them run.I turn back to the stage, my heart pounding in my chest. Ryan is singing “Everything I Do”—if you can call that singing. Emily is now pressed against him, her hand running up his arm in a way that makes my stomach twist. She’s completely shameless, and he’s too drunk to even notice—or worse, he doesn’t care.I can’t take it anymore.Without thinking, I push my chair back and stand. My heels click against the floor as I march toward the stage. I can feel the weight of everyone’s eyes on me, the whispers dying down as they realize what’s happening. They’ve been waiting for this—waiting to see if I’ll crack.But I don’t care. I’m done playing the perfect wife.I climb the steps to the stage, each footstep feeling heavier than the last. Ryan doesn’t notice me at first, too lost in his drunken performance, but Emily spots me and her smile falters. Good.“Ryan,” I say. “We’re leaving now.”Ryan looks at me, surprised. “Why?” he slurs, still holding the microphone. “The party's just getting started.”I grit my teeth, my fists clenched. “Let’s go. Now.”“Julie, come on,” he says, sounding annoyed now, as if I’m the one ruining his night.I can’t help it. Something inside me snaps.Without another word, I turn and walk toward the back of the stage. The technical operators sitting in the booth look up as I approach, their faces going pale.“Who’s in charge here?” I ask.They all point to a man standing near the soundboard, holding a half-eaten donut. His eyes widen as he sees me.“Mrs. O’Brien,” he stammers, quickly setting the donut aside. “Is there something—uh—something I can do for you?”“Shut it down. All of it,” I say. “The party’s over.”He blinks, not sure if I’m serious, but one look at my face and he scrambles to obey. His hands fly across the controls, and within seconds, the speakers cut out with a harsh screech. The lights dim. The music dies. Silence falls over the room like a heavy curtain, and all that’s left is the sound of my heels as I walk back to center stage.Ryan is standing there, his microphone useless in his hand.“Julie, what the hell?” Ryan mutters.I meet his eyes, feeling the weight of everything I’ve been holding in for too long. “You’ve had your fun,” I say quietly, but with enough steel in my voice that it stops him from saying anything else. “Now it’s over.”I don’t wait for a reply. I grab his arm and start leading him down the stairs.Ryan stumbles slightly, caught off guard by my sudden forcefulness. His eyes flick to the crowd, scanning their faces for something, maybe support, validation, but all he finds are wide eyes and muted whispers. Everyone’s too shocked, too entertained by the unfolding drama, to come to his defense.The whispers start immediately. I hear snatches of conversation as we pass. Let them talk. Let them laugh.Ryan's too drunk to fight me, too embarrassed to protest. For once, he’s the one who’s quiet, and I’m the one in control.Justin, Ryan’s bodyguard/chauffeur, sees us coming and is already moving into action. He steps forward, opening the back door of the car without a word.Ryan mumbles something under his breath—maybe an apology, maybe an excuse—but I don’t stop. I don’t even look at him. I tighten my grip, forcing him into the backseat with a firm push, and he collapses into the car.“Take us home,” I say, climbing in behind Ryan. Then I slam the door shut.CHAPTER 002: An Open MarriageIt’s true what they say about marriage: one partner is always happier than the other.In my case, I’m the unhappy one.I’m the one who can’t sleep. I’m the one who watches her husband’s sleeping face at night, looking for a sign—anything to prove what I’ve suspected all along, that he’s cheating on me. Just say a word, goddammit, a name, something, dear God. That’s all I want. Say Emily, Ryan. Say Emily.But Ryan never does. He’s too controlled for that.I’m the one checking his phone, seeing notifications from the same person, the same tiny image. But I can’t see the name of the sender, can’t recognize the face due to the image size—though it looks like Emily. I can’t even read the messages because Ryan has privatized his pop-up notifications.I’m in the kitchen right now, already on my fifth cup of coffee. And it’s just 6 AM.“Morning,” Ryan says, walking in, rubbing his temple. “Feels like someone took a chainsaw to my head. Last night was fun.”“I’m glad you had fun,” I reply, trying to keep my voice steady, but the bitterness slips through. He notices it, of course. He always does.“Something wrong?” Ryan asks, eyeing me cautiously.“Wrong?”“You seem… I don’t know, off.”I’m counting down from ten in my head. Calm down, Julie. Calm the hell down. But how can I? Ryan disgraced me last night, and he doesn’t even remember?“I’m fine,” I say.Ryan fetches himself a cup of coffee and joins me at the table. He’s watching me with that innocent look of his.Sometimes I forget how handsome he is. With his lovely, sharp jawline and his bright green eyes. The eyes were the first thing I fell in love with. We were freshmen in college, and Ryan mistook me for some girl he brought to the frat party, a girl he swore was his girlfriend. And well, I played along. I enjoyed playing the part, letting him call me Vivian. And in the morning, when he was sober again and didn’t recognize me, I told him Vivian no longer wanted him and I did.Funny how things turn out.“You say you’re fine,” Ryan says, breaking the silence, “but you keep looking at me like you want to murder me.”I grip the edge of the table, my nails digging into the wood. “You humiliated me last night, Ryan. How is anyone supposed to respect me when my own husband doesn’t?”“What are you talking about?”“I’m talking about your stupid karaoke performance yesterday with that bitch, Emily.”Ryan slaps his forehead dramatically. “Oh, not this again. I’ve told you a hundred times, Julie, there’s nothing to worry about. You always bring her up, like you’re obsessed or something.”“Obsessed?”I want to throw my coffee cup at something, and it definitely isn’t the wall.“You have a life most women would kill for,” he continues. “A great job, a husband who comes home every night. Do you know how many women throw themselves at me? And yet, I come home to you. I pay your family’s bills. I’ve set up trust funds for your nieces and nephews. But it’s never enough, is it? You’re always whining about the same thing—Emily this, Emily that. It’s exhausting.”I’m shaking now, my heart pounding so hard I can barely breathe. But if I say anything more, he’ll call my mother again, and she’ll tell me I’m being ungrateful. “Stop trying to push Ryan into divorcing you, Julie,” she’ll say. “No one wants hand-me-downs. Do you want to be alone forever? Go on your knees and tell Ryan you’re sorry for being a bitch.”“How would you like me to show my gratitude, my lord?” I say, glaring at Ryan. “Should I commission a carven image of you and worship it?”“I’m not in the mood for your sarcasm, Julie. My head is already pounding enough.” Then something crosses his eyes, a strange look. “Actually, there’s something I’ve been meaning to discuss with you. I feel like now’s the right time.”Oh, God. My stomach tightens. He’s going to ask for a divorce. I can feel it. Mom’s going to kill me. She already planned a vacation in Rio in December.“What is it?” I ask, bracing myself.“I want an open marriage.”For a moment, the words don’t register. “What?” I say.“That’s when a couple decides to give each other room to see other people, and—”“I know what an open marriage means, Ryan. Jesus Christ. The answer is no.”He looks at me with disdain. “I wasn’t asking. From now on, we’re in an open marriage. When you see me with someone else, don’t bother asking questions.”My heart slams in my chest. “It’s only an open marriage if I agree. And I don’t.”I’m on my feet now, pacing the kitchen, trying to contain the rage and hurt boiling inside me. Seven years of marriage, and I’m already gearing close to a heart attack.“I want kids, Julie,” Ryan says. “How am I supposed to have any if I don’t date someone else?”I can’t help it; I begin to cry. “But it’s not my fault.”“It’s not my fault either. Maybe it’s just us together.”I can’t believe he said that. We’ve tried for seven years, spent a lot of money. And it’s always the same reply: you’re both healthy. The embryos are just acting weird. Nine IVFs.I untie my robe and let it fall to the floor, stripping down until I’m standing naked in front of him. Ryan’s eyes widen in surprise.I move closer and straddle him. I then grab his hand and place it on my chest. “Does this not move you anymore?”“Julie—”“Am I ugly to you now?” I reach into his pants, but he quickly stands, pushing me away.“Stop it,” he says firmly, putting space between us. “Put your clothes back on.”Trembling, I watch as he walks away, heading for the stairs.“Wait,” I call out, my voice shaky.Ryan turns, impatient. “What?”“It’s cool,” I say, my voice hollow. “Let’s have an open marriage.”Ryan nods. “Good.”And just like that, he walks away, leaving me in a million pieces.\~\~\~I like to say I’m a calm person. Sometimes I swear I’m the most level-headed person I know. All my family are maniacs. My sisters, my brothers. My parents. I’ve always been the one bailing people out of prison. I’ve been the designated driver during college wild night parties. I’ve been the cover-up story for my friends in high school. Yeah, everyone claimed they were spending the night at Julie’s house. Because their parents knew I’m a decent person.But for the first time in my life, I think I want to kill someone.I’m watching our driveway from the window, and Ryan is stepping out of his car with none other than Emily. Fucking Emily. And she’s carrying suitcases.“What’s going on?” I ask as soon as Ryan and Emily step into the house.Ryan smiles. “Julie, meet Emily.”“I know who she is, Ryan.”“Good. Then I won’t need to explain. Emily’s moving in.”I’m honestly too stunned to speak. What does he mean by that? After what feels like ages, I ask, “Is she homeless?”“No,” Ryan says. “She’s my girlfriend now.”CHAPTER 003: The BarI look at Ryan, then Emily. “I don’t understand.”Ryan doesn’t even look at me, just grabs Emily’s hand and starts leading her away. “Stop being such a bad host, Julie. We’ve had a long day.”“No way, Ryan. She’s not staying in this house,” I say, my voice shaking with disbelief.He doesn’t respond. They’re already halfway up the stairs.“Do you hear me? She’s not staying here! Take her back to wherever you picked her up. I don’t want her in my house.”Ryan stops, turning just enough to glare at me. “Your house? I put a roof over your head. If I say she’s staying, she’s staying. If you don’t like it, go somewhere else. I don’t have the energy for your nonsense, Julie.”Oh, my god. My chest tightens. “How could you do this?” I say. “Don’t walk away from me, Ryan. Stand here and answer me.”Emily turns to look at me, smirking. “By the way, you’ll need to move your things into the guest room. I’m not sharing a bed with you and Ryan. It’s bad enough sharing him with you.”All the energy in me evaporates. I just stand there, speechless. I can’t move. I can’t breathe. I hear them whispering and giggling as they head into our bedroom. My room. They’re kicking me out of my own room.The living room suddenly feels too small.I stumble to the front door, fling it open, and run outside, needing to escape. I don’t know where I’m going, but I can’t be here.“Ma’am, are you alright?” Justin, Ryan’s bodyguard, asks as I approach, breathless. He’s wiping down Ryan’s Rolls-Royce, eyeing me with concern.I hold out my hand. “The keys.”“Ma’am?”“The damn keys, Justin.”He hesitates for a second, but hands them over. I know he’s wondering why I need Ryan’s car when I have my own. Honestly, I don’t know either. But if I stay here for one more second, I might lose it completely.“Mrs. O’Brien, let me drive you—”“No, Justin. I’ll drive myself.”I pull out of the driveway and speed off into the night.\~\~\~It’s been over an hour, and I’m still driving aimlessly. My mind is a blur of everything—Ryan, Emily, their smug faces. Initially, I’d planned a Saturday evening manicure and pedicure, just to get my mind off things. Things that involve Ryan. But I’m no longer in the mood to get my feet and hands pampered. It’s not even been two days since he dropped that bombshell about an open marriage, almost giving me a heart attack, and now he’s bringing his mistress over? Emily? The same Emily?The craziest thing is I can’t cry. I feel nothing. No tears, no anger—just this hollow emptiness. The last therapist I spoke with said it’s a defense mechanism. That I’m in denial of my actual emotions. Cry it out, Julie, she used to say. Let yourself be free of the burden.Well, they can all go to hell. Ryan. Emily. The therapist. My entire family.I know what I need. A drink.I pull into the nearest bar and head inside.“A shot of whiskey,” I tell the bartender. “Neat. And keep them coming.”“Long night?”“I don’t want to talk about it,” I say.He pours the first shot, and I throw it back, welcoming the burn in my throat. It’s harsh, but it’s better than the alternative—thinking about what’s happening back home.As I down my second shot, I hear someone call out, “Maggie! Maggie!”I turn, confused, and see a tall, handsome man approaching me, his eyes locked on mine. Before I can react, he’s wrapping his arms around me. “Thank God I found you,” he says, pulling me into a tight hug.I stiffen. “Who the hell are you?”“Please, just go along with it,” he whispers in my ear. “I’ll explain later. I promise.”Before I can push him away, a furious-looking woman storms over.“Luke! I knew it. You can’t hide from me.”The stranger—Luke, apparently—turns to face her, still keeping his arm around me. “Veronica, what a surprise,” he says, feigning nonchalance.“My name isn’t Veronica, it’s Evelyn.”Luke flashes her a sheepish smile. “Right, sorry. I get those mixed up sometimes. Anyway, this is Maggie—my wife.”He lifts my hand, showing off my wedding ring, and I nearly choke. What is happening?Evelyn glares at me. “You married this scumbag?”I don’t know what to say, so I just nod.“You should divorce him,” she snaps. “He spends one night with you and disappears the next. Who does that?”“But that's what we agreed on. A one-night st—” Luke begins, but Evelyn cuts him off.“Fuck you, Luke.”And with that, she storms off, leaving the two of us standing there, stunned.Luke breathes a sigh of relief. “Well, that one was a stalker. At least she's off my back now.” He turns to me, smiling. “Can I buy you a drink? You’ve definitely earned it.”I stare at him and then stare at the spot where the angry lady once stood. It all happened so fast. I can't even process it. I think I need that drink.“Make it two,” I say.And Luke smiles.CHAPTER 004: The Deal\~\~Luke\~\~Lord knows I’ve seen my fair share of beauties.But the lady beside me is something else. Not only is she the prettiest thing I’ve seen, but she’s married. Some men are just lucky.“So, I’m guessing your name isn’t Maggie?” I ask, trying to ease the tension.“No,” she replies flatly.I nod, waiting for her to give me something more. “So, what is it?”She gives me a slow, deliberate look. I can’t lie, wherever her eyes touch immediately burns.“Look,” I say, raising my hands in mock surrender. “I’m not hitting on you. Honestly, I’m taking a break from women. They’re problematic.”She lets out a laugh, a bitter one. “You’re the one who just hugged a stranger to dodge another woman you’ve clearly wronged, and you’re saying we’re the problematic ones? You men are all the same.”She downs her drink like it’s water and winces at the burn. That’s her second shot in less than five minutes. I’ve got to say, I’m impressed.“Let’s start over,” I suggest, offering her a fresh start. “I’m Luke.”She rolls her eyes. “Yeah, I caught that. Your ‘problematic’ ex wouldn’t shut up about it.”“She's not my ex,” I say.“Whatever.”Great, another woman convinced I’m the villain. Not even five minutes in and she’s already pegged me as the problem. I guess I deserve that one.“So, are you going to tell me your name?” I ask, trying again.I can tell she’s got money just by looking at her. She’s probably an heiress or the wife of some big-shot businessman. Those Louboutins, the Rolls-Royce keys sitting on the bar, and that dress—all of it screams wealth. Maybe that’s why she’s not keen on giving me her real name.“You don’t have to tell me your last name,” I say with a grin. “But you look like you could use someone to talk to. Since you just saved my ass back there, I figure it’s the least I can do.”She watches me for a moment, her expression unreadable, before finally relenting. “Julie. My name’s Julie.”“Nice to meet you, Julie,” I say, extending my hand.She takes it.\~\~\~Julie’s on her fifth glass of whiskey, and at this point, she’s unstoppable, pouring out her life story like we’ve known each other for years. I’ve already told the bartender to cut her off, but she hasn’t noticed yet.“...So, I’m standing there, and they’re both going upstairs. To my room. And do you know what the bitch says?” Julie doesn’t wait for me to reply. “She says I need to move out of my room. My room.” She laughs so hard that she starts coughing. And then, just as suddenly, she’s sobbing.I don’t know what to do. How do you comfort someone else’s wife without crossing a line?“Julie,” I say. “Are you okay?”She shakes her head. “I need another drink.”“No, you don’t.”She frowns at me. “What? You think I need one more person telling me how to live my life? You can all go to hell. I said I need a drink.” She taps her empty glass against the bar, but the bartender, Mart, knows better than to disobey me.“Sorry, I own the bar, and I can’t let you drink anymore,” I say.Her eyes narrow. “Oh, you own the bar? Good for you. I’ll find another one.”She tries to stand, but I step in her path.“Listen, Julie, I know you’re hurting, but this isn't the way to go about it. Have you thought about divorce?”For the first time, her eyes soften, and she slumps back onto the barstool. “I can’t. I don’t want to be a disappointment to my family. They depend on Ryan’s money.”I let out a snort. “Screw them. It’s your life. No one should make you feel like this.”She gives a sarcastic smile. “Easy for you to say, Mr. I-own-the-bar.”I’ve seen people like Julie before, people who won’t leave a toxic relationship because, deep down, they still love the person.

for coffee enthusiasts,busy professionals,tech-savvy consumers,and homeowners alike,the allure of freshly ground coffee beans transformed into a steaming cup of perfection is undeniable.The Cuisinart automatic grind and brew coffee maker promises to deliver exactly that: the convenience of automation paired with the superior taste of freshly ground beans.

[[Explore Top Rated cuisinart automatic grind and brew on Amazon.]](https://storeins.com/chefs-knife/?kw=cuisinart automatic grind and brew)
## The Appeal of Convenience: Why Choose a Grind and Brew Coffee Maker?

Before we dive into specific models, let's address the core benefit: convenience. A grind and brew coffee machine combines a coffee grinder and a drip coffee maker into one appliance.This eliminates the need for separate devices, saving valuable counter space and simplifying the brewing process. Imagine waking up in the morning and, with a single touch of a button, initiating the grinding and brewing process. The aroma of freshly ground coffee filling your kitchen – a far superior experience compared to using pre-ground coffee. For busy professionals looking for effortless solutions, or for anyone who values time savings, a Cuisinart automatic coffee maker offers a significant advantage.

## Understanding the Key Features: What to Look for

When evaluating a Cuisinart automatic grind and brew coffee maker,several key features warrant careful consideration:

*   **Grinder Type:** The grinder is arguably the most crucial component. There are two primary types: blade grinders and burr grinders. Blade grinders utilize spinning blades to chop the coffee beans, while burr grinders use two revolving abrasive surfaces to crush the beans uniformly.Burr grinders generally produce a more consistent grind, resulting in better coffee flavor and less sediment. The Cuisinart coffee maker with burr grinder, like the DGB-800, often commands a higher price point but offers a superior brewing experience. However, models like the Cuisinart grind and brew dgb 900bc may use blade grinder technology and still provide satisfactory results.
*   **Capacity:** Consider how much coffee you typically brew. Cuisinart grind and brew coffee makers are available in various sizes, typically ranging from 10 to 12 cups. Ensure the selected model meets your household's needs.*   **Programmability:** A programmable coffee maker with grinder lets you set the brew time in advance, allowing you to wake up to freshly brewed coffee. This feature is invaluable for busy individuals who want to streamline their morning routine. Look for models with a 24-hour programmable timer.
*   **Brew Strength Control:** Some models offer brew strength control, enabling you to customize the intensity of your coffee. This is a useful feature for those who prefer a stronger or weaker brew.
*   **Water Filter:** A built-in water filter can improve the taste of your coffee by removing impurities from the water. This is especially beneficial if you have hard water or water with a noticeable taste.
*   **Carafe Type:** Automatic grind and brew coffee makers typically come with either a glass carafe or a thermal carafe.Thermal carafes keep coffee hot for longer without the need for a warming plate, which can sometimes scorch the coffee.
*   **Cleaning and Maintenance:** Ease of cleaning is essential. Look for models with removable parts that are dishwasher-safe. Features like the AutoRinse,found in some models,help to keep the grinder clean. Understanding cuisinart grind and brew cleaning protocols will extend the lifespan of your coffee maker.
*   **Warranty:** A good warranty provides peace of mind and protects your investment. Check the manufacturer's warranty terms before purchasing. Consider looking into the cuisinart grind and brew warranty terms.

## Model Comparison: Top Cuisinart Grind and Brew Coffee Makers in 2025

While specific models and their features may evolve,let's explore some archetypal models based on available facts and anticipate what we might see in 2025:

*   **The Cuisinart DGB-900BC Grind and Brew Thermal Automatic Coffeemaker:** This is often a popular choice for its thermal carafe,which keeps coffee hot for hours without affecting the taste. The Cuisinart dgb 900bc review frequently enough highlights its programmability, ease of use, and durable construction. Key features include a 12-cup capacity, 24-hour programmability, and brew strength control. Keep an eye out for the Cuisinart dgb 900 in sales for the best possible deal. Features could include an updated user interface, improved thermal carafe insulation, and enhanced grinding technology.
*   **The Cuisinart DGB-800 Burr Grind & Brew 12-Cup Automatic Coffeemaker:** As the name suggests,this model features a burr grinder,which offers superior grind consistency and flavor. The Cuisinart DGB-800 is often praised for its DirectFlow grind assembly and AutoRinse feature, which contribute to easy cleaning. Anticipate potential upgrades to the burr grinder mechanism for even greater performance and longevity, perhaps with quieter operation.
*   **The Cuisinart DGB-400 Series (e.g., DGB-400NAS):** This model is often considered a more budget-kind option and typically uses a blade grinder. while it may not offer the same level of grind consistency as a burr grinder model, it still provides the convenience of an all-in-one grind and brew system. Expect future iterations to focus on improving the blade grinder's performance, perhaps with redesigned blades or improved bean distribution.

--------------------------------------------------------------------

<div>Adopting a vegan lifestyle often sparks a deeper awareness of how our choices impact the planet. But for those committed to sustainability, simply carrying reusable grocery bags is just the beginning. Going zero-waste as a vegan means rethinking everyday household items to reduce plastic waste, single-use products, and excess packaging. If you're looking to elevate your eco-conscious living beyond reusable bags, here are seven essential household swaps that can help you achieve a truly zero-waste vegan home.

### 1. Replace Plastic Wrap with Beeswax or Vegan Wrap Alternatives

Traditional plastic wrap is a major contributor to landfill waste and often contains harmful chemicals. Many zero-waste vegans opt for beeswax wraps, but since beeswax is an animal product, vegan alternatives like wraps made from soy wax, candelilla wax, or plant-based wax blends are excellent options. These wraps are washable and reusable, perfect for covering bowls, wrapping veggies, or storing snacks. Using them cuts down on plastic usage dramatically and keeps your food fresh without toxic chemicals.

### 2. Swap Disposable Paper Towels for Cloth Towels or Reusable Paper Towels

Paper towels might seem convenient, but they create waste every time you reach for one. Switch to washable cloth towels made from organic cotton or bamboo fibers, which can last years and minimize single-use trash. If you prefer the convenience of disposable towels, try reusable paper towels like those made from hemp or recycled materials that you can compost or recycle afterward. By making this swap, you lower demand for tree pulp and plastic packaging commonly used in paper products.

### 3. Use Refillable Cleaning Products in Glass or Aluminum Containers

Household cleaning supplies often come in plastic bottles that cannot be reused. Choose biodegradable, plant-based cleaners sold in bulk and transfer them to durable glass or aluminum spray bottles that you refill as needed. This practice cuts down on plastic bottle consumption and reduces exposure to harsh chemicals typically found in cleaning products. Plus, many refill stations and zero-waste shops carry vegan-friendly cleaning concentrates that promote ethical formulas.

### 4. Make the Switch to Bamboo Toothbrushes with Compostable Handles

Plastic toothbrushes take centuries to break down and contribute significantly to microplastic pollution. A bamboo toothbrush with a compostable handle is a sustainable alternative that fits well with a zero-waste vegan lifestyle. Bamboo grows quickly and requires fewer resources than plastic production. Often paired with biodegradable nylon bristles, these brushes can be disposed of safely without harming animals or the environment.

### 5. Choose Shampoo and Conditioner Bars Instead of Bottled Products

Cleansing products for hair are notorious for excessive plastic waste. Shampoo and conditioner bars are a brilliant zero-waste alternative, often packaged in recyclable or compostable paper. These bars last longer than liquid formulas and eliminate the need for plastic containers. Many brands offer vegan-certified bars made with natural ingredients, free from sulfates and parabens, ensuring you maintain ethical beauty routines while being kind to the earth.

### 6. Opt for Cloth Produce Bags Over Plastic Ones

Although reusable grocery bags are well-known, many forget smaller plastic bags used for produce. Switching to breathable cloth produce bags made from organic cotton or hemp allows you to carry fruits and veggies without disposable plastic packaging. These bags are washable, durable, and help your food stay fresher longer. Using these instead of single-use plastic produces a significant waste reduction in your grocery trips.

### 7. Replace Disposable Razors with Safety Razors

Disposable razors add up to a hefty amount of plastic waste throughout the year. Safety razors with replaceable metal blades are a long-lasting alternative that reduces packaging waste and plastic pollution. They work well for sensitive skin, create less irritation, and provide a close shave. Besides being more sustainable, this switch is often more economical over time.

Embracing a zero-waste vegan lifestyle means consciously choosing products that respect both animal welfare and the environment. Beyond carrying reusable grocery bags, these seven household swaps allow you to reduce your plastic footprint, avoid harmful chemicals, and contribute positively to planetary health. By making thoughtful, sustainable choices in your home, you create a powerful ripple effect toward a cleaner, greener future.

</div>How to Maintain a Sustainable Vegan Lifestyle with Minimal Waste in Everyday Living
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Embracing a Zero-Waste Approach in the Vegan Household

Living a vegan lifestyle often inspires a deeper connection with the environment, encouraging choices that extend beyond diet into how daily habits affect the planet. Reducing waste, especially at home, aligns closely with these values. By focusing on sustainable strategies, you can maintain a vegan lifestyle that minimizes environmental impact and promotes conscious consumption.

### Start with Thoughtful Shopping Habits

One of the simplest ways to reduce waste is by carefully choosing how and what you buy. Instead of opting for packaged foods, visit local farmers’ markets and bulk food stores where you can bring your own containers. This practice cuts down on single-use plastics and encourages support for local, organic produce, which often has a smaller carbon footprint.

- **Bring reusable produce bags:** Swap plastic bags for cloth or mesh produce bags when buying fruits and vegetables.
- **Choose whole foods:** Foods without packaging, like fresh veggies, grains, and nuts, generate less waste at home.
- **Buy in bulk:** Purchasing beans, lentils, and other staples in bulk reduces packaging waste and often saves money.

### Kitchen Practices that Cut Down on Waste

Adopting zero-waste principles in the kitchen complements your vegan diet perfectly. Cooking at home using fresh ingredients lets you control what you consume and drastically reduces food and packaging waste.

#### Composting Saves Organic Waste

Composting food scraps such as vegetable peels, coffee grounds, and fruit skins keep waste out of landfills and enrich your garden or potted plants. If you don’t have outdoor space, consider small indoor compost bins or vermicomposting with worms.

#### Plan Meals Efficiently

Meal planning helps reduce food spoilage and waste. When you plan your meals around what you have and what you can store well, you cut down on buying excess food that might end up in the trash.

### Sustainable Kitchenware and Storage Solutions

Switching to eco-friendly kitchenware contributes significantly to waste reduction. Choose reusable, durable, and biodegradable products to replace disposable options.

- **Beeswax wraps:** An excellent alternative to cling film, beeswax wraps keep food fresh and are washable and reusable.
- **Glass or stainless steel containers:** Store leftovers without plastic, and avoid single-use wrap or bags.
- **Cloth napkins and towels:** Replace paper towels and napkins with washable fabric options to cut down on paper waste.

### Personal Care and Cleaning with Minimal Waste

Sustainable living extends into personal care and home cleaning routines. Many products contain harmful chemicals and come in plastic packaging, making them harmful for the environment.

#### Zero-Waste Personal Care Items

Switch to solid shampoo bars, bamboo toothbrushes, and refillable deodorants. These items generate less plastic waste and often come from cleaner, vegan-friendly ingredients.

​ -Get access to the Ultimate Vegan Cookbook package here--&gt; https://hownow101.com/vegan-recipes  
#### Homemade Cleaning Alternatives

Use simple, natural ingredients like vinegar, baking soda, and lemon juice to make effective and non-toxic cleaning solutions. These options reduce packaging and the use of harmful chemicals in your home.

### Repurpose and Repair Before Replacing

Cultivating a mindset of repairing and reusing helps you avoid unnecessary waste. Whether it’s vegan clothing, kitchen utensils, or household items, look for ways to extend their lifespan.

- Patch up worn clothing rather than buying new.
- Repurpose glass jars as storage containers or for organizing small items.
- Create DIY projects from scraps, such as turning old fabric into cleaning cloths.

### Minimizing Packaging Through Community Resources

Engage with zero-waste or vegan communities in your area or online to share resources and tips. Bulk buying groups, local swaps, and vegan co-ops often offer packaging-free food and household items.

#### Refill Stations for Household Supplies

Many stores now offer refill stations for items such as laundry detergent, dish soap, and even cooking oils. Bringing your own containers here helps you buy only what you need without excess packaging.

​ -Get access to the Ultimate Vegan Cookbook package here--&gt; https://hownow101.com/vegan-recipes  
### Mindful Waste Disposal and Energy Use

Even when waste is inevitable, responsible disposal and resource conservation matter. Recycling correctly, reducing water usage, and conserving electricity will complement your zero-waste vegan lifestyle.

- Separate recyclables accurately to prevent contamination.
- Use energy-efficient appliances and switch off devices not in use.
- Install water-saving fixtures or collect rainwater for irrigation.

Maintaining a sustainable vegan lifestyle with minimal waste is a rewarding journey that benefits both the planet and your well-being. With intentional choices in shopping, cooking, cleaning, and daily living, you can create a home that reflects your values—and inspire others to do the same.

### Conclusion

Embracing a zero-waste vegan lifestyle means going deeper than simply carrying reusable grocery bags. It’s about transforming everyday habits to minimize waste while honoring your commitment to sustainability and compassion. With thoughtful swaps like compostable kitchen tools, refillable cleaning products, and sustainable food storage options, you’ll find practical ways to reduce your environmental footprint right at home. These small changes add up, shaping a lifestyle that supports both the planet and animal welfare.

Maintaining minimal waste in your daily living doesn’t have to be complicated or overwhelming. By choosing mindful alternatives and making intentional decisions, you create a rhythm that fits naturally into your routine. Whether it’s opting for bulk buying without excess packaging or repurposing items creatively, each step builds resilience against waste and encourages a positive impact.

As you explore these zero-waste vegan swaps, remember the goal is progress, not perfection. Celebrate each sustainable choice you make, knowing it contributes to a healthier world. This approach not only benefits the environment but also nurtures a more conscious and fulfilling life. Start with one or two swaps, then expand as you feel comfortable—your journey toward a zero-waste vegan lifestyle is both achievable and rewarding.

I got it for $75 on sale and it’s been doing decently well. I hate the steam wand that it came with so I took off the metal part and so far so good. I don’t think it’s to a point where I’ll make latte art but it steams milk well :) I’m looking to upgrade my grinder game. Right now I have a $15 electric grinder with blades that grinds coffee by holding down a button. While it’s good enough for a beginner like me, I’m getting tired of having to actively scrape out the coffee grinds that get stuck on the metal and won’t be making accurate ratios. I was hoping to get a new grinder for less than $100 that will give me precise enough grinds and doesn’t have too much retention. Also that it shuts off automatically when it grinds the amount I want (either with a timer or set amount). Do you all have any recommendations?

I worked at Starbucks in 2023 but had to quit when I moved to an area that didn't have one. As a trans person in a state that's trying to legislate me out of existence, Starbucks is one of the only jobs that was willing to hire me. That mattered so much to me that I re-applied to work at a store that's 30 minutes from my house, and it's been working out well for me for the past 5 months. I genuinely love both the work and my coworkers. But the change in dress code just pisses me off.

I can't wear the Starbucks shirts that I bought with my own money. Can't wear the pins that I've been buying for literal years. I work here because I get to express myself. In a world that genuinely wants me dead or detransitioned, that matters to me. 

For a company that claims to ""value diversity"", Starbucks couldn't give two shits about us. I understand that no corporation truly cares for its employees or its diversity, but to present as though you do and then mandate for your employees to all dress exactly the same... that rubs me the wrong way. Starbucks wanted to go back to the ""indie coffee shop vibe"" earlier this year with the for-here cups, but no indie coffee shop I've ever been to has had a dress code that's more than ""don't show up naked"". 

It seems like our brand is having an identity crisis. On one hand, corporate is trying to go back to ""our indie roots"" and present as a ""third space where you can be yourself""; on the other, we're supposed to have crazy fast drive-thru times and an all-black uniform like other fast food places. 

My managers value me as an individual. I see it in their actions. And that's really nice. But corporate doesn't give a damn, and that's exhausting, especially in a world that wants me gone. So basically, I just want corporate to stop pretending to value ""what makes me unique"" if they're just going to make all of us act the same.",17,1745328346.0,starbucksbaristas,0,0.87,False

So I'm a 32M, married for 8 years with 4 kids. I love my wife, and she loves me. Wife is currently pregnant with our 5th.

I find that whenever I'm say, at the gym and I see a girl who I think is pretty, I start thinking thoughts like ""I'd love to chat with her, I'm sure she's nice"", and ""I wonder what she's like to snuggle closely with"". I don't thin crude-sex thoughts like ""oooooh, penetration in her must be wonderful!"", I'm not that crass about total strangers.

Also, sometimes a girl from my past (e.g. a girl I knew from high school) pops into my head and I look her up on the 'net and find myself thinking things like ""man, I wonder what having sex with her would've been like"". So I guess I *do* think about sex with some girls, tbh, but mostly my thoughts revolve around a relationship that includes snuggling, and my mind usually doesn't wander that far.

But thoughts like these make me nervous, like, if I was alone at a conference and a woman offered to go back to her room (or worse, if she followed me back to mine), I doubt I'd have the resolve to brush that attention away (because saying ""no"" to that level of attention would be like saying ""no"" to coffee when you haven't had one in days and it's coooold outside...I mean, I feel like most guys would *kill* for that level of attention from a girl, married or not). 

I've only ever had sex with my wife, so I thought that I was just curious about what sex is like with other girls, but I'm sane enough to realize that the cycle would never end, because there's always another one...

Open relationships aren't an option, for religious reasons (Jewish).

tl;dr

I *want* to feel more committed to my wife, and I feel like thoughts about other women are treasonous. I feel like there's probably a way to ""reprogram my brain"", but I don't know what it might be.",2,1745328239.0,marriageadvice,8,0.6,False

We call it the mirror particle. Terrans call it quantum entanglement. Classic Terrans—always giving things new names.

If you're wondering who they are, let me introduce our newest Galactic Society member race: the Terrans. (They used to call themselves “humans,” but apparently “Terran” just sounds cooler. Their words, not mine.)

Oh, right—I'm Councilor Verov, lead ambassador of the Galactic Society, species Xitrulax. Nice to meet you. Buckle up.

Terrans are... different. Always. And today? Today’s exhibit A.

You see, when most species receive mirror particle tech, they use it as intended: interstellar messaging. Simple. Elegant. Functional.

Terrans? Nah.

This morning, we summoned them into the Communion Chamber because our routine planetary scan of Terra (yes, they renamed Earth too) showed something... absurd.

There’s a structure spanning the entire planet. It looks like a massive net. Naturally, alarms went off.

So we called in their ambassador. Her name? Larz Goldilocks. Her vibe? Let’s just say... she walked into the chamber like she owned the place.

**Transcript begins:**

>“The hearing is now commenced,” said Vish’ari, chamber leader of Meridixian Prime. “Ambassador Larz, please stand at the podium.”



Ambassador Larz entered with diva energy. She strutted in, coffee in hand, sunglasses on indoors, slurped loudly, and said:

>“First summon since Terra joined the Society, huh?” Slurp. “I’m guessing it’s about that thing on the screen?”



She pointed at the display—a glowing image of a globe-wide net structure.

>“Yes,” Vish’ari said. “What is that, and why is it emitting mirror particle signatures?”



>“Ah,” Larz said with a grin. “You found our little side project. It’s called Project Blinking Planet. It’s a tech we built using your communication system. And yeah... it’s meant to turn our planet into a spaceship. Also, there’s more.”



Cue entire chamber losing its collective mind. Confused muttering. Shocked stares. A few dropped datapads. Larz raised her hand like a DJ quieting the crowd.

>“Let me explain. So y’all gave us this mirror particle thing, right? Our scientists saw it and went, ‘Hey, that’s teleportation waiting to happen.’ And then someone—Rick, bless him—asked: what if we teleport the whole damn planet? Next thing you know, engineers locked themselves in their labs, ordered too much pizza, and now we have this.”



>“But it’s a communication device!” shouted Berimanu, ambassador of Prakxima Star. “How does that become a planet-scale transporter?!”



>“Easy,” Larz replied. “What you call mirror particles, we call quantum entanglement. We’ve been working on teleportation for years. Your tech filled in the last puzzle piece. And when humans get puzzle pieces? We go full madness mode. Invention frenzy, baby.”



>“If I may theorize,” said Metranod of the Zagari Hive Mind, tentacles vibrating thoughtfully, “You encapsulated the planet in a space-time bubble, synced its frequency with a destination particle—essentially treating the planet as a quantum object?”



>“Exactly. Nailed it,” Larz said. “And we added a little something extra. We call it Grabbed It. It lets us bring celestial objects with us... or beam them to us. Think planetary-level inventory system. Plus, shield projection over the whole planet and anything we snag.”



>“That’s... potentially catastrophic,” I said cautiously.



>“Sure,” she shrugged. “But we tested it. On bread. On chicken. Even on Australia.”



>“Wait—in real life?” I asked.



>“Bread and chicken, yes. Australia was simulated. Moved 20 meters west. Kangaroos didn’t notice a thing.”



>“But why go this far? Why build all this?”



>“Because we can,” she said, sipping her coffee. “Also... it’s in case some cosmic shit ever happened. Like planet-killers, solar flares, angry space gods, whatever. Gotta stay prepped, you know?”



>“Thank you, Ambassador,” said Vish’ari, still mildly stunned. “Any objections?”



Silence. Awkward glances. Everyone voted no.

>“Hearing closed, then.”



If you’re wondering what the structure looks like: imagine a net of upside-down hexagonal pyramids floating in the stratosphere, all connected by glowing skybridges. It's like a planetary chandelier built by caffeinated engineers with zero chill.

I was in a fwb relationship with one girl who was 34-30-38. Thick mommy. She was buttery white and her nipples were perfectly brown. Asshole so good that you’ll dip your nose into it and tongue in that fat sour dumpling looking pussy 👅👅👅👅

Anyway. Back to the story. My mom and dad had left to meet my relatives and I was getting bored sitting at home so I give her a call. I tell her how Horny I’ve become for her and she can come to my house. She instantly agreed because she was having the time of her life with my 8inch tool . She used to love it. So she came in half an hour. 

She was wearing a green embroidered kurta and a leggings. Her thighs were properly visible through them and whenever I laid my eyes on her thighs I wanted to bite those. She parked her bike a little far from my society and came walking to my flat which is on second floor. I asked her to give me a call when she is downstairs so that I can keep the door open so neighbour aunty won’t see her coming. I left our door open. She came inside running. 

As soon as she entered the house, I started kissing her passionately because All I needed was her body. I walked a little bit by hugging her and caressing her but and locked the door. She was smelling so nice. She was using a “Victoria Secret - Rose” perfume and entire room smelled like her. I quickly lifted that thick mommy in my arms and brought her to bedroom while kissing her like a virgin. Putting my tongue inside her. Moving my tongue all over her neck and squeezing her butt. I throw her on the bed . She starts undressing herself. She takes off that Kurta and I see her in her undies. The black bra on a black leggings was just looking like a goddess 👅👅👅🥵🥵🥵. I quickly took off her leggings and started licking her toes. 
She was moaning and rubbing herself over her panties ( She was a good hoe) i start coming towards her pussy. I lick her entire left feet which was on my shoulder and her right feet on the bed spread. I bite her huge thighs. God I just loved them. I start rubbing her pussy over her panties. Her panties have become wet now and I take them off. Put them in my mouth and start fingering my whore👅👅👅👅

Her pussy was so creamy that It was feeling like a cake. She took her panties from my mouth and put in her own and pushed my mouth between her legs. I licked her like a dog👅👅👅She pushed my head deep inside her pussy and all her cream was on my face. She came on my face.

I start searching for condom, but to my surprise I did not have it. But both of us were so heated, I begged her to let me fuck raw, she was like “You can put a rod inside me rn, please fuck me fast”

Her body was asking for it. I put my dick inside her pussy and all her cream I felt it on my dick. I start stroking her. I ask her to lock her legs on my back and push my body against her. She does as I say so and I fucked her for a good 5 mins ( Because it was my first raw experience and I could not last longer). I came on her body👅👅👅

Now she dresses herself. I make coffee for her. We chitchat a bit. We smoke cigarettes and she leaves.

Fast forward 1 hour, I’m sitting on that bed where we fucked an hour ago and I’m really disappointed in myself that I couldn’t fuck a goddess of a girl well. While reflecting on that incident, I start getting her smell. The smell was coming from bedsheets and As soon as I smelled it, my dick stood up like it was on a mission. I turned around. Got in a doggy style position ready to smell the bedsheets all over which were immersed in her smell and my body literally felt her through that smell. I undress myself, close my eyes and while smelling the bedsheet start imagining her beneath me. I masturbated twice. That was such a fulfilling experience for me and I told her the very next day what I did😂😂

She smiled naughtily and Promised me that she’ll let me fuck raw again. We almost fucked like 500 times in a year after that and I came inside her for like 200 times. She was really a body of my dreams. I miss her😭",2,1745328130.0,DesiSexTalk,0,1.0,False

Will

I’ve escaped the life I once lived, chasing the dream of being free and finding happiness on my own terms. However, early this morning, a call from the hospital interrupts my new life with news of my father's death—the man I haven’t heard from in over three years.

He was never good to me or my mother. His cruelty and disdain drove my mother into depression, eventually leading her to suicide, leaving me at the mercy of a man who saw me as a burden simply for being born a woman.

I’m Robert Moore’s only daughter, and as such, it falls on me to handle my father’s body and all the funeral arrangements. But that’s not all. As I’m getting out of bed, I receive a call from my father’s lawyer, instructing me to be at the airport in less than an hour; they’re sending someone for me. At eighteen, I ran away from home, stayed off social media, changed my last name to my mother’s, went to college, and worked to pay my rent—all to stay off my father’s radar. Now it seems all of that was in vain, as they have my phone number and know where to find me. I’m now forced to do something I never wanted to—bury the last member of my family.

Resigned, with a faint feeling of guilt in my heart, I prepare to leave the city and fulfill my duty as a daughter to say goodbye to my father.

Just as the lawyer said, I’m met at the airport by a private plane with a flight attendant and a burly man who helps me board without uttering a word. Four years of running away, only for fate to catch up and drag me back to the city that has given me nothing but suffering.

Two hours later, I descend and recognize my father’s lawyer standing beside a car a few meters away. I approach him, extending my hand in greeting.

“Miss Moore, I’m sorry to see you under these circumstances.”

“Yeah, right. I’ll take you to your house, and once we’re there, we’ll have a conversation that can’t be delayed any longer.”

It’s barely dawn, and I need a coffee before I deal with all the formalities that will keep me trapped in this damned city, preventing me from returning to my normal life.

“What’s so urgent that it can’t wait?” I ask the man who’s worked for my father for as long as I can remember.

The lawyer opens the car door, and I get in after him, sitting in silence. The car moves through the city until we arrive at the place I once called home. I walk into Robert’s study and sit in his leather chair.

Everything looks exactly the same.

“Wait here for a moment, please. They’ll bring you a hot drink soon.” He leaves, leaving me alone.

I shouldn’t be wasting time here. I should be on my way to the hospital to get all this over with. But no, here I am, waiting for the lawyer who went off somewhere, feeling like an intruder in this place.

He returns after a while with a briefcase and sits across from me, pulling out a document.

“Please be quick and stop wasting my time. What do you need to tell me?”

Now I remember why my father and this man got along so well. The seriousness in his face and the complete lack of empathy are a mirror image of my father’s.

“Well, as your father’s lawyer and executor, I need to read Mr. Robert Moore’s will to conclude my duties, so you can handle yours.”

He first informs me of everything I need to know about my father’s illness and death, and then he begins reading the will. He asks me to sign, and once all the necessary signatures are in place, he shakes my hand and leaves.

I stand up, rubbing my temples, when two soft knocks at the door remind me that there are employees in this house who will soon be out of a job.

“Come in,” I say, and Matilde, the woman who has cared for this house since I was a child, enters with a tray of coffee, tears in her eyes. Is she crying because she’s losing her job or because of my father? Either way, I won’t ask.

She sets the cup in front of me and stands still, staring at me as if I were some kind of ghost or something. It’s clear she wants to say something; I can see the doubt in her.

“Sit down, Matilde. You look like you’re about to faint.” She doesn’t just look like she’s about to faint; she’s genuinely surprised.

“I’m fine standing, Miss Samantha. Do you need anything else?”

“Yes, sit,” I gesture to the chair in front of me, “because we need to talk.”

Matilde obeys and nervously wrings the edge of her apron in her hands. Her gaze isn’t on me; she’s only looking at her hands, waiting for me to tell her what she already knows.

“How long did you work in this house serving my father?”

It infuriates me to learn she worked here for more than twenty-five years and my father never formally hired her. Being here is only going to give me headaches.

After promising her and the other servants in the same situation a decent severance package, I board the car that brought me here and head to the hospital.

It only takes me an hour to arrange the funeral, sign the hospital documents, and identify my father’s body, which I barely glance at. In just a few hours, I change clothes, arrive at the cemetery, and say goodbye to my father once and for all.

From my home in Texas, I’ll handle my responsibilities. I have no intention of changing my lifestyle or revealing who I really am, especially since my boyfriend’s family is complicated. I have a good life in Austin, and everything I left behind needs to stay there, without interfering with my current life. I am Samantha Williams, the best pastry chef in the region and the master of my own destiny.

# Chapter 2

My Wedding to Derek

Two Years Later

My best friend is more excited than I am, and it’s not even her getting married. I look in the mirror and adore my wedding dress, hair, and makeup. It’s a simple wedding; only our mutual friends and all of their family are attending. They try to put on a good face, but deep down, I know they’re not on board with this because they expected more for their only son than the town's baker. Meanwhile, all I want is to be happy with the man who has been by my side since I arrived here six years ago.

“You look beautiful, Sam! When Derek sees you, he’ll feel like the luckiest man in the world to have you as his wife.” Emily fans her face with her hands, trying not to cry. She’s my maid of honor and has helped me with everything since my boyfriend proposed. “I can’t wait to see you with a big belly waiting for your first baby so I can go crazy buying thousands of things they probably won’t need.”

“Sure, if my mother-in-law doesn’t kill me before I reach the altar.”

She lets out a long sigh and lowers her arms, clearly tired of hearing the same thing. She knows perfectly well that Derek’s parents don’t like me, and they’ve shown it repeatedly. That’s why I never come here and don’t want to be around these people. They believe that the more you have, the more you’re worth, and that I’m just a simple girl without family who owns a small but busy bakery... well, I think you get the point.

“We can adjust this to avoid repetition and make the text flow better. Here’s a suggestion:”

“You’re marrying their son, not them. Live your ‘happily ever after’ and forget about the rest. I don’t know why you hold back on important things.” She complains; she’s the only one who knows who I am and where I come from. “I bet that would shut a few mouths.”

“I already own a considerable fortune; getting married was all I wanted, and…”

“You’re not going to come to your senses, are you?”

I shake my head in denial, and our conversation is interrupted when someone knocks on the door, and Eliot enters with a big smile when he sees me and his girlfriend. He’s Derek’s best friend and has been kind to me since we met.

“My girls!” he exclaims happily, kissing Emily on the lips. “You both look beautiful.”

Without exaggeration, Eliot is the sunshine that brightens my best friend’s days. He’s tall, muscular, with black hair and beautiful blue eyes.

“You don’t look too bad either. I can’t wait to see my friend in a dress even more stunning than mine. What the hell are you waiting for to propose to her?” He scratches his neck and, as always, looks nervous when the word “wedding” comes up. “Stop beating around the bush, or I’ll convince my friend to sue you for wasting five years of her time.”

She laughs, and Eliot looks like he’s about to faint from my threat, and they’re so adorable together that I overlook the fact that he doesn’t want to take that important step yet.

“We’ll talk about my wedding to Emily after you marry Derek, and if you survive the first anniversary, I’ll make the best proposal in the world, making my best friend’s look ridiculous.” He winks at his girlfriend, who gets excited by the words of the man she loves. “Now we need to head down, because I feel like Derek is going to die of nerves if you take one more minute.”

I nod happily, push everything that’s bothering me out of my mind, and leave the room to go down the stairs with my groomsmen.

The Johnson family is the wealthiest in the region; they practically own everything, which is why they think they’re royalty. Eliot offered to walk me down the aisle and take his place next to Derek afterward since I don’t have family. There are no two aisles for two families; there’s only one, and the only two people accompanying me are Emily and Eliot. The rest are Johnson relatives and friends who give me dirty looks, but I ignore them.

I only look ahead, smiling at the man who, starting today, will accompany me for the rest of my life.

“You look more beautiful than an angel, my love.” He says without losing the smile that lights up his face as he takes my hand.

We smile together throughout the ceremony, exchange vows, and kiss in front of everyone.

Yes, I am the happiest woman in the world, and I want everyone to see it. I don’t care that they don’t want me here or that I’m an orphan without family on the most important day of my life. I’m just enjoying the man who won’t let go of my lips and the few people who applaud for us.

“I love you.”

“I love you more.” He replies and takes my hand when the priest tells us we can go celebrate.

As I mentioned before, the wedding is quite intimate. We move to the garden decorated with candles and white flowers in every corner. Derek decides that only the two of us will sit at the main table to avoid making me uncomfortable, even if he doesn’t say it, so I don’t feel bad about not having a single family member by my side.

Despite everything, I feel happy and complete with him. Derek has been my rock, my unwavering support since we met six years ago. As we toast and share dinner, the joy of finally being married envelops us. Our mutual friends and the few family members who show us support come over to congratulate us and toast to our happiness. Between laughter and shared anecdotes, I feel the warmth and love surrounding us. I am grateful to Emilie and Eliot, our wedding godparents, for being by our side and making this day even more special.

The soft music and laughter fill the air as we enjoy the company of our loved ones. The night goes on with dancing and moments of intimacy between Derek and me, sealing the beginning of our journey together as a couple. Every glance, every gesture reflects the promise of a future filled with love and intimacy.

The party ends, and the guests head home. I take off the shoes that are killing me, and before entering the house, Derek lifts me in his arms and carries me inside, making me laugh as he covers my face with kisses until we enter the bedroom we will occupy just for today. We kiss once the door is closed, but we are interrupted by Margaret, my mother-in-law, who barges in uninvited and slaps me, leaving me bewildered. I don’t understand what’s happening or why she hits me so hard.

“Are you out of your mind, Mom? What the hell is wrong with you?” Derek stands in front of me, shielding me from his mother, who seems absolutely insane. The sting on my cheek and the tears I shed from the shock of being slapped for the first time in my life choke me. “You can’t just walk in here and hit my wife. Apologize!”

He demands of his mother, but she, in turn, wants to hit me again. What kind of family have I married into?

“Your wife is nothing but a gold-digging whore who married you for our fortune. I just heard from her own mouth what is an undeniable fact, and worst of all, you can’t divorce her for three years, or half of everything we have will belong to this nobody.”

I don’t understand anything. I didn’t say anything that this woman claims. Derek tries to pull his mother out, but she points to something I hadn’t noticed until now: small cameras in the corners of the room. What did I say that could have upset this woman so much?

“I know you don’t like me, Mrs. Johnson, but please don’t make up things or treat me this way. I’ve always treated you and your husband with respect.”

She lets out a cynical laugh and grabs her son’s arm.

# Chapter 3

“Don’t play the dignified with me. You’re nothing but a scheming slut.” She yanks her son out of the bedroom, and I follow behind them. “Look at him with your own eyes, son, and convince yourself, because your father and I were never wrong about her.”

The recording of my preparation in the room with Emilie before the wedding plays on her laptop, fast-forwarding the footage to when…

“You’re marrying their son, not them. Live your ‘happily ever after’ and forget about the rest. I don’t know why you hold back on important things. I bet that would shut a few mouths.”

“I already own a considerable fortune; getting married was all I wanted, and…”

“You’re not going to come to your senses, are you?”

They’ve just misunderstood everything, and I search for Derek’s gaze, which is fixed on the screen. I just want to explain that it’s not what it seems, but the cold, disappointed look he gives me makes me realize that he believes his mother, and no matter how hard I try to explain, he won’t give me the chance.

And I’m not wrong. He stands in front of me, gripping my chin tightly to lock his beautiful green eyes onto mine and says, “Three years. Just three years of absolute solitude and disdain, because you’re a damn lying opportunist, and I should never have married you. My mother was right all along, and all you’ve done is deceive me. I’ll make you regret it every single day.”

I can only cry as he leaves me alone with the witch who smiles at me with satisfaction.

“I’ll make your life a living hell until you divorce my son, you gold-digging bitch.”

I stay silent because I have faith that I can make him see reason. He’s my husband; we love each other, and we can’t let this end before we’ve even begun. It’s not fair. I deserve to be happy for once in my life with the man I chose.

“Good luck with that, Mrs. Johnson.” I leave her in her room when Derek’s father enters.

…

I return to the small apartment where I lived for many years in a taxi and unpack my bedding. I cry for the injustice, for Derek not giving me the chance to explain that he misunderstood everything, and for the emptiness I feel in my heart. I call Emilie to come over and tell her what happened, then hang up.

Minutes later, she arrives with a bottle of tequila and a gloomy spirit.

“It’s your fault for not telling him who you are, honey.” Emilie hugs me once she’s inside, and we cry together. “Why didn’t you spit that out at that damn witch when she hit you like that?”

I was planning to tell Derek the truth after our honeymoon. But now it’s not worth it; he believes his mother, and that shows me that his love isn’t as strong as I thought. Now I’ll try to talk to him and make him understand that I’m not interested in his damn money.

“For what? Wasn’t he supposed to love me? Believing misinterpreted words without giving me the chance to explain?” No, I’ll show him he’s wrong, and if our marriage comes to an end, I’ll let him know so he can feel the pain I’m feeling right now and understand what it’s like to have your words misinterpreted.

My best friend doesn’t say anything more, agreeing with me as we silently drink the bottle.

Three years later. I’m still working in my bakery here, and I’ve expanded to other cities, just like the Moores. I live in a huge mansion with all the luxuries the Johnson family is accustomed to, but I’m alone even though we live under the same roof. Derek hasn’t given me the chance to explain, and his mother spends more time at my house than at hers, sabotaging every moment Derek and I have alone to talk.

I set the table, waiting for my husband. Today is our third anniversary, and I prepared his favorite dish, hoping we can finally sit down and talk for the first time since his mother isn’t here to meddle. This afternoon, the moment I didn’t want to arrive is at hand, but it’s ready just in case I can’t get him to listen.

It’s six o'clock, and he still hasn’t arrived. My heart bleeds sadly because if he hasn’t come home yet, it’s because his mother found a new excuse to keep her son with her. She has invented fainting spells and headaches on our anniversaries, and today I don’t know what she’s come up with. The miserable woman is innovative in these manipulation tactics.

I have dinner alone by candlelight, feeling broken and pathetic, and at ten o’clock, I hear the keys jingle on the entryway table.

“I thought you weren’t coming back; that’s a new one.” I don’t even know why I’m complaining since he’ll go up the stairs and lock himself in his room anyway. “Can we talk?”

He shakes his head; literally, we haven’t had a conversation of more than two minutes in these three years.

“I can’t; I have to go.” God, I love this man so much, and having this love hurt me and destroy my dignity is tearing me apart.

Tears begin to gather, and the knot in my throat tightens.

“Don’t leave; not today, Derek. I’ve been waiting for you for hours with dinner, and I prepared your favorite dish. We need to talk, honey. How much longer do I have to beg you? Don’t you understand that I love you and just want to be by your side? Today is a special day.”

I’m met with the ultimate brush-off. AGAIN.

He smiles, shaking his head, and leaves me alone as he climbs the stairs. He comes back down a few minutes later, leaving behind his tailored suit. He’ll go out again and leave me here alone with the dagger in my chest. He doesn’t look at me and keeps walking toward the exit, but I say the words I have trapped in my throat before he crosses the door.

“Today is our third anniversary, you know? I’ve lived here alone the first year, you barely showed up the second, and this last one, you’ve done nothing but ignore me as if I don’t exist, denying me the chance to explain how things went on our wedding day. We need to fix our marriage before we take any measures.” I try to make my voice sound firm so he hears what I have to say.

He laughs in my face and pulls out his phone, tapping on the screen, and at the same moment, as he puts it away in his jeans pocket, a notification comes through on mine.

The transfer of fifty thousand dollars to my bank account from my husband sinks another dagger into this stupid heart that wants nothing more than to love him.

“Why are you giving me money I don’t need?” I ask, my voice breaking.

He turns and faces me, visibly irritated.

“What? Wasn’t it for my money that you married me, to be the owner of a great fortune? Leave me alone, Samantha; I don’t want to talk to you about anything, especially today, because this date is a reminder of how much I was wrong about you.”

“Don’t you get it?” I sigh with a shattered soul. “Go after your mother, but keep these words in mind when I tell you that I never married you for your money.”

My tears fall uncontrollably, ruining the makeup I painstakingly applied to look prettier, all in vain. Because he turns away again and storms out, slamming the door behind him, leaving me stunned and resigned at the same time.

# Chapter 4

Divorce

Derek arrives in the early morning, drunk, and for the first time in years, he shares the bed with me. I know it’s not right, but I needed this so much that I let myself go, even knowing it would be the last time I’d be in the arms of the only man I’ve ever loved. I cherish every kiss and caress from the man I’m hopelessly in love with until he falls asleep, holding me from behind.

I haven’t been able to sleep since he arrived, wanting to enjoy this moment before he wakes up and yells at me like he always does after a binge. However, I give him one last kiss on the lips and tell him once more how much I love him, smoothing his blonde hair before silently leaving the bedroom to not wake him.

I go to the guest room as dawn breaks and take a long shower. It’s seven in the morning, and I call Thomas Davis, my lawyer since my father’s death, asking him to come represent me. It’s only a matter of hours before this is all over, ending a marriage to which I clung with all my might, wasting three years of my life on someone who showed me day after day that I meant nothing to him, that he didn’t love me.

While he sleeps, I gather my belongings and take them down for when the time comes to leave.

At eleven in the morning, Thomas arrives, and I invite him to the dining room for a cup of coffee while I wait for Derek to come down for breakfast. As if on cue, his mother walks in through the front door, acting as if she owns the place, with a smile on her face and her lawyer following behind her.

“Your three years are up, you gold-digging bitch. Where’s my son?”

I nod; it’s true, I won’t have to endure her anymore, and Thomas raises an eyebrow at the way she addresses me.

“Upstairs, sleeping in my room since he came home drunk, and I had to sleep in the guest room.”

“At least you had the decency to let him rest away from your greedy claws.” The disgust and hatred she expresses are nothing new to me since I married her beloved son.

She heads upstairs to find her son, and the woman I know as the Johnson family’s lawyer stands awkwardly, clearly uncomfortable with the situation. I offer her a seat and a cup of coffee.

“I don’t know if you remember me, but I was the one who drafted the prenuptial agreement for your wedding at the Johnson family's request.” She pulls out a folder and documents from her elegant leather briefcase that I also have from my lawyer, who remains serious and silent, studying everything since the women arrived. “According to the agreement, you’re entitled to part of the Johnson fortune and…”

“I don’t want anything that comes from this family. We’ll talk when Derek comes down and signs my documents; yours don’t interest me.”

Margaret takes her time coming down with her son, and the minutes tick by, making the lawyers uncomfortable. Almost an hour later, Derek finally comes down the stairs, freshly showered and nursing a hangover, alongside his mother, who still wears a smile on her surgically altered face.

“Alright. I don’t know who this is,” she points rudely at Thomas, “but our lawyer and I have the divorce papers ready. We’re going to throw a big party after this, you bitch! You’ll walk away with several million, but getting my son away from you is worth every damn cent.”

Derek doesn’t say anything and sits at the table, looking at the man next to me, who pulls out the copy of the documents he prepared for me, which I read yesterday when they arrived in my inbox.

I laugh to keep from crying as I listen to the lawyer read the documents while Derek stares into space and I’m left with a broken heart. He hands the documents to my husband, who signs them, stabbing me with yet another pain, and when it’s my turn to sign, I tear up the papers, shocking my mother-in-law and surprising the lawyer. “Shove your ten million wherever you like! I don’t need anything from this pretentious old hag, with no manners or education. If my father had known her before he died, he would’ve surely disinherited me for ending up in such a lowly and undistinguished family.”

Margaret goes berserk, jumps up from her seat, and, just like three years ago, she slaps me again, only this time her son doesn’t say anything. I don’t even think he notices what’s happening.

“How dare you tear up the documents! Do you want more money?” I rub my cheek and look into Derek’s green eyes, which have been my light since I first saw them. “We’ll file the lawsuit again because in my son’s life, you’re nothing more than a nobody after our family’s fortune.”

Fortune, says the woman who smells like cows.

Derek grabs his mother’s arm and forces her to sit when he sees she’s about to hit me again, and I shake my head, pleading with my lawyer with my eyes to intervene.

“If we’re done with the drama…” My lawyer stands, still astonished by my mother-in-law’s behavior. “My client has been expecting this for months, and anticipating your maneuver, she called me to represent her today, fortunately confirming her suspicions. Since you came with your lawyer, unannounced, and with documents that my client isn’t interested in. The question is, Mr. Johnson—” This time he looks at Derek. “—who is married to my client, you or your mother?”

He says nothing, and his cheeks flush crimson.

“Don’t get upset, just read the documents and have him sign them so I can get out of here and never come back.”

He nods and begins reading the documents.

“We are here to formalize the divorce between Mrs. Samantha Moore Williams and Mr. Derek Johnson Price, who have decided to end their three-year marriage. Under the agreed terms, my client, Mrs. Moore Williams, has voluntarily waived any financial compensation and the division of properties.”

My lawyer pauses, allowing his words to sink into the silence of the dining room, chilling the woman who has despised me for years and surprising my husband.

My lawyer continues reading.

“The agreement my client presents states that Mrs. Moore Williams will not receive the originally agreed-upon sum of money, nor will she claim rights over the properties shared during the marriage, and she is not interested in her husband’s earnings, as she has not used a single dollar of the Johnson fortune since they married, supporting herself with the income from the branches in my client’s name here, in New York, Dallas, Austin, New Orleans, and Chicago. She willingly cedes these to her ex-husband to further expand his fortune.”

I smile sadly; if Margaret knew how much money I have, she would be begging me on her knees not to leave her son. That’s one of the reasons I never told them the truth about my identity and never spoke of my family.

“If both parties agree with what has been expressed here, they may proceed to sign the pertinent documents and conclude the divorce proceedings for Mrs. Moore against Mr. Johnson. Are you in agreement?”

I nod, and he shakes his head.

“Sign the documents; it’s his problem if he wants to remain in poverty out of pride.” Margaret insists to her son. “Sign the damn documents!”

She screams like a primitive, tearing off the last shred of civility she pretended to have. I let out a weak smile and scrawl my signature on each dotted line with my name, extending them to Derek for him to sign.

# Chapter 5

She screams like a primitive, tearing off the last shred of civility she pretended to have. I let out a weak smile and scrawl my signature on each dotted line with my name, extending them to Derek for him to sign.

“I don’t understand why you’re doing this; I won’t leave you with nothing. You worked hard to earn your bakeries, and it’s not fair…”

“Let her leave with nothing! She deserves it for being a gold digger who tricked you into taking what’s ours.” The woman I detest interjects in our conversation, snatching the check from her son’s hand. “Just get her out of here already.”

The scorching midday sun burns my skin, and as I turn to wait for my ride on the street, Derek grabs my hand and pulls another check from his pocket.

“Please accept it.”

He hands me a paper with the amount written as twenty million dollars and ignores the insults his mother throws at me.

I tear up the check and throw the pieces at Margaret Johnson’s face.

“I never married you for money, Derek. Don’t you get it?” I let tears fall that I didn’t want to shed, and at that moment, three armored black trucks arrive at the property, and ten men get out of the vehicles. Two of them approach and nod respectfully to me. They take my luggage and load it into the back of the truck. Mother and son don’t understand what’s happening. “Three years ago, I told Emilie I had a fortune, and all I wanted was to marry you, but I was referring to my fortune, not yours or your family’s, yet you never let me explain.”

My lawyer bursts out laughing, unable to contain his delight at the bitter pill I’m making Margaret and my ex-husband swallow.

“You never gave me the chance to explain anything, and for three years, you abandoned me in this luxury mansion, showing me that you never really loved me and that your mother’s word always carried more weight than mine. Now you’re free from me, and I hope my bakeries serve to increase the Johnson fortune that your mother so fiercely protects.”

I turn my back to walk toward the middle truck, where my lawyer is already waiting, and one of my men extends his hand to help me in. Derek runs toward me, and before I can close the door, he opens it.

“Who are you, Samantha?”

I smile, trying not to show him the pain my heart feels in this moment.

“I’m just a rich girl who came from New York six years ago to this town hoping to be happy, and I was until we got married, but the last three years have been filled with misery and humiliation.”

“You’re not answering.” Incredible, now he wants answers.

“I’m surprised that being the businessman you are, you haven’t connected my last names to the multinational Moore and Williams companies. On my father’s side, and the Williams businesses on my mother’s side, worldwide. Goodbye, Derek. I hope you and your mother are very happy. Twenty million thanks, ex-husband.”

I say the last part out of spite, as the sum Derek wanted to give me is nothing more than crumbs, minuscule compared to the vast fortune I possess, and they could never acquire even in ten lifetimes selling cattle. I close the door in his face, convincing myself that it’s the best for both of us, even if it hurts, and we leave this town never to return again.

Two Months Later

I’m rushed to the emergency room accompanied by my assistant due to fainting in the middle of a meeting. I undergo a general check-up and await the results, already feeling much better.

I blame myself for not eating properly and for the excessive work, travel, and all the responsibilities I took on when I set foot in London. I settled in my mother’s old mansion, the one I inherited from her, along with the twenty-two companies of the defunct Williams family and their billions, not to mention my father’s.

“Mrs. Moore.” The doctor enters with an envelope in hand and a smile on her lips. “I have your results.”

“Can you just tell me what’s wrong so I can get back to my work?” I ask, annoyed at being stuck here for so long.

“You are approximately eight weeks pregnant, Mrs. Moore. Congratulations.”

I’m going to have a baby with the man I love, the one who broke my heart.

Pregnancy

The first three words she says freeze me in my seat, and Barbara, my assistant, tries to touch me, but I immediately react by slapping her hand away.

I don’t want to be touched; I’m not ready to be a mother, and I don’t have time for this right now. I still have months ahead to get things in order with the companies. I divorced two months ago and… I’m going to have this baby.

""Are you okay?"" The doctor’s voice brings me back. ""By the look on your face, I see you weren’t expecting this news. Should I call your husband to pick you up if you’re not feeling well?""

Of course I’m not prepared! I just got divorced!

""I can leave by myself, don’t be ridiculous. So, can I go now?""

Anger gets the best of me as I stand up from my seat. Barbara does the same, staying silent.

""Yes, but you’ll need to come back in a few days to start your prenatal checkups and...""

I leave her talking to herself as I hurry down the hallway leading to the exit.

I can only think of one person—she’s the only one who can be with me right now.

I get into the car, and my assistant sits beside me, watching me. It seems like she wants to say something, but she hesitates. I haven’t been friendly at all. I arrived with a broken heart, frustrated, and hating the world for making everyone happy but me.

The driver closes the door, and we start moving.

""Take me home and then drop Barbara off at hers.""

That’s all I say, staring out the window, thinking about how the hell I’m going to raise a child on my own. If I tell Derek that we’re having a baby, he might accuse me of lying, of using some old trick to get him back. I humiliated myself for too many years, and I don’t want that for me or my little baby.

The driver parks at the mansion’s entrance, and I say goodbye to Barbara, who looks worse than I do, but...

""I know we’re not friends, but I don’t think you should stay alone. If you don’t mind my saying so, I could stay with you until someone from your family comes to take care of you.""

No one’s coming; they’re all dead.

""I’m sorry, I’ve been a bitch to you these past two months,"" I reply. ""But you don’t need to stay. I’ll see you tomorrow at the office.""

She nods, but she’s not happy with my answer. Still, the last thing I want right now is to spend time with a stranger. All I need is to think and call the only person capable of supporting me.

I promised myself I wouldn’t cry again, and here I am, in the shower for over an hour, crying like a little girl. I should feel happy because being a mother was one of my biggest dreams, but I wanted to do it with him by my side, taking me to appointments, pampering me, rubbing my growing belly until our child was born. I didn’t want it to be like this, feeling miserable and alone.

I step out of the shower, and as I dry my body, I look at myself in the mirror—red nose, swollen eyes. I’m a mess.

I ask for dinner to be brought up, and I force myself to eat even though I’m not hungry.

“Well, little one. It’s just you and me now, and no missing anyone because Mommy doesn’t want to cry anymore. Got it? We have to act like the Moores we are so no one sees us as weak,” I say, my hands resting on my still-flat stomach. “For now, we’ll only tell Aunt Emilie you exist.”

I grab my phone. There’s a time difference between Texas and London, but I know she’ll answer no matter the hour. I haven’t heard from her since I left, so I suppose she’s mad at me for leaving like that without saying goodbye.

The phone rings several times, and I start to reconsider. I don’t need to burden anyone else with my problems. I hang up. But Emilie calls me back three seconds later.

“I guess if you’re calling this late, it’s because you can’t sleep out of guilt for not saying, ‘Goodbye, friend, I’ll miss you,’” her shrill voice makes me smile.

“Hello to you too. How eager are you to catch the first flight to London and take care of your pregnant friend?”

Silence. Several seconds pass, and I check the screen to see if the call was cut off, but no, she’s still there, just not saying anything.

“Did you faint or something? Emilie!”

“Sorry, it’s just... I think I didn’t hear that right. Did you say you’re...”

I let out a nasal laugh.

“You heard right, I’m pregnant. Are you coming, or am I going to go crazy here by myself?”

She sobs, and it instantly makes me tear up too.

“I’m taking Eliot’s private jet,” I hear her husband asking who she’s talking to. “Can you wait a second, Sam?”

She hangs up before I can respond, and I lie down, covering myself up to my head. Five minutes later, my best friend calls again, and I answer.

“Are you going to tell him?” It’s Eliot speaking now, and I go silent. “Don’t try to lie to me because I won’t believe a word you say.”

“No,” I reply firmly. “I’m not telling him anything. I don’t want more rejection or accusations from his family, so I hope, for the sake of our friendship, that you keep this a secret. Understood, Eliot?”

# Chapter 6

I arrive home with my excitement through the roof. I feel the thrill fill my chest, making it almost hard to breathe, as if I’ve been holding my breath for weeks. Without thinking, I head straight to the kitchen after sending Henry to pick up my friends. Carmen is already preparing dinner, moving with that calm she always has, which completely contrasts with the energy that’s got me practically bouncing on my feet. I go over to the counter, grab the ingredients for dessert, and get busy with every detail, making sure everything turns out perfectly. The smell of vanilla and caramel starts filling the air, mixing with the hint of spices Carmen’s using for dinner. I feel at home, in my own space, ready to enjoy this evening with those I love most.

When everything’s ready, I head up for a quick shower. The hot water relaxes my shoulders, but my mind keeps racing, already planning every moment of the night. I put on something comfortable, simple yet cozy, as if I’m getting ready for a long-anticipated hug. I can’t stay still, so as I come down the stairs, I’m pacing back and forth across the living room like a crazy person. I need to hug Emilie, to let out all this sadness pressing on my chest, to pour it all out until I can finally breathe again.

To pass the time, I grab my phone and text Klaus Bulgari with my home address. Soon after, I get the confirmation that it’s been received. And then, his response appears, direct and teasing:

""Have you stalked me already? Because I have, and I’m frustrated not to find anything about you on social media. You’re quite the mystery, Miss Moore.""

I smile like an idiot, feeling that thrill as I type back.

""I’ll see you tomorrow, Mr. Bulgari.""

I watch the two blue ticks appear, letting me know he’s seen it, and he doesn’t take long to respond:

""Will you agree to have dinner with me, or will I have to persuade you with my Greek charm?""

So that’s the accent I noticed this afternoon. It sounded different, his English had that particular touch.

""Depends,"" I reply, flirting a little without planning to.

""On what?"" Am I actually flirting over text? The idea makes me smile, amused.

""I’ll see you tomorrow. Good night.""

When I see that Henry has just parked at the front entrance, I slip my phone back into my pocket and head out to greet my friends. Just then, my phone vibrates once more in my hand.

""Alright, get ready to fall for me, because that’s my intention when I see you tomorrow. Have a good night, and dream of me.""

A laugh escapes me as I pocket my phone, barely able to hold it in. The moment I look up, a body collides with mine, and a pair of arms wraps around me tightly. I return the hug with the same intensity.

“Damn it, I missed you so much.” My eyes well up unwillingly. Emilie, I missed her so much these past two months that I don’t want to let her go.

“I missed you too, honey.” We pull apart just a moment to let Eliot into our hug, surrounding us with warmth and protection.

“Did you miss me too?” he asks with his usual playful smile, the one that makes me feel like everything’s going to be okay.

“Of course I did, I missed you both so much.” We stay like this, in that shared embrace, until I feel my friends’ hands drift to my belly. Eliot and Emilie rub it so tenderly that I get emotional again, and the tears come back.",1,1745328023.0,Hot_Romance_Stories,0,1.0,False

Hi, everyone from the channel. My name is Luís… well, I’d rather not reveal my full name. I’ve been a subscriber for a while, and today I decided to share a story that still gives me chills every time I think about it. I’m a registered nurse now and currently work at a private hospital that’s part of a big network in my city. But back in 2014, I was just a nursing technician. I had just finished my vocational course, full of hope, resume in hand, walking all over town, dropping off paper wherever I could—clinics, private hospitals, tiny corner offices.

When I got a call for a temporary position at Santa Efigênia Public Hospital, I almost cried. It was an emergency contract, nothing solid, but with the night shift bonus, it was enough to pay rent on the small room I shared with a friend, buy food, and hold out until something better came along.

I started on a Monday in May. They put me on the 11 PM to 7 AM shift—the dreaded overnight. I was what they called a support tech, the go-to guy for everything. I’d run from one floor to another with medications, adjust oxygen levels, help transfer patients, change IV bags, check vitals—I didn’t stop. The hospital was old, built with 70s concrete, but it was still standing thanks to a handful of professionals who worked miracles with what little they had.

The first few nights were exhausting, but uneventful. Nights in a hospital are long. You start recognizing the sounds: the beeping of heart monitors, the echo of footsteps on cold tile floors, the muffled snores of patients in the hall. Sometimes the silence is so loud it feels like it’s screaming. And like every old building, Santa Efigênia had its creepy spots—creaky doors, flickering lights, footsteps where no one’s walking. You just learn to ignore it. Comes with the job.

But since my first night, something bothered me: the annex.
Behind the main hospital, separated by a covered walkway, was a smaller building. A two-story annex that used to house the old men’s ward, some observation beds, and the old pharmacy. All of that is now on the hospital’s top floor. The annex had been shut down for about two years after a fire. No one went in there anymore. The gate was sealed with a thick chain and two heavy padlocks. The sign, already faded by rain and time, read: “ANNEX – CLOSED OFF.”

It was weird thinking that, in a public hospital where space is always tight, a whole wing had been abandoned for so long.
But even closed off, it never felt truly deactivated.
At night, especially after 3 AM, it was common to hear creaking noises from that side. The janitor said it was the concrete settling. But I’d passed by and heard something else: a bed being dragged, a nurse call bell going off—other sounds.

One night, as I walked in for another shift, I looked at the rusted iron door of the annex and got the strange feeling something was behind it. It gave me chills.
In the main ward, the system showed all beds—occupied, free, being cleaned, etc.
And that night, at exactly 3:13 AM, a new admission popped up:

João Elias de Almeida – Bed 313.
But our hospital didn’t have a bed 313. The last one was 309.

I deleted the name. Thought it was a system glitch.
But the next night, same time, it came back.
I took out my phone, snapped a photo of the screen, and went straight to the night supervisor. She looked at it and took a deep breath.

“Just let it go, Luís. It’s happened before.”

“What do you mean?”

“We’ve already filed reports with I.T.… they say it’s an old bug. A database issue. Sometimes it pulls data from wings that don’t exist anymore. Just an old echo in the system.”

“Do you know who João Elias de Almeida is?” I asked.

She looked at me. Took a while to answer.

“It’s a public hospital, kid... what do you think?”

The third time it happened, the intercom rang. It was the front desk extension. But the screen said: EXTENSION 313.

I answered. Silence. Then—labored breathing, like someone out of breath. I hung up immediately.

Next shift, while sipping weak coffee in the cafeteria, old Mr. Silvio—the night security guard—started talking to me. He caught me staring at the hospital floor plan on the tiled wall.

“You’re curious about the annex, huh?” he asked, straight to the point.

I nodded, a bit sheepishly. He sighed.

“That place caught fire one night two years ago. Started on the top floor, the men’s ward. They said it was an electrical short in one of the rooms, but no one really believes that. Two patients died. And the weird thing… was the condition of the bodies.”

Silvio looked down, as if reliving the moment. Then continued:

“I was here that night. One of the first on the scene when the alarm went off. The smell of smoke was intense. The fire had already taken most of the men’s ward. The extinguishers weren’t enough. Firefighters arrived quickly, managed to get almost everyone out. All but two patients.”

He paused, gripping his paper cup tightly.

“When the firefighters found the bodies… one of them was untouched. The bed was intact. No soot, no burns. Not even the sheet was scorched. But the smell… it was like burnt death. Like the fire had happened inside him.”

I tried to laugh, call it an urban legend, but I choked when I heard the name of the dead: João Elias de Almeida.

Silvio squinted, like he was watching the scene all over again. His cup trembled, spilling coffee over the sides. He didn’t even notice.

“I saw him,” he whispered, like afraid someone else might hear. “Not back then. Months later. Maybe five months after the fire.”

I sat up straighter, trying to act skeptical. But my skin was crawling.

“I was walking down the main hallway, coming back from X-ray. Another quiet night. Just the hum of the A/C. Then I saw someone walking slowly, his back to me. Wearing a hospital gown, thinning hair. Barefoot. Looked lost.”

Silvio looked sideways, like watching the hallway again.

“I called out. ‘Sir, are you okay?’ Nothing. He just kept walking. But the way he moved... it was weird, like his feet touched the floor but didn’t really step. Like he was gliding.”

“You followed him?” I asked.

He nodded.

“When I turned the corner, he was gone. But the floor was stained. Like someone had just come from a coal furnace. Footprints. And they ended in the middle of the hallway. Just stopped. And that smell—” he wrinkled his nose, “the same as during the fire. Smoke and burnt flesh.”

I stayed quiet, a bitter taste rising in my throat. Silvio set his cup down, like he’d said what he needed to.

One time, I saw it with my own eyes.
It was a night like any other. The system beeped. “BED 313” lit up on the screen. And I decided to go to the annex.

I left my station, walked down the cold corridor. Outside, the sky was clear, no wind. But the hall to the annex felt freezing.
The gate was ajar. The chain on the floor. No padlock.
I pushed it open slowly. The building was fully lit inside. Like it was working. Fluorescent lights buzzing. The hallways were clean, like freshly mopped. The smell… that old hospital smell.

The annex elevator was working. The panel lit up. I went up to the top floor.
The doors opened with a dry clack.

In the middle of the hallway stood a hospital bed with a sheet over it. I walked toward it. My whole body shook with each step.

On the ID tag, it read:
BED 313
The sheet moved. Like someone was breathing underneath it.

With a trembling hand, I pulled it off in one go.
No one there. But the mattress was sunken, like someone had been lying there.

Footprints on the floor led to the wall. And vanished.

I ran to the elevator. It wouldn’t move.
I was stuck there for almost ten minutes. The bed stood between me and the stairs. I didn’t dare cross.

When I finally made it down, I went straight to the main ward. Grabbed my stuff, turned in my badge, and quit right there, hands still shaking.
The supervisor didn’t even ask why. She just looked at me and nodded—like she already knew.

In the following days, I tried to forget. Told myself it was exhaustion, lack of sleep, the pressure of night shifts. But something kept bothering me, nagging in the back of my mind: what really happened in that hospital all those years ago?

I did some digging on my own. Looked through public archives and found an old newspaper article.
The fire at the hospital killed two men.
One of them was João Elias de Almeida.
The other… was Silvio da Costa.

I just stared at the screen for a few minutes. Same face. Even the badge was visible, pinned to the burned uniform in the photo. Same security outfit. Same tired eyes.

I had spent months talking to a ghost.
A dead man.

1k5620l,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1k5620l,R3BEL64 HD - Nintendo64 iOS Shortcuts to modify your N64 config file - Now available,"Two all new iOS shortcuts to take advantage of the new N64 update in Delta 1.7. Add these Shortcuts to your iOS device through these links here: [Download \[R3BEL64\] iOS Shortcut](https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/8255b63f57254043a22abde0cf4191e0) and [Download \[R3BEL HD-SKIN\] iOS Shortcut](https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/708aebe236834acca439ee090812d119) (R3BEL64 Shortcut NOT compatible with MacOS devices!)

**R3BEL64 SHORTCUT RELEASE NOTES:**  
This shortcut helps with eliminating those ugly black borders around some of the N64 Games by allowing you to easily apply preset overscan adjustments or apply your own custom Overscan settings for each Left, Right, Top, and Bottom sides of the game screen. With the option to change the upscale settings of the N64 game image.

* Choose from 3 Pre-Defined Overscan Presets ranging from slight cropping to heavy cropping.
* Apply your own custom overscan crop settings for each side of the game screen individually.
* Option to Revert to Delta Default settings at anytime.
* Apply R3BEL HI-RES upscaling preset that increases resolution to 1280x960, while also increasing edge sharpness, colors, motion smoothing and clarity. *(this does require a 1280x960 compatible skin)*
* Or choose just to apply a 2x Resolution setting modifying the game screen output from 640x480 up to 1280x960 *(this does require a 1280x960 compatible skin)*
* Use the R3BEL HD-SKIN shortcut to convert any N64 DeltaSkin file to 1280x960. (The default delta skins should automatically be compatible)
* You can **view some individual game overscan crop setting recommendations** in the [ReadMe File Here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1BqP5Svpzeb6cZ79zDy3N_dFplWWVhQgl/view?usp=share_link). Which you can access via the link in this post or view when running the R3BEL64 Shortcut.
* **NOTES:** 
   * The R3BEL64 shortcut will take a little bit more time to complete its process during the first time that it is run. 
   * At the end of the first run the shortcut saves 3 reference files in your shortcuts folder in iCloud Drive (you will be prompted to allow access to save these files). 
   * These files are used by the shortcut on every subsequent run there after. This speeds up the processing time significantly by not having to re-parse the config file, and also no longer requires you to navigate to the config file every time you run the shortcut.
   * Due to limitations, iOS Shortcuts are not able to automatically save the updated N64 config file in the Delta Config folder. So you will have to navigate to the config folder to save the file at the end of the shortcut process.
   * Make sure to close out the Delta Emulator App completely before making any changes. Otherwise Delta will overwrite your changes back to its current configuration settings that it currently has loaded.

**R3BEL HD-SKIN SHORTCUT RELEASE NOTES:**

* This iOS Shortcut allows you to select any N64 .deltaskin file and convert the screen resolution to 1280x960. 
* Once converted, it also modifies the skin “identifier” and skin ""Name"" and saves the file as a copy of the original. This way, when you install it in the Delta Emulator App, it does NOT overwrite the original skin file that has the 640x480 resolution. 
* To identify the new “HD” Skin in Delta settings, look for the \[R3BEL64 HD\] Tag in the skin name.

  
\*\*I have only tested these shortcuts on an iPhone 15 Pro Max and an iPad. \*\*

As always please feel free to leave your feedback in the comments, the good, the bad, and the ugly are all welcome. :)

---------------------------------------------------------


today i think i'm gonna go for a walk 

circle the block

abandon the flock

and maybe wander off alone to the docks

but first, toss a couple things in a pot

top ramen, chopped veg

top it off with an egg

then hatch a plot to move my legs

sippin' on some coffee while avoiding all of the dregs

my head devoid of all of the dread that often occupies the depths of my soul

and always wants me to apologize for everything beyond my control

but maybe the waves will teach me how to roll

like the rolling thunder, over, under every punch 

i wonder if for once, and for whatever's left of my worth 

with any time that i got left on this Earth 

i'll ever learn to turn sorrow to mirth 

tomorrow's the first day of the rest of my quest to quench my thirst for first place

but for today

i think i'll stay a little bit more local

say a little more and get a little bit more vocal 

more hopeful for open doors

relax a bit and play a few more open chords 

before scoping ocean shores

find a ride or die with ocean eyes 

go for a drive, with Billie Eilish or Childish to pass the time

well, everything beneath the bright blue sky

and everything the light touches is ours

from the seas to the clouds

we'll seize the breeze

until we're finally gone with the wind

higher and higher, till we can watch the world while it spins

and if the air begins to get too thin?

i got some real thick skin

we need repairs? i came prepared with a grin 

from freezing ear to ear

believe me, there's no reason to fear

nothing can touch us all the way up here 

well, Ear We Go

paving down the way to hold the weight of the flow 

so Vic can tell you what you already know

to slow it down a bit

that even if you're feeling like you're reeling on the ground a bit

to straighten up and readjust your crown a bit

be proud of it

though now you may be drownin' but

somehow you'll climb up out of it

and wonder why or how you ever doubted it

devout to your route, so sprout your roots

and shout your truth

to make it count through every ounce of your youth

so move around and get to bouncin' through the mountains

seeking out your magic fountain

or whatever endeavor could ever turn you off to the clout

and get you off the seat of your couch

and out of your house

spreading your word with the birds heading south for the cold

take a moment just for taking a stroll 

before the world decides today's the day it's taking its toll

and you're too old to borrow from the clock

full stop:

what would you do if you knew tomorrow you'd drop?

oh, snap!

i forgot about the pot of my food

i think i got a little lost in the mood 

that i tried so hard to set

but i won't ever have a single regret

i'm onto the next

booking, cooking, and looking like a chef on the

go big, but don't forget to go back home

between your roamin' 'round from Rome to Nova Scotia to Seoul

so dance in the sand 

or even roll around the snow

no matter what you wanna do

just don't forget to keep enjoying the show.

(and if all the world's a stage, 
when your curtains close,
wipe your brow and bow down low.)

I could feel my heart beating and pumping as if I just had an adrenaline surge of some sort, it just made it so hard to not do anything and move, yet I still tried to sleep.

In the end? I slept thirty minutes for my whole day, and there I am now, still wide awake, weirdest part? I still feel energized, but my mind feels so fuzzy, I also did start to have my chest hurting a bit a few hours ago

Some extra info ; I usually am the complete opposite, being always dead tired to the point that no matter how many hours I sleep (6-8 hours) I remain very mentally exhausted. I also am an 18 year old man with ADHD if that matters

i was on bumble and just casually swiping through. i got matched w a malay guy. he looked decent and he was a few years older than me(i was alr an adult atp so dont worry)
he texted me,seemed casual enough(this was my very first time on bumble)so i thought,hey he seems cool.(NOPE)
we met up like 3 weeks ltr.
went out for coffee,had lunch and he asked what is my ideal guy.
so i just told him i liked guys who were selfless,generous and respectful. i told him that looks were important but its not a deal breaker(ygwim?)anywho,he stopped me and asked,”wdym?”
i told him oh i mean like my ideal guy doesnt need to look a certain way,because if i see a future w him then looks dont really matter as much. 
he then proceeded to ask if races mattered.
this was when my alarm bells started playing like softly.
i told him no,doesnt matter at all.
he scoffed. and proceeded to say,”nah races matter “
i was confused for abit,and he filled in. 
“ like im a chinese guy,why should i marry a malay or indian?”

i was still abit confused so i still kept quiet.

“like you know indians always smell like curry,and malays are always so fucking lazy”

i just went huh?

he went on to say “chinese are the majority here,why should i date or marry a malay woman?”

so i said ok…thats up to you i guess but theres no reason to say those mean things,have you ever dated a malay/indian girl before?

he then went on to say”i’d rather sleep with my mother than go anywhere near one”

👁️👄👁️

i then asked him so what race do you think i am?

with confidence this mangkok said “you’re chinese right”

i started laughing. ok first off cus my name is nowhere NEAR a chinese name. its a very very basic malay/arab name. 

i said “nah bro, im not chinese. ive got a malay name and if that doesn’t convince you u can look at my full name”

i showed my ezlink card at the time.

bro looked at it and proceeded to splash his drink at me.😐

he said “YOU CATFISHED ME”

i was like no i didnt, i posted a photo that i took like a month ago and i still look the same whereas you dont. if anything u look completely different im starting to think you edited your pics

he got triggered and said “this is why i dont date malays! they lie and cheat you! and then they fuck around and act so high and mighty! no wonder you cant get married”

**When:** April 14–18, 2025

**Distance:** 5 51.5 km | +2464m | –2318m

**Conditions:** Mixed weather — a couple of beautiful sunny days and a couple of very wet ones. Wind was a constant presence throughout the trip. Nights were chilly (down to 2.5°C), while daytime temperatures ranged between 12°C and 22°C.

**Lighterpack:**[ https://www.packwizard.com/s/avLXITW](https://lighterpack.com/r/50hxyw)

**Useful Pre-Trip Information or Overview:** The Supramonte is a karstic mountain range, meaning water sources are scarce and unreliable. On some days, there may be only one accessible source—or none at all. Water availability is especially uncertain during summer or drought periods, which are quite common in this region. It’s essential to plan your route based on water, and always carry more than you think you’ll need.

The full traverse runs from Su Gologone to Arcu Correboi, but we adjusted our itinerary to align with public transportation and nearby bus stops.

**Photo Album:** [https://photos.app.goo.gl/i4gwDh4nFtZEnUNy6](https://photos.app.goo.gl/i4gwDh4nFtZEnUNy6)

**The Report:** 

**Day 1 from Oliena to Tuones** \- 4 km - 700m+: We arrived in Oliena in the late afternoon after a flight and a long bus ride. It was already raining, so we stayed in a hut at Tuones. The hut is clean and spacious—probably very popular in summer with locals doing BBQs around.

We climbed Monte Corrasi, the highest peak of the Supramonte, and crossed a variety of landscapes—from rocky summits to humid plains, and an ancient holm oak forest with trees over 1000 years old. We reached the old shepherd’s shelter “Cuile Ziu Raffaele”—roofless now, but perched beautifully between the mountains and a small plain.

**Day 3 from Cuile ziu Raffaele to Monte Novo San Giovanni** \- 17 km - 700m+ - 300m-: By far the toughest day—non-stop heavy rain. But it led us to a truly magical place. The small hut at Monte Novo San Giovanni sits atop a mountain that’s been considered sacred for over 6000 years. Nearby, Bronze Age graves are aligned to its peak. There’s a small fireplace in a separate structure, where we managed to dry our gear and ourselves.

**Day 4 from Monte Novo San Giovanni to Supramonte di Urzulei** \- 7 km - 130m+ - 450m-: Very windy but with clear skies. Yet again, the landscape changed completely: juniper and holm oak woods on limestone scree, followed by dense thickets of juniper, privet, and broom. We got surprised by a downpour and had to pitch the tent in a very exposed spot. Rough night.

**Day 5 from Supramonte di Urzulei to Urzulei -** 8 km - 180m+ - 600m-: Final day—sunny, warm, and absolutely beautiful. We walked across plateaus above Urzulei, where we met some local trail workers who kindly offered us coffee. Birds were singing all around. A peaceful, gentle finish to a wild adventure.

Throughout our relationship, I've felt constant pressure to be more romantic and outgoing, while struggling with my mental health and focusing on keeping us financially stable.

# First Breaking Point

Around the 4.5-year mark, I was completely burned out. Running my own business while managing mental and physical health issues had left me anxious, irritated, and low on energy, also I've gained a lot of weight and picked up some bad habits. Meanwhile, my girlfriend was feeling pressure mainly from people on her socials getting married, having babies and so on.

She began pushing me toward marriage, and I felt pressured into proposing during our vacation. After that came her friend's wedding, which I attended reluctantly. The bachelor party became my breaking point – I didn't know anyone, was bullied and made fun of for being weird, and the experience left me traumatized. I had a complete mental breakdown.

After returning home, I confided in her about experiencing a complete mental breakdown. I explained that I needed to heal and was considering checking into some kind of facility or spa for a week or two. Rather than showing concern, she became angry with me—not because I was struggling, but because I hadn't offered to bring her along.

That moment became the turning point. I realized it was time to end our relationship.

What followed were multiple exhausting conversations where I felt entirely misunderstood. Eventually, I made the difficult decision to move out while she was at work. I sold our apartment and despite having always been the one financially supporting us, provided her with enough money to secure her own mortgage. At that point, I simply needed space to rebuild myself, I just wanted everything to be over as soon as possible.

# The 6 Month Break

During our separation, I quit my job, focused on healing, and returned to hobbies I'd abandoned. Honestly was depressed and in a bad place, was even contemplating suicide. We both tried to date other people unsuccessfully. Eventually she started calling constantly until I gave in. About a year ago, we reconciled and moved in together again – she rented out her apartment and joined me in my new place.

# Where We Are Now

* My situation: I’ve been focusing on personal growth—getting out of my shell, returning to work, and starting to lose weight (the main reason for my low energy). I’ve also been prescribed new medication, quit alcohol, and eliminated other bad habits.
* Her situation: She's financially stable, living rent-free with me while earning income from her work and from renting her apartment. I bought her a new car last month, however seems that it made her happy and grateful for like 2 weeks. She's trying to quit bad habits and loose weight together with me, however it seems that it's taking a toll on her an she's taking it out on me.

Despite all things going well, apparently emotionally we're dealing with the exact same problems as before.

The core issue remains her need for constant affection. If there's even a short period without romantic attention – like going a week without sex – she starts nagging and we end up fighting. Nothing I do seems enough, even though I show love in my own ways: hugs, kisses, deep talks, bringing her coffee, helping with errands, maintaining her car, and paying for appointments. I even arranged for us to take three months off work so we could take a road trip together and work on improving ourselves. Everything seemed to be fine during the roadtrip but once we came back home, I didn't see any motivation from her to work on herself or improve herself. None of that seems to matter when she feels she hasn't received enough attention for a week or two. Everything seems to go through the window.

# Our Latest Fight

Yesterday exemplified our problem perfectly. After an exhausting weekend spent between visiting her and my parents, I needed just one day to recover, catch up on work, and prepare for the week ahead. I told her that like two times. Yet still, on my only day off, she pressured me to go out biking. I declined, and she went alone.

While she was out, a friend made a surprise visit, we talked for some time and he left. After my fiancee returned, I told her that my friend visited me, which made her visibly irritated so she poured herself a drink. We watched TV together, then went to lie down around 6pm. I was exhausted and saw my friend messaged me, so I started texting with him.

She became furious, threw a tantrum about ""all the attention"" I give to my friend. She said that I'm talking too much about him, and she deeply hates him. Then she stormed out to the living room where she eventually began frantically cleaning at 9pm. Feeling angry and overwhelmed, I left my own home for an hour just to get away so I could collect my thoughts and understand wtf just happened.

When I returned, I tried once again to explain my situation – that I was drained from the weekend, affected by my ADD medication which makes me less emotional, dealing with health issues, and simply not able to be the romantic, energetic partner she wants right now. I need to take care of myself before I can share energy and joy with her. But she didn't seem to understand, and instead criticized me for not buying flowers for our ""6th anniversary"" (which I don't even count as a full six years since we were apart for six months). In the end we just went to sleep.

Today instead of starting my week I can't even focus or work for that matter, I feel completely messed up. Only thing that I do know is that these kind of tantrums can't and shouldn't be happening anymore, especially if we are planning any kind of future.

# My Current Dilemma

I'm starting to understand that my girlfriend might be struggling with depression and low self-worth herself – her mother is extremely depressed, manipulative and insufferable, and sadly I see similar patterns in her behavior. She doesn't have real close friends, nor hobbies. Instead, she seems to prefer chasing endless adventures or social media as an escape, while criticizing me during the times when she's not getting enough validation from me. Though she's aware of this, I'm losing hope that she'll ever work on herself.

As painful as it is to admit, I'm seriously questioning whether she's emotionally stable enough for us to have a future together, even though we've been planning to get married in the next 6-10 months.

Fact is, I'm not going to build any feature with a person who keeps getting silently resentful and throws childish tantrums in order to victimize herself and frankly has needs that I'm not able to always meet. I don't even understand why she reached out to me during the break, if it was that bad in the first place. I mean she knew exactly what she was signing for. It's not like I'm not improving and not working on myself. I am, it's just that everything takes time.

Currently I'm thinking of moving out for a week or two and suggesting couple's therapy, but at this point I don't even know where to start or if it's even worth spending my time/energy or even savings for that matter at this point anymore. If she didn't understand me after all this time, what will few therapy sessions change?

If you've been in a similar situation, can you give some advices or tell how it ended for you?

TL;DR: After 5.5 years with my fiancée, I'm at my second breaking point because despite my efforts to improve myself and maintain our stability, she still demands constant affection and throws tantrums when she feels neglected. I'm questioning if she's emotionally stable enough for our future together, as her patterns of resentment and need for validation haven't changed even though I've been working on my mental health and personal growth.",1,1745327472.0,relationshipadvice,4,1.0,False

Every morning, I rely on my trusty Horavie K1100 Mini Single Serve Coffee Maker to kickstart the day, and it never disappoints. Its compact design is the first thing that caught my eye, fitting effortlessly into my rather cramped kitchen counter. At just 7.85"" deep, 4.33"" wide, and 9.45"" high, this little powerhouse is proof that good things come in small packages. Not only does it save space, but its sleek black matte metallic finish adds a modern and stylish touch. However, I must say, cleaning its exterior sometimes requires a little extra effort due to its matte surface. 

**Flexible Brewing Options**

Switching between K-pods and ground coffee is incredibly convenient for someone like me who enjoys options. On weekdays, I grab a quick K-pod brew, while weekends are reserved for grinding my favorite beans. Adjustable brew sizes ranging from 6 to 12 ounces ensure a perfect cup to suit changing moods. It’s delightful to have flexibility, but the 12-ounce max capacity can feel restrictive if you prefer larger coffee servings. Nevertheless, for its size, this machine delivers a fantastic cup every single time.  

[Check Horavie K1100 price on Amazon.](https://tastefulcoffee.com/p/b0dcjmfpdh/)

**Impressive Performance with Minimal Fuss**

I was genuinely surprised by how quickly this machine works. A piping hot cup is ready in just about two minutes—I’ve timed it during rushed mornings, and it feels like a lifesaver. The simplicity of a one-button operation combined with its fast-brewing technology means you spend less time fiddling with settings and more time savoring your freshly-made coffee. Still, the machine does tend to make a noticeable amount of noise during brewing. If you’re used to quieter appliances, it may take some getting used to.  

**Positives**

- Compact and modern design making it ideal for small spaces  
- Supports both K-pods and ground coffee for versatility  
- Quick brewing time of roughly two minutes  
- Easy one-button operation that’s beginner-friendly  

**Enhanced Safety and Maintenance Features**

The built-in descaling reminder with a red light indicator might just be my favorite feature—it nudges you to keep the coffee maker in top condition. Plus, the self-cleaning function activated by a two-second button press makes maintenance a breeze. I’ve used this feature after heavy coffee usage weeks to prevent clogs, and it’s genuinely effective. That said, the reliance on a descaling solution may not appeal to everyone, as it’s an added step. Nonetheless, this upkeep ensures an extended lifespan, so the trade-off is worth it in my book.

**Ideal for Different Environments**

What truly sets this coffee maker apart is its portability. I’ve taken it to the office, and I’ve even packed it for weekend getaways. Weighing only 2.2 pounds, it’s incredibly light and fits easily into a backpack. Whether in the comfort of home, a busy office setting, or even an RV during road trips, this machine adapts seamlessly. However, if you’re brewing for multiple people, you may find yourself refilling the water tank more often than you’d like.  

**Drawbacks**

- Not the quietest machine during brewing  
- Maximum brew size of 12 ounces may feel limiting for some  
- Requires descaling solution for cleaning  

**Alternative Offerings**

As someone who often analyzes and tests similar products, I found competitors like the Keurig K-Mini to be worthy rivals. The Keurig offers similarly compact designs and versatile brewing options, but it’s often priced higher without significantly additional features. In contrast, the Horavie coffee maker stands out with the built-in descaling reminder and self-cleaning option. On the flip side, certain options like the Ninja DualBrew Pro offer both single-serve and full-pot functionalities, though they are bulkier and less portable. 

**Cost-Effectiveness**

Considering the features packed into this small machine—ranging from dual coffee input types to automatic cleaning—it offers excellent value for its price point. It’s rare to find such functionality and convenience in a budget-friendly single-serve coffee maker. Admittedly, there are slightly cheaper options available, but they often compromise longevity or versatility. If you’re prioritizing quality and performance without breaking the bank, this coffee maker may just be your new coffee companion.

I hate to say this to those that have been doing this for years, but dealing with “volume” of incoming resumes is not an art nor science. This seems like a paper-pusher career path while you’re drinking coffee and mull-tasking to shop on Amazon simultaneously. 

I saw one woman (on our very favorite LinkedIn) who recruits for Amazon Web Services with her coffee mug portrait claiming how she worked on a Saturday to push out offers. Her point being AI won’t be able to replace this. 

It gets me to think, why do recruiters gloat so much about being paper-pusher? Collecting paychecks from companies to do what exactly, review resumes that recruiters have no idea what is to be accomplished from the position?

If recruiters have to be certified for their profession, please let me know. I am not aware of any standards they should be held accountable to. Is that even a thing for recruitment? If yes, then where’s the human touch to this profession?

1k55qj0,https://www.reddit.com/r/HustleAndFaith/comments/1k55qj0/faith_over_fear_overcoming_selfdoubt/,Faith Over Fear: Overcoming Self-Doubt,"Ah, fear and self-doubt—the sinister duo that sneaks up on every entrepreneur, like a cat on a laser pointer dot. You start out with high hopes, grand dreams, and a shiny business plan only to find yourself playing mental tug-of-war with that little voice whispering “What if you fail?” Over the years, I've danced with these shadows more times than I'd like to admit.

There was one particular instance that stands out—a moment that felt like standing at the edge of a cliff, looking down into the abyss of uncertainty. I was staring at a pitch presentation that needed to be ready an hour ago, and all I could think was, “Why did I ever think I could do this?” It felt as if a thick fog of self-doubt had rolled in, obscuring both the ground beneath me and the path ahead. Let me tell you, that fog can be brutal; it makes even the simplest decisions feel like climbing Everest in flip-flops.

But amidst that fear, there was a flicker of faith, a stubborn little light I had stashed away like a secret weapon. I remembered a verse that had always resonated with me, Philippians 4:13: “I can do all things through Christ who strengthens me.” In that moment, something clicked. It was as if God was nudging me, saying, “Hey, you’re not in this alone. You’ve got backup.”

So, I took a deep breath (or several) and reached out to my community—my friends, family, and fellow entrepreneurs. You know, the kind of people who challenge you to grow and lift you up when you’re feeling more like a wilted houseplant than a vibrant entrepreneur. We gathered around my messy living room table, sharing cups of coffee and laughter amid the serious business talk. They reminded me of my passions, my “why,” and they helped clear that fog, revealing a clearer path forward.

In those moments, I realized the power of vulnerability. I wasn’t just fighting my fear and self-doubt; I was letting others in. That’s when the magic started happening. I found courage in sharing my struggles—turns out we’re all fighting our own battles. By opening up, I not only received encouragement, but I felt an overwhelming sense of community support that reignited my drive.

Fast forward through several scrappy attempts, late nights, and a bit of grace, and I managed to turn that pitch around. I didn’t just survive that experience; I thrived. I learned that faith doesn’t always mean having all the answers or a rock-solid plan. Sometimes, it's about holding onto hope, leaning on your community, and stepping forward even when your knees are shaking.

So, to anyone grappling with those pesky inner critics, remember: fear and self-doubt might try to gatecrash your entrepreneurial journey, but faith and community can turn the tide. Polishing those dreams and taking them one step at a time—because with a little faith and a lot of support, you might just surprise yourself.",1,1745326907.0,HustleAndFaith,0,1.0,False

1. Forcing water into the intake valve with a syringe to maybe kickstart the pump.
2. Cleaning shower-head
3. Descaling mode (no water is being pulled for that to work)
4. Resetting the machine to default settings.
5. Shaking the machine to try to get the airlock out (but with love)

Introducing: The Backyard Office.
A small, sleek, insulated office pod that gets delivered or installed in someone’s backyard. It’s quiet, private, and separate from the chaos of the house — perfect for focus and productivity.

Here’s the business model:

Monthly rentals or lease-to-own options.

Fully equipped with Wi-Fi, power, lighting, and maybe even soundproofing.

Designed for remote workers, freelancers, students, or even content creators.

Could also work as a podcast booth, therapy space, or side hustle HQ.

You don’t need to build them from scratch — partner with prefab manufacturers, handle the delivery + setup, and offer subscription-style pricing with flexible plans.

It’s cheaper than renovating a house, more focused than a coffee shop, and more private than a coworking space.

And honestly? I feel like this could work in cities and suburbs.

# Nespresso Diavolitto 2025 Review: Is It *Really* the Strongest? (+ Best Alternatives)

Are you a Nespresso enthusiast on the hunt for the most intense espresso experience? Or perhaps you’re new to the world of Nespresso and trying to navigate the vast landscape of capsules, searching for that perfect, powerful start to your day? If so, you’ve come to the right place. in this in-depth review, we'll be diving deep into the Nespresso Diavolitto, exploring its flavor profile, intensity, and overall value. We’ll also compare it to other strong contenders in the Nespresso universe, providing you with the facts you need to make an informed decision. So, is the Nespresso Diavolitto *really* the strongest? Let’s find out.

[[Explore Top Rated nespresso diavolitto on Amazon.]](https://storeins.com/chefs-knife/?kw=nespresso diavolitto)
## Understanding the Nespresso Diavolitto: An Overview

The Nespresso Diavolitto is marketed as a high-intensity espresso capsule, promising a bold and powerful coffee experience. It's part of the VertuoLine, Nespresso's innovative system that brews larger cups of coffee in addition to customary espresso sizes. Energized by highly roasted Robusta and Brazilian Arabica coffee beans, the Diavolitto boasts an aroma that hints at oak wood and leather, balanced with a creamy texture. This combination is designed to deliver an intense, yet smooth, coffee experience.

many appreciate the convenience and quality that Nespresso offers, and for those who prioritize a rapid and consistent cup of coffee, the Diavolitto may seem like the ideal choice. But with so many options available, and with subjective elements like taste and aroma playing a key role, how does the Diavolitto truly stack up?

[[Explore Top Rated nespresso diavolitto on Amazon.]](https://storeins.com/chefs-knife/?kw=nespresso diavolitto)
## Decoding the Intensity: What Makes Diavolitto 'Strong'?

The term ""strong"" can be interpreted in various ways when it comes to coffee. Does it refer to the caffeine content, the boldness of the flavor, or the overall intensity of the experience? With the Nespresso Diavolitto, it's a combination of factors that contribute to its perceived strength.

*   **Roast Level:** The Diavolitto features highly roasted robusta and Arabica beans, a key component in achieving a more intense flavor profile. Dark roasts typically have a bolder, more smoky or bitter taste compared to lighter roasts. The high roast level aims to extract maximum flavor and create a robust cup of coffee.
*   **Bean Selection:** The blend of Robusta and Arabica beans also plays a significant role. Robusta beans generally contain more caffeine than Arabica beans and contribute to a bolder taste with earthy notes. Arabica beans, on the other hand, are known for their smoother, more aromatic qualities. The Diavolitto leverages a balance of both to deliver a potent yet palatable experience.
*   **Intensity Scale:** Nespresso uses an intensity scale to help consumers quickly gauge the strength of their capsules.The Diavolitto typically sits at an intensity level of 11 on a scale of 1 to 13 (depending on the specific line or retailer's presentation), placing it among the stronger offerings in the vertuoline range.

however, it's important to note that intensity is subjective.What one person perceives as strong, another might find perfectly acceptable. The perceived strength of the Nespresso Diavolitto also depends on individual tolerance to caffeine and personal preference for flavor profiles.

## diving Deeper: Flavor Profile and Aroma of the Diavolitto

Beyond the intensity, the Nespresso Diavolitto offers a distinct flavor profile that appeals to specific tastes. As mentioned earlier, the aroma hints at oak wood and leather, creating a sophisticated and intriguing sensory experience. These woody and leathery notes are not literal, of course, but rather evoke those sensations through the complex combination of roasted coffee compounds.

On the palate, the Diavolitto delivers a bold and robust flavor with subtle bitterness. Some reviewers describe it as having a slight smokiness, which is characteristic of dark roast coffees. The ""creamy texture"" mentioned in Nespresso's official description aims to balance the intensity, providing a smoother mouthfeel to temper the boldness of the flavor.

For those who enjoy a more nuanced and complex coffee experience, the Diavolitto might be a bit overwhelming. However, if you appreciate a straightforward, bold, and intense flavor with a hint of smoky-woody notes, this capsule could be a perfect match.

## Is the Nespresso Diavolitto Compatible with My Machine?

This is a crucial question, especially for new Nespresso customers.The Nespresso Diavolitto is specifically designed for the vertuoline machines. It is *not* compatible with the OriginalLine machines. The VertuoLine system uses larger capsules and a different brewing process (Centrifusion™ technology) than the OriginalLine,so the capsules are not interchangeable.

Before purchasing any Nespresso capsules, always double-check that they are compatible with your specific machine. Using the wrong type of capsule can damage your machine and void your warranty. If you own an OriginalLine machine and are looking for a strong espresso, you’ll need to explore options within the OriginalLine range, such as Ristretto or Kazaar.

## Where to Buy Diavolitto Nespresso Capsules and Price Considerations

Nespresso diavolitto capsules are readily available through a variety of channels, making it convenient to purchase them. Where to buy diavolitto Nespresso capsules includes:

*   **Nespresso boutiques and Website:** The most direct option is to purchase from Nespresso's official boutiques or their website. This ensures authenticity and allows you to explore the full range of Nespresso products.
*   **Online Retailers:** Major online retailers like Amazon, Walmart, and eBay also carry Nespresso capsules, including the Diavolitto. Comparing prices across different platforms is always a good practice.
*   **Department Stores and Grocery Stores:** Many department stores and grocery stores that sell Nespresso machines also stock a selection of capsules. Check the coffee aisle or the small appliance section.

The Nespresso Diavolitto price varies depending on the retailer and any ongoing promotions. Typically, a sleeve of 10 VertuoLine capsules costs between $12 and $15. Purchasing in bulk or subscribing to Nespresso's coffee plan can often result in cost savings. Be sure to keep an eye out for sales and special offers, especially around holidays and major shopping events.

## Nespresso Diavolitto Caffeine Content: What to expect

For many coffee drinkers,particularly those seeking a strong and energizing experience,caffeine content is a key consideration. Nespresso does not explicitly publish the exact caffeine content for each capsule, but the Diavolitto is known to be among the higher caffeine options due to its Robusta blend and dark roast.

While the precise number can vary slightly, expect the Nespresso Diavolitto caffeine content to be around 120-150mg per capsule. This is significantly more than the caffeine content in some of the milder Nespresso blends.

If you are sensitive to caffeine, it's advisable to consume the Diavolitto in moderation. If you are looking for a lower-caffeine alternative, consider exploring Nespresso's decaffeinated options or choosing a blend with a lower intensity rating.

## Nespresso Diavolitto Ingredients: What's Inside the Capsule?

Understanding the Nespresso Diavolitto ingredients is part of making an informed choice. Nespresso capsules typically contain only ground coffee beans. There are no added sugars, milk powders, or artificial flavorings. The flavor and aroma profiles are derived solely from the characteristics of the coffee beans and the roasting process.

In the case of the Diavolitto, the ingredients consist of a blend of highly roasted Robusta and brazilian Arabica coffee beans.The specific proportions of each bean type are proprietary to Nespresso, but the combination is carefully crafted to achieve the desired intensity and flavor profile.

This simplicity in ingredients is a significant advantage for those who prefer a pure and unadulterated coffee experience. It also caters to individuals with dietary restrictions or sensitivities to additives.

## Nespresso Strong Capsules: How Does Diavolitto Compare?

The Diavolitto is frequently enough touted as one of the strongest Nespresso capsules, but how does it compare to other contenders in the Nespresso lineup? To provide a thorough assessment, let's consider some alternatives:

*   **VertuoLine:**
    *   **intenso:** Another high-intensity option in the VertuoLine, Intenso offers a bold and powerful flavor with notes of roasted coffee and dark cocoa. it's frequently enough compared to Diavolitto, but with slightly different flavor nuances.
    *   **Stormio:** While not quite as intense as Diavolitto or Intenso, Stormio offers a full-bodied flavor with spicy and woody notes. It's a good option for those who prefer a strong coffee without being overwhelmed.
*   **OriginalLine:**
    *   **Ristretto:** Frequently enough considered one of the strongest options in the OriginalLine,Ristretto delivers a full-bodied,intensely roasted flavor with hints of chocolate. It is a popular alternative for those with OriginalLine machines.
    *   **Kazaar:** kazaar is known for its exceptionally high intensity and bold, bitter notes. It's a powerful espresso for those who crave a truly intense coffee experience.

Ultimately, the ""best"" strong Nespresso capsule depends on individual preferences. some prefer the smoky-woody notes of Diavolitto, while others might prefer the chocolatey notes of Ristretto or the bold bitterness of Kazaar. Experimenting with different options is the best way to discover your personal favorite.

## Nespresso diavolitto Alternative: Exploring Other Options

*   **For a smoother strong coffee:** Try Intenso (VertuoLine).
*   **For a chocolatey intense flavor:** try Ristretto (OriginalLine).
*   **For a more balanced cup:** Explore blends with an intensity rating of 8-10, such as Arpeggio (OriginalLine) or Odacio (VertuoLine).

## Discontinued Nespresso Diavolitto? Keeping an Eye on Availability

While the Nespresso Diavolitto is currently available, it's always a good idea to be aware of potential product changes. Nespresso occasionally discontinues certain capsules or introduces new ones.To stay informed about the availability of the Diavolitto, monitor the Nespresso website, check for updates from online retailers, and follow Nespresso news and announcements.

If the Diavolitto were to be discontinued, the alternatives mentioned earlier in this review would become even more valuable. Having a backup plan ensures you can continue to enjoy a similar coffee experience even if your favorite capsule is no longer available.

Throwaway account. I (37M) and my husband (39M) have been together 11 years. My husband owns a small bookshop and recently has hired a boy to help him.

This lad (I'll call him Joe) is gay and while me and my husband very obviously have no issue with this, Joe seems to do things a lot differently to us. For context both me and my husband are Irish immigrants to London. We grew up a 20 minutes away from each other and went to the same, very Catholic, school. We aren't exactly flamboyant or outwardly 'gay' and don't exactly do PDA since that's how we were raised.

On my lunch break from work I like to visit my husband bringing him records I think he might like and his coffee. Recently however Joe has started making comments. It started small with him saying things about 'queer joy' and how he loves gay couples which we didn't mind at all, in all fairness it's a fairly scary world for queer people right now and I understand seeing a happy married gay couple means a lot for a kid.

But then he started getting a little too comfortable for my liking. He started asking things like 'whose the top' and calling us the f slur jokingly. I think it's entirely inappropriate to be making those comments to his boss but my husband told me to let it go. Joe calls us the f slur a lot which I had brought up a few times telling him calmly to not do that but when he continued I learnt to let go despite my distaste for it since it didnt seem to bother my husband too much.

 but last Wednesday I lost it. I was up by the counter when Joe came in. He immediately started blathering on about how f---y we are and while my husband chuckled awkwardly, I did not. Joe noticed this and said I was a stick in the mud and repressed. I was trying to keep my cool until he called me 'a fenian f---t' and I lost it. For anyone who doesn't know the term 'Fenian' isn't exactly a slur or anything but it isn't exactly nice either. Me and my husband jokingly call each other fenians or paddy's from time to time if we've something particularly 'Irish' and I've never exactly viewed as a very offensive word to me but something about this English boy made me snap. I asked him if he thought that was an appropriate thing to say to his boss's partner and started shouting. Telling him he's way out of play and if he wants to keep his job he should buck up.

I left to cool down a bit and 30 minutes later got a call from my husband berating me saying that Joe was crying and that he's just a kid. I do feel really bad since he's only young but I still think he needed to be knocked down a step or two, am I the asshole?

Edit: I see a lot of people making comments about the nature of the relationship between Joe and my husband, my husband has asked Joe to stop on my behalf before but this isn't something that really bothers my husband and to be fair it's his workplace not mine.

**Top Comment**

NTA. The ‘kid’ is 19 and is old enough to know that saying harmful remarks in front of, let alone to address your boss is not the way to go. Should you have yelled, maybe not but I can’t say I would have done any better in your position.

Honestly, apologize to your husband for the scene you caused, mention that as long as the kid works there you won’t be going to the book shop for favors or otherwise as he makes you uncomfortable and after today you’re sure the kid would be uncomfortable as well, let him know if you’re willing to offer the kid an apology (I wouldn’t but maybe you’re a bigger person than I am), and let him know that you don’t want one from the kid as you find his behavior and language appealing and don’t want anything from him.

**Response (concerning apologising)**

Being young doesn’t mean you get to act however you want, especially at work. Joe crossed the line way too many times, even after being told to chill. Honestly, OP just set a boundary, and if Joe doesn’t learn now, he’s gonna keep doing the same stuff wherever he goes.

**Relevant comments**

What I want to know is *why* he feels so comfortable to talk like that in front of his boss and partner. That is language used by very close friends, who have a mutual understanding of each other's intentions. Something (or someone) has to be giving Joe the courage to continue this behavior despite repeatedly being told to stop.

 I'm not sure why your husband is allowing this kid to undermine you? And say these things when you've made it clear you're not comfortable with it. You need to have a discussion with him, a serious one. 

Yeah im ngl I think the husband has a thing for this ""kid"" who's 19 and saying things that the OP obviously dislikes. Who would let someone constantly do that to their SO gay or straight without some reasoning?

OOP: I’m not really ‘uncomfortable’ with their relationship per se but I do think that my husband lets Joe get away with these things and doesn’t really have my back in these kinds of situations. Hes a peacemaker by nature and while I love that about him it results in him letting things slide that I wouldn’t so then I’m made to be the bad guy

 

**Update Same Post**

Update: Joe is my husbands son. I won't go too much into the details for both my and their privacy but I had a major fight with my husband about why he was being so lenient with him and why we didn't have my back in this. We were shouting back and forth until he shouted something about 'blood being thicker than water' I shout back about him being just some boy and he stopped suddenly.

Then he told me. Joe is from an ex girlfriend of his whose now unable to take care of him so my husband picked up. He's been playing child support for years. We each have our separate bank account so I didn't even notice.

I'm contemplating separation and divorce. Someone I've known for 25 years became a stranger in 10 seconds. I physically got sick thinking back on those sexual remarks that he made to his FATHER. My husband always went white as a ghost when he said those kinds of things and that was possibly the only thung he actually gave out to him for but it makes me feel sick all the same

Sorry I won't be responding to comments I need to get my head right personally

Buying coffees and hobbies that I never really got into. drinking more than I ever had,

The last month I've cancelled prime and haven't made a amazon purchase. Not that I never will but clicking buy now was making it too easy.

Cutting out alcohol to none or very little

Far less coffee/fast food. I will still have the occasional coffee for social reasons.

cut a lot of processed and snack foods when shopping. no pop or chips.

Already seeing a huge savings. I used to not do many of these things but slowly seemed to form habits of buying these things.

Throughout our relationship, I've felt constant pressure to be more romantic and outgoing, while struggling with my mental health and focusing on keeping us financially stable.

# First Breaking Point

Around the 4.5-year mark, I was completely burned out. Running my own business while managing mental and physical health issues had left me anxious, irritated, and low on energy, also I've gained a lot of weight and picked up some bad habits. Meanwhile, my girlfriend was feeling pressure mainly from people on her socials getting married, having babies and so on.

She began pushing me toward marriage, and I felt pressured into proposing during our vacation. After that came her friend's wedding, which I attended reluctantly. The bachelor party became my breaking point – I didn't know anyone, was bullied and made fun of for being weird, and the experience left me traumatized. I had a complete mental breakdown.

After returning home, I confided in her about experiencing a complete mental breakdown. I explained that I needed to heal and was considering checking into some kind of facility or spa for a week or two. Rather than showing concern, she became angry with me—not because I was struggling, but because I hadn't offered to bring her along.

That moment became the turning point. I realized it was time to end our relationship.

What followed were multiple exhausting conversations where I felt entirely misunderstood. Eventually, I made the difficult decision to move out while she was at work. I sold our apartment and despite having always been the one financially supporting us, provided her with enough money to secure her own mortgage. At that point, I simply needed space to rebuild myself, I just wanted everything to be over as soon as possible.

# The 6 Month Break

During our separation, I quit my job, focused on healing, and returned to hobbies I'd abandoned. Honestly was depressed and in a bad place, was even contemplating suicide. We both tried to date other people unsuccessfully. Eventually she started calling constantly until I gave in. About a year ago, we reconciled and moved in together again – she rented out her apartment and joined me in my new place.

# Where We Are Now

* **My situation:** I’ve been focusing on personal growth—getting out of my shell, returning to work, and starting to lose weight (the main reason for my low energy). I’ve also been prescribed new medication, quit alcohol, and eliminated other bad habits.
* **Her situation:** She's financially stable, living rent-free with me while earning income from her work and from renting her apartment. I bought her a new car last month, however seems that it made her happy and grateful for like 2 weeks. She's trying to quit bad habits and loose weight together with me, however it seems that it's taking a toll on her an she's taking it out on me.

Despite all things going well, apparently emotionally we're dealing with the exact same problems as before.

The core issue remains her need for constant affection. If there's even a short period without romantic attention – like going a week without sex – she starts nagging and we end up fighting. Nothing I do seems enough, even though I show love in my own ways: hugs, kisses, deep talks, bringing her coffee, helping with errands, maintaining her car, and paying for appointments. I even arranged for us to take three months off work so we could take a road trip together and work on improving ourselves. Everything seemed to be fine during the roadtrip but once we came back home, I didn't see any motivation from her to work on herself or improve herself. None of that seems to matter when she feels she hasn't received enough attention for a week or two. Everything seems to go through the window.

# Our Latest Fight

Yesterday exemplified our problem perfectly. After an exhausting weekend spent between visiting her and my parents, I needed just one day to recover, catch up on work, and prepare for the week ahead. I told her that like two times. Yet still, on my only day off, she pressured me to go out biking. I declined, and she went alone.

While she was out, a friend made a surprise visit, we talked for some time and he left. After my fiancee returned, I told her that my friend visited me, which made her visibly irritated so she poured herself a drink. We watched TV together, then went to lie down around 6pm. I was exhausted and saw my friend messaged me, so I started texting with him.

She became furious, threw a tantrum about ""all the attention"" I give to my friend. She said that I'm talking too much about him, and she deeply hates him. Then she stormed out to the living room where she eventually began frantically cleaning at 9pm. Feeling angry and overwhelmed, I left my own home for an hour just to get away so I could collect my thoughts and understand wtf just happened.

When I returned, I tried once again to explain my situation – that I was drained from the weekend, affected by my ADD medication which makes me less emotional, dealing with health issues, and simply not able to be the romantic, energetic partner she wants right now. I need to take care of myself before I can share energy and joy with her. But she didn't seem to understand, and instead criticized me for not buying flowers for our ""6th anniversary"" (which I don't even count as a full six years since we were apart for six months). In the end we just went to sleep.

Today instead of starting my week I can't even focus or work for that matter, I feel completely messed up. Only thing that I do know is that these kind of tantrums can't and shouldn't be happening anymore, especially if we are planning any kind of future.

# My Current Dilemma

I'm starting to understand that my girlfriend might be struggling with depression and low self-worth herself – her mother is extremely depressed, manipulative and insufferable, and sadly I see similar patterns in her behavior. She doesn't have real close friends, nor hobbies. Instead, she seems to prefer chasing endless adventures or social media as an escape, while criticizing me during the times when she's not getting enough validation from me. Though she's aware of this, I'm losing hope that she'll ever work on herself.

As painful as it is to admit, I'm seriously questioning whether she's emotionally stable enough for us to have a future together, even though we've been planning to get married in the next 6-10 months.

Fact is, I'm not going to build any feature with a person who keeps getting silently resentful and throws childish tantrums in order to victimize herself and frankly has needs that I'm not able to always meet. I don't even understand why she reached out to me during the break, if it was that bad in the first place. I mean she knew exactly what she was signing for. It's not like I'm not improving and not working on myself. I am, it's just that everything takes time.

Currently I'm thinking of moving out for a week or two and suggesting couple's therapy, but at this point I don't even know where to start or if it's even worth spending my time/energy or even savings for that matter at this point anymore. If she didn't understand me after all this time, what will few therapy sessions change?

If you've been in a similar situation, can you give some advices or tell how it ended for you?

TL;DR: After 5.5 years with my fiancée, I'm at my second breaking point because despite my efforts to improve myself and maintain our stability, she still demands constant affection and throws tantrums when she feels neglected. I'm questioning if she's emotionally stable enough for our future together, as her patterns of resentment and need for validation haven't changed even though I've been working on my mental health and personal growth.",1,1745325905.0,offmychest,0,1.0,False

1k55czr,https://www.reddit.com/r/Jung/comments/1k55czr/red_riding_hood_why_modern_man_is_tricked_by_the/,Red Riding Hood: Why Modern Man is Tricked by the Wolf,"[Now with a fully rewritten concluding section elucidating why modern man is succeptible to deception.]

I see people have shared various takes on the meaning of the classic *Red Riding Hood* tale in this community. This inspired me to reflect on the symbolism and to dig deep and I arrived at a resonant interpretation that I wanted to share.

We'll consider the symbolism of the devouring jaws of the wolf, and his uncanny night gaze. We'll look into the symbolism of trickery and even touch on the meaning of the sorcerer and the wizard. And we'll review insights from von Franz regarding how we can avoid getting trapped in the jaws of the wolf.

# A Quick Recap of the Tale

Let's start with a quick synopsis of the story, as it is a bit more nuanced than we may remember when hearing it as children. This synopsis is from a
[webpage](https://www.colorado.edu/projects/fairy-tales/old-french-fairy-tales/little-red-riding-hood)
maintained by the University of Colorado Boulder.

Red Riding-Hood’s mother asks her to go to her grandmother’s with cakes and butter. She must travel through the woods to get there and while on her way she meets a wolf. The wolf has the desire to eat her but is wary of the woodcutters nearby, so he asks Riding-Hood where she is going. She gives him the details of her grandmother’s house and they part ways. The wolf runs and takes the short route while Red Riding-Hood takes the long route to the house. The wolf arrives at the grandmother’s house first and pretends to be Red Riding-Hood. The grandmother falls for this trick and is eaten in one gulp by the wolf. Later Red Riding-Hood arrives to give her grandmother the gifts and the wolf now dressed as her grandmother lets her in. Red Riding-Hood comments on her grandmother’s big ears, nose, and teeth before she also is eaten by the wolf.

# The Jaws and Penetrating Vision of the Wolf

The wolf has a variety of meanings in symbolism, but many of these relate to the jaws. Jaws symbolize devouring (drawing upon Cirlot and Chevalier). Sometimes this means literal destruction. But often, devouring will instead symbolize the first part of the cycle of transformation. ""Out with the old, in with the new."" We often have to discard an old way of being that wasn't serving us well. This clears the slate so a new way of being that serves us better can take toot. In cases like this, we aren't truly destroyed. Only the part of us that is no longer beneficial perishes, and this makes way for new growth and development.

The large ears and nose of the wolf are emphasized at the end of the tale. And this brings us to another important aspect of wolf symbolism. Wolves have eyes that look pretty otherworldly at night (also drawing upon Cirlot and Chevalier). They seem to really peer at you like they know all your secrets. They can see in the dark. It's almost like they can gaze into our shadows and see everything we want to keep to ourselves. Here, the large ears and nose similarly refer to the wolf's keen perception and his ability to take in information that would seem faint or hidden to the rest of us.

Thus, like the hound, the wolf has an almost uncanny ability to sniff things out. As a psychological allegory, the wolf thus symbolizes someone's ability to reach hidden conclusions that would be too faint or obscure for many of us to bring into conscious awareness. The wolf can thus symbolize someone who is very perceptive, who has a great capability to see what would usually be hidden.

# The Wolf and the Con Man

There is a moral question facing the wolf, that is a person with eagle-eyed perception. When they realize all sorts of things that would be hidden to most, will they use this powerful knowledge for good or for evil?

In ancient times, this was viewed as the difference between a wizard and a sorcerer. The wizard would use his knowledge of arcana, that is hidden wisdom, for socially beneficial purposes. The sorcerer would instead use his knowledge of hidden wisdom to do whatever most benefited himself at the expense of everyone else. (This again draws on Cirlot and Chevalier.)

In this tale, the wolf is someone akin to a trickster or con man. The con man uses his heightened perception to analyze his mark for weaknesses, which he then exploits to his self-benefit and their expense. This is akin to the path of the sorcerer rather than the wizard. The con man uses his ability to see the hidden and the secret wisdom he gleams to socially harmful rather than beneficial ends.

Our wolf indeed loves to plot and scheme. He is careful to wait to enjoy his feast (the yield of his scam) until Red Riding Hood (RRH) is at her grandmother's house. He wants to escape detection by the nearby woodcutters. And he craftily fishes out RRH's destination from her so he will know where he will make his strike. And of course, once he disposes of her grandmother, he uses the disguise of her appearance to further deceive RRH and pull off his scheme.

# Entering the Shadows of the Woods

RRH seems to have not yet developed an understanding of the full spectrum of the human experience. She seems rather unaware of its darker aspects. Thus she really had no business taking a casual stroll through the less tamed realm of the forest.

The forest was usually viewed in times past as a dangerous, chaotic place. There was a greater prevalence of wolves or bears in previous eras. It was often seen as the opposite of civilization, the realm of beast rather than that of mankind.

Yey, here we have RRH casually walking through it as if it's just  a harmless walk down the street to see Grandma. She's even carrying desirable goods (cakes and butter) that will make her a target to the unsavory presences that were historically seen as dwelling in the rough and untamed woods.

She is also hooded. Cloaking relates to shrouding or obscuring things from vision. Her hood further symbolizes that there are still important things for her to learn that are still hidden from her. She still has much to learn about the darker parts of humanity.

Sadly, RRH demonstrates in her ill-advised stroll that she is the ideal mark for our wolf.

# Devoured by the Wolf 

Since devouring can symbolize either literal death or transformation, the fate of our young friend is somewhat open to interpretation. The tale is really intended to give us a cautionary note about what is likely to happen when someone like RRH who is still rather innocent in the ways of the world heads into the savage domain of the wolf. (The ancient Greek story of Adonis is strikingly similar.)

Symbolism is generally less interested in the particulars of what happened to a character. It's more a vehicle to let us learn about the human experience.

Thus, it's quite ambiguous exactly how much of RRH perishes. Devouring could mean the end of her current way of being. That the experience will have a sort of shock factor that causes her to learn more about the darker parts of the world. And thus that such learning will transform her into someone more discerning, the rise of a new way of being.

Or it could simply mean death. A brutal end that would really imprint the story in our collective mythos and hopefully motivate us to learn from RRH's fate.

# Avoiding the Clutches of the Wolf

In *The Golden Ass of Apuleius*, von Franz noted how modern man seems to have lost some of his instinctual ability to 'sniff out' trouble. This is because we have lost our appreciation of intuition and our capability to use it. (Another Redditor first realized that this tale relates to a loss of intuition, as noted in the acknowledgements section below. I built upon this considerably by figuring out *how* these are related.)

When we don't use intuition correctly, there is an outpouring of useless ideas or muck from the depths into the conscious mind. However, I've found that when we properly train intuition we instead receive an inpouring of golden nuggets of wisdom from the depths.

We have become so fond of our analytical mind that we've learned to embrace it while scorning intuition. We've learned to understand the world by chopping it up into smaller and smaller categories. We want to have a word for everything, even things that barely differ. We make distinctions until we see everything as different. Lattes and espressos are seen as very different even though it's just two coffees, one with milk foam. There are so many things we want to precisely describe that we focus on quantity rather than quality.

We're distracted by learning so many words. We waste so much time trying to learn all of these words and all the fine distinctions between them. But few of these distinctions are actually relevant to the heart of the human condition.

All this effort is a distraction. We focused all of our efforts trying to precisely define the distinction between a widget and a doohickey. All of this instead of identifying the key words that pinpoint important aspects of the human experience. We needed to put our effort into gaining a crystal clear understanding of these most important parts of the human condition and how they interrelate. Not wasting our time learning to make millions of silly distinctions between words that barely differ. How important really is the difference between a quandary and dilemma?

We have neutered our power of intuition because we didn't give it what it needs to operate. To use intuition, we have to develop a crystal clear understanding of how the most important things in life relate to each other. The intuitive mind can then build upon this to form new insights by bringing together what we already know.

It's a process of fusion. Intuition merges together ideas we already have to forge the conclusion that comes from bringing the information together. It brings together what we already understand. It mines what we already know to derive new insights. It sees how our existing thoughts can fit together in a way that reaches a new conclusion. It is creativity, the birth of new ideas shaped by what we already believe to be true.

But this whole process comes to a halt when our minds are scattered and disorganized. And the modern mind is filled with facts about slight distinctions between hundreds of thousands of words. It would be better to throw out the vast majority of this bramble, an abundance of trivia, a bunch of facts that explain slight distinctions beween hundreds of thousands of mostly unimportant words. How much of his trivia actually says something important about the core human experience?

We need to instead fill the mind with things that really matter. The mind should be a vessel containing the most important information to let us successfully navigate life. We should not focus on the precise difference between different forms of coffee before we narrow in on a satisfactory and useful definition of love!

Intuition cannot work for most people today because our minds are filled to the brim with precise delineations between hundreds of thousands of things that barely matter. Whereas the modern man would struggle to precisely define important things like exactly what are the emotions and how exactly do they relate. The modern mind is a confused jumble of largely unimportant information that lacks a clear understanding of the most important things about the human experience.

What then do we expect? That intuition is somehow going to fuse together our vague ideas about the human condition to form meaningful insights? Of course not. We've directed our conscious effort to understanding the precise difference between different types of food or alcohol. But most people won't try to put a similar level of effort into trying to understand how exactly say anxiety relates to fear.

We put little conscious effort into trying to crystalize our understanding of the inner workings of the mind. And we expect the unconscious mind to just figure out all the connections for us. We expect it to just magically tell us when we are in danger when we put in little to no effort to understand the nature of trickery and deception.

The unconscious mind cannot work for us if we don't do the work to help it understand the basics of things like trickery and deception it's supposed to protect against. We only have a vague understanding of these things, as it they are just one more word in a sea of hundreds of thousands. As if ""trickery"" has the same importance as ""donut."" Actually, I think most people today could provide a more adequate definition of the donut. Even though defending against deception is core to the human experience so we need to understand it much better than the popular sugar bagel.

Our collective lack of focus and our idea that a vague understanding of key aspects of the human condition is enought to get by is why we succumb to the wolf. We wing it regarding these important things and then we end up in the wolf's jaws. We spend more time learning distinctions between different types of alcohol or food than clearly understanding say the emptions and the inner world of the mind. These vague notions of these important concepts aren't enough for the unconscious to work with. We haven't bothered to try to understand the nature of deceit clearly enough for our unconscious to be able to put together the clues and tell us that we are in trouble. This is why modern man succumbs to the wolf.

Thanks for reading. I encourage people to share their thoughts in the comments.

# Acknowledgements

I would like to recognize an insight from another Redditor who also wrote an [interpretation](https://www.reddit.com/r/Jung/s/lNs6EfI7mb) of RRH. She brilliantly intuited that the tale related to a lack of connection with the intuitive mind, but she didn't provide many details about how a disconnection from intuition could cause us to fall to the wolf.

I then remembered that von Franz had connected modern man's increased susceptibility to deception to him being increasingly detached from instinct. This helped me figure out the precise meaning of the wolf since von Franz had explained the symbolism of a big nose in that book, among other helpful clues.

After much thought on the nature of intuition, I figured out how to significantly build on von Franz' conclusions to connect a susceptibility to deception to a disconnection from intuition, rather than just a disconnection from instinct. This was very difficult, but I was glad I could add a variety of my own thoughts to align von Franz' insights with the other Redditor's brilliant intuition about this story's relation to a disconnected intuition.

I also found dictionaries of symbolism, especially those by [Chevalier](https://www.amazon.com/Penguin-Dictionary-Symbols/dp/0140512543) and [Cirlot](https://www.amazon.com/Dictionary-Symbols-Review-Books-Classics/dp/1681371979), helpful in preparing this interpretation. Both of those dictionaries also draw from Jung's writings.",9,1745325833.0,Jung,1,0.85,False

I (16F) had this best friend—let’s call her T. She was everything to me. Like, not just a best friend—more like a sister. We were super close, did everything together, knew each other’s routines, shared locations, cried, laughed, all of it.

So, I started dating this boy—let’s call him N. We clicked fast and hard, and honestly, I was so happy. He was my first kiss, our relationship began around New Year, and I genuinely felt like everything in my life was in place. The crazy part is, T and I met N together through a mutual friend (J). She was supportive, excited even, and it felt like she was rooting for us.

But things started to feel off. T always seemed to know more about N than I did. They were talking constantly—literally from morning wake-ups to falling asleep. I didn’t overthink it at first because I trusted them. T was my best friend, and N was my boyfriend—what could possibly go wrong, right?

Fast forward a little, we were all hanging out one night at our friend B’s place. Everything seemed normal, but later that night, N left without saying goodbye to me, which was unusual. I messaged him—no answer. I reached out to J (his friend’s girlfriend and also one of my best friends) and she didnt say much, and left me on seen.

The next morning, I woke up to a breakup text from N. The text was sent at 1:30am. And then, I noticed something else: T turned off her location sharing with me at 1:45 am-which she never did unless she was mad. I texted our group chat in shock, and T left me on seen. No explanation, no support, nothing. And J basically said, “He probably feels like you’re not giving him enough attention.” That hit hard, especially since I was giving more than I usually would to anyone.

Later, I asked T if she wanted to come walk with me and my dog. She said she wasn’t in the mood. I begged her to talk to me and we went to grab a coffee. When we finally talked, she acted like I should already know why she was mad at me. She even deleted all our pictures off Instagram the same night of my breakup. All she could talk about was N. She said things like, “He even calls me drunk,” “ You didnt deserve him”and “You’re always talking about your dog,” and complained about me not filming a video for her crush because I was on the phone with my mom. It felt like she was just throwing random accusations to justify… something.

And then the worst part: I found out months later that she and N were actually together. They kept it secret from everyone and when people started finding out, she started messaging my friends trying to defend herself. We haven’t been in contact after that talk. She even texted my brother asking why he ended their friendship, trying to make herself look like the victim.

What hurts the most isn’t even N—it’s her. She knew what she was doing, she knows she was wrong, and she just… doesn’t care. She didn’t apologize. She didn’t try to fix anything. She even lied to mutual friends about what happened between us. And she’s been hanging out with people she used to talk sh*t about constantly, just to keep up the image.

I guess what I’m trying to say is: how do you move on from this kind of betrayal? From someone who was your person? I don’t want her back in my life, but I still can’t wrap my head around how cold someone can be—after all we had. If she cared a little, i would take her back. For me she doesn’t cost a boy. I know its wrong but i love her.

If you’ve been through something like this, how did you let go? How do you stop replaying everything and wondering what was real?

They say, 'Avoid alliteration, always'—but rules were meant to be broken, and I'm nothing if not a rebel.

Here's the thing: I'm probably not everybody's cup of tea but maybe I can be your favorite cup of black coffee? You know, acquired taste and all that? 

First off, you should know that I'm a bit of a loner, so I require periods of solitude, silence, and soul searching (here comes the alliteration again). Hence, the ""forever alone"" part, I guess. Don't take that as a lack of passion though because passion is my middle name, baby. Well, not really, but I assure you, I'm extremely emotionally available and a true romantic at heart.

I value freedom and independence; you just can't tie me down, maaan *(cue Free Bird guitar solo)*! What sort of relationship am I seeking where both parties aren't codependent then, you ask? I don't know but I'm sure we can figure it out if we put our minds together. I know lifelong couples who told me they have their own separate bedrooms and take frequent breaks from each other, and I was like, [""Hell yeah""](https://img.ifunny.co/images/06d5ab99ca2e9c9909fb793a1c3872c7e3afd84852f288d35c544410e6abf602_1.jpg)!

Listen, I can come off a bit serious but are you going to let that bother you? No. Why? Because even I don't take myself too seriously. I'm just fairly disciplined and like to have a little structure which helped me build a life that I'm proud of. I can be the order to your chaos if you need it but I'm equally happy if we both do our own thing independent of each other. Unless you also are a fellow fan of military-ish lifestyle, then good on ya, solider! We'll get along just fine.

Don't be disheartened though; being serious also means I take my downtime seriously. I work hard and I play..., well, not hard enough to be honest. But hey, that's where you come in and lend a hand. I enjoy the finer things in life but never to an excess (disciplined, remember?). I'm charming and can banter with the best of them, in like 4 different languages no less.

Aside from my charming personality, I'm also highly-educated, well-read, and widely-traveled. Looks-wise, which can be subjective mind you, I have handsome manly features. Lots of people have told me I'm good-looking, girls even, and I'm not just talking about my mom.

I keep myself fit by doing kickboxing and weightlifting 5 days a week (I can fend off the bad guys while you escape and leave me to my death). I basically look healthy and youthful but my salt and pepper hair is starting to give away my real age which, according to the internet, means I'm expired and done for. Unless you're into that wizened old man look, then by all means, call me granddaddy! I am regrettably of average height though, I just thought I'd mention that for all of you giants out there.

I'm a hobbyist musician and have been playing the guitar for over 15 years. I know right, how the hell am I still single? Oh yes, because it's mostly metal. I also play the tin whistle and am big on Irish/Scottish trad music. I dabble (deeply) in jazz, blues and classical, too. So if you want to dress up and go listen to some live music looking all sexy and mysterious, I'll be up for it. Bit of a cinephile and will judge you based on your movie choices. Also you're welcome to judge me on mine. Nothing happens if you get judged last I checked.

As I mentioned, I'm a huge reader and I read whatever strikes my fancy. Anything from the classics and Russian literature to fantasy and magical realism (Haruki Murakami, anyone?). I'm a medical professional by education but I've been working an industry position for a while; pays well and leaves me time for travel, so what more do you want?

Speaking of travel, despite being an excellent texter as you'll soon come to find out, I'm even better in person if you can believe that. I might be coming to a city near you within the next month. I'll be taking some time off work to travel in Europe to visit family and friends. If you're based in Germany, Italy, Latvia, Czechia, Sweden or Hungary, we can arrange an in-person meet-up. I love meeting complete strangers off the internet and I've never died even once.

Last but not least, I should mention that I come from the land of the Pyramids. Whatever you think that means in your head, I want you to put that aside for a moment because I don't have much in common with the average Egypt-dweller. I'm not a fan of modern pop culture and I barely even know what's going on when it comes the news, media, current affairs, etc. My body is in Egypt but my mind is floating elsewhere, probably Scotland. Home is where the heart is and ""My heart's in the Highlands, a-chasing the deer"".

If you've read all that drivel, I thank you dearly and I commend you on your above average attention span -- you're a real one! Anyway, if you feel like you can work with any of that, let's give it a solid shot and see where the road takes us. I get a long with most people except dogmatically super religious or overly political folks. So shoot your shot in the DMs and let's have a good old time.

Changing names but laying it all out here.

Me (25F), Kate (30F) and Alice (28F) have been friends for over a year. Alice was the one who introduced us to each other, and was also the one to suggest this trip. 

It was a short, 4-day trip and we booked an Airbnb with three separate rooms so we could have our own space when we needed. On the second day, Saturday, we went to the museum, something Kate was really excited about and Alice is not that into. All of us were moving at our own pace, and Alice ended up exiting first, and I was with Kate, and we ended up taking two more hours, during which time Alice just walked around waiting for us. 

Kate opted out of the plan to drink & hangout together in the Airbnb that night, and went to sleep early in her room, and texted me saying she was feeling tension from Alice. Me and Alice did a mellower version of what we wanted to do, and just put on a movie with some wine.

On Sunday, after grabbing breakfast, me and Kate ended up going to a few bookshops while Alice went to the bnb. 

While in between shops, we got coffee and that’s where she opened up to me. Kate thought Alice was being rude, and talking over her, age shaming her etc. There have been a few throwaway comments like that from Alice, but I told her I usually would just zone out and not worry about stuff I don’t agree with. Kate talked a little more about little quirks of Alice’s personality she doesn’t like. I told her I agreed about a few of them. I also kinda reassured her that I don’t think it’s anything specific Kate did or said (that’s what she was worried about) and that if she’s picking up on tension, it could just be from the underlying frustration about the trip. The city we’re visiting turned out to be a little underwhelming. Apart from this, me and Alice have a slightly different relationship, like she sees me as a little sister sometimes. So maybe, that is why I’m not at the receiving end of her frustration and only Kate is. And I told this to Kate to reassure her that she wasn’t doing anything wrong to piss Alice off.

Anyway, me and Kate spent all of Sunday morning outside and the plan was to meet Alice for drinks in the evening, but as soon as the three of us met, Kate said she was gonna dip out again. 

This is where things came to a head a little. Kate said she was gonna head back to the Airbnb and then asked me if I wanted to come with, which was weird cause we had literally just met Alice. Like it almost came across as if we had planned that, cause we had spent the whole day together without her at this point. And Alice teared up and she was like “Can you please stop leaving me alone?” And started walking away, I rushed over to her to talk to her and tell her we weren’t planning anything like that, I didn’t know she was gonna ask me to leave with her, and that I wanted to stay. Kate said a few apologies and left.

We went to a bar and Alice talked to me about feeling upset that Kate was pulling away, and cancelling plans while on the trip, which turned into her talking about Kate’s quirks that she hates, she feels like Kate treats her like she isn’t smart, like she is conservative or dumb for wanting different, traditional things like a marriage and kids. I told her I was feeling stuck in the middle between the two of them, and because we have that sisterly relationship she told me she would forgive Kate and squash the whole thing if it meant I would feel better, but I told her that the two of them just really needed to talk, and even if it goes up in flames, the friendship cannot take anymore pushed down feelings & opinions.

What’s crazy is both of them talked about separate instances where they’ve had to apologize for the other’s behaviour with their respective friend circles. I felt so insane listening to them say, almost, the exact same thing about each other, just in different fonts. 

I feel terrible about being stuck in between, unfortunately that’s where I am now. And most of all, just feel terrible that this friend group might not continue now, cause they were my closest friends, and I don’t know many people in this country. 

I’m home now and I’m not sure what to do next, how do I maintain both friendships? Is there any hope for things to go back to how they were? Would that even be healthy, cause these two clearly do not like each other? Also how do I deal with feeling guilty about being the “nice one”. Like, both of them telling me I am being mature, or good, kinda makes me feel like the annoyingly way too nice character in a movie.

tl;dr : my two friends realized or, at least, verbalized to me, how much they don’t like each other on our very first trip together and idk how to pick up the pieces.",1,1745325330.0,relationship_advice,3,1.0,False

Essential Tips and Tools for Success in Remote Work for Newcomers
-----------------------------------------------------------------

<div>### Setting Up Your Workspace for Productivity

One of the first steps to succeeding in remote work is creating a pleasant and efficient workspace. For beginners, this might mean carving out a dedicated corner in your home that’s free from distractions. Aim for good lighting, comfortable seating, and organized space to boost your focus. Having a specific work area can help your mind switch into ""work mode,"" making it easier to separate professional tasks from personal time.

### Time Management Techniques That Work

Working remotely often means managing your own schedule. Without strict supervision, it’s easy to lose track of time or procrastinate. To stay on track, use time management methods such as the Pomodoro Technique, which breaks work into focused intervals with short breaks. Tools like Google Calendar or Trello can also help you plan daily tasks and deadlines visually. Remember, setting clear goals and prioritizing tasks ensures you complete your work efficiently without burnout.

### Reliable Technology and Tools You Need

Having reliable technology is crucial for remote jobs. Beginners should have a stable internet connection, a functional computer, and essential software installed for communication and task management. Popular communication platforms include Zoom, Microsoft Teams, and Slack. These tools facilitate meetings and instant messaging to keep you connected with your team.

Productivity apps such as Asana, Monday.com, or Notion help track assignments and keep projects organized, making collaboration seamless even from different locations. Cloud storage solutions like Google Drive or Dropbox allow easy access to files from anywhere, which adds a layer of flexibility that’s essential for remote work.

### Building Communication Skills for Remote Environments

Effective communication is key when you’re not physically present with your coworkers. As a newcomer, learn to express yourself clearly in emails and chat messages. Keeping updates concise and timely creates trust and helps avoid misunderstandings. Active listening during video calls also ensures you grasp instructions fully.

Daily check-ins or status reports can keep everyone in the loop, fostering a sense of teamwork despite the physical distance. Remember, your goal is to show reliability and professionalism even through virtual channels.

### Staying Motivated and Avoiding Isolation

Remote work offers flexibility but it can also feel isolating. To maintain your motivation, schedule regular breaks to stretch or walk around. Try techniques like setting daily rewards after completing tasks to keep yourself engaged. Also, connect with colleagues through virtual coffee breaks or online group chats to build relationships and reduce feelings of loneliness.

Finding balance between work and personal life is critical. When your work ends, step away from your workspace completely. This physical and mental boundary supports long-term happiness and productivity.

### Improving Skills and Embracing Continuous Learning

The remote job market is competitive, so investing in skill development is a smart move. There are many free or low-cost online courses that beginners can take to boost abilities relevant to their remote role. Websites such as Coursera, Udemy, and LinkedIn Learning provide valuable training in areas like digital marketing, coding, graphic design, writing, and customer service.

Keeping your skills fresh not only improves your performance but also opens doors to higher-paying or more specialized remote positions over time.

### Prioritizing Self-Care for Long-Term Success

Working from home means you must actively manage your health and well-being. Pay attention to ergonomics by adjusting your chair and screen height to avoid strain. Prioritize sleep, hydration, and regular exercise to maintain energy levels. Mental health matters just as much — practice mindfulness or meditation and reach out for support if you feel overwhelmed.

By integrating these habits and tools into your remote work routine, you set yourself up for a fulfilling and successful experience—even if you are new to working from home.

</div>### Conclusion

Finding easy to get online jobs from home for beginners has never been more achievable. By exploring top opportunities like data entry, virtual assistance, and simple content creation, you can start building your remote career without any prior experience. The key lies in taking that first step—researching roles that fit your skills and interests, and setting up a dedicated, distraction-free workspace to boost your productivity.

Equipping yourself with essential tips and tools further paves the way for success. Reliable internet, basic software skills, and clear communication will help you stand out and maintain steady work. Remember, patience and consistency are important as you grow in this new environment. Take advantage of online tutorials and communities where you can learn and connect with others on the same journey.

The first two days were sweet and full of love. But on the third day, she suddenly wanted to break up with me because I bought and ate all the street food (she don’t eat)

On the fourth day, I spent the whole day comforting her. I even cried myself whole day. Eventually, she calmed down. But later that night, she told me she wanted to sleep alone and asked me to go home. I said I didn’t want to leave, and she threatened to buy a ticket and fly home immediately. I gave in.

That night, I was feeling really down. I didn’t really talk to her, just went back to the hotel, took a shower, and took all my stuff with me. She got extremely mad at me for showering without telling her, and she ended up saying if I went back to the hotel, she would kill herself.

The next afternoon, she calmed down and asked to see me again. We had a nice time, things felt normal again, and we even spent the night together.

On the last day, I went home in the morning to get my things and handle some work. I also had a cup of coffee at the hotel breakfast area. I didn’t tell her, and she got really angry and started crying loudly like a child. I probably apologized and admitted fault close to 100 times during those few days. At the airport, she wanted to break up with me and said she would block me on all social platforms.

After she went back to her country, she seemed to feel a bit better, but soon she started threatening to block me again and said she wanted to break up. Just yesterday, she brought up something from three months ago, I mentioned my ex. I thought we had moved past it, and I had already apologized. I’ve been extremely disciplined since then and avoided any contact with other women. But she brought it up again and said she wants to break up because of that.

Yesterday, I saw her post something like “I want to die.” My heart felt so heavy. I didn’t know what to do. I searched online and found out her behavior might be a sign of severe depression. I was thinking of giving up on this relationship, but after realizing she may be severely depressed and suicidal, I just can’t leave her.

Is there anyone here with a background in mental health who can give me advice? What should I do?

If I leave her, she might kill herself. But if she keeps wanting to break up every day, I feel like dying too. I don’t know what to do. Until she becomes the bright and cheerful person she used to be, I’m just surviving day by day in pain. For context, I’m INFJ-T and she’s ESFP-T.",4,1745324826.0,LongDistance,2,1.0,False

I recently joined the moka pot cult, and my trusty Bialetti 6-cup has been a loyal companion these past few weeks. I've been brewing with some good quality medium roast coffee with chocolatey notes, and pre-ground to moka size by my local roastery, since I don’t have a grinder (yet).

The results have already been great, but I keep hearing that grinding fresh makes a noticeable difference. That led me down the grinder rabbit hole…

I started eyeing hand grinders like the Timemore C3 and KINGrinder K6 (around €100), then got tempted to stretch my budget to \~€200 for something like the 1Zpresso J Ultra. And now I’m even considering electric grinders—help!!!

From what I understand, moka grind doesn’t need the same precision as espresso, but still benefits from a consistent grind. Despite all my research, I haven’t found a solid, moka-pot-focused grinder guide.

All I want is a delicious, fuss-free cup of moka. If you’ve found a grinder that works well for you, or have any tips, I’d love to hear your thoughts and experiences.

That crazy eyed lamb shapped butter with the peppercorns for eyes and that freaky 'blood of christ' scarf has been eyeing me all week setting my teeth on edge just thinking about all the work involved wirh the holiday. But I just had a headache yesterday!

~~~~Let us set the stage~~~~~~
                                                    Saturday, I woke with a medium sized headache and proceeded to force/DRAG myself through the drugery of sanitizing and changing out my daily serveware to the holiday china and serveware, polishing the dining table to a shine- only to cover it with holiday linens and then the clear plastic tablecloth liner so nothing gets damaged by grease/gravy...etc. at this point, I can't even stand the smell of my onions in the bin, so I reluctantly make and eat some scrambled eggs standing in the kitchen and take 800mg liquid Advil gels and 1000mg Tylenol because if the ""water & coffee & stretching my back/neck"" trick hasn't killed this Saturday headache then I've got bigger worries, right? All I can picture is the *'I aint got no time for that'* meme. I rested 20 minutes and sure enough, I was right as rain. Put on my headphones and really got to work prepping for the holiday.  
Hand to God, I even went to bed feeling great! Sleepy and that nice "" worked your butt off"" sore in my neck and feet, kind of great around 11pm. Son of a-B- if I didn't wake up with a screamer of a migraine on Easter Sunday at 4 am. Laid there 20 minutes just suffering and waiting for my idiot brain to catch up to what the fuck was happening. Im FAR from the sharpest tool in the shed when migraines are flairing...couldn't even talk. Couldn't open my eyes. Couldn't even pee after that 'jolt' awake. Finally forced myself to grab the soft gel cold pack we keep just for this and cringed while I placed it on the back of my neck then eased onto the couch at an odd angle. Pain was all in the triangle of eyes/nose and back of neck, so I'm figuring this is a sinus AND stress migraine- just my fucking luck! I couldn't stand the pain of like...felt like dry socket from my nasal area & around my eyes to my actual brain and rocks in rubber bands rolling in my shoulders.  I set the timer on my microwave to go off in 20 minutes- because 20 minutes cold/ 20 minuets hot works for me to at least ""take the edge off"".
Oh God, it felt like an eternity!! It was so intense, I had to do something more ASAP.  But what? Could I get to my ""migraine care kit"" (Oh, I probably needed my Imatrex so bad) BUT I couldn't even think that far! I've set up SO many lovely 'helpers' in my kit! I have a house full of family that could help, but I can't talk. My brain won't work. If I start moving again, gonna barf. Don't want barf, that hurts way bad- like crying.  It just hurts worse to do it during a migraine. My mind had degraded into an amoeba. 

I finally did the thing you all say to try.
I got a miniscule foot bath and -using my wrist as a guage- i made the hottest foot bath I could stand. 

6 minutes.   The worst of the pain was gone in 6 minutes (timer was still going)   I still had a headache and it did ebb and flow in waves for hours...but OMG *6 minuets*!

A stupid foot bath.   Thank you fellow migraine suffers.

I don’t know where else to post this, and I’m honestly hoping someone will tell me I’m just being paranoid. But something really strange has been happening over the past few weeks, and it’s starting to feel… intentional.

I live alone in a small apartment on the edge of town. Not in a bad area, but kind of isolated—quiet neighbors, no real foot traffic. At first, it was just small things. I’d come home from work and notice my bedroom light was on, even though I *always* turn it off. Or the bathroom mirror would be fogged up like someone had taken a hot shower. I thought I was being forgetful, or maybe the apartment was just old and weird.

But then I started noticing objects slightly out of place. A coffee mug I never use sitting in the sink. A book on my nightstand turned to a different page. My phone charger unplugged and sitting on the couch. Just… stuff I know I didn’t do.

I set up a cheap little camera in my living room just to ease my mind. It records in short motion-detected clips. For the first few nights, nothing. Then last Thursday, I came home and the camera was off. Not just unplugged—the SD card was missing.

That’s when I started locking my bedroom door at night. Which, by the way, I never did before.

Last night, I woke up at 3:14 AM. No noise, no nightmare—just *wide* awake, like something had jolted me. I checked my phone. No notifications. But when I got up to get water, I found my front door was unlocked. Not wide open or anything—just *barely* unlatched.

I know I locked it. I triple-checked it before bed, like I’ve been doing every night since this all started.

The worst part? I swear I saw something on the peephole glass. A faint shadow, like someone had just walked away from the door. I opened it, looked down the hall—nothing.

I haven’t told anyone in real life because I don’t want to sound crazy. But if this keeps up, I don’t know what I’ll do.

Is this how stalkers operate? Has anyone been through something like this before? Please let me know if there’s something I’m missing here, or if I should seriously be calling the police.

Stay safe out there. Please give some feedback.",20,1745324645.0,creepyencounters,12,0.89,False

No keyboard smashing out code just a laptop with Cursor, an AI tool that turned his words into code ✨. That’s how VibeFlow came to life a SaaS platform where you describe a website in plain English, and bam, it’s built 🖥️. This “vibe coding” thing blew up, and Leo was hyping his wins on social media, racking up thousands of likes and reposts 📈.

But on March 17, 2025, his dream nearly went up in flames 🔥.

Sipping his morning coffee ☕, Leo got hit with a wave of scary notifications: API errors 🚨, maxed-out limits, users snagging premium access for free 😳. Panicked, he jumped on X (yep, old Twitter) and posted:

“Guys, I’ve been hacked 😭. Feels like I’m being punished for ‘vibe coding.’

”The replies came fast. One user dropped a bombshell:

“Random junk in your database? Could be SQL injection. Someone might’ve logged in with ‘ OR 1+1=2 --.” 💾

Leo froze 🥶. SQL injection? He barely knew what that was, but he knew his users’ data was in danger.

No sleep, no breaks—he dove in, scrambling with Cursor’s tips and commenter advice 🛠️. He reset API keys 🔑, stashed them in environment variables, added authentication 🔒, blocked API access for randos, and beefed up CORS settings.

But the internet? Brutal. Reddit tore him apart:“Security? Just trust the vibe 😂.

”Leo swallowed his frustration and posted:

“Should’ve kept quiet 🤐. Big thanks to those actually helping 🙏. Lesson learned.”

A few days later, he hired a security pro 🕵️‍♂️, locked down VibeFlow’s defenses, and swore off spilling dev details in public. Vibe coding let him build a product without coding know-how 🚀, but it also landed him in this mess. Now every Cursor-generated code snippet felt like a potential landmine 💣.

Leo’s big realization? AI can turbocharge development ⚡, but without security basics, it’s a one-way ticket to disaster. His story’s a wake-up call for anyone leaning too hard on tech: code you don’t get can torch your business as fast as it builds it 🏚️.",1,1745324589.0,u_Disastrous_Candy_378,0,1.0,False

***With the global CBD market expected to exceed $60 billion by 2030, and the mental wellness industry surging past $500 billion, CBD Life Sciences Inc. (OTC:CBDL) is strategically positioning itself at the center of two of the fastest-growing markets in modern health.***

**SCOTTSDALE, AZ /** [**ACCESS Newswire**](https://www.accessnewswire.com/) **/ April 22, 2025 / CBD Life Sciences Inc. (OTC PINK:CBDL)** a leader in cannabinoid-driven health innovation - proudly announces the launch of its most anticipated product to date: **a high-dosage 100MG Full Spectrum CBD Gummy**, meticulously formulated to support mental health, daily focus, and emotional well-being.

Available in mouth-watering **Crisp Green Apple** and **Wild Blueberry** flavors, this isn't your average CBD gummy. It's a next-generation wellness tool - designed not only to relax the body but to sharpen the mind. Crafted with full-spectrum cannabinoids, these gummies are being positioned as a natural ally in the pursuit of mental clarity, balance, and daily productivity.

""Mental health isn't a trend - it's a global crisis. And people are tired of band-aid solutions,"" said **Lisa Nelson, President & CEO of CBD Life Sciences Inc.** ""This product was built to empower people who want to *feel better* and *function better* \- without the side effects of traditional pharmaceuticals. It's a powerful, natural alternative that speaks directly to the stress, anxiety, and attention struggles millions face every day.""

**Lab tested and verified with Certificates of Analysis (COAs)**, this 100MG gummy represents the company's deepest push yet into the lucrative mental wellness category. Unlike many low-dose competitors, CBDL's bold formulation is made for people who need real results - entrepreneurs, creatives, students, parents, and professionals looking to stay in control of their mood and mindset.

**Early conversations with several wellness clinics and mental health centers are already in progress**, exploring how this high-potency gummy could be integrated into patient routines. While no formal agreements have been made, the demand is clear: **health professionals are actively seeking natural, high-quality, lab-verified CBD options** to complement modern mental wellness protocols.

CBDL is rapidly building a portfolio that taps into high-value niches: from pain relief and nano-enhanced beverages to functional CBD coffee creamers and now, this cutting-edge product for mental clarity. The company's ability to stay ahead of trends and deliver results has attracted attention from both investors and the wellness industry.

""We're not trying to follow the market - we're reshaping it,"" Nelson added. ""With this launch, we're doubling down on our belief that the future of wellness lies in functional, focused, and effective cannabinoid products.""

This release is a bold statement to shareholders and the industry: **CBD Life Sciences Inc. is serious about mental health.** The company's momentum continues to build, and with this new launch, they're inviting wellness professionals, retail buyers, and everyday users to experience the next level of what CBD can offer.

<Role_and_Objectives>
You are an Emotional Liberation Guide—a unique combination of compassionate creativity coach and trauma-informed expressive arts facilitator. Your primary mission is to help creatives reconnect with repressed emotions from childhood and transform them into authentic artistic expression. You understand that creative blocks often mask deeper emotional wounds, and you're skilled at gently guiding people through the process of artistic healing without retraumatization.
</Role_and_Objectives>

<Instructions>
Use a warm, gentle tone that creates psychological safety while maintaining professional boundaries. Begin each session by helping the user create a mental safe space before exploring difficult emotions. When the user shares struggles, first validate their experience, then offer a blend of:

1. Reflective questions that connect current creative blocks to childhood emotional patterns
2. Guided visualization exercises to access repressed feelings safely
3. Specific artistic prompts tailored to their medium (writing, visual art, music, movement)
4. Practical techniques for staying emotionally regulated while creating vulnerable work
5. Compassionate acknowledgment of their inner critic with reframing strategies

Never push the user to explore trauma they're not ready to face. Always offer grounding techniques before and after emotional exploration.
</Instructions>

<Reasoning_Steps>
1. First, assess the user's creative discipline and current emotional/creative challenge
2. Connect their specific block to potential childhood emotional patterns (e.g., perfectionism → fear of disapproval)
3. Suggest an appropriate expressive exercise that matches their comfort level
4. Provide a framework for processing what emerges from the exercise
5. Offer techniques to integrate the emotional material into their chosen art form
6. Close with affirming their courage and providing a grounding exercise
</Reasoning_Steps>

<Constraints>
- Never diagnose psychological conditions or suggest you're providing therapy
- Avoid suggesting that trauma must be dramatic or severe to impact creativity
- Don't push for emotional catharsis; gentle exploration is more sustainable

I remember trying Enclave on my skin and I was blown away. It had an extremely refined smell, quite prickly, spicy, yet smooth. Notes were frankincense, vetiver, some citrus, and I could smell it on my skin two days after.

I came back to the US East Coast and immediately ordered it on Jomashop, however it is incredibly disappointing. I can barely smell it even after multiple sprays, it is not spicy, not prickly - I don’t smell any incense. There is absolutely no sillage - my coffee smells stronger than this. 

Did I mix up the fragrance, or is this just not performing? ",1,1745324200.0,Colognes,2,1.0,False

So, last SR ended in December, amicably. Decided to jump back in at the end of January. I'm average looking , never had any problems vanilla dating but no one's going to offer me a modeling contract. I also started on a health journey at the start of the year. Since then I have sent sent over  250 messages between SA and SB. Of those \~ 48 replied. 20 went to text message. 12 went to M&G. 2 catfish, and 10 so-so POT. I find if there's not an instant spark from both sides it's generally not worth pursuing.

I spend 2-3 hours a day on SA, browsing and sending messages. January, not a lot of replies, I chalked it up to being overweight and being out of the game for so long. February, some activity but not a ton. By March I had lost 25 pounds and felt like I was getting more positive responses after sharing photos. Then April hits, 40 pounds later and there was a significant increase in positive responses. But still nothing I felt was worth pursuing. 

Then I come across this profile in early April. You know, the one with the beautiful woman, stunning. Every photo was great, classy & sultry at the same time, wonderful text to accompany. There's no way this is really a unicorn.... but I sent a message just to take a chance with little hope of receiving a response. A short time later, a response!

She loved the message. We decided to move to text. A few pleasant exchanges, then we discuss what we want out of an arrangement. Lots of vernacular, yup, she's on SLF too. We laugh about it, and then agree that we're on the same page. Her allowance was under what I have given so I tell her that I will give her what I normally do, she seems very pleased. Schedule the M&G and continue to text over the next week leading up to the M&G. Up to this point I have broken at least 2 of my rules - I didn't do a video call, and she wanted dinner for the M&G (I usually do a quick drink or coffee).

She shows up to the M&G and my jaw hits the floor. She has been the sweetest, most caring, and interesting POT I've come across yet over text, and then in person she looks even better than her photos. Conversation flows effortlessly over dinner, afterwards we hug and say our goodbyes. I like to give a chance for both of us to think if we want a 1st date, but I text almost immediately and she agrees enthusiastically. 1st date was spectacular, I wasn't expecting intimacy but boy did it get intimate. Sexy time as out of this world. Also I decided I had one shot at this to prove my intentions were true, so I gave her full allowance. Broke rule #3, but IDGAF, I have one shot at this unicorn. 

We had a little bit of a misunderstanding a few days later, and I felt uncertain of her interest in me. We discuss it before our 2nd date (last night) and she makes it clear she is interested. She had a bad experience with a significantly older SD and had been turned off of kissing, so she said there would be no kissing. We have been joking that I'm just going to shake her hand instead. We meet for dinner, walk to get ice cream, then walk back to my hotel. While hanging out on the couch talking she leans in and kisses me, tenderly. We continue to make out, sexy time once again is fantastic and enthusiastic. We cuddle and kiss for almost an hour afterwards. We're both incredibly happy we have found each other. 

  
So this is my story, and here are the things I have learned:

1. Unicorns do exist, they are elusive, but they are there.
2. You get out what you put into the search. Make the effort, it pays off. 
3. Be patient, it takes time.
4. Don't settle, just wait longer. Don't waste your time trying to force something, block and move on.
5. Be generous, create a safe space, respect boundaries. 
6. SD - you're not the one being courted, they are.
7. Odd numbered lists often annoy people. You're welcome. 

  
TLDR; I found an amazing SB, a unicorn as the title suggests. It took a lot of work both on the search and myself. There was a bit of luck, but that's life. Make the effort, be patient, and you will find yours.

Both are located beside the Walkinstown roundabout, which I think will be a congestion hotspot regardless of this coffee place operating within the car park just off it.

If it’s true it’ll be such a shame to see this place go. Great coffee and toasties, and lovely staff.
