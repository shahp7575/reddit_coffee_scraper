Maybe I was blind to it, maybe she's avoidant, and maybe things were never meant to be, but I've been through many breakups with objectively worse or bad people, and nothing has hurt me like she has.

As to how it happened, I can't say what it was in her perspective and I understand that people tend to be biased. I am not perfect. I was tired from work and lack of sleep, and that same morning I was just done bouldering with her running on 3 hours of sleep, and nothing seemed out of the ordinary, later after we split I received news of my dad's illness (dementia) which put me into a major depressive mood so I asked her if I could come by to her place and crash for a bit. All I wanted to do was be around her in single moment of emotional vulnerability, she let me in but as I stayed there longer and was napping, she was clearly growing annoyed, and then told me to leave. I was dragging my foot telling her I just want to be around her for a little more, but I eventually obliged and left. During my trip home, she told me she never wanted to see me ever again and I broke her boundaries. Just 3 hours before this she sent me a text about how she enjoyed my company today. It was emotional whiplash on a scale I've never encountered before.

I've never raised my voice against her, I've never threatened her, and I've never argued with her, and on our first argument ever, she threatened to call the cops on me, she was so loving just the days before, and the same morning we were talking about vacationing to Bali together, it was like I was suddenly transported into an alternate reality.

I am aware that this is highly unusual, and normal people don't act like this, so perhaps it's a good thing, but I still can't get myself to hate her.

I know she has trauma over her previous relationship stalking her, and I try my best to respect her and not remind her of her previous issues, and unfortunately it looks like I couldn't do enough to stop that person from being projected on me. From what I get told, she may be an avoidant, but I guess I won't really know.

She blocked me on everything, and got her friends to block me. It doesn't help of course, and maybe only made it worse, because **I work literally next to her**. I have to see her everyday, and pretend as if I don't know her, I feel like a stalker when I catch a glimpse of her while getting coffee at work, my entire daily routine now feels unusual, every moment her coworker makes eye contact with me, I can only wonder what she's saying about me to them.

I'm still processing the grief, and I understand now that maybe it's just not meant to be. I still love her with all my heart, and I still can't find any bitterness or resentment towards her, except maybe for the act of blocking, cutting someone out of your life without proper communication. It hurts my soul not knowing what I may have been blind to. It hurts to speculate on whether or not I was just being played. It hurts to sometimes think that all of it has simply been a lie. It hurts to think I was simply being taken advantage of, or whether or not I am a genuine monster.

Sure, some people may be monsters, and cutting them off without any closure in a snap may be the closest thing to the correct answer, but I believe that people are good, in contrast of what the internet may lead you to believe.

Our anniversary is coming up. We met just before COVID started and talked all through it and started going on dates after quarantine was lifted. He has a son (11M) and I treat the boy as if he were my own. Our relationship is a very sweet one, as he always would tell me that he didn't want to be the teenager him of the past, so he made sure to bring me hot chocolate and a donut after I told him I hated the taste of coffee when he came by my place of work when we were still in the talking phase before COVID started. He always pays attention to what I say and remembers it. The last 4 years have been amazing and I truly love him. However, earlier this year he went 4 months without answering any of my texts. He would read them but not respond. It wasn't until I got concerned enough to ask if his son and grandmother were alright that he finally answered me. He had lost his job and his apartment and was going through a bout of depression and felt he didn't deserve me. I talked to him about how relationships are about leaning on each other and helping each other even if he didn't want help financially I was there emotionally and always there if he needed to vent or talk. He told me he got a new apartment and a new job and he was talking to me again. That lasted a while 2 months before he ghosted me again. This time I'm being left on delivered. He's not even looking at the texts. I can't drive out to him because he didn't tell me where his new place is. It's been a while 2 and a half months of no texts. Half of me is so angry and the other half is worried. 

(For those who are wondering about the sons mother she gave up parental rights when the boy was 4 and she left my boyfriend to change her gender and date another woman)

So I've been having bad stomach issues for a few weeks, and I have gained 11lbs in weight in the space of 3 weeks. 

I'm suffering from constipation. I normally poop several times a day, but I had been doing once for a few weeks, and they were not properly formed. Type 5-6. I was in pain where I needed to poo more, but it wasn't coming out

For a couple of weeks, I have been drinking green tea, espresso coffee shots, having gut cleanse tablets, dgl liquorice tablets, chewing ginger, drinking apple cider vinegar etc to try and help, and it has been helping me. I've also taken laxatives a couple of times too. 

On Monday this week, I decided to cut out wheat and dairy temporarily to see if it made a difference. 

I've suffered with bloating since I was a teenager, and have issues with IBS, but I also have two forms of kidney disease too, and have been on a number of tablets over the years. I know that this is nothing to do with my kidney condition. 

But for the last few weeks, I have had the bloating worse than ever, blinding headaches, severe dizziness, constipation, diarrhea, my stomach feels lumpy, feeling the cold even more than usual, nausea, appetite is lower etc.  

I'm still going to the gym, and exercising as much as I was before. I've cut my portions, and it's not helping with the weight issue. I've been exercising when I've been dizzy, which I know is not sensible. 

I should mention that I have previously lost nearly 11 stone in weight naturally too.

In the thrilling world of trading, the promise of quick profits can be akin to fool's gold—enticing but often elusive. Yet, with the right strategy and mindset, reaching a remarkable milestone is not just a dream. Just last week, I made a staggering $55,000 trading Forex, and today, I’m peeling back the curtain to share exactly how this was achieved. Grab your coffee, settle into your chair, and let’s dive into the exhilarating ride that led to this high-reward outcome.

THE INITIAL SPARK: WHERE STRATEGY MEETS OPPORTUNITY
Let’s start by addressing the elephant in the room: luck vs. skill. While luck plays a role in the world of trading, equipping yourself with the right tools and knowledge dramatically tilts the odds in your favor. My journey this week was the result of strategic precision, leveraging insights gained from years of analyzing market trends and movements.

BUILDING THE BLUEPRINT
 1. Deep Market Research:
    Forex trading hinges on understanding market behaviors. I dedicated hours each day to analyzing economic indicators, currency correlations, and geopolitical risks. This foundational work laid the ground for informed decisions.
    
    
 2. Leveraging Technology:
    Using advanced trading platforms and algorithms, I tailored trades to align with market shifts. These technologies enhanced my decision-making, allowed for pinpoint entries, and optimized exits.
    
    
 3. Risk Management:
    
    

 Every trade carries risk. I employed a robust risk management framework by setting stop losses and diversifying currency pair investments. This strategy minimized potential losses while maximizing gains.

Today the kids were arguing so I had to get up early to deal with them and before I could even make my first cup of coffee my wife started making demands, complaining about some work done by workmen earlier in the week, blaming me as if it was my fault for not overseeing them properly (she’s a perfectionist and finds fault with everything) I told her I would fix it and she just kept going on and on about things before I was even properly awake. At the same time one of my kids was raiding the cupboards and another was being loud. Well… I lost my shit and started shouting at her in response.

I'm 116 lbs at 5’4” and my weight has stayed in the 115-120 range for the past 4 ish years. 

Recently everywhere I go people have been telling me that I look like I don't eat and I get where they're coming from cause the lack of fat shows up on my face. My eyes are sorta sunken, strong jaw and the cheeks are hollowed as well. 

I wanted to gain 10 lbs by 2025 but I realized in the process that my eating habits in general are not normal. I used to not really eat breakfast before school in high school and it's the same now in uni. It's not that I don't have time but I never feel hungry until like 3 or 4 pm in the afternoon. I drink tea or coffee in the morning to feel awake and usually that's enough to get me through the classes. 

My classes usually end at 3 and by then I'm freaking starving, so when I get home I eat a huge huge meal (probably equivalent to 3 servings) and then I'm done for the day. The thought of eating when I'm not hungry doesn't make sense to me. My sisters say it's weird how there will be the best cake we've ever had in the fridge but I still won't have the temptation to eat that if I'm not hungry. 

I've tried to get myself to eat before classes but that gets me super sleepy by 10 or 11 am. I workout like 2-3 times a week and it's just basic cardio for 30-40 mins to keep my heart healthy. I also don't eat 3-4 hours before bed cause then I feel stuffed and have trouble feeling comfortable enough to fall asleep. 

Has anyone else experienced this? Why's it that I feel hungry that too on a severe level only once a day? How do I fix this and start building up a normal routine of 3 meals a day and hopefully gain a few pounds to look healthier?  ",1,1729321601.0,WomensHealth,0,1.0,False

It has a more produced sound which took some time to grow on me personally, which is unfortunate because I've come to really love it. I blame Peter DiStefano's immediate use of a wah pedal on the first track which was somehow jarring to my ears at first, coming from a Peter Murphy album!

  
My favorite tracks on this one are Face the Moon, The Weight of Love, Give What He's Got, and Emergency Unit. It's interesting to hear an early version of some of the lyrics to one of my favorites of Peter's songs, Uneven and Brittle, on Blinded Like Saul.  On a side note which makes me smile every time I hear it, if anyone else has played some Super Mario games you might agree that the ""Bop bop bop"" on Kiss Myself sounds familiar. 

  
Even if this isn't one I listen to as often as other albums, for me it's become something I love to listen to on a rainy day when I feel a bit moody and want keep mostly to myself, drink coffee or tea, and draw or read a good book.  There happen to be a lot of those here in Seattle.

  
How do you feel about Unshattered?

Nothing fancy, maybe coffee and a walk. Our conversations over text were smooth, said he really liked me, had a lot in common, light flirting, no worries there. But once I asked the question, it took him over 12 hours to respond. I saw that he read my text when I sent it, but never responded until the next night. I know he’s busy with online school, and everyone deserves that space to think or do their own shit. He eventually answered and said that it would be really fun to go on a date. So I was excited! But then I asked what day(s) he was available. Another 12+ hours go by before he answers. Cool, a whole 2 sentences in 2 days, which is different from our regular back and forth chats. Whatever, I’ll keep this up a little longer, maybe he’s just busy or has a weird sleep schedule like he’s said before. Now it’s day three of trying to plan a stupid date and I’m tired of waiting, and having no in between communication. Is he not interested anymore? I don’t care either way, I’d rather be told how it is. Or is he really that busy or bad at communicating all of a sudden?

Can anyone tell me what's up with Eta (from Seven Shades) canonically?,"1. Most people said that before puts Dragon Poison to Cid, Eta gave Cid **APHRODISIACS FIRSTLY**. This is because Eta also said herself that when she gave Beta ""**The first drug**"", Beta's reaction be like crying and open up all her clothes (Get Naked). There is no way a dragon poison makes you drunk like crazy and make you cry and go naked. I jus want to reconfirm because **TEIS community** from **Facebook and Reddit** also said it was aphrodisiacs before dragon poison came first.

2. If the first question about aphrodisiacs is ""wrong"", then who told them about aphrodisiacs? **How do they know it's Aphrodisiacs and why they said they were right about aphrodisiacs**? I want to know why misunderstanding like this happens. Is it even canon? Cause some people said about the Aphrodisiac thingy, that **she was busted by Alpha that Eta tried mixing Aphrodisiacs at Cid's drink at the same time when she was caught going to dissect Akane Nishino**. I am not a novel reader and not a gamer so please forgive me. But I am not stupid about Eta's research journal in Vol 5 of Novel as well. It said like ""but unfortunately, the medicine I tried to use on him did not work. Even when I mixed coffee with the dragon-slaying elixir, he simply said, ""This is a noble bitterness."" Beta also becomes upset and takes off her clothes just from mixing a little medicine, so she is too weak to be of any help""

3. How does Eta views Cid actually? It's not like I doubt ""Truthseeker"" events and Auxiliary chapters made by Daisuke Aizawa. HOWEVER, if we talk about love, **most people told me that Eta does love Cid like other shades as well**. (Not lying they are better at reading and also play the game). Why some people said she's focused only on research, but at the same time people said Eta does love Cid (Some or few of people told me she is also madly in love with Shadow/Cid)

4. Proofs Eta loves Cid? Cause how Eta views Cid/shadow is **different** than how Eta loves Cid.

5. About Eta wanting to have Cid's kids. People told me that Eta's reasons for carrying his babies is for study genetics and genealogy and reproduction system or some sort. It's not like I doubt Eta's past where her parents also doing experiments on Eta. However, yet again, **people's point of view are different and varies one another**. This is because I mostly encountered people who told me that ""Babies for Research and Study are just Eta's cover-up excuses to hide Eta's true intention. Eta also want to marry Cid alongside """,1,1729321188.0,EminenceInShadowRPG,6,1.0,False

----------------------------------------------------------------------

When considering the perfect home for modern living, 1 1/2 storey house designs stand out for their unique balance between style and functionality. These homes offer a distinctive layout that combines the charm of a one-storey dwelling with the spaciousness of a two-storey design. This approach appeals to many homeowners, especially those who seek practicality without sacrificing aesthetic appeal.

One of the most significant advantages of 1 1/2 storey house designs is the efficient utilization of space. With a partial second floor, these homes create a cozy, intimate atmosphere while providing additional living areas. This extra space can be transformed into a guest suite, home office, or recreational area, giving you flexibility in how you use your home. Here are some important benefits:

- **Maximized Living Space:** You get more room without the full commitment of a second floor, making it easier to find a layout that suits your family's needs.
- **Enhanced Privacy:** With bedrooms or personal spaces located on the upper level, you can enjoy peace and quiet while entertaining guests on the main floor.
- **Cost-Effective Construction:** Generally, these homes are more affordable to build than full two-storey houses, allowing for potential savings.
- **Reduced Maintenance:** Lesser square footage means less cleaning and upkeep over time.

Beyond practicality, 1 1/2 storey house designs embrace a range of architectural styles. Whether you prefer contemporary, farmhouse, or traditional aesthetics, there’s a design to match your tastes. This variety allows homeowners to express their personal style while enjoying the structural benefits these homes offer.

An important feature of 1 1/2 storey houses is the increased natural light availability. The design often incorporates larger windows and open layouts, inviting sunlight into the living spaces. This not only makes the home feel more inviting but also promotes a positive atmosphere, enhancing the overall well-being of those who live there.

As you explore different designs, keep in mind that energy efficiency is another key factor. Modern building methods and materials make it easier to construct homes that maintain comfortable temperatures year-round. Here are a few ways energy efficiency is packed into these designs:

Check Details Here: https://itrendworld.com/1-1-2-storey-house-designs  
  
- **Strategic Orientation:** Positioning your home to maximize sunlight can significantly lower heating costs.
- **Insulation:** With advanced insulation technologies, you can minimize your home's carbon footprint and keep energy bills low.
- **Sustainable Materials:** Choosing eco-friendly materials can enhance durability while also being kind to the environment.

Another strong point of 1 1/2 storey house designs is their adaptability. Whether you have a growing family or prefer a less crowded living environment, these designs can evolve with your needs. Adding or modifying spaces becomes a much simpler task with this flexible structural approach. Homeowners can personalize their homes, creating tailor-made environments that suit their lifestyles.

If you're considering integrating outdoor spaces, the design layout allows for beautiful patio areas or gardens to complement your indoor living. The blend of indoor and outdoor spaces can enhance your home entertainment options, making it perfect for barbecues, family gatherings, or simply enjoying a quiet evening under the stars.

For those with specific lifestyle aspirations, 1 1/2 storey house designs can also accommodate the needs of multigenerational living. The layout can easily support elders who may prefer not to climb full flights of stairs, providing them with a comfortable space while keeping family closeness intact.

Exploring 1 1/2 storey house designs reveals various advantages that cater to modern living. From maximizing space to allowing for increased privacy and energy efficiency, these homes present a well-rounded choice for new homeowners. With diverse architectural styles and adaptable layouts, they form a practical yet stylish option that meets today's needs for convenience, comfort, and environmental consciousness.

Creative Interior Design Ideas for 1 1/2 Storey Homes
-----------------------------------------------------

Living in a 1 1/2 storey home offers a unique charm and functionality that many people appreciate. These homes provide the perfect blend of cozy living on the ground floor while offering additional space on the upper level. When designing the interior of such a space, creativity is essential to maximize the potential of every square foot. Here are some innovative interior design ideas to help you transform your 1 1/2 storey home into a stylish and comfortable haven.

### Utilize Open Spaces Wisely

Open floor plans are a hallmark of modern design. In a 1 1/2 storey home, you can create a seamless flow between rooms. Consider using decorative screens or furniture layouts to define spaces without closing them off. This approach maintains the airy feel of your home while allowing each area to have its own identity.

Check Details Here: https://itrendworld.com/1-1-2-storey-house-designs  
  
#### Tips for Open Spaces:

- Choose multifunctional furniture, like a coffee table with storage.
- Use area rugs to delineate different zones.
- Add lighting fixtures to highlight specific areas, such as a dining nook or living room.

### Maximize Natural Light

Natural light can transform your home’s ambiance. Since 1 1/2 storey homes often feature high ceilings and large windows, take full advantage of this characteristic. Incorporate reflective surfaces like mirrors or glossy paints to amplify light. This not only brightens your space but also creates an illusion of a larger area.

#### How to Enhance Natural Light:

- Opt for sheer window treatments that let light in while maintaining privacy.
- Position mirrors opposite windows to reflect light deeper into the room.
- Choose light, neutral colors for walls and furnishings to keep the space feeling airy.

### Create Distinctive Levels

The two-storey element of a 1 1/2 storey home allows you to play with levels. Consider using steps or small risers to create defined areas for different activities. For instance, a small step-up nook can serve as a reading corner, while a slight step down might create a cozy conversation pit.

Check Details Here: https://itrendworld.com/1-1-2-storey-house-designs  
  
#### Ideas for Distinct Levels:

- Incorporate a sunken living room for an inviting gathering spot.
- Design a raised platform for your bed to create depth in the bedroom.
- Build a step-up study area surrounded by bookshelves.

### Functional Use of Vertical Space

Utilizing the vertical space can make a significant difference in a 1 1/2 storey home. Install shelves, tall cabinets, or hanging decor to make the most of your height. This approach not only adds storage but also draws the eye upward, which can enhance the overall design.

#### Ways to Use Vertical Space Effectively:

- Install floating shelves to display books or treasures.
- Create a gallery wall with framed art or photos that leads the eye upwards.
- Consider built-in cabinets that rise to the ceiling to maximize storage.

### Cozy Spaces with a Personal Touch

Even in a smaller home, you can create areas that feel intimate. Curl up with your favorite book in a custom nook, or design a corner with cushions and soft throws for relaxation. Personalize your home with unique decor, such as artisan crafts or items collected during travels.

Check Details Here: https://itrendworld.com/1-1-2-storey-house-designs  
  
#### Personalizing Cozy Spaces:

- Add potted plants to bring life into your cozy corner.
- Use textured throws and pillows for visual interest.
- Incorporate family photos or whimsical art to infuse personality.

### Using Color and Patterns

Colors and patterns play a vital role in shaping the atmosphere of your home. In a 1 1/2 storey house, bold accent walls can create striking focal points. Use patterns in your furnishings to add depth, but balance them with solid colors to avoid overwhelming the space.

#### Color and Pattern Suggestions:

- Choose a soft color palette for larger areas to keep the space feeling calm.
- Incorporate patterned throw pillows or rugs that complement your primary color theme.
- Experiment with wall decals or removable wallpaper for a quick change.

With these creative interior design ideas, your 1 1/2 storey home can become a reflection of your personal style and taste. Embrace the space and let your uniqueness shine in every corner of your home.

### Conclusion

1 1/2 storey house designs represent a perfect blend of style and functionality that is well-suited for modern living. These homes offer unique benefits such as enhanced space with designated areas for both everyday activities and leisure pursuits. By maximizing their vertical space, they allow for spacious second-floor living, making them ideal for families seeking room to grow without the complications of a full two-storey structure.

When it comes to interior design, the creativity inspired by 1 1/2 storey homes is both exciting and practical. The open layouts and soaring ceilings present endless opportunities for making a space feel airy and inviting. Consider using light colors and strategic lighting to brighten up your home, or introducing multifunctional furniture pieces that maximize comfort without sacrificing style. Nooks and crannies can become cozy reading corners or play areas, making every square foot work for your lifestyle.

Ultimately, investing in a 1 1/2 storey house design not only enhances the living experience but also opens doors to personalization. Whether you're an aspiring homeowner or wanting to renovate, these designs encourage innovative thinking and provide spaces that reflect your individuality. As you explore options and draw inspiration, remember that the right design will not only meet your functional needs but also create a warm and welcoming environment for family and friends. Embrace the charm and practicality of these homes, and tailor them to fit your vision of modern living.

The thing I noticed about doctors and sleep is you either get one that doesn’t care and tells you to go outside more, and drink less coffee or you get one that shoves medication down your throat until you are so broken, so desperate. Then they take meds away, and you go through withdrawals alone, or even worse… the medication causes new issues.

I’m sure that insomnia is probably ranked as one of the largest issues of many countries but people suffer in silence. No one wants to take brain altering medications. We just want to fucking sleep.

I (18F) am a first year college student, so I have had a huge change in life such as moving into a dorm (even though I am an in state student, both my parents and I agreed it would be a good chance for me to learn how to be independent). Growing up I had been the social outcast at my school so I never really had any close friends I felt comfortable enough to talk about more personal matters, but as of the last couple years have made some really great friends online through a project I made.

Seeing as I've become really close to these people, I started talking about my home life and just stuff that, while personal, I thought was natural and normal to experience. Apparently being constantly blown off by your parents by being told ""you don't know better"" or having them joke about how you are the dumb one of the family or the first pancake so you're ""not perfect"" is not at all natural or healthy. Yes, I've come to realize this now but back then I genuinely had no idea since I had nothing or no one else to go off of.

My friends, along with a few other people I have met through work and such have helped me to realize I should be tested for ADHD due to having many behaviors that line up with the inattentive type such as a severe lack of motivation, time blindness, and so on (the list of reasons is actually pretty long). This has caused a lot of conflict within my family as my mother would check on our grades multiple times a day, down to each every individual assignment, to question if I had already done something or why I was below a B on anything which was pretty stressful on top of the fact I attended an academically competitive private school that ranked their students by how many AP classes they took.

However, another reason why I mentioned being tested for ADHD is when I accidentally slipped and told my sister (16F) I was thinking about how I might have it, she went to tell my mom and they both cornered me one day to tell me I don't have it and that it was absurd I even thought I had something. They both went on to say my generation is so obsessed with being put under a label and I should know better than to follow such stupid trends.

This is when I really realized just how often my family looked down on me and didn't exactly treat me right. My mother, while in public, is typically a very nice woman who cares for everyone, but in private back when I was in elementary she has even told me that as a teacher aid she expects much more of me than she would her students. She said she felt slightly bad for it but never backed out on the behavior.

Come middle school and throughout the years I lost a lot of friends and went through a lot of toxic friendships, my school was full of a lot of entitled people who were definitely more interested in social media and trends while I was more into art and video games, I came into trends later but people still found me to just be super weird so I was sort of seen as the ""pity points"" person to hang out with lol. This caused me to go from a very hyper and sociable kid to a very generally closed off person as I never really found someone I could talk about my true passions with (believe me, I am beyond happy to now have my current friends, I can talk to them about anything and everything and just feel appreciated). My mother was not happy at all to see I wasn't a social person like her, who always could spout an endless stream of words, even to people she didn't like because she's always gossip about them to me and my family.

Being unsocial resulted in my mother commenting a lot about different things about my personality and the way I presented myself. She always said that I was at fault for being alone because I never tried (I had in the past but after some repeat toxic friendships I was scared to really involve myself in another) and would point out all my ""weird"" aspects. I walk weird, I dress too weird or manly (I recently realized I am non-gender conforming and I just like multiple different fashions), I present myself as not smart, I lack common sense, and just many different comments she made about how I wasn't like her during her teen years. As if I already didn't have a low self-esteem, this definitely made it worse. To this day I constantly find myself doing something or presenting myself a certain way and instantly thinking ""What would mom think?"" and it would always be something negative. One of my friends even mentioned that it feels like my mom is the voice of anxiety in my head since I comment so much about what she would think of me.

High school came and went and I think my only successes was I passed all my classes, gained a love for theatre (which fortunately because she was a theatre kid), and graduated with acceptances and scholarships from multiple different colleges. She always complimented me on my achievements and talked about how great I was to her friends... which I will acknowledge, but most of the time whenever I did something wrong I got an internal sense of panic because it would always feel like the one assignment I didn't get a good grade on was the end of the world apparently.

While there would be times I would rebel and try to say the way i was being treated was unfair towards me or hurt me, my mother would become sensitive and say ""apparently I'm not a good mom"" or ""I guess I'm just making everyone mad at me, aren't I?"" and would instantly go to being the victim. While my father has been getting better at not letting that get to him, he will talk to me in private and tell me to be a better daughter because ""Mom is just sensitive and does a lot for you, so even if she is hurting you, just nod and say okay and then it will be over."" Another thing that my parents have done which I've come to learn is not normal is constantly talking about the amount they spend on you as a reason to be grateful for them. My parents will constantly talk about the price of gifts or items they got for me-which, taking the silver-lining, has made me pretty aware of how and what I spend my money on.

So, getting to the main question I had come here to ask after that overwhelming chunk of context (sorry) is that I am in the middle of my first semester at college. I have been struggling greatly to make friends in person here but did make friends with this one guy in a class I have to take for my game development major. He seemed nice at first but eventually became super pushy in subjects with me and seemed to just appear everywhere and latch onto me and I could just not get away from him. Thing is I didn't really see this concerning behavior until one day where he had invited me to hangout with him and play on an arcade machine on campus at this one student hangout place. It was originally to complete an assignment reviewing older arcade games, but devolved into him following me to the bookstore to get a chai latte at the coffee shop and then to my dorm building. I thought we were done there and tried to hint at it a lot, but eventually I just got overwhelmed and wanted to get back to my dorm. He followed me into the elevator, where I thought he was just making sure I made it back to my room safe, but then he followed me back all the way into my room. It is safe to say I learned a lot about setting boundaries that day, especially considering this next part. I had quickly left because when I asked him if he wanted something to drink he asked for water and I had to refill my jug at the filtered water station down at the end of the hall. I came back and he was bringing out his gaming laptop and pulling up a game I had already told him I had no interest in playing because it was a horror one and I just don't do good with horror. I felt pressured to play so I gave it a go and when it got to a real scary part, he came over to me and started rubbing my back... and rubbing... and rubbing. I counted the clock and he just kept going for five minutes straight and I was super uncomfortable because this guy didn't even ask for my consent or anything. I know this could've been seen as an act of comfort, but seeing as we had only hung out once or twice after class, I really felt uncomfortable on top of the fact I sort of felt why this was why he had forced me to play this game.

I quickly found a spot to stop, told him I had homework, and FINALLY got him to leave. But after that, it felt like wherever I went he was just... there. Whenever I left my dorm to eat, he was sitting near the entrance and if I pretended not to notice him, would follow me all the way to the back of the dining hall as I was getting food. He would suddenly appear as I was walking to different classes and so on. This was also weird because his dorm was a twenty minute walk away from mine, so seeing him constantly around my dorm building skeeved me out a bit. I totally could've been paranoid, but on a relatively large campus full of tens of thousands of students, my gut was telling me these constant daily meetings were not just a coincidence. I honestly felt unsafe just trying to leave my dorm and realized just how creepy he was acting towards me in different previous meetings.

I asked a few different people and they told me to just tell him straight up that I was not interested. Even when I told my mom about it one weekend while I was visiting, it took me bursting into tears and crying that I didn't feel safe for her to realize ""Oh, he's really following you... isn't he?"" And even after that, she just thought I was being a silly paranoid girl who was just scared of men.

Anyways, when he had asked if I could hangout again for the second or third time, I messaged him apologizing that I hadn't made it clear sooner but I was not looking for a relationship (which really, I am not) and that it felt like he had been coming on to me and it was honestly making me uncomfortable. I'll give him credit in that he was very polite in his response, replying with ""Okay, thank you for letting me know. I'm sorry for making you uncomfortable and I understand."" I haven't seen him since aside from when in class, which I will sit on the opposite side of the lecture room.

When I had told my mother this, the first thing she had said is, ""I feel bad for him."" And asked if I felt bad and that I probably broke his heart. I will say in that moment... I sort of came to the conclusion that my mother would always love the image of me more than she loves me. In that moment, I had never come to despise and, regrettably, hate her more. While I definitely could've handled the situation better, I got no teaching, comfort, or anything from her other than her blowing off my concerns and telling me I was being unreasonable. And that hurt me, a lot. I thought my mom was supposed to help me when this stuff happened, not make me feel alone and like I'm the villain. What confused me even more was when we would talk to other families and friends, she would say the story as if she had took my side and this boy was a creep, which I notice she does with a lot of stuff she usually blows me off on. I will say I do not regret listening to my gut, but there still was a part of me that made me go to my friends to ask if I should feel bad, only for them to respond that he had made me feel uncomfortable and unsafe in the first place, and he had no excuse to act the way he did, even if he really was infatuated with me.

I also relayed on to them what my mother said and how I don't feel like I see her as a mother anymore, just someone I can only enjoy when out in public because she doesn't show her true colors and they also advised me on possibly going low contact with her, and even moving states (I am considering moving states after college to live near one of these friends as she has been my rock. I am visiting her this summer first just to see how it is there and to finally be able to hang out with her in person). The idea actually does seem really nice because I can say I'm not exactly happy in the state I live in currently and I do want to travel around the world in the future. I also do feel like I need some good distance from my parents to figure out who I am as my own person and to create a life for myself. I had stated my parents are good people, just not good parents, but have been told by others, especially with my mom, that they are narcissists who have used me as a social asset. I honestly believe that they have their good moments and I shouldn't cut them out of my life entirely because I still do love them and they have done a lot for me, but I also just can't stand being take so not seriously all the time and being looked down on.

So... would I be a horrible daughter if I go low contact and move to another state, even after everything they have done for me?",1,1729320777.0,Advice,0,1.0,False
1g7370l,https://www.reddit.com/r/MarkMyWords/comments/1g7370l/mmw_someone_is_going_to_steal_or_destroy_a/,MMW: Someone is going to steal or destroy a significant number of ballots in a swing state.,"I believe at some point between now and Election Day, some person or group of people are going to conspire to or attempt to steal or destroy ballots in one of the several swing states this election. Most likely a radicalized supporter of or nefarious actor for Donald Trump. I don’t have a guess as to the level of coordination with his campaign, if any, or exactly what could be fraudulently mishandled—the actual paper ballots, the actual voting machines, their digital vote tabulations, the voting software, etc.—but my guess is someone will attempt and possibly succeed in removing from the tabulation a portion of votes cast in some important county of a swing state. Perhaps one that just so happens to have a big urban center.

I also believe, though, that this fraudulent act will be discovered before it’s too late to reverse, or even before the plan is executed.

My reasons for thinking all this are as follows:

* A significant portion of Donald Trump’s supporters have been radicalized against their government—particularly its judicial and electoral systems. Many people have been made to believe that the elections themselves are fraudulent, that the officials and machinery conducting it are corrupt and possibly changing votes, and that the judges and prosecutors who monitor these elections are just as corrupt or complicit. If you believed this was happening in your country, why would you not want to stop it, or help your guy out? “They’re doing it, why can’t we?”

* This seed of distrust has grown, first sprouting a violent assault on our nation’s Capitol in the last election. Why should we not expect more outgrowths of obstruction and violence? 

* Sure, the bad actors and true believers are not running the executive branch this time around, stymied in their ability to aid or direct radicalized supporters or other bad actors like the Proud Boys, but for one, that doesn’t mean they are not running local election offices and procedures. They are. And two, that has not stopped Trump and his allies from trying to foment this sort of bad behavior all the time, right now, as you read this.

* As well, a voting machine is an easy target. It’s less well protected than the Capitol, it’s closer to home than the Capitol, it’s a less obvious target than the Capitol, and it’s lower stakes to break into a county election office on a quiet Sunday night than the Capitol. Any random person could do it if they really wanted to. And Donald Trump’s election lies have made many people want to.

* Any number of the usual rejects, hangers-on, sycophants, and true believers in Donald Trump’s orbit have a number of reasons to think it’s their ticket to power if they can conspire with any number of others to try and tamper with this election, as they did last time. Think Roger Stone, Steve Bannon, Sydney Powell, and many others.

* In fact, prosecutors have shown in federal court that Trump’s team **did** conspire with a group of people in the last election to gain physical access to voting systems in Coffee County, Georgia. They are now being tried for it.

Many more **will** fall on this sword for Donald Trump—who, when, and how are the only questions.

I have known someone since middle school and have had off and on interactions with him. A couple years back during quarantine we used to message back and forth everyday for a good couple months until it fizzled out and he ended up getting a girlfriend. I distanced myself heavily and it made me think well maybe he was just being nice as a friend. Flash forward to now, I am in college and have a job and extremely independent due to the fact that I am insanely pessimistic about relationships because of experiences I have had and well, the lack of any dating. I hadn’t truly had a connection to anyone besides this guy because of how genuine it felt with him. Recently I saw him back on the internet after being off of it for a while posting about a different state he has been working in, 
I decided to reply and we got back to chatting again. He is now back in our state but still working out of town in the mountains. We have now been messaging back and forth everyday it seems like for a month. I had asked him to get coffee but he canceled due to his high demand job. I don’t know when this project is over but I am starting to think maybe I should just stop engaging. He expresses his interest in what I’m doing and says he wants to hang out but it’s just hard for me to believe because I just feel like it won’t happen. I wish it could be more of an in person deal but I know that’s not really an option for him right now. Sometimes he won’t message back for a while or he will have shorter messages so I get a little paranoid that he’s trying to stop the communication but he keeps it going. What should I do? Should I move on and just try to forget it even though I already feel pretty attached? I really like him and honestly always have. It’s just I haven’t seen him in person in a good while. I always distilled it down to being a stupid crush that should have died out in middle school but who knows.

She convinced me to see a doctor and ask for psych referrals and anti deps. I'm on 50mg of Zoloft a day, currently on day 2 and I gotta say, loving the placebo. I know there's hardly any chance it's already had an effect, but I'm excited to give this a try and see if prescriptions are something I've been missing all these years and I guess the anticipation has already put me in a better state of mind. 

I also got a blood test that checked for basically everything, since my depression and anxiety come from a possible binge eating disorder, (unconfirmed, seeing a psych soon) and my new doctor thought it best since I had no medical history to get some general details overall. 

The results made me really happy and I've been telling everyone about them. It's not perfect, but it's way better than I expected. I'm morbidly obese (23M) and had just assumed I'm prediabetic, or basically on the verge of having developed Type 2, but I'm only just barely over the comfortable insulin max, it's still something I need to work on and aim to lower, but my doctor said she wouldn't even call me close to pre diabetic. I guess rigorous sports as a kid has paid off.

There's other stuff in my blood I can fix, like urate, HDL and vitamin D, but my ego has jumped considerably. Now I know I pitched this as a rant, but I do have a question for anyone who has read this far.

I never drink coffee, like ever, purely cuz I don't love the taste, but my doctor said that maybe drinking coffee could help my liver, so once yesterday morning and this morning, I had a coffee after my Zoloft.

1. Is this a bad idea to mix caffeine and anti deps? Especially since I've never had either over a period of time?

1g734x6,https://www.reddit.com/r/datingadviceformen/comments/1g734x6/what_to_text_a_girl_who_is_ignoring_you/,What To Text A Girl Who Is Ignoring You,"In this guide I'm going to show you some powerful texts you can use if a girl stops responding or is ghosting. Let’s face it attractive girls on dating apps have a LOT of options and it is very likely that at some point in the convo she will leave you on read. This will teach you how to handle these situations correctly, which will significantly increase the odds of her responding and you getting the date

**So what do you if she stops responding?**

You would send her a takeaway text. If you’re not familiar with this, a takeaway is essentially the text version of pulling back (Examples: “Don’t think too hard now” or “If you’re too nervous, id understand”

Takeaways if used correctly are very effective at getting the girl to respond. The main rule is that the takeaway you use, needs to be appropriate for the situation. For instance, if the girl forgets to respond once, you would not want to use a very harsh takeaway, like “Look, if you’re not into this, just lmk so i can stop trying”. Instead you would want to use a mild one.

**3 best takeaways if a girl doesn’t respond**

**1) “Don’t think too hard now”**

This is a mild takeaway that is very good for situations when the girl doesn’t reply to your question. Just wait a day or two to use it.

Here is a real life text exchange i had

Me: What night can you do this week?Girl (doesn't respond)Me: Don't think too hard nowGirl: Lol i forgot to respond, sorry

\*\*You can find more example in the original article, linked below\*\*

**2) “If you’re too nervous, id understand”**

This is a mild to moderate takeaway which is very effective for situations where you’re trying to set up the date and the girl stops responding. It can also make a good tripple text if your first takeaway doesn't work. Here's another real life convo

Me: (sends voice memo)Girl: (doesn't respond)Me: Thinking very hard i seeGirl (Doesnt respond)Me: If you're too nervous id understandGirl: How are youMe: Good are you still interested in meeting up?Girl: I am. Let's go to dinner or coffee. When are you available?

**3) “Are you always this talkative”**

This is the most versatile takeaway on this list. You can use it any time a girl stops responding (provided you waited at least 48 hours). Like the previous one, it playfully challenges the girl. Here's another one of my convos

Me: Hey its alex from the thingGirl (doesn't reply)Me: Are you always this talkativeGirl: haha yes ;)Me: well, thats gonna make our love a bit harderGirl: (sends me a tripple text)

In conclusion, takeaway texts are the best way to get a girl to respond who is ghosting or being flaky. They allow you to be persistent without coming off as needy.

To add context i am a virgin, i have only ever had two first dates that led to nothing, and i have no male friends so you can say my experience with men outside of family members is next to nothing. we met on a dating app earlier this year but i ended up ghosting because i was actively pursuing another guy. i ended up matching with him again, which reassured me that he liked me enough to not be super deterred by the ghosting. from the start i was vocal about wanting to hangout and getting to know each other in person but because i had two jobs/ was dealing with summer classes and he worked nights our schedules just weren’t lining up. we ended up texting for about a month and then meeting for the first time in early august. we met up at a local coffee shop i like and he suggested we walk around the park next to it. we walked and sat on benches in front of the river just talking. we are both extremely introverted so it took us a while to have a steady back and forth. we talked about some taboo first date topics like past relationships, politics, and embarrassing hobbies. overall i felt like he was a good person and i knew i wanted to spend more time with him even if it was just between friends. we ended up having lunch together and wandering for a bit longer. he paid which made it feel even more dateish which was odd considering that i mentioned that nothing was formal and we were just hanging out at the coffee shop. i just accepted it as a kind deed, its not like i dont pay for my friends meals lmao. we drive to my house and he said he would like to go on a second date (again with the D word), and i just kind of assumed he was being polite just because i felt like i didnt give him much to work with. regardless we go on two dates the next following weekends, spending around 10 hrs with eachother both times. the main takeaways are that he continues to pay and do all of the chivalrous things a guy that wants to date you would do, we hold hands/ hug/ cuddle for the first time, he kind of asks me if i have anyone else im interested, in his words “i bet theres boys lining up at your door, no but seriously are there any?”, he tells me that he will miss me. we continue to text everyday but not much because he sleeps during the day. we fall into a pattern of seeing eachother every weekend without fail. i start going over to his and staying over until 4 am ( i know scandalous). the quality time really starts to affect the way i see him, along with the growing physical intimacy. one night we’re in his room looking at his vinyl collection and he pulls out his grandpas ring and says he’s gonna use it whenever he gets married. and idk if im crazy but he  was looking at me especially intensely. i dont want to delude myself into thinking that he was trying to make a romantic gesture out of it, but i still think that was odd. i just kind of brushed it off bc i didnt know what kind of reaction i was supposed to give but he didnt seem put off or anything so i’m really assuming he meant nothing by it. we still dont talk about what we want, exclusivity, status, and i get the feeling that hes trying to sus me out. for example i’m very afraid of dogs and he has his family dog that he lives with rn so i ask innocently, are you planning on adopting in the future when you get your own place? he was really cold about it and i feel like i gave him the impression that i was envisioning living with him. we kind of maintain an awkward distance and we never go past making out and cuddling. the truth is I’m still battling whether or not i want to go further bc of our religious differences. i want to get married but i have to marry within my religion and he’s an atheist. realistically i don’t want to have sex with a man I’m not genuinely considering as a marriage prospect. i know it seems old fashioned but i would prefer to just wait until i find the one. at the same time I’m testing the waters with casual dating, so i guess I’m just being greedy. fastforward to over two months of seeing eachother, he asks me to hangout with his mom and sister when i thought we were just going to go a date. i turn him down a few times and he backs off, we end up hanging out and its fine no mention of meeting his family. the following saturday we make plans to grab lunch, i hop into his car, but when i say hi his sister responds from the back seat!! i had no warning at all, and idk if its bc of my cultural background but this is a huge no-no. we end up all spending the day together, and when i finally catch him alone later that night his only excuse was that it was last minute. my only explanation for this is that me being at his house so often kind of set me up to have to meet them sooner than normal. its all just very weird because of how uncertain we are. i’m not sure how to take it since hes all the sudden saying that he misses me/ wishes i was with him. he said we should go to Ireland together after i said i wanted to go one day, i still dk if he was being serious but i dropped it anyways. he wanted me to come see him after a minor surgery and be his “caretaker”. i feel like we legitimately have gone from 0 to 100. i feel like me meeting his sister made him more attached to me and i’m worried that he’s already expecting me to behave like a girlfriend without any of the security. my family says it shouldn’t matter bc i wanted to see him casually and i can’t really ask him about what we are without setting the tone of seriousness. i just remembered that he came off jealous when i insinuated i had been in many teslas, (i dont drive for context), he kind of assumed it was a guys car but it was just bc i uber a lot. idk if I’m so inexperienced that I’m reading this wrong and i’m absolutely getting played or if i’m being evil by not laying out that i don’t want anything serious. idk how to go about this bc i am invested in him and it would hurt to just end things here for both of us i think, especially without a proper reason. i’m just scared that I’m getting involved with something that i’m not equipped to handle rn.

For acne sometimes the thing that triggers it is home remedies.
Anything that involves scrubbing is a big no no.
Besan/gramflour masks or packs are okay but aggressively scrubbing it is not.
Scrubs are not recommended during your acne's active phase.
No peel off masks please. I don't recommend them to people with acne or even sensitive skin. It's like kicking a land mine.
Lactose based products for more than an hour.
The milk starts to ferment on your skin triggers your acne even more. Please don't do this.
The mixed creams: fair and lovely, Tibet, archie, golden pearl,sheesha what ever mixed together with a whitening capsule is a bad idea and a nightmare for your skin. It's like straight up Mercury on your face literally. Don't focus on a fair skin focus on a clear skin.
Oils for makeup removal and moisturiser or even cleanser is like giving yourself a chance for those zits. Trust me oils are a red flag.

Overall better home remedies involve neem, aloevera, glycerin, rose water, jaifel/nutmeg, coffee and multani mitti on the face and juices in the body.

Even after Hasan sat there and tried to have a constructive convo about possible solutions and all Ethan did was circle it back to his feelings based on the community’s actions like that of hasans mods tweeting. Let’s get one thing straight, it is only about Ethan’s feelings. But in that light let’s not forgot he used his platform to call frogan a B word, literally sending swarms of “foot soldiers” to perhaps harass her, a way smaller creator than him, why even pay it mind ? 
While all of that was undoubtedly embarrassing for a grown ass man who makes so much money he has his own studio and pays each of his employees a salary, why pay mind to a miniature jab. Even then I was there because he entertains. As of late, Ethan has not only been aggressively bad faith in his weird obsession with Hasan’s broadcast that he has literally utilized “Hasan hate clips” as evidence to say he generates antisemites by the things he allows and advocates for. I have watched Hasan’s stream and H3 at the same time numerous times and some of the clips Ethan showed I have witnessed them Live, literally every clip was cut to show Hasan in bad faith. Now when it comes to the Houthi ordeal, does Ethan not see how shallow he’s being when he immediately acuses a brown, Yemeni genocide survivor who has most likely learned to aspire to be a Houthi from his resistance to the areas’ occupier. It is the equivalent of anyone generalizing Hila to be a “blood thirsty IOF soldier”, we all know all Israelis must serve, and that not all get deployed so when chatters make that generalization it’s the same as when Ethan acuses this survivor (yes that’s what he is) not a Houthi, as a Houthi, it only shows how he is in agreement with the genocidal campaign. To me at least it shows that the Klein family is somewhat pro genocide. Not once in a whole year did Ethan ask AB or Lena about their feelings on it on air for all to hear and thus it was made to suggest that he did not give a crap about their side (the Arab side) that’s something that is important too, especially when AB’s father has such an important role to play in the legal aspect of those in Michigan with family’s being affected. Not once was AB allowed air time to talk about it given that most of Ethan’s fan base are leftists and perhaps before this year a large chunk of Arab descent since the duo joined the crew. One thing he did was donate money to the Palestinians which oddly he won’t let us forget about… as somewhat of a fall back or something. 
But alas, as of late with Ethan calling for a twitch ban on Hasan is utterly invasive, it’s almost like Ethan wants to silence Hasan, the biggest advocate for a ceasefire, statehood for Jews and Arabs in the areas and as of late of constructive conversations. Overall, I am disappointed in Ethan, he does not fit into the box I set for him like Hasan said, I expected him to be more educated on many topics and he has always failed to be, like that of him being a capitalist lmao like dude you hated working when you were a nobody, and now you’re a capitalist?! Ok. Also his whole spiels on communism, as if there’s a chance anyone in this god damn sphere of the world could ever fathom communism, he just makes bad faith arguments and speaks so confidently when he looks so insane while doing so. I always remember on Leftovers Dan and Hasan constantly trying to educate him and him just being contrarian. Anyway if anyone reads this deep, just know you’re not alone in walking away, I literally see no more benefit in being a member, member streams lack effort, I get it they work all week but why have a person pay money to watch a half ass ep that includes ramblings and no fun segments or convos, and now that I know where Ethan stands I guess I’m done? 
Before I go I’d also like to address his whole spiel on antisemitism, while complaining about hasan he kept bringing up the FBI hate crime report, he means to tell the United States of America that today the biggest minority group to be hate crimed are Jews and not Black people? Or perhaps blacks don’t report their harassments as often as white Jews in America? What was the point of bringing up a report that doesn’t take into consideration that black Americans disproportionately report being hate crimed, I live in Chicago and I have only once witnessed antisemitism while working at a coffee shop and a white supremacist began to ramble antisemitic slurs at everyone because he was mentally unwell living in a halfway house across the street. He means to tell America that Jews have been hate crimed more than any Arab Muslim living in America post 911? He should’ve just turned into the college campuses that are reporting large numbers of Jewish students feeling unsafe from Pro Palestine protests. As if the people who are against genocide residing in the US right now aren’t aware that the state department and all of the political entities are all Pro Genocide in this moment except for 4 individuals: Bernie sanders, Rashida Tlaib, AOC and Ilhan Omar, like be so for real. There is no clearer reason to Ethan’s actions, he wants to come out in full support of Israel no matter what is happening because if he were to stand against genocide it would in his brain and to his family mean that he is against a Jewish state and somehow that Israel should be demolished, in his brain. The avenue he took jumps over the uncomfortable talks he should be having at home about genocide, about resistance and about being ok with a state solution, it shouldn’t focus on antisemitism because for the love of god criticizing ZIONISM is not antisemitism, Zionism if Ethan researched and read like most scholars is the idea of a ONLY Jewish ethno state that suppresses all religions and ethnicities, in the Zionist mind the Arab is “less civilized”, a Zionist does not have to be Jewish, in fact many Christians are zionists for their own sick religious beliefs of Jews being inferior to them. At the end of it all religion always serves the interest of the fascist, please y’all get out of your head spaces and for a second consider that conflating the two terms is dangerous, Jewish people all over the world have been persecuted for being Jewish, I don’t see how Jewish Zionism will help that case in todays genocidal actions that the Israeli government is partaking in. Just two days ago Israel killed the Hamas leader, this doesn’t mean the war is over, there was never a war only destruction to make room for a full reconstruction of the Gaza Strip and perhaps parts of Lebanon to be concessions to Israel. For those who are educated on the history, WWI never ended, WW2 never ended, the Cold War and the establishment of an apartheid regime in the Palestine region have brought us here. At the end of the day I wish for all of you to read more on the matter and get educated, question your friends and family when they immediately get offended that you support Palestine, in their brain you are supporting terrorism because in their brain Islam = terrorism, at the root of it all they are racist, and white will always be safer than brown in their eyes. Don’t allow people to utilize antisemitism as an avenue to justify Israel’s atrocities’, in the violation humanitarian law, international court of justice decisions that suggest Netanyahu needs to be in jail. Don’t allow people to conflate the term Zionist with that of being Jewish. Listen to Hasan as he aims to educate, not glorify Houthi’s, as part of journalism we must be able to be exposed to others’ experiences, and those include those who have been fighting occupation their whole lives, to the point that all they know is bloodshed, like that of Motaz who was on Hasan’s stream recently, if you’re not a Zionist you will go back and watch that and sympathize with Motaz because he is only 25 and he can’t even crack a smile from the internal urge to save his people. At 25 he looks 40 from all that he’s lived. 

It’s sad because I’ve loved H3 for almost 10 years, I understand where they stand and I personally cannot continue to support when they don’t address the elephant in the room, especially when they have 2 Arab employees and Hila is Israeli, it doesn’t kill your base to talk about the issue instead of ignore it for a year, more than 100k have been flattened out in Gaza and Lebanon has been invaded, hilas family lives in Israel but yet ignore until you have something to nitpick from Hasan’s continuous coverage of the issue. Hasan has been a pro Palestine advocate since his early Facebook stream days and TYT but now Ethan has a problem with his coverage. 
I wish the best for all the foot soldiers who are sticking around still, let me know when it’s a fun stream I guess, for now I’m gonna devote my 4 hours to getting educated on the matter, hopefully the genocide can stop and the U.S. can mend a two state solution, we sure have money for it evidenced by the billions of tax dollars being poured into bombs to flatten out baby’s.

# Background

I was a D1 Rower in college and had only ran casually for cross-training. In May of 2021, a shoulder injury prematurely ended my rowing career, so I decided to focus more on running and aimed for a goal of running a Boston Qualifier at the Philadelphia Marathon. Two weeks before the marathon, my right lung spontaneously collapsed and put me in the hospital for two weeks. After months of recovery, I began ramping up my training to try again at Philly in 2022  where I ran a 2:47:45 (Race Report: [https://www.reddit.com/r/AdvancedRunning/comments/z10fh5/philadelphia\_marathon\_collapsed\_lung\_redemption/](https://www.reddit.com/r/AdvancedRunning/comments/z10fh5/philadelphia_marathon_collapsed_lung_redemption/) ). After battling on-and-off injuries for a year and missing the registration for the Boston Marathon due to work travel, I decided to give it another shot at the Delaware Running Festival Marathon in April 2024 where I ran 2:35:32 using Pfitz 18/70 and finished 2nd Overall (Race Report: [https://www.reddit.com/r/AdvancedRunning/comments/1cbj6nq/delaware\_marathon\_running\_festival\_a\_podium\_finish/](https://www.reddit.com/r/AdvancedRunning/comments/1cbj6nq/delaware_marathon_running_festival_a_podium_finish/) ). I was injured and sick for 4-6 weeks out of the 18-week plan which is where this 13-minute PR shocked me the most. Backtrack to the Fall of 2023, I had found out that my time qualifier from Philadelphia (2:48) was still valid when applying for a guaranteed entry into the Chicago Marathon 2024. Therefore, given my broken marathon block cycle during Delaware...

# Training

I used Pfitz 18/70 again for the Chicago Marathon. This time around though, I wanted to make sure I stayed injured-and-illness-free. I would spend a few minutes warming up before a run, cool-down after runs with a light jog or a walk, stretch on the floor before I went to bed to keep everything loose, implement plyometrics and strength training into my plan, and take multi-vitamins to try to help my bone strength and immune system. I managed to hit 99% of my training runs. During the MP long-runs, I aimed to run around my PR pace. However, during the 18 miles w/ 12 miles at MP, I averaged 5:43 min/mile, which is sub-2:30 pace. I was feeling off the week I was supposed to run 18 miles w/ 14 miles at MP, so I therefore just ran the 18 miles at Zone 2. There were also multiple weeks where I ran above the recommended mileage usually by running recovery miles on the rest/cross-train. One of these weeks, I peaked at 75 MPW.

I had done one tune-up race during this block: The Philadelphia Distance Run (PDR) Half-Marathon. I lowered my PR from 1:13:04 to 1:11:09. After doing extensive research, gauging the thoughts of running reddit communities, and looking at my training times, I felt that if given the right day, I could go sub-2:30. I knew it would be hard, but it could be within reach.

Similarly for the past 3 years, I have been training solo with no coach or running group/team, and very similarly, throughout the last 18 weeks, I still travelled a bunch for work. I ended up in places like the Pacific Northwest, SoCal, and the South, but I was still able to fly to Chicago in preparation for the...

# Pre-Race

**Wednesday:** My partner and I fly into O'Hare and make our way to the AirBnB. I proceed to go out for a short run at dusk.

**Thursday:** I get in a short, light run with strides at ""Marathon feel"" in the morning. I go to the Expo in the afternoon to pickup my bib and explore some of the stands. My parents surprised me and flew into town where we ended up getting a large, pasta dinner in South Loop. We took public transportation and walking to get there.

**Friday:** I was off my feet for the majority of the day. My brother then surprises me flying into town, and we all end up getting dinner about a mile away from my AirBnB. My partner and I walked to and from the restaurant, totaling 1.5 miles, but that was the extent of exercise we got.

**Saturday:** I get in a short shakeout run in the morning. My partner, brother, and I took public transportation and walked to get a deep dish pizza to share in the city. We then proceeded to shortly walk to bus station to go down to the convention center to see the Expo again where my parents had volunteered to hand-out the t-shirts. We checked out the Expo again, and my partner and I take an Uber back to our AirBnB so I can get off my feet. I check the weather, and the temperature, humidity, and wind indicated that it was possible to go sub-2:30. I had also interacted with u/Optimal_Job_2585 to possibly pace together, in which we had agreed to try to meet up. I end up eating a massive pasta dinner, drinking a ton of water, and getting to bed around 10:00 PM.

**Sunday:** My partner and I wake up at 5:00 AM. I put on my old college rowing racing singlet, some compression shorts, and a light cross country shorts as my race outfit. I proceed to put on a hoodie, sweatpants, and walking shoes (as I want to preserve my Nike Vaporfly 3's for the race). I eat some toast with peanut butter, coffee, and water for breakfast. We take the Blue Line to the Jackson station to get to the starting line at around 6:30 AM. I said my goodbyes to my partner, and I walked through security. It was PACKED, so I immediately take off my warm clothes, change into my VaporFly's, and put those clothes in my bag to drop off at my bag check. I hopped into the long porter-potty line at around 6:50 AM. At this time, and I admit it wholeheartedly: I was the one running late, and me and u/Optimal_Job_2585 ended up not meeting up. At 7:10 AM, I realized my corral was closing in 10 minutes, so I made a bee-line to a nearby bush where other people were also going number 1 and number 2 (sponsored by Dude Wipes, since everyone was given a sample with their bag and t-shirt at the Expo).

Well, for those who don't know: I always run with my phone for music. I train by myself most of the time, so music helps keep me occupied when the roads getting long and boring. Anyways, I had my phone in my pocket when I ran from the porter potties to the bush... you can probably guess where this is going. I go to feel my phone in my pocket...

It's not there.

I immediately start panicking and start jogging (which probably was a good move to start warming up lol) back toward the porter potties to find my phone. I can't find it. I'm frantically saying loudly to everyone around ""Has anyone seen a phone?!"" until 7:15 AM. I realize the time and immediately book it to Corral A. I find my way to the Corral where the guy holding the gate says ""You guys have 1 minute!"". At 7:20 AM, I'm trying to stretch, tie my shoes tight, eat a Gu: just anything to keep my mind from going full panic mode from losing my phone in a crowd of 50,000+ people.

After the national anthem and the minute of silence for KeIvin Kiptum, which was absolutely beautiful and impactful, I found a woman with a phone in the crowd behind me, and I explained my situation and asked if I could borrow her phone to call my brother. She was extremely kind and handed me her phone. I managed to get a phone call through to my brother, who was with my partner, and I explain to him I had lost my phone. He was able to use our shared locations to pinpoint it. He said he had an idea and to just focus on the race; they would be there at Mile 2 to support. So at 7:28 AM, I close my eyes, take a few deep breathes, and calm down as I wait for the calmness before the storm...

""Para-athletes... GO!""

""Elites... GO!""

""American Development... GO!""

# Race

*""****GO!!!****""*

**Start to Mile 2:** I start my watch to record and cross the start line.

This. Is. Unreal.

The amount of people at the Start was bewildering to me as I have NEVER been in a marathon this large before. I knew and prepared for the GPS problems in Chicago, so I don't even bother looking at my watch for the first 5k. I focus on trying to maintain my ""Marathon Feel"" strides as it is nearly impossible to get around all the people consuming the road and gliding through the first mile. I finally find an opening and the right ""feel"" after the first Mile, even with the adrenaline influx from the large crowds of people cheering on all the runners. I come through Mile 2, where I hear: ""GO u/Hang-10 GO!"". I look over, and I see my partner cheering me on, but where is my brother?

""u/Hang-10!!"" It's my brother running at my pace on the sidelines. ""Take my phone. Mom found your phone in the park; see you at the Half!""

That's when I realized my parents ALSO volunteered to help at the finish line, and because they were volunteers, they had access to the Park. They somehow found my phone!

Anyways, I manage to get over to grab his phone and immediately focus back in. I realized I didn't want to waste the efforts (nor guess his passcode) to unlock his phone. Therefore, I kept hold of his phone in my hand as a safety blanket, since I was used to the feel of having a phone in-hand while running. I grabbed some water from the aid station, and went head first into:

**Miles 3 to 12:** I realize I'm averaging sub-5:35 min/mile pace coming through Mile 3, and that I need to slow down. I proceed to reel back to about 5:41 to 5:43 min/mile according to my watch, which seemed to correct itself from the craziness of the start at this time. I find other people running the same pace and asked what their goals were. After a few ""sub-2:30"", we had a small group going.

At around Mile 4, I hear ""YO DREXEL!""

For those wondering what D1 rowing college I went to, you found it. I immediately whip my head over my shoulder. It's another runner: ""You raced at the PDR Half this year, right? I was behind you and ran a 1:12! What are you running?""

I told him I was trying for sub-2:30, and he says that was his goal too! He ends up joining our group and we got a solid rhythm going. As we explore the city at a consistent, even pace, and I take my first two Gu's at Miles 5 and 10 while hitting every water station, we finally reach Mile 12. I hear my name being cheered again... its my partner! I smile and wave to her. Again though, where is my brother.... ""u/Hang-10!""

There he is. Running along the side again. I make my way over to him: ""Here's your phone! Get your music going and fucking send it!"". We exchange phones, I turn my earbuds on, queue my playlist, and we finally got EDM beats blasting in my ear.

You know what the weird part was though? This was the first time where I honestly felt like I didn't need music while running. I felt like I could've ran without a phone in general as long as there were runners on the road and people cheering in the stands.

**Mile 13 to 18:** I come in at the half, and my watch says ""1:14:25"". Perfect. I'm executing the pace I want, and I feel solid. I take another Gu at Mile 15. I'm continuing to hit every water station to battle the humidity and cool myself off.

I don't know how or why, but something clicked when I came through Mile 18. I suddenly get a feeling in my mind and my legs that this race might not go according to plan...

**Mile 18 to 19**: Okay. That's not big deal, maybe sub-2:30 isn't in the cards today. We can still go sub-2:32! We still have 8 miles to go, so let's slow down from our Mile 18 split of 5:45 min/mile to our Mile 19 split of 5:48 min/mile...

**Mile 19 to 20:** I can still feel my leg strength start to slowly but surely fade. Okay! No big deal, we can still PR if we just hang on at our Marathon PB pace. Let's slow down from our Mile 19 split of 5:48 min/mile to our Mile 20 split of 5:55 min/mile... and have a Gu! That'll replenish me!

**Mile 20 to 22:** Okay, legs are still fading, but we can still keep this in control. Let's slow down from our Mile 20 split of 5:55 min/mile and average 6:10 min/mile for Miles 21 and 22. We can still PR if we just hang on for dear life. You got this! What could go wrong?

**Mile 22 to 23:** My vision goes black. The sirens are going off in my head. All I'm thinking is ""Oh No Bro"" (Regular Show reference for those that may get it). Pace drops DRASTICALLY from 6:11 min/mile to 6:47 min/mile. An influx of runners pass me. Let's just try to keep the last 5k under 7:00 min/mile average...

**Mile 23 to 24:** Alright, we're a bit over 7:00 min/mile split, but I think I have enough room to kick it here...

**Mile 24 to 25:** *A shooting pain consumes my left hamstring.* I'm still running but hobbling in what feels like agonizing pain. I'm running, straight-legged through the aid station and drink 3 cups of water, but nothing is unlocking it. I just want to give up. I just want to stop. I just can't do this.

I then notice other runners around me stop running and walk, stretch, and one runner cramped up completely and had to crawl on his hands and knees to the side. Then I hear a familiar voice:

""u/Hang-10! Hang on man, you got this!"" - it was the guy who recognized me and my Drexel shirt from the PDR Half. I yell every other word under a gruntled breath as he flies past me ""Fucking send it!""

I just thought to myself in that moment ""unless my body absolutely fails me. I will. Not. Fucking. Stop.""

**Mile 25 to 26:** Pace at this point is irrelevant. Just finish. The 1-Mile left sign pops up. Just 1 mile of pain and suffering, and we're there. We can do this; we didn't come all this way to not finish. Please just hang on.

**Mile 26 to Finish**: I see the final overpass. I don't care anymore. I turn on the jet engines I have left, which at this point is the horsepower equivalent to what felt like a child in a Little Tikes toy car (A link for reference, NOT A ADVERTISEMENT: [https://www.amazon.com/Little-Tikes-642302M-Cozy-Coupe/dp/B01LY451EC?th=1](https://www.amazon.com/Little-Tikes-642302M-Cozy-Coupe/dp/B01LY451EC?th=1) ).

200 meters left... 100 meters left... My vision goes black again. I don't care anymore. The announcer calls my name as I stumble across the finish.

# Post-Race

My vision comes back, and I see my parents, who volunteered again to hand out medals and beers, right at the front of the finish line. They're smiles quickly turned to concern: My eyes are soulless with no emotion and I'm stumbling forward yet side-to-side just to keep my feet moving so I don't cramp up. I feel my arm being grabbed, and I hear ""Put your arm over my shoulder."" A kind volunteer saw me struggling and helped me walk down the long road back to the Park. My parents come up to me and say, ""Glad to see you got your phone! We'll see you soon as we're almost done."" The volunteer then guides me to get my medal and some water. I couldn't eat any food as my stomach was absolutely nauseous from the experience I just went through. After about 10 minutes of walking, I finally regain my stride and thank the volunteer for her help. I then slowly grab my checked bag and make my way over to the Mile 27 Post-Party. Here, I hop back into my warmer clothes, change my shoes, and check the results online to see my finishing time...

***2:36:49. I missed my PR by 1:17.***

My girlfriend and brother find me in the Post-Party area and congratulate me with huge smiles on their faces. They were both worried that when they saw my splits drop the way they did that something had seriously gone wrong, *referring to my previous collapsed lung*.

I hug my brother, and then I hug my partner, who I've been with since the start of my running journey. I don't know what happened, maybe it was the rollercoaster of an experience I just went through, but as soon as I made contact with her, I just began to cry.

""I was so close."" I told them as I hid my sobbing. ""I didn't even PR. I was on-track to run sub-2:30, and I completely blew it by almost 7 minutes.""

They both reminded me that 3 years ago, I was in a hospital bed with a tube in my ribcage and couldn't even run. Now, I've progressed my marathon time down to a split that wasn't even conceivable to me for more than a 10k when I first started running. It really brought me back to reality and put the entire experience into a different perspective. As I cheered up, we proceeded to find a spot where could hang out while waiting to meet up with my parents.

# Alright u/Hang-10 you talk about your phone too much. What's Next?

Well, in the wise words of South Park: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdjkLIEtVl4](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdjkLIEtVl4)

I spent a few days in Chicago unwinding with my partner, where I also suffered a little bit of the stomach flu the day after the race. We then flew back home from O'Hare the day after where I unpacked, re-packed later that night, and flew out to the West Coast the following morning for work again where I am currently typing this Race Report.

I did manage to remember to register for Boston 2025 in September, and I made the cutoff based on my time at the Delaware Running Festival. Therefore, the Boston Marathon will be my next race where I have my ""eyes on the prize"". Today, I also registered in the ""Fast Runner"" category for the 2025 Berlin Marathon, so hopefully I get a solid chance of making the lottery/cut since my time is under the time qualifier (2:45:00).

Honestly, I don't know what to do from here. I thought when I ran the Delaware Running Festival, I had the capabilities to get into the 2:20s, and based off feedback from other experienced runners, maybe, in a few years and a bunch more miles, hit an OTQ. It's a delusional thought, I know, but it would be awesome if I have the potential to achieve it, to actually try to go for it. Therefore, I ask you all...

# What are your thoughts? What can I do to be better?

# Conclusion and Thank You

Either way, the goal at the end of the day, for me, is to always, ALWAYS, have fun. This is a sport I can see myself doing for many many years, and I don't want to force the joy out of it with burnout. I want to be able to run with a smile when I'm 65+. While I was suffering during this race, as I look back at all the runners I met, the support my loved ones showed, and the absolute crazy support the crowd brought throughout all 26.2 miles of Chicago, it was honestly a BLAST. One Abbott World Major down, five more to go.

I know this was a long-winded race report, but it was honestly a ton of fun to write, and I hope for those of you here that made it this far, you enjoyed it as much as I did drafting it. If you did make it this far, thank you for taking the time to read this post. I hope I continue having fun with running so that I can continue to be able to write these long, sometimes off-topic, race reports.

# Introduction to WordPress

WordPress powers over 40% of all websites on the internet, and for good reason. It's user-friendly, versatile, and has a massive community of developers and users. Here's why WordPress is awesome for blogging:

* **Easy to use**: You don't need to be a tech wizard to create a beautiful blog.
* **Customizable**: With thousands of themes and plugins, you can make your blog look and function exactly how you want.
* **SEO-friendly**: WordPress is built with SEO in mind, making it easier for your content to rank on search engines.
* **Scalable**: As your blog grows, WordPress can grow with you.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Setting Up Your WordPress Blog

# Step 1: Choose Your Hosting

First things first, you need a place for your blog to live. There are two main options:

1. **WordPress.com**: The easiest option, but with limitations on customization and monetization.
2. **Self-hosted WordPress.org**: More control and flexibility, but requires you to manage hosting.

For serious bloggers, I recommend going with a self-hosted [WordPress.org](http://WordPress.org) site. Some popular hosting providers include:

* Bluehost
* SiteGround
* HostGator
* WP Engine (specialized WordPress hosting)

# Step 2: Install WordPress

Most hosting providers offer one-click WordPress installation. If not, don't worry! Here's a quick rundown:

1. Download WordPress from [wordpress.org](http://wordpress.org)
2. Upload the files to your hosting account
3. Create a MySQL database
4. Run the WordPress installation script

# Step 3: Configure Your Settings

Once installed, log in to your WordPress dashboard and head to the Settings menu. Here are some key things to set up:

* Site Title and Tagline
* Time Zone
* Permalink Structure (I recommend using Post Name for SEO)
* Discussion Settings (How you want to handle comments)

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Choosing and Customizing Your Theme

Your theme is the face of your blog, so choose wisely! Here's how to pick a winner:

1. **Decide on your blog's purpose**: Are you a lifestyle blogger? A tech reviewer? Your theme should match your content.
2. **Consider your technical skills**: Some themes are more customization-heavy than others.
3. **Check for responsiveness**: Your theme MUST look good on mobile devices.
4. **Read reviews and check update frequency**: A well-maintained theme is less likely to cause issues down the line.

Some popular theme marketplaces:

* ThemeForest
* StudioPress
* Elegant Themes

Once you've chosen a theme, customize it to make it your own:

* Update your logo and favicon
* Set up your menu structure
* Customize colors and fonts
* Set up your widgets and sidebars

Pro tip: Use a child theme for customizations to avoid losing changes when the parent theme updates.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Essential Plugins for Bloggers

Plugins are like superpowers for your WordPress blog. Here are some must-haves:

1. **Yoast SEO**: Helps optimize your content for search engines.
2. **Akismet**: Fights comment spam.
3. **WP Super Cache**: Speeds up your site by caching pages.
4. **Wordfence Security**: Protects your site from malicious attacks.
5. **Jetpack**: Adds various features like stats, social sharing, and more.
6. **Contact Form 7**: Easy way to add contact forms to your site.
7. **UpdraftPlus**: Automated backups for peace of mind.

Remember, don't go overboard with plugins. Each one can potentially slow down your site, so only install what you really need.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Creating Compelling Content

Now for the fun part – actually blogging! Here are some tips for creating content that keeps readers coming back:

1. **Know your audience**: Who are you writing for? What problems can you solve for them?
2. **Develop your voice**: Be authentic and let your personality shine through.
3. **Create a content calendar**: Plan your posts in advance to maintain consistency.
4. **Use visuals**: Break up text with images, infographics, and videos.
5. **Write magnetic headlines**: Your title is the first thing readers see – make it count!
6. **Structure for readability**: Use short paragraphs, subheadings, and bullet points.
7. **Edit ruthlessly**: Cut out fluff and make every word count.

Tools to help with content creation:

* Grammarly for proofreading
* Canva for creating visual content
* Hemingway App for improving readability

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# SEO Optimization for WordPress

Search Engine Optimization (SEO) is crucial for getting your content in front of readers. Here's a crash course:

1. **Keywords**: Research and use relevant keywords naturally in your content.
2. **Meta Descriptions**: Write compelling meta descriptions for each post.
3. **Internal Linking**: Link to your own relevant content within posts.
4. **Image Alt Text**: Always add descriptive alt text to images.
5. **URL Structure**: Use clean, keyword-rich URLs.
6. **Site Speed**: Optimize images and use caching for faster load times.
7. **Mobile-Friendliness**: Ensure your site looks great on all devices.

Tools like Yoast SEO (mentioned earlier) can help guide you through optimizing each post.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Monetizing Your Blog

Once you've built up some traffic, you might want to start making money from your blog. Here are some popular monetization methods:

1. **Affiliate Marketing**: Promote products and earn commissions.
2. **Display Advertising**: Use networks like Google AdSense or Mediavine.
3. **Sponsored Posts**: Partner with brands for paid content.
4. **Digital Products**: Create and sell ebooks, courses, or printables.
5. **Memberships**: Offer exclusive content for paying members.
6. **Coaching/Consulting**: Use your blog to attract clients for your services.

Remember, building a profitable blog takes time. Focus on creating value for your readers first, and the money will follow.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Growing Your Audience

A blog without readers is just a diary. Here's how to grow your audience:

1. **Leverage Social Media**: Share your content and engage with your audience on platforms like Twitter, Instagram, and Pinterest.
2. **Guest Posting**: Write for other blogs in your niche to expand your reach.
3. **Email Marketing**: Build an email list to keep readers coming back.
4. **Engage with Comments**: Respond to comments and foster a community.
5. **Collaborate**: Partner with other bloggers for joint content or promotions.
6. **Optimize for Search**: Keep working on your SEO to attract organic traffic.
7. **Consistency**: Stick to a regular posting schedule.

Tools like Buffer or Hootsuite can help manage your social media presence, while ConvertKit or MailChimp are great for email marketing.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Maintaining and Securing Your Blog

A well-maintained blog is a happy blog. Here's what you need to do:

1. **Regular Updates**: Keep WordPress, themes, and plugins up to date.
2. **Backups**: Regularly back up your site (UpdraftPlus can automate this).
3. **Security**: Use strong passwords, two-factor authentication, and security plugins.
4. **Performance Optimization**: Regularly clean up your database and optimize images.
5. **Monitor Analytics**: Use tools like Google Analytics to track your site's performance.
6. **Check for Broken Links**: Use a plugin like Broken Link Checker to find and fix dead links.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Advanced WordPress Techniques

Ready to take your blog to the next level? Here are some advanced techniques to explore:

1. **Custom Post Types**: Create specialized content types beyond just posts and pages.
2. **Shortcodes**: Create reusable content snippets with shortcodes.
3. **Page Builders**: Use tools like Elementor or Beaver Builder for advanced layouts.
4. **A/B Testing**: Test different versions of your content to see what performs best.
5. **API Integration**: Connect your blog with other services using the WordPress REST API.
6. **Multisite**: Manage multiple blogs from a single WordPress installation.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Troubleshooting Common Issues

Even the best-maintained blogs can run into issues. Here are some common problems and how to fix them:

1. **White Screen of Death**: Usually a PHP error. Enable WP\_DEBUG in wp-config.php to diagnose.
2. **Internal Server Error**: Often caused by corrupted .htaccess file. Try regenerating it.
3. **Error Establishing Database Connection**: Check your database credentials in wp-config.php.
4. **Stuck in Maintenance Mode**: Delete the .maintenance file in your WordPress root directory.
5. **Memory Exhausted Error**: Increase your PHP memory limit.

When in doubt, check your error logs and don't be afraid to reach out to your hosting provider's support team.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1g72own,https://www.reddit.com/r/WeightLossAdvice/comments/1g72own/advice_needed/,Advice Needed! ,"Hi everyone! Thank you so much for taking time out of your day and reading my post. If I’m honest this is really one of my last resorts to get advice on how to loose weight healthily and quickly (or as quick as I can). 
.
Some information/background about myself:

I am a 20 year old female who has been obese for approximately 7 years now. (Thankfully I haven’t gained anymore weight than I currently am) 
I am 5’3 (160 cm) and weigh approx. 195.50 lbs (88.70 kilo) I started to gain an access amount of weight after I started taking my depression medication (Prozac at the time) and have been told that this wasn’t the reason for my rapid weight gain (just thought I should mention it!) 
I started gaining weight around February of 2018 when I was 14 years old. I worked out everyday since I was in the Lacrosse and Dance team. I was originally approx. 119 lbs (54 kilo) and 5’3 (160 cm). During this time I suffered from depression so I started taking medication for my depression. By the beginning of May 2018 I weighed about 180 lbs (82 Kilo). I have always eaten relatively healthy, only eating junk food every few days and eating at home, making sure to have my side of greens everyday. I have spoken and seen many nutritionists but all of them have said to keep working out and eating as I had been. After months of working out after May 2018, I developed an eating disorder where I mainly binge ate anything I could. Thankfully I haven’t gotten more than 195 lbs (88.70 kilos)
Time-skip to now, October 2024, I have completely lost faith in losing weight. I eat at home everyday (except Saturdays where I’ll buy one meal at McDonald’s) I don’t work out anymore, not having the energy to workout because I haven’t seen any improvement after years of trying to work out to loose weight. I have talked to medical professionals who have told me to just keep eating healthy and workout. I’ve also had a doctor tell me to starve in order to loose weight. My primary doctor has told me to not eat or drink protein based drinks such as ensure since it has too much calories. I eat approximately 900 calories a day, only eating one meal a day at around 1 pm. 
I have recently gone to an endocrinologist for weight loss medication (I suffered from heavy side effects so I wasn’t able to continue with them) I have switched my depression medication to Bupropion. She did test me for Cushings disease and it came out negative (I will include my blood test results) I asked about PCOS (something my friends told me to ask about) and she told me I wasn’t applicable. I’m honestly unsure what to do right now. I’m currently insulin resistant (I do not have diabetes and am in the low range of insulin resistance) I have completely cut out sugar (candy, bread, etc…) I only eat fruits such as Berries, bananas, oranges, and mangos. I no longer drink sugared beverages (only drinking sugar free) I do not drink coffee or tea. 
.
Any advice would be appreciated! I’m truly at a loss of what to do. I want to change my life around but am unsure on how to make that change.
