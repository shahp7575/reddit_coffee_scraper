1gt1nwk,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/1gt1nwk/tifu_by_trying_to_impress_my_new_girlfriend_with/,TIFU by trying to impress my new girlfriend with “gourmet” eggs,"
So, this happened yesterday, and I’m still cringing. I recently started dating this amazing woman. She’s way out of my league—super smart, gorgeous, and somehow thinks I’m funny. We’ve been seeing each other for a few weeks, and last night, I decided to show off my “culinary skills.” Spoiler: I don’t have any.

She mentioned she loves breakfast foods, so I figured I’d whip up something fancy like Gordon Ramsay’s famous scrambled eggs. If you’ve never seen his recipe, it’s basically a delicate dance of constant stirring, taking the pan on and off the heat, and adding crème fraîche at the end. I’d watched the video about 10 times and thought, How hard can it be?

Harder than you’d think.

First mistake: I decided to use the last of her organic free-range eggs because they probably taste better than my generic ones. 

Second mistake: I didn’t know what crème fraîche was, so I substituted it with sour cream, which I assumed was the same thing. (Spoiler: it’s not.)

Things started going downhill almost immediately. I cracked the eggs directly into the hot pan like an idiot instead of into a bowl first. The yolks started cooking way too fast, so I panicked and yanked the pan off the burner, which caused me to knock over her French press. It shattered all over the counter, and coffee grounds went everywhere—including the eggs. I tried to salvage the situation by scooping out the bigger bits of coffee, but there was no saving it.

At this point, she walked into the kitchen to check on me. I was sweating profusely, holding a spatula in one hand and a whisk in the other like I was leading an orchestra of disaster. She looked at the pan, then at me, and asked, “Why does it smell like burning?” I had completely forgotten to turn the burner back down, so now there were bits of charred egg stuck to the bottom.

But wait—there’s more.

Determined not to give up, I cracked open a new set of eggs. Except, in my haste, I somehow managed to fling one directly onto the floor. Have you ever tried cleaning raw egg off a tile floor? It’s like trying to mop up regret—it just spreads everywhere.

By this point, she was laughing so hard she had tears in her eyes. Not the reaction I was hoping for, but I figured at least I was entertaining. I eventually cobbled together something that vaguely resembled scrambled eggs and plated it with some toast. She gamely took a bite, paused, and said, “It’s...interesting.” (Translation: absolutely disgusting.)

We ended up ordering takeout and eating it on the couch while she teased me mercilessly about being the only person alive who could ruin eggs. On the plus side, she said she finds my “chaotic energy” endearing, so I guess it wasn’t a total loss. But yeah, TIFU.

TL;DR: Tried to impress my new girlfriend by making gourmet scrambled eggs, ended up ruining her French press, spilling raw egg everywhere, and creating a dish that tasted like shame and sour cream.

1gt1lvv,https://www.reddit.com/r/fragranceclones/comments/1gt1lvv/my_review_of_moon_by_jo_milano_the_new_york/,"My review of Moon by Jo Milano, the New York Nights clone.","I want to preface this review by saying I do own a decant of NYN for over a year. It’s one my favorite BN9 scents out there, everything from the coffee, caramel to the sandalwood mixes so nicely like it 

With that out of the way, I’m a little disappointed with Moon. It just doesn’t give me that vibe NYN has.  Off the initial blast, I get a strong banana smell that slowly calms down once we get to the dry down. However Moon it’s pretty overpowering. 

NYN does indeed has a almost banana bread like scent to some, but it’s balanced out perfectly with the rest of the accords, it’s like a symphony, caramel and coffee aren’t overpowering and everyone is doing their part. Moon however, to me is Banana, sandalwood and caramel. The caramel seems to be weak. I don’t get any coffee in my nose. 

Moon isn’t a bad scent, if you want to know what NYN smells to, it’s a good pickup. However, if you have had your nose smell NYN in the past, Moon doesn’t hold a candle to it. I do hope maceration can do something about it, but the Banana smell needs a little tone down.",1,1731804446.0,fragranceclones,1,1.0,False
1gt1lvr,https://www.reddit.com/r/twinpeaks/comments/1gt1lvr/returning_to_twin_peaks_s3e9_this_is_the_chair/,"Returning to Twin Peaks [S3E9, This is the Chair]","A strong contender for my least favourite Twin Peaks episode. I felt nothing really happened, and what little did happen, I wasn't a fan of. :(

And what happened? Insane amounts of exposition. The whole Hastings interrogation sequence could be taught in classes of how not to tell a story. Just a big fat load of convoluted nonsense that only serves to elaborate that Major Briggs was in conflict with Mr C and had fled to some ""alternate dimension"". And that's the entire point of the Hastings storyline in the end, just passing a few important tidbits over to Gordon Cole. It's a ridiculous pile of filler. And Lillard's endless blubbering is insufferable. No offense to him as an actor.

Then we have the Bobby storyline, where he's more or less discovering the same thing as Gordon, making that side of the story even more pointless. We have an emotional investment in Bobby and his relationship with Major Briggs, so this is much more engaging. However, I object to the deification of the Major. Him being able to see the future and travel between dimensions is something the writers just pulled out of their asses. What made Briggs so engaging was that he *didn't* really know anything. He doubted the ideology of his leaders, he didn't understand Bobby, he had to take time to consider ethical questions before every action. His worst fear was ""the possibility that love is not enough"". 

The closest Briggs ever got to the idealised season 3 description of him is when he tells Bobby about the dream he had, but even there it's not that he knows Bobby's fate, he's simply choosing to be optimistic about it and conveys to Bobby his love and unconditional support as a parent. That's the beauty of the scene, at least to me. Briggs suspected that he visited the White Lodge once (and not voluntarily), but that was obviously based on a logical deduction. His memories were fragmented. This idea that he would just jump in there to hide from Mr C is insane. 

Now, I realize that this is the writers' way of keeping Briggs an integral part of the story without his actor. I just wish it was handled without compromising the character. Maybe have Briggs disappear first, and then either his wife or Bobby dreams of him communicating the necessary clues. Suggesting that he was taken away and evolved, and is now doing his best to help his family. 

NOTES: 

* Is the plane that passes over Mr C, Hutch and Chantal meant to be Gordon Cole's? That's a nice attention to detail if it is. 
* I loathe the three stooges cops with a passion. That stupid giggling laugh was not even funny the first time. And what's even the point? Those scenes add nothing to the story beyond vaguely elaborating the dead Dougie's life. And omg who fucking cares about Ike the Spike's arrest? Jeez.
* I was surprised to learn that Bushnell's actor was 88 in these scenes. Why is Bushnell still working?? That being said, the detail of him flexing his hand at the sight of the cops is a nice callback to the boxing poster. 
* Coop mournfully staring at the US flag is another well acted MacLachlan moment, but we've been here already. 
* The Andy/Lucy scene is very sweet, and it's always nice to see Ben Horne (cue yet another reused 1990s establishing shot of the Great Northern). Both scenes are again completely irrelevant to what's going on. Give them an ongoing subplot! I don't see why everything has to be so flat and disconnected. 
* Albert taking the piss out of the whole Hastings mystery kept me on life support. I love Albert. 
* The Jerry Horne foot thing was kinda funny in an absurdist way, I smiled that. I'd much rather have him with Ben, though. 
* Chad has a legitimate point about the other cops eating coffee and donuts in the conference room. 
* Is the tube thing that Bobby throws around real?
* The best part about the smoking scene is Chrysta Bell visibly trying to figure out what to do while Lynch and Laura Dern are cool as cucumbers. 
* Why would Major Briggs have two civilians hack a military database? That sounds nothing like him. Couldn't he talk to Gordon Cole? 
* If I'm following this correctly, then Briggs got Ruth Davenport to steal the coordinates from a database, then someone killed Ruth and the coordinates ended up with the impostor Jeffries (who is MIKE or Judy), who then conveyed them to Ray, who somehow ended up in prison for reasons I don't remember. But also both Briggs and the impostor have been communicating with Mr C... like, what the fuck is this?? It's so ridiculously overcomplicated. Is the whole thing just to make fun of mysteries?

Repost cos prev one got deleted.

I am 37, I'm a pretty attractive guy, tall fit nice face good hair white collar nice car well dressed polite and educated. I match with loads of girls on the apps, 100+ on tinder, 50+ on Hinge, 50+ on bumble. 

I'm not converting barely any of them. When I do meet girls it's a kiss goodnight at the most, never a one night stand. I just want hookups but I end up talking relationship talk with them?

I think I might be adhd, could that be why? Thinking to get myself assessed. Maybe I'm just clearly fucking neurodivergent and failing to steer the interaction or maybe I simply have no game. I don't like the idea of being fake and tend to be very genuine. I'm too much of a trad gentleman maybe. I really don't know. I've had some amazing sex with partners but they've all been damaged in some way - past trauma, emotionally unavailable, manipulative, dismissive avoidant, etcetera.

Hi! I am looking primarily for friendship, potentially open to more if it occurs naturally, but not searching for anything more specifically. 

A bit about the type of person I’m looking for: 
I live in western Canada, so a similar time zone to that would be ideal(exact same time zone not necessary, any North American time zone is close enough). I am looking for someone aged 30+(this is a hard boundary). Does not expect constant/instant replies. I would like there to be daily communication, but I’m not constantly glued to my phone. I am looking for someone that is willing and able to put effort into conversation(I will do the same). I am looking for someone kind, fun, maybe a little bit funny, and genuine. Other than that, I’m very open to most other things and am not looking for a specific “type” of person! I’m looking for friendship first and foremost, but wouldn’t be opposed to it if the friendship evolved into something a bit more flirty/feelings develop. That being said, I’m not *looking* for something serious, nor do I have any intention of relocating or anything like that. 



A bit about me/some general interests: 

I love to listen to music, my favorite band since I was 15 lol is Blink 182(have seen them live three times). I like to watch movies and tv shows(who doesn’t?) - I’m definitely a horror girly, but I like other things too! I love ghosts and fall.  I love to shop and get my nails done. I’m a little obsessed with Jellycats. Also a little obsessed with Bobs Burgers.  I love coffee. I’m very close with my family, we spend a lot of time together. I like to try and stay active, and get at least a bit of exercise daily. 
Here are a couple photos of me https://imgur.com/a/5P3SHJq


If you think this sounds like something you’d be interested in, please contact me(chat preferred over DM). Please only message me if you are going to include some context - tell me about yourself, start a conversation based on something I’ve mentioned in my post, it’s up to you but I will likely not spend any effort on “hey” or smalltalk responses.

She used to say it broke her, she was really sad and couldn't even sleep. We met, as friends, but we rapidly connected and we have been together for the last 4 years. Very healthy relationship, barely argue and we fit very well. 

However, a month ago she told me she met her ex at the mall. They had some coffee and her ex apolagized for making her sound crazy at the time which my girlfriend said to me it was good to hear. So far, I was okay with everything and happy she received that validation and closure. However, she then told some more encounters could occur and asked if it was okay. I said it was not my choice, sure, but that I couldn't understand the purpose of wanting to make it something regular. However, I didn't oppose in any way. She was free to go and I said yes (still, I expresses disconfort, greatly). 

Last night we were playing guitar and singing with some friends. My phone was out of battery so I was using hers to see some lyrics. While changing apps, whatsapp was on the background and I noticed there was a thread with her ex that morning. I started to overthink and became very numb. I took her phone to the bathroom and started debating with myself : do I see it or not. I chose not to. However, while this was happening, she was hovering around the bathroom which I thought was weird.. Was she worried about something? 
So I get out.. And I started to feel very nervous. My whole body was shaking out of my control. She noticed and got worried so she asked to talk. She said she loves me and that I am her person. She said they almost met once but it didn't happen so she didn't tell me. I could barely express words. I asked two questions:

-Do you think it would help to see the thread? She said she was unsure but she would prefer if I trusted her when she said nothing was happening and that the conversation was very casual. 
-Are there any nicknames or anything? She said her ex called her beautiful three times but she never reciprocated. 
She said that she wasn't expecting for me to be so impacted or shaking because of this. She said that after watching me like that she will drop any contact with her ex. I said that she didn't have to do that but I don't call beautiful to my ex's, don't even speak regularly and I didn't find the situation normal. She agreed with me. 

Now there are a couple of things bothering me. Why hovering around the bathroom if there is nothing to hide?Why gaslight me not to see the messages and turning this into a situation where I have to prove that I trust her by not reading the messages between them?

**Nationality:** Canadian  
**Program:** Computer Science  
**Length:** 11 months (1 term + pre-gaming)  
**Prior experience:** \~7 years as a software engineer + a bootcamp

**Background**

I'm sitting in the Vancouver airport right now heading back to SF where I've lived since June. I wasn't originally going to post this but a success story like mine would've been helpful when I started.

I've been working as a software engineer for \~8 years now. My career path was not traditional. I dropped out of high school with crippling depression. Never went to university. The first line of code I wrote was when I was working in IT. I stumbled on that job as a lost 20 something year old. The father of the girl I was dating at the time owned an IT business. I wanted to branch out into software so I threatened to quit. He asked me to code for him instead.

That was a great start but I wanted more. I moved to Vancouver, Canada. Tech in Canada isn't great but Vancouver is one of the best options. I started applying for jobs. Hundreds of them. No one got back to me. Not even to reject me. This went on for months until one guy offered to meet for coffee. I thought I hit the jackpot. He actually just wanted to tell me that no one would take me seriously without some kind of education on my resume. He suggested bootcamp.

I went to bootcamp. It changed everything. I got a job before I even graduated. This worked well, I had a career and worked happily for a few years. I started to fall in love with computer science and kept flirting with the idea of going back to school. Not because I needed to but because I wanted to. Every time I tried I failed. Working while studying was too much. Studying without working wasn't financially feasible.

**Enter WGU**

When I found out about WGU I was \~7 years into my career. I had self-studied a ton of computer science. I even stopped working and did a single semester at a community college. That wasn't worth the opportunity cost. But again, WGU. I could pre-game, test out of classes, and keep my job.

It seemed like a perfect fit. There was one big unknown. At this point my main motivation for the degree was getting a visa and moving to the US. More opportunities, better salaries, if you've read this far you probably know where I'm coming from.

I started researching on Reddit and LinkedIn looking for success stories with people like me. A Canadian who moved to the US with a WGU CS degree. Thanks to NAFTA Canadians can move to the US on a TN visa. So had anyone done it?

All I found were questions like mine. Did it work? What do they say about the length of the degree at the border? No answers.

I scoured LinkedIn too. I made a list of every person who was working in Canada, went to WGU, then moved to the US. I contacted every single one of them. And no one responded. Nice.

What choice did I have? It was either WGU or quit my job to study (for a second time). I knew that wasn't going to work for me so I decided to take a chance. I was committed to WGU. I started pre-gaming.

The actual WGU portion of my story probably isn't that interesting or helpful. I took every class at [study.com](http://study.com) that would transfer into WGU. Once I finished all of those, I applied to WGU, transferred the credits, and smashed out the rest of my classes in a single term. I was working the whole time. Working and studying takes a lot of discipline and I didn't always have it. Sometimes I'd finish 2 classes in a weekend. Sometimes I wouldn't do school for a week.

**TN acquired**

It's November 16, 2024. I started pre-gaming some time in October of 2023. Almost exactly a year later and I'm typing this in the Vancouver airport with a TN visa stamp in my passport. It was an incredibly smooth experience. The border protection folks didn't question my degree at all. They were more curious as to why I was quitting my previous job.

If you're still reading, I hope this story was helpful. If anything, it should give you hope. My experience helped me move fast but the most important thing is that, as a Canadian, WGU absolutely can get you a TN visa.

For those of you currently studying at WGU, keep it up. It's worth it. You won't regret it! I'm happy to answer any questions if it helps.",1,1731802950.0,WGU,0,1.0,False

California. Beach. I don't know which one. It was a year ago. A few of these stood out as distinctly not ""beach rocks."" They must have come with the coffee, *I don't know*. Help me appreciate them to their fullest?

*Everything from here on out is about those five rocks:*

**Notable facts:** They are all magnetic and heavier than expected. The picture with two of them kissing is to point out that similar molecules are dancing in those parts.

I understand many red rocks and gray metals are magnetic. That makes sense. But I've never met magnetic flintchert before. The fishing weight is not a fishing weight as lead is not magnetic. The boxy geode does not look like any agate, jasper, or magnetic-flintchert-layered-birthday-cake I've ever seen before. And I have seen probably a couple of those without knowing. Lots of rocks on those beaches ya know? But these are not just slightly oxidized or have a bit of iron to look all orange and red and badass. They have very distinct poles detected by the weakest magnet I could find. On the back of a hygrometer. The gray one with a white crust on opposite faces that's slightly translucent surprised me the most in terms of expected weight and the strength of its magnetism. Oh and as for size, they range from .5""-2"" maybe?

I took one geology class in university and have pointed my pupils at *over one million* rocks. **Anybody who can beat that, could you identify/explain them please?**

Ps. to that person who is higher on the spectrum than me with the same list-completion kink but for rocks/shells, you may do what I cannot and name them *all* for the people in the back. They'll appreciate the *heckoutofit*. I just have to exhibit self control here and limit my request to five.

Pps. If somebody calls the magneticflintchert a form of ""slag""...it will never see the light of day again. Straight into the cactus pot.

Edit: Mistyped the first measurement in the range. Typos.

Starbucks US and China Revenue and Comparable Store Metrics (2018-2024)","Starbucks Corporation (SBUX) has long been a market leader in the global coffee industry, with its diverse international presence driving its revenue growth. This article explores the company’s performance in its two key markets— the United States and China—by analyzing the metrics of total revenues, comparable store sales, transaction changes, ticket changes, and store count from FY 2018 through FY 2024.

# Starbucks US Revenue and Comparable Store Metrics (2018–2024)

# Total Revenues (2018–2024)

Total revenues from Starbucks' US operations have shown consistent growth over the past six years. In FY 2018 Q4, US revenues stood at $3.91 billion. By FY 2024 Q1, this had reached $6.64 billion, with a slight dip to $6.37 billion in FY 2024 Q3. This revenue trajectory reflects the company's strong domestic presence and ability to maintain steady demand, despite economic and seasonal fluctuations.

https://preview.redd.it/h4y0ff00tc1e1.png?width=1798&format=png&auto=webp&s=ac4d05d5cb0ac37ec4ed4250ef10ded32e8a0416

# Comparable Store Sales Change (2018–2024)

Comparable store sales change, a key metric in evaluating organic growth, started at 4% in FY 2018 Q4. The figure saw a dramatic surge in FY 2021 Q3, reaching an impressive 83%, as Starbucks benefited from the post-pandemic consumer recovery. However, in FY 2024 Q3, comparable store sales experienced a slight decline of -2%, reflecting changing consumer behaviors and economic pressures in the latter part of the year.

https://preview.redd.it/nj4zn1q0tc1e1.png?width=1788&format=png&auto=webp&s=018fb2a2f20a043bc4ef562116902978715e2235

# Change in Transactions (2018–2024)

Transactions in US Starbucks stores have been notably volatile. In FY 2018 Q4, the transaction growth was modest at -1%. However, the rebound in FY 2021 Q3 was dramatic, with a transaction increase of 80%, fueled by pent-up demand and increased customer visits. As of FY 2024 Q3, transactions dipped by 6%, reflecting shifts in consumer habits, likely influenced by inflationary pressures and changing customer preferences.

https://preview.redd.it/fnn60pe1tc1e1.png?width=1870&format=png&auto=webp&s=4bea75c231b998ebc1df8390fe7afa17507a2b2b

# Change in Ticket (2018–2024)

The average ticket size—the amount spent per visit—began at 5% in FY 2018 Q4, demonstrating steady growth in consumer spending. This figure reached its peak at 25% in FY 2020 Q3, likely driven by premium offerings and menu innovations. Since then, ticket growth has moderated, stabilizing at 4% in FY 2024 Q3. This steady but slower growth suggests a balanced mix of higher pricing and customer willingness to spend more on premium items.

# Store Count (2018–2024)

Starbucks' US store count has experienced steady expansion, with the number of stores growing from 14,612 in FY 2018 Q4 to 16,730 in FY 2024 Q3. The growth reflects the brand's strategic approach to widening its reach across the country, opening new stores in high-demand areas while also enhancing the customer experience through revamped store formats and services.

# Starbucks China Revenue and Comparable Store Metrics (2018–2024)

# Total Revenues in China (2018–2024)

Starbucks' revenue from China has had a more erratic growth pattern compared to its US operations, reflecting the dynamic economic environment in China. In FY 2018 Q4, total revenues were $669.6 million, and by FY 2021 Q4, they peaked at $964 million. However, revenues declined to $733.8 million in FY 2024 Q3, indicating fluctuating demand and challenges in maintaining the momentum in this competitive market.

# China Comparable Store Sales Change (2018–2024)

Comparable store sales change in China followed a similarly volatile trend. After starting at 1% in FY 2018 Q4, sales surged to 91% in FY 2021 Q2 during the post-COVID recovery period. However, by FY 2024 Q3, comparable sales decreased by -14%, driven by economic slowdown, changing consumer behavior, and increased competition from local coffee chains. The 2024 decline is reflective of a cautious consumer sentiment amid global economic challenges.

https://preview.redd.it/2gm12qa4tc1e1.png?width=1828&format=png&auto=webp&s=dfb63acf244f0b9a96135e77d20e7907e2a41ef7

# Change in Transactions in China (2018–2024)

Transaction growth in China mirrored the sales trajectory. From -2% in FY 2018 Q4, transactions increased sharply to 93% in FY 2021 Q2, driven by the resurgence of consumer activity post-pandemic. However, by FY 2024 Q3, transaction growth fell to -7%, indicating that consumers are making fewer visits to Starbucks stores, likely due to a combination of external factors such as economic uncertainty and evolving consumer preferences.

# Change in Ticket in China (2018–2024)

The average ticket size in China experienced more modest fluctuations. In FY 2018 Q4, ticket growth stood at 3%, peaking at 10% in FY 2020 Q3. However, by FY 2024 Q3, it decreased by -7%, showing that consumers are spending less per visit. This decline could be attributed to economic factors, the rise of local competitors offering more affordable alternatives, and an overall reduction in discretionary spending.

# Store Count in China (2018–2024)

Starbucks' expansion in China has been impressive. From 3,522 stores in FY 2018 Q4, the company grew its store count to 7,306 by FY 2024 Q3. The aggressive expansion strategy in China reflects Starbucks' long-term commitment to this high-potential market, despite challenges in maintaining consistent revenue growth.

# Starbucks Store Count by Types (2020–2024)

# North America - Company-operated Stores (2020–2024)

Starbucks’ North American company-operated stores grew steadily from 10,109 in FY 2020 Q4 to 10,940 in FY 2024 Q3. This reflects a focused effort on maintaining corporate control over a significant portion of their stores in the region, ensuring a more direct impact on operations and brand experience.

# North America - Licensed Stores (2020–2024)

The number of licensed stores in North America increased from 6,831 in FY 2020 Q4 to 7,258 in FY 2024 Q3. Licensed stores offer Starbucks a flexible and low-risk expansion model, allowing the company to broaden its footprint without bearing the full cost of store operations.

# International - Company-operated Stores (2020–2024)

Starbucks has expanded its direct operations outside North America significantly, increasing its international company-operated stores from 6,528 in FY 2020 Q4 to 9,526 in FY 2024 Q3. This expansion is a key part of Starbucks' strategy to maintain control over its brand experience in international markets.

# International Licensed Stores (2020–2024)

Licensed stores outside North America grew from 9,192 in FY 2020 Q4 to 11,753 in FY 2024 Q3. This growth strategy has allowed Starbucks to rapidly scale in diverse international markets while managing risks associated with direct operations.

# Conclusion

Starbucks' performance in both the US and China highlights the company’s resilience in navigating external challenges and adapting its strategy to different regional conditions. While growth in the US remains solid, the Chinese market has faced more volatility, with fluctuating revenue trends and changing consumer behavior. As Starbucks continues to expand globally, the company's ability to balance company-operated stores with licensed partnerships will be key to sustaining its long-term growth trajectory.

In conclusion, while the road ahead may be bumpy, particularly in international markets like China, Starbucks remains well-positioned to maintain its leadership in the global coffee industry, supported by its strong brand equity, expansive store network, and innovative product offerings. Investors should continue to monitor these key metrics to gauge the company’s future potential.",1,1731802266.0,starbucks,0,1.0,False

Dumbledore: ""Go do it yourself! Big D got big plans, big adventures."" 

Snape: (out of nowhere) ""Typical Gryffindor. 20 points from Griffindor for acting like a dumbass who needs to go to St. Mungo's.""

Snape: (as they leave into the Great Hall) ""Shall we go talk to Peeves? I think we need to tech him which way the chandelier unscrews.""

 McGonagall: ""Good idea. But seriously, I should seriously get Dumbledore in St. Mungo's before the first years arrive."" 

Legend says that was the best speech ever given by Dumbledore.

 Sprout: ""Eh, I'm not sure if we are even going today. Some apprentice accidentally did an 'Un-wrapping charm' on him, and he'll need a few days to recover. Man, if I wasn't so worried about my students, I'd be up at St. Mungo's helping Dumbledore."" 

Flitwick: ""Well, we need to find a way to make a break. McGonagall somehow is Headmistress currently in Dumbledore's absence, and she's so strict-momish. Can barely get a break with her around."" 

Sprout: ""And she's never on break. I hope she'll need some coffee when we go steal the forms. McGonagall isn't the best at substitutes; she never needs them.""

 Flitwick: ""I think she's guarding something- throw a dungbomb and run! We'll play Filch 5 Galleons!"" 

\*They run off,\*

 Flitwick: ""I know. This whole thing was unfair.. and she's not even letting us go to St. Mungo's. I think it's because she thinks we're trying to get her in there for a room. Bloody hell, she sure needs it.""

 Trelawney: Maybe if we destroy the rapping memories from Dumbledore, he'll be better.

 Snape: Everybody, put a bunch of thoughts. Let it explode.

And even after it all ended, she still abides by that. It ***had*** been one of the worst days of her life. One that she knew would haunt her for a long time, possibly forever. One that she would rather forget, but likely wouldn't. 

Honestly, she had thought about delaying her duties because of everything that happened. Sure, she was the Mediator, her job was hearing people out and advising them. But she just couldn't do it. Not yet, at least. Her mental headspace was still a mess and she was, like many people, still recovering from the battle. Even if she tried, she knew that she would probably end up making things worse. 

Still, she wanted to do something. Anything that would make people feel better. So she decided to host a campfire. If nothing else, it would at least make some people feel a bit safer and at home. 



As usual, thd daughter of dreams found herself gathering all the material she would need to prepare the campfire: the wood for the fire, a few chairs, blankets and pillows, and of course, the snack table with every snack she could get her hands on: Marshmallows, chocolate, and biscuits (for people who wanted to do smores), M&Ms, cookies, chips, popcorn, etc. And for the drinks, she was able to make the ingredients for tea, hot chocolate, coffee and fruit juice available, as well as water.

With the campfire finally set up, Sadira sat by the fire, warping her a blanket around her, her gaze lost in the flames. It was as if she was looking for any kind of coziness, warmth and safety she could. 

And she was.

Our contractor is still working on the southbound lanes of Johnson Street NE. This past week we did some additional milling of the existing pavement and completed the rest of the asphalt paving. We also finished the rest of the sidewalks and other miscellaneous concrete items as we work hard to complete the project before winter sets in. We are also working on the rain gardens for the project - removing some of the existing soil and replacing it with filter topsoil.

# What's coming up

* Work behind the curbs will continue in preparation for seeding of the boulevards and installation of erosion control blanket in disturbed areas.
* Striping for the southbound lanes will be installed next week, along with additional striping for the northbound lanes.
* Electrical work for the new lighting system and the new traffic signal at Quarry Drive will likely be complete by the end of next week. The new traffic signal will not be operational until next spring due to the time needed to obtain the components. The temporary signal will remain in place until the new signal is operational.
* Note that the contractor has applied for after-hours work (after 6pm M-F) to take advantage of the daylight remaining and the great weather we have had. While they may not be working late every day, it is likely they will work late on most days.

# Traffic impacts

**Traffic impacts – see map below for the detour routes that are now in use for the remainder of the project.** 

**Pedestrians - Note that the route to/from The Quarry has changed - please follow the signed pedestrian route. While the sidewalk on the west side appears to be complete, it is still an active work zone and there is not a crosswalk or pedestrian signal at the Quarry Drive/Johnson Street NE intersection yet.**

[There is no work planned this weekend.](https://preview.redd.it/3wnebe7krc1e1.jpg?width=540&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=18f4da72cd983235b292ccfc1c5520a09d3eed5f)

1gt0n6s,https://www.reddit.com/r/Screenwriting/comments/1gt0n6s/i_wrote_a_script_for_an_snl_sketch_called_goth/,"I wrote a script for an SNL sketch called Goth Love, that was inspired by a recent trip to the Trader Joe's on 2nd and 32nd in Manhattan. ","EXT. TRADER JOE'S – 2ND AVENUE – NIGHT

The *Trader Joe’s* sign glows in the chilly Manhattan night. In the background, the majestic Queensboro Bridge towers over the East River. Its lights sparkle against the darkness. The chaos of the city is deafening as shoppers stream in and out of the store clutching overflowing paper bags.

INT. TRADER JOE'S – 2ND AVENUE – NIGHT

It’s the weekend before Thanksgiving, and Trader Joe’s is packed as VICTOR (played by Mikey Day), has never seen it. Despite being in his mid-30s, Victor is dressed in a black hoodie with silver spikes, black jeans, eyeliner, and a perpetual scowl. He carries a coffee in one hand and a TJ's basket in the other as he skulks through the store.

Victor listens to *The Cure* on his Airpods, the only not-black item on his body. He mutters under his breath as he weaves through the crowd, dodging carts like it’s an obstacle course, resenting every moment that he has to share space with these people.

VICTOR  
(muttering)  
Move, lady. God, it's oat milk, not gold.

Suddenly, Victor glances up and freezes.

VICTOR'S POV: Across the store, standing near the frozen section, is HEIDI GARDNER. She’s dressed in sleek corporate attire and looks professional, confident, and effortlessly beautiful.

Victor is immediately smitten.

MONTAGE BEGINS:

To the soundtrack of *""Heaven Knows I'm Miserable Now""* by *The Smiths*, Victor sways and swoons as he clumsily follows Heidi through the store.

Victor lurks behind a display of Thanksgiving-themed Joe-Joe’s as he watches Heidi compares organic turkeys.

Victor watches Heidi look at stuffing and distracted, bumps into a pyramid of butternut squash which tumble to the ground. Amidst the chaos, Heidi doesn't even notice.

Heidi grabs a box of crackers while Victor ducks behind a cart, narrowly avoiding a stampede of shoppers.

Finally, Heidi stops in the middle of an aisle. Victor takes a deep breath, gathers his courage, and approaches her.

VICTOR  
(stiff, awkward)  
Uh… are you in line?

HEIDI  
(turning, polite)  
No, sorry. Am I in your way?

VICTOR  
No. No, not at all. You’re… good.

Beat. Victor panics, then blurts out:

VICTOR  
Are you single?

Heidi laughs softly, caught off guard but amused.

HEIDI  
Am I single? That’s, uh… bold.

VICTOR  
(awkwardly)  
I just—I mean, it’s the holidays and—uh—you seem like someone who probably has plans, like… with someone? Or people?

HEIDI  
(smiling)  
So… you’re asking if I have *Thanksgiving plans* or if I have *a boyfriend*?

VICTOR  
Both? Neither? Forget it. Forget I said anything.

Victor steps back and accidentally bumps into a precarious stack of cranberry sauce cans. They wobble dangerously.

HEIDI  
(leaning in, steadying the cans)  
Careful!

VICTOR  
(muttering)  
Great. First, I come here for oat milk, and now I’m causing structural damage.

Victor scolds himself like a child.

VICTOR  
Stupid. I'm so stupid.

HEIDI  
(amused)  
Trader Joe’s is basically a war zone right now. I think you’re holding up just fine.

VICTOR  
(defensive, joking)  
You know, nothing says “romance” like dodging a mob of angry shoppers fighting over vegan stuffing.

HEIDI  
(laughing)  
Exactly.

KENAN THOMPSON, a chipper Trader Joe’s employee, suddenly pops up holding a sample tray.

KENAN  
Hey there! Would you two like to try our new pumpkin spice hummus? Limited time only!

HEIDI  
(politely)  
Oh, no thank you.

VICTOR  
(sarcastic, under his breath)  
Pumpkin spice hummus. What a time to be alive.

KENAN  
(cheerful, oblivious)  
Alright, you two lovebirds enjoy your shopping!

Kenan winks and disappears into the chaos. Victor and Heidi share an awkward glance.

VICTOR  
(blushing)  
Lovebirds? That’s—uh, that’s wild. We literally just met.

HEIDI  
(smiling)  
It’s Trader Joe’s. People get weirdly personal here.

VICTOR  
Yeah, it’s the reasonable prices. Really gets people going.

HEIDI  
(laughing)  
Exactly.

A woman with an overflowing cart of frozen cauliflower gnocchi squeezes past, glaring at Victor. He steps aside, almost spilling his coffee.

VICTOR  
So… you said you’re not in line. But are you done shopping?

HEIDI  
(raising an eyebrow)  
Why? You gonna ask me out for a post-Trader Joe’s coffee or something?

VICTOR  
(half-joking, half-hopeful)  
I mean… unless you’re like, married to the guy from the hummus sample table.

HEIDI  
(laughs)  
No, I’m not married.

VICTOR  
(grinning)  
Okay, cool. So… coffee? Or do you want to share this oat milk and talk about how weird this store is?

HEIDI  
(smiling)  
You know what, Victor? Sure. Let’s do coffee. But only if you let me try your oat milk.

VICTOR  
(mock-serious)  
Deal.

They walk toward the checkout line together, weaving through the chaos. *“There Is a Light That Never Goes Out”* swells in the background.

In the distance, Kenan reappears, speaking to the camera:

KENAN  
Hey there! Would you two like to try our new pumpkin spice hummus? It's a perfect complement for your gnawing anxiety about the future and the possible collapse of everything you once took for granted especially basic freedoms—like reproductive rights! Happy Thanksgiving, ya'll!

FADE OUT.

Camping and Hostels.,"Wanted to give an account of my recent trip.  This sub proved absolutely essential and I couldn't have done it without it to be honest. Thanks to anyone who answered any of my questions!

Background. Had a few months off. Decided to go for a 3 month Ticket even though i wasn't sure i'd be travelling all this time.  I got an unlimited ticket as i wanted ultimate flexibility.   I didn't do a load of research before and did a lot of this on the fly e.g. looking into connections in detail, looking for accomodation. For the most part this worked out. It did  of course mean less time looking out the window and reading, but figuring it all out  was part of the fun.

I left **Berlin to Prague** mid August on a saturday morning. The train out of Berlin was very crowded. There was supposed to be seating reservations but clearly this was not being enforced as people were standing. I was very glad i did get a reservation though as it would not have been fun to be unseated on this train .  I accidently got out at Holesovice but walked into the centre from there, which i enjoyed.

I liked Prague and would go back for sure.  A nice city to hang out.  Very touristy in the centre but I liked it anyway. Sat by the river and drank a bier and listened to music.  Went to the old masters gallery, had a coffee overlooking the city and read, worked out in the nearby park.

**On a very rainy monday I got the train to Kutna Hora to see the Ossury at Sedelec.** There is a train station at Sedelec but the trains are irregular and its fine to walk from Kutna Hora hln.  Its pretty easy to get to from Prague central station.

**From Prague I got the train to Budapest**. I dont remember too much of the journey, I think it was fairly uneventful.  When i arrived I looked for where I could book my bed on the night train for the next stage but the station seemed to being refurbished and there didn't seem to be anywhere where I could buy a ticket in person. Looking online it looked like all the beds on the night train i wanted to use were booked and I started to despair but someone on the sub helped out and confirmed tickets were actually availble and the next morning I went to the main station where I queed up and booked the bunk on the night train for the following evening.  Having a phone with a translate function was pretty useful and we figured out what I wanted.

After this I went to one of the thermal baths and went swimming for an hour or so. I stayed at First hostel Budapest 21. I would stay there again. Friendly welcoming staff, clean, felt safe, air con in room, big lockers for by trekking rucksack, bed in dorm with a curtain for privacy.  And very affordable.

**The night train to Bucharest** was the first night train i ever took. Lucky there was a  guy who was a regular traveller who knew it inside and out and showed us where to get the sheets, how to lock the door so we were safe, how to fold down the bunks etc. I didn't sleep that well, a mixture of excitment , the summer heat and the movement of the train.  The train stopped twice at the border with romania for passport checks etc on both sides of the border. After that we could get back in and the train continued.  A few passangers got on and off in the night. The curtain was flapping in the wind and what i could see of the landscape was speeding by.  Around dawn we could see the mountains and I got a text alerting me to the presence of a bear in the vicinity.

From what I remember there was nothing in the way of breakfast so I was happy i'd brought a coffee-milk drink, some nuts and a banana with me.

At the station in Bucharest I went with one of the travellers in my cabin and we figured out where to buy international tickets for night train to turkey.  We didn't have to queue long and I bought my ticket to leave i for a couple of days later.

**Leaving Bucharest for Istanbul** I figured out a couple of things - the train showed up on the board as heading to ""Ruse"" rather than ""Hakali"". Here ""the man in seat 61"" was helpful figuring a few things out.

From what i remember the night train bunks were bigger than the trip to Bucharest and only 4 to a room. The guys i was sharing with were pleasant and pretty knowlegable about trains and shared biscuits so they made good travelling companions. You could get coffee from the conductor but otherwise I don't think you could get any food on board. Stopped at the border with Bulgaria for passport check (the train, was sprayed with what i am told was disenfectant on entry into the country)  and then in the night with the border to turkey. The train arrived about 2 hours  late in instanbul, so around 24 hours, and we then got tickets to the center on the subway. Istanbul is big!

Stayed about 5 days in Istanbul. The city is very busy and there isn't much green space but it is fascinating in some ways. I was a big fan of the lazy street dogs and the people were friendly to me. Got a local ferry (public transport) accross the Bosphorus rather than getting a tourist ferry , which was a lot cheaper.  A lot of the museums etc seem very expensive. Stayed at the Cheers Hostel. Would stay there again. The staff were very welcoming and made a lot of effort to create a friendly atmosphere. Friendly and social, they organise bar crawls and stuff like that in the evenings for those who want to join.

**Istanbul to Athens**  I didn't realise how tricky it is to do this by train and figured out bus was by far the quicker option.  In fact a few people at the hostel were doing the same route and so I booked  the same bus few days after. I'd actually planned to travel back through the Balkans by train after Athens but this was also the point where I reaslised I was also going to have to rethink that part of my trip.

The bus was fine though. 15 hours is long, and not the best nights sleep i ever had, but definitely some sleep is better than no sleep... Driving down through greece in the morning was stunning and I can't wait to visit again. I also really liked Athens - one of my favourite cities on my trip. Went up the Acropolis during a summer afternoon thunderstorm, saw the Antitheyra mechanism, visited a chess club, hung out in cafe all day in the sun and read.

After a few days in **Athens I got the train to the Ferry to travel to Bari.** Part of that seemed to be with rail replacement. Then got a taxi to the ferry terminal with another traveller i'd met. You get a discount on the ferry with Interrail.  The ferry was cool. Having my camping stuff with me e.g my air matress made it a bit more comfortable as did the obligatory eye mask and ear plugs.

**From Bari I got the train to Genoa** where I camped . The journey from Bari to Milan had  some of the best scenary of the trip. This was a case of cutting it fine as this was a long journey and my train was delayed and I hadn't factored this possibility in. Luckily I managed to get there a few minutes before my connecting train left otherwise i'd have had to have figured out the local bus system  as that was the last train of the day. I stayed at Camping Village Doria which was a 5 or so minute walk from Genova Pegli . Very friendly staff , flexible and of course cheaper than a dorm - would stay there again.

**After Genoa I got the train to Antibes** where I visited  a relative then got a ferry to **Corsica** where I hiked the northern half of the GR20. There is a rail system in Corsica which is not covered by interail but is pretty affordable. I'd love to go back next summer and spend some time at some of the beaches and walk the rest of the trek. After 8 days in the mountains I got a train back to civilisation. As it was sunday I had to wait at the station all afternoon as by the time i'd hiked down I'd missed the morning train but this was fine, I read and lazed around in the sun.  On the ferry I knew the score to ask where I could sleep with my air matress in case i wasn't allowed to sleep in a certain area.

**I then travelled from Antibes to Lausenne** in Switerzland. Very long day in retrospect, made worse by a 4 or so hour delay outside Marseille. From Marseille it was smooth though and the train was maybe the nicest of the trip.  Spent a few days camping by lake Geneva. Visted Geneva itself, Cern, Gruyere. the outsider art museum in Lausenne is great, but i think i would have enjoyed staying in Geneva more than i did Lausenne. Swiss trains work so well its a pleasure to use them.

**I then travelled back to Berlin** using up my second journey in my country of residence. I was exhausted and the weather had been bad. In retrospect maybe I should have headed to spain after Antibes and spent a few weeks on a beach but it is what it is. Sometimes being home in your own bed is the best thing.

**After a few weeks hanging out in Berlin I travelled to Zurich Via prague.**   By this time it was October. As i'd used my journeys up and couldn't face using regional trains to take my to the border with my german travel card (Deutschland ticket) I opted for the bus to Prague. This arrived over hour late and I missed my direct train to Vienna where i was supposed to get a night train. This meant then getting two trains to Vienna with a very small change over time (5 minutes).  If the train had been late I could have ended up stranded overnight.  Cutting it fine like this is just not worth the stress and I swore never to do long days like this again, especially with such short transfers. luckily we made it to Vienna on time - i hadn't really eaten all day as I'd planned to grab something in Prague but had had no time. Ate a pretty bad pizza while waiting, but was pretty happy anyway.

For all the bad things I'd read about the night jet here mine was fine - arrived bang on time. I had a sort of mini pod thing lto myself ike a micro hotel. Just enough space for me and my trekking rucksack. Train arrived at Bregenz in the morning. Went to Aldi to stock up on food then travelled on to Zurich where I started my day swimming in the river at a bathing spot near the main station. Camped at Fischers Fritz which is a bit out of the centre but they were friendly and flexible. Would stay there again.

**From Zurich I travelled to Florence.** Another very long day arriving at around 8pm i think.  Got the bus directly outside the station to a campsite outside the city at a place called Camping Fiesolle -would stay here again. I would have liked to have had more time walking outside of Florence but the city itself a day felt like enough for me.

**Florence to Naples** I wanted to travel earlier in the day but I think in Italy you have to book at least two hours in advance which meant leaving later than intended as I was going to book spontanously. As it was all the trains heading south were delayed so it made no difference. Naples was cool. Ate deep fried pizza and gelato, went cliff diving near Sorento and sunbathed on the rocks, worked out at a weightlifting  gym in an old garage, went to Pompei in the rain.

**Got the night train from Naples to Messina then travelled on to Cefalu**. Think this train normally goes all the way through to Palermo but there was engineering works or something so got woken up in Messina around 5am. Got the train on to Cefalu where I dozed on the beach for most of the day. Stayed at Camping Sanfilippo which had the most impressive sanitary block i've ever seen and is right by a beach. Would stay again.

**After this I travelled to Palermo**. I loved Palermo. It was also the most surprising city i visited on my trip in terms of my own expectations.   I met some friends who had a car and we drove to the south of the island where we stayed for a week. I could have spent a whole month on sicily and would like to come back.

**Syracuse to Rome**  After getting an afternoon train to  Messina the nightrain left  around 10pm arrived around  8am. This is why I love travelling with train - you wake up in another city,  walk outside and you are right bang in the city centre.  Put my trekking rucksack in left lugage, had an espresso then I started exploring the city.  Liked Rome, seen some negativity about online which i don't get. Would like to go back.

**Rome to Venice**  I'd been to a lot of touristy cities already and Venice has a reputation so I had expectations but it wasn't as  touristy as i feared. I ended up liking it  and I actually wish i'd sent longer there. Stayed at Camping Rialto - right by a bus stop that takes you to the main Island - would stay again

**Venice to Prague** As mentioned i'd already used both my in and out journeys already so went back to Berlin via Prague - I wasn't able to make it back in a whole day.  Was nice to  end the journey back in the first city i visited and come full circle. As i left the hostel on drizzly Tuesday morning Prague felt atmospheric and a lot emptier than it had in the summer. Stayed at the Ahoy! hostel - was only there breifly but was friendly and would stay again.

**Prague to Berlin.** My interrail ticket took me to the border with Germany after which I took a local train to Dresden before getting the bus home to Berlin.

‘Oh, Kylie, queen of “I built my empire all by myself”… except for the tiny part where you were born into wealth and your family’s reality show gave you constant exposure. But hey, let’s not forget that time she self-made her way to the top by selling overpriced lip kits that we all know were mostly just repackaged drugstore glosses.

And her constant, “I’m just a chill girl who likes hanging with my friends” persona, meanwhile she’s living in a mansion the size of a small country. Her Instagram posts are so curated, even the coffee cup looks like it was arranged by a stylist. Honestly, if I see one more perfectly shot “candid” pic of her casually lounging in a bikini while holding a skincare product, I might scream. Like, we get it, you’re an influencer with an empire—does anyone actually think your life is “low-key” or “natural,” though?

Also, can we talk about how her makeup line has taken “having too much stuff” to a whole new level? Every season she drops more palettes than some makeup artists even use in a year. It’s like she’s running a secret beauty warehouse.

A few months ago, I found myself staring at the mirror, wondering how I’d let things get to this point. My energy was nonexistent, my belly fat was stubbornly refusing to budge, and even the thought of trying another diet felt exhausting. It wasn’t just about looks—it was about how I felt every single day: sluggish, uninspired, and trapped in a body that didn’t feel like my own.

That’s when I discovered something that changed everything. It wasn’t a crash diet or a punishing workout plan. It was a simple addition to my routine that turned my world upside down in the best way possible.

At first, I was skeptical. A friend had raved about how this unique blend of natural ingredients helped her finally tackle her stubborn belly fat, improve her energy, and even sleep better. I’d heard similar promises before, and nothing ever lived up to the hype. But something about this felt different. Maybe it was the science behind it or the testimonials from people who seemed just like me. I decided to give it a try. What did I have to lose, other than some unwanted fat?

The first thing I noticed was the energy. After just a few days, I felt more alive than I had in years. It wasn’t the jittery, crash-later kind of energy you get from coffee or energy drinks. It was smooth, sustained, and natural. Suddenly, getting out of bed in the morning wasn’t a chore. I started to look forward to my day.

Then came the changes in my body. Week by week, the belly fat that had clung to me for so long started to shrink. My clothes fit better, my confidence grew, and I started to recognize the person in the mirror again. It wasn’t about rapid, unsustainable results. It was steady, consistent progress, the kind that feels real because it *is* real.

But perhaps the most surprising benefit was how well I started to sleep. For years, I’d been tossing and turning, waking up feeling groggy no matter how many hours I spent in bed. Now, I was falling asleep faster, staying asleep longer, and waking up refreshed. The connection between quality sleep and weight loss finally made sense to me—it’s all part of the bigger picture.

I couldn’t believe how simple it was. This wasn’t about deprivation or unrealistic sacrifices. It was about giving my body the support it needed to do what it was meant to do: thrive.

And the best part? I wasn’t just losing weight. I was gaining my life back. I had the energy to play with my kids, tackle projects I’d been putting off, and say yes to opportunities I used to avoid. I felt vibrant, capable, and alive.

If you’ve ever felt stuck, like no matter what you do, nothing works, I want you to know there’s hope. You don’t have to keep spinning your wheels, wasting time on gimmicks or quick fixes. There’s a way to transform your body and your life in a sustainable, meaningful way. I’m living proof of that.

As I dove deeper into my journey, I became curious about *why* this was working so well. I wanted to understand the science behind what was happening in my body—and what I found made me appreciate this even more.

At its core, the secret lies in the natural ingredients that make up this formula. Each one was carefully chosen not just for its individual benefits but for how they work together to create a powerful synergy. It’s like giving your body the perfect toolkit to fix the underlying issues that make weight loss feel impossible.

One of the standout ingredients is **Spirulina Blue**, a nutrient powerhouse that has been shown to rev up metabolism. Spirulina isn’t just another trendy superfood; it’s backed by studies showing its ability to support fat oxidation and improve energy levels naturally. That energy boost I mentioned earlier? Spirulina plays a huge role in that. It helps your body utilize fat as fuel, making every movement—whether it’s a workout or just your daily routine—more efficient.

Then there’s **Berberine**, an ancient herb that’s gaining recognition in modern science for its incredible ability to balance blood sugar levels. This is a game-changer for anyone struggling with cravings or energy crashes. Berberine helps keep your insulin in check, which not only prevents fat storage but also makes it easier to stay consistent with healthy eating habits. I noticed that I wasn’t obsessing over snacks or sugary treats anymore—it was like my body stopped screaming for quick fixes because it finally had what it needed.

Another key player is **Griffonia Simplicifolia**, a natural source of 5-HTP. This ingredient supports serotonin production, which is vital for mood regulation and sleep quality. Remember how I mentioned my sleep improved dramatically? Griffonia is part of the reason why. Better sleep doesn’t just make you feel good; it also directly impacts weight loss. Poor sleep disrupts hormones like cortisol and ghrelin, which can lead to stubborn fat retention. By improving sleep, this tonic tackles weight loss from another critical angle.

I was also fascinated by the inclusion of **Valerian Root** and **Humulus Lupulus**, two natural ingredients known for their calming properties. These help reduce stress and promote relaxation. Why is this important for weight loss? Because stress is one of the sneakiest culprits when it comes to belly fat. High cortisol levels make it nearly impossible to shed weight, especially around the midsection. By addressing stress head-on, this formula ensures your body can stay in fat-burning mode instead of clinging to every calorie for dear life.

Finally, there’s **Lutein**, a powerful antioxidant that helps reduce inflammation. Chronic inflammation is like a roadblock to your weight loss goals—it slows down your metabolism and makes it harder for your body to recover from exercise. Lutein not only supports overall health but also enhances the efficiency of every other ingredient in the formula.

The genius of this product is how it addresses multiple factors at once. It’s not just about burning calories or suppressing appetite. It’s about optimizing your body’s natural systems—metabolism, blood sugar, stress response, and sleep—so everything works together seamlessly.

When I learned this, it all clicked. The steady, sustainable results I was seeing weren’t some fluke or temporary effect. They were the result of real science. This wasn’t just another product promising the world with no substance. It was a carefully crafted formula designed to make weight loss easier, healthier, and, most importantly, achievable.

If you’ve been fighting an uphill battle with your weight, it might not be your fault. Maybe your body has been missing the right tools to function at its best. With this tonic, I finally found a solution that didn’t just treat the symptoms but tackled the root causes. It’s not magic—it’s science. And it works.

**How quickly will I see results?** Many users notice increased energy within the first week, followed by steady weight loss over the next few weeks. Results depend on consistency and individual factors.

**Is it safe to use?** Yes, it’s made with natural, scientifically backed ingredients and free from harsh chemicals or synthetic additives. However, consult your doctor if you have any health conditions or concerns.

**Do I need to follow a strict diet or workout plan?** No strict diet or workout is required. While healthy eating and moderate exercise can enhance results, the tonic works with your body’s natural processes to promote weight loss.

**What if it doesn’t work for me?** There’s a money-back guarantee, so if you’re not satisfied with your results, you can request a refund within the designated time frame.

**How does it taste?** The tonic has a light, natural flavor that’s easy to incorporate into your daily routine.

**Are there side effects?** It’s generally well-tolerated with no reported side effects for most users. Always check the ingredient list for potential allergens or sensitivities.

**How long should I use it?** You can use it until you reach your desired results and continue taking it for maintenance if you choose.

**Does it help with long-term weight management?** Yes, it addresses the root causes of weight gain—like slow metabolism, poor sleep, and stress—making it a great tool for sustainable weight management.

**How often should I take it?** The recommended use is typically once a day. Consistency is key for achieving the best results.

**Does it improve overall health?** Beyond weight loss, the tonic supports energy levels, sleep quality, stress reduction, and balanced blood sugar, contributing to improved overall well-being.

24M. I feel like I've been having ED for a about a year now. When I first got laid in April 2023, I was insanely hard while I was still fully clothed and stayed hard without issue. But in November 2023, I was mostly able to stay hard, but during the latter half I was having issues. Now I can barely get hard while masturbating. If I get hard, it only lasts for a second, before going back to half-erection. And lately, I don't even get morning wood. It's been like 2 months since I last had morning wood. Whenever I masturbate and cum, it's when I have a half-erection and stroke with a lot of might.

I don't know what the issue could be. I've been porn-free for 3.5 years now. I'm 24, 5'8 and weigh 147 lbs. I've been on and off with working out, but I've been getting back into it. I don't drink alcohol, smoke, or do any drugs of any sort. I don't even drink coffee or anything with caffeine. The foods I eat could be better, but they aren't the worst a typical daily meal for consists of: Scrambled eggs, blueberries, toast, PB&J, chicken nuggets, ground beef, bananas, protein shake, and some frozen breakfast foods.

Idk what happened, it was no problem getting just over a year ago when I got laid, but now I can't even get hard while masturbating and don't even get morning wood anymore. I really hope there's a solution.",2,1731800938.0,erectiledysfunction,4,1.0,False

Hi guys, I had a situation with my therapist and could use your help to figure out whether I was in the wrong.

I’ve been seeing my therapist for almost a year now. I really liked her and felt safe with her. However, last Wednesday, I went for a session at the end of the afternoon and was sent back because the doctor couldn’t take in any more patients. This was unexpected because I always come at that time and never had issues, but I didn’t make a big deal out of it and just left. I was disappointed but tried to take my mind off it.

The next day, her receptionist called me and asked if I could come in anytime that day. I asked her to push it to Friday since I had a day off, and she said okay. I requested 11 a.m. for the appointment, and she agreed but told me to come much earlier just in case. I asked why, and she started explaining how they can’t guarantee appointments and that if an unexpected patient shows up unannounced, they’ll prioritize them, even if other appointments were already scheduled.

I stayed quiet but felt frustrated. Later, when she texted me on WhatsApp to confirm, I sent a couple of audios expressing my frustration. I told her that I’ve always respected my appointments, arrived early, and still ended up waiting for an hour or two on average. I explained that I wanted a fixed schedule because I didn’t want to waste my day off waiting and that if they couldn’t provide that, I would need my record to see a different doctor. I felt a bit demanding but was genuinely frustrated.

She replied by shifting the blame onto me, saying I came late and that they prioritize new patients to avoid turning them away. I ignored her explanation to avoid further conflict and asked for confirmation of the 11 a.m. appointment. She said, “Sure, don’t worry.”

The next day, I arrived 30 minutes early. The receptionist called the doctor to let her know I was waiting, mentioning my name several times. It turned out the doctor hadn’t even arrived yet. She came in at 11 a.m. and needed time to settle and grab coffee. I didn’t mind that, but the session that followed was disappointing.

I wasn’t feeling great and rambled a lot during the session. She wasn’t her usual cheerful self—she had a cold, so I understood that—but she looked at me like I was wasting her time. At the end of the session, she didn’t provide any valuable feedback. She just prescribed a higher dose of my medication and told me she was transferring me to one of her younger employees, a psychologist.

This felt like punishment for speaking up. When I went back to reception to pay and confirm my next appointment, I was shocked to be charged nearly double what I’ve been paying for a year. They said it was because this was a therapy session and not a consultation. I tried to explain that it was no different from what we’ve been doing all year, but they didn’t budge.

The receptionist also started boasting about the younger psychologist, saying my therapist likes giving younger people a chance. It felt like I was being pushed aside so she wouldn’t have to deal with me anymore.

I was treated poorly, overcharged, and left feeling like I didn’t matter.

Was I in the wrong? Do therapists act like this? What would you recommend I do moving forward?

1gt08cz,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1gt08cz/i_cant_forgive_myself/,I can't forgive myself,"I've been with my boyfriend for 3,5 years. We're both 25 now. Four months ago, when I graduated, I hit a crisis and suddenly started recalling our entire relationship and the mistakes I made. The problem is, we've already had many conversations and reached conclusions about every situation, but I can't forgive myself, and I can't plan a future with him in this state. I cry every day and feel overwhelming sadness.

The first thing that bothers me is the drama I caused. In the last two years, there haven't been many, maybe 10 arguments a year. The drama happened over a six-month period when I was struggling with a very difficult subject at university, and I wasn't doing well. Once, I even tore up an entire notebook. I constantly dragged him into my university struggles when I should have kept that separate. After that subject, it continued through the summer; I failed another subject and had to retake it. When I failed, I was so angry that I told him to cancel our vacation. I wanted everything to fall apart for him too because I was miserable. That lasted one day. We were both at our hometowns, and I would frequently start drama through messages. He was working all day for an american company as an engineering manager, and I would bombard him with messages, often writing illogical things. I was very childish. When he said he couldn’t come for the weekend, I would write, “Fine, then don’t come at all.” A few times, I wrote, “Go to hell and die.” All of this happened during that six-month period. It didn’t happen afterward, nor was it happening before that.

The next thing that bothers me is not telling him private things. We never had deep conversations about the past, and that’s what held me back from agreeing to a relationship in the beginning. At home, we live in a very small apartment, 37m2, and I share a room with my brother. I was ashamed of that and never told him. I didn’t open up about my problems at all. We didn’t have much money before; elementary school was hard for me because I have alopecia and no hair, my brother was unemployed for a long time, and some little things. These are all things we never talked about, and I regret not opening up sooner. When I told him about my hair before the relationship, he never asked me anything about it. He said he doesn’t like putting people in awkward situations and that the past doesn’t matter to him, so he didn’t think to ask. When I finally told him all those things, he said he had nothing to say.

The next thing that bothers me is the beginning of our relationship. We met on October 25th and saw each other one more time before I went home for two weeks. During those two weeks, I was texting another guy I didn’t know in person, and I really liked him online. When I came back to the city where I was studying, I went for coffee with that guy, and I didn’t like him. After that, I fell in love with my current boyfriend. That was on November 19th. I know I shouldn’t feel bad about it, but I constantly feel guilty for not knowing right away that he was “the one.” I told him how I felt on December 1st, but then we went home for a month and a half, and that was still during COVID.

The next thing I regret is waiting for sex. Our first kiss was on February 26th, our official relationship date was March 27th, and sex happened in September. Before that, we did everything else—rubbing without clothes, oral, hands, and a few times, he partially went inside, but just the tip. However, full PIV sex wasn’t until September. The worst part about it was that I always had to have control. I was constantly obsessed with those dates—when we’d officially be in a relationship, the perfect day for the first time, etc.

The last thing that bothers me is going out to clubs. My friends often pressured me, and I gave in. I didn’t have a strong sense of self. It happened about 6-8 times a year. But I never got drunk. I regret going out sometimes when I didn’t feel like it. I should have prioritized him.",1,1731800371.0,offmychest,0,1.0,False
1gt07je,https://www.reddit.com/r/EosinophilicE/comments/1gt07je/dairy_and_wheat_alternatives/,Dairy and wheat alternatives ,"Hello all! After 2 weeks of eliminating dairy, I'm beginning to suspect an issue with wheat as well. As I'm aware, these are the most common triggers for eoe, and I wanted to know how those of you with these triggers have been managing. I also wanted to share what I've been leaning on with my new diet.

Cashew milk is the best replacement for half and half in my coffee, hands down. Everything else I've tried was off-putting in one way or another. It's expensive, which sucks, but at least it's decently tasty.

Oat milk is the best for cereal. I already buy soymilk for my tea, though, so I just use this instead on the rare occasion I want cereal.

As for cheese... there is no adequate stand-in. I love nutritional yeast on popcorn (when I could eat solid food), and it's cheese-like, but not quite right. I imagine a cashew/nutritional yeast combo would make a pleasant sauce nonetheless. It's also nice in crackers.

Thai curry with coconut milk is amazing! I use chickpeas, eggplant, bell peppers, onion, and tofu. I'll try chicken and rice once my swallowing improves.

Indian curries with cashew milk. Some Indian cuisines use cashews for the creamy texture, so it suits this cuisine quite well. I've also been eating lots of lentils and chickpeas to try and meet my protein goals while I'm unable to get meat down.

As for noodles, I quite like rice, but they are certainly not much like wheat noodles in texture. Any recommendations from you guys?

I plan to get some gluten-free flour to make some cookies. Coconut oil is a decent replacement for butter, and I find gluten-free cookies to be the most like their glutinous baked good counterparts.

Chickpea and oat flour make good crackers, though distinct from wheat flour. Like cheese, I don't think there's a bread alternative that gets close. 

I've been eating lots of halva and dates stuffed with peanut butter and dark chocolate chips as my sweet treats. Rice crispy treats made with coconut oil are on my to-make list.

So, that's my list of go-tos. I'd love to hear your recommendations as well!",1,1731800304.0,EosinophilicE,0,1.0,False

(Staggered breathing) I did not expect that to break easily...or for it to be that loud. Ouch, my ears have been through it today. Well, it was the window or risk being seen lock picking...so sorry house owner...Good thing I didn't see a car out front, gives me a little relief-

\[SFX: Glass crunching from walking\]

Ugh, I hope the glass doesn't go through my shoes...I really like these, They are Perfect for running and they look pretty(Giggle)

PAUSE

Hmm, this is such a cute little house, very cozy. I can imagine sitting on the couch by a warm, bright fire. Maybe with a book in my hand and snuggled up with a dog...(Sigh) I really want a dog, doesn’t matter what kind...a cute little thing to come home to, now where that home is (laugh)...Maybe after I get away I can-

(Scared Gasp) Shit, Well hello. I didn't see you standing there. Were you just eavesdropping on me? How rude of you, You should've said something.

...

\[A little Playful\] Woah there, there's no need to be frightened by little ole me. You can put the knife down, I don't want to hurt you. Besides I could easily disarm you real quick, you wouldn’t even see me coming. So do both of us a lovely favor and put it down.

...

Mmm come on love, I promise I won't hurt you.

PAUSE

There you go...Look at you listening to me (Giggle). Hmm, I see you were making some tea, it smells amazing, Would you mind if I joined you?

...

(Exaggerated Sigh) Well, we can talk about why I'm here and what I plan on doing and yada but I'm kind of parched and hungry so, Please? I'm sure you got plenty of good food, You look good by the way. So cute. I like the pajamas too, pretty colour.

...

\[Excited\] Ah, thank you love. I will have whatever you are already making, you don’t need to make anything special for me.

...

Mhm, that sounds perfect. You mind if I sit at the table?

...

I am a bit tired but I don't think me being in the kitchen with you is a good idea. I can tell you're still on edge. Which is fine, I mean I literally just broke into your home.

...

\[Amused\] Ah stop it, You don't have to lie. I can sense it and...Your face is a dead giveaway, You're still cute though.

\[SFX: Footsteps followed by chair squeak\]

I just realized I never introduced myself to you...How very rude of me. Hmm, you can just call me <Whatever you feel VA>, and you are?

...

Oh, what a lovely name, very fitting for a cutie like you.

...

(Giggle) Oh my, What an expression that is...(Tongue clicks) so red. Careful love I feel if you get any cuter...I'll have to do something about it.

...

Hmm, nope I think I'll let that imagination of yours go wild. By the stacks of books everywhere I’m sure you can come up with something.

PAUSE

You live alone?

...

This isn't a scary movie, you can tell me. Besides, If It was I would have probably been watching your house for weeks. But you don’t have to answer…the pictures on the wall with only you in them speak up clearly for you…What about the house?

...

Oh? You bought it yourself? Well look at you, Nice job it's beautiful. And if I can say…you match it perfectly.

...

\[SFX: Tea pouring\]

Sugar and Cream for me love. I don’t understand people that can drink things like tea and coffee without it. I guess they’re just stronger than me in that way.

...

Yeah, of course, I can tell you. I don't know why but I feel like I can trust you. Maybe It's blind hope or the way you are looking at me with such curiosity. What kind of books do you read?

…

\[Whisper\] Fine don’t tell me, I’ll let you have your secrets…

\[SFX: Glass/Mug being put on the table\]

|Casually add sips wherever you like from now till I state otherwise!!|

Thank you, please, take a seat with me. Ah, listen to me. Please forgive me for offering your own chair to you...but I would like it if you did sit with me while I explain. I wouldn't want to be comfortably sitting down in your chair while you're just standing. Now, please.

\[SFX: Chair squeak\]

Hmm okay, how about we make this a little more fun than me explaining like a school essay? Are you down for 20 questions? (Smile) Or something like that?

...

We may not be children but we are allowed to do what we please. Now...You can start us off.

...

Of course ( gentle laugh) I came from a bit downtown, I guess the city wasn't doing it for me anymore. Feeling a little more adventurous you could say.

...

(Tongue clicking) Oh how eager you are but sorry my love, it's my turn. Hmm, What do you like to do for fun?

...

\[Amused\] I see...how expected but in a good way, I promise you. You are such a cute little thing, I imagine you staying out of trouble. Keeping to yourself...You have any friends?

...

How right you are! Go ahead, ask your question.

...

\[Quiet\] Trouble? I'd like to say no but I guess that wouldn't be the truth-

...

What I can gather from you're expression, this is not the time for games...Explaining away will have to do, No matter how boring it will be for me. You know I'd like to get to know who you are, You are enticing. From your faces to your pretend bravery…

...

\[Playful\] I got it! Hmph so pushy. Now where should I start...

...

The beginning?...Of course anything for my lovely host. And can I say…you have been doing an amazing job, love. Well, I’ll just say, I'm running from something-er- someone? And as you saw earlier I was a bit desperate...agh, I literally broke your window( Clear throat) Sorry about that.

...

No...they aren't trouble more like I'm the trouble. (Gentle Laugh)

...

Sorry for the riddles, love. But I don't want to get you tied up into this...You are too cute for that.

QUICK PAUSE

Oh don't give me that face, You're making it hard for me not to tell you every little thing you want. Ah but what a pout...I bet your lips are incredibly soft (soft laugh)

|The Drinking stops here!| ...

Here, how about...I'm in trouble, a pretty big deal of trouble at that. And I don't mmm really want to deal with it. It's much more fun being able to run wild and free...I’m not really a fan of being cornered and forced into a place. Hmm, it seems like you are starting to catch on.

...

(Giggle) I guess you could say I’m a little bit of a criminal.

QUICK PAUSE

Now, now what happened to my brave little host? Don't tell me that scares you. I already told you that you have nothing to be afraid of. I couldn't even dare think of hurting you, The only thing I want to see is you all shy and pouting like...Oh, the sun’s gone down. Sorry to cut this lovely conversation short but I've been here too long...I think it's time for me to leave.

...

As much as I'd want to take you up on your offer, I can't be in one place too long. It gives them time to close the distance and I wouldn't want them coming to your place. It would piss me off greatly, to be honest. So thank you for letting me rest a bit and for the delicious tea.

\[SFX: Chair squeak followed by footsteps\]

\[Amused\] You really love to throw around that pout, Who would've thought, you could be a little bad? Using it to get your way but no matter how cute it is...I have to leave.

...

It was a good try though(Laugh)

\[SFX: Glass crunching\]

Ugh, Sorry about the window again...Good thing you live away from others hmm? And since you bought the house I'm sure you can get it fixed. You better get it fixed and don’t let just anyone come in. I of course am the exception but only for today.

....

AH, You are right...I should go through the door...you worried about my safety?

\[SFX: Door opening\]

Your hand, please. (Kiss) If the odds are in your favour...may meet again, my lovely host.

1gt00dc,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1gt00dc,Lactation Room Advice,"I’m excited to have the opportunity to create a lactation room for our facility. I do not have experience with breastfeeding, so I would appreciate anyone’s insight on how to create the most beneficial space. Here’s the background for our situation: this is a manufacturing facility with about 250 employees who work 24/7 across three shifts. 90% of employees work out on the production floor and more than half are female. I do not know how many employees would use the room during any single shift, but I do know that right now there are 4 employees either expecting to deliver soon or who will be returning from maternity leave soon.  We are renovating a former small break room (10’x16’) that is very accessible from production, but in the more quiet office area. It has a few base cabinets with a countertop and sink with wall mount cabinets over them like a small kitchen. I don’t have a budget per se, so any expenses within reason are up for consideration.

I want to setup the best space possible, but much of the advice I read for lactation rooms comes from office workers. Our room will be for manufacturing employees. Rather than working on a computer while pumping, they will likely be trying to quickly prepare and eat their lunch or trying to relax and transition to pumping after physically working in a fast-paced production environment. Our employees also have less flexibility with scheduling than office workers may have. For example, during shift changes, there may be multiple people who need to enter the room to drop off or pick up supplies or equipment. While employees certainly will be given the right to pump as they need during their shift, we can’t stagger start/end shift times simply based on how our manufacturing machines work. Anytime an employee is using the lactation room, a coworker will be covering their machines for them, so I imagine they will want things to be as efficient as possible so they don’t have to spend more time than necessary in the lactation room. That being said, I want employees to feel empowered to pump and not be rushed. Also, in case it is relevant, our employees are extremely culturally diverse and many belong to economically disadvantaged communities with language and transportation barriers. So with all that said, I’m hoping for some advice to provide the most value to our employees while being realistic and empathetic about what their day is like. While logistics may be more challenging, I strongly believe that production employees, not just office workers, should have a welcoming, healthful lactation space. It shouldn’t matter what your profession is.

What I already have: I’ve purchased a medical-grade refrigerator with controlled temperature and temp/power loss alarms. I can also purchase a freezer unit with a rack to stack on top of the fridge if that would be beneficial. I have purchased a Nessel lactation chair. I have purchased a deadbolt for the door with an outside occupancy indicator and inside locked/unlocked indicator. I will soon purchase a Medela Symphony hospital-grade pump and a microwave for lunches and sterilization.

I’m not sure what else to do with the space. Should I get a desk to go with the Nessel chair even though they won’t be working from a laptop? Would a c-shaped table that goes over the chair be better? Since the room is big enough, should I have a different kind of setup in the other half of the room for options? Like a recliner or couch/coffee table or dining table/chairs? Being mindful of different cultures, it may be possible that some of our employees would want their coworkers who are family or friends to help or join them in there for lunch while they pump. Again, I have no idea about these things.

Would it be better to have two stations separated by curtains so two people can use the room at once, or is total privacy more important?

The floors will be gray vinyl wood planks. What colors should the walls and cabinets be painted?  Most of our facility is bright blue and light gray. I’d like this space to be much cozier than that. Should I add a rug to make it cozy or is that too unhygienic?

Since they don’t have company email or calendars, what kind of schedule system would work?

While I can’t go crazy stocking supplies, what consumables are the most helpful?

I’ve heard that a drying rack and dish brush would get gross. Should I skip getting these?  Or should I get four of each so each employee can have their own on the counter (but there may be more than 4 ppl using the room)? Should I get little tubs for each employee to wash pump parts in the sink? I’m super cognizant of hygiene, lol.

What else does the space need?

Sorry for the long post but I’m really passionate about employee wellness and I feel a bit unqualified to know what would be most helpful. I would ask our employees directly, but I don’t want to make any assumptions about whether someone intends to pump or even intends to parent the child they are carrying. So thank you for any advice!

Please help,"I (18M) have done it for a long time, but tonight I’ve started feeling guilty and anxious out of nowhere. I am terrified that some of my lies are going to get found out.

Some examples:

2 weeks ago faked being in hospital for 4 days, originally to get out of plans with friends but then it went too far and they sent me gifts etc.

Today at my new job (cafe) I told them I had previous barista experience and on my next shift they’re putting me on the coffee machine. I have no clue how to work it. Also, a lady asked how I was and I told her I was having a really hard time with family (I’m not) and I think she thinks someone is dying or something.

I never told my friends that my dog died around a year ago so I still sometimes send them old photos of him and use him as an excuse.

All my friends think I have passed my driving test and have a car, and I keep having to pretend I’ve parked far away so they don’t look for it. In fact I’ve only been doing driving lessons for a few months.

I am a volunteer at a charity shop and I told them (most of whom have autistic & dyspraxia children) that I have autism and dyspraxia and they were very convinced and behave differently to me now. Also my mum is friends with one of the ladies and I’m terrified it will get found out. Or they will notice somehow that I don’t and hate me. I feel sick thinking about it.

I really don’t know what to do.

I’m an awkward and socially anxious person, even around friends, and the lies come out before my head catches up. Immediately after I regret it.

1gszwkz,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1gszwkz/i_cant_forgive_myself_for_treating_my_bf_badly/,I can't forgive myself for treating my bf badly and can't plan future,"I (25F)have been with my boyfriend (25M) for 3,5 years. Four months ago, when I graduated, I hit a crisis and suddenly started recalling our entire relationship and the mistakes I made. The problem is, we've already had many conversations and reached conclusions about every situation, but I can't forgive myself, and I can't plan a future with him in this state. I cry every day and feel overwhelming sadness.

The first thing that bothers me is the drama I caused. In the last two years, there haven't been many, maybe 10 arguments a year. The drama happened over a six-month period when I was struggling with a very difficult subject at university, and I wasn't doing well. Once, I even tore up an entire notebook. I constantly dragged him into my university struggles when I should have kept that separate. After that subject, it continued through the summer; I failed another subject and had to retake it. When I failed, I was so angry that I told him to cancel our vacation. I wanted everything to fall apart for him too because I was miserable. That lasted one day. We were both at our hometowns, and I would frequently start drama through messages. He was working all day for an american company as an engineering manager, and I would bombard him with messages, often writing illogical things. I was very childish. When he said he couldn’t come for the weekend, I would write, “Fine, then don’t come at all.” A few times, I wrote, “Go to hell and die.” All of this happened during that six-month period. It didn’t happen afterward, nor was it happening before that.

The next thing that bothers me is not telling him private things. We never had deep conversations about the past, and that’s what held me back from agreeing to a relationship in the beginning. At home, we live in a very small apartment, 37m2, and I share a room with my brother. I was ashamed of that and never told him. I didn’t open up about my problems at all. We didn’t have much money before; elementary school was hard for me because I have alopecia and no hair, my brother was unemployed for a long time, and some little things. These are all things we never talked about, and I regret not opening up sooner. When I told him about my hair before the relationship, he never asked me anything about it. He said he doesn’t like putting people in awkward situations and that the past doesn’t matter to him, so he didn’t think to ask. When I finally told him all those things, he said he had nothing to say.

The next thing that bothers me is the beginning of our relationship. We met on October 25th and saw each other one more time before I went home for two weeks. During those two weeks, I was texting another guy I didn’t know in person, and I really liked him online. When I came back to the city where I was studying, I went for coffee with that guy, and I didn’t like him. After that, I fell in love with my current boyfriend. That was on November 19th. I know I shouldn’t feel bad about it, but I constantly feel guilty for not knowing right away that he was “the one.” I told him how I felt on December 1st, but then we went home for a month and a half, and that was still during COVID.

The next thing I regret is waiting for sex. Our first kiss was on February 26th, our official relationship date was March 27th, and sex happened in September. Before that, we did everything else—rubbing without clothes, oral, hands, and a few times, he partially went inside, but just the tip. However, full PIV sex wasn’t until September. The worst part about it was that I always had to have control. I was constantly obsessed with those dates—when we’d officially be in a relationship, the perfect day for the first time, etc.

The last thing that bothers me is going out to clubs. My friends often pressured me, and I gave in. I didn’t have a strong sense of self. It happened about 6-8 times a year. But I never got drunk. I regret going out sometimes when I didn’t feel like it. I should have prioritized him.

I know the holidays can be rough for a lot of us. I would love to hear from everyone that doesn't spent their holidays with their family or origin (parents/caretakers, siblings, grands, etc)  I will save yall the trauma dump, but the holidays were really really rough for me growing up  and got worse because I don't want kids. 

My spouse and I don't spend the holidays with our families of origin due to childfree. religious, moral  etc reasons. We celebrate one big fall feast of our choosing (not a fan of the history of thanksgiving), Samhain,  Yule, Festivus, Kwanzaa and Winter Solstice. 

For holidays I always cater, I do most of the cooking and it's my day to take a break!  We have done: tacos, pizza, spaghetti, and this year burgers from our favorite vegan place. I will make sure we have milkshakes because....duh. 

  
Samhain: Dumb Super with  Soup, fresh bread and all the extras we want

Fall Feast (not celebrated on thanksgiving): Catered meal, Doctor Who marathon, and board games 

Yule: Catered meal from a local Thai place, hanging out with our local coven

Festivus: Ugly Sweaters and complaining. LOTS of complaining. Left overs for the meal. Stupid movie is watched and we complain the entire time. Childfree friends are invited.  

Winter Solstice/Christmas: Vegan winter feast for solstice and Christmas.. Whatever we are in the mood to order. Christmas lights are visited. 

Christmas adult time in the morning.....coffee after, presents (1-2 under 50 bucks) opened mid day, Star Wars Marathon, pizza and quiet day. 

  
Our holdidys reflect how little I want to put in effort and how much quiet me both need. Brag about what you do! I know some of us are jet setters (goals), some of us don't celebrate (valid)  and some of have other traditions(tell all!). 

Let's show other childfree folks what the holidays can look like with out family of origin! Single folks...chime in too. Let us know what yall do! 

Remember, you don't have to spend the holidays with your fam or origin. Hopefully you afford to be away from them! It's cool if they get angry....they will get over it or they can die mad.

1gszni5,https://www.reddit.com/r/breastfeeding/comments/1gszni5/lactation_room_advice/,Lactation Room Advice,"I’m excited to have the opportunity to create a lactation room for our facility. I do not have experience with breastfeeding, so I would appreciate anyone’s insight on how to create the most beneficial space. Here’s the background for our situation: this is a manufacturing facility with about 250 employees who work 24/7 across three shifts. 90% of employees work out on the production floor and more than half are female. I do not know how many employees would use the room during any single shift, but I do know that right now there are 4 employees either expecting to deliver soon or who will be returning from maternity leave soon.  We are renovating a former small break room (10’x16’) that is very accessible from production, but in the more quiet office area. It has a few base cabinets with a countertop and sink with wall mount cabinets over them like a small kitchen. I don’t have a budget per se, so any expenses within reason are up for consideration.

I want to setup the best space possible, but much of the advice I read for lactation rooms comes from office workers. Our room will be for manufacturing employees. Rather than working on a computer while pumping, they will likely be trying to quickly prepare and eat their lunch or trying to relax and transition to pumping after physically working in a fast-paced production environment. Our employees also have less flexibility with scheduling than office workers may have. For example, during shift changes, there may be multiple people who need to enter the room to drop off or pick up supplies or equipment. While employees certainly will be given the right to pump as they need during their shift, we can’t stagger start/end shift times simply based on how our manufacturing machines work. Anytime an employee is using the lactation room, a coworker will be covering their machines for them, so I imagine they will want things to be as efficient as possible so they don’t have to spend more time than necessary in the lactation room. That being said, I want employees to feel empowered to pump and not be rushed. Also, in case it is relevant, our employees are extremely culturally diverse and many belong to economically disadvantaged communities with language and transportation barriers. So with all that said, I’m hoping for some advice to provide the most value to our employees while being realistic and empathetic about what their day is like. While logistics may be more challenging, I strongly believe that production employees, not just office workers, should have a welcoming, healthful lactation space. It shouldn’t matter what your profession is.

What I already have: I’ve purchased a medical-grade refrigerator with controlled temperature and temp/power loss alarms. I can also purchase a freezer unit with a rack to stack on top of the fridge if that would be beneficial. I have purchased a Nessel lactation chair. I have purchased a deadbolt for the door with an outside occupancy indicator and inside locked/unlocked indicator. I will soon purchase a Medela Symphony hospital-grade pump and a microwave for lunches and sterilization.

I’m not sure what else to do with the space. Should I get a desk to go with the Nessel chair even though they won’t be working from a laptop? Would a c-shaped table that goes over the chair be better? Since the room is big enough, should I have a different kind of setup in the other half of the room for options? Like a recliner or couch/coffee table or dining table/chairs? Being mindful of different cultures, it may be possible that some of our employees would want their coworkers who are family or friends to join them in there for lunch while they pump. Again, I have no idea about these things.

Would it be better to have two stations separated by curtains so two people can use the room at once, or is total privacy more important?

The floors will be gray vinyl wood planks. What colors should the walls and cabinets be painted?  Most of our facility is bright blue and light gray. I’d like this space to be much cozier than that. Should I add a rug to make it cozy or is that too unhygienic?

Since they don’t have company email or calendars, what kind of schedule system would work?

While I can’t go crazy stocking supplies, what consumables are the most helpful?

I’ve heard that a drying rack and dish brush would get gross. Should I skip getting these?  Or should I get four of each so each employee can have their own on the counter (but there may be more than 4 ppl using the room)? Should I get little tubs for each employee to wash pump parts in the sink? I’m super cognizant of hygiene, lol.

What else does the space need?

Sorry for the long post but I’m really passionate about employee wellness and I feel a bit unqualified to know what would be most helpful. I would ask our employees directly, but I don’t know many of them well. I don’t want to make any assumptions about whether someone intends to pump or even intends to parent the child they are carrying. So thank you for any advice!

I’ve finished a few small pieces before like coffee tables, bureaus etc but obviously still very new.  It has been oiled with teak oil probably 10 times  in its life. I started by taking it outside, taking it apart, cleaning it with a strong degreaser and sanding the crap out of it with 60 grit then 120 grit then 220 grit. Since my mom wanted it stained darker, I tried to apply a stain, and the wood wasn’t absorbing it. I assume this is because of the oiling that’s been done over the years. My next thought was to probably apply a stripper and attempt to take off the oil, but I’m not so sure if the oil has been soaking in the wood for so long with that it would render useless. I would love to find a way to stain this table if anyone has any ideas please let me know. Thank you in advance. ",1,1731798412.0,furniturerefinishing,3,1.0,False

""My dearest Drea,

My hope is that someday, it’s you who discovers this letter. Adrian can be impulsive and unpredictable, and I have no idea what he might do in the future.

Drea, my little spark, my strength—I wish I’d had more time to see you grow, to be there for you. You are my heart, my sunshine, and please, always remember that. There’s so much I want to say, but time has grown scarce; I can feel it slipping away. My health is failing quickly, and it’s not by accident.

You deserve to know, Drea, that the reason for my failing health is Vivian—your mother. I wanted so badly for our marriage to work, wanted to share everything with her. But she only cared about my fortune, and she’s gone to great lengths to secure it for herself.

My estate belongs solely to you and Adrian. I wanted to make this clear in a will, but I never expected time to run out this way. I’ve long suspected Vivian was tainting my drinks, but today, I’m certain. She brought me coffee not long ago, and there, faintly on the cup’s rim, were traces of a familiar poison. I could call the police or rush to the hospital, but instead, I choose to write to you now, hoping you find this someday, hidden here in your nursery.

If things go as I hope, David may look after you, maybe even adopt you, though he doesn’t know of you yet. If not, I pray Adrian finds you and keeps you safe. I believe you’ll grow into a remarkable woman, strong and resilient, Drea. Know that I loved you fiercely. Please tell Adrian that despite his anger over my choices, I’m deeply sorry and that I love him as well.

I love you both,

\~Emerson Grant""

The letter slipped from Drea’s trembling fingers, her legs giving way. Sorin quickly wrapped an arm around her shoulders, holding her upright as she crumpled into his side.

Tears blurred her vision, and through them, she looked up at Sorin, whose expression held a quiet grief. Though he was only a child back then, his affection for his uncle had been real.

She managed to choke out, “W-what does this mean?”

""Shh,"" Sorin soothed her, bending to pick up the letter and carefully slipping it into her book. “Not here, not now. Let’s get home, then we can talk.”

She nodded, her lips trembling as tears spilled over. Sorin gently wiped them away, wrapped an arm around her waist, and guided her out of the room. They descended the stairs quietly, moving toward the exit.

Just as they reached the door, her mother’s shrill voice called after them, “Leaving already? You haven’t stayed for lunch.”

Sorin’s jaw clenched tightly. Murderous woman, he thought, before turning to face her with a forced smile. “I’d rather have lunch alone with my wife. Thanks.” With that, he steered Drea out the door.

Once they were safely away, he pulled the car to a stop by the side of the road, dropping his head against the steering wheel. “Damn it, damn it, damn it.”

A soft touch settled over his hand, gripping the wheel tightly. Lifting his head, he found Drea’s gaze, shimmering with unshed tears as she tried to hold them back.

“D-do you… think this could really be true?” Her voice trembled with uncertainty.

He reached for the book and retrieved the letter, directing her gaze to its signature. “Look, he signed it. If we can track down some old documents he might’ve signed, we’ll have proof.” He paused, deep in thought. “Dad must have something lying around.” A loud groan escaped him as he pinched the bridge of his nose, tears gathering in his eyes. “Why did my uncle have to be so reckless? He could’ve at least confided in my father and asked for his help! Damn it!”

Drea intertwined her fingers with his, offering a comforting squeeze. “We… we don’t really know what was going on back then…”

A sob erupted from him. “I loved him so much, Drea. I don’t remember everything, but I know I did. To learn he met such a tragic end…”

Leaning forward, Drea rested her forehead against his bicep, weeping alongside him. He lowered his chin onto her head, tears streaming down his cheeks as they sought solace in one another’s embrace.

After several moments, he wiped his eyes and said, “Call Adrian. Tell him to meet us at home.”

Drea nodded as Sorin drove away. When they arrived, Adrian sat at the dining table, his head bowed and hands gripping his hair in despair, the letter sprawled before him.

Taking a seat beside him, Drea wrapped her arm around him, offering comfort while Sorin stood back, his mind racing as he contemplated their next steps. Grief could wait; justice for his uncle was their immediate priority, and Sorin vowed he wouldn’t rest until it was served.

Suddenly, Adrian shot up from his seat, his eyes bloodshot and wild. He pulled out his pistol from the holster at his waist, making Drea gasp softly in shock.

“That’s it! That woman is going to pay today. I’ve tolerated her long enough!” He growled, striding toward the door. Drea grasped his wrist, desperately trying to halt him.

“Adrian, no!”

First time staying at Coronado Springs, before we stayed at all star movies our first time and animal kingdom lodge our second time.

Coronado Springs had a really far walk compared to all of the others. It took us about 10 minutes to get from the front of the resort hotel lobby to our room. We stayed in 7B. 

I didn’t love the actual food options, but I did really enjoy the quick pick up snacks. I love that they had energy drinks and alcoholic beverages readily available, and many many other easy snacks. I found it weird they didn’t have a kids chicken tender meal or something like that.

I didn’t get to take advantage of their coffee bar but i love that they had one with some fun drinks and pastries. Two actually!

The actual hotel itself was very nice and I saw characters 2 times while we were there! I didn’t get to go in the pools/hot tub but we walked by them and they were not super crowded and were very clean. Plenty public restrooms as well.

We ate at three bridges and everything was good except the mixed drinks. All of them tasted like straight alcohol with no flavor. This could be good for someone who wants that, but don’t expect a fun fruity drink (other than maybe the margarita). We were able to substitute shrimp in the tacos which was delicious! 

Overall, a pretty good place to stay if you’re in the hotel, but outside of that it’s a pretty far walk. I did like that the bus dropped you off in multiple places though if needed. There were barely any kids and I didn’t get woken up to any running or screaming outside our door. 

The buses were always pretty fast and the bell service was nice as well as they held our luggage the first day before our rooms were ready. 

At night, it is pretty dark. Also the risk of the “alligators and snakes” from the signs around the area was a bit scary. ",17,1731797963.0,WaltDisneyWorld,17,0.84,False
1gsze4l,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1gsze4l/the_feeding_cabin/,The Feeding Cabin,"I despise the city, it’s always been a place that holds no good memories for me, from my troubled family to my stressfully overwhelming studies, never getting me not even a speck of self-fulfillment I was promised of back in my childhood, so the moment my father, apathetically I may add, mentioned my weird uncle had passed away inside his far away cabin, which now needed a new temporary owner, it felt like a blessing in my crumbling life. 

After some very slow talks and arrangements, I packed my bags, climbed in my old car and set forth to the small town of Pelthwith, where the cabin was located. The path was uneventful, and the view was quite a good change of pace compared to the usual homeless guy or the endless buildings covering up the blue sky that has been robbed from us. I arrived a little over 6 PM, barely making it before sunset, being winter and all, so I climbed down from my parked car in front of the old wooden cabin in the middle of a small hill around the outskirts of the town.

 It was an oddly cozy looking shack, built with strong mossy logs and walls covered in mud to protect against the cold, for which I’m grateful, considering I had to be in almost a half meter of snow.

 So I grabbed my traveling bag and headed towards the door illuminated by the dimly lit sky, not being able to see the sun anymore as I stepped on the wooden porch and looked for the key my father had given me, and unsurprisingly, the door unlocked with a satisfying click. The inside of the cabin consisted of four small rooms. 

The main hall, a bedroom with a queen size bed, a bathroom and the kitchen. It was freezing so I set down my bags, locked the door and quickly got a couple of logs to light the fireplace to life, feeling much better about everything the moment I felt the welcoming heat and the firm softness of the sofa in front of it, which immediately made me quite drowsy, so I closed my eyes for a brief second before opening them up again, trying to not fall asleep. 

After taking a short breath, I got up and headed to the bedroom with my bags, and started unpacking everything for tomorrow, but that’s when I noticed some specific details about this room, for starters, the window aiming at the woods had no blinds, and the big wardrobe in front of the bed had little animal bones inside it, which isn’t exactly odd considering my uncle was apparently an avid hunt. Not giving it much of a second thought, I got changed and headed to bed, promptly falling asleep right after. I kept having weird dreams related to my family and the cabin, as well as waking up a few times thanks to slight noises outside the window, though I associated everything with animals and understandable stress. 

The next morning I woke up, got changed and cooked myself some breakfast and a cup of coffee as I headed out for the day, noticing the snow had not melted at all since it was still freezing outside, making me look like a headless city girl covered in coat over coat, boots not exactly built for snow and a soft scarf, which made me scoff at myself before getting in my car again and heading to the main town, looking to get in touch with the place and do some much necessary shopping. 

All of this took roughly 4 hours as I was constantly stopped by people that supposedly knew my uncle, mentioning how unfriendly and isolated he was, something that seems all too familiar to me as I’ve heard the same words coming from my father countless times. I thanked them for their welcoming words and warnings about living in the woods before finally getting back “home”.

 I sighed the moment I stepped inside the cabin, setting down the groceries and lighting up the fireplace once again, sitting down on the sofa to read a book when I suddenly noticed something curious. There were small scratch marks around the wooden floor heading towards the kitchen from the bedroom and back there again. Furthermore, I decided to check it out, slightly alarmed thinking some small animal had crawled inside, and my suspicions grew as I noticed those claw marks all over the wardrobe, with the small bones having been moved slightly. That creeped me out, but I decided to not worry about it for now, choosing to believe a hungry animal had gotten in, looked for food, found nothing and crawled back out, and looking back, I was nothing more than a gullible idiot.

 The rest of the day was uneventful, and I went to bed having completely forgotten about the afternoon. That night I kept hearing noises and more scratching, which didn’t let me sleep at all, so I got up and headed for the dark window, looking back at the endless abyss of the woods beyond, finding nothing but some more claw marks on the glass, easily visible due to the cold. That’s when I felt this was more than just a lost animal as I listened to the front door being knocked slightly, only for moments later to be aggressively hit over and over with a loud blunt thump. 

At that moment, I decided to lock the bedroom door and hide in a corner, holding my breath as I heard the front door swinging open alongside the sound of shattering wood, fearing it’d be a bear or another wild beast I had never dreamed of ever seeing outside a zoo. Then loud steps that entered the cabin sounded…almost intelligent yet too irrational and heavy to be a human as my confusion grew from hearing deep gnarly growls. I thought my heart had stopped as I kept holding my breath close to passing out, not being able to handle the agonizing silence that followed the loud entrance of this…thing, only for it to suddenly scratch my bedroom door, which made me yelp, yet I’d have never been ready for what I heard right after in a deep voice… 

\-Food… Food…! Promise, it’s time, where food?! Arthur! 

 As I heard the deep, inhuman yelling, I couldn’t help but hide under the bed, crying and trembling as I tried my best to stay silent. That’s when my racing thoughts came to a halt the moment I heard the door swing open with more wood shattering just as the front entrance had. 

 The creature entered the room, violently demanding for food and scratching everything with his giant furry-looking claws that I caught a glimpse of under the bed. The beast opened the wardrobe and sniffed inside, before madly knocking it over following with a deafening roar that made my beating heart jump more and more, thinking I was going to pass out, when suddenly the thing stopped, turned around and exited the room with heavy steps that grew farther and farther, hearing them reach the front door, then the porch, until everything went back to normal, a dead silence that seemed all too comforting now, yet deadly.

 I don’t remember much after, just the faint noise of cold wind and my fading consciousness, probably causing me to pass out until the morning. I woke up alarmed and scared, feeling like it must’ve been a dream if it weren’t for the fact that I could see the broken pieces of wood scattered all over the floor as I got out from below the bed. The room was a mess of scraping and the knocked over wardrobe, while the rest of the cabin was more of the same, looking like a tornado had passed the area, but it was no tornado. 

 A beast that could talk, demanding food from my deceased uncle, which filled my mind with hundreds of implications as to why he’d be feeding that thing…or what. 

Following the next hour, I didn’t bother to grab anything but my bags as I got changed hastily, climbed on my car and started the path towards the city yet again, leaving that damned cabin and woods behind. 

I didn’t tell my father the truth of what happened back there, fearing he’d lock me up in a madhouse, so I made up an excuse about some bear bursting in the cabin during the night, which earned me a dubious look from him but nothing more. I am now living in a small apartment in the middle of the city, with a crumbling life that I now have come to appreciate all too well.

 I never found out what that creature was, but I sure as hell don’t want to ever see it again, or that cabin…or whatever my uncle was doing back there, and now that I think about it, those bones looked small yet oddly…human, too human.",2,1731797945.0,nosleep,1,1.0,False
