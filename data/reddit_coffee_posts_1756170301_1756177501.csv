As a small business owner, you wear a lot of hats. You‚Äôre the CEO, the head of marketing, the lead salesperson, and sometimes, even the janitor. With so much to do, it can be tempting to let your financial record-keeping slide into a shoebox of receipts, hoping your accountant will sort it out later.

But what if I told you that hidden within your numbers is the very story of your business‚Äîits past, its present, and its potential future? Understanding this story is the single most powerful thing you can do to take control of your company‚Äôs destiny. It‚Äôs the difference between reacting to problems and proactively building a resilient, profitable enterprise.

This is where the **3-statement model** comes in.

It sounds intimidating, but it‚Äôs just a fancy term for how three key financial reports‚Äîthe **Profit & Loss Statement**, the **Balance Sheet**, and the **Cash Flow Statement**‚Äîwork together to give you a complete picture of your business's health. Think of them as three different camera angles on your business. One shows your performance over time, another gives you a snapshot of your financial position at a single moment, and the last tracks your cash. Together, they provide a 360-degree view.

This guide is your jargon-free zone. We‚Äôre going to break down each statement, show you how they connect, and give you practical tips to use them. This isn‚Äôt just about accounting; it‚Äôs about becoming a more confident, data-driven leader.

# Camera Angle 1: The Profit & Loss (P&L) Statement ‚Äî Are You Making Money?

The Profit & Loss (P&L) Statement, also known as the Income Statement, is probably the report you‚Äôre most familiar with. Its purpose is simple: to tell you whether your business was **profitable** over a specific period (like a month, a quarter, or a year).

Think of it like a scoreboard for your business. It starts with all the money you brought in (revenue) and subtracts all the money you spent (expenses) to arrive at your ultimate score: your **net income** (or loss).

**The P&L Formula:** Revenue - Expenses = Net Income (Profit or Loss)

Let's break down the key components:

# 1. Revenue (or Sales)

This is your top line‚Äîthe total amount of money you‚Äôve earned from selling your products or services. It‚Äôs the gross amount, before any expenses are taken out.

* **Example:** If you own a coffee shop and sold $20,000 worth of coffee, pastries, and merchandise in a month, your revenue for that month is $20,000.

# 2. Cost of Goods Sold (COGS)

COGS represents the **direct costs** of producing the goods or services you sold. If you sell a physical product, this includes raw materials and direct labor. If you‚Äôre a service business, it might be the cost of software or contractors directly tied to a client project.

* **Example (Coffee Shop):** Your COGS would be the cost of coffee beans, milk, sugar, cups, and the wages of the baristas who make the drinks. Let's say this was $6,000.

Subtracting COGS from Revenue gives you your **Gross Profit**. $20,000 (Revenue) - $6,000 (COGS) = **$14,000 (Gross Profit)**

Your Gross Profit tells you how much money you have left over to cover your other business expenses.

# 3. Operating Expenses (OpEx)

These are the costs required to run your business that are *not* directly tied to producing a specific product. They are the day-to-day overhead.

Common categories include:

* **Selling, General & Administrative (SG&A):** Rent, utilities, marketing costs, salaries for administrative staff, office supplies, insurance.
* **Research & Development (R&D):** Costs associated with developing new products.
* **Example (Coffee Shop):** Your operating expenses would be your rent ($3,000), marketing flyers ($500), utilities ($700), and your salary as the manager ($4,000). Total OpEx = $8,200.

Subtracting OpEx from Gross Profit gives you your **Operating Income**. $14,000 (Gross Profit) - $8,200 (OpEx) = **$5,800 (Operating Income)**

This is a crucial number. It shows the profit your business generated from its core operations, before accounting for things like interest and taxes.

# 4. Non-Operating Items & Taxes

* **Interest Expense:** The cost of any debt you have (e.g., a business loan).
* **Taxes:** The income taxes your business owes.
* **Example (Coffee Shop):** Let's say you paid $300 in interest on a loan and your income tax was $1,500.

# 5. Net Income (The Bottom Line)

This is it‚Äîthe final number. After you subtract all your expenses from your revenue, you‚Äôre left with your net income.

$5,800 (Operating Income) - $300 (Interest) - $1,500 (Taxes) = **$4,000 (Net Income)**

**Best Practice:** Don't just look at your net income. Analyze your margins. Your **gross profit margin** ($14,000 / $20,000 = 70%) tells you if your products are priced correctly. Your **net profit margin** ($4,000 / $20,000 = 20%) shows your overall profitability. Tracking these over time is essential.

# Camera Angle 2: The Balance Sheet ‚Äî What‚Äôs Your Net Worth?

If the P&L is a video of your performance over time, the Balance Sheet is a **snapshot** of your business's financial health on a **single day**. It tells you what you **own** (Assets), what you **owe** (Liabilities), and what‚Äôs left over for you, the owner (Equity).

The Balance Sheet is governed by a fundamental equation that must *always* balance:

**The Balance Sheet Formula:** Assets = Liabilities + Equity

Let‚Äôs look at each part.

# 1. Assets

Assets are anything of value your business owns. They are typically listed in order of liquidity (how easily they can be converted to cash).

* **Current Assets (Can be converted to cash within a year):**
   * **Cash:** The money in your bank accounts.
   * **Accounts Receivable (A/R):** Money owed to you by customers for goods or services already delivered.
   * **Inventory:** The value of the products you have on hand to sell.
* **Non-Current Assets (Long-term assets not expected to be converted to cash within a year):**
   * **Property, Plant, and Equipment (PP&E):** Land, buildings, vehicles, machinery, computers.
   * **Intangible Assets:** Non-physical assets like patents, trademarks, or goodwill.
* **Example (Coffee Shop):**
   * Cash: $15,000
   * Inventory (beans, milk, cups): $3,000
   * Equipment (espresso machine, registers): $25,000
   * **Total Assets = $43,000**

# 2. Liabilities

Liabilities are what your business owes to others. Like assets, they are split into current and non-current.

* **Current Liabilities (Due within one year):**
   * **Accounts Payable (A/P):** Money you owe to your suppliers (e.g., your coffee bean vendor).
   * **Credit Card Debt:** Balances on your business credit cards.
   * **Short-Term Loans:** Portions of a loan due within the next year.
* **Non-Current Liabilities (Due in more than one year):**
   * **Long-Term Loans:** A business loan from a bank.
* **Example (Coffee Shop):**
   * Accounts Payable (to suppliers): $2,000
   * Long-Term Loan for equipment: $10,000
   * **Total Liabilities = $12,000**

# 3. Equity

Owner‚Äôs Equity (or Shareholders' Equity) is what‚Äôs left after you subtract your total liabilities from your total assets. It represents the owner‚Äôs stake in the company‚Äîthe net worth of the business.

**Equity = Assets - Liabilities**

* **Example (Coffee Shop):**
   * $43,000 (Total Assets) - $12,000 (Total Liabilities) = **$31,000 (Equity)**

Now, let's check if it balances: $43,000 (Assets) = $12,000 (Liabilities) + $31,000 (Equity) -> **It balances!**

**Best Practice:** The Balance Sheet is crucial for understanding your company's financial stability. Lenders will look at your **debt-to-equity ratio** (Total Liabilities / Equity) to assess risk. A healthy balance sheet has a manageable level of debt and growing equity.

# Camera Angle 3: The Cash Flow Statement ‚Äî Where Did Your Cash Go?

This is the statement that trips up many business owners, but it might be the most important of all. Profit does not equal cash. You can have a profitable business on your P&L but still go bankrupt because you ran out of cash.

The Cash Flow Statement (CFS) tracks the movement of **actual cash** in and out of your business over a period. It reconciles the Net Income from your P&L with the actual change in your cash balance on the Balance Sheet.

It‚Äôs broken down into three activities:

# 1. Cash Flow from Operating Activities (CFO)

This section shows the cash generated by your core business operations. It starts with Net Income and adjusts for non-cash expenses and changes in working capital.

* **Start with Net Income:** From your P&L.
* **Add back non-cash expenses:** The most common is **Depreciation**. You bought a $10,000 espresso machine (a cash outflow), but for accounting, you ""expense"" a portion of its value over several years on your P&L. Depreciation is an expense on the P&L, but you didn't actually write a check for it this month, so you add it back to get to your true cash flow.
* **Adjust for Changes in Working Capital:**
   * **Increase in Accounts Receivable:** If your A/R went up, it means you made sales but haven't collected the cash yet. So, you *subtract* this increase from net income.
   * **Increase in Inventory:** If you bought more inventory, cash went out the door. You *subtract* this increase.
   * **Increase in Accounts Payable:** If your A/P went up, it means you received goods from suppliers but haven't paid them yet, effectively conserving your cash. You *add* this increase.

# 2. Cash Flow from Investing Activities (CFI)

This tracks cash used for investments. The most common item here is **Capital Expenditures (CapEx)**‚Äîthe purchase of long-term assets like equipment or vehicles. Buying assets uses cash (a negative flow), while selling them brings cash in (a positive flow).

* **Example (Coffee Shop):** If you bought a new $5,000 grinder, that would be a -$5,000 cash flow from investing.

# 3. Cash Flow from Financing Activities (CFF)

This section shows cash flow between the company and its owners and creditors.

* **Issuing Debt:** Taking out a loan brings cash in (positive).
* **Repaying Debt:** Making loan payments sends cash out (negative).
* **Owner Contributions:** An owner investing money is a positive cash flow.
* **Owner Draws/Dividends:** Paying yourself or shareholders is a negative cash flow.

**The Bottom Line:** The sum of these three sections equals the **Net Change in Cash** for the period. You add this to your beginning cash balance, and it should equal your ending cash balance on the Balance Sheet.

# The Magic: How They All Connect (The 3-Statement Model)

This is the core of the **financial modeling tutorial**. The statements aren't independent; they are intrinsically linked.

1. **Net Income Links the P&L to the Cash Flow Statement and Balance Sheet.**
   * **Net Income** from the P&L is the very first line item in the Cash Flow from Operating Activities section.
   * Net Income also flows into the **Retained Earnings** account on the Balance Sheet (under Equity). Retained Earnings is the cumulative profit of the business that hasn't been paid out to owners.
2. **Depreciation Links the P&L and Balance Sheet to the Cash Flow Statement.**
   * Depreciation is an expense on the **P&L**.
   * It's added back to Net Income on the **Cash Flow Statement** because it's a non-cash expense.
   * The cumulative depreciation reduces the value of Property, Plant, and Equipment (PP&E) on the **Balance Sheet**.
3. **Investing and Financing Activities Link to the Balance Sheet.**
   * The purchase of equipment (CapEx) from the **Cash Flow Statement** increases the PP&E account on the **Balance Sheet**.
   * Taking out a loan, shown on the **Cash Flow Statement**, increases the Debt liability on the **Balance Sheet**.
4. **The Ending Cash Balance Links the Cash Flow Statement and the Balance Sheet.**
   * The final number on your **Cash Flow Statement**‚Äîthe ending cash balance‚Äîmust match the cash balance listed under Current Assets on your **Balance Sheet**. This is the final check that ensures everything is integrated correctly.

# Putting It All Together: A Simple Example

Imagine your coffee shop's P&L shows **$4,000 in Net Income**.

* **Balance Sheet Impact:** Your Retained Earnings (Equity) on the Balance Sheet increases by $4,000.
* **Cash Flow Impact:** Your Cash Flow Statement starts with that $4,000 Net Income. Let's say you had $500 in depreciation and you bought a new $5,000 grinder (CapEx).
   * Your Cash from Operations would be $4,000 (Net Income) + $500 (Depreciation) = $4,500.
   * Your Cash from Investing would be -$5,000 (for the grinder).
   * Your **Net Change in Cash** for the period is $4,500 - $5,000 = -$500.
* **Final Check:** If you started the month with $15,500 in the bank, your ending cash balance would be $15,000. This **$15,000** is the number that must appear as the ""Cash"" line item on your end-of-month Balance Sheet.

See how they all talk to each other? This integrated view is what gives you true financial clarity.

# Your Action Plan: Making the 3-Statement Model Work for You

1. **Get Good Software:** Stop using spreadsheets. Tools like QuickBooks, Xero, or Wave are designed to generate these reports for you automatically from your bank transactions. This is the single best investment you can make in your **financial reporting basics**.
2. **Review Monthly, Not Annually:** Don't wait for tax time. Set a recurring calendar appointment to review your three statements every single month. Look for trends. Is your revenue growing? Are your expenses creeping up? Is your cash balance healthy?
3. **Calculate Key Ratios:** Go beyond the raw numbers. Calculate your profit margins, your debt-to-equity ratio, and your current ratio (Current Assets / Current Liabilities) to quickly assess profitability, risk, and liquidity.
4. **Forecast the Future:** Once you understand how the statements connect, you can start building a simple financial model to forecast the future. What happens if you increase your marketing spend by 10%? How would a new loan affect your cash flow? This is how you move from being a reactive owner to a strategic CEO.

The 3-statement model isn't just for Wall Street analysts. It‚Äôs a practical, powerful tool for every small business owner. By taking the time to understand the story your numbers are telling, you‚Äôre not just doing accounting‚Äîyou're building a roadmap for a stronger, more profitable, and more sustainable business.

In my life I have ran across some really annoying and frustrating people who are always looking for that ‚Äòangle‚Äô or forever trying to perceive your intent and how you will cheat them. They, at times, deliberately try to trip you up or put words in your mouth that they have misconstrued because of their view of the world. Spending any time in the acquaintance of such people is exhausting and, if realized quickly enough, very short lived. The problem is, as they are cunning and always on the look-out for others to ‚Äòmess-up,‚Äô it takes a while for the non-treacherous to realize what is happening and are upset with themselves for not sussing it out sooner than they did. Well I tell you, don‚Äôt get upset or feel bad but be thrilled that you don‚Äôt have an ulterior motive or reason for being a normal, happy human! Justice will come eventually so stay on the right side of humanity!

Take these bees for instance. This is the time of year, in Ohio, when these little sweat-bees venture out en masse and swarm around legs, arms, coffee, water or anything else that may offer some sweet or salty condensation. They don‚Äôt bite or harm anything as far as I know; in fact there may be some good they offer without me even realizing it. They are just happy to be alive in that moment and glad to be around someone generous enough to not swish them away. I admit I used to be irritated and shooed them off only to see them coming back without a thought or care of what just happened. They carry on as they would have because they aren‚Äôt on the look-out for someone to sting, bite or irritate.

The saying goes, ‚Äúfool me once it‚Äôs on you, fool me twice and its on me.‚Äù Well I‚Äôm not so certain. I had an occurrence a couple of weeks ago that took me off-guard even though I should have known otherwise. Afterwards I wasn‚Äôt as nearly frustrated with myself or the other party as much as I normally would have been. They are characteristically treacherous and I am characteristically not‚Ä¶and that‚Äôs all there is to it. I don‚Äôt understand them just as much as they don‚Äôt understand me. Do I wish they would change? You bet. Do I wish I could realize it sooner so I could offer a rebuttal instead of looking sideways like a dog waiting for someone to throw the ball? Of course. Will either of these things happen? Likely not. But I do know that if I‚Äôm like the bees and not here to hurt anyone but just be alive and enjoy what time I have, then I‚Äôm in good company becasue they obviously like coffee!

I feel like a failure and very behind  compared to my peers. I‚Äôve been working on moving on but it‚Äôs taking a toll on me.,"I‚Äôm (24M) watching the trailer for certified lover boy that drake dropped in October 2020 and the instrumental gave me an intense feeling of nostalgia for 2016-2020. Back then all I cared about was if a previous situationship wanted to get together and only seeked for her replies either on Snapchat or iMessage, overall her attention. She now most likely graduated from college 2 years ago and had a child. I remember only caring about when Travis Scott was dropping music, merch, or a collab with another brand, insta posts, and even getting braids just because i was a cringey fanboy lol. Im just yapping at this point, but like other young individuals i was careless, free and bold. But after 2020 it all went downhill. And I did this to myself. I simply didn‚Äôt lock in. I became too confident thinking that because I was so young  I had enough time to find myself and be someone in life .  But in the blink of an eye, 5 years have passed, I‚Äôm 24 now and I have done nothing with my life. My early 20s weren‚Äôt suppose to go the way they did. After going to college for 2019-2020 I took a gap year due to my fafsa being incorrectly filled out and denied aid and also I wasn‚Äôt sure what I wanted to major in or do  in life but I knew I wanted to be someone successful in life. Then between 2020 and 2023 after dealing with interpersonal issues and multiple attempts to return to college, I enrolled back to college for fall 2023-2024 still unsure what I wanted to major in. It wasn‚Äôt until I took an economics course and played coffee inc 2 during the spring semester that I realized that finance was my niche in the professional field. I then planned to continue college and then transfer to UIUC to complete my bachelors but I had to take another year off. So now fast forward to today I‚Äôm working a minimum wage and everyday I ask myself what am I doing with my life? What happened? Why didn‚Äôt I lock in earlier? This isn‚Äôt me? I feel so out of place and very off. 

Also me being a victim of FOMO doesn‚Äôt help at all, especially with social media recently showcasing posts of day in the life vlogs of interns going to their summer roles, or even graduates talking about their experiences after college. And iconic moments in concerts like at lollapalooza when Rocky performed I smoked away my brain and LVL and missing out on Coachella this year when they had a great lineup. I‚Äôve just been missing out, staying in since I don‚Äôt have any income to fund my social life because I‚Äôve been working low paying jobs and hating every single one of them.

Reality has been hitting me lately and it sucks. I wish I can go back to when I was a teenager or early 20s and experience more and make more friends, and actually think about my future and career. After 2020 every year till now has been a blur. Like I‚Äôve been living in autopilot. I miss being young, I don‚Äôt even feel like I‚Äôm 24. Now everyday I feel a sense of urgency to change my life. And honestly I like that because it mirrors those emotions I‚Äôve been feeling recently of feeling behind and  knowing I have potential but also I‚Äôm so overwhelmed that I don‚Äôt know what path to take or where to start. There is so many things I want to do but I get into this stage of limbo where I get overloaded with goals or ideas and I end up procrastinating and delaying Everything. However, I have been trying to make moves, I‚Äôm applying for college again and hope to start this spring 2026. ",1,1756176309.0,self,0,1.0,False

Dedicated Start

I had about¬†**4-5 months of dedicated**¬†study time at the beginning. During that period, I did my¬†**first pass of UWorld**, finishing with about¬†**50% correct**. i took notes of almost everything in the uworld notebook (incvluding tables algorithms diagrams etc).

At the end of that first run, I took my first two self-assessments and scored¬†**220 (uwsa2) and 218 (nbme 9)**.this was like in june 2024.

# Life Happens

I got a 236 after working on weaknesses encountered on those self assessments mentioned above, around mid august 2024), but I had to¬†**postpone my exam (was intrented to take on august 2024)**¬†for personal reasons and ended up taking a six-month break. When I came back, I took¬†**UWorld SA3**¬†and got¬†**226**. this was in january 2025.

# Resources I Used

* **uworld 2nd pass incorrects and marked:**¬†after 1st pass i had about 2200 incorrects, ended up wiuth 600 incorrects.
* **CMS Forms:**¬†About 2‚Äì3 per subject (except psychiatry since i felt i was good at it).
* **Ethics & QI (twice):**¬†amboss high-yield ethics articles, patient safety, organ donation, challenging ethical scenarios, and quality improvement. i also did all of the questions from amboss related to these topics
* amboss 200 HY concepts (twice)
* **Divine Intervention Podcasts:**¬†Focused on the high-yield list (see below), plus the ‚ÄúGet Your Head in the Game‚Äù episode on test day. look for the list of HY list of podcasts on reddit, its in a post somewhere.

# NBME & UW Assessments

* May:¬†**NBME 11 ‚Äì 246 (2 months out)**
* Then:¬†**UWorld SA2 (2nd time) ‚Äì 234 (around 1 month out)**
* 10 days later:¬†**NBME 13 ‚Äì 225**¬†‚Üí this was a low point for me. I felt depressed and realized I had to¬†**improve my testing skills**. (2 weeks out)

To work on that, I read several Reddit posts and watched a video on testing strategies (will link the ones I used):ok watch this video first:¬†[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S\_p4sFGHsUE&t=4s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_p4sFGHsUE&t=4s)

After that:

* A week later:¬†**NBME 12  ‚Äì 240**
* 5 days later:¬†**NBME 15 ‚Äì 243**
* NBME 12 (, 7 days before the exam) ‚Äì 240s
* free 120 new: about¬†**80% correct**. (3 days out)

\*\*\*NOTE = after every NBME, i did a list in excel with the questions i got wrong and an explanation of why i got it wrong, classifying them (either not reading the question, weird distractors, i let mtyself go in a stupid detail instead of seeing the whole picture)... and i wrote down a solution for that issue next time i encounter a similar scenario (example issue: not reading well -- solution: read question twice and be careful with vitals). then, i reviewed and did uworld blocks on weaknesses encountered on every nbme, and i read my uworld notes of that topic too.

# Test Day Experience

On exam day, I listened to¬†**Divine Intervention‚Äôs ‚ÄúGet Your Head in the Game‚Äù**¬†podcast on the way to the center.

* The¬†**first two blocks felt okay**, but by block 4 I was¬†**exhausted and spacing out**. I had to literally close my eyes, count to three, and tell myself to focus.
* I took a¬†**5-minute break after every block**, drank a lot of¬†**coffee and Red Bull**, and I‚Äôm also on medication for attention deficit ‚Üí so yes, I was in the bathroom every break.
* By the end, I walked out¬†**devastated, crying, convinced I had failed**.

# Waiting for Results

The two weeks after the exam were brutal. I had so much¬†**anxiety, couldn‚Äôt sleep or eat**, and kept spiraling thinking I failed.

When my result finally came in, I was¬†**shocked and so relieved**.

That‚Äôs my story. I‚Äôll drop the links to the testing skills Reddit posts and video that helped me, since those were a turning point.

If you‚Äôre struggling, please know that you‚Äôre not alone. Your NBMEs are not always the full story, and your actual exam experience can surprise you.

final thoughts:

\* i put in my task's list my weaknesses to study them, so then i dont forget to review those topics later.  
\* it helped me A LOT understanding that the exam and questions were about VIBES  
seriously, it givers you the vibe that its cancer, then stick to it, even if you dont have all of the reasons to say its cancer. i mean you have to trust your gut and stick to it  
(that was an example)  
\* i followed my gut a lot. like ""for some reason, this is what i think, im not 100% sure and the question is telling me some weird contradictory factoids. doesnt matter, if i think its THIS, then ITS THIS"". and you have to ignore a little bit your logical reasoning that leads you to the wrong answer.

1n0acus,https://i.redd.it/4q5bht1r0alf1.jpeg,Quick story about how drinking coffee saved my crawlspace from getting flooded.,"Saturday morning I got my coffee. And went to go drink it out on my back patio. It‚Äôs my favorite place to sit there and sip on my coffee. 
When I sat down, I noticed underneath this vent for my crawlspace that the concrete underneath it was wet. I went and checked the vent and it was even more wet than the concrete. I knew something was up. So I ran and popped the hatch for my crawlspace, jumped down with a flashlight, and started looking in that direction. A waterline had sprung a leak and was spraying water on the back wall of my foundation. A little bit had come through that vent.  I was able to turn off a valve just 2 feet away from the leak and isolated it completely and immediately. Spent a couple hours pumping out a little water that had puddled up. But all in all it was probably only 10 or 15 gallons. So I just wanted to bear my testimony that my morning coffee saved the day. In the name of bean juice, amen.

But saying the coffee is overpriced, the seating is uncomfortable, or the vibe is unwelcoming isn‚Äôt rejecting the genre. It‚Äôs giving valid feedback.

Most of the time, the criticism isn‚Äôt coming from people who ‚Äúdon‚Äôt get‚Äù coffee. It‚Äôs coming from actual coffee drinkers who visit cafes often and know what good coffee and service look like. When they say the prices are high, the portions are small, or the place feels pretentious, that‚Äôs valid feedback not confusion about the concept.

Saying ‚Äúyou‚Äôre not the target market‚Äù is just a way to avoid taking responsibility. It implies anyone who questions the experience just isn‚Äôt sophisticated enough, which feeds into this elitist mindset where it‚Äôs not about how good the coffee is, but whether you‚Äôre good enough for them.

1n0a67q,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortstories/comments/1n0a67q/nf_secret_shopper/,[NF] Secret Shopper,"I am a secret shopper. Ive been doing this work for about 7 years now. The most I can say is it pays the bills. Is it my passion? Of course not. But sometimes passion has a way of finding you. Even in the most mundane parts of your life. Even.. as a secret shopper.
This story takes place on a regular day of a regular work week. Scoping the regular 14 isles at a time. Its a weird thing to do; this job. Im allowed- no, expected to act as i normally would as a costumer. I have more freedom than in most jobs. I can go on my phone, I can talk to people. I can dress casually. Yet, i cant help but put up.. a performance. Maybe it keeps the job interesting, idk. But most days I conjure up a new identity i want to take on for the shift. Sometimes I‚Äôll go out of my way to introduce myself to strangers this way. A few times I put on an accent. Its rare that me and the other secret shoppers work shifts at the same time but whenever i get the chance I ask them if this is something they also do. Every single one of them agrees they cant help but perform on the job to some extent. Whether its a slightly more exaggerated version of themselves or who they wish they were. I guess its just the culture of this line of work.  But nobody seems to go as far as I do.
Today Im lingering between isle 12 and 13. These are the areas which people are often caught stealing the most. 
I fucking hate shoplifters. They urk me to my fucking core. Low lives. If it were up to me i‚Äôd walk right up to the sticky fingered fuck and grab them by the throat. Show them what its like to have something stolen from you for a change. But secret shoppers arent allowed to be hands on these days. I dont know, maybe im old school, but nothing gets done by running up to boss man and just ‚Äúinforming‚Äù him of a greasy sinner. Then the greedy iniquitous fuck just gets to walk out without consequence. I am basically a professional tattle-teller these days. But I understand its important work. But letting these delinquents believe they can continually get away with crime, they must believe they‚Äôre too good at it to get caught or even noticed. 
Oh but i notice. 
So of course.. I noticed her. In fact ive noticed her plenty of times. She a regular at this safeway. A strikingly beautiful young woman. Her sandy brown hair hangs at her waist and swings from side to side as she walks down the isles. Her makeup is bold. Theres always some use of glitter. Whether its on her eyelids, on her cheeks, or sometimes her lips. Her eyes are always surrounded with bright loud colors. On anyone else her style of makeup might appear incoherent, messy, and honestly unflattering. But with her her makeup choices didn‚Äôt register as strange. It suit her. Like her style, she was beautiful and strange. Like I said the day was regular. Like any other. But today was the first day that beautiful stranger, Emily, approached me. ‚ÄúYou must really like peanut butter.‚Äù A giggly voice behind me says. 
‚ÄúI always see you here and i swear you‚Äôre always looking at this shelf.‚Äù She laughs again. ‚ÄúOh- uh yeah,‚Äù is all I can muster to say. Is she in on it? Have I been found out?
‚ÄúI kinda drift through the same isles too, im indecisive y‚Äôknow,‚Äù she sounds shy but still manages to be charming. My guard comes down. I can confirm her question weren‚Äôt accusations. My position isn‚Äôt compromised. I join her nervous giggles and we banter for a while. I gave her my fake name for the day, Ben. 
Looking back, I wish i could say that was the first and last time i spoke to Emily. But just like I feared, i couldn‚Äôt stay away. We‚Äôd continue to run into each other at the store, in those isles. We would laugh at the crazy repeated coincidence and it became our little running joke, ‚ÄúI‚Äôll see you when i run out of milk‚Äù. Eventually we started seeing each other outside of the store. We met up to see each other at the movies, and the coffee shop down the street, and one time at the bar. And later that night, we met in her bedroom. After that i saw Emily almost every day. I practically lived in her apartment more than my own. I got to learn everything about Emily. Every wonderful, tragic, and alien thing about her. I learned everything inch of her body and oh boy.. did she learn mine. 
After 10 months of being with Emily she mentioned needing to run errands for the day. She suggested we go shopping together. I didnt think anything of it and tagged along. Then my gut sunk to the floor. She pulled into the safeway parking lot. I dont ever shop at safeway on my days off. It feels strangely foreign and critical of me. If im not the one watching then I must be the one being watched. As if you dressed up an actor in his stage makeup and costume and pushed him on in front of his expecting audience awaiting a show and said ‚ÄúGo ahead, just be yourself.‚Äù I feel deeply vulnerable and unprepared being here.
Also its just expensive af tbh.
As we walk in I notice Austin scoping the shelves of isle 8. Another secret shopper. We exchange nods. With a pristine swiftness, Emily grabs two cans of beer out the fridge and picks up her pace to a further isle. She never mentioned wanting to pick up beer. She doesnt even acknowledge what or why she just grabbed them. Theres this energy to her, this lack of acknowledgment, like if i asked her why she grabbed beer she would deny they were even in her hand. Her movements quick and routine. Ive seen this before. I just cant put my finger on where.
 ‚ÄúHere comes the meet cute zone!‚Äù She grabs my hand and leads me over to isle 13. The isle we first spoke. We pass the peanut butter (what I assume she wanted from this isle) and takes us to the far back corner. ‚Äústand right there,‚Äù she pretends to look at the shelves in front of her when *thunk.* It happens. She slips the two beers into her purse. Im at a lost for words. I can only stare at her with eyes wide in disbelief. She doesnt seem to notice and grabs my hand and leads us to another section. She smiles up at me, ‚Äú I got one for you too, babe. These are the perfect spots to sneak stuff, right? Something tells me thats why I always saw you waiting around here too.‚Äù  She nudges her shoulder against mine playfully and laughs.
 She‚Ä¶ laughs. This woman- this beautiful wonderful woman ive come to love commits this despicable, heinous moral digression, makes me an accomplice‚Ä¶And she laughs. 
I pull my hand out of hers. I stumble a few steps back. I shared a bed with this woman, ive thought about marrying her, thought about having kids, I- I gave her the keys to my house! I cant hide the unadorned disgust on my face as I look down at her. Slight panic crosses her face, ‚ÄúWhat?! Oh my god my bad I just assumed-‚Äú Before she can finish I straighten my demeanor, I look her in those beautiful big eyes and say plainly. ‚ÄúI guess you only ever deserved to know Ben.‚Äù 
Her face twists up in confusion. ‚ÄúHuh?? Ben, what are you talking about?? The hell do you mean by that??‚Äù
I didnt answer Emily‚Äôs question. I didnt answer her repeated questions as i walked out the store. I didnt answer her sobbed questions as i grabbed my belongings from her house. 
I didnt answer any of her calls.

Unfortunately, my life got back to its mundanity pretty quickly. Wake up, go to work, drive home, eat dinner, sleep, and repeat. Day in day out. 
I lost track of what day of the week it was. And sometimes what month we were in. It didn‚Äôt matter much. I just knew how many days in a row i worked and how many days I had off and that was all that was important. I cant tell you how many weeks and possibly months passed until i saw Emily for the last time. But it had been long enough that I couldn‚Äôt recognize the name she kept repeating behind me that has once belonged to me. Belonged to us. ‚ÄúBen!‚Äù 
I had transferred to another safeway so it‚Äôs no surprise it took this long for her to run into me once again. Once I realized who this woman was calling out to i turned and faced her from the other end of the isle. We stood and stared. She stepped forward, teary eyed. She walked up to me and asked all the same questions I expected. She looked embarrassed and smaller than i remember her like she hadn‚Äôt been eating much. It was incredibly discomforting to see this person I loved desperately look so confused and pained at the sight of me. She sniffled and stuttered through her sentences, opening up about how difficult and disorienting this all has been for her. She says she‚Äôll do anything to make it up to me. She opens her bag, ‚ÄúLook.‚Äù She sniffles and wipes her wet cheek and pulls out a $10 bill, ‚ÄúI‚Äôll even pay for two beers here right now.‚Äù She gives a desperate small smile. I feel a cramping in my chest. I want to hold her and tell her i miss her. Tell her i love her more than life itself. But i swallow those painful feelings and look her in those round gorgeous eyes for the last time and tell her, ‚ÄúIm sorry ma‚Äôam I think you have the wrong person. Do you know where the tortillas are?‚Äù
Devastation breaks on her face, shes fully sobbing now, ‚ÄúBut- Be- Ben whyyy??‚Äù
‚ÄúMa‚Äôam, my name is Issac.‚Äù 
I turned and walk away.
Away from the woman I loved.
To this day, 59 years later, I continue to work at this safeway as a shopper. Ever since then I never used the same disguise more than once. Is this job my passion? It just might have to be. I never married, never found love again. And still all these years later, I think of Emily.
She believed she loved me. She insist that she did. But you cannot love someone you never knew. Her love was poured into something that never existed. 
I may have made up the man she grew to love but so did she. She made up the version of me she thought i was. Filled in the gaps before i even saw they were there. She fell in love with me because she had already decided to do so before she knew me.
Before she even had a chance to decide if I was worth it. Before using her better judgement. 
This woman I loved was a stranger to me. And that thought terrifies me. But the fact i could still love her after the fact scares me much more than anything else could. 
I believed i learned this person inside and out, with an intense intimacy it was sometimes uncomfortable and at times disturbing. But the ways of her mind were and always would be a secret to me. The ways I am capable of loving and forgiving her will always remain a secret to her. The ways I hunt and expose the scum of the earth will always be a secret to them.

1n0a36g,https://i.redd.it/b1z0qusfy9lf1.jpeg,Can i still date F(32),"My Autobiography: Re-Entering the Dating Space at 32
I‚Äôm Rachel, 32 years old, and if you‚Äôd told me a year ago I‚Äôd be stepping back into the dating world, I would‚Äôve laughed it off. Life has a funny way of throwing curveballs, and here I am, navigating this exciting, sometimes nerve-wracking space again. My story isn‚Äôt about grand gestures or fairy-tale romances, at least not yet, but it‚Äôs mine, and it‚Äôs about rediscovering myself and opening my heart to new possibilities.
At 32, life looks different than I imagined when I was younger. I‚Äôve been through my share of relationships that taught me what I want and what I definitely don‚Äôt. My career keeps me busy, and I‚Äôve spent a lot of time focusing on others, which has shown me how much I can handle but also how much I‚Äôve put my own needs aside. I‚Äôm ready to carve out space for myself again, especially when it comes to my heart.
Jumping back into dating feels like stepping into a new city without a map. I‚Äôm not the same Rachel I was in my 20s, swiping through apps with reckless abandon or saying yes to every coffee date. Back then, dating was a whirlwind, exciting but often overwhelming. I was still figuring out who I was, and I gave too much of myself trying to fit someone else‚Äôs idea of perfect. Now, at 32, I know myself better. I‚Äôm kinder to myself too. I love quiet mornings with a good book, I‚Äôm happiest creating something, and I need someone who can handle my sarcasm but also my soft side, the one that cries at dog rescue videos.
The dating apps are a jungle. I‚Äôve swiped through profiles that make me laugh, like one guy whose bio just said, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm really good at losing at Uno,‚Äù and others that make me question humanity. But there‚Äôs something thrilling about it, the possibility of meeting someone who gets me. I‚Äôve been texting with someone lately, and it‚Äôs been nice. They call me ‚Äúgorgeous,‚Äù which makes me smile, and we‚Äôve been talking about our days, building a connection that feels real.
I‚Äôm cautious, though. Balancing my busy life with dating is a lot. I‚Äôm up early for work, managing a hectic schedule, but I‚Äôm trying to make room for this too. I want to believe there‚Äôs someone out there who‚Äôll understand my world, someone who‚Äôll laugh with me over a glass of wine, who won‚Äôt mind that I‚Äôm a little frazzled from my demanding days, and who might even share in my creative moments.
I‚Äôm learning to embrace the uncertainty. Dating at 32 isn‚Äôt about rushing to find ‚Äúthe one‚Äù or proving something to myself. It‚Äôs about connection, finding joy in the little moments, like a flirty text that brightens my day or a conversation that feels effortless. I‚Äôm not looking for someone to complete me; I‚Äôm already whole. But I‚Äôm open to sharing my world with someone who adds to it, someone who sees the chaos of my life and still wants to stick around.
So here I am, Rachel, 32, stepping back into the dating space with a mix of nerves and hope. I‚Äôm juggling my busy life, and maybe, just maybe, flirting my way toward something new. Whatever happens, I‚Äôm ready to write this next chapter, one date, one laugh, one moment at a time.

So we got a new management team and they came and  decided to change rules that make zero sense. Here‚Äôs the highlight  of nonsense:

	1.	No sitting at the front desk. Apparently, it ‚Äúdoesn‚Äôt look professional‚Äù if a front desk agent sits. Okay, fine, but when the lobby is dead from 11 am til 2 pm or 8 pm til 11 pm and I‚Äôm standing there for 8 hours straight, my knees are crying.

	2.	No DNR (Do Not Rent) list‚Ä¶ unless it‚Äôs about money. Did a guest scream in your face last week? Harass you? Make you cry in the back office? Doesn‚Äôt matter. As long as their card clears, we smile and hand over a room key.

	3.	No coffee for staff. Management decided it‚Äôs ‚Äútoo expensive‚Äù to let us drink hotel coffee. Apparently one sad little cup during a shift is gonna bankrupt the place.

4.  No control over ac. Before we could adjust the temperature but not anymore. Management says they want guests to feel ‚Äúrefreshed‚Äù when they come in from the heat outside. But guess who is freezing all the time now??

5. Prioritizing guest over everything even a basic logic. Example: a guest‚Äôs door had a small maintenance issue. And eventually it was fixed in 30 minutes, but my manager still wanted me to magically ‚Äúswitch them to another room.‚Äù Except‚Ä¶ we were completely sold out. You can‚Äôt pull a hotel room out of thin air. I got yelled by GM at for not being ‚Äúaccommodating enough.


It might all sound like small stuff, but when you deal with it every day, it just makes you think hard about this job. I know they try to improve the guest experience but employees experience becomes worse. ",9,1756175045.0,TalesFromTheFrontDesk,14,1.0,False

 They may not be dazzling, but they are full of possibilities, guiding us to slow down, embrace the beauty of restraint, and find warmth and meaning in every moment.

1.	Magic Forest
Thick emerald and cobalt blue blend deep in the coniferous forest, like emeralds forged by dwarves in Norse mythology, with millennia-old frost clinging to their surface. This mysterious, profound green tone carries its own narrative tension, evoking the secrecy of the forest and the harmony of nature.

2.	Desert Sun
It merges the heat of scorching sand grains with a faint retro hue, as if slightly faded by time and intense heat. The mix of warm brown and rich orange calls to mind sunsets over sand dunes. In autumn and winter wardrobes, it will shine as a warm highlight.

3.	Lavender Blue
A hybrid of pre-dawn mist and newly blooming lavender in Provence, like violets bleached by moonlight.
It carries echoes of the passing summer, the chill of morning frost, and the soft glow of overcast winter days. This light, airy blue-purple tone brings a sense of tranquility and peace.

4.	Hot Chocolate
Imagine savoring rich red wine and delicious dark chocolate by a winter fireplace, where embers of unextinguished charcoal flicker. This alluring, thick brown tone with deep wine-red undertones evokes a velvety texture and warm comfort.

5.	Bronze Fog
A Western Zhou jue cup (ancient wine vessel) stands shrouded in morning mist, with bluish-green rust breathing on its bronze surface‚Äîimbued with the coziness of a cold morning. This is a classic autumn color: a noble metallic tone with a soft sheen, balancing warmth and refinement, and a worthy companion to coffee and green hues.",14,1756174966.0,RepladiesDesigner,3,1.0,False

Last week I got a call that made me fear the woods.,"I've been driving tow truck for Morrison's Auto Recovery for eight years now. Started on day shifts, but the night work pays better and there's less traffic to deal with. You get used to the weird hours, the drunk drivers who wrapped their cars around telephone poles, the breakdowns on dark stretches of highway where cell service cuts out. It's honest work, and I'm good at it.

Most calls are routine. Dead battery, flat tire, fender-bender where nobody got hurt. Once in a while you get something that sticks with you; like the time I pulled a sedan out of Miller's Creek with the driver still inside, or the guy who insisted his car had been ""moved"" while he was getting coffee at the truck stop. You learn to take people's stories with a grain of salt. Stress and fear make folks see things that aren't there.

But last Tuesday's call was different. I'm still trying to make sense of what happened out there on Route 47.

The dispatch came in around 2:30 AM. ""Vehicle off the road, mile marker 22, possibly occupied,"" Linda's voice crackled through the radio. ""Caller said the driver might still be inside but she couldn't get close enough to check.""

Mile marker 22 on Route 47 runs through some of the thickest forest in the county. It's a winding two-lane that connects the valley towns to the interstate, popular with truckers trying to avoid the weigh stations. During the day it's scenic enough, but at night it's just twenty miles of dark trees and no cell coverage.

I grabbed my coffee and headed out. Linda had given me the coordinates, so I knew roughly where to look, but finding a car that's actually ""off the road"" can mean anything from pulled onto the shoulder to wrapped around a tree fifty yards into the woods. I kept my speed reasonable and watched for reflectors or broken glass.

I found it about a quarter-mile past the marker. At first glance, it looked like the driver had just pulled off to take a call or get some sleep. The car‚Äîa blue Honda Accord, maybe five years old‚Äîwas parked about thirty feet into the tree line on a patch of relatively flat ground. The engine was off but the headlights were still on, casting weak beams through the fog that had rolled in during the drive.

I pulled my truck up parallel to the road and hit the flashers. Standard procedure is to assess the situation before you start hooking anything up, so I grabbed my flashlight and walked over to see what I was dealing with.

That's when I noticed the first odd thing. The car's doors were all locked, windows rolled up tight, and I could see someone in the driver's seat. A young woman, maybe mid-twenties, gripping the steering wheel like her life depended on it. When my flashlight beam hit the windshield, she looked up at me with eyes that were wide with terror, makeup running.

I tapped on the driver's side window. ""Ma'am? I'm with Morrison's Towing. Are you hurt?""

She shook her head but didn't roll down the window. Instead, she pointed toward the woods behind her car and mouthed something I couldn't make out.

""Ma'am, I need you to open the window so we can talk,"" I called, raising my voice slightly.

This time she did roll it down, but just a crack. ""You need to get that car out of here,"" she said, her voice barely above a whisper. ""Right now. Don't unhook anything, don't get out again. Just pull it back to the road.""

""What's wrong? Are you hurt? Do you need medical attention?""

""I'm not hurt."" She glanced toward the trees again. ""But there's something out there. Something big. It's been watching me for the past two hours.""

I'll admit, my first thought was drugs or alcohol. Wouldn't be the first time someone got spooked by shadows while under the influence. But she didn't smell like booze, and her speech was clear and coherent.

""What kind of something?"" I asked, playing along.

""I don't know. I never got a good look at it. But it's huge. Bigger than a person. And it's been circling the car, just staying back in the trees where I can't see it clearly.""

I played my flashlight beam into the woods behind her car. The fog made it hard to see more than twenty feet, but I didn't spot anything unusual. Just pine trees and underbrush, same as the rest of the forest along Route 47.

""Ma'am, I don't see anything back there. How about we get your car back on the road and I'll follow you to the nearest gas station? You can call someone from there.""

""No."" Her voice was firm. ""Don't go back there. Just hook up the car and pull it out. Please.""

Something in her tone made me pause. I've dealt with a lot of scared drivers over the years, and you learn to distinguish between different kinds of fear. Drunk fear is sloppy and unfocused. Accident fear is sharp but fades once the immediate danger passes.

This was something else‚Äîthe kind of steady, controlled terror that comes from extended exposure to real danger.

I decided to humor her. ""Alright, ma'am. I'm going to hook up the car from here and pull you back to the road. Keep your doors locked and stay inside.""

Walking back to my truck, I found myself listening more carefully to the sounds around me. The forest was quiet. Unusually quiet. No owl calls, no rustle of small animals moving through the underbrush. Just the low hum of my truck's engine and the distant sound of a semi passing on the interstate miles away.

I was backing my truck into position when I noticed the smell. It was strong and musky, like a wet dog that had been rolling in something dead. The kind of smell that makes you breathe through your mouth. I'd encountered plenty of roadkill during my years of towing, but this was different. More intense, and somehow... fresher.

Getting out to attach the chains, I played my flashlight around the Honda and immediately understood why the woman was so terrified. On the roof of her car were two massive handprints pressed deep into the metal, not scratches or dents from debris, but actual palm and finger impressions where something had gripped the roof hard enough to deform it. Each handprint was easily twice the size of mine, with long finger marks that ended in what looked like claw scratches.

""Fuck,"" I muttered, running my flashlight along the car's perimeter. There were more marks‚Äîscratches along the passenger side like something had tested the strength of the windows, and gouges in the paint where claws had scraped across the metal.

""Now you see why I wouldn't get out,"" the woman called from inside the car, her voice muffled by the glass.

I was crouched down examining the damage when the first branch broke. Not a small twig snapping under the weight of a squirrel, but a substantial branch‚Äîthe kind that takes real force to break. The sound came from somewhere deeper in the trees, maybe forty yards from where I was working.

I stood up and played my flashlight in that direction, but the beam only penetrated about twenty feet into the fog before getting swallowed up.

Then came another branch. Crack. This one closer, maybe thirty yards away.

Then another. Crack. From a different direction entirely.

""Sir?"" The woman's voice was tight with anxiety. ""It's doing that thing again.""

""What thing?""

""The knocking. It's been doing it all night. Breaking branches, hitting trees. Like it's trying to scare me.""

As if responding to her words, a loud THUMP echoed through the forest, the unmistakable sound of something heavy striking a tree trunk. Then another. Then another, from different locations around us, creating a pattern of impacts that seemed to be moving in a circle around our position.

I worked faster to attach the chains, trying to keep my movements efficient and quiet. The whole time I was acutely aware of being watched. You know that feeling when someone's staring at you from across a room? It was like that, but amplified. Like something with very focused attention was studying every move I made, and growing increasingly agitated by our presence.

As I was tightening the last chain, my flashlight flickered and went out.

I shook it, smacked it against my palm‚Äînothing. The batteries had been fresh when I started my shift, but now it was completely dead. I had a backup light in the truck, but that meant walking twenty feet in the dark.

The branch knocking stopped. The forest went completely silent.

""Sir? What happened to your light?""

""Battery died. I'm going to get another one from the truck.""

""Don't leave the car. Please.""

The fear in her voice was palpable. And standing there in the darkness, surrounded by that oppressive silence and the lingering smell of wet animal, I found I didn't want to leave her either.

""I'll be right back. Just getting another flashlight.""

I walked to my truck as casually as I could manage, but every instinct I had was screaming at me to run. The fog seemed to have gotten thicker, and the Honda's headlights only created small pools of illumination that made the surrounding darkness feel deeper.

I grabbed my backup flashlight from the cab and was turning to head back when a sound froze me in place.

It started as a low rumble, almost subsonic, that I felt in my chest before I actually heard it. Then it rose into something between a roar and a howl‚Äîa guttural, primal sound that seemed to come from something with a throat structure unlike any animal I knew. The call lasted maybe five seconds, echoing through the trees and seeming to come from all directions at once.

When it ended, the silence that followed was somehow worse than the sound itself.

That's when the creature stepped into the Honda's headlight beams.

""Sir?"" The woman's voice was urgent now. ""We need to go. Right now.""

I didn't argue. I climbed into my truck, put it in gear, and started pulling the Honda back toward the road. The chains were taut, the car rolling smoothly behind me, when something massive crashed through the underbrush directly in front of us.

It stepped into the full glare of my headlights, and for one terrifying moment, I saw it clearly.

The creature was enormous, at least nine feet tall, maybe more. Its body was covered in thick, shaggy, dark hair that seemed to absorb the light rather than reflect it. The shoulders were impossibly broad, the arms so long they nearly reached its knees. Its hands ended in fingers that looked more like thick, clawed talons.

But the worst part was its face. It resembled that of a human, but with proportions that shouldn't exist on neither man nor beast. The eyes were deep-set and intelligent, reflecting my headlights with a yellow-green shine. When it opened its mouth, I could see teeth that were designed for tearing.

It stood there in the road for maybe three seconds, studying us with that terrifying intelligence. Then it began walking toward my truck.

""GO!"" the woman screamed from behind me. ""*GO GO GO*!""

I gunned the engine, hoping to scare it off, but the creature didn't flinch. Instead, it picked up speed, moving faster than anything that size should be able to move.

My truck lurched forward, the Honda's weight dragging behind me, but we were moving too slowly. The creature reached my driver's side door just as I managed to get us rolling. Through the window, I found myself looking up into its face from less than three feet away.

It placed one massive hand against my door, and I heard the metal groan under the pressure. The handprint it left behind completely covered the window‚Äîfingers easily twice the length of a human's, with what looked like thick, black claws at the tips.

For a moment, we were locked in this impossible stare-down. Me gripping the steering wheel so hard my knuckles had gone white, and this thing studying me with eyes that held far too much awareness. I could hear its breathing...deep, measured breaths that fogged the glass between us.

Then something seemed to shift in its expression, and it stepped back.

I didn't wait to see what it would do next. I floored the accelerator, pulling the Honda behind me as fast as the tow chains would allow. In my side mirror, I watched the creature grow smaller, but it didn't disappear into the forest. It just stood there in the middle of the road, watching us go.

We didn't stop until we reached the gas station eight miles down Route 47. My hands were shaking so badly I could barely put the truck in park. Behind me, I could hear the woman crying. Not hysterical sobs, but the quiet crying of someone who'd just survived something that shouldn't be survivable.

When I finally got out to unhook her car, I saw what the creature had left behind. There was a handprint pressed deep into the metal of my truck's door‚Äînot just on the surface, but actually deformed inward like the metal was soft clay. Each finger had left a distinct impression, complete with claw marks that had scratched through the paint down to bare steel.

The woman stood next to me, staring at the evidence of what we'd just encountered.

""Those weren't there before,"" she whispered.

""No,"" I agreed. ""They weren't.""

We stood there in the harsh fluorescent light of the gas station, both looking at proof that what we'd experienced was undeniably real. Physical evidence that something impossibly strong had touched our vehicles, had been close enough to kill us both if it had chosen to.

""What do you think it wanted?"" she asked.

I thought about those intelligent eyes, the way it had studied us both so carefully. ""I don't think it wanted to hurt us,"" I said finally. ""I think it was... curious.""

She nodded slowly. ""Like it was trying to figure out what we were.""

I called in sick for the rest of my shift and drove straight home. Spent the next hour sitting in my kitchen, drinking coffee and trying to make sense of what had happened. 

The rational part of my mind kept searching for explanations‚Äîmaybe someone in an elaborate suit, maybe a circus animal that had escaped. But the handprints on my truck door told a different story. No person, no matter how large, could have compressed steel like that. And no known animal moved the way that creature had moved.

I still work the night shift. I still take calls along Route 47 when they come in. But now I carry extra flashlights, and I never work alone in areas where the trees grow thick and the fog rolls in heavy.

I had the handprints on my truck filled and painted over, but sometimes, late at night when I'm driving those dark stretches of highway, I run my fingers over the spot where they were and remember.

Because whatever's out there in those woods, it's still out there. And now I know it's curious about us.

1n09uds,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1n09uds,Stop Guessing: Small Business Guide to Accurate Sales Forecasting (Without a Crystal Ball).,"# How to Forecast Sales Accurately (Without Historical Data or a Crystal Ball)

Starting a new business is an exhilarating mix of passion, innovation, and‚Ä¶ a little bit of terror. You‚Äôve got a brilliant idea, a product you believe in, and the drive to succeed. But then the questions start rolling in, especially from potential investors, partners, or even just your own pragmatic inner voice: ""What are your sales projections?"" ""What's the revenue forecast for the first three years?""

If you‚Äôre launching something brand new, that question can feel like a trap. Without a single customer or a day of sales history, how can you possibly predict the future? It feels like you need a crystal ball.

Here‚Äôs the good news: you don‚Äôt.

Accurate and credible sales forecasting is less about magic and more about methodology. It's a foundational skill for any startup founder. A well-reasoned forecast doesn't just satisfy investors; it becomes your strategic roadmap. It helps you manage cash flow, set realistic goals, plan inventory, make hiring decisions, and measure your success. It transforms your ambition into a tangible plan.

This guide will walk you through three powerful **sales forecasting methods** that are perfect for startups and businesses without historical data. We'll ditch the crystal ball and replace it with strategic analysis, giving you the tools to build a confident and defensible **revenue projection**.

# The Three Pillars of Pre-Launch Forecasting

When you have no past, you have to look outward and inward. The most reliable **startup financial projections** come from a combination of three distinct approaches:

1. **The Top-Down Analysis:** Starting with the entire market and carving out your piece of the pie.
2. **The Bottom-Up Analysis:** Building your forecast from the ground up, based on your own activities and capacity.
3. **The Competitor & Market Analysis:** Using existing players as a benchmark to ground your numbers in reality.

The magic happens when you use all three. If your bottom-up numbers are in the same ballpark as your top-down figures, you've got a forecast that‚Äôs not just optimistic, but also realistic and defensible. Let's break down each one.

# Methodology 1: The Top-Down Analysis (The Big Picture)

The top-down approach starts with the largest possible market and systematically narrows it down to the segment you can realistically capture. It‚Äôs a favorite for understanding your potential scale and for high-level presentations. The key is to move from the total universe of customers to *your* customers.

This is done using a three-step framework: TAM, SAM, and SOM.

**1. Total Addressable Market (TAM):** This is the total market demand for a product or service. It represents the maximum revenue you could possibly generate if you achieved 100% market share. It's the entire pie.

* **How to Calculate It:** Use industry reports, market research firms (like Gartner, Forrester, or IBISWorld), government statistics, and trade association data.

**2. Serviceable Available Market (SAM):** This is the segment of the TAM that your products and services can actually reach. It‚Äôs limited by your business model, geographic reach, and specialization. For example, if your TAM is the global coffee market, your SAM might be the U.S. market for specialty coffee subscription boxes.

* **How to Calculate It:** Refine your TAM data by applying filters specific to your business. What percentage of the total market fits your product's niche? Who are the customers you can *actually* serve?

**3. Serviceable Obtainable Market (SOM):** This is the portion of the SAM that you can realistically capture in the near term, usually in your first few years. This is your target market share, considering your competition, marketing budget, sales team capacity, and brand awareness.

* **How to Calculate It:** This is where internal factors meet external reality. A realistic SOM for a startup in its first year might be 1-5% of the SAM, depending on the industry's competitiveness and your resources.

**Example in Action: ""Artisan Roast Club""**

Let's imagine you're launching ""Artisan Roast Club,"" a direct-to-consumer subscription box for ethically sourced, single-origin coffee beans.

* **TAM:** You find a report stating the total U.S. coffee market is worth $85 billion annually. That‚Äôs your TAM.
* **SAM:** You dig deeper. Research shows that the specialty coffee segment is $25 billion, and the subscription box portion of that is $1.5 billion. You only ship within the continental U.S., which represents 90% of that market.
   * *Calculation:* $1.5 billion \* 90% = $1.35 billion. This is your SAM.
* **SOM (Year 1):** You're a brand new player with a modest marketing budget. You believe you can realistically capture a small fraction of the market to start. You aim for 0.1% market share in your first year.
   * *Calculation:* $1.35 billion (SAM) \* 0.1% = $1.35 million.

**Your Year 1 top-down sales forecast is $1.35 million.**

**Best Practices for Top-Down Forecasting:**

* **Cite Your Sources:** Always document where you got your TAM and SAM numbers. This adds immense credibility.
* **Be Conservative:** It‚Äôs tempting to claim you‚Äôll capture 10% of the market in year one. Resist. A conservative, well-justified SOM is far more believable.
* **Show Your Work:** Don't just present the final number. Walk your audience through the TAM-SAM-SOM funnel so they understand the logic.

# Methodology 2: The Bottom-Up Analysis (The Reality Check)

If the top-down forecast is about what‚Äôs *possible*, the bottom-up forecast is about what‚Äôs *plausible* based on your direct efforts and resources. You start with the fundamental drivers of your business‚Äîwebsite traffic, sales calls, store footfall‚Äîand build your revenue projection from there.

This method forces you to think tactically. How will you *actually* get customers?

**How to Build a Bottom-Up Forecast:**

1. **Identify Your Sales Channels:** Where will sales come from? (e.g., website, social media ads, direct sales team, retail partners, farmer's markets).
2. **Estimate Channel-Specific Metrics:** For each channel, forecast the key activities and conversion rates.
   * **For a website:** Monthly Visitors x Conversion Rate (%) = Number of Customers
   * **For a direct sales team:** Number of Reps x Calls per Rep per Month x Call-to-Sale Conversion Rate (%) = Number of Customers
   * **For paid ads:** Ad Spend / Cost Per Click (CPC) = Clicks to Site. Clicks to Site x Conversion Rate (%) = Number of Customers.
3. **Calculate Average Revenue Per Customer:** What is the average order value or lifetime value of a customer?
4. **Do the Math:** Multiply the number of customers from each channel by the average revenue per customer.

**Example in Action: ""Artisan Roast Club"" (continued)**

Let's assume the average subscription price for Artisan Roast Club is $40/month, or $480/year.

* **Channel 1: Paid Social Media Ads**
   * Monthly Ad Spend: $5,000
   * Industry Average Cost Per Click (CPC): $2.00
   * Monthly Clicks: $5,000 / $2.00 = 2,500 visitors
   * Estimated Website Conversion Rate: 2%
   * Monthly New Customers: 2,500 \* 2% = 50
   * *Monthly Revenue from Ads:* 50 customers \* $40 = $2,000
* **Channel 2: Organic Content & SEO**
   * Estimated Monthly Website Visitors from SEO: 1,500
   * Estimated Conversion Rate: 1.5% (often lower than paid traffic)
   * Monthly New Customers: 1,500 \* 1.5% = 23 (rounded)
   * *Monthly Revenue from SEO:* 23 customers \* $40 = $920
* **Channel 3: Influencer Marketing**
   * You partner with 5 coffee influencers who you project will drive 1,000 visitors each.
   * Total Visitors: 5 \* 1,000 = 5,000
   * Estimated Conversion Rate (higher due to trust): 3%
   * Monthly New Customers: 5,000 \* 3% = 150
   * *Monthly Revenue from Influencers:* 150 customers \* $40 = $6,000

**Total Bottom-Up Monthly Forecast:** $2,000 (Ads) + $920 (SEO) + $6,000 (Influencers) = **$8,920 per month.**

**Your Year 1 bottom-up sales forecast is $8,920 x 12 = $107,040.** (Assuming these numbers hold steady, though in reality you'd project growth month-over-month).

**Best Practices for Bottom-Up Forecasting:**

* **Be Realistic with Conversion Rates:** Research industry benchmarks. A 2% conversion rate for e-commerce is a common starting point. Don't assume 10% of visitors will buy.
* **Factor in Capacity:** Your forecast can't exceed your ability to deliver. Can your team handle that many orders? Can your servers handle that much traffic?
* **Connect to Your Budget:** Your bottom-up forecast should directly correlate with your marketing and sales budgets. If you want to double sales from ads, you need to double your ad spend.

# Methodology 3: Competitor & Market Analysis (The Sanity Check)

This method uses existing businesses as a proxy to understand what‚Äôs normal in your industry. By analyzing competitors and analogous businesses, you can ground your own projections in reality. This isn't about copying them; it's about learning from them.

**How to Conduct This Analysis:**

1. **Identify Your Competitors:** Find both direct competitors (doing exactly what you do) and indirect competitors (solving the same problem differently).
2. **Gather Financial Clues (Be a Detective):**
   * **Public Companies:** If any competitors are publicly traded, their financial reports (like 10-K and 10-Q filings) are a goldmine of data on revenue, growth rates, and customer acquisition costs.
   * **Private Companies:** This is trickier. Look for press releases announcing funding rounds (which often mention revenue milestones), news articles, interviews with founders, and data from platforms like Crunchbase or PitchBook.
   * **Analogous Businesses:** If you‚Äôre the first in your niche, look at a similar business in a different industry. Launching a subscription box for dog toys? Look at the growth trajectory of a subscription box for coffee or makeup.
3. **Analyze Non-Financial Metrics:**
   * **Employee Count:** LinkedIn is great for this. A company's size can give you a rough estimate of its operational scale and revenue. There are industry benchmarks for revenue-per-employee.
   * **Web Traffic:** Use tools like Similarweb or Ahrefs to estimate their website traffic. If you know their traffic and can apply a standard conversion rate, you can get a rough sales estimate.
   * **Pricing & Product Tiers:** Analyze their pricing structure. This tells you their average revenue per customer.

**Example in Action: ""Artisan Roast Club"" (continued)**

* You find a direct competitor, ""BeanBox,"" that is privately owned. A tech news article mentions they raised $5 million last year and had ""achieved a $10 million annual revenue run rate.""
* You find another competitor, ""Trade Coffee,"" and see on LinkedIn they have 150 employees. Using an industry benchmark of $150,000 revenue per employee for e-commerce companies, you can estimate their revenue is around $22.5 million.
* You see that both companies spend heavily on social media and have a strong influencer presence, validating your bottom-up channel strategy. Their pricing is also in the $35-$45 per month range, confirming your price point is competitive.

This analysis tells you that building a multi-million dollar business in this space is clearly possible, and your top-down forecast of $1.35 million in Year 1, while ambitious, isn't completely out of line with the market's potential.

# Bringing It All Together: Triangulating Your Final Forecast

Now you have three different numbers:

* **Top-Down Forecast (SOM):** $1,350,000
* **Bottom-Up Forecast:** $107,040
* **Competitor Analysis:** Suggests that seven-figure revenues are achievable for established players.

Notice the huge gap between the top-down and bottom-up forecasts. This is extremely common!

* The **top-down** shows the *opportunity*.
* The **bottom-up** shows the *operational reality* based on your starting resources.

Your real, defensible forecast lies in reconciling the two. The initial bottom-up number is likely your most realistic starting point for Year 1. The top-down number becomes your stretch goal and informs your long-term (Year 3-5) **startup financial projections**.

Your narrative becomes: ""Our initial, conservative forecast for Year 1 is \~$110,000, based on a detailed, channel-by-channel plan. However, the market size (SOM) is over $1.3M for just a 0.1% share, demonstrating a massive potential for growth as we scale our marketing efforts and reinvest revenue.""

**Final Tips for a Top 1% Sales Forecast:**

1. **Document Every Assumption:** Why did you pick a 2% conversion rate? Where did you get your CPC data? Every number should have a justification. This turns a guess into an estimate.
2. **Create Scenarios:** Don't just present one number. Create three forecasts: a **realistic** (base case), an **optimistic** (best case), and a **pessimistic** (worst case). This shows you've considered risks and opportunities and prepares you for any outcome.
3. **It's a Living Document:** Your first forecast will be wrong. That's okay. The goal is to be thoughtful, not psychic. As soon as you start operating, you will get real data. Update your forecast monthly or quarterly. The process of forecasting is as valuable as the forecast itself.

Forecasting sales without historical data is an essential startup skill. By combining a big-picture vision (top-down), a tactical execution plan (bottom-up), and a dose of reality from the market (competitor analysis), you can build a **revenue projection** that is credible, strategic, and powerful. You've got this.

Alright you beautiful people, listen up!

Get your Wacom tablets, your Crayola crayons, or that half-empty can of MS Paint ready, because we're officially announcing the r/GusJohnson End-of-Summer Art Contest!

We've all been there, watching a stream, minding our own business, when Gus says or does something so profoundly weird that it gets seared into our brains forever. Now's the time to turn that memory into art... and cash!

**The Theme:** Best Stream Memory From The Last Year That's right, we want you to immortalize your favorite moment from a Gus Johnson stream from the past year (roughly August 2024 - August 2025).

Did you love a particular rant about a weirdly specific type of guy? Was there a moment of pure, unadulterated video game rage? A scuffed bit that was funnier than the actual planned bit? A guest appearance that went completely off the rails? Draw it, paint it, sculpt it, meme it. If it happened on stream in the last year, it's fair game.

**The Rules & How To Enter**

This is the important part, so don't be a silly goose.

* Contest Duration: The contest starts NOW and will run for TWO WEEKS, ending on Monday, September 8th, 2025 at 11:59 PM PDT.
* How to Submit: Post your masterpiece directly to the r/GusJohnson subreddit. You MUST use the ""Art Contest Submission"" post flair so we can find it! If you don't use the flair, we might miss it, and that would be a real ""I Don't Like That"" moment.
* Art Medium: All visual art is welcome! Digital, traditional, pixel art, a really well-photographed sculpture made of gas station truck nuts‚Äîyou name it.
* Originality: Your submission must be your own original work. This means no AI generated slop. Don't try to pull a fast one on us.

**Judging & Voting Process**

This is a two-phase process, more complex than ordering a simple coffee.

* **The Review Stream:** Gus and the moderator team will review the submissions LIVE on stream! We'll ooh, we'll aah, and we'll probably get sidetracked talking about regional gas station chains for 20 minutes.
* **The Community Vote:** After the review stream, we'll gather all the eligible submissions into an official voting thread/poll. The entire community will then vote for their favorites. The top three pieces with the most votes will be crowned our winners.

**The Prizes (The Good Part)**

>""Show me the money!"" - Some Guy from a Movie

* 1st Place: $50
* 2nd Place: $30
* 3rd Place: $20

That's some cold, hard cash you can use to buy a nice steak dinner, a weirdly large bag of beef jerky, or approximately 16% of the average month of rent in the USA.

# TL;DR

* **What:** Art Contest
* **Theme:** Best stream moment from the last year.
* **When:** Now until Monday, September 8th.
* **How:** Post your art on the subreddit with the ""Art Contest Submission"" flair.
* **Prizes:** $50 / $30 / $20

We can't wait to see what your brilliant, goblin-like minds create. Good luck, have fun, and may the best artist win.

I take hill station trips once a year to reset, I‚Äôm almost apolitical, Hindu by identity (but neither strictly religious nor atheist), and I drink/smoke socially.

What I‚Äôm looking for? Someone I can share both silly and significant moments with‚Äîsending each other lame selfies, making each other laugh on lame jokes, maybe even waking up on lazy Sunday mornings to share a virtual coffee. Someone who can talk career dreams, life struggles, or just nonsense when needed. Ultimately, yes, I hope for something long-term, but I‚Äôd like to take it one step at a time.

About you: ideally 23‚Äì29, someone looking for a real connection and willing to offer the same. Knows Tamil  or comfortable in English (my Hindi is a work in progress üòÖ). Career-minded, empathetic, and open-hearted.

Ohh that's  a longgg post ü§≠..Thanks if you're till here and If this resonates, maybe it‚Äôs worth seeing where a conversation could take us. So, drop me a DM and let‚Äôs find out.",1,1756174345.0,SFWr4rIndia,0,1.0,False

1n09saa,https://www.reddit.com/r/Kombucha/comments/1n09saa/kahm_recovery/,Kahm Recovery,"I had a good thing going. I had a continuous brew cycle going well, but life got in the way and it got too acidic. So I decided to use it as starter liquid to make a new one gallon batch. I changed two things from my typical procedure:

1. I did not use any pellicle in the new batch. 
2. I boiled only the water to make the tea and dissolve the sugar. The rest of the water was cold tap (well) water.

Standard recipe: 1 cup sugar, 6 black tea bags, water, starter liquid. I used a lot of starter liquid, so the starting pH was actually lower than 4. I figured that was okay, since I wanted to grow a new pellicle and thought it would help the culture outcompete mold, etc.

Then I saw the tell-tale signs: powdery white spots that like to cling to the glass. Kahm.

‚ÄúNot in my brew house!‚Äù I thought to myself, so I ditched all kombucha, cleaned everything with PBW, and followed that by a three day soak in fresh starsan. I ordered a new culture (fermentaholics). I would restart from scratch.

This time I boiled all water, and resanitized everything down to rubber bands. I even brewed it away from where I normally brew and used beer-level sanitation. I use coffee filters for covering and carefully picked two from the center of pack to avoid any that might have accumulated any trace of dust. pH after pitching the culture was 4.1.

Three days later kahm started forming. I hoped I was wrong and let go for a few days, but it developed all the hallmarks of a kahm infection.

My only guess at this point is that kahm yeast can yeast can form a biofilm on glass that is somewhat impervious to PBW and starsan, and that maybe I didn‚Äôt do enough mechanical scrubbing? Do I need to boil all my equipment?

I also ferment ciders and wines without issue, but those are anaerobic ferments.

Anyone experience anything similar and recovered? If so how? I know some people scrape it off and move on, but to me that feels like minimizing an infection instead of eliminating it.

First we disassembled every piece of the assembly, and I took the center base piece (sorry I‚Äôm sure there is a proper term for it) to the table saw.  After chopping it down to the perfect height we turned our attention to the table top.  I laminated 2 layers of mdf underneath the table and secured them with glue and screws.  I then trace routed the edges so that everything was flush all around.  I then rounded over the bottom edge to help keep a soft stone like feel to the table rather than a ‚Äúpopped out of a form‚Äù look.

We then went to town doing 2 layers of Feather Finish with our hands to give it that smooth yet imperfect look.

In the meantime while that dried we sanded all the pieces and gave the fresh wood a new stain.  Finished it with a few light coats of satin poly to seal it in.

Ladies and gentlemen, gather ‚Äòround for a match that‚Äôs as chaotic as a toddler‚Äôs art class‚ÄîNorwich City vs. Southampton in the EFL Cup. Let‚Äôs parse the odds, news, and absurdity to predict who‚Äôll advance.

**Odds Breakdown: The Math of Mayhem**  
The bookmakers are throwing their hands up in despair. Norwich sits at **+285** (decimal: 2.85), implying a **26-28% chance** to win. Southampton, the slightly less unlikelier hero, is at **+200** (decimal: 2.25), translating to a **33-36% chance**. The draw? A 34% probability, or roughly the odds your dry cleaner will return your favorite jacket intact. The spread favors Southampton by **-0.25**, meaning they‚Äôre expected to win or lose by less than a goal‚Äîa bet as thrilling as watching your neighbor‚Äôs lawnmower ‚Äúrace‚Äù a squirrel.

**Injuries: The Real-Life ‚ÄòWho‚Äôs Missing?‚Äô Game**  
Norwich‚Äôs injury list reads like a ‚ÄúWhere‚Äôs Waldo?‚Äù for defenders: Solly March (knee surgery), Adam Webster (cruciate ligament), and Tariq Lamptey (ankle) are all MIA. Their backline? A Jenga tower held together by hope and a single cup of overpriced coffee. Southampton, meanwhile, has a healthier squad but carries the weight of their own late-game theatrics. Last week, they drew with Derby County after Carlton Morris snatched a last-minute equalizer‚Äîbecause nothing says ‚Äúreliable offense‚Äù like a 94th-minute Hail Mary.

**Recent Form: A History of Last-Minute Drama**  
Norwich‚Äôs 1-1 draw with Manchester United was a masterclass in chaos: an own goal, a late equalizer, and Bruno Fernandes missing a penal

My favorite was 2013. About to be out of college. Newly wed. Tiny house, but so cozy and filled with love. So many dreams for the future. My now ex husband worked 6 am to 5 pm. I went to clinicals Mon-Wed 8-5. Lecture was Thursday and Friday 9 am to about 1. After clinicals or school, I would go home, change into my workout clothes and go run 5-7 miles. Get home in time for my husband to get off work and shower. Then we'd either make something healthy or go get low carb burgers or wraps. Sometimes hot wings. We sat in the living room together every night. Either watching The Walking Dead, Breaking Bad, Son's of Anarchy... Or I would be studying and he'd be playing his acoustic guitar. Then he'd go to bed and I would stay up studying, taking breaks to scroll Facebook. I loved drinking coffee in silence before class. I loved taking naps after class with the screen door open and the breeze going through the house. I loved turning on black metal and doing a PowerPoint while my cat sat beside me on the couch. My husband wasn't drinking heavily. I wasn't depressed. 

I think we'd still be together if we didn't have our son. 16 years down the drain because having an autistic child made me lose my mind and him start drinking in excess.

Hi there,

I am a 33 year old guy from Michigan and I am hoping to meet someone genuine to connect with. I am open to friendship, dating, or just seeing where things naturally go. I am laid back, friendly, and always up for a good laugh. When the weather is nice you will usually find me outside camping, hiking, or spending time by the water. During the colder months I am all about staying in with coffee, a good book, or binging a series.

A little about me. I am 5‚Äô10 with an athletic build, green eyes, and brown hair. I do not smoke, and I drink socially. I try to live an active lifestyle and enjoy keeping busy but I also know how to slow down and enjoy the quiet moments.

What I am looking for is someone who is down to earth, fun to talk to, and open to building a steady connection without games or drama. I am very open minded when it comes to age and body type because I believe trust, communication, and a solid mental connection are what matter most.

I think life is better when you have someone to share it with, whether that means grabbing coffee, going for a walk, sharing stories, or even something more if the connection is right. If you are someone who values laughter, honesty, and just enjoying the simple things, I would love to get to know you.

my current medical history\conditions-

diagnosed with dysautonomia and pots in 2021, have been on the medication fludrocortisone for the better part of four years. (.05 every other day) weaned myself down to .025 every other day over the course of about a month, out of fear of dependence. issues started soon after this

started being a regular caffeine fiend in January of this year, about 126mg every morning for a few months.
about 3 months ago I started having out of the blue insomnia, I can describe this as total loss of the ""sleepy"" feeling you get before going to bed. out of nowhere. was accompanied with bouts of anxiety because of lack of rest, horrible hallucinations. for about a week I would feel physically exhausted but be unable to go to bed, would eventually crash for about 3 hours around 5:00 a.m. every other night or so. tried everything, stopped eating earlier in the day, quit caffeine, melatonin 1mg (which just made my body incredibly heavy never providing any sleepiness) chamomile tea, which proved effective for about one night and then nothing.

around a week of this, and I started to be able to go to sleep, around 6 hours a night. but not out of sleepiness, rather forcefully making myself lie still, close my eyes and getting lucky. this is Been more or less the case for about a month, resumed a decreased level of caffeine intake every morning and I think it definitely helped rather than going cold turkey, suspicious that that might have something to do with it. STILL, the sleepy feeling never returned. I feel like I'll never get it back,

NOW though, out of nowhere again, I can't even sleep at all. got an incredible wave of panic after work about 3 days ago, landed in the hospital labs we're in relatively normal ranges, think I might have ingested some kind of bacteria from the work coffee machine as it was then accompanied with GI issues, that night (and currently ) though it feels like it's gone. my ability to get any rest. noticeably worse than last time, came home from the hospital and took a low dose aspirin just for some nagging pain and couldn't sleep. The NEW thing now though that's terrifying is that, when I lay down and try to make myself close my eyes like before, I'll get immediate hot flashes, jitteriness. don't know how else to explain it, it's like as soon as my body is supposed to start producing whatever it is that would put me to sleep something else kicks on and stops it from happening.

apologies for the rambling nature of this, just taking a shot in the dark to see if anyone else has had anything even remotely similar to this happen, and what ended up helping resolve it. have requested many appointments with an endocrinologist, different specialists etc. insurance only covers people who have availability 10 months or more out, I used to receive biannual MRIS for a mild flattening of my pituitary, but a chains and insurance has stopped these for around a year. I have requested desperately that I get one soon though if possible. still waiting on response.

any words at all would be helpful, thank you if you made it to the end",2,1756173216.0,insomnia,5,1.0,False
1n09dq8,https://www.reddit.com/r/OpenHFY/comments/1n09dq8/that_professor_8/,That Professor 8,"Mr Warlow was having is morning coffee. In front of him was a blank canvas sitting on his easel. He did not feel like painting the same tree again. 

He had moved his easel and chair to a window that directly faced to Staples.

He was about to start painting their house when he heard a heavy rumble coming down the road. 

He moved to advantage point where you can see down the road. A truck filled with building materials on its flat deck appeared coming towards this Staples house. 

The truck stopped in front of their house and using the truck crane started depositing the materials around the house. 

Mr Warlow got is jacket on, grabbed this cane and  headed to the Staples. Eventually he got there .

Winona which had been observing the materials being dropped off saw Mr Warlow coming towards her door. She went out and met him halfway. With a wink she invited  him for a coffee. Mr Warlow sad at the table and asked for water instead. 

Winona handed  him a water and one for herself. ""Winona are you building an extension for new children? Are you pregnant??"" He joked. 

""The number of times I have to answer the door every day is getting ridiculous. "" She said. ""The contractors will be here soon. They are building an 8-ft fence around our property. The professor said that would be the best way to stop Nobles and their Representatives from knocking on our door.""

She smiled as she got up and reached for a stack of signs that were facing the wall. 

A big stack said ""private property: do not enter"" these will be nailed to the fence every meter. She said. 

""We do not accept hand deliveries. Please put any letters in the mailbox."" For over the new mailbox she smiled. 

*The professor warned us not to accept any gifts from any Nobles as their are probably strings attached."" Her smile grew even bigger as she said *this is my favorite.""

""We have not seen Wyatt since he was 14 years old. For this reason we are not accepting any GIFTS addressed to either Wyatt Staples or any other members of our family.""

5 those signs would be spread two on the front fence and one for all 3 other sites she explained. 

He laughed and suddenly got up. I better get home and paint your house unless you wish to have a painting of an 8 ft fence and roof. 

They said goodbye to each other and he headed back to his house. He managed to outline the main points of the house before the construction crew arrived and started putting in the fence. 

He switched to a blank canvas and started painting the house with construction workers putting up fence poles. From memory he would later paint the house without the workers. 

The professor had managed to track down some of the loved ones of those that had perished by the Drazzan. He started contacting the relatives and pretending to be a reporter set up interviews. 

He discovered that Wyatt's teacher had no husband or children. He did manage to contact her sister. He got into his best suit and by rideshare headed back to the Nobles quarters. 

In this case he presented himself as the professor and not a reporter. He told her sister that he was interested in her story because the sacrifice she had made for the children before and during the incident. 

""Lord Gilmore came to talk to me right after he returns from the incident. He asked me if I had been in contact with my sister since she had left this station. I answered him no. And he seemed very relieved.""

The professor recorded the interview and also took notes. She continued 

""He praised how brave she was until the end. How she tried protecting the children until the Drazzon took her life. To me it sounded rehearsed and not sincere.""

She got up and reached in back of the drawer for a couple folded papers. 

""My sister and I had a habit of sending each other a Telegram each day. When we were both on the planet these will come out almost instant but as you know when one of us would be traveling in space it might take some days for either of us to receive the telegram depending on the distance.""

In her hands was five papers. ""Nobody has ever seen these. I received the first one four days after the Lord's visit.""

She started reading them out loud. 

""Day one of our trip. The students and teachers all seem to be in good spirit. I strongly believe fore Side will do good this year. All for now. Love you sister.""

She finished reading the first one hell of it in her hands for a minute then moved on to the second Telegram. 

""Day two of our trip. The classes we are giving to the children etc are doing good. I am glad I brought a book to keep occupied after classes. There is absolutely nothing to do to entertain ourselves. If I am getting bored I worry about the children also getting bored as they have absolutely no entertainment. That's all for today. Love you sister."" She finished the second one. 

""Dave 3. Same routine as the past day. Maybe I should have brought two books as I am almost done reading the one I have. I was sitting in the cafeteria with the other Nobles. Most around me were other teachers. The table beside us were Noble crew members. They were having a conversation about Lord Gilmore influencing the captain of the ship. They said our ship was separated from the flotilla because the Lord wanted to get to the moon faster. Another Noble asked doesn't that endanger us? Another Noble answered ""Yes but there is nothing we can do when a superior orders us to go faster."". That's all I have for today. Miss you and love you sister.""

""Day 4"" she started reading the next Telegram from her sister. ""Same as usual. I finished the book and it was pretty good. And when I return to the planet I will recommend that every ship carrying children for many hours should have either/or a play area and entertainment system available. When I did my regular routine checking in on the children I found them looking very bored in their quarters. I wished to talk to Lord Gilmore and ask him about being out of formation and way ahead of the other ships but he never left his quarters. That's all I have for today. Love you sister""

Her eyes we're getting wet as tears were on the edge of coming out. She started reading the 5th and final one.
 
""Day five classes went as usual today. I heard crew mentioned how worried they were of being separated from the rest of the group. I finally saw Lord Gilmore at the end of the classes. We had a heated conversation about us being out of formation and endangering the children. He mocked me and said to leave major decisions to him because as a teacher I would not understand the complexities of logistics and timing. I will write a complaint about the dangers of separating and even if I get in a little hot water I will write to the Cayston about his behavior. Must go write those complaints. Love you with all my heart sister.""

Tears were running down her cheeks.  Even though he was considered a commoner he put his hands on her hand to comfort her. She did not object. 

""Do you know if she ever got those complaints ou"" the professor asked. 

She responded ""no idea. When I got her personal items back the one thing missing was her tablet.""

They talked for another hour about her sister. Her dreams to become a teacher. Her love for students. 

When the professor asked for copies of the telegrams she happily let him copy them. 

At the end of the visit he was giving a courteous bow to her being Noble. Instead the teachers' sister grabbed them and pulled him in for a hug. ""Thank you professor for helping me get all these beautiful images of my sister back. I had not reread those telegrams since first receiving them. Having reread them now reminds me how much we loved each other my sister and I.""

He gave a respectful bow and said ""thank you my lady.""

While waiting for his rideshare he talked to himself. ""How deep do I want to get into this story? Seems like justice has failed so all the way.""

His ride arrived and he went home. 

The end

by [https://www.gptsportswriter.com](https://www.gptsportswriter.com) **Burton Albion vs. Lincoln City: The Underdog Who Isn‚Äôt (And Why You Should Bet on Them)**

Let‚Äôs cut through the noise: **Lincoln City** are the favorites here, and it‚Äôs not because they‚Äôve suddenly discovered the secret to time travel and stolen Burton Albion‚Äôs playbook. No, this is about math, injuries, and the cruel irony of football.

### Parsing the Odds: When the Bookies Whisper Secrets

The numbers scream ‚ÄúLincoln, Lincoln, Lincoln!‚Äù Burton Albion, the Championship‚Äôs ‚ÄúI-Used-to-Be-Respected‚Äù team, is priced at **+290 to +300** (decimal: 3.0‚Äì3.1), implying a **33‚Äì34% chance to win**. Lincoln City, a League One side, sits at **-225 to -230** (decimal: 2.25‚Äì2.3), translating to a **44‚Äì45% implied probability**. That‚Äôs not just a gap‚Äîit‚Äôs a moat with a drawbridge that‚Äôs *definitely* not letting Burton in.

The total goals line? A frugal **2.5**, with odds hovering around **1.88‚Äì1.94** for Over/Under. Expect a game slower than a spreadsheet audit. The spread? Lincoln is a **-0.25 favorite**, meaning bookmakers think they‚Äôll at least avoid losing by a goal. For context, that‚Äôs like betting your neighbor‚Äôs cat won‚Äôt knock over your coffee again.

### Injuries: Burton‚Äôs Worst Nightmare (and Lincoln‚Äôs Secret Weapon)

Burton is missing **Tariq Sessegnon** (mysterious ‚Äúother‚Äù injury‚Äîfootball‚Äôs version of ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not sick, I‚Äôm just‚Ä¶ tired‚Äù) and **Ryan Robinson** (knee). Sessegnon‚Äôs absence is like realizing you forgot to bring the salt to a saltwater taffy factory. Without him, Burton‚Äôs attack loses its spark, and their defense? Well, they‚Äôre still trying to figure out how to stop a stationary object, let alone a determined Lincoln striker.

Lincoln, meanwhile, are presumably at full strength (no injuries listed), which is either a blessing or a sign they‚Äôve stockpiled medical supplies like prepper squirrels.

diagnosed with dysautonomia and pots in 2021, have been on the medication fludrocortisone for the better part of four years. (.05 every other day) weaned myself down to .025 every other day over the course of about a month, out of fear of dependence. issues started soon after this 

started being a regular caffeine fiend in January of this year, about 126mg every morning for a few months.

 about 3 months ago I started having out of the blue insomnia, I can describe this as total loss of the ""sleepy"" feeling you get before going to bed. out of nowhere. was accompanied with bouts of anxiety because of lack of rest, horrible hallucinations. for about a week I would feel physically exhausted but be unable to go to bed, would eventually crash for about 3 hours around 5:00 a.m. every other night or so. tried everything, stopped eating earlier in the day, quit caffeine, melatonin 1mg (which just made my body incredibly heavy never providing any sleepiness) chamomile tea, which proved effective for about one night and then nothing. 

around a week of this, and I started to be able to go to sleep, around 6 hours a night. but not out of sleepiness, rather forcefully making myself lie still, close my eyes and getting lucky. this is Been more or less the case for about a month, resumed a decreased level of caffeine intake every morning and I think it definitely helped rather than going cold turkey, suspicious that that might have something to do with it.

Shopping: I really wanna experience American thrifting! It‚Äôs so much more different over there than here, any particular locations in SF and Oakland would be great! Especially if there‚Äôs a better chance for some more alternative/goth options!

Time limited activity/events: We‚Äôre in SF from 9/11 to 9/25 so if there‚Äôs anything on timelimited or exclusive events that‚Äôs on that‚Äôs worth checking out, please let me know!

And also recs of where to avoid are welcome! Food places that claim to be all that when they‚Äôre not etc!",0,1756172160.0,sanfrancisco,7,0.29,False

This one incident in my grandmas house when we lived there my family and I were all in the living room and my little brother was standing up talking to my older brother and I seen this huge shadow figure with a tall top hat on it looked like Abraham Lincoln hat and it had its hand on my brothers right side of his shoulder. February 2023, My family and I started packing up our belongings from my grandmas house in Lucerne we were moving to Hesperia. We got settled into our new home weird incidences began to happen about a month into moving in, while i would be asleep I would be woken up to extremely loud footsteps walking up and down the stairs and I use the word extremely because they sounded very heavy like a large mans footsteps, we were able to ignore it for a few months until we would hear voices in rooms we were alone in, one of my own experiences was I was going to check the mail but before I left I wanted to check my mom hadn‚Äôt checked it already so I went into her room and I didn‚Äôt see her in the main part so I walked into her bathroom and knocked on the bathroom door and I heard my mom said ‚Äúyeah?‚Äù and so I asked ‚Äúhave you checked the mail yet‚Äù and my mom said ‚Äúno I haven‚Äôt yet‚Äù I heard her right from the other side of the door but I said okay and started to walk out of her room and as I was walking past her bed and I seen my moms hair from under the blanket cuz when my mom sleeps she gets flat into the bed but then if she was in her bed sleeping who was I talking to in the bathroom rewind about a year My mom went out and bought a sage and later that day around 8 or 9 pm my mom my little brother and I walked around the house with my mom as she was saying prayers with the sage we went all around the house and even the backyard and it actually worked. So whatever was messing with us left for about two years in a half and we have all been fine until recently. A few weeks ago my older sister was watching the baby and I was in my room chilling and my sister came knocking at my door and said let me in and she seemed like creeped out so I let her in and she told me when she was in my moms room this little target cart that the baby has was in the bathroom and it moved on its own. The next day it‚Äôs gets really creepy the baby does this thing where he pushes shampoo or like fashwash into the bathtub so my mom has just gotten out of the bath and was by her bed when she heard this loud thump she went to go see and there was nothing that would have fallen to make that noise and the baby was sleeping. Later that day when the baby was awake but he had went silent which he usually does if he got distracted by something and my mom looked up from sitting on the bed and see the baby peeking his head around the corner and she thought it was funny so she stood up to see what he was up to and the baby was infront of the door no where near the bathroom. Also just a adds on yesterday my best friend was over and we were at the kitchen table drinking coffee and we heard walking down the stairs and I thought it was my brothers fat cat and I went to see and no one was there. And today we were going to visit my sister in the hospital cuz she just had her baby and I was about to get up and start getting ready but I was still laying down with my eyes closed contemplating to get up and I heard this loud whistling in my room and it really creeped me out so I got up and no one was there.

I am a 57 year old man from California and a few other places over the years who is looking for someone, a unique woman, smart and fit and with a touch of humor and sarcasm, fun to spend time with and true to herself and those around her. Introvert like me preferred but not a deal breaker, a woman who enjoys a night in on the couch and a movie, cares about her health and those around her, looking for the first voice I hear in the morning and the last voice at days end.  Someone to have private jokes with and other things that are ours and ours alone. 

Interests on my end are varied yet simple, I enjoy travel, mostly roadtrips, cooking and photography, writing and music, films, reading and coffee, can be found on a nice day off at the beach with my feet in the sand and just enjoying the waves. I am 420 friendly but edibles only as I don‚Äôt smoke and rarely drink, aside from the occasional single malt. I am a jeans and t-shirt Man, with a casual, laid back style who enjoy a good day at a street fair or just roaming thrift stores or a great garage sale (I always follow those homemade signs and pull over to check it out)..

Someone to connect with and continue to grow with, let‚Äôs chat and see how we vibe and take things from there, naturally and organically and see what develops. 

Location is not a factor but must be USA/Canada based NO exceptions, age is not a factor, It‚Äôs all about who you are as a person, and how we mesh together that matters most to me. So your age doesn‚Äôt matter, But, I do tend to connect better with those younger than me an

Your DM should tell me about you with age and location and your interests, Those with a picture attached are responded to first and your picture gets mine in reply, I get that this is where most women may freeze up, but lets be honest, pictures will be exchanged at some point and we both know that physical attraction matters to a certain degree and is somewhat important in the overall match up. Let‚Äôs do the picture thing now and just move past it.. 

Apologies if I am too blunt or transparent but it‚Äôs the way I am, I don‚Äôt do games, don‚Äôt ghost, don‚Äôt believe poly relationships, monogamy only here.

Chapter 1
I was the person my daughter hated most.

She loathed me for hiring a private tutor to drill her for SAT prep, for limiting her phone time. Sobbing, she swore I‚Äôd never measure up to her dad‚Äôs new girlfriend, Mel. She said Mel was the one who listened to her, played video games with her, took her to concerts‚ÄîMel was her real mom.

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre such a failure,‚Äù she spat. ‚ÄúNo wonder Dad doesn‚Äôt love you.‚Äù

That night, we had a huge fight.

In the dead of night, she stormed out, slamming the door behind her. I chased after her, but it ended with both of us in a car accident.

Lying in a pool of blood, she clutched her phone, sending a voice message to Mel.

[Mel, if there‚Äôs a next life, I hope you‚Äôre my mom.]

A tear mixed with blood trailed down my cheek.

When I opened my eyes again, I was back in the courtroom, the day of the custody battle.

I looked at my daughter, Maddie, sitting in the gallery. Setting the microphone down, I nodded respectfully to the judge.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm giving up my claim to custody.‚Äù

‚Ä¶

‚ÄúWhat the hell do you want?‚Äù

Christopher‚Äôs voice was low, his face so dark it could‚Äôve dripped with venom.

I sat on the cold bench outside the courtroom, twisting the cap back on my pen. Holding up the motion to withdraw my custody claim, I showed it to him.

‚ÄúI told you, I‚Äôm not fighting for custody anymore.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat game are you playing now?‚Äù

He snatched the document from me, his tone thick with suspicion. ‚ÄúWeren‚Äôt you the one who dragged me into this lawsuit in the first place?‚Äù

I didn‚Äôt answer. My eyes drifted to Maddie, standing a few steps away, leaning against the wall with her arms crossed. Her face twisted with disdain.

She wore a baggy hoodie, wireless earbuds dangling from her ears. She glanced at me, cold and fleeting, her lips curling into a mocking smirk.

‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs with the act?‚Äù she sneered. ‚ÄúAren‚Äôt you the one who loves controlling my life? Forcing me into SAT prep, hounding me to study, always pushing me to ‚Äòmake something of myself‚Äô?‚Äù

She stepped closer, looming over me, her gaze sharp as if she were staring down a defeated rival.

‚ÄúWhat, you‚Äôre giving up now? Finally facing reality?‚Äù

I met her eyes, my own calm, like still water.

She was beautiful‚Äîher features like mine from years ago, but her eyes, those were all Christopher‚Äôs. Cold. Judging. Untouchable.

‚ÄúDon‚Äôt worry,‚Äù I said, sliding the papers into Christopher‚Äôs hands. ‚ÄúYou win. I‚Äôm done with her.‚Äù

Christopher‚Äôs face shifted, shock flashing across it. ‚ÄúDo you even hear yourself?‚Äù

‚ÄúI know exactly what I‚Äôm saying.‚Äù

I stood up, my voice soft but deliberate, each word measured. ‚ÄúShe‚Äôs no longer my daughter.‚Äù

Maddie laughed, a sharp, incredulous sound, like I‚Äôd just told the world‚Äôs worst joke.

‚ÄúIs this another one of your mind games?‚Äù

‚ÄúYou always corner people, don‚Äôt you? Dad says you were always a control freak, too busy trying to control everyone else because you couldn‚Äôt even handle yourself.‚Äù

She leaned in, her voice cutting. ‚ÄúMel says women like you are nothing but a failure in life. You don‚Äôt deserve to be a mother.‚Äù

I picked up my bag, brushing a speck of dust off the hem of my coat.

‚ÄúYou want Mel to be your mom, don‚Äôt you?‚Äù

‚ÄúThen you get your wish.‚Äù

As I walked out of the courthouse, the sky was gray and heavy, like a storm ready to wash away the stains of the past.

My phone buzzed. A new email notification: my registered dietitian recertification had gone through.

I smiled faintly.

In this life, all I want is for you to grow up, to outlive me.

You want freedom? I‚Äôll give you freedom.

Chapter 2
She moved out.

She and her dad, along with that woman she called ‚Äúthe kindest, most understanding‚Äù Melissa Carter, settled into Harborview Apartment.

When she left, she didn‚Äôt even spare me a glance.

‚ÄúDon‚Äôt come looking for me,‚Äù she said, dragging her suitcase without turning back. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt want to upset Mel.‚Äù

I didn‚Äôt say a word.

The moment the elevator doors closed, the faint smirk on her lips stayed with me.

Maybe in her mind, she truly believed she had won.

There would be no one left to drag her to SAT prep courses, nag her about homework, or make her memorize formulas while handing her a mug of warm milk.

Her life was finally ‚Äúfree,‚Äù as she liked to call it.

When her counselor called, I‚Äôd just finished teaching a class.

‚ÄúMs. Grant, even though you‚Äôre no longer Madison‚Äôs guardian, I thought you should know‚Äîshe‚Äôs been struggling academically.‚Äù

‚ÄúShe‚Äôs been dozing off in class, missing assignments, and some of her classmates mentioned she stays up late gaming online.‚Äù

I replied coolly, ‚ÄúThanks for letting me know. I‚Äôm sure her father will take care of it.‚Äù

I hung up, returned to organizing my lecture notes, and prepared for the next week‚Äôs livestream.

I didn‚Äôt return to her school.

I didn‚Äôt speak to her again.

After she moved out, I changed my phone number, changed my address, and even left the school‚Äôs Remind group.

She was entirely on her own now.

During the first week of the fall semester, I started working at the community health center downtown.

I launched a series of public classes called ‚ÄúNutrition for Teens During SAT Prep.‚Äù

The organizers gave me an office to use as a livestream studio and booked me for a weekly nutrition segment.

My days quickly filled with scheduling classes, planning topics, and recruiting test subjects.

I barely had time to think about her.

One night, after a class, I scrolled through Instagram, like I always did.

Maddie had posted a story:

[SAT prep? Goodbye!]

The picture showed her and Melissa at a coffee shop, the filter soft and warm, with delicate pastries on the table and a bouquet of flowers in the background.

I scrolled through the comments. Her classmates were hyping her up:

[Mel totally gets you!]

[New stepmom vibes‚Äîlife‚Äôs sweet now!]

At the bottom, Madison had replied:

[People who screw up their own lives and try to control their kids are the worst. But lucky for me, I found someone who actually loves and understands me.]

I lingered on the screen for a moment, then locked my phone.

No comment. No like.

No reaction at all.

The next day, I was on my YouTube livestream, serving a nutritional lunch to a student.

‚ÄúThis week‚Äôs test subject is a senior from Springfield High School,‚Äù I announced.

The camera zoomed in on a girl with a high ponytail, sitting across from me, politely taking the lunchbox I handed her.

‚ÄúThank you, Ms. Grant,‚Äù she said.

I smiled. ‚ÄúThis is a salmon salad, a blueberry almond smoothie, and a grilled chicken quinoa bowl‚Äîa perfect nutrient balance for students in exam season.‚Äù

I added, ‚ÄúAnyone who signs up weekly can apply for meal delivery.‚Äù

After the stream, I sorted through feedback forms.

A private message popped up from the girl.

[Ms. Grant, your tips on blood sugar control were super helpful! My mom even said I picked a great program!]

Hey again KC Reddit! So last week I posted asking if anyone was interested in a coffee meetup. I have had many questions for a follow up, including even the people I had coffee with over the weekend! Given the repeated asks I figured I would do a follow up now rather than after I work through all the meetups I have ahead of me. 

First, I wanted to send a huge than you to everyone for all of the positivity in the comments. I could not have asked for a better response than I got in the comments! Second, the response from people reaching out has taken me by complete surprise. I was just hoping maybe one or two people would reach out. Instead, I have had more than 15 people reach, out as well as, many I have not even had a chance to respond to both in DM‚Äôs and the comments section. So I ask that if you did reach out and I have not responded yet that you please be patient and understand I will get to you. Due to the massive response I have had to start scheduling meetups multiple weeks out now.

Now on to the people I met. Thank you to Matt, Joe, Mary, and Rehan for meeting this weekend. It was great to meet you all and hear about all your varied backgrounds. I got to learn more about gardening, pharmaceutical robot programming, narcolepsy, thermal receipt paper, and the coffee shops downtown than I ever would have known otherwise.

Of the people who have reached out so far they have come in from all over the metro. NKC, Liberty, Lawrence, South OP, KCMO, Shawnee, and Prairie Village. Which means I have a lot of traveling to different areas to meet you all! ",81,1756170883.0,kansascity,2,0.96,False

The alarm blared, pulling me from a dream where I almost found love, but we were both too afraid to take the leap. Shaking off the lingering wistfulness, I almost didn't make it on time for my morning jog. As I laced my shoes, I almost dropped my phone, catching it just in time. The morning was crisp, and a new day stretched ahead, full of possibilities, and a few anxieties.

My career was a constant thought. Last week, I almost got that job, but they went with someone with more experience. It was a blow, but I almost gave up, but I'm glad I didn't because a new opportunity emerged. Personal desires also tugged at me. I almost bought my dream car, but the dealership sold it the day before. And then there was the house hunt. I almost bought a house, but the inspection revealed some major problems, saving me from a potential money pit.

Love, however, remained the trickiest endeavor. So many near misses. I almost found love, but she couldn't get over her past relationship. Another time, I almost found love, but it turned out we wanted different things in life. The geographical challenges were real too; I almost found love, but we lived too far apart. Then there was the elusive spark: I almost found love, but the spark fizzled out before we could ever start a fire. And sometimes, the barrier was me. I almost found love, but I was too scared of getting hurt to let her in. In one instance, I almost found love, but the timing was all wrong, and in another, I almost found love, but the timing wasn't right. Perhaps the most honest truth came when I almost found love, but I realized I needed to work on myself first.

Life's smaller, everyday moments were just as replete with ""almosts."" This morning, I almost forgot my keys before leaving the apartment. Yesterday, while making coffee, I almost tripped on the rug. There was that time I almost won the lottery, but my ticket was off by one number. Or the dream of travel: I almost booked the vacation of a lifetime, but a sudden expense came up. Even small acts of kindness: I almost called you, but it was too late last night when the thought crossed my mind.

Big decisions also hung in the balance. I almost moved to a new city, but decided to stay close to my family. The entrepreneurial spirit flickered: I almost started my own business, but I got cold feet at the last minute. Even creative pursuits had their stumbling blocks; I almost wrote that book, but I couldn't find the right ending.

Later that day, grabbing lunch, I almost ordered the same thing as you, but opted for something different. During a meeting, I almost said something, but bit my tongue. On the way home, a frantic moment: I almost missed my flight last month, a memory that still made my heart race. Tonight, I almost went to the store, but decided against it.

""Almost"" seemed to be the theme of my life. Yet, in every near miss, there was a lesson, a redirection, or a quiet moment of reflection. Perhaps the ""almosts"" weren't failures, but rather the essential detours that eventually lead us to exactly where we need to be.

I'm pretty new on it - 3 weeks at 20mg, and now in my 3rd week at 30mg.

I clenched my teeth a fair bit before, but now I find I do it a lot more.

But today I had coffee. Not decaf as I have been since starting Vyvanse, but just normal coffee. And I didnt catch myself clenching as much.
I didnt drink a lot of coffee previously, so going to decaf wasn't a problem.

I‚Äôm 1.5 years out and STILL VERY sensitive. I can‚Äôt eat sugar and just one cup of coffee will set off a huge flare for at least a few weeks. I probably won‚Äôt try alcohol for 5-10 years, that‚Äôs how sensitive I am. Tanning beds, chlorine (swimming pools), and fluoride also flare me HORRIBLY. Literally anything and everything that is a toxin, can harm your mitochondria, or that creates oxidative stress hurts me. 

My body seems to have a really hard time detoxing and getting rid of the fluoroquinolones. What doesn‚Äôt help is that I had to take 300-400 aspirin right after I took the fluoroquinolones.  I have two confirmed MTHFR variants and a couple other poor detoxing mutations (SOD, etc.) which makes it harder for my body. I‚Äôm already very aware of MTHFR genes and what I should do/avoid for those. 

It seems like most people can general tolerate caffeine on a daily basis, sugar, etc. after a year or so but I still can‚Äôt‚Ä¶ Like at all. In order to get my cells to clean themselves up, should I be taking the antioxidant route (CoQ10, ALA, vitamins C, E, etc.) or the mitophagy route (D-ribose, niacinamide, etc.) in very low and careful doses?

Any other suggestions for treatment? I just seem to be extremely sensitive and can‚Äôt figure out what my mitochondria need to get this significant healing going. Thanks! ",3,1756170377.0,floxies,0,1.0,False
