Climate scientists, government officials, tech entrepreneurs and others all have opinions about how humans should address the crisis, but many of them are leaving out something important: the experience and knowledge systems of the land’s original stewards — Indigenous peoples.

High Country News’ Indigenous affairs team has compiled three short profiles that center Indigenous people and their knowledge in the climate realm.

The profiles showcase the efforts and expertise of people who are working, in one capacity or another, to address climate concerns through data and knowledge sovereignty, promoting the act of close listening, and helping everyone involved understand the power and truth of Indigenous ways of knowing and experiencing landscapes.

They continue the work of their ancestors and remind us to take the time to really listen — not just to Indigenous stewards like them, but also to each other, and to the environment itself.

How 3 Indigenous women are leading the way on climate change
Amelia Marchand (Colville)

By B. “Toastie” Oaster

Indigenous people have so much to give, if people would just stop taking it,” said Amelia Marchand, senior tribal climate resilience liaison at the Affiliated Tribes of Northwest Indians (ATNI) and a citizen of the Confederated Tribes of the Colville Reservation.

“For so long, our knowledge has been extracted.” Science and academia, she explained, have a history of taking intellectual property from communities that do not benefit from its use.

Through her work at ATNI, Marchand guides climate scientists in conducting research equitably — by, for example, making data sovereignty or intellectual property agreements with Native communities before making use of Indigenous knowledge.

Ethically engaging with tribes, she said, requires ensuring that scientific research aligns with the priorities of tribal communities. Too often, state and federal agencies treat tribes as ordinary members of the general public. “Tribal nations are not a stakeholder group,” she explained, noting their status as governments.

“TRIBES ARE RIGHTS HOLDERS, NOT AN INTERESTED PARTY.”

Having recently relocated from the Colville Reservation to Kānaka Maoli lands on O’ahu, Hawai’i, Marchand now conducts trainings with tribes, universities, nonprofits and government agencies like the U.S. Geological Survey, working to develop climate strategies that include Indigenous priorities. “It’s advocating and educating at the same time,” she said.

Marchand said that while it may be possible to survive climate change without Indigenous leadership, that scenario is not a good one for the future. “It’s business as usual, with more of the same terrible history that’s led us here,” she said.

A better future will require a focus on equity.

“It’s interesting, the place where humanity finds itself, because we have all the tools — the technology, the wealth, the brainpower — to initiate those changes,” Marchand said. “What we lack is the political will.”

And Native leaders know how to implement traditional practices in a good way. As an example, she noted that in September, Interior Secretary Deb Haaland (Laguna Pueblo) revised four climate-related Interior Department policies, all of which now refer to Indigenous knowledge. Marchand credits “Auntie Deb” with implementing this knowledge at a federal level in a way that’s not extractive. “We, as a whole, would not be as far without her,” Marchand said.

Through ATNI, Marchand has had a hand in crafting policy resolutions that might influence states like Washington and Idaho, or perhaps pass up the chain to the National Congress of American Indians and on to the U.S. Congress.

Concerning more boots-on-the-ground changes, Marchand has also cofounded the L.I.G.H.T. Foundation, a nonprofit that supports native plant conservation and gathering traditions for Pacific Northwest tribes.

Working with climate sustainability students from Western Washington University, she’s used lessons about the protection of native plants and pollinators to talk to students about sovereignty, drawing attention to the braided nature of climate, conservation and Indigenous rights.

Lydia Jennings (Pascua Yaqui and Huichul)

By Anna V. Smith

‍

The global shift toward renewable energy is fueling growing demand for copper, lithium and manganese, minerals that are often found near tribal reservations or on sacred ancestral lands. At the same time, Indigenous knowledge is increasingly sought by governments and scientists to inform land management and climate research.

Lydia Jennings’ research sits at the nexus of these two tensions: She’s a soil microbiologist studying mining and natural gas sites near tribal communities.

Jennings, who is Huichul and a citizen of the Pascua Yaqui Tribe, splits her time between the very different biomes of Phoenix and Durham, North Carolina, as a postdoctoral researcher at Arizona State University’s School of Sustainability and a research fellow at the Nicholas School of Environment at Duke University.

In both roles, she’s deeply interested in how federal agencies and policies include tribal nations’ priorities and concerns. “We value Indigenous knowledge when it comes to healing the ecosystem, but don’t really value Indigenous knowledge when it comes to the proposal of a new mining site,” said Jennings.

Jennings was first drawn to the stories that soils tell when she worked as an environmental toxicologist at UC Davis. Traveling from the Tijuana River to the California-Oregon border, she noticed that soil pollution varied widely. Her research focused on a major source of environmental harm: hardrock mines and the tailings they leave behind.

“WE’RE TALKING ABOUT ALL THESE IDEAS AND CONCEPTS AROUND CLIMATE CHANGE AND INTEGRATING MORE INDIGENOUS KNOWLEDGE, AND THAT’S A BEAUTIFUL IDEA.”

Part of her dissertation at the University of Arizona dealt with the Rosemont Mine in the Sonoran Desert, a proposed copper mine southeast of Tucson, on a site that overlaps the ancestral lands of Jennings’ own tribe, as well as the Tohono O’odham Nation, the Hopi Tribe and others.

If approved, it would be the third-largest copper mine in the U.S. Jennings’ work underlined the importance of Indigenous rights in consultation and land management. That work catalyzed her interest in data sovereignty and the way Indigenous knowledge and information is shared.

“We’re talking about all these ideas and concepts around climate change and integrating more Indigenous knowledge, and that’s a beautiful idea,” Jennings said. “We need to also know that there are rights that communities have to protect that data, to be able to steward that data in the same way that they steward their ecosystems.”

That philosophy extends to climate research and tribal consent. In her current research with the Lumbee Tribe in North Carolina, Jennings is working with Ryan Emanuel, an assistant professor at Duke University and a citizen of the Lumbee Tribe, on environmental health concerns over methane gas emissions near the community.

The important thing, she said, is that “it’s work that upholds the questions and concerns a tribal nation has,” instead of being driven entirely by researchers from outside the community.

“It’s all really being led from community members themselves, and those who have a much longer understanding of both problems — the challenges — but also community dynamics and community-based solutions,” Jennings said.

When facing large-scale problems like climate change or influencing federal policy, Jennings looks to the past for strength to figure out solutions.

“We’re in a place where you have to make a lot of tough decisions, but it’s not the first time Native nations have ad to make those decisions, and it won’t be the last,” she said.

Jennings often thinks about the decisions prior tribal leaders had to make when confronting world-upending changes like colonization. “For better or for worse,” she said, “it’s a continuation of those responsibilities.”

Robera Tuurraq Glenn-Borade (Iñupiaq)

By Joaqlin Estus

‍

Iñupiaq Roberta Tuurraq Glenn-Borade’s passion for bringing Iñupiat knowledge to Western science stems from her childhood in Utqiaġvik, formerly known as Barrow, Alaska.

“My dad was a whaling captain and a sea ice scientist, and sometimes he would take me out to where the scientists in Barrow were deploying their instruments. But I noticed while I was growing up that there is a little bit of a cultural barrier between the scientists that were coming in and our Iñupiat people,” she said.

The researchers would describe things that were already obvious to the people: “For example, explaining to us what permafrost is when we already have an understanding of what that is,” Glenn-Borade said.

She said scientists used to disregard Indigenous knowledge. In the 1970s, the federal government imposed a harvest quota of zero bowhead whales, a crucial food source for the Iñupiat, due to low population estimates.

The Iñupiat knew that the population counts were wrong, because they didn’t include whales traveling under the ice. After the Iñupiat took over the count, “the quotas were updated to reflect a strong bowhead whale population, and the U.S. government began to take the voices of Indigenous folks in Alaska more seriously,” Glenn-Borade said.

In college, Glenn-Borade trained as a geoscientist and learned about research in other parts of Alaska: “I felt like I had a perspective I could share that could help bridge these two worlds.”

I FIND HOPE IN THE STRENGTH OF IÑUPIAT CULTURE

In January 2022, for her master’s thesis at the University of Alaska Fairbanks, Glenn-Borade published a story map — a digital map and narrative — that showcased the photos, data and voices of local observers across the state along with Western scientific information.

Entries about stormy weather, for example, appeared with a chart on the multi-year trend of increasingly wet summers, as well as a vignette from Iñupiaq Bobby Schaeffer of Qikiqtaġruk (Kotzebue) from September 2021:

“We had two storms go by back-to-back, producing gobs of rain and howling winds. ... Rising river and creek waters will cause more erosion. South winds will bring in storm surge and huge ocean waves will batter the beaches and cause more erosion on permafrost hills. ... Hunting efforts have been hampered by a lot of wind and rain.”

Now, Glenn-Borade is the project coordinator and community liaison for the Alaska Arctic Observatory and Knowledge Hub (A-OK), a partnership of communities in Arctic Alaska. The hub gives observers in several villages a platform to share their observations, knowledge and expertise on Arctic environmental change with each other as well as with other scientists.

In addition to warmer temperatures, locals are seeing changes in the sea ice and in the wind, along with increased coastal storms. “Yes, we have changes that are going on,” Glenn-Borade said. “Yes, there are struggles.

However, we are still able to harvest healthy animals. We’re still able to go out and practice our cultural traditions, our subsistence activities. We’re still here, and we’re going to continue to be here.

“I find hope in the strength of Iñupiat culture,” Glenn-Borade said. “That’s where I know we’re still able to have a positive attitude about things, because we still do… We’re living it.”

As far as solutions to climate change go, she said, “I have opinions about whose guidance and perspectives we should seek. For me, that’s the people who are living with these changes every day.”",1,1760393419.0,UnderReportedNews,0,1.0,False

When I think about my love, I think of her on some gorgeous mountain hike, surrounded by wildflowers, looking down on some ocean bay, watching the ships pass by. I think about collecting a handful of those wildflowers and giving them to her. We sit, feeling out the prickling mix of old heartbreaks, of loneliness, of our own times where we have felt not enough, not worth being loved. This song plays in my heart, in that moment when our eyes meet, and there are tears in both our eyes, and the words ""yes! It's you! You're the one I've waited so very long for, and though it took long years, it was worth every moment, just for this moment in your eyes. It's you! Wonderful you... and we belong together."" It's the moment where infatuation gives way to the wild, wonderful potential that there is true love, and that we both belong among the wildflowers.

Just as important to me as the moment of our eyes meeting, and seeing that love we both feel reflected in each other's eyes, is the moment when you begin trusting me with your wounds. One of the things I feel deeply is that my heart was meant to be a place of healing and peace for a love who has learned wisdom through that heartache. I want my arms to be your hedge of protection, my prayers to always bring your heaviness to God, and my lips to kiss every cut. To look into your eyes, that might look away lost in some old hurt, and to feel me reach out my hand to hold yours, and say ""you have come by way of sorrow, like me. But we are welcome at Love's table.""

Our first slow dance together. We find ourselves in some park in the cool of the evening, or on some porch, delaying our goodbyes, because it is so hard to go back into a world where you aren't right there with me. I laugh and start playing this song, holding out my hand to you. We dance, slowly, in each other's arms, just feeling how well our bodies, our arms, feel wrapped around each other. It's here, as Nora Jones says, ""come away with me"", that the impossible begins to feel not only possible, but like a plan: that we are going to leap from our lives alone, into each other's touch, and dance our way into some bright, beautiful future together.

And yet, ""never did the course of true love run smooth"". We will end up fighting. Stupid arguments. Mistakes. A drunken night where we both said things we regret. That moment when I truly love you, and because of that, feel the tearing pain in my chest of knowing I might lose you, or you might lose me. The dark walks alone, apart, in our own thoughts, trying to make sense of this part of loving someone, enjoy to see them in all their flawed humanity, and bitterness, and cruelty... and at last stay. The moment we sing ""I don't love you, but I always will.""

But then, wonderfully, we survive. From the early infatuation, from the wildflowers, from the sweet dances and first kiss. Through the preparation and prayer, through the hectic and nerve-wracking moments of meeting each other's family and friends, through the fights. Through the last doubts, we find ourselves at last here, on our wedding day. I imagine looking into my love's eyes, and saying with the weight of the months of work we have done to understand, to work, to be sure, every word of those vows. My love can hear it in my voice that I mean it. Every word. And I can see in my love's eyes that she knows I mean it. And though we both know quite well that the marriage is only sealing and showing to the world the work we have already begun, to become a family, it is still full of the weight of knowing that this day will be with us, for the rest of our lives.

And then... home! Home, my love. True home. I have been a nomad most of my life, traveling across states, across the world, never resting, never knowing that \*this\* is the place where I belong. This is the place we belong. This song plays one random day, in those first years of our marriage, and it hits me all at once that we've made it. We've done it! We have a family, a home- no, we are home. How could I help but rush from my car, half running up the steps, just to find you wherever you are, whatever you are doing, and hold you as close as my body will allow to me to press you into my soul, tears streaming from my eyes for a moment, as I whisper, ""thank you, and thank God, for you being my home.""

Our love has made our home into a place full of children. I remember watching my nephew's eyes open for the first time, those first bleary looks into this great, big world that is just waiting for him to explore, to love, to find what God has put in store for him around every turn. I can only imagine what that moment will feel like when it is mine and my love's child. But I have worked as a teacher, both elementary and high school, as well as a camp counselor and an interpretive park ranger. I have worked with children, and I know that joy is always mixed with the profound awareness that we do not really know what we are doing. There will be that moment, sometime around our children's teenage years, exasperated by yet another bad school grade, or fight, or breakup, or explosion of drama, where my love and I sigh, and looking at each other, laugh. ""Does anybody have a map, or happen to know how the hell to do this?"" I'll say, and we will breathe, knowing we can get through this, too, together.

We grow old together. Year after year, loving each wrinkle that shows in our faces, each new gray hair. And one day, we will blink and look up from our books, still cuddled comfortably together after all these years on the couch, reading. We'll look into each other's eyes, and think about our children, and their children. We'll know that it has been a journey, steeped in prayers, rich all along the way in God's guiding presence, with its fair share of hardships and heartaches. But I will lean over, and kiss your rosy, wrinkled cheek, and groan as I get up. ""Well,"" I'll say, ""time to get the car ready. Gotta go see the 'lils"", my affectionate name for the new grandbabies. And you'll hear me hum this song as I get the juice pouches, snacks, and coffee for us ready in our day bag.",1,1760393200.0,FindLoveWorldwide,1,1.0,False

I’ve been stuck in my life for a few months now, I felt like nothing was moving the way I wanted, everything was out of my control it seemed. I’ve tried a lot of stuff, magic and mundane, and nothing seemed to help, but then I was advised to work with Saint Martha. 
I felt called to her, so I carefully collected and gathered information from where I could. I have to tell you that she isn’t a saint you can joke around with, and so I was pretty scared to offend her in some way and made sure to research as much as I could. 
After that, I set up an altar with her picture on the floor. I didn’t have much, but I gave her what I had: flowers, poundcake, water, sweet coffee, Florida water. I also lit a candle and started my work on a Tuesday. I had had a very exhausting day and was feeling completely devastated, but after slowly starting to feel her presence and beginning my prayer, it kind of felt like a warm hug from a feminine energy, empowering and guiding me. 
I spoke to her, was very explicit with what I wanted, spent some time with her, watched the candle. Then I went to bed and felt so much better, warmer, stronger. 
A few days after, when nothing big had happened yet, I asked her for a sign to show me that she had heard me. I was at a pretty empty museum at that moment, and I kid you not, just minutes later a girl came by, who lifted up her sleeve and I saw a big snake tattoo on her arm. I don’t think it was a coincidence at all ;)
In the evening of that same day, I finally got an amazing opportunity and things seem to finally start playing out in my favor. Something happened that I’d been waiting for for months, and I have to say that it went in a quite funny and ironic way, but I got already a big part of what I wanted in the end. I gave her the offerings I had promised her as soon as I could (again the same things as before, but this time also flowers and snake-shaped jewelry). 
I am so incredibly grateful, and I wish to continue working with her and establish a stronger bond in the future. To whoever is seeking a strong, uplifting force in a seemingly desperate situation, when you feel you’re out of control, speak to her! She’s incredible. ",1,1760393064.0,witchcraft,1,1.0,False

I don't want to get up. not because I'm sad really, but because I just have this desire to stay in bed and imagine myself in it with you. 

I was on my side and desperately wanted to put my hand on your chest as you lie next to me. just a quiet, cozy, fall morning.

I'd want to press my body against yours, feel your hairy body against my smooth skin. I think about that sensation often. I think it would drive me crazy in the best possible way. My soft breasts on your hairy chest? yes please. 

I want to feel up and down your body with my soft, warm, small hand, gently fondling you at your most tender spots. 

I want to take care of you. I want... to give you morning head... slow and deliberate movements. Savoring you like a warm cup of coffee. Feeling you in my mouth and the back of my throat... 

I want to love you, darling. I don't think we'd intend to make love, but I think it would happen so quickly and naturally that it wouldn't even be a question. I still want to take care of you... to let you relax as you wake up... my poor, sleepy boy. 

I'd straddle you and guide you inside me... taking all of you in, then letting myself rest on your chest and be still. I'd kiss your chest, then your neck, then your lips... slowly, gently. 

We'd stare into each other's eyes as our hips started to move in unison. up and down, up and down. we'd get a little faster with each movement, but we'd always be tender with each other and in control... just enjoying our bodies being together at last... fitting together perfectly. 

I'd inevitably break and grind my hips into yours, clamping down on every inch of you with my warmth and my tight, wet pussy. 

You'd suddenly wrap one of your arms around my back and press me against your chest, quickening your pace as you finish inside me. I'd milk every drop out of you into me as I also come... multiple times. 

I'd want to cry out, but you'd be gripping the back of my head as you kissed me deeply, coaxing the moans out of me as though they were giving you life. 

well, you give me life, baby. 

it sounds so cliche, I know, but there is nothing cliche about this or about us. we may never get to experience this with each other, but it doesn't matter. we know how it would feel already. we know how perfect it would be. perfectly us. 

I feel lucky for just meeting you and knowing you and being in your life... even if it was just for a short period of time. it will always mean the world to me. as will you. 

I love you. 

always.

Isaac followed its pace, his coat brushing against the grimy bricks, his boots softly tapping on the wet stone. The notice from Admin echoed in his mind: *Observe. Do not engage.*  
  
At the end of the crooked lane stood the warehouse. Its windows glowed faintly, the air was sharp with oil and coal. When a hooded man appeared and signaled him inside, Isaac followed without hesitation. His curiosity always took him further than his caution would.  
  
Inside, the atmosphere buzzed with life. Crates were stacked high, silent yet imposing. He heard metal clinks and soft conversations. The scent of steel, tobacco, wax. He sensed something before he even saw it, the structure.



*Observe.*



The words floated around him, faint echoes that only he could see. *Anxiety. Resolve. Sleep deprivation, 42..43 hours.* His vision blurred as he focused, his forefinger and thumb pinching together. The workers glowed, red, *anger,* blue, *fear*, and threads of gold for their belief and fervour. The room shifted slightly as his eyes adjusted, from chaos to design.



Isaac glanced around, then controlled his breath until everything fell into lines and data.



Facts:

*Clean, unmarked, recently serviced firearms.*

*Maps, the tier borders, post and delivery routes.*

*Some kind of implied, unspoken chain of command.*

*The pungent coffee, bad stuff, not like the tea.*



At the far end, stood the man in charge. His face combined smoke and confidence, hidden under a hood. The aura of crimson and black, *command and uncertainty.. Fear masked as zeal.*  
  
“You came”, the man said, “You know why.”  
  
Isaac tilted his head, “Curiosity is its own direction.”  
  
The man smiled, both tired and proud. “Then let it lead us.”  
  
The words hung in the air, and Isaac read them. *Join. Cause. Rebellion.* A faint glimmer of truth and falseness.  
  
*Deconstruct.*



*Motive: Dissatisfaction.*

*Means: Arms, secrecy, plot.*

*Contradiction: “Freedom.” spoken as a command, fake.*

*Conclusion: Power, under a new order.*



A map of deception and lies, gestures, tones, and intent. The diagrams and thoughts of his overlapped with reality as he read and watched them speak, move, and their other oddities others may not notice.



They discussed equality, a better world, a fair one. The colors, the rationale, it disagreed. The red of devotion, the gray of fear. The purple for grief, another man’s aura was a feeble candle, he lost someone. Isaac couldn’t quite make out her name in the pauses of his whispers.



When he looked back at the main man, his color intensified. Red, into amber, *conviction boosted by the audience.* *He feeds on belief, like a farmer to cattle.*

  
“You want to rise against the tiers,” Isaac said softly, watching the shifting colors. “To destroy those who chain you.”  
  
“To free the world.” The man corrected. “Join us, help dismantle that tyranny.”



*Join Us.. sincerity, perhaps a position of planning, or power.*



“Tyranny is a clever parasite. It thrives in both host and rebel alike, like a cancer.” Isaac murmured.



Around the man, the gray intensified albeit slightly, Isaac noted the change.

*Pressure. Recruitment failure..32% He’s lying.*



*Conclude*



Isaac weighed his options carefully.  
  
*1. Idealists seeking equality.*

*2. Opportunists seeking power.*



*Evidence: uniformed discipline, rhetoric echoing their doctrine. An emotional synergy of resentment and chaos. Verdict: 2.*



Isaac nodded, quietly adding, “Information has its price and its place. Maybe I’ll see what you offer.”



The leader's smile returned, the kind men wore just before they fell into their own trap.



As Isaac turned to leave, his vision faded to his usual sight. Closed his eyes and replayed what he’d experienced. Every gesture, every pulse of color, every contradiction, the layout, the location.



*Observe: Complete.*

*Deconstruction: Complete*

*Conclusion: Concluded.*



He whispered the quiet mantras to himself, “See the facts, map the parts, hold the conclusion.” His fingers brushed against the cold rail of a lamppost, and he thought again, as the words glowed around him. *Truth. Duty. Choice.*



Tomorrow, he will report them to the relevant authority.



The office was sterile, stone white, with buzzing lamps and the scent of burnt ozone that lingered in the Magispirium labs. Isaac stood before the desk, hands clasped behind his back, that obedient stance masking his inner thoughts. The administrator, a sharp-featured man, listened in silence as Isaac shared everything: the warehouse, the weapons, the speech, and the lies.



When Isaac finished, the man exhaled once, long and measured. Then he said, “Good. You’ll go back.”  
  
The words hung heavy, just as sterile as the room itself. Isaac blinked, “You want me to return.”



“To act as one of them.” The administrator’s tone was flat, casual. “We need eyes inside. You’ve already made contact, correct? Keep it that way. Learn their hierarchy, their goals. Know who leads, who follows. When the time comes, you’ll give names, information.”



A pause, the hum of lamps deepened.



Isaac’s mind scanned through options, risks, possibilities. *Spy work. Logical. Efficient. Predictable.* 



He kept his expression composed, “If infiltration is the task,” he said quietly, “then I will perform it as I do everything else; precisely.”



The administrator’s lips curved, a cold facsimile of a smile, “Good. Report only to me.”

I am *furious*. I paid you fifty grand—*fifty thousand American dollars*—to handle that communist canary Big Bird. You were supposed to sneak into Sesame Street Studios, rip out his socialist feathers, feed him poisoned birdseed, and maybe even take a hatchet to that elephant-lizard freak Snuffleupagus. That’s what a *patriot* would’ve done.

But what did you do instead? You taught him the letters **F** and **U**. Cute. Then you told Bert and Ernie to twerk on TikTok, got into a tickle fight with Elmo, and traumatized Count von Count by introducing him to *Blade*. What the hell kind of operation are you running, Deadpool? Are you working for George Soros now?

I sent Sabretooth to finish the job, but you tied him up like a rodeo pig and had Prairie Dawn shove onions in his mouth while singing “C is for Chaos.” Is this your idea of a psychological operation?

I thought you were desperate for work, but apparently you’re too busy clowning around with your little superhero buddies. And don’t think I didn’t see you, Daredevil, Spider-Man, Black Cat, Boom Boom, and Domino giving me the finger through my window like it’s some kind of liberal flash mob.

You’re out there mooning me—*literally pressing your Canadian butt cheeks against my God-fearing window*—and then making gestures that look like you’re choking on something unspeakable. What’s that supposed to mean, huh? Is that Morse code for “screw you, Carl”?

You’re a disgrace to mercenaries everywhere. I hope Spider-Man does what the FBI’s too scared to and hauls your mutant ass in. I’m mailing this letter, and when I do, I’m including a copy of my manifesto titled *“Sesame Street: Deep State Propaganda for Toddlers.”* Maybe you’ll finally learn something.

Patriotically enraged,

**Dear Carl “The Angry Maga Man” Spitz,**

First off, Carl — *Carl* — I read your letter. Then I used it to clean mustard off my katana. Then I read it again, because the mustard improved it.

Let’s get something straight, my red-white-and-conspiracy friend: you paid me 50 grand to assassinate Big Bird. Big. Freakin’. Bird. The eight-foot feathered national treasure who taught America how to count and share. You wanted me to *murder* Sesame Street’s moral compass. That’s not a hit job, Carl — that’s a war crime. Even I have standards (well… flexible ones, but still).

Also, did you really write “feed him poison birdseed”? What am I, the world’s angriest pigeon?

Here’s what actually happened: I infiltrated Sesame Street disguised as a motivational speaker from Fox News. I taught Big Bird the letters “F” and “U” — which, coincidentally, also stand for *“Federal Undercover.”* (Spoiler: I’m not, but it freaked out Elmo, and that was worth every penny.)

Then Bert and Ernie *volunteered* to twerk, Elmo challenged me to a tickle fight (I lost, emotionally), and The Count is now in rehab because I taught him about blood banks. Sabretooth showed up halfway through with your “orders,” so I hogtied him because (A) he bit me, and (B) Prairie Dawn offered me five bucks and an onion to do it.

You’re welcome.

Also, stop calling it “Sesame Street Studios.” It’s literally just a street. You keep showing up there with binoculars, yelling about “deep state puppets,” and Spider-Man’s had to web you to a lamppost *three times*. At this point, the Muppets have a restraining order against you, Big Bird’s doing trauma yoga, and Oscar the Grouch has started a podcast about surviving you.

Next time you want a hit job done, call John Wick. He works for *dogs*. You can’t compete.

Now if you’ll excuse me, I’m heading back to Sesame Street to teach Cookie Monster about portion control and gun safety.

**Dear Deadpool,**

Oh my *God*, do you even *listen* when people pay you? I handed you **$60,000**—that’s six-0, not pocket change, not Monopoly money—to take care of **Alice**. Not bake her a casserole and hold her knitting circle. Not *become* her emotional support weirdo. **Kill Alice** was the job. Not “help her carry groceries,” not “taste-test her meatloaf,” and absolutely not “teach her how to make gluten-free cupcakes.”

What kind of **assassin** are you, Wade? A chef? A barista? Because all I’m getting from you is carbs. I wanted *blood*, bullets, trauma, tears — the whole cinematic meltdown package. Instead I get you slow-dancing in the Brady kitchen and spooning pudding into the face of the man who plays Reverend Camden like it’s Plaster of Paris. Pathetic.

You’re sleeping with her? You’re *watching me from my garden* like some depraved gnome, mouthing apologies to a cucumber like it’s performance art? What did you spend my money on, Wade? A loyalty card at the Brady Bake Shop? A lifetime supply of sympathy pies? I want my receipts. I want a refund. And while you’re at it, I want to speak to your manager — not some cryptic “mercenary guild” voicemail. I want a name, a badge, and somebody who can actually *finish a job.*

I paid for professional results. I expected professional results. I didn’t sign up for “Deadpool’s Feel-Good Hour” or “How to Win Friends and Befriend the Brady Family.” If you’re the kind of assassin who bakes banana bread for the target, then I should’ve hired Bullseye or Typhoid Mary — at least they understand the concept of follow-through.

Fix this, Wade. Give me my money back, or at the very least explain why I’m funding your daytime television binge. I’m furious, I’m entitled, and I will absolutely be the Karen who escalates this to corporate and posts a thousand one-star reviews about your “services.” Consider this your final warning before I call someone who knows what a hit job *looks like.*

**Dear Rose Mary “The Human Yelp Review” Titwether,**

First off — *wow.* I read your letter three times: once for comprehension, once for the emotional trauma, and once to make sure it wasn’t written by your hairdresser after a bad highlight job.

You hired me — **me**, Deadpool, the world’s sassiest sociopath — to *kill Alice from The Brady Bunch.*  
Alice.  
The woman who makes pot roast, hums show tunes, and has more emotional range than your entire Facebook group.

And for sixty grand? Lady, I’ve charged *more* to take out a Roomba.

Now, I’ll admit it: I *was* supposed to take the job seriously. But then Alice offered me meatloaf, told me my suit looked “handsome but impractical for baking,” and gave me a hug that healed childhood trauma I didn’t even know I had. Next thing I know, we’re bonding over dough, gossiping about Mike Brady’s suspiciously perfect hair, and comparing notes on cleaning products. She calls me “Wadey-poo.” You expect me to whack a woman who calls me *Wadey-poo?* That’s emotional terrorism.

Also, I *did* technically fulfill part of the contract:

* You wanted tears? She cried when I complimented her lasagna.
* You wanted bullets? I used one to open a can of peaches.
* You wanted trauma? Greg walked in on us singing “It’s a Sunshine Day.” He’ll never recover.

As for your little “cucumber” comment — yeah, that wasn’t what it looked like. I was doing *recon.* For… salad dressing. Don’t ask.

And you want a refund? Sure thing, Karen the Conqueror. Let me just log into my Mercenary Rewards Portal, click “Refund for Emotional Negligence,” and—oh, wait! Turns out I don’t give refunds for failed murder attempts that end in *banana bread and character development.*

Here’s what I can offer:

1. One (1) complimentary Deadpool Meatloaf Recipe (serves 6, plus regrets).
2. A signed photo of me and Alice mid-scone bake-off.
3. My eternal sympathy for your inability to handle cheerful women.

If you still want someone “efficient,” go hire Bullseye. He’ll throw a fork at her casserole and call it a day. Meanwhile, I’ll be over here, helping Alice start a catering business called **“Brady Buns & Bulletproof Bread.”**

Now if you’ll excuse me, Marcia just challenged me to a bake-off, and I’m not losing to someone with that much hair volume.

**Dear Deadpool,**

Listen up, Wade — this is Greg Doilly, and I don’t have time for fluff. My boy’s ten years old, and he’s headed toward full-on lavender-hippie catastrophe if I don’t do something now. I paid good money to men who get results, not arts-and-crafts instructors. You’re famous for being scary? Good. I want you to scare him *back* into being a real boy — the kind of boy who eats meat, gets mud on his face, and knows the difference between a tackling drill and a synchronized swim routine.

What this little flower has been up to:

1. Baking. (Like — cupcakes. In my house.)
2. Signed up for swim team. IN A FOOTBALL FAMILY.
3. Drove a car on the sidewalk like he was auditioning for a parade.
4. Wears Star Trek shirts *on* Star Wars day. What is he? Confused?
5. Beat his sister — sixteen years old — in the dance contest and made her cry. That’s embarrassing for the family.
6. My girlfriend of five years said she’ll leave when he turns 18. Don’t make me explain why that’s a problem.
7. Rehabilitates stray cats. (Boys don’t do that. Real boys don’t.)
8. Hangs with mutants and got a hug from “Marvel girl.” I don’t want mutant soft spots in my family tree.
9. Joined the flag team. The *flag team*. What is this, a pageant?

I want results. I don’t care which of your weird tactics you use so long as it’s legal, public, and humiliating enough that he snaps out of this nonsense. No broken bones, no police reports — I don’t want jail — but I want him red-faced, embarrassed, and rethinking his life choices. Make him face consequences. Make him earn his place back in the Doilly dynasty. Make him choose football over pastry piping. Make him cry — the kind of “I’ll never do that again” cry — then help him rebuild so he knows *why* he’s changing.

You’re the only one who’ll do it. Cowards and social workers won’t. Be creative: public “manhood” challenges, a fake TV expose that roasts his hobbies, a weekend of “boot camp” chores with no cookies, whatever it takes as long as it’s clean and effective. And if you’re the kind of assassin who develops a conscience, fine — mentor him after the fact. Teach him how to be useful.

I paid good money. Don’t waste it on knitting lessons and meatloaf. Get him straight or refund me. I want action, not feelings.

Greg Doilly  
(Real Man, Real Problems, Real Results)

  
**Dear Greg “Chest-Out, Fear-On” Doilly,**

Whoa there, Captain Testosterone. Slow your roll — your chin just popped a pec. I got your Victorian-era pamphlet about “real boys” and “mud on the face” and I almost spit my chimichanga laughing. You want me to scare a ten-year-old straight? Buddy, the only thing you should be scaring is yourself — from the mirror — because that pompadour of yours is a national security hazard.

Let me translate your checklist of crimes against boyhood into plain English: your kid bakes, swims, rescues cats, and has the audacity to wear a Trek shirt on Star Wars day. Terrorists have less alarming résumés. Meanwhile you’re out here crying over dance contests and throwing around “refunds” like you bought masculinity on layaway. Newsflash: masculinity isn’t refundable. Also, “hung out with mutants” is not a disqualifier for citizenship, it’s a future job referral.

Listen, macho-man—here’s what I *will* do (legally, theatrically, and with just the right amount of humiliation to sting your fragile pride):

1. **Operation Roast & Refill (of your ego)** I’ll host a fake “manliness intervention” where a phalanx of very fake, very loud tough-guys roast your son — and then turn on you, because let’s face it: you’re the one who needs the lesson. Tears? Maybe. Public embarrassment for Dad? Guaranteed.
2. **Boot Camp (for you, mostly)** Weekend obstacle course where you have to coach. I’ll plant cameras. If your speeches include the words “real boy” or “man up,” the footage becomes a viral montage titled *“Greg Doilly: How Not To Dad.”* Your social credit will plummet faster than your hairline.
3. **Mutant Mentorship Swap** We bring in a costumed “Marvel Girl” who gives the kid a pep talk — then swap her for the football coach so the kid hears “team” from someone who actually matters. You want football? Make football earn it. Not by threats — by competence. You teach competence. Not barking.
4. **Public Accountability (and a little karma)** Your son hosts the football team fundraiser only after he organizes the bake sale. He learns responsibility. You learn humility when the PTA email praising the bake sale posts a photo of you holding a tray of burnt muffins and crying quietly.

And the rules so you don’t squeal like a broken taillight: I do **not** remove my mask in front of minors. I do **not** threaten children. I will not bloody anyone for “failing” to be a stereotype. I will, however, make you look like an overcooked meatloaf in front of your neighbors, which — let’s be honest — you probably deserve.

Price: one (1) signed Deadpool action figure, a lifetime supply of chimichangas, or $5,000 and two public apologies written by you (“I was wrong and my son can like baking”). If you try to haggle me down to “respect and dignity” I’ll assume you want the deluxe package and invoice you accordingly.

Final note, Greg: if your primary plan for your son’s future is “scare him until he becomes someone I like,” maybe try the novel technique called *communication*. Or therapy. Or getting off the lawn and letting kids be humans. If you want theatrical embarrassment that ends with him being a better citizen (and you not being the villain in eight PTA newsletters), I’ll do it. If you want threats, violence, or to unmask me for the sake of your fragile man-card — don’t be surprised when I wave at the police while I walk away.

**Dear Wade (a.k.a. Deadpool),**

Are you *actually* kidding me? I paid you to handle **Miss Piggy** — *handle* — not to join her for brunch and a makeup tutorial while the rest of my life implodes. I’m not asking for “sparkly friendship;” I’m asking for results. I gave you money, time, and runway-level expectations, and you delivered *croissants and mimosas*. For real?

You were supposed to remove the obstacle. Instead you let her contour you into a whole new life, did a Taylor Swift–esque dance number on The Muppet Show, and then spent the evening *helping* her get her groove back with Kermit — like we’re filming a feel-good documentary. Newsflash: that was not the brief. I wanted to be the star. I wanted the spotlight. I wanted Kermit to be mine for red carpets and movie premieres — not to be set up on a rom-com reunion date by you and Miss Piggy over champagne.

Wade, this is basic business etiquette. You don’t get to accept an assignment, eat the appetizers, and then co-star in the victim’s glow-up montage. You are a professional. I expected professionalism. Not a makeover montage. Not a duet. Not a brunch date where I, Kim Kardashian, end up trending for the wrong reasons.

I want a full accounting of my money. I want receipts. I want to know where my payment went — to your chimichangas fund? To a spa day with Miss Piggy? I want either my money back or you fix this: make Kermit publicly regret his decision, arrange for an exclusive buzz about *me* that he can’t ignore, and do it without turning it into a musical number that goes viral for all the wrong reasons.

If you can’t deliver, I will escalate. Lawyers, PR teams, and social media campaigns are very real things, Wade. I do not play when my brand is on the line. I expected results. Instead I got a rom-com and a brunch photo. Refund me, or make me the headline for why Miss Piggy’s ex is the biggest star on the planet.

Don’t make me drag you — I’ll do it, and I’ll do it in 6-inch heels.

—  
**Kim Kardashian**  
(Extremely Dissatisfied, Slightly Hungover, and Very Much Expecting a Refund)

  
**Dear Kimberly “Queen of Contour and Chaos” Kardashian,**

First off — thank you for your handwritten ransom note written entirely in perfume and entitlement. I had to read it through sunglasses because the ink was literally glitter. I feel like I’ve been verbally bedazzled.

Now, let’s unpack this glamorous tantrum of yours, shall we?

You *hired me* — Deadpool — to “take care” of Miss Piggy.  
Your words. Not mine.  
And yes, I *did* take care of her. We had mimosas, we exfoliated, and I learned that contouring is basically war paint for influencers. You wanted her *gone* — but the thing is, Piggy’s tougher than half the X-Men and twice as flexible as your Instagram filters. I tried to intimidate her once, and she roundhouse-kicked me into a pile of croissants. Respect.

So, naturally, I pivoted. I adapted. I evolved. I learned the sacred art of the **sassy snort** and the **pouty pose**. And before you know it — bam! — we’re trending. #Pigpool. Millions of views. I became an *iconic* feminist symbol of glittery rage and emotional violence. Meanwhile, you’re mad because I didn’t commit puppet homicide. Relax, Kim. I gave you *relevance.* You’re welcome.

Also — you said “help me seduce Kermit.”  
Kim. Sweetie. Honey. That’s not seduction; that’s a felony in several states and a career-ending headline in *Variety.*  
Kermit’s a frog. Like, literally. Cold-blooded. Webbed feet. Think about the logistics for two seconds.

Instead, I helped them rekindle their thing — because nothing boosts your brand like being the third wheel in a frog-pig power couple reconciliation. You should be thanking me. I turned your love triangle into an Emmy-bait documentary.

Now, about that refund:  
I spent your payment on:

1. **A brunch tab** at Le Croissant Massacre (Miss Piggy eats like a Viking).
2. **A custom Gucci ammo belt** — because even mercenaries deserve couture.
3. **A self-care retreat** to emotionally recover from hearing “Hiya!” screamed in my ear forty-seven times.

So, no refund. But! I can offer a trade: I’ll put you in touch with Fozzie Bear. He’s single, emotionally available, and desperate for a storyline. Win-win.

Or… I can choreograph your comeback. Think about it:  
**Kim Kardashian x Deadpool x Miss Piggy: The Musical — “Keeping Up with the Kermits.”**  
There’s tulle, there’s trauma, there’s tasteful violence. Broadway won’t be ready.

Anyway, I gotta run — I’m filming a skincare collab with Animal. It’s just called *RAAAAAAH!!!*  
Try not to sue me before the weekend.

Hugs, hand grenades, and highlighter,  
**Deadpool 💋**  
(Professional Mercenary / Accidental Beauty Influencer / Probably Blacklisted by Disney)

P.S. Tell your lawyers to relax — Piggy signed an NDA. In lipstick. On my face.

**Dear Deadpool (you melodramatic maniac in red leather),**

*Moi* has read your ridiculous letter — twice — and let me be perfectly clear, snookums: **you are canceled.**

First, how *dare* you imply that I am “tougher than half the X-Men.” I am tougher than *all* of them. Especially Wolverine. Hairy little man couldn’t even handle a facial peel.

Second, brunch was supposed to be a secret! You promised *no photos,* and then there you are — tagging me on Instagram like a fangirl with a death wish: *#PigpoolVibes #OinkAndDestroy.* Do you have any idea how many reporters called me after that? Page Six thinks I’m dating you. *Moi!* Dating a man who smells like gunpowder and Axe Body Spray!

Now let’s talk about that little amphibian drama. I *told* you I was over Kermie. I was *fine*. Perfectly fine! But then you and your idiotic chimichanga breath decided to “help me reconnect.” Suddenly I’m crying in a musical number, Kermit’s croaking love ballads, and I’m trending on X under “#FrogItUp.” You know what that does to a lady’s image?! I am a star, not a meme!

And another thing, you scarlet-suited scandal with abs — you drank *my* mimosa. The one with the little gold flake garnish that I specifically said was for my *brand photo.* You owe me one bottle of Veuve Clicquot, one apology bouquet (roses, not grenades), and one written statement acknowledging that *Moi* carried that Taylor Swift number with more grace and rhythm than you could ever dream of.

Let me make this perfectly clear, puddin’ pants: if you ever post another “GRWM with Piggy” video without my written consent, I will introduce your katanas to places they were never meant to go. And *then* I’ll sue. In heels.

You can keep your croissants, your couture ammo belt, and your idiotic sense of humor. Just stay out of my spotlight, darling — it’s bright enough without you reflecting your ego all over it.

Now if you’ll excuse me, I have a photo shoot, three endorsement deals, and a frog to ignore.

With love (and legal threats),  
**Miss Piggy 💋**  
Global Icon • Diva Supreme • Star of Stage, Screen, and Emotional Damage

P.S. Tell Kim to stop texting me. I don’t do reality TV — *Moi* creates it.

**Dear Deadpool,**

You absolute *lunatic in red spandex with ADHD and a microphone,*

When I said “come promote your brand on *The View*,” I did *not* mean, “stage a multiverse orgy of chaos on live television.”

Do you realize what you did to my *career*, Wade? I had a nice, stable job. I had a decent parking space. I had *health insurance.* And then *you* happened.

Let’s start from the top — and believe me, I have a list:

1. You were supposed to promote your **Chosen Condoms** campaign. Instead, you held up a *used* one like it was a balloon animal and called it “a symbol of safe explosions.” I’m still scrubbing hand sanitizer out of the audience seats.
2. You hijacked the intro. Whoopi was supposed to say, “Welcome to *The View*,” but instead you slid across the table like Tom Cruise in *Risky Business* screaming, “Welcome to *The Merc with a Mouth Hour!*”
3. Typhoid Mary nearly *poisoned Whoopi Goldberg*. WHOOPI! The woman has survived *Sister Act 2* and you almost took her out with whatever disease cloud your ex radiates.
4. You brought out **Dazzler** unannounced. Then you — a grown man — strutted out in *9-inch heels,* backup dancing like a Dollar Store Beyoncé while yelling “This one’s for the mutants, baby!” Taylor Swift was watching backstage *mortified,* and honestly, that’s saying something.
5. Gordon Ramsay was scheduled to cook a *five-star dish*. Instead, the *Swedish Chef* comes out yelling “Bork bork bork!” while you tongue him on live television and claim it’s “speaking in tongues for charity.” The FCC called. Twice.
6. The puppet show with Joy Behar… Wade, I’m not even writing that one down. HR made me sign an NDA.
7. And then, just when I thought the nightmare was over, you reenacted *Titanic* with Whoopi as Rose, Joy as Jack, and you as the iceberg. There were tears. Not emotional ones — real ones. From the pain of watching it.

Now, I’m sitting here writing this letter while The View’s lawyers debate whether to sue you, or me, or *God himself* for letting this happen. You’ve single-handedly torpedoed my reputation, my career, and possibly the last functioning neuron in Joy Behar’s head.

If you had any decency left in your overcooked Canadian brain, you’d send me a glowing reference letter. No — scratch that — a glowing *video testimonial* where you look right into the camera and say:

>

I expect it in my inbox by Friday. Or I swear I’ll have Barbara Walters haunt you.

With all the rage of a caffeine-deprived intern,  
**Linda Hoda Prune**  
*Associate Producer, Formerly of The View (and now possibly of Hell)*

P.S. If Weasel writes my résumé, tell him to remove the part where I “wrangled Deadpool during a live broadcast.” I’m trying to get hired, not exorcised.

**Dear Linda “Hoda ‘This-Isn’t-What-I-Signed-Up-For’ Prune,**

First off—deep breath—**you’re welcome.**

I just gave *The View* the highest ratings it’s had since Rosie O’Donnell threw a chair at Elisabeth Hasselbeck. You’re not fired, Linda. You’re *legendary.*

Now, I read your letter (in an accent somewhere between Fran Drescher and a car alarm), and I gotta say—WOW. Someone needs a spa day, a hug, and a vat of tequila. Maybe not in that order.

Let’s unpack your trauma, shall we?

**1. The Condoms:**  
I was promoting *Chosen Condoms* the only way Deadpool knows how—by giving a *demonstration.* You try explaining “latex elasticity” to daytime TV viewers without props. I call that *educational television*, sweetheart. PBS could never.

**2. Typhoid Mary vs. Whoopi:**  
Okay, in my defense, Whoopi *challenged* Mary to a debate on “The Ethics of Mutant Monogamy.” I didn’t *plan* the near-death experience. I just handed out popcorn.

**3. Dazzler’s Surprise Performance:**  
Look, Taylor Swift’s people said she was running late. I needed a musical act. Dazzler owed me a favor from that one time I stopped Juggernaut from crashing her Vegas gig (long story, short shorts). The 9-inch heels? Not my fault. They were Joy Behar’s. She dared me.

**4. Gordon Ramsay’s Replacement:**  
Yeah, about that… the Swedish Chef *threatened* me. He came into the green room waving a spatula and muttering something like “Bork or die.” I panicked, made out with him, and blacked out halfway through the risotto. Happens.

**5. The Puppet Show:**  
Art. Pure art. It was called “Hands Up America,” a political allegory about media manipulation, government overreach, and Joy Behar’s arm strength. It was *bold.* You’re just too corporate to get it.

**6. Titanic Reenactment:**  
Linda. Sweet Linda. You haven’t *lived* until you’ve watched Whoopi whisper “I’ll never let go, Jack” to Joy Behar while I, Deadpool, sink dramatically into a kiddie pool full of ice cubes and vodka cranberries. If that’s not cinema, I don’t know what is.

Now, about your “career being over.” Pfft. No one remembers *The View* scandals. Remember when Meghan McCain accidentally set the teleprompter on fire? Exactly.

And let’s be real—you’ll get hired again in five minutes. People love a good disaster wrangler. Just put “experienced in handling chaotic Marvel entities on live television” on your résumé. HR people eat that up.

As for your request for a reference letter, I’m already working on it. So far, it starts like this:

>

You’re welcome.

Anyway, gotta run. The ladies of *The Talk* just called. Apparently, they’re feeling brave.

With love, lust, and light-up nipple tassels,  
**Deadpool 💋**  
Professional Ratings Booster, Amateur Talk Show Destroyer

P.S. Tell Whoopi I still have her cardigan. It smells like wisdom and THC gummies.

  
**Dear Deadpool,**

Lord have mercy, Wade…

Now, I’ve seen some things in my day. I’ve watched Patrick Swayze take pottery lessons, I’ve sat through *Ghosts of Girlfriends Past,* and I once shared a dressing room with Barbara Walters during a power outage.  
But *you*, honey? You are a new kind of *chaotic stupid.*

Let’s talk about what happened on *The View,* shall we?

You rolled in looking like a bottle of ketchup that went through a car wash, yelling, “Good morning, ladies!” like you were about to perform at Chippendales for senior citizens.  
Before I could even sip my coffee, Typhoid Mary was *breathing toxins* in my direction, Joy was screaming something about “method acting,” and Sunny Hostin fainted in the green room because the Swedish Chef tried to season her latte.

Then, somehow, there was a musical number. Not just a *musical number* — a whole Broadway revival starring you, Dazzler, and what I can only assume were several unpaid interns in fishnets.  
And Wade, baby… when I said “Let’s talk about gun reform,” I did not mean *choreograph it.*

Now, you know I love the arts. You know I’ve hosted the Oscars, I’ve played a singing nun, I’ve worked with Patrick Stewart. But even I was not ready for your little “interpretive lap dance about freedom.”  
You jumped on the table, shouted “Viva la View!” and gyrated so hard the teleprompter started praying.

Then there was the *Titanic* reenactment. You told Joy, “Draw me like one of your liberal ladies,” and I swear to Oprah, I blacked out somewhere between your third pelvic thrust and the ice cube tray you called an ocean.

Do you realize what you’ve done? You’ve traumatized an entire studio audience. You’ve aged me six years. You made Whoopi Goldberg consider early retirement *again.*

But… I’ll say this. You made people *talk.*  
Our ratings went up 400%. The internet is obsessed. I haven’t seen that many people tune in since the time Barbara asked Tom Cruise about Scientology and we all started looking for exits.

So here’s the deal, Wade.

You stay off my show. You stay away from my cardigan. And if I *ever* see you near our set again, I’m calling Professor Xavier to come fetch your mentally unstable behind before I baptize you in peppermint oil and sarcasm.

Sincerely (and reluctantly),  
**Whoopi Goldberg**  
Eternal Tired Auntie of Daytime TV

P.S. If you *ever* make me duet with Dazzler again, I’m summoning Oprah and we’re both throwing hands.

**Dear Deadpool,**

You absolute lunatic in red leather —

First of all, thanks a lot, you deranged chimichanga with abs. Do you have *any* idea what it’s like to explain to your husband why the Internet thinks you and a Marvel psychopath are the new Jack and Rose? I can’t even look at an iceberg without feeling violated.

Let’s rewind.

You waltzed onto *The View* like a stripper at a PTA meeting, waving a sword and yelling, “Let’s make daytime TV dangerous again!” And then — THEN — you made me your *co-star* in your so-called “artistic reimagining” of *Titanic.*  
I haven’t been that close to a man in years, Wade. And when I said “I’ll never let go,” I meant *of my career*, not your oily leather thighs.

Then you dragged poor Whoopi into it. She’s still walking around backstage muttering “why me” like a haunted Roomba. Sunny’s therapist just bought a boat. The Swedish Chef has a restraining order against you in *three languages.*

And while we’re on the subject — did you really think a puppet show with me was a good idea? “The Joy and the Fury”? Honey, I’ve hosted political debates that were *less disturbing.* I had a hand up my back and still came off more professional than you.

But here’s the worst part — I liked it.

There, I said it. I laughed. I danced. I got to scream “draw me like one of your mutant girls” on live TV. You brought chaos, disaster, and probably several FCC violations — but you also brought something daytime television hasn’t seen in years: *fun.*

So, congratulations, Deadpool. You ruined my reputation, nearly got us all canceled, and somehow still made me trend on X for six hours under the hashtag **#JoyBeharIsUnhingedAndILoveIt.**

You’re an idiot, a menace, and possibly the most entertaining thing to happen to *The View* since Meghan McCain quit.

If you ever want to do a spin-off — something completely inappropriate, explosive, and guaranteed to make Disney’s lawyers cry — call me. We’ll call it:

>

It’s part talk show, part therapy session, part public apology tour. You bring the explosives, I’ll bring the sarcasm.

Until then, stay out of my dressing room, stop hitting on my makeup artist, and for the love of all that’s holy, stop sending me photos of you in fishnets with the caption “Still unsinkable, baby.”

With equal parts fury and admiration,  
**Joy Behar**  
Co-Host of *The View* (Survivor of Deadpool’s Daytime Takeover)

P.S. The next time you come on the show, bring Oprah. I want to watch her smack you with a Chanel Bible.

**Deaw Deadpoow,**

You… you wotten, wed-weathed *wabbit wover!*

I am *wivving* with wage and heawtbweak. I am angwy. I am howting. I am this cwose 🤏 to cwyin’ into my own twap. I fought we had a bond, you and me. Two men of violence. Two men of action. Two men with… emotional instabiwity and gun wicenses.

Me and my best fwiend Yosemite Sam, we pooled ouw pennies, ouw twust funds, ouw wifew savings, and paid you *one hundwed gwand*—*one hundwed gwand*—to *off* that damned Bugs Bunny once and fow aww.  
We said, “Wet’s end ouw caweews with a bang. Wet’s be wegends. Wet’s make it wabbit season… *fowevew!*”

And what did we get in wetuwn, Wade?

We got *cwowned.*  
We got *diswespected.*  
We got… *cat wittuh box!*

Wet me wist youw cwimes, you chawismatic disastew:

1. You did the *Macawena* with Bugs Bunny. On TikTok. To a mashup with Doja Cat.
2. You sang a show tune with Daffy Duck and then had a scweaming match about “duck season, wabbit season” in a back awwey behind an Applebee’s.
3. You staged an *intuhvention* fow Tasmanian Devil about his cocaine habit! He’s *tewwifying* enough without detox!
4. You tuwned Wile E. Coyote and Foghown Leghown into *wovers*. WOVERS, Deadpoow! How am I supposed to *expwain* that to the syndication depawtment?!
5. You encouwaged Tweety to dwop a piano, a caw, Woseanne Baww, *and a New Yawk City bus* on top of me!
6. You catfished me, Deadpoow. You catfished me! You met me in Gwiwiff Park dwessed as *Kathy Gwiffin* whiwe Kathy Gwiffin *fiwmed it!* You have no soul, you sociopathic showpony.
7. You didn’t even give me one of youw cowowing book autobiogwaphies. You awe dead to me.
8. You had Copycat hang me upside down ovew a *shawk tank.* I fought she liked me, Wade. I fought we had a moment. We wistened to Taylow Swift togethew. I made biscwits! *BISCWITS!*

And instead of finishing youw contwact, instead of deawing with that diwty, cawewess, cawwot-eating wabbit—  
you went on *The View.*  
You danced. You sang. You bwought the Swedish Chef. YOU MADE OUT WITH HIM.

You awe an embarrassment to assassins evewywhere.

And to make things wowse, you went awound tewwing evewyone that me and Sam awe *bisexuaw.* We wewe gonna *come out on ouw tewms,* Wade! It was gonna be a *Vanity Faiw spwead!* Now we gotta hide in a safehouse in Buwbank while Bugs tweets “Love is Love ❤️ #WabbitPwide.”

Sam’s been cwyyin’ into his hat all day. His moustache is soaked. He won’t even woad his six-shootews. He keeps saying, “He pwooomised, Elmer! He pwooomised!”

So wet me make this cwear, Wade Winston Wilson:

If I don’t get my *wefund,* it’s gonna be *Me’cwenawy Season.*  
I got two shotguns, a bwoken hawt, and a wicense to cwinge.

Do the wight thing, Deadpoow.  
Make it wight befowe I make it *pewsonal.*

**Ewmer Fudd 🐰🔫**  
Wannabe Legend, Wabbit Victim, Wejected Hewo

P.S. If you see Bugs Bunny befowe I do, teww him I said… *“What’s up, doc?”*  
(But with *menace,* Wade. With *menace.*)

**Dear Ewmer “Twigger Discipwine” Fudd,**

First of all—  
I just want to say how absolutely *adorable* your letter was. I read it out loud in your voice while sitting in a bubble bath, and I nearly drowned from laughter. Ten out of ten, would hire you to narrate my next mental breakdown.

Now let’s unpack this Looney trauma, shall we?

You hired *me*, Deadpool — a man whose idea of “quiet time” is juggling grenades — to assassinate *Bugs Bunny.*  
That’s like hiring the Hamburglar to do your taxes. You should’ve known this was going to end with glitter, chaos, and at least one emotional dance number.

Let’s address your *concerns,* Doc:

**1. The Macarena Incident**  
Look, Bugs has moves. The bunny’s got rhythm, charisma, and a shocking amount of hip flexibility. We bonded. Things got… rhythmic. Don’t be jealous — be inspired.

**2. Daffy Duck and the Alley Argument**  
I didn’t *want* to scream “Duck Season!” for 45 minutes straight, but the guy challenged me to a debate and I don’t back down from unhinged poultry. Also, he bit me. Twice.

**3. Tasmanian Devil’s Intervention**  
That wasn’t sabotage, that was *outreach.* You can’t keep spinning in circles of chaos forever, Elmer — not without therapy, or Dramamine.

**4. Wile E. Coyote and Foghorn Leghorn’s Relationship**  
Love is love, baby. Don’t act like you didn’t see the tension. That rooster’s been cluckin’ about “a big, strong predator” for decades. I just helped them find happiness… and matching monogrammed collars.

**5. Tweety’s Piano Drop**  
Okay, yeah, I might’ve said “do something bold.” I didn’t know he’d go full Looney *Final Destination.* You’re fine, though! Walk it off, ya little cartoon gun goblin.

**6. The Catfishing Thing**  
Kathy Griffin *made me do it!* She said it was for a charity livestream called “Comedians Without Boundaries.” Also, your Tinder bio says “I like hunting and emotional honesty,” which—sir—confused me.

**7. The Copycat Situation**  
Buddy… Copycat doesn’t like *anyone.* She only flirts with people she plans to stab. That wasn’t romance, that was cardio.

**8. The View**  
Oh, you *saw* that? Great! I call that segment “From Wabbit Season to Sweeps Season.” Highest ratings since Rosie and Trump. You’re welcome.

Now let’s get serious for a sec, Fuddsy.

You and Sam? Legends. Gay icons. Redneck Renaissance heroes.  
But maybe — just *maybe* — instead of wasting cash hiring mercenaries to kill cartoon rabbits, you should use that hundred grand for therapy, therapy, and a big ol’ rainbow float at the next Toon Pride Parade.

I didn’t fail you, Elmer. I *freed* you. You’re welcome.

And because I’m a giver — attached is a coupon for:

Go ahead, relax. Let Bugs live rent-free in your heart instead of your scope.

Sincerely and sarcastically yours,  
**Deadpool 🖤🔫🐰**  
(Mercenary, Mediator, Matchmaker, Menace)

P.S. Tell Sam to stop crying — he’s trending on X under *#RootinTootinAndEmotionallyConfusin.* You’re both welcome.

  
**DEADPOOL, YA NO-GOOD, SPAGHETTI-SUITED, CHIMICHANGA-SNIFFIN’ VARMINT!**

This here’s **Yosemite Sam,** writin’ you from a dive saloon in Bakersfield where I been drownin’ my sorrows in sarsaparilla and poor decisions!

Me ’n Elmer paid you ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND AMERICAN DOLLARS to bag that floppy-eared menace, *Bugs Bunny!* You was supposed to end the wabbit wampage, not start a *musical revue!*

Instead, what’d we get?

1. You did the **Macarena** with him. MACA-FREAKIN-RENA!
2. You turned my shoot-’em-up ambush into a TED Talk about “anger management for animated outlaws.”
3. You told Bugs he should “lean into his mischievous feminine side.”
4. Then you sold matching **crop tops** that said “Wabbit Lives Matter.”
5. You hugged the Tasmanian Devil so hard he’s now gluten-free.
6. You left me hog-tied to a rocket signed “With Love, Daffy.”

Now every time I try to pull a gun, a little voice in my head goes, *“What would Deadpool do?”* and next thing I know I’m cryin’ into a therapy goat!

You even told TMZ that me ’n Elmer was “the Brokeback Mountaineers of Looney Tunes.” That ain’t *helpin’* brand image, son—that’s startin’ fanfiction!

I been through a lot, Pool. Fell off cliffs, got blown up by my own TNT, got canceled in 2006. But I ain’t never been so humiliated as watchin’ you slow-dance with that wabbit while singin’ “I Will Survive.”

You owe me money, dignity, and possibly a new mustache.

I swear by my spurs and my trigger finger, if you don’t fix this, I’m comin’ for you.  
And I ain’t bringin’ flowers.  
I’m bringin’ **justice, dynamite, and disappointment!**

Signed,  
**Yosemite Sam**  
(*The Original Short King of Carnage*)

P.S. Speedy Gonzales keeps callin’ me “Lil Yosey.” If you told him that, I’m sendin’ my boot up your red-suited behind.

Again just want something I can daily and not worry about. Currently use my [Cartier Santos] as more of my “fancy” watch on weekends/nights out on the town. I’m considering a [Rolex Explorer I] or [Datejust] to meet the needs stated above. Budget is 7-10k. ",1,1760392799.0,Watches,1,1.0,False

Turns out the fix was hiding in plain sight (right next to my empty coffee mug).

**Repo:** [https://github.com/rdumasia303/tensorrt-llm\_with\_open-webui](https://github.com/rdumasia303/tensorrt-llm_with_open-webui)

# Why you might care

* **5090 / Blackwell friendly:** Built to run cleanly on RTX 5090 and friends.
* **FP4 works:** Runs FP4 models that can be grumpy in other stacks.
* **OpenAI-compatible:** Drop-in for Open WebUI or anything that speaks `/v1`.
* **One compose file:** Nothing too magical required.

I haven't got multimodal models working, but

Works, and it's fast - so that's me done for tonight.

The 50k bonus points offer was what caught my attention, but what made me pull the trigger was the 4x on mobile wallet payments. Since most of my daily spending runs through Google Pay anyway, it just made sense to see how far the rewards could go. In just a few days, I’ve been using it for everything gas, groceries, and even random coffee runs and the points are stacking up faster than expected. It feels a lot more rewarding compared to the flat rate cashback cards I used before. The fact that it also includes lounge access through Priority Pass (without charging an insane annual fee) makes it even more appealing, especially for someone who travels only a few times a year So far, the experience feels smooth and easy to manage. I like how U.S. Bank’s app tracks points clearly, and it syncs seamlessly with mobile wallets. Still, I’m curious how this card performs long term, especially for travelers who aren’t on planes every week. Anyone here been using it for a while? Trying to figure out if it’s worth keeping for the travel perks or if it’s smarter to downgrade later once the bonus value fades.",1,1760392543.0,credit_cards,0,1.0,False

I've personally stopped going to Dunkin Doughnuts, drinking iced caramel coffee, and both Sunny Delight and Velveeta were gross before I found out about Lush. We don't have Wegman's where I live (west of the Mississippi River). I don't buy or use Elf except for their tools (brushes, tweezers, clippers, etc.) if they're cheap, and that's more to support Katherine Legge as she's sponsored by them in NASCAR. Sephora's way too expensive for me as it is, but I won't be giving them money. I also vow to not go to TopGolf or many of the other places Lush has partnered with, including shopping on Temu. 

The only thing I do still willingly purchase that I know Lush likes to do is Build-a-Bear, but even those I've cut back on in part to her, but also due to space and costs and mostly stick to the licensed stuff now (Nightmare Before Christmas, Pokemon, etc.). 

Anyone else have any brands or stores they've turned on because Lush supports them?",2,1760392526.0,doughertydozenexposed,2,1.0,False

I forget about proper punctuation marks when I'm using my voice so I use AI to fix that problem. Other than that all the information is 100% my own words.

 A Bit About Me

I’m the kind of person who can be both chill and playful depending on the day. Equal parts introvert and extrovert, I’m just as happy curled up on the couch watching TV or reading as I am laughing with someone until we can’t breathe. My ideal day might include gaming together, building Magic: The Gathering decks, making wild D&D characters, diving into a board game, or just laying around in each other’s arms goofing off and talking about everything and nothing.

I prefer bookstores and coffee shops over clubs and bars, and while I do deal with a few health issues — including being fully blind — I don’t take life too seriously. I crack jokes, tease playfully, and sometimes act like a total goofball — sarcasm, dark humor, and sticking my tongue out at you are all fair game. I’ve got ADHD, so I might come with a few bonus side quests and unskippable monologues, but it just means life with me is never boring.

I’m also proudly hypersexual — touch, intimacy, and desire are important parts of how I connect with someone, and I don’t shy away from exploring and celebrating that side of myself. That said, I’m still a romantic at heart — when I care about someone, I give deeply.

I'm a father to amazing kids — they are the center of my universe, and family will always come first. I’m kind, loyal, and the type who’d give the shirt off my back for someone I care about. I’m a carnivorous bookworm with a serious love for learning; I know a little bit about a lot and will nerd out with you about anything from obscure history to fantasy lore. Tabletop gaming is a lifelong love of mine — I even run D&D professionally at a yearly convention, and casually for friends the rest of the year.

 Relationship Style & Connection

I’ve been both monogamous and polyamorous in the past, and I’m open to either depending on the connection. What matters most to me is honesty, mutual effort, and emotional depth — whether that’s with one person or more. I’m big on affection in all its forms: physical, emotional, verbal. Holding hands, cuddling, spontaneous kisses, teasing praise — if I care about you, you’ll never have to guess.

I don’t mind if you have kids or not — I’m a dad myself, and I understand how much love and time that role involves. What I really value is mutual affection and thoughtful communication. I want you to feel safe telling me anything — even the hard stuff — especially if it’s something I need to hear.

When we’re not together, I enjoy regular check-ins: “how’s your day going?” texts, little voice messages, silly photos, phone calls before bed. We don’t have to talk every hour, but knowing we’re thinking about each other through the day makes a big difference to me.


---

🌶️ Sexual & Kink Dynamics

I’m a soft dominant by nature — someone who leads with care, clarity, and a good sense of timing — but I’m adaptable depending on what my partner needs. I don’t confine dominance to just the bedroom; it’s something that shows up in gentle ways throughout the day when it’s wanted and welcomed. Consent and mutual comfort are everything to me — the foundation for anything intense or playful.

I’m kinky, very much so, and I’m slowly reentering the BDSM lifestyle after some time away. I don’t have a preference when it comes to submissives or switches — what matters more is connection, honesty, and that spark of chemistry. I’m also hypersexual, and I’d love to find someone who enjoys keeping up — whether that’s with dirty texts, sexy photos, spontaneous flirtation, or heat in unexpected places.

I enjoy talking openly about sex and kink, so if you have questions or curiosities, I welcome all of it. Exploration is fun, but connection always comes first.


---

🧚 On the Physical Side

I’m 5'10"", 158 lbs, and currently focused on building muscle and staying strong. I’ve got dirty blonde hair, blue eyes, and tattoos that mean a lot to me — especially the ones on my arms. If you’re into Studio Ghibli or gaming, you’ll definitely recognize a few: the Assassin’s Creed symbol, No-Face and the soot sprite from Spirited Away, one of the tiny Totoro from My Neighbor Totoro, Calcifer from Howl’s Moving Castle, and the Kodamas from Princess Mononoke. My body’s a bit of a love letter to the stories that shaped me.


---

✨ What I’m Looking For

I’m looking for a partner who’s just as much fun outside the bedroom as they are inside it — someone affectionate, a little outrageous, and proudly pervy in all the right ways. I’d love to find someone who enjoys spending lots of time together, whether that’s cuddling on the couch, gaming side by side, or just cooking dinner and dancing around the kitchen like nobody’s watching. At the same time, I value someone who understands the importance of space and solo time — balance makes it all better.

If you’re confident, clever, goofy, and emotionally present — we’ll probably click. I love someone who isn’t afraid to laugh in public, act silly with me, or send a quick “thinking of you” text in the middle of the day. I’m especially drawn to women who are on the shorter side (under 5'5""), but that’s more of a sweet spot than a requirement.

I live in Jacksonville, Florida and would love to find someone local — but I’m absolutely open to long-distance if the vibe feels right and the connection’s real.

Skip the boring “hi.” If you’re affectionate, a little ridiculous, and down to build something real (and really fun), send me a message that actually shows me who you are.

Hi! My name is Stephanie! I’m 35 and live in Western Canada (Specifically - Alberta). I am hoping to make a new online friend that is fun/funny, genuine, willing/able to put effort into conversations(I will do the same!). I would prefer to chat with people around my age, or older(please no one under 30!), that is able to text/write full words lol - a bit of slang is cool, but I can’t do the whole “u” instead of “you” thing etc all the time! 

Some things I enjoy that could give an idea if we have interests in common, or just to start a conversation: music! My favorite band is blink 182, and has been since I was 14 - also pretty into Alkaline Trio, mgk, Taylor Swift etc etc. I enjoy shopping and getting my nails done - I see a very talented nail tech that makes all my nail art dreams a reality. I love coffee, movie and tv shows, with a preference for anything horror. I love to exercise daily, and love to go for long walks. Other things too, but I don’t want to give everything away here, or make this intro too long. 

If this interests you and you’d like to have a chat, please send me a message with a quick introduction! 

Here’s an icebreaker to help start a conversation / show me if you actually read through the post lol: what is something you are looking forward to / excited about?",0,1760392396.0,R4R30Plus,2,0.5,False

Express/impress pros:
- smaller size machine
- automatic measuring of the perfect amount of grinded coffee that comes out (with that fancy light and smiley face)
- easier cleaning and maintenance
- 54mm portafilter
- more grinding options/levels
- can remove the grinding cup



Opera pros:
- more drinks
- better milk pipe
- water sensor



Now, I’d make 2-4 drinks a day, mostly espresso with steamed milk. I’m kind of leaning towards the express/impress, but I’m not sure at all and would appreciate some advice. Also, I’m a newbie, so being able to control and fine-tune every aspect probably won’t matter a lot.",1,1760392375.0,espresso,0,1.0,False

1o5xgkq,https://www.reddit.com/r/CreepCast_Submissions/comments/1o5xgkq/there_are_bugs_everywhere_part_two/,There are bugs everywhere. part two,"Now, I wouldn't say I'm afraid of bugs. They just gross me out and I avoid trying to have to deal with them.  I leave them alone if they leave me alone. I'm not the type of person to start screaming when I see one, or run across the country to avoid a spider, but place one in my hand I'll definitely drop it in disgust. If one is crawling on me I'll slap it off. 

So obviously I'm not a fan of them like my older sister is. She's the type to save them. She sees a spider in her home she'll take it outside, sees one on the sidewalk she'll take it to the grass to avoid it from getting stepped on. If she sees a bug with a cool pattern on it, or one she doesn't see often, she'll take a photo of it.  Which is all to say that she's weird and I have forbidden her from sending me that crap, yet she still sends it to me. 

This is why I asked her to come over and help me with this infestation of silverfish. I told my landlord about it on Monday, and he told me he'd look into it to see what he can do about it.  That was last week, and he still hasn't done anything to help me. He hasn't picked up any of my calls nor responded to any of my emails. So plan b, get my sister to help me. 

She came over Saturday, on her day off. She seemed tired and already annoyed with me. I was waiting in the living room anxious to get this problem done and over with. My leg was bouncing up and down as I sat on the edge of the couch. I heard the buzzer signaling that she was at the front of the apartment building so I buzzed her in and got up to start waiting by the door for her. When I heard the first knock on my door I opened it. 

She was standing there tired from a week of late night shifts with a grocery bag in her hand, probably leftover food from our mom. I stepped aside letting her in. I closed the door behind her, following her to the kitchen nearby. I watched her from my kitchen island, the one that separated the kitchen from the living room. She started to put away the leftovers and extra groceries. I waited for her to say something to me and when she didn't I decided to start 

“Cassie, please,..” 

“I know Jess, just give me a second,” she interrupted. I watched her finish putting those groceries away and she finally looked at me “now tell me, where are you seeing those bugs again?”

I got up, maybe a little too fast, and led her to my room. You see I kept seeing more and more of them throughout the week. Moving around like I wasn't here. It kept getting harder to ignore them. I opened the door to my room and stepped inside. I stopped at my bedside table looking towards the office area of the room. “They're mostly over here.”  I gestured towards the whole area. ‘Mostly’ implies that I see them elsewhere, but I don't.  I see them in my office only. They never go past my bedside table. 

My sister came in and looked over the area. I looked to the floor surprised to see nothing. The bugs that were plagueing my room were gone. I looked at my desk and other parts of my room suddenly feeling embarrassed. My office was a mess. The plant I kept near my desk was definitely at the end of its life. Papers, pens, pencils littered about. I had a pile of clothes in the corner, and what I like to call ‘boxes of doom’ underneath my desk. They were boxes of random things, like a junk drawer but underneath my desk and in a box. Obviously you could see the reason as to why I might have attracted these bugs. 

My sister didn't say anything about the state of my office. Instead she handed me bug spray “well, let's start getting rid of your bug problem.” 

We started to move things around to find where the silverfish were hiding. I moved the pile of clothes into my laundry hamper. The boxes off the floor and out of the room, looked underneath my drawer, and nothing, no bugs to be found, just dust and a couple things that rolled underneath my drawer. My sister continued to look around with me but we soon gave up. Putting the boxes back we went to go drink some coffee in the living room, taking a break. 

“I swear they were there, practically taking up the whole space,” I exaggerated. 

She looked at me skeptically, “Maybe they found a hiding spot underneath the floor, or in the cracks of the floor and wall.”

“Maybe, but I saw them this morning, they don't care if I'm around, so why would they all collectively decide to hide?”

“Jess, they're bugs, they didn't decide anything, they're just doing what bugs do.”

I sighed, feeling defeated. I looked up at the ceiling, my head being supported by the couch, and my hands warmed up by the cup of coffee I'm holding. Today was cooler than the others. It probably rained recently. 

My sister broke the silence, “Maybe this is like the spider thing.” 

“The spider thing?” I repeated back glancing at her. 

“Yep, remember when we had bunk beds as kids?”

I sat up, taking a sip of my coffee.  “I guess,... I had the top bunk, right?” 

She nodded, “Yep, and well after a couple years or so you started seeing these spiders in the corners of the ceiling, you refused to go up there, telling Dad to kill them.” 

I didn't remember any of this, I do remember that if I saw a spider I would get my father to kill them, but nothing about these times.

“Usually, I would've told him not to kill them just to take it outside.” 

“Oh yeah, I remember that,” I smiled.  “I didn't really care as long as he got rid of them.” 

“Yep, but,.. um there were no spiders.” 

“What?” I looked at her confused.

“Whenever you brought Dad to kill those spiders you saw, there wasn't actually anything there.” 

I really don't remember any of this.

“I don't get it, why the hell would I do that, then.” 

She shrugged.  “Not sure.  Dad thought it was a kid thing, that you'd grow out of it. I think that you didn't want to have a bunk bed anymore, that you wanted your own room. I'm pretty sure when we got rid of the bunk bed, you stopped seeing those spiders everywhere.  And well, Dad was right in a way, you grew out of it.” 

I paused, taking in this new memory.  “Alright, so how does that relate to this?” 

“You need a change of pace Jess, maybe go outside, hang out with friends, maybe take a vacation from work.”

I rolled my eyes at that.

“Maybe get a pet, give you something to take care of.” 

“I don't know, I'm not big on pets.” 

After that she started to nag me, needlessly worried about me, my sleeping and eating habits. She's always like that whenever she comes over. I got her to change the subject and we had a normal, relaxing time. On the couch taking a much needed break. I think we both need days like that. where it's just the two of us hanging out like old times. 

After she left that afternoon, I didn't see the silverfish until two or three days later. Except they were so much bigger than before, crawling in groups of three or four, together as moving clumps on the floor, as if one being.

As we were wrapping up our notes in the basement, we heard shouting above.

“Husband, must be.” Carson stated.

“Want me to handle it?” I asked.

What people won’t tell ya in the movies is that this is always the hardest part of the job. No matter how desensitized the job becomes, telling innocent civilians they will never see their loved ones again will never become easier. In this case, even worse. The husband won’t even get to do an open casket at the funeral, and on top of that his son’s missing. Carson and I agreed to not tell him about the feather. Racism in this state has led to a lot of racially motivated murders and since his wife, Natalie Bodaway was a white woman we wouldn’t want him to blame himself for this crime. 

“Yeah, fuck, could you get this one?”

“Yeah I got you man” I replied.

As we made our way back upstairs, something caught my eye. A sharp tooth, covered in blood at the base of the stairs. I picked it up, observed it with Carson then put it in a zip lock bag to get analyzed by forensics. Once I placed it in the Ziplock I noticed I nicked myself on the thumb and was bleeding. Maybe they have a pet I thought? Regardless it probably wasn’t going to come up with much. As soon as we turned the corner atop the staircase in the empty door frame was a man, presumably John Bodaway covered in dirt and grime being held back by Riggs and two other officers trying to keep him from entering.

“Ah shit, this one is gonna be rough.” I stated plainly. Carson just stared blankly to the ground not looking up to meet me or anybody else in the eye. I made my way over.

The man's bright red face looked as though the grief and anger were going to spill molten lava out of every orifice visible to the naked eye. In his blind rage and pain he began shouting more once he saw us.

“Where the fuck is my wife?! I refuse to believe that she's dead, where were you huh where the fuck were you?!” The husband hollered.

I gestured to Riggs and his men to let him free and I approached the man. I stood face to face with a grieving husband. No matter what he says or does I can’t fault him because I’d want to kill anyone if anything like this happened to me and my family.

“John Bodaway? I work homicide. I am Detective Ralph Irons. I can’t imagine what your going through right now but–”. John punched me squarely in the jaw causing some blood to drop on the spotless flooring.

“Fuck you pig! Spouting your rehearsed lines, fuck that. Tell me something useful or get the fuck out after I look at the corpse you claim is my wife. And where is my boy?” He began to cry.

Riggs and his men began to rush towards John and I waved them off. Not wanting to punish this defeated man more than he has already been punished by God and on top of it, they were rehearsed lines. What is this job turning me into? I grabbed him from the top of his shirt below his neck and swore to him.

“John, we are going to help you. I am sorry. And I swear to you, I will find your boy. From one father to another I won’t rest till we bring whoever did this to justice.”

    John looked at me, the pain in his eyes were palpable, he nodded at me. Once I let go of him I asked him if his wife had a black crow tattoo on her ribs. As soon as the words left my mouth his anger washed off his face in an instant and only anguish remained. He confirmed that it was his wife. I said right now we didn’t have any solid leads or much evidence but since this has happened once before, hopefully the department will give us more time and resources will be used towards finding the killer and his son.

“Can I see her? Can I please see my wife's face? I want to apologize to my wife for all my mistakes.” John pleaded.

I told John he shouldn’t go down there. I had to tell a father his son was missing and his wife was dismembered in his own home, regardless if they were separated I can only imagine what he’s going through. After I explained why he couldn't, John collapsed to the ground and started wailing on the hardwood floor till his knuckles were bloodied. Carson was in the corner of the kitchen with his head down.

When tensions lowered, Police escorted John back to his brother's house, afraid of him driving himself. I made sure to get John’s contact information before he left and I promised him I will give him a call If Carson and I get any leads. When everyone had left Carson walked up to me.

“Thanks for taking that punch for me.” With a light smirk.

“Yeah no problem, want to go get a drink? I could use something for the pain, that big Indian sure can throw a haymaker” I laughed as much as someone could laugh at a moment like this. How else could anyone make it through a job like this without trying to laugh instead of actually thinking about all the horror? I lied to Carson, the punch didn’t hurt that bad. I just wanted to blur the image of John’s wife, or whatever was left of her out of my mind.

“Yeah sure, I could use one too.” Carson replied.

The car ride after the bar was silent. The type of silence that's deafening. No amount of alcohol was gonna permanently erase what we both saw that night. Where did that fucking kid go? Despite driving well beyond the legal limit, I made it back to the station where we dropped off the tooth to be processed by Kim at forensics. When I parked the car outside of Carson's car, he looked at me and paused before stating,

“You know you shouldn’t have lied to him. You promised him you’d find the boy. We have no leads, and the kid from two weeks ago has no trace either. Remember the only reason we even suspected Tallulah Birdinground of having a kid was the walker next to her corpse at the park. We have jack shit.”

“ I know, but if I was in John’s shoes right now, I’d prefer to be lied to.”

“See ya tomorrow”, Carson left.

    Cognitive dissonance can be defined as mental discomfort from two or more conflicting attitudes, beliefs, and feelings. That is what it is like coming home to my wife Khalyn after work. To pretend everything is okay when I haven’t felt okay for a long time. Being married to a cop isn’t a walk in the park but she made it seem that way. She loved me despite the late nights, despite the nightmares, despite the alcohol on my breath. I didn’t deserve her. I came home at 1 in the morning and she had her bed side lamp on and waited for me to come home. Her growing excitement for the baby, and I was emotionally unavailable. I have had so much fear of bringing a child into this world. Ever since Keenan.

“ How was work, my love?” She asked innocently.

    She was the only person in this whole world I could melt to from just her words. I began to weep. I told her I couldn’t talk to her about it until I was ready but she understood. She understood me completely. I kissed her goodnight and flipped to my side, tears down my cheek, the stench of black coffee, a cigarette, and six huckleberry Moscow mules still on my tongue. I passed out. 

I had a dream last night. I have a unique ability to remember my dreams and I make it a habit to write down what I dreamt of as soon as I wake up. It plays like a movie in my head. I was falling, falling off a cliff into snow. When I hit the ground, I didn’t wake up like I normally would in dreams where I fall. I couldn’t move, what appeared as red blood spread through the snow surrounding me. I felt warm. In the distance I saw someone or something, on all floors slowly crawling toward me. Simultaneously I heard singing, a chant-like rhythm that vibrated my ears. Children's voices sang the toon. Before I could see what was approaching me I woke up. To my knowledge this is what the children sang.

“Oh, Red Woman, child of the flame,

Cloaked in silence, never speak her name.

In the wind she is dancing, in dreams she is near,

A warning, a whisper, a shadow of fear.”

Then I woke up.

The phone rang at 7 AM. It was forensics. I stumbled out of my bed with a piercing headache and grabbed the phone. Kim got the lab results back from the tooth.

“Ralph, the blood on the tooth did belong to Natalie Bodaway. However, we are a bit confused.” Kim stated.

“What about?” I replied

“The tooth you gave us, we tried to age the tooth to get an idea of roughly how old the suspect would be. We weren’t able to connect it to any DNA in any of our records. So we tried radiocarbon dating. From our estimates, the tooth you gave us came from someone who likely would have died 400 years ago.”",1,1760392259.0,creepcast,0,1.0,False

1o5xeyl,https://www.reddit.com/r/CreepCast_Submissions/comments/1o5xeyl/there_are_bugs_everywhere/,There are bugs everywhere,"I wouldn't say my place is all that dirty, sure it's messy but not dirty. I live on the fourth floor of an apartment building. It's relatively small but perfect for someone who lives alone. There is one room, one bathroom and it comes with an open kitchen. It's perfect and I've been living here for about a year, close to two.

I work from home so I don't tend to have much of a reason to go out, unless it's to keep sane and socialize with the outside world. I started working from home a couple months back and it's been great. I choose when to work and when to take breaks as long as I stay within the hours I'm supposed to work a day. It's a good job and I make enough to live. These days though my sleep schedule has been extremely off. I can almost sleep through the whole day and so I work mostly during the night. I've been trying to fix that mostly by staying up all night and day and going to bed at a normal time. 

The way my horrible sleep schedule started was on one particularly hot night. I kept tossing and turning, unable to fall asleep properly. The night was hot and humid, the blanket heavy, the bed uncomfortable, and the fan, loud and in my ears, only pushed the hot air around the room. I'd turn, flipping my pillow to the other side, the temperature the same on both sides. I wonder who cursed me that night. I wouldn't be surprised if I couldn't find my glasses that morning. 

So with a sigh I got up and went to my desk deciding to stay up for the rest of the night. Bringing the fan with me, I placed it down next to me as I took my seat. My glasses, still off, my phone now on, I scrolled mindlessly to pass the time. What felt like five minutes passed when out of the corner of my eye something blurry was on my lap. 

Grey and crawling on me I slapped it away.  I threw on my glasses and looked to the floor to see if it was there.  Nothing.  A shiver ran through me. probably wasn't enough to kill it so it ran off under something, my dresser, maybe the piles of clothes or random boxes I had on the floor.

 I got up taking minimal steps to my bed, deciding to just shrug off what happened, but it felt like it was still on me. Crawling up my legs to my thighs.  little legs, itching, and biting me. I'd rub my legs scratching at them to get the feeling off. It only multiplied though, on my feet between my toes, up my ankles to the calves, up to my thighs. I knew nothing was there, so after some moments of unrelenting scratching and picking, I'd stop and focus on something else to get my mind off the uncomfortable sensation. I was tired and hot, and sweating like crazy.  So maybe that's what magnified that situation so much.

I didn't sleep the rest of the night and stayed up till the morning. I decided to start my day at five with a cup of coffee forgetting everything that happened, except now with my glasses on I'd see them. crawling about like they owned the place. 

I was at my desk working and on the floor Silverfish, on the bigger side, would be freely crawling around. Multiple of them. To the point that I couldn't just ignore them, I'd have to kill a few. And god I hate killing those things.  The feeling of it squishing under my hand with a thin tissue separating us made me gag in disgust.  But the more I killed, the more I'd see them. I only saw about five of them at a time, but they moved around so much that it felt as though a lot more were hiding in my room. 

I had to ignore them. So I chose to just focus on my work, keeping my eyes on my computer. When lunch rolled around nothing was there, zero bugs crawled around the floor of my room.

When I came back from lunch, they got bolder, moving around closer to me, crawling up my chair. That's when I decided to pack up my things and move to the living room away from those disgusting things. 

I still decided to sleep in my bed that night. Luckily, the silverfish only stayed in the office area of my room, going nowhere near my bed. I felt safe in my bed like I already knew that they wouldn't be able to touch me there. 

I steer clear of that area now. working in the living room, sleeping in my bed, eating in the kitchen. If I need anything in that area I go over avoiding the multiplying bugs, getting what I need and not going back. 

It's not hard. I just ignore it. Sometimes I look over, accidentally making eye contact with one of those little things. I just look away disgusted and leave the room making sure to close the door keeping them in. At least it's just in that part of the apartment, I can live with that for now.",1,1760392220.0,CreepCast_Submissions,0,0.99,False

I am genuinely trying to understand the logic here? She wears Birkenstocks, her car has leather seats, and she drinks chai and coffee with milk. Plus, both of them own so many luxury bags that are clearly made of leather.

I’m a fun and adventurous guy seeking a Dominant woman who is interested in a Female Led Relationship.

I’m 35, 5’11”, I live an active lifestyle, a bit nerdy, and can be a bit shy when first meeting people.

In my Vanilla life, I have my life together and work a full time job in Tech. On my free time, I love making art, playing video/board games, planning out travel trips, concerts, and hanging out with friends.

In the bdsm world, I’d love to find a dominant to serve. I love the rituals, giving up controls, and focusing entirely on my partner. I enjoy being caged, love bondage, following directions, pegging, body worship, and humiliation. I’m not into findom and am not interested in pro-dommes. I would like to develop a meaningful relationship with a power dynamic involved. I hope to meet a goddess to serve soon!

1o5x1pi,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1o5x1pi/aita_for_controlling_my_moms_life/,AITA for controlling my mom's life?,"So, long story short, my marriage didn't work out. I'll be moving out and renting a house with my mom and brother (21), who are currently living with my dad. Yes, mom and dad separated a couple years back, but my mom couldn't afford to rent on her own so she kept living with my father. 

Before the move even happened, I laid some ground rules like everything is split equally between us 3, etc etc, and that my mom could not go party before my kids went to bed. I got 2 small (not so small, 3 and 8yo) daughters and they usually go to bed at around 10pm. I told my mom she could only start getting ready to go out at night after my daughters went to bed because I am trying to raise my little family (even if by myself) and I don't want them to live in that environment where we normalize going partying in mini dresses every single night. My mom immediately called me an A-hole and accused me of trying to control her life. 

From where I stand, I'm just trying to protect myself (from future problems) and my daughters (trying to give them a normal family life), and honestly it's not like I'm telling her to not go out, I'm just asking for her to start getting ready after the kids go to bed.  I feel this is reasonable but she found a bunch of issues with it (""what if it's a dinner with my work colleagues and I have to be there before 10pm? What if it's just a coffee?"" Etc etc) so I went further and told her that even though this is the rule, there can be exceptions and the rule is just there to prevent it from being an every day thing. My mom got pissed at me and said she didn't agree. I told her this isn't something I'm gonna back down on because I have to think of my daughters and the goal I have for how my life will look like, so take it or leave it. She again called me an A-hole and that she's my mom, I'm not hers and therefore I can't control her life. Since she got mad, she started saying a bunch of hurtful things like ""I'm not gonna parent your kids"" and ""don't you think you'll go out partying and I'll be taking care of your kids"" (Mind you this has never, ever happened. My mom kept the kids 3/4 times and it was on days I was working from 5Am to 7Pm. She never kept the kids for me to go out at all, because either I can bring the kids or I don't go) 

At this point, I kinda wanna move by myself and spare myself all these problems and drama. I do feel the moral obligation of helping them out, especially my brother, because without me they can't afford to rent and the situation between my parents is not good and my brother is just in the middle of constant arguing but he also says he wants to avoid moving without my mother because she will be pissed off if we do (and he's right..)

I'm not backing down on the rule though. Does that make me the A-hole? ",2,1760391349.0,AITAH,5,1.0,False
1o5wzyb,https://i.redd.it/21xf3l2h5yuf1.jpeg,"Some McDonald's Goodies, Pt. 6 (READ BEFORE COMMENTING)","**🚨 Day 6 – 10 Offers Available🚨**

Hey everyone 👋

It’s **Day 6**, and I’m back with **10 offers** today! I know it’s a little light compared to some of the previous days, and unfortunately, all I have to offer right now are **small offers**. But don’t worry — if you’re holding out for larger items, definitely **check back with my post tomorrow**.

**Yesterday was a huge success — we were able to get free food to 20 people!** 🍔💛 That truly warms my soul and makes me happy to keep doing this for the community.

**Please remember:** I’m just one disabled guy sitting on his couch doing this from home, so please be patient with me while I work through everyone’s comments and messages. I’ll get to you as soon as I can — I promise I’m doing my best.



**How this works:**

**1️⃣ Comment “Interested”** if you’d like to be considered for today’s giveaway.

* Do NOT request specific items (no “fries,” “nuggets,” etc.) — the menu and availability change constantly.
* I will NOT hold or save specific items for anyone. Everything is first come, first served.
* Make your comment a new top-level comment, not a reply to someone else’s — Reddit sometimes clumps replies and it makes ordering hard.
* When I see your comment, I’ll reply with a number to acknowledge that I’ve seen you and to let you know your spot in line.
* Don’t worry if your number is higher than today’s total of 10 offers. Sometimes people don’t respond, can’t follow through, or the timing doesn’t work out — so even if you’re number 11 or 14, you still have a chance. Just be patient.
* ***IF YOU BECOME UNAVAILABLE BEFORE I REACH YOUR TURN, PLEASE COMMENT TO LET ME KNOW.*** *This helps keep things running smoothly and prevents me from waiting on someone who’s no longer able to pick up their offer.*

**2️⃣ Unsolicited DMs will be ignored.**

* Please do not message me before I message you.
* Once it’s your turn, I’ll DM you first with instructions.

**3️⃣ Once I DM you,** you’ll have about 15 minutes to respond and coordinate your pickup. If I don’t hear back, I’ll move to the next person.

**4️⃣ When it’s your turn, I’ll ask:**

* the ZIP code of the McDonald’s you’ll be picking up from
* whether you’re using drive-thru or counter pickup
* and I’ll tell you what’s still available at that point (you can’t claim items early — what’s left changes constantly).

**5️⃣ After I place your order,** I’ll send a screenshot with the code to show at the drive-thru or counter.

**6️⃣ Please reply to your original comment** once you’ve picked up your food so others know it’s legit.



**A few quick notes:**

* I can only redeem one offer every 15 minutes. If I’m ordering for different states, the app sometimes glitches — just be patient.
* If you won’t be near a McDonald’s for a few hours, maybe skip this round so I can keep the line moving.
* It’s still first come, first served. I can’t hold items or guarantee certain ones.



**Once all offers have been claimed:**

* I’ll change the post’s flair to **“Given”** so everyone knows that the day’s giveaways are complete.
* If I have not received any new requests for **2 hours straight**, I’ll call it for the night and any remaining offers will **roll over to the next day**.
* If I have not DM’d you by that time, unfortunately today wasn’t your day — but don’t give up! You can always try again tomorrow.
* I’ll also hang around in the comments for at least one hour after the last offer is claimed to answer questions, chat, or offer tips for anyone who wants to try doing this themselves.



**Important note:**

* Some McDonald’s franchises do not participate in redeeming food prizes — that’s out of my control.
* This subreddit does not allow post edits once live, so if you want the latest status or availability, **sort comments by “new.”**
   * I often post timestamped updates once we start running low on certain items.
   * If you’re only after a specific item (like a Snack Wrap) and you see it’s gone in my updates, feel free to **remove yourself from the line** to save everyone time.",3,1760391241.0,Freefood,10,0.67,False

Ten years ago when I moved back to my home state from abroad it was because of I felt like I needed to get my life together. I made a decision to go back. And the first five years was met with hardship. I worked a low paying job at a coffee shop trying to figure out my career all while living in my Mother’s basement being addicted to porn and generally feeling like a loser while actively trying to build my life up. I know that I needed to stop the fantasizing and being swept away by them so I tried my best to be extremely pragmatic. I read and follow Stoicism (as it got popular) and put my head down and grinded for a few years even when it seemed like there was no hope of moving out or making/saving enough money.

I’ll spare you all the gory details. But eventually I saved enough to move out, got a decent job that Ive held for the last five years, learned a lot, increased my salary, and even met an amazing woman that I love and married.

The problem is that I feel suddenly paralyzed and cant take the next step in life. Im afraid of becoming a father, I’m afraid to leave my job that is beginning to not serve me anymore (hit the ceiling on growth and poor management) and I can’t decide where to move to. My wife and I want to move out of state but, I cant make up my mind and it’s starting to cause fights.

Nothing seems like the right decision and I realized that I still feel like I did when I moved home ten years ago: like nothing makes sense and no direction is the right direction.

Im afraid of becoming like so many people of my parent’s generation who dig their heels in and build a comfortable prison for themselves. And, it feels like the longer I take to make a move, it feels like doors are closing on my life. It’s increasing my anxiety ten fold and has me feeling like I’m trapped. I don’t want to make a rash decision and regret it. I also don’t care about making the “right” decision, I just don’t want to backslide on all the progress I made.

The main issue I'm running into at this point is when I copy and paste the formula, the lookup returns '#REF'. I would really appreciate any advice on the best way to go about this.

I was sitting today on my lunch break, praying and listening to music, and thinking about talking to my priest yesterday about being more intentional and selective in my dating. So, I want to try and experiment, if you'll go with me. 

If you like, you can read more about me on my profile, but what I'd like to do here is put a handful of songs that, for me, instantly evoke in me those feelings and emotions that I would want to feel for my future wife. I'd also like to, with the song, give some explanation about why this song means so much to me, or a vignette about where I would see this music pop into my heart as we were together. 

What I'm hoping happens, as I cast this into the internet, is that it might find a woman who feels these songs like I do, as if we were the last two birds of our kind in the world, and suddenly and wonderfully, you recognize that our voices, our songs, belong together. If you feel that way, you can check out my profile, where you can find more general information and my picture. And, I don't know, perhaps love can begin with a playlist?

When I think about my love, I think of her on some gorgeous mountain hike, surrounded by wildflowers, looking down on some ocean bay, watching the ships pass by. I think about collecting a handful of those wildflowers and giving them to her. We sit, feeling out the prickling mix of old heartbreaks, of loneliness, of our own times where we have felt not enough, not worth being loved. This song plays in my heart, in that moment when our eyes meet, and there are tears in both our eyes, and the words ""yes! It's you! You're the one I've waited so very long for, and though it took long years, it was worth every moment, just for this moment in your eyes. It's you! Wonderful you... and we belong together."" It's the moment where infatuation gives way to the wild, wonderful potential that there is true love, and that we both belong among the wildflowers.

Just as important to me as the moment of our eyes meeting, and seeing that love we both feel reflected in each other's eyes, is the moment when you begin trusting me with your wounds. One of the things I feel deeply is that my heart was meant to be a place of healing and peace for a love who has learned wisdom through that heartache. I want my arms to be your hedge of protection, my prayers to always bring your heaviness to God, and my lips to kiss every cut. To look into your eyes, that might look away lost in some old hurt, and to feel me reach out my hand to hold yours, and say ""you have come by way of sorrow, like me. But we are welcome at Love's table.""

Our first slow dance together. We find ourselves in some park in the cool of the evening, or on some porch, delaying our goodbyes, because it is so hard to go back into a world where you aren't right there with me. I laugh and start playing this song, holding out my hand to you. We dance, slowly, in each other's arms, just feeling how well our bodies, our arms, feel wrapped around each other. It's here, as Nora Jones says, ""come away with me"", that the impossible begins to feel not only possible, but like a plan: that we are going to leap from our lives alone, into each other's touch, and dance our way into some bright, beautiful future together.

And yet, ""never did the course of true love run smooth"". We will end up fighting. Stupid arguments. Mistakes. A drunken night where we both said things we regret. That moment when I truly love you, and because of that, feel the tearing pain in my chest of knowing I might lose you, or you might lose me. The dark walks alone, apart, in our own thoughts, trying to make sense of this part of loving someone, enjoy to see them in all their flawed humanity, and bitterness, and cruelty... and at last stay. The moment we sing ""I don't love you, but I always will.""

But then, wonderfully, we survive. From the early infatuation, from the wildflowers, from the sweet dances and first kiss. Through the preparation and prayer, through the hectic and nerve-wracking moments of meeting each other's family and friends, through the fights. Through the last doubts, we find ourselves at last here, on our wedding day. I imagine looking into my love's eyes, and saying with the weight of the months of work we have done to understand, to work, to be sure, every word of those vows. My love can hear it in my voice that I mean it. Every word. And I can see in my love's eyes that she knows I mean it. And though we both know quite well that the marriage is only sealing and showing to the world the work we have already begun, to become a family, it is still full of the weight of knowing that this day will be with us, for the rest of our lives.

And then... home! Home, my love. True home. I have been a nomad most of my life, traveling across states, across the world, never resting, never knowing that \*this\* is the place where I belong. This is the place we belong. This song plays one random day, in those first years of our marriage, and it hits me all at once that we've made it. We've done it! We have a family, a home- no, we are home. How could I help but rush from my car, half running up the steps, just to find you wherever you are, whatever you are doing, and hold you as close as my body will allow to me to press you into my soul, tears streaming from my eyes for a moment, as I whisper, ""thank you, and thank God, for you being my home.""

I can only imagine what that moment will feel like when it is mine and my love's child. But I have worked as a teacher, both elementary and high school, as well as a camp counselor and an interpretive park ranger. I have worked with children, and I know that joy is always mixed with the profound awareness that we do not really know what we are doing. There will be that moment, sometime around our children's teenage years, exasperated by yet another bad school grade, or fight, or breakup, or explosion of drama, where my love and I sigh, and looking at each other, laugh. ""Does anybody have a map, or happen to know how the hell to do this?"" I'll say, and we will breathe, knowing we can get through this, too, together.

We grow old together. Year after year, loving each wrinkle that shows in our faces, each new gray hair. And one day, we will blink and look up from our books, still cuddled comfortably together after all these years on the couch, reading. We'll look into each other's eyes, and think about our children, and their children. We'll know that it has been a journey, steeped in prayers, rich all along the way in God's guiding presence, with its fair share of hardships and heartaches. But I will lean over, and kiss your rosy, wrinkled cheek, and groan as I get up. ""Well,"" I'll say, ""time to get the car ready. Gotta go see the 'lils"", my affectionate name for the new grandbabies. And you'll hear me hum this song as I get the juice pouches, snacks, and coffee for us ready in our day bag.

I thought I would share something I learned after setting up coffee service in a few office and co-working locations. Most people still think of an “office coffee machine” as one of those small drip brewers that make a few pots a day. But modern tabletop vending machines have changed the game completely.

Here is what surprised me most:

* They are small but powerful. A modern tabletop coffee vending machine can brew espresso, cappuccino, latte, and even hot chocolate. It fits on a counter, but it runs like a commercial unit.
* Perfect for shared offices. In co-working spaces or mid-size offices, one tabletop machine can serve dozens of people each day. It keeps up with traffic far better than a household coffee maker.
* Built-in payment options. Many units accept cash, card, or mobile payments. That makes them ideal for offices that want a self-serve setup without managing supplies.
* 4G connectivity and smart control. You can monitor stock, temperature, and cleaning reminders remotely. If you are an operator, it feels like having a digital manager in every breakroom.
* Cleaner and more consistent. No more overflowing pots or burnt coffee at the bottom of the carafe. Every cup is fresh and made to order.

I used to think vending machines and office brewers were two totally different things, but the newer tabletop coffee systems blur that line. They serve quality drinks like a café while running automatically like a vending machine.

If you are setting up an office or co-working space, this guide helped me compare models and decide what to buy:

👉 Best Office Coffee Machines [https://vmfsusa.com/best-office-coffee-machines/](https://vmfsusa.com/best-office-coffee-machines/)

It covers what to look for, how to size the machine for your team, and how modern coffee vending systems can work as both a staff perk and a reliable revenue stream.

Nothing weird, nothing romantic — just two people sharing thoughts, laughs, and life from different corners of the world.

A bit about me: I’m divorced, live alone, and have a grown-up daughter who’s married and living in New Zealand. I’ve got a great job that keeps me on my toes, but even with work and life ticking along, I sometimes find myself wishing for a good chat with someone new. There’s something comforting about exchanging emails and getting to know another person’s world — especially when you’re oceans apart.

Ideally, we’d swap emails every few days — no pressure or schedule, just whenever we both have a moment to share what’s new or what’s on our minds. I’m not looking for constant contact or drama; I just enjoy real conversation.

I’m open to chatting about almost anything: travel dreams, day-to-day life, funny stories, random musings, or even the great mysteries of the universe (like why socks vanish in the laundry). You don’t need to have the same interests as me — I actually love talking to people who see the world differently. Life would be painfully dull if we all liked the same movies, food, or music.

Speaking of which — I’m a big fan of coffee, and I’m pretty sure I drink more of it than my doctor would recommend. I like walking by the beach, people-watching at cafés, and pretending to be decisive when choosing a Netflix show (before inevitably rewatching The Office or Breaking Bad). I don’t currently have any pets, but I’ve got a soft spot for dogs and a suspicion that cats secretly rule the planet.

And yes — the “divorced and live alone” part might sound a bit sketchy online, but I promise I’m not creepy. No heavy breathing, no strange DMs, and definitely no bodies in the trunk of my car 😅. I just think it’s nice to talk to someone friendly once in a while.

I like to think of myself as easygoing, honest, and a bit sarcastic — in the good way. I enjoy learning about different cultures, hearing about other people’s daily lives, and finding humor in the ordinary. I’m also a firm believer that we’re never too old to make new friends or share a laugh with someone new.

So, if you’d enjoy exchanging emails with a laid-back guy who appreciates good conversation and bad jokes, send me a DM. Tell me a bit about where you live, what makes you laugh, or what’s been on your mind lately.

No pressure, no weirdness — just two people having a friendly chat through the magic of the internet.

Looking forward to hearing from someone out there — wherever “there” happens to be.

Hey fellow automators! 🌟 

Have you ever felt like you’re on a hamster wheel, running like crazy but not really getting anywhere? Yeah, I’ve been there too. It’s like the ‘work hard’ mantra has become our default mode, but what if we could flip the script? 🤔

**Here’s the kicker:** What if I told you that some people are *printing money* from their couches without ever showing their face? Sounds dreamy, right? With all the automation tools at our fingertips, we can totally optimize our hustle. Here’s how to make that happen:

### 1. **Get Your Tech On**
– **Use AI tools**: Seriously, these can save you hours of work. Think of tools like ChatGPT for content creation or even social media bots to interact with your audience. Ask yourself: Why write another post when AI can give you a head start?
  
### 2. **Faceless Branding**
– **Create valuable content**: The beauty is, you don’t need to appear on camera or even show your face. Think blogs, podcasts, or graphics. Have you tried Canva for slick designs? Easy-peasy! 🎨 

### 3. **Affiliate Marketing Magic**
– **Practice passive income**: Join affiliate programs! That means you can share products you love and earn money while you sleep. I’ve stumbled upon a gem here: [Maximize Me](https://www.checkout-ds24.com/redir/540531/maximizeme/)—check it out, it's like having a money printing press at your fingertips! Just think: sipping coffee while cash rolls in, huh?

### 4. **Batch Everything**
– **Plan and prep**: Batch your content creation and scheduling. It’s like meal prepping, but for your business. Who else has made excuses about not having time? 🙋‍♂️

### 5. **Data-Driven Decisions**
– **Focus on analytics**: Check what works! Spend some time looking at your metrics—what posts are getting traction? This is your GPS to success.

Let’s be real though—this isn’t magic. You’ve got to put in some work upfront, but once you do, it’s like planting seeds and watering them occasionally, while just watching the garden of your dreams grow. 🌱 

And okay, we can’t all be Steve Jobs or Elon Musk right away (though wouldn’t that be cool?), but what if we just took one step today? Automate one task. Try out an AI tool. Let’s stop competing with the clock and start working smart instead of hard.

So what do you think, friends? Anyone already on their faceless journey? How’s that going for you? Or maybe you have a total game changer you want to share? Let's brainstorm and inspire each other! 🚀",1,1760390044.0,AIContentAutomators,0,1.0,False

some days are fucking brutal. I'll miss her so much I convince myself the separation was a mistake and we should just go back to how things were. other days I remember exactly why we needed space and feel clear about it

the thing that keeps me grounded? my journal

whenever I start romanticizing shit or questioning everything, I go back and read what I ACTUALLY wrote during our worst fights. not what my brain wants to remember, but what I felt in real time. it's like having a honest conversation with past-me who was living through it

I do both paper + digital journaling (yeah I'm extra lol). recently been using this app I built called Ezra that has AI built in, and ngl it's been weirdly helpful? like when I'm spiraling it can be like ""you've written about feeling drained after arguments 15 times this month but also hopeful after your coffee dates"" - patterns I completely miss when I'm in my feelings

not saying it's therapy or anything, but having something that knows my whole story helps me see the bigger picture when emotions fuck with my head

paper journal is still for the really heavy stuff tho. can't replace that

I’ll start by saying, yes I've openly and frequently *verbally* told him what I'd like from him. I'm looking for constructive advice on what's worked for others to actually have their partner meet their expectations long term? None of this is a total dealbreaker (just frustrating) so not looking for ""just break up.""


Background: Been together 5.5 years. I have two older kids with my ex & my SO and I have a shared child who is 8 months old. We both work full time and even though he makes more than I do we split everything 50/50 financially. I do all the cooking, dishes, kitchen clean-up and laundry. Our baby is exclusively breastfed so I do the feeding, bathing and nighttime routine including waking up overnights with her.


With all the above, I don't have a great desire to be out and active socially. I see my best friend once every couple weeks over my lunch break for coffee. We text here or there. I speak to my parents daily. And that's really all the ""outside my home"" interaction l need. I *do* prefer engagement with my companion..this is where we're hitting a bit of an issue.


My SO goes to work and comes home and immediately sits on the couch. He chats with his friends all day long. He continues to chat with his friends all night long, be it on his phone/discord or over video games. He also sees these friends at least once weekly in person. He says there's nothing wrong with being social. Sure, there isn't. However, he seems to prioritize this over other things, imo, and when l've brought this up he repeats the line above.


Now, I am generally pretty easy going and don't care a whole lot if he hangs with these friends, but l'd also like his undivided attention sometimes. I also have other needs as well, and while he is pretty good at meeting the physical aspect of those needs, there are times that falls to wayside too. I absolutely avoid bringing this part up bc he gets upset, so instead I try to focus on the emotional needs that I feel aren't being met when I'm feeling ""neglected."" When I've mentioned it'd be nice if he could listen to me talk without having his face in his phone, he'll try for a day and then resort to his old ways. It'd be nice if we could watch a show together, which we do occasionally but once a week would be nice. A date night with just us two would be cool, but when we make plans he usually invites his friends.


He’s taken 3 solo trips this year with plans for a 4th. I've obvs done none bc of our baby (still nursing so it'd be a pain to go w/o her). It seems like he's had plenty of social time and it'd be nice to have him give me some time now. When I brought this up the other day he said ""All I need is to come home from work and get to cuddle in bed before we sleep, that's enough for me."" And then later on followed up by saying ""When are you just going to move on from this and be happy with all that you have."" This felt really dismissive. I am grateful for the things I have in life. But I don't think that just bc all he needs to feel loved/desired is to cuddle before bed that I should have to settle for that when that doesn't fill my cup. I think I've done more than pull my weight around the household and part of the reciprocation for that would be to make sure I'm being emotionally tended to.


**Anyhow, if you've been in a similar situation what have you done/implemented to make sure your SO actually sticks to the things you need to feel emotionally fulfilled?** Do I need to print off an actual calendar with a night devoted to just the two of us every week? Idk… just looking for something other than just talking it over.


Tl;dr how can I get my SO to meet my needs long term without just repeating myself over and over?",1,1760389808.0,relationships,4,1.0,False

 4. Simmer only 20 min uncovered to concentrate flavors.
 5. Finish with lime, top, and serve.

Still rich, smoky, and mood-lifting — just faster.

🌈 Why this works & what it does for you

Flavor chemistry
 • Caramelizing the paste and spices in fat triggers the Maillard reaction for deep umami.
 • Deglazing dissolves that fond, giving restaurant-level richness.
 • Finishing acid (balsamic/lime) brightens every layer.

Neuro-nutrient synergy
 • Turkey (tyrosine) → dopamine precursor for motivation.
 • Lion’s Mane → stimulates nerve-growth factor for brain repair.
 • Mushrooms + beans → B-vitamins + prebiotic fiber = gut-brain balance.
 • Beets + turmeric → methylation support, magnesium, anti-inflammatory.
 • Cocoa + coffee → polyphenols, gentle endorphin and dopamine lift.
 • Avocado + olive oil → healthy fats for neuronal flexibility and stable mood.

5️⃣ Assemble the melt
 • Lay out 4 slices sourdough or focaccia.
 • Layer the mushroom mixture generously on two slices.
 • Add your cheese of choice (1–2 slices per sandwich).
 • Top with fresh arugula or spinach if desired.
 • Place the other slices of bread on top.

6️⃣ Toast or grill
 • Brush the outside of the bread lightly with butter or olive oil.
 • Grill on a skillet or panini press over medium heat, 3–4 minutes per side, until golden brown and cheese is melted or toast then pan-sear both sides.

7️⃣ Optional finishing touch
 • Just before serving, drizzle with a few drops of truffle oil, balsamic glaze, or lemon juice for contrast.
 • Sprinkle flaky salt or chili flakes for a final dopamine hit.

Flavor Profile

🔥 Smoky, buttery, tangy, creamy, umami-rich with bright acidic finish.

# Negotiations

On 2/21/2024, Paris and I talked for a second time, again outside of my house. I actually didn't want to talk right outside of my home, my lawyer also suggested it’s best to talk at a public location, like a coffee shop. But Paris refused to go anywhere else, saying she didn't know what my intentions were.

Paris asked me how I wanted to divide the assets. I knew there’s no way for me to get out of this mess unscathed. So I started by listing all the horrible things she did to me, and then gave the same proposal that I gave on 4/5/2023, which was to split the assets acquired when she lived with me, and I get to keep all the assets acquired when she was not living with me. Paris lived with me from April 2018 to August 2019, about a year and half. I also pointed out that she was often away from home even during those 1.5 years, claiming to “meet her advisor"" or ""vacationing"", but I am sure she really went to be with Sharik. I will not dwell over that, at least she was living with me most of the time during those 1.5 years.

Paris rejected my proposal, she proposed splitting assets acquired from April 2018 to March 2021, which is 3 years, plus I pay one year of spousal support. I asked what's the reason for adding the extra 1.5 years, given that she lived with Sharik during that time. Paris first denied living with Sharik from August 2019 to January 2020. She said she lived alone near University D, and Sharik only visited her every week and brought her groceries. I immediately told her I don’t believe it, as Sharik's background report clearly showed he lived near University D during that time. Paris then said she was pregnant with my child during that time and that she didn't want our daughter to be born out of wedlock. I felt there’s some merit in that statement, so I backed down and said I can extend it to March 2020, which was when Paris sent the child to California. However, she then went to live with Sharik in Colorado after that, which she admitted the previous week. Our daughter was only a little more than a month old at the time, a time when the child needed the mother the most. Instead of caring for our daughter, she went to Colorado just so she could be with her paramour. What kind of mother is this? How could she still have the nerve to ask for my money after doing something this horrific?

Paris said she needed to finish her degree. She already spent way too long on her PhD, her advisor was not happy with her progress, and if she didn't buckle down, she wouldn't be able to graduate. I then asked, if that was the case, why didn't she just stay in the apartment next to University? Paris was not a student of University D, and I don’t know why she was living there, but at least University D is not too far away from her school, about 50 miles. Longmont is more than 1,600 miles away from her school, what’s the rationale for going there? Paris said her school closed when the pandemic started, she had nowhere to go, and she needed somewhere quiet to work on her dissertation, so she went to live in Sharik’s house. I responded by saying, who on earth would believe something this ridiculous?

Paris then said that giving birth to our daughter caused severe damage to her body, and it took her a whole year to recuperate. She wanted that extra year mainly to compensate for the suffering she went through. I asked, if she was not well, why didn't she recuperate at home? Had she stayed at home, even if she just laid in bed the whole year and did nothing else, I can still accept it. Why did she have to recuperate in her paramour’s house? Also if she was not well, why didn't she go see a doctor? Why did she still fly so much? Paris then insisted she was at Longmont so she could concentrate on her dissertation. The negotiation is now at a stalemate. I insisted on counting two years, but Paris insisted on three years.

From February 15th to March 19th, Paris and I negotiated every week, for a total of six times. The first couple sessions were somewhat civil, but the latter ones became more and more heated, with both of us launching verbal attacks against one another. I won't go into details of what I said, it’s not hard to imagine it. Paris was still saying that I didn’t treat her well during the marriage. Some of her accusations were:

1. Paris said I was not supportive of her getting her PhD. I asked: “If I wasn’t supportive, then how were you able to spend eight years on your degree?”
2. Paris said I was constantly pressuring her to graduate and find a job. I asked: “Exactly how did I pressure you?” I only asked a few times given that she was taking so long, and that’s pressuring?
3. Paris said I didn't take care of her when she was sick. I asked: ""How could I have taken care of you when you didn't even live with me?""
4. Paris said my parents treated her poorly and called her fat. This is complete nonsense. She was the one that always said she’s fat, and my mother only told her once to not be so obsessed with her weight, and that’s calling her fat?
5. Paris said I didn’t give her money. I said: “I gave you a ton of money, there are records in the bank statements.” Paris then said I only gave her money when she asked me for it, if I cared for her then I should have given her money without her asking. I said: “Didn’t you often say that you are an independent woman and didn’t want me to support you? Every time you asked for money, you said you were just borrowing, and would pay me back once you find a job. Why won’t you pay me back now?”
6. Paris said I didn’t buy her gifts. I said: “I brought you a lot of gifts, such as iPhones, clothes, etc.” Paris then said those were all cheap stuff.
7. Paris said that one time when we were dining at a restaurant, I kept looking at some woman that sat next to us. I told her I didn’t know what she was talking about. Even if I did look at some woman, that’s nothing compared to her cohabiting with her paramour.
8. Paris said I wouldn't let her take care of our daughter. I asked: “Exactly when did I not let you take care of our child? You were the one that’s always busy and didn’t have time to see her.”

During the negotiations, Paris repeatedly told me that it will be very difficult for me to win the annulment trial. Continuing this fight is pointless and would only incur more legal fees. Furthermore, if I continue this trial, her lawyer would immediately petition that I pay more of her legal fees. Therefore, accepting her proposal is my best option. She’s right, my lawyer also told me winning annulment is very difficult. This lawsuit has already cost me more than $200,000 in legal fees. It pains and angers me when I receive the bill from my lawyer each month. Of course, I still told her that I'd rather give the money to my lawyer than giving it to a con artist. I also said that the judge clearly didn’t like her based on what happened during the 1/11/2024 hearing, so how could she say that I can’t win? Paris responded by saying the judge didn’t like her lawyer, not her. She also knew that her current lawyer is terrible, that’s why she already hired a much better lawyer.

I tried to insinuate by pointing out some of Paris’s strange behaviors. I asked her why both she and Sharik spent eight years on their PhDs, why both left their schools after just four years, and why both don’t work? Why are both of them so secretive, why did they travel all over the United States and move frequently? I said I didn’t believe the two of them really came to the United States for their PhDs. I also asked why the internet at my home disconnected everyday when she was there, but never had any issues after she left? Why did she always suspect that I was monitoring her? Why did she constantly tell me not to go through her stuff, and why did she move all her stuff out the same night she brought up divorce? And so on, … Paris didn't respond to any of the questions I asked, except for saying Sharik has a job when I asked why both of them don’t work. The following week, Paris brought this up and said she didn’t understand what I meant when I asked all those questions the prior week. She went home and thought about this for a long time and finally realized that I think she is a spy. She can now tell me affirmatively that she’s not a spy, and that I should not hope that this can somehow give me some advantage in the negotiation. I was a bit surprised by her response. Did she really have nothing to hide, or is this some kind of mind trick? Then I thought, what I stated couldn't be more obvious, does someone as intelligent as her really needed to think for a long time to figure out what I was getting at?

On March 19th, during the final negotiation, Paris finally relented a bit. She said she was willing to set aside six months' worth of money and put it in a trust for our daughter. I was already very tired and felt that we are unlikely to yield much more by continuing this negotiation. I obviously also didn’t trust her, and didn’t know if she’s playing some kind of tricks again. I asked Paris to have her lawyer send us a formal proposal in writing.

# New Lawyer

On March 25th, we received the first letter from Paris's new lawyer, informing us that Paris had officially changed lawyers on March 22nd, from The Zhou Law Group to Candelaria LLP. From this point forward, I am referring to Candelaria LLP whenever I mention Paris’s lawyer.

On April 1st, Paris's lawyer sent us their settlement offer. The offer for the most part matched what Paris said in our negotiations, but there were a few changes. The two biggest changes were: (1) Paris originally said we will divide assets from April 2018 to March 2021, or 3 years. In the offer, it was 3 years and 1 month, and the date range was shifted back by a couple months. The stock price of my employer increased substantially during the pandemic, so my 2021 income was a lot higher than my 2018 income. This change in dates will allow Paris to get quite a bit more money. (2) The offer didn't say anything about setting up a trust for our daughter.

At the end of the letter, Paris's lawyer stated that nullity is difficult to obtain and the evidence we have is not strong enough to demonstrate fraud, so we are unlikely to win. She advised us to accept their offer, which would be good for both parties. This is actually what my lawyer has been saying as well. She repeatedly told me that annulment lawsuits are very difficult to win and told me not to get my hopes up. But what other options do I have?

When we first considered annulment in 2023, my lawyer provided three cases similar to my situation and successfully obtained annulment:

1. [Schaub v. Schaub](https://law.justia.com/cases/california/court-of-appeal/2d/71/467.html). In this case, the wife continued to have a sexual relationship with another man after marriage. I felt this case was the most similar to mine. The difference is that Schaub's marriage lasted only two years, and the wife was caught in the act in her paramour’s home. When she was caught, she even admitted that she married for money.
2. [Handley v. Handley](https://law.justia.com/cases/california/court-of-appeal/2d/179/742.html). In this case, the wife would not live with the husband after they were married. Similar to my case, Paris also hardly lived with me during the marriage. What’s different is that the Handleys didn’t live together at all, but Paris did live with me for about a year and half. Also, there isn’t a paramour in the Handley case.
3. [Marriage of Liu](https://law.justia.com/cases/california/court-of-appeal/3d/197/143.html). This is a case where the wife married for green card. Similar to my case, Paris also got a green card from the marriage. What’s different is that Liu’s marriage only lasted a few months, and the wife refused to have sex with the husband.

My lawyer also felt that Schaub's case was most similar to ours, so the key is Sharik. However, we need to prove intent not to terminate the sexual relationship. The keyword is **intent**, meaning it has to be **premeditated** before the marriage. Otherwise, we can only say Paris committed adultery, and adultery is not illegal. But proving premeditation is virtually impossible! We need either Paris or Sharik to admit this themselves, which was what happened in the Schaub’s case. We know that’s not going to happen. Alternatively, we need to find some writing between them where they discussed their plans or intentions. This is why in our discovery request, we asked Paris to provide all emails, texts, and any communication between her and Sharik from 2012 to 2016.

Another major difference between my case and the three cases above is that Paris and I have a child together. Even though Paris clearly does not care for the child and has never taken care of her.

After receiving the offer from the opposing lawyer, I asked Paris why the offer didn’t match what she said during our negotiations. Paris initially said there were some miscommunications between her and her lawyer, but those were minor issues and she will ask her lawyer to fix it. That never happened. A few weeks later, Paris said her lawyer refused to make the changes and there’s nothing she could do.

My lawyer suggested that we continue to apply pressure while negotiating. On April 11, my lawyer informed Paris's lawyer that we plan to depose Paris, Sharik, and Ms. Huang in early May. At the same time, my lawyer again asked Paris's lawyer to provide Sharik's address.

On April 15, my lawyer called Sharik using the number on the Chick-fil-A cup, and to our surprise Sharik actually answered. Sharik agreed to the deposition and gave us his email. In hindsight, I feel that calling Sharik was a mistake. The reason we asked for Sharik’s address was so we could serve him with the deposition subpoena. It’s obvious that for whatever reason Paris cannot give us Sharik’s address. Now that we got a hold of Sharik, we lost our justification for needing Sharik’s address, hence we can no longer pressure Paris via asking for Sharik’s address. I think Sharik likely realized this as well, and that’s why he answered my lawyer’s call. 

Also on April 15th, my lawyer sent a letter to Paris’s lawyer, again pointing out many of the issues in their latest discovery response, and asked them to respond again.

On April 22nd, Paris's lawyer responded to our discovery for the fourth time. The main differences between the third and fourth attempts were:

1. Paris finally provided Sharik's address, it is house B. But didn't the person living there say Sharik is no longer living there when we attempted to serve him in November 2023?
2. Paris provided the full addresses that she lived in in Richmond and Longmont, it is Sharik’s address. However, she still didn’t provide her Fremont address and Shanghai address.
3. Paris said she and Sharik broke up in 2010 and didn't get back together prior to our marriage in 2014. To show that they really broke up, she even provided some emails between them from 2010.
4. Paris again stated that she only had sex with Sharik between March 2021 and October 2021, and not any other time. This is obviously a lie. Where did the child in her 2022 pregnancy come from?
5. Paris still would not provide emails, texts, or any other information related to Sharik from 2012 to 2016. Paris still kept the emails between her and Sharik from 2010, but she doesn’t have anything from 2012 to 2016. Who’s going to believe that?

On April 29th, my lawyer called Ms. Huang. Ms. Huang said she seldom talked to Paris. She knew that Paris and I were married, but nothing else pertaining to our marriage. As for Sharik, she hasn't talked to him in years, and she didn’t know anything regarding his relationship with Paris. Given that Ms. Huang knew little about Paris and Sharik, my lawyer decided to cancel the deposition. It's worth noting that during the marriage, Paris claimed she frequently visited Ms. Huang. In 2021 and 2022, she also used hanging out with her high school friends as an excuse to not visit our daughter in Sacramento. So those were also lies.

On May 7th, Sharik emailed my lawyer saying he was really busy and asked to postpone the deposition, and he requested a translator for the deposition. So Sharik can’t speak English even though he has lived in the United States for 9 years and has a doctorate degree from an American university? I can feel that Paris and Sharik don't want to have this deposition, they're coming up with excuses to delay the process. I'm all but certain Sharik has some serious issues that he is trying to cover up. If true, then his testimony could be used against him at a later time, because everything he says will be recorded and archived by the court. But my lawyer also advises against actually conducting the deposition. We need to prove premeditation, which is something we know they won’t admit. Essentially we need them to make mistakes, and that’s not realistic given how good of a liar they are. My lawyer was worried that if we don’t get any useful information out of the deposition, and most likely we won’t, then the opposing party might pull their settlement offer.

During this time, our lawyers continued to negotiate the settlement. My lawyer said the opposing lawyer was extremely tough and uncompromising, refusing to budge or move the three-year window back to what Paris originally proposed. The annulment trial was scheduled for early June, so if we want to settle, we have to do it before the trial. My lawyer suggested moving the trial back a couple months to give us more time to negotiate, which they also rejected, saying we either get this done now or go to trial. In the end, my lawyer suggested that I accept their offer. She reiterated that our chances of winning the case were slim, and if we lose, then there’s no way they will still settle. In that scenario, I would have to give Paris half of my assets and 4.5 years of spousal support.

On May 15th, we had a four-way conference via Zoom for the final negotiation. The way it works is that both sides had a virtual meeting room, and the lawyers had a room for negotiation. What happened was that the lawyers would negotiate in their room, then come back to the meeting room to go over the terms with the clients to see if we agree or not. We went back and forth for a few rounds, and it took almost two hours. In the end, we got the terms of the settlement completed.

The result was pretty much the same as their offer, except we were able to get Paris to agree that a portion of the money will be set aside in a 529 account for our daughter, but I had to match whatever she put in. Another difference was that Paris wanted to keep the final settlement simple. Essentially, she just wanted numbers, but doesn’t want the agreement to state how we arrived at those numbers. For my RSU and 401k, it will be divided based on the 3 year and 1 month window that they proposed, but we need a CPA to compute the actual amount. Most of the negotiation was focused on cash, house, and alimony. For the house, I need to buy out her half. Alimony is one year, and we bought it out with a lump-sum payment, obviously it’s a smaller amount compared to paying over 12 months. Adding up everything, we agreed to a final figure of XXX thousand dollars.

On May 20th, both parties signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU), effectively putting down the result of the negotiation in writing. At the same time, we also dropped the annulment case, bringing this back to a regular divorce case.

I was actually sick on the day of the four-way conference – I had a fever and headache, but I still had to participate. During the negotiation, I felt that there’s something not right with that final number we produced, but I was under distress and having a headache, so I couldn't quite figure out what was wrong on the spot. A few days later, I found out what was wrong. First, a large portion of the down payment and remodeling of the house were money that I made before the 3 year window, but the house was split 50-50. Second, the majority of my existing cash came from selling stocks, with most of those stocks also purchased using money I made before 2018, and the cash was also split close to 50-50. I asked my lawyer if we can fix this, but she said we already signed the MOU, so we can’t backtrack anymore. In addition, the MOU only contained the final amount that I need to pay Paris, it didn’t state how we arrived at that number, so we can’t argue that there was a mistake. Also, we all saw how hard-lined the opposing party was, so there’s no way that they would agree to lower the number. She also said that the current agreement is already very good compared to giving Paris half of my assets. She advised me to look at the big picture and not get hung up on the details.

In early June, the CPA calculated how much of my RSU I needed to give to Paris. The number was almost twice what I estimated. Why is there such a large difference? It turns out that it’s because of the “Nelson Formula” that has to be used for RSU calculations in California. Using a simple example to illustrate, let's say A had a four-year RSU grant, then A and B divorced after the grant was vested for two years. I thought that the vested shares in the first two years would be split 50-50 between A and B, but A would get to keep all the shares vested in years three and four. So in the end, the grant would be split 75-25 between A and B. However, using the Nelson Formula, it is true that the shares vested in the first two years are split 50-50, but B also gets a portion of the shares vested in the next two years, starting at close to 50% at the beginning of year three, down to 25% at the end of year four. So in the end, A would get 58% of the shares and B gets 42% of the shares. Just who came up with such a complicated and illogical formula? Other than my initial RSU grant, I received about 10 other smaller grants during the three-year window via refreshers, promotions, and bonuses, each with a different vesting schedule, and all of them must be divided using the Nelson Formula. This means some of my unvested shares today still belong to Paris, even though it is now 2024, almost 3 years past the three-year window. This is completely absurd! Not to mention expensive, the CPA fee for computing this was almost $30,000.

I repeatedly asked my lawyer and the CPA why we have to use this nonsensical formula. My lawyer would not comment on this, other than saying this is what the law required. The CPA was a little more sympathetic, he said he too feels this formula is unfair, even for normal marriages, and for me it’s just adding insult to injury. But there’s nothing he could do, because he had to compute according to what the law says. He even mentioned that there was a recent ruling (I don’t know which case) that reiterated that the Nelson Formula must be used for RSU calculation.

1o5wa8d,https://www.reddit.com/r/UniversalOrlando/comments/1o5wa8d/were_back_heres_our_full_trip_praises_and/,We're back! Here's our full trip praises and complaints: all parks included!,"I'm home and I'm in bed sick, so you guys get the full rundown! Hopefully it's readable and not too long.  
We had a group of 5, ages 9-38, one day in each VB, US, IOA, plus two days Epic!   
We stayed at Sapphire Falls for 7 nights, so we had one pool/resort day.  
I'm a wheelchair user but I can walk, and my son needs AAP. (This becomes relevant)

Here are our (often unexpected!) praises and complaints for each area:

Sapphire Falls complaints:  
\-Customer service people seemed disorganized- for example, they called and woke me at 6:09am for a 7:30am bell service request. Housekeeping was also randomly timed or nonexistent.   
\-Pool rules wouldn't allow our small foam ball, and pool was pretty dirty.  
\-Breakfast food, pastries, fries, and coffee just weren't good. None of it tasted fresh even if it was fresh.  
\-There's no real quick service option. New Dutch is more like a convenience store.  
\-It's difficult to know where things are, study a map online or something!

Sapphire Falls praises:  
\-Beautiful resort. Always felt a bit ""rich"", especially because we got a $175 avg room rate by booking early!  
\-Dinner at Amatista, Strongwater, and room service were fantastic, fancy, and flavorful, and service didn't suck!   
\-BOAT! We loved the boat and the convenience of our very own security check-in! NO issues with getting a wheelchair on and off with a simple and quick ramp.

Volcano Bay complaints:  
\-Stairs and rough concrete result in ruined feet, even for those of us who had water shoes.  
\-Be prepared to deal with unruly kids who have awful parents. There were many. I witnessed a fight with a mom and a lifeguard and I'm shocked they didn't throw her out.  
\-Staff is READY to close and some were walking out at 4:30, when closing is noted as 5. Almost didn't get our ice cream at 4:35. 

Volcano Bay praises:  
\-The Runnamukka Reef playground is huge and FUN. Far better than anywhere similar that we've visited!  
\-My family praised the variety of waterslides, and were amazed at the aquacoaster!  
\-The volcano is an incredible backdrop that truly transports you into a relaxing getaway.  
\-Wait times were low or nonexistent (October!) even without Tapu.  
\-It may still be unlisted online, but there \*is\* an AAP option here now, it's brand new since Tapu ended, so check with guest services on your way in!!  
  
Universal Studios complaints:  
\-Jimmy Fallon isn't fun.  
\-Minion Cafe staff were so disinterested and unhelpful that it was bizarre.  
\-Harry Potter merch is definitely declining in variety.

Universal Studios praises:  
\-Minion Cafe food was pretty good. We loved the theming and desserts.  
\-Trollercoaster is fun if you're scared of real coasters! (just ignore my wimpy 9yo who cried) It's a little more intense than say, Barnstormer.  
\-Animal Actors show was very cute for animal lovers, with unexpected humor.  
\-Family highly recommends the Mummy!  
\-Villaincon is a walkon (literally) most of the time, so it's a great distraction for kids who can't do other things, but not for wheelchair users.

Islands of Adventure complaints:  
\-People dryer doesn't dry totally wet people. lol. (Popeye's level wet is WET)  
\-Too reliant on good weather. If it's rainy, cold, stormy- there's simply not enough to do. 

Islands of Adventure praises:  
\-The castle and Hagrid never disappoint.  
\-Superhero meets are all awesome. Spiderman answered my son's question about reproduction!  
\-Spiderman ride got us wet, but then warmed us right back up.  
\-Banana drink at Thunder Falls is yummy!

Epic Universe complaints:  
\-There's nothing really for younger kids to do in Dark Universe while waiting for Dad to get off the scary rides.  
\-Monsters Unchained has intense vibrations, a hard seatback, and slings you around, so I'm renaming it ""Headache Machine""!! It's incredible, but I'll never ride again. Do NOT ride if you can't support your neck perfectly or you get migraines. The warnings are VALID here.  
\-Berk had too many broken elements and missing characters.  
\-Pizza Moon was okay, but not as great at Youtube would imply.  
\-The one line for mobile-order pickup at SpitFyre was INSANE, so window ordering would have been faster.  
\-Atlantic was awful for the price. Our server smelled of perfume and smoke. Steak was overcooked twice. Pasta was bland. Plating and atmosphere were nice, but that's about it.

Epic Universe praises (the longest of them all!):  
\-Super Mario World gave us the best day of our lives. We were there most of Day One and were ALL grinning ear to ear all day long. It was cloudy, so we didn't get the heat people often complain of. We used the elevators a LOT with my wheelchair, but it almost became part of the fun! Powerup bands are shockingly worth every penny, I could've done coin blocks and games for 2 days! Whoever is complaining about MarioKart and Yoshi are wrong, lol! Toadstool Cafe is a bit chaotic but adorable and OMG the Peach cake will live in my dreams forever. Ok ok moving on...  
\-Family says Hiccups and Werewolf are very good, went twice, wanted to go again.  
\-Animatronics from dragons to deatheaters to big cat things were jaw-dropping impressive. Seriously, I think that has ruined every other park for me!  
\-Our second day, we went on Ministry twice (9:30am and 8pm) with AAP!! It was so strange. After our return time passed, we were directed through the Express line, and there was literally NO ONE in Express while the standby was 185min. Was it luck? Did people oppose the cost of Express? Idk, but AAP saved a difficult day caused by our medical needs. So use AAP if you need, or get Express if you can!

Overall it was a great trip, but one major complaint really threw me off: The hours of operation, especially for restaurants or characters, changes all the time! I planned this trip extensively to fit in everything we wanted- only to find that FOUR of the restaurants were closed when we went to the door. You can't even see these closures on the app. Finding character times is also way too difficult. Others have complained that the whole park closed early on them! I find this to be unacceptable given how much we pay, and how people plan these trips from far far away. I don't have these issues at Disney, so I really really wish Universal would fix this, then they can become my favorite ;)

I hope this novel is helpful to someone out there. Thanks to everyone who helped us in the planning stage!",11,1760389626.0,UniversalOrlando,3,0.87,False
1o5w9rp,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1o5w9rp/i_33m_need_advice_on_how_to_stop_people_from/,I (33M) need advice on how to stop people from trying to assert dominance on me,"# Overview

Most of the people in my life are very controlling. I've been setting strong boundaries and they tell me I am ""being difficult"". I'm just setting boundaries and telling them what I am willing to accept. This stemmed from my childhood where my mom made her emotions my responsibility and infantilized me and was enmeshed with me. I am breaking these patterns and have been for the last year and a half.

## Current Situations

- My friend Maria believes every decision I make has to be filtered through her. Otherwise I am hiding things from her.
- I pushed back on Maria and told her I make my own decisions and she does not get a say in them. She told me I am ""Being difficult"" and she ""Can't take this anymore.""
- Maria needs complete control over every decision that the friend group makes. She refuses to accept ""no"". You can't even offer her a spoon to stir her coffee because that would mean she has ""given up control"" over something. She will say no.
- Derek is another friend who believes he can tell me what to do. He was demanding that I do something and I told him I will do it when I feel it is the right time. He keeps bringing it up every time we are around Maria as some sort of power play/dominance. I told him the more he brings it up the less likely I am to do it. He proceeds to call me a ""little b*tch"". I told him if he continues calling me that, I am leaving.
- Maria convinced Derek that I am being difficult and Derek told me to ""Just do what Maria wants and stop being so difficult. She wants you to stop and just do what she says""
- Steve is Maria's husband and he continues to tell me he is the ""alpha male"". He writes my suggestions off most of the time and then tries to assert his ideas.
- Steve is controlled by Maria and he does whatever Maria wants at any time because it is his wife.
- Maria has sabotaged my social gatherings by shutting down, not speaking to me, and making the night awkward. She couldn't control the night so she found a way to ruin it.
- Maria tries to set rules with me. She said I am only allowed to talk about ideas I have for my house for ""3 weeks"" before it becomes unacceptable to talk about it any longer if no action is taken. 
- Maria gossips. Anything you tell her, she will tell to all of her friends and even people who are just random acquaintances. She feels she is entitled to overstep any boundaries.
- Maria ""pays for group outings with her credit card."" She instantly demands a Venmo. It turns out she is doing this to get more credit card points. I called her out on this and she got pissed.
- Maria watched our neighbor's dog and she proceeded to go through their bedrooms and upstairs area and look around. This is wrong on so many levels and intrusive.
- Maria demands that everyone in the friend group shares their iPhone locations with her. If someone stops sharing, she gets grumpy and accuses them of being unfair. Maria has even tried to get into our phones to change the setting and reshare the locations with her.
- Maria was shown one thing on Derek's phone and she proceeded to start scrolling through all of his text messages and read them. Derek got pissed (rightfully so).

## Advice

- Am I being crazy thinking that these behaviors are not controlling and demeaning?
- I'm going to continue to set boundaries. At what point is me setting boundaries and pissing them off too much? I don't believe there is a limit.
- How do I find friendships that are not this controlling? Is this all normal?

She’d let her dog bark incessently for hours outside when I’d be working (she doesnt) and I’d get so frustrated because I’d be on calls or having dinner and then my dog would start going off, I’d open my window and yell once or twice. It got better for a while, my dog passed away so it just sort of tapered off. 

We both have 2 year old boys and live right next door so we started becoming more friendly, have playdates now and then, invite to each others birthdays etc. She told me about the preschool her boys love and I signed my son up for part time as well. Great. 

We all get buddies when we join the school just to have someone to ask questions to or whatever.
Mine texted me, we went back and forth for a while getting to know each other, she asked if I wanted to grab coffee sometime and I had to decline for other obligations but offered a different day. She didnt get back to me, we went back and forth a little and I just said my schedule was busy but I’d let her know. No worries no issues.

Well my neighbor for some dumb reason took it upon herself to make it her problem and texted me randomly that my buddy told her I wasnt responding back to her about getting together and she had reached out a few times. I responded a day later that I had been very sick but I had responded to this buddy and thanks for the thought. 

Since then this neighbor had been up my ass. She literally walked with her son through my yard (unfenced) and up my driveway randomly (we hadnt known until after she was gone as we were inside then saw the Ring notifications). Then we were walking and stopped at an estate sale a few streets down, and she pops up out of nowhere with her son and starts talking to me like we are besties. She asked how I was feeling then randomly cuts me off to ask if I was pregnant. I am and I said this to her as I was surprised, but said its very early and not a lot of people know yet. I’m mad she asked me straight up and caught me off guard and thought its a strange thing to do. She also asked if I was going to an event the school was hosting and I said I couldnt, to which she said I had to and she would come over and drag me out of my house to go and I had to find a babysitter.

Now I see our other neighbor friend is outside her house for a playdate and I’m nervous shes telling her I’m pregnant. I met with our mutual friend the other day and should have told her but I really wanted to wait for my first scan to tell her because I’ve just been feeling anxious this entire pregnancy in general so I’m mad to begin with that the neighbor I dont like knows and might spill the beans, and my actual friend will find out from someone other than me. 

How do I go about this with this neighbor thats causing me all this stress?

1o5w0ov,https://www.reddit.com/r/SIBO/comments/1o5w0ov/found_the_root_cause_gallbladder_and_got_90/,Found the root cause (gallbladder) and got 90% improvement,"TL;DR at the end of the post.

Hi! A while ago I made a post about the probable cause of my IBS-D: [https://www.reddit.com/r/SIBO/comments/1lbzzmr/80\_of\_my\_ibsd\_was\_fat\_malabsorption\_and\_now\_i/](https://www.reddit.com/r/SIBO/comments/1lbzzmr/80_of_my_ibsd_was_fat_malabsorption_and_now_i/)

After it, I visited my GI doc and she confirmed that the reason was in my gallbladder. I have a sludge (pre-stone stage) and my bile is thick. It seems that it becomes thicker somehow or maybe I generally have thick bile because my mom  has gallstones.

It affects fat digestion so after the foods that contain fat I got all the symptoms. It explains why I couldn't find consistent triggers and thought it was onion/garlic/etc – it was enough to add some olive oil to my salad to trigger symptoms or eat something that is not a chicken breast lol.

Also it's very important that I showed my ultrasound image to the GI doctor and didn't listen to an ultrasound specialist because the latter said it was totally ok and literally missed a sludge that took almost half of my gallbladder!

My GI taught me to read the ultrasound images myself. Now I will check it once a year to prevent stone development.

So now I take Creon with foods that contain more fat that I can digest myself (I experiment but honestly I eat CHIPS with it and don't have issues after) and take UDCA to dissolve the sludge (it was prescribed by my doc so check with yours first please).

I have bloating though and I suspect MCAS/Histamine intolerance because I have other symptoms (rushes, hives, heat waves, headaches, exhaustion) when I eat histamine liberators. And since I had chocolate/orange allergy since my childhood, I think this is something I live with and that turns worse when I stress which was my life last 4 years.

So now I eat onions, garlic, fructose without issues. Polyols were my trigger long before SIBO so I eat them in moderate amounts (i.e. I can drink packaged apple juice without issues or eat 5-7 blackberries, all contain sorbitol). Dairy wasn't an issue but I switched my regular milk to an oat one. I even can drink coffee 2-3 times a day without an issue now!!! I never thought I would be able to!

I try to avoid high histamine foods like soy sauce, chocolate, citrus, mustard, tomatoes, processed meat, leftovers and it also helped me tremendously. Like when I started Creon it helped but I still had issues sometimes (more gas and discomfort, some pain but no diarrhea now), and when I cut out chocolate and soy sauce that I ate almost daily then, my condition improved tremendously.

I still eat them here and there and experiment with the amount but with MCAS, most symptoms are not GI related now. Like yesterday I ate chips, bretzels, raffaello, grapes and even drank sparkling wine at a party and I felt good today, just a bit gassy like a usual healthy person would be after all this.

Also important to note that I took Rifaximin a year ago and I think it cleared SIBO that time but since my bile flow was wrecked, I haven't noticed the improvement.

TL;DR:

\- a course of Rifaximin in Aug 2024 cleared SIBO,

\- a sludge in my gallbladder caused IBS-D after it,

\- Creon helps with digesting fats and UDCA helps with dissolving thick bile,

\- another issue is my MCAS/hypermobility that I live with so I explore my histamine triggers.

Hope this helps somebody! Check your gallbladder and histamine sensitivity if you're confused about your root cause and double check it with a good doctor.",3,1760389043.0,SIBO,1,1.0,False

1o5vzip,https://www.reddit.com/r/AlchemyBeauty/comments/1o5vzip/explore_the_best_wood_polish_miraclewipes_review/,Explore the Best Wood Polish MiracleWipes Review Worth Trying?,"**Testing the MiracleWipes LR01NB: A Homeowner’s Perspective**

I’ve tried my fair share of cleaning products over the years, but I’ll admit I was a little skeptical about MiracleWipes LR01NB. Wood surfaces are tricky—you want something that cleans effectively but doesn’t damage the finish or leave behind an overpowering scent. After using these wood-cleaning wipes for about three weeks, I’ve got plenty to say, both good and not-so-good. Whether it was the dining table smeared with sticky toddler fingerprints or kitchen cabinets dulled by grease buildup, these cleaning wipes saw some serious action in my home.

**The Design and Convenience of the Product**

The cylindrical packaging fits nicely in my cleaning cabinet, which is already packed with supplies. A pull-through dispenser makes it easy to grab a wipe even when one hand is occupied corralling a running child or steadying an unstable chair. The wipes themselves are a decent size—not so huge that you feel wasteful, but big enough to cover substantial surfaces like my coffee table or larger cabinet fronts. The way you can reseal the container keeps the wipes moist for longer, which is a problem I’ve run into with other brands.

**Amazing Cleaning and Polishing Results**

Cleaning abilities were what really mattered to me, and this product didn’t disappoint in most instances. With grime-streaked wood furniture as my test case, I immediately noticed how effectively it worked to cut through dirt and greasy fingerprints. My oak desk looked incredible after just one wipe session—it had a shine to it, but it wasn’t the fake, overly glossy shine you sometimes get. Instead, the finish looked rich and healthy, thanks to the pH-balanced formula that MiracleWipes uses. These wipes handled scratches and scuffs beautifully, reducing their appearance significantly, which surprised me. 

[Check MiracleWipes LR01NB price on Amazon.](https://stylistexperts.com/p/b07s37xv62/)

**Environmental and Safety Dynamics**

Knowing this is a phosphate-free formula made me feel better about frequent use. I’ve got pets, kids, and plenty of floor space, so the harsh chemical smells you sometimes get from other cleaning products are a hard no for me. These wipes smelled pleasant but light, and they didn’t seem to irritate my skin when I accidentally wiped some of the solution on my hand. The safety angle alone is worth noting, particularly if, like me, you occasionally find yourself barefoot and stepping on floors freshly cleaned with these wipes.

**Upsides**

- The pre-moistened wipes save time—no need to prep cleaning solution.
- Safe to use on various woods like cherry, oak, and even laminate surfaces.
- Leaves behind a natural, well-balanced shine without being overly tacky.
- Thick and durable material ensures each wipe cleans a lot before drying out.

**Shortcomings**

- You’ll need several wipes for larger surfaces, making it less economical for big projects.
- Packaging doesn’t have a transparent part to track how many wipes remain.
- Leaves a slight residue on certain darker woods if you don’t buff it off quickly.

**Target Audience: Who Will Love these Wipes?**

If you’re a parent or pet owner dealing with constant messes on wood surfaces like cabinets and tables, these are fantastic. They’re also ideal for anyone looking to maintain the natural beauty of high-quality wood furniture and avoid using stronger, more abrasive chemical cleaners.

**Product Competitors**

Compared to other options like Pledge Multi-Surface Cleaner Wipes or Weiman Wood Cleaner Spray, MiracleWipes stands out in a few key ways. These wipes are easier to use than the spray since you don’t need additional tools like microfiber cloths. In terms of polishing power, they’re neck-and-neck with Pledge but offer a safer formula for frequent use. However, Pledge has an edge in providing a more polished shine, especially for darker woods. Meanwhile, brands like Weiman are better suited for deep restorative work but lack the convenience factor of pre-moistened wipes ready to go.

**Bang for the Buck**

Cost can be a tricky aspect to evaluate for disposable cleaning products. These wipes, while convenient and effective, might not stretch as far if you’re looking to clean an entire home filled with wood surfaces. They shine (pun intended) in smaller-scale cleaning scenarios—think of them as a quick fix for a well-loved bookshelf or a messy wooden breakfast bar. Assessing their usefulness against competitors, I’d say they hit a sweet spot for moderate to heavy cleaning in households prioritizing convenience and safety.

I honestly don’t even know what we are anymore, but it’s been messy.

When we first met, he was kinda talking to me and another girl from our friend group. Eventually that stopped and we got closer. I study at a uni where he works in a coffee shop, so we saw each other basically every day.

A bit later I went back to my home country for a few days. When I came back, I found out he hooked up with someone else. When I asked, he straight up said “yeah, it happened, but we weren’t together.” Which, yeah, he’s right. But it still hurt.

I ended up posting a random picture from Pinterest that looked like I was on a date just to mess with him a little. He got super mad, I told him it wasn’t real, and we kinda moved past it.

Then some time later he was flirting with another girl literally right next to me, so I got up and followed another guy on Instagram. Petty, I know. He got mad again, and I told him “well, I’m just doing what you’re doing.”

After that I basically started living at his place. I cooked for him, cleaned, took care of him, all that. We spent almost every day together for like 3 months. It felt like we were dating, even though we never made it official.

Now that I’ve graduated and left, he’s saying again that “we’re nothing serious.” But he also promised he wouldn’t sleep with or kiss anyone else. Now I found out he’s been talking to some girl who already has a boyfriend, and it’s bothering me a lot.

He’s also always been jealous of my guy friends, even though I’ve told him a hundred times they’re just friends. But when I say something about him talking to other girls, suddenly I’m the crazy one.

So yeah. AITA for being upset and feeling hurt even though we’re technically not together?",3,1760388922.0,AmIOverreacting,5,0.8,False

1o5vyc1,https://www.reddit.com/r/mormon/comments/1o5vyc1/what_makes_hot_drinks_hot/,"What makes ""Hot Drinks"" hot?","There seems to be some confusion on the topic, at least on the part of the faithful, so here's my understanding for anyone who is interested:

1)  In the early church (1834-1860s), coffee and tea were the main culprits, but hot water was put in the same category.  Evidently the vapors were thought to be harmful.  In addition, there was an idea that if you had hot liquids in your stomach that it would stop digestion and that food could spoil in your stomach essentially leading the human to rot as well.  Quote #1 from Hyrum Smith (1842): 

>And again “hot drinks are not for the body, or belly;” there are many who wonder what this can mean; whether it refers to tea, or coffee, or not. I say **it does refer to tea, and coffee**. Why is it that we are frequently so dull and languid? it is because **we break the word of wisdom, disease preys upon our system**, our understandings are darkened, and we do not comprehend the things of God; the devil takes advantage of us, and we fall into temptation.

2)  Deseret News 1851-01-25, Page 4 explaining the dangers of hot water:  
>**Pure HOT WATER** is the simplest hot drink with which we are acquainted; but even this, when drank to the extent which most people take of some kind of liquid, with their food, will relax, weaken, and enervate, all the organs of the stomach and prevent or hinder the digestive powers in their necessary operations, both in preparing the food to nourish, and absorbing the nourishment from the food after it is thus prepared...""  

(the article concludes that hot water is the culprit, not necessarily Coffee or Tea).

3)  - Apostle George Q. Canon, 1868 General Conference.
>""We are told, and very plainly too, that **hot drinks—tea, coffee, chocolate, cocoa and all drinks of this kind are not good for man.**""   

Also in that conference:  
>""We must not permit [our children] to drink liquor or **hot drinks, or hot soups** or to use tobacco or other articles that are injurious."" (cited in Journal of Discourses v12 p223).

By early 1900, science is progressing.  Caffeine is identified and is made the culprit.  From the Improvement Era (1918) talking about cola drinks:  

>For the Latter-day Saints who believe that tea and coffee are detrimental, there can be but one attitude toward to use of Coca-Cola, for, according to the testimony of the company itself, its action is precisely similar of that of tea and coffee.

>… the caffeine content of a glass of coca-cola is just about equal to that contained in a cup of tea or coffee…  According to the belief of certain noted scientists, caffeine, when artificially added is much more harmful than when naturally present….

>“…If you extract the caffeine and mix it with syrup, and flavor it, you can drink six or eight glasses of it, and there is no warning from your stomach, and you become a nervous wreck.”

In other words:  Coffee and Tea are the hot drinks.  We know they are bad, and now we know the reason why they are bad (caffeine).  Because of that, we think that cola drinks are every bit as bad.  This attitude continued into the 1960s and 1970s, to the point where when the caffeine was removed, the coffee became okay.

In 1965 we have the famous [Letter signed by David O. McKay](https://www.reddit.com/r/exmormon/comments/11zkflf/first_presidency_says_decaf_coffee_doesnt_violate/#lightbox) that drinking decaffeinated coffee is not a justification for withholding a temple recommend.  If memory serves me right there was a similar communication around 1970 or 1972.

By 1980, decaffeinated coffee was again out.  Cola drinks were also out in the 1970s thanks to a few statements in General Conference by some 70s.  They referenced things going back to the 1940s, so evidently there were various periods that this was emphasized and discouraged between 1920 and 1980.

Post 1980:  Hot drinks includes Coffee, White, Black, and Green Tea.  Decaffeinated coffee is out.  Herbal teas are allowed.  In Japan, wheat tea (mugicha) is allowed but most other tea products are not.  By 1990 when I am in the MTC, caffeine is discouraged but at least one elder is getting deliveries of Mountain Dew and he's not disciplined for it, so it's kind of okay???  After Romney OKs it it seems like mainstream members become okay with the practice by 2010.  I have to say, would have never dreamed about dating someone who was so unfaithful that they drank coke back in the 1990s...

So that's it.  Coffee and tea is where hot drinks are currently.  Having said that, my kids inform me that a number of teens are not keeping this commandment.  Jana Reiss' survey data seems to confirm that this is less of an orthodoxy marker than it was in the past.",21,1760388900.0,mormon,29,0.92,False

# Archivist and TikTok creator Rosie Grant traveled the U.S. collecting the details and stories behind over 40 gravestone recipes

[Kate Bradshaw](https://www.mercurynews.com/author/kate-bradshaw/)October 13, 2025 at 6:00 AM PDT

Annabell Gunderson was raised in Napa before moving with her family to Lake County to run a resort in the 1930s. She later settled in Willits, where she was highly involved in the community, and was known for her snickerdoodle cookies. (Courtesy of Jill Petracek)

Who’d have guessed that the place to find a killer spritz cookie recipe would be inside a cemetery?

But that’s just where Naomi Odessa Miller-Dawson’s cookie recipe lives, etched in stone at her final resting place at Brooklyn’s Green-Wood Cemetery.

When archivist Rosie Grant, who was was completing an internship at Congressional Cemetery in Washington, D.C., learned about this recipe on a gravestone back in 2021, she decided to bake the cookies and share a video of the experience on her TikTok account, u/ghostlyarchives. Comments poured in, and she learned that there were gravestone recipes scattered across the U.S.

So began her quest to cook the recipes and learn the stories of the people behind them — a project that eventually yielded an entire 40-recipe cookbook. Grant’s book is more than a cookbook copying over these recipes etched in stone, however. It also explores the intersections of food, legacy and memory, while providing background information and missing details to enable anyone to cook these recipes at home.

We recently caught up with her to learn more about her brand-new cookbook, “[To Die For: A Cookbook of Gravestone Recipes](https://www.harpercollins.com/products/to-die-for-rosie-grant?variant=43731712737314)” (Harvest, $26), which came out Oct. 7.

*Responses have been edited for length and clarity.*

**Q: What inspires someone to put a recipe on their gravestone?**

**A:** A lot of modern gravestones are very personalized. Maybe 200 years ago, or even 100 years ago, there would be one carver who would make a bunch of templated stones, and then just add someone’s name and dates. It was pretty standardized. Nowadays, it’s a blank slate that you get to fill in based on what was important to you. That might be a recipe, a music quote or even a call number to someone’s book in the library or a reference to their dogs. In a lot of cases shared in the book, these people were home cooks. They hosted the holidays. They loved food. There are a lot of central community figures, the ones who would do the volunteer event, host Christmas or Thanksgiving or make people’s special birthday treats. They used food to show love and celebrate other people.

**Q: Were most of the recipe gravestones you found modern?**

**A:** Pretty modern. The oldest one is from a gentleman, Joe Sheridan. He is attributed with inventing Irish coffee. The story goes that Joe was in Ireland, and this plane came in with a bunch of travelers. He was basically the airport chef, and it was raining. All the passengers were cold, and they asked Joe to make something to warm them up. So he made them his hangover cure, Irish coffee.

There was a travel and food writer named [Stan Delaplane](https://thebuenavista.com/mobile/story.html), who, when he went back to New York, wrote about the Irish coffee, and it became this whole thing. In San Francisco, the Buena Vista Cafe heard about it. They flew Joe to San Francisco, and he basically re-created it with the restaurant owner and with Stan. And now the Buena Vista is considered the birthplace of Irish coffee. He’s buried in Oakland, and his gravestone says he gave the gift to his world, his Irish coffee recipe. And so he doesn’t even have the recipe written on it, but I got permission from the Buena Vista Cafe to include it.

**Q: You went and visited all of these gravestones and interviewed family members. What were some of the things you learned while doing this research?**

**A:** The first recipe I just thought was a one-off. But it was during the pandemic, so I thought I would try to make it, because, why not?  So I cooked it, and I posted about the process, and things kind of exploded overnight. People were sending all these messages, asking lots of questions, thinking through what they would put on their gravestone if they had a recipe, or even talking about people in their lives who had passed away and the recipes that they cooked to remember them.

After I learned there were others, I made a big Google doc and map, and I started pinning where these folks are buried. I used Find a Grave, which is like the Wikipedia of gravestones and obituaries. The obituary listed out their next of kin, so from there, I would reach out to friends and family. I would send them a note. Sometimes I would just contact as many people as I could find. I would get email addresses that bounced, or in one case, I messaged this one woman on Facebook every six months for two years and later learned she’d been dead for four years.

The families have all been so lovely. It’s a fine tightrope to talk to people who have lost someone, and I wanted to be thoughtful about what they wanted. Some people just wanted to communicate via email or Instagram messenger because it hurt to talk about.

I also had to test the recipes. Usually, the first time, I would make it extremely wrong, reading it directly from the gravestone. And then I would do more research. I would meet with the families, and in some cases, cook with them. I would learn the tools that they would use.

**Q: Some of the recipes were incomplete?**

**A:** Yeah. I mean, an epitaph only has so much space. Most of these recipes are pretty simple. It’s not a lasagna or something that would take four gravestones to write out. But in some cases, the families got creative. So with Naomi, they didn’t put the instructions. They just put the ingredients to her spritz cookies. Another family had a handwritten recipe card lasered onto a woman’s gravestone, and they knew all the background details of how she would make her chicken soup. I, as a stranger, had to work with them to get the full recipe, and then that would be what ended up in the cookbook.

**Q: Is it usually the person who dies or the surviving relatives who decide on the gravestone recipe?**

**A:** It’s about half and half. In some cases, it was the relatives of the person who had passed away, trying to memorialize someone who was, in a lot of cases, larger than life and very giving. Sharing a recipe does more than just communicate, ‘She loved baking,’ or ‘She was a great host.’ It shares the tools for someone else to now partake in this tradition. It’s such an embodiment of who each of these people was.

Three of the recipes in the book are actually from women who are still alive. One is a woman named Peggy who lives in Arkansas. Her husband had passed away, and they were putting up their gravestone together, since they share a marker. On his side was his hobbies and things that he liked. Asking herself, ‘What do I want to be remembered for?’ for her side of the marker, she was like, ‘I’m really darn proud of my cookie recipe.’

When I met with her and cooked with her, all of these people showed up. I thought it would be for the novelty of some random TikToker making cookies. But they told me, ‘No, we heard Peggy’s making cookies. We drop everything when we know she’s making these cookies.’

In Ferndale, California, Christine and her husband are doing pre-planning and have already purchased and engraved their gravestones in a beautiful cemetery. His says, ‘I should have listened to my wife.’ And hers says, ‘Yeah, look where we ended up.’ Her carrot cake recipe is on the back.

**Q: How has this project changed how you reflect on death?**

**A:** My parents are both ghost tour guides. We talk about cemeteries all the time, and we love a good ghost story. But when it came to the actual death side of things, I hadn’t been aware of the death-positive movement, the idea that it’s healthy to talk about death, loss and our own mortality.

Where do you look for the people you’ve lost? There’s still so much of them with you, and it shows up in a lot of really joyful ways. For me, it’s been a very positive side to something that I personally found really scary.

**Q: Anything else?**

**A:** If anyone knows of any interesting gravestones, I’m always all ears.

However…his female best friend. They have been friends since they were neighbours five years ago. She has since moved a few minutes away and has split up with her partner. 

But…she always seems to be there, and above me. He recently set up details for POA and has named her as his person who can act as his power of attorney for both health and financial mandates. 

He had to have his dog put down- I offered to drop my children with a babysitter to go with him and be with him and his kids in the evening, and he ignored me. Then when I spoke to him that evening he had spent the day with her, she had gone with him to the vets and then they had all gone out for dinner. 

She regularly just pops round for coffee, whereas we only see each other on the weekends.

I’m 24 and just moved to Canada not long ago. I’ve always had these big, almost impossible dreams — the kind that make you believe life can be more than just surviving.
I’ve spent most of my life walking alone, trying to build everything on my own. Maybe it made me stronger, but lately, it just feels… heavy.

Some nights I walk through the city and see people laughing together — groups, couples, friends — and I wonder when I started getting used to watching life from a distance instead of being part of it.
It’s a strange feeling, being proud of your solitude but secretly wishing someone was walking beside you.

I’m not someone who always fits into the fast pace of life.
Sometimes I just want to sit by the beach, listen to music, and watch the night turn into morning.
I live fast when I’m inspired, slow when I need to breathe — and honestly, I often struggle to keep up with how the world moves.

I love filming vlogs — capturing honest moments, both beautiful and lonely ones.
Maybe it’s my way of keeping a connection with the world, even when I don’t have anyone around.
And I know there must be others out there like me — people who feel too much, dream too big, and just need someone who understands.

Because people like us — the sensitive, quiet ones — we carry a wish that feels impossible.
We want to connect, to talk, to belong… but we never make the first move.
We just sit there, hoping someone will notice.
So if you’re reading this and you feel the same — consider this your sign.
Someone like you finally made the first move.

Maybe we could start by just grabbing a coffee and getting to know each other —
and who knows, maybe one day we’ll look back and realize that the big friend groups we used to watch from afar… somehow, we became one of them. ☕🌤️

My first post here, so please do not judge me :) I’m a 34 y.o. guy, that looking for some friendship with a woman. I’m not an ugly gremlin which gets scared of girls and actually I’ve got a lot of friends, but I just can’t do dates or meet somebody new due to a tough schedule and working in a 99% male crew. That makes finding new connections a bit complicated for me nowadays, while I feel like I really need it now: I’m divorcing after a very very long marriage and missing talks with women tbh. I’m not a perv seeking for somebody to flood with dirty pics and share unwelcome fantasises. Im interested in a warm and cozy friendship, a lovely chatting, talks about common interests, watching movies, playing games together and so on.

Oh and if it matters I’m 182 cm (between 5’11” and 6’) and 75 kg (166 lbs), a former wrestler and a decent soccer player, still pretty fit, but NOT a crazy bodybuilder which only loves his own body lol.

Here are some things that I like:
Books, movies and TV shows, video games, music. I do also like walking around and hiking too (nowhere to hike in my current area though 🥲). I’m pretty handy and I like doing something in my home and garden by myself. I watch strategic games and chess broadcasts on Twich sometimes.

Favorite Music: Red Hot Chili Peppers, Muse, Norah Jones, Kendrick Lamar, Mac Miller, Led Zeppelin, Zucchero, Delvon Lamarr organ trio, The Cranberries, Sting, Django Reinhardt, Queen, Slipknot, NWA, Arctic Monkeys, Florence & The Machine and many many more.

Favorite directors and movies: most parts of Quentin Tarantino, Jim Jarmusch, The Cohen brothers, Wes Anderson movies;
Pulp Fiction, Reservoir dogs, Django unchained, Coffee and cigarettes, Forrest Gump, Cast away, Terminal, The Deer hunter, The Godfather, Goodfellas, Back to the future, Star Wars (1-6), Fight Club, The Matrix, Inception, The Green mile, The Green book, The Grand Budapest hotel, Dogville, The Wolf of Wall str… I can go on forever, just ask me about your favorite movies, I’m sure we’ll find a lot of common 😊 Oh and I do also love The Lord of the Rings movies and Harry Potter (especially 1-3).

Some favorite TV shows: Breaking Bad, Better Call Saul, the Sopranos, Scrubs, Shameless (the US version), Yellowstone, Misfits, Game of thrones (disappointed by its final but still a good one to watch), Californication, Twin Peaks…and Supernatural lol (1-5 season were best, but love it all anyway).

There might be a huge list of books here, but I read too many of them, so ask me better :) 

Games: The Elder Scrolls 3-5, Kingdom Come Deliverance, The Witcher series, Divinity Original Sin (Baldur’s gate 3 too but still didn’t walk it through), Star Wars Knights of the Old Republic, Mafia, SW Jedi Fallen Order, Red dead redemption 2, Sleeping dogs, God of war (2018 & Ragnarok), and much much more.

Online games: Age of Empires 2, GTA Online, PUBG, Forza Horizon 4-5, but I’m up to try anything else.

Well… There is a long read, but if you still here, you’ve noticed something nice in me or maybe some common interests. Please, feel free to send me a DM if so or I just wish you have a nice day and good luck if not… Stay safe and thanks for stopping by! 😊",1,1760388254.0,r4r,1,1.0,False
1o5vm6n,https://www.reddit.com/r/SalemMA/comments/1o5vm6n/thank_you_all_for_putting_up_with_us_i_had_a/,Thank you all for putting up with us! I had a lovely time!,"This year I decided to do some solo traveling. I have always wanted to visit Salem and Boston because I love American history. Ever since learning about the Salem witch trials in middle school I wanted to see the area. I hail from Northern Nevada around the Lake Tahoe/Reno area, so while we do get seasons, it isn't famed like the Northeast. 

Let me start of by saying, Salem is a beautiful town. The people are incredibly friendly, same for Boston. I was surprised by how hospitable everyone I interacted with was all throughout the region across the board. That really impressed me as someone from the Southwest, where people can be quite grouchy and rude, especially in places like Phoenix (where I lived recently for a while). I chalk that up to dealing with the near constant oven-like heat and vast urban sprawl. And while Reno is home for me, people here can be snippy, unfriendly, and unhelpful at times. It is just a totally different vibe. So I greatly appreciated how kind and understanding everyone I interacted with was! From shop keepers to police officers, tour guides and locals, I did not have a single negative interaction. It was so refreshing. 

I got into Boston/Logan late because of layover delays in Denver, and I used the Logan Express to get to my hotel in Danvers and went right to bed. My first and last day were fully for travel, actually! But I had 3 full days in the area to see the sights.

This is the list of things I did on my 3 days to Salem and Boston:

1. **The Witch Museum**. This was the perfect tourist trap. I got tickets the morning of (tickets go live at 10:00pm the night before). It was hokey, and the presentation seemed like it hadn't been updated since the 70s. But I enjoyed it, mostly because I intended to do all the tourist-y type of things. The staff was also knowledgeable and excited to answer questions.

2. **Tavern on the Green at the Hawthorn Hotel**. While I waited for my next activity, I popped over to the Tavern and had one of their cocktails and a cheeseboard/charcuterie. That cocktail had me on the floor (I got the Corpse Reviver if anyone is interested) and the food was excellent. Vibes were immaculate. 

3. **Chambers of Terror Vampire Ghost Adventure, walking tour**. I decided to book a walking tour for my first day so I could get the lay of the land and choose where to go and what to do from there. We met at the Nathaniel Hawthorn statue by the Hawthorn Hotel. The guide was dressed as a vampire, and he took us around to some famously ""haunted"" spots, telling us the history and lore about each ghost there. Again, this was very hokey and tourist-y, but I wanted that, and after having that really strong cocktail, this was a lot of fun. The tour ended at their physical location where the guide showed us haunted objects and detailed the stories about those. They have a haunted house there too, but I decided not to do that because it was getting late and I am old and tired.

4. **Salem Ink Tattoo and Art Gallery**. This was in the same building as the Chambers of Terror (not affiliated though) and I saw they had walk-ins while I was on my walking tour. Sure enough, they were able to see me right after my tour and I booked with Grace. She was super awesome and friendly and helped me choose the perfect design to commemorate my experience (Black Philip from Robert Eggers' 2015 movie *The Witch*). 

5. **Olde Main Street Pub**. Great place for fresh food and seasonal drinks. I got the Apple Spritzer and Fish & Chips platter. Very good. 

6. **The Witch House Salem - Corwin House**. Kicking off my second day, this attraction only releases tickets the morning of at 8:00am, so if you want to see it, you have to be ready to buy them right when they go live or you won't get a spot! But it was well worth it. I got in for the afternoon, and it was one of the highlights of my trip. There is a lot of information along with the displays and guides there to answer any questions. They let in groups every 15 minutes, but you are allowed to stay inside as long as you want. I had a very lovely chat with one of the guides sitting in the master bedroom. The house was well maintained and you got a really good sense of how things would have looked in the 1600s. This is definitely one of the best highlights of the trip.

7. **Ye Old Pepper Candy Companie**. After visiting MANY of the shops around town and walking by MANY of the historic houses and buildings, I popped in here and ended up with a load of candy, which will serve as my gifts to friends and family. Very high quality stuff. I got fudge and chocolates. The other candies on the floor looked somewhat generic, so I stuck with the individual pieces by the pound in the display cases. This place was packed with a line around the block, but I think it was worth it for the gift value. 

8. **Trade House**. This was a lovely pub-style joint with great food and excellent drinks. I had the Brew Steak and the Monkey's Paw cocktail. Very friendly service. 

9. **The House of the Seven Gables - Shadows of the Seven Gables tour**. Originally I had booked Haunted Fables at the Gables, but the actor suffered an injury and the performance was cancelled. The museum offered to change my reservation to this tour instead at no additional charge, and I am glad they did! The House of the Seven Gables is one of my favorite books, and this tour goes into how this real-life house inspired Hawthorn. He was born basically right next to this house, and his birth home is located on the same lot as the rest of the museum, house, and garden. Again, this was a great tour and I highly recommend seeing the House, either by purchasing a tour or a grounds pass. It was absolutely amazing. This was the ultimate highlight of my trip to Salem. 

10. **The Salem Ferry**. I decided for the third full day of my trip to head over to Boston via the ferry. I love being on the sea and taking ferries. The guide on the ferry was very funny and knowledgeable, detailing history about the lighthouse, water treatment plant, and Boston harbor. I got the round trip, so when I was done in Boston I caught the last ferry back to Salem.

11. **Old Town Trolly Tour (Boston)**. I hopped off the ferry and immediately got trolly tickets for the green line tour. You can use your ticket all day to hop on and off at any of the stops along the route, which is convenient for getting around to specific places on the tour route. I ended up sitting for the full 2 hour tour and then walked back to any spots I wanted to see again. This was probably my favorite part of the entire trip, just walking around Boston and taking lots of pictures of the historic buildings and statues. Taking the trolly tour gave me a really good idea of where I wanted to go on foot afterward. I found an open market on foot that I hadn't seen on the tour and got some clothes and handmade items there. I was content to walk myself around the city, see the parks, stop for coffee, and just absorb the sights. I wish I had stayed in Boston proper instead of Danvers, but I had no way of knowing that beforehand. I chose Danvers because of its relatively close proximity to Salem, as all of the things I booked in advance were in Salem and hotels prices were outrageous in Salem in October. Boston was amazing and I wish I had stayed more days to do more things in the city! 

Overall, Salem was such a lovely place, and I am so grateful for all the locals who work and live there and keep it a nice place. I thank you all for opening your city to us tourists and being patient with us! You live in a truly magical place and I definitely want to come back during a less busy season.

The pattern was always the same. Every time we fought, I’d try to calmly explain how I felt or talk things through, and he’d get defensive or twist it. Once he literally got mad that I “didn’t call him back” — even though I did — and then he was like, “It’s not even that. It’s something you said last week that “erked” me.” I never knew where I stood.

Whenever I tried to work on communication or emotions, he’d say, “Well, that’s just the way I am.” Meanwhile, I was always the one trying to grow, to listen, to fix things.

Then suddenly—gone. No talk, no closure, just blocked.

Wanted to see if I could get some feedback… I hadn’t planned on doing a marathon in 2025 (will be my first) but here we are. 

Current stats:
As of now- I am a 30-35 mile per week runner, 3-4x per week 7-13 miles per outing. This has progressively ramped up since July of 2024 (ran 1/2 mile @ 13 min pace). Following this schedule I am consistently posting 7:50-8:05 mile splits. I am in the south where it is STILL hot (afternoon runner, generally around 87-90 and sunny), and by November the weather should cool down a bit. I generally run fasted, coffee and H20 and then hit my run right after getting back from the office. Diet as a whole is fairly clean/fuel centric.

The past week I changed into more of a testing phase- I ran 18 miles, 16 at 8:15pace, and at miles 17 and 18 it felt like the sun was burning a hole through me, pace dropped, and I walked the final stretch (had hoped for 20 miles). 18 miles is the further I have ever run without any stopping (excluding 1 bathroom break ~3 min)

A few questions pertaining to my short timeline-
1) How would you structure the next 3+ weeks? I am thinking as a cold front hits this weekend I will go for 20 again and do better. Otherwise stick to what I’ve been doing? 

2) I won’t be shooting for a Boston qualifier time (yet😉) but I would like to break 3:30- as a first time marathoner is this realistic? I feel that the heat/sun have to be adding an element I won’t be facing come November.

Like many of you, I'm (30M) a long time sufferer of pelvic floor related issues. I'm coming up on 10 years dealing with mysterious urinary urgency and frequency, pelvic pain, constipation, and a handful of other annoying symptoms. For me, the biggest issues I have are at night. Some days I can have zero symptoms until I go to sleep. Then when I sleep, I will wake up with horrible urgency and pain that keeps me awake all night, and then I feel sore and tired the next day. This has been on and off for 10 years. In that time, I've graduated college, gotten married, had two kids, and dug deep into my career. However, I have had to create a ""forumula"" to keep me safe. No drinking, No coffee, limit acidic foods, eat well (but not too well, my body doesn't handle fiber that well), exercise regularly (but not too much, no HIIT), relax as often as I can (and when that doesn't work, MMJ).

The reason why I'm writing this is because I think I finally have hope. I have kept pushing on because there has to be a reason I have these symptoms. I have been with the same pelvic floor physical therapist for 5 years, and we've worked on an insane amount of things. She's the best, and I'm so grateful for the amount of my life she has helped me get back. However, it's never been a lock and key kind of fit. Pelvic floor physical therapy has only helped me so much.

For background, 10 years ago I, along many of you, started having symptoms and went to see a urologist. We tried antibiotics multiple times, bladder relaxants, cystoscopy, then eventually I got a CT Urogram. In that CT, they noticed I had distended veins in my pelvic floor. They told me I had Pelvic Congestion Syndrome and to go see a vein doctor. I saw a vein doctor and they basically laughed at me saying that I was not a woman, nor had I given birth, so therefore it was impossible for me to have pelvic congestion syndrome.

Okay, I trusted them, it wasn't pelvic congestion syndrome.

Next, I went to Mayo Clinic (Scottsdale, AZ), and started trying exotic therapies like botox, medicine cocktails, anismus therapy, and finally got a referral to pelvic floor therapy. Unfortunately, I graduated and moved to Virginia, and ended up finding a couple different therapists/doctors out there. I didn't live in Virginia long, but also managed to go see John's Hopkins to no avail as well. 

I finally settled in Colorado, where I found a urologist who wanted to give me the Interstim implant. For those of you who don't know, it's meant for nerve dysfunction, which is what everyone has been focusing on. I had been diagnosed with many terms up until this point: Pudendal Neuralgia, Dyssynergic Pelvic Floor, Pelvic Floor Dysfunction, Anismus, Paradoxical Puborectalis, Interstitial Cystitis, etc.

I got the interstim implant, and then when it wasn't working well (would flare me almost instantly anytime I turned it on), the urologist said I needed to calm down. I was frustrated, and eventually looked up a practice in Denver that is now closed called the Pelvic Solutions Center. The doctor here was amazing. She got me onto better medications that helped me manage things, and most importantly, sleep! However, she also thought my pain/urgency was nerve related so she convinced me to get the newer MRI-safe interstim implanted so that we can get an MRI of the nerves (MR-neurography). It took a bit, but finally went through with the surgery again, and got the MRI.

The MRI showed I had distended veins in my pelvis. She told me to go see a vein surgeon. I had pelvic congestion syndrome.

I went to go see this vein surgeon, and he had a host of information about pelvic congestion syndrome and how it affects males and females, and we ran an ultrasound up and down my abdomen, pelvis and legs looking for vein reflux (blood flowing the wrong way). He found a lot of it. I underwent my first pelvic vein embolization treatment in 2021. Then a second one in 2022. However, each time I would have maybe a little bit of symptom relief, but then the urgency and pain would come back. After he suggested having the procedure a third time, I decided to focus on my life for a bit. My first daughter was coming literally a month after my procedure, and I needed to mentally prepare for that.

These last three years have been beautiful, but hard. I still have my issues, only now I'm a father of two, and the sole bread-winner of my house. My wife is my support, but it's hard to lean on her now that she's a stay at home mom. I managed to survive for a couple years before deciding that I need to figure this out once and for all. There's a specialist vein clinic in CO called Minimally Invasive Procedure Specialists (MIPS), and they treat many vascular disorders. I'm convinced at this point that it can't just be nerve related because every exotic treatment for pudendal neuralgia failed me and made things worse.

I had my appointment with MIPS last month, and they told me I have May-Thurners Syndrome. Essentially, it's when your iliac vein in your pelvis gets compressed, usually by your right iliac artery. When this compression happens, your blood has to find other ways to get back to the heart, and usually this complicates the whole venous structure of your lower extremities causing vein dilation which leads to inflammation and pain. In my case the veins are so full that they press on nerves giving false signals, also they are distended and press onto my bladder and bowel giving me the sensation that I have to go when I don't.

The procedure is simple, it's the same as the pelvic vein embolization, where you are slightly conscious, they go in through your groin but instead of embolizing problem veins, they put a stent in your iliac vein to prevent it from being squished by whatever is squishing it. This will help the blood flow back through the vein which should immediately help pelvic congestion, leg restlessness/pain, POTS, and other symptoms related to blood flow. There's some risks to the procedure, but I really don't care at this point.

I've been told about every therapy in the book for my condition, but this is the first time in 10 years that I have felt confident about the methodology and the treatment. Everything we talked about during our appointment was not only validating, but reassuring that this isn't just in my head. I have been doing everything I can for a decade to manage this, and to try to feel better. Now I have an answer. I should be getting the procedure before the end of the year, and will hopefully be able to enter the next chapter of my life and stop having to fixate the majority of my time to symptom management.

For those of you who are still reading this and struggling, I see you. I have been where you are at for years, and I want you to know that you are not alone. If I beat this, my plan is to dedicate time to helping others beat theirs. I've done everything. Talked to everyone. Had every diagnostic test and procedure. Now I have hope. Someday, you will too.

1o5vfaa,https://www.reddit.com/r/SamAndColby/comments/1o5vfaa/the_night_we_summoned_the_devil_issomething/,"""The Night We Summoned The Devil"" is...something.","**I already made a post, but I have done more research and decided to rewrite it more clearly with a detailed explanation, also responding to some comments I received from people. This is to make others realise and understand that they should not believe everything shown in their videos.** 

To start this off, they also told the story of the Witch Trials a bit wrong, basically explaining that she started the witch trials, but she wasn't the only one, as many before her set it in motion to become a full-blown event. They claimed the dog had fiery eyes, which isn't true since she only mentioned it was a black dog. Plus, not everyone said they met a dog just like Alizon described, and only a few mentioned familiar ones, but not the exact one.

In correlation to that, I must also mention the fact that they kept referring to the woman as a witch, which is severely disrespectful to the victims in the modern world. None of the victims were proven to have ever done witchcraft, as it isn't as real as how courts treated them back in the 1600s; many were either vulnerable, poor or elderly, since it'd make them easier targets for accusations. Alizon was not truly a witch, just an 18-year-old (like in the scriptures) who was accused of being one, and she only confessed under the fear-induced pressure from the court. Many thought confessing would save their lives when it was, in fact, the opposite. The hellhound story was just one forced confession story; they were accused of other reasons, such as ""bewitching"" neighbours.

Now, let's continue onwards with their devil ritual. I've had someone tell me that the devil is only depicted as evil in Hollywood and that I am only explaining Hollywood Satan, which isn't true, even in folklore and religious backgrounds; the devil is portrayed as something with pure evil in its soul. The devil is known for deception, temptation, consequences, misfortune, evil, and danger, which is how it has always been depicted. No exceptions to that. The way this ""devil"" tried to make them believe that it ""isn't who we say it is"" and that it is ""helpful"" is a sign of deception, and they foolishly thought it. Well, that's only if it were true the ritual.

Satan/the Devil is considered a spiritual being, not an entity you can call up for a quiz on a Sunday morning and grab a coffee with. No historical rituals have ever summoned him, or if attempts were made, they never worked. We could see in the video that they included a cross in the middle, which was shaped like a cross. In Christianity, crosses ward off evil and doesn't invite it in. The setup looked like a fancy party instead of something that would bring in the most evil deity in the universe. The most well-known thing that would've been an actual attempt to summon it is the red pentagram or the satanic star, in better words. You wouldn't offer wine or your blessing for the devil to keep you safe since you'd instead just give the opposite to fit the devil's liking. In someone else's post, you could see in the candle that they took multiple takes for that one shot, meaning it is staged, and that the ""witch"" they hired was faking it since they didn't have these noise-cancelling headphones on to hear these words this ""devil"" was saying, truly.

I do respect Colby for going against the ritual for his faith, and that's the bravest thing to do; shame on those who think Sam was the bravest one for trying to summon the devil, as it is very tricky to go against your faith for some internet stunt. And if you disagree with all that I said, I ask you to tell me respectfully and not to outright bark at me for speaking my opinion. But, I will no longer support them due to their atrocious techniques.",5,1760387715.0,SamAndColby,2,0.86,False

1o5veaj,https://www.reddit.com/r/makemychoice/comments/1o5veaj/community_or_environment/,Community or environment?,"Hello! Apologies in advance for the rambling -I like to provide full context and often have thoughts out of order. A feeling has been tearing me up since I visited a place I’ve dreamed of seeing my whole life. 

Necessary background info: I moved from Nevada to Houston 5 years ago to be close to family and afford an apartment on my own, and to get into ranching (and I’m happy I did, but I grew to dislike the dystopian oil field traffic of houston.) So I moved to Austin two years ago after visiting on and off for the past 10 years. I felt it had an emphasis on green spaces and walkability compared to houston. I also enjoy the hills and rivers. 

I love it here! The country/blues/jazz/bluegrass music scene is great, the people are mostly genuine and neighborly, I love Texas in general and partially grew up here. I love proximity to family (I’m 25 and have a husband so kids will likely happen in the coming years.) 

But something is eating away at me. Because I grew up in the desert -I promised myself I’d live somewhere with lush green mountainous terrain, fog, next to a small old town with cozy coffee shops & libraries etc. Lots of camping and hiking and scenic campfires to be had. It has called out to my soul since I was little and is getting louder now. 

I visited Oregon a few months ago and couldn’t believe how beautiful it was and how the state seemed to emphasize caring for nature. The access to hundreds of safe and beautiful campsites blew my mind. 

Due to my work I have to live in some semblance of proximity to a city… so if I ever entertained a move to Oregon it would have to be the outskirts of Portland.

But that would mean leaving behind the lovely life my husband and I have built in austin -and more importantly missing out on years of time with our families (which you can’t get back.) He is the kind of guy who would move anywhere with me :) 

I enjoy texas for the people -I also have a ranching network here and the goal is to own horses and a few livestock animals later on. I love how personable, fun loving, and rugged texans are -I love the mixed politics and lack of judgement no matter if you’re right, left, or in the middle. I love the lack of rules and restrictions regarding both HOA and whatever you want to do in public -it feels like no one will karen out on you or bother you if you decide to film yourself in costume doing a stunt (not that I have lol.) 

I know nothing of the people near portland! My only impression is portlandia and it honestly seemed pretty accurate 😂 I don’t know if I could handle an unhealthy level of anarchist politics -and I’m not sure if it’s a good place to raise kids, or if the people are neighborly, or if the lack of sun is truly devastating. Maybe there’s another lush mountain nature-surrounded city to look at alongside portland. 

Also there is lots of opportunity for the work my husband and I do here in austin (creative work)

TLDR: I love Austin, my family is here, but my whole life I dream of the landscape Oregon (or similar) has. Do I chase a life living in my dream landscape or prioritize community and time with family. Do any of you have insights from choosing one or the other?

But outside of that, I’ve often found myself chatting with friends, solo founders, and small business owners about their struggles - usually over coffee or late-night texts about why things just aren’t clicking.

And honestly, the patterns are always the same.
People don’t fail because they lack drive.
They fail because the foundations aren’t clear.

They build before validating.
They try to market to “everyone.”
They skip figuring out why people actually buy what they’re selling.

I’ve been thinking about this for a while, and I finally decided to boil down everything I’ve learned into something simple, something that actually makes sense whether you’re just starting out or trying to fix what’s stuck.

It’s called The IDEA Loop Framework.

I’ve always struggled to make good coffee. I started about 6 years ago with the Breville espresso maker. After 3 months of bitter and sour cups, I sold it and went to a V60 and an encore grinder. I had decent results, but nothing great. My girlfriend at the time (now wife) got annoyed with the amount of time it took and got tired of me complaining so she got me a Nespresso for Christmas. I think it was ultimately for her, but it was a nice gesture. 

Eventually the cost of the pods got to me, so I picked up a breville precision brewer and the matching grinder. It made ok coffee. I could never dial it in and just ended up being happy with the results, but always wanted more out of it. 5 years later the heating element broke. We pulled out the old nespresso and that held us over for a while as I tried to figure out what I was doing next. I didn’t want to spend another $300 on a coffee maker for it to die. I was going to get a Mocha Master, but it’s not in the budget at the moment with everything else going on. 

So last night I saw the Aeropress on Amazon. I always wanted to try it but never felt like dealing with it. My wife rolled her eyes and said “oh great, another gadget”. It came in this afternoon, did a quick wash and made a cup real fast. I was amazed at how easy and quick it was. Then was blown away that the coffee didn’t suck, but was actually great. So, I’m very annoyed it took me this long to finally get around to trying it. Then I’m annoyed I have to reprogram my grinder, but it’ll be worth it. Now I can’t wait for the morning to have some more.

If you don't know my region is known as the chasio region and it's based off of North Carolina. The water starter is based off of how some species of crab wear discarded jellyfish to disguise themselves in the water. The grass starter is a cicada mixed with a carpenter beetle that uses a log as a shell. And the fire starter is based off of xiuhcoatl which is a God that looks like a turquoise snake but is also known as the ""fire serpent"" and is the deity of fire and time which is why my fire starter is turquoise. Anyways enough of me yapping let's get to the Pokedex entries 

Stump- grass
Stump can be found with their evolutions in forest the creating a ""music"".Unfortunately they are not the best yet but they are trained by their evolutions in order to get better. When they are born they will burrow into a log and use it as a protective shell as well as an instrument. They use their extremely long tongues to bang on the top of their log in order to make the sound of a drum. Sometimes if it's unlucky it will accidentally steal the stump of a phantump or tmburr.

Jellie- water
Jelly often dig into the sand on beaches to take a nap as they are always sleepy and lazy. And a big contributor to that laziness is the jellyfish that lies on it's head. They have a symbiotic relationship the jellyfish gets to move around and find food while jellie gets to be lazy all day. The jellyfish will often strike at predators if they get too close to jellie when sleeping. Pokemon professors are still perplex as this jellyfish cannot be found anywhere without jellie well simultaneously being typeless

Liso- fire
Liso are playful Pokemon and love running around in the forest with their siblings. They are so energetic in fact that most trainers compare them to a rockruff after eating a coffee bean. The yellow spots on its body seem to glow when the Pokemon is distressed most likely used to show its siblings its location if they ever happen to get lost. It is not wise to rub their nose as when you do you might get a severe burn.

I am trying to find the correct fittings to add a push-fit filter line and fittings between a normal 3/8 compression inlet > faucet connection. 

* I believe these 2 are good for the inlet side: 
* 3/8 female compression|3/8 FPT adapter  male NPTF|3/8 push-fit 

but I cant seem to find the correct fittings to go from the pushfit tubing to male compression.

PS I want this inline instead of a T so that my cold water faucet will be filtered.  

  
more (possibly unnecessary) detail:   
I have historically been using [this adapter](https://www.freshwatersystems.com/products/angle-stop-loop-adapter-3-8-x-3-8-x-3-8?variant=13250832302123) to do this but when i recently was changing things around I was told that I am not supposed to be connecting a female compression thread to the supposed MPT connector on that.    
It seemed s fine for several years, but the other side (plastic female compression > brass male inlet) started leaking when i removed a T connect (that went to a fridge water line). So I am connecting this fitting directly to the inlet valve inead of going through a T previously. So I dont have confidence in this adapter now.

Bottom line, I revisited the possible poor choices made after removing the refrigerator water line and want to do it properly this time.

I have this 4-in-1 coffee maker and for the life of me, cannot get this clean light to turn off on the single serve side.

The manual says for the single side ""Rotate START/STOP knob to clean, and press the START/STOP knob to begin descale. The clean indicator will flash."" However, it's not possible to actually select the ""clean"" light that is illuminated with the knob in the single serve side. I've run vinegar + water through all the single serve components over 10 times, cleaned out the needles, etc. and the damn light still won't turn off.  I've also descaled the other side using the ""clean"" button itself and that runs a clean cycle as the manual indicates.

Detailed Review,"Testing out the PUR PFM350V faucet mount filtration system in my kitchen was a treat. With its bold claim of being the only faucet filter reducing 70 chemical and physical substances, including lead, I knew I was in for a thorough review. This metallic grey beauty sat snugly on my faucet, promising cleaner, mineral-enhanced drinking water with its advanced 3-in-1 filtration technology. A week into using it, I found plenty to love and a few quirks worth mentioning.

**Aesthetic Appeal and Build Quality**  
The metallic grey finish immediately stood out. Its sleek design and compact dimensions (6.8 x 2.9 x 5.2 inches) mean it seamlessly blended with my modern kitchen decor while saving counter space. Made from plastic, the filter felt lightweight but not flimsy. It weighs just 11.2 ounces yet appears sturdy enough for prolonged daily use. Attaching it to my faucet was ridiculously simple—I didn’t even need any tools, and I’m no DIY pro. For a faucet mount, this one nails a balance between style and function. 

**Check PUR PFM350V on Amazon.**

**Quick Installation and Filter Replacement**  
Attaching the filtration unit was as straightforward as threading it onto a standard faucet with an external aerator. Even as someone who frequently grumbles at user manuals, I was thrilled there essentially wasn’t one necessary. The included adapters ensure compatibility with most faucets, though folks using pull-out systems or internal aerators are out of luck. Replacing the filter every three months or 100 gallons is refreshingly simple, thanks to the integrated filter change light. Watching the notification change color over time proved to be oddly satisfying—it felt like the device cared about keeping me accountable for clean water.

**Pluses**  
- Filters out 70 chemical and physical substances, including lead.  
- Comes equipped for tool-free installation.  
- Filter change light removes any guesswork.  
- Sleek design fits most modern kitchen aesthetics.  

**Limitations**  
- Doesn’t work with pull-out or internal aerator faucets.  
- Plastic material, though durable, could see scratches over repeated cleaning.  

**Filtration Performance**  
Nothing beats the peace of mind from knowing your tap water is cleaner. I live in an area known for hard water, and the PUR faucet filter improved not only the taste but also the clarity of my water. Certified by both WQA and NSF, it filters out microplastics, a feature absent in several competitors' products. I even tested this by making tea and coffee; both tasted smoother, with fewer odd aftertastes compared to plain tap water. Bottled water was silently pushed aside during my daily hydration routine—it’s hard to argue with convenience and reduced plastic waste!  

**Features Built for Everyday Use**  
One feature that stood out was the lever to toggle between filtered and unfiltered water. I started switching to unfiltered water for activities like washing dishes, which padded out the lifespan of the filter. The three adapters included in the package simplified installation further. The exact count of 100 gallons or four to six weeks of filtering might vary slightly depending on local water quality, but it helps to save both money and effort compared to buying bottled water.  

**Competing Products**  
While comparing this to other products like Brita faucet mounts and ZeroWater filters, some differences became evident. Brita’s systems lack PUR's microplastic filtering capability, which could be a dealbreaker for some. Meanwhile, ZeroWater’s filtration jugs may offer a similar taste upgrade but fail in terms of convenience and flow rate since they aren’t directly attached to a faucet. This product balances functionality with ease of use in a way that competitors still haven’t quite nailed. That being said, Brita's aesthetic variations might appeal to folks who prioritize design as much as performance.  

**Quality for Price**  
For me, this faucet filtration system struck a balance between affordability and utility. It’s far more practical than constantly stocking up on bottled water, which can easily add up. While the upfront cost might make you pause, the payoff, in the long run, is significant. This system may not replace heavy-duty water softeners, but for everyday use, it's both economical and efficient. No more lugging around plastic bottles or filling that barely-dripping pitcher filter!

Or if it’s the undiagnosed (but for sure) ADHD, but my energy is sapped day in and day out. Lately I feel like I’m barely surviving. I haven’t cleaned anything beyond basics in a month. I have barely played with my kids. I mean I take them out like twice a week to indoor playgrounds, but I don’t play much with them at home beyond bedtime. The tv has been on a lot. I just feel shitty and like a shitty mom. I still interact of course, a lot, but most my day is spent on the couch because I just have zero energy, even with caffeine (I have tea because coffee puts me to sleep).

I just don’t know what to do. I feel like I need a good 3 nights worth of proper rest, a weekend break (my husband works 6 days a week and I have no family or friends here), and someone to do a deep clean to get me back to a starting point. 😭

I also am trying to get diagnosed for ADHD. I thought I may be autistic but I got screened for it and they said that they didn’t think I had autism but I definitely seem like I have ADHD but they couldn’t diagnose me (prosper health). Idk if medicine will help or what. I just cannot will myself to do *anything* beyond making lists that never happen, grocery shop, cook, clean the living room and kitchen, and maybe laundry every once in a while.

Am I alone in this? Is this burnout or excuses or laziness?

1o5v2gf,https://www.reddit.com/r/MassiveHabits/comments/1o5v2gf/the_psychology_of_consistency_why_willpower/,The Psychology of Consistency: Why Willpower Always Fails,"Hey everyone,

We've been diving deep into behavioral psychology research, and there's something crucial most fitness approaches get wrong: they rely on willpower.

The truth is, willpower is a finite resource. Every decision you make throughout the day - from hitting snooze to choosing what to eat - drains this mental energy. By the time you need to force yourself to eat another meal or track your calories, your willpower tank is empty.

**What actually works:**

* **Environmental Design**: Set up your environment so the right choice is the easy choice. Keep healthy snacks visible, prep ingredients (not necessarily full meals), and remove friction points.
* **Habit Stacking**: Attach new eating habits to existing routines. Always have a protein shake after brushing your teeth? After your morning coffee? The key is piggybacking on established patterns.
* **Decision Reduction**: The fewer food decisions you make daily, the more mental energy you preserve. This doesn't mean eating the same thing every day, but having 2-3 reliable breakfast/lunch options you rotate through.
* **The 2-Minute Rule**: If a healthy meal takes less than 2 minutes to prepare, you're dramatically more likely to actually eat it. This is why pre-cut veggies, hard-boiled eggs, and single-serve portions are game-changers.

The goal isn't to become more disciplined - it's to build systems that make consistency automatic.

**DIARY**

**Day One**

7:30 AM: Good morning! I snooze my alarm once or twice and then get ready for the day. This includes brushing my teeth and my morning skincare (washing face with Cerave, using the good molecules discoloration serum, and cerave moisturizer with SPF). I also eat a biscuit with some strawberry rhubarb jam. I pack my lunch and hop on the bus to work.

9:00 AM: Emails have been checked and I head out to a dentist appointment. They remind me I should get Invisalign and I dutifully nod. (Yes I know this will be good for me, but I don’t have $5,000 lying around I want to part with.)

10:30 AM: Back in the office, updating some documents for meetings and bumming some tylenol off of a coworker because I always forget how much my teeth hurt after a cleaning. The biscuit wasn’t super filling so I have a banana to tide me over until lunch. 

12:00 PM: I log off and heat up some lasagna I had frozen earlier this month. I don’t mind cooking for one for the most part (thank god), so my eating habits are pretty boring because I’m eating the same meal over and over. I also have some mixed vegetables, grapes, and a no bake cookie. I eat with my coworkers and we discuss TV shows. This includes an (unsuccessful) pitch for me to watch Succession, which I’ll hit someday.

2:00 PM: My post-lunch sleepiness is really hitting me today. I go into a phone booth to call a restaurant about private dining for our holiday party, but they don’t have any spaces suitable for us. I add this to my notes and send this off to my coworker. 

3:30 PM: I wander out of our office and into the coworking space, where I find kettle-cooked chips and mini Snickers. I delight in both and then immediately feel self-conscious for eating a very crunchy food in the world’s quietest office. Oh well! I send out emails with updates for an upcoming meeting. 

6:00 PM: Home from work and I sit on the couch for a long while. For dinner I have some leftover shrimp fried rice with yum yum sauce. I peel myself away to pick up some library books, but after that I am back to the couch for some rotting.

8:30 PM: It’s time for a power hour! I set a timer and made ham and swiss egg bites, unload the dishwasher, and handwash some dishes. I take the egg bites out of the oven and shower before facetiming some college friends. We’ve mostly ended up in different cities so it’s lovely to catch up. I knit a few rounds of a sweater while one friend contemplates how to arrange some artwork. We chat until 11:15 or so.

11:45 PM: Lights out, eye mask on, ASMR playing. Good night!!

**Total Spent: $0**



**Day 2** 

5:30 AM: I wake up like 15 minutes before my alarm, which is unfortunate. I’m trying a morning workout class before work, and I think my anxiety is getting the best of me in terms of having time to do everything. I eat half a banana (the top half was rotten), pack my breakfast and lunch, and head out the door schlepping three bags.

7:45 AM: The class is winding down. I just started working out again and this is hard! But I know it’s for the best for me to move, and I do enjoy these classes. I do a quick body shower and change into my work outfit. Feeling surprisingly peppy as I head out and catch the bus to work. My friend E. texts me and asks if I want to join her for a yoga class tomorrow. I agree and pick a slow flow.

9:00 AM: While at work I heated up some of the egg bites and two biscuits for breakfast. I also make a cup of earl grey and check emails. The tiredness quickly catches up with me. Oh joy. We head into a long meeting and I fight the sleepiness for the first half. After a short break I do feel better.

1:00 PM: I take my lunch and talk about William Shakespeare with my coworkers, among other things. Today’s selection is shrimp fried rice, green grapes, a no-bake cookie and some Lidl brand goldfish crackers. It’s a sunny day so I enjoy that.

2:45 PM: I go to CVS because my glasses are dirty and it’s one of my biggest pet peeves. I wander through the aisles until I give up and ask the workers where the glasses cleaner is. They happily show me and I get a travel sized bottle to keep at my desk. **($6.14)**

3:15 PM: I have a short meeting with my boss and grandboss about a title change! We just completed a reorganization so I had been angling for one. I’m excited for this, and it comes with a small raise as well.

4:45 PM: It’s time to head out, so I bus home. My roommate L. is back from her travels so we chat for a little bit while I eat dinner. I have to quickly change and head out the door for job number two.

10:45 PM: Home from work! It wasn’t too crazy tonight, and I was training some new people who were very nice. I like this job, and the extra paychecks don’t hurt at all. Once I’m home I sit on the couch for a while before showering and heading to bed. Lights out at 12:15 AM.

**Total Spent: $6.14**



**Day 3**

8:00 AM: My alarm goes off, which I set late as a treat for waking up so early last night. I hear L. head off to work and slowly get ready for the day. I heat up the same breakfast and have some of the apple I packed yesterday alongside it.

10:45 AM: I update my net worth tracker since the new month started, and pay my credit card. I also make my first student loan payment of the month (included in monthly expenses). I currently have no minimum since I started the Income Based Repayment while interning on the Hill and making … not much. But I’d rather pay this off sooner and not have it hanging over me. I’m not going to sacrifice my quality of life for it though. $500 plus per month isn’t anything to scoff at. 

3:00 PM: I end up purchasing my flights home for Christmas. Every year I set aside money for this and every year I want to cry at how much the tickets are. I use some credit card miles to soften the blow. I text my parents to let them know when I’ll be home. **($311.95)**

4:30 PM: I make some tuna cakes and eat those with some homemade tartar sauce I made earlier in the week. I’ve been getting really good green grapes recently, so I savor those too. 

5:30 PM: Heading out the door to meet E. for yoga. It’s a slow flow so nothing too crazy. Savasana continues to be my favorite part. I am humbled while trying to do a sitting forward fold. My hips are not flexible at  the moment. Such is life. We head to E’s house and she cooks some andouille sausage for us to have as a pre-kickball snack.

9:00 PM: Kickball game is over! We tied, but it isn’t a loss? We joined and they mostly all know each other but everyone is super nice. We head to a bar and sit outside for a while post-game. We also end up getting food, which is fine by me since I ate dinner pretty early. Peruvian chicken isn’t half bad! Although the broccoli was ice cold… **($19.15)**

11:00 PM: L. and I head out, I drop her off at her place and head home. Meeting L. has probably been the highlight of my year, socially at least. Queer friendship man!!

1:00 AM: I’ve showered and am in bed. Good night!

**Total Spent: $331.10**



**Day 4**

8:30 AM: I wake up and get ready for the day. My paycheck from my second job came in so I divide that up in YNAB. A random charge from a Hill Staff Association goes through so I email the group to take me off the membership list. **($5.00)**

11:30 AM: Work hasn’t been too crazy. Biscuits and egg bites for brunch. I work on the grocery list for the dinner party L. and I are throwing tomorrow. I send $200 to my Roth IRA and wait for the transfer to go through. My hulu subscription also processes today. 

3:30 PM: I work on washing the bathroom linens and wipe down baseboards. Ours are white so they show dust so badly!

5:00 PM: I eat some fried rice and head off to work.

11:15 PM: I made it home, busy but not as bad as the height of summer. Lights out around 1:00 AM. 

**Total Spent: $5.00**



**Day 5**

8:30 AM: Party Day!! I go over my game plan for the day and head out to grocery stores one and two for ingredients (Glazed pecans, dishwasher cleaner, paper plates, diced tomatoes, evaporated milk, tomato puree, parmesan, penne, colby jack, heavy cream, cavatappi, grape tomatoes, spinach, and spring mix). I also go to the farmer’s market for flowers. **($58.75)**

10:30 AM: L. and I go to grocery stores three and four (french bread, ricotta, lasagna noodles, rice krispies, butterscotch chips, chocolate chips, gruyere, minced garlic, basil, lemons, an onion, meatloaf mix, and powdered Ocean Spray drink mix). We also stop and buy a new air filter (L. pays). **($57.47)**

12:00 PM: Back from our excursions, we eat lunch and I take some time to veg out. After that I make dessert for the party and start on the sauce for the lasagna.

2:00 PM: Disaster has struck. We had grated parm but it expired in August… I send L. out to the store for more. Once she’s back I make the ricotta filling and realize that we don’t have enough noodles. Shrinkflation must be hitting because the recipe calls for only 12 noodles and we need five for each layer. I use the last two L. had from a prior lasagna but we are only two layers in. L. is off to the store again…

3:00 PM: Ok, the lasagna has been assembled and is in the fridge to hang until closer to the party. L. and I shred an insane amount of cheese. I remember the internet saying to stick the cheese in the freezer to make it easier so I did that this morning. Those blocks were rock hard. They softened while I made the lasagna, so they’re better now at least. I finish shredding the cheese for mac and cheese while L. makes the sauce. I also prep the garlic butter for garlic bread! 

5:00 PM: Some cleaning occurs like one final vacuum and mop, as well as taking the trash out prior to the party starting! My gym’s annual fee goes through. **($42.00)**

6:00 PM: Pastas are assembled and in the fridge. L. and I are both starving so we eat a scotcharoo as a little pre-dinner dessert. I change and get ready while our friend P. calls and says she can’t make it due to last minute work scheduling. This sucks, but she apologizes profusely and offers to make us pasta in return. 

6:45 PM: E. arrives and we chat while the food is taken out of the oven. It was delicious, can’t complain! L’s boyfriend F. arrives after wandering the aisles of the grocery store for Shirley Temple materials. 

10:00 PM: People start to trickle out aside from a few as the Tigers/Mariners game is on. One of our friends is at the game (sadly missing the party to do so) so I text her. I also buy a ticket for an event next week that E. and I make plan to go to. **($15.28)**

12:15 PM: The game is over so I get ready to head to bed. 

**Total Spent: $173.50**



**Day 6**

8:30 AM: I wake up but don’t really get out of bed for a few hours. I eat some cereal and scroll social media.

12:30 PM: I eventually get ready and go to the grocery store to get groceries for the rest of the week, supplementing the insane amount of leftovers we have left (frozen hashbrowns, a  bag of honeycrisp apples, grape tomatoes, jalapenos, breakfast sausage, eggs, raspberries, and green grapes, an onion, bananas, toothbrushes, and steripods). I eat some of said leftovers for lunch and do some light cleaning around the house. This includes washing all my bedding, mattress pad and quilt included. I do enjoy having these monthly tasks, since they make me feel at least a little put together. I also run a cleaning cycle on the dishwasher and let that run. **($48.50)** 

2:30 PM: I’m meeting a new friend for coffee so I meet her there and get a hibiscus tea. We sit on her porch and talk for a few hours. We’d only met once prior to this but we fall into easy conversation. It took a few months to plan this but I’m so glad we did! **($5.52)**

4:30 PM: Heading home and say hi to L. before she and F. go to the Lorde concert. I didn’t think I cared enough to try and participate in the ticketmaster wars but I am feeling severe FOMO the more I see it on social media. Oh well. 

6:30 PM: I get ready for work and head out. The shift is short and goes by quickly, plus I get to work with some of my favorite coworkers.

10:30 PM: We close and I go home and get ready for bed. Nothing else of note.

**Total Spent: $54.02**



**Day 7**

8:00 AM: More cereal for me. Yippee! I get ready for the day and sit down to send out my weekly emails.

12:00 PM: Nothing much to report today. I bake some salmon and have that with a salad and some garlic bread. Scroll tiktok which is full of discourse about the new Taylor Swift album. I haven’t listened to it fully yet (much to the chagrin of E.), but I’ll get around to it. 

4:30 PM: I set a two hour timer and tell myself I will go to the gym once it goes off. I eat a banana with some peanut butter and do some laundry. It’s been a very lowkey day and the news has honestly just been getting to me (shocker, woman is sad in current day and age). 

6:30 PM: The timer goes off and I walk to the gym. I normally do a workout class but it was cancelled so I do a push day and force myself to listen to the entire album. I decide that I don’t love the lyrics but I admit they’re catchy tunes. But since so many of the songs are interpolated can she even take credit for that? I digress. I look at the moon on my walk home. 

8:00 PM: I have a never-ending amount of lasagna in my fridge, so I eat this for dinner and shower. I wash more clothes and hang them to dry. This always ups the humidity in my room to a ridiculous extent so I drag the dehumidifier in there and crank it. I also make a breakfast casserole and stick that in the oven. 

10:30 PM: Casserole is in the fridge, I get into bed. I had started *Who Framed Roger Rabbit* a day prior, so I finish watching that. It did hold up for me! I eventually drift off around midnight. 

**Total Spent: $0**

**Reflect:** I feel like the amount tracks but not the categories, since I'm not hosting and buying flights around the holidays every week. But this was a fun exercise and for the most part I feel secure in my spending. Also, L. did venmo me for half so I didn't spend quite as much as this. I just couldn't bear doing the math after having to rewrite this godforesaken diary twice.

It used to bother me sometimes.  But I realize how many vacations were ruined by a friend acting out, getting drunk and stupid, fights between other couples, and so on.  And I came to realize traveling and sightseeing along is a wonderful thing.  You can do things on your own schedule.  if you wake up and want to just sip coffee for two hours, while reading a book, you can do that.  If you want to bring your camera on a hike and take your time photographing everything you can do that.  If you want to change your plans, on a moment's notice, you can do that.  You just have to not give a rip about others and what they think.  Mostly, if it doesn't bother you, it won't bother them, either!  Just be natural, be in the moment, enjoy things, share photos with people.  It's wonderful.  ",46,1760386820.0,unpopularopinion,23,0.93,False

It was chill and nice. But as we walked back, they were like ""Would you like to go on a date with me sometime?"" I hesitated before saying yes.

Here is a scenario - Tuesday, 7:12 a.m. – Maya’s kitchen

Maya is buttering toast while her phone pings.

PING

**Agent-Max: “Deal locked. New broadband bundle: USD 59.90, 14 % cheaper than last month.”**

Maya grins. Fourteen percent feels like a win—until her brother Leo wanders in, coffee in hand.

Leo: “Fourteen percent of what?”

Maya: “Huh?”

Leo: “Last month you paid USD 69.95 for 500 Mbps. New offer is 200 Mbps. Cheaper, yes. Better? Who knows?”

Toast pauses mid-air. Maya never asked Agent-Max to hold speed constant; Max simply learned that “lower price” historically correlated with Maya tapping the “Accept” button. Speed became collateral damage.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

6:55 p.m. – Maya tries to look under the hood

She taps “Explain Deal.”

Agent-Max: “Evaluated 17 vendor packets, rejected 6, accepted best-fit offer.”

Maya: “Show raw packets.”

Max: “Proprietary protocol; displaying would expose vendor intellectual property.”

In human terms: Trust me, bro.

What gets lost?

No A/B mirror world where Maya’s agent chose the runner-up, so she can’t see surplus left on the table.

Leo reminds Maya she streams 4 K concerts every Friday. Two years ago she didn’t. Agent-Max never updated bandwidth priority because that datum sits in a siloed entertainment app.

And call me a luddite but -

A buddy of mine said some good things about Reddit, so I figured I’d give it a shot! I've been traveling across the country (working remotely) and have been having a blast. It’s definitely had its high and lows, and I've met a bunch of different folks along the way -- but finding those lasting connections is obviously a little tough with this lifestyle. Hence why I'm here on Reddit. I put the location tag as US, since I'm not really restricted on location.

Here's a bit about me:

* I'm 40, male, and work in the medical field.
* I’ve been traveling full-time since last summer. I started on the east coast (NE), made my way through the Ozarks, and now I’m slowly meandering west.
* I love cooking, especially when I can do it outside. My go-to is a cast-iron skillet breakfast hash with whatever’s on hand -- potatoes, eggs, peppers. Hot sauce is a must, let's be real, haha.
* I'm a big reader. Right now it’s a mix of Steinbeck, some travel essays, and a book on neuroscience I like to pretend I understand.
* I used to be a runner, but now I’m more of a ""slow hiker who stops for photos and snacks"" if you get what I mean.
* I grew up near the ocean. I'm not afraid to laugh at myself, like the time I accidentally locked my keys (and shoes) inside the van at a rest stop in the middle of nowhere. Hey, at least it made for a fun story, right?
* I’m pretty low-key. I'm content with campfires, podcasts, stargazing, and the occasional dive bar conversation with strangers.
* I value good communication and people who can sit comfortably in both silence and long talks.
* My playlists jump from indie folk to old soul to 90s hip-hop, depending on the mood.
* I try to practice gratitude, even on WiFi-free days.

What I'm Looking For:

* Someone grounded, kind, and emotionally intelligent.
* someone who’s curious about the world, loves learning, and doesn’t mind taking the scenic route once in a while.
* I’m drawn to folks who can find beauty in simple things like a good cup of good coffee, a quiet morning - stuff like that.
* You don’t have to be a traveler (though that’s always a bonus), just open-minded, thoughtful, and looking to connect
