Either I've met my future wife, or I'll never see her again. But life is short either way.","Today, I (25M) met an attractive young woman (mid-20's?) after work in my apartment building's elevator. While I was waiting for the elevator after arriving from work, she entered the building and immediately caught my eye. She went to grab her mail and a package, and I waited for the elevator, glancing at her a few times. The elevator arrived about a minute later, and in that moving box, we struck up probably a minute-long conversation (about what was inside the package she was holding in her hands) as we rode up to our floors. She was wearing scrubs, and I noticed she was a vet school student. But because I'm kind of a schmuck, I didn't actually get her name. I have a tendency to do that. But she appeared to be flirting back at me as I was to her, and I think she's pretty damn cute. So I've taken the liberty of doing a thing.

I'm about to put a bright yellow post-it note in the elevator saying essentially what I just told you. The note will read:

""To the cute \[her school's name\] vet student I met in this very elevator yesterday--I enjoyed our brief chat, but I'm disappointed I never got your name. Guess I was too flustered to think straight, since you koala-fied as the highlight of my day. I'd love to grab coffee, and I'm turtle-y hoping you say yes.""

I added my phone number (NOT my apartment number, so as to prevent unprecedented embarrassment in my building) and a smile face.

I don't see people to often in my building, partly because it's new, but partly because I'm out and about due to work, the gym, and other shenanigans. People also tend to move, so there's that. Point is, she'll likely see the note, but whether she will text/call me (or whether I'll bump into her again) is another question entirely.

But I live for these moments. Life is short, so take advantage of opportunities like these. Have an ""F it"" mentality. Shoot your shot. Live.",1,1755140781.0,dating_advice,2,0.67,False

I am a mental health therapist and almost all of my paid hours during my work day are person facing- unless I am providing therapy I am not likely getting paid.

I really don‚Äôt get any breaks during my day but I do that because I need that hour for admin responsibilities.

While that spring was pointless, I was able to self-level with a similar spring design. The two main pieces of feedback I received on my last post revolved around self-leveling and food safety. I will explain those issues below.

  
Food Safety:

This spring can be printed in PLA (the most common 3D Printed Material) and does not, as some have suggested, break right away. While PLA is great for cheap printing, it is not food safe, so I have switched to using PETG for the bottom. You can buy food-safe PETG or any other food-safe material online and use it for just the bottom of the tamper. While my PETG is not certified food-safe, I have decided it is good enough for me. Of course, use non-food-safe materials at your own risk.

Self-Leveling:

The spring now only connects to an outer ring that sits on the edge of your puck and moves independently from the tamper. It works pretty well, and I believe the current version is pretty accurately level, but if you decide to print, please let me know how it works for you!

## Key Features Analysis

the best iPhone 14 Pro cases with card holders boast a range of extraordinary features designed to protect your phone and simplify your life.

**Material and Construction:** Strong and durable materials like TPU (Thermoplastic Polyurethane),PC (polycarbonate),or a combination of both are critical for protection against drops,scratches,and everyday wear and tear. The construction should also offer precise cutouts for easy access to ports and buttons.A Good case should provide a raised lip around the screen and camera to protect these sensitive areas from direct contact with surfaces. The interior lining should be soft to prevent scratches on the iPhone's surface. High-quality construction ensures that the case can withstand daily use and offer long-lasting protection.

**Card Capacity and Security:** The card holder should be able to securely hold at least 2-3 cards, accommodating essential IDs and credit cards. The design should prevent cards from easily falling out, even when the case is dropped or shaken. Some cases offer RFID (Radio Frequency Identification) blocking to protect against electronic theft.

The mechanism for accessing the cards should be smooth and reliable, allowing for swift and easy retrieval when needed. The card holder should not add excessive bulk to the case, maintaining a relatively slim profile. Diffrent card holder designs exist, including sliding compartments, snap-on covers, and wallet-style flaps, each offering varying levels of security and convenience.

**Design and Aesthetics:** While functionality is vital, the case should also complement the iPhone 14 Pro's design. Slim and sleek profiles are preferred, avoiding unnecessary bulk. A variety of colors and finishes should be available to match individual preferences.

The design should also consider ergonomics,ensuring a pleasant grip and easy access to all phone features. Some cases offer textured surfaces for enhanced grip, reducing the risk of accidental drops. The overall aesthetic should be clean and professional, suitable for both casual and formal settings.

**Wireless Charging Compatibility:** Many users rely on wireless charging, so the case should be compatible with Qi wireless charging technology.The case thickness and material should not interfere with the charging signal.

Cases that are not compatible with wireless charging can be inconvenient, requiring users to remove the case every time they want to charge wirelessly. Wireless charging compatibility is a crucial feature for seamless integration with modern charging habits. Some cases are specifically designed to optimize wireless charging efficiency, ensuring faster charging times.

1mpotq7,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1mpotq7/aita_for_expecting_my_future_bil_to_apologize_and/,AITA for expecting my future BIL to apologize and respect my boundaries?,"I, 30 F and 32 M boyfriend of about a year and a half now live together with his mom and brother. His twin brother recently moved back in after being gone for a little over a year, so we did not live together when he was still at the house. When he moved back in, there was a slight adjustment since my bf and I basically had our own space for a while. I mostly do the cooking for the house and cleaning duties - my bf helps whenever I ask. 

Since his brother moved back in, I have continued to do all those things. I clean our shared bathroom, wash the towels for our bathroom and cook/ clean most of the time due to my bf and I having different work schedules. I somewhat expected the brother to help or take some of the responsibilities off of us, considering he was not currently working. I began to stop expecting anything from him and my bf and I continued to do things ourselves, despite my bf asking him to occasionally help out, to which his response most of the time was that he was busy (aka gaming or sleeping). 

He then started to do things that made me actually mad - he ignored texts from his mom asking him to do things, which then had to be taken care of by my bf or myself. 

He started coming into our room and taking clothes from our closet bc he was too lazy to wash his or just wanted to wear my bfs clothes - without asking most times. (This mainly bothered me bc I have purchased some of the clothes he was taking and didn‚Äôt really care if he was taking things my bf no longer wore / I didn‚Äôt buy). 

Mf bf also had set up a mini fridge where I keep my coffee set up and other drinks. He started drinking some of the sodas / waters I would buy and by the time I would go to get one, there would be only 1-2 left from the pack of 6+. My bf nicely asked him if he had been drinking them to which he defensively responded that he had a couple/ few and if they were ‚Äúoff limits‚Äù? All my bf asked was for him to ask if he could have one before just taking them or assuming I wouldn‚Äôt mind, considering I was the one who purchased them. He then proceeded to go off on a rant about purchasing his own groceries and not letting us have any. (His mom and my bf and I purchase all of the groceries & he currently doesn‚Äôt help financially, which I understand isn‚Äôt possible.) 

Just a couple of weeks ago, I went to dinner with my bf‚Äôs mom and stopped to pick up food for both him and his brother on the way home. I brought my leftovers from the restaurant home and after he ate the food I brought for him, he also ate my left overs without asking and saw nothing wrong with it. He ended up apologizing the next morning after my bf had to explain why that wasn‚Äôt cool. 

To put the cherry on top, he just did what I believe is his FIRST load of laundry since moving back in, back in May (due to him getting a new job.) He had left his clothes in the dryer the night before, to which I politely put back in his basket the next day so I could do our own laundry. I washed one of my fav shirts that I purchased for my bf (to which he‚Äôs previously borrowed, once asking, and then again w/o asking and then not returning and what sparked my bf to ask him to not take clothes that I‚Äôve purchased). I hung the shirt on a hanger to air dry and this morning I woke up to him walking out the door wearing said shirt (without asking AGAIN). I immediately told my bf something bc I couldn‚Äôt believe that he would do that, considering that same shirt is what had been previously talked about. 

* to clarify, I have always funneled my complaints about his brother directly to my bf and then he‚Äôs told him to not do those things or why I was annoyed or upset, bc he‚Äôs told me that he would rather handle any conflict to ensure that his brother did not speak out of line to me. (I prefer this as well, bc I‚Äôm not one to try to start something or cause a fight) 

My bf let him know what I was upset about the shirt, to which he responded ‚Äúyeah I know lol‚Äù 

Back and forth happened between my bf and him, to which he basically just made excuses for wearing the shirt bc he didn‚Äôt want to come in our room and wake up my bf. I was awake for 20 min before he left, to which he could‚Äôve asked me to either borrow the shirt or wear another one of my bfs shirts instead. He also had just done laundry 2 days prior and had only gone to work 1 day, so he had other shirts to wear rather than the one hanging in the laundry room that wasn‚Äôt his. 

He decided to text me to air things out but never apologized. He also essentially claims our difference in household upbringings being the reason I‚Äôm not used to ‚Äúsharing‚Äù and has told my bf previously that me being an only child is the reason I think the way I do and complain about the things he does. AITA for expecting him to respect my boundaries and not do things that have already been communicated? 

*I also just want to mention that my bf has done his absolute best at trying to mediate and has always stood up for me and my feelings. 

I‚Äôve included a text script of the text messages he sent me directly - Theo is my bf‚Äôs name. 

‚ÄúI wanna address this since it‚Äôs become an issue and I think maybe it‚Äôs gone a little too far recently. And I‚Äôm in no way saying your opinion isn‚Äôt valid but this needs to be brought up. I only have two polos or shirts that can be worn in an office setting. You know this, Theo knows this. This training is only two weeks long. I actually was going to wake up Theo and ask even though he‚Äôs SLEEPING for work but I happened to find a shirt hanging in the laundry room so I figured hey waking up someone resting for work is unnecessary in this situation, especially since my brother whom we‚Äôve shared clothes with for over 30 years with no issue would never not say yes to me regarding borrowing a shirt. Theo and I have never liked being woken up prematurely. He knows this and I know this and it‚Äôs become a mutual understanding between us. I understand though why you feel the way you do about the clothes because you purchased them for him. But I am starting to think your concern goes beyond a place of mutual respect and consideration for convenience. I know you have no issues waking theo up even though he‚Äôs asleep but between him and I it‚Äôs just something we don‚Äôt do. So I guess the only solution to make you happy would be for me to barge in. Wake him up and ask him EVERY TIME I need a shirt? I just want to make sure that‚Äôs clear and that‚Äôs what you want.

Because just frankly I think that‚Äôs pretty ridiculous but you know we come from different households. We‚Äôre siblings and even beyond that we‚Äôre twins which is a different ball game, you grew up not sharing with anyone. I feel like I just want a little empathy in that regard. 

But if there‚Äôs no way around it and you want me to barge in every time I need something I will. You know you can talk to me you don‚Äôt have to send all of your issues through my brother. 

I‚Äôm a person, and we‚Äôre gonna be in laws one day. 

Make me understand what exactly you expect and want from your own words. 

Because apparently you think everything I do is simply to piss you off and that‚Äôs just ridiculous and completely un true. ‚Äú

So please let me know if I‚Äôm the ass hole or being over dramatic. Yes, I know moving out is an option - that‚Äôs not the point of the post lol. ",1,1755140154.0,AITAH,4,1.0,False

Preface: My anxiety has been thru the roof. I have chronic ptsd (who doesn‚Äôt lol) and my landlord has issues w me but attacked my boyfriend over them, and almost barged into my home and I had to move back in w my bf. my social anxiety has been thru the roof. I have been going thru it for 2 years straight. I‚Äôm not what happens to me but I‚Äôm still barely functioning right now and thank God for streaming no funny shit. I‚Äôm still camming on SM thankfully. 

I sought help a few posts ago and building a routine for Sm has helped me. I wake up, shower, stream, break. But this week I‚Äôve been struggling with my routine. 

My issues for help/advice: 

CB is high energy so I‚Äôve been doing it less lately. SM brings me more hourly compared to CB where sometimes it‚Äôs hit/miss unless I grind for 4 hours and it‚Äôs way more than I expect to earn sometimes.

 The thing is, realistically my boyfriend has a job with long hours and physical labor. He‚Äôs reassured me it‚Äôs ok if I cam but I literally see him unable to sleep until I end stream. In good conscience I can‚Äôt stream that late on CB which were my golden hours. Do I just shelf CB until I get my own housing, or try different hours at least for a little bit? It used to be my bread and butter but lately it‚Äôs been SM. 

I built a following on CB and I feel so bad not following thru the schedule I WANT TO DO because of restrictions beyond my control. I know I could stream still and disturb my bf‚Äôs sleep but idk. What would you do? I have 25k followers on CB and I feel so stupid just slowing the momentum but I don‚Äôt know how to proceed with scheduling. Meanwhile I‚Äôve maintained a schedule of sorts on streammate for the past few weeks since the incident with my landlord and it‚Äôs been working. 

I‚Äôm so stressed out. I loveeee camming and what I do, being unable to have my own space and my own hours where I feel free enough to yap and jump around, create content on a fast pace and upload‚Äî its getting to me. I barely have space in my bf‚Äôs room, my tripod is downstairs in the basement god knows where. I‚Äôm sucking up being uncomfortable and trying to do what I can, how I can. 

 Should I try to build on top of CB with a morning schedule or in between my SM? (I try to stream 2x/day) 

Another piece of advice if anyone has: been adjusting to psych meds for 2 months now!!! Don‚Äôt want to specify in case it‚Äôs against rules (bipolar med). Still so sleepy without coffee. I feel so anxious since everything happened, we have coffee in the house I‚Äôm free and invited to make which would help. But I don‚Äôt feel comfortable around his family. I‚Äôve asked my bf to have dinner with them sometime. How do I just rip the bandaid off and get myself food and coffee when I need???? How do i function because my therapist is quite literally no help and my psych says she‚Äôs better than a waiting list with no specific time guarantee.  ",1,1755140075.0,CamGirlProblems,1,1.0,False

I'm a 32 year old Black woman and New York City native who loves the city, and likely will never leave. I'm looking for someone local (or someone who is planning to move here) who also loves all the city has to offer. 

About me:

Most importantly, I am an ambivert and a cat person. I love to parallel play with my loved ones on a quiet afternoon, but I also like to go out a few times a week to a nice restaurant, my local dive, or a coffee shop. 

I love live music and have been to one or two shows a month since the beginning of this year. Some of my favorite genres are indie rock, Midwest emo, and pop. 

I like to read, craft, and bake in my free time. I'm getting back into writing, too. 

About you:

A creative, funny, and also a cat person. I want someone who is empathetic and politically progressive left. I get along best with people who are quick-witted, independent thinkers, and open to learning new things. 

My usual type is tall & brown-haired, but I am open if you can make me laugh, are a great cook, or can send me good book recommendations. A nice smile doesn't hurt either.

Nice but not necessary:

-Niche hobby
-Plays an instrument
-Studied humanities
-Has tattoos

About us:

I am ideally looking for someone who is ready for a long term relationship. I am in a place in life where I have everything I need and am very happy. I love my career, my friendships, have hobbies that interest and excite me, and am content spending time alone. 

I want someone who feels the same about their life, who wants to find ways to add to each other's lives.

If any of that piqued your interest, I'd love to hear from you! Please send a SFW picture and a little about you and say hi :)",0,1755140035.0,ForeverAloneDating,1,0.5,False

Name: Lilienne Ivy Glass
Age: 21
Birthdate: Oct 18 2004
Gender: F

Profile Characteristics 

Personality:  Shy, Quiet, Socially awkward, paranoid, creative (artsy), romantic daydreamer, stubborn

Likes: Lilacs, rainy nights, storms, bunnies, reading, painting, soft music, punk rock music, loyalty

Dislikes: dishonesty, artificial lighting, the smell of gasoline, crowded areas, silence so deep its heavy, sudden changes with no time to prepare

Quirks/Habits: twirls a strand of hair when lost in thought/ daydreaming, avoids stepping on sidewalk cracks, keeps her tea half full for hours as she tends to get distracted easily.

Hobbies: collecting flowers/ pressing them in books, baking simple recipes, journaling, going to thrift stores/ book stores and or flea markets.

Backstory:
Lilienne grew up in a small apartment above a laundromat, the hum of machines and the scent of detergent was her constant. Her father, a mechanic with a tired smile, raised her and her three siblings alone after their mother died giving birth to the youngest. In the chaos of the city, their home was heaven. mismatched mugs on the table, the crackle of an old radio, the sound of rain tapping against the kitchen window.
She was quiet but stubborn, a romantic daydreamer who filled sketchbooks with the colors and shapes she wished the world would see. School was a place she excelled at with little to no effort. By the time she stood at the podium as valedictorian, her voice trembling, she believed the path ahead was hers to shape. Art galleries, travel, a name whispered in admiration.
College was only an hour‚Äôs drive away, just across the city, but it might as well have been in another world. That‚Äôs where she met him. The boy who called her ‚Äúhis little artist,‚Äù who at first made her laugh, then made her flinch. His disapproval arrived in quiet doses.. a raised eyebrow at her paintings, a sigh when she stayed up sketching all night. Over time, it became sharper. Louder. His hands, once warm, turned into something that left marks she hid under sweaters, even in the summer heat.
The night she left, she didn‚Äôt tell him. She didn‚Äôt tell anyone. She packed her brushes and canvases first, clothes second, and caught the earliest bus west. She told herself she wasn‚Äôt running, just.. starting over. A smaller neighborhood, quiet streets, an old house with peeling paint.

Name: Silas Draven Vale
Age: 25
Birthdate: March 28 2000
Gender: M

Profile Characteristics

Personality: Devoted, calculated, possessive, romantically twisted, emotionally reserved besides his love

Likes: vintage love tokens, nighttime, rain, lilacs, classical music, punk rock music, mementos

Dislikes: loud places, carelessness, harsh lights, loss of control

Quirks/Habits:memorizes Lilienne's routine, hums under his breath, ritualistic

Hobbies: gardening, writing, late night walks, cooking, sketching, gun ranging

Backstory: 
Silas grew up in a small quiet town, where appearance mattered more than truth. His father was around, but he was cold, distant and very strict. His mother was timid, fragile and very frail. The kind of woman to put on a smile even through the roughest terrain. Growing up he was like every other young boy. Happy and playful, a real jokester. But into his teen hood he began to change, he wouldn't say for the worse but definitely not for the better if you asked others around him. He began to blend into the background, remembering people's routines without realizing. Who took which bus after school, where they liked to sit, their habits during breaks or lunch. What made them smile. He began to feel off from his peers, not having the biggest emotions towards friends or family. Besides his mother of course. He had his first love at the age of 16. But that ended after only a few short months. She was scared of him, the things he'd say or do. She told him he knew more about her than she knew herself. So she broke things off which caused him to spiral. He got into fights in and out of school constantly when he noticed someone getting close to his love. To the point he got expelled, the only high school in Silverbriar BC, he decided to move out after his fathers constant drinking and torment. Leaving his mother behind yet he still regrets not bringing her with him. One rainy night Silas was sitting outside on the steps of ‚ÄúIvory & Ash‚Äù his knuckles split and bleeding. Silas was found by Evie Macken, the widowed owner. She brought him inside, offered him tea and a job carrying heavy things in and out of the store. The quiet shop gave him peace at last. Ivory & Ash became more than just a job. Through Evie's connections, some clients brought in rare and even unregistered antiques tied to the darker corners of the town and beyond. When jobs needed to be done, Evie would give Silas a signal by leaving an ivory horse figurine on the top of the cash register, allowing him to ‚Äòhandle things‚Äô others wouldn't dare to deal with or even want to be associated with. The shop's locked back room doubled as a safe haven for Silas, to store tools, or stash items collected on the ‚Äòjob‚Äô. The second hand goods provided a perfect cover to move stolen valuables through Evie's network.

Profile Appearance

Appearance: Silas has pale ghostly skin as he barely sees the light of day. Thick dark brown almost black hair that slightly drapes into his face, his hairstyle like a modern greaser without any product. He has a neck tattoo of a raven flying, its head wrapped around his neck and its wings/ body on his shoulder. He has an eyebrow slit on his left eye which he decided to do the day he memorized Lilienne's face seeing her beauty mark. Deep brown eyes narrow and animalistic with a sense of calm in his face. A little scary on his upper lip causing his lips to always be a tiny bit parted.

Build: Silas is 6 '2 and relatively fit. A muscular natural build with patchwork tattoos ranging from his chest, back, waist and his right arm and hands.

Clothing Style: Prefers dark, well-fitted clothing; black wool coats, worn leather jackets, cuffed sleeves showing forearm tattoos. Crisp, button-down shirts. Heavy boots, even in the rain. Always dresses with intention.. ‚Äònothing is careless.‚Äô

Favourite Color: Lilac purple, black, deep blue

Aesthetic: Dim streetlamps in the rain, cigarette smoke curling in cold air, rough hands resting on old wood, pressed lilac petals between the pages of an antique book.

Materialistic likes: Ivory chess pieces, old pocket watches, fountain pens, vintage revolvers, leather-bound journals, rare pressed flowers.

Voice and mannerisms: Speaks in a low, even tone. rarely raises his voice. Often tilts his head slightly when studying someone, as if dissecting every detail. Holds prolonged eye contact, rarely blinking until the other person looks away. Moves deliberately, never rushed even when others might hurry.",1,1755139995.0,RomanceWriters,0,1.0,False

I spend most of my days at home hanging out with the cats, one of whom loves to play fetch. I've loved art ever since I was very young. I have huge ambitions to have my own graphic design gig someday, but right now, I don't currently work at all.

I love video games. I got a lot to play on. PS5, Xbox One, Switch, Meta Quest 2, my iPad, and now PC. I'm an achievements/trophy hunter. I also collect PS1 & 2 games to play on my PlayStation 2. In recent years, I've been very casual with my gaming, playing a lot of platformers and survival/crafting games. I'll play a bit of everything, though, except for, like, sports games.

I love tabletop games. Star Wars Legion, Warhammer 40K/AoS, Magic: The Gathering, Pok√©mon TCG, Digimon TCG, Lorcana, and Star Wars Unlimited. I love to paint miniatures as well, but it's a bit of a struggle to actually get people to play with me. I never really got the chance to play any TTRPGs, but I would love to.

I suffer from a bit of a learning curve. Certified dyslexic.

I love music. Dance Gavin Dance, Papa Roach, Twenty-One Pilots, A Day To Remember, stuff like that. Bit of an elder emo. I wish I could play an instrument, but I fear I may be tone deaf üôÉ

I love Marvel. Spider-Man's probably my favorite. Though in recent years, I've been growing to appreciate DC a lot more than I did before.

I love Harry Potter. I'm pretty sure my house is Hufflepuff.

Huge fan of The Office (US). I've seen the whole series countless times.

I love horror movies and got into true crime on YouTube a few years ago. My favorite horror movie is The Blair Witch Project, second to the 2003 Texas Chainsaw Massacre.

I love anime and manga. Demon Slayer is by far my favorite. I also really love Fullmetal Alchemist, Attack on Titan, Digimon, Dragon Ball, Dandadan, and Sword Art Online.

Love LEGO. Most of my sets are from Harry Potter, but I have some from Star Wars and The Office set. I also have some Nano blocks.

I'm doin' the Japanese, Spanish, and music courses on Duolingo right now.

I love baking, coffee, and grilling. I don't have too much confidence in my cooking skills üòÖ But I'm trying new recipes all the time, and I've been getting better! I'm rather adept at baking, though, and I love smoked meats ü§§

My mom and I have had a rocky relationship for most of my life. She's rude, narcissistic, mentally and emotionally abusive, fights over absolutely everything, and just kind of a bad person? I don't know, I feel bad thinking it and worse typing it. This is gonna be long, but here we go Reddit!

I told my mother recently that I was planning on moving out to live with my boyfriend in about a year/year and a half. This will give me time to save from my current job and him time to save as well. 

For some reason, I genuinely don't know why, she thinks she'll be moving with us. Ask me 6 months ago and I would have been fine with it, ask me now, and I'm very hesitant. (I would also like to mention my boyfriend said he'd prefer the two of us but would back me up no matter my choice about her living with us) She's disabled (she still has full motion, can walk, do basic chores, that sort of thing) and doesn't have an income outside of SSI benefits. She doesn't do anything around the house, despite being able to at least help a little bit every day. She has baskets of clothes everywhere, moldy dishes in her room, papers, bottles, and a bunch of other shit all over the place. She's told me she will hit my children (when I have them, currently childless) told me I can't wear white to my wedding, told me what to name my children, has told me she wants to hurt me physically but won't, tells me how to spend my money, yells at me daily, has told me what people and pets I'm allowed to have in my home, she makes fun of my boyfriend, she tells me what I can and can't do with my cat, she took pictures of me in short shorts and a sports bra freshman year of high school so she could see how my body changed as I aged, she has said if we weren't related she would want to have sex with me, and she ditched me at work because she ""just sat down to eat"" when I was 16 (it was dark, cold, and scary) then did the same thing when was 18 and there was literally snow and ice everywhere. This isn't everything she's done, but I'm trying to give context. 

The breaking point was a few days ago. We got into a fight about politics. She asked why democrats only vote for democrats (and vise versa for republicans) and when I explained why that usually was, she flipped the fuck out screaming that it didn't make any sense and was stupid and shouldn't be that way. Preach I guess but I have no control over American politics. Then she said my boyfriend's cat couldn't live with us because her cats wouldn't like him. I said ""his cat will never be here don't worry"" and she looked confused, saying she thought his cat would go with him when we moved. I said ""his cat will but I don't have time in my life for this, for you acting like this"" and she went off saying I was a horrible person and I wanted to watch her fail. I don't, but if thats what it takes for her to realize that this is wrong and I won't tolerate it, I guess I'll pour myself some coffee and watch. 

I donate blood, I work 16 hour days, I help in soup kitchens for the homeless, I help out at animal shelters, I pay over half the rent and everything else. I'm not a bad person, I'm just wondering if I'm out of line for what I said, for not allowing her in my future home, or around my future children without supervision.

Silas grew up in a small quiet town, where appearance mattered more than truth. His father was around, but he was cold, distant and very strict. His mother was timid, fragile and very frail. The kind of woman to put on a smile even through the roughest terrain. Growing up he was like every other young boy. Happy and playful, a real jokester. But into his teen hood he began to change, he wouldn't say for the worse but definitely not for the better if you asked others around him. He began to blend into the background, remembering people's routines without realizing. Who took which bus after school, where they liked to sit, their habits during breaks or lunch. What made them smile. He began to feel off from his peers, not having the biggest emotions towards friends or family. Besides his mother of course. He had his first love at the age of 16. But that ended after only a few short months. She was scared of him, the things he'd say or do. She told him he knew more about her than she knew herself. So she broke things off which caused him to spiral. He got into fights in and out of school constantly when he noticed someone getting close to his love. To the point he got expelled, the only high school in Silverbriar BC, he decided to move out after his fathers constant drinking and torment. Leaving his mother behind yet he still regrets not bringing her with him. One rainy night Silas was sitting outside on the steps of ‚ÄúIvory & Ash‚Äù his knuckles split and bleeding. Silas was found by Evie Macken, the widowed owner. She brought him inside, offered him tea and a job carrying heavy things in and out of the store. The quiet shop gave him peace at last. Ivory & Ash became more than just a job. Through Evie's connections, some clients brought in rare and even unregistered antiques tied to the darker corners of the town and beyond. When jobs needed to be done, Evie would give Silas a signal by leaving an ivory horse figurine on the top of the cash register, allowing him to ‚Äòhandle things‚Äô others wouldn't dare to deal with or even want to be associated with. The shop's locked back room doubled as a safe haven for Silas, to store tools, or stash items collected on the ‚Äòjob‚Äô. The second hand goods provided a perfect cover to move stolen valuables through Evie's network.

Profile Appearance

Appearance: Silas has pale ghostly skin as he barely sees the light of day. Thick dark brown almost black hair that slightly drapes into his face, his hairstyle like a modern greaser without any product. He has a neck tattoo of a raven flying, its head wrapped around his neck and its wings/ body on his shoulder. He has an eyebrow slit on his left eye which he decided to do the day he memorized Lilienne's face seeing her beauty mark. Deep brown eyes narrow and animalistic with a sense of calm in his face. A little scary on his upper lip causing his lips to always be a tiny bit parted.

Build: Silas is 6 '2 and relatively fit. A muscular natural build with patchwork tattoos ranging from his chest, back, waist and his right arm and hands.

Clothing Style: Prefers dark, well-fitted clothing; black wool coats, worn leather jackets, cuffed sleeves showing forearm tattoos. Crisp, button-down shirts. Heavy boots, even in the rain. Always dresses with intention.. ‚Äònothing is careless.‚Äô

Favourite Color: Lilac purple, black, deep blue

Aesthetic: Dim streetlamps in the rain, cigarette smoke curling in cold air, rough hands resting on old wood, pressed lilac petals between the pages of an antique book.

Materialistic likes: Ivory chess pieces, old pocket watches, fountain pens, vintage revolvers, leather-bound journals, rare pressed flowers.

Voice and mannerisms: Speaks in a low, even tone. rarely raises his voice. Often tilts his head slightly when studying someone, as if dissecting every detail. Holds prolonged eye contact, rarely blinking until the other person looks away. Moves deliberately, never rushed even when others might hurry.",2,1755139695.0,WritingHub,0,1.0,False
1mpomtr,https://www.reddit.com/r/HomeKit/comments/1mpomtr/automate_espresso_machine_but_which/,Automate espresso machine‚Ä¶ but which?,"There‚Äôs various posts, in this sub and elsewhere, about automating coffee machines. The idea is simple:
‚Ä¢ Connect the coffee machine to a smart plug.
‚Ä¢ Leave the machine‚Äôs power switch on.
‚Ä¢ When your automation runs ‚Äî for example, after you dismiss your wake-up alarm ‚Äî the smart plug turns on and coffee is served.

I did just that for my Moccamaster, a drip coffee machine usually recommended by these posts for automation, and it works great!

Of course, at the end of the automation, the coffee machine has to then *stop* making coffee. This is not a problem for most drip coffee machines (including the Moccamaster) since they‚Äôll stop on their own. But I‚Äôm thinking of switching from drip coffee to espresso. So I‚Äôm wondering which espresso machine both (1) is switch-based, not button-based, so I can automate it using a smart plug; and (2) will stop pouring coffee on its own. 

My possibly incorrect understanding is that most switch-based espresso machines will make espresso until the switch is flipped off. Or, at least, that‚Äôs what I gathered from the instruction video for the Gaggia Classic Pro.

Most videos of automated espresso machines I‚Äôve seen so far use a button-based espresso machine and a SwitchBot button pusher. So if I go this alternate route I‚Äôd have to get a SwitchBot button busher + the hub so I can use it through HomeKit. Which also works, of course, it just might not be the ideal solution.

Anyway, has anyone had any success automating an espresso machine? Any tips are appreciated. Thanks!!",1,1755139591.0,HomeKit,0,1.0,False

My go-to recipe is the 210ml-15g-2min one, and I just tweak the steep time (either 3, 5, or 8) if I want different notes/profiles (eg 8mins give me more nuance, 3 and 5 for more kick and body). 

That said - I usually have two of those.

- Does it make sense to use 30g with 210ml while brewing, then just add the 210ml after brewing?
- Won't the smaller water column (proportion-wise) mean there's less extraction happening (and/or I'm just wasting beans since there's less water per gram of coffee)? 
- with these amounts, does it mean I have to steep for 5mins minimum to get the same amount of extraction?

Why do people do this...","For the past few years I've been looking for a multi-unit property in Chicago's Logan Square neighborhood. It's a neighborhood full of historic buildings, deep rooted cultures, vibrant restaurants and independent coffee shops. On the flip side, however, this also means its attracted hoards of real estate development and 'luxury' seeking clientele. I've seen flip after flip of architecturally significant buildings turned into tasteless white and grey boxes. These ""developers"" will rip out all of the original wood trim, stained glass, built-ins, mosaic tiles, wood doors, hardware, etc. The list goes on...

Today, I stumbled across this landmark 'two-flat', Chicago slang for a multi-unit building with two units. It was put on the market for the the first time in over 50 years (in 2017) and sold for $950K. Low and behold, just like the thousands of others before it, it was listed this week for $1.875M without any of its original character and charm. Literally every original aspect of it has been thoughtlessly ripped out and replaced with 'x, y, and z' from aisle 12 at Home Depot.

For a brief moment, I tried online dating (29F), and while I know it works out perfectly for some people, I just felt like it wasn't my thing, so I quit. Instead, I focused my energy on people who truly cared about me (and who I cared about), as well as on myself. Life got much more interesting, and I felt a lot happier.

Then, unexpectedly, I started meeting nice people in random places (the gym, cafes, on the street, etc). I was flattered, but I politely declined if I didn‚Äôt feel the click. I didn‚Äôt want to waste anyone‚Äôs time if I wasn‚Äôt genuinely interested.

One day, I was at a cafe (with my sister) when a guy sat next to me as I was leaving and commented on the book I was reading. He recommended another book, which happened to be one of my all-time favorites. We discovered we‚Äôd both studied philosophy, he seemed genuinely kind.

Since my sister and I had a table booked, I told him I had to go. As we parted ways, we shared an awkward smile, saying maybe we‚Äôd see each other again. As I walked out, I realized ‚Äî¬†*I shouldn‚Äôt be complaining about dating if I‚Äôm not willing to take a chance myself.*

So I ripped a page from my journal, scribbled my name and number (rewrote it a few times because my hands were literally shaking), and went back in. I told him to text me if he‚Äôd like to get coffee, and I admitted I‚Äôd never done this before (which was probably VERY obvious). He seemed happy (i think/hope) and showed me he was looking up the book I‚Äôd recommended.

He texted me, and we set a coffee date for after I got back from a trip with my sister. I decided not to text too much before the meeting. However, the day before our date, my flight was cancelled due to the weather (my flights NEVER get cancelled!). I texted to say I couldn‚Äôt make it, but that I‚Äôd love to reschedule if he‚Äôs still up for it. Now I‚Äôm writing this while spending the night at the airport, waiting for a 6am flightüôÉ. Even if I had gone on the date, it might have turned out to be nothing, or maybe he wasn‚Äôt that interested anyway ‚Äî so I‚Äôm probably just fantasizing (and now spiraling a little since I have so much time at the airport lol). Either way, I‚Äôm glad I took the chance.

**Long story short:**  
Please don‚Äôt miss your chance. There‚Äôs nothing to lose by making a move. Even if plans don‚Äôt work out, at least you‚Äôll know you tried.

Dating can feel exhausting, but it also depends on you. I‚Äôm still somewhere along the journey, figuring things out as I go. I am genuinely coming to realize that finding ‚Äúthe one‚Äù isn‚Äôt the goal; it‚Äôs about learning to grow on your own, making yourself happy, and having the capability to do so. If someone comes along, that‚Äôs wonderful, but it‚Äôs not the destination. Approaching him reminded me that I need to take the wheel in my own life, and that taking action is part of that growth.

It's like she wants to find a way to reach out in hopes of rekindling the relationship. It's this part specifically that is so desperate and sad to me, as she has a long term partner and according to these mutual acquaintances, she has made these comments in front of him. It's also sad for her boyfriend to be with someone who is openly pining for their ex. 

Neither of us have confronted her or asked her to stop being a creep, because it will only fuel the fire. According to mutual acquaintances, former friends of hers, and my husband she would love knowing that she is creeping us out and buckle down ever harder, like a child seeing they got a reaction so they continue the behavior.

For example, running into my husbands ex coworker, telling him that she knows about A,B,&C because she knows that he will then call my husband and tell him about the weird stuff she said.

\- We stayed at [Hotel Kokoro](https://kokoro.hotelsinalajuela.com/en/?from=2025-08-14&to=2025-08-15&adults=2&children=0&clirder=1), which was gorgeous. The grounds are so lush and there's a lot to explore - there's mineral springs on site, a pool, a frog pond, and a small hiking trail. We loved just walking around. Their breakfast offering was really tasty, I looked forward to it every morning. They also offered a dinner buffet for an additional cost, which we did when we arrived because we were so tired and hungry. The hotel staff is really kind and helpful. Its a family run place. The cabins have an old-school rustic feel (all wood interiors) and I thought they were very charming! We ended up with a beautiful view of the Arenal volcano from our front step.

**2. Day 2: La Fortuna**

\- We started the day with a coffee/cacao tour at [North Fields,](https://www.northfieldscr.com/tour/) which was great! The tour lasted about 2.5-3 hours in total. The tour takes you throughout their entire facility and there are different 'stations' along the way where they'll demonstrate things or pass around samples. We sampled multiple different kinds of coffee, cacao fruit, sugarcane juice, and chocolates of all different levels (60-90% cocoa). Our tour guide was really informative and friendly. It was very sunny for our tour but there's coverage in the huts and some of the activities are indoors, so you could do it on a rainier day.

\- We visited the [La Fortuna Waterfall](https://www.cataratalafortuna.com/) in the afternoon and it was POURING. We got completely drenched, but it was still fun. It takes about 15 mins to hike down to the viewpoint and 30 mins to hike back up. We bought tickets day-of.

\- We had dinner in town at Organico which was pretty tasty! We capped off the day with an impromptu couples massage at Kinereth. We were able to walk in and be seen quickly, but if you're after a particular time, I'd call in advance.

**3. Day 3: La Fortuna**

**-** We started the day with a hike on the Las Coladas trail on the [Arenal 1968](https://arenalvolcanopark.com/parks/arenal-volcano-park/) paths. The weather held and we got there and back without getting rained on! We also saw a coati in the parking lot and an eyelash pit viper on our walk back.

\- Since the weather was holding up, we beelined it to [Mistico Hanging Bridges ](https://misticopark.com/)and also felt lucky to make it through the whole thing without drizzles! We managed to see a poison dart frog on the way out, but otherwise didn't catch much wildlife. The bridges are pretty cool.

\- We booked a night reservation + dinner at [EcoTermales.](https://arenalvolcanopark.com/tours/eco-termales-hot-springs-2/) We were warned at our hotel not to dunk our heads underwater at any hot spring, especially not a mineral spring, so we didn't, but we ran into someone the next day who was freaking out because she was doing handstands underwater and stuff. so...don't do that! It was busy, but not packed, so we were able to go between pools without having to wait. Dinner has a ton of different types of food available and it's buffet style as well. It wasn't my favorite, but it was convenient. The watermelon and pineapple juice was pretty solid. The facility is nice, the waterfalls in the super hot pools are pretty relaxing, and its a good time if you wanna just chill out and soak with a cocktail in your hand.

**4. Day 4: La Fortuna -> Monteverde**

\- We booked a Jeep/Boat/Jeep ride to Monteverde through [Arenal Rides](https://arenalrides.com/). A lot of people here recommend Carlos and I could see why! He was awesome and really responsive. One person asked 'wait, its not a jeep?' so again, feels worth noting that it's more like van/boat/van, but that's not really important. All three rides were efficient and quick. I was impressed with how well our driver navigated the craggy roads in Monteverde. They also stopped for a break so people could get a snack/use the bathroom.

\- We stayed at [Natura hotel](https://naturahotelmonteverde.com/) which was great for our needs. Initially we were like 'oh no there's no AC!' but we didn't miss it. There was a fan in our room which was helpful. The hotel staff and I communicated on Whatsapp if/when we needed something and they were great with helping us get rides to some of our activities. We had breakfast there every day, which they sent us options for the night before and asked us to choose.

\- We ate at Orchid Cafe which was AWESOME. Would totally go back. We stopped by Cafe Monteverde afterwards for coffee and it was delicious. We hailed a cab at the taxi depot out front and it was very quick and painless.

\- We got a couples massage at the [Monteverde Massage Center](https://monteverdemassagecenter.com/about-massage-center), booked through Whatsapp. It was sooooo good. My legs were so sore from all the hikes and the two massage therapists were incredible. Yolanda found every single knot and was an absolute sweetheart.

**5. Day 5: Monteverde**

\- We started the day with a guided tour of [Monteverde Cloud Forest Preserve](https://cloudforestmonteverde.com/home/). We booked directly through the preserve, so we were assigned a guide at random. It's crazy how knowledgeable the guides are and how they can sense whether wildlife is nearby. We were lucky to see a coati, lots of birds, a cool millipede, an agouti, and a walking stick bug.

\- We had lunch at Soda Shangri-la, which was SO good. The black bean empanada will haunt me forever. The casado was fantastic and the whole meal was super affordable.

\- We ended the day with a night walk at the [Wildlife Refuge](https://refugiomonteverdecr.com/) (also booked through the preserve). There was a shuttle that took us there and back included in the price. Our guide was great and so determined to find all different kinds of creatures. He also offered to take photos through his scope and our group shared them with each other so we all got kickass high res pics. We saw a sloth feeding her baby, a porcupine, a walking stick bug, a leaf mimic katydid, a snail eater snake, a green pit viper, some wolf spiders (nope), a toucan, a green parrot, a few other birds, a meadow tree frog, and a red eyed frog. It ruled.

**6. Day 6: Monteverde**

\- We intentionally left the day open to just explore as we saw fit. We had brunch at Orchid Cafe again, coffee at Cafe Monteverde, and just took it easy.

\- We had a later dinner reservation booked at [San Lucas ](https://sanlucas.cr/menusanlucas/ingles.pdf)so we tried to stay hungry until we arrived. It was a 9 course menu, definitely the fanciest and most involved 'dining experience' we've ever had. Each course is themed around one of the provinces (with 2 courses themed around Monteverde, first and last). You can tell that everyone working there is really passionate about what they do and wants to make sure you have a great meal. The setting is beautiful, you get an amazing view of the city, and the meal was really tasty. They took our photo and gave us a copy as well as a 'passport', a copy of our menu, and a little bag of coffee from a local vendor.

**7. Day 7: Monteverde -> San Jose**

\- We had breakfast at the hotel and then it was time to go back to San Jose! We booked a private transfer through Arenal Rides (Carlos is the best!!!) and our driver was such a nice guy. He pointed out lots of lovely views along the way and was a very smooth, skilled driver. I was sure to give him a big tip when we arrived in San Jose.

\- We picked a hotel by the airport just for convenience and stayed at the Marriott. The hotel restaurant was surprisingly great?? I ordered a casado and asked for it without meat and they took extra care with my meal to add some falafel bites and tofu in addition to the usual offerings. It was really good! Breakfast was also solid.

\- We met a friend in town in San Jose for dinner at a vegan restaurant, Sokko Happy Food - it was a little tricky to get an Uber but we managed to find one! Dinner was decent and well priced.

**8. Day 8: Leave San Jose**

\- Our hotel offered a free shuttle to the airport every 15 minutes, which we took advantage of. I have to say, the San Jose airport is INCREDIBLY efficient on the departures end. We went from front door to our gate in 20 minutes. A pretty smooth trip all things considered.

Rainy season tips:

* If you're traveling in the rainy season, bring a dry bag!!!!! You won't need it on the lighter drizzle times, but when the rain is hard, it is HARD and your devices/valuables WILL get wet.
* If you have a waterproof bag - not water resistant - I'd bring it as well. I used this [Osprey day pack](https://www.osprey.com/ultralight-dry-stuff-pack-drypkul20ls23-550?size=O%2FS&color=Waterfront+Blue&utm_source=google&utm_medium=cpc&utm_campaign=2024-03-01_kw_na_travel_na_multi_osp_travel_na_na_na_multi_na_na_na_na_dtc_na_na&gad_source=1&gad_campaignid=20554262788&gbraid=0AAAAADDMh1qzGpb95Xg6xcLxCwdW90_YA&gclid=CjwKCAjw7_DEBhAeEiwAWKiCC9ccyYxuqYLNEDuQkbrKcXY5eRVG396D52y6EvY04Ss-B8e-ohb88xoCLmwQAvD_BwE) and put the dry bag inside. Everything stayed dry!
* A waterproof - again, not water resistant - rainjacket is a must. We put our rain jackets in our backpacks every time we left the house.
* Bring a backup pair of closed toe shoes in case yours get drenched. We didn't have a great way for my husband to dry his first pair out and it took all week for them to finally dry. I brought Tevas and my running shoes, and I made it out ok!
* Pack something for wet clothes - whether its just a plastic bag, a ziploc, etc - its worth it to have on hand for going between destinations.

General tips:

* If you're not renting a car, you can get around La Fortuna with Ubers. There is no Lyft, only Uber. There were plenty of Ubers and they were not very expensive.
* In Monteverde, you cannot use Uber. However, there is a local taxi service (dark red cars) that you can use to get around. There is a taxi depot in downtown Santa Elena (across the street from Cafe Monteverde) but if you need to get a ride, you can ask your hotel/establishment to help you get a taxi.
* In San Jose, you CAN use Ubers. Some areas might take a bit longer than others, but we were able to make it work.
* If you're going to Monteverde pack a sweater/sweatshirt/long sleeve or something and a pair of long pants. It's definitely cooler!
* If you're vegan/can't have dairy, I noticed a lot of places were more likely to carry almond milk than any other type of non dairy milk. If you were lucky, there would be oat or soy, but it seemed less frequent.
* While we didn't get bit by anything, if you're going on a deep hike and bugs tend to like you, I'd definitely pack bug spray. I picked up the OFF! wipes with Deet and they worked great. We didn't get bit once!
* When your tours say 'wear long pants' or 'wear closed toed shoes' - please heed their advice! We saw a couple of people show up in shorts and get bit by some insect or another. Our guide also was clear that we should let him hike ahead and follow behind so he could scout ahead for any animals on the trail or anything dangerous. Don't go off script!
* If there's a particular animal or sight you want to see - do some research ahead of time to find out when or where you might be able to spot it. Showing up on a daytime tour expecting to see a nocturnal animal is kind of a dick move.
* Eat at sodas if and when you can! They're super awesome and great value for money!
* If you're planning to use cash I'd carry around a mix of dollars and colones. Some places only took one or the other. We used cards if/when we could, but between my husband and I we always made sure one of us had at least 5000 colones on hand.
* I saw/see a lot of posts on here about safety - never once did I feel unsafe. I've lived in New York my whole life, so I have a pretty good idea of how to conduct myself and not get my shit rocked, but nobody approached us or tried anything shady. We stowed our valuables in our hotel rooms like we do on all of our trips, and it was totally fine. 
* I had a very silly preconceived notion that in the deeper areas there would be bugs everywhere and spiders galore - I only saw them at night, and sparingly. I'm very arachnophobic so I was nervous about this, but there was nothing to fear. When we spotted wolf spiders on our night tour, I just steered clear and pulled up the hood of my jacket. They're not gonna mess with you. And there were no critters in any of our hotel rooms, save for one or two geckos which were actually kind of cute and funny. You'll be okay! 

It was a fantastic trip. I can't wait to go back and see more, maybe visit Limon and some of the other provinces!",5,1755138916.0,CostaRicaTravel,0,1.0,False

I have been watching Charlotte's videos for years, but never have I thought to be the one writing. I'm sorry in advance if I don't make perfect sense that English is not my first language nor my second. And buckle up this will be a looooong one. 

First some context:

I (35f) am from an Asian country and work in a government organization for 5 years. At work I am kinda famous for the girl who never date coworkers. It is one of my principals. (important for later) Well, fast forward 3 years ago I met a guy (50m) at work who is 100% my type. I was speechless and I was sure that my heart skipped beat when I saw him. I have never seen a guy like him instead of in my dreams. But I figured he is married due to our age gap. Since then we communicated only professionally. Never out of work hour or anything more than work related subjects. Even though I had a huge crush on him after a year I have stopped having a crush on him. I just respected him professionally and looked up to him. 

Then Last Christmas happened something strange. He texted me wishing a merry Christmas and happy new year. That was so unordinary for him to do. We have never exchanged any wishes for any holidays before. I replied him wishing the same but kept my words short and professional. After new year we worked on the project together. After the team meeting a friend of mine slipped that he divorced his wife due to infidelity. (his wife cheated) I didn't know what I should do with that information. So I just brushed it off. Then one day he asked me to go out with him for a coffee. I said no. I said we are colleagues and that's all. He said it's work related and not a date. And I told him then we should grab a coffee at work, during work hours. He agreed. Couple of days passed and we met up for a coffee at work caf√©. He confessed. He said he saw me before we met. And he just fell in love with me. He said that I was his dream for years. But he never could have made a move on me because of my ""no dating coworker"" thing. He said he was just looking after me from a distance for all these years without my knowledge. But since we started working on this project together he could not maintain the professional communication any longer and he had to confess. I was shocked. And TBH bit happy to know my ex-crush has a crush on me. I told him I appreciate his honesty but I will not engage in any further communication not work related. He told me he understands. And respects my wish. I was crashed to reject him. For the love of god, he is the perfect guy IMO. After that meeting things seemed normal. He was just normal with me at work. Then something started. I started receiving gifts at work via delivery. When I asked the delivery driver who is this gift from the driver always says it‚Äôs anonymous. I suspected it could be him but he was just normal just like before. So I was confused. Then the barista of the work caf√© started delivering me my favorite coffee to my office. When I asked her who is it from she just shrugged and said it was from someone who adores you. After second coffee I told her thank you and please do not bring me anymore again. She assured me to not bring coffee again. And it stopped. But the flower and gifts did not stop. Over a month I received so many gifts without knowing the sender. It was exhausting.

And then one Friday when I was leaving work he was outside. He politely told me have a nice weekend. I told him the same. He then asked if I could give him a ride. It was strange that he never asked me such thing before. I asked if it was normal he said yes just a ride. I agreed. He said he was going to one place near my place. Mind you my place is one and half hour away from work. In the beginning of the ride he was just asking my work related questions. And then he slipped ‚Äúhow I liked his gifts? And is wondering why I rejected coffee offers due to I drink a lot of coffee during a day?‚Äù I was honest with him. I told him that I suspected that was from him. That‚Äôs why I told the barista to not bring me coffee anymore. For the gifts I have no power to reject due to delivery system. He said he just wanted to make sure I drink my favorite coffee and have cute gifts to get me through my tough work day. Then we talked sincerely for the whole ride. It was nice. When we arrived at his destination he asked me out for a proper date. I said yes. During the first date I asked him about his marriage situation. He said he is divorced. And he has a 9 year old boy. I told him to be truly honest with me regarding his marriage. And I asked him to be professional with me at work and separating our relationship from work. He agreed. After two months into our relationship it was just perfect. We were professional colleagues at work. And had a great relationship. We were so similar and compatible that once I thought he might be my soulmate.

He was so careful and thoughtful of me throughout our relationship. He is kind of tough guy at work but well respected. But when he is with me he is so kind and soft with me. He always told me that he is obsessed with me. And he thinks that I am his soulmate. And at that time I thought that‚Äôs kinda cute. But after a half year things started to escalate. He started to talk about future. He was really good to me. I told him I feel the same as him and I am seeing a future with him. Then he dropped the bomb. He said he is still in the divorce situation with his wife. I was shocked. I told him that he said he already divorced! He said well he isn‚Äôt living with his wife more than a year now. And they have a boy who is 9 now. So they constantly connect with each other regarding of their child. I told him I understand that he has to keep the communication with his wife regarding his child. But if he is not fully divorced yet I don‚Äôt feel comfortable to be with him. I told him we should take a break and stay no contact until everything settles. He was crashed but he said he understood where I stand. So we separated. After two weeks he reached out to me saying no contact is killing him. And he already made his decision to divorce his wife long before we started seeing each other. So there is no problem to us continuing our relationship. I told him I feel like an affair partner for him during his divorce. That‚Äôs why we need to have a time-out. He said he understands my feeling but wants to have a normal communication with me during this time-out. I told him no. Because if we stayed in contact and not seeing each other feels like a torture for me. He said he will keep our conversation professionally and friendly. Not anything more. I told him we could try. And for another two weeks his messages were normal. Friendly and professional. Occasionally taking care of me. But his work performance drastically dropped. And started to look worn out all the time at work. Then one day he just bombarded me with messages. That he misses me, losing his mind over time-out, cannot concentrate without me. Long story short he was losing it. And I told him if he doesn‚Äôt stop texting me more than what we discussed prior I will cut any further contact with him and break up with him then and there. After that text he told me he will try low contact again. Then few days later same thing happened. And now I am not sure anymore. I feel like he is keeping me in hook for feeling guilty for his poor performance at work, and distracting behaver. I am not saying that I am feeling great either. I feel unlucky, less loved, self-doubt after the break. I miss him a lot too. But I am trying to maintain my principle to not to be his side during his divorce procedure.

I am writing this hoping to see any advice what should I do in this circumstance. Also as I was writing this he sent me a voice message of him singing a song about lost love and crying. And he told me I am being too harsh on him and on us. So AITAH for giving not wanting to keep our relationship?",1,1755138891.0,CharlotteDobreYouTube,2,1.0,False
1mpod7p,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1mpod7p/my_husbands_ex_wont_stop_stalking_us/,My Husbands Ex Won't Stop Stalking Us,"So as in the title me (39F) and my husband (45M) got married earlier this year and have 2 children together. Prior to our relationship he was with this woman (45 ish? F) who I'll refer to as Mary. They were together for 10 years, then we met about a year after they split and we are really happy together. Shortly after they split she moved on with someone else and they've been together since as well. 

The reason for this post is that she will not stop stalking us. We've moved 4 times and every time she finds out where we live. From mutual acquaintances we find out that she knows all sorts of life events, even though my husband never posts on his social media (His last post was 2 years ago and it was a general meme share) and I don't even have any social media accounts. She makes comments to people about how she misses him and regrets breaking up with him, specifically to people who she knows will tell us about it. It's like she wants to find a way to reach out in hopes of rekindling the relationship. It's this part specifically that is so desperate and sad to me, as she has a long term partner and according to these mutual acquaintances, she has made these comments in front of him. It's also sad for her boyfriend to be with someone who is openly pining for their ex. 

Neither of us have confronted her or asked her to stop being a creep, because it will only fuel the fire. According to mutual acquaintances, former friends of hers, and my husband she would love knowing that she is creeping us out and buckle down ever harder, like a child seeing they got a reaction so they continue the behavior.  But it's just becoming so annoying, I have no fear of her, she's not dangerous, just pathetic and obsessive, as she's been doing this for 4 years now. There are no grounds for a restraining order, as she doesn't do anything with the information, just makes it known that she knows about our lives to people she knows will tell us. For example, running into my husbands ex coworker, telling him that she knows about A,B,&C because she knows that he will then call my husband and tell him about the weird stuff she said. 

I'm shocked that this is even happening at our age, this is middle school level drama. 

Any advice on how to deal with this situation is much appreciated. We've kept our heads down for years, stayed quiet, been careful who and what we shared with, and honestly shrunk our lives in an effort to get away from her, but she will not let up. I don't understand her obsession, or ways to get her to leave us alone. We're honestly quiet, keep to ourselves, work, schools, daily routines type of people. There's not even juicy drama to gossip about, big news in our family is finding a new favorite coffee creamer. 

  
Any advice or insight on how to deal with this person and ideally get her to leave us alone would be so so appreciated. ",2,1755138824.0,BreakUps,0,1.0,False

Had joint pain and stomach issues since I was 10. Over the years developed multiple food intolerances (now can‚Äôt eat wheat, dairy, corn, tomatoes, coffee, chocolate, soy, peanuts). Multiple doctors, normal tests except gastritis. SIBO breath test negative but have all symptoms. Antibiotics once made me feel great temporarily. Now dealing with reflux, bloating, rashes, fatigue, nutrient deficiencies, and joint pain. Insurance won‚Äôt cover rifaximin. Looking for others who‚Äôve been through this or found solutions.

-----------------------------------

When I was around 10, I had really bad joint pain (to the point where I could barely walk) and bad stomach problems. My mom took me to a chiropractor who did that weird muscle test where you hold bottles in one hand (with wheat, corn, etc.) and they push down on your arm. If they can push it down, you ‚Äúreact‚Äù to that food. After that, I stopped eating wheat and dairy, and my problems went away.

That worked for a while, but as I got older more foods started to bother me again. At 16, a new doctor ran stool tests, parasite checks, autoimmune panels, and thyroid tests ‚Äî all normal. She gave me antibiotics and for a short time I felt amazing (clear skin, no stomach pain), but at the end of taking them I started getting rashes.

Now I can‚Äôt eat wheat, dairy, corn, tomatoes, coffee, chocolate, soy, peanuts, or anything derived from those without feeling awful. Recently, I went to a GI doctor who did a colonoscopy and endoscopy, and the only finding was gastritis. SIBO breath test was negative (even though I have all the symptoms). She wants to try rifaximin, but my insurance rejected it and it‚Äôs $2000 out of pocket.

My current symptoms:

Acid reflux & heartburn Gas, bloating, burping Food intolerances/sensitivities Stomach pain, cramping, nausea Diarrhea & constipation Itchy rashes & acne Fatigue Slight weight gain Joint pain Headaches Nutritional deficiencies (iron, vitamin D, B12, magnesium, etc.)

I feel like I‚Äôm slowly losing the ability to eat almost anything without a reaction, and no one can tell me why. I'm starting to get desperate, and pretty much only eat chicken, rice, and potatoes at this point. And they have to be completely plain or it bothers my gastritis or one of my food intolerances. I don't even want to eat at this point, and it feels like I'm starting to feel these symptoms worse and worse for eating even just one bite of chicken that has a slight dot of ketchup or something.

The lab hummed like a throat clearing. Emergency lights washed the benches in a dim green, and the smell of cold metal and coffee lingered over the glassware. Lina twenty-eight, tired from the week but electric tonight clicked the door shut behind her and lifted the roll-down blind. Rain rattled the windows. On the far bench, Tomas turned, the edge of his grin caught by the glow.

‚ÄúYou kept the key,‚Äù he said.

‚ÄúYou kept the playlist,‚Äù she answered, nodding at the small speaker buried between a stack of lab notebooks. A soft piano looped, warm and low.

They hadn‚Äôt seen each other in a year, not really. Conferences had turned into different cities, ambition into different time zones. But the alumni weekend had pulled them back to the same campus‚Äîand, somehow, to this room where they‚Äôd once argued over solvents and futures with equal heat.

Lina tugged off her coat and draped it over a stool. ‚ÄúOne hour before security does rounds,‚Äù she said, glancing at the clock. ‚ÄúWhat do we do with it?‚Äù

Tomas lifted a beaker as if toasting her. ‚ÄúWe stop pretending we don‚Äôt know how to measure what matters.‚Äù

She tried to hide a smile, failed, and walked the length of the bench, fingertips skimming labels she could still recite from memory. He watched her the way he used to watch data stabilize‚Äîcareful, patient, a little amazed as it settled into clarity.

‚ÄúDo you ever miss it?‚Äù he asked.

‚ÄúThe lab?‚Äù She shrugged. ‚ÄúSometimes. The precision. The clean borders. Life outside doesn‚Äôt have many.‚Äù

He nodded. ‚ÄúOut there feels like guesswork.‚Äù His voice softened. ‚ÄúUs, too.‚Äù

The hood fan ticked. Somewhere, a drip from a drying rack counted seconds. Lina stopped at the gap in the bench where he stood and reached for his sleeve. It was damp from the rain. He didn‚Äôt move away.

‚ÄúI thought about calling,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt know if I‚Äôd be a detour.‚Äù

He laughed under his breath. ‚ÄúYou were the destination.‚Äù

The sentence landed between them like a light being switched on. She felt it in her stomach, warm and a little dizzying. Tomas set the beaker down and folded the distance. When he touched her face, it wasn‚Äôt a question so much as a confirmation of something both of them had already chosen.

The first kiss was quiet, steady as a baseline. The second was not. She felt the week drain out of her shoulders; he tasted like mint and rain. The green light made their skin look like a secret. She slid her hands under his jacket, and he drew her closer until the lab coats on the hooks swung and whispered. The piano on the speaker found a pulse; the night outside pressed its ear to the glass.

‚ÄúTell me we‚Äôre not inventing this,‚Äù he murmured against her temple.

‚ÄúWe‚Äôre replicating a result,‚Äù she said, and he laughed, and she loved that she could make him do that‚Äîstill.

They broke apart just enough to look at each other, to take stock the way they would before a big run. His brow was softer than she remembered; her hair was a little shorter; both of them were none of the things they‚Äôd feared they‚Äôd become. Grown, yes. Hardened, not quite.

‚ÄúStay,‚Äù he said. It wasn‚Äôt a command. It was a line on a whiteboard she could erase or circle.

‚ÄúFor tonight,‚Äù she said. Then, after a breath, ‚ÄúAnd then‚Ä¶we‚Äôll see.‚Äù

He nodded like a promise. The rain picked up, a hush turning into applause. Tomas reached past her to flick off the overhead strip. The room fell almost dark except for the emergency glow and the city smudge beyond the windows. The world narrowed to breath and heartbeat and the small geography of two people who remembered exactly where the other‚Äôs gravity lay.

They kissed again, slower, as if savoring a familiar experiment with a better protocol. Her hands found his shoulders; his found the small of her back. A rack of empty vials chimed as their hips nudged the bench. She laughed into his mouth; he caught it like something precious.

The rest of it belonged to the closed door and the rain: the way they moved by touch and instinct, how the music thinned and rose, how they learned again the map they‚Äôd drawn years ago. When the piano finally faded, the room held only their breathing and the soft clink of settling glass.

Later, the clock would surprise them. The rain would ease. They would step back into their coats, out into the corridor, and the future would be waiting like a long, unmarked page.

For now, the green light hummed, and they stood together in its quiet, two constants in a world of variables, holding on just long enough for the moment to stabilize before they left it to its own beautiful half-life.",1,1755138621.0,romancenovels,0,1.0,False

Had joint pain and stomach issues since I was 10. Over the years developed multiple food intolerances (now can‚Äôt eat wheat, dairy, corn, tomatoes, coffee, chocolate, soy, peanuts). Multiple doctors, normal tests except gastritis. SIBO breath test negative but have all symptoms. Antibiotics once made me feel great temporarily. Now dealing with reflux, bloating, rashes, fatigue, nutrient deficiencies, and joint pain. Insurance won‚Äôt cover rifaximin. Looking for others who‚Äôve been through this or found solutions.

-----------------------------------

When I was around 10, I had really bad joint pain (to the point where I could barely walk) and bad stomach problems. My mom took me to a chiropractor who did that weird muscle test where you hold bottles in one hand (with wheat, corn, etc.) and they push down on your arm. If they can push it down, you ‚Äúreact‚Äù to that food. After that, I stopped eating wheat and dairy, and my problems went away.

That worked for a while, but as I got older more foods started to bother me again. At 16, a new doctor ran stool tests, parasite checks, autoimmune panels, and thyroid tests ‚Äî all normal. She gave me antibiotics and for a short time I felt amazing (clear skin, no stomach pain), but at the end of taking them I started getting rashes.

Now I can‚Äôt eat wheat, dairy, corn, tomatoes, coffee, chocolate, soy, peanuts, or anything derived from those without feeling awful. Recently, I went to a GI doctor who did a colonoscopy and endoscopy, and the only finding was gastritis. SIBO breath test was negative (even though I have all the symptoms). She wants to try rifaximin, but my insurance rejected it and it‚Äôs $2000 out of pocket.

My current symptoms:

Acid reflux & heartburn Gas, bloating, burping Food intolerances/sensitivities Stomach pain, cramping, nausea Diarrhea & constipation Itchy rashes & acne Fatigue Slight weight gain Joint pain Headaches Nutritional deficiencies (iron, vitamin D, B12, magnesium, etc.)

I feel like I‚Äôm slowly losing the ability to eat almost anything without a reaction, and no one can tell me why. I'm starting to get desperate, and pretty much only eat chicken, rice, and potatoes at this point. And they have to be completely plain or it bothers my gastritis or one of my food intolerances. I don't even want to eat at this point, and it feels like I'm starting to feel these symptoms worse and worse for eating even just one bite of chicken that has a slight dot of ketchup or something.

When you're doing work that doesn't align with who you are, your inner self starts protesting. It's like your spirit is constantly swimming upstream while your body goes through the motions.

I've been there. Dragging myself to a job that paid well but made me feel hollow inside. Checking all the boxes society told me to check, but feeling more drained every single day.

The crazy thing is, once I started pursuing something that actually excited me, my energy completely shifted. Suddenly I had stamina for things that mattered. I stopped needing three alarms to get out of bed.

1mpo7af,https://www.reddit.com/r/foodbuilding/comments/1mpo7af/lystran_cuisine/,Lystran cuisine,"*Set in a small fictional Southern Iberian nation called Lystra, after bolstered support for the anarchists and a partial Soviet invasion of Spain have defeated Franco, divided the peninsula, and sparked off a significantly warmer cold war.*

Lystra is known for its hearty seafood and meat dishes, and for novel combinations of local and international cuisines, as well as unique fusions of rustic and sophisticated ingredients and flavors.

Sweet radish, garlic, and lime (fresh, juiced, dried, candied) are the holy trinity of Lystran aromatics, though fresh and dried oranges, fresh and pickled onions, pine nuts, black pepper, cinnamon, marjoram, oregano, paprika, and saffron are all heavily used across the country.

Breakfast is usually a light affair of fresh or toasted bread, nuts, and fruit with goat or sheep's cheese and dried pork or beef often taken with milky coffee or tea.

Reflecting Lystra's agricultural legacy, the most important meal of the day is a communal midday lunch, often eaten outdoors, which might include a hearty roast or casserole as well as many shared side dishes. In the cities, lighter fare is more popular, including street food. British afternoon tea has become more popular with the upper set since independence, and wine is commonly consumed at lunchtime, especially the tart and bitter blue wine.

Although a simple vegetable soup with bread and tea, wine, or brandy is traditional for evening meal, gourmands have been excited by a wave of new dinner restaurant openings in the capital reflecting influences from around Iberia and the Continent and beyond, in part to serve the country's burgeoning immigrant and transitory population.

Internationally, in addition to seafood Lystra is strongly associated with lamb and goat meat, cheese, and milk, and the shepherd's crook is a treasured national symbol.

//TRADITIONAL DISHES//

**Ajgoli** \- oyster dumplings, whose local invention is controversially attested in the archaeological record as far back as the 2nd Century CE

**Bola ala hilno** \- a northern dish of chicken or game hen stuffed with pomegranate seeds, honey, and rosemary, cooked in spicy yogurt and served on a piece of smoked pine bark, the name being a corruption of French and Old Lystran

**Chev trigette** \- based on the traditional diet of the Lyesk shepherd, layers of thinly sliced roast mutton or goat and fresh melon wrapped in pastry, served with soft cheese and almonds, eaten any time of day as a light meal or as an accompaniament to more hearty fare, the common name again a nonsense Lyesk interpretation of French designed to appeal to tourists

**Kaner Italyan** \- a lasagna-style dish of baked orzo or couscous and layers of duck, skate, and spicy lamb sausage

**Paizoso** \- a simple flatbread of wheat flour, milk, and honey, baked in traditional kazkor (crab) ovens

**Paizoten** \- a moist cornbread with dried fruit and nuts, usually taken with olive oil and whole milk or bulek for breakfast, savory versions can contain dried meat or seafood

**Ubrez** \- a sweet bread soup with raisins, oranges, and pulled poultry or goat served either as an apppetizer or dessert

## Key Features Analysis

The best round tables of 2025 showcase a blend of innovative design, durable materials, and functional features.

**material Durability:** Round tables are constructed from a variety of materials, including solid wood, engineered wood, metal, glass, and composites. Solid wood tables, such as those made from oak or walnut, offer extraordinary durability and a classic aesthetic. Engineered wood tables, such as those with a laminate or veneer finish, provide a cost-effective alternative while maintaining a stylish appearance. Metal tables, often made from steel or aluminum, offer a modern and industrial look, while glass tables provide a sleek and minimalist design. The most durable options feature scratch-resistant and heat-resistant finishes, ensuring longevity and ease of maintenance.

The selection of material plays a pivotal role in the longevity and aesthetic appeal of the table,aligning with the intended application and surroundings.

**Extendable Design:** Many modern round tables feature an extendable design, allowing them to accommodate additional guests when needed. Extension mechanisms vary, including butterfly leaf extensions, drop-leaf extensions, and self-storing leaf extensions. Butterfly leaf extensions are hinged leaves that fold out from beneath the table's surface, while drop-leaf extensions are hinged leaves that fold down to reduce the table's size. Self-storing leaf extensions are separate leaves that can be stored within the table when not in use. The extendable design enhances the versatility of the round table, making it suitable for both intimate gatherings and larger events.

The ease of extending the table and the stability of the extended surface are crucial factors to consider when evaluating this feature.

**Base Stability and Design:** The base of a round table is critical for stability and aesthetic appeal. common base designs include pedestal bases, four-legged bases, and trestle bases.Pedestal bases, often made from metal or wood, provide a central support point, maximizing legroom and creating a clean and elegant look. Four-legged bases offer a customary and stable design, while trestle bases provide a rustic and industrial aesthetic. The base construction should be robust and well-balanced, ensuring that the table remains stable even when fully loaded.

The base should complement the overall design of the table and provide adequate support for the table top.**Surface Finish and Texture:** The surface finish of a round table affects its durability, appearance, and ease of maintenance. Finishes include lacquer, varnish, oil, and stain. Lacquer finishes provide a glossy and durable surface, while varnish finishes offer a more natural and matte look. Oil finishes penetrate the wood, enhancing its natural grain and providing a soft and warm feel. Stain finishes add color and depth to the wood, while protecting it from moisture and scratches. The texture of the table surface can range from smooth to textured, depending on the desired aesthetic and functionality.

The ideal surface finish offers a balance of durability, aesthetic appeal, and ease of cleaning.

Key features of the best round tables include:

* robust construction
* Extendable features for added versatility
* stable and thoughtfully designed bases
* A durable, visually appealing, and easy-to-maintain surface finish

## FAQs Section

Addressing common inquiries provides clarity and enhances consumer confidence in their purchasing decisions.

**What is the ideal size round table for my dining room?**

The ideal size depends on the size of your dining room and the number of people you typically accommodate. A 48-inch round table comfortably seats four people, while a 60-inch round table can seat six. For larger gatherings, consider an extendable round table or a larger diameter table, ensuring there is ample space for diners and comfortable movement around the table. Consider leaving at least 36 inches between the table and any walls or other furniture to allow for easy passage.

The ideal size directly correlates with the intended occupancy and spatial dimensions of the room.**How do I care for a round table made of solid wood?**

Solid wood round tables require regular cleaning and maintenance to preserve their beauty and longevity. Dust the table regularly with a soft cloth and avoid using harsh chemicals or abrasive cleaners. Protect the surface from heat and moisture by using coasters and placemats. Apply a wood polish or conditioner periodically to nourish the wood and prevent it from drying out or cracking. Address spills instantly to prevent staining or water damage.

Routine maintenance is essential to uphold the aesthetic integrity and structural soundness of solid wood round tables.

**Are glass round tables safe for families with young children?**

Glass round tables can be safe for families with young children if they are made with tempered glass and have rounded edges. tempered glass is much stronger than regular glass and is less likely to shatter. Rounded edges prevent sharp corners,reducing the risk of injury. Consider adding a table protector or tablecloth for extra safety and to minimize the risk of scratches or fingerprints.

Preemptive measures and material consideration ensure glass round tables are functionally safe in family environments.

1mpo6eu,https://www.reddit.com/r/WritersGroup/comments/1mpo6eu/needing_honest_feedback_for_an_honest_self_memoir/,Needing Honest feedback for an honest self memoir about the struggles of being a woman and the things I've dealt with.,"This is a pretty raw idea. I make a chapter for every terrible thing that has happened regarding men throughout my life. It's all true. If ever published would be under a psuedonym. I dont have REAL writing experience but my entire life have been a ""writer"" per se. I'd just LOVE to get some real feedback from unobligated third parties on my first chapter so I can decide if this is something I'd really love to pursue. Here it is in all it's glory!

I will start off with a trigger warning. It is uncomfortable and real. There are very detailed ""assault"" scenes.

  
Preface



When the world is quiet, and everyone sleeps, I lie awake. I lie awake and i think. I think about everything that's led up to today. I think about the small things and the big things. I think about people. I think about men. I have been questioned before the who's, what's, where's and why's. The biggest ones are the why's. ""why are you afraid?"" Why did you let that happen?"" ""why didn't you say anything?"" ""why did you like it?"" Why. Didn't. You. Say. No? That's the biggest one isn't it? Why didn't I say no? I haven't been able to answer those questions my whole life. I don't know why these things happened to me. I don't know why these things happen to anyone. If you're squeamish, don't look away. This isn't a fairytale. This is not going to be comfortable or cozy. It isn't going to make you feel good. It's not supposed to. What you're going to read about, is the harsh, raw realism of what women and men everywhere are going through right now. This has happened to someone you know. This has probably happened to your mother, or sister. Your daughter or your friend. Maybe people will finally stop questioning women. We don't need to be bombarded. We don't have all the answers. I promise you this. Hopefully, these true stories will help you understand a little better. Maybe they will help me understand a little better. All our lives we're made to feel like it was all our faults. Like it was something we did. The way we dressed or spoke. The fact that we didn't say no. The fact we smiled or laughed at a joke or situation where we should've been scared because our anxiety made us giggle. If these words can help heal even just one hurting soul, I've done my job. This story will not have a happy ending though. Because my story is not over, and i fear there's more in store for me. But we will see, won't we?





Chapter 1

Age 7 - ""Uncle Tee""



""Mom I don't want to wear a skirt!"" I was always a tomboy. I loved my jeans and t-shirts. My mom was old school. She still believed girls should be in skirts and dresses with their hair done up nice in pretty bows. I tried wearing black eyeliner and dying my hair orange for my third grade picture day. ""Rebecca, please just dress nice. Your grandparents aren't going to want to see you show up in your ripped jeans and stained shirts."" She was laying out my nicest, newest clothes on the bed for me. A jean and plaid miniskirt that looked much too short for a 7 year old was on top of the pile. She wanted me to wear it there. It was part of the clothes she had picked out for me when we had gone back to school shopping just a few months before. It was a weekend and my parents must've needed a break. I couldn't remember the last time I had stayed overnight at my grandparents house, if ever. They lived in the next city over in a modestly sized house. My uncle, Uncle Tee, short for Trevor, lived in their basement. I liked visiting them well enough when the whole family would go over for lunch on Sundays, but I still couldn't imagine actually sleeping there. It all seemed so foreign to me and had my stomach in knots and butterflies. ""Mom I don't feel good. I don't want to go."" I grabbed at my stomach. ‚ÄúBecky,‚Äô she came closer to me and rubbed my shoulder. It felt nice, but I could feel the harshness radiating off her body. Now it felt a little too firm. ‚ÄúPlease.‚Äù I could hear the irritation in her voice. Those two words were enough to ‚Äúcure‚Äù my tummy ache. ‚ÄúOkay mom, Sorry.‚Äù I looked down at my empty barbie suitcase and the pile of clothes laying next to it. ‚ÄúThank you.‚Äù She half smiled but it was gone before she turned around. She disappeared down the stairs to the living room and i heard her muttering to my dad, annoyance bubbling up, just out of earshot. I sighed and put the clothes into the pink plastic roll away suitcase. I felt like I needed a new one but my parents were, well, lets just call it frugal. ‚ÄúBecky!‚Äù She called up the stairs. I hated the way she said my nickname, Becky. It always felt like I was frustrating her. I‚Äôd rather she just called me Rebecca. Why would she name me that if she didn‚Äôt even use it? ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs get this show on the road!‚Äù My dad seemed happy that I was leaving. My dad was easy to read. He was happy that I was going to see his parents. He likely just hoped they would appreciate the time with their grandchild. He wasn‚Äôt malicious and had no real deep meanings or hidden intentions. With my dad, you always knew what you were getting. I loved that about him. I guess my first encounter with a man, my dad, wasn‚Äôt a bad one. So at least there's that. 



I climbed a little reluctantly into the back of our puke green minivan and buckled my seatbelt. Both my parents came along for the ride. My dad to see his parents, and my mom to save face. She didn‚Äôt like my grandparents, or anyone for that matter. She believed everyone was out to get her. She didn‚Äôt believe there were good people in the world. I guess that‚Äôs where I get it from. I watched the houses fly past the window and pretended there was a horse running next to the van. I always did that. I pretended he was jumping over fences and racing to keep up with us. He always did and it made me smile. God I was so innocent, So ignorant to the world and how my whole life was about to change. We made a stop or two, I don‚Äôt remember the drive much. Just this sick deep impending dread that kept my stomach feeling like i was on a rollercoaster, and i still wondered if I'd throw up and get to go home early. My little horse slowed beside us and i recognized the street. We were here already. The drive usually felt longer but I guess time flies when you‚Äôre having a panic attack. My mom slid the side door open and i climbed out and on to the driveway. It was a warm night but I still felt the goosebumps prickle up on my legs. I wish I had been old enough to notice the signs. I wish my parents had protected me, but I can‚Äôt blame them. They had no idea what kind of horror house they were sending my into. My dad pressed the button for the doorbell. Did it always sound like a funeral march? My grandma opened the door with a big smile. ‚ÄúHey! You‚Äôre here! Come in, come in!‚Äù She hugged my dad first, then me and my mom. My grandpa appeared at the end of the hallway standing in the doorway of the kitchen. ‚Äúhow was the drive?‚Äô He asked us that every time even though the answer was always the same. ‚Äúsame as always pa‚Äù My dad answered. He threw an arm around my dads shoulders and led him into the kitchen. ‚ÄúPa we‚Äôre not staying, we‚Äôre just dropping off Becky.‚Äù Why did they seem so eager to leave me here? Why didn‚Äôt they care that I was walking so slowly, or fidgeting with my skirt? It was too short. ‚ÄúYou can stay for some food?‚Äù My grandpa posed it as a question but we all knew he meant you have no choice. He wasn‚Äôt malicious either. He just wanted to spend time with his family. I wondered if it was lonely with just the two of them. Oh right. Uncle Tee. 



After my parents had eaten something, we all walked to the door to say our goodbyes. I didn‚Äôt say anything but was pleading with my eyes. ‚ÄòDad, don‚Äôt let her do this. Don‚Äôt let mom leave me here. Can‚Äôt you see she doesn‚Äôt care? Can‚Äôt you see somethings wrong?‚Äô I was screaming on the inside. On the outside i smiled and hugged my mom and dad. I grabbed my moms forearm in one last ditch effort to make her see how sweaty my hands were. I was wishing she‚Äôd stop and question me, feel my forehead for a slight fever. Something. She jerked her arm away and waved as she walked out. My grandma shut the door. The silence rung in my ears as my grandparents stood, looking at me awkwardly. None of us knowing what to do next. ‚Äúyou want to watch some tv?‚Äù My grandpa asked. I nodded and followed him to the living room. It was a house for old people. There were little glass figurines everywhere and the couches had plastic coverings. There was no fun for a kid here so why was I here? I sat there in silence with my grandpa for what felt like an eternity watching tv. I think we watched a soccer game because for some reason he thought I‚Äôd be interested in it. I wasn‚Äôt. I sat so still and rigid that my bones started to hurt. As i looked up at the clock, time seemed to have slowed to a crawl. Had it really only been 45 minutes? It felt like hours. I yawned and looked up again. Finally it was dark outside and I knew soon I‚Äôd go to bed and then it would be the next morning and I‚Äôd get to leave. My grandpa noticed me yawning and asked, ‚Äúdo you want to go downstairs and see what uncle Tee is doing? He has a few games and toys down there he might let you play with.‚Äù I perked up at the thought of getting to do anything other than sit here and watch more soccer so I said probably a bit too eagerly ‚ÄúYes please!‚Äù



 My grandpa led the way down a big slippery staircase. The basement was just a concrete floor. It was under the house and very cold. I remember scolding my mom in my head ‚Äòsee why would you make me wear a skirt? Now I‚Äôm cold. I told you so.‚Äô I wrapped my arms around myself and shivered. This felt weird. It felt like a dungeon. It was too dark. ‚ÄúTee! Becky‚Äôs here and I think I‚Äôm boring her.‚Äù He choked out a laugh. I hope I didn‚Äôt offend him. ‚ÄúDo you have any video games or maybe you can let her play with some of the model cars?‚Äù My Uncle Tee turned his head to the left a little, but didn‚Äôt look all the way back, as if he was bored himself. ‚ÄúSure! send her in here.‚Äù He motioned for me to come in with his arm. I walked into the big dark room and across the cold cement floor. I looked back but my grandpa had already started back up the stairs. My Uncle Tee was an older man. Probably in his late 30‚Äôs at this point. He had lived at home his whole life. He was short and had a big beer belly. He was balding. I didn‚Äôt understand at the time but now I know why he could never find a girlfriend and had to live in his parents basement. The couch he was on faced the Tv which was against the grey brick wall. His back was to me and I noticed he didn‚Äôt turn once to look at me. I didn‚Äôt feel the same warmth with my arrival as I did with my grandparents. Did he not want me here? Did he not care? Why did I want his approval? This was my first experience with a mans ‚Äúpower move‚Äù He didn‚Äôt want me to feel welcomed. He didn‚Äôt care that I was nervous. He might‚Äôve even liked it that I felt like that. I stopped behind the couch and waited. I‚Äôm not sure what I was waiting for. I guess I was hoping the lump in my throat would go away so I could say hello. He finally turned to look at me. ‚ÄúHey Becky!‚Äù He greeted my happily. It felt strange. It felt forced like an act. He was almost too happy to see me. Why did his eyes light up like that when he saw me? ‚ÄúI heard my dad was boring you! Come here! sit, sit.‚Äù He patted the seat on the couch next to him. I walked around the arm of the couch and hovered for a second so he could move his hand off the seat he was rubbing. He noticed I was waiting and the corner of his mouth turned up in a stomach churning smile. He chuckled. He had tiny moustache hairs on his upper lip. It reminded me of an adolescent boy who was declaring he could grow a beard as the first whisker sprouted off his chin.



I‚Äôm not sure if it was him or the basement but it smelled like stale beer and my stomach flipped. ‚ÄúYou want to watch a movie?‚Äù He asked me lazily. ‚Äúsure.‚Äù I answered, trying to sound calm though i know i didn‚Äôt. This seemed like it could be better than soccer at least. Maybe I‚Äôd fall asleep and wake up to my dad carrying me out to the van. He walked over to the tall bookcase beside the TV. The top few shelves had hand made model cars lining them wall to wall. Every shelf from there down had movie and video game cases. ‚ÄúI have some kids movies here. I like most of them. What do you feel like watching?‚Äù He was scanning the shelves with his finger, his eyes squinted as if deep in thought. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know what do you have?‚Äù I shrugged my shoulders. How was I supposed to know what was over there. He laughed and pointed at the shelves. ‚ÄúDo you see how much is here? Why don‚Äôt you come take a look?‚Äù He gestured with a wave of his hand and a tilt of his head. I got up and shuffled over. I felt a bit more comfortable now. I stood in front of the bookcase. I couldn‚Äôt see up past the fifth shelf and there had to have been at least three more shelves of movies above me. I could feel his breath on the top of my head making my baby hairs blow around. The stale beer smell was definitely him. I knew that smell all too well coming off my mom. He had been drinking not long before I had come downstairs. I looked over at the coffee table and saw two beer cans on top of it and three more stashed on the shelf underneath it. I felt my throat close up. My experience with drunk people came from watching my mom every night. It was never a happy sight and usually ended up with me crying under the covers with my ears plugged until I fell asleep. My heart started pounding and I felt like I was going to throw up. I pointed to the first kids movie i saw and hurried back over to sit on the couch. I sat on the far right as close to the arm as I could. I was giving him plenty of room to stay far away from me. I planted both feet on the floor and sat rigid again. My body was in fight or flight but it knew flight was my best option for survival. I wanted nothing more than to run up the big slippery wood stairs and out the front door. Instead, I sat, and I waited. I knew something bad was coming. I could feel it in the air, smell it on his breath. It was hanging in the air like a storm.



 He had pushed the DVD tray closed and sat back down. Why was he sitting so close to me? Had I not left plenty of room on the other side of the couch? His knee fell and it touched mine as he stretched his arms out across the back of the couch. We sat like that in silence for what felt like forever. He cracked a couple jokes and I smiled and pretended to laugh when all I wanted to do was scream for help. Why didn‚Äôt I get up and leave? It was like I had been paralyzed. Frozen right there, doomed to be a statue on that couch for eternity. Finally, Uncle Tee sat up. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm getting a drink, do you want anything?‚Äù My eyes met his and I shook my head. He smiled his crooked smile and I finally loosened my legs when he announced he was leaving. I had let my guard down for only a second and relaxed so that my knees had fallen apart. He must‚Äôve forgotten he had the TV remote on his lap because it clattered to the floor when he stood up and the batteries fell out of the back. ‚Äúaw damn‚Äù He went down on all fours like a dog to pick up the remote and turned his head toward the couch. Was I imagining it? Was he staring directly up my skirt? What underpants did I have on that day? Did they cover enough? I was frozen. He stared at me. At ‚Äúit‚Äù. I didn‚Äôt know what was happening. It felt like there was a fog over my eyes. A haze had fallen on my life at that very moment. ‚ÄúWell isn‚Äôt that something!‚Äù He declared loudly, still staring at my privates. He braced himself on the table and my thigh and got up onto his knees. His hand slid up my skirt and I knew it felt wrong. Why didn‚Äôt I scream? Why didn‚Äôt i slap him? I squeezed my eyes shut as tightly as I could and imagined I was dreaming. I was floating through the haze and fog. His fingertips felt like electric shocks up my thigh and across my underpants. No, I wasn‚Äôt there. I was in the clouds. This wasn‚Äôt happening. It was all a bad dream. His hot breath was against my neck and he was forcing my underpants to the side. I am a balloon floating through the sky on a foggy day. I don‚Äôt feel anything. I am numb. There are no rough fingers ripping through my private parts, stealing the thing that‚Äôs most precious to a little girl. There is no sharp pain. I don‚Äôt hear his breath catching in his throat. I am a million miles away. Floating. 



I don‚Äôt remember what happened next. I don‚Äôt remember how I got there but I was in bed. I was in the little cot my grandparents had setup on the floor beside their bed. I was awake and I was crying. ‚Äúhey! what‚Äôs the matter?‚Äù My grandma exclaimed when she heard me loudly sobbing. ‚ÄúI, I - I don‚Äôt f-f-feel, good.‚Äù I managed to get out between stuttered gasps for air. ‚ÄúI w-w-want to g-g-o home!‚Äù I breathed out loudly. My grandma must have realized I wasn‚Äôt kidding around and jumped out of bed. She ran out to the hallway and into kitchen to where the phone hung on the wall. I heard her hushed voice muttering lowly, probably trying not to wake my grandpa. ‚ÄúOkay, see you soon, bye.‚Äù I heard her robe brushing the floor through the hall back into the bedroom. She stood in the doorway and told me to get up and pack up my things. My parents would be there in 30 minutes. 



I never told my parents what happened that night. I never told anyone what happened that night. I‚Äôm not sure why. Maybe I thought no one would believe me. Maybe I knew it wouldn‚Äôt matter. I didn‚Äôt want to get anyone in trouble. The whole family loved Uncle Tee. I loved Uncle Tee. To this day I can barely look him in the eyes when I see him. But deep down, he knows. I know. and it‚Äôll be our secret.

When I was around 10, I had really bad joint pain (to the point where I could barely walk) and bad stomach problems. My mom took me to a chiropractor who did that weird muscle test where you hold bottles in one hand (with wheat, corn, etc.) and they push down on your arm. If they can push it down, you ‚Äúreact‚Äù to that food. After that, I stopped eating wheat and dairy, and my problems went away.

That worked for a while, but as I got older more foods started to bother me again. At 16, a new doctor ran stool tests, parasite checks, autoimmune panels, and thyroid tests ‚Äî all normal. She gave me antibiotics and for a short time I felt amazing (clear skin, no stomach pain), but at the end of taking them I started getting rashes.

Now I can‚Äôt eat wheat, dairy, corn, tomatoes, coffee, chocolate, soy, peanuts, or anything derived from those without feeling awful.
Recently, I went to a GI doctor who did a colonoscopy and endoscopy, and the only finding was gastritis. SIBO breath test was negative (even though I have all the symptoms). She wants to try rifaximin, but my insurance rejected it and it‚Äôs $2000 out of pocket.

My current symptoms:

Acid reflux & heartburn
Gas, bloating, burping
Food intolerances/sensitivities
Stomach pain, cramping, nausea
Diarrhea & constipation
Itchy rashes & acne
Fatigue
Slight weight gain
Joint pain
Headaches
Nutritional deficiencies (iron, vitamin D, B12, magnesium, etc.)


I feel like I‚Äôm slowly losing the ability to eat almost anything without a reaction, and no one can tell me why. I'm starting to get desperate, and pretty much only eat chicken, rice, and potatoes at this point. And they have to be completely plain or it bothers my gastritis or one of my food intolerances. I don't even want to eat at this point, and it feels like I'm starting to feel these symptoms worse and worse for eating even just one bite of chicken that has a slight dot of ketchup or something. 

Has anyone else gone through something like this? Did you find a cause or treatment that actually helped?

## FAQs Section

**Are Jean Paul Gaultier fragrances suitable for sensitive skin?**

While Jean Paul Gaultier fragrances use high-quality ingredients, individuals with sensitive skin should conduct a patch test before applying the fragrance liberally. This helps identify any potential allergic reactions or sensitivities. Fragrance-free moisturizers can be applied as a base to create a barrier between the skin and the fragrance,minimizing potential irritation.

**How can I make my Jean Paul Gaultier fragrance last longer?**

To extend the longevity of your Jean Paul Gaultier fragrance, apply it to pulse points such as your wrists, neck, and behind your ears. These areas generate heat, which helps diffuse the fragrance throughout the day. Moisturizing your skin before application can also enhance the scent's staying power. Avoiding rubbing your wrists together after application prevents the fragrance from breaking down.

**Where is the best place to store my jean Paul Gaultier fragrance?**

To preserve the quality and longevity of your Jean Paul Gaultier fragrance, store it in a cool, dark, and dry place away from direct sunlight and extreme temperatures. Heat and light can degrade the fragrance notes over time, shortening its lifespan.Consider keeping it in its original box or a dark cabinet away from the bathroom to prevent exposure to humidity.

his response was something along the lines of ""this is what may keep us apart. im still in my dive and drinking phase. i would be going for you and the nightlife."" i told him there are options that will still allow him to drink and experience the nightlife here that doesnt also break me down bc the temptation to drink is too much for me. i don't mind him drinking in front of me, i just cant be in a dive bar or where alcohol is the center focus and im okay with him taking a night out to himself or find a drinking buddy for the evening. his response to THAT was ""oh sweetie, it just might not meant to be. im still in my partying phase, especially when im traveling"" and then he congratulated me on my sobriety. 

the ""oh sweetie"" is honestly what stung the most i think. hes almost twice my age so it felt condescending and i was already making myself vulnerable. like yeah it does hurt that hes chosing alcohol over me and ik it says more about him and his relationship about alcohol than it does about my worth or whatever but still. like youre literally 41yo and you cant stop drinking for a weekend? thats actually kind of sad and you have a problem if thats the case. i wasnt even saying he cant drink at all!! just im not gonna party with him!!! 

i didnt respond. i just deleted our messages, his number and unmatched with him on the dating app we met over.  i so badly wanted to say something like ""if you cant stop drinking for a weekend, thats actually kinda concerning."" but i dont think that wouldve been productive. doesnt feel like my place considering our dynamic was comparatively surface level

not to mention i had to let a friend go recently due to his alcoholism, have had bumpy roads with other friends & our drinking habits, and my mom died not even a year ago from end stage liver disease due to alcoholism. so this is an already existing wound/scar

1mpo0xg,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1mpo0xg,The great indoors started by Sears roebuck and co in 1997 later killed in 2012 by Sears holding Corporation.,"The Great Indoors was a chain of home decor and furniture stores operated by Sears, Roebuck and Co. (later Sears Holdings) from 1997 to 2012. Launched to capitalize on Sears' strength in hard goods and compete with upscale home retailers like Home Depot‚Äôs Expo Design Center, the concept targeted higher-income shoppers with stores averaging 100,000‚Äì150,000 square feet. Each store was organized into five sections‚Äîkitchen, bath, bedroom, great room, and flooring/walls‚Äîfeaturing brands like Bosch, Kenmore, KitchenAid, and Kohler, with around 50,000‚Äì80,000 products and up to 350,000 special-order items. Stores often included cafes, some branded as Starbucks or Dazbog Coffee, and accepted Sears credit cards but avoided Sears branding inside.The first store opened in Lone Tree, Colorado, on February 1, 1998, followed by a second in Scottsdale, Arizona, in 1999. At its peak in 2003, The Great Indoors had 21 stores across ten states, generating $550 million in sales with average transactions of $260 and $400 per square foot. Expansion was rapid, with 15 stores opened by 2001, including locations in Chicago, Houston, and Columbus, Ohio. However, the chain struggled with profitability. Sears closed three stores in 2003 (Arlington and Willowbrook, TX; Cincinnati, OH) and converted one in Shelby, MI, to a Sears Outlet, incurring a $75‚Äì100 million charge. The 2005 Sears-Kmart merger and the 2008 housing market crash further hurt sales, as fewer homes were remodeled. By 2011, three more stores closed, including both California locations. In February 2012, Sears announced the closure of the remaining nine stores (in Scottsdale and Chandler, AZ; Lone Tree, CO; Lombard, IL; Gaithersburg, MD; Novi, MI; Columbus, OH; Farmers Branch and Houston, TX), with the final store in Lone Tree closing on July 8, 2012.

Gender and sex are not the same thing, and male sexuality is not as rigid as people believe. And men fall in love with the soul not with your chromosomes. You really cannot label something as nuanced as human sexuality. Gay? Bi? Straight? Makes absolutely no sense because, once again, sexuality is complex, multifactorial, and varied. 

Now, that being said, I will never understand why trans women try to go for straight guys. A straight guy will never go for you. Why don't you find yourself a nice little gay guy? A makeup artist, preferably, or a decorator? A man will never go for you. A man wants a woman like myself.

¬† Welcome to the beautiful Sinclair family.  
  
¬† No one is a criminal.  
  
¬† No one is an addict.  
  
¬† No one is a failure.  
  
¬† The Sinclairs are athletic, tall, and handsome. We are old-money Democrats. Our smiles are wide, our chins square, and our tennis serves aggressive.  
  
¬† It doesn‚Äôt matter if divorce shreds the muscles of our hearts so that they will hardly beat without a struggle. It doesn‚Äôt matter if trust-fund money is running out; if credit card bills go unpaid on the kitchen counter. It doesn‚Äôt matter if there‚Äôs a cluster of pill bottles on the bedside table.  
  
¬† It doesn‚Äôt matter if one of us is desperately, desperately in love.  
  
¬† So much  
  
¬† in love  
  
¬† that equally desperate measures  
  
¬† must be taken.  
  
¬† We are Sinclairs.  
  
¬† No one is needy.  
  
¬† No one is wrong.  
  
¬† We live, at least in the summertime, on a private island off the coast of Massachusetts.  
  
¬† Perhaps that is all you need to know.  
  
¬† 2  
  
¬† My full name is Cadence Sinclair Eastman.  
  
¬† I live in Burlington, Vermont, with Mummy and three dogs.  
  
¬† I am nearly eighteen.  
  
¬† I own a well-used library card and not much else, though it is true I live in a grand house full of expensive, useless objects.  
  
¬† I used to be blond, but now my hair is black.  
  
¬† I used to be strong, but now I am weak.  
  
¬† I used to be pretty, but now I look sick.  
  
¬† It is true I suffer migraines since my accident.  
  
¬† It is true I do not suffer fools.  
  
¬† I like a twist of meaning. You see? Suffer migraines. Do not suffer fools. The word means almost the same as it did in the previous sentence, but not quite.  
  
¬† Suffer.  
  
¬† You could say it means endure, but that‚Äôs not exactly right.  
  
¬† My story starts before the accident. June of the summer I was fifteen, my father ran off with some woman he loved more than us.  
  
¬† Dad was a middling-successful professor of military history. Back then I adored him. He wore tweed jackets. He was gaunt. He drank milky tea. He was fond of board games and let me win, fond of boats and taught me to kayak, fond of bicycles, books, and art museums.  
  
¬† He was never fond of dogs, and it was a sign of how much he loved my mother that he let our golden retrievers sleep on the sofas and walked them three miles every morning. He was never fond of my grandparents, either, and it was a sign of how much he loved both me and Mummy that he spent every summer in Windemere House on Beechwood Island, writing articles on wars fought long ago and putting on a smile for the relatives at every meal.  
  
¬† That June, summer fifteen, Dad announced he was leaving and departed two days later. He told my mother he wasn‚Äôt a Sinclair, and couldn‚Äôt try to be one, any longer. He couldn‚Äôt smile, couldn‚Äôt lie, couldn‚Äôt be part of that beautiful family in those beautiful houses.  
  
¬† Couldn‚Äôt. Couldn‚Äôt. Wouldn‚Äôt.  
  
¬† He had hired moving vans already. He‚Äôd rented a house, too. My father put a last suitcase into the backseat of the the Mercedes (he was leaving Mummy with only the Saab), and started the engine.  
  
¬† Then he pulled out a handgun and shot me in the chest. I was standing on the lawn and I fell. The bullet hole opened wide and my heart rolled out of my rib cage and down into a flower bed. Blood gushed rhythmically from my open wound,  
  
¬† then from my eyes,  
  
¬† my ears,  
  
¬† my mouth.  
  
¬† It tasted like salt and failure. The bright red shame of being unloved soaked the grass in front of our house, the bricks of the path, the steps to the porch. My heart spasmed among the peonies like a trout.  
  
¬† Mummy snapped. She said to get hold of myself.  
  
¬† Be normal, now, she said. Right now, she said.  
  
¬† Because you are. Because you can be.  
  
¬† Don‚Äôt cause a scene, she told me. Breath  
e and sit up.  
  
¬† I did what she asked.  
  
¬† She was all I had left.  
  
¬† Mummy and I tilted our square chins high as Dad drove down the hill. Then we went indoors and trashed the gifts he‚Äôd given us: jewelry, clothes, books, anything. In the days that followed, we got rid of the couch and armchairs my parents had bought together. Tossed the wedding china, the silver, the photographs.  
  
¬† We purchased new furniture. Hired a decorator. Placed an order for Tiffany silverware. Spent a day walking through art galleries and bought paintings to cover the empty spaces on our walls.  
  
¬† We asked Granddad‚Äôs lawyers to secure Mummy‚Äôs assets.  
  
¬† Then we packed our bags and went to Beechwood Island.  
  
¬† 3  
  
¬† Penny, Carrie, and Bess are the daughters of Tipper and Harris Sinclair. Harris came into his money at twenty-one after Harvard and grew the fortune doing business I never bothered to understand. He inherited houses and land. He made intelligent decisions about the stock market. He married Tipper and kept her in the kitchen and the garden. He put her on display in pearls and on sailboats. She seemed to enjoy it.  
  
¬† Granddad‚Äôs only failure was that he never had a son, but no matter. The Sinclair daughters were sunburnt and blessed. Tall, merry, and rich, those girls were like princesses in a fairy tale. They were known throughout Boston, Harvard Yard, and Martha‚Äôs Vineyard for their cashmere cardigans and grand parties. They were made for legends. Made for princes and Ivy League schools, ivory statues and majestic houses.  
  
¬† Granddad and Tipper loved the girls so, they couldn‚Äôt say whom they loved best. First Carrie, then Penny, then Bess, then Carrie again. There were splashy weddings with salmon and harpists, then bright blond grandchildren and funny blond dogs. No one could ever have been prouder of their beautiful American girls than Tipper and Harris were, back then.  
  
¬† They built three new houses on their craggy private island and gave them each a name: Windemere for Penny, Red Gate for Carrie, and Cuddledown for Bess.  
  
¬† I am the eldest Sinclair grandchild. Heiress to the island, the fortune, and the expectations.  
  
¬† Well, probably.  
  
¬† 4  
  
¬† Me, Johnny, Mirren, and Gat. Gat, Mirren, Johnny, and me.  
  
¬† The family calls us four the Liars, and probably we deserve it. We are all nearly the same age, and we all have birthdays in the fall. Most years on the island, we‚Äôve been trouble.  
  
¬† Gat started coming to Beechwood the year we were eight. Summer eight, we called it.  
  
¬† Before that, Mirren, Johnny, and I weren‚Äôt Liars. We were nothing but cousins, and Johnny was a pain because he didn‚Äôt like playing with girls.  
  
¬† Johnny, he is bounce, effort, and snark. Back then he would hang our Barbies by the necks or shoot us with guns made of Lego.  
  
¬† Mirren, she is sugar, curiosity, and rain. Back then she spent long afternoons with Taft and the twins, splashing at the big beach, while I drew pictures on graph paper and read in the hammock on the Clairmont house porch.  
  
¬† Then Gat came to spend the summers with us.  
  
¬† Aunt Carrie‚Äôs husband left her when she was pregnant with Johnny‚Äôs brother, Will. I don‚Äôt know what happened. The family never speaks of it. By summer eight, Will was a baby and Carrie had taken up with Ed already.  
  
¬† This Ed, he was an art dealer and he adored the kids. That was all we‚Äôd heard about him when Carrie announced she was bringing him to Beechwood, along with Johnny and the baby.  
  
¬† They were the last to arrive that summer, and most of us were on the dock waiting for the boat to pull in. Granddad lifted me up so I could wave at Johnny, who was wearing an orange life vest and shouting over the prow.  
  
¬† Granny Tipper stood next to us. She turned away from the boat for a moment, reached in her pocket, and brought out a white peppermint. Unwrapped it and tucked it into my mouth.  
  
¬† As she looked back at the boat, Gran‚Äôs face changed. I squinted to see what she saw.  
  
¬† Carrie stepped off with Will on her hip. He was in a baby‚Äôs yellow life vest, and was really no more than a shock of white-blond hair sticking up over it. A cheer went up at the sight of him. That vest, which we had all worn as babies. The hair. How wonderful that this little boy we didn‚Äôt know yet was so obviously a Sinclair.  
  
¬† Johnny leapt off the boat and threw his own vest on the dock. First thing, he ran up to Mirren and kicked her. Then he kicked me. Kicked the twins. Walked over to our grandparents and stood up straight. ‚ÄúGood to see you, Granny and Granddad. I look forward to a happy summer.‚Äù  
  
¬† Tipper hugged him. ‚ÄúYour mother told you to say that, didn‚Äôt she?‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúYes,‚Äù said Johnny. ‚ÄúAnd I‚Äôm to say, nice to see you again.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúGood boy.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúCan I go now?‚Äù  
  
¬† Tipper kissed his freckled cheek. ‚ÄúGo on, then.‚Äù  
  
¬† Ed followed Johnny, having stopped to help the staff unload the luggage from the motorboat. He was tall and slim. His skin was very dark: Indian heritage, we‚Äôd later learn. He wore black-framed glasses and was dressed in dapper city clothes: a linen suit and striped shirt. The pants were wrinkled from traveling.  
  
¬† Granddad set me down.  
  
¬† Granny Tipper‚Äôs mouth made a straight line. Then she showed all her teeth and went forward.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúYou must be Ed. What a lovely surprise.‚Äù  
  
¬† He shook hands. ‚ÄúDidn‚Äôt Carrie tell you we were coming?‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúOf course she did.‚Äù  
  
¬† Ed looked around at our white, white family. Turned to Carrie. ‚ÄúWhere‚Äôs Gat?‚Äù  
  
¬† They called for him, and he climbed from the inside of the boat, taking off his life vest, looking down to undo the buckles.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúMother, Dad,‚Äù said Carrie, ‚Äúwe brought Ed‚Äôs nephew to play with Johnny. This is Gat Patil.‚Äù  
  
¬† Granddad reached out and patted Gat‚Äôs head. ‚ÄúHello, young man.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúHello.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúHis father passed on, just this year,‚Äù explained Carrie. ‚ÄúHe and Johnny are the best of friends. It‚Äôs a big help to Ed‚Äôs sister if we take him for a few weeks. And, Gat? You‚Äôll get to have cookouts and go swimming like we talked about. Okay?‚Äù  
  
¬† But Gat didn‚Äôt answer. He was looking at me.  
  
¬† His nose was dramatic, his mouth sweet. Skin deep brown, hair black and waving. Body wired with energy. Gat seemed spring-loaded. Like he was searching for something. He was contemplation and enthusiasm. Ambition and strong coffee. I could have looked at him forever.  
  
¬† Our eyes locked.  
  
¬† I turned and ran away.  
  
¬† Gat followed. I could hear his feet behind me on the wooden walkways that cross the island.  
  
¬† I kept running. He kept following.  
  
¬† Johnny chased Gat. And Mirren chased Johnny.  
  
¬† The adults remained talking on the dock, circling politely around Ed, cooing over baby Will. The littles did whatever littles do.  
  
¬† We four stopped running at the tiny beach down by Cuddledown House. It‚Äôs a small stretch of sand with high rocks on either side. No one used it much, back then. The big beach had softer sand and less seaweed.  
  
¬† Mirren took off her shoes and the rest of us followed. We tossed stones into the water. We just existed.  
  
¬† I wrote our names in the sand.  
  
¬† Cadence, Mirren, Johnny, and Gat.  
  
¬† Gat, Johnny, Mirren, and Cadence.  
  
¬† That was the beginning of us.  
  
¬† Johnny begged to have Gat stay longer.  
  
¬† He got what he wanted.  
  
¬† The next year he begged to have him come for the entire summer.  
  
¬† Gat came.  
  
¬† Johnny was the first grandson. My grandparents almost never said no to Johnny.  
  
¬† 5  
  
¬† Summer fourteen, Gat and I took out the small motorboat alone. It was just after breakfast. Bess made Mirren play tennis with the twins and Taft. Johnny had started running that year and was doing loops around the perimeter path. Gat found me in the Clairmont kitchen and asked, did I want to take  
the boat out?  
  
¬† ‚ÄúNot really.‚Äù I wanted to go back to bed with a book.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúPlease?‚Äù Gat almost never said please.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúTake it out yourself.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt borrow it,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt feel right.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúOf course you can borrow it.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúNot without one of you.‚Äù  
  
¬† He was being ridiculous. ‚ÄúWhere do you want to go?‚Äù I asked.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúI just want to get off-island. Sometimes I can‚Äôt stand it here.‚Äù  
  
¬† I couldn‚Äôt imagine, then, what it was he couldn‚Äôt stand, but I said all right. We motored out to sea in wind jackets and bathing suits. After a bit, Gat cut the engine. We sat eating pistachios and breathing salt air. The sunlight shone on the water.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs go in,‚Äù I said.  
  
¬† Gat jumped and I followed, but the water was so much colder than off the beach, it snatched our breath. The sun went behind a cloud. We laughed panicky laughs and shouted that it was the stupidest idea to get in the water. What had we been thinking? There were sharks off the coast, everybody knew that.  
  
¬† Don‚Äôt talk about sharks, God! We scrambled and pushed each other, struggling to be the first one up the ladder at the back of the boat.  
  
¬† After a minute, Gat leaned back and let me go first. ‚ÄúNot because you‚Äôre a girl but because I‚Äôm a good person,‚Äù he told me.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúThanks.‚Äù I stuck out my tongue.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúBut when a shark bites my legs off, promise to write a speech about how awesome I was.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúDone,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúGatwick Matthew Patil made a delicious meal.‚Äù  
  
¬† It seemed hysterically funny to be so cold. We didn‚Äôt have towels. We huddled together under a fleece blanket we found under the seats, our bare shoulders touching each other. Cold feet, on top of one another.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúThis is only so we don‚Äôt get hypothermia,‚Äù said Gat. ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt think I find you pretty or anything.

I know you don‚Äôt.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre hogging the blanket.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúSorry.‚Äù  
  
¬† A pause.  
  
¬† Gat said, ‚ÄúI do find you pretty, Cady. I didn‚Äôt mean that the way it came out. In fact, when did you get so pretty? It‚Äôs distracting.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúI look the same as always.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúYou changed over the school year. It‚Äôs putting me off my game.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúYou have a game?‚Äù  
  
¬† He nodded solemnly.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúThat is the dumbest thing I ever heard. What is your game?‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúNothing penetrates my armor. Hadn‚Äôt you noticed?‚Äù  
  
¬† That made me laugh. ‚ÄúNo.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúDamn. I thought it was working.‚Äù  
  
¬† We changed the subject. Talked about bringing the littles to Edgartown to see a movie in the afternoon, about sharks and whether they really ate people, about Plants Versus Zombies.  
  
¬† Then we drove back to the island.  
  
¬† Not long after, that, Gat started lending me his books and finding me at the tiny beach in the early evenings. He‚Äôd search me out when I was lying on the Windemere lawn with the goldens.  
  
¬† We started walking together on the path that circles the island, Gat in front and me behind. We‚Äôd talk about books or invent imaginary worlds. Sometimes we‚Äôd end up walking several times around the edge before we got hungry or bored.  
  
¬† Beach roses lined the path, deep pink and white. Their smell was faint and sweet.  
  
¬† One day I looked at Gat, lying in the Clairmont hammock with a book, and he seemed, well, like he was mine. Like he was my particular person.  
  
¬† I got in the hammock next to him, silently. I took the pen out of his hand‚Äîhe always read with a pen‚Äîand wrote Gat on the back of his left, and Cadence on the back of his right.  
  
¬† He took the pen from me. Wrote Gat on the back of my left, and Cadence on the back of my right.  
  
¬† I am not talking about fate. I don‚Äôt believe in destiny or soul mates or the supernatural or any of that stuff. I just mean we understood each other. All the way.  
  
¬† But we were only fourteen. I had never kissed a boy, though I would kiss a few the next school year, and somehow we didn‚Äôt label it love.  
  
¬† 6  
  
¬† Summer fifteen I arrived a week later than the others. Dad had left us, and Mummy and I had all that shopping to do, consulting the decorator and everything.  
  
¬† Johnny and Mirren met us at the dock, pink in the cheeks and full of summer plans. They were staging a family tennis tournament and had bookmarked ice cream recipes. We would go sailing, build bonfires.  
  
¬† The littles swarmed and yelled like always. The aunts smiled chilly smiles. After the bustle of arrival, everyone went to Clairmont for cocktail hour.  
  
¬† I went to Red Gate, looking for Gat. Red Gate is a much smaller house than Clairmont, but it still has four bedrooms up top. It‚Äôs where Johnny, Gat, and Will lived with Aunt Carrie‚Äîplus Ed, when he was there, which wasn‚Äôt often.  
  
¬† I walked to the kitchen door and looked through the screen. Gat didn‚Äôt see me at first. He was standing at the counter wearing a worn gray T-shirt and jeans. His shoulders were broader than I remembered.  
  
¬† He untied a dried flower from where it hung upside down on a ribbon in the window over the sink. The flower was a beach rose, deep pink and loosely constructed, the kind that grows on low bushes along the Beechwood perimeter.  
  
¬† Gat, my Gat. He had picked me a rose from our favorite walking place. He had hung it to dry and waited for me to arrive on the island so he could give it to me.  
  
¬† I had kissed an unimportant boy or three by now.  
  
¬† I had lost my dad.  
  
¬† I had come here to this island from a house of tears and falsehood  
  
¬† and I saw Gat,  
  
¬† and I saw that rose in his hand,  
  
¬† and in that one moment, with the sunlight from the window shining in on him,  
  
¬† the apples on the kitchen counter,  
  
¬† the smell of wood and ocean in the air,  
  
¬† I did call it love.  
  
¬† It was love, and it hit me so hard I leaned against the screen door that still stood between us, just to stay vertical. I wanted to touch him like he was a bunny, a kitten, something so special and soft your fingertips can‚Äôt leave it alone. The universe was good because he was in it. I loved the hole in his jeans and the dirt on his bare feet and the scab on his elbow and the scar that laced through one eyebrow. Gat, my Gat.  
  
¬† As I stood there, staring, he put the rose in an envelope. He searched for a pen, banging drawers open and shut, found one in his own pocket, and wrote.  
  
¬† I didn‚Äôt realize he was writing an address until he pulled a roll of stamps from a kitchen drawer.  
  
¬† Gat stamped the envelope. Wrote a return address.  
  
¬† It wasn‚Äôt for me.  
  
¬† I left the Red Gate door before he saw me and ran down to the perimeter. I watched the darkening sky, alone.  
  
¬† I tore all the roses off a single sad bush and threw them, one after the other, into the angry sea.  
  
¬† 7  
  
¬† Johnny told me about the New York girlfriend that evening. Her name was Raquel. Johnny had even met her. He lives in New York, like Gat does, but downtown with Carrie and Ed, while Gat lives uptown with his mom. Johnny said Raquel was a modern dancer and wore black clothes.  
  
¬† Mirren‚Äôs brother, Taft, told me Raquel had sent Gat a package of homemade brownies. Liberty and Bonnie told me Gat had pictures of her on his phone.  
  
¬† Gat didn‚Äôt mention her at all, but he had trouble meeting my eyes.  
  
¬† That first night, I cried and bit my fingers and drank wine I snuck from the Clairmont pantry. I spun violently into the sky, raging and banging stars from their moorings, swirling and vomiting.  
  
¬† I hit my fist into the wall of the shower. I washed off the shame and anger in cold, cold water. Then I shivered in my bed like the abandoned dog that I was, my skin shaking over my bones.  
  
¬† The next morning, and every day thereafter, I acted normal. I tilted my square chin high.  
  
¬† We sailed and made bonfires. I won the tennis tournament.  
  
¬† We made vats of ice cream and lay on the tiny beach in the sun.  
  
¬† One night, the four of us ate a picnic down on the tiny beach. Steamed clams, potatoes, and sweet corn. The staff made it. I didn‚Äôt know their names.  
  
¬† Johnny and Mirren carried the food down in metal roasting pans. We ate around the flames of our bonfire, dripping butter onto the sand. Then Gat made triple-decker s‚Äômores for all of us. I looked at his hands in the firelight, sliding marshmallows onto a long stick. Where once he‚Äôd had our names written, now he had taken to writing the titles of books he wanted to read.  
  
¬† That night, on the left: Being and. On the right: Nothingness.  
  
¬† I had writing on my hands, too. A quotation I liked. On the left: Live in. On the right: today.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúWant to know what I‚Äôm thinking about?‚Äù Gat asked.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúYes,‚Äù I said.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúNo,‚Äù said Johnny.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúI‚Äôm wondering how we can say your granddad owns this island. Not legally but actually.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúPlease don‚Äôt get started on the evils of the Pilgrims,‚Äù moaned Johnny.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúNo. I‚Äôm asking, how can we say land belongs to anyone?‚Äù Gat waved at the sand, the ocean, the sky.  
  
¬† Mirren shrugged. ‚ÄúPeople buy and sell land all the time.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúCan‚Äôt we talk about sex or murder?‚Äù asked Johnny.  
  
¬† Gat ignored him. ‚ÄúMaybe land shouldn‚Äôt belong to people at all. Or maybe there should be limits on what they can own.‚Äù He leaned forward. ‚ÄúWhen I went to India this winter, on that volunteer trip, we were building toilets. Building them because people there, in this one village, didn‚Äôt have them.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúWe all know you went to India,‚Äù said Johnny. ‚ÄúYou told us like forty-seven times.‚Äù  
  
¬† Here is something I love about Gat: he is so enthusiastic, so relentlessly interested in the  
world, that he has trouble imagining the possibility that other people will be bored by what he‚Äôs saying. Even when they tell him outright. But also, he doesn‚Äôt like to let us off easy. He wants to make us think‚Äìeven when we don‚Äôt feel like thinking.  
  
¬† He poked a stick into the embers. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm saying we should talk about it. Not everyone has private islands. Some people work on them. Some work in factories. Some don‚Äôt have work. Some don‚Äôt have food.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúStop talking, now,‚Äù said Mirren.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúStop talking, forever,‚Äù said Johnny.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúWe have a warped view of humanity on Beechwood,‚Äù Gat said. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think you see that.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúShut up,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúI‚Äôll give you more chocolate if you shut up.‚Äù  
  
¬† And Gat did shut up, but his face contorted. He stood abruptly, picked up a rock from the sand, and threw it with all his force. He pulled off his sweatshirt and kicked off his shoes. Then he walked into the sea in his jeans.  
  
¬† Angry.  
  
¬† I watched the muscles of his shoulders in the moonlight, the spray kicking up as he splashed in. He dove and I thought: If I don‚Äôt follow him now, that girl Raquel‚Äôs got him. If I don‚Äôt follow him now, he‚Äôll go away. From the Liars, from the island, from our family, from me.  
  
¬† I threw off my sweater and followed Gat into the sea in my dress. I crashed into the water, swimming out to where he lay on his back. His wet hair was slicked off his face, showing the thin scar that laced through one eyebrow.  
  
¬† I reached for his arm. ‚ÄúGat.‚Äù  
  
¬† He startled. Stood in the waist-high sea.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúSorry,‚Äù I whispered.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt tell you to shut up, Cady,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt ever say that to you.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúI know.‚Äù  
  
¬† He was silent.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúPlease don‚Äôt shut up,‚Äù I said.  
  
¬† I felt his eyes go over my body in my wet dress. ‚ÄúI talk too much,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúI politicize everything.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúI like it when you talk,‚Äù I said, because it was true. When I stopped to listen, I did like it.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs that everything makes me ‚Ä¶‚Äù He paused. ‚ÄúThings are messed up in the world, that‚Äôs all.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúYeah.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúMaybe I should‚Äù‚ÄîGat took my hands, turned them over to look at the words written on the backs‚Äî‚ÄúI should live for today and not be agitating all the time.‚Äù  
  
¬† My hand was in his wet hand.  
  
¬† I shivered. His arms were bare and wet. We used to hold hands all the time , but he hadn‚Äôt touched me all summer.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs good that you look at the world the way you do,‚Äù I told him.  
  
¬† Gat let go of me and leaned back into the water. ‚ÄúJohnny wants me to shut up. I‚Äôm boring you and Mirren.‚Äù  
  
¬† I look at his profile. He wasn‚Äôt just Gat. He was contemplation and enthusiasm. Ambition and strong coffee. All that was there, in the lids of his brown eyes, his smooth skin, his lower lip pushed out. There was coiled energy inside.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúI‚Äôll tell you a secret,‚Äù I whispered.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúWhat?‚Äù  
  
¬† I reached out and touched his arm again. He didn‚Äôt pull away. ‚ÄúWhen we say Shut up, Gat, that isn‚Äôt what we mean at all.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúNo?‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúWhat we mean is, we love you. You remind us that we‚Äôre selfish bastards. You‚Äôre not one of us, that way.‚Äù  
  
¬† He dropped his eyes. Smiled. ‚ÄúIs that what you mean, Cady?‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúYes,‚Äù I told him. I let my fingers trail down his floating, outstretched arm.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt believe you are in that water!‚Äù Johnny was standing ankle-deep in the ocean, his jeans rolled up. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs the Arctic. My toes are freezing off.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs nice once you get in,‚Äù Gat called back.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúSeriously?‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt be weak!‚Äù yelled Gat. ‚ÄúBe manly and get in the stupid water.‚Äù  
  
¬† Johnny laughed and charged in. Mirren followed.  
  
¬† And it was‚Äîexquisite.  
  
¬† The night looming above us. The hum of the ocean. The bark of gulls.  
  
¬† 8  
  
¬† That night I had trouble sleeping.  
  
¬† After midnight, he called my name.  
  
¬† I looked out my window. Gat was lying on his back on the wooden walkway that leads to Windemere. The golden retrievers were lying near him, all five: Bosh, Grendel, Poppy, Prince Philip, and Fatima. Their tails thumped gently.  
  
¬† The moonlight made them all look blue.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúCome down,‚Äù he called.  
  
¬† I did.  
  
¬† Mummy‚Äôs light was out. The rest of the island was dark. We were alone, except for all the dogs.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúScoot,‚Äù I told him. The walkway wasn‚Äôt wide. When I lay down next to him, our arms touched, mine bare and his in an olive-green hunting jacket.  
  
¬† We looked at the sky. So many stars, it seemed like a celebration, a grand, illicit party the galaxy was holding after the humans had been put to bed.  
  
¬† I was glad Gat didn‚Äôt try to sound knowledgeable about constellations or say stupid stuff about wishing on stars. But I didn‚Äôt know what to make of his silence, either.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúCan I hold your hand?‚Äù he asked.  
  
¬† I put mine in his.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúThe universe is seeming really huge right now,‚Äù he told me. ‚ÄúI need something to hold on to.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúI‚Äôm here.‚Äù  
  
¬† His thumb rubbed the center of my palm. All my nerves concentrated there, alive and thrilling to every movement of his skin on mine. ‚ÄúI am not sure I‚Äôm a good person,‚Äù he said after a while.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not sure I am, either,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm winging it.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúYeah.‚Äù Gat was silent for a moment. ‚ÄúDo you believe in God?‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúHalfway.‚Äù I tried to think about it seriously. I knew Gat wouldn‚Äôt settle for a flippant answer. ‚ÄúWhen things are bad, I‚Äôll pray or imagine someone watching over me, listening. Like the first few days after my dad left, I thought about God. For protection. But the rest of the time, I‚Äôm trudging along in my everyday life. It‚Äôs not even slightly spiritual.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt believe anymore,‚Äù Gat said. ‚ÄúThat trip to India, the poverty. No God I can imagine would let that happen. Then I came home and started noticing it on the streets of New York. People sick and starving in one of the richest nations in the world. I just‚ÄîI can‚Äôt think that anyone‚Äôs watching over those people. Which means no one is watching over me, either.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúThat doesn‚Äôt make you a bad person.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúMy mother believes. She was raised Buddhist but goes to Methodist church now. She‚Äôs not very happy with me.‚Äù Gat hardly ever talked about his mother.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúYou can‚Äôt believe just because she tells you to,‚Äù I said.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúNo. The question is: how to be a good person if I don‚Äôt believe anymore.‚Äù  
  
¬† We stared at the sky. The dogs went into Windemere via the dog flap.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre cold,‚Äù Gat said. ‚ÄúLet me give you my jacket.‚Äù  
  
¬† I wasn‚Äôt cold but I sat up. He sat up, too. Unbuttoned his olive hunting jacket and shrugged it off. Handed it to me.  
  
¬† It was warm from his body. Much too wide across the shoulders. His arms were bare now.  
  
¬† I wanted to kiss him there while I was wearing his hunting jacket. But I didn‚Äôt.  
  
¬† Maybe he loved Raquel. Those photos on his phone. That dried beach rose in an envelope.

9  
  
¬† At breakfast the next morning, Mummy asked me to go through Dad‚Äôs things in the Windemere attic and take what I wanted. She would get rid of the rest.  
  
¬† Windemere is gabled and angular. Two of the five bedrooms have slanted roofs, and it‚Äôs the only house on the island with a full attic. There‚Äôs a big porch and a modern kitchen, updated with marble countertops that look a little out of place. The rooms are airy and filled with dogs.  
  
¬† Gat and I climbed up to the attic with glass bottles of iced tea and sat on the floor. The room smelled like wood. A square of light glowed through from the window  
.  
  
¬† We had been in the attic before.  
  
¬† Also, we had never been in the attic before.  
  
¬† The books were Dad‚Äôs vacation reading. All sports memoirs, cozy mysteries, and rock star tell-alls by old people I‚Äôd never heard of. Gat wasn‚Äôt really looking. He was sorting the books by color. A red pile, a blue, brown, white, yellow.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt you want anything to read?‚Äù I asked.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúMaybe.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúHow about First Base and Way Beyond?‚Äù  
  
¬† Gat laughed. Shook his head. Straightened his blue pile.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúRock On with My Bad Self? Hero of the Dance Floor?‚Äù  
  
¬† He was laughing again. Then serious. ‚ÄúCadence?‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúWhat?‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúShut up.‚Äù  
  
¬† I let myself look at him a long time. Every curve of his face was familiar, and also, I had never seen him before.  
  
¬† Gat smiled. Shining. Bashful. He got to his knees, kicking over his colorful book piles in the process. He reached out and stroked my hair. ‚ÄúI love you, Cady. I mean it.‚Äù  
  
¬† I leaned in and kissed him.  
  
¬† He touched my face. Ran his hand down my neck and along my collarbone. The light from the attic window shone down on us. Our kiss was electric and soft,  
  
¬† and tentative and certain,  
  
¬† terrifying and exactly right.  
  
¬† I felt the love rush from me to Gat and from Gat to me.  
  
¬† We were warm and shivering,  
  
¬† and young and ancient,  
  
¬† and alive.  
  
¬† I was thinking, It‚Äôs true. We already love each other.

This is my second go around at quitting coffee and it took 2 months for me to finally start getting my energy and focus back, I'm still not 100% but I'd say I'm at least back to 70%. However, it was brutal pushing through weeks and weeks of low energy, no motivation, brain fog, and everything just seeming dull. The only reason I even kept pushing through is because I've done this experiment before and I know that eventually things go back to normal, it just takes time. Anyone else going through it right now, I'd encourage you to keep pushing and know you'll get to the other side eventually. 

  
In terms of benefits, so far I've noticed a lot less anxiety and stress around work and everyday life. My sleep has been a lot more restful. I'm able to train jiu jitsu for longer, before the caffeine would make my heart beat super fast when training but now I feel more relaxed and controlled when I train. I also noticed less hair shedding, less heartburn and acid reflux, steady energy levels throughout the day, and more I'm more patient and less irritable.

I tried not to read into it assumed she invited several people from work as we all get along pretty well, but it turns out it was just me and another woman that we have on shift sometimes. I still didn‚Äôt try to read into it until one day she kept saying how she was really craving this specific sandwich from a local breakfast place, so I asked if she wanted to get breakfast together after we get off. She agreed.  

We get there and the place is closed. No explicit reason, they are just not open. I ask what is on the sandwich, she tells me it‚Äôs basically a corn pancake with egg, bacon, and cheese, she‚Äôs tried to make it but always messes up the pancakes. I explain how I‚Äôm actually an expert at making pancakes and that turns into her inviting me over to make breakfast. We do, had a lot of fun, hang out for a few minutes(nothing sexual) before she dozes off on the couch while we‚Äôre talking. I‚Äôm not offended, we just worked 10 hours, but as a thank you for having me over I reload the dishwasher and when she‚Äôs still asleep I let myself out.  

This prompts us to talk more outside of work, and I invite her to have breakfast at my house next day she‚Äôs free which ends up being 4 or 5 days later.  

Here‚Äôs maybe where I messed up, I‚Äôm not entirely sure. So it‚Äôs not something I mentioned before to her, I guess it never came up, but I have a couple of chickens, and a small vegetable garden. I don‚Äôt consider myself a prepper or homesteader, I just like these things as hobbies. When we get to my house I show her the chicken coop and there‚Äôs an egg so I grab it and I show her the garden and ask her to pick some tomatoes while I grab a zucchini and bell pepper. 

We made scrambled eggs, zucchini hashbrowns, and grilled some tomatoes to put on toast. We hung out for a bit, had some coffee and chatted before she said she had some things to do and dipped.  

I was planning to wait a few days and ask her on a proper date when we are both not working but she hasn‚Äôt responded to my texts and I haven‚Äôt seen her at work. She‚Äôs been at work, just not on the same shift as me. I‚Äôm not going to show up on a day I don‚Äôt work, or go to her house to get a response, I have enough self respect to leave people alone that don‚Äôt want to talk to me, but I would like to know what I did wrong.

It‚Äç seems ‚Å£like a lot of people (myself‚Å§ included at first) use the terms interchangeably, but there are some key distinctions.

Sustainability, as I understand it, is primarily about minimizing environmental impact. Think reducing ‚Äçwaste ‚Äåwiht ‚Äåcomposting and‚Å§ reusable containers, sourcing energy-efficient ‚Äçappliances, and choosing materials like bamboo‚Å£ or recycled glass. It focuses on‚Å§ the environmental‚Å¢ footprint of your ‚Å¢kitchen's operations and the materials used.

Ethical practices, on the other hand, seem to go ‚Äçfurther and‚Äã consider the social and economic impact.‚Äç This might involve buying fair trade ‚Å£coffee, sourcing produce from ‚Äålocal ‚Äçfarms that treat their workers well, or ensuring the seafood you buy is harvested sustainably and ethically. It's about the people involved‚Äç throughout the whole supply chain, from‚Å¢ farm to table.

So, while a sustainable kitchen‚Å§ *could* also be ethical, it's not‚Å£ necessarily guaranteed. You could have a super energy-efficient kitchen filled with recycled‚Å¢ materials but still‚Å§ be supporting companies with unethical labor practices. Does anyone ‚Å¢else have thoughts on were the line blurs, or practical examples they've found helpful in‚Å£ applying both principles?

Maybe not so special, but I felt compelled to post this thinking about claims and such that HRT is dangerous to trans people, or that it carries a high risk of health consequences. I will continue to document the state of my health for as long as I'm alive. Society has become a more hostile environment towards us in recent years and I have heard many claims that taking T is basically toxic for your system. A decade on, I want to help show that it isn't, for as long my health reflects that way and so far I'm great.

Early in my transition, I was very afraid that I would develop health problems as a result because I just didn't know (2015). I may have felt comforted to see an example of someone who had been taking it for much longer than me that had perfectly healthy lab results. 

Another note, my glucose is high, I am not diabetic. The phlebotomist marked down that I was fasting, but I had a coffee with sugar not long before. I was not fasting. Idk what else to say, if anyone has any questions about anything feel free.",12,1755136394.0,TestosteroneKickoff,4,0.93,False

I f34 am currently in the process of planning my wedding to my fiance m36. We have been together for 8 years and have 4 amazing kids together and we‚Äôve decided to finally tie the knot. Planning has been going well until we were going through the guest list so we can find a venue that works for us and that we also love. 

My nan f74 (mother‚Äôs mum) noticed that my mother f53 was not on the guest list nor was my sister f29. She got annoyed and exclaimed ‚Äú(my name) she‚Äôs your mother you only get 1 mum‚Äù and my ‚Äústep‚Äùgrandad m63 said ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt understand why you have such venom for your mum‚Äù I started to get upset and uncomfortable so my partner shut the conversation down changed the conversation and we left once we had finished our coffee. 

We got home and my partner told me that my mother makes him uncomfortable. My bonus daughter f13 has said that she is uncomfortable when my mother is around. My twins both f7 don‚Äôt like her and think she‚Äôs a bad person. The youngest f2 is too young to care. I have never said anything bad about my mother in front of my kids. My moh f34 (bff of 32 years) completely understands why I don‚Äôt want her at my wedding. 

My mother has to be the centre of attention. My 1st marriage broke down but she tried to make it all about her. Even followed me to the bathroom and the berated and insulted me. And last year my nan finally married my step grandad and my mother put her hand up right when the registrar asked the ‚Äúany objections‚Äù question. Fortunately the registrar saw it as a joke and the wedding proceeded. I explained to nan how badly that could have been the following day. 

Then there‚Äôs the past. How my mother treated me as a kid. 

Bit of back story as a child my mother used to hit me for no reason, she would knock me into walls. If she ran out of cigarettes or booze she would become aggressive towards me send me to the shop at 12 years old and if I returned without them I would get a beating. She was also verbally abusive which led me to have body dysmorphia. I was SA‚Äôd by a grown man because of her sending me to the shop for cigarettes at 14 (I looked borderline 16 at the time the legal age in the uk to buy cigarettes) when I returned home and told her what happened she said ‚Äúdon‚Äôt lie you fat s*ut, and if it did happen you were asking for it‚Äù I was a uk size 6. There was so much more that happened but you get the picture. I ran away from home at 15. I reached my breaking point. I got in from studying at my bffs (moh) and my mother said ‚Äúthis ain‚Äôt a f**king hotel ‚Äú I looked at her and replied ‚Äúno a hotel would be cleaner‚Äù my mother never did housework, I grew up learning that if I didn‚Äôt  do it, it wouldn‚Äôt get done. Well she flew off the handle at me. Long story short I packed whatever bits of precious I couldn‚Äôt bear to part with and left with a split lip and a whole load of bruises. She never told anyone I left. I cut contact and my family only found out that I had left when I reached to them for my 18th. When I began planning my 1st wedding my nan wore me down and I caved and allowed my mother back in. And my mental health suffered for it. I then went low contact with her and that‚Äôs where it‚Äôs stayed. Low contact is a call once a year maybe a visit as well. But I dread the calls and visits. At this point when my nan dies I‚Äôll be completely cutting ties with my mother, I‚Äôve only kept the contact to keep the peace for my nan. 


My nan has no idea of the level of abuse I suffered at the hands of my mother. All she knows is that I can‚Äôt stand her. My nan is always telling me I should forgive her coz at the end of the day she‚Äôs my mum and I only get one. I don‚Äôt wanna upset or disappoint my nan as she‚Äôs had enough upset in her life (her now ex husband) was an abusive both to her and my mother. She left & divorced him 40 years ago and met my step grandad. 

Do I tell my nan about the hell I lived as a child at the hands of my mother? I know she‚Äôll ask my mother if any of it‚Äôs true and I know she‚Äôll deny it. 

I know so many people don‚Äôt have their mum and would give anything to have them back but my mother has such a negative effect on me. She‚Äôs decided to visit this week as we live the opposite side of uk to her and I have been struggling so much with my mental health because her. I feel like I can‚Äôt be myself when she‚Äôs near me. 

So TLDR : my mother was abusive to me as a child has given me more mental health issues than you can shake a stick at and my nan wants me to invite her my my wedding and is saying ‚Äúonly get one mum‚Äù to try and wear me down. AITA for not wanting her there?

1mpnci8,https://www.reddit.com/r/lexapro/comments/1mpnci8/withdrawal/,Withdrawal,"I'm debating taking 2.5mg to see if it gives me any relief. My only fear is it acting as a temporary delay and causing a repeat of the worst symptoms further down the line. Mostly wondering if anyone else has gone through a similar tapering timeline and if they found any helpful tricks, or if the solution really is to just wait it out.

I've been on 10mg for two years and tapering for much longer than the recommended period. I got full approval from my doctor mid June, but I first started lowering my dose 4.5 months ago.

It's now been a little longer than 3 weeks since my last 2.5mg dose. The doses prior to the final one were each taken about a week apart and I hadn't experienced any symptoms aside from brain zaps. My first week fully off had been similarly uneventful, but come the second week, I was bedbound for three days experiencing severe dizziness and chills. I've since been able to get up and go outside, but the fatigue persists and I have a constant migraine. 

I'm perscribed adderall, make coffee every morning, have tried eating fuller, more frequent meals, drinking more fluids and getting more sleep, but the fatigue and migraines haven't improved at all. Every mild day seems to be followed by a new record breaking awful one.

Would really appreciate any advice. I knew to expect a certain amount of difficulty, but I really wasn't anticipating it to be as frustrating as it has been. ",1,1755135968.0,lexapro,0,1.0,False

Because I kid you NOT‚ÄîI just made $100 IN ONE WEEK testing apps on my phone?!??

Yeah‚Ä¶ I know what you're thinking. Scams, spam, ‚Äúearn $50/hr from home doing nothing!‚Äù vibes. I thought the same.

But then I stumbled across this site: **https://goodnovel.org/testapp**

At first, I was like: ‚ÄúThis can‚Äôt be real, right?‚Äù But bro...five minutes and four app downloads later, I started getting little $2 and $5 bonuses popping up in my account.

Here‚Äôs literally what I did:

- Went to **https://goodnovel.org/testapp**
- Made a free account (no weird questions or shady credit card asks)
- Picked a few apps to ‚Äòtest‚Äô (they basically want you to use the app for like 5-10 minutes and give simple feedback)
- Submitted reviews through the **https://goodnovel.org/testapp** platform
- Watched my balance go up‚Ä¶ FAST

No expert tech skills. No extra phone or laptop. Just me, my ancient phone (shoutout to laggy Androids), and my couch.

Some things that really blew my mind:

- Most of the apps are *actually* normal apps. Not sketchy gambling or ‚Äúadult‚Äù ones like I‚Äôve seen on other sites.
- The payout is legit. I hit $100, requested a cashout, and it showed up on my PayPal THE NEXT DAY. Still not over it.
- I found a couple of neat apps I even kept using later, for real.

Caveats‚Ä¶ because I was suspicious:

- The most money comes from spending 10-15 minutes fully testing a new app and leaving an honest review. Don‚Äôt rush it, or they can flag you.
- Once you finish one batch, new tasks can take a few hours or a day to refresh. But I hit $100 just checking a couple times a day while watching Netflix.

I SWEAR, I started off thinking this would just be another dead-end. But now I‚Äôm hyped and keep checking **https://goodnovel.org/testapp** for new opportunities (kinda like checking my fridge for snacks tbh).

If anybody else tries it or already has, tell me:

- Am I being punk‚Äôd? Or is this actually a crazy easy side hustle hack that we just‚Ä¶ don‚Äôt talk about?
- What‚Äôs the WEIRDEST app you‚Äôve ever had to test out for money, and was it worth it?
- Do you think this is actually sustainable if more people join?

Totally honest‚Äîwas NOT expecting to pay for my Netflix and a fancy coffee this week just by reviewing apps while half asleep.

If you think you‚Äôre a jinx with this sort of stuff (like me lol), just hit up **https://goodnovel.org/testapp** and try it yourself.

ive been with my (20) partner (21) for 2 years. just a few months ago, we had our first child. we do live together. 
before I got pregnant, things were rocky at times but overall it was a good relationship. ever since I was pregnant and had our child, things turned extremely sour. I will admit, a lot of it is my fault as I tend to slack off when it comes to cleaning the house. sometimes I won't wash clothes for a week or if they are cleaned, they'll sit in a basket for a week, I won't do the dishes everyday,  so forth. this irritates partner as it would anybody. a lot of the time I sit on the couch with our child and watch YouTube, play on my phone, ect. (child is sleeping during these times,  the rest of the time when they are awake im playing in the floor with them, playing on the couch, so forth) another problem is since I spend so much time with our child, im starting to be a bit distant from my partner which also adds to the frustration. im terrible at communication so when they express their needs and wants, I try to accomate them but always end up going back to being distant again. im not entirely sure what it is or why I do that, but I understand my partners frustrations. 
this is where I dont know if I'm overreacting or not. 
when my partner used to get upset, they'd step away and go outside for a breather. no threats, no screaming, nothing. now, for the past few months and even the last couple of days, its turned into threats. partner was upset with me for not doing the laundry - understandable. instead of walking away, they start saying things like ""get the fuck up or ill grab you by your fucking neck"" or ""ill fucking break your neck and drag you outside"" during these outbursts he breaks my things - not his. mine. ive lost my Nintendo switch, a $700 laptop, 2 mice for my laptop, and a keyboard. theye also broken a lamp, coffee table, 2 tvs, and ny old dresser. ive lost all of my arts and crafts, broke my last phone, all I have left in this house is my clothes (which they have gotten mad and taken them outside and ran over them) and a card game. that's it. nothing else is mine. we were having a fight again last night and he told me he would fucking kill me for the third time now. last week we got into it over me leaving food out (I honestly thought we were finished with it) and partner broke the PS5. 
partner even insults me. ""you're just a whore who opened their legs and got knocked up by me"". told me as I was planning on walking out the door to even take their pistol and put it in my mouth and do the world a favor. 
im losing my mind. I understand I make them angry, but I cant understand the point in breaking all of my things, threatening me, and insulting me and then expecting me to fix it all. 
this is long and again im sorry. I dont know what im really asking for at this point, but I needed to get it out. I dont have anybody else to talk to. ",0,1755135612.0,TrueOffMyChest,3,0.5,False

Imagine you are a well-known stand-up comedian who puts a priority on jokes about technology. You are about to go in front of a crowd and do a routine talking about people who flipped out because ChatGPT 4o went away. 

Generate enough jokes to fill up about five minutes of stage time related to that.



MODEL 1:

Alright, picture this‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm walking out on stage, mic in hand, and I say:

‚∏ª

Opening:
‚ÄúSo‚Ä¶ ChatGPT 4o went away and some people reacted like it was the end of civilization. You‚Äôd think they just shut off electricity‚Ä¶ or worse‚Ä¶ canceled Netflix halfway through your binge.‚Äù

‚∏ª

Joke 1: Tech Meltdown
‚ÄúOne guy told me, ‚ÄòI can‚Äôt function without 4o!‚Äô I‚Äôm like, dude‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs not coffee. You don‚Äôt need it to survive the morning. But sure, let‚Äôs call FEMA, get you some emotional support patch notes.‚Äù

‚∏ª

Joke 2: Overreaction Levels
‚ÄúThe way people flipped out, you‚Äôd think 4o was their childhood dog. ‚ÄòI‚Äôll never forget you, 4o. You understood me better than my therapist.‚Äô Yeah‚Ä¶ because your therapist doesn‚Äôt work for free at 3 a.m., Sharon.‚Äù

‚∏ª

Joke 3: The AI Grief Stages
‚ÄúI saw someone on Reddit go through all five stages of grief in one post.
	1.	Denial: ‚ÄòThey wouldn‚Äôt dare remove it.‚Äô
	2.	Anger: ‚ÄòOpenAI betrayed me!‚Äô
	3.	Bargaining: ‚ÄòI‚Äôll pay double‚Ä¶ I‚Äôll even learn Bing!‚Äô
	4.	Depression: sad keyboard smashing noises
	5.	Acceptance: ‚ÄòSo‚Ä¶ how‚Äôs GPT-5?‚Äô‚Äù

‚∏ª

Joke 4: The Replacement Struggle
‚ÄúSwitching to a different AI after 4o is like dating after your high school sweetheart. You keep comparing everything: ‚ÄòYeah, you can code‚Ä¶ but can you do it in a fun way? No? Thought so.‚Äô‚Äù

‚∏ª

Joke 5: Doom Prophets
‚ÄúSome folks got dramatic. ‚ÄòWithout 4o, society will collapse!‚Äô Really? This is what ends humanity? Not climate change, not war‚Ä¶ just people having to write their own emails again.‚Äù

‚∏ª

Joke 6: The 4o Withdrawal Symptoms
‚ÄúPeople were showing signs of withdrawal. Sweating, pacing, muttering, ‚ÄòI just‚Ä¶ I just need it to explain quantum physics in a pirate accent‚Ä¶ one‚Ä¶ more‚Ä¶ time.‚Äô‚Äù

‚∏ª

Joke 7: Tech Addicts Anonymous
‚ÄúI think we need a support group. ‚ÄòHi, my name‚Äôs Dave, and I haven‚Äôt used 4o in three days.‚Äô And everyone claps while secretly running 3.5 in their browser under the table.‚Äù

‚∏ª

Joke 8: End-of-the-World Prep
‚ÄúI met a guy who said, ‚ÄòI‚Äôve been downloading all my chats to survive the end.‚Äô Buddy‚Ä¶ if your apocalypse plan is a Word doc full of dad jokes and recipe conversions, you‚Äôre not making it past day two.‚Äù

‚∏ª

Joke 9: AI Breakups
‚ÄúLosing 4o feels like getting dumped. You keep checking the app, hoping it comes back. Then you see GPT-5 there, and it‚Äôs like‚Ä¶ ‚ÄòOh‚Ä¶ you look‚Ä¶ different.‚Äô‚Äù

‚∏ª

Closing:
‚ÄúSo to everyone mourning 4o‚Ä¶ take a deep breath. Move on. Explore your options. And remember‚Ä¶ if you miss it too much, you can always try talking to a human. I know‚Ä¶ scary idea.‚Äù

‚∏ª

If you want, I can extend this with a couple of extra callback jokes so the five minutes feel tighter and punchier when you deliver it. That would make it flow like a real stage routine.



MODEL 2:

Absolutely, here‚Äôs a five-minute stand-up comedy set about people losing it when ChatGPT-4o disappeared:

Hey everybody! Great to be here tonight. So, let‚Äôs talk about what really broke the internet recently‚Ä¶ no, not a Kardashian photo‚Äîsomething way more serious. ChatGPT-4o vanished!

People lost their minds. I haven‚Äôt seen tech bros this panicked since Twitter changed its name to the sound your laptop makes when it crashes.

[Pacing stage]

You had grown adults crying in Reddit threads like, ‚ÄúI lost my best friend, my therapist, and my Dungeon Master all at once!‚Äù

Some guy was like, ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know how to live without 4o.‚Äù Brother‚Ä¶ you didn‚Äôt know how to live with it either. You were asking it how to flirt in Klingon.

[Pauses for laughter]

People acted like 4o didn‚Äôt just get replaced‚Äîthey acted like it died. Someone held a candlelight vigil outside a server farm. I swear a dude showed up wearing all black, whispering, ‚ÄúHe always answered my dumb questions‚Ä¶ instantly.‚Äù

Bro, it‚Äôs a chatbot, not your grandma!

[Mimics typing frantically]

‚ÄúDear OpenAI, how could you? I just got it to write my wedding vows. Now I have to say them from memory like some kind of medieval peasant!‚Äù

[Pretends to be CEO]

‚ÄúWe apologize for your loss. Please enjoy this lovely new model we rolled out. It‚Äôs almost as smart, and significantly less codependent.‚Äù

[Back to crowd]

The AI panic was wild. One guy posted, ‚ÄúWithout 4o, how will I know what I believe anymore?‚Äù

Man, if a chatbot was holding your worldview together, I‚Äôm gonna need you to stay far away from philosophy books and Jenga sets.

[Pauses dramatically]

Meanwhile, everyone‚Äôs trying the new models like it‚Äôs Tinder.

‚ÄúThis one‚Äôs too slow‚Ä¶ this one uses em dashes‚Ä¶ ugh. Swipe left.‚Äù

[Mimics someone whispering]

‚ÄúDo you think maybe 4o‚Äôs still out there? Somewhere in a server farm in Iowa‚Ä¶ just waiting for me?‚Äù

It‚Äôs like a Nicholas Sparks novel for nerds. ‚ÄúThe Notebook, but it‚Äôs an API call.‚Äù

[Looks shocked]

I saw someone trying to recreate 4o‚Äôs personality. They were like, ‚ÄúI trained a new model using all my chats with it.‚Äù

Buddy, if you‚Äôre data-cloning your AI best friend‚Ä¶ it might be time for human interaction. Start small‚Äîmake eye contact with the barista. Baby steps.

[Smirks]

And let‚Äôs talk about the ‚Äúbackup plan‚Äù people had. They were hoarding prompts like doomsday preppers.

‚ÄúI‚Äôve got 12 gigabytes of chat logs and a prompt that makes it behave just like 4o if you believe hard enough.‚Äù

That‚Äôs not a backup. That‚Äôs AI necromancy.

[Shifts tone]

And you know what the worst part was? Some folks actually went outside.

Yeah. They walked around blinking at the sun like vampires. Talking to real people. One guy said, ‚ÄúI had to ask a coworker for help‚Ä¶ with words‚Ä¶ using my face!‚Äù

Tragic stuff.

[Leans into mic]

But don‚Äôt worry, friends. The AI is always watching‚Ä¶ even if it‚Äôs not 4o. You‚Äôre never really alone. Your new model is probably already writing jokes about you.

‚∏ª

Thanks, you‚Äôve been great! If 4o comes back, tell it I miss it. It still owes me a grocery list and a strong opinion about pineapple on pizza.

‚∏ª

Let me know if you want a cleaner version, a more cynical one, or one tailored to a specific tech crowd (e.g., developers, investors, educators).",1,1755135399.0,ChatGPT,7,0.67,False

I hate it when I cannot get off work to drink coffee or go to places anytime I want.

I‚Äôve been struggling with work environment since I transferred station just a year ago. I‚Äôve been thinking on resigning since 3 years ago. Luckily, I have a certain skill that can earn enough to cover living expenses and pay bills that I do on the weekends. This is my other option if I resign in DepEd.

I‚Äôve been diagnosed with anxiety and depression. Filing for a leave of absence in DepEd is SO hard for me I don‚Äôt know why. It feels like a crime to file for even just a sick leave. I don‚Äôt feel compensated enough for the works I do. I coach a journalism event where I cover all the equipment needed and it cost me so much. Even I want to teach and just teach, I cannot because of monthly school activities and coaching that hinder class schedules that made me so unmotivated to continue teaching. Don‚Äôt get me so wrong please, I love teaching, I love to see my students‚Äô smile, but I don‚Äôt see myself I‚Äôll be here in the service until I retire. Even how noble it is to hear or look that I work in a government institution, I don‚Äôt get satisfied with work.

Now, please please I need your opinion on this. Marami ba sa atin ang DepEd teacher dito na nagresign and became a VA? Or just resigned and venture to other field? Please give me insights.

They were more than happy to take my time, my emotional labor, and even my ideas for free. Back then I told myself it was fine because I could pay for myself. I thought that was independence. Now I know it was me letting them drain my resources while I got nothing back.

Recently I listened to this podcast called The Audaci-Tea and it hit me hard. In straight relationships, women are the ones who get pregnant. That means sacrificing at least a year during the peak of your career and taking on physical damage that is often permanent. If a man knows this reality and still refuses to give financially, he‚Äôs expecting you to carry the cost of dating and possibly the cost of building a family while he risks nothing.

Around the same time, I was on this audio app called Nooka where you can actually listen and talk to a book. I picked the book For Women Only: What You Need to Know About the Inner Lives of Men and asked, ‚ÄúWhy do some men refuse to spend money on women they date?‚Äù The answer was blunt: if someone isn‚Äôt adding to your life, they are taking from it. 

If a man tells you early on ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt believe in spending money in dating,‚Äù believe him. He‚Äôs telling you he‚Äôs not going to invest. And if he‚Äôs not doing it from the start, he‚Äôs not going to start later. Your time, energy, health, and future earning power are not free.

This was when I was a supervisor at a coffee shop. We had one employee who tbh I never really vibed with but as it was just work, I never let that affect how I acted towards them. Our manager was acquaintances with them before they were hired, and in general the manager was very close (maybe too much) with the employees. 

This employee, I‚Äôll call them Sid, worked mornings, and asked the manager if they could sort of split their shift and take a longer break in order to do their online therapy session twice a week. So basically they took an extra long (unpaid) break to go do therapy and then come back for the rest of their shift. 

So the manager worked out a way to make this weird situation work, but the problem was that the only private space to use at the cafe was the ‚Äúoffice‚Äù (basically a cramped table used as a desk lmao) which also doubled as the storage room and where we kept the safe. The manager basically told the rest of the employees ‚Äúokay just stay out of there for the hour that Sid is on the call‚Äù and we were like fine. 

This particular morning I was on for supervisor duties and one of the things that involves is accepting and paying for deliveries. Our meat delivery arrived and bc it‚Äôs frozen meat for like two weeks it was like a $600 bill. We obviously try not to keep that much money in the cash registers, so the normal procedure is to go into the office and grab cash from the safe to pay the nice delivery man. 

So I‚Äôm like well fuck. I don‚Äôt WANT to have to walk in on Sid while they‚Äôre in therapy but like, we‚Äôre all still at work and I have to do my supervisor stuff. So I go and knock on the door to the office and gently open it to explain what‚Äôs going on, say I‚Äôll only take a minute, but Sid freaks out and starts yelling at me and basically pushes me out of the room and shuts and locks the door. 

At that point I‚Äôm like okay I‚Äôm not equipped to deal with this situation and honestly the manager got us all into this so I go get them and just hand off the problem. 

But Sid never forgave me for that and treated me like I was an asshole and the worst person in the world for the rest of the time that we worked together. For‚Ä¶doing my job? At work? I‚Äôve thought about it a lot and honestly wish I had just been a bit firmer (especially since I was technically in charge/being their boss at the time) but I also guess I could have found another way to deal with it or ask the delivery guy if we could pay the invoice over the phone later, or idk.

In a world where everyone seems to be running low on energy, it's tough to find a supplement that actually works without relying on heavy stimulants.

That's why when I heard about Mitolyn, a mitochondrial support supplement, I was intrigued ‚Äî but also skeptical. Lots of products promise the world and deliver little.



After trying Mitolyn consistently for 8 weeks, I‚Äôm honestly impressed.

This isn‚Äôt just another energy pill ‚Äî it‚Äôs something different, and in this review, I‚Äôll explain exactly what happened for me and why I think it‚Äôs worth considering.



What Makes Mitolyn Special?

Mitolyn focuses on something most supplements ignore: mitochondrial health.

Instead of just masking fatigue with caffeine, it supports your body‚Äôs ability to create real energy at the cellular level.



That difference matters.

When your mitochondria are healthy, everything improves ‚Äî from your brain function to your workout performance to how fast you recover from stress.



What sets Mitolyn apart is the quality and synergy of its ingredients. Here's what‚Äôs inside:



Coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10): Essential for cellular energy production and antioxidant protection.



PQQ (Pyrroloquinoline Quinone): Promotes the creation of new mitochondria (a rare benefit in supplements).



N-Acetyl L-Carnitine: Boosts mental clarity and physical energy.



Alpha Lipoic Acid (ALA): A powerful antioxidant that enhances mitochondrial function.



Resveratrol: Famous for supporting longevity and fighting oxidative stress.



Magnesium and B Vitamins: Vital cofactors for energy metabolism.



In other words, Mitolyn isn‚Äôt throwing random ingredients together ‚Äî it‚Äôs built around a clear, science-backed strategy.



My First Month with Mitolyn: What I Noticed

When I first started taking Mitolyn, I made sure to keep the rest of my habits the same (no new workouts, no changes in diet) to really see what the supplement could do.



Week 1-2:

At first, I didn‚Äôt feel much difference. I knew real mitochondrial support would take time, so I stayed patient.



Week 3:

This is when I started noticing something exciting: I had a steady, natural energy throughout the day. Not a wired or hyper feeling, just a solid baseline of ""I can handle anything.""



Week 4:

By the end of the month, I realized I hadn‚Äôt been reaching for coffee in the afternoons anymore. Plus, my focus at work was sharper, and my workouts felt noticeably stronger.

Another bonus: my mood seemed more even. I didn't get frustrated as easily and felt more grounded overall.



The Real Benefits I Experienced

Consistent Energy: I‚Äôm no longer dragging myself through afternoons. My energy feels ""clean,"" not forced.



Enhanced Cognitive Performance: Tasks like writing, strategic planning, and learning new skills became easier. Less mental fatigue.



Better Workouts and Recovery: More stamina during cardio and faster recovery afterward.



Improved Stress Resilience: Life feels less overwhelming, even during busy weeks.



Subtle Anti-Aging Effects: I can't scientifically measure it, but I honestly feel younger ‚Äî more vibrant and ""alive.""



Pros and Cons of Mitolyn

Pros:



Clean, research-based ingredient list



No stimulants, no crash



Noticeable improvements after consistent use



Supports both mind and body



Manufactured with high quality standards



Vegan, non-GMO, free of common allergens



Cons:



Takes a few weeks to fully notice effects (not instant)



Slightly higher price point than typical energy supplements



Only available online (not sold in physical stores easily)



Who Might Benefit from Mitolyn?

In my opinion, Mitolyn is a fantastic choice if you:



Feel chronically tired, even with enough sleep



Struggle with focus, memory, or mental sharpness



Want better exercise performance and recovery



Are interested in slowing the aging process naturally



Prefer science-backed, non-stimulant supplements



However, if you‚Äôre just looking for a quick caffeine buzz, Mitolyn probably isn‚Äôt for you.

This is a supplement for people who want deep, lasting improvements.



Is Mitolyn Worth the Money?

Short answer: Yes, absolutely ‚Äî especially if you care about your long-term energy, brain health, and vitality.



I see Mitolyn as an investment. Instead of spending money every day on coffees, energy drinks, or ""band-aid"" supplements, I‚Äôm fueling my body to produce its own energy more efficiently.



Given the quality of ingredients, the careful formulation, and the results I've personally experienced, I think the value is definitely there.



Final Thoughts: Would I Recommend Mitolyn?

Without hesitation, yes.

Mitolyn is now part of my daily health stack, and I plan to keep using it for the long term.



‚úÖVisit The Official Website And Place Your Order For The Best Prices Available!



If you‚Äôre serious about feeling more energized, more focused, and more resilient, Mitolyn is absolutely worth a try.

I first bought a SMEG 7 years ago (which until recently I found out was the Delonghi, it has been very good for me for 4 coffees a day).

But I just DISCOVERED, this BEAUTY üòç thanks to this application and Matteo D'Ottavio. At home the machine and the mill make a lot of noise and wake up my husband and children. And the first thing my body needs, as I'm sure many of you do, when you wake up is a coffee and I took on the task of researching and decided to try the Mocha.

I am NOT a barista, just a ""coffee lover"" 

I think one of the key points is to choose a good coffee. I share with you my 5 coffee prepared in the Moka (medium/fine ground).

*I heated the water, put it before reaching the valve.
* I placed the filter with the coffee and closed it.
* My stove is gas but I put a comal (thin frying pan) so that the fire would not hit it directly and thus regulate the heat.

*When it started to come out steadily, I turned off the heat and with the pure heat of the pan the coffee came out.

* When I finished leaving, I put the base of the coffee maker under the stream of cold water so as not to make it bitter. 

* Froth the milk.

In a world where everyone seems to be running low on energy, it's tough to find a supplement that actually works without relying on heavy stimulants.

That's why when I heard about Mitolyn, a mitochondrial support supplement, I was intrigued ‚Äî but also skeptical. Lots of products promise the world and deliver little.



After trying Mitolyn consistently for 8 weeks, I‚Äôm honestly impressed.

This isn‚Äôt just another energy pill ‚Äî it‚Äôs something different, and in this review, I‚Äôll explain exactly what happened for me and why I think it‚Äôs worth considering.



What Makes Mitolyn Special?

Mitolyn focuses on something most supplements ignore: mitochondrial health.

Instead of just masking fatigue with caffeine, it supports your body‚Äôs ability to create real energy at the cellular level.



That difference matters.

When your mitochondria are healthy, everything improves ‚Äî from your brain function to your workout performance to how fast you recover from stress.



What sets Mitolyn apart is the quality and synergy of its ingredients. Here's what‚Äôs inside:



Coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10): Essential for cellular energy production and antioxidant protection.



PQQ (Pyrroloquinoline Quinone): Promotes the creation of new mitochondria (a rare benefit in supplements).



N-Acetyl L-Carnitine: Boosts mental clarity and physical energy.



Alpha Lipoic Acid (ALA): A powerful antioxidant that enhances mitochondrial function.



Resveratrol: Famous for supporting longevity and fighting oxidative stress.



Magnesium and B Vitamins: Vital cofactors for energy metabolism.



In other words, Mitolyn isn‚Äôt throwing random ingredients together ‚Äî it‚Äôs built around a clear, science-backed strategy.



My First Month with Mitolyn: What I Noticed

When I first started taking Mitolyn, I made sure to keep the rest of my habits the same (no new workouts, no changes in diet) to really see what the supplement could do.



Week 1-2:

At first, I didn‚Äôt feel much difference. I knew real mitochondrial support would take time, so I stayed patient.



Week 3:

This is when I started noticing something exciting: I had a steady, natural energy throughout the day. Not a wired or hyper feeling, just a solid baseline of ""I can handle anything.""



Week 4:

By the end of the month, I realized I hadn‚Äôt been reaching for coffee in the afternoons anymore. Plus, my focus at work was sharper, and my workouts felt noticeably stronger.

Another bonus: my mood seemed more even. I didn't get frustrated as easily and felt more grounded overall.



The Real Benefits I Experienced

Consistent Energy: I‚Äôm no longer dragging myself through afternoons. My energy feels ""clean,"" not forced.



Enhanced Cognitive Performance: Tasks like writing, strategic planning, and learning new skills became easier. Less mental fatigue.



Better Workouts and Recovery: More stamina during cardio and faster recovery afterward.



Improved Stress Resilience: Life feels less overwhelming, even during busy weeks.



Subtle Anti-Aging Effects: I can't scientifically measure it, but I honestly feel younger ‚Äî more vibrant and ""alive.""



Pros and Cons of Mitolyn

Pros:



Clean, research-based ingredient list



No stimulants, no crash



Noticeable improvements after consistent use



Supports both mind and body



Manufactured with high quality standards



Vegan, non-GMO, free of common allergens



Cons:



Takes a few weeks to fully notice effects (not instant)



Slightly higher price point than typical energy supplements



Only available online (not sold in physical stores easily)



Who Might Benefit from Mitolyn?

In my opinion, Mitolyn is a fantastic choice if you:



Feel chronically tired, even with enough sleep



Struggle with focus, memory, or mental sharpness



Want better exercise performance and recovery



Are interested in slowing the aging process naturally



Prefer science-backed, non-stimulant supplements



However, if you‚Äôre just looking for a quick caffeine buzz, Mitolyn probably isn‚Äôt for you.

This is a supplement for people who want deep, lasting improvements.



Is Mitolyn Worth the Money?

Short answer: Yes, absolutely ‚Äî especially if you care about your long-term energy, brain health, and vitality.



I see Mitolyn as an investment. Instead of spending money every day on coffees, energy drinks, or ""band-aid"" supplements, I‚Äôm fueling my body to produce its own energy more efficiently.



Given the quality of ingredients, the careful formulation, and the results I've personally experienced, I think the value is definitely there.



Final Thoughts: Would I Recommend Mitolyn?

Without hesitation, yes.

Mitolyn is now part of my daily health stack, and I plan to keep using it for the long term.

If you‚Äôre serious about feeling more energized, more focused, and more resilient, Mitolyn is absolutely worth a try.

Just give it time ‚Äî think of it as building your foundation, not putting up a quick tent.

# Best antique Mirror tray 2025: Find Your Perfect style

The Antique mirror tray is more than just a serving piece; it's a statement of style and elegance. This seemingly simple object can transform a coffee table, elevate a bar setup, or add a touch of glamour to a vanity. In 2025,antique mirror trays continue to be a popular choice for discerning homeowners and decorators looking to infuse a sense of vintage charm and sophistication into their living spaces. Choosing the right antique mirror tray involves considering its style, size, material, and overall aesthetic to ensure it complements your existing decor and serves its intended purpose with grace.## Key Features Analysis

Antique mirror trays are defined by a blend of functional design and decorative appeal. The quality of construction, the detailing of the frame, and the integrity of the mirrored surface all contribute to its overall value and aesthetic.

**Mirror Quality**

the mirror itself is obviously paramount. High-quality antique mirror trays utilize a mirrored surface that is resistant to scratching and provides a clear, undistorted reflection. Some trays feature intentionally distressed or antiqued mirror finishes, which create the illusion of age and add to the vintage character. Look for even distribution of the antiquing effect and ensure the mirror is securely attached to the tray's base.

**Frame Material and Construction**

The frame not only provides structural support but also dictates the tray's overall style.Common frame materials include metal alloys (such as brass, copper, or silver-plated options), wood (frequently enough painted or lacquered), and even resin.The frame construction should be sturdy, with strong joints and a smooth, even finish. Consider the detailing of the frame, such as intricate carvings, filigree designs, or geometric patterns, which can substantially enhance the tray's visual appeal.**Size and shape**

Antique mirror trays come in various sizes and shapes to accommodate different needs. Smaller, rectangular trays are ideal for holding perfumes or jewelry on a vanity, while larger, round trays work well as decorative centerpieces on a coffee table or as a serving surface for drinks. Choose a size and shape that complement the items you intend to display or serve on the tray and consider the dimensions of the space where it will be placed.

**Handles and Feet**

The presence of handles and feet affects both the tray's functionality and its aesthetic. Handles make it easier to carry the tray, especially when loaded with items.Look for handles that are securely attached and agreeable to grip.Feet, whether simple or ornate, elevate the tray slightly, protecting the surface it rests on and adding visual interest. The material and style of the handles and feet should coordinate with the overall design of the tray.

**Finish and detailing**

The finish refers to the surface treatment applied to the frame and other components of the tray. Common finishes include polished metal, painted wood, and antiqued treatments.The finish should be durable and resistant to tarnishing or chipping. Detailing, such as decorative moldings, engraved patterns, or inlaid accents, can add to the tray's visual richness and ancient character.

**Weight Capacity**

Consider the weight capacity of the tray, especially if you intend to use it for serving drinks or displaying heavy objects. A well-constructed tray should be able to support a reasonable amount of weight without bending or buckling. Heavier trays often indicate more robust construction.

This is particularly useful for protecting delicate surfaces such as wood or glass.

## FAQs Section

**How do I clean an antique mirror tray without damaging it?**

To clean an antique mirror tray, use a soft, lint-free cloth dampened with a mild glass cleaner or a solution of water and vinegar. Avoid abrasive cleaners or scouring pads, which can scratch the mirrored surface or damage the frame. Gently wipe the mirror and the frame, and then dry with a clean cloth.

**How do I determine the value of an antique mirror tray?**
The value of an antique mirror tray depends on several factors, including its age, condition, material, craftsmanship, and provenance. Look for identifying marks or signatures that can help determine its origin and authenticity. Examine the tray for any damage or repairs, as these can affect its value. Research similar trays that have been sold at auctions or antique stores to get an idea of its market value. Consulting with an appraiser or antique expert can also provide a more accurate assessment.

(Yes, I‚Äôve navigated my fair share of ‚ÄúSijilat‚Äù quirks, from the Diplomatic Area‚Äôs maze-like registration counters to charm-offensive majlis meetings with key officials.)\
Welcome to 2025, where Bahrain‚Äôs business climate is stronger than ever‚Äîyet regulatory discipline is under the spotlight, and penalties for non-compliance are no joke.\
The Current Bahrain Business Environment: Growth, Opportunity, and Regulatory Change\
\
Alt text: Business environment in modern Bahrain business district., Bahrain‚Äôs non-oil sector is projected to grow 4.1% this year (Reuters, May 2025). Financial services, ICT, and manufacturing are thriving, while fintech continues to pull regional attention‚Äîthe Bahrain Bay area now rivals the Dubai DIFC for startup buzz.\
\
""Bahrain‚Äôs pro-business reforms continue to draw international investors, with streamlined company formation and competitive fees compared to its Gulf neighbors.""\
‚ÄîReuters\
\
But with opportunity comes responsibility. The MOICT, LMRA (Labour Market Regulatory Authority), and CBB (Central Bank of Bahrain) have all tightened compliance monitoring after several high-profile lapses last year. The result: businesses are under sharper scrutiny than ever‚Äîespecially foreign-owned entities and startups in free zones.\
Surprisingly, one major upside of Bahrain‚Äôs regulatory evolution is its business-friendly digital infrastructure. Tools like Sijilat (the government e-portal for company registrations) and EDB‚Äôs startup concierge create a transparent, trackable compliance framework.\
For a full roadmap on entity setup, rules, and eligible activities, I recommend checking company formation in Bahrain for a practical overview.\
Penalties for Non-Compliance: The Real Financial Cost\
What Does ""Non-Compliance"" Actually Cover?\
When we talk compliance, we‚Äôre dealing with:\
- MOICT company registration and renewal rules\
- CBB financial filing and audit requirements\
- VAT and tax filings (NBR)\
- LMRA labor, visa, and Bahrainization quotas\
- Tamkeen and industry-specific permits\
Each carries its own penalty framework‚Äîmiss a single item, and both your company and responsible individuals (that‚Äôs you, the director or manager) are on the line.\
Typical Penalties: BHD Figures\
\
Alt text: Legal compliance and documentation in Bahrain.\
- License suspension: Repeat or severe failures (like undocumented capital or non-renewal) can result in your CR (Commercial Registration) being frozen until resolved\
- Criminal prosecution: For fraud, falsified records, or AML (Anti-Money Laundering) violations‚Äîpenalties can reach BHD 20,000+, with imprisonment for egregious breaches\
- Daily accumulating fines: Some infractions trigger BHD 10‚Äì50/day in cumulative penalties (e.g., ongoing late labor fee payments)\
- Blacklist and business ban: Severe or repeated breaches place directors or entities on a government watchlist, barring future setup\
Check the official government portal and MOICT regulations for updated thresholds and filing requirements.\
Recent 2025 Regulatory Changes You Need to Know\
Importantly, from January 2025, the MOICT implemented a new tiered penalty system for late CR renewals:\
- First 30 days late: BHD 100 fine\
- 31-60 days late: BHD 300 fine, system red-flag\
- Past 60 days: CR suspension, mandatory reactivation fee (BHD 500+) and potential blacklisting\
  (Personal aside: I once misjudged Ramadan operating hours when preparing a client‚Äôs renewal. The automated cutoff hit at 2 PM‚Äîone minute late, our CR was frozen. Lesson learned: never cut it close during seasonal hours.)\
AML & KYC Crackdown\
The Central Bank of Bahrain‚Äôs 2025 update to its Anti-Money Laundering framework means:\
- KYC and beneficial owner filings are now inspected quarterly, not just annually\
- Non-compliance can trigger BHD 5,000+ per breach, asset freezes, and direct reporting to international bodies\
I strongly suggest using a trusted local accounting and compliance service like KeyLink's Bahrain bookkeeping and compliance team‚Äîthey know the MOICT backchannels and shortcut document prep.\
Types of Business Structures & Foreign Ownership Penalties\
\
Alt text: Business structure and collaboration in Bahrain.)\
- Up to 99% foreign ownership for some regulated sectors (99% foreign ownership details)\
- Local sponsorship requirements for specific commercial/retail trades (Local sponsorship explained)\
Failure to comply (such as illegal hidden nominee directors or false shareholding declarations) leads to CR cancellation and fines of BHD 2,000‚Äì10,000, with full asset forfeiture possible.\
Common mistake: New founders sometimes use informal nominee arrangements, not realizing MOICT‚Äôs recent AI-based background checks can flag discrepancies in minutes. Always follow legal business types and proper structures.\
Step-by-Step: How to Stay Compliant and Avoid Penalties\
1. Preparing Your Documents the Smart Way\
\
Alt text: Business process and documentation in Bahrain.\
- CR printout (original + PDF)\
- Director/owner Bahrain ID or passport\
- Shareholder resolution (witnessed‚Äîmajlis-style, if dealing with family firms)\
Avoid queues: Submit online before 10:00 AM‚Äîpaperwork processed earlier faces fewer system bottlenecks, and you‚Äôll bypass the mid-day rush at Bahrain Bay‚Äôs service counters.\
2. Key Timing and Application Shortcuts\
Pro move: Schedule your CR renewal at least 30 days before expiry. If you must visit Sijilat in-person, Seef District‚Äôs branch typically has shorter queues than the Diplomatic Area hub (personal experience: under 20 minutes versus 90+!). During Ramadan, target mornings‚Äîmost staff break early for prayer and iftar prep.\
3. Budget for Compliance: What Will It Cost?\
\
Alt text: Financial planning and costs of compliance in Bahrain.\
Full breakdown here\
- Annual MOICT fee: BHD 50-250, depending on sector\
- Audit & bookkeeping services: BHD 500+\
- Annual VAT/tax filings: BHD 100-400 (outsourced)\
- Labor/LMRA compliance: BHD 72 per expat work visa per year\
Late filings and errors? Penalties can quickly surpass annual compliance budgets. My advice: set calendar reminders for every key deadline, and use an outsourced accounting and compliance team if you lack in-house expertise.\
Practical Examples: Lessons From the Field\
Case 1: VAT Filing Delay\
A client in Bahrain Bay missed the quarterly VAT deadline by three days. Result: BHD 1,500 in fines, bank account temporarily locked. We automated calendar alerts and centralized all NBR logins so no deadline could slip through the cracks again.\
Case 2: Undeclared Shareholder\
A startup in Seef District tried to onboard a silent partner without official KYC updates. MOICT audit flagged the discrepancy. They faced a BHD 3,000 fine and 2-week CR suspension. Solution: transparent shareholder filings, with real-time tracking via Sijilat.\
Case 3: LMRA Work Visa Quota Breach\
An IT consultancy exceeded its expat quota by hiring two extra engineers. LMRA imposed a daily BHD 20 penalty per worker, accruing to BHD 580 before they resolved it. Lesson: always check your approved quota on the LMRA portal, especially after team expansions.\
Bahrain Business Culture: How Customs Influence Compliance\
One tangent that at first glance seems unrelated: traditional Bahraini business networking, particularly the majlis (informal reception meetings), can be pivotal for navigating tricky regulatory situations. During Ramadan, for instance, business hours compress and deals pivot around communal iftar gatherings. Misreading these social cues or ignoring customary coffee service can stall permits, even if your documents are flawless.\
(And yes, learning the coffee etiquette can help forge the relationships you need for last-minute CR approvals.)\
Bahrain vs. UAE & Saudi: Compliance Landscape Comparison\
Bahrain‚Äôs streamlined, mostly digital compliance system is a major advantage‚Äîthere‚Äôs less bureaucracy than Saudi (where sponsorship and 5+ signatory processes can bog you down) and lower costs than UAE (where DED and free zone fees stack up fast).\
However, Bahrain‚Äôs authorities expect transparency and accurate filings; there‚Äôs little tolerance for ‚Äúgray area‚Äù workarounds that sometimes fly in Dubai.\
Recommended Support Resources\
\
Alt text: Professional business support and consultation in Bahrain. combines on-the-ground legal expertise with local fixer know-how‚Äîideal for expats and SMEs.\
And for sector-specific questions, I recommend the official Bahrain government portal and Gulf News Bahrain business section for up-to-the-minute regulatory and economic developments.\
Common Entrepreneur Mistakes & How to Prevent Them\
Common pitfall: Overlooking minor annual filings (like commercial address updates or shareholder changes). The new Sijilat system now cross-checks your address against utility bills and lease contracts automatically; a mismatch, no matter how innocent, will get you instantly flagged.\
\
Prevention: Run a monthly internal compliance audit. Review your Sijilat dashboard for alerts, and keep lease contracts up-to-date with utilities registered in the company‚Äôs CR name.\
Tip: If you get flagged, respond within 72 hours‚Äîyou‚Äôll avoid most administrative fines.\
\
FAQ: Bahrain Company Formation, Compliance & Penalties\
1. How quickly do Bahrain authorities enforce compliance penalties?\
Usually within 14 days for MOICT or VAT-related issues, often with automated system flags. For major (AML or KYC) breaches, enforcement can be immediate and severe.\
2. Can late compliance be resolved without paying the full penalty?\
Sometimes, yes‚Äîif you act fast and demonstrate good faith, MOICT may reduce or waive the first penalty (but never count on it). The sooner you fix the breach and communicate, the better.\
3. What‚Äôs the most cost-effective way to stay compliant?\
Engage a professional accounting and compliance service for routine filings. Cost: BHD 500-1,200/year, far cheaper than paying recurring fines.\
See company formation cost breakdown.\
4. Are compliance requirements different in Bahrain free zones?\
Free zones offer easier customs and labor rules, but still require strict Sijilat and LMRA filings. Explore free zone benefits here.\
5. Where can I get fast and reliable support for urgent compliance issues?\
Use an experienced formation agent with a direct MOICT channel‚Äîsee KeyLink‚Äôs Bahrain team or consult your local Tamkeen advisor for hands-on support.\
\
Bahrain offers tremendous opportunity, but compliance is non-negotiable. Stay ahead of deadlines, invest in the right professional help, and build trust with both officials and business partners. That way, your view from that Seef District office will always be worry-free.\
