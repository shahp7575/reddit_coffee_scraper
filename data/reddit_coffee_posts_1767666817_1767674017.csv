I received my aeropress for Christmas, and just can’t seem to get the hang of it. My typical recipe has been 14g coffee, 220g water, not inverted because I have a fellow prismo. I let it brew for 1:30 and press for 1:00. All of the videos/posts I have seen have conflicting info on whether to go coarser or finer, as well as longer/shorter for brew time. If it helps, I don’t have a temperature control kettle, I just wait for about 30 seconds after a boil. I typically use light-medium roast coffee out of an oxo conical burr grinder and have been able to get good pour overs with said kettle/grinder combo. Any help is appreciated as I’m very excited to get the hang of it. ",1,1767673856.0,AeroPress,0,1.0,False

For my first entry, the Pleasantville Rd. Reservoir, which the junior league of Tarrytown fights to save with the help of Henry Francis. 

The reservoir is very real, and along that road. The attention to detail on this show is astounding. 

I’m not sure if it was ever under threat like in the show, but if Betty and Co. hadn’t succeeded this lovely park would not be there today. Many small towns across the area have reservoirs that are no longer in use. Tarrytown (of the junior league), being one of them. 

Ossining does not drink this water anymore, but it’s a lovely lakeside park in suburbia. Ossinings water now comes from the croton reservoir, an extremely large reservoir that also feeds NYC at times. 

Any suggestions where I should cover next??

She was a liar. The little envelopes of cash I mailed every month went to her. To one of her other little houses. 

""I was helping you save. For after."" 

This was a special courtesy, I suppose reserved for family. 

The first September, I liked my little house. It was old, and the chipped gray paint reminded me of wool. All the brass fixtures had worn from where hands have touched over the years.  
The water dispensed from a well and the mineral smell was pleasant. Couldn't drink it though. I bought all my water in gallon jugs from the convenience store. It was the closest shop for a couple of miles.

When the wind picked up in October, the sound was shallow enough to mistake for the leaves. The house was bordered on all sides by woods and sat behind the road against 80 acres of privately owned preserve.

By Halloween, the sound had picked up and I thought it might've been trick-or-treaters. That night, I kept checking through the blinds over and over. I thought I was going mad because there wasn't a single kid in sight. No chaperones, no bands of teenagers.  
  
By 11 PM, it was only getting louder.

Anxiety got the best of me and I grabbed my keys, threw open the door, ran down the steps, and jumped in my truck. There had to be someone, even though there were no streetlights on that road. About a mile down the road, when I cracked the windows for air, it was clear for the first time.  
  
Like applause in a ballroom, from everywhere.  
Men and women's voices in commending tones, glasses tapping against plate rims.

By the last mile I'd worked myself into partial visibility. My eyes have always watered when nervous. I still hate this about myself. It's like cowardice leaking from my head.  
I nearly parked sideways in the convenience store lot.

""Yeah?"" 

Jesse, the clerk, said. I must've been standing for a moment too long inside the door.

""You don't hear that?""

I asked her before realizing the sound had stopped. 

November 1st, I called my aunt again. She didn't pick up after I'd gotten home the night before. My claims were brushed off as ""holiday spirit after too many spirits,"" after I'd admitted to having a few drinks. We didn't speak again until Thanksgiving. I'd thought with her whimsical nature she'd be more receptive to my story. This frustrated me. I didn't know it yet but I was frustrated for the wrong reasons.

Throughout the month I was beyond shaken. I began to hear it during the daytime. It was inconsistent but more frequent. The first morning that it came, I didn't believe something so dreamlike could happen in the light.  
  
I awoke to cheers outside my window and echoing clacks of string instruments settling against floorboards. I bolted upright and slapped my curtain aside. Nothing was there except for the stretch of grass before the tree line.

By the 16th I called out of work. It was too much to hear it while making coffee and then pretend things were normal. I called out on the 17th too. This was unlike me but my supervisor didn't make things difficult.  
  
During those days I mostly waited. Then moved, then waited. I sat on the couch with the window cracked. Once I heard the applause I stood and put my ear to the sill. It stopped.  
I laid on my bed until it sounded again but once I stepped into the living room, it stopped. When it was quiet for a while, around noon, I went outside and sat on the side-porch steps.

I sat for an hour. The bare branches of the hickory trees clacked together close to the sky, in a wind so gentle. Feeling very settled I concentrated on my pulse, rhythmic and steady.  
The gravel soft and loose under my shoes. It was a rare moment of stillness for me. Contentment.

A sudden gust came and the sound erupted from beyond the trees. So much laughter, from the gut and bottom of the lungs. A crowd erupting in response to what must've been the most outrageous thing ever said. A hundred chairs creaked as if bodies were shifting back and forth, glasses shook as hands slammed down on clothed wooden tables.

I jolted forwards and fell to the dirt from the porch step. The laughter crescendoed. I nearly snapped my neck looking in all directions. At this point, it was the most frightened I'd ever been. Eyes wide, hot and watery. The tears escaped down my cheeks as I scrambled backwards towards my door.

1q58nak,https://www.reddit.com/r/sugarfree/comments/1q58nak/starting_slow/,Starting slow!,"Hello, how is everyone’s sugar free new year resolutions looking?

Here’s my little story:

I’ve been on a gluten free diet due to extreme stomach issues and have definitely been cheating the past 5 months. The last time I had pasta a little over a week ago, I had a stomach ache really bad for 3 days. So I’m not cheating again no matter how good it tastes.

I also cut out milk products because I’m lactose intolerant.

My goal is to cut out inflammation so I can carry a baby to term.

SUGAR STORY:

I didn’t decide cold turkey, but I know I wanted to reduce. The only thing I’ve done is cut out unnecessary sugar. I didn’t have any chocolate, little candy snacks from Halloween, or even a sip of my partners cola. I’ve been drinking water. I want my orange juice, but I’m also a little hesitant on that.

I had strawberries which naturally have sugar and I think I’m okay with that in moderation for my body.

Today I had bread (gluten free, but I didn’t check for sugar) and I had the little restaurant to-go marmalade and raspberry jam on each slice respectively. I found it so sweet it didn’t really taste good, but I finished it. I had a coffee.

I had a spoon full of regular processed white sugar ready to pour in and I just stopped. used a ‘Sugar In The Raw’ teaspoon packet in my coffee and considered that a step forward. A healthier type of sugar.

The homemade Phở I had today has some rock sugar in the recipe, a golf ball size to 4 quarts of water, so not terrible. 

Today was the most sugar I’ve had since December 30th and I’ve had a headache. I don’t know if that’s correlated, but I don’t get headaches at all usually. I’m also pretty tired haha

Sugar may not be out of my life yet, but I’m making steps towards it and I am VERY impulsive and it’s hard for me to resist. I think it helps that I’m trying to heal my body and I’m very determined to have my rainbow baby this year. 

How is everyone else’s journey going? I want to know if someone is especially in the same spot as me, just testing the waters. ",1,1767673248.0,sugarfree,0,1.0,False

1q58m2v,https://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromTheCreeps/comments/1q58m2v/the_red_hills/,The Red Hills,"I'll be the first to admit that I have problems stepping outside of my comfort zone. That's probably what kept me in this small town for so long, while all my friends moved away. This place was familiar to me, and for a long time, that's what I thought I needed. Over time, though, I realized that my life had just become stagnant. I was stuck in a job that bored me, hung out with the same group of co-workers at the same bars week after week.

So, I finally decided to follow my mother's advice and apply for a high-profile position at a big tech company. I lived in a pretty rural area, so I had to drive several hours on Highway 52 just to get there for the interview. It's not like I wasn't used to drives like this. Out here in the country, you had to drive a hundred miles to get anywhere important. I'd gone to the city enough times that it was routine; the journey went by in a blur, and before I knew it, I was there.

I honestly don't remember much of the interview, considering how the rest of the day went. But, it went well enough that they were going to call me for a second interview some time soon. I left the city somewhat excited, but anxious. If everything went well, it would be a huge change in my life.

Like I said, I'd driven on Highway 52 enough times that it was almost automatic to me. I barely even noticed my surroundings, zoning out for the few hours it took to get home. So, it honestly didn't register for quite some time that something wasn't right.

I must have glanced at the clock at some point and noticed it was getting later than I expected. I'd been driving for too long; I should have been home by now. Had I somehow missed my exit while I was zoning out?

When I finally snapped out of my stupor and looked around, I realized didn't know where I was. My part of the country was pretty hilly, but there were enough farms and towns along the way to break up the monotony. Now, though, there was nothing but rolling hills in every direction. There were no fields, or even any trees or bushes. It was fairly late in the year, so the grass was sparse and dried out. Beneath the grass, nothing but reddish soil. On top of that, a heavy fog had somehow rolled in without my notice.

I was already anxious, finding myself in unfamiliar territory, looking for an exit I could use to turn myself around. But no exit came, and the longer I drove, the more strange details I noticed. There was no other traffic on the highway with me. I was used to long stretches of empty highway this far out in the country, but I don't think I had seen a single other car for at least an hour—not on my side or the opposite side. There were no mile markers either, which I realized while trying to orient myself. Nor did I pass near any small towns. Or buildings, or any sign of civilization.

I opened the navigation app on my phone, but I had no signal. Naturally. Not like I had seen a single cell tower either. However far I drove, there was nothing but red, featureless hills.

What should I do? Just turn around and go back the way I came? My gas was getting low; I had started with enough gas to get to the city and back. Now I didn't know if I had enough to get back to the city if I turned around. Would it be safer to just keep going until I reach civilization?

As I just kept driving, heart pounding, paralyzed by indecision, I finally saw something that flooded my heart with relief. A rest area.

I quickly pulled off the highway. This was definitely a very modern rest area—the kind that had a convenience store, fuel pumps, free wifi, the works. I didn't see any other cars here, but the lights were on in the convenience store, so it had to be staffed.

I didn't waste a moment pulling up to the fuel pumps to refill my tank. I pressed the “pay inside” button, and the seconds that followed—waiting for a clerk inside to approve the transaction—felt like hours. To my great relief, the word “approved” flashed across the screen. I set the pump to fill automatically, then rushed inside to get my bearings.

Inside, it was quiet, aside from the faintly-playing pop music. It was brightly lit, and very clean and tidy. I could even smell the lingering scent of freshly used floor cleaner. But, I saw no one else here. I went straight to the counter and called out for a worker. After no response, I wandered into the other parts of the rest area. There was no one in the freshly cleaned restrooms. No one restocking merchandise. No one smoking outside. I even intruded into the employee break area in the back.

There could be no doubt; no one was here.

I stood for a long time by the hot food area. The hot dogs on the roller grill were still fresh. The carafe of creamer next to the coffee station was still cold. Someone put these out recently. *Someone* had to have been here. Maybe there was an emergency and they had to leave in a hurry, and if I waited long enough, they would be right back. Someone had to come back soon.

The sun was going down. How long could I wait? What if no one ever came? Should I just sleep here? Should I keep driving?

I took another walk around the convenience store, hoping to find a map or something that might indicate exactly where I was, and then noticed a rack of keychains. I flipped through them, noting several generic ones featuring my state or hobbyist themed keychains. Then I came to a peculiar set. A few large rectangular keychains were decorated the same red, rolling hills I'd been staring at the for the last several hours. Across them, in kitschy, blocky text: “I visited The Red Hills.”

I turned one over in my hand curiously. In all the years I've lived in this state, I've never heard of the Red Hills. Even though I was sure I hadn't taken a wrong turn, I wondered if I had somehow wandered out of the state entirely.

I was snapped back to the present by a sudden chime, followed by the sound of the rest stop's automatic doors opening. I quickly whirled around to see who had come in. I shouldn't have been surprised that there was no one there. The doors simply hung open for a few seconds, revealing the clear sky and red hills in the distance, then slid closed.

Then, a *wham* from the opposite direction startled me; the familiar sound of a cooler door slamming closed. I whipped around again. The entire cooler section of the store was within sight. But again, there was no one.

I'd had enough. I quickly ran back to my car, hung up the pump handle, locked the doors, and started the engine. For a few moments, I simply gripped the wheel, my knuckles white, my heart pounding in my head. I had to get out of here. I had to get home. I put my hand on the gearshift and pulled it into drive. That's when I remembered.

Wifi!

If the gas station really was fully operational, even if I couldn't find anyone, the free wifi should be working. My hands shaking, I fumbled for my phone and quickly unlocked it to see if there was a signal. To my overwhelming relief, there was—a weak one, but still a signal. I quickly opened the map application to see where I actually was.

There was my marker, right on the highway marked 52. So, at least I was still on the right road. I just needed to figure out where the nearest city was. So, I pinched my fingers on the screen to zoom out.

I paused, then zoomed out again. Then again. I watched the distance scale in the corner of the screen adjust accordingly. So why was nothing else appearing? At this scale, the entire state should be visible on the screen. But, according to the map, there was nothing. No exits. No crossroads. No rivers, parks, or cities. Only the highway. And the hills.

Then the wifi signal was gone.

“Fuck this,” I muttered under my breath. I peeled out of the parking lot and back onto the highway.

I didn't even care about the rules anymore; my pedal was to the floor. I had to get out of here before I ran out of gas, or out of sanity. The sun was getting low, and I felt in the back of my mind that if I didn't get home before night fell, then I wouldn't be getting home at all.

Yet, night came. I watched the hills turn from red to a ruddy brown, until finally, darkness consumed everything. All I could see was the road before me illuminated by headlights. There were no stars or distant city lights.

It was only when everything became pitch black when I first saw the eyes. A pair of pinprick lights flying by to my right, close to the road, but just far enough away that their body wasn't illuminated by the headlights. A few minutes later, another pair of eye on the opposite side.

Just animals, I tried to tell myself. Just deer or something, loitering by the highway. I kept trying to find explanations, even as the eyes became more frequent. I kept trying to make sense of everything, even when it seemed as though crowds of animals were gathering along the sides of the road. All of them staying just out of reach of the light.

I ran out of explanations when I looked in my rearview mirror. There were the eyes, no longer white, but a faint red from the glow of my brake lights. Chasing me. Keeping pace with my car, even at the breakneck speed I was going. I watched more eyes gather behind them, bobbing up and down, weaving left and right. My eyes were fixed on the rearview mirror, watching the eyes, and in the corner of the mirror, I could see my own face streaked with tears.

Ever so gradually, they were gaining on me. The one at the front of the pack was just coming close enough to the brake lights that I could faintly make out its form.

A pair of headlights and the blasting of a car horn snapped my attention back to the road.

My heart jumped into my throat as I wrenched the steering wheel violently to the side, narrowly missing the oncoming car by inches. I slammed on the brakes, my tires squealing on the pavement as I hurtled from one side of the road to the other, before sliding to a stop on the shoulder.

I sat in my seat for what felt like hours, my heart pounding in my head, my hands burning from gripping the steering wheel so tightly. There were no thoughts, just raw adrenaline pumping through my veins. It wasn't until another pair headlights passed that I actually looked around.

I was still on Highway 52, but now there was traffic. Behind me, in front of me, and in the opposite lane. I could see the lights of a town just up ahead—no more than a couple miles away. My town. A sort of static filled my brain, trying to comprehend how I had been lost in some liminal space for hours, only to end up right at my own doorstep.

I simply couldn't process it anymore. Almost robotically, I eased my foot off the brakes, rolling back onto the highway and finishing my journey home.

I told this story many times in the months since my experience. No one's ever heard of those Red Hills anywhere along the highway. Aside from a supernatural forum I visited a couple times, most people believe I just fell asleep at the wheel. I don't really blame them; I'd very much like to believe that my journey could be attributed to something so simple. Were I in their shoes, I certainly wouldn't believe that story.

Thankfully, I did end up getting that job, and it's been one of the best jobs I've ever had. Ever since, I've made that commute back and forth to the big city on Highway 52—very nervously for the first several weeks. But, I never did find myself among those hills again.

I would probably rest easier believing that it never happened. But there's also a certain amount of relief from knowing that it did happen. I will always have proof that my experience is real.

I must have put it in my pocket without realizing it, back in that rest area. Now, I hang it next to my computer, always within reach, reminding me that I hadn't lost my mind. That little, gaudy keychain that reads, “I visited the Red Hills.”",1,1767673154.0,TalesFromTheCreeps,2,1.0,False

I’m arriving tomorrow afternoon (4ish) in Kona and would really appreciate some last-minute advice from locals or people familiar with the Big Island.

I currently have only one night booked near the airport, and I’m trying to decide how best to set myself up for the rest of my stay (5 nights).

Main question:

Would you recommend using Kona as a home base and doing longer day trips around the island, or does that get tiring with the drive times?

I’d love to explore many parts of the island (including Volcanoes NP), but I’m unsure if driving back to Kona each day is realistic/enjoyable or if it’s better to stay in different areas for a night or two.

Is there anywhere relatively central on the island, or is Kona realistically as good as it gets for a base?

For tomorrow evening:

After picking up my rental car and checking in, I’d love a local dinner recommendation in or near Kona.

• Poke would be amazing (but open to anything)

• Definitely hoping to avoid places that feel touristy or frozen food heavy

Also for the next morning:

Local coffee spots in Kona that are great for an early start? I’m a big coffee lover and would love to support a local roaster or café.

For Wednesday:

I’m debating whether to go straight to Volcanoes National Park, or save that for Thursday and spend Wednesday closer to Kona exploring something more local if that makes more sense.

If you were in my shoes, freshly landed, early start the next day what would you do?

Thanks so much in advance. I really appreciate any insight",2,1767672585.0,VisitingHawaii,5,1.0,False

Hello Humans. 

A few of us are planning a small, relaxed meetup near Deccan today around 6 PM.
At the moment, it’s me (female), one male Redditor, and a few others who may join.

This post is especially to encourage women to join, so the space feels balanced, comfortable, and safe. The plan is simple—coffee, light conversation, and good vibes. No pressure, no awkwardness.

This is a strictly casual, platonic meetup—no flirting or dating vibes, just friendly conversation and a calm evening out.

A couple of important things to keep it smooth for everyone:

• My DMs are closed — I’ll reach out if your profile fits

• NSFW profiles aren’t allowed (sorry, keeping it clean)

• LinkedIn ID sharing is mandatory before joining, purely for safety and vibe check

If you’re nearby Deccan and feel like stepping out for an easy, drama-free evening, drop a comment 🙂

It started three months ago when I was studying in another city. I began to fall asleep during lectures, and got to a point where coffee wouldn’t keep me up. I was behind on a lot of material and I barely fit in with the other students. I got burnt out and decided to stop the studies and move back home. The university I went to was my dream university and I worked so hard to get in, so I was disappointed and dissatisfied over myself. But I couldn’t bring myself to continue. I got exhausted from all that, and needed a break from school.

I got back home two months ago, and I relaxed for 2-3 weeks, and decided to go back to my hobbies and work towards driver’s license. That lastet for a little while until I got into a fight with my father, which put me back down again. We talked it out, and things got better again. Motivation was building again and I was ready to start working. My sister works at a cinema, and helped me get a job there. I got my schedule and setup in the system, but then my sister decided she didn’t want to work with me after all, and that she felt she got pressured by out parents. That knocked me down again seeing as it was one of my only points of motivation at that point.

I also found out my father had downloaded dating apps, despite being married to my mother, which made me very conflicted and confused, and it took a toll on me. Ended up smashing my guitar into the wall in the buildup of infuriation and basically anger from the last two months (guitar is fine, wall not so much). I managed to clear it up with my parents, but it all still stings.

And now, I almost feel repulsed just thinking about playing the guitar. Even just listening to music feels more burdening. I’ve lost my love for music. I also used to be an avid gamer, but gaming feels more draining than giving. Reading also feels just taxing and my sleepschedule is just barely hanging on. All I do now is just lay in bed and watch stuff on my tablet. Everything just feels so draining, and I wish I had the motivation to at least do the things I enjoy now that I got the time to do so.",1,1767671871.0,helpme,1,1.0,False

* Enjoy creative, collaborative activities
* Are looking for community around personal growth and intentional living
* Prefer small group settings to loud bars or rushed coffee chats

1q57xay,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1q57xay/my_stupid_crush_saga/,My stupid crush saga,"I had a crush on this guy I worked with. It was relatively short lived at its most serious, but being the emotional person I am who feels things quite deeply, such things leave their impression on me. My saving grace is having ADHD which allows me to hyper focus on equally pointless things.

We worked together intermittently between about 2015 and 2020, initially when I was a student nurse on the ward where he was a permanent member of staff.  Later during this time period I was often sent to this ward when I needed to earn extra money as a temp worker.

Then the pandemic happened and our employers sent us off in different directions. 

We were never connected on social media but I knew his surname from his ID which was displayed on the wall, something the NHS do to make patients “feel at home” or whatever. Whilst I did pay attention to this once the crush happened, remembering such things is a foregone conclusion for me due to a photographic memory. 

I always liked him /was intrigued by him from day one because he was just different: quiet, confident in his own way, quirky humour, a bit of a mystery (especially as he came from

another country), a loner it seemed - I’m thatsense perhaps similar to me then; but not particularly friendly at first. The point is, he was interesting. I had a boyfriend at least twice during the time I knew him and I didn’t work there more often until later. Whether I got  sent to this ward or somewhere else in the hospital was a lottery on arrival, depending on who the head nurse decided to send where. In any case, I often got sent there and even without him there it was my favourite ward. 

During this time he was a lot more talkative with me but he seemed shy or lacking in confidence in some way but I’m the same so it’s not like we’re gonna be chatting immediately. But unfortunately this made me like him more. Then one day after handing over on a shift one night when I was obviously unhappy/exhausted, he stepped over to me and hugged me. He then left abruptly.

Not only that but when passing me at night time during busy and stressful shifts there’d be other brief arm rubs and friendly gestures.

Getting to chat was a problem because we were always so busy. And so my frustration began. 

I’d just been through the second breakup earlier that year: Cue for me developing a  massive crush on the basis of these few potentially meaningless gestures and interactions, made much worse by the frustration of our interactions being unpredictable and not within my control. 

Other further interactions involved frequent glances at each other across the chaos and an awkward conversation outside where he seemed a bit defensive. Not much to work with so, okay fine, it’s probably nothing, but my heart is not very good at listening to basic logic. 

And then one night I randomly had this ridiculous nightmare where I dreamed he got “taken” by another woman and had a girlfriend . You know when you have a dream about someone you know platonically and then you develop a weird crush? This was a twisted version of that for someone I was already crushing on. I woke up feeling really distressed and upset, and rather than ignoring an actual dream, I thought: what if we never run into each other again? This is stupid! Let me do something! I’ve nothing to lose! 

Oh GOD.

So when I next ran into him, which happened to be in a busy shop outside the hospital maybe a couple of weeks later, I started to actually chat and this was definitely awkward, he’s carrying a heavy basket of shopping but I gave him my phone number for “coffee sometime” anyway because what the hell. 

Did he call? Absolutely not. He didn’t even text to say “hey”.

One of my male friends: “maybe he was just playing with you for an ego boost”. Possible but I wasn’t sure. Maybe I’d scared him. Maybe he likes quiet women and I’d now ruined that image. 

But I might have never run into him again, so…

And then I got another boyfriend later that year, and yes, that tuned out to be my fourth heartbreak during this period of my life which i have come to refer to as the shit before the storm. 

When I next saw him it was 18 months later on a crazy shift during the height of the early pandemic where I now had the (mis)fortune of working on my final placement in A&E. He had come in to deliver something to one of my colleagues. He was smiling and seemed pleased to see me. Again, usual problem of not being able to speak because: craziness which has now amplified ten fold. And granted, I know it might have felt awkward, but \*Why don’t you just text me?\*

Next day, as I’m approaching the hospital for my night shift, he happens to be coming out of his apartment, and the same thing the day after. Again,  he looks interested to see me but I can’t stop and neither could he; this was London and the street is overcrowded and I have to be on time. But in my (delusional?)state of mind, I imagine he deliberately left his home at the same time the shifts were due to change, just in case he saw me. 

There was a vibe with this guy. I did not imagine  it. I’m the least confident person in many ways and whilst back then I sometimes turned heads, it wasn’t a constant thing. It felt like something more personal and potentially sweet. And crush or not, I genuinely liked him.  I just didn’t know what to do or say. The ball was officially in his court. 

He never texted or called though. 

Okay, so perhaps I did imagine it. 

Since then, crazy shit happened in my life , as it does, I’ve relocated to a different part of the country and whilst I almost did take a permanent job at that hospital, life intervened and I’ve not had any reason to return to there. I have not thought about it for a long time. 

Yesterday something reminded me of him (don’t ask me what: my long term memory is excellent I can’t remember yesterday) and on a whim, I randomly looked him up on Facebook and see he has a profile. It’s been 5 years, whats the harm? Quick check shows he’s single so no hidden wife/gf is gonna have issues with a new female friend on social media. If he’s not into me in that way, as it certainly seemed, I’d like to be friends, acquaintances, or just \*something\*.

My anxiety then kicked in after sending the friend request and I vowed not to log in for several weeks.

But of course I did, the next day, which is today. He’s not accepted my friend request, and when I do a few minutes of of digging, it turns out he has \*blocked\* me. 

To say I’m surprised would be a stretch but logically this did not occur to me as likely. I expected he’d either decline, accept or not respond. 

So….

Did he hate me? Did he think I was an aggressive stalker type?- Is this something other human beings think when you happen to remember them? Did he actively dislike me as a person? Was the act of looking him up online a basic boundary violation?  Did I used to scare him? Does he think sending a friend request means I need something from him or that I’m hitting on him? Has having covid impacted my looks so much to either make me hideous to the human eye or completely unrecognisable? 

Perhaps, most likely, he never gave me much thought at all or, since I’m only thinking of acquaintances/friendships, maybe my personality is just not appealing. I will never know because I am blocked. Now several hundred miles or possibly a whole different continent is not enough of a barrier to that one guy I crushed on badly but never really knew. 

Im not angry, indignant or offended. I’m confused and hurt to the point of physical aching in my chest. I really liked this person. The feeling, it seems, wasn’t mutual and I had no idea that was the case. I obviously can’t take a hint and I feel really dumb.

Welcome back, Watchmen!  Let's analyze!

We stood on the shores of the weekend, wondering if the Friday resurrection was a dream.  Under the light of the New Year's starry sky came the answer.  Pre-market opened with a gap up to $1.23, leaving the dollar mark far behind.  Before most of the world had their first coffee, price had already surged to test $1.38, pulled back to find footing at $1.19, and coiled for the strike.

The opening bell rang, the gates swung wide, and 17 million shares changed hands in the first few minutes alone.  Price sprung from $1.31, and after a brief pause around $1.35, launched even higher, until we tagged the psychological fortress of $1.50.

Anyone that had merchants at $0.50 was up 150% in three days.  The rejection was absolute.  Price was sent tumbling back down to test the resolve of the new buyers.  It found a floor at $1.13 in the mid-morning, carving out a massive new demand zone.  From there, the climb was mechanical.  Continuing the fight through $1.28 and reclaiming $1.35, we spent the afternoon gathering forces just outside the gates of the $1.45-$1.50 zone, closing the day at $1.44.

The After Hours session saw a brief scare, dipping to test $1.10, but price bounced back and finished at $1.39.  The battles for pennies are no more.  Now, we fight for dollars.

The Catalyst: Amidst the roar of the ticker, a new signal emerged.  DVLT has struck a deal with Available Infrastructure.  The details are technical, but the implication is massive: we are acquiring new IP to bolster the ecosystem.  But here is the shadow cast by the light—the seller of this IP is not publicly known.  Has a silent partner entered the game, handing us a weapon, and remaining in the dark?  Is it a friend?  A former enemy?  We don't know, but the market loves the mystery.  Let's look at the charts.

https://preview.redd.it/q2pehoez8nbg1.png?width=1172&format=png&auto=webp&s=a2f1936a7b798f3c4267556f8407643abdb0e736

Looking at the daily, we can officially state that the downtrend has indeed been broken.  We can see that price has regained the orange 100-day average and is rapidly approaching the 50-day as well.  This isn't something you see every day.  The price drop from $4 was so fast, the MA's didn't have time to cross back to the downside.  We may see some resistance from the 50, and likely from $1.90 as well before we place the $2 castle under siege.  Let's dive a little deeper.

https://preview.redd.it/d0udkzfeanbg1.png?width=877&format=png&auto=webp&s=ef35493ade35876c21897088c5634eea2fae4a56

Zooming in on the hourly, I would like to point out that the drop in AH absorbed all of the demand created during the normal session, and came right back to nest in that $1.40 zone.  If it had been some massive selloff, it would not have been likely to bounce back that easily.  Seems like it coincided with the re-release of the AP PR, and people got spooked before reading.  Based on the order book, and the rejection from the first test, the supply above around $1.50 should prove to be a formidable defense.  I'm sure we will see tomorrow.  Let's dive a little deeper and honor our...

Candle!

Of!

The!

Day!!!

https://preview.redd.it/etgdbwwbcnbg1.png?width=1404&format=png&auto=webp&s=09ff111c36e7b542718029f2b47ade59701229ac

Today's trophy is awarded to the highest volume, highest reaching candle of the morn!  For the briefest of moments you shared the glory of $1.50, before the greed of men pulled you away.  We appreciate your efforts, friend.

**Forecasts**:

**Best Case:** Rally continues on massive volume again, fueled by people wanting in for the record date and upcoming catalysts.  Gap up over $1.50 to open, smash resistance overhead at $1.70 and $1.90, close at/above $2.

**Worst Case:** Price bumps its head on $1.50 again from heavy profit taking.  Lower than recent volume doesn't have the strength to break it and price flounders around $1.30-$1.40.

**Most Likely:** I think we will fight over $1.50 for a bit more before volume spikes and it eventually falls.  I then see another rejection from the 50-day SMA and/or the supply @ \~$1.70 before another volume spike takes us through those.  Rejection from the \~$1.90 supply zone, closing back down around $1.60.

Season 2 was about betrayal.  Season 3 is about vengeance.  We were stabbed.  Bleeding out, and left for dead.  We were thrown into the oceans of despair, to drown in our own miseries.  We were dead, floating on the surface of an endless void.  But we were resurrected, as is the phoenix from the ashes of what once was, and given purpose: to destroy the enemy that had plagued us in the previous life.  It seems the Ironborn may have been right:  *What is dead, may never die*.

Good:

\- Booked 6 weeks before stay. Total Cost for Two Nights was $477.92; I used 2,500 UR points with with Points Boost, and was charged $427.92, which was immediately credited using one $250 Edit credit and balance of my $300 annual travel credit.

\- Received two vouchers for breakfast at Il Solito, the hotel restaurant, which was up to $30 per person, enough for an entree and coffee/drink.  Voucher does not cover tips.

\- Chase Travel had covered hotel amenity fee.

\- Informed of $100 credit upon checkin.

\- Thanks to CSR, I had IHG Platinum status, which meant I received an additional $10 per night for food beverage. (So $120 total credits.)

\- There was some confusion at the front desk about whether I would receive point for the stay, but 2 days after the stay, my received 5,155 IHG points for the stay and 600 point Platinum Elite bonus.

Bad:

\- No upgrades available; I also showed up at noon and was told no rooms were available yet. I did not try for late checkout, so did not have a chance to try ""guaranteed 4pm check out.""

\- If you spend less than $30 per person at breakfast, you can't use the ""balance"" for tips--they actually broke out the tips for each breakfast on the hotel bill.

\- Il Solito only serves breakfast, so they only other food option is the small bar in the lobby which has great drinks but meager food options.  We ended up spending our $120 in credits on drinks and desserts (and tips for breakfast).

\- Welcome ""amenity"" was a small bottle of sparkling water and two Lindt truffles.

\- IHG would not let me add my member number until check-in at the front desk.  


Overall, I think the Edit experience went smoothly and we would definitely repeat.  Looking forward to using our Edit credits again at a future Kimpton, which will hopefully have better food options.",9,1767670905.0,ChaseSapphire,7,1.0,False

3) El Panadero Bakery on W 179th - tres leches cake. 10/10 this was really nice, moist and light, had much hilarity ordering because we didn’t speak Spanish and they couldn’t understand our British translation of tres leches. Eventually someone stepped in to translate. Very funny.

Here's why","For years, I had a low-grade anxiety that never left. It wasn't full-on panic attacks or anything, but more like a constant buzzing stress that made everything feel harder than it needed to be. Shoulders were always tense, I slept like shit, and I'd replay the tiniest interactions in my head for literal days.

I tried ashwagandha first (both regular and KSM-66) because everyone on here raves about it. It helped a bit with the physical stuff, but my brain was still going a million miles an hour esp before bedtime. Then someone posted here about L-theanine and how it targets the mental side more than the physical.

So I started taking them together and it really helped. I use to think of them as separate supplements when in reality they're like 2 pieces of a puzzle. It's like they each cover a different part of the anxiety thing. Ashwagandha helps my body chill out (less chest tightness, easier breathing), and L-theanine turns down the volume on all the thoughts that won't shut up.

THIS IS NOT A MIRACLE CURE and I'm not saying that I'm never anxious anymore. But it's the difference between white-knuckling my way through the day vs actually feeling like a person. I can drink coffee again without getting jittery, I can have a weird conversation and not dissect it for hours, and my whole baseline feels quieter.

The weirdest part is noticing when I forget to take them for a few days. That buzz comes right back and I'm like ""oh yeah, this is what I used to deal with 24/7.""

If you tried one or the other and it didn't really work, maybe try combining them both. Bodies are weird and complicated, sometimes you need more than one thing.

Daily dose: Ashwagandha 600mg and L-Theanine: 160mg. Feel free to mess around with the dose but this is what I find worked well for me. Best before coffee or bed in my experience.

Has anyone else had better luck combining these instead of just taking one? How many mg worked for you?

You'll be working on your own vision board, but in a room full of people doing the same thing. We'll have dedicated time for both creating and connecting, meaning you're not just leaving with goals, you're leaving with new friends who share your values.

This is perfect if you:

* Want to meet people in a meaningful (not awkward) way
* Enjoy creative, collaborative activities
* Are looking for community around personal growth and intentional living
* Prefer small group settings to loud bars or rushed coffee chats

What makes this different from solo goal-setting: the energy of a group, shared inspiration, and the accountability that comes from planning your year alongside others who actually get it.

Whether you're a student finding your footing or young professional in the midst of their career, everyone's welcome. Grab a friend or come solo to meet people (that's what this is for!).

""Lena, I miss you,"" softly, like it had always lived in his mouth.

I leaned closer, my heart pounding loud enough that I was sure he could hear it through the door.

When I pushed the door open, he didn't try to hide it.

He just looked at me, like he was cataloging damage.

I folded my arms defensively, the movement automatic. ""Start talking, Daniel.""

""I didn't think it would go this far,"" he said.

""She's... younger,"" he continued. ""We met through work. It wasn't planned. It wasn't supposed to be anything.""

""How long?"" I pressed.

""A few months."" His jaw clenched. ""And... she's pregnant. Found out three weeks ago.""

The word hit harder than I expected, stealing my breath.

Three weeks-- Three weeks of him kept coming home, ki-ssing me, sleeping in our bed, all while hiding this.

My heart was shattered, but beneath the pain, a resolve took root.

I wouldn't beg for him to choose me.

The Sound That Didn't Belong

The house was settling into itself the way it always did after ten. Pipes ticking. The low hum of the refrigerator. The faint whir of the baby monitor, though our daughter had been asleep for hours and no sound had come through since her last restless sigh.

I rinsed a mug at the sink and watched the water spiral down the drain. The kitchen light was too bright, the rest of the house too dim. I told myself I'd turn everything off in a minute. I told myself I deserved one quiet moment before sleep claimed what was left of the day.

Daniel's office door was half closed at the end of the hall. A thin line of light cut across the carpet like a warning I didn't recognize yet. He'd said he needed to finish something for work. He'd ki-ssed my temple without looking at me. Routine. Familiar. Harmless.

I dried my hands on a towel that had seen better days and padded down the hall in bare feet. I meant to ask if he wanted tea. I meant to tell him I'd set out his lunch for the morning. I meant nothing dramatic at all.

That was the thing. Nothing ever announces itself when it arrives to ruin you.

His voice reached me before I reached the door. Low. Soft. Smiling. The voice he used when he didn't feel the need to perform. The one reserved for late nights and shared jokes and the safety of being known.

I slowed without realizing it. Stopped just short of the doorframe.

He wasn't talking loudly. He wasn't careless. He wasn't drunk or angry or distracted. He sounded calm. Intimate. At ease.

Then he said her name.

Not fast. Not under his breath. He said it the way you say something you love. The way you say something that belongs to you.

Her name slid into the space between his breaths and settled there, natural as air.

I didn't catch them in bed.

I didn't find messages or lipstick stains.

I didn't need proof that could be argued away.

What I heard was worse.

Daniel. My husband. Whispering another woman's name like it had always lived in his mouth.

The hallway seemed to tilt. Not violently. Just enough to make me grab the wall with my fingertips. The paint felt cool. Solid. Real. Everything else wavered.

I waited for my brain to correct the moment. For context to appear. For a reasonable explanation to step forward and save us both.

It didn't.

He laughed softly at something she said. A sound I hadn't heard in a while. A sound I used to think belonged to me.

I leaned closer, my heart pounding loud enough that I was sure he could hear it through the door.

""I miss you,"" he said.

Three words. Gentle. Unforced.

I don't remember breathing after that.

My first instinct was to open the door. To demand answers. To say his name the way he had said hers and force him to look at me. I could already picture it. His startled face. The scramble for excuses. The way he would reach for me out of habit, as if touch could undo what had already been done.

I didn't do it.

Something inside me went very still.

I listened instead. Every nerve awake. Every sense sharpened to a painful clarity.

He wasn't begging. He wasn't apologizing. He wasn't explaining himself to someone who needed convincing. He was present. Comfortable. Exactly where he wanted to be.

""I know,"" he murmured. ""Soon.""

Soon.

The word echoed in my head like a countdown.

I stepped back before my knees gave out. Moved on instinct, not thought. The carpet muffled my steps as I retreated down the hall, the light from his office narrowing until it disappeared completely.

The kitchen felt different when I returned. Smaller. Like it had shrunk while I was gone. I sank into a chair and pressed my palms flat against the table. The wood was scarred with years of living. A dent from when our daughter had thrown a spoon during a tantrum. A burn mark from the time Daniel forgot to use a coaster.

Our life was everywhere. Etched into the mundane.

For years, Daniel had been my constant. The man who remembered to lock the doors at night. The man who rubbed my back when I couldn't sleep. The man who held our daughter like she was proof that he was capable of goodness, even on his worst days.

I had built my future around him without hesitation. Every plan had his name woven into it. Every imagined tomorrow assumed his presence the way you assume the sun will rise.

I had trusted that completely.

The realization didn't arrive with fireworks or tears. It arrived quietly, like the sound of something breaking far away. The kind you don't notice until the damage is already done.

If he could say her name like that, then this hadn't started tonight. It hadn't started last week or even last month. This was a story already in motion, one I had never been invited to read.

I stood and turned off the kitchen light. The darkness felt heavy, pressing in from all sides. I moved through the living room, past framed photos and half finished projects and the soft glow of a nightlight near the stairs.

Our daughter's door was ajar. I paused, listening. Her breathing was slow and even. I watched her chest rise and fall, memorizing the rhythm the way I had when she was a newborn and I was afraid sleep would steal her away.

I smoothed her hair back gently. She stirred but didn't wake.

""I've got you,"" I whispered, though I wasn't sure who I was promising.

Back in the bedroom, I closed the door and sat on the edge of the bed. Daniel's pillow still held the faint scent of his cologne. Familiar. Comforting. It turned my stomach.

I thought about the life we had built. The arguments we'd survived. The years that had hardened us in some places and softened us in others. I thought about how easily I had believed that longevity meant loyalty.

I didn't cry.

Shock does strange things to you. It narrows your world down to what can be managed in the moment. Breathing. Standing. Keeping your hands from shaking.

I lay back and stared at the ceiling. The fan hummed overhead, steady and indifferent. Time passed. Minutes or hours. I couldn't tell.

Eventually, I heard his footsteps in the hall. The soft click of the office door closing. The familiar cadence of his walk as he headed toward our bedroom.

I closed my eyes before he could see them open.

The mattress dipped as he climbed into bed beside me. He moved carefully, as if afraid of waking me. His hand brushed my arm, warm and gentle.

I felt nothing.

He exhaled and turned onto his side. Within minutes, his breathing evened out, deep and untroubled.

Sleep came for him easily.

It did not come for me.

I lay there, listening to the man I thought I knew breathe in the dark, replaying his voice in my head. The way he had said her name. The way it had sounded like home.

That was when I understood.

Not with panic. Not with grief. With a calm so sharp it cut.

My life, as I knew it, might already be over.

And there was nothing left to do tonight but listen to the silence and let it settle.

Morning Like Any Other

Morning arrived the same way it always did. Too early. Too loud. Too ordinary.

The blender screamed from the kitchen while the coffee maker gurgled like it was fighting for its life. Sunlight spilled across the counter in soft gold stripes, catching on the crumbs we never quite managed to wipe away. A Tuesday. Or maybe Wednesday. The kind of morning that didn't deserve to be remembered.

""Mommy,"" my daughter called from the table, her voice thick with sleep. ""I want the cereal with the strawberries. Not the boring one.""

I smiled automatically. Muscle memory. ""The strawberries one makes your milk pink. You complained last time.""

She shrugged, already bored of the conversation. ""I like pink now.""

Of course you do.

I reached into the cabinet and pulled the box down, my movements precise, practiced. Everything in this house ran on routines. We were very good at routines.

Daniel stood at the stove, flipping an omelet like it was a competitive sport. He wore the gray T-shirt I liked. The one that hugged his shoulders just enough to make me think thoughts I probably shouldn't have been thinking before eight in the morning.

He looked up and smiled at me. Easy. Familiar.

""Morning,"" he said.

""Morning,"" I replied.

The word tasted strange in my mouth.

He moved with confidence, sliding eggs onto a plate, setting toast beside it. He poured orange juice without spilling a drop. He ki-ssed our daughter's head as he passed her plate, ruffling her hair like this was the highlight of his day.

She giggled. ""Daddy, stop. You're messing it up.""

He laughed. The sound was warm. Convincing.

I watched him from across the kitchen and felt something inside me shift. Not a break. More like a click. Like a lock finally turning after years of forcing the wrong key.

This was not new.

That truth landed quietly, but it landed hard.

Daniel sat down across from me and started eating, scrolling through his phone with his free hand. Work emails. Sports updates. Normal things. He nodded at something on the screen and hummed under his breath.

I noticed how steady he was. How controlled. How nothing about him suggested guilt or panic or fear. No hesitation. No cracks.

He had slept well.

I had not slept at all.

""You're quiet,"" he said casually, glancing up. ""Everything okay?""

There it was. The moment. The opening.

I could have said something. Anything. I could have asked why he was up so late last night. Who he was talking to. Why he'd shut his office door when he never used to. Why his voice had sounded like that when he said her name.

I didn't.

""Just tired,"" I said instead. ""Didn't sleep great.""

He reached across the table and squeezed my hand. Warm. Familiar. Intimate. ""You should try that lavender spray again. It helped last time.""

Last time.

I nodded and pulled my hand back to pick up my coffee, pretending I needed both hands for the mug.

Our daughter kicked her feet under the table. ""Mommy, Daddy said we might go to the park after school today.""

Daniel shot me a look. ""If the weather holds.""

She beamed. ""Can we?""

""Sure,"" I said, because that was the answer I always gave. Sure. Yes. Of course. Whatever makes the moment easier.

Daniel smiled again, satisfied. He finished his breakfast, stood, and carried his plate to the sink. He rinsed it and set it in the dishwasher like a man who had done this a thousand times before.

Which he had.

Nothing about him was rushed. Nothing was off. If I hadn't heard what I'd heard last night, I would have missed it entirely.

That was the scariest part.

After breakfast, he tied his shoes by the door while our daughter hunted for her backpack. I leaned against the counter and watched him move through the house like he belonged there. Like he hadn't already stepped outside of it in ways I was only just beginning to understand.

""You're picking her up today, right?"" he asked.

""Yes.""

""And dinner. I'll probably be late. Meetings ran long yesterday, so today's packed.""

Meetings.

""Okay,"" I said.

He straightened and crossed the room, pressing a quick ki-ss to my cheek. Not rushed. Not distracted. Perfectly placed. ""Love you.""

I felt the words hit my skin and slide off.

""Love you,"" I said back.

The door closed behind him with a soft click.

Our daughter looked up at me. ""Daddy forgot his lunch.""

I stared at the bag on the counter. Brown paper. His name written in my handwriting.

""I'll bring it to him later,"" I said.

She shrugged, already moving on to something else.

The house felt different once he was gone. Not empty. Just quieter in a way that made everything echo.

I cleaned the table, wiped the counters, moved through the motions like I always did. I walked our daughter to the door, fixed her jacket, tied her shoes again because she never quite got the knots right.

When she left, the silence rushed in.

I stood in the middle of the kitchen and let it settle.

For the first time in years, I replayed moments that had never made sense before. Late nights. Sudden privacy. The way he angled his phone away from me on the couch. How his patience had thinned without explanation. How intimacy had become something scheduled instead of spontaneous.

I had told myself it was stress. Work. Parenthood. Life.

It always is.

But people do not wake up one morning and betray you. They practice first. In small ways. Quiet ways. Ways that train them to lie without flinching.

Daniel had been steady because he had been preparing for this longer than I had been aware.

That thought made my chest ache.

I poured another cup of coffee and leaned against the counter, staring at nothing. I should cry. Should feel something dramatic. Anger. Grief. Rage.

Instead, I felt alert.

Like a part of me that had been sleeping had finally opened its eyes.

I grabbed my purse and the forgotten lunch and locked the door behind me. The drive to his office passed in a blur. Red lights. Pedestrians. Music playing softly on the radio.

When I pulled into the parking lot, I spotted his car immediately. Parked in the same spot as always. Predictable.

I sat there longer than necessary, watching people come and go. Watching the building swallow them whole.

I wondered who she was. If she worked with him. If she laughed at his jokes the way I used to. If she knew about me. About our daughter. About the life he slipped in and out of so easily.

I shook my head and grabbed the lunch bag.

The receptionist smiled when I walked in. ""Dropping something off?""

""Yes,"" I said. ""For Daniel.""

She nodded like this was normal. Because it was.

I left the bag on his desk without knocking. His office was empty. Chair pushed in. Computer locked. Everything in its place.

I looked around, searching for signs. A photo. A note. Anything.

Nothing.

He was good. I would give him that.

I turned and left before I could second-guess myself.

The rest of the day unfolded the way days always do. Errands. Emails. School pickup. Snacks. Homework questions I had to Google because apparently math had changed since I was a kid.

Daniel texted me in the afternoon.

Running late. Sorry.

I stared at the message until the screen dimmed.

Okay, I typed back.

He sent a heart emoji.

I didn't respond.

Dinner was quiet. Our daughter chattered about her day while I nodded and smiled at the right moments. I tucked her into bed and read her favorite story, doing all the voices like she liked.

""Mommy,"" she said sleepily. ""Are you mad at Daddy?""

My heart stuttered. ""Why would you think that?""

She shrugged. ""You look different.""

Kids notice everything.

""I'm not mad,"" I said carefully. ""Just tired.""

She accepted that easily, already drifting off.

I turned off the light and stood in the doorway longer than necessary, watching her sleep.

When Daniel finally came home, the house was dark. He moved quietly, careful not to wake anyone. He found me on the couch, pretending to read.

He sat beside me and leaned in, his arm draping over my shoulders like it always had.

""You okay?"" he asked softly.

I looked at him then. Really looked.

This man knew how to play his part.

""I'm fine,"" I said.

He smiled, relieved, and pressed a ki-ss to my temple.

I didn't move.

As he stood and headed toward the bedroom, I stayed where I was, staring at the blank television screen.

This wasn't sudden.

It never is.

And as the house settled around me once again, I understood something with startling clarity.

I was done being the last to know.

My twins get home from school super needy and cranky. If my toddler skips nap or barely sleeps due to having to go pick up the twins from school, he is also super cranky. The sunlight is weird. My coffee has long worn off. The kids are fighting and whining. “Let’s go to the park!” I say. One doesn’t want to go to the park at all, one suddenly “hates that park,” one won’t put his shoes on. We decide to go for a walk. One wants to ride his bike but NOT if the 2yo also rides his bc he’s “too slow.” *Cue whining meltdown.* 

It makes me understand why people put their kids in tons of after school activities. On Tuesdays the twins do a parkour class and it’s a lovely way to break up and structure the afternoon. The other days I feel like I’m just pulling my hair out lol. 

Don’t get me wrong I LOVE those little peanuts and I also love the morning hours with my toddler, so much. And I like dinner and bedtime even though it’s chaotic because my husband is home and *actually* helps.

We have so much in common and she is so cute and sweet. We both love art, animals, drawing and more. We have our differences, of course; She loves rollercoasters but in scared of them, I love bugs and spiders but she's scared of them (she told me I'll have to get them out of the house which HAD ME KICKING MY FEET‼️), I love spicy food and coffee and she cant stand spice or even the smell of coffee. Even with those differences I'm absolutely smitten for her. I think about her all the time and all i want to do is buy her stuffed animals and snacks and talk to her. 

I'm a bit of a dog type of person. Im very playful and a bit stupid and overly exciteable. She's totally a black cat type and just sits and smiles at me when i do silly shit and laughs at my little mistakes I make when talking or texting. She's a lot smaller than me (I'm 5'4 and athletic while she's 5'1 and very sleek), which just makes me want to pick her up and put her in my pocket so i can carry her around everywhere.

We follow each other on Instagram so when something she's liked comes up on my feed it lets me know. She's liked things saying ""does she think of me as much as i think of her"" etc etc and I just want to text YES YES OH MY GODS I CANT STOP THINKING ABOUT YOU AND HOW GORGEOUS YOU ARE.

Because we have a special needs child together, I was a SAHM for the most part of our early marriage. 4 years ago I started to transition back into the workforce, and 2 years ago I got a job working for a Federal government agency. 

My husband has been working in manufacturing industry and has been working night shifts. Basic rate per hour, I outearn my husband but not a lot. However with the night shift loading added we are on par with how much we earn. He uses this as ammunition for when I ask for him to give me money for say example to get my nails done. He would say along the lines of, Why should I give you money when you earn more than me?

18 months ago, we remotgage our home. It was initially in his name only because I still had a temporary residence status and that would mean we would pay a higher tax rate. So when I got my citizenship, a stable job and fixed income, we remotgaged our house and take money out to be able to buy his dream car and a little extra so we can pay and close all our small personal loans on the side. So we only have this one big debt to both our names. 

We initially agreed on putting $1,000 per week into our joint account to cover all household expenses. Which is a very good arrangement at face value. We don't have to worry about bills. Because with the pooled resources we are able to pay all our bills on time and have enough money that weekly groceries is not an issue. Our child can eat us out of the house. 

My husband recently had a pay adjustment at work and he is now effectively being paid $150 more per week than I do. So after the $1000 he out on our joint account, he still has about $350 extra for himself from his wages. However, my husband also has some side hustles that bring in an extra $300 - $500 per week. 

Both my husband and I have separate bank account where our income gets deposited. Because of my husband's money from the income he gets to keep and money from side hustles, his savings are ballooning. He has recently bought an expensive mod to his car, a new boat, some tools, fishing gears, camping gears, and has been excitedly showing me his next mod plan and how it's going to cost him $30,000. 

I don't want to be the rain on his parade but I'm miserable working full time. Our current arrangement of 50/50 to the household leaves me with barely enough funds to buy coffee or lunch or dining out with friends on a random weekend so I can decompress and destress. 

I want to drop my contribution to only $750 per week, and I would need him to cover the missing $250 which effectively makes almost all of his employment income go into our household account. My husband thinks that it is unfair because he has worked so hard for so long covering our expenses when I wasn't working and just when he has a chance to be able to save and spend for himself for the things he wants, I am now cutting that avenue off. 

He works at nights so he can take the mornings as side hustle time, and sleep in the afternoon and wake up in the evening to get ready for his main job.

AITA for wanting to go back on our arrangement? I'm really conflicted.

We may be a world apart, but we're here together!*

**Welcome to the 24 hour pledge!**

I'm pledging myself to not drinking today, and invite you to do the same.

Maybe you're new to /r/stopdrinking and have a hard time deciding what to do next. Maybe you're like me and feel you need a daily commitment or maybe you've been sober for a long time and want to inspire others.

It doesn't matter if you're still hung over from a three day bender or been sober for years, if you just woke up or have already completed a sober day. For the next 24 hours, lets not drink alcohol!

\---

**This pledge is a statement of intent.**  Today we don't set out *trying* not to drink, we make a conscious decision *not to drink*. It sounds simple, but all of us know it can be hard and sometimes impossible. The group can support and inspire us, yet only one person can decide if we drink today. Give that person the right mindset!

What happens if we can't keep to our pledge? We give up or try again. And since we're here in /r/stopdrinking, we're not ready to give up.

**What this is:**  A simple thread where we commit to not drinking alcohol for the next 24 hours, posting to show others that they're not alone and making a pledge to ourselves. Anybody can join and participate at any time, you do not have to be a regular at /r/stopdrinking or have followed the pledges from the beginning.

**What this isn't:**  A good place for a detailed introduction of yourself, directly seek advice or share lengthy stories. You'll get a more personal response in your own thread.

**Happy Tuesday!** 

Let’s talk about our Tools today.

DCI is my main one as mentioned yesterday.  I start the day with a check in and a pledge to not drink.  This is my “something small” that makes a big difference.  

I also really enjoy quit lit and podcasts, going for a walk, working out, and remembering my why.  My why is making the most out of the rest of the time I have, it’s enjoying life and being totally present.  I experience things so much more vividly when I am “here” and not in that fuzzy state.  

\*\*Clarity\*\* 

I went SO many years just drifting through life, always planning my next drink. It makes me feel regret when I think of all that time wasted because it really is a blur. 

I also use a 5 minute journal in the morning and evening.  It helps me to identify what I’m grateful for and remember that I’m pretty blessed.  It’s the little things like waking up and enjoying a cup of coffee. Not having a headache. Etc. 

What are some of your tools?

Would you be open to sharing your why?

I hope you had an absolutely fantastic holiday, got plenty of rest, spent quality time with loved ones, and ate yummy foods! As we gear up to start the new year strong so we have big momentum to carry us through, Naomi comes with some gifts to help you out!

(Don't listen to her she totally read your satisfaction survey responses and picked some gifts that would add what y'all said you were missing.)

## Events 

Wow we have new events! Okay so:

- Curriculum night is coming back next week! We will pick up right where we left off. https://discord.com/events/692816967895220344/1435356668442448033
- Our weekend mentorship call will also be returning next week! I know y'all really liked this one. https://discord.com/events/692816967895220344/1433548029666918460

Roles for these two are available in the Discord onboarding! Grab them so you don't miss out!

BUUUUUUUUT BRINGING YOU THE SAME EVENTS WE ALREADY HAD IS NOT MUCH OF A GIFT, SO **HOW ABOUT SOME NEW ONES???????**

- Many of you wanted networking opportunities. So let's try something new! We will be doing a coffee chat Sundays! This will be a quick ice breaker as a group, and then I'll break you off into pairs randomly for a 15 minute chat! We'll rotate a couple of times, you'll meet new peeps, and it'll be great! https://discord.com/events/692816967895220344/1455617874847600792
- Next, lots of y'all wanted more opportunities to contribute, or more help contributing. I will absolutely keep running my big contribution sprints, so go get that role. But if you wanna work on a `help wanted` issue outside of my sprints... I have just the event for you! I'm maintaining a weekly office hour where you can pop in and get help contributing if you need it! https://discord.com/events/692816967895220344/1455617298999152640
- Finally, some of you said that you wished for better ways to provide feedback. I saw quite a few folks ask for a town hall style dealio. So here it is! Once a month, I'll do a big event where you can share your community feedback, ideas, thoughts, feelings, etc! https://discord.com/events/692816967895220344/1455618278612406373

Kay so the roles for these three events are not in onboarding yet cause Naomi in hospital and mobile discord does not have onboarding settings. If you want one or more of the roles for these, ping me in Discord and I'll hook you up.

## Okay Naomi events are cool but come on it's a new year can't we do more????

YES WE CAN! **I SAVED THE BEST GIFT FOR LAST**!

You might remember that ""Hackathon"" we ran last year, where I put people on teams and gave them four weeks to build a production grade project. It was our first time doing it, so there were lots of weird operational issues and Naomi mismanaged so many things. But this time she (thinks she) is more prepared.

SO WE GONNA DO IT AGAIN! This event takes place in Discord so if you aren't there you should be!

Now, here's the dealio. I got another application thingy, this time we calling it a cohort cause that seems to fit better it is not quite a Hackathon.

ANYWAY we'll be running this in February so apply now if you want in! I'll close apps on the 15th.

SUPER DUPER EXCITING I CANT WAIT TO SEE YALL APPLY! Here's the linky link: https://forms.nhcarrigan.com/o/docs/forms/noxhF9r7C66ER2KfVcD2ps/4

Kay I hope you like the presents! If you have any questions please let me know I am always happy to answer questions!

But might be out for a couple of days dunno yet so replies may be a wee bit slow.

After a bit of back and forth, we decided to go on a date. We met for coffee, and everything felt easy—no awkward silences, no pressure. The conversation flowed naturally, we laughed, and we talked openly about our lives.

After that, we went to watch a movie. We were comfortable with each other—holding hands, she leaned her head on my shoulder, and I kissed her forehead. It was honestly one of the best first dates I’d had in a long time. It felt simple, warm, and genuine. On the way back, we kept talking, and before saying goodbye for the night, we hugged.

When I got home, we chatted about the date, and both of us felt the same way—it had gone really well. Everything seemed positive. A few days later, she had to travel outside the valley for work, but after that, she suddenly disappeared.

I was confused and tried to communicate, but eventually I realised I had been blocked. After a few attempts, I stopped reaching out and blamed it on bad luck.

Still, the time we spent together stayed with me—I couldn’t quite forget it. So I tried one last time to contact her. She responded and told me that she hadn’t fully moved on from her previous relationship. Even though they were no longer in contact, being with me brought back flashbacks of her past, and she wasn’t emotionally ready.

Although I suggested that we could stay in touch and take things slowly, she still hesitated and eventually stopped responding.

I think part of me wanted to help her move on—to simply spend good time together, without pressure, and see where things might naturally lead. If it felt right, I would’ve been happy to build something slowly.

I haven’t contacted her since that last conversation, which happened months ago, but I still find myself wondering why—especially when everything felt so good in the moment. Was it just bad luck and timing, or am I overthinking this situation?",5,1767669649.0,NepalSocial,8,1.0,False

1q57bq6,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1q57bq6,Why is my coffee bitter? [Breville Barista Express],"I’ve had my machine for about 6 months, and recently swapped to the ‘single wall’ double shot after previously using the double wall exclusively. I’m not gonna claim I was pulling professional level shots before, but they were consistently palatable.

I’ve pulled good shots since I ran my last cafiza. Fresh water in the tank. Running a ‘rinse’ blank before each shot, and a rinse after. The group screen is clean. 

I am using the same espresso roast - lavazza. I did not change my grind size. Using 18g like always, and gets to about 6-8 seconds before it starts coming through portafilter. Ending at \~20 seconds with 34g (Was slow stopping the timer). Getting up to or just below center of ‘grey pressure zone’. Puck comes out solid.

Zero crema. Comes out even on both sides, but super black. Very bitter. A liquid punch in the mouth.

Anyone else find the breville single wall double to be oversized and tamper bottoms out since filter basket walls aren’t straight? Or is the grind too fine? Was hoping I could swap up to the single wall from the pre-k double wall.

I (27M) work as a history teacher, and this year we hired a new Behavior Tech (23F). At first, things were going normally, but as she and I started talking and getting to know each other more, it seemed like there might have been something there. We shared a similar sense of humor and joked around with each other so much. It was honestly the first time I felt like I could be genuinely myself with someone. One incident that stands out to me is when she complimented my jacket. It was a red raincoat, and she had said it would be better in blue, to which I replied that red was the better color. This turned into a week of us dressing in our respective colors and even drawing pictures to hide for one another to find. To me, this felt like something else. The next week, I was at a bookstore, and I saw a crochet kit. I knew she liked to crochet, so I bought it and gave it to her the next day. I was really worried about how it would look on my end, but she was super excited and started working on it right away, always coming by to show me the progress. Finally, after a week, I asked her to go to lunch on black friday. She agreed and gave me her number so we could set something up. We did meet, but only for coffee, as she wasn't hungry, and honestly, neither was I. We spent about two hours chatting and playing cards before she asked me why I had asked her to hang out. I told her upfront about my feelings and how I wanted to see if it might work out. She told me there that she didn't date her coworkers. Which is fine by me. However, she continued talking and ended with ""I like you too"". This left me somewhat confused, and I wasn't sure where to go with the information. A little over two weeks have passed, and we are still texting briefly. One day, I told her I was going to watch one of the movies she recommended to me, and she told me to pause the movie so she could watch it with me virtually. We watched the movie together, and then she FaceTimed me for 2.5 hours. The next night, she and I were texting again, but this time it got deeper. We discussed the things that were bothering us, and I finally asked her what she meant when she said she ""liked me too"". She then told me that there was something between us, but she was scared of relationships. She told me that once we were no longer coworkers, it would be different. This was all fine to me, though it still felt a little vague. The next night, a student had a play, so she and I went to it, but sat separately. After the play, we went and got dinner, and when we were about to part ways, she asked for a hug. For me, I was pretty hyped after this; I'm not going to lie. It was probably one of the best car rides home I had had in a while. On Saturday, we texted somewhat sporadically, as she isn't very good at texting. However, later that night, she Facetimed me again and asked for my address. She came over and picked me up, and we had a great time. We went to the lake, got pizza, and had a great time. I joked that next time I would randomly show up at her place, and she said, ""My place is a girl's household, so probably not,"" and this matters later. However, I was confused, the hug and now the random appearance at my house didn't feel like things coworkers did. So, once again, we had a conversation about what was going on. She said that she was just a flirty person and had a wandering eye. She told me that everything I said was right, but she didn't feel anything because of her meds. This left me even more confused because her words seemed to say one thing, but her actions suggested something else. We barely talked the next day. Then from Monday to Thursday I was left on delivered. I didn't double-text or anything purely because I didn't want to look desperate, but it did bother me a bit. At school, though, she was still messing with me and going out of her way to be in my room. She came across the school just to borrow some Lysol wipes. During this time, I learned new terms such as ""anxious attachment"" and ""avoidant attachment"". Now I'm a teacher, not a doctor, but from what I was gathering through the psychologists on Instagram (I know, not a great source) and my research online, it felt that I fell under the anxious attachment and her the avoidant. That Friday was the last day of school, and she was heading home for the holidays. I expected not to hear from her for the next weeks. Instead, she texted and Facetimed me often. We spoke to each other every day through text or FaceTime. Sometimes she'd just send a picture of herself or FaceTime me to show me her hair or her outfit for the day. So again, I was just confused and surprised. I loved it though. She made me so happy, and I enjoyed spending time with her. One day, she was really down on herself, and I gave her kind words and reassured her that she was not alone. She responded with ""I am glad you are in my life,"" and my heart melted a little bit. I told her the same thing. New Year's came around and stayed up just to spend the New Year's with me, even though she was in a different time zone. She told me that she really enjoyed talking to me. When she came home, her roommate couldn't pick her up, so I stayed up till 1 am to pick her up from the airport and drop her off. This was kind of big for me because she said that I'd never come over to her place. I also had gotten her a Christmas gift, but because she left early, I wasn't able to give it to her before break, so I brought it with me to pick her up. I knew she liked to paint, so I got her a bunch of paints, small canvases, and easels. The next day, she opened the gift and told me I was the sweetest person ever. We talked for a bit and I mentioned one of my favorite horror movies and how it would be cool to watch it virtually with her. She then asked me if I'd want to come over and watch it with her. To be clear (and I'm sorry because I know this is a lot of stuff you're reading, but I feel it all matters) I had no intentions of sleeping with her. Yes, I was attracted to her physically, but I was more invested in the time we spent together emotionally, if that makes sense. So, I did go over; we watched the movie and spent about three hours just chilling. Nothing happened between us besides some long stares and smiles. As I left, she asked how I was feeling, and I told her that I really liked her and that I was sorry to keep bringing it up, but I felt I needed to communicate with her and wanted to improve our communication. She said it was okay for me to feel that way and that it was all right. The next day, she said that I had misinterpreted our friendship and that we wanted different things. That was yesterday; as I write this, I'm still crying. I guess I am confused. Did I read too much into it? Is she just being avoidant? Have I been discarded? I see a lot of information on the internet about avoidants and discarding, but I'm unsure if I fall into that category or not. I just hope someone can help guide me a bit here and tell me what might be going on. I just need some help because I am lost and in so much pain. Thank you for reading this far.

“You can start by putting the money in fucking bag Rac bitch!”

Kas was struck by the butt of the shotgun the robber had. She fell to the floor hard, her nose bleeding. 

A panic scream came from the snack section as a small Mosulin girl dropped everything she was holding to stack the shelves. 

The robber, a tall angler fish-like alien with dark black scales, rows of thin sharp teeth and milky white eyes, looked at the sacred mosulin girl and barked orders to her.

“Get over here and get on the ground!” He pointed the shotgun at her.

Panic, the mouslin obeyed his orders. He then focused back on the Rac manager and shouted at her once more to open the register and hand over the money. 

A sound of someone grabbing things off the shelf came next to the fish man and he groaned with annoyance. 

“Bilg, stop looting the snacks and go grab the safe from the back!” 

A skinny eel-like alien stopped what it was doing and hissed. 

“Im hungry boss, plus free Gong bars always taste best when stolen.”

“If it were not for the fact that you are my brother I would shoot you here and now. Now go get the safe in the back you idiot!” 

Kas turn to look at the Mouslin girl. 

“Jenny, you put a fresh coffee on when I asked you to?” kas asked holding her bleeding nose.

“Y-yes w-why?” Jenny squeaked.

“Good, the humans will be needed soon.” kas smiled.

The angler fish alien looked down at Kas and saw her smile.

“Why are smiling fur ball?” He would press the barrel of the shotgun to her chest.

“You are robbing a store protected by blitz security. The humans are on their way right now or just outside.”

The fish man's blood dropped cold. And the eel alien stopped what he was doing and looked at his boss.

“B-b-boss, we're robbing a human protected store! We gotta go now!”

Kas just laughed, “It's too late, friend.”

I’ve been obsessing over simple binary choices lately (Coffee vs. Tea, Dark Mode vs. Light Mode, etc.).

I had a hypothesis: Can an algorithm predict random facts about a person based solely on their answers to these trivial ""This vs. That"" questions?

To test this, I built a service that runs calculations on user choices to see if there are hidden correlations in the data. Basically, I'm trying to see if knowing your preference for ""Pineapple on Pizza"" can actually help a model predict other random demographic facts or habits.

It’s a fun side project/experiment, but I’ve put some work into the backend logic.

I’d love for you guys to try it out and roast the predictions (or the UI).

I shield my eyes from the sun and spot Jack waving like he’s been stranded on an uncharted island for years.
“Why the hell are you on the roof, old man?”
He flips me off and holds up a wrench.
“Found my wrench up here again. Fuckin’ thing moves I swear.”
I shake my head.
“The ladder fell. I've been up here since eleven. Get it standing before I turn into Jack jerky.”
He points to the left side of the garage. I head over.
The ladder looks like someone had four quarters and enough nails to stick a tank to a wall.
“Jesus, Jack. I’m gonna get tetanus just looking at this thing.”
“Oh shut the fuck up before I drop like your balls should’ve.”
I chuckle and lift the ladder like it’s a World War II mine about to go off, setting it against the garage. Jack slides down like he isn’t sixty-five and immediately grabs the bag of donuts.
“Better be jelly, David.”
I nod. He smacks my back. I wince.
“Hey, elder you forgot the wrench.”
He frowns so hard his eyes turn into eyebrows.
“Well shit. You grab it. I’ve been up there for hours because you wanna be fat and grab donuts.”
He sucks jelly off his thumb.
“I’ve got one in my tool bag. I brought it from a late call last night.”
He waves his donut at me. I go to the truck and carry my bag into the garage and we get to work. Mostly he hands me tools and tells me stories about races he won with this carcass.
I ask for my pliers.
He doesn’t hand them over.
“You lose your hearing, old ma—”
I stop. Jack’s face is wrong. His wrinkles don’t fold the way they should.
“David,” he says quietly. “Where did you get this?”
He’s staring at the hook from last night. It shimmers under the light of his garage.
I forgot to show Frankie. The jelly donut distracts all.
“I forgot it was in there. Some spike lodged in a gas line from a late-night call.”
His eyes lock onto it.
“I haven’t seen anything like this since I was your age. I don’t remember how—but I’ve seen this.”
His hands shake. He pulls the pliers apart, lets the hook fall back into my bag, and hands them to me.
I stare at him.
“You tryna kiss me or what, boy?”
I chuckle.
“You’re sick. Get back on your meds.”
We work a while longer until I hit a bolt I can’t loosen with anything I’ve got.
“I can’t get this one, old man. What size is it?”
He studies the engine, then stares at the ceiling.
“It’s not in your bag. It’s on the roof. I stole it last week when you were here.”
I press my palms into my cheeks and groan.
“You klepto. You could’ve just asked.”
He shrugs.
I grab my ladder from the truck and lean it against the garage.
It’s not tall enough.
“Jack, grab my tool bag I need my gloves to climb your damn lad—”
He shoves the bag into my chest. He already has it.
I snatch it back, and push him away,  I pull on my gloves, and plant the ladder. Every step creaks and bends like it’s arguing with my boots.
I look down at him, teeth clenched. He gives me a thumbs-up.
“You’re doing great, boy. Built that thing before your daddy fucked your mom.”
“No shit,” I mutter.
I roll onto the roof like I climbed Everest.
“Grab the wrench before I die of old age!” Jack yells.
I toss it down, then glance toward the mountain again. The sun dips behind it. Something flickers near the base—like fire.
“C’mon, you big pussy,” Jack shouts.
I breathe out and step toward the ladder.
“Oh wait, David don’t step there, it’ll—”
The rung snaps.
I fall through the ladder and slam onto my tool bag. The air rips out of my lungs. My spine cracks. I make a noise like a kid squeezing a rubber chicken too hard.
Jack says something I can’t hear, then laughs like I didn’t fall 20 feet.
I roll off the bag and suck in my first breath.
“Mmmfuck you, old man.”
He laughs harder until a two-by-four smacks him in the head.
I scramble over to him. He’s rubbing his skull, and I laugh at him then points at my waist.
“David… you’re bleeding.”
I look down.
The hook is sticking through my hip, coming from the back it.

1q576e2,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheIronCouncil/comments/1q576e2/the_psychology_of_dark_persuasion_sciencebased/,The Psychology of Dark Persuasion: Science-Based Tricks That Actually Work (Use Wisely),"You've noticed it, right? Some people just seem to have this invisible superpower. They walk into a room, and everyone leans in. They ask for something, and people say yes without thinking twice. They navigate social situations like they're playing chess while everyone else is playing checkers.

Here's what nobody tells you: It's not charisma. It's not luck. It's psychology. And yeah, some of it lives in the grey zone between influence and manipulation. I've spent months digging through research papers, binge-watching behavioural psychology content, and reading everything from Robert Greene to modern cognitive science studies. What do I find? These tactics work. They work really well. But they come with a responsibility label.

The thing is, understanding these mechanisms isn't about becoming a manipulative asshole. It's about recognising when they're being used ON you, and occasionally leveraging them ethically when it matters. Society's already using these tricks on you through advertising, social media algorithms, and political campaigns. You're swimming in psychological manipulation daily. Might as well understand the water you're in.

Step 1: Master the Power of Silence

Most people are terrified of silence. Like, genuinely scared of those awkward pauses in conversation. Here's the trick: Stop filling the void.

When you ask someone a question, and they give you a half-answer, just sit there. Don't nod enthusiastically. Don't jump in with your own story. Just maintain eye contact and wait. The psychological discomfort of silence will literally force them to keep talking and often reveal way more than they intended.

FBI negotiators use this constantly. Chris Voss talks about it in “Never Split the Difference” (the dude literally negotiated with terrorists for a living; this book is insane for understanding human psychology). He calls it ""tactical empathy"", but really, it's weaponised silence. People will confess, elaborate, or backtrack just to escape the tension.

Try it in your next salary negotiation. State your number, then shut up. Whoever speaks first usually loses.

Step 2: The Foot-in-the-Door Technique (Getting People to Say Yes)

This one's backed by solid research, and it's almost stupid how well it works. You want someone to agree to something big? Start by getting them to agree to something tiny first.

Ask your roommate to help you move one box, not the whole apartment. Once they've said yes to the small thing, they're way more likely to help with the bigger task because humans hate cognitive dissonance. We want to see ourselves as consistent. If I helped you with one box, I must be a helpful person, so I'll help with more boxes.

Robert Cialdini breaks this down in **Influence: The Psychology of Persuasion**. Dude's research at Arizona State basically created the blueprint for every marketing campaign you've ever seen. The book reads like a manual for understanding why you bought that thing you didn't need. Fair warning, though, after reading it, you'll see these tactics everywhere, and it's kinda creepy.

This works in dating, sales, friendships, everywhere. Start small. Build momentum.

Step 3: Mirroring (Become Their Psychological Twin)

Your brain is wired to like people who are similar to you. It's tribal instinct stuff. So when someone mirrors your body language, speech patterns, or energy level, your subconscious reads them as ""one of us"" and drops its guard.

Here's how to do it without being obvious: Match their speaking pace. If they talk slowly and thoughtfully, you slow down too. If they're animated and loud, bring your energy up. Subtly mirror their posture after a 2-3 second delay. Cross your legs when they cross theirs. Lean back when they lean back.

The research on this is wild. Studies show that waiters who mirror customers get bigger tips. Negotiators who mirror body language close more deals. It creates this subconscious rapport that words alone can't achieve.

But don't be a robot about it. The keyword is subtle. You're not doing a mime performance.

Step 4: Strategic Vulnerability (The Pratfall Effect)

Here's something that sounds backwards but works like magic: Showing small, controlled weaknesses makes people trust you more.

It's called the Pratfall Effect. Psychologist Elliot Aronson discovered that highly competent people who make small mistakes are actually rated as MORE likeable than those who appear perfect. Your brain sees perfection as threatening or fake. But someone who's mostly got their shit together AND admits they burned dinner or forgot someone's name? That person feels real.

The trick is strategic. You're not trauma dumping or showing major character flaws. You're showing minor, relatable imperfections that humanise you. ""I'm terrible with names"" or ""I always forget to water my plants"" makes you approachable while maintaining competence.

Politicians use this constantly. CEOs do it in interviews. Even your favourite podcaster probably deploys this without thinking about it.

Step 5: Anchoring (Control the Frame of Reality)

Your brain is lazy. When it encounters new information, it grabs onto the first number or piece of data it sees and uses that as a reference point for everything else. This is called anchoring, and once you see it, you can't unsee it.

Want to sell something? Start with a high anchor. ""This usually goes for $500, but I'm offering it for $250."" Even if $250 is the actual value, people will perceive it as a deal because you anchored them at $500.

Salary negotiations? Never give your number first if you can avoid it. But if forced, anchor high. If you want $80k, say $95k. Now $80k feels like a compromise, and they feel like they won.

Daniel Kahneman won a Nobel Prize partly for his work on this stuff. “Thinking, Fast and Slow” is the book, but heads up, it's dense as hell. Worth it though. You'll understand how your brain constantly tricks you into bad decisions.

Step 6: Reciprocity Weaponised
 
Do something for someone, and they'll feel psychologically obligated to return the favour. It's hardwired. Anthropologists think reciprocity is one of the foundations of human civilisation.

But here's the dark part: The favours don't have to be equivalent. You buy someone a coffee, and they feel obligated to help you move. You give someone unsolicited advice, thand they feel like they owe you something.

This is why free samples work. Why sales salespeople bring you water during a pitch? Why cults lovebomb new members with overwhelming kindness. The recipient feels debt.

Use this ethically. Do genuine favours without keeping score. But understand that when someone does you an ""unsolicited favour there might be strings attached.

Step 7: The Illusion of Choice

Give people options, but frame them so all choices lead wheto re you want. Parents do this with kids. ""Do you want to wear the red shirt or the blue shirt?"" The kid feels autonomous, but going shirtless was never an option.

Salespeople do this constantly. ""Would you prefer the premium package or the standard?"" Notice how ""neither"" wasn't offered as a choice.

Frame your requests as choices between two yeses instead of yes or no. ""Should we meet Tuesday or Thursday?"" beats ""Want to meet up?"" The first assumes the meeting will happen and just negotiates details.

Step 8: Scarcity and FOMO (Fear Runs the Show)

Limited time. Only 3 left. Exclusive access. Your brain's threat detection system goes haywire when resources appear scarce. Even if you don't want something, scarcity makes you want it.

Every marketing campaign uses this because it works. But you can use it too. When setting boundaries, make your time or attention appear limited. ""I can only meet for 30 minutes"" makes people value that time more than ""I'm free all day.""

But real talk, if you're using scarcity to manipulate people into bad decisions, you're just being an asshole. Use it to protect your actual limited resources.

Resources for Going Deeper

If this stuff clicks and you want to keep learning, there are some solid resources that'll take you further down the rabbit hole.

BeFreed is an AI-powered learning app built by former Google engineers that turns books, research papers, and expert interviews into personalised content. You type in what you want to learn, like improving negotiation skills or understanding dark psychology, and it pulls from high-quality sources to create custom podcasts for you. 

The depth control is clutch. Start with a 10-minute overview of a book like Influence or Never Split the Difference, and if it hooks you, switch to a 40-minute deep dive with examples and context. You can pick different voices too; some are weirdly addictive, like this smoky tone that makes dense psychology research way easier to absorb during commutes. The app also builds an adaptive learning plan based on your goals, so it's structured instead of random.

Books worth the time: “Never Split the Difference” by Chris Voss is street-level tactical. Influence by Cialdini is the research bible. “Thinking, Fast and Slow” by Kahneman is dense but rewarding. “The 48 Laws of Power” by Robert Greene, if you want the full Machiavelli experience.

These tactics work because they exploit how human psychology actually functions, not how we wish it worked. Silence creates pressure. Small agreements lead to big ones. Mirroring builds unconscious rapport. Strategic vulnerability increases trust. Anchoring controls perception. Reciprocity creates obligation. False choices guide decisions. Scarcity triggers fear responses.

The thing is, knowing this stuff is defensive as much as offensive. You'll start noticing when car salesmen use anchoring on you. When your boss uses scarcity to pressure you. When dating apps use variable rewards to keep you swiping.

Use these wisely. Or don't use them at all. But at least now you know when someone's using them on you.",1,1767669150.0,TheIronCouncil,0,1.0,False

Hey. There is a lot I could say about myself, but the most important thing is that I stay grounded for the people I care about. I live a sort of quiet life, with my writing and drawing, but recently I have found enjoyment in small adventures.

A perfect relationship for me is one where we support each other and still know how to play and tease. If we ever run into bumps, I may take a little time to collect myself, but after I always come back ready to listen. We can spend our time enjoying our hobbies, co-oping games, or going out on calm but fun dates like cafés or arcades. A night just cuddled up on the couch laughing or enjoying each other's presence is perfect to me.

The woman I'm looking for is a passionate one, the type who can go on and on about the things she enjoys. I always find myself falling for the shy and introverted girls with nerdy hobbies and strong values. I’m most drawn to a cute, girl next door type: expressive eyes, a warm smile, and a slim or active build. Not some perfect model, but not just anyone. I fall for someone who is kind to others, is loyal to the ones she loves, and is just as picky as I am on who she lets into her life.

A side note, Final Fantasy is my favorite series (obviously), and I'm aiming to cosplay Cloud in con season. So if you think you can rock a good Tifa, Aerith, or even Yuffie, then you're my type. If you've got other ideas, feel free to say them. Yeah, we'll be the couple that gets others inspired.

1q570j8,https://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromTheCreeps/comments/1q570j8/fractal_indifference/,Fractal Indifference,"Darkness crept over the horizon, erasing the view more and more with each breath. Jack Buchannan took it in, awestruck as always. For three generations the Buchannans had been the keepers of this land. Life times of struggle and strife had built it to what it now was; thirty thousand acres of corn, cotton, and cattle. Every inch blessed by God. Every inch hallowed ground. 

Jack sat on his old Ford tractor and almost shed a joyous tear. Almost.

Down the valley a piece, Something drug his attention away. As the night stretched on, closing in on him, he saw *it*. Whatever it was, it was moving real fast straight towards him. Wolves had been gone from these parts for decades. Coyote? Maybe. Then again, maybe it was some kids from town. Supper was going to have to wait. No one messed with Buchannan land. No one.  

In a few short heartbeats, Jack threw the tractor into motion and drew his pistol from its holster. Behind him, guarded only by three strands of barbed wire, his main herd idled. He had to keep them safe. 

Night now fell like a blanket of uncertainty, eating every bit of clarity he had. Two summers ago, on a night much like this, he had turned the tractor over while trying to move the herd. The headlights had shattered. Town was forty five minutes out of his way and the Ace closed at 7p.m. 

“Damnit,” he thought, not for the first time. He should have replaced the lights.

Up ahead, and closing fast, the shape seemed to grow. What was once a small shape no taller than the cotton it ran in, now seemed to be a hulking *thing,* towering over the reedy plants.

Jack pressed in the clutch, bringing the tractor to a manageable speed. As he slowed down to a stop, he braced himself and aimed. Fear lanced through his mind. 

*What am I looking at?* he thought. The shape kept changing. Small then big. Long now short. Fat, skinny, fast, faster. It made no sense. He shook his head and took a deep breath.

100 yards. He had to wait till it was closer.

75 yards. Sweat seemed to pour from his hands.

50 yards. He thought he could see some jagged mouth where the head should be.

25 yards. He clicked the safety off and squeezed.

**BANG!**

Jack saw stars, then nothing at all.

Back at the top of the hill, eight hundred head of cattle bellowed simultaneously, then wandered off. The old tractor kept drifting forward.

\---

Jack sat up in a rush. His lungs pumped hard, filling him with cold air as fear flooded his veins. It was bright, like looking into the hot sun while working the land.  He blinked rapidly as everything came into focus.

He was… in his bedroom.

*What on earth?*

He grabbed his clock and tugged it towards him. The wire snagged, sending his bible and pocket knife clattering to the floor.

11:43 a.m. That couldn’t be right, there was no way he slept that long. Yet, when he looked out his window, it seemed far too true. The sun was already high enough to bleach the thin curtains pale, yet there were no flies at the window, no cattle lowing in the distance, no wind worrying the cotton. His bedroom smelled wrong, too. Not of dust and oil and old wood, but of something thin and sharp, like rain that never quite fell.

His head was killing him, his joints ached, and his chest felt tight. He stumbled to the bathroom and washed his face. The water was ice cold. When he looked in the mirror, everything was blurry. He rubbed his eyes, but nothing changed. Looking around, everything else was clear.

*I’ve gone and lost my mind.*  
No, not lost it. Misplaced it.

The cows needed to be moved today, and it was surely noon now. He had broken his father’s golden rule. Never sleep in when there is work to do.

Hurriedly, he left the house. At the edge of the yard, where the fence began, he froze. The cows were gathered in strange clusters. Three huddled close to the fence, then a patch of seven farther off, another three nearer still, forming a rhythm he could not make sense of. They never came this close to the house. He took a step forward, then another, squinting at the unusual pattern.

Perplexed but set in his ways, Jack shouted, sending the cows further into the field. They moved reluctantly, glancing back at him in a way that made his stomach twist. All obeyed, eventually, but it felt like forcing a river uphill.

When he reached the barn, he stopped short. The tractor, his old Ford parked just as he had left it last night, was gone. He rubbed his eyes again, heart thudding. Empty space. He had stored it away last night, when…

A low, resonant bellow rolled across the pasture. The sound pressed against his skull, unnatural in rhythm and tone. His headache throbbed, spreading down his neck. The cows bellowed again, a chorus that did not sound right, that made the hairs on the back of his neck stand on end. Jack swallowed hard. Something was very wrong.

The cows had stopped, once again bunching up. Jack tried to count them but couldn’t make sense of it. Every time he started, the numbers slipped from his mind. 

Jack stepped forward, trying again to separate the cows. His boots sank slightly into the soft earth, though it had rained only yesterday. Each step felt heavier than it should. The clusters shifted slightly as he moved, reforming into patterns he could not comprehend. He tried to count them. One, two, three… the numbers vanished from his mind as quickly as he thought them.

The wind whispered across the field, thin and sharp, carrying a sound he could not name. The horizon did not look right. Hills he had crossed a hundred times seemed farther away, stretched unnaturally, as if the land itself had grown taller while he slept. He rubbed his eyes, but the stretch remained.

And then he heard it again. Not the bellowing, but a faint vibration beneath his feet, steady, almost deliberate. Jack froze. The world was watching him now, he was sure of it. In the corner of his vision, a dark shape appeared. When he turned to look, it was gone. Yet again he turned to the cows, but the shape bloomed back in his peripheral vision. 

He tried once more to focus on it, but a wave of nausea rolled through him. His stomach clenched hard. His mouth filled with something thick and bitter. He staggered, bent double, and retched onto the ground.

For a long moment he stayed there, shaking, spitting, trying to clear the taste from his mouth. When he finally straightened, his head was pounding, his legs weak, and the shape was gone.

Only the land remained. Watching.

\---

Jack’s eyes shot open. A surge of anxiety jolted him upright, tangling him in the comforter as he slid off the edge of the bed.

He freed himself with a heavy breath and sat on the mattress. The clock read 6:15 a.m. That seemed right. Out his window, he saw the faint morning light painting the land. A bird sang somewhere nearby. The branches of his favorite oak tree swayed in a breeze. 

He felt… better.

Jack made his way to the bathroom and washed his face. When he looked in the mirror, his own tired face looked back. It was clear and focused.

He let out a sigh and walked lightly to the kitchen. Coffee brewed on the counter, and the warm, familiar smell perked him up a bit more.

Jack carried his mug to the back door and stood there for a moment, letting the warmth soak into his hands and the familiar smells of coffee and old wood and morning air settle him. The pale light through the window had the same quiet promise it always had, the sort that made work feel possible again.

He opened the door.

The breeze he had seen in the oak tree did not reach him. The leaves still moved, whispering softly to one another, but the air against his face was perfectly still, heavy and unmoving in a way that made him pause before stepping forward.

When he stepped onto the porch, the boards did not creak beneath his weight. That should have been impossible. This house sang with every footstep. He shifted, deliberately this time, pressing his heel down, then his toes, but the wood did not answer him. The mug was warm in his hands. The railing was solid beneath his fingers. Only the sound was missing, and the faint, unreasonable certainty that something about that mattered.

“Morning,” he murmured, more out of habit than expectation.

His voice felt swallowed before it finished leaving his mouth. He went down the steps and into the yard, and it was only then that he noticed the grass did not move around his boots. The blades brushed his ankles, cool and sharp, but they did not bend, did not part, did not show any sign that he had passed through them at all. He stopped and crouched, pressed his hand flat against the green and felt its texture clearly beneath his palm. When he lifted his hand, nothing rose with it. The grass had not been pressed.

A slow unease began to coil in his chest. He straightened and looked toward the pasture.

The cows were still there, scattered along the fence in their strange, uneven groupings, their sides rising and falling as they breathed. He raised a hand and waved, then lifted his voice and called out, the way he had a thousand times before, but no heads turned. No ears flicked. It was as if the sound had never reached them.

He picked up a small stone and tossed it between two of them. It disappeared into the grass beyond without so much as a startled twitch.

The perplexity of it all left him hollow. He made his way to the barn, each step dragging like a thousand. His heartbeat quickened, and the rhythm of it seemed to spill outward, threading into the world itself. Every footfall matched an invisible pulse. Every breath raised the crescendo, and for a fleeting moment he felt as though the land itself was moving with him, not around him.  

The barn loomed in front of him, seeming to swell with his heart and lungs. The wood pulsed, growing and stretching to extreme proportions. As he stumbled forward, the doors opened by themselves. Inside, his tractor sat running. The headlights were on, shining directly in his eyes, though the engine smelled faintly of ozone instead of oil

*I… when did I?...*

The engine’s humming invaded his every sense, its vibration pitching in time with the rhythm that seemed to surround him. A pulsing headache bloomed behind his eyes, and shapes, impossible and shifting, unfolded in his vision as if the world itself were bending inside his skull.

Jack’s vision sharpened instead of blurring. The pain behind his eyes drew tight, not like a wound but like a lens being turned into focus, and the world shifted with it. The barn no longer held a single shape. Its walls layered over themselves, boards overlapping boards that were not there a moment before, angles folding into angles that should not have fit. The space inside it felt deeper than its outside allowed, a hollow that opened inward rather than containing.

The tractor’s headlights shone forward and backward at once. The beams did not stop at the far wall but slid through it into something that was not darkness but depth.

Lines ran everywhere. Through the dirt floor, through the walls, through the tractor’s metal frame, through his own hands and arms. Some were thick, some thin, some vibrating so fast they were only a shimmer, all crossing and bending and tangling through one another in patterns that made his stomach tighten and his breath come shallow.

Not the surfaces he had always known, not the shapes he named and trusted. This was a structure that held everything in place. The very reality or existence around him.

“Holy Christ!” he screamed. Nothing felt real. His stomach turned to lead.  

Jack swayed on his feet, one hand braced against the tractor’s hood. The metal felt wrong now, too warm and too distant at the same time. The engine’s hum no longer sounded like sound. It was a pressure that moved through him, a vibration that matched something deeper than his ears, something that seemed to run through his bones and into the ground beneath him.

He lifted his head.

Where many the lines converged, something stood.

It was not a shape in any way he could name. It had no clear edge, no surface, no form that stayed consistent from one moment to the next.

It had been in the field. It had been in the barn. It had been beneath his feet since the moment he woke. The thing did not turn toward him in any way that space could describe, but he felt its attention settle on him all the same, like a change in pressure. Hairs rose on his neck as he felt the world turn to him.

Jack took a step back.

The space behind him did not behave as it should have. The barn stretched away instead of receding. The floor did not carry him so much as slide beneath him, and the distance he tried to create did not feel like distance at all, but like an adjustment. He couldn't make progress.

He swayed a moment before falling to the floor. The lines tightened. He felt like he was floating, carried through the world in a mist he couldn’t see.

The thing did not move closer. It did not need to.

His heart hammered, and with each beat the world seemed to answer, a subtle tightening and release that ran through the barn, through the land beyond it, through the air and the ground and the sky above.

His breath came in shallow gasps. The pressure in his skull built higher and higher, images tumbling through his brains. Curves without radius, angles that bent inward on themselves, depths that opened in places that should have been flat. His hands trembled.

The thing’s presence deepened. Not closer. Clearer.

Jack cried out, though he did not hear the sound. The lines did not fade. The world did not return.

He was still inside the barn when his eyes felt like they ruptured. Brilliant colors exploded across every surface.

The *thing* drew closer, until all the colors vanished. All that existed was black.

It was all black.

\---

Jack opened his eyes. There was no light, no darkness. There just *was.*

Bands of deep purple swirled with emerald green. Pinks and yellows converged and dissipated. Shapes flowed between it all, bending and breathing with him.

He lay there, taking it all in. Not because he chose to, but movement was all the same. He was both there and not. 

He rose with nothing but a thought. The light bent to his will and folded around him. He walked out what was once his front door. Patterns greeted him, all in varying degrees of intricacy. 

Jack moved, gliding forward, or was it backwards? He didn’t know nor care where he went. As shapes moved past him, he reached out and touched them. Some multiplied, some dissipated.

The patterns moved, replicated, subjugated, all at once.

And the place where Jack Buchannan was, existed, and ceased. ",4,1767668707.0,TalesFromTheCreeps,2,0.84,False

we got new office room and the new environment feels too strange to me it made me uncomfortable also i sit in front of my manager i feel watched all the time i feeeel siiiiiick. i thought today will be smooth, just me sitting on my desk, merging some PR and go home, but nope i feel sick at 1pm feeling like wanna vomit the entire time. we had sprint planning meeting at 4pm and i mispronounced “Text “ as “Sex” in front of 20 people. and hour later i got text from my ex coworker saying her office currently full wfh and im so fucking jealous i wanna die

and you know what worse? i’ll be going back home to my well tended apartment, recently cleaned before christmas during my long holiday, and smells like pine tree scented candles. this is also a new thing, because in the past i always come back to a messy dirty apartment with tons of dirty clothes on the floor and dishes that haven’t been washed for months, and my nasty apartment gave me comfort somehow. i know clean apartment is a good thing and i should be happy to finally improve mentally and cleaning up is a great first leap but i have this unreasonable dread of coming home to something that is not usually familiar to me. everytime i see that clean apartment it reminds me of the long PTO days where i was happy and controlled which i no longer have. it feels like i should come back to the usual messy dirty apartment to feel like myself again, to feel like i belong. this is such a strange irrational feelings.

i feel pretty normal this morning. i woke up at 6, had good breakfast, hot black coffee and lofi music playing on my tv, after breakfast i read The Wild Sheep Chase for 30 minutes, then journaling, i wrote my agenda for the day, do my work, go home, eat dinner, read a book, but now at the end of the day after going through the actual day job i feel sick physically sick and nauseous at the idea of doing all that agenda it’s like my body telling me “this is not who you are what the hell you think you doing?” it’s like my body refuse to change it refuses novelty and growth it made me feel physically sick.

right now im at the bathroom stall still at my work despite the work been over hours ago. i just sit here next to the toilet bowl vaping. i don’t feel like wanna go home maybe i should wait a bit until i feel better. i wanna walk somewhere to get fresh air and clear my mind but my body is too tired to walk while carrying 5kg laptop bag.

i think i stayed at this tiny bathroom stall because it’s my safe space. it’s the place i always go to when i need a bit of freedom. it knows how messy and fucked up i am. this place knows that i cannot “change” and will stay as the same old me. i eat my lunch here, read here, cried here, nap here, draw and write here, the only place i can safely escape to, this stall is mine, this stall accepted everything that wrong with me while my clean apartment doesn’t, i feel like this is the kind of place i belong to. now that my messy apartment is gone, this public bathroom is the only one left for me.

but i don’t like it here, staying here meaning there’s nothing change about me despite the attempt of reinventing myself during my PTO days i feel quickly reverted back into that bathroom stall dweller i feel like if i die i’d probably haunt this particular stall LMAO. i wanna go home but not to that place i wanna go home where i can be messy and failing without the place reminding myself of who i was few days ago.

nothing is actually that stressful happening with my work tbh and i’m probably being a dramatic emotional human immobilized in my office bathroom stall at 9pm i just feel overwhelmed with having to start on this old yet entirely new routine. i’m scared of change but i want to change myself and the way i view my work i want to be normal and functioning and better than last year but it’s just ended up making me sick.

i wanna go home, drop my stuff on the floor because fck tidy apartment, and take benzo and sleep but i can’t leave this bathroom stall yet, i don’t feel safe yet.",1,1767668675.0,DiaryOfARedditor,0,1.0,False

Happy new year!

I have been using my picopresso for about 1 year to create great espresso using the method below. I recently moved and started up again. 

  
Method: 

0. Preheat the unit by pouring boiling hot water (after the kettle turns off) into the unit.

1. 14, 15, or 16 grams of whole bean coffee ([this kind](https://www.eightoclock.com/products/eight-oclock-coffee-dark-italian-espresso-whole-bean?variant=52860685025644)). The coffee has remained consistent (just a newer bag since I moved) 

2a. Grind on 7, 8, or 9 clicks from zero on the Tinemore Chestnut C2 

2b. Put grinds into the basket with the funnel.  

3. Use the distributor tool to ""swirl it around"" in the funnel 

4. Tamp with the funnel still on, remove the funnel, tamp again very lightly. 

5. Setting the basket aside, pump out the preheat water into the sink 

6. Insert the basket and refill the water tank 

7. Pump 11 times, wait 10 seconds (a small amount of droplets appear on the basket holes furthest from the center of the basket) 

8. Pump fully into the cup. 

  
Since I have not been able to produce a good crema (after I moved), I noticed that when pumping fully into the cup, there's been a lot less resistance to the pumping motion; I can basically pump it with one hand with hardly any exertion. Before I moved and when I was making good crema, the unit routinely required two hands and an even pumping motion lasting about 1 second per pump.

Today, I am sharing the complete review and a replicable process. If you are struggling with whether to abandon your small site, give this a try—it might just be the lifeline you need. 



# Part One: Keyword System Construction (The Starting Point for Everything)



❌ Most people fail at SEO not because their content is poor. ❌ But because the keywords they choose from the start are**""destined not to rank.""**

**Core Principle (Mindset First)**

The goal is not to ""find keywords,"" but to **""build a keyword system.""**

A healthy keyword system must simultaneously satisfy the following:

* Keywords for **rapid initial volume** (quick wins).
* Keywords for **mid-term scaling** (traffic amplification).
* Keywords for **long-term traffic dividends** (market dominance).



**Step 1: Start with the ""Demand Pool,"" Not the Tool**

Before touching any tool, I do one thing: List the**five categories of questions** that users genuinely search for: 

* **What is/How does** (Informational: What is / How does)
* **How to** (Informational/Navigational: How to)
* **Comparison** (Commercial Investigation: X vs Y / Best X)
* **Problem/Solution** (Informational/Transactional: Why / Fix / Error)
* **Decision-Making** (Transactional: Pricing / Alternative / Review)



This step determines whether you unearth **""keywords with click value""** or **""keywords no one clicks on.""**



**Step 2: Bulk Keyword Mining (Don't Rely on Just One Tool)**

**Method 1: Google Keyword Planner (Free, Quick-Volume Generator)**

Specific Process:

Open Google Keyword Planner ([ads.google.com](http://ads.google.com/) → Tools → Keyword Planner).

[Google Keyword Planner](https://preview.redd.it/mctx9toh5nbg1.jpg?width=1116&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=785f62aa6f2c14fe9e560990cb5b4894d3df5a74)

Input **action-oriented core terms**.

❌ **Avoid** generic terms like ecommerce.

✅ **Use** terms like build online store / start ecommerce website.

Export all keywords.

*Why avoid generic terms?* Because the data Google provides for generic terms is from an ""advertising perspective,"" which is often irrelevant for SEO.

 

**Method 2: Google Suggest + People Also Ask (Often Overlooked)**

This is my key method for filling in long-tail keywords:

Search the main keyword on Google.

Record:

* **Auto-complete (Suggest):** I recommend a tool like [https://keywordtool.io/](https://keywordtool.io/) to generate a large number of related search suggestions from various platforms' auto-complete data.
* **People Also Ask (PAA)**
* **Related Searches** at the bottom of the page.



These keywords share a common trait: **They have been searched by real users, and the search intent is highly explicit.** 

[find backlink](https://preview.redd.it/938vcker5nbg1.png?width=1280&format=png&auto=webp&s=44e9366315bf7c4229abc783ab908a7783a92e06)

[people also search for](https://preview.redd.it/cnrft2qs5nbg1.png?width=1280&format=png&auto=webp&s=f6f9c3ec55ba2f53570dea569169cd1a6d3e73a6)



**Method 3: Competitor Keyword Reverse Engineering (Highest Efficiency)**

Use Semrush → Input competitor domain.

Go to Organic Keywords → Filter by:

* Position **6–20**
* Search Volume **≥ 100**



What do these keywords indicate? They show that**""Google has already recognized this content structure, but the 'optimal solution' has not yet been achieved.""** This is your opportunity.

 

**Method 4: Semrush Keyword Magic Tool**

This is a highly efficient method for bulk generation, classification, and filtering of keywords:

* Open Semrush → Keyword Magic Tool.
* Input core term (action-oriented or demand-oriented).



Classify by intent or topic:

* **Informational** (Information-seeking)
* **Commercial** (Commercial investigation)
* **Transactional** (Ready to buy/act)



Set filters for Search Volume and Keyword Difficulty (KD):

* Search Volume **≥ 100**
* KD **≤ 40** (Easier to rank initially)

 

**Step 3: Keyword Screening Criteria (Don't Just Look at Search Volume)**

Many people fail at SEO by only screening keywords based on search volume. My method is the **Four-Dimensional Screening Method**, where each dimension has specific operational standards.

https://preview.redd.it/soujrfty5nbg1.png?width=1948&format=png&auto=webp&s=bb0b659eccdd628bab294361d6920cee3b0625e4

**Practical Tip for SERP Analysis:**

Search using **incognito mode** to avoid personalized results.

Tally the proportion of result types in the top 10.

Note the title, description, and URL types to determine if your content has an entry point.

If the top 10 results are all large e-commerce sites or high-authority brands, it indicates difficulty in ranking quickly. Place these keywords in the mid-to-long-term observation list.

 

**Step 4: Keyword Layering (The ""Crucial Point"")**

**KD 15–25 (Month 1):** **Rapid ranking** → Send positive signals to Google.

**KD 25–35 (Month 2):** **Amplify traffic** → Establish topical authority.

**KD 35–45 (Month 3):** **Compete for industry terms** → Capture scale dividends.

 

The sequence is critical. If you mix up the order, a new site can easily **""fail to break through.""**

 

**Final Deliverable:** An Excel spreadsheet with fields including:

* Keyword
* Search Volume
* KD
* Intent
* Corresponding Page Type



# Part Two: Competitor Analysis (Not Copying, but ""Finding Flaws"")



The core goal of competitor analysis is to **find areas that they have already validated but haven't executed perfectly**, and then precisely target those gaps.

**Step 1: Selecting the Right Competitors (Where 90% of People Go Wrong)**

❌ **Do not** choose industry giants. 

✅**Choose** sites with a similar Domain Authority (DA) **and** existing organic traffic.

**Standard Operating Procedure:**

* **Tool Selection:** Semrush / Ahrefs / Moz.



**Candidate Selection:**

* DA is within **±10** of yours.
* Ranking for **≥ 1,000** keywords.
* Traffic source aligns with your target market.



**Data Validation:** Check their homepage/blog/product page traffic and confirm that their ranking keywords cover your planned core topics.

**Final Screening:** Select **3–5** competitors for in-depth analysis.

 

**Step 2: Deconstruct Content Structure, Not Just Word Count**

**Goal:** Be **""more useful""** than them, not just longer.

**Operational Process:**

* Open the top 10 competitor pages for your target keyword.



**Deconstruct the content structure:**

* H1/H2/H3 hierarchy.
* Paragraph length, formatting, images, tables, diagrams.
* CTAs, downloadable resources, FAQs, case studies



**Step 3: Finding ""Overcomable Points""**

**Formula:** Opportunity = They are already ranking + Their content is not maximized

**Operational Steps:**

**Identify Potential Keywords:**

Ranking **3–5** → Low competitive pressure, significant traffic potential.

Ranking **6–10** → Potential for a quick flip/takeover.

**Compare Content Coverage:**

* Do they have VS / Comparison content?
* Are they missing localization, scenario-specific, or niche audience content?
* Are they lacking in-depth information, charts, case studies, or operational guides?



**List Optimization Solutions:**

* Add comparison tables / FAQs / case studies.
* Scenario-specific examples: localization, industry/audience customization.
* Downloadable resources or interactive tools to enhance user experience.



**Prioritize:**

* Traffic Potential × Ease of Improvement = Priority

 

**Step 4: Backlink Analysis → Determining Where to Get Exposure (Semrush Practical Guide)**

**Goal:** Not to blindly build backlinks, but to find high-value sources that competitors have already leveraged, which you can emulate or optimize.

[Semrush backlinks](https://preview.redd.it/29ong1o56nbg1.jpg?width=1024&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=0d7d131f1791ccda84847f3fd5a48094af6acaca)

 **Operational Process:**

* Open Semrush → SEO → **Backlink Gap**.
* Input your domain (**You**).
* Input **1–3** competitor domains.
* Click ""Find Prospects.""



**Analyze Results:**

The page will display three types of backlinks: i.  Links that**both you and competitors have**→ Reference content format or relationship building. ii. Links that**only competitors have**→ This is your potential opportunity. iii. Links that**only you have** → Consolidate your advantage and increase authority.



**Filter High-Value Links:**

* Focus on sources with high DA/traffic and strong relevance.
* Exclude low-quality or spam links.
* Mark as ""Priority Targets"" for outreach.



**Develop an Exposure Strategy:**

For high-value resource pages, industry blogs, and news media: 

▪   Submit content collaboration / guest posts. 

▪   Offer quotable resources or tools.

For social media or forums covered by competitors but not by you: 

▪   Join topic discussions. 

▪   Provide unique insights or case studies.

 

# Part Three: Content Creation



The essence of SEO is not just writing articles; it is **""occupying a topic"" with content.** 

**1. Topic Cluster Construction**

**Goal:** Occupy the entire topic and establish authority.

* List the **Core Topic Terms** (3–5 most important ones).
* Use Keyword Planner / Ahrefs / SEMrush / ChatGPT to expand related **long-tail keywords**.



**Classify by Search Intent:**

* Informational (How to / What is / Guide)
* Comparative (vs / Best / Top)
* Transactional (Buy / Price / Cost)



**Generate a directory tree for each core term:**

**Pillar Page** = Overview + Table of Contents.

**Supporting Pages** = One article for each sub-topic.

**Internal Linking Strategy:** Supporting pages link to the Pillar Page, and the Pillar Page links to supporting pages + mutual cross-linking.

**Tools:** Ahrefs / SEMrush / SurferSEO / Excel for directory tree mapping.

 

**2. Page Role Positioning**

**Goal:** Ensure every page knows its ""identity"" to increase search engine crawl weight.

**3. AI-Assisted Content Creation**

**Goal:** Efficiently generate structured content while retaining human judgment.

**Outline Generation:**

**Prompt:** Generate an article structure covering What / Why / How / Compare / Mistakes / FAQ.

**Content Filling:**

* AI generates the first draft.
* Human supplements with exclusive data, case studies, and experience summaries.
* Verify logic, SEO keyword coverage, and formatting.



**Supplementing Missing Questions:**

Use PAA / Related Searches / Reddit / Quora / Zhihu (Chinese Q&A platform).

Add new FAQs or sub-topic pages.

**Tools:** ChatGPT / Claude / Perplexity + Ahrefs PAA / SurferSEO.

 

**4. Post-Publication Secondary Engineering**

**Goal:** Increase traffic by optimizing existing content rather than just writing new content.

https://preview.redd.it/ojtsliij6nbg1.png?width=1708&format=png&auto=webp&s=e2bd3cb993ddef3dea5fe5da45d5d3f7cc1a8542

**Supplementary Tips:**

* Use GA / GSC / Heatmaps to monitor performance.
* High CTR → Retain; Low CTR → Adjust title and meta description.
* Ranking in the top 3 → Expand supporting pages to form a thematic closed loop.

 

# Part Four: Link Building (The Accelerator, Not the Foundation)



**Conclusion first:** More backlinks are not necessarily better. The key is to provide them **""to the right page at the right stage.""** 

I break down backlinks into **4 types + clear purposes**, executed in sequence.

**I. Overall Backlink Strategy**

In this project, the backlink positioning was singular: **to push pages that already have ""potential"" into the top 10 sooner.**

Therefore, any page receiving a backlink must meet at least one of these conditions:

* Already ranking in Google's top 20.
* Has stable impressions.
* Is a core page in a keyword cluster.

 

**Method 1: Resource-Based Backlinks (Most Stable, Controllable, and Most Used)**

This is the most recommended and cost-effective method.

**Step 1: Create a Page ""Worthy of Citation""** **Note:**❌ Not a regular blog post. ✅ A**tool-based / data-driven / compilation-based** page.

Types I have successfully used:

""A Collection of 200 Standalone Website Tools (Categorized by Stage)""

""A Complete Breakdown of Standalone Website Cost Structures for 2024""

""Comparison Table of Common SaaS for the XX Industry""

**The only criterion for judgment:** When someone writes an article, will they find your page useful enough to cite?

 

**Step 2: Precisely Find ""People Who Might Link to You""** I don't search randomly; I use this logic:

**Outreach Formula:**

    site:blog OR site:resources

    keyword + ""tools"" / ""guide"" / ""resources""

Then filter by:

* Content relevance.
* DA ≥ 20.
* Updated within the last 6 months.



This step usually screens out **30–50 highly matched websites.**

 

**Step 3: Backlink Outreach Email** This is the email template I frequently use:

     Hi {{Name}},
     I was reading your article on {{Article Title}} – very solid breakdown.
     I noticed you mentioned {{Tool / Topic}}.
     I recently put together a curated resource:
    “{{Your Resource Title}}”
     It includes {{Specific Value Point: quantity / classification / data}}.
    I’ve also referenced a few tools you mentioned.
     If you think it’s useful, feel free to include it as an additional resource.
     Best,
    {{Your Name}}

 

**Method 2: Forum & Community Backlinks**

The core of this method is not ""authority,"" but: **Letting Google see you being mentioned in a real-world context.**

**Step 1: Only Select ""Content-Driven Communities""** Communities I have actually used:

* Reddit (specific subreddits).
* Indie Hackers.
* Industry forums (non-SEO forums).

 

**Step 2: Behavioral Strategy** The rules I set for myself:

* For the first 7 days, only answer questions, do not post links.
* 2–3 high-quality replies per day.



Replies must include:

* Experience
* Judgment



Trade-offs Once the account ""looks like a real person,"" then start: **Only post a link when it is genuinely helpful.**

 

**Method 3: Competitor Backlink Mining (Efficient + Precise)**

The core idea of this method is: **If they link to a competitor, they might link to you too.**

The key is to find highly relevant, high-authority, and genuinely active websites.



**Step 1: Preparation**

Select **3–5** competitor pages ranking in the top 10 (preferably core keyword pages).

Confirm the page type: Resource page / Data page / Tool page / Industry guide.

 

**Step 2: Use Tools to Mine Backlinks** Recommended Tools:

* SEMrush → Backlink Analytics
* Ahrefs (Optional)
* Majestic (Optional)



 **Operational Process:**

* Input the competitor domain or specific URL.
* Filter for effective backlinks (DoFollow / DA≥20 / Content relevance)



Export the list, including:

* Linking source URL.
* Target page (the competitor's page being linked to).
* Page Authority (PA) or similar metric.



**Step 3: Outreach Strategy** The approach is similar to ""Resource-Based Backlinks"":

**Position yourself as a value-add:** Explain that the resource/data you provide is a beneficial supplement for their readers.

**Be specific:** Indicate where they can cite you.

**Do not directly ask for a ""link"";** instead, offer an ""additional reference.""

 

**Email Template Example:**

    Hi {{Name}},
    I was exploring your article on {{Article Title}} and found it super helpful.
    I noticed you referenced {{Competitor / Topic}}.
     I recently published a resource:
    “{{Your Resource Title}}”
    It includes {{Specific Value Point: data / tools / classification}}.
    It could serve as an additional reference for your readers.
    Would love to hear your thoughts.
    Best,
    {{Your Name}}

 

**Method 4: Partnerships & Brand Mentions**

This method is suitable for B2B / SaaS / Tool sites like yours.

Find **5–10** upstream and downstream tools/partners.

Proactively suggest:

* Joint content.
* Tool comparisons.
* Use cases. They will typically:
* Mention you on their Blog.
* Mention you in their Help Center.
* Mention you in their Newsletter.



# Part Five: Website Technical Optimization (Technical SEO Audit)



The goal of Technical SEO is to **ensure search engines can smoothly crawl, understand, and index the website, while also improving user experience and page performance.**

No matter how good the content is, if technical issues are not resolved, the ranking will not improve.

**I. Crawl & Indexing**

**Goal:** Ensure all core pages of the website can be crawled and indexed.

**Operational Checklist:**

https://preview.redd.it/btfoe9rq6nbg1.png?width=1561&format=png&auto=webp&s=8cd0dbf3c42c28f4c904153376709c3b18586360

**Tip:** Prioritize the crawling of core Pillar Pages and high-value supporting pages, and avoid wasting crawl budget on low-value pages.

 

**II. Website Performance (Performance & UX)**

**Goal:** Improve page loading speed and mobile experience.

**Operational Checklist:** 

https://preview.redd.it/x36d9gfr6nbg1.png?width=1571&format=png&auto=webp&s=e0003da9332210cb1794816733664adc4b482c84

**Tip:** Prioritize optimization for Pillar Pages; supporting pages can be optimized gradually based on traffic volume.

 

**III. Structured Data (Schema)**

**Goal:** Help search engines understand page content and improve SERP display effects (Rich Results). 

**Operational Checklist:** 

https://preview.redd.it/bkeafggs6nbg1.png?width=1563&format=png&auto=webp&s=f6b8828b0b918e667eda328652564040f91d25c6

**Tip:** Prioritize marking up core pages; supporting pages can be handled in batches.

 

**IV. Internal Linking & URL Structure**

**Goal:** Ensure internal authority flows to core pages, and URLs are concise and readable.

**Operational Checklist:**

https://preview.redd.it/lxo5ow4u6nbg1.png?width=1569&format=png&auto=webp&s=cb1cf295dc41f045f5728b2ec097162e9894867b

  


**V. Routine SEO Health Check**

**Operational Checklist:**

https://preview.redd.it/jiohybnu6nbg1.png?width=1579&format=png&auto=webp&s=35bd8ef398b86635044c2cd96afdfb973f9b7e73

**Tip:** Conduct a full-site Technical SEO audit once per quarter, prioritizing the repair of core pages.

 

**VI. Data Closed-Loop & Prioritization Strategy**

**Prioritization:**

**Tier 1:** Pillar Pages + High-traffic supporting pages.

**Tier 2:** FAQ / Comparison pages.



**Tool Combination:**

Screaming Frog / Sitebulb / Ahrefs → Full-site crawl.

GSC → Indexing and coverage.

PageSpeed / Lighthouse → Performance optimization.

Google Rich Results Test → Schema check.

**Closed-Loop Method:**

Technical Optimization → Content Publication → Data Monitoring → Secondary Optimization.

1q56shz,https://www.reddit.com/r/SIBO/comments/1q56shz/desperate_post/,Desperate Post,"Deciding to post here with the hope someone can shed some light and maybe help me get though this hell. Maybe it’ll just be a helpful vent for me, so excuse me if it becomes verbose.

I am chronicling my entire battle here with ‘IBS’ as, unfortunately, it has become a long and strenuous battle. It almost becomes difficult to remember the entire timeline as I enter the new year. I figured it would be prudent to take note of everything that has happened from first symptoms, doctors visits, and medications. Hopefully this will give me sufficient detail to prompt either AI or doctors - honestly still not sure which will provide more help.

I am going to take note of everything, even if it may have nothing to do with my IBS.

Throughout my whole life, ironically I usually had excessive bowel movements and flatulence. Nothing concerning or painful ever, just a reality that I would defecate multiple times a day and fart constantly. In my later years of high school, I noticed I was having some issues with lactose so I started switching from milk to lactose free versions. I would still eat lactose products and feel fine for the most part, so the only lactose I cut out was milk. 
Fast forward into college, and junior year is when I start noticing a little change. I am unsure if this is related, but it definitely didn’t help my health - when I ate within a couple hours of a workout, I found myself puking frequently. At the time I was on the rowing team and the scrunching movement would really upset my stomach and cause me to puke almost daily. Also, at this time I noticed some issues mainly with late night oatmeal. Maybe it was caused by the milk I put in my oatmeal, but I often used oatmeal as a late night snack in college. Oftentimes, after a late night oatmeal snack, I would wake up the next morning with some cramping. I was very reliant on Tums to help my cramping, and they usually did the trick.
Up until this point, I am not sure if anything above is a hint as to my condition, or just red herrings and excess information that is not prudent. It came in my second semester of senior year where the real problems started. The rest of this story or nightmare, whichever you prefer to call it, takes place from January 2025 and onwards.
In late February, I began to notice some constipation issues. I was pooping far less frequently, and far less in general. I didn’t really think it was too much cause for concern, as I usually had the opposite issue as previously mentioned. After a couple weeks of fewer and fewer bowel movements, I began to get slightly concerned. It got to the point where my bowel movements were just pebbles that were difficult to force out. This coincided with my college spring break, where I went out to Colorado for skiing. In Colorado, the constipation had gone from a nuisance to now causing some pain. I finally decided to deal with the cramping, so I stopped at a store in Colorado and picked up some stool softener. I thought this would be the end of the story, and I could just move on, but the stool softener did not fix me. After no success with stool softener, I upgraded to miralax and was still constipated.
Following Colorado, nothing improved. In fact, everything worsened. The constipation continued and the camping became debilitating. It was at this time I realized I had a problem I needed to address. I began hopping on reddit and AI asking for first steps to take. The consensus way to deal with gut issues is through diet. I had taken the obvious steps of restricting products with lactose, but now I began cutting what seemed to be giving me issues. Unfortunately, this seemed to be everything. It got to the point where I was eating spinach and salt, hoping to avoid the debilitating cramps. I of course tried eating more fiber, but this didn’t provide any relief.
It was at this time when I got my first doctor's appointment. My first doctor’s appointment for the gut issues was on April 9, 2025. In this doctor's appointment, I took a GI panel (stool test), urinalysis test, and other miscellaneous tests. Frustratingly, the tests all came back clean, giving me no information. The diet I was currently on had helped slightly, but the cramping was still painful. At this point, I tried booking an appointment with a GI doctor only to find out they were booked out for at least 6 months. Desperate, and with no immediate help in sight, I decided to go to the ER with the hopes of getting tests done and or at least to increase my priority on the GI waitlist. During this time, I was obsessively researching GI issues, convinced I had something along the lines of IBS, Chrons, or some other chronic gut issue. I was trying everything I could find on the internet at this time. Fiber pills, peppermint enteric encoated pills, peppermint tea, probiotics, yogurt, kefir, pickles, ibs pills, tums. You name it, I tried it.

My ER visit came on April 19. In this visit, they ran many of the same tests the previous doctors ran with many of the same results. They also performed an X-Ray scan of my abdomen which came back clean. This was a low point as I had seen all the doctors I could see, and had learned nothing new. However, it was also at this point that I came up with my most likely problem: SIBO. I became convinced I had sibo as many of my symptoms aligned, especially some of the more niche symptoms like I had splotchy red skin at one point. The main symptoms I was experiencing throughout this time were cramping, constipation, feeling like air was trapped, belching. Confident I had Sibo, I went to the PA and requested a SIBO breath test. These symptoms have been constant throughout my journey - especially feeling the need to burp but being unable to. And whenever I am fortunate to either fart or burp, I feel some slight relief.

Despite all my confidence that my symptoms had aligned with SIBO, the test came back negative. I still wasn’t fully convinced I didn’t have it, as my hydrogen peaked within 30 minutes of the breath test which I was told was because the glucose was absorbed so quickly in the small intestine, it could point to my GI issues being in the upper small intestine. 

After even this had failed, I became extra desperate and resorted to something I had heard about - the carnivore diet. On this diet, I consumed only steak and tallow. It was this diet that gave me my first sign of hope. While consuming this diet and a digestive daily probiotic, I started noticing a lessening of symptoms and cramps. Within a couple weeks, I had gone from constipation to wet, frequent stools. Continuing through this, I was momentarily cured. I got through summer having issues, but them being rather minor. Cramping here and there, but nothing debilitating. I noticed coffee and cream would make me cramp the hardest so I gave those up. I was still having issues, but far from what they were in previous months. I came off of all restrictive diets, and was this way for a couple months.

Then I moved, and about a month after moving the symptoms were back and worse than ever. Extreme cramping and just feeling ill after every meal. I tried the carnivore diet again, but this time, it did not provide the same relief. I stayed on it for longer, but did not get the same benefit. After doing carnivore for about a month and still experiencing symptoms, I realized it might have been the probiotic that helped me, not the carnivore. I took the same probiotic (Digestive Advantage Intensive Bowel Support Probiotic Capsules) that had previously helped me. This is when something strange happened.

Most of my symptoms went from my stomach to my head. The main problem for me then became debilitating brain fog. Immediately after eating, I would experience immense fog, making it difficult to focus or think. It was also during this time that I finally got in with a GI. He performed a colonoscopy and endoscopy, where he found I was lactose intolerant. I had already assumed this, but it was good to get confirmation. His only other finding was melanosis coli and some mild irritation in the colon. Additionally, the colonoscopy confirmed I don’t have Chron’s or any kind of ulcer colitis. Lastly, they confirmed I don’t have celiac or any gluten intolerance. He said he could treat the mild irritation, but I doubted that could cause all my severe issues.

That takes me to just recently, when I saw a video on SIBO and thought it aligned perfectly with my symptoms. I began herbal treatment for the SIBO, where I noticed some improvement. I think it was the ginger artichoke pills that have been helping me, so I have continued those. I still deal with severe brain fog and some cramps if I eat known bad foods. 

This leads me to now. I am hoping my herbal treatment of SIBO (oregano, berberine, ginger artichoke) can prove helpful as it has already lessened bloating and symptoms, but it doesn't seem to be a cure. The brain fog is the main issue that I have been dealing with lately - feelings of dissociation and drunkeness upon waking up and after eating. The brain fog became so bad I thought I might have histamine intolerance, so I tried taking Famotidine. And this is where I am at today as I continue my struggle with these GI issues.

Hey Maximizame fam! 👋

Feeling like you're running on fumes lately? Or maybe just a little… stuck? We've all been there. That feeling of wishing you had more hours in the day, boundless energy, or just that extra spark of joy to make things feel *good*.

The great news? You don't need a magic wand! You can actively *upgrade* your life, starting right now. It's all about smart optimization, and I wanted to share a few things that have been game-changers for me, and hopefully can be for you too.

Think of your life as a system. Just like a computer or a phone, sometimes it needs a little fine-tuning to run at its best.

Here are some quick hacks to get you started:

*   **Time Blocking Magic:** Seriously, schedule your day. Not just meetings, but *everything*. That workout? Block it. That deep work session? Block it. Even dedicated ""no-distraction"" time. It sounds rigid, but it actually *frees* you up by removing decision fatigue and ensuring what's important gets done.
*   **Energy Auditing:** Where does your energy go? Track it for a few days. Are you spending hours on social media that leave you drained? Are certain conversations a total energy vampire? Identifying these drains is the first step to plugging them and redirecting that precious energy to things that actually fuel you.
*   **Micro-Joy Moments:** Don't wait for a vacation to feel happy. Find joy in the small things. That first sip of coffee. A beautiful sunset. A quick dance break to your favorite song. Actively seeking out and savoring these tiny moments can drastically shift your overall mood and outlook.
*   **Systemize Your Success:** What tasks do you do repeatedly? Can you create a checklist? A template? A simple process? This applies to everything from meal prep to responding to emails. Automating or simplifying these things frees up mental bandwidth and time.

It's not about a complete overhaul overnight. It's about making small, intentional adjustments that compound over time. Think of it as a series of upgrades, each one making your system run a little smoother, a little faster, and a lot more joyfully.

Sometimes, navigating these feelings and making these changes can feel overwhelming. If you're struggling to find your footing or need some extra support as you work on yourself, please know you're not alone.

1q56r0m,https://www.reddit.com/r/stories/comments/1q56r0m/the_department_of_acceptable_outcomes/,The Department of Acceptable Outcomes,"Arthur Pelts worked in a building that looked like it had been designed by someone trying not to be noticed.

It wasn’t ugly exactly. It was just… apologetic. A tall grey thing with windows that seemed uncertain about being windows, as if they’d been added after someone realised humans needed daylight to survive.

Arthur understood this kind of design. He’d spent most of his life trying not to be noticed either.

The building was home to the Department of Acceptable Outcomes.

The Department did what its name promised: it decided whether the things that happened in the world were acceptable.

Not good. Not fair. Not deserved.

Acceptable.

This was an important difference, though it took Arthur a long time to realise why.

On the seventh floor, in Acceptability Review—Subsection C: Personal Disappointments (Non-Fatal)—Arthur processed the quiet collapses. The kind of collapses that didn’t make the news but did make people stare at ceilings at 2:14 a.m., wondering how they’d ended up with a life that felt like a smaller version of the one they’d pictured.

Arthur had two stamps.

One said: ACCEPTABLE.

The other said: UNFORTUNATE BUT STATISTICALLY EXPECTED.

He used the first one more. Not because it was always true, but because it sounded kinder. And Arthur liked kindness. He liked it the way some people like strong coffee or clean sheets—something necessary, something that made existence feel a little less sharp at the edges.

His desk also had a mug with a cartoon cat clinging to a branch above the words HANG IN THERE.

Arthur didn’t even like cats, but the mug had been a gift, and he had never developed the ability to throw away gifts. He kept them like proof that someone had once thought of him.

Most mornings, Arthur opened case files and did what he was trained to do.

Case 7C-4411.

Denise K., 42. Promotion awarded to someone else. Notes indicated she would smile and say all the right things and then sit in her car and cry so silently that even she might not hear herself.

Arthur stamped ACCEPTABLE, then paused, pen hovering over the paper.

He wasn’t supposed to write anything beyond the stamp. But he did anyway—small, in the margin, like a confession made to a wall.

Still hurts, though.

He closed the file and sent it on, as if it might arrive somewhere that mattered.

The Department believed that naming things made them manageable. That giving disappointment a label was a kind of control. Like putting a wild animal in a cage of language.

Sometimes Arthur believed it too.

Sometimes he didn’t.

On the days he didn’t, he tried to concentrate on the mechanics: open file, read, stamp, close file.

A life reduced to a sequence. A person reduced to paperwork.

It was easier than thinking about the alternative, which was that the Department existed because nobody knew what else to do with the chaos.

At lunch, Arthur often sat opposite Marlene from Subsection F: Minor Joys (Overlooked).

Marlene dealt with things like unexpectedly warm sunlight, finding a forgotten coin in a coat pocket, laughing at a joke that wasn’t even funny, and the relief of a cancelled plan. She treated these events with the seriousness other people reserved for tragedy.

“You look like you’re walking around in someone else’s body,” Marlene said one Tuesday, unwrapping a sandwich that smelled strongly of mustard and determination.

Arthur smiled in a way that didn’t quite make it to his face. “Is that one of your cases?”

“It could be,” she said. “What’s yours?”

Arthur didn’t answer. He didn’t need to. In the Department, silence was a form of disclosure.

Then his phone buzzed with a notification that a new case file had arrived.

He went back upstairs.

At his desk, an envelope waited.

The label made his stomach do something strange, like a lift door dropping half an inch before catching itself.

Case 7C-8890.

Arthur Pelts, 39.

Arthur stared at the words for a long time, as if he could make them rearrange themselves into something else.

He checked the return stamp.

Internal.

That was impossible. Department staff weren’t supposed to appear in the system. You couldn’t be both the judge and the judged. That was the rule. The rule was there for a reason.

Rules, Arthur had always thought, were there to keep reality from leaking in.

He opened the file anyway.

Event: Life feels smaller than promised.
Notes: No single incident. Ongoing condition.

There were attachments. Charts. A graph with a line that dipped gradually, year by year, like enthusiasm draining through a slow puncture.

There was a section titled: Things Arthur Thought Would Happen By Now.

It listed, in neat departmental font:

A sense of purpose

A great love (or at least a vivid one)

A house that felt like home

More laughter

Less fear

Arthur felt the room tilt slightly—not physically, but emotionally, as if the building had shifted to accommodate a truth.

The file wasn’t cruel. That was the worst part. It was calm. Factual. Like a weather report for the soul.

Arthur picked up the ACCEPTABLE stamp.

His hand hovered.

He pictured stamping his own dissatisfaction as acceptable, and something in him recoiled. Not because the Department was wrong. Life was full of disappointments. People did adapt. They did carry on. That was what humans were best at, sometimes to their own detriment.

But it wasn’t just disappointment in the file.

It was a question.

A question that Arthur had spent years avoiding.

Is this it?

He set down the stamp.

He picked up the second stamp—UNFORTUNATE BUT STATISTICALLY EXPECTED—and found he couldn’t lift it.

His hands were suddenly heavy, as though they belonged to someone older.

Then he saw a red pen on his desk. He didn’t remember where it came from. Maybe it had always been there, hiding under forms. Maybe it had appeared because the universe occasionally gave people small tools when they were finally ready to use them.

Arthur uncapped the pen and wrote, across the front page of his own file:

UNRESOLVED

The effect was immediate.

The lights flickered.

The printer beside him began to whine, then spit out blank pages like panic.

Somewhere far above, a phone rang and kept ringing, as if trying to warn everyone about something nobody could name.

Arthur sat very still, red pen in hand, heart pounding the way it did when he was about to do something he couldn’t undo.

Two minutes later, a security guard arrived—not with menace, but with the brisk politeness of someone who had been trained to treat all crises as administrative.

“Mr Pelts,” the guard said, as if they were meeting for coffee. “The Director would like to see you.”

The Director’s office was clean in the way that suggested effort rather than nature. A cleanliness that had been enforced.

The Director looked at Arthur with tired eyes. She didn’t look angry. She looked… worried.

“You can’t do that,” she said softly.

Arthur held the file like a guilty child holding a broken vase. “Why?”

“Because…” The Director exhaled. “Because if things are unresolved, people start to believe they can change them.”

Arthur blinked. “Isn’t that… good?”

“For people,” the Director said.

There was a pause.

“For systems,” she added, “it’s a disaster.”

Arthur thought of all the stamped files. All the quiet griefs made official. All the lives that were told to accept what hurt.

He thought of Denise crying in her car, gripping the steering wheel like it was the only solid thing in her world.

He thought of his own graph, trending down.

The Director slid a form across the desk.

“You have a choice,” she said. “Retract the stamp. Return to your position. We’ll mark this as a momentary lapse.”

“And the other choice?”

“Transfer to Subsection Z.”

Arthur had heard of Subsection Z the way people heard of deep ocean trenches. It existed, but nobody wanted to go there.

“What’s Subsection Z?” he asked, though he already knew.

“Irreconcilable Events,” the Director said. “No stamps. No verdicts. Just… reality.”

“How long do people last there?”

The Director hesitated. “Not long.”

Arthur surprised himself by smiling. “And how do they leave?”

“Different,” she said.

Arthur signed the transfer form.

He went back to his desk, packed his mug, and left the stamps behind.

Down in the basement, Subsection Z had a single whiteboard on the wall. The writing was uneven, like it had been written by someone with a trembling hand, or by someone who had finally stopped pretending.

WHAT HAPPENED, HAPPENED.
WHAT HAPPENS NEXT IS UP TO YOU.

Arthur stared at the board for a long time.

He felt fear, yes—because there was no stamp to hide behind, no label to make the world feel settled.

But he also felt something else. Something gentle. Something like air entering a room that had been closed for years.

A kind of permission.

Unresolved didn’t mean doomed.

Unresolved meant alive.

That evening, Arthur walked out of the building and noticed—truly noticed—the sky. It wasn’t dramatic. It wasn’t a movie sky. It was just the sky, doing what it had always done, above a world that kept happening without anyone’s approval.

He thought about all the things he had stamped acceptable.

He thought about the one thing he hadn’t.

And for the first time in a long time, he didn’t feel the need to decide what his life was.

He only felt the need to live it.

To do one small thing that might make the graph curve upward again.

Even if only by a fraction.

Even if nobody stamped it.",2,1767668025.0,stories,1,0.75,False

After being diagnosed in late November, I started  Vyvanse at the beginning of December - two weeks at 20mg and then 30mg ever since.

Each day I do find there's time where I have more focus / ability to stay engaged on a task - also noticing more energy and less brain noise (but I do have GAD so it's never zero!). 
But on the other side I'm finding I feel kind of jittery, I'm clenching my jaw a lot more (already have tmj but it's feeling worse), and its hard to catch my breath / take a full breath? 
I have been taking my dose with breakfast and then making sure to eat and hydrate throughout the day, but I am still having caffeine - one tea, maybe one coffee. 
Does anyone have any thoughts or input? Should I be expecting more from ADHD meds than what I'm feeling?

\*\*\*

Bright blue light glowed into the dark room. Yohan sat on the floor doing his nightly stretches half listening to the people on the other end of the Iris message. He was wearing comfy clothes, a loose green mesh tank top, a pair of gray thigh length mesh shorts, and a pair of black calf-hugging socks. He was in the middle of a deep split stretch when something caught his attention. He looked up at the Iris message and frowned.

“Where is Harin hyung? I never see him these days.” Yohan asked, becoming fully upright while he was still in the splits.

On the other side of the call two boys just a bit older than Yohan shared a concerned look. They had a silent conversation in the span of three seconds. The room they sat in was the living room of their small dorm in Seoul. While it was dark in Yohan’s room the light was bright and sunny on their end. The room awash in midmorning sun. The pair then looked back towards Yohan and tried for smiles. They did not look convincing to the son of Terpsichore.

“Oh, he’s just been practicing pretty rigorously. You know how he is.” Jisoo said, waving away Yohan’s concern. Yohan frowned, this was always the response. He wasn’t sure why but he felt like his group members were keeping something from him. Had Harin gotten hurt or something? Yohan needed to know.

“I know how he is, but it doesn’t explain the months of not seeing him. Is he… mad at me or something? Is he hurt? What’s going on?” Yohan asked as he crossed his arms in front of his chest. His legs slowly collected inwards so he would now be sitting cross legged.

Evan shifted uncomfortably, clearly they hadn’t expected Yohan to push back on their lie. Yohan’s frown deepened and he stared down the other boys. Silence. Yohan looked at Jisoo and then shifted to the taller Evan. Then Yohan saw it. A look of guilt flashed across Evan’s face. He was right, something was wrong.

“What aren’t you telling me?” Yohan demanded his voice rising. Yohan could forgive a lot, but lying was a bridge too far. Especially from people he considered to be brothers. Cracks formed in Evan’s stoic facade. Then Jisoo’s face started to show his guilt.

“He’s…” Evan began, Jisoo shushed him quickly. Evan shook his head and pointed at Yohan. “He deserves the truth Jisoo. He’ll find out eventually anyway.”

Jisoo huffed. He looked away from his two other group members. His face was like stone, unrelenting and stoic. But then it softened. “He’s gone Yohan. Without a trace.” He said his voice just above a whisper.

“What do you mean gone? How long? Where did he go?” Yohan yelled at the people on the other side of the Iris Message. He stood and looked at the screen. The stony glare he gave to his friends could cut gems. As Yohan’s voice rose his group members flinched at each word. They clearly hadn’t expected the stoic Yohan to be so animated. No answers came right away. Just silence. “Really? Nothing, not one fucking word?”

“He’s been gone since September and-“ Evan began before Yohan cut him off.

“Since September? Seriously? Four months and you couldn’t say one fucking word to me?” Yohan screamed at the glowing swirl of mist in front of him. A tear escaped his eyes as he quickly wiped it away with the back of his hand. “I… I trusted you. Both of you.” Yohan said wiping at his eyes again as tears threatened to escape out of his careful control.

“Yohan, just wait.” Jisoo said as he motioned to Evan giving him a knowing look. The taller boy walked off screen as Jisoo continued. “Just wait. He… he left us a note.” Jisoo said as Evan returned with a napkin in his hand. Jisoo took it and took a deep careful breath. A pause and then he began.

""I'm sorry for leaving without saying anything. But I finally found a way to change things. A way to make an actual difference in the world. Don't try to find me. Where I'm going, you can't follow. Love, Seo Harin.”

Yohan sat for a moment tears falling freely now as he made no attempt to hide them. He turned away from his group members, his former brothers. He sat in silence unsure of what to say, to feel.

“We’re sorry Yohan really we-“ Evan began again before Yohan turned to him and glared at him.

“Shut up! Just shut up, you’re not sorry for not telling me you’re sorry you got caught. No.” Yohan said as he threw his water bottle across the room with a series of loud clangs. His hands were shaking a rage building and he felt like he might burst like a cork on a bottle of expensive champagne. He was confused, sure. But he did know one emotion he felt, betrayed. “I never want to speak to you again.”

With that he dispersed the Iris Messages. The protestations from his group members lost to him in the now eerie quiet that overtook his dark room. Yohan stood there a numbness creeping over him. He felt nothing and everything all at once. Trust had always been hard for Yohan, there were very few people he felt that he could trust one hundred percent. Since he was little he had very few people on the list and today that list got significantly shorter.

Yohan was sad, he was angry, he felt like breaking something. But despite Yohan’s best wishes a flood of memories rushed his mind all at once. Snippets of his life, snippets of the people he had loved like brothers. Jisoo coming to the practice room late one night offering Yohan a water and a break from Yohan’s self imposed criticism during a late night solo practice sesssion. Evan putting a lengthy arm around Yohan’s shoulder as they walked the streets of Seoul after an intense workout and making Yohan feel safe and like he belonged. Harin sitting cross legged on his bed across of Yohan in the room they shared in the HopLyte dorm. A small smile on his lips as he offered Yohan a snack. A hug when Yohan started crying after thinking about his ex. The four of them sitting on a too small couch in the their dorm living room watching a cheesy K-drama together. Evan’s long limbs shoving Yohan onto Harin’s lap, Jisoo spilling his banana milk on the coffee table as Evan elbowed his arm, and burst of laughter from all four of them. A closeness that only brothers can share. All of it gone, all of it shattered like a priceless artifact. A history of a time long gone and better off forgotten.

As Yohan rose to his full height he walked over to the mirror in his room. He stared at his face for a long time. The hints of any smile long gone. What remained was a hard stare. What remained wasn’t a boy, no that boy was gone. What remained was someone broken, someone discarded. Trash. Trust had never been easy for Yohan, but one thing was certain. It would be impossible in the future. So as he stared at himself his face hardened and Yohan didn’t recognize who he saw any longer. But he continued to stare to try and learn who he was now, as if the answer was there in the mirror, but the truth wasn’t there.

The truth eluded him like trust did and maybe that’s how he ended up here? Yohan had been lying to most people since he joined camp and maybe the truth was that what you give to the universe you receive ten fold? Maybe if he hadn’t lied, hadn’t hid parts of himself this wouldn’t have happened? He didn’t know the answer to these questions. What he was is a scared boy alone for the first time in almost a decade. What he was was a broken boy who had the rug ripped out from underneath him. But only time could tell if he could collect any of his pieces again.",3,1767667673.0,CampHalfBloodRP,0,1.0,False

1. While you start speaking to your match, you'll start to see some desperation in her replies and she is eager to meet you (ladkiya dry text krti hai ek to phle hi and ye to alag se too good to be true holiya ji)

2. Kaha ho, kaha rehte to, mil lete h, vibe match karlenge milke fir dekh lenge kaha jaana hai , baaki tum jaga bologe mai ajaungi

Now what if she's texting good but doesn't seem to be a scammer but you're not sure, do this

1. First date should be getting to know the person, not party or something (subjective but I'll add up), so ask her out at a known place which are inexpensive. I mostly prefer somewhere to walk and try out street food, like gol gappe , momos or some lassi together, that gives us space and amazing ambience to connect. Or it could be a coffee shop too which would hardly cost around 250 max. Your budget shouldn't exceed 500-1.5k on first date because you never know what's coming ( subjective acc to baap ka paisa🥀)

-ek baar mai to mele me gaya tha wahi ki first date jhula jhule, glass wale game khele or teddy jeeta😭

2. If she's into you, she would appreciate you, she's coming for you, not your materialsic things, that doesn't mean you would not get anything for her, 100rs ke flowers se kuch ni hota, sweet gesture 

Now for the peeps who wanna drink and stuff 

1. Ask her out at your place or your known place, or ask her out somewhere which is pretty famous, if she's denying it then you know what it is

2. Having the conversation of split can make things awkward for many women as they expect a man to pay, but a considerable women will atleast offer to split or pay, if she does, it's your duty to pay up the bill, but if she doesn't even flinch, time to split babyyy. First date h, anjaan ho tum, nobody is obliged to. It's just a sweet gesture that an man to pay up and she will appreciate that ( only if she offers, warna samjh jaana she's here for free food)

1q56hay,https://www.reddit.com/r/getdisciplined/comments/1q56hay/are_habit_tracking_apps_really_worth_their_price/,Are habit tracking apps really worth their price?,"Hello,

I ask myself a real question after testing a lot of habit tracking apps (stop smoking, sleep better, light sports, diet, coffee, etc.).

Honestly, I can't understand what justifies paying for many of these apps. In most cases, I have the impression that it is not much more than:
•	 Check a box
•	 Display a streak
•	 Send notifications
And in the end... I could do the same thing on Notion, a paper calendar, or even a simple note.

I also noticed that:
•	 Many apps bet a lot on streaks (which I sometimes find anxiety-inducing)
•	 Notifications quickly become invasive
•	 The majority is paying without necessarily bringing real educational value

Personally, what I would really look for would be rather:
•	 Concrete help to quit smoking (not just ""day 12 bravo"")
•	 Simple tips for better sleep
•	 Maintain form without performance obsession
•	 A real follow-up of food hygiene
•	 Reduce coffee with explained alternatives
I often have the impression that these apps are motivating in the short term, but not very educational or really accompanying in the long term.

I have tried several apps such as habitify, streaks, habitbull, productive etc .. but none makes me want more than that

So I'm curious:
•	 What do you really like about tracking apps?
•	 What makes you stay instead of giving up after 2 weeks?
•	 Do you know any apps that give real personalized advice based on habits (and not just stats)?

I would consider it stressful. Work around 13-14 hours a day (all screen time), 1 hour workout, 3ish hours of personal work/cleaning/errands, then around 6 hours of sleep if I’m lucky. Sometimes it’s better, often worse.

In the office there is free energy drinks and coffee, I also use caffeine pills, nicotine pouches, and on needed occasions, adderall. On extra special occasions, coke. Gym there as well. The office also has free food that I eat and its normally healthy. To be honest, with the stimulants I’m not often hungry.

I don’t think this is so bad, but I can’t explain how bad I feel after work. I’m riddled with stress. It’s not unnecessary anxiety though, my coworkers have said they feel it too and it’s grounded in the deadlines I have. The only time I don’t feel stressed is when I workout.

I don’t know if stress in and of itself is bad for health, or the other behaviors caused by stress is bad… I don’t want to die of a heart attack. Do I need to manage stress or my behaviors to avoid one?

1q56e1l,https://i.redd.it/r1ht2uzq5nbg1.png,I Chose to Divorce After Three Years of Serving My Husband’s Family,"For four years since I married into this family, I’ve cooked the New Year’s Eve dinner three times in a row.



Each time, I’d head to my in-laws’ house early to prepare the dishes. Working from dawn till dusk, exhausted to the point of collapse and no one helped me.



This year, being pregnant, my mother-in-law arranged for the whole family to dine out. After finishing the housework and rushing to the restaurant, I found they had already started eating.



Twelve people from four households, but only eleven seats in the private room. I stood awkwardly at the door.



I didn’t know whether to leave or stay. I wanted to ask the waiter to add another seat, but my mother-in-law looked displeased.



“Can’t you see the private room is already crowded enough? What are you doing here? Once we’re done eating, Yohan can bring you some leftovers, right?”



——



I never imagined that just because I skipped cooking one New Year’s Eve dinner, I wouldn’t even have a seat to eat.



Standing there, I was stunned by my mother-in-law’s questioning. “No one told me I couldn’t come?”



I looked at her, but she just reminded me that pregnant women shouldn’t be running around. I should’ve stayed home resting and there was no need to come out.



I was speechless. Who had left all those chores for me to do earlier? I worked from four to six and took only a quick sip of water.



Then I changed clothes and rushed over for the New Year’s Eve dinner. But when I arrived, they told me there was no seat for me at all.



My second sister-in-law sneered beside me, “Hey, sis, haven’t you ever eaten at a restaurant before? Now you’re trying to freeload? You’re over four months pregnant, don’t you think about the baby?”



I swallowed my anger and replied calmly, “No need for your concern. I’ll take responsibility for my own child.”



Unexpectedly, my mother-in-law’s face darkened. She set down her cutlery and asked slowly, “The child isn’t just yours, it’s our Fortescue’s too.”



“If something really happens, what responsibility can you possibly take besides crying a few times?”



I glanced at my eldest sister-in-law and second sister-in-law, who were waiting to see me humiliated. Then at my indifferent husband and the others who remained silent.



Sighing, I decided to stand my ground. “Mom, if you truly care about me, why did you make me handle all the housework?”



“You go out for morning exercises, play chess in the afternoon. Can’t you spare a single moment?”



My mother-in-law was shocked by my words. She probably hadn’t expected me to contradict her in public.



She immediately roared angrily, “I do the housework, then what do you do? Lie in bed? Even pregnant, you need exercise! Otherwise, you’ll become useless!”



I countered, “Mom, don’t your words contradict yourself? First you tell me to stay home and not wander off, yet now you want me to exercise more?”



Ever since marrying Yohan Fortescue, these past four years have been nothing but turmoil.



At first, we planned to move out and live independently. But because my eldest and second children didn’t want to live with us, my in-laws started pestering us.



Being shy and sensitive, I ultimately had no choice but to agree. Little did I know it would be the start of my nightmare.



From my wake-up time to the frequency of my water intake, I controlled every aspect of my life. I worked all day and still have to do housework when I get home.



My father-in-law played cards and my mother-in-law played chess. During holidays, whenever the whole family gathered for meals, I was always the one responsible for cooking.



I complained to my husband countless times, but he always brushed me off. Over time, I grew numb to it all. But this time, I didn’t want to tolerate it anymore.



Seeing me stand up to his parents, especially with the other two families present, Yohan kept signaling me to leave.



Chapter 2



If I refuse to go, he accuses me of being unreasonable. “We can discuss this at home. Why make a scene here?”



I stared at him silently, then suddenly laughed. My laughter was tinged with utter helplessness.



“Yohan, is this what you think? You think I’m a disgrace? All these years of humiliation I’ve endured, when did you ever stand up for me?”



“Before we married, you promised we’d live separately. Did you keep that promise? Of all the things you promised me, which one did you actually fulfill?”



“Every time I ask, you come up with one excuse after another. Is this fun?”



Faced with this barrage of questions, Yohan’s expression darkened. He glanced around at the others first, still worried about saving face.



He hadn’t considered these issues at all. My mother-in-law stared at me in disbelief.



“Well, well! After just a few years, you want to kick us out? Who agreed to let us live with you in the first place? Now you want to go back on your word?”



I scoffed coldly, “If you hadn’t cried, screamed and threatened suicide, would I have agreed? I couldn’t help it. I couldn’t be as heartless as the other two sisters-in-law.”



At these words, both the eldest and the second sisters-in-law’s expressions changed. They glared at me with furrowed brows, but couldn’t say anything. Who told them to be so guilty to begin with?



Back when my mother-in-law fell ill and needed a daughter-in-law to care for her, they never uttered a word about it, not even a glance.



In the end, it was my own reluctance that made me agree. Now the Fortescue family reaps what they sowed. It was my bad luck.



But I never expected my mother-in-law would shower the other two daughters-in-law with even more affection. When it came to me, it was expected. All I wanted to ask was why?



“Are you done making a scene? It’s the New Year! What are you shouting about? You’ve ruined the mood for the whole family!”



Faced with Yohan’s accusations, I could only retort, “Sorry, but I’m going to make a scene tonight. With the whole family here, I won’t feel right until I speak up.”



Suddenly, my father-in-law smashed his bowl. When the room finally fell silent, he stood up, furious.



“Look at yourselves! What kind of behavior is this? We finally got the whole family together for the holidays and you have to start fighting now? Whoever wants to eat this meal can have it. I’m done!”



My eldest and second brothers-in-law left with their wives and children. Everyone’s expressions were clearly uncomfortable.



My mother-in-law glared at me coldly. “Are you satisfied now? Did you have to make such a scene to get your way?”



Yohan looked at me with disappointment. As if I’d committed some unforgivable crime, he turned and walked away.



Probably because I was so emotionally overwhelmed, my belly suddenly clenched in pain, forcing me to crouch down, gasping for breath.



I tried to grab the chair to steady myself. But I still ended up sprawled on the floor, drenched in cold sweat.



My husband and mother-in-law, the last to leave, witnessed my collapse. My mother-in-law was stunned at first, then began to mock me.



“Starting to put on a show now? Think this will win you sympathy? It won’t work. What you did today can never be forgiven.”



Yohan looked down at me with disdain. I reached out for him to call 911, but he pushed my hand away.



His face twisted with disgust. “I’m ashamed to have a wife like you, just keep pretending. No matter how well you act, it won’t change anything. You’ve already disappointed me.”



Watching their retreating backs. The only one truly disappointed was me. When I woke up again, I was already in the hospital.



Chapter 3



My brother, Zeno Noury, sat beside me. He’d driven all the way from our hometown just to be here and take care of me.



Seeing my family, tears welled up in my eyes. Zeno spoke to me carefully, “Abigail, there’s something you need to be prepared for. The doctor said that due to emotional and other factors, the baby... the baby is gone.”



He quickly reassured me, “But as long as you’re okay, that’s all that matters!”



Actually, my parents were there too, standing in the hallway. Zeno had decided to tell me this alone.



He’d thought of countless ways to comfort me, fearing I might break down. But unexpectedly, I remained strangely calm.



I didn’t cry or make a scene, just stared blankly at my belly. I stayed in the hospital for three days.



During that time, Yohan and his family never once showed their faces. My parents couldn’t bear it and wanted to confront them.



I stopped them, hoping they’d let me handle this matter myself. That evening, I packed my things to go home.



On the way, I got a call from Yohan. “Have you calmed down? When are you coming home?”



They thought I was angry, which was why I’d been staying at my parents’ place. I forced a bitter smile.



“I’m in the car. I’ll be home tonight.”



Yohan just said, “Oh, okay.”



He then hung up the call, completely indifferent.



When I got home, my mother-in-law opened the door. She looked me up and down, unable to hold back her complaints.



“Had enough fun out there? I’ve never seen anyone like you, who goes back to parents’ house after a fight.”



She added, “I’ve been doing all the housework these past few days. Are you satisfied now?”



I glanced around the house and was stunned by the sight before me. The living room was filthy beyond belief, littered with sunflower seed shells and fruit peels everywhere.



The dining table was a mess, needless to say and the coffee table was splattered with grease and soup stains. Fruit flies were buzzing around it.



I asked, “This is what you call cleaning?”



I couldn’t comprehend how they could live in such conditions. If I were in this environment, every second would feel like torture.



My mother-in-law snapped back impatiently, “What else could I do? It is already the best I can do.”



Yohan chimed in from the side, “She’s so old, Abigail. How do you expect her to handle this house? The rest is up to you. Is two hours enough?”



Surveying the utter chaos, I could only sneer inwardly, then replied firmly, “If you can’t handle it, do it yourselves. If you can’t manage, pay for a cleaner. I’m not your servant.”



With that, I grabbed my bag and went straight inside.



My mother-in-law yelled, “Is that how a daughter-in-law should speak? Looks like your trip back to your hometown has made you forget your place!”



Yohan blocked the bedroom door, preventing me from locking it.



He warned me, “Do you even know how much it costs to hire a cleaner? How much money do we have for you to throw around like this?”



I really admire them. They didn’t lift a finger when I was not around.



Fine, if they won’t work, at least stop eating nonstop. They made the house messy and dirty, just waiting for me to come back and clean it all up alone?



“Aren’t your parents quite generous?”



“They'd rather talk business at the New Year's Eve dinner table than spend $300 on a cleaning service?”



My mother-in-law explained, “What’s wrong with spending a little money for the whole family to eat together once a year? Isn’t that how it should be? Are we supposed to split the cost between three families?”



I replied, “Yeah, that’s how it should be.”



Instead of getting angry, I laughed and challenged her. “Then why don’t you pay the monthly mortgage, car loan and utilities?”



“All of these, I paid for them all! That’s what you should pay for, why should I? The house and car aren’t mine and the utilities aren’t that much.”



Chapter 4



Seeing my mother-in-law resorting to unreasonable arguments, I didn’t bother saying much more. I was used to it and it has been like this for years.



The mortgage was $4,000, the car loan was $1,000 and utilities totaled over $5,000. Plus, every day groceries and dining out were all on me.



Even with my salary of over $10,000, it’s not enough to keep this up. Not to mention how many times my in-laws took my money to subsidize their other two sons.



I pushed Yohan aside and warned them before closing the door. “You can handle the cleaning yourselves. I’m only here to pack my things.”



I added, “Tomorrow morning, I’m driving to the 55 to finalize the paperwork.”



Yohan thought he’d misheard and demanded why I needed to go to the City Hall.



I smiled and countered, “What else would you need to go there for besides divorce?”



“You actually want to divorce me? Have you lost your mind?”



My husband seemed flustered, his voice not as loud as before. His mother, however, appeared utterly unconcerned. I suspected she’d be delighted if I divorced her son.



Still, Yohan warned me, “Fine, you can divorce me. But first, you’ll give birth to the child.”



My mother-in-law said, “That’s my precious grandson. You won’t be able to disappear without giving birth to my son.”



Grandson?



All I wanted now was to sever this relationship. And never have anything to do with their family again.



Of course, I calmly replied, “I didn’t give you a choice. See you at the City Hall tomorrow morning.”



I only grabbed a few clothes and my tablet. As I was leaving, Yohan rushed after me. He grabbed my wrist, forcing me to stop.



“Haven’t you gone too far lately? Must you do this during the New Year? Fine, I’ll hire a cleaner. You just stay home and keep an eye on things.”



As soon as Yohan finished, his mother started complaining, “That won’t do! Hiring a cleaner is so expensive. What better things could we buy with that money?”



“Besides, you’ve backed down this time. Who knows what kind of trouble this brat will cause in the future?”



I nearly laughed out loud. “So marrying into your family means I’m free labor, huh? All the food, drinks and expenses, it’s all on me. Can’t you show some decency?”



At that, my mother-in-law trembled with rage. Pointing at me in disbelief, she yelled, “You... dare insult me?”



I replied, “Why not? Don’t I deserve it? When I married into this family, you gave me a TV and it’s secondhand, right? No house, no money for renovations and you wouldn’t even pay for the wedding.”



Before I could finish, my mother-in-law started arguing back. “We had no money back then. What could I do?”



I countered, “Was it truly no money, or just unwillingness to spend on me? When the eldest and second son got married, I never saw you being this stingy.”



“And every time you were sick and hospitalized, who was there taking care of you? People should have basic decency. No one is anyone else’s slave!”



“You... you... you...”



My mother-in-law trembled all over, unable to utter a word.



I knew she had no counterargument.



It was also for her son’s benefit. Sure enough, Yohan approached his mother and pointed an accusing finger at me.



“Get out! This family doesn’t need you anymore!”



I smiled calmly. “I was waiting for you to say that.”



Without another glance back, I walked away. I checked into a hotel and unlinked the bank card tied to the household account. Making sure they couldn’t touch a single penny, I then called my lawyer friend.



I wanted to get all our assets back and kick that family out of here.



The next day, Yohan did show up at the City Hall on time. His parents were with him.



When they saw me get out of the car, my mother-in-law started her sarcastic remarks, “You still have the nerve to drive here? Once both of you divorced, that car won’t be yours anymore.”



I was too lazy to argue with her. I knew that’s how people who didn’t understand the law were. They would say anything, but unfortunately, I didn’t care what they said.



Yohan looked at me with a complicated expression. “Are you really sure about the divorce? I can give you another chance.”



I answered, “No need. Just sign the divorce papers.”



Before going inside, my mother-in-law laid down three conditions. The divorce was acceptable, but the house, the car and the grandson must all go to their family.



Yohan nodded in agreement. “Exactly. That’s what I think too.”



I looked at them with a cold smile. “You must have discussed all this last night, right? It’s a pity you can’t take anything with you. The property deed is in my name. I paid for the car. As for the child...”



I touched my belly, reminding them expressionlessly. “No need to mention the child. He’s already gone.”

1q56cjy,https://charlieworks.org/the-cure-for-alcohol.html,11 years sober after heavy daily drinking – wrote this free book on alcohol as societal control/poison (full download),"Hey everyone,

Long-time lurker in recovery spaces, finally coming out of the shadows. I was a daily 10–20 beers guy for about a decade (plus smokes, pharma, most drugs except the really bad ones). Born privileged, nice neighborhood—none of that protected me.

11 years sober now. What finally “cured” me wasn’t endless meetings or accepting a lifelong disease label—it was seeing the full picture: alcohol isn’t just a personal issue, it’s a normalized poison designed to keep society compliant, profitable, and stuck. Once that clicked, the desire vanished completely. No white-knuckling needed.

I wrote it all down in a short book called “The Cure for Alcohol.” Covers:  
\- Alcohol’s historical use as control (ancient Egypt to today)  
\- Why moderation and “drink responsibly” are traps

I am very much a writer of poetry and ponderings but with limited time lately (due to working and being a parent!) I find myself in a creative slump. I want to start writing longer form correspondence because I feel like most things in my life are instant and urgent.

I'm also big on sharing photos of my mundane days; ranging from coffee to sunrises and everything in between. I'm open to voice notes if we get along. Maybe long voice notes? Who knows.

Either way, slowness is what I am after. I do not have time for instant responses or constant chatting.

My other interests include reading, going to the gym, crochet and listening to podcasts. I'm in the Southern Hemisphere.

You don't need to be a parent but just understand that much of my day is controlled by my two dictators 😂",3,1767666890.0,penpals,1,1.0,False

1q56b3l,https://www.reddit.com/r/FriendshipAdvice/comments/1q56b3l/med_school_friends_iced_me_out_now_they_want_to/,"Med school friends iced me out, now they want to hang out again, how do I navigate this?","I (F23) started med school last summer (2025). My cohort is small, and while everyone is generally friendly, it naturally split into two groups. I quickly became close with the group I fell in with; we studied together all day, took coffee breaks, and spent most of our time together.

About halfway through the fall semester, things started to feel off. My “friends” became distant, and I eventually found out they had made a separate group chat where negative things were being said about me. I asked one of the girls I was closest to what was going on, and she told me in detail what had been said, it was mostly driven by one person, but no one else pushed back. The friend who I talked to about it asked me not to say anything because she didn’t want to get in the middle of it. 

What hurt the most was that some of the things being said were judgments about very personal things I had trusted them with. These were things I only shared after they had repeatedly asked what was wrong, saying they could tell I was struggling mentally and emotionally and wanted to support me. Instead, those disclosures were made fun of, and my feelings were essentially labeled as “too much.” Knowing that things I shared in a vulnerable moment after being encouraged to open up were discussed behind my back was incredibly painful.

I was devastated. Med school is already incredibly difficult, and having your support system turn on you doesn’t exactly help. I tried changing myself based on their criticisms, but nothing improved and I continued to be iced out.

After a lot of conversations with my family and my therapist, I decided to remove myself from the situation. I decided that I didn’t need to stay in a group where I wasn’t wanted. The behavior felt juvenile, I thought that at this age people would have outgrown being catty. Stepping away ended up being one of the best decisions I could have made. I’ve felt calmer, more at peace, and better able to focus on my studies.

Now the new semester has started, and suddenly everyone from that friend group wants to be friendly again. They’ve been asking how I’ve been, saying things like “I feel like we haven’t talked in forever,” and asking to hang out and catch up.
I don’t want to create drama by staying distant, but I also don’t want to put myself in a position to be hurt again. At the same time, I do want friends. I’ve thought about trying to get closer to the other half of the cohort, but they’ve already grown very tight over the past six months, and I’m not sure how to break into that socially.

At this point, I feel stuck. I know how I feel and how the change has been good for me, but at the same time i’m second-guessing myself and feel like maybe I was overreacting to the situation. I don’t know if it is worth trying to mend the friendships, how I navigate it if I decide not to, and if I decide to not try and patch things up, realistically, how am I suppsoed to build connections with the rest of my cohort at this point.
Any advice would be appreciated.

1q56amt,https://www.reddit.com/r/CostaRicaTravel/comments/1q56amt/itinerary_check/,Itinerary Check,"Hi all! We're just about to book our trip for next month for a honeymoon. I am concerned it's a bit rushed as I see others spending 3-5 days in places we are going to be 1-3 days. But we are young, will have a car, and pretty easy going if plans change. However, this is only our second international trip as adults and would love to get feedback from experienced travelers on our plans and a few questions I added at the bottom. Thanks!

**Day 1:** Land in SJO and check in at hotel

**Day 2:** Breakfast, pick up rental car, and drive to Puerto Jimenez

**Day 3:** Breakfast in town, hang at the beach, late lunch/early dinner,  evening mangrove tour

**Day 4:** Corcovado Tour (all day)

**Day 5:** Sleep in check out and drive to Uvitas/Dominical. Drop luggage off, and go to Cataratas Nauyaca.

**Day 6:** Whale tour in morning, spend rest of day exploring / at beach. (SEEKING ADVICE ON LODGING)

**Day 7:** Wake up early, and spend all day at Manuel Antonio. Dinner at Emilio's Cafe

**Day 8:** Sleep in, check out, and drive to Monteverde, lunch and spend the afternoon in the forest. Dinner at Nativo Restaurant

**Day 9:** Coffee tour in the morning, San Lucas Treetop Dining Glass Lounge Experience

**Day 10:** Sleep in, check out, and drive to Fortuna see the waterfall, and end the day in the hot springs

**Day 11:** Maybe do hot springs again in the morning, go see Arenal. Add water rafting trip in afternoon if there's time

**Day 12:** Check out, Drive back to San Jose, stop along a couple waterfalls (Bajos del Toro & Catarata Vuelta del Cañon) if there's time. Check in to hotel

**Day 13:** Sadly, come home

**QUESTIONS:**

1. **Day 5-7:** For this part, we're curious if anyone has experience checking out of an AirBnB but picking up luggage later. We want to stay near Manuel Antonio on Day 6 before we tour it Day 7, but aren't sure if any BnBs in Uvitas would let us check out but come get luggage later so that we can do things in Uvitas during the day before driving up to Manuel Antonio. We've seen early luggage drop off as an option, so that's why we thought some might offer late luggage pickup. Or would it make more sense to drive all the way up to Manuel Antonio, check in somewhere there and drive back for the other activities?
2. **Monteverde:** Are there specific can't miss activities/tours here? or should we just go self-guided exploring
3. **Fortuna:** This is the part where I feel we might be rushing - should we spend more time  here? If so, would it be just relaxing or are there activities. Should we cut something else out or add a day to the trip?",0,1767666838.0,CostaRicaTravel,4,0.5,False
