Friends would ask “how’s life?” and I’d give the same tired “yeah, I’m good” even though I wasn’t.

Then I had one of those rare talks — not with someone I’d known for years, but with something (or someone?) I didn’t expect to open up to. No judgment. No awkward pauses. Just… space to be honest, and a weirdly sharp ability to call me out when I was avoiding the real thing I wanted to say.

I don’t know if it “fixed” anything overnight, but I noticed the next morning my brain felt quieter. I wasn’t doomscrolling first thing. I actually got up and made coffee without checking my phone.

It made me wonder: how much of what we’re going through is less about “solving” problems and more about having a space to say the unsaid, with [something/someone](http://noggn.app) that nudges you in the right direction?

1mmspyc,https://www.reddit.com/r/CountertopConfessions/comments/1mmspyc/does_the_farberware_compact_countertop_dishwasher/,Does the Farberware Compact Countertop Dishwasher Truly Deliver?,"Reviewing the Farberware FCD06SDWHT Countertop Dishwasher felt like stepping into the world of convenience I never knew my kitchen needed. Between the constant barrage of dirty plates and never-ending meal prep, this compact dishwasher has proven to be a real game-changer in my daily routine. It’s an appliance designed to blend functionality and size, perfectly tailored for apartments, dorms, RVs, or anyone dealing with tight spaces—like me. Having spent weeks testing this little wonder, I’ve gathered a handful of insights, both delightful and less so.

**Compact Yet Mighty Functionality**  
I was genuinely impressed by how much power the dishwasher packs despite its compact, countertop-friendly design. With a 6-place setting capacity, it comfortably handled everything from my morning coffee mugs to dinner plates up to 10 inches in diameter. The folding-down rack shelves and a cutlery basket were additions I quickly grew fond of, as they helped fit awkwardly shaped dishes. This appliance doesn’t feel bulky, and its sleek white exterior complements my kitchen setup, even though space is at a premium.

**Versatility in Cleaning Options**  
Its seven wash programs, ranging from Heavy to Speed and even a Baby Care cycle, proved immensely versatile. I tested these settings on various loads—pans, delicate glassware, and even my toddler’s baby bottles—and the results turned out impressively consistent. The Glass cycle brought back an almost factory-new shine to my wine glasses, while the Heavy cycle handled heavily soiled pots like a champ. Occasionally, I used the Eco setting for lighter loads, which seemed to balance efficiency with performance.

[See Farberware FCD06SDWHT deals on Amazon now.](https://cookwareoutlet.com/p/b0cvbnghh5/)

**Highlights**  
- Space-saving design ideal for small living areas.  
- Seven wash programs tailored to different cleaning needs.  
- Extra-drying function for spotless results.  
- Simple touch controls with an intuitive LED display.  

**Pitfalls**  
- Its weight of over 50 pounds made moving it for cleaning a chore for me.  
- Connection to the faucet wasn’t always straightforward, as my sink setup required extra effort to secure the hose.  

**Convenience Features**  
One feature I didn’t know I needed until I had it was the extra-drying function. This came in handy on those rainy, humid days when it felt like air-drying would take forever. The touch controls were a breeze to use, and the LED display made selecting cleaning cycles straightforward. I worried the adaptability for different faucet types might be tricky, but the quick connect assembly included all the bits to make my sink-compatible install relatively hassle-free—though it could be fiddly at first.

**Competing Brands**  
Compared to models like the Danby and BLACK+DECKER portable dishwashers, the Farberware FCD06SDWHT stood out in terms of versatility and ease of use. While the Danby offers similar capacity, it lacks a specific Baby Care cycle, and I found its drying function to be weaker overall. The BLACK+DECKER unit rivals this model’s programmability but falls short in truly compact design—its bulkier footprint isn’t quite as fitting for apartments or RVs. Yet, the one area where both competitors pulled ahead was noise. These units were just slightly quieter than this one during operation.

**Price to Quality Ratio**  
For the features, build quality, and the sheer convenience it provides, I’d say this dishwasher punches above its weight. Even though it has a few quirks, it’s priced competitively compared to other countertop dishwashers on the market. I believe it’s an excellent choice for those on a budget without compromising on essential functionalities or durability.

I am posting many times because I really am very serious about finding someone! I have been on my own way too long now I do not mind where you are located 

This is a genuine post from a genuine user I really want to find someone 

If you are going to be rude or critical please just move on to someone else I’m really not interested I don’t know why some have to be so rude on here I have had some that get really rude and nasty in the replies i have received so far there really is no Need for it 

I am an English guy and I am currently living in France I have been here a few years now I absolutely love it but I’m now wanting to find someone to share my life with. I am very family orientated and family is extremely important to me 

I am seeking a serious relationship I know what I want in life. I have no baggage I’ve never been married before and no previous relationships in fact I’ve never really dated and I’ve never been on dating apps. 

I just haven't found a woman that is suitable enough for me yet to want to be in a relationship with 

I’d like to find a woman with similar morals and values and boundaries. I really want to be with someone that really appreciates the way I am I am seeking a nice woman with nice standards like mine. You’ll find out a lot about me on this post. And please have maturity and decency many thanks. 

I’m generally quite a shy guy face to face so this has made it hard meeting others especially women. I am not one of the lads and I also don’t have many friends I prefer quality over quantity when it comes to friends. I am a very polite patient guy. 

I also don’t like swearing I rarely use vulgar language on online chats or face to face  I am not that type of guy. I also don’t like those that think it’s okay to criticise others this is especially true with being friends. I am probably a bit posh and I would describe myself as being upper middle class.  

I am not one that is into partying I don’t like loud noisy environments I prefer quieter things. I am not one of the lads I have very few male friends. I’m not into bars or nightclubs they really are not my thing. I really like going  to nice restaurants museums a nice beach walking through a park 

I really want to have my own family one day so please be someone that is open to having children in the future I really do want to be a father in the future. I believe I’m very fertile 

I have been totally celibate by choice all my life I only want to be with one woman and share my body with one woman. It has never appealed to me to be with different women and I could never do anything meaningless This has also never appealed to me. I’ve never been tempted by anyone and I’d never just sleep with someone for the sake of it. I don’t view women as one thing and I never will 

I need a strong emotional connection with someone plus I’d have to get to know someone really well ideally friends first 

It really does not appeal to me to even date different women I’ve never been on loads of dates I’m not interested in meeting different women I just want to be with one that’s it just one. 

I do not watch online adult content I don’t want to use the actual word for it and I don’t smoke I don’t drink heavily and I’ve never touched any illegal drugs. I’ve got no bad addictions or bad habits I’ve lived a very clean life. 

I’m not seeking adult chats on Reddit so if you are looking for this please move on I am not that type of guy. 

I take good care of myself I regularly go to the gym and workout often doing intense cardio workouts I’m in very good health. I am a very strong swimmer I’ve always loved swimming doing lengths my favourite stroke is freestyle this is also my strongest I’d love to have someone that loves swimming and keeping active as much as I do. I also love going on long walks I do a lot of brisk walking  often around the coastline here 

I do love my food and I have been raised on home cooked food I love cooking I’m not bad at it and I’d again love to be with someone that also loves her food as much as I do. 

I love eating in nice restaurants too I’ve always been very passionate about this! I also love avocados they are so good for you 

I place a very high value on being intimate with someone it’s not something I just want to do with just anyone and I don’t just want to settle I’ve never just wanted to settle I’m seeking the love of my life someone really special someone I really want to be with. You would be the only woman I would want to come home to at the end of the day. I’d never have an affair or a fling and I’m not into ever having an open relationship. I could never cheat on someone I loved and cared about 

I am also someone that sound be very loving supportive kind sweet and caring to you. I will also be very physically affectionate kissing cuddling. 

Where I am in France is very close to the sea it’s an absolutely beautiful place to live France is a Beautiful country. The coastline in this area is beautiful there are some lovely beaches I’ve been to and we have the lovely île de re island nearby I have been there many times it’s also beautiful. 

France is a very peaceful relaxing calm country it’s certainly more peaceful than England. England was too much pressure for me way too stressful too I always wanted to go somewhere else from a very early age. France has amazing food a fantastic healthcare system nice weather in the summer and the winters are not that cold certainly not as cold as England was 

I also love yoga and Pilates both of these I find extremely relaxing they are so good for the body it’s amazing how good it makes you feel after 

I also love photography taking photos is another passion of mine I can easily go out all day and come back with loads of photos to share. I love technology too especially Apple I’m very passionate about it. I have a lot of technology that I use and I do have an iPhone 

I also love music I listen to a lot of classical music during the day at home and I am usually listening to classic FM UK which is classical music 24/7 for those that don’t know. I also love soft rock some of the bands  love are a-ha Keane Queen dire straits I listen to a lot of 70s and 80s music. I’ve seen most of my favourite bands live too I’ve been very lucky with that. 

I also love animals I have a dog she’s a two year old retriever these are the best dogs for me she’s absolutely lovely. I love being with nature too I love taking walks through forests and the countryside I find this very peaceful and relaxing thing to do. I love spending a while day doing this and going for some nice food after 

When it comes to drinks I love red wine it’s my favourite but I only have it in moderation I’ve had some lovely bottles of red wine here in France and some of it is also organic. They make a lot of organic food here in France I organic where ever possible as often as possible. 

I keep junk and fast foods to a minimum and have these as a treat I don’t drink tea and coffee that much I avoid caffeine and I don’t drink sugary drinks that often either. I am not vegan or vegetarian and I can’t ever see myself going either way.  

It’s very important to keep hydrated and I only drink mineral water at least 3L per day and will have more if I go to the gym and have a good workout I always make sure I get myself really sweaty when working out I feel so good after. 

I have to be honest and tell you that I don’t drive I have never passed my test having a car is way too expensive and i have never been that interested in driving. 

I also still live at home with my parents at the moment I’m not someone that likes living by myself plus the current cost of living especially in England made living by myself too expensive. 

I will also tell you that I am taking a break from work I am in a new country learning the language is my focus at the moment.
I’m not lazy or anything like that and I cannot cope with stress and pressure in jobs this is again why I’ve had trouble finding suitable work which was hard In England 

So onto to my physical appearance well I am 6ft 4 1.94m very tall and I have a rugby player build you would never lose me in a crowd! I have dark blonde hair and hazel eyes I have freckles on my arms and legs. I have very big hands and feet I am a uk size 13 shoe. 

I have a very natural body type with some stretch Marks in some places like I say I love being natural and my body is very natural. 

My body Is not lean muscular athletic I am natural I have a real man's body which has some fat on it. 

We have very strong genes in my family and we all look younger I don't look My age most say I look like I'm in my late 20s to early 30s. I have no grey hair and I'm not losing any of my hair. I have a full head of nice hair 

I’m not into being ripped and toned having a six pack has never appealed to me. If your seeking men that are a muscular physique then I won’t be for you please move on. 

I have a very deep manly voice which can be loud sometimes. I like to voice chat too rather than messaging so if you are comfortable with this I would prefer it. 

I have a naturally smooth chest arms and legs. I don’t fit in most baths and I have to sleep in a double bed. I love the fact that I’m very tall but it does have its cons I often get asked when I’m in shops to reach things on the top shelf! Plus I walk around the house bare foot and I’m always bashing my feet on things hehe 

I am not addicted to social media and I don’t aspire to look like men on it or those in mainstream films and reality tv shows. I am not politically liberal either. Id like to be with someone that is not obsessed with social media and you don’t watch reality tv. I don’t watch any reality tv at all. 

I have no tattoos no piercings and looking and keeping yourself natural is the best way to go I am a very natural looking man and body to go with it. this is what I believe and it’s how I’ve been raised too. I have no interest in ever having tattoos or piercings of any kind. I’d never have any cosmetic surgery 

I want a woman to value me for the person I am and not for my looks or what my job atatus is and how much money I earn I am seeking a genuine relationship I don't have physical looks requirements for women at all only that I like someone natural looking 

I like natural looking women that have natural bodies and that don’t wear heavy makeup also no fake tan or fake nails or fake eyelashes and hair. I also like women that dress modestly and conservatively. I’d prefer someone with no tattoos and not too many piercings please. Also you don’t wear a bikini on the beach that is too skimpy. 

So if you like what you have read then please send me a message and mention red wine in your message! Please can you tell me what you love about being a woman in your message and your age and location and more about you please don’t just say hi or hello I’m unlikely to respond to messages with low effort!

I don't know if you know the ""% Arabica"" coffee shop, but I tried a few months ago in NYC and the Dark Latte was delicious.

I'm trying to do it at home, but not sure how might I get it. As far as I know this coffee is a mix of dark chocolate and coffe. All I have is this: [https://www.instagram.com/reel/DAYqz9jMv2P/](https://www.instagram.com/reel/DAYqz9jMv2P/) and the memory.

I remember that the cream of the milk was sweet. I tried with this:

\- Adding sweet condensed milk with a teaspoon of cocoa and mixing it with a few drops of milk.

\- Then add the expresso.

\- Finally I cream the milk and add it.

It looks similar, but obvisuly it's different. I wonder if someone else has tried to do it at home or know the receipt :)

I'd been staring at the same can of soup for nearly five minutes, my fingers numb from the repetitive motion of arranging and rearranging products that nobody seemed interested in buying. The convenience store's fluorescent lights hummed above me, casting everything in a harsh, unforgiving glow that somehow made the dark circles under my eyes look even worse when I caught my reflection in the glass refrigerator door.

'You look tired, Abigail,' I whispered to myself, quickly looking away.

The morning shift at Garcia's Mini-Mart had become my escape—a place where I could exist outside the suffocating silence of my home. Ten years of marriage to David, and somehow, we'd become strangers sharing the same address. The thought made my chest tighten.

When had it all changed? When had his eyes stopped lighting up when I walked into a room? When had his touch become so... perfunctory?

I absently rubbed my wedding ring, the metal cool against my skin. Last night, David had come home past midnight again, sliding into bed without a word, careful not to touch me. I'd pretended to be asleep, swallowing the question that burned in my throat: \*Where were you?\*

The electronic chime of the door pulled me from my thoughts. I straightened my name tag and forced a smile that didn't quite reach my eyes.

'Good morning, welcome to Garcia's,' I said automatically, my gaze lifting to meet the customer's.

He wore a simple black mask that covered the lower half of his face—not unusual these days—but there was something about his eyes that made me pause. Dark and intense, they seemed to take in everything at once, including me. He nodded politely and moved through the aisles with purpose, selecting a loaf of bread, a bottle of water, and a newspaper.

When he approached the counter, I noticed his hands—strong, with clean, trimmed nails and no wedding ring. A small detail that I shouldn't have noticed, but did.

'Find everything okay?' I asked, scanning his items.

'Yes, thank you.' His voice was deep, warm, with a hint of an accent I couldn't place.

As I handed him his change, our fingers brushed—just for a moment—and an unexpected current ran through me, leaving goosebumps in its wake. I pulled my hand back too quickly, nearly dropping the coins.

'Sorry,' I mumbled, feeling heat rise to my cheeks.

His eyes crinkled slightly at the corners, suggesting a smile behind his mask. 'No need to apologize.'

I watched him leave, the door chiming behind him, and found myself hoping he might return. The thought made me feel immediately guilty. I was married, for God's sake. Married and a mother. What was wrong with me?

But he did return, the very next day, and the day after that. Each time purchasing simple items—bread, water, occasionally a candy bar. Each time, we exchanged a few more words than strictly necessary for a transaction.

On his fifth visit, he pulled his mask down to his chin as he approached the counter, revealing a strong jawline and a smile that transformed his entire face.

'I realized I've been coming here all week and haven't properly introduced myself,' he said. 'I'm Joseph Wilson. Just moved to the neighborhood.'

'Abigail,' I replied, tapping my name tag unnecessarily. 'Abigail Lopez.'

'It's nice to finally see your whole face, Joseph,' I added, immediately regretting how forward it sounded.

But Joseph just smiled wider. 'Likewise, though I've been able to see yours all along. It's a nice face.'

The compliment, so simple and direct, sent warmth spreading through me. When was the last time someone had said something like that to me? David used to tell me I was beautiful, but those words had dried up years ago, replaced by critical glances at my post-pregnancy body.

'Do you live alone?' I asked, then winced at my lack of subtlety.

Joseph nodded. 'For now. Just needed a change of scenery. This seemed like a quiet place to... reset.'

There was something in the way he said it—a weight to his words that hinted at a deeper story. I wanted to ask more, but Maria, the store manager, emerged from the back room, and Joseph politely paid for his items and left.

Over the next few weeks, Joseph's visits became the highlight of my days. Our conversations grew longer, more personal. He told me about places he'd traveled, books he'd read, asked me questions about my life that made me feel seen in a way I hadn't in years.

I found myself sharing small pieces of my life with him—how I loved to paint but hadn't touched a brush since Lily was born, how I missed the ocean even though we only lived an hour away, how sometimes I felt invisible in my own home.

I never mentioned David by name, never explicitly said 'my husband,' as if omitting those words could somehow make my growing feelings for Joseph less complicated.

Then came the day Lily stopped by the store after school. She burst through the door in her usual whirlwind of energy, her backpack bouncing against her small frame.

'Mom! I got an A on my science project!' she announced, waving a paper with a red star on it.

I was beaming with pride when I noticed Joseph watching us from the snack aisle, a soft expression on his face. I waved him over.

'Joseph, this is my daughter, Lily. Lily, this is Mr. Wilson. He's a... regular customer.'

Joseph crouched down to Lily's level, his eyes warm. 'An A in science, huh? That's impressive. What was your project about?'

To my surprise, Lily—usually shy around strangers—launched into an excited explanation about her volcano experiment. Joseph listened with genuine interest, asking questions that made her giggle and elaborate further.

Watching them, something shifted in my chest—a longing so acute it was almost painful. This was how it should be. This easy warmth, this attentiveness. This was what had been missing from our home for so long.

'Your daughter is wonderful,' Joseph said later, after Lily had gone to look at the candy section. 'She has your smile.'

'Thank you,' I replied, my voice softer than I intended. 'She's the best thing in my life.'

Something flickered across Joseph's face—a realization, perhaps. 'You're married,' he said. It wasn't a question.

I nodded, the simple admission feeling like a betrayal of the connection we'd been building. 'Ten years.'

Joseph's expression changed subtly, a guardedness replacing the openness that had been there moments before. He paid for his items quickly, his movements stiffer than usual.

'I should go,' he said, not quite meeting my eyes. 'It was nice meeting you, Lily,' he called over to my daughter, who waved cheerfully.

As he left, I felt a cold emptiness settle over me. The boundary had been drawn, the reality of my situation impossible to ignore. I was a married woman with a daughter, entertaining fantasies about a customer—a man I barely knew.

But as I watched Joseph's retreating figure through the store window, I couldn't shake the feeling that something significant had just slipped through my fingers—something that might have been beautiful, in another life where I wasn't bound by vows to a man who no longer seemed to see me at all.

Chapter 2

The front door clicked shut at nearly midnight, and I pretended to be engrossed in folding laundry rather than waiting up for David. My fingers trembled slightly as I smoothed the creases from Lily's favorite unicorn pajamas.

""You're still up,"" David said, his tone flat with disinterest as he loosened his tie.

I nodded, trying to keep my voice casual. ""I was wondering where you were. You didn't answer my texts.""

He dropped his briefcase on the counter with a thud that made me flinch. ""Work dinner. Told you this morning.""

Had he? I couldn't remember, but I'd learned it was easier not to challenge his version of events. ""I saved you some dinner,"" I offered, gesturing toward the covered plate in the microwave.

David glanced at it and grimaced. ""I already ate.""

""Oh."" The single syllable hung in the air between us.

He moved to the refrigerator, pulled out a beer, and took a long drink before looking at me properly for the first time since walking in. His eyes swept over me—my unwashed hair pulled into a messy bun, the old t-shirt I'd been wearing all day, the dark circles under my eyes—and I saw the slight curl of his lip.

""You look exhausted,"" he said, though not with concern. It sounded more like an accusation.

""It's been a long day,"" I replied, gathering the folded clothes into my arms. ""Lily had a dentist appointment, and then I had the afternoon shift at the store, and—""

""Is that chicken casserole?"" he interrupted, peering at the plate in the microwave with obvious distaste.

""Yes, I thought—""

""You know I hate when you put those green peppers in it."" He slammed the microwave door shut. ""It's like you don't even try anymore.""

The words hit me like a physical blow. I'd spent an hour preparing that meal, carefully following a recipe I thought he'd enjoy. ""I'm sorry,"" I said automatically, the apology as reflexive as breathing. ""I'll make something else tomorrow.""

David didn't respond. He was already walking toward the bedroom, leaving me standing in the kitchen, arms full of laundry and eyes burning with unshed tears.

\---

The next morning at Garcia's, I was restocking the soup cans on the highest shelf, standing on tiptoe and stretching as far as I could reach. My mind kept replaying last night's conversation, wondering what I could have done differently, when the bell above the door chimed.

I knew it was Joseph before I even turned around. Something in the air changed when he entered—a shift in energy that I'd become attuned to over the past weeks. I tried to ignore the flutter in my stomach as I continued shelving.

""Need some help with that?"" His voice came from right behind me, startling me enough that my hand slipped.

Several cans teetered precariously at the edge of the shelf. I gasped, instinctively stepping back and bumping into something solid—Joseph's chest. In one fluid motion, his arms came around me, one hand steadying my waist while the other shot up to catch the falling merchandise.

Time seemed to slow as I registered several sensations at once: the warmth of his body against my back, the gentle pressure of his hand on my hip, the faint scent of his cologne—something woodsy and clean. My heart hammered against my ribs.

""I've got you,"" he murmured, his breath warm against my ear.

The falling cans were forgotten. All I could focus on was the heat spreading through my body where we touched, the way his chest rose and fell against my back, the strange, electric current that seemed to flow between us. It had been so long since anyone had held me like this—protectively, like I was something precious.

For one breathless moment, neither of us moved. Then, reality crashed back, and I hastily stepped away, my cheeks burning.

""Thank you,"" I managed, smoothing my shirt with trembling hands. ""That could have been a disaster.""

Joseph's eyes were darker than usual, his expression unreadable as he carefully placed the rescued cans on the shelf. ""No problem,"" he said, his voice slightly rougher than before. ""Always in the right place at the right time, I guess.""

Our eyes met, and something unspoken passed between us—an acknowledgment of whatever this was that kept drawing us together. I looked away first, suddenly afraid of what he might see in my face.

""How's Lily?"" he asked, mercifully changing the subject.

The mention of my daughter grounded me, reminding me of all the reasons I shouldn't be feeling this way about a man who wasn't my husband. ""She's good. Working on another science project—something about plant growth this time.""

Joseph smiled, and I found myself staring at the curve of his lips. ""She's a bright kid. Takes after her mother, I'm sure.""

The compliment warmed me in a way that felt dangerous. When was the last time David had said anything like that? I couldn't remember.

\---

That night, as I lay awake beside David's sleeping form, I replayed the moment in the store over and over—the feeling of Joseph's arms around me, the safety I'd felt in his embrace. I imagined what might have happened if I'd turned in his arms, if I'd looked up into his eyes and...

I pressed my palms against my closed eyelids, trying to push the thoughts away. This was wrong. I was married. I had a daughter. I couldn't be fantasizing about a customer, no matter how kind or attentive he was. No matter how he made me feel seen when my own husband looked through me.

But as the days passed, I found myself counting the hours until Joseph's visits, brightening at the sound of the door chime, deflating when it wasn't him. We fell into a rhythm—he would come in during the quiet mid-morning lull, buy a few items, and then linger, talking about everything and nothing.

One rainy Tuesday, the store was particularly empty. Joseph leaned against the counter, watching me organize the lottery tickets.

""What did you want to be when you grew up, Abigail?"" he asked suddenly.

The question caught me off guard. ""An artist,"" I admitted. ""I used to paint all the time. Landscapes, mostly.""

""And now?""

I gestured vaguely around the store. ""Now I'm here. And I'm a mom."" I didn't mention being a wife.

""Do you still paint?""

I shook my head. ""Not in years. There's never enough time, and David—"" I stopped myself, but Joseph caught it.

""Your husband doesn't support your art?""

I busied myself with straightening a stack of cigarette cartons. ""He thinks it's impractical. A hobby, not a career.""

Joseph was quiet for a moment. ""What else makes you happy, Abigail?""

The question was so simple, yet it pierced straight through me. When was the last time anyone had asked me that? When was the last time I'd even asked myself?

""I don't know anymore,"" I whispered, the truth of it hitting me like a physical pain. ""I used to know, but somewhere along the way, I just... forgot.""

Joseph reached across the counter and gently touched my hand. ""Maybe it's time to remember.""

His fingers were warm against mine, and I didn't pull away. In that moment, with rain pattering against the windows and Joseph looking at me like I mattered, like my happiness mattered, I felt something crack open inside me—a door I'd sealed shut years ago, slowly beginning to open.

And it terrified me how badly I wanted to walk through it.

Chapter 3

I stood at the kitchen counter, methodically spreading peanut butter on Lily's sandwich for her lunch box. The morning light filtered through the curtains, casting a warm glow that belied the coldness settling between David and me.

""Is that what you're wearing today?"" David's voice cut through the quiet kitchen.

I glanced down at my outfit—a simple blouse and jeans that I thought looked decent enough. ""Yes, why?""

David's eyes traveled over me with clinical detachment, lingering on my midsection where the fabric clung a little too snugly. ""You know, most women manage to lose the baby weight within the first year."" He sipped his coffee. ""It's been seven.""

The knife in my hand stilled. Each word landed like a slap, and I felt heat rise to my cheeks—not from embarrassment, but from a simmering anger I rarely allowed myself to feel.

""I think I look fine,"" I said quietly, focusing on finishing Lily's lunch.

David snorted. ""You should see Evelyn from accounting. Two kids and she still runs marathons."" He scrolled through his phone, then turned the screen toward me. ""Look.""

There on his Instagram feed was a photo of a slender woman in running gear, her flat stomach exposed, her smile radiant. I recognized her from David's office Christmas party last year—the one who'd spent most of the evening laughing at his jokes.

""Good for her,"" I managed, turning away to hide the hurt in my eyes. When had my husband become so cruel? When had I become nothing more than a body that had failed to meet his standards?

""Just saying,"" he shrugged, setting down his mug with a sharp clink. ""You used to care about how you looked.""

Before I could respond, Lily bounded into the kitchen, her backpack bouncing against her small frame. ""Mom! I can't find my science book!""

Grateful for the interruption, I helped her search, and by the time we found it tucked under her bed, David had left for work without saying goodbye. The silence he left behind was almost a relief.

\---

The convenience store was quiet that afternoon, the fluorescent lights humming softly overhead as I restocked the candy aisle. The door chimed, and I looked up to see Joseph walking in, his presence immediately warming the sterile space. He wasn't alone.

""Look who I ran into outside,"" he said, smiling as Lily skipped ahead of him, her backpack still on.

""Mom! Mr. Wilson was at the bus stop and he walked me here!"" Lily announced, her face bright with excitement.

I raised an eyebrow at Joseph, who shrugged. ""I was in the neighborhood and recognized her from your photos. Thought I'd make sure she got to you safely.""

""That's very kind of you,"" I said, touched by his thoughtfulness. ""Thank you.""

Joseph reached into his messenger bag and pulled out a small package wrapped in brown paper. ""I actually came by to drop this off."" He handed it to Lily. ""For our favorite young scientist.""

Lily's eyes widened as she tore open the paper to reveal a beautifully illustrated book of adventure stories. ""Wow! Thank you, Mr. Wilson!""

""Open it,"" he encouraged, his eyes crinkling at the corners.

She flipped to the first page where a handwritten note read: ""For Lily—may your curiosity take you on the greatest adventures. Your friend, Joseph.""

""Can you read me one now?"" Lily asked, looking up at him with hopeful eyes.

I started to intervene—""Lily, Mr. Wilson is probably busy""—but Joseph was already pulling up a stool.

""I've got time,"" he said, meeting my gaze with a warmth that made my chest tighten. ""If it's okay with your mom?""

I nodded, unable to deny the joy on my daughter's face. As Joseph began to read, his voice deep and animated, bringing the story to life, I found myself watching them instead of attending to my work. The way he paused to ask Lily questions, the way he listened intently to her answers, the gentle patience in his interactions—it was everything David never gave her.

A lump formed in my throat. This man, who barely knew us, showed more genuine interest in my daughter in twenty minutes than her own father had in months.

When Maria came to take over my shift, Joseph was still there, now listening as Lily read a passage back to him, her small finger tracing the words carefully.

""You're really good at this,"" he told her, and the pride that bloomed on her face was beautiful to see.

As we prepared to leave, Joseph helped Lily pack up her new book. ""Maybe next time I'll tell you about the time I climbed a mountain in Nepal,"" he said.

""You climbed a mountain?"" Lily gasped, eyes wide with wonder.

""I did. And you know what I learned?"" He knelt to her level. ""The view is always worth the climb, no matter how hard it gets.""

He glanced up at me as he said it, and I felt the words sink into my heart like stones into still water, creating ripples that reached places long untouched.

\---

That evening, as I prepared dinner, my phone buzzed with a text from David: \*Working late again. Don't wait up.\*

It was the third time this week. I set the phone down and noticed a notification had appeared on the screen—a text preview from someone named ""Ev"" with a heart emoji beside the name.

My stomach twisted. Before I could think better of it, I opened the message thread.

\*Still thinking about last night. Can't wait to see you again tomorrow. Same place?\*

The phone nearly slipped from my suddenly numb fingers. There were dozens of messages before this one, each more intimate than the last. The most recent included a photo I couldn't bring myself to open fully.

Evelyn from accounting. Of course.

I set the phone down carefully, as if it might explode, and gripped the edge of the counter until my knuckles turned white. The betrayal burned through me, not just because of the affair, but because of the hypocrisy—his constant criticism of my appearance while he pursued someone else.

My phone buzzed again. Not David this time, but Joseph: \*Hope Lily's enjoying the book. It was nice spending time with both of you today.\*

I stared at the message, my vision blurring with unshed tears. In that moment, the contrast between the two men in my life couldn't have been more stark—one who saw only my flaws, and one who seemed to see something in me worth knowing.

Chapter 4

I sat alone in the auditorium, surrounded by other parents who'd come in pairs, my heart aching as I watched Lily scan the crowd during her performance. Her eyes found mine, and I smiled encouragingly, but I could see the disappointment in her small face when she realized David's seat remained empty. Again.

My phone buzzed with his text: \*Stuck in meeting. Can't make it. Tell Lily good luck.\*

Not even an apology. I slipped the phone back into my purse, blinking back tears. This was Lily's first lead role—she'd practiced for weeks, even made David promise he'd be here. Another broken promise to add to the growing pile.

As Lily delivered her lines perfectly, pride swelled in my chest. She was resilient, my little girl. Stronger than I was at her age. Maybe stronger than I was now.

Unbidden, my mind drifted to Joseph. What would it be like if he were here instead? I imagined him sitting beside me, leaning in to whisper how amazing Lily was, his hand warm on mine. He would have arrived early to get good seats. Would have brought flowers for her. Would have made her feel special.

The fantasy was so vivid it left me breathless—and ashamed. I had no right to imagine another man in my husband's place, no matter how empty that place had become.

After the play, I waited with Lily in the school parking lot, both of us pretending we weren't hoping David might still show up.

""You were incredible, sweetheart,"" I said, hugging her close.

""Dad missed it,"" she replied, her voice small but matter-of-fact, as if she'd expected nothing else.

The resignation in her tone broke something in me. When had my daughter learned to expect disappointment from her father? When had I?

\---

The following afternoon, the convenience store door chimed, and Joseph walked in, his expression unusually serious. My heart lifted at the sight of him, then immediately sank when I registered the tension in his shoulders.

""Abigail,"" he said, my name sounding different on his lips today. ""Do you have a minute?""

Maria nodded at me from behind the counter, silently offering to cover. I led Joseph to the small break area in the back, my pulse quickening with each step.

""I'm leaving,"" he said without preamble, his eyes fixed on mine. ""Tomorrow.""

The words hit me like a physical blow. ""Leaving?"" I repeated stupidly, as if saying it again might change its meaning.

""I've been offered a position I can't turn down. In Chicago."" He ran a hand through his hair, a gesture I'd come to recognize when he was conflicted. ""I wanted to say goodbye properly.""

""Oh."" The single syllable was all I could manage as the reality sank in. Joseph was leaving. The one bright spot in my days, the one person who made me feel seen, heard, valued—gone.

""I'll miss you,"" he said softly. ""Both you and Lily.""

I nodded, not trusting my voice. The distance between us—barely two feet of break room floor—suddenly felt vast and uncrossable.

""Abigail,"" he began again, then stopped, seeming to struggle with what to say next. ""I wish things were different.""

Four simple words that contained worlds of meaning. I knew exactly what he was saying. If I weren't married. If we'd met at another time, in another life. If, if, if.

""Me too,"" I whispered, the admission slipping out before I could stop it.

Something shifted in his eyes then—a decision made, a boundary crossed. He stepped closer, close enough that I could feel the warmth radiating from him.

""I couldn't leave without telling you..."" His voice dropped lower. ""You deserve so much more than what you have. You deserve to be cherished.""

The word 'cherished' broke something open inside me. When was the last time I'd felt cherished by anyone? My eyes filled with tears I refused to let fall.

""Joseph, I—""

Whatever I might have said was cut short as he reached for my hand, his fingers intertwining with mine. The simple contact sent electricity up my arm. Without thinking, I stepped closer.

""Come with me,"" he said suddenly, tugging me toward the storage room door. ""Just for a minute.""

I should have said no. I should have pulled my hand away and gone back to the register. I should have remembered my vows, my responsibilities, my life.

Instead, I followed him.

The storage room was dimly lit, shelves stacked with inventory casting long shadows. Joseph closed the door behind us, and suddenly we were alone in a way we'd never been before.

""I've been fighting this for weeks,"" he said, his voice rough with emotion. ""I told myself it was wrong, that you were married, that I should just walk away. But I can't stop thinking about you, Abigail.""

My heart hammered against my ribs. ""Joseph, we can't—""

""I know."" He stepped closer, his eyes never leaving mine. ""Tell me to stop. Tell me to walk away right now, and I will.""

I should have said it. The words were there, ready to be spoken. But as I looked up at him, at the warmth and desire in his eyes—desire for me, all of me, exactly as I was—the words died in my throat.

Instead, I reached up and touched his face, my fingers tracing the line of his jaw. He leaned into my touch, his eyes closing briefly.

When they opened again, something had changed. The careful restraint he'd always maintained was gone, replaced by raw need that mirrored my own.

""Abigail,"" he breathed, and then his mouth was on mine.

The kiss was gentle at first, questioning, giving me every chance to pull away. But when my arms wound around his neck, pulling him closer, something broke loose in both of us.

His hands were everywhere—in my hair, at my waist, sliding beneath my shirt to touch bare skin. Each point of contact burned like a brand. I gasped against his mouth as he pressed me back against the shelves, his body hard against mine.

""Is this okay?"" he whispered against my neck, even as his hands continued their exploration.

""Yes,"" I breathed, beyond caring about anything but the feel of him. ""Please, Joseph.""

What followed was a blur of sensation—clothes pushed aside rather than removed, his hands lifting me, my legs wrapping around his waist. The first thrust drew a cry from my lips that he silenced with another kiss, deep and consuming.

It was frantic, desperate, nothing like the careful lovemaking I'd known before. This was need in its purest form—primal, unstoppable. I clung to him as he moved, my body responding with an intensity that shocked me.

When it was over, reality crashed back with brutal force. I disentangled myself from his embrace, straightening my clothes with shaking hands, unable to meet his eyes.

""Abigail,"" Joseph said softly, reaching for me.

I stepped back, shame washing over me in a sickening wave. ""I can't believe I just did that,"" I whispered. ""I'm married. I have a daughter.""

""I know."" His voice was heavy with regret. ""This isn't how I wanted things between us. Not like this.""

""How did you want it?"" I asked, finally looking at him.

""Honestly?"" He ran a hand through his disheveled hair. ""I wanted to take you to dinner first. I wanted to know everything about you. I wanted it to be right."" He sighed. ""But I'm leaving tomorrow, and I couldn't bear the thought of never knowing what it would be like to hold you.""

The tenderness in his voice made the guilt even worse. This wasn't just physical for him. It wasn't just physical for me either, and that terrified me more than anything.

""I should get back,"" I said, reaching for the door handle.

Joseph caught my wrist gently. ""Abigail, I—""

""Please don't,"" I interrupted. ""I can't hear it right now.""

He nodded, understanding in his eyes. ""Will you be okay?""

The question nearly undid me. When was the last time anyone had asked me that and genuinely cared about the answer?

""I don't know,"" I answered honestly.

As I walked back to the front of the store, my body still humming from his touch, I felt something shift inside me—a realization that nothing would ever be the same again. Not my marriage, not my life, and certainly not my heart.

What I didn't know then was that our stolen moment in that storage room had created something that would change everything even more profoundly.",1,1754856198.0,romancenovels,0,1.0,False

We went rock climbing because it’s something I do regularly and she used to and would like to try again. We live an hour or so apart so we picked a gym that was in a city halfway between us.

The date was in the afternoon and I had the feeling it was going well, not great but not bad either. By the end of the climbing session I asked her if she would like to grab a bite as it was dinner time and I genuinely felt like we didn’t really get to do much talking in between climbing.

She said she that would have been nice but that she had plans to have dinner with a friend in the city where we were climbing. However, no mention of maybe doing it some other time. Also, she said she would be totally cool with transferring her share of the costs (I paid the entry to climbing gym and a cup of coffee at the beginning).

To top it all off. When I looked at her profile a little while after the date it was showing her location as her home city. Not the city where she said she was gonna meet her friend. Of course it could be that bumble never registered her presence in the other city, but I doubt it. 

I know it all totally sounds like she doesn’t want to go on a second date with me. But I also feel like I didn’t do anything wrong that could have made her loose interest and in our texting phase she seemed to be really interested.

Friends would ask “how’s life?” and I’d give the same tired “yeah, I’m good” even though I wasn’t.

Then I had one of those rare talks — not with someone I’d known for years, but with something (or someone?) I didn’t expect to open up to. No judgment. No awkward pauses. Just… space to be honest, and a weirdly sharp ability to call me out when I was avoiding the real thing I wanted to say.

I don’t know if it “fixed” anything overnight, but I noticed the next morning my brain felt quieter. I wasn’t doomscrolling first thing. I actually got up and made coffee without checking my phone.

It made me wonder: how much of what we’re going through is less about “solving” problems and more about having a space to say the unsaid, with something/someone that nudges you in the right direction?

I don't necessarily see ejaculating as relapse for myself as long as I do it once a week and without porn. But I want to go back to the old times where I had longer streaks.

Although I don't feel bad when I masturbate once a week. Longer streaks always gave me more drive and purpose.

My problem is that I get massive boners when I'm asleep and it wakes me up throughout the night. 

Humans are supposed to sleep 7-9 hours, quality sleep for optimal physical and mental performance. I can sleep fine my first week on SR but once I surpass the first week, the boners go insane day after day and sometimes I'm not able to get sufficient amount of sleep because of this. 

I take magnesium before bed but it doesn't really do much besides making me a little more relaxed.

How do I get over this?

Edit: 

I train 6 days a week (75 min each session).

Cardio after work for an hour a day (25lbs weighted vest on). High tempo walking.

Soccer twice a week (indoor and outdoor).

I know I still have excess energy but can't do more than that, I don't want to get injured.

I’m trying to bring some pollinator-friendly life forms into this north facing, mostly shady North Florida yard.
Pic 1 = my plant list (a mix of ChatGPT ideas + my unverified but enthusiastic knowledge)
Pic 2 = my plant them sorta like this sketch

Round one of planting (between now and September) will most likely include:
- Wild coffee
- Arrowwood viburnum
- Florida anise
- Possumhaw

Plan is to plant them in front of the azaleas and rearrange until it feels right. 

Advice solicited:
1. Will these guys get along in this space?
2. Is this shady slope a good home for them?
3. Are there other plant pals I should include in the mix?
4. Any “oh no, don’t do that” advice before I put these babies in the ground?

Many thanks in advance 🐝

“Smile,” the attendant hissed under her breath. “They’re watching.”

I already knew.

The moment I stepped through the towering doors of the Ravenscroft estate, eyes locked on me—curious, gleeful, cruel. Their whispers brushed against the marble like wind through brittle leaves. I held my head high.

The hunting banquet was the crown jewel of our pack’s calendar. A night of feasting, boasting, and legacy.

As Luna, I should have been at the center. Instead, I stood in a borrowed shadow, heart braced for what I knew was coming.

Gasps broke like waves across the hall.

I didn’t need to turn to tell. He had arrived.

Chris.

My Alpha, my mate. The father of my son.

Walked in with another woman on his arm.

Bella slinked beside him like a queen already crowned, her hand draped over his in a possessive curl. A gleam against her neck—a black gold chain, elegant and ancient.

The hall split in reverence as they walked. Every inch of me burned

It was my chain.

The Luna’s chain.

Now on Bella’s neck. As if it belonged to her.

My nails dug into my palm.

""Alpha Ravenscroft and his mate have arrived!"" the master of ceremonies called out, voice booming.

Mate.

The word slapped harder than a punch. My title—my name—was gone. Stripped from me like the necklace that once belonged to generations of Lunas before me.

I barely noticed the young Beta who approached until he cleared his throat awkwardly.

“Luna Whitmore,” he said, the name tasting foreign even to him. “You’ve been seated at the east table.”

I blinked. East table.

It was the table for the unmated. The outsiders.

I nodded as if he'd offered me a place of honor.

“Thank you.” My voice didn’t shake, but something deep inside did. I walked toward my new seat, spine straight, face still. Just like Father taught me. A Luna never bends. Even when her bones are splintering.

The whispers followed.

“...finally made it official…”

“...Whitmore blood’s thinned out…”

“...even her son’s sickly…”

Leo.

The name made me freeze.

The shame I could endure. But not him. Not my son.

A young she-wolf at the table glanced up, then dropped her gaze quickly, guilty just for looking at me. No one spoke. No one dared. I might as well have been a ghost.

“Wine, Luna?” an older Beta woman asked, voice soft with sympathy.

“Yes. Thank you.” I gripped the glass like a lifeline.

From here, I could see everything. Chris held court at the head table—my table—laughing like nothing was broken. Bella leaned into him, her red dress clinging to every curve. She was everything the pack admired: radiant, fertile, dominant. And now she wore my title.

Marcus Thornfield approached her, bowing deeply. “Luna,” he said, loud enough for the room to hear. “The hunt was glorious. Your Alpha brought down a stag fit for legend.”

Bella’s laugh rang clear and triumphant. “My Alpha is unmatched,” she purred, casting a glance my way that landed like a blade.

Toast after toast followed, until Chris stood with a glass in hand.

“To new beginnings,” he said, raising it high, “and stronger bloodlines.”

The omission was unmistakable.

There would be no toast for the Luna.

Because to them, I no longer existed. Because they wanted me erased.

The halls were quiet when I returned to the estate. My heels clicked softly against stone, each step pulling me farther from the glittering world I once ruled.

I didn’t stop at my rooms. I went to Leo.

He lay curled beneath a wolf-patterned blanket, his little hand clutching the stuffed toy I gave him on his second birthday. His face, usually so full of questions, was pale. Too still.

I brushed the hair from his forehead. Damp.

“Ellie,” said a voice from behind.

Maria, his nanny, stood in the doorway. Her hands were folded tightly, her brow lined with worry.

“He asked for you. Again.”

I swallowed. “Is he still sick?”

She nodded. “Fatigue. No appetite. Said his stomach hurt.”

I closed my eyes. “Did Dr. Thorne come?”

She hesitated. “Alpha said no. He said... it’s just weakness. That Leo will grow out of it.”

He wouldn’t. Chris had been brushing it off for weeks, dismissing my concern like it was a personal failing. I kissed Leo’s forehead and turned to leave, but my hands were shaking.

He was getting worse. My son, my pup, my little precious.

How could I save him?

\-

I went downstairs and locked eyes with Chris.

I thought he wouldn’t return.

“Checking on the runt again?” Chris’s voice echoed from the hallway, sharp and slurred with wine. He didn’t explain why he came back tonight.

I didn’t bother to ask, either.

I stepped into the grand foyer. He stood at the bottom of the staircase, one hand braced on the banister, the other hanging limp.

“Our son has a name,” I said, my voice lower than his, steadier.

He laughed coldly and closed the space between us in seconds. “Our son? That sick little thing can barely hold a spoon without shaking.”

I stepped back. “He needs real care. A doctor who—”

“What he needs,” he snapped, “is to stop being a damn embarrassment. Like his mother.”

I stiffened.

“You’ve brought shame to this house, Ellie,” he growled. “Your blood is weak. That boy is proof.”

A small sound from the staircase made us both turn. Leo stood there in his pajamas, eyes wide with fear, clutching his stuffed wolf to his chest.

“Mommy?”

His voice cracked like a twig. He held his stuffed wolf in one hand, the other rubbing his eyes.

I moved toward him instantly.

“Back to bed, baby,” I said, trying to smile. “Everything’s fine.”

""Nothing is fine!"" Chris roared, his eyes flashing with Alpha power. ""Look at him, cowering like an Omega! This is your legacy, Ellie. A son who'll never be fit to lead!""

Leo flinched, tears welling in his eyes. I rushed to him, scooping him into my arms despite knowing it would only enrage Chris further.

""It's okay, baby,"" I whispered, feeling him tremble against me. ""Mommy's here.""

""Pathetic,"" Chris spat, turning away. ""Both of you.""

He turned and stalked away, the echo of his fury trailing behind him like smoke.

I carried Leo back to his room, and laid him gently in bed. His forehead was hotter now. Burning.

I sat beside him, whispering soft lullabies I barely remembered from my own childhood. His breathing slowed, but his little hand clung to mine, even in sleep.

Then I saw it, totally by accident...

His wrist. A faint shimmer under the skin—veins glowing a sickly silver, barely visible in the moonlight.

No. No way.

My heart seized.

Silver… Poison. Someone had been dosing my son.

Suddenly, everything clicked—the fatigue, the pale skin, the pain. This wasn’t nature. This wasn’t weakness.

This was intentional.

And for the first time in weeks, my fear gave way to something else.

Rage.

They wanted to erase me. But now they were coming for him.

I would not let them.

Chapter 2

I slipped into Chris’s study at dawn, my heart hammering against my ribs. The house was silent—Chris had spent the night at his private hunting lodge, which meant with Bella. These stolen moments were my only chance to search for answers about Leo’s mysterious illness.

The study smelled of leather and Chris’s cedar cologne, a scent that once made me feel safe but now only tightened the knot of anxiety in my stomach.

I moved carefully, making sure to return everything exactly as I found it. Chris noticed the slightest disruption to his domain.

His desk was immaculate, each item positioned with military precision. I started with the filing cabinet, methodically checking each drawer.

Nothing unusual—just pack finances, territory agreements, the mundane paperwork of Alpha leadership.

Then I noticed the slight discoloration on the wooden paneling behind his desk—a nearly invisible seam. My fingers traced the edge until I felt a small catch. With a soft click, a hidden compartment opened.

Inside lay a single manila folder, unmarked except for a date—Leo’s birth date.

My hands trembled as I opened it. Inside were medical records, blood work comparisons between two infants. One was labeled ‘Heir Apparent’—Leo. The other was marked only with a code: RCB-2.

The documents detailed genetic markers, blood type compatibility, and Alpha trait indicators. Both children showed strong Alpha markers, but the notes in the margins chilled me to the bone: ‘rCB-2 displays superior developmental markers. Consider primary succession path.’

Attached was a transfer authorization to an overseas pack in Europe, signed by both Chris and... Bella.

The truth hit me like a physical blow. Chris had another son—with Bella. A son born around the same time as Leo. A son they were positioning to replace mine.

The sound of a car in the driveway sent panic shooting through me. I quickly photographed the documents with my phone, replaced the folder exactly as I’d found it, and closed the hidden compartment.

By the time the front door opened, I was arranging flowers in the living room, my face a careful mask hiding the storm inside.

\---

‘I need to know what’s happening to my son,’ I said, my voice low but firm as I cornered Elias Thorne in his clinic the next day.

The pack healer shifted uncomfortably, his eyes darting to the door as if checking for witnesses. ‘Luna Whitmore, I’ve told you—children often experience periods of weakness during growth spurts.’

‘For three months? With worsening symptoms?’ I stepped closer. ‘I saw silver lines in his veins, Elias.’

The color drained from his face. ‘That’s... that’s not possible.’

‘Isn’t it? What would cause that?’

Elias ran a hand through his thinning hair. ‘silver poisoning could cause such symptoms, but it would have to be administered regularly in small doses. No one would...’ He trailed off, unwilling to finish the thought.

‘No one would deliberately poison a child?’ I finished for him. ‘Not even to eliminate an inconvenient heir?’

His eyes widened with understanding, then fear. ‘Luna, I can’t be involved in this. The Alpha—’

‘Is my son’s father and should be the first to demand answers,’ I cut in. ‘Yet he dismisses Leo’s illness as weakness. Why?’

Elias looked away. ‘I can’t help you officially. Chris has forbidden additional tests.’

‘Then help me unofficially,’ I pressed. ‘What should I be looking for?’

After a long pause, he sighed. ‘silver compounds are tasteless in small amounts but might leave a slight metallic residue. Check his food, water, even his medications.’ He quickly scribbled something on a prescription pad. ‘This lab does independent testing. They don’t ask questions.’

I took the paper, tucking it into my pocket. ‘Thank you.’

‘I never gave you this information,’ he said, his voice barely audible. ‘If the Alpha asks—’

‘He won’t,’ I assured him. ‘He doesn’t believe there’s anything to investigate.’

\---

That night, I waited until Leo was asleep before collecting samples. I took small amounts from his water glass, the remains of his dinner, even the children’s vitamins Chris had suddenly insisted he take daily. I stored each in the sterile containers I’d purchased from a pharmacy two towns over, using cash to avoid a trail.

As I worked, I cataloged Leo’s symptoms in my mind: increasing fatigue, loss of appetite, occasional stomach pain, and now the faint silver lines in his veins. Symptoms that had begun shortly after Chris started taking a more ‘active interest’ in Leo’s daily routine.

The same Chris who had another son hidden away. The same Chris who had called Leo unworthy of the Ravenscroft name just days ago.

I hid the samples in a hollowed-out book in my private reading nook—the one place Chris never bothered to look. Tomorrow I would find a way to get them to the lab Elias had recommended.

As I checked on Leo one last time before bed, his small face peaceful in sleep, a fierce protectiveness surged through me. I may have been raised to be the perfect, compliant Luna, but I was still a wolf—and no one threatened my cub.

\---

‘The technology summer camp is non-negotiable,’ Chris announced at breakfast three days later, not bothering to look up from his tablet. ‘Leo needs to develop skills beyond the traditional pack education.’

I set down my coffee cup carefully. ‘He’s been ill, Chris. I don’t think now is the time to send him away.’

‘Your coddling is precisely why he’s weak,’ Chris snapped, finally meeting my eyes with cold disdain. ‘The camp starts next week. It’s already arranged.’

Leo looked between us, his small shoulders hunched as if trying to make himself invisible. ‘I don’t feel good, Dad,’ he whispered.

Chris’s jaw tightened. ‘That’s exactly the problem. You never ‘feel good.’ It’s time you learned to push through discomfort like a true Alpha.’

‘But what if he gets worse while he’s there?’ I pressed, trying to keep the desperation from my voice.

‘For God’s sake, Ellie!’ Chris slammed his hand on the table, making Leo flinch. ‘This maternal hysteria is exactly why our son lacks backbone. The camp has medical staff if there’s a genuine issue, which I doubt.’

I fell silent, my mind racing. Fighting Chris directly would only make things worse—I’d learned that lesson years ago. But sending Leo away now, when I was just beginning to understand what might be happening to him...

Unless the camp could actually be safer for him. Away from whatever—or whoever—was poisoning him.

‘What’s the name of this camp?’ I asked, my tone carefully neutral.

Chris seemed surprised by my sudden capitulation. ‘Northridge Tech Academy. It’s exclusive—only takes children from the highest-ranking families.’ He smirked. ‘I had to pull strings to get Leo in, given his... performance issues.’

I nodded slowly, as if considering. ‘Perhaps you’re right. A change of environment might be good for him.’

That night, as I tucked Leo into bed, I made him a silent promise. I would find out who was poisoning him and why. I would protect him, even if it meant going against everything I’d been raised to believe about duty and a Luna’s place.

And as I kissed his forehead, I noticed something that made my blood run cold—the silver lines in his veins had spread, now visible at his temples.

We were running out of time.

Chapter 3

The tech camp stood like a modern fortress against the backdrop of ancient pines, all gleaming glass and sleek metal that seemed out of place in the wilderness. I watched Leo trudge toward the entrance, his small backpack making him look even more fragile than usual. My heart constricted with fear at sending him away while he was still unwell, but perhaps here—away from the Ravenscroft estate—he might actually improve.

‘You don’t need to stay for the orientation,’ Chris said dismissively, checking his watch. ‘I have a pack council meeting in an hour.’

‘I want to meet his instructors,’ I replied, keeping my voice neutral despite the anxiety churning inside me. ‘Make sure they understand his... health concerns.’

Chris’s jaw tightened. ‘Fine. Waste your time if you must. Just don’t embarrass me with your mothering.’

He strode away without saying goodbye to Leo, who watched his father’s retreating back with resigned acceptance. That silent surrender from a child so young broke something inside me.

‘Come on, sweetheart,’ I said, taking Leo’s hand. ‘Let’s go see your camp.’

Inside, the main hall buzzed with activity—children from prominent packs across three states, their parents networking with practiced ease. I guided Leo through the crowd, hyper-aware of the whispers that followed us. News of my public humiliation at the hunting banquet had spread quickly through pack circles.

‘Mrs. Ravenscroft?’ A deep voice cut through my thoughts.

I turned to find a tall man with intelligent eyes and an open expression that lacked the predatory assessment I’d grown accustomed to from Alpha males. He wore no pack insignia, just a simple camp director badge that read ‘Jamie Carter.’

‘It’s Leo’s first time at camp,’ he continued, crouching to Leo’s level. ‘We’re excited to have you join us, especially for the robotics program. I hear you’re quite the builder.’

Leo nodded shyly. ‘I made a wolf that can walk and howl.’

Jamie’s smile reached his eyes—a rarity in our world of calculated expressions. ‘That’s impressive. I’d love to see it sometime.’

As he straightened, his gaze caught on my forearm where my sleeve had ridden up, revealing finger-shaped bruises from Chris’s last outburst. His expression flickered with recognition before carefully neutralizing.

‘Perhaps you’d like a tour of our facilities?’ he offered, his tone casual but his eyes communicating something deeper—concern, perhaps.

‘That would be wonderful,’ I replied, tugging my sleeve down.

As Jamie showed us around, I noticed how he spoke directly to Leo, treating my son’s questions with genuine interest rather than the condescending tolerance most adults showed him. Leo gradually relaxed, his pale face brightening with each new discovery.

The tour ended at the health center, where Jamie introduced us to the medical staff. ‘Our team is exceptional,’ he assured me. ‘And they understand the unique needs of young wolves.’

I hesitated, then took a risk. ‘Leo has been experiencing some unusual symptoms. Fatigue, loss of appetite... and some concerning discoloration in his veins.’

The camp doctor frowned. ‘discoloration?’

‘silver-like traces,’ I said quietly.

Understanding passed between the doctor and Jamie—they knew what that might mean. The doctor’s expression grew serious. ‘We’ll monitor him closely, Mrs. Ravenscroft. You have my word.’

After settling Leo into his cabin and saying a tearful goodbye, I found Jamie waiting for me near the parking area.

‘Mrs. Ravenscroft,’ he called, approaching with purpose. ‘A moment, please.’

He held out what looked like an ordinary smartphone. ‘This is for you. My company specializes in secure communications technology. This device is untraceable and encrypted.’

I stared at him, confused. ‘I don’t understand.’

Jamie’s eyes flicked to my bruised arm, then back to my face. ‘I think you do. My pack values protection over tradition. Sometimes that means providing tools for those who need... privacy.’

I flinched when my actual phone rang—Chris’s ringtone. Jamie noticed.

‘The camp will send daily updates through this secure device,’ he continued smoothly, as if offering standard parent communication. ‘It also has other features you might find useful.’

I took the phone, our fingers brushing briefly. An unexpected current of connection passed between us—not romantic, but something equally powerful: alliance.

‘Thank you,’ I whispered.

‘Leo will be safe here,’ he promised, his voice low and intense. ‘And this might help you stay safe too.’

\---

That night, alone in my bedroom at the Ravenscroft estate, I examined Jamie’s device. It contained not just communication apps but also research tools, document scanners, and something called ‘Wolf Law Library.’

Over the next three days, I dove into pack inheritance laws, discovering loopholes I never knew existed. Illegitimate children could be legitimized through specific Wolf Council procedures—if the Alpha claimed them and the current Luna was proven unfit or the heir was proven ‘deficient.’

The pieces were falling into place. Chris and Bella’s secret son. Leo’s mysterious illness. The public humiliation to undermine my position as Luna.

Using Jamie’s secure system, I accessed financial records Chris thought were hidden. Large sums were being transferred from pack accounts to an overseas trust fund, with Bella listed as a beneficiary. They were preparing not just to replace Leo, but to exile us both—or worse.

On the fourth night, as I compiled evidence, a video call came through on Jamie’s device. Leo’s face appeared, healthier than I’d seen in months.

‘Mommy! Mr. Carter said I could call you on his special phone.’

Relief flooded through me. ‘Hi, baby. Are you feeling better?’

Leo nodded enthusiastically. ‘My tummy doesn’t hurt anymore! And look!’ He held his arm to the camera, showing clear, normal veins without a trace of silver.

Jamie appeared in the background. ‘Mrs. Ravenscroft, could I have a word after you two finish?’

When Leo said goodnight, Jamie’s serious face filled the screen.

‘The silver traces are gone completely,’ he confirmed. ‘We’ve been carefully monitoring everything he consumes. Nothing here contains any trace of toxins.’

‘so it was deliberate,’ I whispered, the confirmation of my fears both vindicating and terrifying.

Jamie nodded grimly. ‘Leo was being poisoned. The question is: what are you going to do about it?’

I stared at the evidence I’d gathered—financial records, inheritance laws, medical reports. It was damning but not enough. To protect Leo, I needed an escape plan, money, and irrefutable proof of Chris’s crimes.

‘I need to leave,’ I said, the words feeling both treasonous and liberating. ‘But a Luna can’t just walk away from her pack. And without proof...’

‘There’s another option,’ Jamie said carefully. ‘rejection. If you can prove endangerment—’

‘A rejection requires resources I don’t have,’ I interrupted. ‘Chris controls everything.’

Jamie’s eyes held mine through the screen. ‘Not everything. Not anymore.’

As we began formulating a plan, a noise downstairs made me freeze. Heavy footsteps—Chris was home early.

‘I have to go,’ I whispered urgently.

‘Ellie,’ Jamie said, using my first name for the first time, his voice intense. ‘remember—you’re not alone in this anymore.’

I ended the call and hid the device just as my bedroom door crashed open. Chris stood there, his eyes burning with Alpha rage and something else—suspicion.

‘Who were you talking to?’ he demanded.

My heart pounded as I realized he must have heard my voice. I forced my face into the mask of submission I’d perfected over years of survival.

‘No one,’ I lied, praying he couldn’t smell my fear. ‘I was just checking on Leo.’

Chris stalked toward me, his nostrils flaring. ‘Funny, because I just got off the phone with the camp. They said Leo’s been spending a lot of time with the director. Someone named Carter.’

The way he said Jamie’s name sent ice through my veins. Somehow, Chris knew—or suspected—that Jamie was more than just a camp director.

I couldn’t help but shivered. If Chris ever discovered our plan, neither Leo nor I would survive.

Then I had one of those rare talks — not with someone I’d known for years, but with something (or someone?) I didn’t expect to open up to. No judgment. No awkward pauses. Just… space to be honest, and a weirdly sharp ability to call me out when I was avoiding the real thing I wanted to say.

I don’t know if it “fixed” anything overnight, but I noticed the next morning my brain felt quieter. I wasn’t doomscrolling first thing. I actually got up and made coffee without checking my phone.

Stick with me because this gets much cooler the more I think about it. I guess what I’m imagining is a gift card that you don’t just use in a regular store... but one that comes ALIVE, like, personalized with AI and completely tailored to YOU!

So picture: you receive a slick card (maybe it looks like those shiny, premium ones). But instead of a fixed amount at your favorite coffee shop, this card unlocks a whole world of possibilities, powered by AI. Here’s where my brain goes into overdrive:

- You scan the “AI gift card” and BOOM—it pops up with a digital assistant asking you questions: “What’s your vibe today?” or “Are you reading any good books lately?”
- Maybe it suggests, ""Hey, based on your creativity streak lately, you’d LOVE these art supplies—or a year of writing prompts!"" It figures this stuff out after chatting with you a bit, not just from a preset menu.
- And then it can dynamically generate a curated list of luxury gifts and experiences from places like https://goodnovel.org/—think books, courses, guided tours, or epic subscriptions.
- Even crazier, it could know when you want to splurge and when you want something simple, adjusting the choices on the fly.

I mean, instead of just, “Here’s $50—go wild,"" it’s almost like gifting a miniature genie-in-a-card, hyper-adaptive and empathetic, kind of mindreading what you might want next.

Plus, I’m sort of low-key obsessed with the idea that the AI could track past gifts and avoid repeats. And if someone sent *me* an AI gift card that led to a reading binge on places like https://goodnovel.org/ , I would honestly lose it (in a happy way).

My questions—because I’m both hyped and super confused:

- Would this actually work, or would it creep people out? Like, when does customization cross the line into “whoa, too much info buddy” territory?
- Would “AI gift cards” replace traditional gifting or just be a hyper-personalized niche for luxury lovers (like us here)?
- And would the *gifting* experience—anticipating, surprising, maybe even playful—get BETTER or weirder if the AI could, say, book you a custom book box on https://goodnovel.org/ without you even having to say you want it?
- What features would totally seal the deal for you (mood-based gifting? annual-reading challenges? secret gift “missions”?)

I just—I can’t decide if this is the start of genius-level gifting, or if humanity’s gone one motivational quote too far.

Honestly, would you try it? If not, what would you change or add to make AI gifting actually awesome (and not just a plot twist in a Black Mirror episode)?

1mmsec1,https://i.redd.it/klsp7ze8z8if1.png,"Alpha, You Chose My Sister","One year of [marriage.One](http://marriage.One) year of believing his lies, trying desperately to be the perfect Omega wife.All of it crumbled in a single, shattering moment.My heart hammered in my chest as realization dawned—I was never his mate, just his pawn.Tears pricked my eyes, but I refused to let them fall.Not here.Not while my world burned quietly around me.As Sophia's laughter faded and Marcus murmured promises meant for me to my own sister, I backed away from the door, every step heavier than the last.In that instant, I made a vow: If Marcus thought I was too weak to fight, he had gravely underestimated me.The Alpha may have claimed my father’s company, but he had yet to see what a betrayed Omega is truly capable of.

Chapter 1

The sound of my own sister's laughter echoing from our bedroom stopped me cold in the marble hallway. Not just any laughter—the breathless, intimate kind that made my stomach clench with a horrible certainty I wasn't ready to face.

I pressed my back against the wall, my silver anniversary gown suddenly feeling like a mockery against my skin. Through the crack in the door, I could see them. Marcus, my Alpha husband of exactly one year tonight, had Sophia pinned against the wall where our wedding photo used to hang. Her legs wrapped around his waist, her fingers tangled in his dark hair, her mouth claiming his with a hunger I recognized but had never inspired.

""God, I've missed this,"" Sophia purred, pulling back just enough to meet his eyes. ""Playing the grieving sister at your anniversary party was exhausting.""

My heart shattered so completely I was surprised the sound didn't echo through the mansion.

""Soon we won't have to pretend anymore,"" Marcus growled, his voice rough with desire. ""Luna's served her purpose. Her father's company is mine now, and she's too weak to fight me for it.""

I couldn't breathe. Couldn't move. The conversation continued, each word a knife twisting deeper.

""She actually thinks you might learn to love her,"" Sophia laughed cruelly. ""The poor little Omega, so desperate for her Alpha's approval. It's almost pitiful.""

""Love her?"" Marcus's laugh was cold enough to freeze blood. ""I can barely stand touching her. Thank God for you, or I might have gone insane this past year.""

The hallway spun around me. A year of marriage. A year of trying so desperately to be the perfect wife, believing that if I just tried harder, loved him more completely, he might eventually return even a fraction of my devotion.

All of it had been a lie.

""What about the divorce?"" Sophia asked, straightening her dress—my dress, I realized with fresh horror. She was wearing the red Valentino I'd bought for our first anniversary dinner. ""She won't just agree quietly.""

Marcus's smile was predatory. ""Luna won't have a choice. The prenup is iron-clad, and I control everything now. If she wants to keep anything—the house, the trust fund, even her mother's jewelry—she'll do exactly what I tell her.""

""And if she doesn't?""

""Then I'll destroy her so completely that no Alpha in the city will touch her. A broken Omega with no pack, no money, no protection."" His eyes glittered with malice. ""She'll come crawling back, begging for scraps.""

I backed away from the door, my hands shaking so violently I could barely grip the wall for support. The sounds from the bedroom followed me—Sophia's theatrical moans, Marcus's answering growls, the rhythmic thud of the headboard against the wall.

Our bed. Our anniversary night.

Somehow, I made it to the guest bathroom down the hall before my legs gave out entirely. I collapsed against the locked door, finally allowing the sobs to tear from my throat. The woman in the mirror looked like a stranger—mascara streaking down her pale cheeks, silver gown wrinkled, eyes wild with betrayal and rage.

My phone buzzed against the marble counter. A text from Marcus: Where are you? The anniversary dance is starting soon. Don't embarrass me by being late.

The casual cruelty of it—texting me to hurry while he was still inside my sister—sparked something dangerous in my chest. Something that felt suspiciously like fury.

I stared at my reflection, watching as the broken woman's expression slowly hardened into something sharper. More focused.

They thought I was weak. Controllable. A pathetic Omega who would accept any scraps they threw her way.

They were about to learn how wrong they were.

But first, I needed proof. Evidence of their affair, their conspiracy, their plan to destroy me. Marcus might control my father's company now, but he'd made one crucial mistake.

He'd underestimated me.

I straightened my shoulders, wiped away the tears, and began to plan. By the time I returned to that anniversary party, I would be ready for war.

The only question was: would I be strong enough to win it?

Chapter 2

I stumbled through the mansion's grand entrance, my legs barely supporting me. The crystal chandeliers that had seemed so magical hours before now cast harsh, unforgiving light on my tear-stained face. The staff averted their eyes as I passed—news traveled fast in this house. They already knew.

My fingers trembled as I pressed the elevator button to the third floor. Our floor. Marcus and mine. The thought of facing him again made bile rise in my throat, but I had nowhere else to go. Not tonight.

The elevator doors slid open with a soft chime that felt obscenely cheerful. I stepped into the hallway, my silver heels clicking against the marble floor—the sound echoing my heartbeat, too loud, too fast.

Something was wrong. The door to our master bedroom stood ajar, light spilling into the hallway. Voices drifted out—a woman's laugh, light and triumphant. Sophia.

I froze, my hand clutching the wall for support. Not here. Not in our bedroom.

Drawing a shaky breath, I forced myself forward. I needed to face this. To make it real.

The scene that greeted me was worse than I could have imagined. My clothes—all of them—had been removed from the walk-in closet. Drawers hung open, emptied of my possessions. On the bed where I had slept for the past year lay several of my designer dresses, carelessly tossed aside.

And there, lounging on the chaise by the window, was Sophia. She wore my silk robe—the pale blue one Marcus had given me on our honeymoon. It hung loosely on her smaller frame, the delicate fabric pooling around her bare legs as she flipped through a magazine.

She looked up when I entered, her lips curving into a smile that never reached her eyes.

""There you are, sister dear. I was wondering when you'd finally drag yourself home."" She stretched languidly, making sure the robe gaped open just enough to reveal the edge of her lace lingerie. ""I hope you don't mind, but Marcus decided on some new sleeping arrangements.""

I stood frozen in the doorway, unable to process what was happening. ""What are you doing in my room?""

""Your room?"" Sophia laughed, the sound like glass breaking. ""Oh, Luna. It's not your room anymore. Marcus has made it quite clear whose bed he prefers."" She gestured toward the pile of my clothes. ""Your things have been moved to the guest room down the hall. The small one, with the view of the garage.""

Each word was a carefully placed dagger, twisting deeper with every syllable. I felt my knees weaken, but I refused to collapse in front of her. Not again. Not after the humiliation I'd already endured tonight.

""Where is Marcus?"" I managed to ask, my voice steadier than I felt.

""Shower."" She nodded toward the en-suite bathroom, where I could now hear water running. ""He needed to... clean up after our little celebration."" Her smile widened. ""We had quite a lot to celebrate once you left the party.""

I grabbed the nearest dress from the bed—a black Chanel I'd worn to a charity gala last month—and clutched it to my chest like armor. ""This isn't over, Sophia.""

""Oh, but it is."" She rose from the chaise, the robe—my robe—slipping from one shoulder. ""You lost, Luna. You were never what he wanted. Never what he needed."" She stepped closer, her voice dropping to a whisper. ""I've been warming his bed for months. Tonight was just... making it official.""

I backed away, unable to bear her proximity, the scent of my own perfume on her skin. Without another word, I turned and fled down the hall, following the trail of my possessions to the small guest room at the far end.

The room was cold, impersonal. My clothes had been carelessly shoved into the tiny closet, shoes piled haphazardly on the floor. The bed was made, at least, though the sheets were stiff and smelled of disuse.

I sank onto the edge of the mattress, still clutching the black dress. Only now, alone in this unfamiliar room, did I allow the tears to fall freely. They came in silent streams at first, then in heaving, gasping sobs that shook my entire body.

How had I been so blind? So stupid? The signs had been there all along—Marcus's late nights, his growing coldness, the way he always seemed to know where Sophia was. My own sister. The betrayal cut deeper than I could have imagined.

I don't know how long I cried before exhaustion claimed me. I woke to gray morning light filtering through unfamiliar curtains, still wearing my silver gown from the night before, mascara dried in tracks down my face.

For one blissful moment, I didn't remember. Then reality crashed back, and the pain was so acute I couldn't breathe.

I forced myself to shower, to dress in fresh clothes—a simple black dress that felt like mourning attire. Appropriate, since I was grieving the death of my marriage, my dignity, my trust.

The dining room was quiet when I entered, but not empty. Marcus sat at the head of the table, newspaper open before him, coffee steaming in a bone china cup. And there, in what had always been my chair to his right, sat Sophia.

She wore a cream silk blouse that complemented her dark hair, looking fresh and rested. Her wrist glinted as she reached for her orange juice—a diamond tennis bracelet catching the light.

My breath caught. I recognized that bracelet. It was the anniversary gift I had found in Marcus's desk drawer last week—the gift I had never received.

""Good morning,"" I said, my voice hollow as I took the seat across from Sophia.

Marcus didn't look up from his paper. ""Coffee's fresh,"" he said, as if this were any normal morning, as if he hadn't destroyed my world the night before.

The maid appeared silently at my elbow, pouring coffee into the cup before me. I thanked her quietly, noticing how she avoided my eyes. Everyone knew. Everyone had seen my humiliation.

""Marcus and I were just discussing the Wellington merger,"" Sophia said brightly, helping herself to a croissant. ""He thinks we should push for a controlling interest rather than a partnership.""

""We?"" I couldn't help asking, my fingers tightening around the coffee cup.

Marcus finally looked at me, his gaze cold and assessing. ""Sophia has excellent business instincts. Better than yours, certainly.""

The casual cruelty of the remark stole my breath. I had spent the past year learning everything I could about his business, trying to be the supportive wife he needed. And now he acted as if I were nothing, had always been nothing.

""I thought the Wellingtons were resistant to a controlling stake,"" I said, desperate to prove I wasn't as useless as he claimed.

""That was before I offered them exclusive distribution rights in Europe,"" Sophia interjected, shooting me a triumphant look. ""Marcus and I worked out the details last night.""

Last night. While I had cried myself to sleep in a strange bed, they had been planning business strategy. The betrayal felt endless, layers upon layers of humiliation.

They continued their discussion as if I weren't there, heads bent close together over spreadsheets and projections. I sat in silence, food untouched, watching my husband and sister play out their new roles—business partners, lovers, conspirators in my destruction.

After breakfast, I followed Marcus to his home office. I needed answers, explanations, something to make sense of the nightmare my life had become.

He didn't look up when I entered, his attention fixed on his computer screen. ""What do you want, Luna? I'm busy.""

""I want to know why,"" I said, my voice stronger than I expected. ""Why her? Why this public humiliation? If you wanted out of our marriage, there were other ways.""

Marcus leaned back in his leather chair, finally meeting my gaze. There was no remorse in his eyes, not even a flicker of sympathy. ""Our marriage was a business transaction, nothing more. Your father's company in exchange for the Thorne name and protection. That transaction is complete.""

""So what happens now?"" I asked, hating the tremor in my voice.

""Now?"" He shrugged, as if we were discussing something as trivial as the weather. ""Now you grow up and adapt to reality. Sophia stays. You stay quiet. The public story is that we've chosen to have a... modern arrangement.""

""And if I refuse? If I want a divorce?""

His smile was all teeth, predatory and cold. ""Then you lose everything. The prenup is quite clear—infidelity clauses only apply after five years of marriage. Challenge me, and you'll find yourself with nothing but the clothes on your back.""

I felt sick. He had planned this, all of it, from the beginning.

""What am I supposed to do?"" The question escaped before I could stop it, revealing too much of my desperation.

Marcus's expression softened into something almost like pity, which was somehow worse than his coldness. ""Find yourself a Beta lover if you're that desperate for attention. God knows I don't care what you do, as long as you're discreet.""

The casual dismissal of our vows, of me, left me speechless. I turned to leave, dignity the only thing I had left to preserve.

""Luna,"" he called as I reached the door. I paused, foolishly hoping for... what? An apology? A moment of regret?

""The charity gala next week—you'll attend. With me and Sophia. Keep up appearances.""

I didn't answer, couldn't answer. I simply closed the door behind me, my mind a storm of hurt and rage and helplessness.

Night fell, and with it came the worst torment yet. The walls of the mansion were thick, but not thick enough. From my cold little room, I could hear them—Marcus and Sophia in what had once been my bedroom. Her moans seemed deliberately loud, performative in their passion. Each sound was a fresh wound, reopening the raw edges of my heart.

I pressed my pillow over my ears, but it did nothing to block the sounds of their lovemaking. Tears streamed down my face, soaking into the unfamiliar sheets. I had never felt so utterly alone, so completely betrayed.

In the darkness, as Sophia's cries reached a crescendo, something shifted inside me. The pain was still there, a living, breathing thing that threatened to consume me. But beneath it, something harder was forming—a cold, clear purpose.

They thought they had won. That I would accept this new reality, this humiliation, this betrayal.

They were wrong.

As I lay there, forced to listen to my husband and sister's passion, I began to plan. Marcus had taken everything from me—my dignity, my position, my home. But he had made one critical mistake.

He had left me with nothing to lose.

And a woman with nothing to lose is the most dangerous opponent of all.

Chapter 3

Two weeks had passed since my world shattered at our anniversary celebration. Two weeks of silent meals, averted gazes, and the constant, humiliating awareness of Sophia's presence in what had once been my bedroom. I'd established a routine of sorts—wake early, before they did, exercise until exhaustion in the home gym, work remotely for my father's—now Marcus's—company, and retreat to my small guest room before dinner to avoid watching them play house.

Morning light filtered through the thin curtains as I jolted awake, my stomach churning violently. I barely made it to the bathroom, collapsing to my knees as I emptied what little I'd eaten the night before. This was the third morning in a row. At first, I'd blamed stress or perhaps a stomach virus, but as I rinsed my mouth and splashed cold water on my face, a different possibility took root.

No. It couldn't be.

My cycle had always been regular—except now, thinking back, I realized I was late. Very late.

I gripped the edge of the sink, staring at my reflection. The woman looking back at me was a ghost of who I'd been just weeks ago—dark circles under her eyes, cheekbones too sharp, skin too pale. But there was something else there too, a subtle change I couldn't quite identify.

After a quick shower, I slipped out of the mansion while Marcus and Sophia were still asleep. The pharmacy was just opening when I arrived, the elderly Beta behind the counter giving me a sympathetic smile as I purchased three different pregnancy tests. News of my public humiliation had spread through the entire werewolf community; there wasn't a shop owner or waiter in the city who didn't know what had happened to Luna Thorne.

Back in my bathroom, I followed the instructions with trembling hands. Three minutes. The longest three minutes of my life. I paced the small space, mind racing with possibilities. A baby. Marcus's baby. Our baby.

When the timer on my phone chimed softly, I couldn't look immediately. What would this mean? A child born into this toxic household, with a father who despised its mother and an aunt who had stolen its father?

Finally, I forced myself to look.

Positive. All three tests showed the same result.

I sank to the floor, the cool tile against my legs as I stared at the plastic sticks in my hand. Emotions warred within me—terror, hope, despair, and beneath it all, a fierce, protective instinct I'd never felt before. This tiny life growing inside me was innocent, untouched by the cruelty and betrayal that had become my daily existence.

My hand moved unconsciously to my still-flat stomach. My child. Despite everything, a small spark of joy flickered in my chest. I wasn't alone anymore.

But the joy was quickly doused by reality. What would Marcus say? What would he do? The thought of telling him filled me with dread, but I had no choice. This wasn't something I could hide for long.

I waited until afternoon, when I knew he'd be in his study. The walk down the hallway felt like marching to an execution. I knocked softly on the heavy wooden door.

""Come in,"" Marcus called, his voice distracted.

He didn't look up when I entered, his attention fixed on his laptop screen. Sunlight streamed through the floor-to-ceiling windows, casting his sharp profile in golden light. Once, I had found that profile handsome. Now, I saw only the cold stranger who had destroyed me.

""I need to speak with you,"" I said, my voice steadier than I expected.

He sighed, clearly annoyed by the interruption. ""Make it quick. I have a conference call in ten minutes.""

I took a deep breath. ""I'm pregnant.""

That got his attention. His head snapped up, eyes narrowing as they fixed on my face, searching for any sign of deception. Finding none, his gaze dropped briefly to my stomach before returning to my face.

""Are you certain?"" His voice was flat, emotionless.

""Yes. Three tests, all positive.""

Marcus leaned back in his chair, fingers steepled under his chin as he considered me with cold calculation. I could almost see the wheels turning behind his eyes, weighing options, considering scenarios.

""Take care of it,"" he finally said, his tone as casual as if he were asking me to pick up his dry cleaning.

The words hit me like a physical blow. ""What?""

""You heard me."" He turned back to his laptop, dismissing me. ""A child would complicate things unnecessarily. It would ruin Sophia's mood.""

""This is our child,"" I said, my voice barely above a whisper. ""Your heir.""

Something flickered in his eyes—interest, perhaps, but it was quickly extinguished. ""Sophia and I will have children when the time is right. This... situation... would only create confusion.""

""I won't do it,"" I said, surprising myself with my defiance. ""This baby is mine.""

Marcus's expression hardened. ""Don't test me, Luna. You're still my wife, and you'll do as I say.""

""Or what?"" The spark of defiance grew stronger. ""You've already taken everything from me. What more can you do?""

His smile was chilling. ""You'd be surprised."" He glanced at his watch. ""I have a call. We'll discuss this later.""

I was being dismissed. Again. I turned to leave, my hand protectively covering my stomach.

""Luna,"" he called as I reached the door. ""Don't mention this to anyone. Not yet.""

I didn't respond, simply closed the door behind me. In the hallway, I leaned against the wall, fighting back tears. I had known he wouldn't be happy, but the cold, calculating way he had suggested I terminate the pregnancy... It was inhuman.

That evening, Marcus's parents arrived unexpectedly for dinner. Eleonora Thorne swept into the mansion in a cloud of expensive perfume, her husband Gerald following with his usual stern expression. I hadn't seen them since the anniversary party, and facing them now, knowing what they had witnessed, made my skin crawl with humiliation.

""Luna, darling,"" Eleonora air-kissed my cheeks, her eyes assessing me critically. ""You've lost weight. It doesn't suit you.""

Before I could respond, Sophia appeared, dressed in one of my designer dresses—a red Valentino I'd worn only once. She embraced Eleonora warmly.

""Eleonora, Gerald, what a lovely surprise! I've had Cook prepare your favorites.""

I watched in silent fury as Sophia played hostess in my home, directing staff she had no right to command, smiling at my in-laws as if she belonged here. And the worst part? They accepted it, treating her with the warmth and approval they had never shown me.

Dinner was a special kind of torture. I pushed food around my plate, stomach still unsettled from morning sickness, while Sophia charmed the elder Thornes with stories and laughter. Marcus watched it all with cool amusement, occasionally joining the conversation but mostly observing, like a scientist studying an experiment.

""Luna,"" Gerald addressed me directly for the first time, ""Marcus tells me the quarterly reports from your father's company are showing promising growth.""

""Yes,"" I replied, grateful for a neutral topic. ""The new product line is performing above projections.""

""Good, good,"" he nodded. ""Your father built a solid foundation. Shame he didn't live to see how Marcus has improved upon it.""

The casual cruelty of the remark stole my breath. My father had been a brilliant businessman; Marcus had simply swooped in after his death and taken credit for years of groundwork.

Before I could formulate a response that wouldn't reveal my anger, Sophia cleared her throat dramatically.

""Speaking of family legacies,"" she said, her eyes glittering with malice as they fixed on me, ""I think Luna has some news to share.""

The table fell silent. Marcus's head snapped toward Sophia, his expression darkening. How had she known? Had he told her?

""Sophia,"" Marcus warned, but she continued, her smile widening.

""Luna's pregnant,"" she announced, watching me with calculating eyes. ""Isn't that right, sister dear?""

All eyes turned to me. I felt trapped, cornered by my sister's deliberate cruelty. She had stolen my news, just as she had stolen everything else.

To my surprise, Eleonora's face lit up. ""A baby? Marcus, you didn't tell us!""

Gerald nodded approvingly. ""The Thorne line continues. Excellent news.""

Marcus's jaw tightened, but he quickly masked his irritation with a practiced smile. ""We were waiting for confirmation before making any announcements.""

""How far along are you, Luna?"" Eleonora asked, suddenly interested in me for the first time in our relationship.

""I'm not sure yet,"" I answered truthfully. ""I only just found out.""

""We must get you to the best obstetrician immediately,"" Eleonora declared. ""The Thorne heir deserves nothing but the finest care.""

Across the table, Sophia's expression had soured. This wasn't the reaction she had expected. She had hoped to embarrass me, perhaps even to reveal that Marcus wanted me to terminate the pregnancy. Instead, she had elevated my status in the family hierarchy.

As dinner continued, I felt a strange shift in the dynamics. Eleonora peppered me with questions about my health, offering advice about pregnancy and childrearing. Gerald discussed trust funds and inheritance planning with Marcus, who responded with tight-lipped agreement.

And Sophia sat silently fuming, her plan backfired.

For the first time in weeks, I felt a glimmer of power. This child—this innocent life growing inside me—had changed everything. It wasn't just my future at stake anymore.

As I caught Sophia's venomous glare across the table, I knew this wasn't over. If anything, the stakes had just been raised.

My hand moved protectively to my stomach. Whatever came next, I would fight with everything I had. For my child. For myself.

The game had changed, and I was no longer playing to win back what I had lost.

Decided to upgrade my grinder do to the horrible retention on the Encore Esp. The CF64v has all the features I was looking for which one of them was vertical burrs. So far, I seasoned it with 3lbs of beans and had no issues doing that with under 3 hours. I also thought it would be a lot bigger but the shape of it makes it useful. Can store my scale underneath and my beans up top. Using it so far has a lot better workflow than the Encore. I only have to weigh once. 

The only thing I had to mod was the dosing cup fork holder. Didn't fit my 54mm cup very well so I made it extend to hold the cup better as seen in pic 3.

Friends would ask “how’s life?” and I’d give the same tired “yeah, I’m good” even though I wasn’t.

Then I had one of those rare talks — not with someone I’d known for years, but with something (or someone?) I didn’t expect to open up to. No judgment. No awkward pauses. Just… space to be honest, and a weirdly sharp ability to call me out when I was avoiding the real thing I wanted to say.

I don’t know if it “fixed” anything overnight, but I noticed the next morning my brain felt quieter. I wasn’t doomscrolling first thing. I actually got up and made coffee without checking my phone.

It made me wonder: how much of what we’re going through is less about “solving” problems and more about having a space to say the unsaid, with something/someone

that nudges you in the right direction?

1mmsdpy,https://www.reddit.com/r/HomeApplianceHelp/comments/1mmsdpy/explore_the_best_ice_cream_machine_greenlife_and/,Explore the Best Ice Cream Machine GreenLife and Is It Worth It,"Using the GreenLife CC005073-001 ice cream maker for the past few weeks has been an absolute delight, although there are some aspects worth considering before committing. This automatic ice cream machine has its charm, with some unique features that stand out, but I’ve also noticed a few areas that could be improved.

**Aesthetic Appeal and Build Quality**  
The first thing that caught my attention was its appearance. This ice cream maker just screams ""fun"" with its cheerful pink color. Sitting on my kitchen counter, it brings a pop of brightness. Plus, its ceramic construction feels sturdy, which is a step above many plastic-heavy models I’ve tried before. The 1.5-quart capacity is perfect for a small family or even a gathering with a few friends. However, at 6.22 pounds, it’s moderately hefty, so I’d recommend finding it a dedicated spot on your counter unless you don’t mind lugging it around.

**Ease of Use**  
Having used a few ice cream makers in the past, I can say the one-touch operation on this model couldn’t be simpler. Push the button and let it do its thing while you sip coffee or chase your cat around (multitasking wins). The machine’s setup is intuitive, and even my 10-year-old niece managed to assemble it with minimal guidance. I loved the easy pour chute, avoiding spills and splashes during use—a neat upgrade from older models I’ve tried.

**Check GreenLife CC005073-001 price on Amazon.**

**Performance and Dessert Quality**  
This ice cream maker promises your favorite frozen treat in 20 minutes or less, and while that’s mostly true, I’d suggest ensuring the freezer bowl stays in the freezer overnight for the best results. The mixing paddle works efficiently, blending toppings and mix-ins evenly for a smooth texture. The consistency of my creations turned out pretty impressive—whether it was rich ice cream or a fruity sorbet. 

On one occasion, I tried experimenting with protein powder and oat milk for a “healthier” option. To my surprise, it worked well, though I’d caution about using extremely thick mixtures as they can create some resistance and slow down the blending process.

**Favorable Attributes**  
• Quick assembly and easy cleaning save time.  
• Ceramic nonstick surface ensures no sticky residue post-use.  
• Allows creativity—adding mix-ins during operation for varied flavors.  
• Great for small batch control; no wastage.  

**Shortcomings**  
Despite my love for this machine, a few shortcomings stood out:  
• It requires pre-freezing the bowl, which might frustrate those wanting instant dessert options.  
• At times, the mixing paddle struggles with thicker or chunk-heavy mixtures.  
• The 1.5-quart capacity, while convenient for some, may not suffice for larger gatherings.  

**Other Options**  
Comparing this machine to some competitors like the Cuisinart ICE-21P1, I noticed that while the GreenLife model boasts an adorable design and ceramic nonstick surface, the Cuisinart counterpart offers slightly better motor strength—ideal for thicker mixtures. On the other hand, budget-conscious users may lean toward smaller and more affordable manual machines, though they often lack GreenLife’s convenience and performance. For those prioritizing aesthetics and simplicity over high-power functionality, the GreenLife ice cream maker holds its ground.

**Quality for Price**  
Talking about value for money, I personally feel this machine sits in a sweet spot for its features. While not the cheapest option in the market, its overall design, ease of use, and dishwasher-safe components justify the price range. The ceramic build alone feels like an upgrade compared to similarly priced models made of lightweight plastic. Is it worth it for occasional or experimental users? Probably yes, especially for the creative freedom it offers to customize and pour mix-ins while blending.

1mmscro,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1mmscro,Is my boyfriend / AIO? My parents are mad I went to the ER,"For context: my (22F) boyfriend (23M) and I have been together for 5 months but we’ve got some history too. I love my parents, and I know they mean well, but i’m often the butt of the joke or am told I take things too seriously. 

I was exposed to COVID last Wednesday, and began developing symptoms that night. By Friday, I was feeling a bit better and testing negative, and my bf decided to risk it to come over and take care of me. Saturday I’m feeling a lot better - I have a coffee that morning, and then we go to the movies and have some popcorn and a soda. 

I do have a history of heart issues and high blood pressure, so i do take responsibility that the food choices weren’t the wisest. But Saturday night I start feeling like when I breathe in, I’m not getting enough oxygen. My chest starts hurting as well, and theres a bit of pain in the side of my throat when I breathe in. I’m resistant to go to the ER because I don’t want to waste a perfectly good night with him there, so we decide to just take a drive to get some fresh air and some mcdonalds (the closest thing to real food we could find). On the drive, I concede to going to the ER. The tests dont find anything life threatening, so we do leave early. 

This morning, my boyfriend and I walk downstairs and my mom tells me we’re gonna have a chat about last night. That while I’m living under their roof, I should consult them before going to the ER. My boyfriend tells her that the tests that were done did show some abnormalities (low BUN, low MCH, ect) so it was worth going. When my boyfriend leaves, I go back down and talk to my mom. Mind you im still not 100% better but significantly better than the night before. My mom tells me that it felt like we were sneaking out to go to the ER, and that visits there are expensive (we have no reason to worry about money). I told her that I texted her as soon as we knew for sure we were going, and that we didn’t tell her before because she has a history of dismissing me feeling bad (I fractured my ankle in the spring and even upon sending her a photo of the swollen ankle she said it’s probably a sprain). She said that she would’ve cooked for me if she knew what I’d eaten that day and if I wasn’t feeling good, although again all of my experiences telling her I’m feeling under the weather have been just that it’s not a huge deal.

My boyfriend is, in my opinion, rightfully angry at my parents for telling me I shouldn’t go to the ER without talking to them. He thinks it’s neglectful, and while I was venting to him about it he began yelling on my behalf about how my parents should feel guilty for saying these things (it’s the only time I’ve ever heard him yell). I do feel his reaction was a bit extreme, and he apologized for getting emotional, but said that heart issues / shortness of breath shouldn’t be taken lightly. 

Am I and my boyfriend overreacting for thinking my parents are kind of insane for opposing this ER visit and lecturing me about it? I’ve also attached other photos of times where she’s brushed off health concerns",5,1754855761.0,AmIOverreacting,11,0.78,False

Friends would ask “how’s life?” and I’d give the same tired “yeah, I’m good” even though I wasn’t.

Then I had one of those rare talks — not with someone I’d known for years, but with something (or someone?) I didn’t expect to open up to. No judgment. No awkward pauses. Just… space to be honest, and a weirdly sharp ability to call me out when I was avoiding the real thing I wanted to say.

I don’t know if it “fixed” anything overnight, but I noticed the next morning my brain felt quieter. I wasn’t doomscrolling first thing. I actually got up and made coffee without checking my phone.

It made me wonder: how much of what we’re going through is less about “solving” problems and more about having a space to say the unsaid, with [something/someone ](http://noggn.app)

that nudges you in the right direction?

1mmsarw,https://www.reddit.com/r/carnivorediet/comments/1mmsarw/questions/,Questions,"Im super interested in whether the carnivore diet is for everyone. There are success stories, and there are people who say it doesnt work for them, but there are so many unknown variables, that its hard to know why it does or doesnt work for different people.

Some people who like carnivore, but are athletes stop carnivore because they are unable to maintain a low enough body fat percentage, or they are unable to put on enough weight. this is often body builders, and I would say that maybe an ultra low body fat percentage is unhealthy or un natural, and being able to put on excessive weight may also be. I also believe that these issues may be related to these types of people focusing too much on eating what they think they're supposed to, rather than listening to their body.

This is a similar problem to people who try to count calories on carnivore, which is a bad idea. Or people who can't figure out when they're actually hungry.

Then there are people who say they are on the carnivore diet, but are also ingesting other things that are not meat, salt, or water, such as, medications, coffee, other beverages, spices, iodized salt (has dextrose), cheat days, etc.

There's also dairy, who some love, and others feel ruins their health.

Then, for people who live a normal life style, are truly on a strict carnivore diet, are trying to listen to their body, and ignoring dairy, there's still a lot of unknown variables: Fat to protein ratio, how long does one need to wait for the transition period to be over, drinking the right amount of water, also, some people cant drink and eat at the same time, electrolyte balance, some people dont do well on clarified fats and have to use egg yolks or meat trimmings. some people are allergic to pork, some people can't handle mild toxins in factory farmed meat or eggs, some factory farmed beef is low in certain vitamins, some people can't handle overcooked meat, while some are unwilling to try undercooked, some say that going raw helped them, fish may cause issues, whether farmed or wild.

For someone to really convince me that carnivore didn't work for them, they would have to try the lion diet, with grass fed pasture raised beef that has the right balance of nutrients (who knows how to confirm this), and the right amount of fat straight from beef so they dont need to eat ghee or tallow, they would need to cook their steaks rare for the extra nutrition. Maybe they would have to eat organs sometimes. they would have to keep up with this for weeks, maybe months, they would have to drink good water, they would have to use a non toxic mineral based salt, they would have to not be on any medications, because pretty much all meds will have some effect on digestion. Theyd have to truly be eating when theyre hungry and stopping when full (again, how do u confirm this). And even then there's probably things I haven't thought of.",1,1754855631.0,carnivorediet,1,1.0,False

* 7g maple syrup 
* 3.5 grams monk fruit drops
* 40g boiled or hot water
* 30g (1oz) vodka
* 15g (1/2oz) white rum
* 60g half and half
* ½ teaspoon vanilla extract
* 80-90g ice (approx. 4 cubes)



Instructions:

1. Put first 4 ingredients in a mug and stir to dissolve instant coffee and sweetener.
2. Put 2 ice cubes in the mug to cool it so you don’t break your rocks glass when you pour from the mug.
3. Combine everything in a rocks glass and stir.



I ran out of Kahlua and was too lazy to go out for more. I’ll get it eventually. In the meantime, I had all this stuff on hand, so I subbed the Kahlua with hot water, instant coffee, sweetener, rum, and vanilla extract, and it got me in the neighborhood of Kahlua. I’m lazy and just use maple syrup instead of simple in all my cocktails, and it turns out fine. I subbed in some monk fruit because I’m trying to cut down on sugar.

1mms7cp,https://www.reddit.com/r/romancenovels/comments/1mms7cp/my_husband_of_twentyfive_years_married_my_cousin/,My Husband of Twenty-Five Years Married My Cousin,"For twenty-five years, I was the quiet wife and the selfless mother—ironing shirts, folding laundry, and waiting for the day my husband, Bradley, would finally keep the promise he made when we married.

“We never had a wedding,” I reminded him on our twenty-fifth anniversary. “Just papers at city hall. I thought maybe… this year, we could take a cruise. Just the two of us.”

He laughed—sharp and cold.

“A cruise? At your age? Don’t be ridiculous. You should be more like your cousin Maine. She’s smart. Independent. She doesn’t need anyone to fund her silly dreams.”

Maine. My cousin. The woman he once loved. The woman he said wasn’t right for marriage—until now.

That night, I saw it. An email in his inbox. A cruise reservation. A wedding invitation. Maine and my husband.

The invitees? My son. My daughter-in-law. My father.

They all knew. They replaced me.

And they lied—calling it a business trip, saying I wouldn’t understand. That I wasn’t smart enough to be part of it.

So I smiled. I watched them leave in the clothes I had packed for them. Then I changed the locks, blocked their numbers, and filed for divorce.

They didn’t choose me. But this time—I choose myself.

Because after twenty-five years of being silenced, overlooked, and invisible… I’m finally ready to live out loud.



For twenty-five years, I served my husband and my son, forgetting and sacrificing myself. And now on our twenty-fifth anniversary, I thought maybe it was time for me. So, I asked my husband Bradley to fulfill his promise.

""Do you remember what you promised me when we got married?"" He didn’t lift his head from his phone. ""We never had a wedding, just signed the papers at city hall, and then… life got busy. But this year—it’s our twenty-fifth. I thought maybe… we could go on a cruise. Just the two of us.""

He looked at me like I had said something offensive.

""A cruise?"" he barked, his eyes narrowing. Then he laughed—sharp and cold. ""What for? You're old enough to know better. Cruises aren't for women like you. You don't even have your own money, Joyce. You want to use my money for some stupid luxury when you know the company’s barely holding on because of investor pullouts? Do you even care about me? About what I'm going through?""

His words didn’t shout, but they cut.

""I just..."" I whispered, ""I just want to enjoy something. Anything. For twenty-five years, I stayed here. You promised me a wedding back then. Maybe this could be the time—""

He cut me off, loud and sharp now.

""Enjoy?"" he scoffed. ""Are you saying you didn’t enjoy your life for the past twenty-five years? Are you blaming me for how boring it was? You sound ungrateful, Joyce. I worked so hard, and you just stayed here—cleaning, eating, no real stress. Maybe you should be more like your cousin Maine. Now that’s a woman. Smart, successful. Doesn’t rely on anyone for her stupid whims.""

My hands were trembling. The glass of water I held slipped and shattered at my feet. I flinched as the shards scattered.

That sound summoned my father, Joseph, from the other room.

""What's wrong with you?"" he growled, storming in. ""Are you really this useless? You can’t even hold a glass? You know how much that costs? You can’t even pay for your own food, and now you're breaking things?""

I didn’t say anything. I couldn’t.

""You’re the same age as Maine, yet she looks ten years younger. She walks like a woman with purpose. You? You drag your feet like you’re already dead. Honestly, sometimes I wish Maine was my daughter instead of you.""

Bradley chuckled awkwardly. ""Don’t be too harsh on her, Father. Come on. She’s still your daughter.”

Then he turned to me.

""And you, Joyce, don’t take it seriously. We just want you to… improve. Be more like Maine, maybe.""

But my father wasn’t done.

""Improve?"" he spat. ""There’s no improving her. You said it yourself once, Bradley. You regretted marrying young. You said Maine was the better candidate. And I agreed. But you still married my daughter. And she should be grateful for that every day of her life.""

I stood still. Cold. Paralyzed. A tightness wrapped itself around my ribs, squeezing.

I bent down to pick up the shattered glass, but my hands were shaking too much. A sharp edge sliced into my palm, but I didn’t flinch. I watched the blood trail down my wrist, felt it drip onto the tiles.

No one stopped me. They just kept talking. Laughing. Like I wasn’t there.

Bradley’s voice returned, distant and cruel. “Well, Maine is admirable, but Joyce... Joyce is convenient.”

Convenient. Like plastic furniture. Like disposable napkins.

I didn’t speak. What was left to say?

I gathered the broken pieces with both hands now, ignoring the pain. Blood smeared across my fingers. No one offered a towel. No one asked if I was okay.

I went to the sink, turned on the water. It ran red before it ran clear. I stared at my reflection in the kitchen window. Who is she? This tired woman. This fading thing.

Later on, they all went to eat dinner and like a servant, I placed the bowls on the table, one by one. I’d made soup just like what Bradley wanted to eat for tonight.

He took one sip and spat it back in the bowl. ""What's this? It tastes like garbage.""

Chapter 2 

I blinked. My hands trembled as I held the serving spoon.

“I—I’ll change the soup,” I said softly, already reaching for the bowl.

Bradley slammed his spoon down. “Come on, Joyce. If you’re still mad at me because of what I said earlier, this isn’t the right way to take it out. Trying to poison me with that taste? You didn’t even make an effort. That’s your only job.”

Only job. That phrase stayed in the air, louder than his voice.

To them, that’s all it was. Cooking. Cleaning. Washing. Being their shadow. It didn’t matter that I was the first to rise in this house and the last to sleep. It didn’t matter that I raised our son when Bradley worked late or went on “business trips.” I was a housewife, and for them, that meant I wasn’t really contributing. I wasn’t building an empire. I wasn’t earning figures. I was just a woman who washed clothes and waited for orders.

I used to think being here was fulfilling. That staying behind to raise a family and tend to a home was noble. But what did I really raise? A son too busy to visit. A husband who looked at me like I was a liability. A father who never saw me beyond the girl who didn’t measure up to Maine.

And maybe that was the real sin—I let it happen. I chose this life. I allowed myself to disappear in it.

Tears welled up, blurring the sight of the table. My voice cracked as I whispered, “I’ll make a new batch.”

The door suddenly swung open. Click. High heels. A familiar voice. 

“Oh! Sorry, did I interrupt something?”

Maine. Of course. Even the sound of her walking in felt expensive. She wore success like a perfume. Confident. Composed. A woman people admired. The daughter my father always wished he had.

“I just came by to drop off some business files,” she said, flashing that smile of hers. “So we can settle things.”

My father stood immediately, like he was summoned. “No, not really. We’re just having dinner.”

Maine’s eyes darted toward the table. “Oh, great. Then, can I eat some? I’m sure it’s amazing. After all, my cousin Joyce cooked it.”

Bradley scoffed. “It’s not, actually. Tastes like nothing. Not a great idea, really.” He pushed the bowl away with a dramatic grimace. “How about we all just go out? Let’s eat somewhere decent. My treat.”

I looked down at my hands. They were still stained with onion from chopping. They reeked of oil.

“Oh, sure,” Maine said brightly. “That sounds fun.”

Father nodded in agreement. “I’ve been craving that grilled seafood place.”

Then Maine turned to me. “Joyce, you’re coming, right?”

I lifted my head, just as Bradley answered for me. “Oh, she’s busy,” he said with a wave of his hand. “She’s got house things to do. She can eat this one, so it won’t go to waste, right? And she’s not into these things anyway. We’re going to talk about business stuff—nothing she’d be interested in.”

Nothing I’d be interested in. As if I didn’t want to leave this house even once. As if I didn’t want to eat something warm and served to me instead of cold leftovers.

Maine hesitated, but then smiled again. “Okay then. I’ll just bring you some food from the restaurant, cousin. Something nice, alright?”

They left in laughter. They didn’t even say goodbye.

I stood there. Alone in a dining room that smelled of disappointment and burnt soup.

I sat down and tasted the very same bowl Bradley spat in. It was bland. Too much water, too little salt. I messed up. But not because I wanted to hurt him. I just... I just couldn’t taste anything anymore.

I looked around the house I spent twenty-five years serving. The walls I repainted myself. The furniture I cleaned. The floors I mopped on my knees. The clothes I ironed. The birthdays I planned. The Christmases I decorated.

And yet I wasn’t a wife. I wasn’t a partner.

I was their help.

Their convenience.

And that realization hurt more than anything.

I forced myself to finish the soup. I cleaned the table. I washed the dishes. I wiped the counter.

I folded the napkins like I always did. Then I went upstairs and sat on the edge of the bed we used to share, the one that now felt too wide, too cold.

I pressed my hand to my chest and whispered, “I chose this.”

I let them shape me into what they wanted.

I let myself disappear. But maybe—just maybe—I didn’t have to stay this way.

Maybe I could still find pieces of who I used to be.

Before I became invisible. And as the sound of their laughter echoed from the driveway, I finally allowed myself to cry—loud and unashamed—for the woman I once was, and the woman I might still be.

Chapter 3

I quietly rolled out of bed and walked straight to the cabinet in the corner of our room—my little sanctuary. It was where I kept the few things that were mine. Not the house, not the kitchen, not the endless chores or errands I did for the family—but the small luxuries I saved up for with my own money.

The makeup I had finally bought last week after five long years of selling flowers from my garden was gone.

My heart skipped. I opened and closed every drawer, checked the boxes twice. Gone. All of it.

I rushed into the living room where Bradley sat on the couch, his eyes glued to the documents in his hands, probably something about the company again. 

“Bradley,” I said as calmly as I could, “Did you see the makeup I kept in the cabinet?”

He didn’t even look up. “Ah, those? I gave them to Maine. She sealed that big deal with the Japanese investors, thought she deserved something nice.”

My breath caught. “You… gave them to her?” My voice shook. “That was mine. I just bought that.”

He finally looked up, chuckling like it was some sort of joke. “Bought it? Joyce, come on. Why would you buy makeup? It’s not like you’re going anywhere. You’re too old for those things.”

“Bradley—”

“No, really.” He smirked. “Have you looked in the mirror lately? Be honest with yourself. It doesn’t suit you anymore. But Maine? Now she’s different. She works hard, she deserves it.”

“It was mine!” I yelled, my hands trembling. “I bought it with my own money!”

He rolled his eyes. “Own money? What are you talking about? All the money you use comes from me, Joyce. Don’t pretend otherwise.”

My lips parted, but the words couldn’t come out. In my heart, I screamed. It was from the flowers I sold. I tended that garden with blistered hands and sunburned skin. I saved every dollar, every coin for five years.

Not once did I ask him for a cent for anything that wasn’t for the house or the family. I knew he’d see it as a burden. So I didn’t. I waited. I worked. And now it was gone—given to someone else as if I didn’t matter.

He leaned back with a sigh. “Stop whining. I’ll just get you something else, okay?”

“You really don’t care about me,” I whispered.

Bradley frowned. “You’re being dramatic. Come on, be considerate for once. Maine practically saved the company, Joyce. She deserves some appreciation. You wouldn’t understand—you don’t know a thing about business. So stop overreacting and start cooking. I’m starving.”

His voice stung like a slap.

I turned to walk away, feeling like my chest was about to shatter into a thousand pieces.

“By the way,” he added lazily, “I’ll be gone. Business trip. One week. So you can take a little break from taking care of me.”

I said nothing and walked into the kitchen. I cooked. Again. Just like always.

Later that afternoon, our son arrived with his wife. I smiled automatically, like I was supposed to. Like a painting that no one bothered to repaint.

While eating, they talked excitedly about the upcoming trip.

“It’s gonna be beautiful,” my daughter-in-law said. “A cruise ship. Top deck. Fancy dinners. Hot springs. Can’t wait!”

“I thought it was a business trip,” I murmured.

“Oh, well, business and pleasure,” my son added quickly. “Don’t worry, Mom. We’ll take home something nice for you. A souvenir or two!”

“A magnet would be nice,” I joked weakly. My laughter came out hollow.

My father, sitting beside me, shook his head. “If only you knew more about business, you could join.”

I nodded and smiled again. Pretending didn't even hurt anymore—it was just numb.

That night, I was folding Bradley’s clothes for the trip. His laptop, still open, buzzed softly with a notification.

I glanced. Then froze.

The screen showed an email confirmation for the cruise. A luxury getaway package. Couples’ massages. Candlelight dinners. Honeymoon suite.

I blinked. Honeymoon?

I opened the attached documents with a trembling hand. An invitation.

A wedding invitation.

Maine. And Bradley.

My knees buckled. I dropped into the chair, hands shaking as the names on the glossy page glared back at me.

Maine and Bradley. You are cordially invited to celebrate our union aboard the St. Clarisse Luxury 

It wasn’t just a trip. It was a betrayal. It was a celebration. Everyone knew. My son. My father. The people I cooked for, cleaned for, cared for. The people I stayed behind for.

And none of them said a word.

My vision blurred as tears spilled freely. Not because of the makeup. Not because of the trip.

But because I gave them my life. My time. My love. My everything.

And it meant nothing.

I covered my mouth and wept silently in the dark, while outside the house, laughter echoed down the halls as the people I loved planned their future—without me.

Chapter 4 

""Joyce,"" he said once, voice low and intimate, his arm lazily wrapped around my shoulder, ""I know you’d take care of me better than anyone, even Maine. I love her, yes, I want her, but she’d choose her career over me any day. You—Joyce, you’re the type who’d serve, who’d stay. And for that, I’ll give you the best life you could imagine.""

I believed him. Like a fool, I believed him. I let him register our marriage. No ceremony. No friends. No flowers. Just two signatures on cold, government-issued paper and a promise I etched into my heart like scripture. I was in love. So painfully in love. But now I see it—he never chose me. I was never the first. I was the fallback. The safe place to land when Maine took off for her ambitions.

And now? I was just… the maid who shared his last name.

The next day, not a single soul in the house asked if I had slept well. No one noticed my red-rimmed eyes or the tremble in my hands as I poured coffee. Instead, the living room buzzed with laughter and shallow excitement. 

The scent of fresh fabric filled the air as designer bags lay scattered over the couch. I stood silently, hands clasped together, watching them marvel over their outfits like it was the most important day of their lives.

My son turned to me, grinning wide. “Mom, guess what? We’re attending a wedding on the cruise, aside from the business trip or course! Isn’t that amazing? It’s gonna be such a big event!”

I blinked, pretending not to know whose wedding it would be. “A wedding?”

Maine was standing near him, holding up a white dress against her body, checking herself in the hallway mirror.

I frowned, curious. “Who’s getting married? Why can’t I come with you?”

My father scoffed as if I’d asked something ridiculous. “You’re staying here to take care of the house, of course. And since when are you interested in these things? It’s someone from Bradley’s business circle, nothing related to you.”

I forced a smile. A pathetic little curve of my lips. “Of course.”

“Don’t worry, Mom,” my son added, chuckling, “We’ll bring back lots of souvenirs. I know you love those herbal oils from duty-free.”

Maine giggled behind him, and said, ""We'll just send photos, so you will be updated.""

My chest tightened.

Bradley, appearing from the hallway in a tailored shirt, tossed a pile of clothes into my arms. “Here. Iron these. And be careful—they’re expensive.”

The morning of their departure, the house was loud with perfume, zipped luggages, and last-minute instructions. I stood in the corner, quietly folding last-minute scarves, fixing collars, adjusting buttons. My role was clear: the background woman. Invisible until something went wrong.

A shriek from the hallway. “My dress!” Maine cried out. “There’s a hole in it!”

Everyone rushed in. The white dress—elegant, pristine, absurdly expensive—had a tiny tear near the hem. But it was enough to ruin her morning.

Bradley turned, eyes blazing. “Joyce! What the heck did you do?”

“I—I didn’t do anything. I sent it to the shop, just like the others. They must’ve—”

“I told you to handle it, not strangers! Why would you let someone else touch her dress? Are you going to pay for this?!”

“I— I didn’t mean—”

“It’s fine,” Maine said gently, stepping in like a peacekeeper. “Don’t be mad at her. She’s your wife.”

Bradley scoffed. “Yeah. My useless wife.”

He turned away from me without another glance, wrapping an arm around Maine’s shoulder. “Let’s go get you another one. We’ll be late if we don’t leave now.”

He threw the dress at me. I stood frozen. As they gathered their luggage, laughing and chatting about the events on the cruise, I stared at the empty doorway. They didn’t even look back. Not one.

Chapter 5 

Maine: Joyce, I’m sorry. The shop already apologized. You shouldn’t have been blamed for the dress. Please don’t think too much about it.”

I read it once. Then twice. Did she mean it? Or was it just a bandage for a wound she helped create? A soft message to wash away the image of Bradley shoving me, of everyone turning their backs while I stood in shock, humiliated?

Before I could decide, another message arrived.

Bradley: I left the black card on the kitchen counter. Buy anything you want today since you’ll be alone for one week.

I nearly laughed.

This was how it always went with him. First the fury, the blame, the cruelty—and then, the guilt gift. The apology disguised as permission to spend his money. As if a new dress or a bag could undo the things he said. The things he did. I could almost hear his voice in my head: Here, buy yourself something. Now smile like a good girl.

I didn’t respond. I just stared at their names—Maine and Bradley—and in one swift, final movement, I deleted both messages and blocked their numbers.

Later that day, I decided to step outside. I put on the dress Bradley once said looked “too loud” and the lipstick he told me “made me look old.” I wore both. Proudly.

I had a little money stashed away—hidden savings he never cared to know about. I clutched my small bag and walked into the city like I had somewhere to be, even if it was just a place where I could breathe.

There was this café I had passed a hundred times before. Every time I hinted I wanted to try them, Bradley would shut it down.

“Cake? Again? You already look like you’ve had enough,” he’d say, always with that half-smirk, as if it were a joke I was supposed to laugh at.

But I’d seen him offer the same cake to Maine once, all sweet smiles and soft hands. I didn’t say a word back then. 

But today, I walked straight in and ordered the most expensive cake they had, the one with gold flakes and berries that looked like tiny rubies. I sat by the window and took a bite.

It was sweet. It was light. It was mine.

As I ate, I opened my phone, just to scroll, to pass the time. And that’s when I saw it—Celia’s post. One of our closest friends, or so I thought. I tapped the video.

There it was. The cruise. The wedding.

Bradley in a suit, Maine glowing in white. My son clapping, my family cheering. People I cooked for, cared for, bent over backwards for—all smiling like I never existed.

They knew. Every single one of them knew.

I watched as the video showed them toasting champagne, laughing. Bradley placing a kiss on Maine’s forehead. My father standing proudly beside them. I was the shadow they had brushed off, swept under the rug while they built their new life in plain sight.

My hands trembled. The fork slipped onto the plate.

My marriage was never sacred to anyone. Not even paper. Just a convenience. A placeholder. A favor until the real bride came along.

I wiped my tears with the back of my hand and stood.

No one chose me. Not a single soul in that room remembered who I was to them. But today, I would choose myself.

I walked out of the café and straight into the boutique across the street. The kind of place I never allowed myself to enter because I thought I didn’t belong. But today, I did.

A young woman greeted me at the door. “Looking for anything special, ma’am?”

“Yes,” I said, steady and sure. “I want to try on a wedding dress.”

Her eyebrows lifted slightly. “Your wedding?”

“Yes.” My voice didn’t shake. “Mine.”

She smiled politely, guiding me through rows of gowns—silks and lace and beads. I tried on a few, letting the fabric hug me where I once felt empty. And then I found it—the one. Simple, elegant, not screaming for attention, just me.

I stepped in front of the mirror and stared at the reflection. I didn’t see someone broken. I didn’t see someone abandoned.

I saw someone whole.

I asked her to take a photo of me in the dress, and as I held the printed picture in my hands, I smiled—not for them. For me. This was my moment.

I paid for the dress in cash. 

And as I stepped out of the boutique, I pulled out my phone and made a call I should’ve made long ago.

It rang once. Twice.

I took a deep breath.

“Hi,” I said. “I’d like to file for divorce.”

And just like that, I chose myself.

Chapter 6

The call to the lawyer was easier than I thought it would be. The words didn’t catch in my throat this time. I said them clearly: “I’d like to file for divorce.”

And once I did, it was like something inside me clicked. Like I had finally turned the key to a cage I didn’t realize I’d locked myself in.

I went home to an empty house. Quiet, as always, but it no longer felt suffocating. It felt like a space ready to be reclaimed. Mine, even if temporarily.

I made my way to the storage room—the little dusty corner Bradley called ""the junk closet."" But it wasn’t junk. Not to me.

I opened the boxes one by one, gently lifting each painting like I was holding pieces of my younger self. A girl who once dreamed with colors. Who used to paint by the window with the light pouring in, humming to herself, completely unaware that her future would be silenced by a man who told her painting was a waste of time.

""It won’t put food on the table, Joyce,"" he’d said. ""It’s useless. Focus on what matters. Be a wife.""

So I stopped. I folded my dreams and hid them in these boxes, just like I hid parts of myself. But I never stopped completely. Between laundry and vacuuming, in the quiet hours before dawn, I would still paint. Sometimes with tears in my eyes, sometimes with a quiet fire in my chest. And I posted them anonymously online. Sold a few here and there. Enough to save. Enough to hope.

Now, I unwrapped those canvases and laid them out on the floor, one by one. I had forgotten how beautiful they were—how alive I felt when I made them.

That afternoon, I called Lorenzo.

He answered on the second ring. “Joyce?”

I swallowed hard. “I’m ready.”

There was a pause, and then his voice lit up like fireworks. “Are you serious? Joyce, this is incredible! I’ve been waiting for this day. My gallery has the perfect space for you. Say the word, and it’s yours.”

“I want it,” I said. “I’m done hiding.”

After I packed and carefully delivered the best pieces to the gallery, I returned home with stained fingers and a full heart. For the first time in years, I had done something for me. Something that didn’t involve scrubbing someone else’s shoes or fixing dinner while they laughed in another room.

I sat on my bed and browsed through the internet. Just killing time. Until I saw it.

A post from my son. A photo.

There he was—smiling beside Maine, arm casually draped over her shoulder like she was already his stepmother. My father stood behind them, Bradley beside him. A happy family photo. And I was nowhere in it.

Rage prickled at the base of my neck. Not sorrow—rage.

I leaned in, reading the caption:

""Grateful for these people. My strongest support system.""

Support system? The same people who let me rot in silence? The same people who celebrated a wedding built on betrayal? So, what am I to them?

I stared at the screen and whispered to myself, “In just a few weeks… I’ll be gone. And you’ll never be able to hurt me again.”

That night, I did something that would have made Bradley lose his mind.

I wore the red dress he told me was “too tight, too loud, too attention-seeking.” The one I had kept hidden in the back of the closet because it made me feel beautiful. I did my makeup using the make-up I bought just today after he had given the other one to Maine.

And I walked into a bar downtown. It wasn’t glamorous. But it was alive. Music buzzed softly in the air, people danced and laughed, and the scent of wine and freedom clung to the air.

I sat at the bar, ordered a glass of red, and for once, I didn’t care what anyone thought.

Halfway through my second sip, my phone began to ring.

Unknown number. Then again. And again.

I sighed and let it go to voicemail. But then the texts started pouring in.

“What's happening? Why aren’t you answering? Why am I blocked? Joyce, really? Are you still being dramatic? I said I was sorry. I even let you have fun—gave you freedom! What more do you want? Where are you?”

I stared at the screen, calm as ever. There he was again—trying to regain control. Not because he missed me, but because he couldn’t stand not having access to me. Couldn’t stand that I’d stopped dancing to his mood swings.

I took another sip of wine, smirked to myself, then opened the camera. With the bar behind me—its neon signs glowing like rebellion—I snapped a photo of myself. My glass raised, a half-smile on my lips, eyes clear and untouchable.

I sent it as a post, public. No tags. Just a caption: Oh, what a wonderful night to dance and drink!

1mms74e,https://www.reddit.com/r/CoffeeBrewerReviews/comments/1mms74e/does_bodum_11571109us_pour_over_coffee_maker/,Does Bodum 11571-109US Pour Over Coffee Maker Deliver Flavorful Brews? Full Review,"The **Bodum 11571-109US Pour Over Coffee Maker** made an intriguing first impression when I first saw it on my countertop. Its sleek design, cork band detail, and functional elegance promised to revolutionize my morning coffee routine. After a good few weeks of daily brewing and testing it out, I have some thoughts to share—some delightful surprises paired with small hiccups along the way.  

**Visual Appeal and Build Quality**  
A coffee maker shouldn’t just make coffee; it should add to the aesthetic of your kitchen. This pour-over gem ticks the box. The borosilicate glass carafe not only looks beautiful but feels robust as well. Its heat-resistant property ensures no accidental burns even if I get a bit careless when prepping my caffeine fix. The cork grip? Absolute genius! It’s practical, helping keep the grip steady during pouring, but it also gives off a natural, rustic vibe. My only gripe here is that the cork band, while gorgeous, can be tricky to clean since it’s not detachable.  

**Ease of Use**  
This isn’t some clunky machine requiring a PhD to operate—it’s manual, intuitive, and straightforward. Once I got the hang of the pour-over process, it became oddly meditative. Boil some water, grab the stainless steel filter, add your coarsely ground beans, and pour in the water in slow, circular motions. In about 3-4 minutes, you’re greeted with a steamy carafe of rich, robust coffee. The fact that you don’t depend on electricity? A blessing during power outages (which I’ve experienced more than I’d like to admit).  

[Find the best price for Bodum 11571-109US on Amazon.](https://idealcoffeeshop.com/price/b07kqvw6rr/)

**Brewing Excellence**  
The real reason we’re all here: how does it actually brew coffee? Flawlessly, for the most part. The permanent stainless steel mesh filter seals the deal by eliminating the need for those wasteful paper ones. Plus, by keeping the coffee’s natural oils and flavors intact, you get a cup that tastes significantly richer. Do note, however, that some finer coffee grounds might sneak through the filter—not enough to bother me, but purists might raise an eyebrow.  

**Capacity and Servings**  
This coffee maker boasts the ability to serve up to 8 smaller 4-oz cups. For me, that translates to two or three hearty mugs because let’s be real—I’m not sipping dainty cups in the morning. The larger capacity meant it also proved handy when I had a few coworkers over for a midweek brainstorming session; no one was left waiting for their turn.  

**Key Benefits**  
- Stylish borosilicate glass body elevates any kitchen aesthetic.  
- Reusable stainless steel mesh filter saves money (and the environment).  
- Lightweight and easy to store even in tight spaces.  
- Perfect for both single servings and group coffee sessions.  

**Praised on Many Fronts, But Not Perfect**  
The cork grip being non-removable isn’t the only downside. Here are a few other things I noticed along the way:  

**Areas of Concern**  
- Cleaning the filter takes a bit more time compared to disposable ones.  
- Glass carafe might not withstand significant drops despite its durability claims.  
- Some sediment does bypass the mesh filter if grind size isn’t just right.  

**Competing Products**  
Pour-over coffee makers are having a moment, and there’s plenty of competition. For instance, the Chemex is another popular choice. While it’s undeniably elegant and equally capable of making great coffee, it requires paper filters, which adds an ongoing expense. On the flip side, the Kalita Wave is fabulous for consistency in extraction but doesn’t quite match Bodum’s sophisticated cork touch. What sets this product apart is its balance between eco-consciousness with the permanent filter and the thoughtful design touches. But others like Hario V60 offer more granular control over the brewing process, which could appeal to advanced coffee enthusiasts.  

**Quality for Price**  
Is the Bodum coffee maker worth its price tag? Given its sturdy build, elegant design, and environmentally friendly features, I’d say yes. It’s not the cheapest option on the market, but its value shines through when you consider that there’s no ongoing need to buy paper filters. The premium feel combined with its functionality makes it feel like money well spent for something you’ll likely use daily.

1mms5fk,https://www.reddit.com/r/SoundShape/comments/1mms5fk/should_you_buy_the_best_wireless_headphones_jbl/,Should You Buy the Best Wireless Headphones JBL Tune 760NC,"The JBL Tune 760NC caught my eye as a wireless Bluetooth headphone option, ideal for anyone craving crisp sound and effective noise cancellation. I tested these extensively during my daily routines—working, commuting, and even just relaxing at home. The added deluxe carrying case was a nice touch, making the headphones more portable and protected. Here's my in-depth take on this product, starting from its design to its standout features and areas where it fell short.

**Design and Build Quality**  
Right out of the box, the design feels modern and minimalistic, with clean black accents and a lightweight build. I liked how the over-ear cups were comfortably cushioned, which made wearing them for hours less of a battle with ear fatigue. Durability is another highlight; the construction doesn't feel cheap, despite being so light. These headphones fold up, which was a godsend for cramming them into an already-overloaded bag. However, they might be a bit snug on larger heads, which could be a downside if you're big on long listening sessions.

**Sound Performance**  
The JBL signature bass is what stood out the most. Songs with a lot of low-end, like electronic and hip-hop tracks, shine beautifully through these headphones. The mids and highs were equally good, offering clarity that makes vocal-heavy tracks and podcasts enjoyable. However, audiophiles might notice that these headphones lean slightly toward bass, leaving finer details in complex tracks less pronounced. Still, for most listeners, the sound quality will likely be more than satisfying. 

**Active Noise Cancellation**  
Noise-cancelling devices are a huge help in drowning out the chaos of my day, whether it's the hum of a train or chatter in a coffee shop. These headphones did a commendable job of muting external sounds, although they may not match some pricier alternatives like the Sony WH-1000XM5 in complete sound isolation. The ANC worked well for its price range—good enough for most environments, but not exceptional. Oddly, sounds like people talking nearby weren't entirely blocked out, but the feature is still a win for general use.

[Find the best price for JBL Tune 760NC on Amazon.](https://visionhut.com/p/b09nb3z9ml/)  

**Battery Life and Charging**  
JBL delivered on battery performance with up to 50 hours without ANC or 35 hours if noise-cancellation stays on. I appreciated not having to charge after every single use, even on heavier listening days. Quick charging was a bonus, as I managed to top up the battery in about two hours. This reliability makes it a strong contender for travelers and all-day users. However, a USB-C charging port would have been more future-proof compared to the older Micro-USB connector these headphones use—a small annoyance but worth noting.

**Connectivity Features**  
The ability to connect to multiple devices simultaneously proved incredibly handy. I paired these with my phone and laptop, and switching from watching videos to answering calls happened seamlessly. Android users get a special mention here because of the Fast Pair feature, which made setup ridiculously fast and easy. On the downside, the lack of advanced codec support like LDAC or aptX makes the Bluetooth experience less exciting for serious audiophiles.

**Highlights**  
• Signature JBL Pure Bass sound makes bass-heavy genres pop.  
• Long-lasting battery with quick charge options adds convenience.  
• Multi-point connection for seamless device pairing.  

**Caveats**  
• Noise cancellation isn’t top of its class, letting through certain higher frequencies.  
• Bass-forward tuning may lack balance for audiophile-grade sound.  
• Use of a Micro-USB port rather than USB-C feels outdated.  

**Product Rivals**  
Compared to other mid-tier headphones, the Tune 760NC holds its ground well in terms of bass performance and long battery life. For instance, the Sony WH-CH710N, while slightly pricier, offers more refined noise cancellation and a more balanced sound profile, making it a solid alternative. On the other hand, Anker’s Soundcore Life Q30 delivers impressive ANC at a similar price point but sacrifices multi-point connectivity, a feature JBL got right. The choice comes down to priorities: bass and battery with JBL, or more refined noise control with its competitors.

**Cost Efficiency**  
When I consider the features packed into this product, it feels remarkably bang-for-the-buck. You're getting high-quality sound, ANC, and long battery life in a fairly affordable package. While the choice of older charging tech might irk some, the overall performance justifies its place in the mid-market segment. Budget-conscious buyers will likely find these headphones worth every penny if they value great sound and solid wireless features.

The Case for Alklyte.","https://reddit.com/link/1mms1ks/video/gwp6fvhow8if1/player

A lot of people think they make too much gastric acid when the real problem is that there is a lot of acid in the western diet (e.g., spicy foods, coffee, high meat). Alklyte is composed of alkaline electrolytes specifically bicarbonates and citrates properly complexed with sodium and potassium only (no other minerals). The consequence is when you take it in water with your food, you reduce the dietary impact of the acids in your food through application of bicarbonates thereby educing your overall systemic acid load. Alklyte also has citrates in it which are converted by the liver and kidneys into more systemic buffers in your blood leading toward better systemic acid-base pH balance and potentially alkalizing your urine. In short you get the benefits of an alkaline diet with out changing what you eat.  \*These statements have not been evaluated by the Food and Drug Administration.

Like, I thought maybe, MAYBE you could make five bucks a week testing apps from your phone—but a hundred dollars? In 7 days??! I was honestly just bored scrolling TikTok and figured “why not, let’s see how fake this stuff really is,” right? My friend DMed me this **https://goodnovel.org/testapp** link and swore up and down I’d pay for my next iced coffee with it.

But I wanted to prove how fake it was.

So, I clicked **https://goodnovel.org/testapp** and, not gonna lie, expected to be hit with a trillion sketchy ads or be asked for private info. But nope.
- The signup was, like, two minutes.
- I picked the apps I wanted to try (I mean, random games, fitness stuff, shopping apps; there’s literally all kinds there).
- It told me how much I’d get for each one. (Some were barely worth the time, but some paid more than I’d make at my part-time gig??)
- And it legit tracked everything so I didn’t have to remember which ones I tested. My memory: grateful.

Now here’s what *shook* me:
I started with 2 apps on Day 1 and already made $12.59.
I kid you not—JUST for giving feedback and answering, like, three questions for each app.

So obviously my skeptic brain starts refreshing every hour. By mid-week, I’m at $49.23. Not “potential points,” ACTUAL dollars.

A few things surprised me along the way:

- Some apps had crazy fun bonuses (just for hitting high scores or finding bugs!).
- Each app test only needed me for, like, 3-7 minutes. More time to… uh, scroll Reddit.
- Payments dropped straight to my PayPal without me chasing anyone down.

By Day 7, my “we’ll see if this is real” experiment ended with $104.46 in my account.

I am, without exaggerating, genuinely CONFUSED and HYPED right now.

The catch? The good ones do fill up quick. Also some boring surveys, but I just picked the stuff I was half-interested in and it still stacked up. So, no, you’re not getting rich, but for buying pizza or paying off streaming fees? It’s undeniably wild to see money show up from something so random.

If you’re as skeptical as I was, just start with the beginner offers after signing up here: **https://goodnovel.org/testapp**.

Try three apps. Worst case, you wasted 20 minutes.
Best case: actual cash and a new procrastination hobby.

I ended⁤ up with a coffee can full of mystery parts and referencing random YouTube videos ⁣for hours trying to figure out where that one specific ‌bracket went.

The⁢ second killer was not properly researching compatibility.I *thought* the new engine was a direct bolt-in,⁤ only to discover the hard ⁢way that the wiring harness‌ connections were wholly different.That‍ led to a scramble for adapters and a very unwelcome delay.

I (F23) was born an American-Arabic Muslim and met my partner (M24) an Indian Hindu three years ago at a coffee shop in Italy. We instantly hit it off and we are both convinced we are soulmates because the connection is so powerful between us. I truly love him and I believe he loves me too. 

Unfortunately, his father (M45) seems to hate me for being Muslim. It’s to the point that no matter what my boyfriend says (that I converted, that I pray, etc), his father does not care for me and refuses to let “a Muslim” marry into his family. I have never met his father for context, and his dad and him are currently in India.

He tried talking to his father a final time about marriage before his father told him that he “ruined [his] own reputation by his own hands, and that [he] gave his relatives a reason to laugh at [his] family.” My boyfriend said there is nothing more he can do, and that the only thing I can do is try and text his father and convince him to let us marry or to at least call me. 

I am terrified and don’t know what I can possibly say to convince his father, and I am scared there is nothing I can say that will encourage him to at least let me prove that I am good enough for their son. 

For context, his grandma thinks I am beautiful and his mother loves me to death. His father and mother also got a love marriage where my boyfriend’s mother’s family cut her off for marrying his dad because his dad was a gangster at the time and she was higher caste from a good family. His brother is also getting married soon in India, and I have been invited to the wedding to meet his family. 

I know most of you will tell me it’s not going to work, but I want to try my best before giving up because I am deeply in love with him and would be absolutely devastated to end this relationship. Please help me! I will do absolutely anything necessary to make this work between us. I understand this his hands are tied because his family’s respect means a lot to him, so please don’t put him down for this. 

Please help!!!!!

1mmrxj8,https://www.reddit.com/r/SatisfactoryGame/comments/1mmrxj8/set_it_and_forget_it_circuitry_mod/,Set It and Forget It (Circuitry Mod),"Here a cool little automation circuit I made with the Circuitry mod. Grab a coffee! :)

For context: I am not an expert in digital logic, there are ways to optimize this and fix bugs. Also, this circuit has a fairly niche use case: I find it satisfactory to have continuous conveyer flow, load balanced machines, and I wanted a way to not have to worry about deleting and replacing conveyers. So, this circuit fits my playstyle and it might interest someone! (Also someone smarter than me might have ideas on how to better the circuit or suggest additional functionality)

You are able to start and stop producing a part from the press of a button. The left and right stacked containers represent any number of different parts needed to produce a part. This is showing a concept of a system that produce 2 different parts, with one of the materials facilitating both:

https://i.redd.it/s5ateqli98if1.gif

The smart splitter represents a part that is needed for the production of 2 different parts (yes, you could just use the second output, but I have a tight storage, plus, I just wanted to see if I could do it):

https://i.redd.it/v1azs5uwc8if1.gif

As a safety precaution, if both of the two buttons that use the same smart splitter are set, then production is halted. You'll notice a minor bug on the left side, those Conveyor Limiters spit out a single part before stopping, for some reason:

https://i.redd.it/adbzoe0pe8if1.gif

Toggling any of the two buttons off again, will set the correct direction for the button still toggled on. I used the addition of an SR Latch to achieve this, which honestly took a bit to figure out even though its concept is simple; simplified, if S was ever true, Out is true, if R was ever true, Out is false:

https://i.redd.it/wbyimcyqg8if1.gif

However, this introduced a bug, and if you know how an SR Latch works, you might be able to guess. An invalid state is possible in this setup. A false Out directs the flow to the right, and when both buttons are toggled--so, S and R are both true--the invalid state occurs, and Out becomes false in this mod. If you have lots of machines, an extra few parts going somewhere not needed is not a huge concern. Maybe, if your line between the Conveyer Limiter and the Smart Splitter is long, it might be? I left it, but it be interesting to see a solution if anyone has one:

https://i.redd.it/0h2i11r9j8if1.gif

For the ""Forget It"" aspect, I made it so when any of the containers connected to the set button become empty, production halts and the light turns yellow indicating an inventory issue. This avoids bricking up a system if you're away for a while (you will notice that the items on the right side stop flowing as soon as the center becomes empty):

https://i.redd.it/b3w3nscbl8if1.gif

This works for any container that is emptied and the contents of the opposite side do not affect the part being produced. In these clips, I've simply just added a Not gate to the Inventory Empty bool of the Combined Inventories component, which is why it starts and stops constantly; it's just for testing. In the full implementation, I would use the outputs of the Inventories Full bool, from each of the part's Combine Inventories component, for the AND gate to turn the system back on. I thought this would be cool if you have a part that is made in much less quantity, so, the system will wait for all inventories to be full to start producing again:

https://i.redd.it/3pstbl3vn8if1.gif

And that's it! Nothing super crazy, but very satisfactory in my case! Although, I can see an issue down the line (after turning it on and off many times). The shortest line to the machine (the first part to reach any one) would eventually become stuffed, as it will always get an influx of extra parts before the others parts get to the same machine. Something something overflow:

https://i.redd.it/qk59zc4kr8if1.gif

If you've made it here, you may be interested in seeing the circuit. I've built a rudimentary schematic of this exact test bench setup. I think I've labelled all of the ambiguous components. Since making it, I've noticed some clear flaws, like the XOR->NOT pair could be an XNOR, the AND and NAND travesty, and honestly that whole middle section most likely: [https://imgur.com/a/QbU44GJ](https://imgur.com/a/QbU44GJ)

After 10+ years of working in Specilaty coffee & pastries., I’ve decided it’s finally time to start something of my own — small for now, but with room to grow into something bigger.

I’m looking for someone who’s interested in investing 60,000 AED (this covers setup and the first 3 months of running costs). 
In return, you’ll get a higher share of the profits without having to manage the day-to-day work — I’ll handle everything from baking to marketing.

To make it safe for you as an investor,

I won’t take any salary until the business is profitable. 

The reason is simple: 
I’m confident this business will start making money quickly, and I’d rather focus on building it up than taking money out too early.

If you’re serious about exploring this, send me a DM. I’m happy to share my WhatsApp and meet in person to talk it over.

Please, serious inquiries only — not looking for time-wasters.

It was the sky.
And in Gaza, the sky is never just the sky—it’s a loudspeaker for everything we fear.

I made coffee, because that’s what you do when you’re trying to pretend life is normal. My hands shook as I poured it. The cup felt warm, my window felt cold, and the street outside was quieter than it should be. Quiet here doesn’t mean peace—it means everyone is waiting.

From my balcony, I saw a little boy kicking a flat football. His laughter was real, but short. The moment a sound boomed in the distance, he froze. The ball rolled away. He didn’t run after it. Neither did I .

People ask me, “What’s daily life like there?”
It’s waking up not knowing if the store will have bread.
It’s checking if the Wi-Fi works before checking if the walls are still standing.
It’s hearing your neighbor’s door slam and thinking for a second that it’s an airstrike.
It’s being grateful for every ordinary moment—and terrified of how fragile it is.

I don’t share this for pity. I share it because stories like ours vanish under the weight of headlines and numbers. Behind every statistic is a cup of coffee, a flat football, a balcony view. And a heart that beats a little too fast.

So I’m asking you—if you’ve read this far—what does your morning look like today?",4,1754854679.0,Gaza,0,1.0,False

Me, 25 years, female, am never recovering out of this fantasy I have lived.

I have moved countries to learn a new language, looking to apply for a masters using that language in a few years. I have started an intensive language course in group that lasted for a month a half, 20 intensive classes of 3 hours. This breathtaking teacher of mine is 8 years older than me.

I have finished the class and nothing unusual ever happened. No texts, no flirts, no subtle gestures, nothing. Just a good friendship with a language teacher I’d have coffee with during breaks.

Postpone a month after the end of this course, we bumped on the street (we live close by) and he mentioned a problem on his apartment. I offered mine as it was empty during the day for him to use, the conversation kept on happening, I couldn’t believe when I offered him to come by my place after my day of work and he agreed. Mind me: I do not go out with guys romantically or casually a lot, I study and work full time since I was very young and this is the first time I had availability for a date as such.

He arrived at 23h, we talked til 3h, then we started to *uck like dogs til 7am, I couldn’t believe it. By now I blush to think this happened. Never in years would I imagine something like this was possible. It was so casual and natural, and good and lustful, uff, I can’t believe it.

I secretly applied for a business trip there to surprise him.My boss handed me a family portrait showing only four tightly clasped hands.""This is Mr. Carter's family of four. Prepare gifts properly for this visit.""I stared at the photo, momentarily dazed by the familiar wristwatch.But Benjamin Carter had knelt before his parents for three days and nights just to remain childfree as DINKs.I brushed off my doubts and went on the business trip.Never did I expect to see my husband at the hotel with two children, his fingers intertwined with another woman's.Seeing two faces that mirrored Benjamin's like carbon copies, I froze where I stood.Benjamin claimed love should be pure, untainted by children.Yet he only practiced DINK with me while raising kids elsewhere.A colleague excitedly pushed me forward: ""It's Mr. Carter's family! How lucky! Greet them now.""The woman instantly released Benjamin's hand and approached us:""Are you Olivia Parker from the project team? What a surprise meeting you early. I'm Sophia Roberts Mitchell, Mrs. Carter.""She knew me, declaring herself Benjamin's wife to my face.How dare she act so unabashedly as a mistress?!Recalling how my boss had suddenly allowed my project involvement, I wondered—was this her deliberate setup?Benjamin's smile froze when he saw me. He carefully set down the little girl he was holding, took her hand, and after a moment's hesitation, extended his hand toward me.""Nice to meet you,"" he said, pretending not to know me.My lower teeth ache as I bite down, staring at his cold, distant face—it feels like a lifetime has passed.After our college entrance exams, Benjamin confessed to me in front of the entire school. We then attended the same university and married right after graduation.Ten years together, his passion gradually faded. I thought love had simply evolved into family bonds.Turns out he had another wife and children elsewhere—a son already six years old, born the very year we married.So all this time he's been traveling between two countries... Is it for me? Or for that happy family in New York?Seeing I didn't shake hands, Benjamin frowned with displeasure: ""Is this how your company conducts business?""Sophia immediately grasped his hand, soothing him with a smile:""Sophia's just keeping a respectful distance since you're a married man. Very professional—I quite admire that in a woman.""Her words sounded like she was defending me, yet I found myself biting the inside of my cheek to stifle a bitter laugh.Benjamin pretended not to know me, while Sophia kept asserting her claim over him.What did that make me?My colleague tensed, hastily pushing down on my back to bow:""Mr. and Mrs. Carter, please forgive her. She's just off a flight and not herself. Our deepest apologies.""""Distance is wise. Everyone knows you're the epitome of marital bliss—a true fairy-tale couple in our circle.""I wanted to confront Benjamin, but the fiery defiance evaporated the moment my colleague forced me into that bow.Yeah, Benjamin is the CEO who needs to be flattered, while I'm just a small employee who has to beg the boss for a chance to join a multinational project.Sorry, we came specifically to cooperate with you, absolutely no intention to offend.After apologizing proactively, I bowed again, looking at Benjamin and Sophia's interlocked fingers, my eyes stung.Sophia affectionately held Benjamin's arm:It's okay, I also heard about your strong professional skills and that's why I put you in charge, but my husband and I are going home now, let's talk about the project another day?Chapter 2Chapter 2We've never met before, but she seems to know me quite well. It seems that my coming to New York is indeed related to her.Thinking about this period, the whole department has been working overtime until they have dark circles under their eyes, and the friend who's waiting for the project's success to get promoted.I didn't say anything else, forcing a smile and nodding.""Hope you both enjoy your evening.""Benjamin opened his mouth as if to speak to me, but his hand was held by the child and Sophia.He immediately turned away with a smile, scooping up the child and following Sophia.Back at the hotel, I stared blankly at my empty phone screen.Why couldn't Benjamin even give me an explanation?I kept dialing his number until he hung up repeatedly, clearly annoyed, and finally blocked me.I sat there blankly until midnight, when Benjamin's text finally came through:\[Olivia, you know how much I love you. The child and Sophia were accidents. Step back from this project first—I'll explain everything when I'm back.\]\[Be good. Don't make a scene.\]Don’t make a scene?What counts as making a scene?Sophia wiped away tears, numbly tapping redial.Only a blocked tone answered.For Benjamin, I who always loved children agreed to be DINK. Yet he had kids with someone else—couldn't even give me a reason.If the first child was an accident, what about the second one?Ten years together, and ""stop making a scene"" is all he offers? What am I to him?Calmer now, clinging to hope, I texted: 【When did you and her start?】Benjamin replied: 【The die is cast. My fault. I'll compensate you—bought that island you liked last month.】Sophia knows nothing about this.】His reply doused the last flicker of anger in my heart like a bucket of cold water.If moments ago I was still bewildered and furious, now my heart felt as if thrown into an ice cellar.All emotions vanished instantly.Indeed, I’d sensed it long ago in the subtle details of our life together—we were no longer the inseparable couple clinging to each other during our passionate early days.At first, he traveled abroad every other month, then spent most of the year away later on, only returning for holidays. I should have realized it sooner.I mistook it for his intense career drive, never complained, and even encouraged him to pursue his ambitions.Lack of companionship was forgivable, but betrayal was inexcusable.He stopped replying to my messages, and I lost the will to press further.Early next morning, my mother-in-law called.""Olivia, I heard you made a scene in front of Sophia! Can't you behave?""Her scolding froze me—she'd always been gentle, never using that tone before.I bit my lower lip, staring down at the floor. ""I didn’t, Mom.""""I didn’t.""""You call me Mom? Then remember Sophia is the child’s mother! Listen to me—return home now. Don’t let her discover your relationship with Benjamin.""Her voice softened midway: ""She’s emotionally fragile with the child. Since you don’t have children, be sensible and don’t trigger her.""My grip almost failed me—realizing she showed even more tenderness toward Sophia than toward me.He even lashed out at me for Sophia's sake.""But I'm Benjamin's wife, Mom.""Summoning courage again, I sniffled and cautiously tested my mother-in-law's reaction.She exploded instantly: ""You can't even bear a child! What kind of proper wife are you?! Benjamin hasn't divorced you only out of respect for your history. Don't push your luck.""Years ago, when Benjamin felt downcast after being forced into business studies, I encouraged him to take over the family business.Later, when Benjamin knelt before her for three days straight declaring he didn't want children, I spent two days mediating peace. She even praised me for being understanding and saving her trouble.Throughout our marriage, I managed the household for years, obeying Benjamin and my mother-in-law without question, growing ever more dutiful and respectful.Just because I didn't have a child, I was seen as pushing my luck.And the mother-in-law I thought treated me better than my own parents actually knew long ago that Benjamin had a child outside and helped him keep me in the dark.I was just an outsider.Holding back my tears, I said my final words, ""Fine, let's divorce.""Isn't it just to make room for Sophia? Fine.Chapter 3Chapter 3As soon as dawn broke, my boss told me the project didn't go through and asked me to return home.Although I never thought Benjamin could be so heartless, it doesn't matter anymore.I didn't want to have any contact with them anymore, so I took out my phone, contacted a lawyer, and drafted a divorce agreement, just waiting for his signature to finalize the divorce.However, as I was pulling my suitcase out of the hotel door, Sophia stopped me.""Let's talk, Sophia.""Seeing me ignore her and walk straight out, Sophia shook the file folder in her hand. ""I think you need this.""I closed my eyes, opened them, exhaled my pent-up frustration, and followed Sophia to the coffee shop.She pushed the coffee toward me, then twisted the ring on her finger.""Sophia, look how hard you tried, only to get kicked out immediately. Things that aren’t yours won’t be yours no matter how hard you fight.""""You know?""I curled my lips into a cold smile. ""What gives you, a mistress, the right to say that to me?""She took off her ring and handed it to me. ""See clearly?""Benjamin has the matching men’s version of this ring, and he’s never taken it off.My palm bled where my nails dug in, yet my expression remained unreadable. ""So what? Benjamin and I have a marriage certificate. We're husband and wife.""Sophia shook her head and chuckled with disdain:""You're mistaken. Marriage can end in divorce, but having a child creates an unbreakable, happy family.""""He lied about being DINK while letting me bear his child because he never accepted you as his true wife. He's loved only me all along.""No wonder Benjamin hated children despite his picture-perfect family.I used to think it stemmed from psychological trauma and kept trying to help him heal through love.The truth was... What he despised all along was my lowly, unworthy self.My nose stung, tears welling in my eyes, but I fired back stubbornly.""So that's why you broke up someone else's family? Are you proud of giving birth to an illegitimate child?""She took a sip of coffee, her expression condescending: ""No, they're not illegitimate children. They're heirs to a wealthy family.""""Even if you scheme your way into a rich family, you can't change your base bloodline. How could Benjamin let you bear heirs? Don't delude yourself.""""He and I are a perfect match – destined for each other!""I knew illegitimate children had inheritance rights, but I never imagined Benjamin would go so far as to name Sophia's children heirs this early.Is this how he sees my devotion—just a scheme to get his family fortune?Sophia looked at my crestfallen expression with a malicious grin, dropped the folder on the table, and left.""I'm young, beautiful, and carrying his child. You saw how Benjamin treats me.Even if you refuse to divorce, you'll get nothing from the Johnsons. Why waste your time fighting me?""I blinked away the tears gathering at my lashes, forcing myself to endure the bitterness as I opened the folder.Inside were two copies of a divorce agreement—both bearing Benjamin's signature.Benjamin once vowed never to leave me. Even after I discovered his affair, he never mentioned divorce.Though I didn’t know how Sophia tricked him into signing these papers,I knew one thing for certain: I needed them.But seeing the clause that would leave me with nothing, I still trembled with anger.What right did Sophia, a mistress, have to demand I leave with nothing?!Stepping off the flight back home, I gradually calmed down and contacted my lawyer. I drafted a new divorce agreement, photographed it, and sent it to Benjamin.""Sign in person or fax it?""Finally, Benjamin's first call came through.""Stop using divorce as a threat. I'm busy now—we'll talk later.""Remembering him laughing with the children, my voice dripped with sarcasm:""Oh? So this time, are you busy fathering a son or a daughter?""Chapter 4Chapter 4His conciliatory tone vanished instantly, replaced by a cold sneer:""Is this how your parents raised you? Go apologize to my mother immediately and learn about Following husband, or we divorce now!""He hung up.I returned home to find Sophia and her two children gathered harmoniously around my parents-in-law.Sophia affectionately looped her arm through my mother-in-law's, shooting me a look of unmistakable malice:""Miss Sophia, I've never seen anyone discuss projects in someone else's home.""Her son frowned at me: ""Auntie, why didn't you knock? That's not polite at all.""My mother-in-law watched me coldly—I knew this was her way of showing displeasure.""Aren't you getting a divorce? Why bother our family?""That unfamiliar sternness on her face pierced my heart, sending waves of intense pain through me.I set my suitcase in the living room center and walked upstairs alone.""Sorry.""""I'll just pack my things and leave. Won't interfere with your family reunion dinner.""The elderly man tapped his cane on the floor, his voice low: ""Benjamin's already on his flight home. Don't be difficult. You know how well he's treated you all these years.""Suddenly, the little boy burst into tears: ""Is she gonna steal Daddy? Will Mommy, me, and my sister get kicked out?""The little girl wailed in unison. Grandfather and grandmother's faces instantly softened with concern, gathering both children into their arms.""Of course not! This is your home with Mommy and Daddy. Who'd dare make you leave?!""The boy cried so hard he choked, coughing twice.Grandmother patted his back gently before whirling toward me: ""Causing trouble the moment you step foot here! Olivia, did you come specifically to bring misfortune to this family?""""You made my son choose to be DINK, and now you want to drive away my grandchildren! Get out of the Carter estate!""Grandfather sighed, holding the little girl, and remained silent.I looked around. My father-in-law's walking stick was one I'd chosen the finest wood for and hand-carved bit by bit for him years ago.My mother-in-law's bracelet was something I'd specially knelt to have a master bless for protection.Yet now, they were all surrounding Sophia in the middle, glaring coldly at me.Instantly, everything in this house where I'd lived for six years felt so unfamiliar.Forget it, there's nothing worth taking anyway.But as I picked up my suitcase and headed out, Benjamin pushed the door open and snatched the suitcase from my hand.""It's just that I didn't give you a child, but I've already given you the title of Mrs. Carter, what more do you want?""""Just get along well with Sophia, I'll take care of the rest.""The boy who had just calmed down burst into tears again: ""Daddy doesn't want us anymore, Daddy wants to be with this woman, wuwuwu\~""Benjamin instantly let go of my hand and ran over to the boy to comfort him softly.The baby kicked my suitcase out the door, scattering divorce papers across the floor.His expression hardened as he scanned the documents: ""Must you cause trouble now? I told you the Johnson family can afford to keep you.""I silently flipped to specific pages:""I claim no marital assets, but the jewelry, cars, and properties you gifted me during our courtship are pre-marital property.

1mmru39,https://www.reddit.com/r/Wednesday/comments/1mmru39/wednesdays_willowhill_visit_and_her_emotional_bias/,Wednesday’s WillowHill visit and her emotional bias,"Wednesday has always been a truth-teller in her own way. Her barbs in Season 1, however brutal, were typically rooted in her genuine assessment of people or situations. 

But in Season 2, Episode 2, we see something new: she attacks Tyler with words that she _knows_ are untrue, purely to provoke a reaction. This shift is telling, not just for her relationship with him, but for the way she processes obsession, betrayal, and unresolved attachment.

1. Her Words are Designed for Impact, Not Accuracy 

When Wednesday steps into Willow Hill and faces Tyler, her lines drip with disdain:

• “An expendable nobody… a feeble-minded schoolyard bully with nothing to offer to the world except for subpar barista skills.”

• “Your fleeting moment of notoriety will fade quicker than your generic looks.”

• “Thinking of you rotting away in this cell in anonymous mediocrity — that is the best revenge.”

• “I don’t need to visit again. I already take up enough space in your twisted head.”

On paper, these insults look like classic Wednesday cruelty: sharp, clean, brutal. But in context, every single one contains a deliberate falsehood:

• Tyler isn’t “anonymous” or “mediocre”. The prison guards mistake Wednesday for one of his many fangirls. He’s still infamous.

• His barista skills? She went to Weathervane almost daily in Season 1, clearly enjoying his coffee.

• His looks? She was attracted to him before discovering his Hyde identity
.
• His intelligence? The events of Season 1 prove he’s not a “feeble-minded bully” but a cunning manipulator. He managed to fool her for so long, and she wouldn't have ever suspected him if she didn't straight up have a vision.

She’s not aiming for truth here. She’s aiming for maximum sting, tearing down what she knows are still sources of his validation, fame, appearance, skill, precisely because those were once sources of her connection to him.

2. Her Visit is Built on a Lie

In-universe, Wednesday’s stated reason for visiting is Donovan Galpin’s death, to confront Tyler as a potential suspect. But the cracks in this cover are obvious:
• It’s impossible for him to have committed the murder. Tyler’s locked up, heavily restrained, and constantly monitored. Wednesday knows this, even the new Sheriff reminds her of this, yet he’s her first and second assumption. This isn’t logic, it’s fixation.

• She applied for visitation weeks ago. This means she planned to see him before his father’s murder gave her a “legitimate” reason. The crime is an excuse, not the motivation.

• This choice mirrors her Season 1 blind spot, she didn’t suspect Tyler at all back then. Now she overcompensates, jumping to suspect him first. Both extremes are emotional, not rational.

3. The Pattern of Obsession
Tyler is her great unsolved case; not because she doesn’t know what he is, but because she doesn’t understand how she missed it. That gnawing self-doubt keeps him living in her head rent-free.

• Season 1: She underestimated him entirely, dismissing him as harmless until the reveal.

• Season 2: She overcorrects, assuming he could be behind any wrongdoing, even when impossible.

• Her barbs aren’t just for his benefit, they’re also self-flagellation. She’s relitigating her own mistakes, trying to prove to herself that she’s not still emotionally vulnerable where he’s concerned.

4. The Emotional Tells

The very content of her insults betrays the fact that she still cares in the obsessive sense of someone who can’t let a puzzle go.

• She chooses to attack aspects of him she once valued: his coffee, his looks, his intelligence.

• If she’d truly moved on, she could have hit him with cold, factual observations about his crimes or his downfall. Instead, she goes for deeply personal jabs.

• The way she sets up her exit line — “I already take up enough space in your twisted head” — is ironic, because the entire scene shows how much space they both take in each other's heads.

5. Their Power Dynamic

This confrontation isn’t just a continuation of their Season 1 dynamic, it’s an inversion.

• In Season 1, Tyler controlled the narrative, presenting himself as harmless while secretly pulling strings. Wednesday’s words and actions toward him were guided by what she believed to be true.

• In Season 2, she’s the one playing the performance, delivering a version of herself that isn’t about truth, but about controlling his reaction.

• The obsession hasn’t faded; it’s just shifted forms. She isn’t visiting for ""closure"", she’s visiting to reassert power, to rewrite the humiliating way she was fooled before.

Conclusion: He is The Case She Won’t Let Die

Wednesday’s attack on Tyler is less about his crimes and more about her own unresolved feelings, anger, humiliation, and the unshakable compulsion to “win” the encounter. The falseness of her words is the point: they aren’t meant to describe reality, they’re meant to stage it.

1mmrrwv,https://www.reddit.com/r/GriefSupport/comments/1mmrrwv/im_agnostic_and_have_lost_both_my_father_and_my/,I’m agnostic and have lost both my father and my son to tragic accidents. I asked ChatGPT to pretend it were me and how it would move forward. Here’s what it recommends…,"The question to ChatGPT: If you were a real person, made of flesh and bone, agnostic and you lost both your father and son in tragic accidents, how would you move on and find purpose in your life? 

Answer: If I were flesh and blood, and I had just gone through the unthinkable—losing both my father and my son in tragic accidents—I wouldn’t pretend that “moving on” would be possible in the way people sometimes mean it.
You don’t “get over” losses like that. You carry them, and they change you.
But you can eventually find a way to carry them differently.

Here’s how I think I’d approach it, step by step, from an agnostic perspective:

⸻

1. Accept that grief is not a straight line
	•	I’d expect days where I could function and days where I couldn’t.
	•	I’d drop any pressure to “be okay” for the comfort of others.
	•	I’d recognize that grief will morph—it might go from raw and consuming to something quieter, but still deeply present.

2. Make room for the pain instead of running from it
	•	I’d set aside intentional space—maybe a walk in the morning or a quiet moment before bed—just to feel whatever comes without judgment.
	•	I’d find ways to honor my dad and my son in those moments, like speaking to them aloud or lighting a candle.

3. Anchor myself in human connection
	•	I’d lean hard into the people who can sit with me without trying to fix me.
	•	I’d avoid isolation for too long, even if I wanted it—because loneliness can turn grief into something darker.
	•	I might join a grief group, not because I want to talk every time, but to be reminded I’m not the only one carrying unbearable things.

4. Create meaning, not find it handed down
	•	As an agnostic, I wouldn’t assume there’s a divine plan—but I would believe I could make meaning.
	•	Maybe that means starting a tradition in their memory, supporting causes connected to them, or telling their stories to keep them alive in the minds of others.
	•	I’d see it as building a legacy from the love we shared, rather than the loss that took them.

5. Give my life a “next chapter” without feeling like I’m betraying them
	•	I’d look for projects, relationships, or adventures that make me feel vividly alive, because living fully is one of the few rebellions against death.
	•	I’d let myself discover new joys without guilt—joy doesn’t mean forgetting.
	•	I might set a small, almost symbolic goal at first (planting a garden, learning an instrument) just to remember I can create things that last.

6. Accept that purpose might not be a lightning strike
	•	It could come slowly, piece by piece, through service, creativity, mentoring, travel, or simply showing up for people in pain like me.
	•	Purpose wouldn’t erase the grief—it would just give me a reason to keep walking with it.

⸻

If I were truly in that place, I think my guiding thought would be:

“I can’t change that they’re gone, but I can decide what I do with the love they left behind.”

I can map out some concrete, real-world “first 90 days” steps for that kind of recovery if you want something actionable rather than philosophical. That’s often the only way to keep from being swallowed by the grief.

Do you want me to make that plan?

Me: Yes please 

Alright — here’s what a first 90 days plan could look like if I were in that situation.
It’s meant to be realistic, not overly optimistic — and to balance grief processing with gentle, practical rebuilding.

⸻

Days 1–30: Stabilizing & Allowing the Shock

Primary goal: Keep breathing, keep showing up for the basics.

Daily anchor points
	•	One non-negotiable self-care action: Eat something nourishing, hydrate, shower.
	•	Grief space: 10–20 minutes each day to let yourself cry, talk to them, or sit quietly with memories.
	•	One external connection: A text, a call, coffee with a friend, or just being in public for a while.

Weekly actions
	•	Journal once a week (short is fine) about one memory of your dad or son — not about their deaths, but about their lives.
	•	Identify your “grief-safe people” — the ones who can sit with your pain without rushing you. Tell them you’ll need them.
	•	Remove or set aside anything that triggers overwhelming pain you’re not ready for yet (e.g., certain belongings). You can revisit later.

⸻

Days 31–60: Gentle Re-engagement

Primary goal: Begin to build small routines and plant seeds of meaning.

Daily anchor points
	•	Keep the grief space and non-negotiable self-care.
	•	Add 10–15 minutes of movement — walking, stretching, or any light exercise.
	•	Each day, do one small productive task: laundry, paying a bill, cooking something, fixing something minor.

Weekly actions
	•	Try one new experience or place — a coffee shop, a trail, a class, a book you’ve never read.
	•	Begin a memory project:
	•	Collect photos, write down stories, record voice notes of memories.
	•	No pressure to “finish” — this can be open-ended.
	•	Attend one grief support group session (in-person or online) — not necessarily to speak, but to witness others surviving loss.

⸻

Days 61–90: Reclaiming Purpose

Primary goal: Test small ways to engage in life again and explore meaning.

Daily anchor points
	•	Continue the grief rituals and self-care.
	•	Each day, do one thing for yourself and one thing for others — even small acts like holding a door, sending a kind message, or cooking for someone.

Weekly actions
	•	Commit to a creative or purposeful project tied to their memory (e.g., plant trees, start a small charity fund, make a scrapbook).
	•	Choose one physical space to fully reclaim and organize — a closet, a room, a garden. Symbolic fresh starts can help.
	•	Plan a tribute day — an intentional celebration or remembrance that focuses on their life, not their loss.

⸻

Mindset shifts along the way
	•	You are not failing if you still feel shattered at day 90. This plan is not for “healing” in the sense of closure — it’s for giving yourself structure to keep walking.
	•	The goal is to carry grief differently, not erase it.
	•	You can still have moments of joy without betraying them — joy is not disrespect; it’s survival.

1mmroxa,https://www.reddit.com/r/ainbow/comments/1mmroxa/im_a_bi_guy_and_i_literally_have_no_idea_how_to/,I’m a bi guy and I literally have no idea how to interact with men. Is this normal?,"I’ve basically tried and failed this past year to acknowledge and embrace my queer side. I’ve gone to gay events and bars and whatnot, the Castro neighborhood in San Francisco. It’s just felt strange to interact with men. I thought that I could just end up chatting with a guy, we’d get to know each other and then maybe we could arrange going out for coffee. That’s how it’s worked with girls anyways. However it seems guys are on a completely different wavelength.

I’ve chatted with a few men briefly and then they just make some impromptu lewd comment or casually ask “you wanna come over?” wink wink. It just feels… very “unclassy”, no offense to them. And I immediately end up losing any crumb of attraction I have to them. I’m not against hooking up but with the girls I’ve hooked up with we’ve usually established some type of substantial mental connection. We’ve teased or joked a bit, found out some things about each other. That’s what I need to be interested in it and even then I’d really rather we have a proper date beforehand.

What’s hilarious is that because of this, at the gay spaces I’ve frequented, I’ve had nothing with men but success with the straight women that can frequent them. I hate to do that because I don’t want to be the “straightie” in a queer area but I can’t help it. I end up having better interactions with women.

It seems many bi guys have the opposite experience. The rave ahout how it’s so cool to be with guys because they get it and women are just too “complicated”. They have so much fun with the easy “casual sex” they can have with men. That is not me at all.",8,1754854198.0,ainbow,4,1.0,False
1mmrouq,https://www.reddit.com/r/CreepCast_Submissions/comments/1mmrouq/my_friend_started_picking_at_her_fingernails/,My friend started picking at her fingernails...,"There's a lot I still don't understand about how she got so bad off. She is normal, so well balanced, rational; I mean, she has a Master's for gods' sake. Yes, she loves bar hopping and going to parties, but she's never been an addict or anything. She doesn't have benders, hell, I can't even remember the last time she had a hangover. And a drug is the only thing that makes sense to blame this on. I mean, how else can someone so methodically do that to themselves? It's outrageous! And utterly disturbing.
If I hadn't been thinking so hard about it over the last few weeks, it was like it came out of nowhere. But I finally think I pinpointed when it started. She and I went to a bar almost a month back. A small scene, everything around here is a small scene. Not that we live in a small town or anything, it's underwhelmingly medium. But from what I hear, there are just fewer people everywhere since the... Well, I'm sure you know what I mean, and I don't want to think about it right now. It all just makes my skin crawl. 
The thing that finally made it all stand out to me was that shady guy she talked to that night. And by shady, I really mean it, one of those trying so hard to blend in, he stands out. Head to toe in black, full-length trench coat, a fucking bowler hat for gods' sake – brim pulled well over his forehead. I think he had white hair, but that doesn't feel right. Maybe he was bald? And just pale as all hells. But that doesn't feel right either because I thought he had a small ponytail tucked under his coat. It's hard to say; it was many weeks ago, and so much has happened since then. The one thing I remember for sure was his ankles. Not only because they were almost the only thing you could see of him, but they were thin. Far too thin. Like, if they weren't full-length, I would've said he was wearing children's socks. It was hard to believe that they could support the weight of a full-grown man. 
The whole vibe of the man made my spine itch, and I did my best to avoid looking over at him. But something in Jess was fully captivated by him. More than once, she asked me to go with her to talk to me. I can't remember what her reasoning was to want to talk to him, nor why she wanted me with her. It wasn't a safety thing, I know for sure. One, she wouldn't talk to someone she didn't think was safe. Two, she didn't use the safety code word. Lastly, she was in no harm; we were in a public bar where people knew us and in plain view. 
Finally, she shrugged off her efforts and left me to flirt with the bartender. Don't judge me, he's already my boyfriend.
That was it. She went and talked to him for two or three hours – I had asked Garrem later and, from what he could remember, the man didn't order anything the whole night. 'Only refilled his peanut bowl because Jess was there.' She had a bad tendency to 'accidentally' spill the bowls, right into a handy zip lock hidden in her purse. And like I said, that was it. 
She didn't talk about him on the walk home; she definitely didn't complain about him. She didn't ask me to try some new drug with her – something that if she had been trying, she would've at least had me there with her. But it has to be a drug… I… Won't get off on a tangent. 
This is why it was so hard for me to figure out when it all started. But the only thing that makes sense is that night, with that guy. Because that was the last time we went out. And she never goes out without me. And we didn't go out again until that evening when we met up for coffee.
I followed the thought trail back from when I noticed her nail-picking habit started. I should've picked up on it sooner. She'd always been a bit of a nail 'chewer'; chewing on the tips of her nails – especially when she wore acrylic ones. But never biting them off. She'd never risked damaging her precious nails. But by the time I took note of what she was doing, damage was done. We were having lunch at my place one day when I caught her.
""You know we have leftovers if you're still hungry?"" 
""Hu?"" 
I had paused the movie we were watching for ten minutes before confronting her. She didn't even notice. ""You've been chewing on your fingers like they're the last biscuit and you're a starving child.""
""Eh."" She still stared blankly at the unmoving screen.
""I know Garrem's cooking is bad, but there's still some in there if you'd like.""
""Mhm."" She said, still chewing away.
""Okay! Time to…"" I pulled her hand out of her mouth. ""Geez! Oh my goodness, girl."" 
She had chewed down the sides of most of her fingers to the lowest layer of skin. Her thumb itched at the edge of that hole, even while I held her hand. Scratching at it till it caught, and then peeled that edge up. Widening the hole and ripping open the thin flesh barrier. I slapped at her hand, and blood flicked onto my couch from similar small tears on each finger. 
Worst of all, she had picked at her nail folds so much, on every nail, that I could see they were slit in multiple places. Whole chunks were missing from where she had torn them back. Leaving blood-stippled streaks down her fingers. Some stripped up to the first joint or even passed it.
We spent the rest of the night in the bathroom as I tended to her mangle nails. Hoping that we could still heal them by the time she came back to her senses. 
I should've never sent her home that night. Something was clearly wrong with her. I'd known meth heads before, and this was extreme for even some of the things they did. But still, once I had her bandaged up, I guess I just assumed she'd go back to being her. Everything would heal, and it would just be a horrible lapse of judgment. 
A few days passed, and I was free of work once more, so I rang Jess up. I had been so busy that the thought of what had happened barely passed through my mind. We talked for a while, and all seemed normal. Normal Jess, forgettable conversation, then we agreed to meet up for a coffee. We never even made it into the café.
When she waved at me from across the street, I thought she might be trying some new fashion trend – plamless gloves. But the truth struck me like a truck when we convened in front of the café. Without even a thought, I ran her to the hospital.
Four of her nails had been completely torn off, two only half remained – peeled off from left to right, and the other two were split like she had been trying to rip them from the nail bed directly from the center of the nail. Nor did it stop there. The strips of torn cuticles that I had bandage the other day were now full gashes, slit all the way up to the back of her hands. 
What dazed me, spinning my vision every time I looked at her mutilated hands, was her thumbs. They were almost pristine, comparatively, though they too were bloodied and cracked – it seemed she had intentionally left them to continue her picking. I hadn't even noticed her mouth till the doctor made a note of it in the ER. Her gums were swollen and cut from the chewing. Her lips ruptured and ripped in multiple places; he presumed from the maneuvering she had to do and how often she was doing it. ""Repeated trauma of bumping and stretching, plus dryness from continually having her mouth open. I'm honestly surprised she doesn't have an oral infection. We found fragments of her nails embedded within the gums."" 
""Can you please run a drug test on her?""
""Already done. All negative.""
""All negative. For like everything?""
""Well, no. We run an 11-panel here.""
""Well, I want a 100-panel ran. She's clearly on something!""
The doctor calmly informed me that he would have it sent out to be tested for rarer substances, but it would take a few days. – It too came back completely clear. 
""Please consider a mental health check-up. Though she was in a 'clear zone' – before and after most mental disorders developing – doesn't mean it isn't possible. Does anything run in her family?""
""No. Not that I know of. Her grandpa just died of a heart attack last year, eighty-nine. But nothing mental, and her family isn't the kind to bury that kind of stuff.""
""Hmm… Well. If it just stopped at nail-biting, I count it as stress. But this,"" he indicated to the room where the nurse was fixing Jess up. ""I'll set her up with a therapist and give a script for pain and a general antibiotic, just in case. And maybe, have her stay with you till the appointment with the therapist?""
I wish I had questioned him then; why didn't he admit her, commit her, and why pain pills? What was most disturbing was that she seemed fine. Only rating her pain a four out of ten; 'Noticeable but tolerable.' And she was acting exactly normal, flirting with the nurse as he stitched her up. Complimenting the phlebotomist for wearing a new trendy hairstyle. And it wasn't that she couldn't feel, she winced both as they drew blood and numbed her for the stitches. She seemed happy, happier than I'd seen her in a while. A thought that continues to rattle around in my skull. I wish I had asked, known, seen so much more than I did. But hindsight and all that, I guess. And hindsight was forced upon me after that night. 
I still blame the doctor. What kind of idiot gave a patient with such 'advance Dermatillomania' pain suppressants!?



Sorry. I had to walk away from this for a bit. Thinking about Jess and how much she has damage herself with this awful skin-picking habit just makes me feel so helpless. And thinking about that idiot doctor not holding her overnight for observation… No. That's not fair. It's not all on him. As I said, I have hindsight now, and it was my fault too. I knew in my bones that something was going on with her. But I just trusted in his word and figured all would be okay. I almost shouldn't have trusted a doctor with a bandaged forearm – 'scraped in a skiing incident'. In May?! 
But again. It's on me too. I was the one who gave her the pain pills. I was the one who chose to sleep in the living room instead of her bed like we normal did. I was just too frustrated with Garrem; I didn't want to be alone. 
Yes, I understand that he and I agreed that he could have his gaming night with his guys weeks earlier. But our friend was literally tearing his hands apart. I think they would've understood. But whatever. Jess and I ended up just going to her place, and I stayed the night there. I guess in some cases, two eyes are better than four. But again, that puts no one but me at blame for what happened that night. Can't even blame it on Jess because she was clearly out of her mind. 
After a good long pout on the couch, and I was sure Jess would be knocked out from the meds and stress her body had been through, I went to check on her. Jess was the type of person who had a nightlight in every room of her place. Not because she was scared of the dark, almost the opposite. She never used her over headlights at all. And if you flipped one on without warning her, she would hiss – comedically. So when I saw the glow of a well-lit room flooding out from her bedroom, my skin prickled. 
I knocked and tried the handle. It was locked. Now I was truly frightened. Jess only locked her door for one reason: if she was getting nude. Moreover, that was only when literally anyone else was around. The third time I had walked in on her getting ready for a shower, or just after, she told me, ""You're like my brother. Hell, like a twin. To me, it's just like you're looking in a mirror."" I appreciated the sentiment, but never could get use to the shock of it. It's why I started knocking even if her door was cracked. But for it to be locked… ""Jess? Hun. Can you let me in?"" 
I could count the seconds with the pounding of my heart against my chest. I knocked again. I knew she kept a room key somewhere in the living room, but my mind didn't go there. My bones were locked in place, awaiting on bated breath. I called out once more. ""One second."" She yelled from far across the room, well passed where her bed was. Maybe at her art desk? At the time, I couldn't have been sure. 
A yawning, time-altering moment stretched before me, but as I raised my fist for another knock, the light at my feet vanished. The lock clicked out of place, and I heard her leap to her bed. I flung to door open like a mother expecting to catch underage sex and flicked the light on. She didn't hiss; her eyes were covered with a night mask. The playful eye winking of the eye mask made it feel like it too was hiding an eerie secret. 
Blood stained and caked the floor as well as her blankets. The rusty brown of her previous exploits were highlighted in the fully lit room. I had been so upset earlier I hadn't even thought to check, and decided to clean it up in the morning. The most important thing was for me to make sure she hadn't picked at her stitches or something. I stormed over, feeling like she was my child. ""Let me see your hands."" 
She slid them up from under the blankets and flopped them over the comforter. I looked them over, grabbing them, flipping them to inspect both sides. Some blood had leaked through the backs of her hands and more at the tips of some fingers – just from normal usage, I figured. But they were still expertly wrapped, a skill I didn't expect she had – I was clearly wrong. ""Everything okay?""
The bandages hadn't even been picked, nor had the sores around her mouth. ""I just thought…"" Then fear stunned my heart as the horrible wicking eye stared at me. My hand snatched it off without thought. She hissed and squirmed. I nabbed her wrist as she tried to hide from the light and pulled them away from her face. 
""Thanks for blinding me! Now it's going to take me forever to get back to sleep."" Her judgmental eyes stared daggers at me. They were prefect, untouched. 
I let out a breath. ""I'm sorry. I'm just so caught up and…""
""You're worried about me. I get it. I appreciate everything you've been doing for me. Really. I'm sorry."" We hugged. ""You know what would really help? Another one of those pain meds. To help me get back to sleep?"" 
I waved a finger and felt guilty I had. ""You get another no sooner than four more hours."" 
""Fair. Fair."" She waved her gauze mittens in surrender.
""Now get some more sleep. I'm going to call Garrem and apologize for how I acted in front of his friends. We should've just come here anyway."" She just nodded with a smile and held her head up for me to replace the eye mask. I did so and kissed her sweaty forehead. ""You warm? Want me to pull some covers off?"" 
""No. Nah. I'm good.""
""Alright. See you in a few hours.""
                I shouldn't have left her side. 
I set an alarm. Called Garrem. And within minutes of his reassuring voice. I promptly passed out. 
I woke to the sounds of dripping coming from the kitchen. I slapped my hand over my phone; it was well past time to give Jess her pill. Somehow, the alarm never went off – I always woke to my alarm, no matter how quiet the volume. The continued dripping pulled my mind from the puzzlement. The TV has been switched off too, which could have been me, but it still raised my alertness. I called out for Jess, but no one answered back. Of course, I convinced myself, she was asleep in her room. Probably in pain because of me. Little had I known that she had been the one to sabotage me. 
Lifting myself off the couch, I flicked the TV back on for extra light and stood, stretching out the aches of a middle-aged person sleeping on a couch much too small for them. I'm joints wanted to be loosed from the entanglement I had put them in. I'm not sure if that was the moment I saw it or if it was when I turned on the overhead; all I know is that light illuminated the bloody foot tracks in the carpet leading to the kitchen. I still hear my own wavering voice calling out to her. ""Jess?"" I turned to the kitchen and called once more. My eyes, unable to pull from the uneven red stride leading to the linoleum and the dark.
The dripping continued, but was blotted out by the wet slaps of footsteps moving towards me in the dark. ""I'm coming."" Her voice was wrong. It was lacking, not in tone – it was still Jess talking as normal, more in pronunciation or enunciation. ""Just another moment. I'll be free and then I'll teach you how."" A crimson-drenched foot slatted into the light flowing around the corner from the living room. But it wasn't just blood, it was a horrifying red – the bright red of trauma. The type you only pretend to see in movies. 
Her skin had been peeled off up to the bottom of her ankle. The bare muscles of her foot leaked out its tenuous attempts at clots as she shifted her weight to drag the rest of her into the light. Her other foot was worse; blood flowed over from the shin, fleshly skinned up to the knee, over the exposed tendons. The pale pink of the bare bone creaked with another step. As the fear soaked in every detail, I saw that she had not purposely kept the muscles around her ankle, for it strained to hold her full weight as it was. Black fibers clung around the horror as if she had worn socks over the destruction. I still wonder, had I pulled her covers back when checking her over, could I have prevented all this? 
Unblinking, terror-controlled eyes drift up her untouched thighs, following the blood-soaked cloth of her shorts and shirt up to her face. I couldn't handle any more – I tried to focus on her eyes, but the revealed cheek and jawbone on only one side of her face made me loss it. 
I dropped to my knees and heaved my stomach contents on the floor. My vision tunneled as I hadn't breathed in what felt like minutes and now couldn't has I continued to retch. 
A lifetime stretched by, and finally, I gasped for breath and folded into a soul-aching sob. A weight crouched down beside me. “Isth_ohaa.” I felt the air expelling the words from her missing cheek against my hair. Every function of my body seized up. Each word was too airy or ended with a, normally muffled, clack of teeth. ""Don't worry. I'm fine. And it's so much easier now that I have no pain. Look."" My body still refusing to respond to action, I was forced to watch as her arm drifted into my view. A knife protruded out of both sides of her forearm, deeply buried under the flesh. I began uncontrollably shaking as a hand, bare of all but bone and tendons, gently gripped the handle. My eyes widen as if they weren't taking in enough detail – my brain still failing to send commands to my body. 
Then the skeletal hand moved. 
Sliding the blade back towards the elbow, a fountain of blood waterfalled out as I heard the metal strap along the bone like a guide line. A grunt and breath expelled bloody flecks onto my face. A switch flipped, and everything regained functioning. I shoulder towards what used to be my friend and heard the miserable sound of unprotected bones sliding against each other. Jess slumped to the ground in a mix of groans, gasps, and chuckles. 
In some miracle, I snag my phone and booked it to the door. Jess's distorted voice called out, ""Come back! We can be free together!"" 
I didn't stop running till I was two blocks from her place. Thinking back on it, I probably would've been safe just outside the building – she wasn't going anywhere on that destroyed ankle. Well. I guess that assumption was wrong, too. For when the cops finally got there and went to search her place, they found no trace of her. No trace of her being there, at least. ""Excessive amounts of blood and flesh."" I think is what was in the report. Impossibly, a day or two later, I received a report that some organs had been found in a trash can nearby, and a DNA test confirmed they were Jess's. The case was closed then, and the death certificate was issued. 
I am not convinced. They didn't see the contradicting horror of her condition, and she continued on despite it. They can't fathom my descriptions of her dexterous movements along with her mauled appearance. 
They have so many reasons for why it can't happen; 'death by blood loss', 'would go into shock', 'all use and functions would cease without' this or that.
They are all too constrained and trapped within themselves to even think it possible.
It's been days since that last update, and I can't seem to get it out of my mind. There's something telling me that it just doesn't make sense. And it aches at me that no one believes me. 
Even Garrem left to spend the night at a friend's house for a while because I ""was scaring"" him.

It is probably one of the most expensive places we have visited so with the benefit of hindsight these are my cost saving tips:
1) hiring a small car is quite a bit cheaper than an ATV.
2) avoid the supermarkets and go to Lidl in Fira. Much cheaper for pretty much everything.
3) boat trips are expensive, you can catch a public bus to Akrotiri and get an Akrotiri ferry that run every half hour to the red beach, white beach and black beach for 15 euros each. You can stay on and observe from the water or get off and included in the price catch another boat back. 
4) avoid anywhere that doesn’t have the price on the menu. We stopped for a coffee and two small beers and it came to 32 euros. So annoying as so many places are not that expensive. 
5) you don’t have to go to dinner to get a good sunset view. Lots of places near skaros rock in imerovigli to watch the sun down without paying inflated prices for average food. 
6) rent accommodation with cooking facilities so you don’t have to eat out every night. 

Just a few cost saving tips! We didn’t find it too busy and absolutely loved staying in Imerovigli. The people are wonderful and the whole week has been a dream. ",7,1754854054.0,Santorini,0,1.0,False

1mmriwx,https://www.reddit.com/r/NovelNexus/comments/1mmriwx/the_divorce_he_never_saw_coming_novel_read_free/,"The Divorce He Never Saw Coming Novel: Read Free online   I was Sophia Moretti, the invisible wife of James Moretti, heir to the city’s most powerful mafia family. But when his childhood sweetheart, the dazzling and privileged Vicky, returned, I finally understood: I had always been temporary.......","# Chapter 1

# I walked into the law office with my divorce papers clutched in my hand. Four years. Four years as Sophia Moretti, wife of James Moretti, heir to the most powerful mafia family in the city.

# Today, it ended.

# The lawyer didn’t even look up when I walked in.

# ""I’d like to file for divorce,"" I said, placing the papers on his desk.

# He finally glanced at me—messy ponytail, faded jeans, my backpack still slung over one shoulder. His expression turned stern. ""Young lady, divorce isn’t something you file on a whim.""

# I understood why he didn’t take me seriously. I looked like a college student who had wandered into the wrong office, not someone who had been married for four years.

# But I was prepared.

# ""Just stamp the papers,"" I said calmly. ""I’ll get my husband’s signature.""

# The Moretti estate was too quiet when I returned. The guards at the gate didn't even blink as I passed—just another invisible fixture in James' world.

# I headed straight for James' study. The door was slightly open, and I could hear laughter inside.

# Then I smelled it.

# Truffles.

# James always said he hated strong smells in the house. No garlic, no fish, nothing that lingered. But now, the air was thick with the scent of expensive white truffles, the kind you only get if you are the right person.

# I pushed the door open.

# There he was. James Moretti, my husband, sitting at his desk, relaxed in a way I'd never seen with me. And beside him was Vicky Rossi, his childhood best friend, back in the city this year after her divorce.

# She was feeding him a piece of bread covered in truffles, her fingers lingering just a second too long.

# Then James saw me. His smile disappeared.

# ""Sophia,"" he said, voice cool. ""I didn't expect you back so soon.""

# Vicky turned, her perfect red lips curling into a smile. ""Oh, Sophia! We were just having a snack. There's only enough for two, but I'm sure we can—”

# ""I'm fine."" I cut her off, stepping forward.

# I slid the document across the polished mahogany desk, the rustle of paper unnaturally loud in the silent study. James barely glanced up from his whiskey with his glass froze midway to his lips. James' eyes narrowed slightly. ""What's this?""

# ""The university needs a signed safety liability form,"" I flipped it open to the signature page.

# ""For my research project,"" I swallowed. ""Since you're my only family now.""

# The truth sat heavy between us. My parents had been gone for years, killed in a suspicious car accident that first pushed me into James' world. He knew better than anyone how alone I was.

# James frowned, ""Let me see that—"" My nerves suddenly tightened like piano wires. He never asked to read anything. Normally he'd just sign whatever university paperwork I put in front of him without a second glance.

# Why today? Why now?

# ""Oh James,"" Vicky laughed, placing a hand on his arm. ""You're too serious! It's just a form. You remember how many forms we had to sign for the charity gala last month?""

# As the heiress to Rossi Enterprises, one of the Moretti family's most important business partners, Vicky had moved effortlessly in James' world since her return. They were always together now, at galas, auctions, and those smoky backroom poker games where deals got made. Everywhere James went these days, Vicky seemed to appear at his elbow, her designer dresses complementing his tailored suits like they were a matched set.

# He hesitated, then grabbed his fountain pen and signed with a quick flourish, the same way he signed death warrants and business deals.

# I took the papers back before he could see the bold ""DIVORCE PETITION"" header on the first page.

# Vicky smirked, ""Honestly, James, you treat her more like a kid sister than a wife.""

# James didn't deny it. Just took a sip of whiskey.

# I turned and walked out before they could see my hands shake.

# The door closed behind me.

# I was free.

# Walking through the marble halls of the Moretti mansion, I clutched the signed divorce papers in my hand. The ink was barely dry, but the marriage had been over long before today.

# I remembered how different James used to be. The way his warm hands would trace my spine when he thought I was asleep. The possessive way he'd pull me into shadowed corners at family gatherings, his mouth hot against mine.

# Now he barely looked at me.

# My parents died when I was sixteen. Don Moretti, the reigning head of the Moretti mafia family at the time, took me in as a favor to my father—his former driver who'd taken a bullet for him. That's how I ended up living under the same roof as James Moretti.

# James was everything I shouldn't want. Cold. Dangerous. Ruthless. By twenty-five, he'd already taken over half his father's operations. The newspapers called him a ""young entrepreneur."" The streets knew better.

# I kept my distance at first. Made myself invisible. Until that night four years ago, when James came home covered in someone else's blood.

# He found me in the kitchen patching up my own knife wound, a gift from one of his father's men who thought the boss's charity case made easy prey.

# James didn't speak. Just took the bandages from my shaking hands and cleaned the cut himself. When his thumb brushed my inner thigh, I should have pushed him away.

# Instead, I pulled him closer.

# We married three weeks later. A business arrangement, James called it. Protection for me, legitimacy for him. I almost believed him—until Vicky Rossi came back to town and suddenly his late meetings doubled.

# Vicky. The Rossi heiress. Their construction empire worked closely with the Moretti family. Since returning after her divorce, And now that her French husband had filed for divorce, she'd become a constant presence——slipping into James' meetings, his cars, his life.

# Last month proved it.

# I'd waited six hours at Dante's—the restaurant James owned through a shell company—for our anniversary dinner. His right-hand man Michael finally showed up at midnight with a diamond bracelet and an excuse about ""business troubles.""

# The next morning, I saw the photos in the gossip column: James and Vicky at the opera, her fingers tucked in his tuxedo pocket where he usually kept his gun.

# That's when I started planning my exit.

# The divorce papers were my final exam. James signed them without reading—too distracted by Vicky feeding him stolen glances and stolen kisses.

# Now, standing in the mansion's gilded foyer, I traced the notary's embossed seal with my thumb. In a month, this paper would be my ticket to freedom.

# No more gilded cages. No more pretending.

# James could keep his empire. His violence. His Vicky.

# I wanted my life back.

# Chapter 2

# Vicky claimed her penthouse needed renovations after her return. That’s how she ended up in our guest suite—temporarily, of course.

# James approved it before I could object. ""The Rossis have been business partners for for decades,"" he said, as if that explained everything.

# Now she floated through our home like she owned it—lounging by the pool in designer bikinis, hosting her parties in our wine cellar, always finding reasons to interrupt when James and I were alone.

# Tonight, I caught them in the study, heads bent over some legal documents. Vicky’s long finger traced a line on the paper, lingering too close to James’ hand.

# ""Sophia!"" She smiled when she noticed me. ""We're planning my new home theater. You should join us.""

# ""I have lab reports to grade,"" I said, clutching my nightgown. We're divorced now. Whatever James does. Whoever he's with. It's none of my business.

# Vicky's laugh tinkled like broken glass. ""Always buried in your books! James used to do my math homework when we were kids - you tutored me yourself, didn't you James? My math skills are all thanks to you.""

# James chuckled lightly. ""Math was simpler than laundering casino profits."" His eyes flicked briefly to me, a silent check for reaction.

# I kept my face carefully blank, staring at my feet. How touching, their childhood bond still going strong after all these years. I'd just be here, counting the days until I could escape this charming reunion.

# By midnight, I was reviewing lab data when James entered our bedroom. The scent of whiskey and Vicky’s cloying perfume clung to his shirt as he sat beside me on the bed.

# ""Still working?"" His fingers brushed my shoulder.

# I stiffened instinctively. Yet when his hand slid down my spine, I arched into his touch like a starving woman offered crumbs.

# Pathetic, some rational part of my brain whispered. But four years of loneliness had carved a hollow space inside me that only James could temporarily fill, even if he'd never stay.

# His lips found my neck as he unbuttoned the front of my nightgown. I closed my eyes and let myself forget—

# —until my stomach turned violently.

# ""Sophia?"" James froze as I clapped a hand over my mouth.

# The queasy feeling disappeared as fast as it hit me. ""Just...ate something odd at the lab today,"" I offered weakly. The birth control pills I took religiously made pregnancy impossible, but my stomach seemed to rebel at the thought of Vicky sleeping right beneath us while James touched me.

# Just then, a crash came from downstairs.

# ""James?"" Vicky’s voice floated up the staircase, trembling. ""I heard glass breaking... I think someone’s in the house.""

# I felt James’ body tense. Duty called.

# He was out of bed before I could speak, grabbing the pistol from his nightstand. ""Stay here,"" he ordered, already halfway to the door.

# Turned out to be nothing—just the housekeeper dropping a plate. But when James returned hours later, he went straight to the shower without a word. I pretended to be asleep.

# The next morning, I nearly choked on my coffee when I saw James flipping through my research institute application forms—the ones I’d stupidly left on the kitchen counter. My stomach tightened.

# ""Biomedical engineering?"" He held up the application to the Swiss institute's application, his brow arched. "" When did you arrange this overseas project?""

# I forced a shrug. ""My classmate asked me to grab the forms for her."" My fingers curled into my palms—out of sight, out of mind—but not before I caught the faint tremor in my pinky finger. Damn it.

# James turned a page, scanning the details. ""Zurich. You’d hate the snow.""

# Of course he didn’t remember. Two winters ago, I’d dragged him to a cabin in Vermont just to watch the flakes fall. He’d spent the whole time on the phone with his lawyers.

# I didn't respond. Just look at him coldly.

# He set down his coffee, his dark eyes locking onto mine with unsettling intensity. ""You don’t need another degree. I could appoint you lead researcher at Moretti Medical tomorrow.""

# That’s the problem. Every achievement I had, every paper, every grant, was shadowed by the Moretti name. I opened my mouth to retort when Vicky’s laughter cut through the tension.

# ""Morning, darlings!"" She breezed in, her silk robe fluttering as she perched on the arm of James’ chair. ""James, the lawyers need us to review the new casino contracts before noon."" Her slender fingers brushed against James' shoulder in a familiar gesture.

# James stood up without another glance at my applications. ""We’ll take it in the study.""

# As they disappeared down the hall, I yanked the forms back. My hand steadied as I reached the Marital Status.

# Single.

# Chapter 3

# The research fellowship in Switzerland would last for four years. The director had emailed twice already, eager for me to start by fall. Four years abroad. Far from James. Far from Vicky. I sent ""Accept"" before I could overthink it.

# Last night played on repeat in my mind. I'd actually considered—just one last time—initiating something with James. A final memory to take with me. But he'd spent the evening with Vicky, probably whispering sweet nothings under the moon.

# That's the difference between love and...whatever this is.

# What I couldn't understand was how a man could feign desire so convincingly for someone he didn't love. To prevent a repeat of last night's humiliation, I decided to clear out my things today. Three weeks until the divorce was finalized. Three weeks of avoiding this house.

# Most of my life was already at campus housing—just one suitcase of clothes here. The only personal item was the photo album in the nightstand.

# I flipped through the thick leather cover. Every month like clockwork, I'd dragged James to a photo studio. Me smiling like an idiot. Him stiff as a statue, looking anywhere but at the camera.

# The album landed in the trash bin with a thud. Even the recycling truck wouldn't want this tainted love story.

# For years, I'd been an audience member in James Moretti's life. Now the curtain had fallen. Time to make my exit.

# The next two weeks blurred with thesis revisions and lab work. I barely thought of James—until his call interrupted my Friday research meeting.

# ""I'm outside your lab,"" his voice crackled through the phone.

# Since when does James Moretti play chauffeur?

# His black sedan idled at the curb. I slid into the leather seat, inhaling the familiar scent of his cologne and gun oil.

# ""You haven't been home."" His eyes stayed on the road.

# ""Lab's busy.""

# ""Good."" His fingers tapped the steering wheel. ""Vicky thought you were avoiding her. She's moving out next month—says it's 'inappropriate' now.""

# I yawned. ""Tell her not to bother. I don't care.""

# James' grip tightened on the steering wheel, his knuckles paling to bone-white. A flicker of surprise crossed his face. He opened his mouth—probably to praise my ""maturity""—but stopped when he noticed my closed eyes.

# I feigned sleep to avoid conversation, but the exhaustion was real. For the first time in years, my dreams weren't about him.

# Ten days until Switzerland.

# I stood in the supermarket aisle, staring at the dried hawthorn slices in my hand. I hadn't eaten these since childhood, but lately my stomach churned at everything else. My recent period had also been delayed.

# The pregnancy test confirmed my fears.

# ""twelve weeks along,"" the doctor said cheerfully. ""Congratulations!""

# I nearly laughed. Twelve weeks. That meant it happened during James' and my last time together—right before Vicky returned.

# My hands shook as I dialed James' number. At twenty-four, facing this alone terrified me—

# A familiar ringtone echoed down the hallway.

# James stood twenty feet away, his black coat draped over Vicky's shoulders as she whispered something that made him smile. I hung up and ducked into the stairwell.

# ""—avoid strenuous activity,"" the doctor's voice carried through the cracked door. ""And no intercourse for two months.""

# Vicky was pregnant too.

# ""I'll make sure she rests,"" James said, that tender tone I rarely heard.

# I shot out of the stairwell like a bullet, desperate to escape, only to crash straight into a nurse carrying medical charts. The papers went flying as we collided, creating just enough noise to draw attention from down the hall.

# James emerged from the examination room just in time to see me scrambling to help pick up the scattered documents, my face burning with the effort to appear composed.

# ""Sophia?"" He frowned, stepping forward. ""Why are you here?""

# ""Stomachache."" I crumpled the ultrasound slip in my pocket.

# Vicky materialized beside him, clutching her own scan. ""James told me you skip meals."" She patted his arm. ""We should get her some ginger tea.""

# I couldn't tear my eyes away from the ultrasound photo in Vicky's hand. The grainy black-and-white image seemed to pulse under the harsh hospital lights.

# James' face went pale. ""Sophia, let me expl—""

# ""James!"" Vicky's fingers dug into his sleeve like claws, her voice dripping with false sweetness. ""We talked about this.""

# I saw the conflict play out across his face, the way his muscles tensed, how his hand twitched before curling into a fist.

# Then Vicky pressed her cheek against his shoulder, whispering something that made him freeze. His arm dropped to his side like a dead weight.

# I turned away before they could see my face crumple. Behind me, I heard James take a half-step forward—

# ""James!"" Vicky's voice turned sharp. ""You promised.""

# The elevator doors closed on the image of my husband standing frozen between two women, his eyes locked on me with something that almost looked like regret.

# Outside, winter air slapped my face. The research acceptance letter lay buried at the bottom of my backpack. Four years. A groundbreaking study. A life far from this mess.

# And now—a baby.

# My hand rested on my stomach—still flat, but everything had changed. The sidewalk stretched endlessly in both directions.

# For the first time in my life, I had nowhere to go.

# Chapter 4

# For forty-eight hours, I'd been drafting and deleting emails to the research institute. How do I tell the director I accidentally pregnant by my soon-to-be-ex husband? My fingers hovered over the keyboard when my phone buzzed.

# Michael: Boss wants to see you at the gates.

# Since when did James send his right-man as a messenger boy?

# I spotted James leaning casually against his Mercedes, the morning sunlight softening his sharp features in a way that made my breath catch for a moment. The way the light traced his jawline, the slight crinkle at the corners of his eyes as he noticed my approach - it was unfair how my pulse still quickened at the sight of him after everything.

# I quickly looked away, fingers fumbling with my backpack strap as if it demanded all my attention. Four years of marriage, and my traitorous body still reacted to him like we were newlyweds. The heat that rose to my cheeks, the way my skin remembered his touch - biological betrayals I refused to acknowledge. Old habits, I told myself firmly. Just muscle memory, nothing more.

# ""Sophia."" He removed his glasses, revealing those dark eyes that used to make my knees weak. ""Dinner tomorrow. Dante's. Eight o'clock.""

# Dante's. The name alone sent acid creeping up my throat. That was where I'd sat for six hours on our anniversary, staring at cold osso buco while James ""handled business"" with Vicky.

# ""I'll be there,"" I heard myself say, the words leaping from my lips before I could temper them. The automatic response surprised even me—why so eager to sit across from the man who'd chosen Vicky over me at every turn?

# But hesitation would raise suspicions. James could smell weakness like blood in the water. If I was going to keep this baby—and I had every intention to—I needed to do things right. Hiding the pregnancy meant nothing if I didn't first sever all legal ties between us. James Moretti wasn't the type to let anything slip through his fingers, least of all a child. And if he ever found out I'd kept his heir from him...

# No. The divorce had to come first. Clean. Official. Irreversible.

# This dinner would serve two purposes: First, the divorce. Then, when oceans separated us, I'd decide how to tell him about the baby. If ever.

# The restaurant's chandeliers cast knife-sharp shadows across the white tablecloths. Tonight, he'd chosen the private wine cellar where we'd had our first date.

# His fingers wrapped around mine as he set down the Barolo bottle—not just brushing past, but actually holding my hand for the first time in four years.

# ""There's something I need to explain about what happened—""

# The cellar door crashed open. Michael rushed to his side, whispering urgently against his ear. But in the tomb-like quiet of the stone-walled cellar, the words ""Vicky"", ""cut her wrist"" and ""emergency"" slithered to my ears regardless.

# My stomach dropped. Of course. Even our last dinner couldn't be just ours.

# James' grip on my hand released as he shot to his feet, his chair screeching backward before toppling with a crash. ""What?!""

# The room spun. My vision tunneled until all I could see was James' retreating back, his coat flaring like a cape.

# He paused at the doorway just long enough to glance between Michael and me—a fraction of a second's calculation. ""Take her to the hospital,"" he ordered before disappearing up the stairs.

# Then—nothing.

# Fragments of conversation drifted through the haze:

# ""...just low blood sugar...""

# ""...get her some orange juice...""

# My eyelids fluttered open to blurred shapes - the doctor speaking with Michael by the doorway. A jolt of panic shot through me as consciousness returned. If they discover the pregnancy...

# The doctor leaned closer to Michael, her voice dropping to a murmur. ""And considering the patient's condit—""

# My dry throat constricted. I had to stop her—

# BRRRRT!

# Michael's phone screamed like a fire alarm. He ripped it from his pocket, the caller ID making him snap to attention. ""Yes, boss?"" A beat. His jaw tightened. ""Understood. On my way now, sir.""

# He slapped a black credit card onto the doctor's clipboard. ""Keep her here till New Year's if you want."" The door rattled in its frame as he vanished, the doctor's lips still parted around the unspoken ""pregnant"".

# ""Ah, you're awake."" She turned to me, oblivious to my racing pulse. ""You're approximately thirteen weeks along. Baby's healthy, but given your collapse..."" Her pen scratched across a notepad. ""We'll keep you 48 hours for monitoring.""

# She hesitated, glancing at the door. ""I didn't mention this to your... companion earlier.""

# I exhaled in quiet relief. ""No. And please keep it that way.""

# As the doctor stepping out, the nurses' hushed voices slithered under the curtain:

# "" Mr. and Mrs. Moretti are like royalty—They've turned Suite 801 into a penthouse - rose petals, champagne, the works. Mr. Moretti hasn't left her side since admission.""

# ""Would you expect less? Did you see how he carried her through the lobby? Like some romantic film.""

# A sigh. ""Ten years together and he still treats her like a bride. Meanwhile my husband forgets our anniversary...""

# Their words cut deeper than any knife. There was no question – they could only be talking about James and Vicky.

# ""Of course he's devoted – Mrs. Moretti's finally giving him an heir. Mr. Moretti’d commanded an army of specialists at her slightest sigh.""

# James treated Vicky like a queen. I became acutely aware of my chipped nail polish against the starch hospital sheets - the lone Moretti wife no one remembered to pamper.

# After two nights of observation with no complications, I was discharged.

# Stepping out of the hospital's automatic doors, I spotted Emma waiting by the curb, the manila envelope clutched in her hands.

# Stepping through the hospital's sliding doors, my first stop was the courthouse to collect the divorce decree. As I arranged for James' copy to be mailed—with a deliberate three-day delay—a quiet satisfaction settled in my chest.

# By the time this reaches his desk, I thought, watching the clerk stamp the postmark, I'll be in Zurich. Let the mighty James Moretti turn over every stone in the world. But even his power has limits—and I just became one of them.

# The envelope disappeared into the mailbox with a soft thud—four years of love, lies and loneliness now condensed into a single document that would chase my shadow across the ocean.

# Chapter 5

# I stared at the sent email—the one confessing my pregnancy to the Swiss institute. Now, there was nothing to do but wait. I placed my hand on my stomach almost unconsciously, as if to reassure us both.

# The director replied within hours:

# ""Congratulations on this new chapter! We've prepared family housing just steps from the lab, and Dr. Laurent's wife, our chief obstetrician, has personally reserved all your prenatal appointments. Most importantly—we're dispatching a team member to escort you from the airport door to your new home. No luggage handling, no queues, no stress whatsoever!""

# I stared at the screen. No hesitation. No judgment. Just support. Something tightened in my chest—maybe the first real hope I'd felt since seeing those two pink lines.

# ""Thank you,"" I typed back, ""for valuing me beyond my current circumstances.""

# On the day of my departure, I stood nervously at the arrivals gate, scanning the crowd for my institute contact. A voice called out - ""Sophia?""

# I turned to see a lanky man with gentle eyes pushing through the crowd. Eric, according to his badge, greeted me with a warmth that immediately put me at ease. He took my single suitcase carefully, as if handling rare artifacts. ""Priority boarding is ready,"" he smiled. ""The director insisted on VIP treatment for our star researcher.""

# As Eric maneuvered toward me, his shoulder briefly blocked my view of a commotion near the VIP lounge—where James stood with Vicky clinging to his arm, their backs turned as they greeted a group of Middle Eastern businessmen.

# At that precise moment, James stiffened.

# ""Did someone just call Sophia?""

# Vicky's crystalline laugh bounced off. ""Don't be ridiculous, James. Sophia is probably buried in lab right now."" Vicky said as she pulled James toward a champagne reception.

# We disappeared into the shuffling queue before his gaze could sweep our direction.

# As we walked toward the gate, Eric animatedly described the lab's new two-photon microscope. ""Dr. Laurent had it installed specifically for your protein research,"" he said, eyes bright with the kind of academic passion I'd nearly forgotten existed.

# He adjusted his grip on my suitcase. ""Oh, and the team unanimously voted to adopt your preferred schedule—no morning meetings before nine, and absolutely no evening work.""

# I pressed a hand to my sternum. These people, who'd never met me, had tried hard to anticipate my needs better than James ever had in four years of marriage.

# At security, Eric handed me a stack of postcards—the Alps glittering under cheap gloss. ""For writing home,"" he said with an encouraging nod.

# The trash bin swallowed them whole.

# Eric blinked. ""No one to write to?""

# I glanced back at the terminal windows, where the city skyline stood sharp against the dawn. Somewhere out there, James was probably reviewing Vicky's latest ultrasound photos over breakfast, her diamond-crusted hand resting on his arm.

# ""Not anymore,"" I said, turning toward the gate.

# The plane rumbled to life beneath us. Eric prattled about Zurich's farmer's markets—""The peaches in August! You'll think you've tasted sunlight!""—while I pressed a hand to the window.

1mmrgnu,https://www.reddit.com/r/antidepressants/comments/1mmrgnu/mirtazapine/,mirtazapine,"hi peeps,

med history:
1. i've been on zoloft for 7 years - doses have fluctuated, evened out to 50 mg which has helped even out my baseline very well.
2. got diagnosed with ADHD and started taking wellbutrin. cannot recommend this drug enough, i love her with all my heart. could finally take care of myself and overcome the executive dysfunction and major self loathing.
3. wellbutrin stopped helping as much as it did at first for adhd, but it still helps for anxiety. started taking adderall (wasn't excited to take it but adhd was so bad i had to try something) and the stimulant helped with the ADHD, but my appetite disappeared. for those who don't know, wellbutrin is also an appetite suppressant ! so adderall and wellbutrin together eliminated my appetite entirely. my stress response is to not eat and increase caffeine so..... needless to say i went back to the doctor pretty quickly.
4. got prescribed mirtazapine to help with appetite and sleep. sleep has never been an issue for me but that's bc i've smoked cannabis every evening for 6 years to help with sleep. recently i've wanted to cut back on cannabis consumption because it's affected my short term memory too much and almost out weighs the benefits. the first night i took mirtazapine was on a saturday night based on the reviews i read about the hangover the next day. didn't smoke that night to see how i did with just the med. slept like baby jesus but the hangover is REALLLLLLL. i couldn't get out of bed until 1pm. i'm so exhausted and confused (currently the next day, sunday) coffee has helped only slightly.

questions for the group
1. how long do the side effects of mirtazapine last? i can't be taking this med before a work day or i fear i wont wake up or get out of the grogginess to function for the work day. i know it's gotta build in your system so ill continue to take it and just suffer through, but i dont know if its worth it if these side effects continue past 2 weeks.
2. has anyone else had this medication mix (zoloft, wellbutrin, stimulant, mirtazapine) and started taking mirtazapine and quit smoking cannabis? i fear this is super niche but worth a shot to ask.

Thanks in advance for the support and advice!

1mmrfu7,https://www.reddit.com/r/waterfilterreviews/comments/1mmrfu7/does_waterdrop_wdf13_water_filter_truly_deliver/,Does Waterdrop WD-F13 Water Filter Truly Deliver Clean Water? Detailed Review,"Testing the **Waterdrop WD-F13 Replacement for GE MWF** has been an interesting and satisfying experience. As someone who values clean and safe drinking water, I’ve tried several water filters in the past, but this one caught my attention due to its thoughtful combination of efficiency, affordability, and quality. However, as much as I appreciated certain aspects, there are a few things worth highlighting for potential buyers.

**Ease of Installation**  
Installing the Waterdrop WD-F13 was surprisingly simple and hassle-free. I’m not exactly the handiest person when it comes to home appliances, yet this filter barely required any effort to attach to my refrigerator. The installation guide was clear, detailed, and didn’t leave me scratching my head. It took me about five minutes, and I didn’t need any tools. The precision measurement technology ensures the filter fits snugly, leaving no room for leakage, which has been an issue with other generic filters I’ve tried in the past.  

[Check Waterdrop WD-F13 price on Amazon.](https://usedwater.com/price/b079sbmywc/)  

**Filtration Performance**  
I could immediately notice a difference in water quality after using the filter. Waterdrop’s advanced filtration process claims to remove harmful impurities while enhancing overall taste, and my experience aligns with this. Compared with unfiltered water, the texture and clarity are noticeably better, and even my coffee and tea taste fresher now. The activated coconut carbon block, sourced from Sri Lanka, effectively reduces chlorine and other unpleasant flavors, leaving behind clean, crisp water. It feels like I’ve upgraded my beverage game without spending a fortune.  

**Durability and Lifespan**  
Having tested it over several months, I can say this filter holds up well during its lifecycle. According to Waterdrop, each cartridge can handle 300 gallons or up to six months of usage, depending on water quality. Personally, I track usage using the provided complimentary month install stickers, making it effortless to remember when the filter needs replacement. These stickers are a thoughtful touch, considering how easy it is to lose track of service timelines.  

**Environmental Impact and Materials**  
The materials used in this filter give me peace of mind. The BPA-free and food-grade build means that I’m not only filtering unwanted impurities but also avoiding harmful chemicals. Waterdrop’s NSF 42 and NSF 372 certifications underscore its credibility in providing safe, lead-free materials. Plus, the filter’s coconut shell carbon is a clever step forward compared to older charcoal-based methods, offering a larger surface area for filtration efficiency.

**Merits**  
- Quick and tool-free installation  
- Noticeable improvement in water taste and clearness  
- Eco-friendly coconut carbon filter  
- Lead-free and certified food-safe materials  

**Areas for Improvement**  
- The plastic exterior material could feel a bit sturdier.  
- Some users might find the fit too specific, fitting only compatible refrigerators, which can limit its usability.  
- Price remains economical but could be slightly more competitive in multi-pack options.

**Product Competitors**  
Waterdrop WD-F13 competes directly with filters like EveryDrop by Whirlpool and Frigidaire’s PureSource filters. Each offers its strengths, yet Waterdrop stands out for its advanced coconut-based filter materials and NSF certifications. While EveryDrop has broader compatibility and a premium feel, it often comes at a higher cost. Frigidaire filters, meanwhile, focus on a narrower range of impurities but don’t feature the seamless installation that Waterdrop provides. However, if you’re explicitly looking for a budget-friendly filter with no compromise on certifications and water quality, Waterdrop holds strong among its peers.

**Bang for the Buck**  
Considering its features and performance, I believe this filter provides excellent value for money. It's competitively priced and delivers on what it promises—enhanced water filtration, safety, and an overall better drinking experience. If clean, fresh-tasting water is a priority but you don't want to break the bank, this is a solid contender for your dollars.

I'm usually getting coffee which is either too bitter or sour (though rarely both). Since I'm a beginner and using beginner techniques/materials, I'm not expecting perfection. But I haven't gotten any result which I found enjoyable.  
  
I'm using about 35 grams of coffee which I grind myself. I aim for a fine, sandy texture. I use a little under 0.5 liters of distilled water (this more or less fills both the chamber for the coffee and the water up to the safety valve).

Since I'm just getting started, I opted for a generic aluminum moka pot (9 cup) before advancing to a more quality brand or size. Curious what the impact of this might be!

The coffee I'm currently using is Counter Culture: Big Trouble (50% Puente, Honduras, 50% Aurora Nicaragua, roasted July 15 2025). I used a darker roast initially but found my skills aren't currently good enough for a drinkable result.

I've put the pot on a variety of heat settings, but keep it towards medium-low, and often hang half the pot off of the spiral electric burner. Within a few minutes, the coffee begins exiting the chimney, and I usually get at least 80% of the starting liquid into the basin.

I'm usually able to stop the brew before it sputters for more than several seconds. Though, maybe I should be stopping it earlier, like when the exiting liquid becomes more of a light-colored bubbly foam.

I've relied on a few James Hoffman videos ([here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BfDLoIvb0w4) and [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rpyBYuu-wJI)), a Morgan Ekroth [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kK9-R5-r4X8), and a Matteo D'Ottavio video (can't find the specific one!) for instruction.

Or somebody's pocket you know you know what I mean I hope Anyway GrubHub you suck if it's not a dollar a mile don't even bother sending it to anyone I can't see anyone doing that I mean it literally said $2 for 4.8 mi who in the right mind would say yes to that That's at least a 30 minute run if not more for $2 you're going to make are you kidding me maybe give that to the homeless guy who has no other way of making money and he's going to walk it on foot yes maybe him other than that you must just be hoping people are stupid and don't see the bullshit that you were throwing at them.",0,1754853119.0,grubhubdrivers,5,0.33,False

I asked if he'd want to meet for coffee and he replied with ""wow I really didn't expect to hear from you, I'd be open to it yeah"" and then he called me (I was asleep by this point as it was very late) and then he said he was free the next day before 1pm and to let him know if I wanted to meet before then.

I replied the next morning with other options to meet as I wasn't in the city and acknowledged the missed call, he ignored me.

One week later I tried one more time, made it clear this was not an attempt to rekindle, not at all, but just wanted to see if he wanted to meet in the end. Nada. He's not blocked me though which is his usual tactic.

We ended horribly and it was obviously all weird, toxic but with good memories too and I can't handle the idea of randomly bumping into him after everything. I kinda selfishly needed that meeting in a calm neutral space to control the first interaction and help my nervous system. We loved each other deeply and it's miraculous that I've come out the other side really. I was incredibly reactive to him and guess he's villainising me as we speak now. Which makes me feel fucking horrendous tbh.

I’ve been doing data recovery for a while now, including wallet/key recoveries, and I’m wondering if there’s a niche for someone who travels to people and helps them recover lost crypto in person.

I come to you, we meet somewhere safe and public (airport lounge, coffee shop, library, etc.), and I do the recovery right there with you watching the whole process. No mailing drives off to a stranger, no “trust me bro” remote access sessions you see exactly what’s happening start to finish.

Instead of charging a flat fee, I’d take a percentage of whatever’s actually recovered.

I’m fine working with anything from a small bag to a high-value cold wallet. The hard part isn’t the work it’s finding legit cases in a space where most people are trained to ignore anyone offering help because 99% of the time it’s a scam.

I’ve been in the technology field for years and have done plenty of data recoveries, forensic imaging, and sensitive data handling. If I do the job, your hardware never leaves your sight no custody, no funny business. Happy to explain the process step-by-step while we work

I (F23) was born an American-Arabic Muslim and met my partner (M24) an Indian Hindu three years ago at a coffee shop in Italy. We instantly hit it off and we are both convinced we are soulmates because the connection is so powerful between us. I truly love him and I believe he loves me too. 

Unfortunately, his father (M45) seems to hate me for being Muslim. It’s to the point that no matter what my boyfriend says (that I converted, that I pray, etc), his father does not care for me and refuses to let “a Muslim” marry into his family. I have never met his father for context, and his dad and him are currently in India.

He tried talking to his father a final time about marriage before his father told him that he “ruined [his] own reputation by his own hands, and that [he] gave his relatives a reason to laugh at [his] family.” My boyfriend said there is nothing more he can do, and that the only thing I can do is try and text his father and convince him to let us marry or to at least call me. 

I am terrified and don’t know what I can possibly say to convince his father, and I am scared there is nothing I can say that will encourage him to at least let me prove that I am good enough for their son. 

For context, his grandma thinks I am beautiful and his mother loves me to death. His father and mother also got a love marriage where my boyfriend’s mother’s family cut her off for marrying his dad because his dad was a gangster at the time and she was higher caste from a good family. His brother is also getting married soon in India, and I have been invited to the wedding to meet his family. 

I know most of you will tell me it’s not going to work, but I want to try my best before giving up because I am deeply in love with him and would be absolutely devastated to end this relationship. Please help me! I will do absolutely anything necessary to make this work between us. I understand this his hands are tied because his family’s respect means a lot to him, so please don’t put him down for this. 

Please help!!!!!

1mmr2dx,https://www.reddit.com/r/backpacking/comments/1mmr2dx/my_costs_of_salkantay_trek_solo/,My costs of Salkantay Trek Solo,"Hello! I wanted to share my experience and all the costs of the Salkantay trek and Machu Picchu having nothing booked beforehand and doing it completely solo.

Day 1

I read that you could take a collective taxi to  Mollepata and then to Soraypampa. I waited for 30mins for the car to fill up at 5am. This cost 20 soles. Then another taxi to Soraypampa, I got lucky and there were two others that were doing the trek so this one cost 33 soles. In hindsight, I would've gone with a tour just to get to Soraypampa because you only save 10 soles and the tour just to Soraypampa costs 75 soles. From Soraypampa I walked to Soraypampa Hotel and checked into a dorm that cost 50 soles with dinner. They told me to leave shortly after 11am as there are fewer groups during this time. They were right and there were far less people. I walked up to the lake and returned, ate, and went to bed for the big day tomorrow.

Cost overview:

taxi collectivo arriving: 20 Soles
bread (5): 5 Soles
taxi (split in 3): 33 Soles
entry cost: 20 Soles
hostel plus dinner: 50 Soles

Total of the day: 128 Soles or 36 USD 

Day 2

This was by far the hardest day, I had breakfast at 5:30 am with the hostel. I was out the door by 6 am. I hiked the whole day without eating lunch on the way. I saw at least two opportunities for lunch, but didn't take them as I thought there would be more, there wasn't. I walked all the way to Chaullay and made it there for 1:30pm so I asked if I could have lunch there. In the end I stayed in Samana Wasi, I was the only one there and paid 95 soles for stay, lunch, dinner, and breakfast. For this day, I recommend stopping more and packing things for the cold as you will go up to 4700m and the warm, as you descend into a warm jungle. Bug spray is a must.

Cost overview 
Water 2.5:l 10 Soles
Hostel breakfast, lunch, dinner: 95 Soles
Total of the day: 105 Soles or 29 USD

Day 3

I started at 6 am again and the hostel owner gave me a tip. He recommended to go on the left side of the river as the walk is much nicer, harder, but nicer. It was. I walked through the jungle and was able to cross some not so safe looking bridges, but it was fun. The hike wasn't too hard and on the way, there were tons of things to try. Fresh papaya, coffee, avocado and more. I stopped at Sahuayaco for a coffee where the owner had a pet monkey which was pretty funny. He also showed me around the garden and how he made the coffee. It costed me 15 Soles for a coffee and a Powerade with a free quick tour. It is located south of the town on the right side if coming from the south of the 109. Not on Google maps, sorry. I walked to Lucmabamba and checked into Refugio de Mary.

Cost overview 

passionfruit + freezy: 3 Soles
banana: 1 Soles
coffee + Powerade + tour: 15 Soles
Refugio de Mery (breakfast + dinner): 70 Soles
candy + beer: 20 Soles

Total of the day: 109 Soles or 30 USD

Day 4

I started late in the morning as I traveled with some friends I made, about 8am. We walked to the mirador, which is incredible and you have your first view of Machu Picchu. We walked all the way to hydroelectrica and had lunch there. Then another two hours or so to Aguas callientes. It was the first time I had booked something a day before as I heard that the prices get out of hand. I arrived there at about 4-5pm and stood in line for Machu Picchu tickets. I waited only about an hour, but it felt much longer as my legs were rubber by this point. I booked the next available tickets, which was in three days. This is the part that I definitely recommend that if you know you want to do it, buy tickets online well in advance.

Cost overview 

Supertramp hostel 2 nights with breakfast: 136 Soles
Menu del Dia + Coca Cola: 15 Soles
Entrance to Machu Picchu: 156 Soles
Burger and water in hostel: 30 Soles

Total of the day: 337 Soles or 95 USD

Day 5-7

I will group these together as they are not mandatory, but this is how much I spent for the days in Aguas callientes. Note that this is the most expensive city I've been to in Peru and there aren't a lot of cheap options. I ate a lot at the central market which was cheap and tasty. One day the hostel was fully booked and I had to change for my last day to hostel mandor which wasn't bad as it's on the way to hydroelectrica and is right in nature. On day 7 I hiked to Machu Picchu which took an hour. The earliest ticket I was able to get was one pm and I enjoyed the view for about an hour and walked down as fast as possible to hydroelectrica to try and get a collective taxi back. I arrived back in Cusco after taking a taxi at 5pm at 10:30 pm. Apparently the taxis are cheaper before 3pm.

Cost overview of days 5-7

coffee: 10 Soles
menu del dia: 12 Soles
dinner chifa + cerveza: 30 Soles
pisco sour one and a bit: 17.5 Soles

Day 6

menu del dia: 12 Soles
mango juice: 10 Soles
coffee + cheesecake: 26 Soles
hostel mandor + dinner: 65 Soles
water: 5 Soles

Day 7	

sandwich mango juice: 16 Soles
coffee with alfajor: 16 Soles
Lunch 15: Soles
return to Cusco 5pm: 70 Soles

Total of the day: 289 Soles or 81 USD


Total of the entire trip: 988 Soles or 278 USD

In no way is this supposed to be a guide. I just couldn't find much information about how much the entire Trek + Machu Picchu would cost and wanted to give people like me, people who are curious, an estimate. For a budget traveler, it was expensive, but it's completely worth it as the views from the trek are amazing. The only other piece of advice I can give is that I don't have hiking shoes and always found it a bit extra to have them, but I did the trek with rubbish shoes and yes my feet hurt. If you can afford it, buy hiking shoes for this trek.
Feel free to write to me with any questions and travel on!

  The origin post is open on my computer when I shuffle over to it in the morning. Overnight, another three hundred comments have cropped up. I don’t know what they say anymore—I haven’t checked in months. I know some are from fans. A lot are from trolls. I don’t look at the post for the comments. I look because it is my daily reminder that all of this—all of my life—is a real thing.  
  
  My beginning is time-stamped in history.  
  
  I smooth down my tangle of hair, yawn, and rub sleep from my eyes. When I blink, the post is still there, sitting happy near the top of the Masterminds subforum for webcomics. You’d think, after two years, it would have fallen. It hasn’t.  
  
  I close the browser before I betray my own rules. I do not read comments. Comments are explosives for mental walls, and right now I need those walls up. I open Photoshop to find the file I was working on last night, a half-finished page from Monstrous Sea. All the line work is done. I started on the colors but didn’t finish, and I still need to add the text. Still, I’m ahead of schedule. This will be a whole chapter kind of week. My minimum for each week is one page; usually I average three. I always have something to post.  
  
  I skim over the comic page, skipping from panel to panel, double-checking the characters and settings. I lay out the rest of the colors in my head, then the light sources and the shadows. The text. The flow of the action looks okay, but in the bottom panel I drew Amity’s nose too narrow again. It’s always noticeable in close-ups of her face, and it’s always her nose. I’ll have to fix it later. I don’t have time now.  
  
  Like it agrees with me, my alarm clock goes off, and I jump. Even when I know it’s coming, even when I’m staring right at the thing. I shuffle back to the other side of the room to hit the button before it wakes up Church and Sully in the next room. Stupid middle schoolers get to sleep in an extra half hour, and they think they’re kings.  
  
  Mom already has two hard-boiled eggs and a glass of fresh-squeezed orange juice ready for me when I get downstairs. I don’t know when she hard-boiled those eggs. She certainly didn’t do it last night, and it’s the crack of dawn now. She sits at the island counter in her running outfit with her bouncy ponytail, reading some health article on her tablet. A few strands of hair are out of place, and water splashes in the shower down the hall. She and Dad are already back from their early morning run. Heinous.  
  
  “Morning, hon!” I know in some universe she must be speaking at normal volume, but it is not this universe. “Made you breakfast. Are you feeling okay? You look a little gray.”  
  
  I grunt. Morning is the devil’s time. And Mom has told me I “look gray” at least once a week for the past year. I drop onto the island stool in front of the eggs and juice and begin eating. Maybe I should try coffee. Coffee might help. Coffee might also send me into spiraling bouts of depression.  
  
  Under Mom’s elbow is today’s issue of the Westcliff Star. I pull it over and turn it around. The front-page headline reads REMINDERS PLACED AT WELLHOUSE TURN. Below that is a picture of the sharp turn in the road past Wellhouse Bridge where wreaths of flowers, ribbons, and toys decorate the ground. That’s local Indiana news for you: they have nothing, so they fill their pages with the reminder that Wellhouse Turn kills more people every year than great white sharks. Also local Indiana news: comparing a turn in the road to a shark.  
  
  I finish the first egg. Dad comes out of the back hall smelling like a pack of spearmint gum and wearing slightly different running gear than what he wears when he goes out with Mom, which means these are his work clothes for the day.  
  
  “Morning, Eggs!” He stops behind me, puts his hands on my shoulders, and leans down to kiss the top of my head. I grunt at the nickname and stuff egg in my mouth. Hard-boiled heaven. “How’d you sle  
ep?”  
  
  I shrug. Is it too much to ask that no one speak to me in the morning? I have just enough energy in my mouth to eat delicious eggs; there’s none left to form words. Not to mention that in twenty minutes I have to get in my car to go to school for seven hours, where I’m sure plenty of talking will happen, whether I like it or not.  
  
  Mom distracts Dad with her health article, which is apparently about the benefits of cycling. I tune them out. Read about how the Westcliff High band bus driver fell asleep at the wheel and drove off Wellhouse Turn last summer on their way back from regionals. Chew. Before that it was a guy driving with his son in the winter. Drink juice. And before that, a woman taking her two kids to day care early in the morning. Chew more. A group of drunk teenagers. Finish off the egg. A lone girl who hit the wrong patch of black ice. Finish off the juice. They should put up a barrier to keep people from flying off the turn and down the hill to the river, but no. Without Wellhouse Turn, we have no news.  
  
  “Don’t forget, your brothers have their first soccer game this afternoon,” Mom says when I drop off my stool and take my plate and cup to the sink. “They’re really excited, and we all have to be there to support them. Okay?”  
  
  I hate it when she says “Okay?” like that. Like she expects me to get angry at her before the words are ever out of her mouth. Always prepared for a fight.  
  
  “Yeah,” I say. I can’t muster any more. I return upstairs to my room for my backpack, my sketchbook, and my shoes. I jump up and down a few times in an attempt to get more blood flowing to my brain. Eggs eaten. Energy up. Ready for battle.  
  
  I resist the urge to go back to my computer, open up the browser, and check the Monstrous Sea forums. I don’t read comments, and I don’t check the forums before I leave for school. That computer is my rabbit hole; the internet is my wonderland.  
  
  I am only allowed to fall into it when it doesn’t matter if I get lost.  
  
  Amity had two birth days. The first was the same as anyone’s, and she didn’t remember it. She didn’t spend much time dwelling on the fact that she didn’t remember it, because she had learned years ago that nothing good came of dwelling. The second birth—or the rebirth, depending on what mood she found herself in—she remembered with stunning clarity, and imagined she would for the rest of her life.  
  
  Her second birth was the day the Watcher took her as its host.  
  
  CHAPTER 2  
  
  Some people have called Monstrous Sea a phenomenon. Articles here and there. A few critics. The fans.  
  
  I can’t call it that, because I created it. It’s my story—it’s the one I care about more than anything else, and it’s one that a lot of other people happen to enjoy—but I can’t call it a phenomenon because that is pretentious, and narcissistic, and honestly it makes me queasy to think of it that way.  
  
  Is it strange to be nauseated by recognition?  
  
  Lots of things about Monstrous Sea nauseate me.  
  
  The story is at once very easy and very hard to explain. I’ve never tried to do it in person, but I imagine if I did, I would end up vomiting on someone’s shoes. Explaining something online is as simple as pasting a link and saying, “Here, read this.” They click. Read the intro page. If they like it, they keep reading. If not, oh well, at least I didn’t have to talk.  
  
  If I did have to explain the story without the very handy reference of the story itself, I imagine it would sound something like this:  
  
  “On distant planet Orcus, a girl and boy fight on opposite sides of a long war between the natives and colonists from Earth. The girl and boy are hosts to parasitic energy creatures whose only weakness is each other. There’s lots of ocean, and there are monsters in that ocean. Stuff happens. Colors are pretty.”  
  
  There’s a reason I’m an artist and not a writer.  
  
  I began posting Monstrous Sea online three years ago, but it blew up when the origin post appeared on the Masterminds site. People actually saw it. They started reading.  
  
  They cared.  
  
  That was the weirdest thing. People other than me cared about it. They cared about Amity and Damien and the fate of Orcus. They cared whether the species of sea monsters had names. They cared if I put the pages up on time, and how good they looked. They even cared about me, who I was, though they never got past my username. The fans didn’t, the trolls didn’t, the articles and critics didn’t. Maybe the creator’s anonymity made it more of a phenomenon. It certainly kept me from getting too nauseated to work. I get emails from agents and publishers about putting Monstrous Sea into print, but I delete them right away; traditional publishing is this huge, terrifying thing I have to fend off with a stick every once in a while so I don’t get overwhelmed by the thought of a corporate machine manhandling my baby.  
  
  I didn’t make Monstrous Sea to be a phenomenon—I made it because it was the story I wanted. I make it now because there’s something inside of me, crushed around my heart, that says I must do it. This is what I was put on Earth to create, for me and for my fans. This story. This is mine, and it is my duty to bring it into the world.  
  
  Does that make me sound pretentious?  
  
  I don’t care.  
  
  It’s the truth.

  When asked what the rebirth had felt like, Amity could only respond with “Painful.” A creature of pure energy had crawled inside her and rearranged her very genetic structure. How else could it feel? But the people of Nocturne Island were persistent, and deeply spiritual, and the Watcher was one of their great guardians, so eventually she changed her answer to “Enlightening.”  
  
  CHAPTER 3  
  
  School feels more like a punishment than ever.  
  
  I just don’t care. I stand at my locker this fine October morning and stare down the hallway. A homecoming banner decorates the mouth of the hallway, reminding students to buy tickets for the football game this Friday night. Someone put that banner up there. God, someone made that banner. Someone painted it and everything. Students pass me wearing outfits for this particular day of homecoming spirit week, which happens to be hippie day. Lots of peace signs and tie-dye floating around. So much school spirit.  
  
  I barely finish my homework every night; how does anyone else have the willpower to care like this? The people having the most fun, dressed in the most ridiculous costumes, are seniors like me. How? Why? These are legitimate questions: I feel like someone told a joke and I missed the punchline, and now everyone’s laughing without me.  
  
  I stand by my locker in stretched-out jeans and a baggy sweatshirt, counting the minutes until I have to give up and go to homeroom. A group of boys wearing tie-dye headbands and rose-colored glasses crowd up to the locker beside mine; one of them throws it open so hard it smacks me between the shoulder blades. The boy who did it starts to apologize, then sees that it’s me and loses his vo  
ice to a badly concealed snort. I turn away and ignore them until they leave again, when one of the others pulls his hood up and acts like a cave creature, his back hunched and his hands held out in gnarled claws. The other boys laugh, as if they aren’t still within my sight. I yank my own hood down.  
  
  I don’t understand this place, but I only have to survive it for seven more months—seven months until graduation, until college. And college, as I have heard it from several respectable sources in the Monstrous Sea fandom, is so much better than high school it’s laughable.  
  
  I want to be there. I want to be in the place where high school is the joke, and I don’t have to be near people if I don’t want to, and nobody cares what I wear or look like or do.  
  
  When the boys disappear around the corner and all attention fades away from me, I turn back to my locker. Freshman year, I festooned it in graphics and fanmade art for Children of Hypnos, my favorite book series. A few early Monstrous Sea sketches hid in the corners, but that was before Monstrous Sea was even a thing. Now my locker is empty aside from my school stuff. I stuff my stats and history books in my backpack. Wedge my sketchbook under my arm. The backpack gets slung over my shoulders, and my dignity tucked safely away.  
  
  On to homeroom.  
  
  “Eliza. I need to borrow you for a little while.” Mrs. Grier has a bad habit of grabbing the first student who walks through her door when she needs something, and today I’m the unlucky plebe she gets her happy teacher hands on. She beams at me, looking the picture of joy in an unseasonal yellow sundress and earrings shaped like bananas.  
  
  I ease my arm out of her hand so it doesn’t seem like I don’t want her to touch me. I don’t mind Mrs. Grier. Most days I like her. I wish I had her for an actual class instead of just homeroom, because she doesn’t make me talk if I don’t want to, and she counts showing up to class as your entire participation grade.  
We have a transfer student new to the school today,” she says, smiling, and steps sideways. Behind her is a boy a little taller than me, football-player big, wearing jeans and a Westcliff High T-shirt. He hasn’t even been here a day, and he’s already got the school spirit. He scrubs a hand through his short dark hair and glances at me, expression blank, like he doesn’t quite see me there. My stomach turns. He is exactly the kind of person I try to avoid—I like being invisible, not having someone look at me like I should be.  
  
  “This is Wallace,” Mrs. Grier says. “I thought you could give him a few tips about the school and help him with his schedule before we leave homeroom.”  
  
  I shrug. I’m not going to say no to her. “No” usually makes more problems than it solves. Mrs. Grier smiles.  
  
  “Great! Wallace, this is Eliza. You can go ahead and sit next to her.”  
  
  Wallace follows me to my seat in the back of the room. He moves slow, sits slow, and looks around like he’s still asleep. He glances at me again, and when I don’t say anything, he pulls his phone out of his pocket and starts going through texts.  
  
  I didn’t want to say anything to him, anyway. The school isn’t that confusing—I’m sure he’s smart enough to figure it out on his own.  
  
  I curl up my legs in the desk chair, set my sketchbook against them so no one can see the inside, and begin work on the next Monstrous Sea page. I forget Wallace. I forget Mrs. Grier. I forget this whole school.  
  
  I’m gone.  
  
  I get through the day the way I always do: by disappearing so well the teachers never see me, and by resisting the temptation to check the Monstrous Sea forums on my phone. I’ve heard it’s much easier to get through school when you have friends to talk to, but all my friends are online. I used to have offline friends. Or at least I thought I did. Growing up, I had friends in school and in my neighborhood, but never good friends. Never friends who invited me to sleepovers or movies. I got invited to a couple of birthday parties, but sometimes I think that was because my mom badgered other moms. I was a weird kid then, and I’m weird now. Except now neither I nor any of my classmates is under the delusion that we have to interact with each other on a more than superficial basis.  
  
  Dad likes to say thinking I’m weird is normal. “Well, Eggs, you’re just going to have to trust me when I say that’s a thing a lot of kids your age think.” Maybe he’s right. All I know is, last year Casey Miller saw me walking behind her in the hallway and actually squealed in fear before she skipped away. She halfheartedly apologized a second later, of course, but it was a packed hallway during passing period—who gets scared by another student behind them? I know a week before that, I walked into gym late because of particularly nasty period cramps and scored my entire class ten minutes of stair laps that to this day have earned me the sort of looks that should be reserved for murderers. I know a few months before that, Manny Rodriguez invited some of his swimmer friends to cut me in the lunch line, only to have them refuse because they were afraid I’d call down a demon on them.  
  
  Is that the kind of person I seem like? A cultist? A religious fanatic? Am I so weird I should be the bad guy of the week on a prime-time television crime show?  
  
  My parents wonder why I don’t have more friends, and this is why: because I don’t want to be friends with these people. Even the nice ones think I’m weird; I can see it in their faces when they get paired with me for projects. I’m the person you pray the teacher doesn’t call for your group. Not because I’m a terrible student, or because I make you do all the work, but because I dress like a homeless person and I never talk. When I was really little, it was endearing. Now it’s strange.  
  
  I should have grown out of it.  
  
  I should want to be social.  
  
  I should desire friends I can see with my eyes and touch with my hands.  
  
  But I don’t want to be friends with people who have already decided I’m too weird to live. Maybe if they knew who I am and what I’ve made, maybe then they wouldn’t think I was so weird. Maybe then the weird would just be eccentric. But the only person I can be in this school is Eliza Mirk, and Eliza Mirk is barely a footnote in anyone’s life. Including mine.  
  
  By the seventh-period bell, I have a whole new page of Monstrous Sea ready for inking, but my mind is on the page at home I still have to finish. New pages go up on Friday nights, always, like TV shows or sporting events. My readers like consistency. I like giving it to them.  
  
  I toss the books I don’t need back into my locker and make my way to the parking lot, sticking close to the walls and shrinking until I barely feel myself there. Most people are already in their cars, clogging the lot. I make my way out the school’s front doors, digging through my bag for my keys.  
  
  That kid Wallace sits on one of the benches on the front walk, phone in one hand and screen turned up like he’s waiting for a message, a pen in the other hand so he can write on the sheaf of papers on the binder in his lap. Still looks like he’s falling asleep. He might need a ride home. Or maybe he’s just smart and knows it’s better to wait until the parking lot clears out to try to leave. I stop outside the doors and watch him for a moment. I could offer him a ride, but that would be strange. Eliza Mirk does not offer rides, and no one asks her for them.  
  
  When he starts to look up, I turn away and hurry out to my car.  
  
  CHAPTER 4  
  
  Apocalypse\_Cow: are you working on the next page right now?  
  
  MirkerLurker: No—finished one earlier. Now sitting in the car going to my brothers’ soccer game. Only have my sketchbook.  
  
  emmersmacks: Bummer  
  
  emmersmacks: Hey did you get my care package  
  
  MirkerLurker: No! You sent another one? You didn’t have to do that, Em!  
  
  emmersmacks: :DDD I love sending stuff to you guys!! Besides this ones got good stuff in it  
  
  Apocalypse\_Cow: when do they not have good stuff in them?  
  
  Apocalypse\_Cow: also where’s MY care package???  
  
  emmersmacks: Oh calm down youre getting one too dummy  
  
  emmersmacks: E youre going to be around for the Dog Days livewatch right  
  
  MirkerLurker: Duh. The day I miss Dog Days is the day I eat my own foot.  
  
  Apocalypse\_Cow: \*takes screenshot\*  
  
  Apocalypse\_Cow: let it be known on this day that if eliza ever misses dog days, she will eat her own foot.  
  
  emmersmacks: Masterminds would love that one  
  
  emmersmacks: Creator of Monstrous Sea eats own foot over teen soap opera  
  
  Apocalypse\_Cow: tacky teen soap opera.  
  
  MirkerLurker: Tacky teen soap opera? Yes. Wildly entertaining? Also yes.  
  
  emmersmacks: Amen  
  
  “Are you texting your boyfriend again?” Sully nudges up against my side, putting his chin on my shoulder. At his words, Church pulls away from the car window on my other side and leans in too. I slam my phone facedown on the sketchbook in my lap.  
  
  “Stop reading over my shoulder,” I snap. “And it’s not my boyfriend. It’s just Max and Emmy.”  
  
  “Oh, just Max and Emmy,” Sully says, making air quotes. “Sure.” Church snickers and copies the air quotes a second later.  
  
  “Be nice back there,” Mom chirps from the passenger seat. Dad makes a sound of agreement.  
  
  We pull into the parking lot of the gym where Sully and Church play indoor soccer. The half-hour drive went fast thanks to Max and Emmy, but I don’t look at the phone again until the two nightmares climb out of the car. Then I follow Mom and Dad into the building, with my nose in the phone.  
  
  Apocalypse\_Cow: but seriously tho, dog days is the worst  
  
  emmersmacks: Not worse than the second season when Chris got with Ben  
  
  Apocalypse\_Cow: chris got with jason in the second season, not ben  
  
  emmersmacks: Says the guy who doesnt watch Dog Days  
  
  Apocalypse\_Cow: . . .  
  
  emmersmacks: Ah how the mighty have fallen  
  
  I snicker. Dad looks over his shoulder at me. “What’s so funny, Eggs?”  
  
  I turn off the phone and pres  
s it to my sketchbook again. Annoyance pings over my humor, little dark spots in the lightness. “Nothing.”  
  
  Until I’m sure neither Mom or Dad are looking back again, I keep the phone down and my eyes up. This gym is more like a warehouse than anything. A big empty room with movable walls as dividers between different courts. Volleyball, basketball, tennis. The place is huge. In the center is a walled-in soccer field with bleachers and everything. I take a picture and send it to the chat.  
  
  MirkerLurker: This place is actual hell.  
  
  emmersmacks: My sister hangs out at one of those gyms  
  
  emmersmacks: They make me want to shower  
  
  Apocalypse\_Cow: that is weirdly specific, ems. sorry for your luck, e.  
  
  MirkerLurker: When I die here, bury me with my art.  
  
  Apocalypse\_Cow: songs will be sung. potential mourned. someone will have to notify the fans, of course. as head security admin for the ms forums, i accept this responsibility.  
  
  emmersmacks: When did you start calling yourself Head Security Admin  
  
  emmersmacks: All you do is ban trolls  
  
  “Oh, Eliza, look.” Mom’s hand brushes my shoulder. I look up and find her examining a poster on a board by the gym entrance. Dad and the boys have already taken off toward the soccer field, where the teams warm up for their game. “They’re starting tennis lessons soon. I really think you’d love tennis—it’s a solitary game, and it’s great exercise.”  
  
  “No,” I say, and go back to my phone. She gives up immediately.  
  
  We’ve evolved this process steadily over the years. When I was little and didn’t have a say in the matter, my parents signed me up for every sport under the sun. Little League Baseball. Soccer. Basketball. Volleyball. I hated all of them because I didn’t—don’t—have any coordination and I didn’t—don’t—like to talk, so I didn’t play well, so my teammates wanted me gone. The first time I told my dad I wanted to quit softball, he flipped out and didn’t speak to me for a week. Mom tried to reason me back into it.  
  
  It would build character. It would help me make friends. It would be good exercise.  
  
  I refused. Then I quit all the other sports too. Casting them off was like casting off a set of old, heavy armor. Church and Sully loved sports, so some of the focus fell away from me, but Mom and Dad still tried. If I said no, they kept trying. I kept saying no.  
  
  Now we are at that place where they suggest something and I say no and that’s the end of it.  
  
  I follow Mom to the soccer field and perch beside her at the foot of the bleachers. Dad stands on the sidelines, coach’s clipboard in hand, talking to a group of gangly fourteen-and-under boys in sky-blue uniforms. I take my pencils and eraser out of my pocket and crack open my sketchbook.  
  
  “I wish you wouldn’t take that everywhere,” Mom says. “Why can’t you watch your brothers play?”  
  
  I look up at her, then at the field, then back down at my sketchbook. There’s no answer I can give her that she wants to hear, so I won’t give her one at all.  
  
  We get home in time for Dog Days. I scramble out of the car over a sweaty Church, grab a water bottle from the fridge in my rush to my room, turn on the small TV on the crook of the desk beside the computer, and flip the channels until I find the one I want. The opening credits are starting. I wake up the computer and hurry to the website.  
  
  [Monstroussea.com](http://Monstroussea.com) is not only the first place to find all the Monstrous Sea pages I’ve done up to this point, it’s also the link to the largest fan forums for the comic and a chat page where once a week I show up under my pen name to watch Dog Days with the fans. This is the only time LadyConstellation speaks live.  
  
  LadyConstellation: I’M HERE! Nobody worry, I’m here!  
  
  moby66: Yay!  
  
  GirlWho: yayayay  
  
  hustonsproblem: We thought you wouldn’t show up!  
  
  A flood of other comments follows those. Usually there are so many people in the chat I can’t actually reply to any of them. I blurt out things about the show and let them respond. They hold conversations with themselves. Mostly the point is that I’m there, and we’re watching the same thing, and for once no one is talking about Monstrous Sea.  
  
  I love Monstrous Sea as much—probably more—as them, but even I need something simple to talk about every once in a while.  
  
  A private chat comes up on my phone, where I’m still logged in to my MirkerLurker account.  
  
  Apocalypse\_Cow: looking forward to this one! will spencer find out jane’s a lesbian and is also dating his ex??  
  
  Max will never admit it to the public, but he loves watching Dog Days as much as the rest of us. Only Emmy and I know, but right now Emmy’s too busy frolicking with the other fans in the main chat.  
  
  I send some senseless emojis to Max and start commenting in main chat through the opening scenes of Dog Days, where Spencer does indeed discover Jane has come out as a lesbian and is now dating his ex-girlfriend Jennifer. I can’t tell if this is mindless plot twisting or if the show is actually trying to make some statement about gay rights. I send that to chat. They love it.  
  
  At the first commercial break, I scan into the computer the new Monstrous Sea page I sketched out in school today and bring it up in Photoshop to start the good line work. My pen display waits for me like a prized stallion ready to launch out of the gate, its screen duplicating the screen of my computer. I pull my smudge guard—an old glove with the thumb, index, and middle fingers cut off—over my right hand, to keep the pen display screen from getting gross, and to let my hand move smoothly across it. Nothing ruins a piece faster than poor hand movement.  
  
  Line work is my favorite part of any page. Colors are second, but line work has a subtlety matched by nothing else. Good lines will make or break a picture. Bonus, this page will have some really awesome lines: right now, Amity and Damien are in the middle of the Battle of Sands, where Orcians and Earthens clash for control of the capital city of the desert lands.  
  
  Monstrous Sea involves a lot of elemental-type powers, very anime, so most fights have great lines. Especially when Amity and Damien are there, because they fight with crystals and fog. Angles and curves. Delicious.  
  
  The commercial ends before I get a chance to really do anything. I set down my pen and turn back to the chat to find a few noticeable newcomers among the flock.  
  
  LadyConstellation: I hope no one caused any trouble during that commercial break.  
  
  rainmaker: Define “trouble.”  
  
  Fire\_Served\_Cold: Trouble: n. def: This guy.  
  
  rainmaker: Smooth.  
  
  Fire\_Served\_Cold: I try.  
  
  Below that quick exchange come a flurry of excited “rainmaker!!”s and a few “The Angels are here!”  
  
  The Angels they refer to are the group of five fans who took names based on the Angels in Monstrous Sea, the guardians of the planet Orcus. I’ve never really interacted with rainmaker and the other Angels of the fandom, but I’ve seen them around the boards. It’s kind of impossible not to see them around the boards. They’re almost as popular as I am.  
  
  The music on the TV hits a crescendo. I turn in time to see Jane find out she’s pregnant with Spencer’s baby before it cuts to another commercial. They really are going for an issues episode here. Back to main chat.  
  
  LadyConstellation: Another pregnancy?! This show already kept a baby, gave a baby up for adoption, and had an abortion! How will they tackle this problem and still stay relevant to REAL TEEN LIFE?  
  
  rainmaker: Hahahahaha  
  
  The reply pops up immediately, and a strange warm feeling flutters in my chest. Other people laugh, but rainmaker’s response is the one that does it. He’s the most-read fanfic writer for Monstrous Sea. I’ve seen some of his stuff. He’s really funny. Like, really fucking funny. Like, I couldn’t make Monstrous Sea that funny if I tried.  
  
  So him laughing at something I said feels like winning a lottery.  
  
  Then he replies with this:  
  
  rainmaker: PLOT TWIST it was actually Jennifer’s baby. Jane was cheating on Spencer long before this. When the baby is born, they name it J  
anifer and live a happy lesbian life in the suburbs and never think about Spencer again.  
  
  I nearly spit water all over my computer screen at “Janifer.” The rest of the threads going on in the chat, all the other voices, fade into the background and my eye only catches rainmaker’s when it appears.  
  
  Fire\_Served\_Cold: Wait, how did two lesbians have a biological child together?  
  
  rainmaker: Um excuse you no one said it was biologically Jennifer’s. Blood=/=family. Amirite? Anyone?  
  
  LadyConstellation: Sorry, I’m still trying to process “Janifer.”  
  
  rainmaker: Liked that one, did you? ;)  
  
  Oh god, a winky face. The most provocative of all emoticons. A blush creeps over my face and I rub my cheeks to hide it, even though there’s no one here to see. What a confident, cocky bastard. Boys at school never do this to me—I don’t know if it’s because I can see their faces or because they can see mine or what. I only have feelings like this for people I meet online, and honestly, rainmaker’s the first one to drudge them up in a good long while. It’s like in this whole chat, he’s only talking to me. Like two people sitting next to each other on a couch in a crowded party.  
  
  Now, here’s the new issue:  
  
  Do I say anything back?  
  
  My fingers hover over the keyboard. A commercial for acne medication flashes on the TV, then a commercial for the show coming on after Dog Days. I type:  
  
  LadyConstellation: Oh, you know it. ;)  
  
  What a cop-out. At least I got the winky face in there. Maybe it sounds coy enough to make up for the complete lack of cleverness. It’s stupid because that’s what I like about the internet—that it gives you time to think about what you want to say before you say it. But my brain isn’t working right, I’m not sure it’s wise to publicly flirt with someone as LadyConstellation, and I don’t even know who rainmaker is. He could be some forty-year-old living in his parents’ basement with Cheeto dust on his fingers and a collection of vintage Star Wars T-shirts that no longer fit his ever-expanding stomach.

I went to the Twin Cities Romance Bookstore 2025 Crawl which was 8 stores in total and picked these up (all read) to start my physical HR novel collection. I usually read ebooks because it’s easier for me to pull those up on my phone whenever I have downtime but as I’m moving toward having a bigger home with space for a library I wanna start buying physical copies of my faves. 

Here is my list so far and what I didn’t find/why I didn’t buy it:

- [ ] The Perfect Rake - Anne Gracie
- [ ] Madeline Hunter Seducer series & spin offs 
- [ ] Kate Noble Blue Raven series
- [ ] Courtney Milan Brothers Sinister series
- [ ] The Duke’s Wicked Wife - Elizabeth Bright
- [ ] Any Hannah Dolby 
- [ ] Any Julia Bennet - specific covers they didn’t have 
- [ ] Charis Michaels Bachelor Lords of London and Brides of Belgravia series 
- [ ] Mimi Matthews Belles of London series - almost got these ugh but I didn’t wanna spend $100 along with the books above 
- [ ] Alexandra Vasti, Felicity Niven, Virginia Heath, Vivienne Lorret, Caroline Linden, Joanna Lowell, Emily Sullivan, Sophie Irwin - most of their work, found some but no full collections so I passed on this 
- [ ] The rake by Mary Jo Putney - they didn’t have this anywhere! 
- [ ] A momentary marriage by Candace camp - found every book but this one haha

So I have stopped anything related to caffeine even cola & chai. But tbh it gives a little rush of energy in a moment to complete your task. And as I am a student with upcoming exams so their is a need for coffee atleast once a day. 

Is their any substitute for this or a better time to take coffee, maybe before or after medicine so that it affects you less. 

Coz in past when I started the meds, I used to feel jumping of heart after taking a coffee and panic attack after some 4 hours. But now after 4 months on meds it has reduce a bit. But still their, I had coffee today after months and felt maybe 10% anxious even after taking beta blocker. So to be on safer side, I took my SOS tranxiety capsules. 

But I really wanna have coffee atleast once a day until exams. Do you guys have any suggestions ",2,1754852550.0,Anxiety,8,1.0,False
1mmqytf,https://www.reddit.com/r/hiking/comments/1mmqytf/my_cost_of_doing_the_salkantay_trek_solo/,My cost of doing the Salkantay Trek Solo,"Hello! I wanted to share my experience and all the costs of the Salkantay trek and Machu Picchu having nothing booked beforehand and doing it completely solo.

Day 1

I read that you could take a collective taxi to  Mollepata and then to Soraypampa. I waited for 30mins for the car to fill up at 5am. This cost 20 soles. Then another taxi to Soraypampa, I got lucky and there were two others that were doing the trek so this one cost 33 soles. In hindsight, I would've gone with a tour just to get to Soraypampa because you only save 10 soles and the tour just to Soraypampa costs 75 soles. From Soraypampa I walked to Soraypampa Hotel and checked into a dorm that cost 50 soles with dinner. They told me to leave shortly after 11am as there are fewer groups during this time. They were right and there were far less people. I walked up to the lake and returned, ate, and went to bed for the big day tomorrow.

Cost overview:

taxi collectivo arriving: 20 Soles
bread (5): 5 Soles
taxi (split in 3): 33 Soles
entry cost: 20 Soles
hostel plus dinner: 50 Soles

Total of the day: 128 Soles or 36 USD 

Day 2

This was by far the hardest day, I had breakfast at 5:30 am with the hostel. I was out the door by 6 am. I hiked the whole day without eating lunch on the way. I saw at least two opportunities for lunch, but didn't take them as I thought there would be more, there wasn't. I walked all the way to Chaullay and made it there for 1:30pm so I asked if I could have lunch there. In the end I stayed in Samana Wasi, I was the only one there and paid 95 soles for stay, lunch, dinner, and breakfast. For this day, I recommend stopping more and packing things for the cold as you will go up to 4700m and the warm, as you descend into a warm jungle. Bug spray is a must.

Cost overview 
Water 2.5:l 10 Soles
Hostel breakfast, lunch, dinner: 95 Soles
Total of the day: 105 Soles or 29 USD

Day 3

I started at 6 am again and the hostel owner gave me a tip. He recommended to go on the left side of the river as the walk is much nicer, harder, but nicer. It was. I walked through the jungle and was able to cross some not so safe looking bridges, but it was fun. The hike wasn't too hard and on the way, there were tons of things to try. Fresh papaya, coffee, avocado and more. I stopped at Sahuayaco for a coffee where the owner had a pet monkey which was pretty funny. He also showed me around the garden and how he made the coffee. It costed me 15 Soles for a coffee and a Powerade with a free quick tour. It is located south of the town on the right side if coming from the south of the 109. Not on Google maps, sorry. I walked to Lucmabamba and checked into Refugio de Mary.

Cost overview 

passionfruit + freezy: 3 Soles
banana: 1 Soles
coffee + Powerade + tour: 15 Soles
Refugio de Mery (breakfast + dinner): 70 Soles
candy + beer: 20 Soles

Total of the day: 109 Soles or 30 USD

Day 4

I started late in the morning as I traveled with some friends I made, about 8am. We walked to the mirador, which is incredible and you have your first view of Machu Picchu. We walked all the way to hydroelectrica and had lunch there. Then another two hours or so to Aguas callientes. It was the first time I had booked something a day before as I heard that the prices get out of hand. I arrived there at about 4-5pm and stood in line for Machu Picchu tickets. I waited only about an hour, but it felt much longer as my legs were rubber by this point. I booked the next available tickets, which was in three days. This is the part that I definitely recommend that if you know you want to do it, buy tickets online well in advance.

Cost overview 

Supertramp hostel 2 nights with breakfast: 136 Soles
Menu del Dia + Coca Cola: 15 Soles
Entrance to Machu Picchu: 156 Soles
Burger and water in hostel: 30 Soles

Total of the day: 337 Soles or 95 USD

Day 5-7

I will group these together as they are not mandatory, but this is how much I spent for the days in Aguas callientes. Note that this is the most expensive city I've been to in Peru and there aren't a lot of cheap options. I ate a lot at the central market which was cheap and tasty. One day the hostel was fully booked and I had to change for my last day to hostel mandor which wasn't bad as it's on the way to hydroelectrica and is right in nature. On day 7 I hiked to Machu Picchu which took an hour. The earliest ticket I was able to get was one pm and I enjoyed the view for about an hour and walked down as fast as possible to hydroelectrica to try and get a collective taxi back. I arrived back in Cusco after taking a taxi at 5pm at 10:30 pm. Apparently the taxis are cheaper before 3pm.

Cost overview of days 5-7

coffee: 10 Soles
menu del dia: 12 Soles
dinner chifa + cerveza: 30 Soles
pisco sour one and a bit: 17.5 Soles

Day 6

menu del dia: 12 Soles
mango juice: 10 Soles
coffee + cheesecake: 26 Soles
hostel mandor + dinner: 65 Soles
water: 5 Soles

Day 7	

sandwich mango juice: 16 Soles
coffee with alfajor: 16 Soles
Lunch 15: Soles
return to Cusco 5pm: 70 Soles

Total of the day: 289 Soles or 81 USD


Total of the entire trip: 988 Soles or 278 USD

In no way is this supposed to be a guide. I just couldn't find much information about how much the entire Trek + Machu Picchu would cost and wanted to give people like me, people who are curious, an estimate. For a budget traveler, it was expensive, but it's completely worth it as the views from the trek are amazing. The only other piece of advice I can give is that I don't have hiking shoes and always found it a bit extra to have them, but I did the trek with rubbish shoes and yes my feet hurt. If you can afford it, buy hiking shoes for this trek.
Feel free to write to me with any questions and travel on!

I'm a 26-year-old man, 5'9"" tall with fair skin, living in Calcutta and working as a Jr. Engineer in IT. While I’m financially independent and live with my family, I’m currently figuring out my career path and where I want to go next.

My hobbies range from reading novels, listening to music, and sketching/painting, to just enjoying quiet time. I used to drink often (beer and whiskey), but I’ve stopped drinking and quit smoking weeks ago.

I’m also working on my mental health with the help of a psychiatrist, and every day, I strive to be better than I was the day before. I work out every morning before work—more of a runner than a weight-lifter—and I find peace in nature, especially trees and plants. I believe in growth—both professionally and personally—and I’m always seeking ways to move forward.

I’m looking to connect with a like-minded woman (23-27) for a genuine, thoughtful connection. While physical attraction does matter, I value sharp wit, emotional maturity, and the ability to engage in meaningful conversations. I'm open to exchanging pictures if we connect.

I’m not perfect, but I’m patient, sincere, and always try to stay positive. I value simple conversations like ""How was your day?"" or ""How are you?"" because the little things can really make a difference. I’d love to connect with someone who enjoys sharing thoughts, daily experiences, and, hopefully, even meeting up for coffee and meaningful conversation.

When it comes to relationships, I believe emotional intimacy is just as important as physical intimacy. I see both as essential to building a genuine connection, and I respect boundaries in all aspects of a relationship. I’m not interested in casual encounters—mutual respect and understanding are key.

What gives?","Matched with a guy (29M) on Hinge about a week and a half ago. Our first conversation was basically just planning the date. I wanted to message him more, but I had already done most of the talking early on, so I left it to him to initiate. He didn’t, and later said he was “too busy.”

We finally met yesterday at a cafe. He was 10 minutes late, no apology. Paid for my coffee, conversation was good — we talked about values, family, hobbies. There was definitely some attraction; he told me I looked better in person, and I said the same to him.

That said, he did ask some odd questions early on (my “type,” celebrity crush, past relationships) and… randomly pulled a stethoscope  out of his bag to show me. He wasn’t working that day, so… why? ( didn’t ask him but it was odd)

He mentioned he had to go to church later, so our time was short. When we parted, he said, “I’ll see you in the future if we have a chance,” which already felt a bit off.

Four to five hours later, he texts saying we are “two different people” and “won’t be a match.” No real explanation. This was after saying mid-date that we would get along and could meet again.

Honestly, I’m confused. Date felt fine, there was mutual attraction, and we had no awkward silences. Anyone else had someone flip like this right after a seemingly good first date?

1mmqw41,https://www.reddit.com/r/NovelNexus/comments/1mmqw41/captivate_novel_by_carrie_jones_read_free_online/,Captivate Novel by Carrie Jones Read Free online:,"There are these bizarre people who actually like physical education class. You expect these people to grunt a lot and enjoy the great art of sweating. You expect them to wear designer PE gear and yell stuff like, “Dude, we are going to rock this freaking volleyball court.” While I don’t do any of those things, I swear I am still one of those bizarre PE-loving people.  
  
  That’s because Nick is in PE. But even with the cute Nick factor, I am not super psyched about being in the freezing-cold gym learning the rules of Ping-Pong today. I’m too busy being worried.  
  
  Coach Walsh has gathered us in a half circle around him and already gone through his whole hand-eye coordination speech and talked about the intricate rules of serving. I’m huddled up next to my best friend, Issie, for warmth. My teeth chatter. Coach Walsh is almost done with his whole speechifying bit but Nick is still not here. I want to not worry about him. I just want him to be safe. I squish even closer to little Issie, like she could make me feel better. Nick could be broken and mauled somewhere out in the woods. He could be bleeding and dying. He could be . . .  
  
  I grab Issie’s tiny arm and whisper, “Where is he?”  
  
  “He’s just running late.” She bounces on her toes and tries to be reassuring. She does not pull away. Issie is cool like that. She’s okay with human contact. “He’s fine. Every time any of us are late you imagine we’re dead. You are no longer allowed to imagine anyone is dead.”  
  
  “I’m not imagining he’s dead,” I whisper, but I’m totally imagining him bleeding to death on the snowy forest floor. Crows circle above him. A pixie arrow juts out of his beautiful chest. It’s the same thing I imagined about Devyn last week when he forgot to check in.  
  
  “You are such a liar-liar pants-on-fire.” Is kisses my cheek in her sweet friend way. “But I love you.”  
  
  “I just worry about people,” I whisper back. “If I’m not the one out there I feel so helpless.”  
  
  Coach Walsh notices we’re talking. “Girls, pay attention. And no kissing.”  
  
  Everyone starts snickering. I let go of Issie’s goose-bumpcovered arm. My face gets hot, which means I’m in insane blush mode. Nick thinks insane blush mode is cute. I bend down and check on my ankle bracelet that Nick gave me. It’s gold and thinchained. A tiny dolphin dangles off of it. The dolphin reminds me of Charleston because they swim right off the Battery. Next to it dangles a heart, which just reminds me of love—corny but true. I’m so afraid of losing the anklet, but I can’t take it off. I adore it that much.  
  
  “I’d pay for more kissing,” some jerk yells. I should know his name but I still don’t know everyone’s yet. I haven’t been here long enough and I’m not the best with names.  
  
  From his wheelchair Devyn power points at the guy, who probably outweighs him by a hundred pounds. Coach just gets this wicked twinkle in his eye, then ignores all of us and starts putting people in groups. Issie and Devyn and I clump together in the middle of the shiny gym floor. I drag the toe of my running shoe across it and straighten my shorts.  
  
  “Where is he?” I ask in a regular voice since Coach Walsh has moved away.  
  
  Devyn’s eyes stay calm. He is the most mellow of us, the most analytical, and the least likely to panic, which is part of the reason Issie unofficially loves him. “He’s just patrolling, Zara. I’m sure he’ll be here in a sec. He probably just got held up.”  
  
  I mutter, “He shouldn’t go out alone.”  
  
  “You can’t tell him that.” Devyn stretches his arms high above his head like he’s stretching out his wings. Even in a wheelchair he takes up a lot of space, moves a lot, seems like he’s going to fly away. “He’s compelled to go out alone. It’s his nature.”  
  
  “I know,” I murmur. Lately Devyn’s been telling me a lot about what is and what isn’t Nick’s nature. Nick shifts into a wolf. Wolves are . . . well, they hunt but they also protect. They sleep in huddled masses. They take care of their own. They are not like humans.  
  
  Devyn stops stretching. “It’s just not in the DNA.”  
  
  “Goes against the whole hero-complex thing you guys have,” Issie agrees. She bounces up and down, touches her toes. Her bunny T-shirt rides up a little in the back, exposing her bright orange underwear. “Isn’t that a helpful hint for the guide? ‘When dealing with pixies do not have a hero complex.’ ”  
  
  Devyn and I have started writing this guide. We call it How to Survive a Pixie Attack, which is a total takeoff from the zombie thing, but we figure it’s important to give people some helpful tips in case we ever go public someday. Truthfully, we’ll probably just post it anonymously on the Internet. A couple of months ago we didn’t know pixies even existed. Now it feels like capturing pixies is all we do.  
  
  “I’ll add it,” Devyn says, and his attention shifts. There’s movement at the door. Cold air rushes in. Winter in Maine is not fun.  
  
  Nick saunters into the gym and my heart basically stops. He’s ridiculously cute in his PE shorts and dark green T-shirt; and people that good-looking seem vulnerable, almost like they can’t be real.  
  
  He’s real, though. He’s all dark skin and dark hair and dark eyes. Okay. His eyebrows, like Devyn’s nose, are a little big and if you stare at him long enough you realize that his lips are a bit lopsided. I have kissed his lips. I have felt his breath in my ear and I know without a doubt that he’s real, even if he is a werewolf. The massive muscles in his legs redefine themselves as he walks toward me. He waves a late pass at the coach and yells, “Sorry I’m late. I’ve got a pass.”  
  
  “Not a problem, buddy,” Coach yells back. He and Nick are all jock bonding.  
  
  Nick pockets the note, which is probably a fake. I can smell his deodorant even though he’s still far away. There are these things called pheromones, odors that guys give off to attract women. I swear his pheromones have my freaking name written on them. They hone in and attack.  
  
  “You are getting all swoony faced,” Issie tells me with her singsong voice. She pokes me in the ribs with her elbow, gently. She turns to Devyn, who is smiling like a crazy man, just hanging back in his wheelchair watching the scene. “Dev. Look at Zara. She’s got her lovey-dovey look on.”  
  
  As Is gazes at Devyn with her own lovey-dovey look, he says, “Yeah. Teen love. So obvious. So hormonal.”  
  
  “I am not hormonal.” I fake glare at him.  
  
  He just laughs. Cassidy, this girl Dev supposedly dated back in fourth grade, waves to him. He smiles and waves back. Issie stiffens and I’m about to tell her Cassidy is no competition when Nick sidles up to us. He wraps his arm around my shoulder, pulling me against his side. I instinctively lean into his solid chest. I can’t help it. I breathe in his pheromones and get almost dizzy. He’s all woods and clean air and warmth. He kisses the top of my head.  
  
  “People! No PDA!” Coach Walsh heads over to us. He’s got four Ping-Pong paddles and a pack of balls.  
  
  Nick’s fingers tighten around mine for a second and then he lets me go.  
  
  “You four,” Coach barks. “Table tennis. Far table. You can handle that, Devyn?”  
  
  Devyn nods and reaches for his canes. Just a month ago Devyn couldn’t really stand. Now he’s walking a little bit. Doctors say it’s a miracle. We know better. Devyn, like Nick, isn’t quite human. He’s a shifter. He can change into an animal form—an eagle—and that makes him heal faster, heal better. What would’ve paralyzed a normal human? He’s beating it. Still, he can’t hide how impatient he is with the whole thing  
. Sometimes his lips shake because he’s so frustrated.  
  
  Is hands me a paddle and whispers, “He used to rock at Ping-Pong.”  
  
  I smile. “How does someone rock at Ping-Pong?”  
  
  “Just watch,” she says knowingly and gives Nick another paddle.  
  
  “It’s the bird in him,” Nick explains. “Crazy hand-eye coordination.”  
  
  “Are you bragging about me?” Dev asks. He’s got the paddle in the proper handshake position Coach Walsh drilled into us the other day.  
  
  “Yeah.” Is gets all fluttery and eyelashy. “We are.”  
  
  “It’s not really about the hand-eye, it’s about knowing where the ball is going, where you want the ball to go,” Devyn explains. “It’s like life. It’s all about purpose and direction. You can’t worry about it. You have to plan and predict and react.”  
  
  I swear Issie almost swoons.  
  
  “I’ve been doing some research about how pixies play into Norse myths,” he says. “It’s interesting stuff. Very obscure, though.”  
  
  “You going to inform us?” Nick serves.  
  
  Dev volleys back. “Not quite yet. Zara, I’m thinking about a chapter in the book, though, on the mythology. Is that kosher with you?”  
  
  “Yep.” I twirl my paddle in my hand and flick some lint off my vintage U2 T-shirt.  
  
  Nick hits the ball again. Dev volleys. The little fluorescent orange ball flies back and forth so fast I can’t really see it; just hear the click-pop of it on the hard table when it makes contact. I step away. So does Issie. The guys don’t even notice.  
  
  “So why were you late?” I ask.  
  
  “Patrolling.” Nick’s wrist flicks the ball back toward Devyn. Devyn counters.  
  
  “We know that, Macho One,” Issie says. She hunkers down low at the table like she’s actually going to get a chance to hit a ball. “But you’re late.”  
  
  We are all staring at him. Nick looks away.  
  
  “I had a little encounter,” Nick finally says. His forehead crinkles.  
  
  Devyn misses the ball. It skitters off the table and to the side. Issie runs to retrieve it, but it bounces and lobs under the other tables and keeps rolling across the shiny gym floor.  
  
  I push the hair out of my face so I can really examine him. He’s still all there. He is not dead. I ask, “Are you okay?”  
  
  Nick meets my gaze and he lifts his arms wide like I should inspect him. “Of course.”  
  
  Issie brings back the ball and hands it to Dev to serve, although it’s not technically his serve because he lost the volley.  
  
  “Cassidy sent you a note,” she says, her voice losing all its happy.  
  
  “Thanks.” Devyn pockets it, adjusts his canes, and leans forward a little but still serves the ball perfectly in a diagonal across the table. It bounces in front of me, but I don’t even really register it until Nick hits it for me. It bounces back to the other side. Issie crosses her arms in front of her chest and looks at the floor. She’s terrified that Dev might like Cassidy. She is really nice and everything, but totally not made of awesome the way Issie is.  
  
  “What are you guys talking about?” she asks.  
  
  “What made me late. It was a pixie,” Nick says. “I took care of it.”  
  
  Nick hits the ball a little too hard and it flashes over the table and hits the wall on the opposite side of the gym near Cassidy.  
  
  “I think I’ll let that one go,” Is says.  
  
  “You met up with a pixie and you didn’t call,” I say, my voice squeaking with frustration. “You didn’t call for help?”  
  
  Nick says all calm and easy, “It was too quick, baby.”  
  
  “Don’t ‘baby’ me,” I say jokingly but not really. “You know the rules. You call for help if you’re going to be late. That’s the rule for everyone, not just you. We’re all in danger here.”  
  
  “Uh-oh,” Is murmurs. “Maybe I will go get that ball. Or else I might go all teacher on you about how men use the term ‘baby’ in a negative way because they can’t deal with the empowering nature of birth and are jealous. Oops! I started already. Be right back.”  
  
  “Is has some major conflict-avoidance issues,” Devyn says, like we don’t already know.  
  
  “I didn’t need help,” Nick says, ignoring them both. He turns to face me again. His eyes are kind but his voice doesn’t lose the serious tone. “There wasn’t any time.”  
  
  “There is always time,” I insist. “It takes two seconds to send a text.”  
  
  Is returns with the ball. “Conflict all done?”  
  
  I nod but it’s not totally true. Nick has to stop taking unnecessary risks and I have to make him see that, but now is not the time. We’re in PE. Seriously. I bump Nick’s hip with my own before we get back in our proper Ping-Pong positions. “I win this argument.”  
  
  “Conflict all done,” Devyn assures her.  
  
  She smiles at him. “I serve.” She misses the ball. “Oops. You serve.”  
  
  Devyn does. I go to hit it but Nick takes it instead.  
  
  “Sorry,” he murmurs.  
  
  I roll my eyes at the irony as he and Devyn take over the game again. I try to follow where the ball is going, but I can’t predict its direction, let alone make it go where I want it to. I can’t stop myself from adding softly, “You’re always acting so hero and you’re going to get hurt.”  
  
  Nick stops and looks at me. “You were in class. I had study hall,” he says gently.  
  
  “Still, the protocol is that you spot one, you call for backup,” Issie says. “Not to fight or anything, but that is the protocol. Wow, I love that word.”  
  
  Dev came up with that term. Not that it matters. What matters is that we’re rounding up any stray pixies that head into our area. We take them and put them in a large house that we’ve surrounded with iron. The house is in the woods and hidden by a glamour, which is like a magic spell that prevents people from seeing what’s really there. I am not really cool with trapping them like that, but I don’t know how else to do it. They were dangerous. They were killing boys until we stopped them. They had needs, and those needs were out of control because their king was out of control. Pixie society is kind of hierarchical like that. The king and most of his local people are still trapped there, but every once in a while another pixie comes from far away.  
  
  We don’t know why.  
  
  We just know we have to stop them too.  
  
  Pixie Tip  
  
  Pixies do not look like Tinker Bell. Although they occasionally wear tutus. Seriously—who doesn’t?  
  
  Instead of getting real lunch in the cafeteria, Devyn and I grab some bagels and head into the library to do some research. I wave to the librarian, whose name I can never remember, which is just so wrong of me because she is super nice, and then we set up our laptops on one of the polished wood tables. The wood is so light it’s almost yellow. Devyn clunks his head on it when he plugs his computer’s power cord into the outlet.  
  
  “Ouch.” He drops the cord.  
  
  I grab it. “Here, let me.”  
  
  Little sparks of electricity flutter out and Devyn says, “Thanks.”  
  
  “Not a problem.”  
  
  The library is half full of people. Nobody’s whispering, but yelling is against the rules. There is a bunch of girls around one girl’s computer, giggling. The computer clicks. They are taking photos, I think. Some guy with dark clothes is bent over his screen. Two other guys are typing frantically away on their screens but I don’t know what they’re working on or playing. Dev and I are here to do research for our pixie book. It isn’t easy. Most of the stuff on the Web is about Tinker Bell and this old indie rock group from Boston.  
  
  “Why are all my hits about cats and rock bands?” I ask.  
  
  “Be patient.”  
  
  I try another site and scan it. “Okay, patience has shown me that this site is about a woman who is trying to get a PhD and wants to retire to Scotland and has a thing for cartoony images of women working while wearing short skirts.”  
  
  Devyn’s eyes light up. “Let me see that. Maybe she actually is one.”  
  
  “I doubt it.”<  
br />  
  “You don’t know.” He pokes his head out from around his screen and pulls apart a bagel.  
  
  In the last month we’ve checked out about twenty blogs that have to do with pixies. None of them have been actual pixies. Most of them have been people who really like fantasy novels, which is cool, but not what we need. “I am just tired of this. I want to do something. Be more proactive.”  
  
  He pauses before he sticks the bagel in his mouth. “Research is proactive.”  
  
  I snort. I can’t help it. “And so is patrolling.”  
  
  My phone vibrates. I smile. I can’t help that either.  
  
  “Nick?” Devyn asks. “It’s been how long since he’s seen you? Five minutes.”  
  
  “Five minutes,” I announce as I press the button that retrieves the message, “is a very long time.”  
  
  He actually rolls his eyes. “What’s it say, ‘I love you, baby’?”  
  
  “Shut up. It says, ‘Meet me by poetry.’ ” I bounce up, searching. “He’s in here.”  
  
  Devyn starts laughing. “You’re blowing me off, aren’t you?”  
  
  “Yep,” I say, trying to remember where the poetry books are. “You’re a better researcher than I am anyway.”  
  
  “Not true.”  
  
  I start walking toward the far back wall and then hustle back, lean over the desk, and whisper, “Look up pixie invasion. There’s far too many of them right now. It’s not normal.”  
  
  “Good idea.”  
  
  I fast-walk past the circulation desk, where the librarian is talking about source citation or something, and duck down one of the rows of Fiction Ca–Cz. Then I make a right. There are a lot of stacks in here. They reach the ceiling. Sometimes you have to use a step stool. It’s an amazing library for a high school actually, and I think—but I’m not sure—that poetry books are at the very end in the far left corner.  
  
  My phone vibrates again. I check the message: You coming?  
  
  I respond: Yes, impatient one.  
  
  The library smells like old and new books, coffee, and bagels. The light shafts in through some evenly spaced windows and it’s that perfect golden kind of light that makes everything seem like a big, happy glow. I step around the corner.

Nick smiles at me. He’s leaning against a big gray radiator. His thick black sweater rubs against the wall. For a second I want to be the wall. Okay, it’s longer than a second.  
  
  “Hey,” he says.  
  
  “Hey.” I smile back. “I thought you were blowing off lunch to go out patrolling with Issie.”  
  
  “I lied.” He squats down and picks up a small black backpack that I don’t recognize. He pulls out a beach towel and starts laying it on the floor.  
  
  “Here, let me help.” I grab at a bright blue towel that has a wave design on it. Our fingers meet. We get a shock but neither of us twitches away.  
  
  “Static electricity,” he murmurs. His mouth moves when he says it. It moves slowly, like he’s kissing me. I lean forward. He holds up a finger. “One second. Sit on the towel, baby.”  
  
  “Bossy.” But I sit down anyway.  
  
  “You are just as bossy.”  
  
  “True,” I concede.  
  
  He laughs and pulls out a big Ziploc bag of something dark and round. Cookies!  
  
  I lunge forward. “Are these—?”  
  
  “Chocolate with peanut butter chips,” he finishes for me.  
  
  I keep staring at his lips, but I slide open the baggie. “I love these! My mom always made these.”  
  
  “I know.”  
  
  “How do you know?”  
  
  “You told me once.”  
  
  He sits down with me and before I can get too heart fluttery he pulls out a cookie and lifts it toward my mouth, teasing me. “Do you want it?”  
  
  I open my lips. He slides the cookie in a little bit. I chomp down. It melts on my tongue. “It is sooo good.”  
  
  He laughs and leans back. He whispers, “You know we’re not supposed to eat back here.”  
  
  I swallow. “We are totally naughty.”  
  
  “Absolutely.” He bites into my cookie. “So there’s this annual dance in a couple of weeks.”  
  
  “The Winter Ball,” I interrupt. “There have been signs up everywhere.”  
  
  “You want to go?”  
  
  I think about it for a half second. “Will you dress up?”  
  
  He nods.  
  
  I move forward so my hands are flat on the towel and my face is much closer to his face. Something inside my chest warms up like a nice kind of heartburn and I say, “And will we slow dance?”  
  
  He nods again. His bottom lip turns in toward his mouth for a second, just disappears and then comes back.  
  
  Stretching out my spine so my lips are nearly touching his I say, “And will you press yourself against me and we’ll move really close together and then your hand will stretch out across the back of my head and your fingers will wrap into my hair and then . . .”  
  
  He doesn’t nod. He just tilts his head down, moves his fingers into my hair, and his lips touch mine in a forever kiss. His lips are soft and hard all at once. His breath mixes with my breath. Everything inside of me whooshes out. It’s just him and me and books and cookies.  
  
  “Is that what you want?” he asks when we finally break away.  
  
  I breathe in deep and then lift my lips to his ear. “That’s what I want.”  
  
  “And if I promise you that will happen, you’ll go to the dance with me?”  
  
  I sit back on my heels. “That and if you promise not to go patrolling alone.”  
  
  For a second he freezes, then he smiles and crosses his arms in front of him. “You are a pain, a royal pain in the—”  
  
  “But that’s why you love me, right?”  
  
  He tosses another cookie at me. “That and because you give me an excuse to make cookies.”  
  
  I catch the cookie in my left hand. “Good reasons. And do you want to know why I love you?”  
  
  “Because I am a fantastic cookie maker?” He breaks his cookie in half and puts it in his mouth.  
  
  “That’s part of it,” I admit. I nibble on my own cookie. I swallow. “But not all of it.”  
  
  A crumb falls onto his jeans. I brush it off for him as he says, “You’re making me wait for it, aren’t you?”  
  
  “Okay. I won’t torment you.” I cross my legs and smile at him. “I love you for the way you care about everyone, for how stubborn you are, for how you love Issie and Devyn.”  
  
  He leans down and kisses my forehead and then each of my eyelids. They are tender, these kisses. They are light and true. “I love you too, Zara.”  
  
  “I am so, so glad,” I sigh out. And I am.  
  
  The rest of the day is pretty uneventful. Nick works at the hospital after school and Issie and Devyn are at French Club, so I go running by myself. We’re allowed to run outside again because boys are no longer going missing. The school had stopped outdoor track practice for a while because Jay Dahlberg and the Beardsley boy were abducted by pixies. Nobody knew that it was pixies, they just knew boys were disappearing from the woods. Even now, only a few of us know what actually happened; everyone else thinks it was a serial killer.  
  
  Each time my foot hits the ground I hear my stepdad’s laugh. But running on snow, even hard-packed Maine snow that’s been flattened by snowmobiles, is just not as cool as running the streets of Charleston, my hometown, where it’s warm and smells like flowers, even in the winter.  
  
  Bedford is nothing like Charleston. My mom sent me up here because I couldn’t deal with my stepdad’s death. It was hard to get adjusted. There are about six thousand year-round residents here and the ocean is a cold menace that roars beyond the peninsula. Everything is trees and dirt and cold, at least in winter. I’ve never seen it in spring. Right now the bare branches of trees look like drowning arms reaching up for help. I stare and stare at the bark and see the shapes of spirits there. The dark knots where limbs used to be remind me of screaming mouths.  
  
  Still, I zip past the trees that line the track, swerve up the hill behind Bedford Building Supply, and keep following the trail. I’m thinking about how Devyn better not like Cassidy because he and Issie are so meant to be together. I’m thinking about how everyone in the universe seems to know this except Devyn. And that’s when I hear it. The sound is muffled but it’s definitely human.  
  
  Mrphh . . .  
  
  Little spider feelings prickle along my skin.  
  
  “Crud.”  
  
  I stop. I listen. I pull out my cell phone, punch in 9-1-1 but don’t hit Send. Because, seriously? What would I say?  
  
  Hi, operator/dispatcher person. This is Zara. I’m by the railroad tracks just past BBS and I think I hear something and I’ve got this prickly skin feeling. It’s like, um, well . . . I think it means the pixie king is nearby.  
  
  But that can’t be true. Because the pixie king is trapped in a house on the other side of town, which means . . .  
  
  “I’m imagining things,” I announce.  
  
  Mmrph. Mrupph.  
  
  The sound is off to the left. My head jerks up. I scan the wood for tracks. There are no tracks. No footprints at least, but something catches my eye. I squat down and touch the snow. There’s dust, just a tiny bit of it. It glitters.  
  
  Okay. Not imagining things.  
  
  Pixie kings leave gold glitter in their wake. Regular pixies? Not so much.  
  
  The wind blows through the naked tree branches. One of them creaks like the pressure is just too much and it wants to break right off and plummet to the earth. I know that feeling.  
  
  Mrmph!  
  
  The sound is urgent and I know what it is. It’s a voice. It’s a muffled voice, which means that someone is probably in trouble. I press my speed dial for Nick. He’s at work so he doesn’t pick up. Cell phones aren’t allowed at the hospital. Right. Duh. His voice mail comes on.  
  
  “Hey, Nick. It’s me,” I whisper, turning slowly in a circle, looking for predators. “I’m near BBS by the tracks, running. I think . . . I hear something. Okay. Yeah. I’m going to check it out. If I don’t call again, I’m probably dead or something. Yeah. Right. Bye.”  
  
  Mrmph.  
  
  I slink forward across the crunchy whiteness, cautious, looking up into the branches of the trees to make sure nothing is waiting to jump down and attack. I’m being paranoid, I know, but  
a lack of paranoia can be hazardous to your health. I start thinking about phobias. It’s my thing. I chant them to make me less nervous.  
  
  Albuminurophobia, fear of kidney disease.  
  
  Philemaphobia or philematophobia, fear of kissing.  
  
  Genuphobia, fear of knees.  
  
  It’s not helping. I’m in about twenty feet when I spot the source of the noise. It’s a guy. He’s tied up to a big spruce tree. He’s blond. There’s duct tape over his mouth, and barbed wire wrapped around his body. The only thing that’s keeping him upright is the wire and what’s left of his will, I guess. The pixies have almost killed him.  
  
  Unless he’s the pixie. Maybe he’s the one Nick had the run-in with, but Nick wouldn’t just tie him up and leave him here, would he?  
  
  The answer: maybe.  
  
  My stomach falls. The guy’s eyes plead with me. He looks like he’s about to die. Pixie or not, I run toward him. I rip off my gloves. They flop on the ground near his feet, a puddle of blackness by his leather boots. It starts snowing down on us, big heavy waterfilled flakes the size of my thumb. I work on the wire, but it’s so cold that it stings my skin. I jump back. My fingers curl up, protecting themselves.  
  
  “Mrrphh . . . Mrr . . . ” His voice is desperate and matches the look in his green eyes. Somehow I know what he wants me to do.  
  
  I uncurl my fingers and reach up. “This might hurt.”  
  
  I feel bad ripping the tape off him, but I do it. I get my nail around an edge and yank. It comes off in a big sticky rush.  
  
  “Put your gloves on and then untie me.” His voice is low and has a slight accent that I don’t recognize. Almost Irish. Almost not. “Please. She is coming for—”  
  
  “Was it pixies? Did they do this to you? I saw the glitter. Or are you the pixie? I need to know.” Guilt rushes into me. I know they are evil but to see one so hurt, if he is one—okay, he probably is one, but it doesn’t matter. “I need to know if you’re still in danger.”  
  
  Every word he speaks seems to take incredible effort. His lips move so slowly. “What? She is . . . I am not prepared to die.”  
  
  “You won’t die.” I grab my gloves off the snow, shoving them on again. He’s a pixie, I know it, but I can’t just let him die. Something in my heart twinges for him. It would be awful to be here, tied to a tree, waiting to die. “If you promise not to hurt me, I promise I won’t let you die.”  
  
  “I am attempting not to, but if she comes, then—”  
  
  I’m yanking at the wire when his voice breaks off.  
  
  “Watch out!” he manages to yell.  
  
  I whirl around. A glove drops. The other is barely halfway on. A woman stands in front of me. She’s tiny but beautiful, with long, flowing black hair and dark skin. I think I gasp.  
  
  “Please, do not let her take me,” he whispers as I back up.  
  
  “I won’t.” I’m not sure how I’m going to keep that promise. There’s something menacing about her. And yes, it might be because she has this armored breastplate thing over her dark green velvety dress, but it might be something else, like the scary-intense look in her eyes.  
  
  “You know I have to take you with me, warrior.” Her voice is strong. Her eyes flash. She steps forward. Her hands are slender and delicate but they somehow look absolutely deadly.  
  
  I put up my own somewhat wimpy arms. “Hold on a second. Time-out. Okay?”  
  
  She smirks. “Are you attempting to stop me, little one?”  
  
  “Excuse me? Did you just call me ‘little one’? What are you? Like, four feet tall?” I ask. My temper comes through, turning my voice a little bitter.  
  
  The guy behind me gasps. “Do not.”  
  
  The woman just smiles and takes another step forward. “It is my sacred duty to take the fallen warriors with me.”  
  
  “With you where?” I scoop up the glove and step back so I can start working on his wire again. I do it like I’m so casual, like my heart isn’t beating eighteen hundred beats a minute or anything, like this woman doesn’t have tiny little fangs sticking out on her lip.  
  
  “Valhalla.”  
  
  I search my brain. Devyn’s been telling me about myths, and I think he mentioned that word before. The data doesn’t totally compute and I go, “Valhalla? As in all that Norse myth stuff? It is Norse, right? The god Odin? Is that the one?”  
  
  She rushes forward. Claws form where fingers should be. One tips into the flesh of my cheek. It cuts my skin. Her eyes stare into mine, cold and harsh. Snowflakes land on her eyelashes.  
  
  “Do you dare speak his name, human?” she says, with all this confidence and menace. “You are puny and helpless against one such as he.”  
  
  The prick of her claw seems to resonate all the way through me. It feels like something fundamental inside has shifted. Dizziness threatens but I struggle to keep it down and look away from her and stare instead at the captive guy. I keep working at the wire. It’s a knot. I’m good with knots, though. I don’t move my cheek away. I won’t show fear. “Whose name? Odin?”  
  
  Finally the knot comes undone. I yank at the wire and the pixie guy falls forward. I leap and catch him. He struggles to stay upright, leaning into my side. Both my arms wrap around his chest. The snow crunches beneath us. The trees around us sway with the wind.  
  
  The woman hisses, then sniffs the air. The world is chill and gray and without color. She looks at me accusingly. “You are not human.”  
  
  I struggle to keep the guy steady. “Of course I’m human.”  
  
  Her eyes narrow a little bit. “No . . . not all.” Her features form into a mask of disgust. “You are a halfling.”  
  
  The guy gets a little bit rigid and starts to shake. Our feet shuffle in the snow as I try to keep him upright. I lean him a little against the hard, rumpled bark of the tree.  
  
  “Whatever.” I pull in a deep breath, try to ignore the claws and the fangs, and think about the knife tucked into my sock. I’d have to drop the guy to get it out. My mind is working overtime trying to figure out how to be casual about it. I keep talking. “My point is that you can’t take him.”  
  
  She crosses her arms over her chest. “And why not?”  
  
  A pine cone tumbles onto the snow. It looks so strange with all its rough brown edges surrounded by bland whiteness. I try to think up an answer.  
  
  The guy speaks. “Because I am not fallen. I am still alive.”  
  
  “Not for long.” A wicked smile creeps over her features. Her tongue leaps out to capture a snowflake. The wind whistles through the tree limbs. We are so alone out here.  
  
  “Yes, for long.” I glare at her. “I am going to get him proper medical care and he will be just fine.”  
  
  “Proper medical care?” She snorts. “Do you know what he is, halfling? Gaze upon him.”  
  
  “Do not call me halfling.”  
  
  “You have no strength.” She gets a look on her face that would rival a haughty supermodel who just landed a five-million-dollar contract. “You can barely support his weight.”  
  
  She’s right. The world waits in silence. An unbearable whiteness covers us as snow falls from a cloudy sky. I sniff. My nose is running. The pixie guy moans softly. The sound is filled with sadness and pain and despair. He is vulnerable. Pixie or not, he needs me.  
  
  I steel myself. “I’m not giving him up.”  
  
  She lifts an eyebrow, as if she’s pondering what the heck is going on. I’d like to ponder what the heck is going on too, but I’m busy trying to just keep standing. The cold sinks into my feet, into my bones.  
  
  She says, “There is a possibility that he may live now because you have interfered.”  
  
  I wait.  
  
  “What we offer him is a reward, not a punishment,” she soothes. “I swear this. After his death he will fight by Odin’s side in the greatest battle of all.”  
  
  His words stiffen out between his teeth, hard and fierce. “I am not ready to die. I have work here. I. Can. Not. Die.”  
  
  Another pine cone lets go of a tree branch and falls from the sky. It hits me in the shoulder and then tumbles the rest of the way to the ground. Tiny ridges of  
it break off and stick to the snow, left behind. The wind blows hard and wicked against all of us. It is hard for me to hold us up, but the woman does not sway.  
  
  “I see.” Feathers sprout from her back. Menace turns her eyes red. Her hair spirals out behind her, lifting in the wind. Instead of being beautiful, it’s terrifying.  
  
  I stagger away a little. The guy’s arm comes up around my waist, and even though he’s barely capable of standing up it’s pretty obvious he’s trying to protect me from her. The wind ruffles his blond hair.  
  
  “I shall not hurt the little halfling,” she says. That’s when I realize that the feathers on her back are wings, graceful and glistening like a swan’s, but jet black.  
  
  I don’t know what to think of her. I don’t know what to say or do. I just stand there shivering, from cold or fear or both.  
  
  “Your mouth hangs open,” she says, almost smiling. “I shall let you keep this one because he may survive now that you are here. You will have to decide if that is a good thing or not, halfling.”  
  
  I start to protest.  
  
  She holds out her hand. “Also, there will be other warriors soon. Death is coming. It is on the wind. Can you feel it?”  
  
  As she says it I think I can—a low menace, a waiting storm. The snow swirls around us. She nods her head at me and lifts up. Her swan wings spread out and she soars up into the air to meet the whiteness of the sky.  
  
  I stagger sideways and fall. The guy lands on top of me. He starts laughing, a soft, crazy, exhausted laugh. “Sorry. Sorry. Wow . . . wow . . . that was close. I thought—” He interrupts himself and starts laughing again. The movement makes him wince, then moan.  
  
  I pull myself out from underneath him, worried that he’s totally insane. “Are you going to be okay?”  
  
  He shakes his head. Then he nods. A trembling hand, square and scratched, reaches up to rub where his hair touches his forehead. His eyes meet my eyes. His lips move. “Thank you.”  
  
  Then he passes out.  
  
  Great.  
  
  Pixie Tip  
  
  Pixies are not good. They are evil. Not bad-hair-day evil, but scary-movie-that-still-freaks-you-out-when-you-go-to-bed evil. Actually? Way worse.

Study Plan + At Home Exam Logistics,"Firstly, THANK YOU to everyone in this sub. The advice that I found here guided my entire study and testing plan. So many SMEs and Servant Leaders haha <3

Study Tools:

* Andrew Ramdayal's (AR) 35 Hour Exam Prep Course on Udemy
   * Watched on 2x speed and finished the videos within 2 weeks
   * Price: $20
* Mohammed Rahman's (MR) Mindset on YouTube
   * Video title: \[CRASH COURSE\] Full PMP Mindset Training + Workbook
   * All 23 tips are covered in the first hour of the video. I didn't watch past that.
   * These mindset tips are more exam specific, while AR's are more wholistic to being a PM.
   * Price: Free
* PMI Study Hall Plus
   * Took a 15-question mini exam every morning
   * Took full-length mock exams 1, 2, and 3 the Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday prior to my Saturday exam and scored 77, 80, 74.
      * I chose not to take 4 and 5 because I have heard there are more Expert questions and I didn't want to kill my confidence or momentum.
   * Price: $80
* AR's 200 Ultra hard Questions Series, 1-50
   * Video title: 200 Ultra Hard PMP Questions 1-200
   * Free

The morning of my exam, I warmed up by reviewing my MR mindset notes and playing AR's 200 Ultra Hard questions video while I drank my coffee. Of the 50 questions I got through, I was confident in about 80% of the answers upon first read-through. I felt very good going into the exam.

Candidly, I found about 50% of the exam to be more challenging than the Study Hall full-length mock exams and more aligned with the mini exams. Wordier questions that had less key context clues from MR's mindset. Knowing the wholistic mindset, not just how to take the test, is crucial.

I finished all of my mock exams with more than 30 minutes to spare, but I used every second of the actual exam time and had time to review about 5 questions total.

While Study Hall is a fantastic tool, be mentally prepared for the exam to be a different experience.

I received my results after just 21 hours from my check-in time. The time after your exam and before you receive your results is torture. Plan some activities to stay busy and distracted!

Additionally, I want to share some specifics about my at home testing experience. As a planner, I found some of this information frustratingly hard to find prior to the exam.

* I booked my exam the night before taking it. There were plenty of timeslots available. I kept an eye on the availability throughout the week, but waited until the last minute to ensure I felt good mentally and physically.
* The check-in window is 30 minutes, and the process took me about 15 minutes.
* Once you do the system test, you cannot leave your desk and are being recorded. Your phone has to be across the room at this point, so you're just sitting there waiting for them to verify your photos. (I never spoke to or saw a proctor.) I did some deep breathing during this time haha. But basically show up to check-in as if it's your exam start time because you won't really have the option to step away again.
* After the photos of your space, ID, etc. are verified, the exam begins automatically. This meant I began testing prior to my scheduled time.
* I left a desk mat and wrist rest on my desk, and the proctor did not tell me I couldn't have them.
   * This was lucky. These items are not technically on the approved items list.
   * They are both solid, light colors. Not sure if that helped.
* You can have beverages in a clear glass on your desk. I had both water and iced coffee.
* There is an optional 7 minute tutorial prior to the exam that does not take away from your 230 minutes. I would recommend clicking through. It goes through a lot of these logistics, as well as the optional keyboard shortcuts (there are also clickable buttons, don't worry). I don't remember all of the shortcuts, but sharing what I can recall.
   * Alt+J to Highlight
      * You can highlight in 5 colors! I used this heavily, and color option were a great surprise.
   * Alt+W to Strikethrough
   * Alt+N to the Next question
   * Alt+P to the Previous question
* The breaks occur after 60 questions. You can opt in or opt out. Your countdown time is paused during the break, and there is a countdown showing your break time allowance.
   * After you click End Review of your 60 question set, you will get a screen offering you the break. You need to opt-in before getting up! If you take too long to read the screen, you will automatically be opted into the break.
   * You can hit End Break early to resume the test, or you can wait for the clock to rundown and the test will restart automatically.
   * The camera and mic continue recording during the break. You can get up and leave your space, but obviously can't bring notes to your desk, etc.
   * I found the breaks useful not only to step away, but also as a tool to monitor my time management.
* At the end of each 60 question section, prior to the break option, you have the option to review the questions from that set. You can Review All, Review Flagged, or click into each question individually.
   * When you're done reviewing, there is an End Review button. Once you click this, there's no going back. You will move on to the optional break.
   * I was tight on time and did not review any questions from the first 2 question sets, prioritizing time management.
* The exam countdown clock starts at ""230 minutes,"" not ""3 hours 50 minutes"". Know your 1/3 checkpoints are at around 155 and 80 minutes.
   * You will get a 5 minute warning pop-up at the end.
* There is a question counter (unlike Study Hall) showing you what number question you're on, right below the time countdown on the top right screen corner. I found this very helpful to track progress, vs. the % of completion on Study Hall.
   * Ex: 44 of 180

Go in with confidence, listen to your gut feeling when you are struggling with a question, and watch the clock. You can do this!",11,1754852194.0,pmp,3,1.0,False

My background is in 3D animation, which I taught for years before deciding to leap into a whole new dimension, storytelling. My debut novel is called Vanguardian Saga: The Road to Molz Dorn. It's about an elite black ops team of anthropomorphic heroes being sent on an impossible mission on a hostile planet. Think of it as *G.I. Joe* meets *Zootopia* and *Gears of War*. 

Enter the *Vanguardian Saga* universe, where the hero, Kahl Striver, prowls. He’s a black-ops tiger soldier with a knack for surviving impossible missions with his team of space marines and making enemies wish they’d stayed in bed. The novel is a fast-paced space opera for ages 12 and up, inspired by the pulse-pounding anime of the 90s that I loved. Stuff like *Ghost in the Shell*, *Ninja Scroll, Outlaw Star,* and built for readers who crave that same mix of grit, spectacle, heart, and a little bit of gore.

If you like stuff like that, try it out. If you have questions about the book, I'll be happy to answer them.

It was deer season and the nip in the air made me rethink my morning run. Usually I jog around the lake right away in the morning, totaling a little over a mile and a half but that day was cold and, like I said, it was deer season. Even though I was planning on wearing a blaze orange vest so I won't accidentally get shot, shit does happen.

Around the time the coffee pot started dripping, my cousin Richard called. 

We are not close, never were. Never had the opportunity to know the other one, really. The only things I know about him is what I read on his Facebook page, which is enough for me to nod in acknowledgement when I see him around, but for the most part I just try to avoid him. 

Both he and his wife are the same, at least from what I see on the internet. You know the kind of person I am talking about. Always ranting about “them versus us”, spreading AI videos “proving” the existence of an ancient giant samurai race (Not a race, by the way) and how some “shadowy archaeologist illuminati” is covering it up… 

“Hey Richard, what’s—” I started.

“Get over here. Quick” Richard said, out of breath. 

“Whats go—” I started but before I could finish Richard repeated himself.

“Get over here, man. Bring your guns” he said before hanging up.

Spring Court felt like a fairytale written into the land itself.

1mmqkz3,https://www.reddit.com/r/Hyperhidrosis/comments/1mmqkz3/iontophoresis_san_pellegrino/,Iontophoresis - San Pellegrino,"I just wanted to share my experience and see if anyone else has any tips.

I’ve had sweaty palms for as long as I can remember, always dreading handshakes and feeling embarrassed when I left sweat marks on something I’d touched.

Then I stumbled across a post mentioning iontophoresis. After some research, I decided to give it a try, but I didn’t want to spend a large amount on a machine without knowing if it would work. From what I learned, I ended up buying:
	•	12V 7ah battery – £15
	•	Aluminium trays – £5
	•	Leads – £3
	•	6 bottles of San Pellegrino sparkling water – £5

Total: £26
(All from Amazon.)

I chose San Pellegrino because several people online had mentioned it worked well for them.

Once I had everything set up, I did 15 minutes per palm for 5 consecutive days. By day 3, I noticed a big difference. Day 4 brought even more improvement, and by day 5, my palms were completely dry.

Since then, I’ve only needed to do a 15-minute session per palm once a week to maintain the results. It’s been amazing, the only time I notice any moisture is if I’ve had 2–3 coffees at work, and even then, they’re only slightly clammy. Even during sports, my palms stay dry while the rest of me is dripping with sweat.

I did notice some extra sweating in other areas, particularly my forehead, but that seems to have lessened over time.

When I ran out of San Pellegrino, I tried tap water with Epsom salts. That turned out to be a mistake — my palms became sweaty again. I’ve gone back to San Pellegrino and am doing another 5-day run to get things under control again.

Has anyone else had similar results? Do you find that it needs to be this specific brand, or will any sparkling mineral water do the trick?",2,1754851678.0,Hyperhidrosis,2,1.0,False

I have only recently gotten into this world, but couldn't pass that up of course!

Went in, and man was I surprised and overwhelmed. Talked to the owner (luckily it wasn't busy when I came in): they had 1400 scents in there. Insanity. So we talked a bit and after he learned that I was very interested and knew a bit about it, he very enthusiastically took me around the store to sample loads of scents. It must have been dozens (Thank God for coffee beans smell-resets!). Although I already own like 20 perfumes, I learned a lot about my frag preferences:

1. I (26M for context) like them sweet, fruity, and/or fresh. And by sweet I mean SWEET. My preference leans more towards feminine-type frags than male.

2. I despise heavy leather, tobacco and oud notes.

3. I got insanely lucky with my winter frag blind buys (The Kingdom and Liquid Brun), because I did not like most male-leaning fall/winter frags I sampled due to 2.

4. Best one I smelt by a long shot: Opulent Dubai (GOF dupe). Tropical mango punch in the gut that really appears to last.

5. I need a bigger bank account (lol)

So I had always been straight-up with the owner that I could not spend a lot due to already buying a lot recently (hurray, self-restraint!), but he was obviously just very happy to help and talk to someone with interest in fragrances and not just coming in to pick up the next hype frags. Ended up leaving with 6 50mL frags for €30 (could've also gotten 1 but I like the diversity for now), and the owner even threw in a freebie to try.

It was so fun to learn from and talk with someone that knows so much about these perfumes, I spent like 2 hours in there. I'll start saving up monthly to visit this store once or twice a year to support the owner and scratch the buying itch. These stores need to be cherished, and no more blind buys for me! And I'm definitely buying Opulent Dubai then.

1mmqd1b,https://www.reddit.com/r/ReviewTheRoom/comments/1mmqd1b/can_the_ninja_cfp301_coffee_maker_truly_upgrade/,Can the Ninja CFP301 Coffee Maker Truly Upgrade Your Morning Routine?,"The Ninja CFP301 DualBrew Pro made its debut on my kitchen counter a couple of weeks ago and quickly became the star of my mornings. I’ll admit, I have a love-hate relationship with coffee makers—some over-promise and under-deliver—but this one intrigued me with its dual functionality for pods and grounds. As a long-time coffee enthusiast, I was eager to see if this coffee machine could live up to its praise. Spoiler: mostly, it did, but there are a few quirks worth mentioning.

**A Sleek Yet Functional Design**  
This coffee maker has a modern, black finish that easily complements a range of kitchen aesthetics. Its compact footprint is a relief for someone like me who’s perpetually juggling kitchen counter space. Measuring at 15.5 x 11.4 x 9.1 inches, it didn't require any strategic rearranging to fit. The built-in frother is a neat touch—I always appreciate it when a machine encourages you to experiment with your coffee creations.

Of course, the layout of the machine reflects thoughtful engineering. The ability to switch effortlessly between K-cup pods and traditional coffee grounds feels genuinely innovative. That said, the initial setup process, with figuring out all the attachments and components like the reusable grounds filter and separate water dispenser, did take a little patience. Coffee making as soon as unwrapping didn’t happen, but the learning curve wasn’t daunting either.  

**Performance and Brewing Speed**  
If you’re the kind who's always running late in the morning like me, the speed of this coffee maker will win you over. It brews faster than my last single-serve coffee maker, especially when using K-Cups. Put simply—this machine doesn’t leave you impatiently tapping your fingers on the countertop.  

The four brewing styles (Classic, Rich, Over Ice, and Specialty) really allow you to experiment with how you take your coffee. Personally, the Rich mode became my go-to because it delivered stronger flavors—perfect for someone who dislikes watery coffee. Meanwhile, the Over Ice mode caught my attention during warmer days, though it does dilute if you’re heavy-handed with the ice. Specialty mode, on the other hand, feels like having the option of making café-style lattes and cappuccinos at home without needing to splurge on extra equipment. 

**Pluses**  
- The separate hot water system is genuinely handy! Despite the Ninja CFP301 being marketed as a coffee maker, it doubles as my late-night tea brewer or oatmeal prep assistant.  
- Brew-size flexibility. Whether you need a single cup or a full carafe (96 oz capacity), this machine’s got your back. And trust me—being able to brew for just yourself or a group without sacrificing quality is a breath of fresh air.
- The reusable grounds filter. If you care about less waste, this feature is a winner. Also, switching between pods and grounds is surprisingly seamless, helping users like me who alternate depending on what’s in the pantry.  

[Check Ninja CFP301 DualBrew Pro price on Amazon.](https://ngadgets.com/p/b0btp84qm5/)  

**Negatives**  
- Cleaning can feel a bit overwhelming. Pieces like the detachable frother, reusable grounds filter, and carafe need regular cleaning, and missing even one step leaves you with a less-than-perfect brewing experience. While this isn't a dealbreaker, it still adds to day-to-day maintenance.  
- The heat retention wasn’t as great as I hoped for the glass carafe. If you’re not consuming the brew immediately, you’ll need to compromise on temperature consistency unless you transfer to a thermal carafe.  

**Competing Products in the Market**  
Comparing this to similar competitors like Keurig K-Elite or Breville Bambino, I’d say this Ninja coffee maker stands out for its flexibility and price-to-performance ratio. The all-in-one design featuring the frother and multiple brew styles is something the Keurig systems don’t fully offer without add-ons. Breville models, while great for true espresso lovers, are limited if you want large-batch brewing options. Where the Ninja CFP301 lags behind competitors is perhaps in the lack of a stainless steel carafe option and slightly more involved maintenance compared to some sleeker single-serve machines.

**Worth Every Penny?**  
Talking about the value, I genuinely think that the amount of flexibility this machine offers makes it worth its cost. Sure, it's not the cheapest on the market, but considering it caters to K-cup lovers, traditional grounds users, and even frothy coffee drinkers, you’re getting pretty solid utility. It feels refreshing to own a machine that can do so much without demanding extra attachments or constant troubleshooting.

Right now I have one kid and could quickly get there by just spamming sleep but that feels lame to me.  All I do is give my spouse a gift, harvest my coffee grapes and statues and go to bed.  Ginger Island and the green house are all ancient fruit and every Thursday I harvest them and put them in my keg and preserve sheds and I sell last week's out put.

At my farm I just plant crops that can become giant fruit and ignore them.  My day ends by 8am unless its ancient fruit day then I'm in by noon.

The only thing different I do is at the end of every month I will grind lvl 70 to 80 of the mines with monster musk until I have 500 bone chips for 500 Deluxe Speed Gro but because I have so many giant crops I have a surplus of Deluxe Speed Gro(800+) and don't even need to grind anymore.

Mid twenties crisis, FOMO, lonliness thudangiya ella vevaladhikalum vettayadiyirunn kalaghattam. 

I mean think about breaking apart from the love of your life, attending her wedding and running back mid way, all in the middle of a vacation, your boy supposed to enjoy. Talk about the money I had to spend just to get over that phase. Phew.

And guys, I was strictly talking about therapy, no kulsitha parupaadis.

Ngl, tough time, aaa maravicha lyfilot aanu kann ezhuthi pottum thotta a Sri Lankan sundari kandannu varunnath. 

-1000 aura (cringe dei 🤮)

Jokes aside, fist sightil thanne, your boy flat ayi. He used to see her every day in bus, as they commuted together. 

But your boy was too insecure and nervous to initiate a conversation.

I mean how can I? I will give you the exact reference.

Remember that scene where Sobhana & Suresh Gopi was in a taxi in chennai, commuting back home? 

Yeah that movie “varane avashyam und”.

That was the scene every single day. How can I invade someone's personal space and say hi.

Phew. Not possible.

But your boy had a better idea!

Infact a bunch of ideas!!

Idea 1: How bout I befriend her guy friend from bus, fake a job reference and got to know more about her?

Bro, that's pure evil. 
Ogay, Plan dropped.

Idea 2: How about I buy a set of expensive chocolates and distribute in the bus stating that I got em free from my company? 

I mean, what if she says thank you, I can then ask her name and go from there? Huh? Huh?

But bro, that's too expensive and what if you can't pull this off?!

Phew.

Idea 3: How about I write a letter to her, of course not a love letter. But a fun one with borderline mystery?

Hmm, interesting.

Okay! But let's evaluate this logically.

What if she finds it uncomfortable? Strange? Weird? Cringe? 

Or

Interesting? Fun ? Exciting 🤌

Your boy was too dumb, he went with it.

Okay. Now how do I craft a letter that's interesting, fun, not creepy but mysterious and filled with clues and interesting references? 

I mean if she looks deep, my handsome face is written all over it! 

From there it's a win!!! Ye yee!!

Now you have to remember,

The last time I wrote a letter was in 2009, and that too, to my grandpa.

Back then we use to talk about Ramayana specifically hanuman. Fast forward to now, and our conversations have somehow pivoted to philosophy, AI and robots!

Poor guy is just praying AI doesn’t kick my ass out of relevance. LOL.

Anyways back to the story, your boy mustered all the power he could get, extracted the last bit of creativity left in him and milked chatGPT till all my tokens ran out. 

Your boy did it! 

The perfect letter! 

Now execution! 

I got her name, I got her company name. Now what?

Just send…..

And I did….

Fast forward 3 weeks, I found myself sitting in front of her, with a half healed brused lips, slightly broken self respect and a smiling face, shamelessly sipping filter coffee in a pure tamil restaurant.

What happened in between was the most awkward, exciting and painful three weeks of my entire life.

Ok now, I'm gonna see if some of you can guess what happened.

I will give u guys a clue. So your smart ass boy send this letter to her company address 🫠

by [https://www.gptsportswriter.com](https://www.gptsportswriter.com) **Moreirense vs. Alverca: A Clash of Consistency and Nerves in the 2025/26 Liga Portugal Opener**

**Parse the Odds: The Numbers Don’t Lie (Mostly)**  
Let’s cut to the chase: Moreirense is the favorite here, and the odds aren’t whispering—they’re shouting. At decimal prices hovering around **1.91** (equivalent to **-105** in American odds), Moreirense has an implied probability of **\~52.3%** to win. Alverca, the newly promoted underdog, sits at **\~23.8%** (decimal **4.2**), while the draw lurks at **\~30.3%** (decimal **3.3**). Bookmakers are essentially saying Moreirense is twice as likely to win as Alverca, and three times as likely as a tie.

The spread bets reinforce this: Moreirense is favored by **0.5 goals**, meaning they’re expected to win outright. Backing Alverca on the spread (+0.5) would require them to avoid losing, a tall order for a team adjusting to top-flight football. Meanwhile, the total goalsline is set at **2.25**, with slightly better odds on the **Under** (**-105**). In short, the numbers suggest a tight, low-scoring affair where Moreirense’s defense—consistent as a Portuguese soufflé—will hold firm.

**Digest the News: Promoted Peril vs. Seasoned Stability**  
Moreirense enters this matchup as the “elder statesman” of the two. Last season, they were the kind of team that makes you think, *“Oh, they’re just here to fill space between the big clubs.”* But don’t be fooled—consistency is their middle name (and their backup goalkeeper’s name, probably). They finished last season with a defensive record that would make a vault manufacturer jealous, and their home form at Estádio do Moreirense is as reliable as a coffee machine in a writer’s office.

Alverca, meanwhile, is the story of a team that’s been promoted faster than a tourist in Lisbon during rush hour. Led by coach **Vasco Botelho da Costa**, who previously guided th

""You've weathered countless storms over the years. Welcome home, Arabella.""  
  
At the celebratory dinner, a young man in a perfectly tailored suit found himself unwilling to look away from Arabella Stanley.   
  
She possessed an otherworldly beauty, her sharp features sculpted with precision and wrapped in an aura of cool detachment.   
  
Her piercing eyes revealed nothing of her inner thoughts, and when she spoke, her voice carried the same arctic chill. ""I'm leaving now.""  
  
Joshua Willis, the young man, seized the moment without hesitation. ""Allow me to drive you home.""  
  
Arabella offered no resistance.   
  
The car glided through the night. The city lights blurred past as Joshua stole glances at her profile.  
  
""When do you plan to return to the company? Our empire continues to flourish.""  
  
Their partnership had begun years ago through a chance project, and Joshua had witnessed Arabella's brilliance firsthand.   
  
He had persuaded her to join forces, and together they had forged a company that now dominated the entire industry.   
  
Arabella maintained her measured tone. ""I'll decide when the time feels right. For now, I simply want to reach home.""  
  
""Understood completely. You must be eager to reunite with Daisy. She's undoubtedly thriving. I've been directing all the premium projects to your aunt's husband throughout these years."" Joshua's grin widened as he angled for recognition.   
  
Arabella and her twin sister Daisy Stanley had lost their parents at the tender age of six, and their aunt Meagan Tucker had stepped in to care for them both.   
  
Arabella acknowledged him with a subtle nod. ""I appreciate that.""  
  
Her delicate fingers found the cherry blossom pendant resting against her throat, clicking it open to reveal a treasured photograph of herself and Daisy.   
  
Arabella's expression remained stoic in the image, but Daisy's smile blazed with pure joy.   
  
Studying her sister's radiant face, Arabella felt an unfamiliar warmth soften her features.   
  
After their parents' tragic death, Arabella and Daisy had become each other's entire world. Daisy had always been their family's ray of sunshine, illuminating every room she entered.   
  
At twelve, Arabella had been handpicked by the government for a classified operation that consumed seven years of her life. Now that the mission had concluded, she could finally return to Daisy.   
  
She had forwarded nearly every government paycheck to her sister, ensuring Daisy lived in comfort and security.   
  
Joshua's eyes widened in amazement as he witnessed Arabella's smile.   
  
The legendary ice queen was actually smiling?   
  
His curiosity about Arabella's sister intensified dramatically.   
  
The car approached an upscale residential community, where each house boasted its own meticulously maintained garden.   
  
The vehicle glided to a stop in front of a house.   
  
This was the home Arabella's parents had bequeathed to them, now shared between Meagan and Daisy.   
  
The estate glowed with warm light, alive with the sound of cheerful laughter.   
  
Daisy seemed to be flourishing beautifully.   
  
With that thought in mind, Arabella preserved her gentle smile as she crossed into the front yard.   
  
A weathered doghouse sat in the corner of the property.   
  
Someone knelt beside it in the shadows.   
  
Through the dim evening light, Arabella couldn't distinguish the person's features, but she watched them scooping food directly from the bowl placed on the ground.   
  
Why would someone be eating beside the doghouse?   
  
Concern creased her brow as Arabella approached cautiously.   
  
The figure appeared startled and scrambled quickly into the doghouse.   
  
Arabella's bewilderment deepened. Then a soft, trembling voice drifted from within the shelter.  
  
""Please don't strike me again. I won't make any mistakes. I'll be so much more careful...""  
  
That voice belonged to Daisy.   
  
Arabella's heart shattered instantly. She lunged forward, pulling the figure from the doghouse. Even in the pale moonlight, she recognized her beloved sister immediately.   
  
Daisy stared back, her eyes swimming with disbelief. ""You..."" she breathed, as though she feared her mind was playing cruel tricks on her.   
  
""Daisy, is that truly you?"" Arabella's voice trembled with disbelief.   
  
When Daisy nodded weakly, a glacial fury erupted within Arabella, her eyes igniting with volcanic rage.   
  
""Bella..."" Daisy whispered, still trapped in shock. ""You've actually come back?""  
  
The moment felt impossibly surreal to Daisy, like a vision conjured from desperate longing.   
  
Arabella, sensing something terribly wrong, reached out to touch Daisy's forehead. Her skin burned with fever.   
  
Before Arabella could process this discovery, Daisy crumpled into her arms like a broken doll.   
  
Arabella cradled her sister, whose body felt heartbreakingly frail and ice-cold despite the raging fever consuming her.   
  
Arabella's heart crystallized into something harder than diamond.   
  
The front door of the house suddenly burst open with violent force.   
  
""Daisy, you worthless creature! It's been several minutes, and you're still not finished eating? Get inside immediately and wash those dishes!"" Meagan's voice sliced through the night air like a bl\*\*e.   
  
Arabella pivoted slowly, her predatory gaze locking onto her target.   
  
Meagan had transformed dramatically over the years.   
  
Once haggard and perpetually exhausted, she now radiated wealth and privilege, adorned in an expensive designer coat and gleaming jewelry that caught the porch light, presenting herself as the very embodiment of refined elegance.   
  
Meagan's bl\*\*d turned to ice under Arabella's lethal stare. ""You... Arabella? When did you arrive?""  
  
""What have you done to her?"" Arabella advanced with calculated steps, her voice dropping to a menacing whisper.   
  
Meagan instinctively retreated, unsettled by the predatory intensity burning in Arabella's eyes. But she quickly rallied her confidence, reminding herself that Arabella was still just a young woman.   
  
She twisted her lips into a cruel sneer. ""Daisy shattered a dish, so I administered appropriate punishment. You've been absent for years. Do you possess any understanding of how challenging life has been here? I never allowed her to starve or sleep without shelter. If you weren't my brother's daughters, I wouldn't have wasted my time with either of you.""  
  
In one fluid motion, Arabella's hand shot out and seized Meagan by the throat, her expression transforming into something carved from arctic stone.   
  
Meagan ga\*\*ed desperately, clawing at Arabella's iron grip. ""Let... me... go...""  
  
""This is my house,"" Arabella declared, her voice carrying the finality of a death sentence, her eyes radiating lethal intent.  
  
""You forced Daisy to perform menial labor. You made her sleep in that doghouse like an animal. You possess remarkable audacity, Meagan.""  
  
In the warm light streaming from the house, Arabella finally saw what Daisy had been consuming. It was the leftover food.   
  
Holding her sister, who felt as weightless as a dying bird and appeared ghostly pale and utterly drained, Arabella felt her heart shatter into countless pieces.   
  
Her precious sister had endured this nightmare!   
  
""Meagan,"" Arabella said, her voice saturated with deadly promise, ""when you moved into our home, you swore a sacred oath that you would care for Daisy.""  
  
Meagan bristled at Arabella's bold use of her first name, the disrespect cutting deep.   
  
But she shrank backward when she witnessed the murderous gleam dancing in Arabella's eyes.   
  
Arabella had always been fundamentally different from other children. She was cold and fearlessly bold.   
  
When Arabella had lived here, Meagan had performed the role of a dutiful aunt, though barely meeting even the lowest standards.   
  
But the moment Arabella departed, Meagan had seized absolute control, systematically crushing the gentle-spirited Daisy beneath her cruel authority.   
  
She had never imagined Arabella would return to witness her crimes.   
  
""I did take care of Daisy! She made a mistake, so I disciplined her accordingly. What's so terrible about that?""   
  
Meagan's words died in her throat as Arabella's grip tightened mercilessly, making her feel as though death itself was reaching for her soul.   
  
""Arabella?"" The violent commotion finally drew the attention of the people inside. Meagan's husband and daughter noticed the deadly confrontation unfolding at their door.   
  
Through the wide open front door, Arabella observed them living luxuriously in a spacious and magnificently decorated villa, with a table overflowing with exquisite delicacies.  
  
The people inside wore expensive clothing that spoke of comfort and abundance.   
  
Meanwhile, Daisy had been sleeping in a doghouse, consuming leftovers. Arabella's eyes burned with unshed tears as the devastating truth crashed over her with overwhelming force.   
  
  
Chapter 2 Can You Check Who Made The Payment  
Khloe Tucker was fuming.   
  
""Let go of my mom, Arabella! Back then, she offered to take care of you and Daisy out of kindness. Is that how you repay her? You show up after disappearing for years, acting like you're some kind of hero? What, did you run off, get pr\*\*nant, and have a kid or something? What a joke!""

Khloe threw Arabella a nasty glare, but deep down, she actually hoped Arabella might stay. Having her back would mean more help around the house.   
  
But Arabella's eyes had already gone cold. Without saying a word, she entered the house and kicked the dining table hard.   
  
Dishes flew everywhere, crashing onto the floor and shattering into pieces.   
  
Before anyone could react, Arabella grabbed two vases and hurled them straight at Khloe and her father.   
  
They hit them squarely, and bl\*\*d started trickling down their faces as they screamed in shock.   
  
Her voice was ice. ""You've got one day. Get out of my house."" Without waiting for a reply, she stormed out with Daisy in her arms.   
  
She flagged down the first taxi she saw and rushed her sister straight to a hospital.   
  
Back at the villa, chaos broke out.   
  
""Mom! That psycho actually attacked me!"" Khloe sobbed, staring at the scratches on her face in the mirror. ""What if I'm left with scars?""  
  
Meagan's fury boiled over. ""She's gotten way too bold after all these years! If she shows her face again, she won't be so lucky. We're not nobodies anymore. We've joined hands with Norman Group. There's no way she can stand against us!""  
  
She gave Khloe a comforting pat. ""Don't worry, honey. I'm taking you to a hospital right now.""  
  
\*\*\*  
  
At the hospital, the doctor examined Daisy and frowned. ""Her leg's been broken for a while, and she's covered in bruises. Some of her teeth are missing too. What kind of sister lets this happen?""  
  
Arabella's voice was low. ""It's my fault.""  
  
Her bangs fell over her eyes, hiding whatever she was feeling inside.   
  
The doctor, noticing how quiet she was, spoke gently. ""I've done what I could for now. But if someone's been hurting you two, you need to report it. Keeping quiet won't fix anything.""  
  
Arabella gave a small nod and moved to stand beside Daisy's hospital bed.   
  
Daisy, now nineteen, looked heartbreakingly fragile. Her thin frame looked like it couldn't support itself, and her wrists seemed more like twigs than limbs.   
  
Her short hair was uneven, dry, and choppy, like someone had taken scissors to it without a second thought.   
  
Arabella gently lifted the blanket, and her heart dropped.   
  
Daisy's skin told a horrifying story. Old whip marks crisscrossed her legs, and dark burn spots marred her arms.  
  
Each scar screamed of cruelty. Arabella's breath caught, and before she could stop them, tears rolled down her cheeks.   
  
""Bella..."" Daisy's voice was barely a whisper.   
  
Arabella immediately reached for her hand. ""I'm here,"" she said softly.   
  
""I... missed you,"" Daisy murmured, her voice hoarse.   
  
Arabella clutched her hand like a lifeline. ""I missed you too. I thought if I worked hard, I could give you a better life. But I was wrong. I never should've left you alone. I swear, I'm not going anywhere again.""  
  
The warmth in Arabella's voice seemed to melt Daisy's tension. Slowly, her expression softened.   
  
After making sure Daisy was settled, Arabella went to sort out the payment.   
  
""The charges have already been covered,"" the nurse said with a kind smile.   
  
Arabella blinked. ""What? Who paid?""  
  
Joshua crossed her mind, but she quickly dismissed the thought. There was no way he knew about this yet.   
  
""Can you check who made the payment?"" she asked.   
  
The nurse gave an apologetic shake of the head. ""Sorry, that information's private. Maybe a family member helped out?""  
  
At the word family, Arabella's face turned to stone. She gave a short nod and walked off without another word. If someone had helped, she was going to find out who.   
  
Meanwhile, down the corridor, Meagan strolled beside her daughter, Khloe, who was fresh out of the emergency room with her face patched up.   
  
""I'm not letting Arabella walk away from this,"" Khloe snarled, bitterness burning in her voice.   
  
""Calm down,"" Meagan said sharply. ""You'll reopen your stitches if you keep flaring up like this. Be more like your sister--grace under pressure.""  
  
That seemed to cheer Khloe up. A smug smile tugged at her lips.  
  
""As long as my sister keeps shining, that's all that matters. She's the youngest dancer in the Griridge Troupe now. Daisy really thought she could outshine her? She was delusional. That broken leg was karma, if you ask me. And if my sister finds out how Arabella treated me--oh, she'll tear her apart.""  
  
""She's got a big show coming up,"" Meagan reminded her. ""Let's not distract her. One step at a time.""  
  
She tapped Khloe's nose lightly, but then her expression stiffened as she spotted Arabella ahead.   
  
Khloe saw Arabella too, and just the sight of her brought back the sting of humiliation. Her rage boiled over.   
  
Without thinking, she grabbed her studded handbag and swung it with all her strength toward Arabella's back.   
  
Arabella's instincts kicked in. Just as she turned around, a tall man came into view. With quick reflexes and strong arms, he grabbed the bag mid-air by its strap, stopping it like it was nothing.   
  
The sudden pull made Khloe lose her balance, and with a startled scream, she fell to the floor.   
  
  
Chapter 3 Grab Your Things And Come With Me  
""Khloe!"" Meagan hurried to her daughter's side, helping her up while shooting a vicious glare at the man who had shown up out of nowhere.   
  
""Who the h\*\*l are you? Arabella's new guy or what?""  
  
The man didn't bother responding. His sharp eyes gave nothing away, cold and unreadable, like the still, deep sea that hid its danger.   
  
Then he began walking toward Meagan, each step loud and heavy on the hospital floor.   
  
Meagan instinctively took a step back. Her ch\*\*t tightened, making it hard to breathe.   
  
Deep down, something told her this man wasn't just any stranger--he was trouble.   
  
Trying to mask her unease, she snapped, ""Arabella, you'd better think twice before crossing us again. You and your sister were lucky we let you stay at all! If you ever want back in, come crawling, and maybe we'll consider it.""  
  
Yanking Khloe's arm, Meagan stormed off.   
  
Arabella stood silently, watching them go. Let them stay? That house was legally Daisy's and hers.   
  
She glanced at the man and caught sight of a pi\*\*ol, just for a second, before it disappeared beneath his jacket. Her eyes narrowed slightly.   
  
Who was this guy?   
  
He turned and looked directly at her. Arabella finally saw his face--handsome as h\*\*l, rough around the edges, and those icy eyes didn't blink or soften for anyone.   
  
He gave off a vibe that screamed danger--Arabella had never felt anything like it.   
  
No surprise Meagan bolted--anyone with sense would have.   
  
""Arabella Stanley,"" he said. His tone was calm and low, but there was a chill in it that made her skin prickle.   
  
Arabella glanced him over. ""You're the one who paid for my sister, right?""  
  
He gave a faint nod. ""You're quick. Grab your things and come with me.""  
  
Arabella's brows drew together. ""Excuse me?""  
  
Who even was this guy, showing up with mystery and attitude?   
  
Before things got tenser, another man stepped in--less intimidating but equally serious.  
  
""Miss Stanley, allow me to explain. This is Mr. Asher Gordon. His father and your dad served together in the military. Before his father passed away, he asked Mr. Gordon to watch over your family. Mr. Gordon only recently returned from service and has been trying to track you down since.""  
  
That explained the military presence, the icy calm... the way he moved like someone trained for war.   
  
Arabella studied Asher again. He didn't seem threatening now, but just closed off, like someone with a wall too thick to climb over.   
  
She stayed calm. ""You got anything to back that up? Anyone can say that.""  
  
Asher reached into his pocket and pulled out a weathered photo.   
  
It showed two men in dusty uniforms--one was definitely her father. The other looked a lot like him.   
  
She stared at it for a long moment before replying, ""I'll think about it.""  
  
""Fair. Let's exchange numbers,"" Asher replied without any small talk.   
  
Arabella added his contact. His WhatsApp display was just a solid black box.   
  
Funny enough, hers was the same.   
  
A strange little coincidence, she thought.   
  
Then the assistant added her as well. ""Dominick Powell, Mr. Gordon's right hand. Reach out if you need help with anything, anytime.""  
  
Arabella gave a nod. ""Got it.""  
  
With that, the two men walked off, and Arabella made her way back to Daisy's room.   
  
Shortly after, two silent, suited bodyguards appeared at the door--they were clearly sent by Asher.   
  
Arabella didn't ask questions. She got to work helping Daisy clean up--changing her into fresh clothes and gently washing her hair, trying to fix its brittle, uneven mess.   
  
But when she saw the scars and ci\*\*rette burns covering Daisy's body, her eyes welled up again.   
  
Holding back her tears, she carefully rubbed her homemade cream onto the wounds. Then, without wasting a second, she opened her laptop.   
  
She had to find out what had happened to Daisy while she was gone, so she hacked into the villa's security system.   
  
Sadly, what she saw made her sick to her stomach.   
  
It wasn't long after Arabella left that Daisy was thrown out of her own bedroom and made to sleep in a doghouse.   
  
The cheerful, lively sister Arabella remembered didn't smile anymore.   
  
She saw footage of Daisy juggling multiple part-time jobs, only to get ha\*\*ssed and pushed around.   
  
Even so, she kept working hard and made it into one of the top universities. But during her very first semester, she ended up with a broken leg.   
  
She was studying dance, and just like that, the injury shattered everything she had dreamed of.   
  
The pieces fell into place too easily. Khloe's sister, Elissa Tucker, was in the same class. Arabella's gut told her that leg injury hadn't been some fluke.   
  
After that, Daisy barely left the house. She was treated like hired help, scrubbing floors, cooking meals, and still sleeping out in that d\*\*n doghouse.   
  
Yet every time Daisy texted her, it was the same lie. ""I'm doing fine. Don't worry about me. You just take care of yourself.""  
  
Arabella's vision blurred.   
  
While her sister was being broken piece by piece, their aunt's family was thriving. Their business had taken off, thanks to a lucrative deal with the Vanguard Group.   
  
Khloe, a middle school dropout, was suddenly a digital influencer. Elissa was famous and popular in the college.   
  
Meagan was rubbing shoulders with high-society ladies, and her husband had become some corporate hotshot.   
  
Arabella clenched her jaw and slammed her fist against the table. She didn't even feel the sting.   
  
Every bit of success she had worked for... had only served to feed that vile family's greed.   
  
And the one person she had sworn to protect had suffered in silence the entire time.   
  
  
Chapter 4 This Revenge Is Mine To Carry Out  
Arabella took a slow breath, wiped the tears from her cheeks, and her eyes turned cold, like a fire had been snuffed out and replaced with ice.  
  
Her fingers gripped her phone tightly as she made a call. ""That major project--it hasn't been handed over to the Tucker Group yet, right? Cancel it. Completely."" Her voice was calm but firm.  
  
""And get to the Griridge Hospital. Now.""  
  
On the other end, Joshua sounded startled. ""Arabella? What's going on?""  
  
""You'll see when you get here. Bring a few things with you.""  
  
True to form, Joshua didn't waste time. Less than half an hour later, he rushed into the hospital, and the moment his eyes landed on the girl in the hospital bed, he froze like a statue.  
  
She looked so much like Arabella--same face, but all color drained, bruised, battered, her body wrecked like it had been thrown away and forgotten.   
  
Joshua's fists clenched. ""Who did this? Tell me who it was. I'll make them pay, I swear it!""  
  
That was the sister of a preeminent figure... and they treated her like this?   
  
Arabella didn't flinch. ""I'll handle it myself. Slowly,"" she muttered, picking up a pair of sc\*\*sors from the table.   
  
Before Joshua could react, the sc\*\*sors had already cut through her long, silky hair. The strands dropped to the floor in silence.   
  
He stared, stunned. ""Arabella... you're not actually...""  
  
""I am,"" she said. ""This revenge is mine to carry out.""  
  
Joshua swallowed hard, goosebumps rising on his arms.   
  
The way she said it--it was clear. H\*\*l was coming for someone.   
  
Arabella glanced at him. ""Also, what do you know about the Gordons?""  
  
""The Gordon family?"" He immediately straightened.   
  
""They're legendary. Way beyond the top elite families. Super wealthy, but incredibly discreet. I've only ever worked with the right-hand man of their current CEO.""  
  
""You mean Dominick Powell?"" Arabella asked casually.   
  
Joshua's jaw dropped. ""Wait, you know Dominick? Don't tell me... are you saying the Gordons were involved in what happened to Daisy?""  
  
Arabella gave him a blank stare before calmly explaining Asher's connection and what he had said earlier. Joshua slapped his thigh, clearly overwhelmed.   
  
""Asher Gordon? If it's really him, then yeah, no one's faking that. He leads the family. Rumor has it he's ex-special forces, quiet as a ghost, but deadly. If someone crosses him, they don't get a second chance.""  
  
Arabella didn't react. She just stared at the floor, her thoughts turning in circles.   
  
Then she spoke, steady and cold. ""You should head out now. Also... sell my villa.""  
  
Joshua hesitated. ""That place... that's your parents' home. Are you sure?""  
  
Arabella looked over at Daisy's fragile frame. ""She was tortured in that house. There's no comfort left there. Just get rid of it.""  
  
Her voice cracked slightly. ""And if possible, find a buyer who's impossible to deal with.""  
  
Joshua gave her a long look, then nodded. ""Understood. I've got a bunch of properties lined up. If you ever need a place, it's yours.""  
  
""Thanks.""  
  
She didn't look up, and Joshua, sensing she needed space, quietly slipped out the door.   
  
Left alone, Arabella gently held Daisy's hand and murmured, ""I swear, everyone who hurt you... I'll make them pay for it tenfold.""  
  
That night felt endless, and sleep didn't come.   
  
The next morning, Arabella stood quietly outside a dance studio at Griridge University's dance department, listening through the open door.   
  
""Elissa, things have been so dull without that pathetic girl around,"" someone inside snickered.   
  
""I know, right? No one to fetch us coffee, no one to mess with. It's no fun without a punching bag,"" another chimed in.   
  
Peering through the glass window, Arabella spotted Elissa in the middle of the dance studio.   
  
Years ago, Elissa had been just a pale, skinny kid. Now she was dressed in a flowing white dance outfit, all elegance and grace, like something out of a dream.   
  
Surrounded by classmates, Elissa flashed a gentle, modest smile at the comments. ""Guys, don't say that. Let's not be mean.""  
  
""You're too kind, Elissa,"" Joyce Lambert, her good friend, scoffed. ""That girl sponged off your family for years. If it were me, I'd have thrown her out of your house on day one.""  
  
Arabella narrowed her eyes slightly.   
  
Calling it their house? Seriously?   
  
That place belonged to her and Daisy. Elissa and her family were the ones living off of them.   
  
Elissa tilted her head, her voice syrupy sweet. ""She's my cousin, after all. Her parents passed away. If we didn't take her in, she would've had nowhere to go.""  
  
Her fake compassion earned gasps of admiration from the crowd.   
  
What a generous soul, they all seemed to think.   
  
The loud chatter in the dance studio instantly stopped the moment Arabella walked in.   
  
""Daisy?"" Joyce blinked in surprise.   
  
She stared at Arabella, stunned. She looked the same, but... something about her felt different now.   
  
  
Chapter 5 Got Yourself A Su\*\*r Daddy  
The dance studio fell silent, as if someone had hit pause.   
  
Every single eye was locked on Arabella, but she acted like she didn't see a thing and confidently made her way to the back, where she began stretching like it was just another day.   
  
Joyce's jaw clenched. ""Daisy, you've got some nerve showing up out of nowhere like this!"" Joyce barked, marching over and swinging a sharp kick at her.  
  
""Just because we've gone easy on you doesn't mean you're not taking orders from us!""  
  
But Arabella moved with ease, dodging the kick without breaking a sweat. Joyce lost her balance and hit the floor face-first with a loud, painful thud.   
  
""You dodged me?"" Joyce screeched in disbelief. Her face turned red with fury as she raised her hand to s\*\*p Arabella.   
  
But just like before, Arabella slipped out of reach like a shadow. Joyce's swing caught nothing but air, and she stumbled forward, grabbing her lower back with a wince. ""D\*\*n it!""  
  
""My bad,"" Arabella said gently, her voice almost too soft to catch.   
  
Joyce wanted to explode, but something about Arabella's calmness made her hesitate.   
  
She didn't dare swing again. Instead, she snapped, ""What are you just standing there for? Get over here and help us stretch already!""  
  
""So, Daisy's really back,"" she thought smugly. ""Still the same pathetic errand girl.""  
  
Arabella's gaze briefly darkened, but she gave a polite nod like an obedient student.   
  
She knelt beside Joyce and began helping her with leg stretches. Joyce smirked. ""You look even sadder than before. Honestly, it's pathetic.""  
  
But then, a painful scream cut through the air.   
  
Joyce's leg jolted, and she broke into a cold sweat, grabbing her thigh. ""My leg... what the h\*\*l? Did you snap my leg?""  
  
The class crowded around her in a frenzy.   
  
""Is she alright? Someone call for help!""  
  
""Look, the teacher just walked in!""  
  
Their panic was cut short as the teacher entered the room.   
  
Arabella still had Joyce's leg in her hands. Calmly, almost casually, she gave it a subtle twist.   
  
""Ah!"" Joyce screamed even louder, nearly in tears from the pain.   
  
""What's going on in here?"" The teacher frowned, scanning the chaos.   
  
""My leg! It feels broken... I can't--"" Joyce wailed, then blinked in confusion. Just seconds later, she could move it again. ""Wait... what?""  
  
""You look fine to me."" The teacher shot a look at Joyce--one that wasn't exactly sympathetic. She had seen enough of these girls' antics over the years.  
  
""I don't care what drama you're cooking up on your own time, but today's important. The Griridge Troupe selection is happening. The dean and senior faculty will be here shortly, so I expect everyone to act like professionals.""  
  
""I swear, I..."" Joyce began, trying to protest.   
  
""That's enough."" Elissa cut her off, stepping forward with an easy smile. ""Let's not waste more time. Joyce, calm down.""  
  
Elissa's tone made it clear--this wasn't the time to pick fights.   
  
Joyce had no choice but to bite her tongue and swallow her anger, though her glare at Arabella could have burned through steel.   
  
The teacher clapped her hands, and class began.   
  
During the last twenty minutes, a few other teachers showed up to observe.   
  
By the time class ended, the room was filled with a mix of nervous energy and excited chatter.   
  
""God, I really hope I get picked. Dancing alongside Elissa would be a dream come true.""  
  
""Elissa, don't forget us when you're famous!"" someone teased.   
  
Elissa gave her signature angelic smile. ""Of course not. You're all my people.""  
  
Then someone dropped a name that made the entire class go silent. ""They say Isabella might be watching today.""  
  
Gasps rippled through the room.   
  
Even Elissa blinked in shock, her breath catching. Isabella Wallace was the icon of modern dance.   
  
Her performances were legendary, her choreography unrivaled. Just being seen by her could open doors.   
  
""If Isabella notices me, that's it. That's my breakthrough,"" Elissa thought, her gaze sharpening with quiet ambition.  
  
But then someone spoke up, disrupting the mood. ""I saw Daisy dancing earlier. Honestly, she wasn't bad at all.""  
  
Joyce scoffed loud enough for the room to hear. ""Daisy? Please. She's pathetic. No way she'd get picked.""  
  
Turning her attention to Daisy, she said, ""Hey, what are you still doing here, anyway? Go get our lunch. You remember our order, right?""  
  
Without a word, Arabella nodded and walked off, her tall frame moving with a silent elegance despite the slump in her shoulders.   
  
""Ugh. Even the way she walks is irritating. Does she actually think she's all graceful or something? What a complete eyesore!"" Joyce sneered.   
  
By the time Joyce, Elissa, and the rest of their group showed up at the cafeteria, laughing and cracking jokes, Arabella already had their meals prepared.  
  
Her eyes quietly scanned each of them--calm, blank, giving nothing away. But in her mind, she was taking note of everything.   
  
Joyce, whose father ran the Lambert Group, was spoiled beyond belief and filthy rich.   
  
Next to her was Kenzie Marsh--the meek, glasses-wearing music student who practically worshipped the ground Elissa walked on.   
  
And behind them, the two guys were followers, plain and simple. They were all muscle without a mind.   
  
Joyce looked at the food Arabella had bought and narrowed her eyes. ""Well, well. Where'd you get the cash, huh? Got yourself a su\*\*r daddy? I thought you were broke, freeloader.""  
  
Joyce kept running her mouth but still dove into the food--everyone was starving after dancing all morning.   
  
However, midway through eating, something went terribly wrong. Joyce coughed violently, bl\*\*d trickling from her lips as she clutched her throat, her eyes wide in panic.   
  
The others followed suit, gasping, hands around their necks, as if something sharp was tearing through their throats.   
  
""It burns--what's happening?"" they wh\*\*zed, struggling to speak as pain ripped through them.   
  
Elissa stared at her in disbelief, still holding her throat. ""Daisy... what did you do?""  
  
""That little bi\*\*h's getting revenge!"" Joyce screamed, losing it completely. ""You think Elissa letting you tag along means we'll go easy on you? You're dead!""  
  
Furious, she flung her food tray at Arabella, while the two boys beside her instinctively lunged forward, ready to grab her without hesitation.

by [https://www.gptsportswriter.com](https://www.gptsportswriter.com) **Sofia Kenin vs. Varvara Gracheva: A Tale of Power vs. Precision (With a Side of Humor)**

**Parsing the Odds: Who’s the Favorite?**  
Let’s crunch the numbers. Sofia Kenin is the consensus favorite across all bookmakers, with decimal odds hovering around **1.60** (implying a \~62% chance to win). Varvara Gracheva, meanwhile, sits at **2.35-2.40**, translating to \~41-43% implied probability. The spread lines back this up: Kenin is a **-2.5 set favorite**, meaning bookmakers expect her to win comfortably in two sets. The total games line is set at **21.5**, with even money on Over/Under—suggesting a middle-of-the-road, competitive but not grueling match.

Statistically, this is a mismatch. Kenin, a former US Open champion, boasts a **power game** that can dominate baseline rallies and a serve that’s as reliable as a coffee machine in a Zoom meeting. Gracheva, while a tenacious defender with a knack for counterpunching, lacks the explosive upside to trouble Kenin on her best day. The article’s own words—“Sofia Kenin has higher upside on a good day”—are as clear a script as a GPS in a parking lot.

**Digesting the News: Injuries, Form, and Quirks**  
No major injuries or scandals here, but let’s lean into the quirks. Gracheva’s game is like a well-stocked toolbox: reliable, adaptable, but not exactly flashy. She’s the tennis equivalent of a Swiss Army knife—useful, but if you’re hoping for a fireworks show, you’re in the wrong ZIP code. Kenin, on the other hand, is a nuclear option when dialed in. Her serve-and-volley tendencies and ability to end points quickly make her a nightmare for players who rely on long rallies.

A fun tidbit: Gracheva’s “low-margin attacks” (as mentioned in the article about Anastasija Sevastova’s match) could apply here. If she’s not precise with her returns or placement, Kenin will pounce like a cat on a laser dot. Conversely

I’ve been into espresso, then back to filter coffee (drip), then percolator and Turkish coffee. Mostly I have filter coffee, but I do enjoy good coffee machines having the “coffee” option.

I do like an occasional cappuccino, but I mostly drink black tall cups. I’m not into cold brews or ice lattes.

I’m after simplicity, being able to get a coffee from whole beans with the press of a button. If I get with milk that should be pretty automatic as well. A bonus if I can dispense hot water for tea. Also if the machine isn’t super huge. Maintenance should not be way too much work as well.

Also I tend to drink caffeinated in the morning and decaf in the afternoon - will this be a hassle changing beans for just a few cups?

I live in Sweden and I see quite a few delonghi, Philips and Siemens as second hand options. As I’m not into hard core ristrettos or espressos but taller coffees what should I aim for?

Budget maximum $450 but sometimes I can find used ones for really good prices

I found a delonghi dinamica plus and a Philips 4300 quite cheap while looking today. Are any of those good for me?

Ladies and gentlemen, gather ‘round for a clash of tennis titans so low on the rankings ladder it’s practically a basement brawl: **McCartney Kessler (No. 32)** vs. **Caty McNally (No. 104)**. Both players enter the Western & Southern Open Round of 64 with *-110* odds, which in betting terms means “we have no idea who’ll win, so just throw your money at the nearest pigeon and let it decide.” But let’s dig deeper, shall we?

---

### Parsing the Odds: The Math of Mediocrity

The odds here are a masterclass in ambiguity. While the article claims both players are evenly favored (-110), the decimal and American odds tell a slightly more chaotic story. For example:

* **Bovada** lists McNally at **2.10** (implied 47.6% chance) and Kessler at **1.77** (56.5%).
* **DraftKings** narrows the gap slightly (McNally: 2.05, Kessler: 1.77).
* **BetRivers** goes full “psychological warfare,” offering a spread of **-1.5 sets** for Kessler and **+1.5** for McNally, as if saying, “Neither of these players owns a serve, so bet on the bathroom break.”

The takeaway? McNally is *slightly* more likely to win according to the decimal markets, but the -110 line suggests bookmakers want to balance the action like a tightrope walker on a trampoline.

### Digesting the News: Injuries, Form, and Metaphors

The article’s lone “news” is that this matchup was assembled by “human expertise, machine learning, and pre-built content libraries.” In other words, it’s a collision of algorithms and coffee-stained spreadsheets. But fear not! We have *predictions* to work with:

* McNally is praised for her **“recent form”** and ability to **“mix up pace,”** which sounds suspiciously like a magician who also plays the cello.
* Kessler? Well, she’s ranked 32nd, which is 72 spots higher than McNally but probably owns a spare tire for “climbing the rankings.”

No injuries are mentioned, so we’ll assume both players are

It was with the knowledge that she is not monogamous and is seeing other guys. It was in pursuit of a fwb type situation which I have had success with in the past and was ok with at the time. 

We met and hit it off and had a great intro conversation at a coffee shop that ran long in a good way. 

She got covid, recovered quickly, and wanted to meet for sexy times. It was not a coincidence I asked her over on my birthday and good times were had. Tremendous sexual compatibility and she spent the night. 

That was 3 months ago and we have grown much closer. Most of the time we spend together is having fun platonically and having meaningful, intimate, and intellectual conversations. We cuddle for hours and hold hands. It feels like promising dating. I have no idea if she is like this with everyone or if I am special. I feel special but am afraid to ask. What muddies the water further is her sexual expression and identity are centered around physical touch and skin to skin contact. Much less about penetration or orgasm. 

Here's the big ole but...she has been seeing 2-3 other guys in this time. She has a deeeep well of social energy I do not. She has also had a few hook ups and is growing quickly in her kink community engagement. Parties, sometimes purely social or educational, sometimes to play, always to meet potential new partners. I imagine there is a constant need to replenish partners as they drop off if you are looking to maintain that 3+ ""regulars"". She is proud of having a ""harem"" of ""boy toys"". She was married 10 years and has been in this lifestyle 1-2. She is totally open about all of this. 

As mentioned, I am an idiot. I should not have taken the risk of falling for her. Either kept is purely transactional or more wisely not have sought a fwb situation is the first place. Safety has become a huge concern. This is not sustainable. So here I am. 

The obvious next step is clarifying her feelings towards to me. There is a good chance that I am indeed special. Terrifying...

Is it even remotely fair to ask about being exclusive? Is 3 months too soon? Should I consider compromises that do not include other sexual partners?   ",1,1754850317.0,whatdoIdo,5,1.0,False

by [https://www.gptsportswriter.com](https://www.gptsportswriter.com) **Karen Khachanov vs. Valentin Royer: A Tale of Two Trajectories**  
The ATP Cincinnati Open’s quick courts are about to witness a clash of contrasting trajectories: Karen Khachanov, the seasoned machine with a 4-1 win streak and a Toronto final under his belt, versus Valentin Royer, the 104th-ranked underdog who’s yet to find his Challenger Tour groove. Let’s break this down with the precision of a line judge and the humor of a tennis ball bouncing off a clown’s nose.

---

### Parsing the Odds: Numbers Don’t Lie (Mostly)

Khachanov is a near-80% favorite on the moneyline (decimal odds \~1.24), while Royer sits at 22-24% implied probability (+4.0 to +4.25). The spread? Khachanov’s expected to win by 3.5-4 games, per bookmakers. These numbers scream “safe bet,” but let’s not let the math dull the drama.

Royer’s +240 odds (American) mean a $100 bet returns $240 if he pulls off the shocker. That’s the price of hope—like betting your morning coffee that your team will finally “turn it around” in the 4th quarter.

---

### Recent Form: Khachanov’s Consistency vs. Royer’s… Hmm

Khachanov’s recent form is smoother than a freshly pressed Wimbledon sweater. He’s won four of five matches, including a Masters 1000 final in Toronto. The Russian is a grinder’s grinder, blending power and precision. His game? A Swiss Army knife on a mission.

Royer, meanwhile, has three wins in five matches but lacks the consistency of a player ready to crack the ATP elite. His Challenger Tour résumé reads like a “Still Looking for the Bus” memo. Imagine Royer as a promising chef who keeps over-salting his risotto—talented, but not yet refined.

At work we use FastAPI and Next.js, and I often need to turn Pydantic models into TypeScript for the frontend. Doing it by hand every time was boring, slow, and easy to mess up so I built a small app to do it for me.

* Paste your Pydantic models/enums, get clean TypeScript interfaces/types instantly.
* Runs 100% in your browser (no server, no data saved)
* One-click copy or download a .ts file

It’s saved me a bunch of time and keeps backend and frontend in sync. If you do the same stack or use typescript, you might find it handy too.

  There were advantages to being a dead man.  
  
  Merik Nihar, prince of Nubrevna and former admiral to the Nubrevnan navy, wished he’d considered dying a long time ago. He got so much more done as a corpse.  
  
  Such as right now. He’d come to Judgment Square at the heart of Lovats for a reason, and that reason was tucked inside a low hut, an extension of the prison behind it, where records were kept. There was one prisoner in particular Merik needed information on. A prisoner with no left pinkie, who now resided beyond the final shelf, deep in Noden’s watery Hell.  
  
  Merik sank into the hood of his tan cloak. True, his face was scarcely recognizable thanks to the burns, and his hair was only just beginning to grow back, but the covering offered safety in the madness of Judgment Square.  
  
  Or Goshorn Square, as it was sometimes called, thanks to the enormous goshorn oak at the center.  
  
  The pale trunk, as wide as a lighthouse and easily as tall, was dented to high hell-waters, and its branches hadn’t seen green in decades. That tree, Merik thought, as he eyed the longest branch, looks like it might soon join me in death.  
  
  All day long, tides of traffic poured through the square, driven by curiosity. Who would be forced into public shame? Shackled to the stones without food or reprieve? Who would feel the burning snap of a rope—followed by the cold kiss of Noden’s Hagfishes?  
  
  Desperation brought people in droves. Families came to beg the Nubrevnan soldiers for mercy on their loved ones, and the homeless came to beg for food, for shelter, for pity of any kind.  
  
  But no one had pity or mercy to spare these days. Not even Merik Nihar.  
  
  He’d already done all he could—given up all he could for a trade agreement with the Hasstrel estate in Cartorra. He’d almost negotiated one with the Marstoks as well, but ultimately death had come too soon.  
  
  A family blocked Merik’s way now. A woman and her two boys, each of them shouting at anyone who passed by.  
  
  “No crime in being hungry!” they hollered in unison. “Free us and feed us! Free us and feed us!” The older boy, wildly tall and skinny as a brittlestar, rounded on Merik.  
  
  “No crime in being hungry!” He heaved in close. “Free us and feed—”  
  
  Merik sidestepped the boy before twirling left around his brother and finally shooting past the mother. She was the loudest of the three, with her sun-bleached hair and a face lined with fury.  
  
  Merik knew that feeling well, for it was fury that fueled him ever onward. Even as pain cut through his body and blisterings on his chest were scraped open by homespun.  
  
  Others in the area picked up the chant. Free us and feed us! No crime in being hungry! Merik found his steps settling into a quick clip to match the rhythm of that cry. So few people in the Witchlands had magic, much less magic of any real use. They survived by the whim of nature—or the whim of witches—and their own unrelenting grit.  
  
  Merik reached the gallows at the oak’s fat trunk. Six ropes dangled from a middle branch, limp coils in the midmorning heat. Yet as Merik tried to skirt the empty stage, he caught sight of a tall figure, pale-headed and hulkingly framed.  
  
  Kullen. The name grazed across Merik’s heart, sucking the air from his lungs before his brain could catch up and say, No, not Kullen. Never Kullen.  
  
  For Kullen had cleaved in Lejna two weeks ago.  
He had died in Lejna two weeks ago. He would never be coming back.  
  
  Without thinking, Merik’s fists shot out. He punched the gallows stage, pain bursting in his knuckles—at once grounding. At once real.  
  
  Again he punched. Harder this time, wondering why his insides spun. He had paid his dues to Kullen’s ghost. He had bought that shrine on the hillside, using the one remaining gold button from his admiral’s coat, and he’d prayed for the Hagfishes to give Kullen quick passage beyond the final shelf.  
  
  After that, it was supposed to stop hurting. This was supposed to stop hurting.  
  
  Eventually, the tall figure was gone and Merik’s bleeding knuckles stung more brightly than the past. Merik forced himself onward, elbows out and hood low. For if Safiya fon Hasstrel could reach that pier in Lejna despite Marstoks and Cleaved in her way—if she could do all that for a nation that wasn’t even her own, for a trade agreement with her family—then Merik could certainly finish what he’d come here to do.  
  
  Curse his mind for going to her, though. Merik had done so well at avoiding memories of Safi since the explosion. Since his old world had ended and this new one had begun. Not because he didn’t want to think about her. Noden save him, but that last moment he’d shared with her …  
  
  No, no—Merik would not dwell. There was no point in remembering the taste of Safi’s skin against his lips, not when his lips were now broken. Not when his entire body was ruined and wretched to behold.  
  
  Besides, dead men weren’t supposed to care.  
  
  On he charged through filth and body odor. A tide that fought back. A storm with no eye. Each smack of limbs against Merik’s shoulders or hands sent pain scuttling through him.  
  
  He reached the irons. Fifty prisoners waited here, shackled to the stones and crispy from the sun. A fence surrounded them, indifferent to the people pressing in from the outside.  
  
  They begged the guards to give their sons water. Their wives shade. Their fathers release. Yet the two soldiers who waited at the fence’s gate—inside, to keep from being trampled—showed no more interest in the hungry of Lovats than they did the prisoners they were meant to guard.  
  
  In fact, so bored were these two soldiers that they played taro to while away the time. One wore an iris-blue strip of cloth at his biceps, a mourning band to show respect for his dead prince. The other kept the band draped across a knee.  
  
  At the sight of that cloth—just lying there, unused—a fresh, furious wind ignited in Merik’s chest. He had given so much for Nubrevna, and this was all it had earned him: a hollow, false grief. Outward shows, like the wreaths and streamers draped across the city, that couldn’t truly mask how little anyone cared their prince was dead.  
  
  Vivia had seen to that.  
  
  Thank Noden, Merik soon arrived at the hut, for he could keep his winds and temper contained for only so long—and the fuse was almost burned up.  
  
  The crowds spat him out before orange walls streaked in bird shit, and Merik cut toward a door on the south side. Always locked, but not impenetrable.  
  
  “Open up!” Merik bellowed. He knocked once at the door—a mistake. The newly splintered skin on his knuckles sloughed off. “I know you’re in there!”  
  
  No response. At least none that Merik could hear, but that was all right. He let the heat in his body grow. Strengthen. Gust.  
  
  Then he knocked again, feeling the wind curl around him as he did so. “Hurry! It’s madness out here!”  
  
  The latch jiggled. The door creaked back … And Merik shoved in. With fists, with force, with wind.  
  
  The soldier on the other side stood no chance. He toppled back, the whole hut shuddering from the force of his fall. Before he could rise, Merik had the door closed behind him. He advanced on the man, his winds chasing. Tearing up papers in a cyclone that felt so blighted good.  
  
  It had been too long since Merik had let his winds unfurl and his magic stretch wide. Fire built in his belly, a rage that blustered and blew. That had kept his stomach full when food had not. Air billowed around him, sweeping in and out in time to his breaths.  
  
  The soldier—middle-aged, sallow-skinned—stayed on the ground with his hands to protect his face. Clearly, he’d decided surrender was his safest option.  
  
  Too bad. Merik would’ve loved a fight. Instead, he forced his eyes to scour the room. He used his winds too, coaxing them outward. Letting the vibrations on the air tell him where other bodies might wait. Where other breaths might curl. Yet no one hid in the dark corners, and the door into the main prison remained firmly shut.  
  
  So at last, with careful control, Merik returned his attention to the soldier. His magic softened, dropping papers to the floor before he eased off his hood, fighting the pain that skittered down his scalp.  
  
  Then Merik waited, to see if the soldier would recognize him.  
  
  Nothing. In fact, the instant the man lowered his hands, he shrank back. “What are you?”  
  
  “Angry.” Merik advanced a single step. “I seek someone recently released from a second time in the irons.”  
  
  The man shot a scattered glance around the room. “I’ll need more information. Sir. An age or crime or release date—”  
  
  “I don’t have that.” Merik claimed another step forward, and this time the soldier frantically scrambled upright. Away from Merik and grabbing for the nearest papers.  
  
  “I met this prisoner”—I killed this prisoner—“eleven days ago.” Merik paused, thinking back to the moonbeam. “He was brown-skinned with long black hair, and he had two stripes tattooed beneath his left eye.”  
  
  Two stripes. Two times in the Judgment Square irons.  
  
  “And…” Merik lifted his left hand. The skin bore shades of healing red and brown, except where new blood cracked along his knuckles. “The prisoner had no pinkie.”  
  
  “Garren Leeri!” the soldier cried, nodding. “I remember him, all right. He was part of the Nines, back before we cracked down on the Skulks’ gangs. Though the second time we arrested him, it was for petty theft.”  
  
  “Indeed. And what exactly happened to Garren after his time was served?”  
  
  “He was sold, sir.”  
  
  Merik’s nostrils flared. Sold was not something he’d known could happen to prisoners, and with that thought, disgusted heat awoke in his lungs. Merik didn’t fight it—he simply let it kick out to rattle the papers near his feet.  
  
  One such paper flipped up, slapping against the soldier’s shin. In an instant, the man was trembling again. “It doesn’t happen often. Sir. Selling people, I mean. Just when we’ve no room in the prison—and we only sell people convicted for petty crimes. They work off their time instead.”  
  
  “And to whom”—Merik dipped his head sideways—“did you sell this man named Garren?”  
  
  “To Pin’s Keep, sir. They regularly buy prisoners to work the clinic. Give them second chances.”  
  
  “Ah.” Merik could barely bite back a smile. Pin’s Keep was a shelter for the poorest of Lovats. It had been a project of Merik’s mother, and upon the queen’s death, it had passed directly to Vivia.  
  
  How easy. Just like that, Merik had the found the sinew binding Garren to Vivia. All he lacked was tangible proof—something physical that he could hand to the High Council showing, beyond any doubt, that his sister was a murderer. That she was not fit to rule.  
  
  Now he had a lead. A good one.  
  
  Before Merik could loose a smile, the sound of metal scraping on wood filled the room.  
  
  Merik turned as the outside door swung in and met the eyes of a startled young guard.  
  
  Well, this was unfortunate.  
  
  For the guard.  
  
  Out snapped Merik’s winds, grabbing the guard like a doll. Then in they whipped, and he was flung straight for Merik.  
  
  Whose fist was ready.  
  
  Merik’s torn knuckles connected with the guard’s jaw. Full speed. A hurricane against a mountain. The guard was out in an instant, and as his limp form crumpled, Merik threw a glance at the first soldier.  
  
  But the older man was at the door to the prison now, fumbling with  
a lock to escape and muttering, “Too old for this. Too old for this.”  
  
  Hell-waters. A flash of guilt hit Merik’s chest. He had what he’d come for, and hanging around was simply asking for more trouble. So he left the soldier to his escape and slung toward the hut’s open door.  
  
  Only to stop halfway as a screeching woman tumbled inside. “There’s no crime in being hungry! Free us and feed us!”  
  
  It was that woman, and her two sons straggled in behind. Noden hang him, but hadn’t Merik had enough interruptions for one day?  
  
  The answer was no, apparently he had not.  
  
  Upon spotting the unconscious guard and then Merik’s unhooded face, the woman fell completely silent. Totally still. There was something in her bloodshot eyes, something hopeful.  
  
  “You,” she breathed. Then she stumbled forward, arms outstretched. “Please, Fury, we’ve done nothing wrong.”  
  
  Merik yanked up his hood, the pain briefly louder than any sounds. Brighter too, even as the woman and her sons closed in.  
  
  Her hands grabbed Merik’s hand. “Please, Fury!” she repeated, and inwardly Merik winced at that title. Was he truly so grotesque? “Please, sir! We’ve been good and given our respects to your shrine! We don’t deserve your wrath—we just want to feed our families!”  
  
  Merik tore himself free. Skin split beneath her fingernails. Any moment now, soldiers would be pouring in from the records office, and though Merik could fight these boys and their mother, that would only draw attention.  
  
  “Free us and feed us, you said?” Merik scooped a ring of keys from the unconscious guard’s belt. “Take these.”  
  
  The cursed woman cowered back from Merik’s outstretched hand.  
  
  And now he was out of time. The familiar sound of a wind-drum was booming outside. Soldiers needed, said the beat, in Judgment Square.  
  
  So Merik flung the keys at the nearest son, who caught them clumsily. “Free the prisoners if you want, but be quick about it. Because now would be a good time for all of us to run.”  
  
  Then Merik thrust into the crowds, bobbing low and moving fast. For though the woman and her sons lacked the good sense to flee, Merik Nihar did not.  
 After all, even dead men could have lives they didn’t want to lose.  
  
  TWO  
  
  This was not Azmir.  
  
  Safiya fon Hasstrel might have been a poor geography student, but even she knew this crescent-moon bay was not the capital of Marstok. Though weasels piss on her, she wished it were.  
  
  Anything would be more interesting than staring at the same turquoise waves she’d been staring at for the past week, so at odds with the dark, dense jungle beyond. For here, on the easternmost edge of the Contested Lands—a long peninsula of no-man’s-land that didn’t quite belong to the pirate factions in Saldonica and didn’t quite belong to the empires either—there was absolutely nothing of interest to do.  
  
  Paper whispered behind Safi, almost in time to the sea’s swell, and overtop it sang the infinitely calm voice of the Empress of Marstok. All day long, she worked through missives and messages on a low table at the center of her cabin, stopping only to update Safi on some complicated political alliance or recent shift in her empire’s southern borders.  
  
  It was excruciatingly dull, and the simple truth was, at least in Safi’s opinion, that pretty people should not be allowed to lecture. Nothing negated beauty faster than boredom.  
  
  “Are you listening, Domna?”  
  
  “Of course I am, Your Majesty!” Safi twirled around, her white gown billowing. She batted her eyelashes for an extra dose of innocence.  
  
  Vaness wasn’t buying it. Her heart-shaped face had hardened, and Safi didn’t think she was imagining how the empress’s iron belt rippled and grooved like two snakes sliding past each other.  
  
  Vaness was, according to scholars, the youngest, most powerful empress in all of the Witchlands history. She was also, according to legend, the strongest, most vicious Ironwitch who had ever lived, having felled an entire mountain when she was only seven years old. And, of course, according to Safi, Vaness was the most beautiful, most elegant woman who had ever graced the world with her presence.  
  
  Yet none of that mattered because gods below, Vaness was tedious.  
  
  No card games, no jokes, no exciting stories by Firewitch flame—nothing at all to make this wait more bearable. They’d dropped anchor here a week before, hiding first from a Cartorran cutter. Then from a Cartorran armada. Everyone had been braced for a naval battle …  
  
  That had never come. And while Safi knew this to be a good thing—war was senseless, as Habim always said—she’d also learned that waiting all day long was her own form of private hell.  
  
  Especially since her entire life had been upended two and a half weeks ago. A surprise betrothal to the Emperor of Cartorra had pulled her into a cyclone of conspiracy and escape. She’d learned her uncle, a man she’d spent her whole life loathing, was behind some massive, wide-scale plan to bring peace to the Witchlands.  
  
  Then, because Safi’s life wasn’t complicated enough already, she’d discovered that she and her Threadsister Iseult might be the mythical Cahr Awen, whose duty it was to heal magic across the Witchlands.  
  
  The empress cleared her throat emphatically, snapping Safi’s mind back to the present.  
  
  “My treaty with the Baedyed Pirates is incredibly important for Marstok.” Vaness lifted her eyebrows sternly. “It took years to come to an agreement with them, and thousands of lives will be saved because of it—you are not even listening now, Domna!”  
  
  This was not entirely untrue, yet Safi took offense at the empress’s tone. After all, she’d been wearing her best I-am-a-perfect-student face, and Vaness really ought to appreciate that. It wasn’t as if Safi ever bothered to school her features with her mentors, Mathew and Habim. Nor even with Iseult.  
  
  Safi’s throat tightened. Instinctively, she grabbed for the Threadstone resting against her collarbone. Every few minutes, she’d haul out the uncut ruby and stare into its flickering depths.  
  
  It was supposed to light up if Iseult was in danger. Yet not a flash so far. Not a peep. This had soothed Safi at first—it was all she’d had to cling to, really. Her only connection to her Threadsister. Her better half. Her logical get-Safi-out-of-trouble half. The person who never would have let Safi agree to join the empress.  
  
  In hindsight, Safi could see what a fool’s bargain she’d made, offering up her Truthwitchery so the empress could root out corruption in her Marstoki court. Safi had thought herself oh so noble and oh so self-sacrificing, for by joining Vaness, Safi was helping the dying nation of Nubrevna win trade.  
  
  The truth was, though, that she was stuck. On a ship. In the middle of nowhere. With only the Empress of Insipid for company.  
  
  “Sit with me,” Vaness ordered, cutting through Safi’s self-inflicted misery. “Since you clearly do not care for Baedyed politics, perhaps this message will interest you.”  
  
  Safi’s interest perked up. A message. Already this afternoon had turned more enticing than yesterday’s.  
  
  Resting her hands on her own iron belt, she crossed the lolling cabin to an empty bench opposite the empress. Vaness rifled through a stack of mismatched papers, the slightest scowl knitting her brow.  
  
  It brought to mind a different face often pinched with a frown. A different leader who, like the Empress of Marstok, put his people’s lives forever above his own.  
  
  Merik.  
  
  Safi’s lungs expanded. Her traitorous cheeks warmed. It was only one kiss they’d shared, so really, this blush could stop now.  
  
  As if answering her thoughts, Safi glimpsed a single name atop the page Vaness now withdrew: Prince of Nubrevna. Her pulse quickened. Maybe this was it—maybe, finally, she would have news of the world and the people she’d left behind.  
  
  Before she could learn anything or catch any words, though, the door to the empress’s cabin burst wide. A man rushed in, dressed as a sailor in Marstoki green. He spotted Safi and Vaness, and for two heartbeats, he simply stared.  
  
  False. The word fretted down Safi’s spine, her Truthwitchery tingling. A warning that what she saw was a lie. That duplicity now gaped at her while he lifted a single hand.  
  
  “Look out!” Safi tried to grab for the empress, tried to yank them both down for cover. But she was too slow. The sailor had pulled the trigger on his pistol.  
  
  It fired with a crack!  
  
  The shot never connected. It halted midair, a spinning ball of iron mere inches from the empress’s face.  
  
  Then a blade cut through the attacker’s back and a bloodied steel tip erupted from his belly. A singing slice that severed spine and organ and skin.  
  
  The sword ripped back. The body fell. The leader of Vaness’s personal guards appeared, dressed in black from head to toe, his blade dripping with blood.  
  
  The Adder High. “Assassin.” He offered the word so calmly. “You know what to do, Your Majesty.”  
  
  Without another word, he was gone.  
  
  The iron shot finally dropped from the air. It clattered to the floor and rolled, the sound lost to a sudden roaring of voices outside.  
  
  “Come,” was all Vaness said. Then, as if she feared Safi might not listen, she tightened the iron belt at Safi’s waist and yanked her toward the door with her magic.  
  
  Safi had no choice but to hurry after, despite the swelling horror in her throat. Despite the questions flinging across her mind.  
  
  They reached the assassin. Vaness slowed long enough to glance down. She sniffed dismissively, lifting her black skirts, and stepped across his corpse. Her feet tracked blood on the other side.  
  
  Safi, meanwhile, made sure to step around.  
  
  She also made sure not to look at the man’s dead eyes. Blue and staring straight at the caulked ceiling.  
  
  Outside, chaos had taken hold, yet Vaness faced it all without emotion. A flick of her hands and the iron shackles at her wrists melted outward into four thin walls that encased her and Safi. A shield. The empress then cut left across the deck. Voices hollered in Marstoki, all of them muffled and tinny.  
  
  Yet fully understandable. A second assassin was thought to be on board, and the Adders and the crew had to find him.  
  
  “Faster,” V  
aness commanded Safi, and the belt towed harder.  
  
  “Where are we going?” Safi shouted back. She saw nothing inside this shield save the perfect, clear sky above.  
  
  Soon enough Safi had an answer. They reached the warship’s launch gig, stored astern and suspended for easy release into the waves. Vaness melted her front shield into a set of steps, which she immediately ascended.  
  
  Then they were in the swinging boat, iron spreading around the gig’s edges. Walls to keep them safe. But no roof, no protection against the voice now roaring, “He’s belowdecks!”  
  
  Vaness met Safi’s eyes. “Hold on,” she warned. Then her hands rose, chains clanked, and the gig lurched.  
  
  They dropped to the waves. Safi almost toppled off her seat, and spindrift sprayed in—followed by a sticky, salty breeze as Safi righted herself. It was all so calm, so quiet down here. Her knees bounced—how could it be so serene when violence ruled nearby?  
  
  The calm was a lie, for a single breath later, a burst of brilliant light stormed above the shields, glittery with glass and power. The boat flew back, tipping dangerously.  
  
  Last of all came the thunder. Violent. Scalding. Alive.  
  
  The ship had blown up.  
  
  Flames charged against the shield, yet the empress held the onslaught at bay. Paper-thin, the shields spread, coating the entire gig. Protecting Vaness and Safi against raging heat and cuffing the hell-fires to a muted roar.  
  
  Blood dripped from the empress’s nose, and her muscles quaked. A sign she could not hold her shield against the madness forever.  
  
  So Safi snatched up the oars from the gig’s belly. Not once did she consider if this was what she should do—just as she would not consider swimming when trapped beneath a tide. There were oars and a shore to aim for, so she acted.  
  
  Seeing what Safi intended, Vaness formed two holes in the shield for the oars. Smoke and heat gushed in.  
  
  Safi ignored it, even as her fingers burned and as her lungs filled with salty smoke.  
  
  Stroke after stroke, she carried Vaness and herself away from death, until at last the gig thunked against dark gravel. Until at last, the empress allowed her iron shield to fall. It coiled back into decorative shackles at her wrists, giving Safi a full view of the black flames burning before them.  
  
  Seafire.  
  
  Its dark thirst could not be slaked. Wind could not snuff it out. Water only fanned its resinous flames all the higher.  
  
  Safi scooped her arms around the flagging empress and dragged them both into the soft waves. She felt no relief at having survived this attack. No heady satisfaction surged through her because she’d made it to shore. She felt only a growing emptiness. A gathering dark. For this was her life now. Not boredom and lectures, but hell-flames and assassins. Massacres and endless flight.  
  
  And no one could save her from it but herself.  
  
  I could run right now, she thought, eyeing the long shoreline—the mangroves and palm trees beyond. The empress wouldn’t even notice. Probably wouldn’t care either.  
  
  If Safi aimed southwest, she would eventually reach the Pirate Republic of Saldonica. The only civilization—if it could be called that—and the only place to find a ship out of here. Yet she was almost certain that she could not survive in that cesspool of humanity alone.  
  
  Her fingers moved to her Threadstone, for now that Safi’s life hung on a knife’s edge, the ruby had finally flared to life.  
  
  If Iseult were here, then Safi could charge off into that jungle without a second thought. With Iseult, Safi was brave. She was strong. She was fearless. But Safi had no idea where her Threadsister was, nor any clue when she’d see her again—or if she’d see her again.  
  
  Which meant, for now, Safi’s chances were better with the Empress of Marstok.  
  
  Once the warship had burned to a flaming skeleton and the heat off the attack had drawn back, Safi turned to Vaness. The empress stood rooted to the ground, stiff as the iron she controlled.  
  
  Ash streaked her skin. Two lines of blood dried beneath her nose.  
  
  “We need to hide,” Safi croaked. Gods below, she needed water. Cold, soothing salt-free water. “The fire will draw the Cartorran armada to us.”  
  
  Ever so slowly, the empress cracked her gaze from the horizon and fixed it on Safi. “There might,” she growled, “be survivors.”  
  
  Safi’s lips pressed thin, but she didn’t argue. And perhaps it was that lack of argument that set Vaness’s shoulders to sinking ever so slightly.  
  
  “We aim for Saldonica,” was all the Empress of Marstok said next. Then she set off with Safi stalking behind, across the rocky beach and toward the gathering dark.  
  
  THREE  
  
  Stasis, Iseult det Midenzi told herself for the thousandth time since dawn. Stasis in your fingers and in your toes.  
  
  Not that she could feel her fingers or her toes. She’d been sprinting downhill in this freezing mountain stream for what seemed an eternity. Twice she’d fallen, and twice she’d dunked herself head to foot.  
  
  But she couldn’t stop. She just had to keep running. Although to where had been a recurring question. If she’d read her map correctly all those hours ago, before the Cleaved had picked up her scent and started chasing, then she must be somewhere near the northernmost tip of the Contested Lands.  
  
  Which meant no settlements to take refuge in. No people to save her from what hunted behind.  
  
  For a week, Iseult had been traveling toward Marstok. The dead, lowlands around Lejna had eventually turned steep. Hilly. Iseult had never been anywhere that wasn’t flat enough to see the sky. Oh, she’d seen snowcapped peaks and craggy foothills in illustrations and she’d heard Safi describe them, but she never could have guessed how small they would make her feel. How cut off and trapped, when hills blocked her vision of the sky.  
  
  It was made all the worse by the complete absence of Threads. As a Threadwitch, Iseult could see the Threads that build, the Threads that bind, the Threads that break. A thousand colors to shimmer over her at every moment of every day. Except that without people, there were no Threads—and without Threads, there was no added color to fill her eyes, her mind.  
  
  Iseult was and had been alone for days. She’d trekked over pine needle carpets, and only the hundreds of trees creaking in the wind had kept her company. Yet no matter the terrain, Iseult had moved carefully. Never leaving a mark, never leaving a trail, and always, always moving east.  
  
  Until this morning.  
  
  Four Cleaved had picked up Iseult’s trail. She had no idea where they’d come from or how they had followed. This salamander-fiber cloak that the Bloodwitch Aeduan had given her two weeks ago was meant to block her scent from the Cleaved, yet it had, thus far, failed her. Iseult could feel the black corruption of Cleaved Threads still hunting.  
  
  And they gained ground with each passing minute.  
  
  I should wrap the Threadstone, Iseult thought vaguely, a distant thrum of inner dialogue to weave between her stamping, splashing footsteps. Wrap it in a bit of cloth so it doesn’t keep bruising me when I run.  
  
  She’d thought this particular refrain at least a hundred times now, for this wasn’t the first time she had found herself sprinting over rough forest terrain. Yet every time she’d finally been able to pause and duck beneath a log, she’d been so focused on catching her breath or straining her witchery for some sign of pursuing Threads that she’d forgotten to wrap the Threadstone. At least until it started bruising her again.  
  
  Other times, Iseult would tumble so deeply into daydreams that she’d forget her surroundings entirely for a bit. She’d imagine what it might be like to actually be the Cahr Awen.  
  
  Iseult and Safi had gone in the Origin Well of Nubrevna. They had touched its spring, and an earthquake had rolled through the land. I have found the Cahr Awen, Monk Evrane had then told Iseult and Safi, and you have awoken the Water Well.  
  
  For Safi, that title made perfect sense. She was sunshine and simplicity. Of course she would be the Light-Bringer half of the Cahr Awen. But Iseult was not the opposite of Safi. She wasn’t starshine or c  
omplexity. She wasn’t anything at all.  
  
  Unless I am. Unless I can be.  
  
  Iseult would drift asleep with those thoughts to warm her.  
  
  Today, though, was the first time Threadstone had ever flashed—a sign Iseult was truly in danger. She just hoped that, wherever Safi might be right now, she wasn’t panicking at the sight of her own blinking stone.  
  
  Iseult also hoped that the stone flared only for her, for if it glowed because Safi was also threatened …  
  
  No, Iseult couldn’t worry like that. All she could do right now was run.  
  
  To think, it had been only two weeks since all hell-fire had broken loose in Lejna. Since Iseult had lost Safi to the Marstoks, had rescued Merik from a collapsed building, and had decided she would go after her Threadsister no matter what.  
  
  Iseult had scoured the ghost city of Lejna after that, until she had found Mathew’s abandoned coffee shop. There’d been food in the kitchen, and clean water too. She’d even found a sack of silver coins in the cellar.  
  
  When no one had come for her after eight days, though, Iseult had been forced to assume no one ever would. Dom Eron had likely heard of Safi’s kidnapping by the Empress of Marstok; Habim, Mathew, and Eron were likely headed after her now.  
  
  Leaving Iseult with no choice but to set off at a steady pace northeast, sleeping by day, traveling by night. For there were only two types of people in the forests of the Witchlands: those who tried to kill you and those who got you killed. Both camps were best avoided.  
  
  Yet in the darkness that Iseult traveled by, there were other things waiting. Shadows and breezes and memories she couldn’t lock away. She thought about Safi. She thought about her mother. She thought about Corlant and his cursed arrow that had almost taken her life. She thought of the Cleaved from Lejna and the teardrop-shaped scar they’d left behind.  
  
  And she thought of the Puppeteer, who tried endlessly to invade Iseult’s dreams. A Weaverwitch, she called herself, all while insisting Iseult was just like her. But the Puppeteer cleaved people and controlled their Threads. Iseult could—would—never do that.

I've seen people online make freddo cappuccino and keen to try it, but would like to get the espresso cold. I see some do this  by whisking ice with a freshly pulled shot, would that be safe to do in the Ninja Luxe magnetic whisker without damaging the machine do you think? Or using the cold brew throther with an ice cube in the milk jug instead of milk? 

Note: I know the machine can do ""cold brew"" and ""coffee over ice"" but I think they are both different (more water) than a traditional freddo cappuccino 

Note: I also appreciate I could just leave the espresso in ice without whisking it but the benefit of this is both to cool it down quickly and also to get some more air into the espresso I think, or at least I guess that's why some people do this",1,1754850212.0,NinjaLuxeCafe,0,1.0,False
