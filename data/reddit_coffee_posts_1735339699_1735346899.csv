I used Shazam and found out it is playing an artist called Hayden. Wtf is going on??? Will they exchange it if it’s open and used? Anyone else get one of these bad boys for Christmas and have this issue, it is unbelievable lol.

After three years of sitting under fluorescent lights, watching my creativity slowly drain away, I finally did it. I handed in my resignation letter, said goodbye to my cubicle, and walked out the door toward my real passion: writing.

For the longest time, writing was my escape. I'd come home exhausted from meetings and spreadsheets, but the moment I opened my laptop to write, it felt like I could breathe again. What started as late-night writing sessions and weekend warrior word counts slowly grew into something more.

Everything changed when I found my writing community. Like many writers, I'd been active on places like Scribophile and AbsoluteWrite, but when I joined [WritersCan.com](http://WritersCan.com), something clicked. It wasn't just another forum – it was a whole ecosystem of serious writers working toward publication. 

The structured programs, monthly contests with actual publishing opportunities, and professional mentorship pushed me to treat my writing as more than just a hobby. When I won one of their contests, it wasn't just about the prize – it was validation. The intensive feedback and guidance helped me transform my rough manuscript into my first published novel.

This morning, as I packed up my desk and turned in my keycard, my hands were shaking. But you know what? For the first time in years, I feel truly alive. No more hiding my writing time during lunch breaks. No more apologizing for taking days off to attend writing workshops. No more dreaming about ""someday.""

Today isn't just the end of my corporate career – it's the first day of my real life. My desk at home is already set up, my outline is ready, and my coffee is brewing. I'm terrified and exhilarated and completely, utterly free.",1,1735346464.0,writers,1,1.0,False

1hnth7y,https://www.reddit.com/r/Tik_tok_stories/comments/1hnth7y/a_niagara_vacation/,A Niagara vacation,"
 It was so terribly cold. Snow was falling, and it was almost dark, when out of the blue, my wife called me at work. ""We're going to Niagara Falls for the weekend. I got us an awesome deal!""

We had both been working at our first ""full-fledged"" jobs for a year and had reached that moment after graduation when you suddenly realize you can't make that impact on the world your student enthusiasm once promised. At first, I just sighed. It was the dead of January, and I had already expended all my energy on a week of inconsequential stress. I just wanted to collapse on the couch for two days. Sarah felt a similar weary exhaustion. I could tell. Her tone was more hopeful than excited, but she had dreaded the routine we were sinking into and was trying her best to pull us free.

I looked to the ceiling and adjusted my telephone headset. At that time I was working at Stats Canada on the tele-query desk. I took a deep breath and, as convincingly as possible, said, ""Sounds good."" I don't think she bought it, but we went nonetheless.

This was Niagara Falls before the casinos when there was a very distinct off-season. When we got to the hotel, we were given the details of our ""lovers' special"". One dinner to be used either Friday or Saturday, two breakfasts, a roll of tokens for the arcade, 10% off some ""4D"" movie ride experience, and a 2-for-1 coupon to Max Tussaud's. I guessed it was Madame's nephew? We also got a bottle of sparkling wine in our room and chocolate treats on our pillows. I was impressed. It sounded good.

When we got into our room and saw the ""bottle"" of wine - basically an aeroplane-sized glass and half - and the chocolates - ""fun wrapped"" Oh Henry's left over from Halloween - we both started to laugh. The tone for two wonderful days had been set. We decided to cash in on our dinner coupon right away.

The restaurant off the lobby had hopes of being better. There were huge panoramic windows that promised a view of the gorge. Unfortunately, they had some winter moisture problems that day, and it felt like we were defrosting amid the dripping streaks and foggy patches. The decor was your standard booths and tables though the ""romantic"" lighting was unique. Dollar store battery-powered tea lights were lodged inside thick tumbler glasses and shed a muted pleasantness in a ""what a great idea for a craft"" sort of way. I had a feeling they were created by our waitress since she was the one who always seemed to be fussing with them. Only one other couple was in the dining room, so she attended to us immediately.

""Can I get you something to start?""

""Sure."" ""Thank you, that would be nice."" We both responded simultaneously.

""And what would the lady like this evening?""

Sarah smiled at the flattery. ""I think I'll have a glass of white wine."" She glanced over at me to see my reaction. This was a subtle cue of the mood to follow. Diet Coke was usually the beverage of choice. She didn't normally drink alcohol. One glass numbed her nose and made her giggle far too easily. When she did drink, however, it meant she was comfortable with my company and open to anything to follow. I raised my eyebrows in a debonair way.

""And for the gentleman?""

""Do you have Foster's on tap?""

""Yes we do.""

""I'll have a pint please.""

Sarah smiled at the happy memories I invoked. At university, Foster's was my signature beer. It was at a time when Crocodile Dundee was a known name, and Australia was inexplicably cool. 15 cent buffalo wings and a pitcher of Foster's was the Tuesday night special at the London Arms pub. There the Classics Club would meet and, as a group, circle the wagons and drink ourselves into extroverts.

As soon as the waitress left, Sarah smiled at me. She reached out and held my hand across the table. With my gaze on hers, she slipped her foot from her shoe and slowly began sliding it up my pant leg.

""I got a pedicure this morning."" She announced seductively.

I nodded and pretended I didn't notice her invitation. ""What colour?"" I asked.

""I'm not telling."" She teased. ""You'll just have to find out later."" Her devious little smile was gorgeous.

""Mmmm. I can't wait.""

When the waitress returned with our drinks, we immediately retreated to our personal spaces as if we had been discovered by the chaperone. Sarah opened the menu and began to salivate at the variety.

""Can we add an appetizer to the package dinner?"" Her question seemed innocent enough.

""You're on the package?"" Our friendly waitress disappeared, and we were no longer a lady or a gentleman. She ripped the menu out of Sarah's hand and took mine before I had even opened it. She then scurried to her podium and brought back a tattered, grease-stained, photocopied page that we had to share. We both burst out laughing.

The waitress was flustered that we were not as bothered as she was. ""The drinks are NOT included!""

""What choices do we have?"" I asked, expecting the usual chicken or fish. I had been on many packages before with my parents.

""Coffee or tea."" The waitress snapped.

Sarah and I looked at each other in amused disbelief.

""I'll have coffee please."" I didn't even flinch at the ridiculously limited package. I was eager to get my order in early.

""And I'll have the tea!"" Sarah followed my lead. ""Can I have some milk with that?""

""Yes."" The waitress snarled.

""Fantastic!"" I enthused.

""Yes, great! I'm glad we got the package, Honey."" Sarah joked.

The waitress stormed off and returned sometime later with our lettuce-only salads drowned in Kraft's Italian dressing and our chewy chicken dinners, which she had thoughtfully allowed to cool. She tossed the plates on the table and left us to peacefully devour our deal. We didn't see her again until we requested the bill. For some reason, we found it amusing to leave a generous tip, which of course, defeated the purpose of the package, but we didn't care. It was fun.

The rest of the holiday was marred with similar off-season products and services. The wax museum was only half open, so we couldn't see the pop stars of the seventies. I didn't think it was a problem, but Sarah pouted playfully. She really wanted to see young Bowie. Meanwhile, the arcade was particularly stingy about spitting out coupons. So much so that Mike, the scraggly-haired repair guy, ended up escorting us from game to game and repairing the devices on demand. In no time, he was acting like an old drinking buddy. He joked and laughed, then, out of the blue, revealed that working at the Niagara Falls Fun Centre wasn't his career choice, that his dream was to be part of a travelling carnival. He desperately wanted to see more of the world, he explained and socialize with a greater variety of ""wildlife."" Mike winked at Sarah to punctuate his meaning, then began advising her on which games to play.

Sarah was partial to Skee ball and clearly had career potential in the sport, but Mike quickly pointed out that the token-to-coupon payout was not the best. In a furtive whisper, he revealed that The Storm Stopper was your best bet, provided the arcade had left it on its original factory settings. He assured us the ones here were ""cool."" The game had lights that ran around the outside in opposite directions and you had to hit the button at just the right spot to win. It looked impossible, but Mike was right; if you calculated tokens in versus coupons won, it was the best deal. It only took a little practice to win a minor jackpot every 5 or 6 times.

We would cheer each win as if Toronto had won the Stanley Cup. I would give a quick fist pump and a full lung ""Yes!"" while Sarah would jump up and down screaming, ""WhoooHooo!"" Of course, in the end, when we cashed in, ""Mike's secret"" only bumped us up from a key-chain flashlight to a ""deluxe"" nail beauty set. Mind you, it did come complete with clippers, scissors, a file AND a cuticle scraper. Not only that, it was all neatly packaged in a paisley-patterned pink and green plastic vinyl case. Mike was so pleased to give us our prize and to be honest, we were thrilled to win it if only to see his broad chicletted smile. It was more of a trophy than a grooming set.

That night, I made reservations for us at a fancy Chinese food restaurant - the Bamboo Garden. When we arrived, we had half-expected renovations of some sort. Instead, the place was immaculate. Gentle pools teeming with goldfish highlighted the epic black and red Ming dynasty decor. Real candles flickered on crisp white tablecloths. Again, the restaurant was virtually ours. The reservations on my part were entirely unnecessary. In fact, as soon as we entered, they knew us by name and guided us directly to our table. A live lounge piano caressed the air, its notes danced vaguely around familiar harmonies until finally, as if prompted by our presence, a song emerged immediately accompanied by the velvet voice of oriental karaoke.

1hntebi,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1hntebi,THE FIRST BRAZILIAN SERIAL KILLER ,"Ok, I'm making this post because few people know about its existence, even Brazilians have forgotten about it. (Sorry for my English, I don't know how to write that language very well)


José Augusto do Amaral, known as ""Preto do Amaral"", is considered the first serial killer in the history of Brazil (and probably one of the first in Latin America).

He was born in Conquista, in the state of Minas Gerais, in 1871. We do not know the identity of his parents, what little we know about them and that they were both slaves, in a period of Brazilian history when slavery had not yet existed. been abolished.

The ""Lei Áurea"", also known as Imperial Law 3,353, was signed by Princess Isabel on May 13, 1888 and symbolizes the end of slavery in Brazil. The law freed between 700,000 and 1 million slaves, making them citizens of Brazil. José Augusto now saw himself as a free man, but he did not have many job options, mainly because of the racism that was still present in society, but also because of his poor education and cognitive development. 

Without many job options, he ended up enlisting in the army and served in several Brazilian cities, and even participated in the War of Canudos. He deserted several times from battalions he served in, whether in the army or in the police guard and, finally, he ended up arrested, spending months in jail.

After traveling around Brazil as a volunteer for his country, at the age of 55 Amaral was living on side jobs in São Paulo. At this time, between 1926 and 1927, José began to commit his murders.

In 1926, when he was already 55 years old and had a wanderer's life and lived on side jobs, he committed his first alleged crime. Antônio Sanches, the first victim, was already 27 years old. In his statement, Amaral states that he found him on the outskirts of Tiradentes square and that the victim asked him for matches. After having coffee in a café, Amaral invited the boy to watch a football game. The body was found near ""Campo de Marte"" airport, in the north zone.

The next victim, José Felippe Carvalho, was 10 years old when he died, on Christmas Eve 1926. Amaral attracted the boy by giving him some of the balloons he sold in the Canindé region. José was found 13 days after his death, already without his upper limbs.

Antônio Lemos, was 15 years old when his body was located, the São Paulo police realized that they were dealing with the same killer 

Amaral was only captured thanks to Roque Piccili, a 9-year-old shoeshine boy. He took the boy under a bridge and was strangling the poor guy when he heard voices, got scared and ran away. When he returned, he did not find the almost victim, who at that time was already at the nearest police station reporting his almost murderer. Soon after that he was arrested, tortured by the police and ended up confessing to his alleged crimes. He was already famous in São Paulo even before his arrest, as the newspapers at the time reported about a serial killer in the city and he already had the nicknames in the local media of ""The Black Monster"" and ""The Black Devil"". 

Some cases continued to happen, even with Preto Amaral arrested. As a result, he ended up becoming an urban legend, like Bloody Mary. Preto Amaral died of tuberculosis even before being tried, five months after being arrested, in 1927.",8,1735345869.0,serialkillers,3,1.0,False
1hntdcr,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_NocturneVeil/comments/1hntdcr/unknowingly_part_of_an_affair/,Unknowingly Part of an Affair,"This story happened a few years back when I was in my early 30s. 

For context, I am a your typical boy next door type of guy. Yung tipong pwede mong ipakilala sa parents mo. Back then, I just got out from a very toxic relationship. 

After a few months of being single, I began missing having sex. With my toxic ex, we used to fuck like rabbits. We really fucked almost twice daily. Ganun ata talaga mga toxic na partners, sila yung masasarap sa kama. 

Anyway, I met this girl from the yellow app. She is very pretty, morena, makinis, chinita and a very hot body. She's not skinny, nor chubby but she has a nice boobs and butt.

I asked for her socials but she was reluctant to give it, saying we need to see each other first. 

We decided to meet for dinner and coffee. 

Apparently, she works as a psychologist/professor and is part of a group where people seek help for mental health issues.

We immediately clicked. It was on our first date when we  had sex. I remember how it went:

We were driving back from Tagaytay and we were talking about zodiac signs. She was telling me she always checks the zodiac compatibility first before dating someone. Then she revealed she was a Scorpio. I then recalled the movie Scorpio Nights and asked her, ""Is it true that Scorpio's are passionate in bed?"" She replied, ""Wanna find out?"" I felt that the atmosphere began to change. I dont know if its the wine we had but parang biglang uminit. She opened up na sobrang malibog siyang tao but she wants to establish a good connection as a foundation of a good sex. She began telling things na she moans loud, she can go multiple rounds and she likes fucking anywhere (even tried it sa stairs). She mentioned na it really turns her on kapag hinahalikan siya sa leeg at tenga. I then replied, ""I really wanna validate that."" To my surprise pumayag siya. She removed her jacket as she was wearing a tube giving me access to her arms and neck. Sobrang libog na libog ako nung tinanggal niya jacket niya kasi naexpose yung makinis niyang arms and neck.

Itinabi ko yung car ko, and started kissing her neck. I started with very slow kisses, added some tongue to it, then dahan dahan paakyat sa tenga niya. She was wearing a very familiar scent--a Gucci Bloom. I commented how hot her scent was. I continued kissing her hanggang sa naramdaman kong tumitindig na ang balahibo niya. I caressed her legs while slowly tracing my hand papunta sa pussy niya. I slid my finger up and down sa hiwa niya and realized that she is soaking wet. 

""Sorry, mabilis talaga akong mabasa."" She said. 

Pinaikot ikot ko yung daliri ko sa clit niya, pagakatapos pinasok ko yung middle finger ko. Binaba niya yung tube niya revealing her boobs. 

I sucked her nipples and fingered her at the same time. Naghalikan kami very passionately and she whispered (in a very hot and desperate tone), ""Tara mag check-in na tayo"" .

We stopped and when we found the nearest sogo, we immediately went to the drive in. 

I went down the car as I wanted to get my stuff sa trunk. She followed me pala, pulled me towards her and kissed her. 

Binuhat ko sya and iniupo sa trunk, sobrang gigil na gigil siya and she was unbuckling my belt na to expose my hard cock. 

""Tang ina fuck me na, put it inside.""

I was able to control myself kasi I havent put my condom on yet so sabi ko mamaya na. To compromise I went down on her. Parang wala siyang pake she moaned and moaned and looked so hot kasi parang lunod na lunod siya sa libog. She was holding on the my car habang nakataas ang kamay kaya kitang kita ko yung makinis niyang kili kili. 

Bumaba na si kuya and we immediately went upstairs. Im sure rinig nya yung moan nung kadate ko.

We did not waste time. Sa pintuan palang intense na ang halikan namin. We were like two people who just got out of jail. Isinandal ko siya sa pader and dinakma ko yung pwet niya while slapping it. Ang galing ng dila niya. We were doing torrid french kisses as we removed our clothes.

To my surprise, dinuraan niya yung kamay niya and gave me a hand job while we were kissing. Sobrang libog na ako and I ate her down there. Ipinatong ko yung legs niya sa balikat ko as I ate her. She said, ""im cumming"" so tinuloy ko lalo ginagawa ko. Nafeel kong nanginig katawan niya and then she led me to the bed. ""Ako naman"". Pinahiga nya ako.

She kissed me from my neck then pumunta siya sa gilid ko. She spat on her hand and she gave me a sloppg hand job while licking my nipples. Fuck parang nahihigop yung kaluluwa ko nun sa sobrang sarap. She gave me a blow job, and sa sobrang gulat ko, she licked my ass. It was my first time pero PUTANG INA SOBRANG SARAP. 

Everytime she licks it para akong nawawala sa sarili. I took out my condoms and then sinakyan niya ako. She was on top fucking me intensly while kissing my lips and neck. These arent slow paced woman on top position. Hard, mabilis, gigil while passionately kissing me. Ako naman, I asked her to stop and made a rapid hard fuck from below.

Pinahiga ko siya at ako naman ang pumatong. I got into a position na I was fucking her while licking her nipples. Sarap na sarap siya dun. 

We then went to dog style and I fucked her while slapping her ass. Dumapa siya for a prone bone.

We did a spoon afterwards. Lalo akong nalibugan dahil kitang kita ko sa salamin ang kabuuan ng katawan niya. 

Pinaupo niya ako sa gilid ng bed and siya naman ang umibabaw ulit sa akin while facing me. Dito nanaman siya nilabasan. 

She took out my condom, pinahiga niya ako, gave me that signature handjob, nung sinabi kong malapit na ako, sucked my cock and swallowed all the cum I released.

We had an all nighter and fucked until 4am. Sex-wash up-pahinga then repeat.

We constantly chatted, and met. We went to movies and tried different restaurants. She was so fun to be with. 

Whenever I'm with her, it feels like she was the sun. She always brightened my day no matter how dark it was. 

Iba talaga pag may connection. 

I recall na I we had a company event, I was not one into putting so much effort sa mga costumes/themes pero she dressed me up and prepped me. Nanalo pa nga ako na 2nd place.

There was also a time na my dad and I fought, she immediately came to meet me and supported me. She made me realize na I was at fault too, and I should apologize for that particular mistake. I followed her advice and to my surprise, my proud dad apologizes to me too and we reconciled. 

She was the type of person who listens, who has an impeccable timing for cracking jokes and at the same time fucks like an animal. 

Naalala ko talaga when we to a museum. She was so engrossed taking photos, reading habang ako I was just observing her from afar.

There was a time she asked to meet me. Urgent daw. So I picked her up, we just stayed in the car and she cried. I wanted to ask her why, pero she kept silent. It was so heartbreaking looking at her cry. I never imagined someone this jolly and strong-willed would cry this much. 

Umiyak lang siya and then she stopped. She wiped her tears and told me, ""Tara! Lets have a dinner."" --forcing a smile.

Parang walang nangyari. I asked her why was she crying and she gave me a very cryptic reply: Because, ""A wandering compass often leads to uncharted waters"".

She told me to pick a nice place for dinner as she wanted to treat me and go ahead. May errand lang daw siya. So i parked and we went on separate ways. I chose a restaurant and waited. 

She came back and gave me a gift. It had a note saying ""Thanks for sticking with me for one month!"" I had mixed emotions, I don't know how to interpret this message.

Apparently, she was the wandering compass and our set up was the uncharted waters. 

When I got home, I opened the gift, I was shocked and I was so happy with it. I messaged her to say thanks. We continued chatting but somehow, her replies were one liners and lacked the energy/enthusiasm it used to have.

One day, she sent a very long message. She made a confession. She was married to a seaman, who is a consistent cheater. The moment she met me and cried was the day she found out her hubby cheated again-- this time with a girl from his highschool barkada, a person she knew. Umamin siya na she was a very loyal wife, but wanted to know how it feels to cheat. She wanted to use the experience to try to understand her husband more. To try to know what's going in her husband's mind when he was cheating. 

Unfortunately, it backfired because she was falling. She thought na it was just going to be purely sex, but she appreciated the effort and the presence. 

I was hurt, but for some weird reason, I can't seem to hate her. I told her to sort things out with her husband and that I cannot afford to be the other man.

We stopped chatting for months and then I got a message from her. ""Can you meet me? Urgent lang""

So I did. I was so furious. Heart broken. I almost cried. 

She had a busted lip and a bruise near her right eye. She also revealed bruises in her arms.

She got into a fight with her husband kasi she tried checking his phone and caught him paying for prostitutes dito sa Pinas.

I did not know what to do. Gustuhin ko man siyang kupkupin muna but one thing might lead to another. Hinatid ko muna siya sa province nila in Pampanga.

Ayaw niyang hiwalayan yung asawa niya kasi they have properties together, ang masaklap sa division ng assets, mas lalamang pa yung asawa niya. She wanted to work it out hoping na magbabago pa yung guy.

So many design flaws with her “design”, and it’s infuriating how she could make this new house of hers look builder-grade with the cheap stuff she puts in it:

- Most if not all of her lighting fixtures are from Visual Comfort, a really low quality supplier who dupes high end fixtures. 

- She uses fake antique rugs.

- Actually, most if not every item she has is not an authentic antique.

- Her art is cheap crap.

- Her accessories are CB2, RH, Pottery Barn, etc.

- She spends money on an Hermes pillow and throw but can’t spend on bespoke pillows with contrast welting and tape?!

- She does not know color theory AT ALL. Well, the only color she uses is beige. 

- The furniture plan of what I saw so far is so bad. The pieces are out of scale with the floor space. Her rugs are too small. The clearance between the sofa and coffee table is too big.

- Her window treatments need more attention. What’s up with the tacky blinds and drapery hardware at her old house? I pray that she doesn’t do that to her new house.

It’s such a shame that a beautiful house is not being treated with respect and the caliber of FF&E (Furniture, Fixture, and Equipment) it deserves. She can spend on designer bags, etc, but cannot spend on quality FF&E? Make it make sense!!! Why does someone need a house with that value if you’re just going to put junk in it? Wouldn’t it have been better to purchase a smaller house with less $$$ and then spend money on quality and authentic antiques? 

My guess is that her income is also primarily showing her house and having that shoppe of hers, why does she not invest going to school for it? Even taking a course of history of architecture and interior design so she doesn’t mix up period styles? SO INFURIATING. ",11,1735345564.0,nabelasnark,0,1.0,False

I prefer how walkable downtown is so I've ditched my car and I tend to just walk or take the subway. 

This has caused a bit of an issue with my old friends and we've gradually drifted apart. We call each other regularly but I miss the feeling of just sending a text to a friend and going for a quick coffee or an unplanned beer at the local bar. 

I know it's tough for guys over 30 to meet people because it's awkward as hell. I don't have an issue doing this so much outside of Toronto but this city is full of hermits (myself included)

Women have a much healthier approach to this as telling people you're looking for friends is not seen as some sort of sign of weakness.

Anyways I'm just a normal dude, not an extreme introvert or extrovert. I don't go clubbing or rebuild classical cars or play instruments like every other profile but I'm open minded, well rounded and can strike up a conversation about everything. I'm not out of shape but hardly a body builder so don't be intimidated either way. I'm open to being friends with women too, political views doesn't matter to me too so long as you're not a pushy person.

My bf told me he couldn’t see the stain, that it wasn’t a big deal and that I was being crazy for caring so much about a stupid table. This somehow made me even angrier and I asked him to shut up.
My mom then helped me try to remove the stain with an iron and a wet cloth and it worked a bit but the stain is still visible.

I have tried various amounts of protein and other foods and different times and nothing makes a huge difference. Sometimes a cup of coffee around 3pm helps to give me a boost but other times it just makes me more tired. I occasionally feel like i’ll crash for a couple hours and then get a ‘second wave’ of the effects of the vyvanse but I don’t notice that very often. 

I am not currently approved for dex, I have a copy of my report which asks my gp to apply for approval for vyvanse up to 70mg, and long acting + short acting ritalin if I had a bad reaction to vyvanse. No dex to be seen, I know It can be requested but as we know, it’s a hell of a process. 

I have heard people taking additional doses of vyvanse 4ish hours after their first dose and I am interested to try. I believe it might work for me as my sleep is completely unaffected by the med, I can take 40-50mg vyvanse depending on the day at noon and fall asleep at literally any time afterwards + no other side effects other than loss of appetite and a resting heart rate of about 95pbm which is high for me, but doesn’t come with any physical anxiety. My apple watch just insists on keeping me up to date with my heart rate variation so I know. 

I would love to hear other people’s experience with using more vyvanse as a booster. Is it true that if you take it at the right time (i’m guessing 10mg is an appropriate booster amount?) it can prolong effects of the higher morning dose? 10-20mg does absolutely nothing for me on its own so i’m a bit concerned it will do nothing but make my heart work harder with no pro’s. 

What are your doses? what times do you take them? How do they work for you? Anything is appreciated!! 

(p.s yes I will consult with my dr before anything especially because of the elevated heart rate, just looking for anecdotal advice for now!)

The one hitch is that Reddit sub, private chat channels are still in beta and they do not seem likely to get to my request for setting it up anytime soon. SO. I figured out a workaround . . . 

**Accessing the Speakeasy:**

It \*should\* be that simple (but let me know if it is not). You can still maintain anonymity on there via whatever name you choose to use with your email (e.g. I am still ""Clo"" on substack as I am here). If you are a subscriber, you CAN receive email notifications on when I post my more, longform op-ed type pieces on the substack BUT PLEASE FEEL FREE TO OPT OUT OF EMAIL NOTIFICATIONS. I hate them too and you still should be able to access the RWOB/ SGC private chat without getting emails from me.  

**2. Join the**[ chat](https://substack.com/chat/3588800) **in the speakeasy**!

In the Substack Speakeasy, you can set up separate subthreads/ chats without being a mod so please feel free to set up sub-chats on as many topics you like as the Caroles and Lus get to know one another (just you know, follow the basic rules in terms of not being an asshole, racist, sexist, etc. - just be nice or you'll get kicked out.)

Let me know if you have any questions or tech problems/ issues accessing or any behavior that needs moderating! (SGC is still a work in progress but the chat channel should be ready to go. More details tomorrow but don't worry - this community is still going to thrive here on Reddit. The Speakeasy is just an extra bonus feature.)

Sorry for having so many extra steps to do this but blame Reddit for making having a private chat channel here insanely difficult. I swear, over there, I'll make it nice!

From what I gathered in reviews, it's a good option in its price range.

And no, I wasn't willing to whip out $500 on Italian, industry-grade super-duper espresso machine with milibar precision control. I needed an affordable machine, that will make better coffee than instant black water.

And yes, it has automatic milk frother. I hardly ever drink coffee with milk, and my wife was nagging me, that she doesn't have time to froth the milk separately when getting ready to work. So it was a compromise.

The thing is - I preffer a long drinking session instead of short gulp, so I'm a fan of americano. So what would be the best way to approach it, using this machine? My intuition goes like - make double espresso, throw away the puck and top it off with kettle. But maybe I could get away with running double espresso without portafilter? Just so the water drips down to my cup. Would it be feasible? Or will I break my machine? Or maybe there's some other way I didn't think about?

In comparison to single men, single women are significantly happier with their relationship status. That is, women are far more content with being single or unmarried than men are.  


2. Single Women Have Higher Life Satisfaction

Beyond relationships, single women also have significantly higher life satisfaction than single men do. In terms of overall well-being, it seems that singlehood bodes well for women, but not as much for men.

# 3. Single Women Have Higher Sexual Satisfaction

Perhaps the most surprising finding is that single women are significantly more sexually satisfied than single men are—a result that contradicts prior existing research.

# 4. Single Women Have Lower Desire for a Partner

Another finding that stands out in bright contrast to the “spinster” stereotype is that single women have a lower desire for a partner than single men do. In other words, single men crave a stable relationship far more than women—who may be content to not even try to find one.

My test was at 8:00 AM, and I arrived 25 minutes early. In hindsight, I wish I had arrived even earlier because there was a long line, and by the time I got checked in, it was already around 8:15 AM. The experience was nerve-wracking, especially since I only managed 2–3 hours of sleep. Typically, I get two weeks off during the holidays into the new year, but this week though I am off US hours I had to be on-call for the Australian time zone, covering a week long shift for the team. My on-call duty ended at 1:00 AM for the night, I hit the bed but couldn’t really sleep.

# My Background:

* 18 years in the tech industry right after my bachelor’s degree.
* Started as a tech support professional and transitioned through various roles, including Software Engineer, System Admin, Network Admin, System Engineer, DevOps Engineer, Systems Architect, and now, Site Reliability Engineer Tech Lead at a security company.
* Earned a Master’s degree in Systems Engineering and Information Assurance back in 2014.
* Hold several certifications from AWS, Google, Brocade, Kubernetes, Microsoft, and more. I also completed OSCP pen-testing labs but didn’t sit for the final exam. That was back in 2017-ish.

# Exam Experience:

I was exhausted going into the exam, but I was relieved when it ended at 100 questions. The proctor handed me the paper face down, and I didn’t check it immediately. I walked to my car, unfolded it slowly, and saw “Congratulations.” It was such a relief!

I’ve been preparing on and off for about a year, but family and work commitments made it hard to stay consistent. After returning from a cruise family vacation at the end of November, I buckled down and studied for about 8 hours daily.

# Prep Materials:

* Luke Ahmed videos: Over several months I watched all the videos from Luke when I first started prepping for the test.
* Books: I bought eight books but didn’t read any cover-to-cover. Instead, I referred to specific topics in the index whenever I was confused.
* LearnZapp app: Completed all quizzes and two full practice exams.
* Quantum Exam (QE): Over the last month, I completed 9 full QE exams and numerous practice mode runs. My first QE 100 question exam mode attempt scored 66%, and my last attempt before the actual test scored 88% (done late last night during my on-call shift).
* ChatGpt: I also regularly used ChatGPT for topics that I had confusions about.
* Peter Zerger: Watched the entire 2021 and 2024 video along with other short videos
* Prabh Nair: Watched many Coffee with Prabh's video
* Many more random videos in Udemy, YouTube, etc.

# During the Exam:

Some questions were straightforward and didn’t require much thought, while others were complex, taking several minutes to understand. I was able to answer some questions based on the real world experience as the scenarios were something I had been in or some the techs that I had actually worked with. I aimed to complete 50 questions in the first hour and 100 in two hours. However, I realized I was falling behind when I had only finished 75 questions with less than 55 minutes left. The last 25 questions were shorter/less confusing, allowing me to speed up.

The exam ended at 100 questions with \~ 35 minutes remaining. I wasn’t sure how I did and even started planning for a retake in late January while walking down to to front desk. When I saw the “Congratulations” on the result sheet, it felt like a huge weight lifted off my shoulders.

# Final Thoughts:

For those preparing for the exam, good luck! You’ve got this. Stay consistent, believe in your preparation, and trust the process.",5,1735344660.0,cissp,3,1.0,False
1hnszd7,https://www.reddit.com/r/Gastroparesis/comments/1hnszd7/supplement_fail_how_my_gut_is_healing/,Supplement fail + how my gut is healing,"My dear GP community,
I know we all have GP arising from different root causes and many are suffering. I wanted to share what has been magical for me, thank God. 

First, some background:
I started experiencing GP 10 years ago (at 34). It was acute then. Recently (at 44), it became chronic. 

My theory:
I abused my gut with too much sugar + restaurant food for a looong time. I guess my stomach had to work MUCH harder to break down that food, but I lacked the good bacteria to break it down. I also developed SIBO.

Chronic GP:
I went to a functional medicine practitioner who put me on a bunch of supplements including INTERFASE to kill the biofilm. It put me into a violent detox where I threw up all night. From that point, my GP became chronic. 
I think the Interfase killed EVERYTHING and super stressed my stomach. 

What is working, healing:
Out of desperation, I tried Dr. Mark Hyman's gut healing shake. 
I started with 1/3 portion of powders and have now built up to 1/2 portion. 
VERY IMPORTANT to start small!

I'm 10 days in and I can FEEL my gut healing. 
I can eat a lot more and better. 
I am not in pain, nauseaus or burning with that horrible acid reflux.

Ingredients:
ProbioMax 350 DF,
Vital Proteins Professional Daily Foundation Support collagen,
NuMedica ImmunoG PRP,
Sari Foods Acacia Fiber,
1 small banana, 
almond milk, 
pinch of cocoa powder, 
pinch of coffee powder.
Remember, start w/ small portion!

I also found alkaline water (Body Armor brand) has helped a lot.

Pureeing some low fodmap veggies has helped. 

Mostly the shake every morning has been magical for me. 

It is $$$ but it's better than dropping thousands with doctors (i don't have insurance).

I'm off all supplements except what's in the shake. 
The only one I take every other night is magnesium (to fix my constipation). 

I hope this helps y'all 💜

The food, the drinks, the coffees. Even if it's a restaurant we've been to multiple times or a meal we've had many before. It drives me insane because it's not a quick snapshot either! She starts repositioning things and takes multiple angle shots. One time she suggested I go to the bathroom as ""this will take a while"".

This time, in particular, it really annoyed me. We went shopping and by the end of it we were both quite tired and starving! We hadn't made any reservations (this was our bad), so after waiting for 20 minutes this very busy restaurant kindly managed to squeeze us in. They mentioned we only have an hour for the table as they're super busy! The food ended up taking a long time to arrive, almost half an hour, as understandably they were busy. As soon as the food came she started doing a full on photoshoot of the food. Literally pulling my plate towards her to take pictures and telling me ""no you can wait"" when I mentioned I'm starving and just want to dig in.  ",4,1735344496.0,PetPeeves,6,1.0,False

My husband is a super picky eater and he’s been eating out everyday 3 times a day the last few months due to his mental health and McDonald’s and KFC makes him feel good. We both agreed that it’s not really good for his health or the wallet so I’ve been trying my best to cook food that’s appealing to him. He usually eats a breakfast burger at McDonald’s. I’ve seen him eat Turkish bread rolls with bacon and eggs too. Yesterday we went to Woolies together as he wanted lollies and snacks and I picked out Turkish bread, bacon, spinach and breakfast Patties for breakfast today. At the checkout he said he didn’t want the breakfast items as they were fatty and he’s trying to be healthy. I asked what he was going to eat then and he said he was going to eat rice and egg at home. I said that’s fine just ask the lady at the checkout to take the items as we didn’t pay yet. It was a bit busy and he didn’t want to wait so he said wanted the breakfast items.

I then took the items to make him breakfast as he said he’s hungry. Then he said the bacon I chose was “gross” cause it was maple flavoured. He then made a scene and said he didn’t want breakfast. He said he never wanted it and he’s just eating it cause we bought it. I told him why did you buy it then? I told him if he was upset about throwing it away, I can eat it later and he can just eat McDonald’s. 

He started calling me names and saying I was barking like a dog. I got upset and went upstairs. Then he told me to come back downstairs and finish cooking it. And at this point I was writing this post. And when I came downstairs he said he wanted a divorce so I went back upstairs. Then he said he was sorry so I came back downstairs and he started complaining and saying I never cook for 5 years of our marriage which is why he needs to keep eating McDonald’s. 

Which is completely false. I cook every single day. I used to cook a lot of food for both of us but the last few weeks he didn’t eat any of it and I threw out a whole tray of lasagna because it was “too cheesy” I threw out a whole bowl of spaghetti because it was “not flavourful enough”. I made burrito bowls and he “didn’t like the chicken” I made it again with different spices and he ate it yesterday. I made a whole butterflied grilled chicken with spices, bread, salad which he ate last night too. 

Now he took a photo of my coffee cup right before he yelled at me to make breakfast which I didn’t wash because he was yelling at me. Now he’s yelling at me telling me he wants to divorce and I’m making him go crazy and it’s my fault he takes drugs I’m an AH etc. wth 

And now he’s going to McDonald’s and threw it away. ",11,1735344489.0,AITAH,43,0.79,False

Can folks recommend candles I'd like based on what I like and dont like about the below?

Coffee and whisky: I like it, wish it was more intense in the coffee smell 

Cardamom and vetiver: liked the spice but too musky. 

Champagne Toast:  Wish the tangerine/citrus was more intense but that the candle was less ""perfumey"". There's something artificial that seems a bit floral to me even tho floral not in the notes 

Bright Christmas Morning: I read a review where it was described as ""extreme mid"" and 🤣 yeah. I got the hot pink jar so its working as color therapy for me.  Probably has the maximum amount of sweetness I'd like in a smell

Hey Brisbane crew!

Looking for a social group where the only thing more awkward than your last Zoom call is the conversation starters? Well, you’re in luck! 

We’re a bunch of legends (and a few questionable characters) who meet up to swap bad dad jokes, pretend we know how to do small talk, and work on our collective goal of pretending to be “busy” on the weekend. Whether you're into terrible puns, memes, or just need someone to share your latest “I-shouldn't-have-ordered-that"" meal with, you’ll fit right in!

We meet up regularly for:

- Epic Fail Karaoke (you won’t believe how badly we sing)
- “Who Can Eat the Spiciest Food Without Crying” contests (hint: it's me, but don't tell anyone)
- Random Brisbane adventures that almost always end with us getting lost

If you’ve ever laughed at your own joke just to avoid awkward silence, then you’ll fit in perfectly. Drop a comment, send a message, or just show up — we’re like a bad Netflix series: you don’t need to know the plot to enjoy the chaos.

Let’s get together, share some laughs, and probably embarrass ourselves in public!

P.S. If you bring up pineapple on pizza, expect a 10-minute debate on its merits (and probably a food fight).

Catch you at the next ""accidental"" social gathering!

1hnsnoe,https://www.reddit.com/r/R4R30Plus/comments/1hnsnoe/45_m4f_kansas_city_looking_for_a_partner_in_the/,45 [M4F] #Kansas City - Looking for a partner in the Midwest.,"Hello!

I live in Kansas City, but I've spent most of my life in the NYC metro. I moved here in 2015 for a great job, and I've been here since. I live alone in a nice, modern home in the South Hyde Park area. I love living inside the city and don't see myself living far away from an urban area.

I'm handsome, slim, and in great shape. I have deep, dark eyes and dark hair peppered with greys. I keep my facial hair short and well-groomed. I don't currently have any tattoos or piercings.

I pass regular background checks due to my job so you know I'm not shady. I have no debt or unpaid bills. I'm not addicted to anything. I don't need to be taught basic adult skills like how to care for myself or my home. You won't have to pick up after me or take an overwhelming share of the mental load. I've even kept my plants alive for years! Hopefully, you've got stability and minimal drama in your life. Ideally, you're independent and have a job that you enjoy. 

Politically, I'm a very passionate progressive/liberal. If you have some ""conservative"" values, that may not necessarily be a source of conflict. However, if you're a supporter of the modern Republican party and the MAGA movement, we are not a good fit. I'm not a religious person, but it is okay if you are as long as you can accept that I am not. Lastly, I do not have children and would prefer to date someone without children or whose kids are older and independent.

Except for a fulfilling relationship with a loving partner, I have a happy and comfortable life that doesn't want for anything. I'm capable, confident, independent, and have my life together. I want to meet someone with the intent of developing an enduring relationship. We can proceed at a pace that makes sense for us.

-------------------------
**Some things I enjoy:**

* **Food**: I have a very adventurous palate and love trying new foods. I avoid eating at the same restaurant twice to force myself to broaden my food experiences. If you're a vegan/vegetarian, that's fine! I'm open to the idea of some version of vegetarianism myself. I'm a competent cook, but I don't enjoy cooking. I'd prefer a partner who does. I promise that I'm great at doing the dishes and cleaning up in the kitchen.

* **Fitness**: My health is important, especially as I get older. I exercise regularly and also run. I'd love someone who prioritizes their health and fitness as well.

* **Coffee**: My COVID project was learning to appreciate coffee. My home ""cafe"" looks like a meth lab. I love it. I'll make you a great, fresh cup of pour-over in the morning. 

* **Riding**: I own a modern-retro scooter (a la Vespa) and enjoy riding it around the city. Don't worry, you do not need to get on the scooter if you don't want to. I promise I ride safely and with proper gear, and never speed or get on the highway.

* **Therapy**: I have been seeing a therapist for about half a year, and I'm finding it invaluable. After my previous relationships failed, I felt it was important to work on myself and set up future relationships for success. I think everyone would benefit from therapy at various points in their life.

* **Politics**: I'm a ""political junkie"". I frequently read articles and listen to podcasts. I also have a great deal of interest in the Supreme Court.

* **Movies**: I'm a huge cinephile and enjoy going to the theater. 

* **Music**: I love live music. I'm tolerant of most genres but gravitate towards indie, pop, and EDM. I like discovering new music, so if you want to share something you're vibing to and think I might like it, please share it with me.

* **Gaming**: I love to play board games with a group or my partner. I especially like games that involve some sort of social component and intuition, like The Resistance. Going out for trivia nights at bars is also one of my favorite things to do. I sometimes play single-player video games that allow me to stop at any time.

* **Cleanliness**: I'm probably the tidiest man you'll ever meet. I keep both my home and myself tidy. I'm something of a minimalist as well. I am not a big fan of collecting tons of trinkets and knickknacks and would not do well with a hoarder.

* **Drugs**: I have no dependencies or addictions whatsoever. I only drink socially and in moderation. I don't smoke *anything*, and I don't want to date someone who smokes a lot of anything. It smells gross and makes you taste gross. I sometimes enjoy a low-dose edible or a psychedelic. It's okay with me if you casually enjoy alcohol, marijuana, or ""lighter"" drugs more often than I do. 

* **Traveling**: I'm more of a homebody, but I like road trips. I want to drive across the country in a camper someday. I enjoy hiking and ""glamping"", but don't love prolonged camping. I would be agreeable to traveling far and wide with a partner.

It is perfectly fine if you don't share all my interests. I want you to be your own person with your own passions. As long as we align on our core values and ideals, the rest is not all that important.

------------
Please be serious about meeting in person. I don't want to text endlessly. If you're interested, feel free to reach out to me via chat or Reddit mail (preferred). **Please include a picture of your face with your message and describe yourself physically**. It's not much different than if we were on a dating app. I **will** ask for a picture if you didn't include one to start. Being weird about this would lead me to believe you're not serious and I'll likely move on.

------------
If you're **long-distance** (i.e. more than 2 hours away) and still interested, feel free to message me, but *only if* you're willing to make an actual effort to meet me in person after chatting for a bit. Ideally, you're in a position where you'll be able to relocate to Kansas City to live with me in a hypothetical future in which we're both committed to one another.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Having a bright, white smile is often seen as a sign of health and beauty. You may think that achieving pearly whites requires expensive treatments or harsh chemicals. However, there are some surprising secrets to whiter teeth that you might not know. Here are six effective tips that can help you achieve a brighter smile naturally.

### 1. Baking Soda Magic

Baking soda is a common pantry staple that’s not just for baking. This mild abrasive can help remove surface stains on your teeth. To use it effectively, mix baking soda with a little water to form a paste. Brush your teeth with it a few times a week. Just remember that baking soda can be abrasive if overused, so moderation is key!

### 2. Strawberries for Brightening

You might be surprised to learn that strawberries can contribute to a whiter smile! They contain malic acid, which acts as a natural teeth whitener. To try this, mash a ripe strawberry and mix it with baking soda. Apply the mixture to your teeth and let it sit for about five minutes before rinsing. It’s a delicious way to enhance your oral hygiene routine!

### 3. Coconut Oil Pulling

Coconut oil pulling is an ancient technique that has gained popularity for its potential to whiten teeth and improve oral health. Simply swish a tablespoon of coconut oil in your mouth for 10-15 minutes each morning. This process may help reduce harmful bacteria in your mouth, leading to a brighter smile over time. Plus, it leaves your breath smelling fresh.

### 4. The Power of Pineapple

Did you know that pineapple can naturally help with teeth whitening? It contains bromelain, an enzyme that can help remove stains and plaque from your teeth. Eating fresh pineapple may not only be delicious but can also be a natural remedy for whitening. Just be careful not to overdo it, as too much acidity can harm your enamel.

### 5. Activated Charcoal: Nature’s Cleaner

Activated charcoal has become a buzzword in the beauty and wellness industry. This black powder has adsorbing properties that can trap toxins and stains on your teeth. You can find activated charcoal toothpaste at many health stores. Alternatively, you can sprinkle a bit of activated charcoal powder on your regular toothpaste and brush gently to brighten your smile naturally.

### 6. Stay Hydrated with Water

Water is essential for overall health, but it also plays a crucial role in dental hygiene. Drinking plenty of water helps wash away food particles and bacteria that can lead to staining. Additionally, it maintains saliva production, which is your body’s natural defense against tooth decay and staining. So, keep a water bottle handy and sip throughout the day for a brighter smile.

The Impact of Diet on Tooth Color: Foods That Brighten and Stain Your Smile
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

When it comes to maintaining a bright smile, many people focus on brushing, flossing, and using mouthwash. Yet, your diet plays a crucial role in the color of your teeth. Certain foods can help brighten your smile, while others can lead to unwanted stains. Understanding the impact of diet on tooth color can empower you to make better choices for your oral health.

Check The Details Here: https://prodentim.myofferdeals.com  
  
### Foods That Brighten Your Smile

Some foods are natural allies in the quest for whiter teeth. Including these in your diet can help enhance your smile while promoting overall health.

- **Fruits and Vegetables:** Crunchy fruits and vegetables like apples, carrots, and celery can naturally scrub your teeth. Their high water content helps wash away food particles and bacteria, leading to a cleaner dental surface.
- **Dairy Products:** Cheese, milk, and yogurt are rich in calcium and phosphorus, essential minerals for maintaining enamel health. Consider snacking on cheese to neutralize acids and prevent stains.
- **Berries:** Surprisingly, strawberries and raspberries contain malic acid, which can naturally whiten teeth. When blended with baking soda, they serve as a DIY whitening paste.
- **Crunchy Nuts:** Eating nuts like almonds and walnuts can help remove plaque from teeth due to their rough texture, contributing to a lighter appearance.
- **Green Tea:** This beverage is not only packed with antioxidants but also contains compounds that can reduce the growth of bacteria in your mouth, helping prevent stains.
- **Water:** Staying hydrated clears away food particles and reduces acid buildup in your mouth. Drinking water after meals can help wash away staining substances that linger.

### Foods That Stain Your Teeth

While some foods may brighten your smile, others can cause significant staining over time. Being aware of these culprits can help you make informed dietary choices.

Check The Details Here: https://prodentim.myofferdeals.com  
  
- **Coffee and Tea:** Both beverages contain tannins that can lead to staining. The longer you sip, the more likely they are to leave marks on your teeth.
- **Red Wine:** This popular drink is notorious for its staining properties due to its dark pigments and acidity. Moderation is key if you want to enjoy a glass without harming your smile.
- **Dark Berries:** Berries like blueberries and blackberries are healthy but can stain your teeth if consumed excessively. Enjoy them in moderation and rinse afterward to minimize impact.
- **Soda:** Sweetened soft drinks, especially dark colas, are not only harmful due to their sugar content but also due to their acidity, contributing to enamel erosion and staining.
- **Beetroot:** While rich in nutrients, beetroot can leave behind a pigmented stain that’s tough to remove. Enjoy in moderation or rinse your mouth after consuming.
- **Curries and Sauces:** Strongly pigmented sauces can cling to teeth and cause discoloration. If curry or soy sauce is on the menu, brush your teeth shortly afterward.

### Maintaining a Bright Smile

Your diet can significantly influence the color of your teeth. It's best to focus not only on the foods that can help brighten your smile but also on those that can detract from it. Here are some strategies to maintain a healthy, bright smile:

- **Brush Regularly:** Aim to brush your teeth at least twice a day and after consuming stain-promoting foods to limit discoloration.
- **Use a Straw:** When enjoying beverages known for staining, like coffee and soda, using a straw can help minimize contact with your teeth.
- **Rinse with Water:** After consuming stain-causing foods, rinse your mouth with water to help clear residues.
- **Regular Dental Check-ups:** Professional cleanings can help remove surface stains and keep your teeth healthy.

The link between diet and tooth color is undeniable. By choosing your foods wisely and practicing good oral hygiene, you can maintain a brighter and healthier smile. Remember, small dietary adjustments can lead to big changes in your dental appearance!

Please read it fully and share any advice that might help.

Male, 34 years old, non-smoker, no tea, coffee, or alcohol.

I underwent Nissen fundoplication (360 degree) surgery in 2015. After the surgery, I felt significantly better and was able to live a normal life, only needing medication occasionally when I consumed very spicy or extremely fatty food.

In January 2023, after a heavy meal, I began experiencing persistent heartburn that lasted 24 hours a day. This was accompanied by a sore throat and a change in breath odor. I followed a strict diet, but the symptoms persisted regardless of whether I ate or not, even with the use of proton pump inhibitors (PPI) such as Nexium 40 mg twice daily. These symptoms lasted for two months before gradually improving.

In November 2023, the symptoms returned following another heavy meal. I experienced continuous heartburn throughout the day, despite adhering to a strict diet and taking my medication. I felt slight relief by April, but by June, the symptoms had returned and have persisted since.

The symptoms primarily manifest as a burning sensation in the chest, especially near the heart, lasting throughout the day. The symptoms occur regardless of whether I eat, fast, or drink large amounts of water. They slightly ease after eating but return shortly afterward.

The intensity of the symptoms varies: sometimes the heartburn is very severe (100%), other times it is milder (90% or 80%). On rare days, I do not feel any heartburn, but it usually returns the next day.

I have tried various treatments, including PPI, anti-depressions, and medications for the colon.  Also, I’ve experimented with alternative remedies such as drinking alkaline water, licorice root supplements, pomegranate peels (eaten and boiled), and cucumbers, but none have shown any noticeable improvement.

I sleep in a semi-upright position using four pillows.

**Tests and Results**

1. **3 Endoscopies Results:**

* Grade 1 esophagitis with a mildly irregular Z-line. Otherwise, the findings were normal.

1. **CT Scan Results:**

* In two scans, the wrap appeared above the diaphragm. But in the other one, the wrap appeared below the diaphragm.

1. **Barium Swallow Test Results:**

   * The wrap consistently appeared below the diaphragm.
   * Competent wrap observed, with a slightly slower-than-usual emptying of contrast from the esophagus and mild fullness in the lower esophagus for a short moment.

1. **Manometry Findings:**

   * Tight wrap.
   * Medican IRP: 35 mmHg.
   * 80% of swallows showed failed peristalsis.
   * 20% of swallows showed weak vigor of peristalsis.
   * No hiatus hernia detected monometrically.

**Manometric Conclusion:**

* EGJOO (esophagogastric junction outflow obstruction) associated with moderate IEM (ineffective esophageal motility disorder).

**Consultations with Surgeons**

I recently consulted four surgeons, including the one who performed the initial surgery. The surgeon who operated on me initially explained three options:

1. Continue living with the symptoms while experimenting with medications.
2. re-do surgery to completely undo the wrap.
3. re- do surgery with a partial wrap.

The surgeon noted that there is no guarantee of resolving the heartburn after revision surgery.

The other three surgeons unanimously recommended revision surgery. Given the tight wrap and weak esophageal muscles, they advised revision with a partial wrap instead of a full one. However, none of the surgeons could confirm that the heartburn would resolve after the surgery.

This uncertainty is due to the atypical nature of my symptoms, which appear and disappear unpredictably, making it difficult to pinpoint the exact cause of the issue

For context: My sister, her 3 children, and her ex husband live a few states away from me in Kansas City. My sister (34f) and her ex started dating when I (27f) was 7 years old and he's been my brother as long as I can remember. I moved in with them and their children when I was 15 and I basically helped raised them.
They feel like my own babies and even though they are divorced we're all still close just as we were before, until this lady came around this year.

These are texts between my sister and her children's future step mom. She refuses to meet her, she refuses to speak to me, and she tried to convince my nieces and nephew that I was not important in their lives and they didn't need to speak to me anymore.

My sister moved first, and I became even more involved splitting time with their father so he could still work and provide for them while I did as well. We teamed up and I loved being a part of their lives so closely in this way. They're getting older now, and all 3 of us have such a special bond.

I miss my family! My boyfriend and I have been together for 3 years and we plan to move to Kansas City to be close to them again. She told my oldest niece (15f) she thinks I'm trying to steal her man..... *girl huh???* seriously, what will she do when the kids are going to want to stay the night at aunties more than your own house? 

Since my brother has started dating this girl, he's stopped texting me. I understand people get busy and sometimes I do the same, but it felt odd to me.

I tried to add her on Facebook. She denied my request. On Christmas, I am on the phone with my niece (12f). She falls deeper on the spectrum, and is the most beautiful, innocent, silly smart girl.

His fiancé goes ""who are you talking to?"" And she said ""auntie!!!"" And then she asked my autistic niece ""does auntie want to fight me?"" On CHRISTMAS!!

We are a blended family and we worked until this monster. I hope he breaks up with her.

Imagine if Nike stopped cranking out their millionth running shoe and decided to make steel toe dealer boots. Sounds crazy, right? But think about it—this could be a game-changer.

Picture this: a pair of dealer boots tough enough for the worksite but with Nike’s legendary comfort and innovation. Here’s what we’re talking about:

Zoom Air cushioning: Save your knees and back after 12 hours on your feet.

Lightweight build: Because no one wants to feel like they’re wearing bricks all day.

Slip-on convenience: Perfect for when you’re in a rush to grab a coffee or deal with that one client who always “needs it done yesterday.”

Durability that delivers: Built to handle drops, splinters, and even that rogue nail you didn’t see coming.

Style that works overtime: Tough enough for the site, slick enough for the pub.


Why should the runners get all the attention? We’re the ones busting our backs and keeping the world running. These boots would be our Air Jordans—a symbol of pride and purpose for tradespeople everywhere.

So, Nike, the ball’s in your court. Stop playing it safe with running shoes and step up to the plate. Let’s make steel toe dealer boots the MVP of workwear.

Would you buy a pair of these if Nike made them? Let’s make some noise, Reddit, and maybe—just maybe—we’ll see them on shelves someday.

She cannot possibly, ever recover. There was a potential period of time it could have been treated, but the technology was still in its infancy at the time and we were some poor mobile home park folk from rural Michigan at the time, so we had no access. Both her and my dad were constantly abused as children. My dad is his own kind of weird and messed up but he's, by all accounts, a functional and adjusted human being, and very little of my trauma and life experiences have anything to do with him. My mother, on the other hand, has taken out all of her pain in life on my father and I.  
I currently live at home, because I do not have a car, never learned how to drive due to homeschooling (also, I'm neurodivergent to boot), and I couldn't possibly afford an apartment anyway. I may move to live with my partner next year several states away, since I could definitely split the bill. This would also get me closer to home, as I work for my partner's dad as an intern doing tech work.  
Well, since I live at home still, I cannot escape my mother. I am 21 and still a constant force in my life, which has ironically lead me to great investment in my personal ability to navigate my city, learning bus routes and working remotely at coffee shops and diners for as long as I can before coming home and largely isolating.  
My dad refuses to divorce her, for several reasons, but one of the big ones is this: because of her disability, she cannot hold down a job, and would likely go homeless. She also used to be a drug addict, and while she was hiding this from us, my dad happened to live and work out of state most days of the week, so I was virtually the only person in her vicinity. When she wasn't at home, I was alone (with my extremely disabled, old grandmother) and when she was here, she was asleep, or locked up in the bathroom for hours at a time, or verbally abusing me.  
That's not really the life I live anymore. She's ostensibly been clean for 5 years. We live in a different area. By all accounts, life is much better.  
But it's not - the damage she did to me has forever altered the way I perceive myself and those around me. I'm a self taught software engineer working on an automatic accounting and backup system for firewall configuration modifications, but I feel like I would barely pass the GED if I took it a second time. I understand speech much, much slower than I should, and I regularly have to reread a paragraph over ten times to parse the information contained within.  
The biggest problem of all is that I have no friends in this area, and I have nowhere to go, so when I'm around her, I have two options, which is to try and be a normal person and inevitably be hurt again, by her hypocritic double standards of communication and mental health, or completely stonewall her, act like she does not exist, cut off all contact to a person I see thirty times a day.

I’ve had a crush on one of the barista’s at my local coffee chain since the summer. Anytime I go in, we have such a positive exchange. She is extremely nice to all customers, but she would call me cute and has even blown me kisses. 

In October, we were chatting when she asked if I would want to go to a concert with her. Concerts are my favorite activity, and though I didn’t know the band I enthusiastically agreed. We exchanged numbers to make a plan. 

We started texting, and we exchanged really long messages getting to know each other. She told me about what she’s going to school for, and to check out the band. I told her I listened to the band and was down to see them with her. 

Suddenly, she stopped answering. After 3 days of no reply, I texted again to make a plan for the concert so I could make sure I had work off. It took her a day to reply, and she said she couldn’t go. I said it was all good and to let me know if something changes. She then asked how my day was, I replied, and she never answered again. 

I continued going to this coffee shop, and we continued to have the same positive exchanges. She always complimented me, called me cute, and I would return the compliment. Sometimes we would chat and she would ask what I was up to. 

A few weeks went by and I didn’t see her at the shop. Earlier this week, I finally saw her. We began to chat, and she pointed out we haven’t seen each other in a while. She then said that we should hang out sometime. I said of course, and that I would text her. 

We began texting again, and at first she was answering really fast and asking a lot of questions about what I like to do. We both like thrifting, so we were talking about that. I suggested that we should go thrifting together, and I am on day 3 without a reply. 

I am just really confused and kind of sad honestly. It seems like each time I try to make a plan with her, she ghosts. I’m not even the one suggesting we hang out ever, she is always the one to suggest it first. Why would she suggest it and then ghost? 

I am starting to feel like I completely misinterpreted this entire situation. I am autistic but if someone calls me cute and blows me kisses, is that not flirting? My sisters go to this shop a lot too so they always see her. They say she is always super nice but never see her blowing kisses or anything like that. Was she just suggesting we hangout to be polite and I wasn’t supposed to actually say yes?

She has been the one during the relationship that first asked us to be exclusive and said I love you. 

She is very emotionally strong, something I came to realize too late. At the beginning of the relationship she said that she values her inner peace and does not want drama in relationships. I messed up by starting a few arguments over small things in the month we’ve been together. And her last straw was on Christmas Eve when I got upset at her for going to a party without telling me. (My insecurities really suck! But I’m working on it)

Basically after that she said as much as she loves me she needs to choose herself. I asked her if she will reconsider? She thought about it for a day and told me she is going to stand on her decision. I respected her decision, wished her the best and told her she is an amazing girl because she really is.

The day after that, she reaches out to me first to tell me updates in her life (her getting a job) I congratulated her and told her that some updates in my life ( I landed two 2nd round interviews jobs). I asked her if she will meet up for coffee this weekend, jokingly saying that I could use her advice as she’s a real job-getter. To which she replied “yes if I feel better, I may have caught Covid”.

About two weeks ago (12/13/24), this rash/irritation pattern showed up first on my right hand (dominant hand, the most used at work), and then it started appearing on my left hand. I went to urgent care after it showed up on the left and was prescribed clobetasol propionate, and it worked for the first day or two of application (2-3 times a day as instructed), but now it’s showing back up. It’s not always dry, but I’d say about 45% of the time the red splotches are dry, and become itchy when they are. I don’t use any scented/fragranced lotions and have been still using the prescribed cream as well as aquaphor to help with the dryness. I’m just wondering if this could be a reaction to the gloves I wear at work, a result of debris from breads and other food getting under the gloves and causing skin irritation, or something else all together. It comes and goes with how red the spots get but the general redness without dry patches spreads to right above my thumbs on both hands.

Since then I bought a cheap electric grinder and a milk frother and make a home made cappucino style drink most mornings, although sometimes I drank it black or with a bit of cold almond milk. This all changed Christmas morning when I received an AeroPress.

My first impressions are all positive. My first few brews have been awesome. I really love how smooth, completely free of any bitterness and generally pleasant to drink each cup has been. Reading this sub has already given me some valuable information about, among other things, how to store the equipment properly so I will definitely be reading and maybe contributing in the future.

Since everyone here seems to be into the process what I have done so far is: 15g coffee more or less, ground a bit finer than usual. Since I have only a basic kettle with no temperature reading or control I pour out the water into a pyrex container and let it sit for a minute before brewing. I have tried various amounts of water but around 150 to 200 ml. I give it a quick stir, put the plunger in and let steep for 2 minutes. Finally I plunge as slowly as my patience allows. The last time I added a bit more water between stir and steep. This didn't seem to make any difference. I will probably try the inverted method when I have gained a little more competence since I understand that method makes dumb mistakes potentially a little more serious.  

Again I can't say enough about how good the results are. Not as bold as moka coffee but certainly not weak and very delicious. Its miles better than any filtered coffee I have had before. I am impressed. ",7,1735341919.0,AeroPress,2,0.89,False

1hns017,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1hns017,"Decaf Project cupping - Les Révélations (Paris, France)","**Les Révélations (Paris, France) x Decaf Project**

I waited a couple of weeks so that I could do the cupping with my brother who flew home from abroad for Christmas. It was his first cupping, we both had a lot of fun!

**Beans**

Roasted on 3 December, all decafs were frozen 1 week post roast (10 December), the washed caffeinated one was frozen 3 weeks post roast (24 December)

Judging from all the decafs I’ve had, the beans were roasted medium-light and so were the caffeinated ones.

All decafs looked the same but were different in aspect from the caffeinated ones — respectively, dark and less structure as opposed to lighter, denser and with silver-ish “veins” running through the middle of the beans.

**Cupping parameters**

1zpresso ZP6 grinder set at 5.0 from burr lock (medium coarseness). 1:16.67 ratio, 12 g for 200 mL of water. Custom water recipe with 60 GH / 40 KH, 1:1 ratio of calcium to magnesium.

Boiling water poured onto the grounds, then we waited 4 minutes to break the crust and started tasting at 10 mins, and continued all the way until 30 mins.

**Smell and tasting**

*Washed caffeinated*: fruity fresh aroma with a bit of complexity, which did translate to the cup when drinking it. Nice acidity that lingered quite a bit on the palate. Very little sweetness and it had the lightest body of all the coffees, it tasted too thin to me. The finish was disappointing, the fruity flavor and acidity hit upfront but vanished after a split second. Rated 5.5/10 (my brother didn’t rate it, he didn’t drink much of that one because we cupped late in the evening).

*Ethyl acetate*: Funky fruity fermented aroma that also translated to the cup. Very nice punchy citric acidity, most acidic of of the 4 coffees, that was pleasant — not sour or harsh. A little bit of sweetness compared to the caffeinated one but not much. Definitely more body, smooth and silky upfront and less on the finish, fairly well balanced on that front. The flavor and acidity lingered the longest out of all the coffees. My brother and I both agreed that this was the best coffee, I rated it 8.25/10 and he rated it 8/10.

*Swiss Water Process*: straight up peanut with skin aroma and flavor, a strong one at that, with an earthy undertone. Not roasted / burnt peanut, just a natural one. My brother thought it smelled and tasted like one of his peanut butter flavored whey protein powders and said that it felt like “cheap” peanut flavoring, as in, missing complexity. Less acidic than the EA and the caffeinated coffees but definitely still had some acidity, especially towards the middle of the sip and on the finish. Upfront I noticed the round smooth body and sweetness, it had the heaviest body and sweetest taste of all the coffees. Very pleasant texture but I wasn’t a fan of the aroma. We both rated it 6.5/10, I hesitated to rate it 7/10 though.

*CO2*: cheap instant coffee flavor, ashy, burnt plastic. Very thin body, no acidity at all. It got worse as the coffee cooled down. Just awful, we rated it 2/10 and that feels generous.

**Takeaways**

Overall I was surprised that the caffeinated coffee didn’t come out on top and that the EA took the crown. Maybe resting them 3 weeks before opening the bag was too long, but they definitely weren’t roasted dark so I wouldn’t expect them to lose flavor over that time span?

The EA decaf was the best, I’d definitely drink it again. The SWP was decent, very pleasantly sweet and smooth but I wasn’t a fan of the peanut flavor though some people might enjoy it. As for the supercritical CO2, it was garbage, reminded me of the last time I tried Nescafé instant coffee.

This was a super interesting experiment! Big shoutout to Les Révélations who is the only French decaf only specialty coffee roaster, I’m glad that they took part in the project.",3,1735341834.0,pourover,0,1.0,False

When it happened, I posted here. This sub helped me get through that. Now that a year has passed, I thought I could give a bit of an update to help people who are either in the process of leaving, but more importantly, the ones who have and what to do next.

This is me:  
[https://www.reddit.com/r/BPDlovedones/comments/18kz79p/my\_wife\_killed\_herself/](https://www.reddit.com/r/BPDlovedones/comments/18kz79p/my_wife_killed_herself/)

And this is me:  
[https://www.reddit.com/r/BPDlovedones/comments/18ls6o1/holy\_shit\_i\_admit\_defeat\_you\_were\_all\_correct/](https://www.reddit.com/r/BPDlovedones/comments/18ls6o1/holy_shit_i_admit_defeat_you_were_all_correct/)

Some background. I was married to my pwBPD for about 5 years. The last year was the worst thing ever. She was originally from the other side of the world. We were visiting her family. She hung herself in front of me while there. Not faking it, really hung herself. However, she did it knowing I'd stop her—which I did. That was where things had escalated to by that point. Her attempts to control me through suicide threats had turned into attempts for full on manipulative control.

After that, I was able to inform her parents, through extreme translation difficulty, of what was happening. I left their country and returned home. I told her I wanted a divorce. A couple weeks later, she arrives unannounced, I tell my brother, he calls the cops, she has an episode, won't let go of me, I get covered in scratches prying her off, cops arrive, see scratches, and they arrest and charge her with assault. The next day, she flew back to her parents on the other side of the world.

Two weeks later, she calls me claiming she had a miscarriage. At this point, she had been using her mom's email to communicate with me but posing as her mother. Her mother does not speak English, so everything was coming in after passing through a translation app. Anyway, she claims she had a miscarriage and the looming assault charge is too much to handle. She starts freaking out on the phone. I can't take it because my entire nervous system is just totally fried by this point. I ask her to stop, she doesn't. I hang up the phone. 1.5 hours later, I get an email from her mom saying her daughter is dying, and no response. The following day I get an email with her suicide note and her ""mother"" proceeds to blame me for her death.

I posted here. I was rightfully warned that this could be a hoax. I couldn't bring myself to believe that since it made me immediately hate her which I couldn't do because I believed she was actually gone. But like Jesus, she rises from the dead 3 days later. I also post about that here, and I shut everything down.

I thought I got a clean cut from this. I thought I mourned the woman I thought she was but that this event showed me the woman she truly was. In my mind, the woman who lived was never the woman I thought died. I then picked up my entire life, changed all of my contact information, and moved. I went no contact and tried to start over.

Turns out, that's not how things work in the real world. Apparently, trauma is a real thing. Who could have guessed? Also, it turns out watching your wife hang herself after years of BPD abuse and then faking her suicide while her family blames you for it will also cause significant psychological harm, whether you want it to or not. See, I didn't think it did. I was convinced I was totally fine. That is, until all of the symptoms began to appear.

It was probably around month 5 or so that the first major thing started. Anything that was feel good or warm hearted, usually YouTube commercials, would just kick my ass emotionally. Not for long, though. I likened them to emotional sneezes. I'd be watching the commercial, waiting to press skip, and then all of these emotions would well up within me super quick. It would rapidly climax with me essentially about to cry, maybe cry a bit, and then it was gone. It never lasted longer than 4 seconds total. It was very much like a sneeze. I didn't understand this at all.

This went on for another month. I had already stopped seeing my therapist prior to this because I really did not like the idea of being considered a victim. I was beginning to speak a lot with ChatGPT, though, since I could do that whenever I wanted, and for as long as I wanted. Eventually, I discovered that I had a bit of lingering pain from the relationship. It seemed that I never got to mourn the good times, so, I spent like an hour that weekend thinking about it which trigger a ton of crying. I thought that was it, and was on my way.

That wasn't it.

During all of this, I had these clients from hell for a project I was working on. Technically, they weren't clients for this project, but they liked to act as if they were. Remember how I didn't want to believe I was a victim? Well, I also didn't want to believe I was weak. I definitely didn't think I might be a people pleaser. Most of all, you couldn't have convinced me in a thousand years that I had my own fear of abandonment. So, I've got these ""clients"" from hell that I'm bending over backwards to please so they don't leave us while allowing them to just trample over all of my boundaries so I don't look weak—and I begin to get this strange surging feeling up and down my spine.

We're now about 8 or so months after the big event. I start seeing this person in my apartment all the time. We run into each other in the elevator and we chat. About a week later, she puts a note on my door giving me her number if I ever want to grab a coffee or walk my dog together. I personally wasn't really thinking all that much about dating, but after those first few walks, I was convinced this one was worth pursuing. We had tons in common. It was almost like I had known her my entire life—which was strange because I didn't know her. What was more strange is that I knew I didn't know her yet this sensation persisted.

Right before that first walk, I had a major breakthrough with my own process of all this trauma stuff. I had been doing a writing process at home where I just keep writing until I find something painful. Then, I dive deep into it until I expose the fear/pain and set myself free. The day before she put that note on my door was the day I discovered my own fear of abandonment. That was a difficult night of reliving childhood trauma alone, but after, I thought that was it, and was on my way.

That wasn't it.

It only took about a week after that note for my mind to completely turn on me. Turns out, I was not only traumatized by everything that took place with my ex, I was—and still likely am—extremely fucking traumatized. I am so traumatized that the episodes of trauma I began to experience gave me what felt like an inside look directly into the mind of what someone with BPD experiences.

I've never had a trauma episode before. My ""fear of abandonment"" manifested into adulthood as a feeling of ""not being good enough"" or a disbelief that people really did like me. Either way, note goes on door, girl and I go for walks, trauma shows up, and I proceed to completely make a mess out of everything. I think this may give us some insight into what happens to people with BPD, because the shit I was doing reminded me exactly of my ex.

First, my mind literally became possessed. It was the strangest thing that's ever happened to me. Luckily, I'm into some weird fringe occult stuff, so I had been exploring the relationship between ideas, concepts, and reality already. Those ""clients"" of mine were basically like mental demons in my head already. Their chronic nagging and boundary pushing in real life had taken on a life of its own in my head when they weren't there. I was essentially pushing myself with this internally held belief that I'd let them down or whatever other gaslighting bullshit they convinced me of, or that I internalized myself as fear motivation. Either way, I had recognized that these ideas of them were attaching to the real identity of them, but that it couldn't really be them. Well, that's what happened with the note girl as well.

The trauma took her identity, created this surrogate of her within my mind, and proceeded to attach every unresolved fear I had from my previous relationship to it. Again, thank fucking God, I had just recently seen my mind do this with the ""clients"" so I was able to at least recognize that something was horribly wrong with me. I called it the surrogate mind demon. I think the clinical term is limerence, but I like mine better.

What then proceeds over the next month is me trying to reconcile this involuntary, compulsive, idealistic version of ""her"" in my mind with the reality of her. The only problem was, she had her own stuff she was dealing with and stopped following through on plans to meet up. She kept saying, over and over again, she'd love to go for a walk and couldn't wait and all that. Then, it would never actually take place. Meanwhile, my mind kept going fucking nuts creating more and more of these hyper idealized fantasies using every trick in the book to try and get me to believe them. It was the most insane thing, literally insane—like crazy person insane—thing I have ever experienced. I've had close to 100 breakthrough DMT trips, to put that into perspective.

So, I'm trying my absolute best to remain cool while this is going down. I know I need to speak to the real her, in person, in order to show my mind that the idea it's constructed of her isn't real, but she won't. Now, I'll never be able to do this justice, but I'll try. It wasn't just that I was getting caught up in day dreams or anything. I was being pulled into these intense fantasies and held prisoner in them. At times, I couldn't even snap back into reality. I'd be held there. They weren't unpleasant. They also weren't like hyper sexualized in any way at all. In fact, it was the cheesiest shit ever.

I could be sitting on my couch and all of a sudden, I'd be in this day dream. It would be this archetype of myself as some hopeless romantic and the surrogate mind demon. We'd be walking in some hyper cheesy romantic situation only a 12 year old could imagine. It was like that, non-stop, but with every single emotion being produced as strong as possible. The hardest part about this was not that it was intrusive, involuntary, or compulsive, it was that the emotions were installing real memories in my mind.

As this continued, I began to notice a pattern. That surging feeling that had appeared in my spine, that was trauma. I kept doing my writing and kept finding more and more childhood and ex-wife abuse trauma. Every time I'd be hyperventilating on my floor in the fetal position crying for a couple hours, the surging feeling would go away. A few days later, it would return. It also seemed to always coincide with some kind of interaction with the real note girl. Whether I saw her down the street or a text or whatever. It always triggered another trauma episode.

80 days. I went through this for 80 days straight. Almost every single night, I was relentlessly diving into my mind, alone, digging out every ounce of trauma I could possibly find. Some nights I'd spend up to 7 hours doing this. I was totally mad, like nuts. I was laser focused to rid myself of this surrogate mind demon, whatever the fuck it was.

Finally, I was setting up a time to hang out with the note girl. I was convinced this was going to finally be when I could reconcile the real person with the false identity my trauma was haunting me with. Nope. She was super busy at work and didn't respond all day to her text. I couldn't for the life of me understand why this was so brutally painful. Then I discovered it. When my wife faked her suicide, and I believed she was actually dead, I spent my nights texting her phone number begging her to come back to life. Meanwhile, she was actually just reading them in real-time, but I thought she was dead. So, waiting on a text was transporting me directly back to that excruciating moment, and it was the most brutal feeling ever.

I explained this to the note girl. I made it clear it wasn't her fault, but I was obviously in no position to be waiting on messages regardless. She explained how she was busy at work, which I believed and is totally justified. We continued talking and it sort of made it seem like we'd still meet up. We didn't, and the trauma got worse and worse.

I ended up writing a 3 page letter. Yes, I know. What a terrible idea. Not only do I now know it was a terrible idea, I knew it in the moment. I couldn't stop myself, though. Simultaneously, I knew it was the worst idea I ever had, and I knew all the reasons why, but I was also being manically driven by the trauma to explain everything. So, I explained everything and taped it to her door now making me crazy note boy.

That went over just about as well as you'd expect. It went over just as well as I expected it to also. She kindly suggested we stop speaking to each other.

If I thought the surrogate mind demon stuff was bad, this was worse. I couldn't fathom how I let myself do that. In fact, I didn't let myself at all. I wasn't even in control. It was terrifying. I was totally sober as well and had been for many months at this point. It was like I was overtaken by something else and forced to do an act that I was actively resisting. It was terrifying to say the least. I had never lost control like that before in such a lucid state.

Luckily, I'm pretty hardcore when it comes to these things. I used my writing process to attack this from every angle imaginable. I eventually discovered why I wrote that note. More importantly, I discovered why I stayed in that relationship with my ex-wife in the first place—and those ""clients"" of mine.

Remember how I said I didn't want to be appear like a victim or weak? It turns out that the ego, or your internal sense of self, the idea you have of who you are whether or not you're aware of it, is very sensitive. When it gets threatened, it goes into overdrive. For the 5 years of my marriage, I had been tormented by my ex where she constantly used this aspect of myself against me. She knew I wouldn't give up. She also knew I had a sacrificial reflex because I didn't think I was weak, so I could ""take it"" to save her.

That pesky fear of abandonment of mine had manifested into this idea that I wasn't really worthy of being liked. It didn't matter that I had tons of incredibly interesting and successful friends from all over the place, that feeling persisted without me ever really knowing. That caused external validation seeking and taking on the feelings of other as my own responsibility. This is where the sacrificial reflex came in. I'd sacrifice myself for others thinking that would prove my worthiness so that they'd like me.

Up until my ex, this wasn't terrible out of whack. I think most people are like this in one way or another. With my ex though, her BPD just exacerbated these symptoms during the relationship. Talk about feeling unworthy and unliked when your subconscious believes your wife killed herself because of you! Not a great feeling.

So, here I am now trying to understand what's happening to me because of this new scenario. I literally did not process a single aspect of what happened with my ex until that note appeared on my door. All the shit from my ex was coming back up but in my mind attaching to this new person. Like, the feeling of not deserving the treatment I received would attach to the idea of not deserving to be lead on or even ghosted. Shit like that that I was non-stop trying to catch myself on, but I wasn't even in control of it. That's what culminated in me finally sending that note.

My ego, fueled by trauma, needed to project its sense of identity. I was not a victim. I was not weak. I am a victim of circumstance only, and that is not who I am. I explained it all. I told her how her note, while it was one of the better things that had happened in my life recently, totally fucked me up. I explained how I thought she was hoping I'd be this great guy for her, but I couldn't show up like that since I'm brutally traumatized. I explained that while I did like hanging out with her, she never did give me the opportunity to get to know her. I also went on to say that the only thing I've been trying to do is literally get to know the real her since I seemed to like the idea of her.

In traumatic mania theory, this was a great idea. In practice, not. Regardless, it gave me the insight necessary to know why this happened. I believe this is what happens to the pwBPD. So, now I'll explain that and what I had to do in order to defeat this—which I did. I destroyed that fucking surrogate mind demon.

I no longer believe that the pwBPD has no sense of self or even a weak sense of self. I think it's wildly the opposite. I think they have a strict and complete sense of self. See, it was my internal belief structure, the idea of who I am, my identity, that was threatened. It was threatened because it did not align with my external reality. The external was not reflecting my internal back to me. This was happening in every area of my life.

Previously, when people and things did not reflect back the idea of who I was, I would just move on or maybe get drunk. I might just push myself harder with the idea that the future would reflect it. I think that's the default state for most people. This was different because what took place now was this new massive fear that if the external didn't reflect my internal, another person was going to die. Now, my ex never did die, but don't tell my subconscious that!

That brutal traumatic event kicked the craziest mental defense mechanism into action. Not only was everything already out of my control. I didn't make my ex hang herself. I didn't make her fake her suicide. I didn't create the trauma. I didn't put a note on my door. I didn't become a surrogate mind demon. Now, I was also not the one who was actively writing notes to protect a sense of self that I didn't even create. A total fucking loss of control, or rather, a complete exposure that I never had control.

Do you know what my initial instinct was when this happened? My instinct was to try and regain as much control as possible. Sounds familiar, right? Do you know what I actually did? Not what the pwBPD does. I surrendered entirely.

See, I think the pwBPD actually has a very well defined sense of self. I think it's child-like for sure, but it's very clearly defined. I think it's a stupid sense of self that is idealized based on perfection, but a very complete sense of self regardless. I think their episodes are a direct result of what I experienced myself.

I was lucky because I'm into crazy weird fringe occult shit. I've also had, like I said, close to 100 breakthrough DMT trips. My mind is my playground. So, when it begins acting in a way I'm not familiar with, I don't just go with the flow, I enter into hardcore introspective mode. Not only that, I've spent years researching how to deconstruct the ego and experience no-self. All accounts of people who have done this are always of a totally calm and peaceful place. It's never what you see with a pwBPD—who is said to have no sense of self.

I think what's actually happening to them is their sense of self isn't being reflected externally. It can't because they need to have this perfect idealized idea of who they are or they're worthy of being abandoned. When it gets threatened, their ego and fear kicks into overdrive and takes the wheel. I think this is what makes them do crazy shit. It's also why they're almost in a daze afterwards as if they didn't know what happened. It can explain splitting as well. When I was in that note writing place. I was totally convinced this was the greatest idea ever, yet I was still lucid enough to know it was actually a terrible one. We still see what action won in my situation, regardless of my ability to know the difference. I had a framework to work within of not being brutally traumatized, they don't.

The craziest part about all of this, and it's really far deeper and more complex than I've written here, is that I had no clue about any of this until I directly confronted it. If it wasn't for that brutally uncomfortable surging up my spine, I wouldn't know there was more trauma. Where there was more trauma, that meant more work to be done. Each step forced me to relive an aspect of my past, like legit re-embody who I was at that time, even as a child, and relive it. Then it would die, which felt like I was dying, but then I was reborn only to do it again and again and again.

There are still lingering effects today. I'm about 90+ days since that note triggered the trauma resurgence, so it hasn't really been that long since the trauma symptoms stopped. What a God damned nightmare this past year has been lol. Anyway, I know this post is long and a bit scrambled, but I did want to share this insight. I'm writing this in a much more in-depth format that I may post here when it's done, or a link to it since it'll probably end up being a book. Either way, the purpose I wanted to express is that there's an insane amount of internal trauma we're all living with that needs to be processed after the separation with the pwBPD.

I am absolutely convinced that we all have similar pieces of trauma in us. That's why we even stick it out with them in the first place. 80 days of brutal processing may seem long, but that's less than 3 months. I touched on all the nightmare shit here, but the reality is, I've purged all of my fear. I'm like an entirely new form of being now. I don't even need to worry about setting boundaries since I can't help myself but strictly enforce them. Where I was so worried about others first before, not today. Not only that, it's like effortless.

Having processed all the pain and side effects of seeing the exact part of myself that allowed it to happen. Bringing it to light destroyed that part of me. It's impossible for it to hurt me anymore, and with that, the weird little things that kept me stuck in other situations are gone. I mean, I have burned down almost everything in my life since this, but that really was only because almost everything in my life was me being a people pleaser, seeking external validation, sacrificing myself for others to like me, and really just being stuck because I wasn't upholding my boundaries. I burned all that away as a result and for once in my life, I feel free.",10,1735341200.0,BPDlovedones,2,0.92,False

Anyway. I'm 18, pretty active in my University and have many useful connections. I don't have any bad habits or addictions (maybe coffee, but that's not nearly as dangerous as drugs, alcohol and alike). My problem is that I can't take my connections any further than just ""acquaintance"". I'm followed and surrounded by many (I'm a junior leader of a local youth movement on my faculty), yet I'm so utterly useless and pathetic that I just can't find anything to start a general friendly conversation or even small talk. When I get too nerdy, people just turn and leave, and my interests are too specific to not sound nerdy or weird

I can't find partner or even a female friend. Every women that is even slightly of my type is already dating with someone. I have a friend with advantages, but she isn't ready to go further than erotic playfullness because she too is in a relationship, which ends up just scratching my moral wounds. And any other free girl is just.. boring. It feels like god, if it exists, just dumped all the one-sided and plain females in my area

I'm bad even at my education. I am a very active volunteer and often skip University to go on events. I'm on brink of being expelled from my University, which was my one and only chance of fixing my social life. I really don't want to return to my hometown, because my potential there just withers away (all my friends said that I changed a lot, in a positive sense, because of moving elsewhere, so I don't want those changes to be in vain)

I honestly don't understand how's a socially awkward guy supposed to find a partner. I'm lonely while being surrounded by people.. fate is truly ironic, heh. This honestly just makes me desperate for any physical attention from anyone. I feel like if someone takes even a slightest interest in me, I'd latch onto that person with my whole self. And this makes me even more scared, because I fear laying any unfounded hopes, destined to be betrayed

My biggest fear is that I won't achieve anything in my student life. Six months passed, yet I failed my education already, I have tons of acquaintances, merely about two or three friends (not a group. They don't even know eachother) and zero potential partners. I begin to stop believing that ""everyone deserves to find a close one""..

There’s so much I want to say, but time has grown scarce; I can feel it slipping away. My health is failing quickly, and it’s not by accident.

You deserve to know, Drea, that the reason for my failing health is Vivian—your mother. I wanted so badly for our marriage to work, wanted to share everything with her. But she only cared about my fortune, and she’s gone to great lengths to secure it for herself.

My estate belongs solely to you and Adrian. I wanted to make this clear in a will, but I never expected time to run out this way. I’ve long suspected Vivian was tainting my drinks, but today, I’m certain. She brought me coffee not long ago, and there, faintly on the cup’s rim, were traces of a familiar poison. I could call the police or rush to the hospital, but instead, I choose to write to you now, hoping you find this someday, hidden here in your nursery.

If things go as I hope, David may look after you, maybe even adopt you, though he doesn’t know of you yet. If not, I pray Adrian finds you and keeps you safe. I believe you’ll grow into a remarkable woman, strong and resilient, Drea. Know that I loved you fiercely. Please tell Adrian that despite his anger over my choices, I’m deeply sorry and that I love him as well.

I love you both,

\~Emerson Grant""

The letter slipped from Drea’s trembling fingers, her legs giving way. Sorin quickly wrapped an arm around her shoulders, holding her upright as she crumpled into his side.

Tears blurred her vision, and through them, she looked up at Sorin, whose expression held a quiet grief. Though he was only a child back then, his affection for his uncle had been real.

She managed to choke out, “W-what does this mean?”

""Shh,"" Sorin soothed her, bending to pick up the letter and carefully slipping it into her book. “Not here, not now. Let’s get home, then we can talk.”

She nodded, her lips trembling as tears spilled over. Sorin gently wiped them away, wrapped an arm around her waist, and guided her out of the room. They descended the stairs quietly, moving toward the exit.

Just as they reached the door, her mother’s shrill voice called after them, “Leaving already? You haven’t stayed for lunch.”

Sorin’s jaw clenched tightly. Murderous woman, he thought, before turning to face her with a forced smile. “I’d rather have lunch alone with my wife. Thanks.” With that, he steered Drea out the door.

Once they were safely away, he pulled the car to a stop by the side of the road, dropping his head against the steering wheel. “Damn it, damn it, damn it.”

A soft touch settled over his hand, gripping the wheel tightly. Lifting his head, he found Drea’s gaze, shimmering with unshed tears as she tried to hold them back.

“D-do you… think this could really be true?” Her voice trembled with uncertainty.

He reached for the book and retrieved the letter, directing her gaze to its signature. “Look, he signed it. If we can track down some old documents he might’ve signed, we’ll have proof.” He paused, deep in thought. “Dad must have something lying around.” A loud groan escaped him as he pinched the bridge of his nose, tears gathering in his eyes. “Why did my uncle have to be so reckless? He could’ve at least confided in my father and asked for his help! Damn it!”

Drea intertwined her fingers with his, offering a comforting squeeze. “We… we don’t really know what was going on back then…”

A sob erupted from him. “I loved him so much, Drea. I don’t remember everything, but I know I did. To learn he met such a tragic end…”

Leaning forward, Drea rested her forehead against his bicep, weeping alongside him. He lowered his chin onto her head, tears streaming down his cheeks as they sought solace in one another’s embrace.

After several moments, he wiped his eyes and said, “Call Adrian. Tell him to meet us at home.”

Drea nodded as Sorin drove away. When they arrived, Adrian sat at the dining table, his head bowed and hands gripping his hair in despair, the letter sprawled before him.

Taking a seat beside him, Drea wrapped her arm around him, offering comfort while Sorin stood back, his mind racing as he contemplated their next steps. Grief could wait; justice for his uncle was their immediate priority, and Sorin vowed he wouldn’t rest until it was served.

Suddenly, Adrian shot up from his seat, his eyes bloodshot and wild. He pulled out his pistol from the holster at his waist, making Drea gasp softly in shock.

“That’s it! That woman is going to pay today. I’ve tolerated her long enough!” He growled, striding toward the door. Drea grasped his wrist, desperately trying to halt him.

“Adrian, no!”

Hey there, friend! So, you’re feeling a bit tired of the usual niceties and want to explore a not-so-gentle side of humor in life? That’s totally understandable! Sometimes, we just need a good laugh and a little sass to lighten the mood. So, if you’re ready to embrace your inner “Legendary Asshole” (all in good fun, of course!), here are 25 funny ways to do just that. Remember, it’s all about having a playful attitude! 

1. **Social Media Shenanigans**: Post over-the-top inspirational quotes like, “If you can’t handle me at my worst, you don't deserve me at my best.” It’s a great way to get some laughs (and eye-rolls) from friends!

2. **Master the “Reply All”**: You got an email meant for just a few? Use “Reply All” to share your life story! Your coworkers will definitely remember that one.

3. **Subtle Bragging**: Casually drop in conversation that you “saved a small country” when really, you just made pancakes for your pancake-loving neighbor.

4. **Disappearing Act**: Mid-conversation, you could suddenly declare you’ve “gotta go.” Imagine the looks on their faces—classic!

5. **Dramatic Sighs**: Whenever someone asks how you are, just let out an exasperated sigh like you’re carrying the weight of the world. It's funny and relatable!

6. **Pun Overload**: Kick off conversations with terrible puns that make everyone groan. “Are we at the zoo? Because you’re a total ‘bear’-y wonderful friend!” (Okay, maybe don’t try this one.)

7. **Creative Mispronunciations**: Feel free to totally mangle the names of common things. Calling a “horse” a “four-legged ground mammal” adds a nice comedic twist!

8. **Foodie Frenzy**: Start every meal with, “Do you even know where this avocado came from?” The look on their faces will be priceless!

9. **DIY Disaster Tips**: Share ridiculous DIY hacks like “Use empty toilet paper rolls for decoration!” It’s sure to inspire some good-natured confusion.

10. **Competitive Complaining**: When someone shares their struggles, find a way to one-up them. “Oh, that’s nothing! I once spilled coffee... on my other cup!” We all have that friend who does this, right?

11. **Texting Games**: Text “Hey, you busy?” then leave them hanging. Just imagine them wondering what went wrong—it’s all in good humor!

12. **Comical Tone Shifts**: Adjust your tone dramatically while in a loud setting. It’ll make the conversation wildly entertaining as everyone tries to follow along!

13. **Meme Madness**: Send unexpected memes at the most random times, as if they hold the secrets to life. They’ll laugh, even if they’re confused.

14. **Over-the-Top Enthusiasm**: Get overly excited about mundane things. “Did you see that the parking lot has more spaces available today?” It’s silly but endearing!

15. **Joking with Intent**: Take a sentence your friend says and twist it into an absurd joke. “When you said you love apples, did you mean you love picking them?” 

16. **Parking Mastery**: Show off your unique parking skills by taking up way too much space. Imagine how folks will react!

17. **Victim Card Veteran**: When someone asks how your day was, dramatically state, “I’m just trying to survive!” It’s humorously relatable.

18. **Humblebrag Time**: Sprinkle compliments about yourself within praises of others. “You know, my success really comes from my undeniable charm!”

19. **Outrageous Tales**: Share an exaggerated “fact” like, “I just bought a castle in the clouds!” The laughter that follows will be unforgettable!

20. **Absurd Nicknames**: Give everyone wacky nicknames based on the tiniest quirks. “Good morning, Furry Sneaker Enthusiast!”

21. **Invitations Gone Wild**: Invite everyone to a two-person hangout, then act like you didn’t expect anyone to show up!

22. **Mystery Meetings**: Schedule meetings but send a meme instead. “Sorry, got lost in cat memes!” Your friends will either laugh or question your sanity.

23. **Feedback Overload**: Offer unsolicited critiques about the smallest details. “Your shoes are nice! But did you consider neon colors?”

24. **Horribly Epic Stories**: Share overly long tales with no clear point. Everyone will be side-eyeing you, but it could bring some laughs!

25. **Comedic Enthusiasm**: Make a list of your “achievements” in life, like finishing your coffee in under 10 minutes. There’s that subtle brag coming back!

**In Closing:**
Remember, the journey to Legendary Asshole status is all about lighthearted fun. It’s okay to embrace a little sass here and there, but always keep a sense of kindness at the core (most of the time)! So go ahead and let your inner comedian shine—your friends just might appreciate it (or roll their eyes with a chuckle!). Life is too short not to have a little fun! 😂💖 #LegendaryAsshole #GoodVibesOnly #HumorMatters",1,1735340253.0,theassholeclub,0,1.0,False

I found a shortcut on iOS called ""Split Image Equally,"" and I use that to make individual image tiles that I import into the Freeform app. I can them move them around as I like to get all four categories ready for entry.

Yes, it takes longer to set it all up than if you didn't do that at all, but it takes much less time to find the answers now, so I'm actually spending less time at this.

Query blurb: 

Seventeen-year-old self-admitted loser Lorcan is not having a good time. He's just flunked his senior year, had his heart stomped on by his crush, and his family acts like he's invisible. Worse, spending his summer on a remote island off the coast of Newfoundland is starting to feel more like a punishment than a vacation – until he meets Sam.

With his startling good looks and irresistible charisma, Sam pulls Lorcan in like a tide, making him feel seen for the first time in his life. When Lorcan accidentally witnesses the horrific abuse Sam suffers at the hands of the islanders, Sam makes a shocking confession: he's a selkie – seals that shed their coats once every seven years to become beautiful humans on land. Captured by a power-hungry fisherman after the island was nearly devastated by overfishing, Sam is now forced by brutal means to lure fish into the islander's nets. 

Lorcan vows to help Sam find his stolen coat before the fish inevitably run out and Sam is killed. But as the summer fades and Sam's need to return to the sea grows, Lorcan faces a heart-wrenching realization: freeing the boy he loves may mean losing him forever.

TW: some spice (YA appropriate), mention of SA (nothing explicit/off page), smoking, drinking, swearing, physical and mental abuse 
 
Opening: 

*God, I don’t want to be here.*

I mean, I really, *really* don’t want to be here.

All around me, tourists in rain slickers swarm the ferry’s deck. They jostle against the railing, their *ooh*s and *ahh*s punctured by the clicking of cameras, the razor-throated shriek of seabirds.

 Apparently, coughing up eighty bucks to gawk at a floating chunk of ice the size of a mini mall is a thing. Who knew?

And then there’s this shrill, orgasmic cry of, *“Oh my God! A seal!”* and all these tourists, these happy, wholesome families with their fanny packs and their little plastic baggies full of ten-dollar-a-pound organic trail mix go rushing over, eager to catch a glimpse of something they’d only ever seen on TV. A petite blonde woman clutching a glittery pink Starbucks thermos in one hand and this year’s iPhone in the other shoves me, linebacker style, into the metal staircase leading to the upper deck. Her kids, a boy and a girl with iPhones of their own, plus a selfie stick each, race after her.

I don’t get it, any of it, and I’m not about to try to, either.

 The only person I can confidently say is about as unimpressed as I am is my sister, Neeghan. She stands by the lifeboats, her curly hair twisted into this giant knot-bun-thing that bobs back and forth with each shuddering heave of the ferry. Thirteen years of ballet have made her feet permanently splayed, her balance impeccable. She's nursing her second - no, third - cup of burned coffee and glaring at her phone. The whole time her greasy, gloss-smeared lips are moving, muttering, swearing.     

 No service out here.

This isn’t so much of a problem for me as it is for Neeghan, but that’s mostly because she's got something I don’t – a life. And friends. *Plural.* I’ll be the first to admit that my previous summer plans of getting high and playing video games in my best friend Trev’s basement must seem embarrassingly lame compared to Neeghan’s packed schedule of tanning, shopping, and partying. So while the thought of us now spending our entire summer vacation exiled to some island off the coast of Newfoundland has me less than thrilled, Neeghan can really only be described as completely, utterly devastated. In a nutshell. 

And if you think I’m being dramatic here, all I can say is, *‘I wish.’*

A burst of braying laughter erupts from the upper deck. Grizzled men dressed head to toe in bad weather gear – toques, parkas, waders, the works – leer down at us, snickering at our mallrat jeans and selfie sticks, our brand name thermoses and expensive smartphones. We hadn’t been on board five minutes and I’d overheard one of them feeding some slack-jawed kid a bunch of B.S. about the waters between St. John’s and Miquelon being ‘infested with sea serpents.’ And ‘merrows’ – whatever those are. 

“My grandfadder'd say they was bad luck, merrows,” the man bellowed over the hissing waves, loud enough for half the ferry to hear. “Swore he saw one offa La Manche right ‘afore the great August Gale of ‘35. Out in his skiff, trolling for mackerel, he was when he spied ‘er perched on a rock, guttin’ pilchards. Hair like sea wrack and a face ugly as sin. Not half so pretty as their cousins, the seal folk.” He gave a churlish wink, pausing long enough to ogle Neeghan over the butt of his Pall Mall. “Or that pretty young maid over there.” 

Neeghan is, technically speaking, my younger sister, having been born a whole eight and a half minutes after me. And though we might share the same red hair, blue eyes, and metric shit ton of freckles, we couldn’t be more different if we tried. Case in point: people actually *notice* Neeghan. 

She doesn’t look up from her phone as a young towheaded boy sporting a hot chocolate mustache and a Mickey Mouse rain poncho comes barreling up beside her and stabs a peanut salt-dusted finger toward the roiling gray water below. “Look! Look!” 

Sure enough, gliding in and out of the ferry’s foaming wake is another seal. Black-eyed, gray-furred, sleek. Boring. Trust me, you’ve seen one seal, you’ve pretty much seen them all. 

Just as quickly as it appeared, it slips beneath the waves again. Gone. The kid is losing his shit, the parents are leaning over the railing, camera phones whipped out, practically begging for it to resurface so they’ll have something to brag about to Aunt Karen back home. 

The stink of sweat and screech smudging into fish guts fills my nose. 

“Think it was one of the seal folk, mainlander?” 
The BS-slinging fisherman from earlier stands at my elbow, the corners of his mouth wrenched into the gap-toothed grin of someone Not All There.

I mumble, “Dunno. Maybe,” like I know what a ‘seal folk’ is. 

“Oh, yar.” The man nods, turkey neck pleating like an accordion. “Hard to tell when they’re in the water, but you see a seal maid on land…ah.” His bloodshot eyes dance. “You’ll know it, me old son.” 

I respond to this the same way I respond to crazy people who corner me on the subway to rant about mind control drugs in the water: I give him an awkward thumbs up.  

He motions to Neeghan with his cigarette stump. “That your sister there?”

*Unfortunately.*

 “Yeah.”

 “Hope she don’t run into one of the lads, eh? Buncha tomcats, the lads, I tells ya. My mam’d say pity the poor lass who falls fer a –”

 “It’s back! It’s back!” the towheaded boy shouts, jumping up and down like he’s about to pee his pants.

Taking advantage of this little distraction, I turn my back on Crazy Fisherman Dude and look toward the jagged hump of fog-wreathed coastline ahead. Everything considered, seals aren’t exactly at the top of my Shit Lorcan Gives A Shit About list.

***

By the time the ferry groans into the harbor, it’s started to rain. Drops needle my face, gather in the hood of my jacket, trickle down my neck. The air is so thick it’s like a solid thing, heavy with the scent of pine and woodsmoke, salt and sea damp. Waves slam against rocks, explode in white spray. Gulls squabble and mewl overhead. My sneakers, now soaked through, squelch down the clanking gangway. 

At the bottom, a hatchet-faced young man wearing a dinky captain’s hat and yellow oilskins says, “Have a pleasant stay,” with his words and *‘It’s your funeral,’* with his eyes. His icy expression, shoulder-length copper-colored hair, and that barbed scar slashed across his cheek make him look like a B-list movie villain. Pinned to the breast of his oilskin is a cheap plastic name tag molded into the shape of a smiling cartoon seal. It reads, *Tommy.*

     Next to me, Neeghan shivers, grumbles, “I thought it was supposed to be *June.”*

Hi everyone,

Over the past four months, I’ve been developing the last version of **Quantum**, a cutting-edge tool designed as a powerful alternative to Vercel. **Quantum** enables seamless and secure continuous deployment for your GitHub repositories, while also allowing you to effortlessly deploy and configure Docker containers.

The best part? **Quantum is self-hosted**. You can easily install it on your VPS using its intuitive installer or simply with a Docker Compose file.

One of the standout features is the **""One Click Services""**: applications you can deploy literally with a single click. These include:

* **Essential tools** like Ollama, Uptime Kuma, and Code Server.
* **Content management systems** such as WordPress.
* **Popular databases**: Redis, MongoDB, MariaDB, MySQL, and PostgreSQL.
* **Renowned low-code and self-hosted platforms**: Directus, Appsmith, ownCloud, ActivePieces, n8n, Tooljet, and more.

My goal with Quantum is to simplify deployments and make self-hosting as approachable as possible while empowering you to do more.

I’d love to hear your thoughts and feedback—it would mean the world to me! You can check out the repository here:

1hnr8hd,https://www.reddit.com/r/Ozempic/comments/1hnr8hd/thoughts_on_day_2/,Thoughts on Day 2,"There may be other posts like this but I thought I'd record my experience here. I've gained 40 pounds in 12 months and I'm sick of how I look, so I decided to jump on the wagon. I've been on Zoloft and Abilify, which are known to make people ravenously hungry all the time and have problems controlling when to stop eating food.

I took my first shot (0.25) yesterday around 1 pm. I felt nothing the first day, the same as always. Then I woke up this morning and I was not hungry. I had coffee with a splash of milk and went off to work. Usually, when I have no breakfast, my stomach is gnawing in hunger by 10:30 am. Well, 10:30 rolls around and I am not that hungry. I wait until noon, it's now my usual lunchtime. I looked at what I brought to work; none of it was appetizing besides a chocolate protein shake. Every other day I would scarf down the whole thing and look at my empty plate willing for more food to magically appear.  Now it's almost 6 pm and I just got home and I am feeling hungry. By now I would have ordered takeout and called it a day. Instead, I disinterestedly look at my refrigerator and take out some leftovers. I look at them on the counter and go, ""Hmm, nah"". I put it back and drink I drink a tiny bottle of kefir. As I am writing this I am amazed at how I feel. Food is not an all-consuming thought that persists the whole day.
