1j6ch48,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1j6ch48,Waves Coffee North Vancouver (Mountain Highway) - $6.99,"New addition to the app, and I was excited to snag one of these bags because Waves has some great food. Ordered a “large” surprise bag for $6.99 (there is also a “small” for $4.99), and got a ham and cheese sandwich and a chicken curry wrap. Retail value of the two sandwiches is $24.10 so it does meet the minimum $21 stated value, but I guess I was expecting to see 3-4 items in something described as a “large” bag? 

I’m not a huge fan of premade sandwiches because I’m picky about the condiments. Luckily my kids were happy to eat them, so it wasn’t a waste of money. 

Description on the app said, “Enjoy a delicious mix of fresh, high-quality food at a great price! Each bag may include a variety of baked goods, sandwiches, wraps, or snacks, plus a freshly made drink when available.” It was not at all busy when I did my pickup, so I thought I might be offered a coffee or tea along with my bag, but nope. 

I might give this another try with a “small” bag, hoping it might include muffins or pastries. Spending $7 for two sandwiches that I’d never otherwise buy is silly.

I live with my best friend, Aaron. We’ve been roommates for two years, and despite our occasional arguments over dirty dishes and stolen WiFi, we get along fine. Or at least, we did—until I found him dead in his room.

I didn’t even mean to walk in. His door was slightly open, and I just happened to glance inside while passing by. That’s when I saw him.

Aaron was sprawled across his bed, one leg bent at an awkward angle, his arm dangling off the edge. His face was pale—no, not just pale—grey. His eyes were half-open, glassy, unfocused. His lips were cracked and tight, pulled back slightly from his teeth. It looked like he had been dead for hours. Maybe even a day.

The air in the room was thick. Rotten. Like something wet and meaty left out in the sun too long. I gagged immediately, slapping a hand over my nose.

My brain stuttered, trying to process what the fuck I was seeing. Aaron’s dead. I’m looking at his corpse.

And then—

My phone buzzed in my pocket.

I jumped so hard I nearly tripped over my own feet. My hands were shaking as I pulled it out.

It was a text. From Aaron.

Aaron: Hey man, can you grab some eggs on your way home?

I stared at the screen. The room felt like it was closing in around me.

Aaron’s fucking dead.

My eyes flicked back to the bed. His body was still there. Still unmoving. Still bloated and starting to fucking stink.

Another message came in.

Aaron: Dude? You good?

My stomach twisted. My pulse slammed against my skull. This wasn’t happening. This couldn’t be happening.

I forced my legs to move, stumbling backward out of the room. I slammed the door shut behind me, my breath coming in ragged gasps.

This isn’t real.

But the smell. The fucking smell.

I nearly threw up right there in the hallway. My phone buzzed again.

Aaron: You’re acting weird. Just answer me, man.

I turned and ran.

⸻

I didn’t sleep that night. Every time I closed my eyes, I saw him. Saw his stiff, twisted body. Saw those half-lidded eyes staring at nothing.

And yet—

My phone kept buzzing.

Aaron: Why are you ignoring me?
Aaron: C’mon man, this isn’t funny.
Aaron: If you’re mad, just say it.

I turned my phone off. I couldn’t fucking deal with this.

But I could still hear it.

A buzzing sound. A notification ping.

My phone was off. But the messages kept coming.

Somewhere around 3 AM, I heard it.

A creak.

A slow, deliberate shift of weight.

Coming from his room.

I lay in bed, frozen, my breath locked in my throat. He’s dead. He’s fucking dead.

Another creak. This time, it was closer to the door.

And then—

A soft tap tap tap against my wall.

Right next to my fucking head.

I didn’t sleep.

⸻

By the next morning, I had a plan.

I was going to call the cops. Report a fucking corpse.

I made coffee, hands still shaking, stomach twisted in knots. The apartment smelled worse now—like the stench had soaked into the walls, into my fucking skin.

And then I heard something that nearly made my heart stop.

The sound of the shower running.

I turned the corner slowly, like if I moved too fast, I’d shatter reality itself.

The bathroom door was shut. Steam curled out from underneath.

And then—I heard humming.

Aaron. Humming.

I took a step forward, pulse pounding in my ears.

“Aaron?” My voice cracked.

The humming stopped.

For a long, horrible second, there was nothing. Just the sound of the water running.

And then—

Aaron: Yeah?

I turned. Bolted for the front door.

I was halfway out when my phone buzzed in my pocket. I didn’t want to look. But I had to look.

A text. From Aaron.

Aaron: Where are you going?

I ran.

⸻

I stayed at a motel that night. I didn’t care how much it cost. I locked the door, put a chair against it, and kept every light on.

At 2:47 AM, my phone buzzed again.

I almost didn’t check. But something in me—a deep, gnawing dread—forced me to look.

Aaron: You can’t ignore me forever.

I swallowed hard. My fingers trembled over the screen.

And then, another text came in. This one with an image attachment.

I shouldn’t have opened it.

I know I shouldn’t have opened it.

But I did.

The picture was dark, grainy, like it had been taken in a dimly lit room. But I recognized it immediately.

It was my fucking motel room.

A photo taken from just outside the window.

I turned immediately, my heart seizing in my chest. I threw open the curtains—

Nothing.

Just darkness. An empty parking lot.

And then—

A knock at the door.

I couldn’t breathe.

Another knock.

Then—

A text.

Aaron: Open the door, man.

No fucking way. No fucking way.

I backed away, my entire body trembling. I could hear something now—something wet. Something breathing.

I pressed my back against the far wall.

Another knock. Harder this time.

Aaron: I know you’re in there.

And then—

The door handle started to turn.

I don’t know what happens next. I don’t know if I’ll make it.

But if you’re reading this—if you ever find yourself in this situation—don’t fucking answer the door.",4,1741419762.0,nosleep,3,0.83,False

https://preview.redd.it/4h5ky3742fne1.jpg?width=1200&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=8e8bffe57444c90e38dfda894be3ae5de6b1897e

Stevia Rebaudiana has become widely popular as a natural sugar substitute. Found natively in South America, this plant is recognized for its unusually sweet leaves, which are the foundation of most stevia sweeteners. If you are health-conscious or want to cut back on your sugar intake, natural stevia might just be the way to go. In this extensive guide, we will discuss all there is to know about Stevia Rebaudiana—its origin, to its health advantages and useful applications.

# What is Stevia Rebaudiana?

Stevia Rebaudiana belongs to the herb family Asteraceae, which includes the sunflower and the daisy too. It is grown commercially for the leaves that are sweet in taste, and the leaves are filled with compounds known as steviol glycosides. These are the compounds that make it so sweet, estimated to be 200 to 300 times sweeter than regular sugar.

Unlike artificial sweeteners, natural stevia is directly obtained from plant sources and thus is the more desirable option for individuals seeking a natural alternative to sugar.

# A Brief History of Stevia Rebaudiana

Stevia was employed for centuries by the Paraguayan and Brazilian Guaraní, who referred to it as ""kaa he-he,"" or ""sweet herb."" They utilized it to sweeten drinks and as medicine for many diseases.

In the 20th century, stevia sugar gained global popularity. Stevia was used as a sweetener by Japan, among other nations, to replace sugar during the 1970s, and this led to stevia beginning large-scale commercial production. It has since entered large-scale production in Asia, South America, and even Europe.

# How is Stevia Rebaudiana Processed?

https://preview.redd.it/mjlsllwq2fne1.jpg?width=1201&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=c16277901a0979d76d4b92adde970459c9969abc

Stevia sweeteners are processed in a multi-stage process:



Harvesting: Stevia Rebaudiana leaves are gathered when at peak sweetness.

Drying: Stevia leaves are dried cautiously in order to maintain their natural sweetness.

Extraction: Water or alcohol-based extraction processes isolate steviol glycosides from the plant.

Purification: The extract is further purified in order to remove bitterness without affecting the natural sweetness.

Spray Drying: The stevia purified liquid extract is transformed into a fine powder in dry form through spray drying technology. This maintains the stability and concentration of stevia in its final powdered form.

Final Processing: Stevia is processed into powders, liquids, or granules based on the nature and purpose. The steviol glycoside concentration is what provides the sweetness and taste of stevia. The higher the steviol glycoside concentration, the sweeter and more pure the resultant product.

# Nutritional Benefits of Stevia Rebaudiana

[Stevia is calorie-free](https://zindagistevia.com/?v=f9f0a42f293e) and carbohydrate-free compared to normal sugar and is, therefore, ideal for individuals aiming to lose weight or regulate blood sugar levels. Among its essential health benefits are:

Regulates Blood Sugar: Stevia does not affect blood glucose peaks and is therefore suitable for people suffering from diabetes. It may also improve sensitivity to insulin.

Helps in Weight Control: With no calories, stevia is a perfect sugar substitute for those who want to lose weight.

Facilitates Oral Wellness: Stevia is not capable of causing dental cavities and tooth decay compared to refined sugar, thus facilitating oral wellness when used for tooth care.

Rich in Antioxidants: Stevia leaves have antioxidant chemicals that could potentially fight oxidative stress and enhance overall well-being.

# Different Forms of Stevia Sweetener

applications:

I do pretty well financially (cleared $240k pretax last year), which makes it difficult to consider a move to another field and starting at the bottom. My coworkers call it the golden handcuffs. 

I generally enjoy my job, however there are a few things eating away at me, making me miserable. The hours are long (12-14 hours a day, 5-6 days a week) and the customer surveys that affect 30% of my pay.

I worked the bar and was still continually getting orders, stopped in the middle of existing orders to alter new ones, responded to customers who wanted to get their drinks to go,  and so on. This one lady was particularly demanding and asked for a bunch of additions to her drinks that would normally cost 1-3 dollars each. I did them for free because why not- but she kept making more and more requests even though I was in the middle of other drinks. It was near the end of my shift and my responses to her became more curt and colder. Even after doing all this free stuff for her, she still came up to me and rather than asking for me to fill up her to-go cup, accused me of doing something wrong because it wasn't full (in our store the policy is if a customer asks for less ice in a latte or coffee, it doesn't mean more drink because it can mess up the flavor profile- unless the customer specifically asks) 

I was so sick and tired of her that I just explained to her why we do this instead of offering to fill it up for her. That was incredibly petty, but by then I just wanted to be left alone. I feel guilty when I react this way and nearing the end of my shift sometimes I can't act sweet anymore. The feeling carried and I snapped at another customer who got mad at me that the bathrooms were closed for cleaning even though I wasn't responsible for the cleaning schedule of the bathroom. I was again very cold with her and even though I got her into the bathroom, I could not continue being smiley and had a bitter tone in my ""you're welcome"" and so on.

How do you deal with the guilt? I want to be kind to everyone and obviously, these people don't know that I have 50 other tasks or that I am behind on preclose and can't prioritize them immediately. That's part of the behind-the-scenes magic. And how do you release your temper so it doesn't seep into your service?

1j6bnxy,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortstories/comments/1j6bnxy/mf_routine_maintenance/,[MF] Routine Maintenance,"12:47 AM

The Gas ’N’ Go had never been a peaceful place.

Even at its quietest, there was always a hum of something beneath the surface—the flickering lights, the machines struggling to live, the constant background radiation of wrongness…

Tonight, the store was quiet.

But not in the usual way.

Not like a pause before something happened.

More like… something had already changed.

Tina noticed it first.

Not the lights. Not the air. Not the way the coffee machine had brewed without its usual sputtering death rattle.

It was the raccoon, Todd.

Or rather, the absence of Todd.

He was always somewhere—perched on the register, rifling through candy, lurking in the shadows like some tiny, sentient omen of chaos.

But not tonight.

Tina scanned the aisles. No sign of him.

She frowned. “Where’s—”

Then the door opened.

And three men walked in.


---

1:10 AM

The men moved in a way that didn’t seem to take up space.

Not in a supernatural way—nothing about them flickered or glitched or bent reality.

They just existed too cleanly.

Their gray coveralls were spotless. Their boots made no sound against the tile. They carried clipboards, toolbags, and nothing resembling humanity.

They didn’t acknowledge Barry.

They didn’t acknowledge Tina.

They simply… began.

One adjusted a shelf that had never been misaligned.

Another measured the width of an aisle.

The third ran a hand along the counter, fingers pressing against the surface as if checking for something beneath the laminate.

He clicked his pen. Made a note.

Barry watched.

Smiling, but not in the way that meant he was amused.

In the way that meant he was calculating.


---

1:45 AM

One of the workers adjusted a security camera.

Not fixing it. Not testing it.

Just turning it slightly, centering the angles, eliminating the store’s natural blind spots.

Another painted over a scuff on the wall.

Tina stared.

She was almost certain that hadn’t been there before.

And yet, it had been covered.

“What exactly are you fixing?” she asked.

The worker paused.

Then, too evenly, he said:

“Routine maintenance.”

Tina crossed her arms. “Yeah? Routine for who?”

The worker clicked his pen.

Did not respond.

Did not look at her.

Just walked away.

Barry’s fingers drummed against the counter.

One. Two. Three.


---

2:00 AM

Tina’s unease had been growing.

Not because of the workers—she hated them, sure, but she could hate a lot of things at once.

But because Todd was still missing.

She scanned the aisles again.

Nothing.

Not on the shelves.

Not under the counter.

Not even his usual lurking spots.

She turned to Barry.

“…Where’s Todd?”

Barry didn’t answer.

Which meant he had already noticed.

Which meant it was intentional.

Tina swallowed.

Todd wasn’t just missing.

Todd was avoiding them.


---

2:30 AM

One of the workers pulled out a clipboard.

Barry’s gaze sharpened.

He stepped forward.

And in a voice too calm, he asked:

“What’s next on your list?”

The worker hesitated.

A fraction of a second too long.

Then, in a voice that didn’t quite belong to him, he muttered:

“Staff updates pending.”

Tina’s breath caught.

The air around them shifted.

Like pressure had been added—not enough to be oppressive, but enough to be noticed.

Barry’s fingers tapped once against the counter.

And for a split second—

The store glitched.

A flicker.

A breath.

The worker’s pupils dilated.

Then, stiffly, he turned and walked away.

Barry watched him go.

And smiled.


---

3:12 AM

The workers finished their corrections.

They packed up their tools.

One, without a word, walked to the glass door.

Took out a sticker.

Pressed it neatly onto the inside of the glass.

Tina squinted.

She stepped forward.

Read it.

Three words.

“UNDER NEW MANAGEMENT.”

Barry’s hand brushed over the lettering.

The moment he touched it—

The store flickered.

Not the lights.

Everything.

For just a second, the Gas ’N’ Go adjusted.

Like something underneath had moved.

Like the store itself was breathing differently.

Barry’s fingers curled slightly.

Tina watched him carefully.

“…Barry?”

Barry did not answer.

His smile had disappeared completely.


---

3:30 AM

The moment the workers were gone—

The aisles shifted back.

The coffee machine sputtered once.

The neon sign outside flickered.

The hum of the coolers fell slightly out of sync.

The store had been holding its breath.

And now?

Now it wasn’t.

Barry ran his fingers over the sticker again.

It did not peel.

It did not budge.

Tina stepped up beside him.

“So what the hell does this mean?”

Barry took a slow sip of coffee.

And finally, he said:

“It means they aren’t done.”


---

3:45 AM

Tina scanned the aisles one last time.

Still no Todd.

Still no sign of him.

And somehow, that bothered her more than the workers ever did.

Because Todd wasn’t just gone.

He had chosen not to be seen.

And if Todd—who had stolen, fought, and defied the fabric of reality itself—had decided to stay hidden?

Then whatever just happened was bigger than Barry.

Tina tightened her grip on her coffee cup.

“I need to find a new job.”

Barry, still watching the door, murmured:

“So do they.”

The store hummed.

For context; I work as a barista, it’s right next to a couple of food spots so a lot of the workers come grab coffee beforehand. This one girl; I’ll call her Lucy, really friendly and we always had really good conversation. She works right across from me and one day she asked for my Snapchat so we could hangout sometime; I gave it to her ( I know what you’re thinking, but I’m moving soon and since we clicked I felt like it would be okay to kick it a few times) 
A little context on me; I (F21- in 5 days🥳) recently got out of an abusive relationship this previous year, i was in it for 2 years and it completely shattered all my personality. Since being out of that I’ve really tried to regain my peace, go forth in life and heal from it; and just return back to myself once again, hence the moving soon. I also had to have major back surgery right after getting out of it; just today getting out of my back brace and getting clearance to start stretching. 

Actual story of what took place; Lucy and I decided tonight that we would hangout, she came over and we decided to go shopping and grab food. Prior to leaving my place her man starts blowing up her phone. I let her know that she can feel free to answer him, and not to worry about me being beside her. She answered briefly and all I heard was him get to arguing, which prompted her to hang up and say she wasn’t dealing with it, which I get. Fast forward we’re in the car, her man starts calling again- she again says (because we’re in his car) that she’s just going to let it ring because “he can’t do anything anyways” and “he’ll end up being all lovey dovey to me later”. We continue to shop and mind you I’m grabbing some things I like as it’s my birthday soon so I’m treating myself one might say. After all that we grab food, and while we’re sitting waiting inside for her food, some dude comes up to her briefly whispers something In her ear and storms off. The initial reaction I had was who tf was that, he came in hot and left out of there quick too, so naturally I go stand beside her and ask what’s happening. 
As we’re sitting there waiting; dude comes up behind me and very rudely states “I don’t know who you are but if you got shit in my car get it the fucc out”, so instantly I’m like wait huh? (More context; I sold my car prior to surgery, was a shitbox and it wouldn’t have sat thru winter) I’m like so yeah I don’t have a fuccen ride? All he says is “that ain’t my problem just get your shit”, cool; now it’s my problem. I get my stuff out the car and the whole time he is mean mugging tf outta me; I look back at him and just dead stare cause really, you’re a grown man leaving a lady stranded; much less YOUR lady’s friend? Weird and lame, especially looking at me like I’m at all the problem. 
Anyways, I grab my big ahh bags, and head back into the restaurant; I go to her and I’m like “wtf is happening, he just said I had to get my stuff and get out? now I don’t have a ride” all she says is “I’m not sure what’s happening”, so I ask her “did he take your keys?” And she replies saying that she still had them and laughed saying “it’s his car of course he has his own set of keys”. I go set my stuff down at the table, she comes over and I’m like “so what’s going on?” Meanwhile he starts to honk from outside since he sees she paid and came over to me; she just says “I’ll text you”. 

Im frustrated as ever, and honestly I felt so weird having that happen. Like, I literally left the toxicity for a reason, I gained peace for a reason, just for me to still have the same things happen to me that were happening then because OTHER PEOPLE are in a toxic relationship? She’s older than me, so I feel like it’s rude to say but I am honestly way to grown to be dealing with that, and I feel as though I have to do it (cut her off) BECAUSE I’ve had such shitty boundaries with people in the past. I mean, is it truly validated? I feel as though I did my part in letting her know she could handle it and talk to him, even telling her “don’t let what you do here affect what you go home to, just answer him” but again I ended up dealing with aftermath, not even an offer to uber me home, or an apology. On one hand, I feel really bad; if she truly is in a toxic/ controlling relationship, I know how lonely and depressing it can be; even though as he was calling she said “I’m not in an abusive relationship or anything” (weird, I don’t see many people in healthy ones having to reassure people like that) . On the other hand, I can’t jeopardize myself like that again, it’s cold outside and realistically after rushing to get my bags out and bending, im in pain. I know it sounds stupid af; but that is only the tip of the iceberg in my already deteriorating health, which could be due to my previous experiences, but I have to prioritize myself. 

I’m sorry if this was a ramble! It quite literally just happened and I’m debating how to word the text/ if the text is validated.

Now, let me preface this by saying, I’ve already asked her out. It was months ago and basically what happened was that I asked her out and she said “maybe.” She then went on to tell me that she had just gotten out of a relationship (at the time I didn’t realize the break up was so fresh) and wasn’t ready for another one, so she said maybe and we left it at that. 

Since then, not a lot has happened. I mean, I’m not avoiding her and she’s not avoiding me, things didn’t become uncomfortable after I asked her out - they basically went back to normal. I haven’t brought it up again and I don’t try to bother her outside of work (with texts and things like that) and basically I try not to put pressure on her because I don’t want to make her uncomfortable and I want to give her space. Also, I’m not sure if she’s interested in me. BUT I have noticed that whenever I say something flirty to her she kind of lights up and smiles real big and generally seems like she enjoys it. Like, if I’m complimenting her or playfully teasing her she doesn’t seem to be put off by it. 

I know she could just be being nice to me and playing along, but I’m not sure. The reason I’m not sure is because one of my coworkers keeps telling me that I need to forget about her and that she doesn’t see me in that way. 

I’m also thinking that maybe she doesn’t realize that I’m flirting with her and thinks that I’m just being nice?? 

The thing is though, that there’s been many times where I’ve said something that (in my eyes) was obviously flirtatious and she just lights up. Like calling her pretty or cute or saying she has a nice smile or playfully teasing her about the way she does things. There’s also been times where it’s seemed like she was flirting with ME. She’s told me I have a nice smile, playfully teased me A LOT, and even shown me her silly faces and then said, “this is a once in a lifetime thing that not everybody gets to see,” (lol idk but it’s really cute). I mean, that’s kinda flirting, right? Am I delusional?

Anyways, the reason I’m on here looking for help is because I might be leaving the company soon and I was thinking that on my last day or something I could say something like “if you ever change your mind about getting that coffee or hanging out, you have my number,” and just leave it up to her?

I've always wanted to have a coffee machine. A few days ago, I found one on the street where I live. It's quite common here for people to donate their belongings by leaving them on the street for others to take. So, I picked up this coffee machine.

It works perfectly fine, but unfortunately, it's quite dirty, unhygienic, and full of limescale. Because of that, I’d really like to clean it thoroughly and maybe give it a second life.

Do you have any suggestions on how to remove all that limescale? And in your opinion, is it even possible to clean it properly? The machine works without any issues.

I will be completely honest in this post and some people may not like my past but it’s understandable I’ve grown.

My parents (F41 M49) have always had a rocky relationships rightfully so. I gave them a bad go of it from the ages of 12-15. Stealing money, sneaking out, in trouble with the law, lying, attitude. Unruly teenage stuff.

My Mom and I especially never saw eye to eye on a lot of things especially as I got older. And part of me was recognizing I was getting older but I also get she wanted structure. She would make me clean everything in the house when I lived with them. Pick up groceries, get her coffee from coffee places because she didn’t want to lift a finger. 

Even though I also worked full time like my parents. They didn’t see it that way. I’d even try to talk to them about it and they would say (at the time) “Oh come you work retail grow a spine” even though I’d work 10am-9pm 5 days a week. Which was a lot and going to school full time. That was there rules.

When I began to argue and start putting my foot down she started charging me 500 dollars a month rent to show me what’s what. Idk where that money went, she never gave it back to me like most parents do. And my mom and dad are upper middle class so idk what they did with it honestly. Their mortgage was 1100 for example so I paid a little less than half of that for a year or so.

As time went on, and we began to clash and I felt as if I had to lie to her about small things, since, it’s not an excuse really cuz lying isn’t good, my parents need everything their way or the highway. EVERYTHING or they’d berate me by calling me idiot, stupid, moron, etc. She’d end up kicking me out in May of last year.

I was actually happy, maybe that would fix my relationship right?

Wrong.

It got worse. Every decision I made or goal I had for the future was looked down upon or classified as “BS” and a “pipe dream” and they didn’t want to hear my goals for the next year or so. Called me an idiot for getting an apartment that costs 1547 a month when in this economy that’s decent. Would judge what I spent money on sometimes.

And more recently I’ve found Faith in God and Christianity and I’ve been better. Back i December I quit my job no notice due to my bad mental health and lack of care from my job, and felt like I had to LIE to my own parents because of straight up worry about what they would say with no backup plans they thought I had a job until I came clean that I didn’t start one until Monday this week. 

She told me she’s taking me off her phone plan, health insurance car insurance and I was like ok, sounds good I want to be more independent.

But my Mom is also not a good person. She lies about finances and gets mad when she’s caught. For example she’s been overcharging me on my phone portion by 80 dollars a month for 3 years after deciphering the bill, and 20 dollars a month for my car insurance. When I confronted her with the bills at her house she got mad and told me I needed to go home.

Again. I am not perfect, none of us humans are. But I feel as when time goes on; and I notice my mistake (although I need to stop lying about stupid small stuff), my mom holds grudges from 7 years ago and uses that against me why she can’t trust me even though I’m a million times better.

Another thing is with my paychecks not lining up, I owed her 548 this month for two months worth of payments. But I told her I needed to focus on a place to live. And she said she didn’t care I should have “thought of that earlier”. Again I know I shouldn’t be late on bills but I learned my lesson. My own mother would rather she get paid even if I were to lose my apartment .

Anyway.

I just need thoughts on this situation. I’ve been told by my sisters and friends and ofc my faith in God, that I need to step back and work on myself get back on my feet and most likely not talk to my parents anymore for the time being.

Again, before anyone comments. I know I’ve got stuff to work on but I’m not the sole reason for this bad relationship.",1,1741416935.0,Advice,0,1.0,False

I was in the 

Car. 



ill never forget seeing my mother.



Dead



Cold



Lifeless



It is like looking into the very visage of terror



This trauma seeps through my veins, leaking horridly from my pores. 



The car was a honda and the cruise control failed, i think.



The police said, “sorry kid, but your mother is a \[redacted\]” i couldnt believe my \[redacted\] it was so awful i lowkey started tearing up a little bit seriously, this shit is too much for even a real g like me. 



Ever since the crash, i keep seeing a doll. It is scary. And sorta badly made, almost like the person who made it was…. My…. dad…..



THE END

  
  


PS: next month, i saw something even worse. 



Later, I was at school, when,,,, fire alarm



It was so loud



Then, when i was asked out by my girlfriend. she 



Cheated



Now, with all the pieces in play. We can finally get to the story. I know that these all seems disjointed however,, they are all crucial to understanding my plight.

  


I’ll never forget what I saw on March 19th. I woke up in a cold sweat, my stress leaked down my body as I heaved each breath in and out of my core. I had that dream again. 



Every night since the crash I would have a recurring dream. My therapist explains this to me as trauma, however I know my reality. On that day something happened that cannot be explained. This unknown has eaten away at me from day to night to day to night. I can’t fucking explain it. I see someone behind her in the dream. It lives in cold dark shadow with one single peering eye looking deep into my core. Well, I cannot explain it but it almost looks through me, as if something else within me has caught its attention.



There is something living inside me.



That is my truth. I am not one man but a conglomerate of ailing agony. Whatever it is, has found itself nestled within the wrinkles of my mind, eating away at whatever remains of myself. 



I must get it out. 



I remember everything so vividly from that day. My mother picked me up from high school as usual, with that same cheery expression she always did. I hate her for that. She only could muster that joy when I resented it. I was a teenager. I was stupid, so now instead of that smile, my image of her is her in the crash. She was twisted into a horrid visage. It’s funny, the wounds she endured stretched her face into a smile not dissimilar to the one she made that day. She was not laughing anymore though. She screamed, and then she cried, and then she just breathed. When they pulled me out, I demanded to be there when she passed, I believed it to be unfair she would die alone. She did.



My father did not take it well,or at least, he took as well as a 50 year old newly single widower. He drank his life away into a bottle day by day. His life became almost as horrid as that damn car, crunched into two directions. Aging away from birth, but drinking himself closer to an early grave. I especially resent him. It is his job to help me, he should give me a pep talk, or I don’t know, some fatherly advice. Instead he berates me, he claims it to be my fault. it is not my fault she wanted to die so bad. Fuck her and her smile, I found the anti-depressents weeks before it all went to hell. I suspect she knew. And I suppose I did kill her in a way. How could it feel when your own child knows your darkest secret? Children view their parents as perfect beacons of light, but those pills became a moon that cast a shadow onto me, and in turn, set the sun on her final bid to joy. I resent myself most for this.



I know my role. I know my actions have caused this. I have walked the earth weeping for too long. 



There is something inside me.



My father should have never birthed such a horrid wretch as myself. I am a curse placed onto this house, destined to lead them all to ruin. I suppose I will fulfill my destiny then. 



I will give my father pills he needs within his morning cup of coffee. Afterwards I will enter my room with the rest of every medication in that awful cabinet. I will go to sleep one last time.



And I will wake up with them. 



A happy family (:

Now that I’m in engineering college, things are different. The environment isn’t great, and while there are girls around, I haven’t found anyone I genuinely connect with. I don’t care about looks — I just want someone I can truly vibe with.

I (26f) have been a committed relationship with my boyfriend (27m) for almost 5 years now. We have a really good relationship and have blended our lives together pretty well, up until this point. 

We’ve been living together for about a year and a half. I work from home full-time and he works hybrid. He usually only has to go to work in person three times a week. We have separate friend groups, and I’m able to have my girls nights, but we’re all adults and have pretty busy schedules so that really only ends up being once a month or so. Even then, I live really close by a lot of my girlfriends so I end up going home at the end of the night. 

Now here is the problem. At the beginning of the year my boyfriend and I made a New Year’s resolution to start going to the gym more often, super cringe I know. It became a great addition to our routine. Two weeks ago, he caught a really bad cold, was homesick for a few days and wasn’t able to go to the gym. I went by myself and I realized how nice it was to get a few hours all to myself. I liked that I didn’t have to work around his work schedule. I liked that I was just able to go by myself and grab a coffee on the way, listen to Megan Thee Stallion loudly in the car. I liked that I was able to catch a yoga class, and I’ve been debating doing a Pilates class here or there. My Boyfriend mainly likes to focus on cardio and some weight training. I’ve asked him if he’d be interested in doing a class and he said that they were a waste of time.  

I didn’t realize how much time we were spending together until I actually got a moment to think. Other than him going to work and hanging out with his friends, we spend every living moment together. We have breakfast together. We have lunch together when he’s at home. We have dinner together. We watch movies and TV together. We do groceries and run errands together too. I love spending time with him and I love being around him. None of this is an issue for me. Butttt I can’t remember the last time I farted and he wasn’t there to make a joke about it. 

After realizing this, I spoke to my boyfriend and asked if he would be ok if I started going to the gym on my own. He didn’t really understand and took it as an offense. He asked if I didn’t like working out with him. I responded that while I liked working out with him I also enjoyed working out on my own and being able to do classes that he wouldn’t necessarily enjoy. He said if it was a timing thing that he would sacrifice his lunchtime and go with me midday if that’s what I preferred. I pushed back, said it wasn’t about him, I just wanted some girlie time and well needed space. He then proceeded to accuse me of wanting to go to the gym for a specific reason, insinuating that I was going there for male attention. I of course, was insulted and told him that wasn’t the case at all and that I just needed one thing a week that was just for me. He let it go for about a day, but proceeded to make petty comments every now and then about my so called odd behavior. This week as I was getting ready for the gym I put on a really cute gym set and I’m not gonna lie, it was flattering in curvy areas. He started with his bullshit again and made rude remarks that the only reason I wanted to go to the gym was so that I could get checked out without him being a deterrent for other guys looking at me. I matched his energy and told him that maybe if he wasn’t constantly breathing my air, I wouldn’t feel like I was suffocating in my own house. Yes I know it was mean, but honestly, he was wearing me down. 

Since I made that remark, he’s been very short with me. Responding to my questions with one word answers or just telling me that he wasn’t in the mood to talk. I understand that I hurt his feelings, and apologized for what I said. He shrugged me off. 

So am I the asshole for wanting to go to the gym on my own? If anyone has any advice about how I can explain to him why this is important to me let me know.

Try Me Out, No Strings Attached!","Hey, you! Yes, you...scrolling through Reddit looking for something to spice up your day. Stop right here, because I might just be your next obsession!

I’m a 21 yr old curious guy, single and ready to mingle (or just chat....your call!). Think of me as your limited time offer: a chill, curious dude who’s all about good vibes, great chats, and maybe a little playful trouble. Here’s what you’re getting:The Basics (Because You’re Curious):

* **Gender**: Male
* **Age**: 21
* **Status**: Single and way too excited to meet you!

* **Hair**: Dark, short, and perfectly tousled for that “I woke up like this” vibe. Bonus: It gets extra messy when I’m deep in thought...or distracted by you.
* **Eyes**: Brown, bright, and always sparkling...except pre coffee, when they’re still flirting with the idea of waking up.
* **Height**: A solid 5'8"" tall enough to grab stuff off the top shelf, short enough to slide right into your cuddle zone.
* **Personality**: Your chill, curious sidekick who’s always down for a laugh. I’ll listen to your wildest dreams, then hit you with a goofy joke to keep it light. Shy at first, but once I’m in, I’m all in...think goofy, thoughtful, and ready for anything.

# Special Skills (Why You’ll Keep Me Around):

* I can cook a meal that’ll make you smile (not just instant noodles...I’ve got range!).
* I memorize song lyrics like a champ, so expect random serenades at 2 a.m.
* Meme game? Elite. I’ll send you the perfect one to brighten your day, or make you snort laugh.

# Fueled By:

* Books, music, and those late night thoughts that hit different.

# Hobbies (Let’s Bond Over These):

I’m into books that make you think, walks that turn into adventures, and chats that stretch into the early hours. I’m here to explore minds, hearts, and maybe a little more if the sparks fly.

# Likes (What I’m Craving):

* Chats that vibe like your favorite playlist.
* Spontaneous “why not?” adventures.
* Swapping songs or debating Netflix’s latest banger.
* Trying new things, especially if “you” are one of them.

# Dislikes (Let’s Avoid These):

* Ghosting (just say it if I’m not your vibe, I can handle it!).
* Chats as dull as a Monday morning (let’s keep it spicy!).
* Awkward silences, though I’ll probably break them with a random fact or a terrible pun.

# Availability (I’m Flexible for You):

Up for late night talks that turn into sunrise confessions, movie nights where we fight over popcorn supremacy, and new experiences we’ll laugh about later. Let’s keep it fun, real, and 100% us.Flaws (Keeping It Real):

* A little shy at first, but give me a sec, I’m worth the wait.
* Curiosity overload, I might ask too many questions (it’s because you’re fascinating!).
* I overthink sometimes, but only because I want this to be good.

# Price (Best Deal Around):

Totally free for chats, laughs, and a sprinkle of flirtation. If we vibe, we’ll figure out the rest together...no pressure, just possibilities.

# Perfect Match (Is It You?):

You...if you’re open minded, kind, and ready to dive into something new. Extra points if you’ve got a book rec, love a deep convo, or can suggest a wild idea I haven’t tried yet.

1j6b9qq,https://www.reddit.com/r/stories/comments/1j6b9qq/psychotic_wife_when_dreams_turn_into_obsession/,Psychotic Wife: When Dreams Turn into Obsession,"I’ve been married for seven years to a man who seems perfect—too perfect. He’s kind, loving, and never gives me a reason to doubt him. But for the past two weeks, I can’t shake this feeling that something’s horribly wrong.

It started with dreams—vivid, gut-wrenching nightmares. In them, I’d catch my husband whispering to some faceless woman, smiling in ways he never does with me. Sometimes, I’d find messages—flirty, secretive, yet impossible to read before they vanished. Each morning I’d wake up sweating, heart racing, convinced something terrible was happening behind my back.

At first, I blamed stress. Dreams aren’t real. But when the same visions kept returning—night after night—I knew there had to be something more.

I told my husband about the dreams. I expected him to comfort me, but instead, he laughed. Not mocking—just casual, dismissive. He kissed my forehead and said, *“You think too much.”*

But if I was overthinking, why did the unease keep growing? Why did his innocent smiles start to feel like rehearsed performances? Why did his perfectly ordinary routine suddenly seem… calculated?

One night, I couldn’t hold back anymore. While he was in the shower, I grabbed his phone. My hands shook as I unlocked it, breath shallow. WhatsApp? Clean. Facebook? Boring. Call logs? Normal. Nothing. No flirty chats. No mystery numbers. Nothing.

I should’ve been relieved. Instead, I felt sick. *He’s covering his tracks.* He had to be. Maybe he was using encrypted apps. Maybe he had a burner phone. Maybe he wasn’t even cheating—maybe it was worse.

What if he wanted me gone?

I became obsessed. I checked his pockets when he slept. I snooped through his car. I even followed him once when he said he was meeting a friend. He went to the bar, had a beer, and came home like nothing happened.

I should have stopped. I should have accepted the truth. But I couldn’t. The fear wouldn’t leave me.

That’s when I started testing him. I’d move his car keys, then accuse him of forgetting where he put them—just to see if he'd get flustered. I changed his phone password while he slept, hoping he'd panic. But nothing worked. He stayed calm. Too calm.

One night, I slipped a tracking app onto his phone. I followed him after work, watching from a distance as he walked into a coffee shop and sat alone, scrolling his phone. No women. No suspicious meetings. Just my husband, quietly sipping his drink.

When I got home before him, I sat on the couch and stared at the wall for hours. Was I losing my mind? Or was he just too smart—too good at hiding whatever he was doing?

I started picturing him with her. Imagining their conversations. Her laugh. His smile. It consumed me. I couldn’t even touch him without wondering if his hands had been on her earlier that day.

I couldn’t take it anymore. One evening, as he sat reading on the couch, I stood over him, gripping a kitchen knife behind my back. I wasn’t going to use it—not really—but I just wanted to see if he’d flinch. If he was guilty, surely he’d sense something. He didn’t. He just smiled up at me and asked, *“Everything okay?”*

That smile. That calm, collected smile. It felt like mockery—like he knew what I was thinking and enjoyed it.

I put the knife away and locked myself in the bathroom, crying silently for hours. I don’t know who I am anymore. I’ve become someone I swore I’d never be—a psychotic wife, obsessed with proving a crime that might not even exist.

But what if it does? What if he’s playing a long game—one where I’m the final piece that needs to be removed?

I don’t know what’s real anymore. But I do know this—I can’t stop. I can’t trust him. And I can’t trust myself.

1j6b99j,https://www.reddit.com/r/creativewriting/comments/1j6b99j/joe_k_part_19/,Joe K - Part 19,"Back at his flat, the need to talk to someone, amplified by the impossibility of that someone being Katie, pushed him into taking her advice - he rang Pearl Goolie. On the ride home, he'd become convinced that someone else, someone who would be outraged, someone who would not only have the conscience and the confidence to go public but would even have a good personal motive for doing so, had to be told, because until this thing did go public, his life would be in danger. It was a big surprise when she phoned back less than an hour after he'd left a message with her personal assistant. During that time, he'd talked himself into not expecting to hear back from her until after the election, if at all, but she sounded like she had all the time in the world and it was a pleasure to be talking to him. ""I was going to call you today, anyway. I've just done an interview with a regional news reporter called Greta Green and she'd like to film a follow-up to the article, if you're interested. The polling has been very strong on that, by the way, so thank you. How's it going your end? anything new on your case yet?""

""Not yet, but I'm hopeful,"" he lied, and immediately regretted it, feeling that it might not be the best way to begin an outpouring of unbelievable truth. Nevertheless, she chose to encourage his weak attempt at optimism.

""No reason not to be, these things can take a bit of time. Once I'm elected, I'll be able to make some direct enquiries on your behalf but, in the meantime, what can I do for you?""

""There's something I need to tell you, something that's going to sound a little crazy, but that I promise you is a hundred percent true."" Great start, he thought, if that didn't signpost self-delusion, what did? The line wasn't good enough to hear any alarm bells going off in her head, but they had to be there. Before she could stop him, he launched into everything he knew about her assumed predecessor's ignominious end and how he came about that information. It all came out of him like a projectile of emetically induced vomit that his life depended on, which it probably did.

Goolie listened patiently to everything he had to say and, although the opportunity rarely presented itself, didn't interrupt him once. By the time he'd paused long enough to take any perceptible breath, only a few minor details had been omitted, including the names Womble and Wire, to protect the innocent, Broker, to protect the guilty and McQuarrie to protect himself. He didn't mention anything about the Russian mafia either. After all, they had nothing to do with it apart from Dmitri, and he was only an exploitative witness to Broker's involvement. If he did find the camera, and if he recognised who was on it, there wasn't much chance of him using it for anything other than expanding his own blackmail operation, and that probably wouldn't go well for him, no matter who is father is. In K's version, he was nothing more than Broker's anonymous friend, and as long as he kept the name to himself he would have nothing to fear from the Russian mafia. Small mercies. There were a few seconds of silence, during which the nervous tension threatened to strain the line to its breaking point. What did he expect her to say? He'd just made a very serious accusation against some very powerful people. What could she say?

""This is a very serious accusation against some very powerful people,"" she said. ""I need you to listen to me very carefully, Joe, so you don't misunderstand me. Do you remember that photograph of me with Kara and Lily?""

""Lily's your daughter, right?""

""Right, and Kara's my partner, I've known her for more than twenty years. She's always been there for me, she's never let me down and she's had to put up with a lot - politicians are not easy people to build personal relationships with. I trust Kara more than anyone else in the world, but if she told me what you just told me, I would have trouble believing her... Do you understand what I'm saying, Joe?""

""I understand, and I'm sorry... I just needed someone to talk to about this and the only other person I could think of was... the cop who told me, and he's... already angry enough. I know I sound crazy, and maybe I am, just forget I said...""

""You sound perfectly sane to me, and I'm not forgetting anything. I just need you to know how sceptical we all need to be, and how cautiously we need to proceed with this. For example, I need to be sure - have you told anyone else about this?""

""Nobody.""

""Good, please don't say anything to anyone, at least until we can meet up and discuss our options. Obviously we'll need to track down your friend, the blackmailer. I'll need to talk to the victim, if she'll talk to me. And we'll need the policemen and the paramedics to verify everything... and anyone who saw her injuries at the hospital, too - this would have took some considerable cover-up, so there's going to be a lot of digging to do.""

""But it's only a week until the by-election, you must have a million other things to do, how are we going to do all that?""

""Oh, there's no way we can do anything with this before the by-election, I'd be accused of exploiting a serious crime for political gain and, besides, I'll be in a much stronger position once I've secured the seat. For now, I just want you to think about yourself, take it easy and try not to get stressed."" Sharing his burden with Goolie, and the clearer, single-minded focus of staying alive long enough for her to get elected, had already helped relieve some of that stress. What didn't help was the sound of the helicopter. He walked over to the window and looked around the cloudy sky, unable to find its source. His eyes fell on the block opposite, suspicious of any shadowy movements or potential curtain twitching - threats could be lurking anywhere, now. Down below, a zephyr was stood in the entrance of West Block, looking up at him. He quickly backed away from the window, then approached from the side to close the blinds. He took a couple of leaping pills with a glass of water and all of the day's revelations swirling around his mind in a maelstrom of information he still couldn't make much sense of. Truth is stranger than fiction, he thought, picking up *The History of the Siege of Lisbon* and laying down on the couch.

He was awoken by a knock on the door. Unable to move, the volitional vacuum should have scared him but, instead, it felt strangely comforting. Sleep paralysis, he concluded, and assumed the confused functionality of his brain was causing an auditory hallucination but, when it granted basic automotive skills to his consciousness, the knocking continued with at an increasing volume and frequency. Still uncertain in his movements, he slowly got up to investigate. ""Good evening, Josef, may we come in?"" said a Russian accent from a face appositionally recognisable. Consent assumed, or more likely superfluous, he and his silent companion were soon inside, the door shut tight behind them. ""Please excuse us for calling on you out of the black. Rest assured, you will be so willing to help facilitate the briefness of this unwelcome intrusion that we will graciously decline the coffee you are about to offer us. In fact, my enquiry is as simple as it is urgent, so there is no need for me even to remove my brand new overcoat. Once you have told me where Broker is, me and my associate will be on our merry way. Would you like a cigarette?""

""No, thank you. I'm sorry, but you've wasted a journey, I don't know where Broker is.""

""Shame,"" said the Russian, removing his brand new overcoat. ""Please, take a seat."" His associate approached K, picked him up and deposited him on a chair. ""This I was not expecting, obviously the rumours of your nihilism have been greatly exaggerated."" The Russian stood over him, clenched his fist and punched him in the face. ""Hurts doesn't it, getting punched in the nose, but at least it's still on your face, I once knew a man... ack, you don't won't to hear about that, you've got that intense pain shooting through your brain right now - even with your nose still on your face, this isn't any kind of fun."" He looked deep into K's watery eyes. ""But here's the rub, as long as I'm here, this is as good as it's going to get, and it won't ever get this good again.""

""I swear,"" said K. ""He never told me where he was going and I've got no idea where he could be, I only met him a few weeks ago..."" The Russian silenced him with his hand.

""You know, Russians are great liars and my father was the world heavyweight champion of Russian liars. Growing up with him I learnt the pantomime. There are seventeen different things a man can do when he lies to give himself away. A man's got seventeen different pantomimes. A woman's got twenty, a man's got seventeen. What we have here is a little game of show and tell - you want to show me nothing, but you are telling me everything. I know you know where he is, so tell me, before I do some damage you won't walk away from.""

""Could I have that cigarette now?"" The Russian lit it for him and K took a deep drag. ""Thank you... Do you know what a syllogism is?""

""Is it like a Synagogue? Broker's hiding in a Synagogue?""

""It's Aristotelian logic, I'll give you an example - (1), all Russians are great liars, (2), you are a Russian, (1) + (2) = (3), you are a great liar. Aristotle was a...""

""Aristotle was a bugger for the bottle and I'm a great liar, you got me, but tell me something I don't know.""

""That would be (4), I'm not lying when I tell you I don't know where Broker is. Furthermore, (3) + (4) = (5), your story about pantomimes was nothing but a pantomime - in fact, it sounds a lot like something I saw in a film."" The Russian clicked his fingers and pointed at his associate, who fetched him a chair, then picked up the coffee table and carefully placed it between K and the Russian. Reaching behind his back, he pulled a revolver out of his belt and dramatically slammed it on the table.

""You like films? have you seen this one?"" said the Russian. ""Back home we call this 'roulette'."" He spun the cylinder, pointed the gun at his temple and pulled the trigger - click. ""Your turn... unless you tell me where Broker is.""

""I can't tell you where he is, so I don't have a choice,"" click.

""Sometimes a great liar is also a great cheat,"" click.

""Sometimes a great liar is also a great actor,"" click.

""You're not a nihilist, you're an idiot,"" click.

""You're not a Russian gangster, you're Christopher Walken,"" click.

""You can't win, this is my game,"" click.

""I can't lose, this is my dream,"" K pulled the trigger and squirted water at his head and into his mouth. Then he pointed the gun it at Christopher Walken and fired okraschoten at him.

He was awoken by a knock on the door. Shit, he thought, is this going to be one of those dreams? Struggling to get up off the couch, he discovered a heavy grogginess and a sore neck from the awkward position he'd fallen asleep in two hours earlier. The unscheduled nap hadn't done him any good at all. It *had* moved him to the other side of dusk, though, so he flicked the light-switch, checked the chain was on, and opened the door. It was Expector Womble and Inspector Wire, off-duty or undercover - it was hard to tell which, with his hood up like that. He might have been for an early evening jog or dealing drugs on Magritte Street. In fact, take a couple of inches off him and from a distance... ""It's not like you guys to knock first,"" said K. The strangest of days had just got stranger but, figuring that it couldn't get any more so and, given the current perceived threat level, that it wouldn't hurt to have some protection around, he decided to let them in and try to get them to stay a while.

""You've got your books back,"" said Wire.

""You're 80% right, which gets you 100% of a beer.""

""You look like shit, what have you been doing?"" said Womble.

""Sleep Walken,"" he said, retrieving three beers from his fridge. ""Have a seat. You didn't happen to see any suspicious characters hanging around outside, did you?""

""Don't you start, the Wire's been looking in the rear-view mirror all the way over here.""

""I'm here, aren't I?""

""Hey, this was your idea.""

""What idea?"" said K, wondering what vigilante scheme these two had in mind and what part he was supposed to play in it. About to cross the rubicon, Wire gave Womble a look that said - are you sure about this guy? It was reciprocated with a look that said - are *you* sure about *this*?

""We want to talk to your journalist friend about... well, you know what about,"" said Wire, still in need of a little more assurance from the SPQR before deploying the whole legion.

""There might be a slight problem, there.""

""What sort of problem?"" said Womble.

""A spatial problem - nobody knows where he is.""

""But he's interested in the story, right?"" said Womble. Feeling that he was on something of a roll after the Goolie phone call, K decided to go with his instincts again, make the leap and trust the agents of chaos who had initiated the chain of events that had brought such turmoil into his previously quiet life.

""Not so much interested, as... involved.""

As they drank their beers, K explained Broker's part in the Titorelli Close incident. Womble had already seen them together at the Black Bottom, so there was little point in concealing *his* name, but he continued to refer to Lord McQuarrie and his cronies as 'Broker's employer,' and Dmitri Tereshkov as 'Broker's friend'.

""I told you, Bungo. I said there was something dodgy about those guys in the car and you said it was nothing, remember?""

""I said it was just solicitation and we weren't going to stop for that, not with that cunt in the back. I was still fuming, remember. I just wanted to wipe that smirk off his face and, since you wouldn't let me do it the old fashioned way, getting the animal in a cage as quickly as possible was the next best thing.""

""And you didn't recognise Broker?""

""He was turned away when we went past, pretending the seatbelt was jammed - you know what that usually means. What about that camera? you were searching the flat.""

""Maybe it was there, maybe it wasn't, like you said, we had other priorities. They must have recovered it somehow, though, there's no way they'd risk such a big cover-up with that footage out there - nobody's that important... They go to all that trouble and, when he's no longer a defection threat, they make him resign, forcing a by-election that could cost them the seat anyway... why?""

""More to the point, what are we going to do now?"" said Womble. The look exchanged between K and Wire acknowledged that they both suspected what he was thinking and neither of them were happy about it. It was up to the accused criminal to offer the cops a legal solution.

""Earlier this evening, I was talking to an MP,"" - fingers crossed. ""Now, she doesn't know either of your names yet, but, if you both agree, she might be able to help... I trust her.""

""I'm not sure,"" said Womble.

""Not sure?"" said Wire. ""An MP has a lot more pull than a sportswriter.""

""It's not that. This whole thing just got a lot more... complicated. It obviously goes a lot deeper than the chief, you need to think about your family.""

""I *am* thinking about my family... I haven't been sleeping right since I let Dee put the squeeze on me - even worse, after what they did to you. Then a few days ago, I asked my son what he'd done at school and he said - 'I was talking about you, dad.'

'Why is that?' I said.

'We were talking about famous people,' he said.

'I'm not famous,' I said.

'I know that,' he said. 'I'm not stupid. We were talking about things famous people said in history and one of them made me think of you.' He got his exercise book out of his bag and read me something that's stuck in my mind ever since - '""Bad men need nothing more to compass their ends, than that good men should look on and do nothing."" People spoke funny in them days,' he said. 'But I know what it means now.'

'Me too,' I said. Sure, my son's proud of me now, but I want him to expect more of people when he grows up, and I don't want to be the one to let him down. I want him to demand the best of himself and still respect me, and I've got to earn that. And I want the words he learns in school to be more than just words... I wish I could remember where that quote came from.""

""John Stuart Mill,"" said K. ""Who, of his own free will... never mind.""

""Let's go see this MP first thing tomorrow morning,"" said Womble. K's face expressed doubts about that suggestion. ""What sort of problem?""

""A temporal problem - she's not *actually* an MP yet, but...""",2,1741415864.0,creativewriting,0,1.0,False

Of course retail is not known for being fun or good. But still had hopes for how it should go.

My last two jobs were- Best Buy supervisor and AT&T sales rep.

The supervisor role was a good learning experience especially since I’m a student in Business Administration. The morale was great, managers were cool and so were coworkers.

AT&T was one of the worst jobs I’ve had (besides my first one). Although the hourly rate and the commission was good, morale was terrible they had terrible late and sick day policies, would do unethical things like rack up customers bills to make money, and never had appreciation for us as reps.

I ended up quitting in December no notice because of the fact they denied me leave for mental health when I was going through bipolar mania, and my sisters passing.

I was there for a year and 3 months and couldn’t take it. I wanted to get out of there, and I took the risk of having no job for a couple months.

A recruiter/talent manager actually reached out to me on here on one of my posts in the logistics subreddit because I was looking for a job in the industry to purse my goal and career.

Well, finished my first week- and can I just say 15/10 experience. It’s an office job. I’m a Coordinator and after 90 days if i perform well I can be a Broker. 

It’s a smaller company (about 30 people) but the morale, the appreciation, the structure, the managers, the coworkers, everyone is amazing. It’s not like working in retail which is like a high school cafeteria. 

The training was thorough and an exam was conducted and I got 85%! It was mainly to ensure I was ready to take on the role (It’s a lot of work for logistics I never knew lol).

I get my own desk, computer, they do outings every so often, they have free coffee in the break room, they check in every day. And the managers have been helpful ensuring my transition from a retail environment is smooth.

Sorry for the long post. It’s just amazing to actually work an “adult job” I guess I could say. Last job paid the rent but I hated it. This one pays the bills but is slightly less, but I can work my way up within 6 months . and it’s amazing. Everyone has nothing but good things to say, but yes, like any other job it’s stressful but you get through it.

If any of you are out there and are in the same position I was. I assure you look for jobs that are smaller, newer. It’s amazing!",1,1741415850.0,jobs,0,1.0,False

1j6b78x,https://www.reddit.com/r/Kafka/comments/1j6b78x/joe_k_part_19/,Joe K - Part 19,"Back at his flat, the need to talk to someone, amplified by the impossibility of that someone being Katie, pushed him into taking her advice - he rang Pearl Goolie. On the ride home, he'd become convinced that someone else, someone who would be outraged, someone who would not only have the conscience and the confidence to go public but would even have a good personal motive for doing so, had to be told, because until this thing did go public, his life would be in danger. It was a big surprise when she phoned back less than an hour after he'd left a message with her personal assistant. During that time, he'd talked himself into not expecting to hear back from her until after the election, if at all, but she sounded like she had all the time in the world and it was a pleasure to be talking to him. ""I was going to call you today, anyway. I've just done an interview with a regional news reporter called Greta Green and she'd like to film a follow-up to the article, if you're interested. The polling has been very strong on that, by the way, so thank you. How's it going your end? anything new on your case yet?""

""Not yet, but I'm hopeful,"" he lied, and immediately regretted it, feeling that it might not be the best way to begin an outpouring of unbelievable truth. Nevertheless, she chose to encourage his weak attempt at optimism.

""No reason not to be, these things can take a bit of time. Once I'm elected, I'll be able to make some direct enquiries on your behalf but, in the meantime, what can I do for you?""

""There's something I need to tell you, something that's going to sound a little crazy, but that I promise you is a hundred percent true."" Great start, he thought, if that didn't signpost self-delusion, what did? The line wasn't good enough to hear any alarm bells going off in her head, but they had to be there. Before she could stop him, he launched into everything he knew about her assumed predecessor's ignominious end and how he came about that information. It all came out of him like a projectile of emetically induced vomit that his life depended on, which it probably did.

Goolie listened patiently to everything he had to say and, although the opportunity rarely presented itself, didn't interrupt him once. By the time he'd paused long enough to take any perceptible breath, only a few minor details had been omitted, including the names Womble and Wire, to protect the innocent, Broker, to protect the guilty and McQuarrie to protect himself. He didn't mention anything about the Russian mafia either. After all, they had nothing to do with it apart from Dmitri, and he was only an exploitative witness to Broker's involvement. If he did find the camera, and if he recognised who was on it, there wasn't much chance of him using it for anything other than expanding his own blackmail operation, and that probably wouldn't go well for him, no matter who is father is. In K's version, he was nothing more than Broker's anonymous friend, and as long as he kept the name to himself he would have nothing to fear from the Russian mafia. Small mercies. There were a few seconds of silence, during which the nervous tension threatened to strain the line to its breaking point. What did he expect her to say? He'd just made a very serious accusation against some very powerful people. What could she say?

""This is a very serious accusation against some very powerful people,"" she said. ""I need you to listen to me very carefully, Joe, so you don't misunderstand me. Do you remember that photograph of me with Kara and Lily?""

""Lily's your daughter, right?""

""Right, and Kara's my partner, I've known her for more than twenty years. She's always been there for me, she's never let me down and she's had to put up with a lot - politicians are not easy people to build personal relationships with. I trust Kara more than anyone else in the world, but if she told me what you just told me, I would have trouble believing her... Do you understand what I'm saying, Joe?""

""I understand, and I'm sorry... I just needed someone to talk to about this and the only other person I could think of was... the cop who told me, and he's... already angry enough. I know I sound crazy, and maybe I am, just forget I said...""

""You sound perfectly sane to me, and I'm not forgetting anything. I just need you to know how sceptical we all need to be, and how cautiously we need to proceed with this. For example, I need to be sure - have you told anyone else about this?""

""Nobody.""

""Good, please don't say anything to anyone, at least until we can meet up and discuss our options. Obviously we'll need to track down your friend, the blackmailer. I'll need to talk to the victim, if she'll talk to me. And we'll need the policemen and the paramedics to verify everything... and anyone who saw her injuries at the hospital, too - this would have took some considerable cover-up, so there's going to be a lot of digging to do.""

""I *am* thinking about my family... I haven't been sleeping right since I let Dee put the squeeze on me - even worse, after what they did to you. Then a few days ago, I asked my son what he'd done at school and he said - 'I was talking about you, dad.'

'Why is that?' I said.

'We were talking about famous people,' he said.

'I'm not famous,' I said.

'I know that,' he said. 'I'm not stupid. We were talking about things famous people said in history and one of them made me think of you.' He got his exercise book out of his bag and read me something that's stuck in my mind ever since - '""Bad men need nothing more to compass their ends, than that good men should look on and do nothing."" People spoke funny in them days,' he said. 'But I know what it means now.'

'Me too,' I said. Sure, my son's proud of me now, but I want him to expect more of people when he grows up, and I don't want to be the one to let him down. I want him to demand the best of himself and still respect me, and I've got to earn that. And I want the words he learns in school to be more than just words... I wish I could remember where that quote came from.""

I thank him for the gesture and say I want to go to bed. I have a busy day tomorrow. 'Are you coming too?' I try to gently coax him into bed; maybe this time he won't drink beer because, at this rate, that crate will be empty in no time, and we really can't afford to keep buying his beers.

'No, I'll have a beer first and then come to bed later.' Hours later, I wake up to cold hands on my body. Ricardo has crawled into bed. I smell his alcoholic breath, and I suspect he's had more than just one beer.

'You're so delicious, so beautiful. Be intimate with me, Truusje,' he says, half-drunk in my ear.

'No, Ricardo, I want to sleep.'

'But I want you, Princess, I crave you so badly.' I try to push his hands away, but he holds them firmly on my body. Something inside me tells me I better not oppose him. I don't want any trouble because he doesn't deserve that either. He's trying his best to help with the housework and find a job. It's not his fault he hasn't found work yet. I turn around and smile at him. He starts kissing me, and his hands roam all over my body.

'That's it, Princess. You're so fine,' he whispers. I resolve to talk to him tomorrow about his drinking habits, and I then give in to him.

The following day, I'm having coffee, and Ricardo sits down next to me. 'I think I'll call my mother. She might be worried. That argument has been going on for too long now.'

'If you want to, love, then you should,' I reply. While Ricardo is on the phone, I realise I don't dare mention his drinking habit.

And so, contact is restored between Ricardo and his parents. From that moment on, they have daily phone calls.

'Truusje and I will come to visit next weekend, Mom. I'll also pick up my stuff because I'll need that here from now on.' Ricardo winks meaningfully at me.

I wonder what they'll think of me and hope I'll get along with them well. But something is nagging at me, the events of the previous evening. I'll have to tell Ricardo how I feel about his alcohol use. I make a suggestion.

'Darling, how about next time we go shopping, we first see how much we have left and then buy a six-pack or crate of beer with that? You know we're not well off, and having a beer in the evening is fine. But you actually drink much more than just a beer. Sometimes, we go through two crates a week. Don't you think that's a bit much?' He looks at me, surprised.

'Princess, I cherish being able to have my beer every evening. That's not something we'll cut back on; you enjoy it too, don't you? I'm not an alcoholic if that's what concerns you.' He gives me a comforting kiss. Actually, he's right. It's not as if he drinks excessively every night like he did yesterday. And he does have a point. I do join him for a beer occasionally. Maybe if I stop doing that, he'll drink less, too. He's such a sweetheart; I feel at ease, safe, and secure with him. I love him. Perhaps I shouldn't complain so much.

Today, we're taking the train to his parents. I must say, I'm really looking forward to meeting his parents, brother, and sister.

'Dad, Mom, Vera, Gerrie, this is Truusje,' he says, looking at me affectionately. We exchange handshakes.

'Just call me Sien. And this is Cor,' his mother said warmly. Instantly, I feel at ease. After coffee, Ricardo suddenly took my hand.

'I want to show you something, Princess, my greatest hobby.'

'What's that?' I asked curiously.

'You'll see. Hopefully, you'll like it too,' he laughed led. He leads me through the backyard into the shed.

'Tada!' he says as he opens the door.

I'm greeted by the smell and feathers of numerous pigeons. My eyes widen, and my mouth falls open in surprise. He's a pigeon fancier!

In high school, we were inseparable. I met you during my senior year. You were passionate about fast cars, parties, bonfires, and wrenching in the garage. On the other hand, I loved reading, exploring new shops in town, listening to music, and was generally a homebody. Together, we introduced each other to new experiences. You taught me how to change a tire and change my oil, while I showed you my favorite coffee and how to relax in a field. As the year progressed, our love for each other only grew stronger. I yearned for your touch and your presence more and more. You gave me all my firsts, and I was eternally grateful for you. You loved me in ways I had never imagined, understanding my needs and desires perfectly. From a gentle squeeze of my hand when I was feeling overwhelmed to encouraging me to step out of my comfort zone when I needed a nudge, I could always count on you to catch me if I fell. The girls in town were always smitten with you, yearning to experience the mysterious, tall, and muscular boy that I knew so well. They would throw themselves at you, sending their numbers to you even when they thought I wouldn’t notice. Despite all this, you always made it clear that your love was for me alone. 

For a while, I noticed that you had been acting differently, but if you wanted to talk about it, you would have brought it up. I would lie on your chest quietly and let you twirl my hair in your fingers while you listened to your music. I would text you, filling you in on what I was doing when you said you were too busy. We went a week without seeing each other, and soon enough, it was a month. I received short texts here and there, but there was something amiss. I decided to bake your favorite cupcakes, hoping to stop by the shop to see you, but when I pulled up, I saw a car I didn’t recognize. I walked into the shop and found you pressed against the wall by a tall brunette, lips locked, and your hand on her shoulder. With tears streaming down my face, I dropped the cupcakes and walked out. I drove and drove until I pulled over on the side of the highway to cry. My phone was flooded with messages and missed calls, but I blocked your number. I didn’t want an explanation; I wanted nothing from you.

Six years later, I’m returning to my hometown. I had moved away after the heartbreak and decided that I needed to achieve my dreams on my own. I became an author and had a house in the woods by the river. My parents had been nagging me about coming back home to visit, but after years of procrastination, I couldn’t put it off any longer. I had been avoiding town because of a foolish high school love story. I had decided to meet up with some old friends at the local bar, unaware that you frequented it every Friday. 

Hey there! I typed this up quickly and did my best to get most of the details in there as I am currently at work. I’m looking for a detailed partner who does not mind replying in first person. I’d love for this to be dramatic and emotional, a good mix of slow burn / fast pace. If you think you’d be interested go ahead and message me!:)

However, after reading your responses, I realized that some clarifications about my case are necessary in order to receive more targeted feedback.

I was diagnosed with ADHD in adulthood, along with comorbid addictive behaviors, mainly behavioral addictions. The most significant one is a sexual addiction, particularly to pornography (I have been abstinent for three months solely through willpower). During adolescence, I had a video game addiction, which eventually faded—likely replaced by my sex addiction. Ultimately, my relationship with work is also borderline addictive.

I have managed to completely quit alcohol, coffee, and tobacco (zero consumption of all three for almost three years), and I do not use any drugs. On the surface, I seem to “control” all these addictions, but only at the cost of an immense personal effort. This is why I believe that taking medication might be a better option, as the mental effort required to keep everything in check is becoming increasingly difficult and is exacerbating my impulsivity.

However, I fear that taking psychostimulants (e.g., Adderall) could destabilize this fragile balance that has taken so much effort to achieve. Hence, my question regarding your experiences with the impact of such treatment on addictive symptoms.",1,1741415036.0,ADHD,1,1.0,False

We started talking daily, and he began flirting and suggesting we meet up. 

After two months, I asked what was going on between us (as I made it clear early on I was looking for something serious). He first said he was talking to me with an open mind. Then he said just wanted to catch up and didn’t want to miss the chance to get to know me as friends, so I took a step back. But then he invited me for coffee and to watch the sunset. I agreed to coffee but declined the sunset to maintain friendship boundaries. When we met, we had a great time, and he later texted that it was amazing seeing me (he drove 1.5 hours each way).

I kept some distance since he mentioned he was figuring things out (job, life, etc.), but we continued talking daily(deep convos), and he used my employee perks, which I didn’t mind. Even if I dried out the convo he would initiate even more. By month four, I asked again about our dynamic and I thought it’s best to be distant friends, as he was started flirting with me again and initiating meeting up.

He admitted he wanted to get to know me and see if there is anything but didn’t want to waste time. But, some things were holding him back, so he agreed that we stay distant friends and could reconnect later. He then asked if it was okay to keep sending TikTok’s , to which I agreed. He later asked what I was looking for, and I told him I was just catching up at first, but his mixed signals confused me. He apologized, said he tried his best to limit sending me messages, and hoped everything was fine between us.

Do you think he was using me, stringing me along, or just not interested? It’s been a few weeks since and it’s cricket on both sides. Btw nothing sexual happened between us due to religious reasons. ",0,1741414823.0,AskMenAdvice,8,0.33,False

1j6avhj,https://i.redd.it/hno5maksqene1.png,Part 5: A biginning as a journalist,"01/17/2025:

The dawn filtered through the cracks of the blind like a thief trying not to be seen, while I struggled in bed with my hand on my forehead, prisoner of a dream that I did not want to let go. Coffee, that bitter concoction that reminds me so much of my own existence, called me from the kitchen, urging me to face another day of this reality we call life, I was going to prepare mate, but I wanted a new experience.

The cup moaned like a damned while I ground the beans with the cockroach, and the aroma it gave off was so intense that it seemed like I wanted to choke me after pouring a little milk into it. ""Birth is a curse and existence a prison,"" whispered the steam rising from the cup, while I, like an automaton, poured more milk and added sugar, as if the sweetness could ease the weight of conscience.

""To live is to suffer, to survive is to find some meaning in the suffering,"" murmured the cocoa extracted in Nicaragua, while I, with trembling hands, held the cup as if it were the chalice of the last communion to overflow with wine. The first sip was like a scream to the edge of my lips, a reminder that, in the end, everything is pain, and that every morning is an awakening in the hell of existence.

The disgusting taste dissolved in my mouth, and with it, the illusions, the hopes, the dreams, the longing for a day where I did not contain caffeine in my blood. That infusion was telling me the story of a man who wakes up one morning and discovers that the world has changed, that there is no longer a place for him, that every step is an effort, every breath a punishment, every black day where he wants everything to be red.

And I, sitting there, with the cup on the small table, wondered if coffee was the executioner, the confessor, or the stalker, if it was the one that kept me in suspense or the one that sank me deeper into the abyss. But in the end, it didn't matter. The American, like life, does not give options. It simply exists.

On January 1st, exactly one month ago, I sent Marcelo Ferrandini—known as Montalvo—the first four chapters of this writing. I wanted his opinion, nothing more, being recognized in his research in Argentina, in addition to his controversial style that I felt at the time was in line with me. I wasn't expecting praise or a job offer, just an honest reading from someone with some experience in the trade. But to my surprise, he was fascinated with my style and offered me a position as an editor at Clarín, his independent journalism digital newspaper.

I received the news with a mixture of fear and disgust with excitement. I had never worked in a newsroom; I had never worked at anything, really. I always considered myself an apprentice, a self-taught person, someone who writes more out of mental necessity than by profession, far from the ""capital contract"" wanting to ""leave my seed"" of knowledge. And yet, there I was, with an opportunity that others would have killed to get, clearly I was very lucky, not many at my age and just starting out get an offer like that.

But the euphoria was followed by anxiety. I could see, in my mind, the faces of my Theory and Practice of Graphic Journalism professors, repeating like gospel that my texts were deficient, chaotic, unacceptable, impertinent to their perfect eye. The teacher of the workshop of that subject, a university version of Tronchatoro, looked at me with contempt from her pedestal in front of Classroom 3, waiting for my every mistake with the same patience with which a cat watches a trapped mouse, about to pull my braids. ""Tell your mommy you'll never pass,"" he seemed to say every moment he explained what he'd done horribly, and in my imagination I was nothing more than a bug under his shoe, doomed to be crushed again and again by faulty syntax or incorrect structure.

Still, I decided to take a chance. Mr. Montalvo gave me the contact information of the editor-in-chief and, after a couple of days, I gathered the courage to write to him. What followed was strange, as if, at the moment of pressing ""send"", something inside me had connected to a larger network, something foreign to my consciousness. A new circuit was activated in my mind, meandering through my pre-existing thoughts, infiltrating the grooves of my reasoning until I could no longer distinguish where I ended and the machinery of the news event began. It was as if an electrical parasite had settled inside me, consuming me with a methodical, inquisitive curiosity, impossible to appease.

The harsh terror of being overwritten by an external intelligence lasted only an instant before becoming an uncontrollable vibration, a muffled scream that dissolved into the fog of my brain. In that moment I understood the magnitude of what I had accepted. Journalism was not just writing news: it was merging with the machinery, letting oneself be absorbed by a system that feeds on information and fresh meat, where each written word is an offering to an invisible god that demands speed, precision, sacrifice and scoop.

And deep within me, I felt the calling. I couldn't resist. My body ached, I longed to be more. I knew that to survive in that world I would have to give myself completely, allow it to reform me, become something bigger, faster, more relentless, I have always dreamed of being like Lanata, there I went up a step to be one.

Turning back was now impossible.

The top editor was Aurélio Cortés. His story had rhymes with mine, as he had also started from the bottom, writing news for Mr. Montalvo until he rose through the newspaper's hierarchy. Now, he was in a position of power, and I was about to present myself to him, not as a simple aspirant, but as someone who, deep down, already knew that he was born to write.

It was not only Mr. Montalvo who read my texts. Cortés also received those chapters and, between sips of mate, he commented bluntly: ""I love your way of writing. Your journalistic chronicles are very good."" It was not an empty courtesy, but a weighty statement, said with the confidence of someone who knows. However, he added: ""I realize why it is more complicated to write chronicles than to write news.""

He had to avoid being lukewarm, but appear to be reckless. Each word had to be measured, each line had to be held with the dignity of someone who knows his worth, but still needs confirmation. So, I wrote an academic, standard, almost disgustingly bureaucratic, but necessary opening. It was the preamble that every speech of this nature requires:

""Good afternoon, dear Mr. Aurélio Cortés. I hope this message finds you well.""

Then, I got to the heart of the matter:

""My name is Fulanito de Tales, and I am contacting you on the recommendation of Mr. Montalvo, who told me to contact him to continue the process for the position of editor at the Clarín newspaper.""

No room for pettiness. It was important to mark the reference of the person who sent me and the reason why it broke into their inbox.

I knew that my lack of formal experience could work against me, but I had something more valuable than that; hunger. And I made it clear in the following line:

""Despite being at the beginning of my academic training, I have previous experience in writing and critical analysis, with a particular focus on political and social issues.""

It seemed like a statement, nothing more. My education at the Faculty of Humanities in Paso de la Patria, Argentina, had given me few tools, but what really sustained me was constant practice, the obsession with writing. Therefore, I added that:

""I am extremely interested in being part of the team of this prestigious media, since I consider that working at Clarín would be an excellent opportunity to develop my skills and contribute from my perspective and style.""

All this, however, had no weight without the next move, he had to show that he was willing to test me.

""Mr. Montalvo mentioned that I should coordinate with you the completion of a test to evaluate my suitability for the position. I remain completely at your disposal to coordinate the day and time that you consider most appropriate.""

I knew it was a message that, in the midst of a boss's mentality, had to be concise and impossible to ignore.

Cortés' message came with the naturalness of someone who is comfortable managing the times as he pleases. There was no rigidity, just a measured informality, a tone that wavered between camaraderie and authority. ""Flexible schedules,"" he said, as if the maelstrom of journalism had not trapped him in an uncontrollable current.

""Perfect, So-and-So. Tomorrow at the same time we will do the Meet. Any inconvenience that may arise, I will let you know in advance. Sorry for the delay, I am having flexible schedules""

I read the message several times. Not because of insecurity, but because of the implicit burden in those lines. It was a confirmation, the first real step in an area that until then had been only a 0% possibility. Tomorrow, at the same time I wrote to you (7:00 PM), the screen would be the beginning of something new.

02/06/2025:

The job interview with Cortés, initially scheduled for January 17, ended up taking place only on the 23rd. Several ""last-minute meetings"" and unforeseen problems postponed it, until we finally managed to make the video call.

During the conversation, I understood the basics. The first two weeks would be a trial: three weekly news stories on popular topics, first Cortés's choice and then my choice. I chose to publish them on Mondays, Thursdays and Fridays. ""Good choice,"" Cortés commented, with a tone that hinted at both approval and a certain camaraderie. Beyond the employee-employer relationship, there was some camaraderie. He was 25 years old, just five years older than me, which facilitated the work dynamic without unnecessary impositions of domination.

At no point did I ask about the pay, I had doubts about everything I was going to do, except that. Not because of a lack of interest, but because of something I learned since I was a child, with my mother's sayings that money comes with effort, and talking about figures too soon can ruin future opportunities. ""Look at this idiot, he asks about pay before doing anything. He doesn't deserve the job or our money,"" something like that I imagined they might think if I hurried. So I accepted the test ""blindly"", trusting that somehow everything would work out in a good way.

Those two weeks were supposed to be paid, although Cortés was not clear about the amount that corresponded to me. ""When you finish the test, I will give you the contact information of the treasurer in charge of that,"" he assured me. With that vague promise, the first step was taken.

The interview was on a Thursday. Just a few days later, on Monday the 27th, I wrote my first assignment for a media outlet, the first tangible step in everything I had done in my career.

Cortés didn't leave me much room for doubt. ""I have you to do the Kuider thing, remember that the crazy man had to go live in Paraguay,"" he told me like someone issuing an order without the need for explanations. Then he added a second, more concise instruction. ""Without subtitles and you are integrating the theme with its important variants.""

As soon as Cortes gave me the directions, I started immediately at 4:47 p.m. m. and I finished the news at 7:51 in the afternoon, the same day. The rules were clear that all news items had to be completed and delivered on the same day they were requested. When I sent him the article, his response was immediate.

""The note is very good. The only 'error' is that you needed to develop the topic of the neighbors a little more, but it is fine. The data and references are well placed.""

Then he added:

""The highlights you made are good too, relevant. However, make them bold, not italic.""

The article was finally published with the title ""Edgardo Kueider is evicted from the 'domestic mansion' where he was under arrest in Paraguay."" My happiness was so great that I felt like my head was going to burst with blood. It was not the satisfaction of having completed my job, but the feeling that something was finally taking shape in my life.

That episode marked a string of publications in the same newspaper, some more successful than others, and others, frankly, atrocious. In my desire to stand out, to devour the media at insane speed, I tripped over my own haste. And the error, the damn error, was none other than a treacherous comma where I should have put a full stop. An insignificant slip for the common reader, but for me, an indelible scar.

Clarín did not take long to notice. And the next news, mine, another imperfect but own creature, appeared transfigured. The structure, the paragraphs, the logical sequence were there, as if a bit of my voice was still trying to make itself heard, but each had been stripped of its aura. My prose was shredded, supplanted by a foreign lexicon, synonyms that did not belong to me, a syntax that seemed strange to me. I was a crooked reflection in a circus mirror, where my style and identity had been modified.

It was devastating, my heart for what I did was shattered. Who would be pleased if his person were replaced by an imposture? Who could bear to see their message stripped away, their literary pulse turned into mere cheap bureaucratic formula? It horrified me to tears. It hurt me with the feeling of an accurate shot, and in that despair I wanted to give in to the temptation of smoking. He had kicked the habit, but like coffee stains on a white shirt, the result of a bad decision, the vice always finds a way to return in the worst mistakes. And that one, which could have been good, was irremediably ruined, stained by frustration and the smoke of a cigarette that was inside me.

02/07/2025:

Friday. I didn't sleep all night. I felt, with a severed nerve, how my brain mass was decomposing, how rot inhabited me, as if a plague of invisible insects were nesting in my skull, gnawing me from the inside. Cockroaches, worms, microscopic nits building their civilizations in the ruins of my thoughts. Maybe I was getting stupider. More than I imagine. Maybe stupidity has already caught up with me and has devoured my tongue, my hands, my eyes, more ideas. Maybe thinking is now just a memory, a useless memory of something I once was. But how to know? I just intuit it. And if I sense it, it must be true, right?

I feel a sting in my right eye, as if it had become the revolving door of a luxurious five-star hotel for viruses and bacteria. I break down, and I don't blame the system. I blame myself. It's easier, more immediate, more intimate, more normalized. I blame myself for every failure, for every carelessness, for every idea that breaks before becoming a word, for every word that disappears before being spoken. But if the world is a crime in itself, why should I settle for my fault?

There are days when I think about the end of the world. Not in a better future, not in the utopia that blind politicians promised us, but in the pure act of destroying everything, of erasing every vestige of what is already shitty, like a God fed up with his imperfect creatures. Didn't he do the same thing in the Old Testament? Didn't it sweep the Earth and start again? Maybe it's necessary. Maybe we should start again.

The afternoon swept me away with the heaviness of days in which time seems to have forgotten to move. ""Hello, Cortes. How are you?""

Silence. One hour and thirty-nine minutes of absence, pure suspense for me, who wanted to know how I was going to continue my work at Clarín, whether they were going to stay on board or whether they were going to throw me overboard.

Perhaps my message was diluted among the previous unanswered messages from Cortés, one more ghost in the digital tangle of my WhatsApp, that man always claimed to be busy, if it wasn't with his streaming program it was with making supposed ""scripts"" and any kind of strange excuse that I didn't understand, nor did I dare to ask either. Or maybe it was read and discarded, relegated to that limbo of pending responses that never arrive, he saw my messages only that he did not have the option enabled to see if he really saw them, marvelous implementation of the truth by digitality. ""What did you think of the two pieces of news I gave you?""

Nothing. The flashing ""Online"" cursor is the closest thing to a sign of life.

Four minutes later, I insist: ""How are we going to handle next week?""

Finally, the answer. A relief as brief as a breath of air before sinking back into the cold arctic waters.

—Good afternoon, Tales. How is it going?—, the bureaucratic tone of someone who responds out of commitment, without space for real conversation, a post-pandemic falsehood.

—I liked the one about the WHO. Not so with the PASO. Then I'll give you good feedback. The note is not bad, the approach is poorly developed—referring to the two previous news items from that week that I wrote and did not publish.

The focus. As if my words had failed in their purpose, as if the angle from which I looked at the story was twisted, out of focus, mutilated. That's how I felt. Maybe he is. Perhaps my very perception is a deformed aberration, a sick eye that does not know how to see.

And that only feeds the parasites more. I feel them move. Little accomplices of madness, building tunnels between my holes, eating my sanity at a pace I don't control. It's not insomnia. It's not anxiety. It is something older, more visceral, schizoid evolution.

But the worst thing is not the mental rot, nor the uncertainty of whether my texts are worth anything. The worst thing is the wait. The dead step between sending and response, between creation and judgment, between the luck of being read and the sadness of being ignored. I write so that no one publishes me, so that no one sees me, so that my name rots in a forgotten file.

I must learn to understand other people's clocks, they tell me. But I don't have that watch. Not a normal one, at least. Mine is unique. Its needles are teeth, its second hand is a blind white worm that advances without haste, eating the patience of those who know that they are impatient.

—Now I am very complicated producing today's stream program, but on the weekend, if you have time, we will have a good chat about how we continue.

A tacit agreement to postpone the inevitable. What if Saturday never comes? What if the chat is going to die where the messages have no realistic response?

—Okay, Cortes. Thank you. Yes, no problem. Don't worry—the automatic words of someone who already knows how this game works, the exploitation of the worker.

I write this here because if I write it down in my notebook, the desperation will become more present. More palpable. Because I know that, by occupying any space, no matter how tiny, I will be corrupting the purity of the empty, contaminating it with my uselessness.

Even if I erase every letter, the damage will already be done. The hole will have been violated. And even if the ink is erased, the scar of what was once there will remain: not something important, not something momentous, just something stupid. A stain on the nothingness of me.

02/10/2025:

At seven o'clock the video call began. An hour before, I was already practicing in front of the screen, rehearsing responses with my reflection. Narciso peeked out from the black glass of the monitor, and I looked at him with the same distrust with which one observes a beggar who looks too much like oneself.

Was he well dressed? Did it look professional? Did he look human? Or had I already become a substanceless avatar of Meta, a pixelated image?

The call was connected. Cortés appeared on the screen, with dark circles under his eyes from insomnia and a cigarette in his hand.

""I like the way you write,"" he said, the words appearing among the white smoke. But the latest news… I don't know. Something was missing. It was empty.

Empty. The word seemed like a diagnosis of death. Empty of what? Of information? Of content? In what sense? It hurt more than it should. It wasn't a rejection, it was a “I give you a 7, but not a 10.” He didn't banish me, but he didn't consecrate me either, he humiliated me.

I couldn't contain my nerves. The bomb fell on Hiroshima.

—Sure, I understand… —I paused, swallowed—. Sometimes I worry that ""flexible"" will end up making me earn less than I should.

Cortés lit another cigarette. He looked at me from his screen, exhaled the smoke with a patience resulting from the same boludization of nicotine.

—Do you have another problem with work?

—Beyond being afraid of making mistakes… I was always very nervous. I am terrified of criticism. Not to corrections, but to my words being modified until they become euphemisms.

Silence. Just the sound of the ember consuming tobacco.

""Then I like you,"" he finally said. I am the same. I can't imagine writing without smoking, if I stop smoking I will be dead. And I'm afraid of what they might say about something I did. We understand each other.

""We understand each other."" I clung to those two words like a castaway to a board. I tried to fraternize with a smile, although I only managed a grimace.

""I liked the work,"" I said, looking at his dark circles. It took me out of my comfort zone, it made me experience the environment...

I paused, not because I hesitated, but because the shock wave of the confession hit me suddenly.

—After this experience, I have thought about smoking again. Because I'm screwed.

Cortes smiled. But it was not a smile of mockery, nor of condescension. It was something more like the resignation of a man who has seen enough beginners.

—Welcome to journalism, it is impossible not to get stressed. Tomorrow, Monday, or Tuesday at the latest, you will be given your number.

I stopped for a moment after the call, as if a premonition warned me late that it was better not to answer. But there is no refuge in evasion. I looked at the black computer screen and there I was, my own reflection watching me with an ambiguous smile. I reminded myself that this present in constant march towards tomorrow was nothing more than a treadmill, we moved forward without moving from the spot. They talk to us about ""progress,"" but progress is nothing more than a mirage, a carrot dangling in front of us as we dehydrate in the desert.

Medicine advances, but not everyone makes progress; some die with wrong diagnoses, others without even having been treated. Human relationships evaporate before being consolidated, bonds do not resist the weight of time. We do not last, we do not endure, we do not live. Work is a punishment without a fixed sentence: flexibility means always being available, getting paid when they decide, receiving what they want to give you. “We always comply,” say the bosses. But when they do, you are already in infrapoverty, in the lowest stratum of dignity, where there is nothing left but to remain silent and be grateful.

In the black I still saw myself, but it was not me, but another failed replica of the same mass-produced human mold. One more product from the work catalogue, designed to be used and discarded. And the company? Abstract. Digital. There is no community, only interaction; there is no affection, only consumption, human waste. I occupy the same place in this society as an empty plastic bottle. I lost the last thing I had: full hope.

I thought about what Asma Mhalla wrote in Tecnopolitics. How technology turns us into soldiers, that technology locks us in echo chambers where everything sounds the same: the same opinions, the same terms, the same idols. A mental officialdom. A cabinet where only applause and confirmations are tolerated, not contrary criticism. The net ""is made of plastic and moves,"" but it does not breathe.

Society was once thought of as a living organism, a body with interdependent organs. Now it is a company, a holding company of atomized individuals, each floating in the uncertainty of their own financial destiny. And not only does it affect us economically—in my case, I still haven't seen the payment promised last Friday the 7th—but it disfigures our values, it tears away our sense of belonging. I haven't spoken to Rous in a while, and I wonder if that's a choice or just the inevitable reflection of this system.

Commitment and loyalty are no longer profitable assets. Instead, uncertainty and detachment have been elevated to virtues. Superficial relationships, chronic anxiety and, worst of all, the inability to imagine a collective organization with minimal certainties.

They have freed us from alienating routines, but in exchange they have condemned us to discontinuity. We float from one project to another without a coherent narrative, without a story that structures us. We no longer adapt to life, we adapt to the frenzy of the market, to capitalist realism, to the vertigo of the ephemeral. There is no fixed job, there is no fixed housing, there is no fixed salary. And if everything is transitory, then nothing makes sense, life is a plastic bottle.

That's why sometimes I miss the truth.

1j6avh0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Christianity/comments/1j6avh0/my_testimony_about_gods_provision_in_my_life_and/,My Testimony about God's provision in my life and my family's life,"God's really been looking out for my family and me, giving us so many second chances over the years. I just hope we don't waste them. Everything I've written about has actually happened to us, and there's even more that I can't remember. These amazing moments are listed in order, covering five decades from 1975 to 2025. I honestly believe that God takes care of us because I've felt it firsthand. Sure, a lot has happened to us, but when you think about it, fifty years is a long time in anyone's life or a family's journey.

 When I was a teenager, my family had a swimming pool. One summer day in 1975, I was swimming alone and decided to dive a bit too deep for the pool's depth. My chin hit the bottom with a loud click. It was scary to think my life could have ended right there, floating, or sinking in the pool, especially since I was alone. If I had been paralysed, I wouldn't have been able to get out.

 Around the end of Year 10 in 1975, my parents arranged for me to transfer to a new school to study Music, since my current school didn't offer it in Years 11 and 12. Even though I was outside the catchment area, I got into the new school. It was a relief because I was bullied in junior high, but that stopped at the new school. I got to study Music and avoid the bullies. It felt like everything fell into place, even though I wasn't in the catchment area.

 When I worked my butt off to get through Years 11 and 12, I scored high enough on my Higher School Certificate to get into Macquarie University, study History, and earn a Bachelor of Arts. Uni was a bit of a challenge at times, but I made it through and graduated.

 I met Jackie at this Christian Youth Group called Young Life, and we started dating. My mum, after just a couple of weeks, told me I should let Jackie know how I felt. So, one night a week later, I did just that. We went from being boyfriend and girlfriend to steady to engaged, all in one night, as I proposed to her. She said ""Yes,"" and I didn't even have a ring. I hadn't planned to propose that night; it just happened. I'd known Jackie for less than six weeks at the time. My mum encouraged me to follow my heart, not my head, 'cause Jackie had already captured my heart, and she still has it. Mums just know who's right for their kids.

 When my mum showed me an ad for a government job, I had just finished uni and was about to get married in less than two months. I landed the job, and even asked for leave without pay for my honeymoon during the interview. I ended up staying in that job for over eighteen years, and everything worked out fine once I started working and took time off for my honeymoon.

 We got married on December 5, 1981, and the very next day, we kicked off our honeymoon. As we headed to Forster, cruising north on the freeway from Hornsby, a woman in the lane next to us had a trailer. She flicked on her blinker and started merging into our lane, but we were in her blind spot. I tried to move over and slow down to give her room, but we were all moving at highway speeds, and she kept inching into my lane. I laid on the horn, and she finally noticed us just as I was about to hit the traffic safety barriers and a ditch on the side of the road. She quickly moved back into her lane. Talk about a wild start to married life!

 When we were newlyweds renting a unit in West Ryde, we got hit with a bill we couldn't pay. But then, it was amazing, a cheque showed up in the mail the day after we got that bill. It was just a couple of dollars short of the bill, but enough to get it paid. We had no idea the cheque was coming, but it saved the day!

 When we rented that unit, we asked if we could put a deadlock on the door. The real estate agreed, as long as we gave them a set of keys and left the lock on the door when we moved out. A couple of months later, all the units in the block got burgled, except for ours and one other. Out of twelve units, ten got hit, but the two that didn't both had deadbolts. One of those was ours. The other units didn't have deadlocks, just the same easy-to-break-into locks.

 When we had our first car, a green Holden HQ Kingswood sedan, someone stole it from the unit car park. Luckily, it was found later that day in Eastern Creek, though it was totalled. The police found the car without us having to wait months for the insurance company to decide about the payout if the car hadn't been found.

 We were renting in West Ryde, and it was time to renew the lease or move out. We hadn't decided yet, but then my parents told us they were off on a four-month overseas holiday. So, the decision was made for us—they asked us to house-sit. We didn't have much furniture, and they had a big downstairs room we could stay in, with a toilet and shower next to it. They prepaid all their bills, so we didn't have any to worry about. We got a place to live rent-free while they were away and for a couple of months after they returned.

 When we moved out of my parents' place, we rented a unit in Meadowbank for a year. During that time, and while living with my parents before, we saved up enough to put a deposit on another unit in Meadowbank. We paid off a small personal loan and bought the unit, leaving the rental market behind and stepping into homeownership with a mortgage.

After being married for six years, our parents started asking when we'd have kids. We hadn't really thought about it since we were busy with work, vacations, and often looking after my younger sibling, Chris. But then we decided to try for a baby. Surprisingly, after just six weeks, Jackie got pregnant, even after being on the pill for eight years, and carried Michelle to full term. Michelle was born with the help of forceps because she wasn't positioned right, but thanks to the doctor's skill, everything went smoothly.

Before Michelle was born, we realised how tough it would be to raise a baby in a top-floor unit without a laundry, especially since disposable nappies weren't a thing yet. So, we decided to sell the unit and buy a house. Wow, the unit sold the day we listed it, and we started house hunting. We found a house just in time and moved in before Michelle was born. It felt like there was planning that we found a buyer so quickly and a house at just the right moment, allowing us to move into our new home on the same day the unit sale was finalised.

 When we were shopping at Blacktown Westpoint with Michelle, who was just a year old, we had a trolley, a pram, and a package to manage while getting out of the lift. We pushed the pram out first, and then Jackie and I went back in to grab the rest. Suddenly, the lift doors closed on us, and it started moving up, leaving Michelle alone in her pram on the floor we just left. We rushed back down after the lift stopped on another floor and found Michelle surrounded by a bunch of sweet elderly ladies, all wondering where her parents were. Thankfully, Michelle wasn't alone for long and was safe with the ladies keeping an eye on her.

Then there was this time I hit a semi-trailer. The car was totalled because the whole front, from both front doors to the bumper, was crushed. I lost control on a wet road and slid across three lanes, unintentionally aiming for a telegraph pole. Instead, we hit the truck, and the impact pushed us back into our original lane, sparing us from wrapping around the pole. The car was written off by insurance. I was fine, but Jackie got whiplash, which she recovered from, and our two-year-old Michelle ended up with a buckle imprint from her car seat on her stomach. The insurance company replaced her car seat, and she was okay.

Years after the accident, we had another child, Marcus. If we hadn't survived that crash, Marcus wouldn't be here today. It's amazing to think about how everything worked out, with the truck being there stopped us from a worse disaster, and now we have Marcus in our lives. When we were trying for that second kid, months went by, and we started losing hope, thinking it might never happen. We stopped actively trying, and then, surprise! Jackie got pregnant after we had given up. That's how we ended up with our second child.

When our youngest, Marcus, was three, Jackie was doing housework and was home alone with him. She suddenly heard a voice in the room telling her to check on Marcus. No one else was there, but she listened to the voice. She went outside and found Marcus on the road! She quickly brought him back inside, keeping him safe from any cars.

Another time, we were on holiday in Dubbo and visiting a big op-shop. Our four-year-old, Marcus, wandered off like he usually does, but this time, he actually left the store without us knowing. My wife, daughter, and I searched for him inside but couldn't find him. We left the store and randomly turned left, not really knowing where he went. Luckily, we came across a couple, and the man was holding Marcus up in his arms. He told us he saw Marcus crossing the road alone and thought something was off since there were no parents around. So, he picked Marcus up and backtracked to find us. We were so relieved to be reunited with our son!

  When we were on holiday, driving back from Melbourne to Sydney, our kids were young. We stopped at a roadside rest stop with a toilet. Our older kid, Michelle, wanted to go, so off she went by herself. To my horror, I realized it was a pit toilet. I told my wife, Jackie, to run after her. Jackie got there just in time and managed to save Michelle from falling into the pit below the toilet seat. Luckily, Michelle had left the door open, so Jackie could grab her before she disappeared into the pit. It was a narrow escape!

When we were super broke, all we could afford to eat were sausages and mashed potatoes for weeks. Jackie talked to some folks at the church we were attending and mentioned how hard things were financially. Someone, and we never found out who, put an envelope with our name on it in the offering tray. It had $100 in it, which was a big deal back in the nineties. One of the church elders gave us the envelope, and it came at a time when we were really struggling.

Later, we left that church because Marcus, our kid with special needs, was a bit too much for them. He was the only special needs child there and had some behavioural issues. We found another church where Marcus was accepted for who he is. Jackie and I even went through adult baptism there. It was a place where Marcus and we felt welcomed and could acknowledge our faith.

 Back in mid-1999, after dealing with chest pain for what felt like forever, my wife finally convinced me to see a doctor. Turns out, my thyroid had gone rogue and was squishing everything in its path, including my windpipe and oesophagus. If it weren’t for my wife’s insistence, things could’ve ended badly once my windpipe closed up. Surgery was a close call too; the doc thought they might have to crack open my ribcage, but luckily, they managed to remove the thyroid through my neck, hiding the scar pretty well.

While waiting for the biopsy results at work, my wife Jackie called to say, ""There's no cancer."" At that moment, I swear I felt two hands on my shoulders, but when I turned around, no one was there. It was a surreal experience, feeling a touch when there wasn’t anyone there.

 When I saw a cat on TV twitching and moving around in its sleep, it was so active it actually fell off the coffee table it was lying on. The commentator said the cat had REM Sleep Behaviour Disorder, and I was like, “Hey, that’s me!” I've been having dreams where I get super active and end up falling out of bed while still asleep. After this happened a few times, I decided to hit up the hospital and see a sleep specialist. They did a sleep study and, surprise, I got diagnosed with REM Sleep Behaviour Disorder. The sleep doc started talking about Parkinson’s Disease and my short-term memory issues, which was a bit of a wake-up call. I stumbled onto a TV program while channel surfing, and it made me connect the dots between my sleep habits and the cat’s, leading to my diagnosis.

 Then there was this time when I had a nagging shoulder ache for ages, but I didn’t see a doctor 'cause, you know, I thought it’d just go away. Anyway, our church had a visiting healer for the first time, so I went up, sat in the chair, and didn’t even mention my shoulder. The healer didn’t ask either. They put some holy oil on my forehead, prayed over me, and laid hands on me. When I went back to my seat, I felt this burning hot circle right where my shoulder hurt. After a bit, the burning sensation faded, and I realized my shoulder pain was gone and never came back.

  When my wife, Jackie, had a series of mini-strokes, TIA’s, we already had two kids. The doctors said Jackie had to stop taking the pill immediately, and that I should get a vasectomy because a tubal ligation would be too risky for Jackie. Another pregnancy or childbirth could be life-threatening for her. So, I went ahead with the vasectomy, and we also went through counselling. The main thing was keeping Jackie safe and healthy. We made the right call with me getting the vasectomy. This way, Jackie is still with us, and I didn’t have to face raising our kids alone.

 When I had a shoulder ache that just wouldn't go away, I hadn't bothered to see a doctor because, you know, ""it'll be alright"" and all that. Anyway, at the church we were going to, they had a visiting healer for the first time. So, I went up to the front, sat down, and didn't even mention what was up with me, and the healer didn't ask either. They put some holy oil on my forehead, prayed over me with the laying on of hands, and then I went back to my seat. Suddenly, I felt this burning, red-hot sensation right where my shoulder had been hurting. After a bit, the burning feeling disappeared, and I realised the shoulder pain was gone and never came back!

 When my eldest kid, Michelle, was getting bullied in high school, Jackie and I decided to pull her out of that school system. We reached out to another school, even though we weren't in their catchment area. They accepted her, and she settled in nicely. The bullying stopped, and she made some solid friendships. Later on, one of the bullies from her old school joined her new one, but by then, Michelle had a strong group of friends who stood up for her, and the bullying was quickly shut down.

When our church closed because it wasn't viable, we found a new one where we all felt at home. Marcus, who has special needs, was warmly welcomed there. The congregation had been hoping for someone like Marcus to join, and he fit right in with us. It was a perfect match for our whole family.

I often enter competitions to win, this one was for  $1,000, and the community organisation I choose can win $10,000. I prayed  about it and nominated our new church. I entered over thirty times and ended up winning the $1,000, while our church got the $10,000. The timing was perfect, especially during the Global Financial Crisis, and it was a huge help for both us and the church.

 When Marcus was in Year 11, his high school tried to get him to sign out and leave for good, without coming back for Year 12. That would've been a bad move since the community program he was supposed to join was meant for folks who finished Year 12, not Year 11. Luckily, he found a spot at a special needs school for Year 12, which turned out to be his best school year ever. The new school was just right for him.

 When I was on holiday with my family in Melbourne, we got lost and parked on the side of the road. Out of nowhere, a truck came over the hill and hit our car. Fortunately, the only damage was to the driver's side mirror. It could've been way worse if the truck had been a bit closer. We were fortunate it wasn't a bad accident.

During the same holiday, we took a bus while our car was getting the mirror fixed. We were having a tough time calming Marcus down, and this kind lady came over and prayed for us. It was just what we needed. She said God told her to pray for us, so she did.

We renewed our wedding vows on our 30th anniversary in front of our church community. This time, unlike our wedding day, I got to kiss my wife, which I didn't get to do during our original ceremony. It was a beautiful way to show our commitment to each other by renewing such an important vow.

Once, Marcus and I got on a packed train, and I almost lost my grip on him while pulling him into the carriage. I could've left him behind. Thankfully, we stuck together because if Marcus had been left alone on the platform, I have no idea what might've happened.

 During a crazy thunderstorm, when the wind and rain were coming down hard, the eucalyptus tree in our backyard toppled over and landed on our house. It was a total widow-maker. I was in the bathroom under the tree and stayed safe, and Marcus was in the kitchen, also safe. Most of the tree's weight was in the trunk, which landed in the backyard, but a bunch of branches ended up on the house, reaching all the way to the front main bedroom.

When I first noticed some weird symptoms, I had no clue what was going on. So, I went to see a neurologist. They told me I have Parkinson's Disease and Mild Cognitive Impairment. Now that I know what's up, I can get the help and treatment I need. My symptoms finally make sense, and the type of Mild Cognitive Impairment I have only messes with my short-term memory and some thinking skills, not my long-term memory. Getting diagnosed made me realise what the sleep specialist had talked about years ago actually came true—I ended up with Parkinson’s Disease.

I was driving at 50 km/h when I went through an intersection with a stop sign, I didn't notice. I didn't realize it was an intersection until I heard another car honking like crazy. I should've stopped for them since they had the right of way. I glanced out my window and saw their car getting closer. We both swerved, but luckily, we didn't crash. I turned the wheel hard left, then right, to give us more space, and we missed both the car and a telegraph pole. The other driver stopped and talked to us, mentioning she had her mom and kid in the car. I had my partner and kid with me too. If we had collided, it could've been really bad for both families. But thankfully, we avoided it.

After that scare, I decided to stop driving once I got home. My neurologist and GP also told me to quit driving, and I know they're right. I’ve already stopped because I know I'm not safe on the road. I'm grateful we made the right call to stop. I’ve come to terms with the fact that my driving days are over, and I’m okay with it.

 When I finally got into the National Disability Insurance Scheme (NDIS) on my third try, it felt like the universe was telling me, ""Hang in there."" Now, I can finally get the support I need for my Parkinson's Disease and Mild Cognitive Impairment. It all happened at the perfect time, just when I was ready for it.

After being diagnosed with Parkinson’s and Mild Cognitive Impairment, my wife and I realised that as my condition worsened, it would be tough for her to take care of both me and Marcus, with his special needs. So, we decided to find Marcus a spot in a supported independent living share house. He loves it there, and it gives us peace of mind knowing he'll be taken care of both now and in the future.

I had a rough patch when I ended up in the hospital with Septic Shock from a nasty bacterial infection. It was from a bacteria called Proteus mirabilis, which I picked up from gardening. I got blood poisoning, ended up on life support, and was in a coma for three days. My heart was enlarged, my kidneys shut down, and I had a kidney stone blocking one of my ureters. Both my lungs got infected, and I was on dialysis. I was pretty out of it, with delirium that stuck around even after I woke up from the coma. I was contagious, so I spent ten days in isolation in the ICU. Visitors had to wear disposable gear to see me, and it all had to be tossed when they left.

 After my time in the ICU, I was moved to the general ward. Made it through without losing any limbs to sepsis, which is a relief since many people with sepsis end up needing amputations. Sepsis can be deadly, with about five thousand people in Australia dying from it each year. I managed to shake off the delirium, though I still remember some of the wild thoughts I had during that time. My wife, was there every single day of those sixteen days I spent in the hospital, catching four buses daily just to be by my side.

Before they diagnosed me with blood poisoning and sepsis, I was in a lot of pain. I had gone to the hospital earlier that week, where they took some blood and managed to culture it. This meant they could pinpoint the exact bacteria causing the infection and treat it effectively without resorting to broad-spectrum drugs. They emphasised how crucial it was for me to return for treatment, and I was in surgery that very night.

During a routine skin cancer check, the specialist found a basal cell carcinoma on my nose that I hadn't noticed. Thankfully, he was able to remove it all. If left untreated, it could have led to more serious facial surgery and reconstruction. Luckily, I didn't need any complicated procedures since they caught it in time.

 I went on a cruise with my dad, just the two of us, on the Majestic Princess from Sydney to Tasmania and back. We had a suite, and it was just before COVID-19 hit. Dad was still able to get around, even in his eighties, and we had such a wonderful time together. It was special to have that time with him before he passed away a couple of years later.

During the COVID era, when I visited him in the hospital, I was his only allowed visitor. On my way back to the train station, I rushed across a road even though the ‘Don't Walk’ sign was flashing. I shouldn't have crossed, and I ended up falling right in front of a bus. I'm not sure if the driver saw me fall, but fortunately, I managed to get up and hobble away with just a hurt elbow and a shoe that had fallen off. Thankfully, the red arrow for the bus stayed red while I was on the crossing. If it had changed, the bus could've started moving over me. A woman on the other side of the road called out to make sure I was okay.

 So, one day on another bus ride home, I was juggling two shopping bags in each hand. I couldn't hold onto the seat next to me or the hand straps from the ceiling because I didn't think to put the bags down, plus there wasn't really any space on the bus to do so. As the bus pulled away from the stop, I lost my balance and started falling toward a mom and her pram with two babies. I was in free fall and couldn't stop myself. Luckily, a person sitting behind me grabbed me by my belt and shoulder, pulling me upright just in time before I landed on the mom and her babies. I'm not exactly light since I'm on the heavier side, but they somehow found the strength and space to help me out. After that, someone offered me their seat, which was nice.

After my dad, Bruce, passed away, we had a funeral for him. Not long after, we went to clear out his unit since Mom had passed away a few years before. I discovered that Dad had kept a bunch of birthday, Christmas, and Father's Day cards we gave him as kids, tucked away in his bedside cabinet. I also started wearing his wedding ring from the day he passed. It was surprising to see how sentimental he was; I never expected him to be so sappy.

 When Marcus, decided to leave his group home without telling the staff, he hopped on a bus from Baulkham Hills to Rouse Hill all by himself. We were on holiday in Hobart, and the police called us. After that, we used his Opal card to track his movements since Marcus knows how to tap on and off. Opal helped us figure out where he went, so we contacted the police and the house staff with the info. The police found him at Rouse Hill Shopping Centre, hearing him before seeing him because he was talking loudly to himself. They turned a corner, and there he was. Rouse Hill Shops is spread over a large area, not your typical mall. Marcus was safe and found by the police and staff.

A couple of years after my dad passed away, my wife, Jackie, accidentally stepped on an old answering machine we didn’t use anymore since we switched to NBN and don't need a home phone. It started playing a message from my late dad, recorded when he was alive. We didn’t know it was there. In the message, Dad tells me not to worry and that he loves me. I realised I was meant to hear it when I needed to, so I recorded it on my computer. Now, I can listen to Dad whenever I want, though it reminds me of how much I miss him and sometimes makes me emotional. It’s been four years since he passed, but I’m not deleting the recording because it’s a piece of him. It hurts knowing that after Mom died, none of us, not even my siblings or I, could keep him going. He just wanted to be with Mom and stopped eating. Now they’re together. I found the message when I needed it, and Dad’s words are helping me through the grieving process.

 When Jackie passed out and went into a diabetic coma last Mother’s Day at Featherdale Wildlife Park, the 000 operator was super attentive. The first aid crew at Featherdale took care of Jackie while we waited for the ambulance. By the time the ambulance arrived, Jackie was out of the coma, but they took her to the hospital for observation and admitted her. After this scare, Jackie got serious about checking her sugar levels and managing her diabetes better. It was a real wake-up call for her.

A few weeks ago, a stray cat showed up at our doorstep without a collar or microchip. Jackie named him Max, and we've all fallen head over heels for him. It's been great having another cat to care for and share our home with, and Max has become a part of our family. He needs prayer though, for a good life as we’ve found out he has Feline Aids. He didn’t ask for that. If anything, it makes me love him more.

 This year, I've started using support workers to help me get to medical appointments and join in on social activities. It's a big change for me since I used to spend most of my time at home alone. Now, I'm getting out more and meeting new people.

Through everything that's happened to me and my family, I've always felt that God has been there for us, both in the good times and the tough ones. We've felt protected in so many ways—mentally, spiritually, physically, emotionally, financially, and even on the road during dangerous times. It's like God's always been there, especially when things could've gone really wrong. I don't think it's just luck; it feels like it's all been part of a plan. I'm also incredibly grateful for my wife, Jackie, who's always been there for me and our kids. I truly thank God for bringing us together.
