There is information on the profile that needs to be updated and I cannot update these until I am verified.

The weird thing is when I go through the support steps, it's saying that Im verified (see image).

Do you know what could be happening? I am super frustrated because the profile was generated by google, I would have rather just create it on my own vs. claiming it. Any help is appreciated!

I was wrong. I was dead wrong. So brought this heavy bitch home. Washed it. Dried it with a paper towel and whipped up a cinnamon streusel coffee cake. No extra seasoning on pan… just straight from the foundry. 

Just to show Lodge what a dumb idea this pan was, my first layer was streusel… with all that sticky brown sugar. 

Got it all layered up, popped it in the oven at 25 degrees lower than recipe called for and for an extra 10 minutes. 

Timer goes off… hmmm looks perfectly baked. Passes the toothpick test. Here we go. 

Let it sit for about 10 minutes, flipped it on parchment and lifted one edge expecting a total mess. Instead, I pulled a nearly perfectly clean pan off a perfect bundt coffee cake. A quick rinse with soap and water and here we are.

I love the energy, curiosity, open-mindedness and enthusiasm of younger women...Especially a woman who lacks the right kind of attention from younger guys. There is something incredibly sexy about a younger woman who craves new experiences and who is open to experimentation and who approaches it all with a positive attitude.

I am so glad there are younger women out there who crave an older experienced man…I have found that everyone of them I have spoken to love that an older man is interested in ""her"" pleasure as much as he is interested in his own -- Apparently younger men are more focused on themselves...and husbands don't always make you feel wanted.

I am a fun, discreet, educated, tasteful and attractive silver-fox gentleman who wants to intimately explore with you. I prefer soft and sensual over rough, but I find it arousing when my partner likes to have her hair pulled and to be used more rough when our collective passion builds;) I want you to feel safe, cared for, desired, excited, and satisfied. I am tall, slim, fit, hairy chest, nice equipment, and I have a warm, wet, savage tongue.

I am just wanting some fun conversation and to hear the sweet noises you make when we play…and when I make you cum. I promise that I will leave you feeling sexy all over and with no regrets. It will be our sexy secret🤫

I live in western CT but travel regularly all over CT, western MA and upstate NY for my business😉

1ggtb4u,https://www.reddit.com/r/ChildfreeIndia/comments/1ggtb4u/monthly_thread_for_childfree_indians_seeking/,Monthly Thread for Childfree Indians Seeking Friendships,"Hi, CFI!

Welcome to our Monthly Friendship Thread, where childfree Indians can connect and build friendships. Whether you're looking for friends in your city or online, this is the place to be!

You can also connect more organically in [CFI's only official chat channel](https://chat.reddit.com/room/!QjYaQOe1QEW4oYdhE8OxMg%3Areddit.com)—already home to over 1,800 members! Struggling to join? Shoot a DM to any mod.

*Processing gif b668qgdhaqvd1...*

A Few Things to Note:

1. **No CF4CF**: 'CFI Friendships' threads are for those seeking only platonic friends, either IRL or online. This is not the place to seek romantic interests; for that, you can create CF4CF posts on Sundays instead. If you spot any lovebirds in the wrong nest, feel free to give us a heads-up! **Stay Safe!** Use common sense and caution when talking to any stranger online.

1. **DM Etiquette:** By commenting here, you agree to be open to DMs from those seeking CFI friends (strictly platonic, unless you also post a CF4CF). Unsolicited dating or creepy messages will lead to a ban and a report to Reddit admins.
2. **Share About Yourself:** Help others get to know you better. Share your age, hobbies, city, gender (though our TwoX comrades might want to be cautious due to unsolicited attention). 
3. **Posting Flexibility:** Feel free to create posts outside of this thread to seek childfree Indian friends - use our new post flair 'CFI Friendships'. The CF4CF rules don’t apply to friendship seekers, so you can post any day, in any format, as long as you follow the other rules of CFI (see the sidebar for rules).
4. **City-Based Groups:** There are various city-based CF groups (none affiliated with this subreddit) on Telegram, Discord, WhatsApp, or Facebook. Give those a try too!
5. **Meetups:** We encourage you to join or host a city-wide CF meetup if you can.

Examples:

* *""Hey CFI, It's Keanu here (yes, the one and only), dodging diapers like I dodge bullets in The Matrix. Living in Mumbai these days and looking for pals to ride motorcycles with or discuss philosophy over coffee. Drop a DM if you're into low-key hangouts and high-key debates!""* 
* *""Greetings, CFI! Bruce here from Gotham. By night, I fight crime; by day, I'm just your average billionaire. Into tech, martial arts, and nocturnal expeditions. Seeking fellow night owls who appreciate justice, complex gadgets, and the occasional brooding on rooftops. If you're up for discussing philosophy or the ethics of vigilante justice over coffee, let's connect over DM.""*
* *""Hello CFI! It's Vidya Balan here, loving life and breaking stereotypes one role at a time. I'm all about deep conversations and meaningful connections, but for now, I'm keeping things virtual. Not quite ready for in-person meetups—think of it as the interval before the big finale. If you're into thoughtful chats and connecting from the comfort of your own space, let's link up over DM!""*

Will had left about 5 minutes ago and Olivia and I had just been sitting in her apartment in silence. Olivia had a boyfriend this whole time and I didn’t know. I mean how did she keep this secret? How did I not know? My head started spinning as I moved over next to her on the couch.

	“How could you not tell me this? We tell each other everything,” I said.
	She looked bashful and said, “I don’t know. I just didn’t want it to get in the way of our friendship.”
	“Well it wouldn’t have if you had just been transparent with me.”
	“I wasn’t sure how you would react.”
	“Well honestly, I’m shocked to say the least.”
	“Why? You’re not my boyfriend. I don't need to tell you everything.”
	“But we do, that’s the thing. We do tell each other everything. You’re my best friend.”
	“You’re my best friend too.”
	“Okay well why didn’t you tell me.”
	“I already told you why. Besides, I only see him when he’s in town. We’ve grown more distant.”
	“Then why bother keeping him around? I mean he sounds like a frat boy, this isn’t you at all.”
	“Oh what do you think you know me better than I know myself?”
	“Yes, sometimes I think I do. Sometimes I feel like we’re the same person. I see myself in you.”
“We’re not at all.”
“Unbelievable. I mean seriously. I trusted you and you’ve been keeping secrets behind my back.”
	“Okay this is exactly why I didn’t tell you. You really want to know why I didn’t tell you? It’s because you’re prone to freaking the fuck out over small shit.”
	“You really have no room to talk. Tell me why.”
	“What?” She seemed confused, “that is the reason why.”
	“No really tell me why.”
	“I don’t know what you’re talking about”
	“It’s because we have something special. I mean I’ve never felt this way about someone else and you’ve never felt this way about anyone else either, and I know that for a fact because you told me.”
	“Maybe I was just saying that to make you happy.”
	“Quit lying to yourself. I mean we are friends. I'm not saying we’re anything more than that, but obviously you felt some type of way about having a boyfriend and the relationship we have at the same time. How long have you known him?”
	“Since freshman year of College. We met during a class and I didn’t know anyone else in this town. So we got close, and then he asked me to start dating him. And I didn’t want to say no because I was afraid I would lose him.”
“So he pressured you into it.”
“Well no, I really did like, I mean I do really like him.”
“Do you love him?”
“Yes. You should just get to know him. You would like him. He doesn’t need to get in the way of us and he’s only here for Winter break. He transferred to a school down the mountain for his sophomore year so he’ll go back eventually but for the next couple weeks Will is going to be in our lives.”
I felt betrayed. She had acted as if I had saved her life. As if I was the one who was there for her and meanwhile there was someone else. Was she going to do the same thing to me as she did to Will? Just bring me along and then push me to the side. I lost it slapped Olivia, “There’s not going to be anyone else in our lives! There can’t be! You need me!”

“Don’t do this!” She yelled. I punched her this time. She fell back into a Peace Lily and the vase shattered. She cut her back on the broken ceramics. She looked at me, her nose bleeding and blood in her teeth. She spat blood on the floor and said, “I’m not caving. Will isn’t leaving, I love him.” 

I stormed out of her apartment and slammed the door behind me. I was livid. Olivia needs to cut all the distractions out of her life and just focus on herself. I’m the only one that can help her. She doesn’t need this guy adding more stress to her life. I went home and slept. The next day I woke up to police at my door.

“Hello Dave Whitlock, we'd like to speak with you. May we come in?” said the police.
“No you’re fine right there,” I said. I had dealt with enough cops to know what to do and not to do.
“We heard a complaint from a neighbor of Olivia Winkleman. Said she heard fighting and saw her looking pretty beat up the next day.”
“I don’t know anything about that.”
“Well last month we also heard a complaint from a professor about you. They thought you may have assaulted Ms. Winkleman. Any thoughts on why they might have said that?”
“No idea, she took an awful tumble on some ice poor thing.”
“You don’t fool us for a second Mr. Whitlock. We know your past track record when it comes to how you treat the women in your life. If you weren’t a minor you wouldn’t have gotten off so easily.”
“I’m offended right now that you think I would lay my hands on Olivia. I would never do anything to hurt her. I’m done talking,” I closed the door in their faces.

I went over to Olivia’s to ask her if the police had said anything to her.

“Olivia -” I said as I walked in but I saw Will was already there with her, “Oh hey Will.” They sat on the couch together. Olivia with her face bruised and swollen and Will looking calm and nonchalant. 
“Hey Dave,” Will said, “quite a fall Olivia had huh.”
“Oh god what happened?” I said
Olivia lied through her teeth, “I fell down some stairs.” She lied for me. She cared too much to risk losing me. She could have easily told Will and got his undivided support. She had done this for me and I needed to repay her. Later I texted her that I promised I would get along with Will for her.

It started off with us all hanging out together at her place and it continued through most of winter break. The day before Christmas Eve I invited Will on a hike. I decided I would take him to Rocky Ridge, the same place I brought Olivia. It was just me and him. We met up at the parking lot, got out, and started the trail.

“Hey man thanks for inviting me, it's beautiful out here,” Will said while looking around at the rhododendron and spruce trees.
“Yeah, this is kind of my happy place. When I have a lot on my mind I like to come out here and just take everything in,” I said.
“You know I’m really glad you met Olivia.”
“Why do you say that?”
“You just make her so happy. And I haven’t been around as much since we go to different schools now. All we basically do is text and every now and then we FaceTime. I visit when I can but that’s typically only during breaks and holidays. I’ve just been so busy, but I still love her. I want her to be okay, and she doesn’t tell me as much as she used to but she does talk about you a lot.”
“What type of stuff does she say?”
“How you take her out places, talk with her when she’s not feeling good, just make her happy all around.”
“Well that’s really sweet. I try to be there for her. I know she doesn’t have many people,” I said. Will looked kind of sad and stared down. “Not that you aren’t there for her, I didn't mean that.”
“No it’s okay, I really haven’t been. I mean I love Olivia and I care about her, but I also have my own future to worry about and this school is where I need to be. But that’s why I’m so glad she has you. You know me and Olivia were going to go to a party tomorrow night. It’s a Christmas party at my friend's house. It’s super high class though, not casual at all. He lives in like a mansion with his parents and they’re out of town. You should come through it would be fun.” 
“Yeah I’d love to go.” We continued to talk until we made it to the summit. Once you get to the top the trees open up and there’s a clearing with a rocky ledge. 
Will walked over to the ledge and said, “wow, I can’t believe I never knew about this spot. You can see so far out.” He walked closer to the ledge. I followed up behind him. I thought about doing it, pushing him off. I could just get Will out of my life for good right now. I creeped up even closer behind him. I grabbed him “Hey man, what are you doing?!” Will said. You could hear the fear in his voice.
“You’re standing too close, I didn’t want you to fall,” I said while letting go of him. I had thought of a better idea. 

I would never push him off, I wouldn't kill another man, I’m not a monster. I’m a good guy, I’ve just made some mistakes. We all make mistakes. Some of the best people in history have all been flawed. Martin Luther King Jr. and Gandhi had their flaws and are still some of history’s greatest people to ever live. Will looked nervous but eventually blew it off as just something weird because he didn’t seem to say anything else about it. We walked back to our cars and headed on our ways. Later I got a text from Will with the address to the party. I planned to go over to Olivia’s, but on the way over I stopped at a dress store. I picked out a beautiful white dress. It was a ball gown with floral accents that flowed down the dress and off the shoulder sleeves. I kept it in a bag in my car and went to her place. I walked in and it was just me and her.

“Finally we have some time alone,” I said.
“Yeah, are you finally starting to come around to Will? How was the hike?” Olivia asked.
“It was good. There’s something I need to talk to you about though.”
“What is it?”
“Will said he doesn’t want to be with you anymore.”
“What? Why?”
“He said he just doesn’t love you anymore and it’s too hard having a long distance relationship.”
“No, no,” she looked queasy but then her face turned to anger, “you’re lying! You’re lying to my face right now! Will would have told me himself. He wouldn’t have confided that in you. He doesn’t know you like that.”
“Olivia, when have I ever lied to you?”
“Right now you are.”
“Why don't you believe me? I’ve done so much for you.”
“Because you’re selfish. You just don’t want me to have anyone else in my life, you want me all to yourself.”
“That’s not true. You think so little of me Olivia. Can’t you thank me for once, just for once.”
“I do!” She burst out, “I devote so much of my time and energy to being a good friend to you it’s exhausting. Will doesn’t treat me this way!”
“Don’t compare me to Will! That cocky asshole.”
“I’m done with you!”
I grab her arm and yell, “No you’re not!” She shakes me off and runs to the kitchen. She grabs a kitchen knife and points it at me.
“What are you going to do? Stab me?” She thrusts the knife at me and I grab her wrist. I squeeze it as hard as possible until she drops the knife. She screams in pain. I had to defend myself. “Haven’t I been good to you?” I grabbed her and threw her to the ground, “I do so much for you!”
“Please Dave no!” I knelt down and punched her. “Please Dave I’m sorry!” She began to cry. I punched her again. She looked at me, her brow was busted and blood ran down her face. I started to kick her. At first in the stomach. I heard a crack, and then I started to kick her in the face. She spat up blood and yelled, “Please, please Dave I’m sorry don’t hurt me anymore just don’t hurt me. Don’t hurt me!” She began to sob, “I’m sorry oh I’m so sorry.” I wind my leg back for another kick and then she yells, “I love you please no! I just want you to love me!” I hear a knock at the door.
I hear a voice from an old woman say, “what’s going on in there?” 
I told Olivia, “Don’t say anything.”
“Do I need to call the police!” Said the old woman
“Tell her everything is okay,” I said to Olivia.
“Everything is alright,” said Olivia trying not to show her emotions.
“Are you okay?” The old lady yelled.
“Tell her you’re fine,” I whispered.
“Yeah I’m okay,” said Olivia.
“Are you sure?” Said the old woman.
“Yes, just give me some privacy,” said Olivia.
“Tell Will to come over right now,” I told Olivia. 
“I can’t reach it. I can’t… move.” I grabbed her phone. She had told me her password already so I grabbed it and called Will. I put the phone up to Olivia.
Will answered the phone, “hey, what’s going on?”
“Tell him to come over. Tell him to come over right fucking now,” I whispered.
“I need you to come over as soon as possible,” she said while weeping.
The old lady yelled from outside the door, “I’m calling the police.” I heard her walk into the apartment next door. I ran outside into my car and waited watching Olivia’s door. I saw Will’s car pull up and he walked into her apartment. I kept watching, about 10 minutes passed and I heard sirens. Police parked into the spot right next to me. They didn’t notice me. I saw them walk up to the apartment and Olivia opened up the door. I saw them talking and then they walked in. 5 minutes later I watched as they dragged Will out of the appartment in handcuffs.
“Olivia, what’s going on? Why did you say that? I love you Olivia, please don’t do this. Oh my god,” yelled Will.
“Shut up,” said one of the cops.
 They brought him to the police car. They opened the door and then slammed his head against the rim of the car door. He looked over and saw me through my car window.
“You, this was you Dave! Oh god I promise this wasn’t me.” They slammed the door to the cop car and drove off. 

I knew Olivia would lie for me because she loves me. I waited an hour just sitting in my car before going back into Olivia’s. The adrenaline felt great. I grabbed the bag with the dress and walked into her apartment, Olivia sat in the corner of the kitchen with her head down, hair covering her face, crying.

“Oliva, I’m sorry,” I said.
“It’s okay,” she said. I walked up to her and brushed her hair out of her face.
“I love you.”
“I love you too.”
“Come on let’s get you cleaned up.” I helped her up off the ground and brought her to the bathroom. I started getting the water warmed up in the shower but not so hot that it would burn. A goldilocks temperature. I turned away from her as she took off her clothes. I wanted to give her privacy. She closed the shower curtains and sat on the shower floor rinsing the blood off herself. Once she was done she turned off the water and I handed her a towel. She came out of the shower with the towel on. “I have something I want you to try on.” I showed her the dress I bought.
“Oh Dave, it's beautiful.”
“Will told me about the party. Would you like to go with me tomorrow?”
“But I can’t go looking like this. I mean I can’t cover this up with makeup.”
“You still look beautiful to me.”
“You really think so?”
“Of course.” She came over and hugged me. She squeezed me tight.

The next night was Christmas eve and we went over to the party. The house was a really big Victorian style house. I was wearing a black suit with a red tie and she wore the white dress. We walked through the front doors. The house had a wide open ball room as soon as you walk in with a crystal chandelier hanging down. Butlers handed out champagne on trays. Windows line the walls with a lamp under each one. There was an oriental rug leading down from the front door down the whole room. There were people everywhere but as we began to walk down the rug people cleared the way for us and stared. They made faces of disgust and pity.

“They’re all staring at us,” said Olivia.
“Don’t worry about them,” I said.

We continued to walk down with our arms locked as everyone stared. She was my battered princess. My painting. My everything. My reflection.




























4.
	I stood on top of Rocky Ridge all by myself. I was on top of the world. I had got rid of Will and he took the fall for all of it. He was the abusive boyfriend who beat his girlfriend. The story sold perfectly. Plus I had Olivia all for myself and she loved me. Spring semester started and I moved in to her apartment. She would make breakfast for me each morning. I would sit down, drink my coffee with my breakfast, and look out the window. As days went by I started to notice this silver Toyota Camry that would show up in the parking lot. Whoever was driving it would just sit there for hours with the car turned on. While I was driving to class the car would follow me. They wouldn’t park in student parking but somehow they always managed to find their way back behind me on the way back from classes. They would park in the same spot at Olivia’s apartment and then at 10:00 every night the car would drive away. I became increasingly paranoid. I didn’t want to go to the cops though because I didn’t trust them either, and I didn’t want to draw any more attention towards me.

It was a monday and I got back to Olivia’s from a long day of classes. There were still dishes in the sink and my plate from breakfast was still on the table. Olivia was nowhere to be seen. I sat down on the couch and waited for her as it became dark outside. She finally came inside, she stood with her back to the door.

“Olivia, where the hell were you?” I said
“I was out,” she said.
“You tell me when you go out from now on because this is embarrassing. Me coming home and you just gone.”
“I was going on a walk okay. I need time to get get away from this. You go on your hikes I’m trying to start doing something.”
“Okay well stop. How am I supposed to know if you’re okay.”
“I can take care of myself.”
“You obviously can’t. Do I need to bring up the time I saw you with your wrists slit?”
“That was because of you!”
“I do so much for you!” I yelled while slapping her. As she stood in front of the door I looked out the window and saw the Camry. Why was this person watching me and Olivia? Why were they following me and what did they want?

The Camry kept watching everyday until one night Olivia had to go to bed early because she had a test in the morning. The grandfather clock struck 10:00 and I saw as the Camry began to turn around and head out. I grabbed a knife and ran out to my car. I started it as fast as I could and began tailing the Camry. I didn’t know who this person was. Were they a threat to me and Olivia? I won’t let anyone get in the way of us. It doesn’t matter who they are. I stayed back 5 car lengths and locked onto their speed. I followed them. I was expecting to see them turn off into a neighborhood any minute now but they kept driving, all the way down the mountain.

It started raining, spring showers, and I continued following them. We entered the nearest city and I finally saw them turn off into the suburbs. They parked in front of a 2 story house, and a man in a dun suit got out of the car and walked inside. I parked across the street. The lights were on in the house and I could see the curtains to the living room through the windows of the house. Bushes lined the front of the house. I got out of my car with the knife and crouched over to one of the bushes. I hid behind it and listened. I heard yelling and saw two silhouettes over the curtains.
“I would say there’s dinner in the fridge but why even bother when you’re never around!” A woman's voice yelled.
“I put food on this table what am I supposed to do just quit,” the man responded
“I don’t know but you better figure something out ‘cause I’m this close to taking jr and leaving,” I heard a baby start crying, “oh look what you did now.”
“I walked into the door to you yelling how are you going to blame this on me?”
“Because you’ve pushed me to this point!”
“Fuck this, I’m going to get beer.”
“Yeah, walk away. Just like you always do!”

The rain began to pick up and I was soaking wet at this point. The man walked out right beside me and unlocked his car but didn’t see me. He didn’t hear me as well as I walked up behind him. He put his hand on the handle of the Camry and I put the blade of the knife up to his neck.
“Don’t move,” I said.
“Okay man what do you want? Do you want money? I have my wallet in the car,” said the man.
I dragged him by the collar of his shirt with my knife to his neck. He sedulously walked with me trying not to get cut. I threw him in the backseat and sat beside him still holding the knife up to him.
“Who are you?” I said.
“My name is Richard Fischer. Look I don’t know what you want like I said I have money in my car, if you would just let me get it,” he said. Then he took a closer look at me, “Dave?”
“How do you know who I am?” I put the blade closer up to his neck.
“Look, I'm a private investigator. I was hired by someone to take a look into you. Okay it’s nothing personal.”
“What do you want to know about me and Olivia? Who hired you?”
“I can’t say.”
 I screamed, “who the fuck hired you! Why are you watching me?”
“It was the Carter family okay!”
“What do they want to know? What do you know?”
“I just started, man all I see is you going to school and home.”
“You’re lying, you've been watching for over a month now!”
“Okay, okay, just don’t hurt me!” It reminds me of how Olivia sounds, it made me kind of sad. “I know you beat your girlfriend, the rest is just speculation.”
“Olivia’s not my girlfriend and why would you say I hurt her? What type of speculation?”
“Look man I know, alright I’ve got pictures from the other night. I’m telling the truth now. They told me that you beat her and premeditated a framing on their son.”
“Will?”
“I know you have a past criminal record that’s sealed to the public because you were a minor. Look, that's all I know.”
“You know too much.” I dragged him out of the car over to the trunk. “Get in.”
“Please don’t do this.”
“Get in the fucking trunk.”

He reluctantly got in and I slammed it shut. I had no choice. He had evidence to put me away and I couldn’t be away from Olivia. She can’t live without me. I went to his car and found a camera and a 10mm. I grabbed them and went back into my car. I put them in the passenger's seat and started heading back up the mountain with Richard in the trunk. It started pouring rain. My windshield wipers couldn’t keep up with the rain. I looked in my rear view mirror to make sure no one was following me and then I looked at myself. What was I doing? Was I really falling back into old habits? No, I’m not going to give up on me and Olivia. I can’t let this get out or they might separate us. I won’t let anything keep us apart. I heard a truck horn and saw headlights in front of me. I swerved and felt a bump and then the crash of metal. I had hit a guard rail and was stuck in a ditch. Then I saw headlights turn around and come towards me. The same truck drove back over and parked over me and my car in the ditch. A husky man in a trucker’s hat came out and walked up to my car.
I cracked my window and he said, “are you okay? Need some help?” I heard banging from the inside of the trunk and muffled screams. I was absolutely fucked. 
“Everything’s alright, I got it,” I said.
“You sure? Were you the only one in the car?” He must have been far enough away to not hear Richard over the pouring rain.
“Just me, yeah I’m okay. I don’t need any help. I got it.”
	“You look pretty stuck to me.”
“No seriously, I think I can just back out.”
“You sure? I got ratchet straps in the truck.” He walked closer towards my car.
“Seriously man, I'm fine.”
“What’s that noise?” He started walking towards the trunk.
“No it’s nothing.” I got out of the car and grabbed the gun.
You could hear the muffled yelling of Richard, “Help me! I’m in the trunk, help! Somebody Help!”
“Stay right there!” The man said while pointing at me. He didn’t see in the dark that I was holding the 10mm. He focused in on the trunk and walked towards it. I really had no choice once he opened the trunk and looked down at Richard. I put the gun to the back of the man’s head and pulled the trigger. There was a deafening bang and brains sprayed all over me and Richard.
My ear’s rang as I heard Richard say, “Fuck, oh fuck you you just killed him! Oh my god he’s dead. Jesus christ.” 

Richard got out of the truck and started running. He threw up on the ground and I ran after him. I grabbed him. He struggled and kicked but I hauled him back over and tossed him in the trunk. I stepped over the dead body of the truck driver and got into the driver’s seat of my car. I put it in reverse and cut the wheels. My tires just spun and I wasn’t moving. Eventually after turning the wheels at the right angle I was able to back out of the ditch.

This wasn’t part of the plan. If I get pulled I’m fucked I’m covered in blood and have a person alive in the trunk. I just have to finish this out with no more slip ups. I continued up the mountain. I made my way up the winding turns trying not to slide on the road. Eventually I made it back into my home town, but I kept driving. I started going to the woods. I got to the Rocky Ridge parking lot and shut off the car. I went over the trunk with the gun and could still hear Richard banging from the inside. I opened it up and pointed it at him. I pulled him out, grabbed him by his collar, and pushed the gun up to the back of his head. I lead him up the trail. It was exhilarating holding another man’s life in my hand. It was dark and we could barely see. Richard kept slipping on rocks.
He said, “I can’t fucking see shit man where the hell are you taking me.”
“Just keep walking,” I said. We eventually made it to the top of Rocky Ridge. Richard looked over and saw the ledge.
“Oh what the fuck man please don’t do this!”
“Jump”
“No I’m not fucking jumping you have a gun pointed at my head I’m going to die either way.”
“You’re going to jump.”
“You’re fucking crazy. Look I didn’t want to say it but I know. I got access to your file. You grew up without a father and killed your abusive mother. She beat you so you got off easy. But still, what type of sicko kills their own mother!”

I pushed him off the ledge. He didn’t scream while he fell. It was silent except for the rain until I heard the thud from below. I just couldn’t stand to hear him say it. It’s something I try my best to forget about. Maybe that’s why I’m so drawn to Olivia. We share the same struggles. I see a lot of myself in Olivia. Looking at her is like staring into a mirror. Everywhere I go I’m haunted by my past. I see people with happy families and then I look at myself, but with Olivia I can finally relate to someone. She needs a protector in her life and I’m there to fill that role.

I went down the trail and headed back to Olivia’s apartment. It was 3:00 in the morning. I opened the door and made sure I was quite enough to not wake up Olivia but I saw the light turn on from the bedroom.
“Dave, is that you?” Said Olivia
“Yeah it’s me,” I said. She walked out of the bedroom.
“What’s that all over you? What’s going on?” Her eyes began to tear up as she looked at my clothes covered in blood.
“It’s okay everything’s okay.”
“Is that blood? Dave what’s going on?” she was crying at this point.
“Olivia it’s nothing don’t worry about it just go back to bed.”
“Are you hurt? Please tell me you’re okay”
“I’m fine okay.”
“Then why is there blood all of you this isn’t okay I’m scared.”
“Don’t be, just go back to bed.”
“Did you hurt someone?”
“No I just-“ I paused, I had no excuse, “just trust me Olivia. Leave it alone okay.”
“I just want everything to be okay. I just want life to feel normal.”
“It can be. Look I’m here for you and I love you. So much.”
“I love you too” 

She buried her head into my shoulder and I wrapped my arms around her. She looked up at me. Olivia will always have my back. She’s there for me, and I need her. She’s what’s been missing in my life. She’s all I need. I reached down and grabbed her thigh.

“Dave? What are you doing?” Olivia said.
“Don’t you love me?” I said
“Yeah but that doesn’t mean I want to fuck you! Stop!” I didn’t stop “Dave I said stop!” We had sex. I got up and started to walk away from her as she cried.
“Fuck you you fucking asshole I hate you!” Olivia said
“Olivia how could you say that I love you. Do you know how much that hurts me?” I said.
“Hurts you? Hurts you! What about all you’ve hurt me? What about all the times you punched me or slapped me or kicked me. And I put up with it. For what? For you to rape me!”
“I thought you wanted it?”
“No I didn’t fucking want it! Stop fucking around okay. Be a real human being for once.”
“I am being myself.”
“Then you’re too far gone.”
“Olivia I love you.”
“No you fucking dont! You love the image of me you created in your head. You love what you see in me. You love yourself.”

I wasn’t even mad at Olivia. I turned around and walked towards the door as she cried. Leaving her with nothing but bloody sheets and broken memories. I must have gazed into the abyss for too long, because it was clear to me now that Olivia didn’t need me anymore. I put the key in the ignition and got onto I-40. I was headed out west. I had to just leave it all behind. I looked up out from the window going 70 on the highway, and I didn’t see my reflection in the windshield - just the dark night sky.

1ggt5e5,https://www.reddit.com/r/DollarGeneral/comments/1ggt5e5/i_get_tired_of_dumb_customers/,I get tired of dumb customers,"Today I was yelled at by two different women because they weren't trying to listen to explanations. It's Halloween don't be actual Karens wtf.

Lady one had a Generic Authorization Decline. I told her that it had something to do with her bank. (I looked it up in front of her) I told her that she needed to contact them. She left and came back with cash and screamed at me that she pulled money perfectly fine from the ATM and screamed at me for wasting her time. I told her calmly again that the Generic Authorization Decline has something to do with her banking. That no one else had this problem while she was gone. She wanted me to give her the receipts for the voided transaction because she used her card. It didn't go through but she still wanted the receipt for it.  She also wanted me to get someone who ""knew how to do their fucking job, because I was making her late."" Ma'am, I already asked the Manager while you were gone and she also said that we cannot force your card to work. Idk the items she got weren't even like I need them right now items so it was just random stuff mostly home decor and value Valley cleaning stuff and she was in the store for at least 30 minutes. I'm not sure how I made her late to whatever, but sure blame me.

Lady 2 decided to buy 4 Coke 1 liters at $1.85 a piece. She argued with me that something was wrong with my computer, and it should be less than $6. I was so confused that I asked if she meant to only get 3. Nope, she meant to get 4. She even said the price to me so I was so confused. I told her that the price was right and she screamed at me that when she was in school 1.85x4 equals less than 6. I had to take out my phone did it on the calculator and showed her the price was right. She then screamed at me that she could get it cheaper at Dollar Tree. Okay and? Go there like don't have to stand here wasting our time screaming at me. I smiled all through it took off 2 of the cokes and they went on telling me I was worthless and it's cheaper elsewhere so I wasted their money.

Guys I promise I was in a great mood today. I dressed up, I smiled. I was friendly with everyone. I drank like 2 coffees and an energy drink and was energetic. Why did two people have to try to ruin my day within the first couple hours of my shift wtf. This isn't a uncommon occurrence in our store though.",2,1730420518.0,DollarGeneral,2,0.67,False

Best I ever had were at Psistaria in Lincolnwood but they took them off the menu years ago. Better than Les Francais. I’ve cooked liver many times but not sweetbreads.

Instead? I’m crammed into a hot tiny space, barely able to breathe, trying not to pass out while typing this. 

For reference, this all started when the girls trip we talked about in the group chat finally became a reality. You see my friends Callie, Genevieve, and I, Elenor (Ellie for short) are hardcore Halloween fans. Anything horror related, spooky, paranormal, you name it- we eat that shit up. Fall is our favorite time of year. So, as a reward for our hard academic work this semester and passing exams, the three of us saved up and pitched in for a trip to New Orleans, Louisiana. The most haunted city in the United States of America. The best part? Our trip would take place the week of Halloween.

Exciting right? *Wrong.*

It should’ve been, but it didn’t turn out that way. For me at least. I don’t know where my friends are or what they’re doing. All I can do is hope that they’re not stuck in the same sick and twisted game as me. 

Sorry, I’m getting ahead of myself. Let me explain.

Last night, the second night of our trip,  some local told us about The Seeker’s Game. Our Air BnB was in the French Quarter which is home to Bourbon street, where the party never ends. We’d been bar hopping and partying all night dressed as the Powerpuff Girls. Callie was Blossom, Gen was Buttercup, and I was Bubbles. 

It was pretty late in the night when we stumbled into this bar. It was mostly empty with just the three of us, the bartender, and The Local occupying the space. 

After our first round of shots, Gen started lamenting about how she wanted to see something *really* spooky. We’d been on a couple ghost tours already, but nothing was really hitting the spot, ya know?

Callie and I agreed, clinking our shot glasses together before ordering another round of drinks. That’s when The Local stepped in.

“So you want to see something scary eh?” A Creole accented voice asked ominously from a booth in the corner. 

The three of us gave each other “the look” before bursting out into a fit of giggles. We went back to drinking, brushing the man’s interruption off. Then he got up from his booth and started making his way towards us at the bar, a whiskey sour in hand. 

The Local was an older, skinny black guy. He walked with a bamboo cane to help with his limp.  One of his eyes was blind, a cataract causing his retina to look pale blue and clouded. A salty goatee cascaded down his chin in the shape of a V. 

“You should play The Seeker’s game then.” He slammed his glass on the bar, causing the three of us to jump in fright. This garnered a little chuckle out of him as he took his seat on a barstool. 

“T-the Seeker’s Game?” I asked, shakily taking a sip of my drink. He’d definitely grabbed our attention now. “What’s that?”

The Local grinned with a glimmer of mischief in his good eye. “Oh ho ho, Mon chéri! Do you really want to know? Because once you do, there’s no going back.”

Callie, Genevieve, and I looked at each other skeptically. Callie then answered his question with another question. “Would we be asking you if we didn’t?”

“Ha!” He drunkenly laughed, energetically banging the palm of his hand on the counter. “You three are fun, I like it!”

We responded with more nervous laughter. At that point *he* was starting to creep us out more than this game was supposed to.

The Local then threw his head back, gulping down his drink. “To play The Seeker’s Game you first have to call out to him. The Seeker will then extend an invitation out to you if he wishes to accept. The game begins when the invitation is received. Be warned though for he sets the perimeters. He picks the time. The only thing you have to do, is hide.”

“How do we call out to him?” Callie asked, chuckling under her breath. Clearly, she didn’t believe a word he said.

Gen finished what was in her glass, looking The Local over curiously. She tried and failed to conceal her intrigue. “Do we just say his name?”

“No, Mon chérie,” The Local innocently grinned. “A chant must be invoked so The Seeker can hear you. It goes: Seeker, Seeker, heed our call! With every breath, we hide and sprawl! Seeker, Seeker, heed our call! As shadows dance, let fate enthrall!”

He leapt off his seat, swaying his shoulders back and forth with his arms up in the air. He laughed a wicked laugh before saying, “Then you must gather around, holding hands, and shout to the heavens: We want to play the seekers game! We want to play the seekers game! We want to play the seekers game!”

When The Local was done with his display, he took a bow before getting back in his seat.  Gen gave the man a weak pity applause.

“Okay…” Callie said, taking another shot. Needless to say, we were thoroughly freaked out. But, another round of drinks would fix that. “So, shat’s the prize if we win, do we get a wish or something?”

The local stiffened, giving her a serious look,“The prize? The prize is your *life.”*

“No fucking way,” I murmured into my shot glass. Gen and Callie gave each other “the look” again. They followed in my footsteps and consumed more alcohol.

“Like I said, once the game starts there’s no going back…” he said, shrugging his shoulders. 

“Well, thanks for telling us about this scary game of yours,” I said, pulling out my wallet to pay. Genevieve and Callie followed, apparently on the same wavelength as me. “Consider us *spooked.*”

The Local tipped his imaginary hat at us. “Do have a Happy Halloween now,” he said, flashing a smile before hobbling back over to his booth. 

We gave the man our final pleasantries before leaving the bar for the night.

“So should we do it?” Callie asked randomly as we walked down Burbon Street. By then some time had passed since our encounter with The Local. It was nearing almost four in the morning.

“Do what?” I responded, fiddling with my costume.

“Play The Seeker’s Game, duh!” Out of the three of us, Callie was the last person I expected to bring up playing the game.

Gen pulled out some chapstick from her purse and started applying it on her lips. “Sure, seems fun.”

“Uh, am I the only one that remembers him saying we could die?” I laughed, tightening my pigtails. 

“Puh-lease!” Callie squealed. “It’s not real, Elenor, so there’s no harm in trying it.”

I couldn’t argue with that logic. 

After looking around for a place with the perfect ambience, we landed on an old courtyard. A defunct fountain sat in the middle with vines covering it and some marble benches. The moonlight gave it an ethereal glow. We set our things down and started to chant.

“Seeker, Seeker, heed our call! With every breath, we hide and sprawl! Seeker, Seeker, heed our call! As shadows dance, let fate enthrall!”

Next we gathered in a circle and grabbed hands, mimicking The Local as we gyrated back and forth. We danced and spun around, having a little and had fun with it. Our raucous laughs filled the old courtyard. 

“We want to play the seekers game! We want to play the seekers game! We want to play the seekers game!”

The three of us stood there waiting in silence for something to happen. After standing there for five minutes Gen and Callie snorted and started giggling like school girls. Nothing had happened.

But I felt weird. Too creeped out and too drunk. I voiced my thoughts to the group. My friends wanted to stay out a little longer, so I went back to the AirBnB early by myself. I bid the girls adieu and somehow managed to stumble back and right into bed.  

Today, I woke up with a raging hangover around three in the afternoon. My first stop in the bathroom revealed I looked as bad as I felt. The hair in my pigtails were wiry, my makeup was running, and there was a stain of unknown origins on my blue dress. 

My second stop was to the kitchen. There I brewed myself a fresh cup of coffee and downed about four aspirin. Groggily, I stumbled to the front door, wanting nothing more than to enjoy my morning cup of joe in one of the rocking chairs out on the porch. I wanted to take in the historic scenery and watch as people got ready to start Trick-or-treating.

A warm gulp of coffee slid down my throat as I stuck my hand out for the door handle. A swipe and a miss. I paused, the lip of my mug stopping just beneath my mouth, wisps of steam still floating off the hot beverage.

*The doorknob was gone.*

A deep breath then a step back. I must’ve been more out of it than I thought. After rubbing my eyes, I looked again.

Still no door handle. In its place was a patch of smooth wood painted white. Like there had never been a doorknob there at all. 

I let out a disbelieving laugh. I’d try the glass sliding back doors next. The coffee mug just about slipped out of my hands. The plastic handle on the doors had been removed too. 

Frantically, I searched every door in the house. This is when I discovered pretty much every other door still had its handle. Only the doors leading to the outside world seemed to be inopenable. 

Okay, if I couldn’t leave through a door, I’d just have to crawl out a window. Imagine my surprise when I found that the windows we’d been able to open just the other day, were now one big pane of glass, unable to open. No biggie. Glass could be broken.

Honestly, I was bugging. Completely freaked out and feeling like a caged rabid animal. And caged rabid animals do crazy things when they’re scared.

The dining room table of our Air BnB had these fancy wicker chairs surrounding it. They were light, but sturdy too. Just sturdy enough to break through a glass pane. 

A guttural yell passed through my lips as I charged at the back door, a wicker chair as my battering ram. 

*Thunk!* 

My shoulder crashed into the piece of furniture, aiding my attack on the glass. Unfortunately, my first attempt was fruitless.

Composing myself, I picked the chair up and charged forward once more. The view of freedom taunted me. Just beyond those glass doors lay a whole world filled with fresh air. I set forth my attack, running with all my might. The collision was a hard one, but not enough to break the glass. 

My balance wavered from all that momentum. I tripped, tossing the chair back with me. Thankfully, I managed to catch myself on the kitchen counter before cracking my head open on the floor. That’s when I saw it. *The note.*

It was addressed to me, Ellie. The handwriting on it was hauntingly light and elegant. It was an invitation.

My heart sank to the bottom of my stomach. “No way,” I breathed out, shakily. “It can’t be-“

But it was. The back of the note revealed the rules of this game. 

This house. 

*“He sets the perimeters”*

The game lasts until midnight. 

*“He picks the time.”*

The game starts now.

*“All you have to do, is hide.”*

Fuck me.

According to the note he would begin seeking at sundown. That gave me about an hour and a half to find a good hiding spot, which wouldn’t be easy in this Air BnB. The layout was small: only a master bedroom, a guest room, living/dining room and kitchen. Plus furniture was sparse too. 

Hiding under the bed, in a closet, or in the shower would be too easy. The Seeker would find me too fast. The cabinets were a no go too. They were filled with food or other miscellaneous items.

I needed to think outside the box.

I searched the bedrooms for a crawlspace entrance or attic door. Just to see if maybe there was a secret hidden entrance somewhere, I pulled a couple books out from the bookcase. Nada.

Maybe the couch? No, it would look lumpy and obvious if I hid in there. 

With a groan, I kicked the thing, letting all my frustrations out because at that point I was going to die.

My purse slipped off the cushion from the harsh vibrations, falling to floor and spilling its contents out everywhere. Including my set of car keys.

My eyes lit up as I remembered my car was out in the garage! Normally it’d be parked out on the street, but something in my gut told me to bring it in last night. 

Now I had the perfect hiding place.

You see, my mom wanted us to drive her old minivan down here. She went on and on about luggage space, good gas mileage, and reliability. Basically she didn’t give me much choice about taking it. But the good thing about this minivan is that there’s built in compartments in the middle. The middle seats can fold down into them, giving the cabin more trunk space if needed. 

When the middle seats were up, however, theoretically there was just enough space in those compartments to fit a tiny, petite, body like mine. 

Knowing I’d be in there a while, I grabbed a large water bottle and my phone before heading out to the garage.

To double check and make sure, I tried to open both the regular door and garage door once I got out there. Just as I thought though, they wouldn’t budge. 

The minivan chirped as I unlocked it. Stealing one last glance out of the garage door window before hopping in, I noticed sundown just off in the distance. It wouldn’t be long before The Seeker started seeking. 

Squeezing myself into the compartment was harder than I thought. The angle needed to be just right for me to fit down there. Relief flooded through my body as I finally got my hip into a good place where it wouldn’t pop. 

I slid the door to the car closed, grabbing the compartment hatch and floor mat at the same time. Slowly, I lowered the upper half of my body down into the small space, carefully sliding everything above me in place.

From an aerial view, it should appear like a normal minivan from the inside, with nobody none the wiser that I was hiding right beneath the seats.

It’s dark out now. I know because there’s a hole on the floor that’s about the size of a penny. I can see the garage’s concrete floor.

Someone’s been moving around inside the Air BnB. It’s probably The Seeker. I can hear him searching, angrily tossing things about because he hasn’t found me yet.

I’ve been holding my breath since the light in the garage turned on a couple minutes ago. Slow, methodical footsteps filled the air as The Seeker walks around, still looking for his target. Me. I can see his shadow moving about from my little peephole. 

My tongue almost came off, stifling a scream when the back door to the minivan slid open. I mentally kicked myself for not locking it behind me. 

My hands were clasped tightly around my nose and mouth, making my breathing barely audible. I watched his shadow in anticipation as he rifled around in the cabin above me.

My shuddering sigh of relief was concealed by the sound of the car door slamming shut.
The Seeker stormed out of the garage in a fit of anger. He’s back inside my Air BnB, still seeking. 

I’ve outsmarted him for now, but there’s still four more hours until midnight.

All I can do is pray to God that he doesn’t find me. I don’t think I’ll survive if he does. ",4,1730420415.0,nosleep,0,1.0,False
1ggt3v0,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepypasta/comments/1ggt3v0/debbie_the_doll/,"Debbie, the Doll","In the year of 2024, in a small Florida town, there lived Mindy Dahl.  Mindy was a cold-hearted internet administrator, whose job was to review scary stories on her spooky website, called *Dahl’s Spooky Tales*.  Mindy had the power to decide which stories were scary enough to be on her website.

Mindy’s website had over 12,000 followers; each with their own spooky story to tell.  Unfortunately, some of the stories that got submitted weren't scary enough for Mindy; so she decided to delete some of them.   

When the authors of those deleted stories found out what Mindy did with their tales, they were furious because they worked really hard on them. Mindy didn’t care; she just loved having power over the lives of other people.  Little did Mindy know that one of the stories that she deleted was about to come to life; in the most haunting way that she could’ve ever imagined.

Deborah Ryder, a young woman in her 30s, is one of the people whose stories had been deleted by Mindy.  The story that Deborah wrote was entitled, *The Wrath of Debbie, the Doll*, a scary story about her doll named Debbie, a vintage doll that was very popular over a hundred years ago.

In her story, Deborah wrote that Debbie was a petit doll, about the size of an eight year old child, with black hair, puppet line eyes, a brown selkie French puff dress, black long sleeves, stockings, and brown Mary-Jane shoes. 

Deborah also wrote that Debbie was created by a mysterious toymaker, who was executed on Halloween after he was discovered using witchcraft on his dolls; but before he died, Debbie’s creator managed to cast a spell on her.  A spell that would bring her to life, so that she could avenge him. Now, according to legend, when least expected, Debbie will come to life to exact revenge on anyone who wrongs her.

One day, while looking through Mindy’s website, Deborah got a message saying that her story about Debbie, the Doll had been deleted from the website.  Deborah was crushed.  She put her heart and soul into writing that scary story, and now, it is gone.

“What am I going to do now?” Deborah asked herself

As Deborah contemplated what to do, she looked at her Debbie Doll, which was staring at her, motionless, with a happy smile on her face.  At that moment, Deborah got an idea: she was going to confront Mindy about deleting her story.  Deborah also decided to bring Debbie with her, so that Mindy could see the doll that inspired her to write her story.

The next morning, Deborah drove all the way to Mindy’s office; with Debbie in the passenger seat.  When Deborah got to Mindy’s office, she got out of her car, and took Debbie with her to the elevator.  After getting out of the elevator, Deborah went straight to Mindy’s assistant, Eve, and asked to speak with Mindy about her story.

“Do you have an appointment?” Eve asked

“No, I don’t,” Deborah replied “but I think that you can make an exception.”

At first, Eve was confused by Deborah’s comments, and she was about to call security to have Deborah escorted out of the building; when all of a sudden, a stroke of fear struck Eve to her core. 

The moment that she saw Debbie, the Doll, Eve couldn’t help but be afraid of it.  She couldn’t explain it, but Eve knew that there was just something strange about the doll.  Something dangerous.

“Sure, you can go in.” Eve said with a scared voice

“Thank you, Eve.” Deborah replied

“Deborah went into Mindy’s office with Debbie, the Doll in her arms.  As soon as Deborah entered Mindy’s office, Mindy said,

“Oh, it’s you.  What do you want, Deborah?”

“I want to talk to you, Mindy.” Deborah replied “I want to talk to you about my story.”

“What’s there to talk about?” Mindy replied “You wrote a scary story, you submitted it, and I deleted it.  There’s really not that much to talk about.”

“I just want to know why?” Deborah replied “Why did you delete my story?  I worked really hard on it.’

“You really want to know why?” Mindy said “Fine, I’ll tell you: you’re a great writer, Deborah; but your story didn’t meet my website’s quality standards.”

“What do you mean?” Deborah asked

“It wasn’t scary enough.” Mindy replied “I mean, what’s so scary about a supernatural doll that comes to life on Halloween?”

“But Mindy…” Deborah said “You deleted my story, and it was the only copy that I had.”

“So write another story.” Mindy replied “Hopefully, this next one won’t be about some stupid doll.  Speaking of dolls, what are you doing with *that* doll in your hands?”

“This is Debbie.” Deborah replied “She’s the doll that inspired me to write my story.”

“Really?” Mindy said sarcastically

As Mindy got up from her desk, she walked towards Deborah, and picked up her doll.  Mindy examined the doll thoroughly to see if there was anything truly scary about Debbie.

“She doesn’t look scary to me.” Mindy said

Then Mindy callously dropped Debbie, the Doll into the trash can.

“What are you doing, Mindy?!” Deborah said

“I’m doing you a favor.” Mindy replied without empathy “Stories about supernatural dolls have been done before.  Take my advice, and write about something else.”

“You shouldn’t have done that, Mindy.” Deborah said seriously

“Oh, really?” Mindy replied arrogantly “What are you going to do about it?”

“I’m not the one you should worry about,” Deborah said “My doll is.”

Mindy looked at Deborah in confusion.  Then she pushed a button on her desk phone.

“Security!” Mindy shouted “Get this woman out of here!”

Security came and escorted Deborah out of the building, and back to her car.  After Deborah drove away, Mindy decided to get back to work.  When Mindy went back into her office, she saw something that she couldn’t believe: Debbie, the Doll was out of the trash can, and standing on Mindy’s desk.  Debbie had an angry, menacing look on her face aimed at Mindy.  Mindy was confused; she was sure that she dumped Debbie into the trash can.

“How did you get out of the trash can?” Mindy said

Mindy slowly walked towards Debbie, the Doll, and picked her up off of her desk.  As Mindy picked Debbie up, she could’ve sworn that she heard giggling coming from the doll.  Along with a child-like voice that said,

“Be careful with the stories that you delete online.  Because they may come back to haunt you one day.  Happy Halloween.  Heh.  Heh.  Heh.”

Then, Debbie went silent.  Mindy felt a little unnerved by what she just heard, but she shrugged it off as if it was nothing.

“Okay, that was weird.” Mindy said as she threw Debbie back in the trash can

Mindy then went back to work.  However, as soon as she sat down, Mindy’s computer screen immediately opened up to her website, “Dahl’s Spooky Tales”.  Mindy’s computer had been hacked, and somehow, it was now sending all of the stories that she deleted back to the authors who wrote them.

“What’s happening?” Mindy said with fear

Mindy could not stop her computer from sending the stories back to their authors.  No matter what she did, they just kept going until they were all gone.  Mindy was confused.  She couldn’t understand what just happened.  Then, Debbie, the Doll started speaking again, and she said,

“What’s the matter, Mindy?  Is your hair falling out?”

“What?” Mindy said nervously

While Mindy tried to understand what was going on, she put her hands through her hair, and it started falling out.  Mindy screamed.  She ran into the bathroom, all while repeating,

“This isn’t happening!  It can’t be happening!”

As Mindy washed her face, and recovered from the loss of some of her hair, she tried to tell herself,

“This isn’t real.  This is just in your head.”

Once Mindy finished washing herself off, she went back into her office, only to find Debbie, the Doll sitting on her desk, waiting for her.  Mindy was terrified.  She didn’t know what to think anymore.  As Mindy feared what was going to happen next, Debbie, the Doll spoke once more, and she said,

“Don’t worry, Mindy; you won’t be here for much longer.  Heh.  Heh.  Heh.”

Then Debbie went silent again.  Mindy was so freaked out, that she grabbed Debbie, the Doll, and she threw her in the dumpster behind the building.  As the garbage man came to take the trash away, Mindy hoped that she had seen the last of Debbie, the Doll and her antics; but she was sadly mistaken.

When Mindy got back inside of the building, she ran into her boss, Mr. Dalton, the man who helped build Debbie’s website.  Mr. Dalton came to give Mindy some bad news:

“Mindy, I need to talk to you.” Mr. Dalton said seriously

Mindy and Mr. Dalton went into his office.  Mr. Dalton had his hands crossed as if he was disappointed in Mindy.

“Is something wrong, Mr. Dalton?” Mindy asked

“Mindy…” Mr. Dalton replied “I’m sorry to have to tell you this: but you’re fired.”

Mindy’s heart was crushed.  She was bewildered.

“What?!” Mindy said “I don’t understand.  Why?”

“Didn’t you send me this email?” Mr. Dalton replied

Mr. Dalton showed Mindy a hurtful, criticizing email, that not only slandered him; but everyone in the building as well.  The email also had Mindy’s resignation letter written in her handwriting on it.

“I didn’t send this!” Mindy said “I didn’t do it!”

“It was sent from your computer, Mindy.” Mr. Dalton said “If you didn’t send this; then who did?”

“It was Debbie.” Mindy said “That stupid doll.  She did this.  She hacked into my computer, and she sent those emails.”

Unfortunately, Mr. Dalton didn’t believe Mindy.  In fact, he thought she had finally gone mad.

“Okay, Mindy,” Mr. Dalton said “Why don’t you go home and get some rest?  We’ll talk more about this later.”

In her anger, Mindy stormed out of Mr. Dalton’s office, gathered her things, and went straight to her car.  Mindy then drove to a nearby gas station to buy a bottle of wine to drink her sorrows away.  Afterwards, Mindy went home.

As soon as she got inside of her house, Mindy poured herself a glass of wine and started drinking.  She was so drunk that she forgot that tonight was Halloween night; so she wasn’t prepared when the Trick or Treaters came to her door, asking for candy.

“Trick or Treat!” they said

“I’m sorry, kids.” Mindy drunkenly said “I don’t have any candy; but you can take these pens.”

Mindy handed the Trick or Treaters pens; instead of candy, and they were disappointed.  They were so disappointed that they even thought of egging her house, which they almost did.  Unfortunately, their parents were with them, so they couldn’t go through with it.

As Mindy was looking at the Trick or Treaters, she could’ve sworn that one of them was a young girl in a brown selkie French puff dress, black stockings, and brown Mary-Jane shoes.

“Is something wrong, mam?” the little Trick or Treater asked

“No, nothing’s wrong.” Mindy replied ominously “Happy Halloween.”

Mindy then closed the door on the Trick or Treaters.  She thought that what she saw was a hallucination, brought on by her drinking.

“I must be really drunk.” Mindy said “That has to be it.”

Just then, Mindy’s phone started to ring, and she went to answer it.

“This is Mindy speaking.” Mindy said

“*Hello, Mindy,*” said Debbie’s voice “*It’s me, Debbie, the Doll.  Do you want to have some fun*?”

At first, Mindy was scared. She thought that Debbie, the Doll was coming for her; but then she thought,

“*This has to be Deborah.  She’s getting back at me for deleting her story.  Well, two can play at this game.*”

Thinking that she was talking with Deborah, Mindy cleared her voice, and she spoke back on the phone,

“Okay, Debbie…” Mindy said mockingly “What do you want?”

“Didn’t you read my story?” Debbie replied “It’s Halloween.  This is the night when I come to life to exact my revenge on anyone who wrongs me.”

“Oh, really?” Mindy said sarcastically

“Yes, really.” Debbie replied “In fact: you, of all people should’ve known my story before all of this started.”

“Why is that?” Mindy asked

“Because Mindy…” Debbie said chillingly “One of the people who killed my creator over a hundred years ago…was Mark Dahl, your ancestor.”

“What did you just say?” Mindy said in shock

“Your ancestor…” Debbie said “was one of the people who killed my creator on Halloween over a hundred years ago.  That’s the real reason why you deleted my story, isn’t it?”

“Shut up!” Mindy said in anger

“You didn’t want anyone to know,” Debbie replied “that your ancestor killed my creator.”

“I said, shut up!” Mindy shouted

“That would’ve ruined your website.” Debbie said mockingly “Wouldn’t it, Mindy?”

“Okay, Deborah,” Mindy said, “That’s it!  I’ve had enough of this game.  Either you leave me alone; or I’ll call the cops on you.”

“By the time they get here,” Debbie said, “You’ll no longer be here.”

“That’s enough, Deborah.” Mindy shouted

“I’m not Deborah.” Debbie said menacingly “I’m Debbie, the Doll; and now, it’s time for you to pay.”

Debbie then hung up the phone.  All went silent.  Mindy was bewildered.  She had no idea that her worst nightmare was standing right behind her, with floating knives aimed at her legs.

Mindy let out a horrible scream of pain as the knives went into her legs.  She turned around to see Debbie, the Doll, in her menacing appearance, with knives floating around her.  Mindy was horrified by what she saw.

“No, this can’t be!” Mindy said in denial “You can’t be alive!”

“It’s Halloween, Mindy.” Debbie replied “Of course, I’m alive; and I’m going to make you pay for what you’ve done.”

“What are you going to do to me?” Mindy asked in fear “Are you going to kill me?”

“Oh, no…” Debbie replied wickedly “I have something much more horrifying in store for you: you deleted my story, and threw me in a trash can; so I’m going to give you a taste of your own medicine.”

Debbie snapped her fingers, and in a flash of lightning, Mindy disappeared. When she woke up, Mindy found herself inside of a blue room, with a large human sized trash can.

“What happened?” Mindy said “Where am I?”

Mindy frantically looked around to figure out where she was so that she could escape; but she couldn’t find an exit anywhere.  She also couldn’t see Debbie, the Doll anywhere.  That is, until she appeared right in front of Mindy, looking much bigger than she already was.  Mindy was even more terrified now than she was before.

“Debbie?” Mindy with fear in her voice “How did you get so big?”

“I didn’t get big…” Debbie replied “I shrunk you down to the size of a toy; and I trapped you inside of your own computer.”

“You did what?” Mindy said in shock

“Look around, Mindy.” Debbie said “You’ll see that I’m telling the truth.”

Mindy took another look, and she saw the horrible truth: she was trapped inside of her own computer, which was now being controlled by Debbie, the Doll, who was about to give Mindy a fate worse than death.

“Let me out of here!” Mindy shouted as she banged on the glass

“Sorry, Mindy.” Debbie replied “but that’s not going to happen.  It’s like I told you: be careful with the stories that you delete online, because they may come back to haunt you one day; and unfortunately for you, Mindy, that day is now.”

Debbie then used the mouse for Mindy’s computer so that she could control her.

“Control…” Debbie said playfully

“Debbie, what are you doing?!” Mindy said fearfully “Stop it!  This isn’t funny!” 

Debbie then used the mouse to slowly move Mindy towards the virtual trash bin on her computer so that she could delete her from existence. 

“Alt…” Debbie said as she moved Mindy closer to the trash bin

“Debbie stop it, please!” Mindy shouted “Please don’t do this!  I’m sorry!”

“Delete.” Debbie said as she dropped Mindy into the virtual trash can

“No!” Mindy shouted after being dumped into the virtual trash can

After she dumped Mindy into the virtual trash can, Debbie, the Doll, deleted Mindy from existence, and Mindy was never seen nor heard from again.

“Well, Ms. Administrator,” Debbie said “Now you know how it feels to have your story deleted from existence.  Happy Halloween, Mindy.”

The next day, Deborah Ryder woke up to find a manuscript of her story on her coffee table.  The story was entitled, *The Wrath of Debbie, the Doll*.

“How did this get here?” Deborah said as she picked up the manuscript

While Deborah was looking at the manuscript, Debbie, the Doll suddenly appeared right behind her and started giggling.  Deborah was spooked by Debbie’s giggling as she turned around to face the doll.

“Debbie?” Deborah said “What’s going on here?  I thought that Mindy threw you in the trash can.”

Debbie didn’t answer; she just stood there motionless.  As Deborah pondered what was going on; she turned on the television to watch the morning news.

“*Breaking news*!” The TV announcer said “*In a story that has everyone baffled, Mindy Dahl, the owner of the website, Dahl’s Spooky Tales, mysteriously vanished from her home last night after screams were heard coming from within her house.  If you have any information regarding Ms. Dahl’s whereabouts, please contact the police.  That’s all for now.”*

Deborah was shocked by the news.  She turned the television off to face Debbie, the Doll.  She was convinced that Debbie had something to do with Mindy’s disappearance.

“Debbie?” Deborah said “What did you do?”

Debbie, the Doll blinked her eyes.  Then she slowly turned towards Deborah, and with a child-like voice, Debbie said, 

“I did what I was created to do.  Heh.  Heh.  Heh.”

I'm 32, male, 181lb, 6'0"", Southeast Asian, average build. A professional engineer by day and a food dispenser for my cat by night. A bit of a homebody and night owl so I don't often get the chance to meet people, so giving reddit a go. Dating apps are just... no.

I currently live on my own and my two big hobbies are anime and videogames. Currently obsessed with FFXIV, Honkai: Star Rail, and Hololive lol. Other hobbies being sleeping, cooking, visiting new coffee shops, trying new foods, biking on trails, and making poor attempts at exercise to stay in shape. I only ask that you aren't overweight yourself.

Let's chat about our passions and hobbies or let me see how many times I can make you laugh. We don't have to like all the same things, tell me what you're into! Would love a genuine connection that could lead to long term dating but I'm open for anything. ",1,1730420102.0,MeetPeople,0,1.0,False
1ggsztd,https://www.reddit.com/r/MechanicalEngineering/comments/1ggsztd/i_feel_like_a_fraud_i_am_currently_a_senior_in/,I feel like a fraud (I am currently a senior in college),"Some background: 
I am a first generation student, meaning neither of my parents went to college. English wasn’t my first language. I spent 3 years in community college and then transferred to a fairly decent university. I am now in my last year (3rd year). So a total of 6 years for a bachelors in Mechanical Engineering. I worked part time at a coffee shop during my time in community college. Going to graduate Spring 2025. Longer than what a bachelors typically takes. 

Back to the topic, as I mentioned, I feel like a fraud ever since I transferred. I am surrounded by very smart students who really know their stuff and have a strong technical/hands on experience/intuition. It makes me feel like an imposter since I feel like I don’t have a mechanical intuition since I don’t really know how to build things and didn’t tinker as kid and I struggle coming up with ideas in the design projects for classes. I got into this major because math and science were my favorite subjects in high school. And I chose mechanical because it was the broadest. It seems like most people in my school chose Mechanical because they grew up tinkering . I just worry about my future and whether I will be considered smart enough to succeed as an engineer and not be seen as useless and stupid. I will be graduating with zero internship experience and haven’t gotten involved with a club. I did take intro welding, lathe, and metal casting classes since they are required. I did think they were cool, but I was usually slower than everyone else in these classes and not as good. 

Essentially, I feel like a fraud because I am a bit older than my peers, I don’t feel like I have mechanical intuition or good technical/hands on skills like my classmates do. Sometimes I struggle mentally because I feel like a got lucky and worry about the uncertainty of my future once I graduate and not being seen as good enough to be an engineer.

I recently bought a 3D printer and an Arduino kit a week ago which I intend to soon start playing with during the weekends.

Some details:
My GPA is 3.3
- I passed FE (fundamentals of engineering) exam
- I will be the first in my family to attend and graduate from college",8,1730420044.0,MechanicalEngineering,11,0.9,False

While I'm really excited, what scares me is that I've never done FIFO before, and even if I'm on a pretty good roster, I do not know whether I would be able to survive 12-hour work days knowing how uni already stresses me out even if I have much more free time. 

I've already interned full-time elsewhere in Europe (diff work culture) in academia, albeit unpaid which is the norm back in the EU unfortunately. While my supervisors told me I did well, I did jackshit and I was mostly in the canteen spamming the free coffee and cookies and I do not know how that'd translate in a completely different industry where at least I can walk around and do more fieldwork.

I do plan to move around (within Australia but moreso around the world) if I decide to go full-speed ahead of this career trajectory. But again, I really do not know how uni compares to office/FIFO work.

1ggswml,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/1ggswml/heartbreak_is_making_me_lose_my_mind/,heartbreak is making me lose my mind,"There’s this former coworker (29M) of mine who I (22F) have had deep feelings for for a year now. In my eyes he was the perfect guy and made me feel like no one else could. After I ended the job almost a year ago, I could never get rid of my feelings for him. All we did was hug and get along well, so I always thought he wants nothing from me. 
That’s when my first heartbreak started, end of last year, when I left the job. I was crying like a baby. We had sporadically contact throughout this year until now. Every little message would brighten my day, week or month. Every day I would think about him and dream about him. I was going from high to a low almost every month. I was crying so much because of this man. Because everytime he would text my hope would go up again, that he maybe feel the same about me, but he never did. I now know that.
Half a year ago he called me for the first time asking how I am. After that he never contacted me again. For the last 6 months again I was in deep sorrow.

A week ago, I decided that this has to stop. I was brave and texted him if he wanted to get coffee with me sometime. He immediately agreed. 
For the last week I was the happiest I’ve been in all this year, probably the happiest I’ve been in all my adult life, just because I knew that I would see him again and hug him… all was so bright.

I was getting ready for hours, made myself look the best I could. I spent so much money on the right clothes. Just to impress this man. We met yesterday. And it was bad. Not at all like I imagined our reunion after almost a year since we last saw each other. I always thought there was chemistry. He complained a lot. First about the Café that I chose (too many old people in his eyes, so we went to another one..), about the job (the job is now too boring for him, not cognitively challenging enough, he is working in law enforcement..). He did not say anything positive at all, not even towards me. No appreciation whatsoever. He just seemed like a the guy who has it all and can’t get enough. He has the looks, the great family support, a great job, a house… 
Other people would be lucky to be in his shoes.

And I found out he has a girlfriend now. 
I’m glad he mentioned it at very end pretty randomly actually. 

I immediately needed to get out of there. I felt my heart shatter into a million pieces.
I really thought it was a date. How could I be so stupid.

We awkwardly said goodbye. 

Now I’m left with this pit in my stomach. I can’t eat, sleep or do anything. I didn’t know that one sided love can cause so much pain. I feel dizzy and like I could throw up. Also I can’t stop crying.
I can’t explain how worthless and stupid I feel for thinking someone like him could like me back. 

Since this has been in my head for a year now, it feels impossible to even think, I could get over this. I wanted him in my life so badly. I still felt this really strong pull towards him. He was the most handsome man ever. Ive never seen a man that good looking in my entire life. Of course a lot of women like him. I doubt I could ever find a man as attractive as I’ve found him.. 

Also the worst thing: I don’t think he realized that I had a crush on him at all.

Does anyone have any advice? I’ve never experienced this kind of heartbreak before. I’m overwhelmed.",3,1730419775.0,mentalhealth,2,1.0,False

1ggsvm7,https://www.reddit.com/r/PanicAttack/comments/1ggsvm7/panic_attack_or_something_else/,Panic attack or something else?,"Background: 

I’m a 23 y/o male that has been working out 4-6 days a week for 8 years

I had a regular cup of coffee from home about 1.5-2 hours before going to the gym and I only had toast for breakfast, I don’t typically drink coffee and it does make me jittery sometimes but not always.

Story: 

I was working out at the gym back in August when near the end of my workout, as I was about to start the last set of my second last exercise, I suddenly felt my heart rate go through the roof, making a whole bunch of weird beats all over the place. I thought I was having a heart attack and almost asked the person next to me to call an ambulance lol. I stayed calm, breathed deeply, and called my mom to come pick me up. The episode lasted for about 5 or so before I slowly got up and anxiously walked to the door and sat in the lobby with my mom for a few minutes anxious to get up and walk to the car. I don’t remember feeling much more than the irregular heartbeat other than feeling anxious to standup and pass out if I were to walk out on my own.

I have never had this before and it hasn’t happened since. Only thing I’ve noticed is my heart skips a beat here and there, mostly when I’m tired or working out (I’ve been working out at my home gym ever since), which I believe is normal and I’ve noticed before. I have an Apple Watch now, and my ecg results are always sinus rhythm and my resting heart rate is between 40-80 (40 when I’m sleeping and between 70-80 when I’m active in the day).

I think I had a panic attack but Im curious to see if anyone thinks it could be something else? I read into ventricular tachycardia and the symptoms are seem similar which makes me nervous lol.

My doctor thinks it’s nothing and booked me a holter monitor appointment on Monday for 3 days for reassurance.

I’m asking about this now since I’m going to the police academy in 3 weeks and I’m feeling a it anxious about having an episode like that again while I’m there 😂.",1,1730419691.0,PanicAttack,1,1.0,False

I had just got out of court that morning and headed home. The inside of my apartment was nice but the outside was dilapidated in an urban corner of our town. Although I lived in an urban section, most of the town was actually pretty rural. I liked to spend a lot of time away from downtown in the woods. It was a mountain college town. There was a small University that sat in the middle of it. It was my sophomore year of college so I knew the rundown. First day of classes always goes the same. Show up, introduce yourself to the class, go over the syllabus, and head out. I was running late, so I ran down the hall. As I approached the classroom I slowed down so I wouldn’t walk in out of breath. I opened the door and there was only one seat left in the corner of the room next to a girl with long dark brown hair. I sat down. The professor started off the class.

“My name is Dr. Williams. I know most of you are here for the gen ed credit but I ask that you stay engaged and interested in this class. I’m going to go around the room and have each of you introduce yourself and say one thing interesting about you,” he went around the whole class until he got to me.
“Hi my name’s Dave. I like writing and going out in nature,” I said awkwardly.
“And you?” Dr. Williams said, looking at the girl.
“My name’s Olivia,” you could tell she was shy, “I like plants. I’m a botanist,” days went by and she never really talked much in class. I didn’t hear her say a word for weeks. I wondered what was going on in her head. What she was feeling and thinking. 

One day I woke up sick. I got up and walked to the bathroom. I looked at myself in the mirror and I looked like a wreck. I wanted to at least spend a day away from school outside but I couldn’t even do that. I missed the rest of the week. I felt better the following monday so I went to class and sat down next to Olivia since that had become my seat. 

Dr. Williams started the lecture, “The tragedy of Narcissus is one of desire. The obsession of oneself leads to nothing but isolation. It causes pain to the ones around us. His life was cut short because of his own self awareness or lack thereof.” 

I tuned out part of the lecture because I couldn’t help but think about how behind I was from the days I missed. I didn’t know anyone in class. I had been quite lonely since highschool although I didn’t seem to mind all that much. I’m not usually this honest, but it’s not like I was very liked in highschool either. Especially after what happened. However even though I didn’t know Olivia I was intrigued by her. She was shy and reserved. I wanted to know more, so when class ended I spoke to her.

“Hey Olivia, I missed class because I was sick. Is there any way I can get the notes from you?” I said nervously.
“Sure, here”, she flipped through her notebook, “you can take pictures of these.” 
I reached for my pocket and pulled out my phone, “shit my phone is dead, it’s okay I appreciate it though”
“Well I can take the pictures and text them to you.” 
“That’d be so helpful thank you,” I proceeded to tell her my number and we left class. Later that night I got a picture of the notes. 

I texted her back: “Thank you”. 
She replied: “No problem”.

 	A couple weeks passed. It was a Friday night and I heard my phone go off. 
It was a text from Olivia: “Do you want to help me study for the test?” 
The test was on Monday and I needed help as well so I texted her back: “sure.”
She texted: “can you come over tomorrow,” she sent me her address. 

The next day I headed over. It was in a section 8 housing complex. I walked up to the door and knocked. I wasn’t sure if I had the right apartment but then Olivia opened the door.

“Hey glad you came,” Olivia said standing in the doorway, “come on in.” She wore a gray crop top with black jeans and Doc Martens. Her hair draped down her back and she smiled. Her teeth white, skin pale, and cheeks round. I walked into her apartment. It was a well lit room, sunlight shining through the curtains with a couch underneath a tapestry. The couch was facing a tv and a stereo system. There were plants all over the apartment and the living room connected to the kitchen. A grandfather clock laid against the wall. It was nice. In front of the couch was a coffee table covered with notes and textbooks. I walked in and sat on the couch and she sat beside me. She offered me a cup of coffee and I happily obliged. We started studying but after a while it got a little awkward because neither of us really knew who each other were. I wanted to know who this person was.

“So have you always lived here?” I said. She looked at me confused for a second and then seemed to realize what I was trying to do.
“Oh, um no. I was born in Raleigh,” she said.
“What made you want to go to school here?”
“I really like the Biology program.” 
“I didn’t know we had a great Biology program.”
She looked uncomfortable, “well… do you want me to be honest?”
“Sure, I mean yeah.”
“This is really the only university I could afford with a halfway decent program”
“Oh, yeah I know how things can be with money. Do your parents help you out at all?” Olivia’s eyes turned a little red and she looked down and then she began to cry. “What’s wrong?” I said. She just continued to cry. I brushed her hair with my hand trying to comfort her. My fingertips grazing her back through the strands of hair. She leaned on my shoulder and she felt warm. It felt nice. “I know we don’t know each other very well but you can talk to me” I said and she began to sniffle and looked up towards me.
“I grew up in a foster home, I don’t have parents. Well that’s not true I had parents.”
“Well what happened to them?”
Her face immediately changed and she got up abruptly. Now she was looking down at me.
“Mind your own fucking business I don’t even know who you are!” She said.
“Look I’m sorry but you’re the one who decided to open up to me so quickly,” I got defensive.
“Do you really want to know?”
“Yes i do”
“You seriously want to know about how my parents beat me and CPS had to come and take me away?”
I paused for a moment, “I’m really sorry.” I stood up and gave her a hug. She stood there stiff and then let out a sigh of relief. She relaxed and wrapped her arms around me. We sat back down and went back to studying. When it got late I grabbed my stuff and said goodbye. I opened the door and before I stepped out I heard Olivia say my name.
“Dave.”
“Yes?” I said as I turned around towards her.
“Thank you,” she said softly.

Monday morning I walked into class and saw Olivia. She had a blank face but when she noticed me it turned into this bright smile. I smiled back and it made me feel wonderful. At the end of class me and Olivia both got up and walked out together.

“Hey, would you like to get together again soon,” she said.
“Well we don’t have another test for a while,” I said. As much as I wanted to see Olivia again I thought there was no way a girl like her would want to spend time with me again.
“No, I mean just to hangout.”
“Oh yeah sure, let's do it. There’s a really cool trail I can take you on if you like hiking.”
“I haven’t done much hiking, but sounds fun!”

That weekend we spent the afternoon out and went on a hike. It was fun, it was an off branch from the Appalachian trail that not many people know about. The few locals that do know about it call it Rocky Ridge. I drove us there. We parked in a gravel parking lot, got out of the car, grabbed my backpack, and went up the trail. We talked at the start of the hike, telling each other about where we see our lives going after we graduate, but stopped talking eventually. She was out of breath but I was used to doing this so I was holding my own. We got to the peak and the sun was starting to set. We sat on the top of the cliff. It was one of the highest peaks in the area. There was about a 100 foot drop down from the ledge and the view was great.

“I brought us some food,” I said. I unpacked the backpack I brought and took out two sandwiches.
“Thank you,” she said happily, “I really appreciate you thinking of me. I wasn't even thinking about bringing food.”
“You also didn’t think to bring water,” we both laughed.
“Look at the sunset, isn't it beautiful.” We both looked at the sunset and took it all in. The sun was red, the clouds were pink, and the sky was purple. There was a thick fog that laid low in the valleys. It made all the other mountains look like islands in an ocean. “You know I don’t really have many people in my life. I haven’t really gotten to know anyone since I started this semester.”
“Well you have me.”
“I appreciate that. It’s been really lonely. To be honest I’ve been quite sad lately, but it makes me feel better to go out and do things like this with someone.”
“I’m always here. If you ever feel alone don’t hesitate to ask for me and I’ll be there,” I waited a couple seconds continuing to take in the sunset, “well we should probably get going before we’re walking in the dark.” 

So we went down the trail and right as we got to the gravel parking lot it was dark. I knew how to time it out perfectly. I had done this trail many times. I drove her back to her apartment to drop her off. The windows were down and she got out and closed the door behind her. She stood outside the car. She rested her arms on the window seal and stuck her head back in the car.

“I had a good time with you today, we should hang out more often,” she said.
“Me too,” I said as I smiled.
“I’m really glad I met you,” she smiled back, walked down the sidewalk, and into her apartment. 

I waited for her to get inside before driving off. I wanted to make sure she was okay. I was really glad I met Olivia too. I knew she was really lonely and didn’t have anyone. She needs someone in her life right now, and I have to be there for her. I then drove home and got to bed because I had an appointment in the morning.

It was state mandated counseling. I sat in the waiting room until my therapist came out and told me to come in. It was a small room with a couch, a chair, fish tank, and curtains covering the windows. Her diplomas and credentials hung up on the wall. By the door was a little box that created subtle background noise so people in the hall and waiting room couldn’t hear what was being talked about. We had a regular session just like all the other ones. I frequently glanced at the clock waiting for it to end. It was finally just about over.

“So you’ve been coming to counseling for a while now and I think you’ve made a lot of progress,” the therapist said.
“Yeah I think I’m a lot better,” I said.
“It sounds like your anger has been under control and you’ve learned how to depend on yourself instead of others.”
“Yeah. I made a mistake, but I’ve taken responsibility for it and have finally moved on.”
“That’s great to hear. Well you’ve officially completed all your required hours. However I think it would help if you decided to keep coming in.”
“I think I will.” I had no intention of ever coming back. I just wanted to finally put what happened in high school behind me. She signed off on my hours sheet and I left the office.

Olivia and I kept hanging out regularly. One day after class I decided to surprise her. I asked her if she would want to keep me company while I did some shopping. I felt bad for her. She had no one.

“Can you go with me to the store?” I said.
“Yeah sure,” she responded. We got in the car and headed off. We started going downtown. “What store are we going to?” She asked.
“We’re not going to the store.”
“Then where are we going?”
“You’ll see.” She was confused until she eventually saw that I had brought her to a botanical garden.
“Oh Dave!” she said joyfully.
“I wanted to do something nice for you today,” I said. We walked through the botanical garden. Every plant we walked by she knew the name of. It was sweet, it felt good to make her happy.
“That one is Coprosma repens, and that one is Salix babylonica,” she said. She had a great time. On the way home I glanced at her and looked into her eyes.

I was 7 weeks into the Semester and Olivia and I had been hanging out pretty often. We decided to see each other after class one day. We both took our cars from campus and made it to her apartment. We got out and went inside. We decided to start a tv show, it was a gangster show. We sat down and watched it while sitting on opposite sides of the couch. I was getting a little bored so I started to make conversation while the show kept running.

“Have you been feeling a little better lately?” I asked.
“Yeah I have been. To be honest things have been a lot better since we started getting together. It’s nice to have a friend,” she said.
“Yeah, same.”
“What about you?”
“Hey I never said I was feeling bad?”
“Well you just said same, and also I just kind of assumed.”
“Why would you assume that?”
“Well the first time we hung out I trauma dumped and freaked out on you. You obviously have something going on to stick around after that,” she laughed.
“Maybe I was just being nice? Did you think about that?”
“Come on Dave, what’s going on in your head?”
“You think there’s something wrong with me?”
“No, I never said that.”
“Well you’re implying that.”
“No Dave, I’m not. Just forget I said anything okay.”
“You know I’ve stuck around because you don’t have anyone. I mean am I just supposed to stand around and watch you suffer?”
“Well you like spending time with me right? Are you saying you just pity me and that’s the only reason you hangout with me?”
“No, I'm not saying that at all. I do like you, would you quit making assumptions.”
“I get it, I'm just the sad girl in class that you try to make feel better because you want reassurance that you’re a good guy. You just want to tell yourself how great and wonderful you are so you can be a knight in shining armor and swoop in and save the damsel in distress.”
“You know I’m out of here. Enjoy life on your own.” I walked towards the door.
“You’re not serious right.”
“If you really think that way then deal with your problems on your own.”
“Wait, don't leave.”
“I’m leaving.”
“Don’t leave.”
“Bye.” I opened the door and was about to step out
“Wait please Dave please don’t leave I’m sorry! I wanted to have a good time don’t leave me on my own. I can't be with my own thoughts. I don’t want to be stuck with my thoughts, anything but that!”
I turned back towards her and saw her eyes welling up with tears. “Okay, okay,” I reassured her in a calming tone. “I won’t leave, look I’m here, I’m here right?”
“Yes.”
“I’m not going anywhere.”
“Don’t leave me.”
“I won’t. I’m here for you.” I stayed the rest of the night.

I decided from that day on I was never going to leave Olivia. No matter how damaged and unstable she may be, I still know she needs me. What would she do without me? 

Things were going well. I was almost finished with the terms of my probation. My last court date was in a week. The day came around and I had to get up early to make it on time. I was dressed well and stood in front of the judge as he spoke to me about turning over a new leaf and starting a new chapter. Court ended and I was finally done with all of it. It had been a week since I’d seen Olivia outside of class. I was worried about her. I knew she must have been lonely, so later that day I texted Olivia and asked if I could come over. She said yes so I went back home to change my clothes and drove to Olivia’s house. We hung out and played cards on her coffee table.

“How has your day been?” She asked.
“Good, I’m just kind of tired. I had to get up early,” I said.
“What for?”
“I don’t want to talk about it.”
“Why not?”
“Some things I just don’t want to talk about okay.”
“Is it something bad?”
“Just stop asking.”
“I won’t judge you. You can tell me.”
“Look, will you just drop it.”
“Why?”
“It’s my own private business.”
“I’ve told you stuff about my life but I barely know anything about you. You don’t talk about yourself ever.” She was prying into my life. She was asking stuff about my personal life that I didn’t want to talk about and it felt like an invasion of my privacy. I’ve never been very in control of my emotions. I’ve been trying to work on it for a while but sometimes I slip up. I lightly slapped Olivia. I didn’t mean to do it but it just happened. 
“Ow, what the hell Dave that hurt,” she said
“Well you weren’t listening to me,” I responded.
“Yeah but you don’t slap me because of it Jesus. Fine, we don't need to talk about it.”
“You’re right, I’m sorry. I just got a little worked up I guess.”
“It’s okay, just don’t do that again,” and she didn’t ask me about it anymore.

I had shown a vulnerability, and that vulnerability came with honesty. The fact that she finally saw a flaw of mine and knew more about me drew her closer to me. The fact that she accepted me drew me closer to her. We started hanging out more often, and school continued on. We got invested in our friendship. All I want to do in life is help people and Olivia was damaged. I want to fix her and I know I can.





















2.

	I was more than halfway done with the semester and Olivia and I started to spend more and more time together. At first it was a couple times a week, and then it was almost every day. It was a starry night and I was over at her place watching that same gangster show. We had been watching it for a while and were on season 3. She was leaned up against me on the couch, her head on my shoulder. One of the characters in the show got raped in a parking garage. Olivia started to shake.

“Are you okay?” I said.
“Yeah yeah I’m fine,” she said. I began to hear her sniffling. I paused the show.
“Olivia what’s going on?”
“It’s nothing no seriously.”
“I’m not trying to pry but something clearly made you upset.”
“It’s just that scene,” she said. It took a second to click with me what she was saying.
“Tell me their name and they’re dead,” I felt cheesy saying this but I was trying to make her feel better.
“You can’t.”
“Why?”
“They’re long gone, it was in the foster home.”
“What happened? If you want to talk about it.”
“They decided to put me, a 12 year old, alone in a room with a 17 year old with no one watching. I never even knew his name.”
“Olivia, I’m sorry that happened but it’s not going to happen again. I won’t let it.”
“It’s seriously okay I’ve grown past it I’ve learned coping skills.”
“Well clearly it still bothers you a lot.”
“How could it not I was raped. Raped as a kid. Do you know what that’s like? You obviously don’t!”
“Jesus calm down.”
“No I’m not going to calm down, how can you tell me to calm down.”
“Because you’re getting all worked up over a scene from a tv show.”
“It’s more than that asshole,” she said while tears ran down her cheeks. She got up and walked to the kitchen.
“Come on I’m sorry “ I said as I followed her. 
“Get away from me!” She screamed while grabbing a porcelain plate and throwing it at me. It shattered on the ground. 
“What the fuck? Fuck’s wrong with you!” I was pissed off but she got quiet.
“I’m sorry. Oh I’m really sorry.” She started to breath heavily and then yelled, “GOD DAMN IT.” She swiped her arm across the kitchen counter and knocked dishes and glasses all over the floor. The floor was covered with broken kitchenware. Her hand was bleeding and blood dripped onto the floor making a puddle. I walked over and started to clean up the mess. She stood there still. As I knelt down sweeping up broken dishes, I looked into the blood, and saw myself in her misery.
“Do you have any bandages?” I said.
“In the bathroom,” she said faintly while staring off into the living room. I walked to the bathroom, got some bandages, washed her wound, and proceeded to wrap up her hand.
“I’m sorry,” I said.
“It’s okay,” she paused and wiped tears from her eyes, “I care about you a lot and I really don’t want to push you away from me. I can’t be alone again.”
“Don’t worry, you won’t. I care about you too.”

At least I know she cares about me. I love to feel cared for by someone. I was there to comfort her and we became best friends from that day on. It was just another one of the many freakouts she has but that one was by far the worst one I had seen at this point I thought. Only a few weeks later she had another meltdown while I was over.

“Will you stop placing blame on me for everything going on in your life,” I said.
“I’m not but you slapped me. I should’ve cut you off then,” she said.
“It was a mistake, okay. I freaked out. You threw a plate at me.”
“Because you wouldn’t back off, you're so pushy. I know I open up to you but a lot of times you pry. I can’t handle this. I’m just so miserable in life. I don’t even know if I want to live anymore.”
“You think I just have love and support in my pocket everywhere I go?” I grabbed her by the neck and pushed her up against the wall, “ If you want to be that selfish then just do it!” I walked to the kitchen and grabbed a knife. I brought it back to her, “if you really care so little about me then just do it and leave me on my own. Leave me alone like you were when they took you away from your parents!” She took the knife out of my hand and ran to the bathroom, “wait Olivia stop I wasn’t serious.” She slammed the bathroom door behind her and locked it. I slammed my fist on the door, “open up. Don’t do anything stupid.”
“Get away from me!”
“Open the door.”
“No!”
“Open the door right now!” I yelled. I heard her crying. I got worried, I mean I couldn’t lose Olivia. I don’t know what I would do without her. I rammed my body against the door.
“Stop it. Leave me alone.” 
I kept ramming my shoulder into the door until it busted open. There she was, on the bathroom floor with her wrists slit. I grabbed the knife from her hand and threw it as far away as I could, “Olivia, don't do this,” I gave her a hug and she buried her head into my chest,
“I can’t live without you,” she said.

I stayed with her the rest of the night to make sure she was okay. She became very attached to me after that. I knew since the day we first hungout that I wanted her to be my friend. She was very important to me, she gave me purpose. I knew that without me she would probably be dead. So I made myself as active in her life as I could be following that day.

Finals were around the corner and the weather had started to get very cold. When I wasn’t with Olivia we were either texting or calling each other. We told each other about our lives. We learned a lot about each other. We always ended up spending time at her place. On a snowy Saturday night I came over with a bottle of liquor. I walked up to her apartment, my shoes leaving footprints in snow, and knocked at the door.

“Come in,” she said through the door. I opened it and walked in.
“Look what I brought,” I said while holding up the bottle. She brought out a shot glass. We took shots while listening to some music on her stereo. We got drunk.
“You know what’s sad?” she said.
“What?” I replied.
“Even though my parents were pieces of shit I still miss them.”
“Why would you miss them?”
“Wouldn’t you miss your parents if you were pulled away from them as a kid. I mean it’s not like it was only bad times with them.”
“But they beat you?”
“Oh well I’m sorry you’ve just had a perfect life with perfect parents where nothing bad ever happened to you. Is everything really so black and white? Like you can’t love someone that treats you like shit? You know I wish I had your life.” She doesn’t know shit about my life and I started to get angry.
“I hate it when you do this, you just go into these episodes where you lash out at me and all I’ve done is be here and be supportive for you!”
“You literally just use me for your own validation. You don’t give a shit about me. You don’t care about me, you care about the attention I give you!”
“That’s not true”
“No, no it is.”
“Olivia, I care about you,” I put my arm around her and she flinched.
“Don’t touch me,” she started hitting me, “Don’t fucking touch me you piece of shit.” This pissed me off. I'm always there to comfort her. I’m always the one making her feel better, not the other way around. I had so much anger that had just built up and I was pretty trashed. I was so drunk I didn't know what came over me and I guess I just snapped. I punched Olivia across the face and she fell to the floor.
“How could you say that about me!” I said as she looked up at me from the ground with tears gushing out of her eyes, “You stupid ungrateful bitch!”

Her eye began to swell up and turn black. It was more red than when she usually cries. I must have popped a blood vessel. Her tears from that eye turned from clear into blood as she began to bleed from her eye. She was crying blood. She wept and wept but I didn’t say anything. I just sat there. She began to cry louder. I wondered if it was because of the pain or the sadness or both. She curled up into a ball on the ground and started to settle down to a moan. I waited to sober up before leaving, not saying a single word the whole time; I just looked at her. I’ve never seen someone cry for that long. 

The next day we didn’t talk. On Monday I came to class and Olivia wasn’t there. I sat down next to her empty seat and even though I was in a room full of people, I felt all alone without her there. Dr. Williams started the lecture. About 10 to 15 minutes passed I think more like 10 and then the back door to the classroom opened and there was Olivia. Her face even more swollen than when I last saw it. Her eye socket night black and eyeball sun red. Her cheek busted and purple. The class went silent and she pulled the chair out from under the desk. It made a loud uncomfortable sound. Dr. Williams continued the lecture. The whole way through class we acted like we didn’t know each other.

“Make sure to read pages 121 through 140 by tonight and respond to the discussion board,” Dr. Williams said. The class all got up and headed for the door. I saw Dr. Williams stop Olivia before she left. I stood by and eavesdropped.

“Olivia, can you stay back for a little bit? I want to talk to you,” said Dr. Williams.
“Yeah sure,” Olivia said. 

I then walked out of the classroom and headed home so I didn’t look suspicious. I started to get nervous that she was going to tell him. I couldn’t sleep that night. I was paranoid thinking about what if she told him or decided to press charges. I could get kicked out of school or even worse. On Tuesday after class Dr. Williams stopped me.

“Please come to my office before you leave,” said Dr. Williams. I walked to his office with him. I thought this was it, Olivia had told him everything. We walked in and he closed the door. “Have a seat,” he said. I sit down in the red leather chair while he walks over to his office chair. There was a mirror on the wall and blinds which light shined through over the table. He finally spoke, “I know you and Olivia are very close.”
“It’s nothing romantic between us,” I replied.
“Okay but you have to see how this looks to me. You two, walking in and out of class together talking everyday. I’ve seen the way she looks at you and now she hasn’t made eye contact with you since yesterday.”
“Where are you going with this?” I cut him off. I spoke confidently but deep down I was scared.
“You know damn well why you’re here. I tried going to the police but they said there’s not enough evidence and the board said they can’t do anything unless she comes forward.”
“Like her face? You think I did that to her face? We’re best friends.”
“Well if you’re best friends you can tell me what happened then.”
I sat silently for a second before speaking, “It’s private.”
He raised his voice, “Really? Because what she said didn’t sound too private.”
“I can’t believe what you’re trying to imply,” I got up and left his office. 

I walked down the haIl and texted Olivia: “What did you tell dr williams”
She responded: “Come over and lets talk”. 

So I went straight from campus to her apartment. I got there and at this point in our friendship I didn’t have to knock. I’m always welcome over. I open the door and walk in. She sat on the couch.

“Okay we have to set our story straight,” I said.
She didn’t talk with the confidence she usually had. It was very sad and submissive, “is that what you’re thinking about right now? Not the fact that you hit me?” There was silence then she spoke again her voice quivering, “I’m sorry I was hitting you first, this is all my fault.”
“Hey, hey, it’s okay, don't worry about it. Look I’m sorry I hit you I didn’t mean to hit you so hard. It was an accident.” She had a glimmer of hope on her face.  
“An accident?” she said.
“Yeah you don’t remember you were really drunk. I tried to swing one of the pillows at you and accidentally punched you.”
“Oh, okay,” she looked numb and broken inside, “well I told Dr. Williams that I  slipped on ice and fell. Can things just go back to normal?” I sat down beside her. There wasn’t a sound except the grandfather clock ticking. She stared off straight forward. I looked at what she was staring at and it was the turned off TV. 
“I would like that,” I said.

We had been through a lot together, bonded by our struggles. It made us grow even closer. I began sleeping on the couch at her place most nights. We said good morning and good night to each other. Things with Olivia were good. The semester ended and winter break started. I know Dr. Williams wanted to fail me but my grades were good, and without the board on his side there was nothing he could really do. I had won and there was no more Dr. Williams in my life. Christmas was around the corner and students left while others came back home. I went over to Olivia’s apartment and when I opened the door I saw her on the couch with another man.

“Oh hey Dave,” she said.
“Hey, how’s it going,” I said. I was uncomfortable. I had to pull up a chair from the kitchen because there was no room on the couch.
“Oh I’m sorry Will, this is Dave. He’s my friend from my Mythology class last semester.” Will was a tall kind of built dude who had short hair and a mustache. He wore a hat, t-shirt, and sweat pants with nice sneakers on.
Will said, “oh that’s Dave? The man, the myth, the legend. Hey man, I've heard a lot about you. It's nice to finally meet you.” He offered his hand out towards me and I shook it.
“I hope only good things,” I laughed.
“Oh yeah Olivia never has anything bad to say about you. She says you two are best friends.”
“Yeah you could say that.” I was very uneasy, I mean who is this man. I’ve been going over to Olivia’s and talking to her for 4 months now and I’ve never seen or heard of this Will guy.
“Well I’ve got to head back home, my parents are making dinner,” Will said.
Olivia said, “can’t you stay any longer? I haven't seen you in months?”
“I haven’t seen my family in months either. How about tomorrow?” Will said
“Tomorrow sounds good,” she said and Will left.
I waited a few seconds and then I asked, “who the hell was that guy Olivia?”
She looked at me and said, “Will is my boyfriend.”

1ggsssq,https://www.reddit.com/r/ChineseCinema/comments/1ggsssq/how_hard_is_it_to_do_stunts_with_wires_on_you_do/,How hard is it to do stunts with wires on you? Do people underestimate how hard it is to do wire fu action scenes? Does doing even simple stuff like jumping over 2 foot stones require some training and/or prep despite use of wirework?,"Years ago I saw an a page on TVTropes where some American who grew up watching martial arts movies  as a child and he aspired to become a martial artist and stuntsman one day. The page said he eventually accomplished his dream and became so good at action scenes and stunts work that he was able to do a lot of the stuff he saw in the Kung Fu movies he loved watching from childhood....... And it was a gigantic surprise for him to learn so much of the action he saw on TV and films growing up were not really done by the actors themselves but were executed with the assistant of wires and other tricks. It was both a big disappointment and disbelief to learn that for him in the fact of being able to do a lot of the jumpy flipy stuff on his own just by his sheer athleticism and skill.

I wish I can find the exact article but I can't seem to get it no matter how many times I search on TVtropes so you'll just have to take my word for it, That said having finished half of Jet Li's movies and now starting on Jackie Chan, I'm inspired to ask this question just by the fact that while Jet Li used a lo of wires from his 90s stuff, he also did a crap ton of movies whee he was doing all the stunts and fight choreography on his own without any assistance be it from attached wires or stunt doubles or the plethora of other tricks in the movie industry.

Is it easy as 123 doing stunts and fight scenes with wire fu? Like no more difficult than drinking coffee on your comfy couch in the morning before reading the newspaper?

","There were parts I liked in season one. Firstly I worked from home when it was airing and ngl it was nice to have a cup of coffee, start morning work when it was slow, make some toast and watch rings of power. Ngl I actually really liked the first two episodes- but then I hated how they teased Galadriel in armor using a sword when she ends up in numenor literally doing nothing (basically). I loved adar and his thing with the orcs and his position was way more intriguing than “sauron” (whose name I forgot.)

Unlike most people on here I actually enjoyed the harfoot stuff. The Elrond/durin plot line was also enjoyable. Didn’t like the faux Gandalf stuff. Arondir was.. passable. I like his character but the stuff with “Theo” and his mom was just so lame imo. He would’ve been better without the show forcing some ill fated love story on him.

Oh I also really liked the practical effects of the orcs. But as you guys have outlined on this sub for over a year, for every positive there’s ten glaring negatives. You notice how cheap the show looks- how lame the writing is. How no character actually speaks how one would- there’s this focus on replicating the films while not putting forth the effort that the films did and even skipping corners. They threw a shit ton of money at this show and it doesn’t “show” at all.

I had hoped that the show would have improved due to the criticism, but it seems to have gotten worse. I’ll watch it eventually, but between working, starting school, and having a six month old I don’t want to commit to anything that’s rubbish. ",2,1730419285.0,Rings_Of_Power,6,0.67,False

*By writer/producer Roc Hatfield*

Brad, you should destroy that horrible device. You have single-handedly doomed us all. Did you hear what it said? Heaven, actual heaven is in a panic, because mankind is not supposed to have this knowledge. You have not just taken a bite from the forbidden fruit, you have ate the whole fucking tree. I will speak with you tomorrow. If it comes. Good night. Jason marches off. OK, Brad says. Are you two all right? Brad asks. Nancy and Walter, nod a big yes.

https://preview.redd.it/46d2pw7hk6yd1.png?width=1456&format=png&auto=webp&s=426665cf77fc7038d2a6aeb0faa09d27a82ea39b

The advanced photonics campus looks spectacular in the early morning, dew sparkling on the grass, the sun gleaming off the two high-rise office buildings made of glass. There are dozens of scientists milling around, getting ready to go to work. A small group is waiting to take an elevator up to the 17th floor. For a meeting in the penthouse executive suite, Nancy and Walter are among them. Walter, did you bring your notes? Nancy asks. Your videos? Yes, I did, Nancy. Try and relax, Walter says, as they ride up the elevator. Walter is an academic, not a big socializer. Nancy, on the other hand, wants everyone to be happy. As they all walk into a large boardroom, staff have prepared a breakfast of coffee, orange juice, bagels, cheese spreads, all laid out in an elegant presentation. Everyone is getting seated.

Brad's executive assistant instructs the group to help themselves to the food, and Brad will be in shortly. He is on the phone. Big surprise, right? Nancy, Brad asked for you to pass out NDAs to everyone and get them signed. There is a high level of chatter in the room. Nancy stands. I know we are all under a blanket nondisclosure, but what Brad is about to tell you is highly sensitive and needs to remain confidential. Everyone is looking very curious at this point. Just as Nancy is picking up the signed agreements, Brad enters the room. Every one of the department heads in the room know Brad well, and they know he has a flair for the dramatic. Brad addresses the room. Thank you, Nancy. And thank you, Elaine. You did an excellent job setting up the breakfast so beautifully.

Okay, fellow co-workers, friends, this is going to sound just like a pitch out of my playbook, but it's not. I'm not hyping in any way when I tell you that this meeting is not only going to change your life, but it is going to change the lives of every man, woman, and child on earth. We have stumbled onto the biggest discovery since the beginning of recorded history. Everybody grumbles and moans. Oh, it sounds like you may be a tad skeptical. I don't blame you. Nancy, let's roll that beautiful Aetherean footage. The blinds come down, and the video of Nancy's driver plays out on the big screen up on the wall above the table. Nancy is studying their faces. Some look fascinated, and some look concerned. What is going through their minds right now? Nancy thinks to herself. The film ends. Nancy turns the lights back on and lifts the shades. One department head yells, Okay, great, Brad is making movies with his Hollywood friends. Everyone laughs. Brad says, You know, Robert, I really wish that were true. But this is why I asked you to be here this morning.

We have discovered something through a lot of hard work and not to mention a big stack of cash. The ramifications are beyond assessment right now. Religion, government, economic, social fabrics, every corner of our existence is affected by this. Are we going to commercialize this? Asks Tom Wilson from the back. I don't know Brad responds, but that’s why I brought you in today. You are my trusted team. Plus, you all have option agreements. A big laugh from the whole group.

Just south of the Advanced Photonics campus, you can hear the deals being cut up on Capitol Hill. A young distinguished senator, Arthur Adamson III, sits in his big plush chair, big cup of Starbucks coffee in his hand. A knock at his office door. His assistant, Bonnie, informs the senator that Dr. Jason Anderson is here to see him. All right, Bonnie, send the good doctor on back. Bonnie motions to Jason to walk back. Jason, the senator says, How the hell are you? Jason replies, Senator, if I was any better, I would have to pinch myself to make sure I wasn't dreaming. That sounds scary, the senator says. They both laugh. Jason, call me Art, please. That senator's shit is for my old man. All right, Art, Jason says. So Jason, what brings you all the way down this way? Looking for another contract for that company of yours? Art, I have some information that will boggle your mind, and it requires me to divulge a top corporate secret. I will be fired or worse if anyone finds out I told you. Well, Jason, that is the reason we passed that last round of whistleblower laws for times just like this.

One week later. Brad, Nancy, and Walter are walking across a large underground parking lot below Brad's office building. Okay, Brad, we were able to get the super light stuffed into a van as you asked. We were just able to get everything stuffed in, Walter says. Maybe you should get a bigger van, Brad says. Well, wait till you see the van, Walter says. They all walk up to the van. It's a giant furniture delivery van, 30 feet long. The tagline, painted on the side says: Always same day, from Broadway. I borrowed it from my brother's furniture business. I loaned him the money to get started. Now he is a big shot on television and shit. Walter says sardonically. Awesome, Brad snaps. So is the super light camera pointing out the windshield? Brad asks. Nancy and Walter both look at him, duh. It doesn't matter where the camera is pointing in this realm. Oh, right, it only sees shit in another place.

They all hop into the van. Brad wants to try it out. Walter starts the van, then moves to the back and begins flipping switches. Walter placed the big camera sensor along the driver's side wall and the big video monitor on the passenger side wall. As Walter taps a couple keys on the computer, an image starts to form on the big screen, it’s the stadium. But now, looking at the outside at ground level, Brad pans the camera and the image pans with it. Look at this. Brad stops his pan and focuses on a moving sidewalk. Hundreds of beings are moving along on it, in what seems to be a very vibrant futuristic city. There are immense buildings, skyscrapers that appear to be miles high, super technology, amazing vehicles. Are you recording this, Walter? Brad asks. Absolutely we are, Walter says. Walter, is there enough space for me to lay down and sleep in here? Brad prods. Why Brad? I want to see if my driver will come out while I am asleep.

Nancy's driver said it would come out and explore when she was sleeping. Let's meet back here at midnight. Nancy, I will give you a list of questions to ask my driver. And hopefully it will be willing to chat for a while. Nancy happens to glance over at the screen and chirps out a little scream. Everyone turns to look. A small crowd of Aethereans have gathered in front of the camera. Man, Brad remarks, how are they able to notice us? We can't see them, but boy are they able to see us. This is all so confusing, Walter says. Shut it off, Nancy cries. Walter pulls the plug from the back of the monitor. The screen goes black.

The senator and Dr. Anderson are meeting at a posh gentleman's club on K Street in the heart of Georgetown. 200 cows made the ultimate sacrifice to cover all the chairs in this joint with leather. Senators and politicos of all flavors are sitting, smoking Cuban cigars, drinking single malt, and having lunch. The senator and Jason are having a giant bone-in-tomahawk steak, specialty of the house. Jason, enjoying that steak? The senator asks. Amazing art, how is yours? Jason asks as he cuts another slice of the black and blue cut of meat. This place has been here since the FDR administration. They've had a lot of practice, the senator says. So tell me, Jason, what's going on over at that company of yours? Brad Hilliard has been funding an amount of money into a very hush-hush project called Superlight. I heard he may have spent as much as $24 billion so far. So what does it do, Jason? The senator asks. I have no fucking idea. It's made like a giant camera, and it's hooked up to three custom-made chips made out of iridium. Then it passes through a bunch of computers. That is my technical observation, but the output goes to a special built video monitor, and that's where the horror show begins.

Jason, I'm not following you, the senator says. Sorry art, the camera, can see into another world or realm, dimension, or whatever you want to call it. There are thousands of beings there, and they are also here. There seems to be one in each of us. Creepy, like a parasite. The senator wipes his mouth with his white cloth napkin and says, Jason, you have seen this tech firsthand. Yes, Jason nods. I know a little about this concept. Our deep black guys know a lot about these things. These creatures are behind the beings known as Greys and tall Greys. We have to get access to this tech for a number of reasons, national and global security at the top of the list. I am going to meet with the community that oversees deep black projects and see what they think about all this.

So keep your eyes open and let me know if things change, the senator says as he signs the check and stands. Jason, thanks for coming to see me. I thank you, and your country thanks you. The senator waves at his aide and walks toward the door. The rings of Saturn are strikingly beautiful. The sun glistens from them. They appear solid from Earth, but they are actually billions of small rocks all flying in formation around the giant planet. Nestled in between the large house-sized boulders is a space station. This sector of the Milky Way is monitored and maintained by the Greys.

I’m laying in bed and trying to find the courage to get up and go do something. I’m hoping to have some casual conversation with people for now.

I’m a fan of KEXP so that should tell you I like just about any genre of music under the sun, but again it all depends on what song speaks to me the most. I love cold and gloomy weather, rain. I enjoy a cup of coffee or hot cocoa. I love cats and dogs. Kids are adorable too. But you can’t ask to pet them.

We arranged to meet in a hotel room for our second date. I cancelled it a couple of hours before we were supposed to meet. My gut was just telling me that I should not go. The doubt alone was confirmation I had done the right thing. I explained how my previous pAP ended things pretty much after we met, and honestly, I'm just scared of it happening again. I just wanted more time to establish trust.

He has spent the day telling me he cares about me. We, however, decided to go no contact (tried to be friends, but he spoke about his SO and ex pAP, and I didn't have the energy to listen). He has deleted his telegram. I went to send him a message on reddit and discovered he has already put up a new ad. It's literally not been 12 hours since we were due to meet in the hotel.

Background: 

I’m a 23 y/o male that has been working out 4-6 days a week for 8 years

I had a regular cup of coffee from home about 1.5-2 hours before going to the gym, I don’t typically drink coffee and it does make me jittery as I don’t have much of a tolerance

Story: 

I was working out at the gym back in August when near the end of my workout, as I was about to start the last set of my second last exercise, I suddenly felt my heart rate go through the roof, making a whole bunch of weird beats all over the place. I thought I was having a heart attack and almost asked the person next to me to call an ambulance lol. I stayed calm, breathed deeply, and called my mom to come pick me up. The episode lasted for about 5 or so before I slowly got up and anxiously walked to the door and sat in the lobby with my mom for a few minutes anxious to get up and walk to the car. I don’t remember feeling much more than the irregular heartbeat other than feeling anxious to standup and pass out if I were to walk out on my own.

I have never had this before and it hasn’t happened since. Only thing I’ve noticed is my heart skips a beat here and there, mostly when I’m tired or working out (I’ve been working out at my home gym ever since), which I believe is normal and I’ve noticed before. I have an Apple Watch now, and my ecg results are always sinus rhythm and my resting heart rate is between 40-80 (40 when I’m sleeping and between 70-80 when I’m active in the day).

I think I had a panic attack but Im curious to see if anyone thinks it could be something else? I read into ventricular tachycardia and the symptoms are seem similar which makes me nervous lol.

My doctor thinks it’s nothing and booked me a holter monitor appointment on Monday for 3 days for reassurance.

I’m asking about this now since I’m going to the police academy in 3 weeks and I’m feeling a it anxious about having an episode like that again while I’m there 😂.",2,1730417752.0,Anxietyhelp,1,1.0,False

*Budget*

**I budgeted $2500 USD and ended up spending $2700 USD.** I could have probably saved about $200-$300 if I had thought ahead a little bit more (booked a few flights last minute; would still do again due to the length of the trip but maybe could’ve booked earlier) and if I didn't make a few mistakes (I got got a few times, oh well)

My biggest categories for spending were Activities (which I include costs for things like museums, attractions, day trips, overnight trekking trips, etc.), Flights (which can certainly be avoided; I just gave up on buses), Shopping, and Food/Meals.

My daily budget was $50 USD and in the end I averaged $54 USD per day. I used the app TravelSpend which was SO helpful. I highly recommend.

*Trip Length*

7 weeks (Sept 11-Oct 30)

\~4 weeks in Vietnam, \~3 Weeks in Laos

*Destinations*

In Vietnam my route was: Ho Chi Minh City - Hoi An - Hue - Phong Nha - Ninh Binh - Hanoi - Cat Ba - Ha Giang Loop - Hanoi

In Laos my route was: Luang Prabang - Nong Khiaw - Luang Prabang - Vang Vieng - Vientiane

*Accommodation*

I used Hostel World the whole trip to book which was super easy. Granted I think I was there before the high season but I would book a bed only one or two days before arriving. Ceapest beds for dorm rooms were usually between $4 and $9 USD.

Vietnam Hostels (and Rating): **HCMC**: Saigon Rooftops Hostel (10/10); **Hoi An**: Mad Monkey (7/10), iHome Hoi An (9/10); **Hue**: New World Hotel (9.5/10); **Phong Nha**: Central Backpackers Hostel (10/10); **Ninh Binh**: The Banana Tree Hostel (9.5/10); **Hanoi**: The One Hostel (8/10), Hanoi Oldtown Nomad Hostel (6/10), Hanoi Central Backpackers (9/10); **Cat Ba**: The One Hostel (8/10); **Ha Giang Loop**: Mama's Homestay (9/10)

Laos Hostels (and Rating): **Luang Prabang**: Sunrise Riverside Pool Hostel (11/10); **Nong Khiaw**: DK-Camping and ATV Adventure (9/10) (I booked my homestay through Sabou, who manages this tour company and stayed in one of his bungalows); **Vang Vieng**: Chill House (8/10), Mad Monkey (8/10); **Vientiane**: Funky Monkey Hostel (2/10, avoid this place)

*Top Activities*

Ha Giang Loop (Ha Giang, Vietnam): Definitely a peak moment on this trip. I did 4 days, 3 nights with Mama's Homestay (around $200 USD) and had the time of my life. I had an easyrider (local driver) and saw some of the most breathtaking views I had ever seen before. It was like you turn a corner and see the most beautiful thing ever think that nothing can top it, then you turn the next corner and its even better. The food was amazing and the homestays throughout the trip were nice. The drivers are absolutely rockstars. They are so kind and welcoming and just totally enhance the trip. I also had a great group that I was placed with. The happy water stays flowing as well.

Paramotoring (Vang Vieng, Laos): Sunrise paramotoring ($100 USD) was not something I thought I would do on my trip but it was definitely a highlight. Soaring above Vang Vieng and the blanket of clouds so that the mountain tops just barely are peaking above. Insane views and such a cool experience.

Trekking in Nong Khiaw, Laos: I did a one day tour ($30) and a 2 day overnight tour ($40) here. Nong Khiaw is definitely an up and coming spot for eco-tourism. It feels like an authentic experience and you really get a good look at the rural parts of Laos. The one day tour was great and I got to see some rice fields, a water fall, a cave, a lookout point, and take a boat ride. The 2 day overnight was the highlight though. You hike up a mountain and arrive at the top as the sun is setting and get breathtaking views. Then you learn to make some Laotian food, sleep under the stars, and wake up to a beautiful sunrise. Highly recommend getting up to Nong Khiaw; about a 4 hour bus ride from Luang Prabang. I stayed at a homestay with the nicest family and learned lots about Laotian food and culture.

Day cruise (Cat Ba/Ha Long Bay, Vietnam): A day cruise ($25) that leaves from Cat Ba and shows you the beauty of Ha Long Bay. The insane rock formations and blue ass water make for stunning views everywhere. Swimming, kayaking, feeding monkeys, and soaking up the sun.

Hai Van Pass, Vietnam: I spent $15 to rent a scooter in Hoi An to drive to Hue via the Hai Van Pass. It was my first time ever driving a scooter and it was so fun! As you drive up and over the mountain you can make stops at these awesome coffee shops that overlook the pass and make for stunning views. After the mountain you can drive through some cool fishing villages and get a look at what Vietnam looks like outside of the tourist areas like Hoi An or Da Nang. Some parts of the highway were definitely not as fun when driving alongside semi-trucks, but this was still super worth it. Even if you don't drive yourself it is still a great ride (you can book an easyrider). The company I rented the scooter from gave me recommendations for places to stop and shuttled my big bag to Hue. I highly recommend renting a scooter at some point in your time in Vietnam!

*What Went Right*

* I met so many amazing people staying in hostels and going on tours. Even though this was a solo trip, I never really was alone. I even traveled with some people for 2-3 weeks! I made some life long friends :)
* I took it slow. I initially planned to only spend 2 weeks in Vietnam (which now sounds like crazy talk). I could have absolutely spent the whole 7 weeks there. I really learned to embrace the solo traveler/backpacker mindset of taking things slow, not planning too far in advance, and going with the flow. I ended up spending nearly 11 days in Luang Prabang. It can be so easy to get stuck somewhere and I would totally say to allow yourself to get stuck if you really connect with a place or people!
* I am pretty happy with my spending. Definitely could have cut some costs but to be honest I thought I was going to blow my budget by a lot more than $200 so I'll take it!
* Moved hostels if I felt like I needed a change or didn't like something at the current one. Only book for 1 or 2 nights at a time and extend if you want to (not sure if this works in the high season)

*What Went Wrong*

* Definitely got taken advantage of a few times. Always ask prices before you start anything (this includes taking taxis/tuk tuks/scooters, going on an impromptu tour, etc.) and don't be afraid to be stern or walk away.
* Weather was a barrier a few times. Didn't do much research beforehand on when I was arriving, which was near the end of the rainy season. Was confronted with Supertyphoon Yagi and a couple other storms.
* Wish I didn't fly as much. I flew from HCMC to Hoi An to make it in time for a full moon/harvest festival which I don't regret however I did skip Dalat which I want to go back to. Flew from Hanoi to Luang Prabang to avoid a 25 hour bus ride (if you have taken that ride I salute you, my body could not handle that). And flew from Vientiane to HCMC since I booked roundtrip to/from HCMC. Those flights are cheap-ish but they add up. I would try to avoid them.

*Recommendations*

My favorite stops were Hoi An, Phong Nha, Ha Giang, Luang Prabang, and Nong Khiaw. Highly recommend you really spend some time in Laos; many people told me you can do Laos in less than 2 weeks, which you can, but I think it is so worth spending some more time there (I didn't even scrape the south!).

I learned a lot through solo travel. It was such a positive experience overall but there are definitely difficult moments where you feel alone, homesick, tired, or just not 100% and that is okay. For me, the first week was a huge adjustment and I considered going home early so many times; try and stick it out. It is worth it. But also make sure to take care of yourself first and foremost.

Recommendations are just that! Everybody has different perspectives, mindsets, desires, goals, opinions...try to not get absorbed into other people's opinions on things and give everything a try! Ultimately, you'll have an experience that will be unique to you.

*Final Verdict:*

I feel like I've said a lot and there is so much more to say! I had such an amazing time in Vietnam and Laos and am counting down the days until I get to go back. The people in both those countries are so kind and welcoming. Their countries are full of rich culture and history, delicious food, and amazing experiences. Solo travel was such a life changing experience and I think everyone should try it at least once if they can!

**If you're headed to either country I am happy to share more recs!**

1ggs4id,https://www.reddit.com/r/HaileyBaldwinSnark/comments/1ggs4id/hailey/,Hailey ,"Anyone notice she’s always with Kendall. Like before her claim to fame husband, she was leeched to Kendall and Kylie’s hip. She’s drifting onto that again. Especially since they did Halloween again. Not saying she can’t be with friends. But she’s been partying and always out with either Kendall or the other friend. She’s not getting likes from Justin anymore but him liking other women’s posts at the same time is giving that they don’t even like each other. Besides the paid backgrid photo ops and mandated public appearance, when did they go out for outings like coffee? Close was jacks appointments but that’s basically a requirement thing they have to do. Multiple sources are stating she’s never with the baby and Justin is. It’s sad but I feel like it might be the case. 

She really needs to let go of this man, her relevancy isn’t that powerful. Everyone in her media posts keeps asking “what is she known for” everyone is saying she’s the wife of Justin Bieber. While her “fans” try everything in their power to put her off as a “ worldwide model and CEO of a major skin care brand” someone replied to “why isn’t in major sellers stores or any promotions besides herself?” Then her fans start bring up Selena. Idk I feel like this is the tip of the iceberg of their downfall. Everyone is talking about it. Everyone is noticing it except their fans. Even people who are not even following them are saying they don’t look like a happy couple, it’s looking like a contracted marriage. Is she that desperate to cling on a name to make herself seem like she’s an icon and a powerhouse?


Also noticing a lot of Rhodents on here pretending to be snarks. lol. I had a convo with one the other day. They also hopped on another sub and said that I’m a misogynist for snarking on a woman who just gave birth and in postpartum depression. Then said Selena can’t even have a child so that’s her karma. Also that the whale itself should be breached?.?( don’t know what that means) the sub was… get this… food network sub….. also mention that the only thing broken in Hailey’s and Justin’s marriage is Hailey’s bed….

: I had a MMC w/ d&c in august. Waited for my first period and got pregnant on the following ovulation. I tested negative for HCG initially and then my “period” came the next day. It was unusual with oxidized blood. Then fresh with clots similar to coffee grinds. I got a way too early positive OPK after 5 days of bleeding in preparation for my ovulatory window. I then took a pregnancy test and it was positive then spotting and bleeding with a decent amount of debris has been taking place since then. I’ve been bleeding & spotting for 2 weeks total now. I have had my hcg drawn and it’s low and my doctor confirmed miscarriage. I would have only been about 5 weeks pregnant… I’m wondering for anyone else that has had a pregnancy loss that early, how much content was in there for such an early gestation?

- continue to look for unaddressed problems in my daily life or problems in need of a better solution.

I’m currently 33 years old, and for over a dozen years, I’ve felt unwell and don’t know who to turn to about it. What’s the issue? My heart overreacts to various situations.

I can’t drink coffee; even a weak one causes shortness of breath. If I had an energy drink, I’d probably end up in the hospital. When I drink alcohol with friends, I experience arrhythmia (extra supraventricular contractions) for up to 25 hours after the last drink. I can feel it even in my throat, along with shortness of breath, my whole body trembling, and I can't stay still—I have to move my limbs. Even positive emotions can trigger arrhythmia. For most people, coffee causes stimulation, but for me, it causes shallow breathing, something like photophobia, and cold sweats. I once tried weed, and my heart rate shot up to 140, and I was drenched in sweat. After a good meal, my heart rate suddenly spikes.

While I can give up many things, I would love to be able to enjoy a coffee or a drink with friends or enjoy life without constantly worrying about my heart. Recently, when picking up my dream car from the dealership, I had to take Polfenon (Propafenone) for arrhythmia because the excitement was overwhelming. Sometimes even just a bit of sleep deprivation or stress causes heart palpitations.

I’m from Poland, where we actually have great cardiologists, and I’ve spent a fortune on tests across many independent clinics in different parts of the country—everything looks fine. I’ve had Holter monitoring, EKG, heart echo, Doppler—perfect results. My magnesium and potassium levels are normal, electrolytes too, and thyroid is fine as well. I don’t know what to do because I’ve even started gaining weight lately. The poor state of my well-being drains my motivation for any activity, which certainly worsens the problem. I went to a psychiatrist, thinking it might be stress-related, and took Escitalopram because I had some stress—it didn’t help, and I discontinued it under medical supervision after nearly two years of hoping it would.

I decided to write here because I know it’s a large community, and I’m probably not alone. Is anyone else facing a similar issue?

I'm also posting here because it feels like something that might have a psychological background. I don’t know if it’s anxiety because, in general, I’m not really afraid of much. But maybe I just don’t fully understand it, and it only *seems* that way, while my body is experiencing anxiety beyond my conscious awareness?

Our sense of humor and interests are very similar.

We have a same group of friends (my bestie dating his friend - it was the two of them who introduced us actually). He invited me to the theater in the summer. We had picnic. Sometimes we text on WhatsApp. Last time he forgot to replay for a week, so he gave me a box with sweets as a sorry with a funny note.

I like spending time with him. I like him as a person. I was in a toxic relationship before, so I'm very careful now....It's been about three months since I found out that I have more feelings for him. Where is the line between being friendly and something more?

I can find the Aiden on the app - connect to it - add my wifi 

But when it goes back to the main screen of the app - it shows its 'connecting' and that it can take up to 5 mins.

everytime I tried to do this - the app times out and finally gives me a 'connection failed' screen.

I have tried the following troubleshooting steps:

1. unplugged Aiden 

2. Factor reset Aiden

3. reset iPhone

4.rebooted router

5.unistalled iOS Fellow app

6.signed in and out of Fellow app

I can tell that the Aiden is getting online somehow - as the time is set correctly and when I try to change the Time on the Aiden itself - it says I can't unless I turn off connectivity. Also, I was able re add the 4 custom profiles for the coffees the Aiden came with via the QR code on the card from the inside Aiden's box.

Is there anything I can do to that isn't listed above to try to regain connectivity to the iOS app?

Here are answers to some of the most common last-minute concerns folks have when it comes to casting their vote. If your question isn’t answered below, take a look at [kqed.org/electionexplainersWe’re the Bay Area’s NPR station, and we get a lot of questions about voting. Here are answers to some of the most common last-minute concerns folks have when it comes to casting their vote. If your question isn’t answered below, take a look at kqed.org/electionexplainers.](http://kqed.org/electionexplainers)

**Where is my closest ballot drop-box, early voting location or polling place?**

[Find yours here.](https://www.kqed.org/news/12008419/ballot-drop-off-location-near-me-early-voting-site-election-2024)

**Why am I being told to mail my ballot this week when Election Day is still a week away?** 

Bay Area election officials urged voters to mail their completed ballots by Tuesday (Oct. 29), at the latest. The final, legal deadline for mailing your ballot through USPS hasn’t actually changed: Ballots that are postmarked on or by Nov. 5 (Election Day) will still be accepted by your county elections office. 

But to be counted, your ballot has to reach them no later than Nov. 12, one week after Election Day. This is why officials urge you to err on the side of caution and mail your ballot ASAP, so that USPS has ample time to deliver them where they need to go. 

You can still mail your ballot after Tuesday of course, but you might strongly consider instead placing your ballot into a secure drop box, or hand-delivering it to a voting location or your county elections office – which you can do all the way up to when polls close at 8 p.m. on Nov. 5.

[Sign up to track your ballot](https://california.ballottrax.net/voter/), and you’ll find out where your ballot is – and if there are any issues with it – quickly.

**Does KQED have a Voter Guide?**

Yes, [it’s here ](https://www.kqed.org/voterguide)and it unpacks ballot measures and compares candidates in every race in the Bay Area.

**My ballot still hasn’t shown up yet – what do I do?**

First, [look up your voter registration at voterstatus.sos.ca.gov](https://voterstatus.sos.ca.gov/) to check your registration status, which will show you whether you’re correctly registered to vote and to which address. It should also show whether your ballot was mailed out.

If you’re correctly registered to the right address, and [your county elections office ](https://www.sos.ca.gov/elections/voting-resources/county-elections-offices)won’t mail you a ballot six days or less before Election Day (because it can’t be sure the ballot will reach you in time.) So go to your county elections office in person and request a replacement ballot at the counter.

And if [voterstatus.sos.ca.gov](https://voterstatus.sos.ca.gov/) showed you were *not* actually registered to vote, or need to re-register to update details like your address or your legal name, you always have the option of [Same Day Registration](https://www.sos.ca.gov/elections/voter-registration/same-day-reg) at an open voting location, where you can then fill out and submit your ballot, too.

**I made a mistake on my ballot. How do I fix it?**

There’s no one-size-fits-all approach to correcting a mistake on your ballot in California — how a voter corrects a goof is up to your county, and their advice for how to fix a mistake on your ballot is almost certainly printed *on* the ballot itself. So check there first.

In the Bay Area, the advice ranges from “X out the incorrect choice and fill in the oval of your actual choice” to “get a new ballot entirely.” [See what your county says here.](https://www.kqed.org/news/12003469/election-2024-how-to-correct-a-mistake-on-your-ballot-correction#how-to-correct-mistake-ballot)

And if you’ve really messed up your ballot (coffee spills happen), remember you can go to your county elections office, an early voting location or a voting site on Election Day itself to turn in your spoiled ballot there and get a new ballot you can vote with.

# What if I have problems with my signature on my ballot envelope?

A few mistakes people can make with their signatures are: Forgetting to sign their ballot envelope entirely; Accidentally signing the wrong ballot envelope in their household (i.e., mixing up your ballot with your partner’s or roommate’s ballot) or making a signature that doesn’t match the signature they made when they registered to vote.

Even if you didn’t register at the DMV, the signature on your most recent license or state ID is very likely the one to emulate – because when you register to vote online your county elections office electronically requests a copy of the signature the DMV *currently* has for you, and this information is regularly updated. And if there’s a mismatch, or you forgot to sign, your county elections office will reach out to you to resolve it as part of the process called “curing” (another reason to submit your ballot ASAP.) 

But if you’re still worried about your signature, go vote in person, if you’re able. That’s because the signature only goes on your ballot’s *envelope* — and if you’re voting in person, there’s no envelope because that ballot then goes straight into the ballot box without needing that envelope at all.

**Can anyone find out how I voted?**

No: your voting record — that is, which candidates you’ve voted for in the past — is never made public and is not findable online anywhere. 

What is technically findable online: Your political party preference on your voter registration — i.e., whether you’re registered to vote as a Republican, a Democrat or “no party preference,” also known as an independent voter.  This information isn’t available to the general public, but California law allows some of your information — including your party registration and which elections you voted in — to be released to certain people, including political candidates and anyone who will use it for “election, scholarly, journalistic or political purpose or for governmental purposes,” according to the secretary of state.

But in short, the only way someone can find out how you voted in November is if you choose to tell them.

But am I the asshole?,"I found a roommate in the new state I’m living in 7 months ago. We connected through a group through facebook. Anyway, my roommate is very off putting. Won’t say a word when I walk in the door. Never asks how my day was, none of that. He works from home. Hardly ever leaves the home. As time has gone on I would get annoying text messages about stuff “hey just to let you know you left noodles in the sink(tiny ramen noodles, top ramen shit, I’m talking maybe 1 inch long) I’d appreciate it if you cleaned out the trap that catches those otherwise it’s gonna stink up the sink.”(meanwhile this guy will go 2 weeks without doing a dish.) I’ve seen his dishes sit in the ink with milk, sauce cups, coffee, it all just sits there. He doesn’t rinse anything out. 

One time after work I got home late and put on a new movie. I noticed it had been watched like 15 minutes into the movie so I rewound it. I wake up the next morning to a 2 paragraph text saying he doesn’t appreciate how I disrespected his property and didn’t consider him…that he pays for the service and it was wrong of me to do that. I didn’t even knew he watched it, maybe his kids watched it? Also it was late I wasn’t thinking. 

I’ve got more examples but I’m drawing a blank right now. I get so upset when I see a text from him because I’m thinking “what the hell did I do now?” And the past month we finally had a discussion together when he asked if he did something wrong or if I don’t like being around him. I myself, I like my space and I isolate. I also don’t wanna be around someone who doesn’t even acknowledge my presence. I also suffer from a mental
Illness that I never know how I will be waking up. Sometimes I don’t even know what the hell im doing. I keep a lot inside and don’t let it out. He never says hi, never says anything, I’m the one with the questions trying to get to know him. Just smug about everything. He also does condescending comments to me when I ask a question or passive aggressive. So when we had this talk I finally told him. Hey look there’s time you put off this vibe that you don’t want me around so when I notice that, I’m not around. I could go into so much detail about him but I won’t. He finally understood what I was saying and agreed to it.

He’s not a bad dude. He’s just very awkward, weird. Thinks he’s always right about stuff. We’ve had good conversations and days where things seem ok. It truly feels like I’m in a damn relationship with how weird things are. Is he OCD? He’s never had a roommate before. Like I said this is mild stuff maybe not even mild but it’s annoying as hell. The other day he wanted to talk to me about something and in my head I go “what the fuck did I do now?”
And it wasn’t anything about us. It was about a new possible living situation for him. Which means he would be moving out within a month or so. 
Anyway these are some of my stories. By the way for myself. I keep to myself. I’m quiet, never blare my music or movies. Do my dishes, pick up after my dog. I clean, I cook, I’m quiet and reserved. I’ve never had issues like this before with a roommate ever. Someone constantly texting me about something wrong in the apartment. I’m tired of it. He’s got a lot of shit going on but that doesn’t excuse the shitty comments to me. I do my part around the home. I even did half of his dishes the other day since he seemed depressed. Just to help out and take stress off of him. He text me he was thankful for what I did. He’s been divorced twice. 4 kids total. I seriously am doing my best here but I finally gave up on talking to him about life, and what not. I still do my Hi’s, see ya later man, still don’t hear a word from him. He just seems pissed off at the world. We did have one talk also where he opened up about life. He complained how people never reach out to him, the church doesn’t help him, women have it better. I wanted to stop him, and say dude I’ve had the victim mentality. Get outta that shit now. It’s not good. I had a victim mentality for years. 

But he doesn’t make any changes. He never goes out, always home, isn’t active doesn’t work out, doesn’t meet people. But yet everything is everybody else’s fault???….In the past 3 days we’ve maybe said 6 sentences to each other. Like I said these stories are mild but to give an example it would be like “hey you left the remote over by the kitchen counter, hey you need to rinse out your carton for the recycling that’s not good to do(that one happened)hey you left a cup outside the sink sitting on the counter…” all that shit is stuff that would be said at some point.
