**Ever feel like your to-do list is quietly judging you?** You know, that endless scroll of tasks that somehow multiplies every time you look away. üòÖ I was there last week‚Äîknee-deep in a swamp of sticky notes and reminders when I stumbled across something that totally shifted my mindset. Spoiler: It‚Äôs *box breathing* and trust me, it‚Äôs game-changing!

**So, what‚Äôs box breathing?** It‚Äôs a breathing technique that Navy SEALs swear by, which already sounds pretty badass, right? It goes like this: inhale for 4 seconds, hold for 4 seconds, exhale for 4 seconds, hold again for 4 seconds, and repeat. Just picture a box and breathe your way around it. üó£Ô∏è

Here's how my week went:

1. **Day 1:** Started skeptical, like... really? Breathing? But after a couple of rounds, I felt *weirdly* calm. It‚Äôs like my brain unclenched a bit. ü§Ø

2. **Day 3:** Found myself using it right before jumping into deep work. And oh boy, did it clear the path. Fewer distracting thoughts and more focus. **Magic or science?**

3. **Day 5:** Noticed I was way less snappy with coworkers/family. (Sorry, guys! üò¨) The breathing became my secret weapon against chaos.

4. **Day 7:** To-do list still long, but instead of feeling overwhelmed, I felt equipped‚Äîa rare feeling for me. üìà

**Some of you might be thinking**, ""Breathing just seems too simple,"" but sometimes the simplest things are what we overlook. It‚Äôs like discovering that the key to a treasure chest was in your back pocket all along.

**Pro tip:** Pair this with your morning coffee or during mid-day slumps for a crazy boost. Your tight shoulders will thank you later.

Have any of you tried something similar? Or maybe have other simple ""mind hacks"" that help turn down the volume on stress? Let‚Äôs swap stories!

I went on a crazy BP monitoring phase about 4 months ago after a very high reading at my Psych doc's office. (Anxiety). Their cuff was measuring 160/110.  Started Propranolol 60mg daily (prescribed by the psych doc), and had readings pretty consistently in the 120-130 / 80-90 after a few days of taking them. I quit paying attention to it after that. 

Now, a few months later, I'm trying to get myself off one of the Anti-depressants (Mirtazapine) because of the weight gain. I've put on 30lbs and am as heavy as I've ever been in life. The drug is also a wonderful sleep aid and is prescribed off label for sleep all the time. 

The result is, I've not slept well in the last week at all, maybe 2-4 hours a night. On top of that, I'm now 30lbs heavier, woke up and ate nothing, drank only coffee and had a terrible sodium bomb of a meal the night before. 

So color me shocked when I went in for a Crown this morning and my BP was 160/100 again. They took it several times before booting me from my appointment. 

I'm not mad at them, mind you. I understand why. I'm mad at myself and this situation. I'm currently running about 140/90 ish on my home cuff.

I've been doing pour overs with a Comandante C40 for a while now. I'm not only looking to upgrade, but also expand to espresso. I'll likely get the Neo Flex 2024 as it is incredible value, and I can invest more into grinders. As the title suggests, these are the options I'm considering. Which is better? Other suggestions are also welcome. I drink light to medium roasts primarily, and I'm a fan of clear tea-like brews.

With the **1zpresso route**, I'll have two separate grinders, so it's easy to switch up methods. Not that that is a huge deal, as I constantly switch from v60 to deep27 to Aeropress. This route seems to be more **user friendly** as both grinders are quite fast and easy to use. The J-Ultra is also a bit more granular, which may or may not matter.

With the **Pietro route**, I'll have one grinder with two burrs, which causes more resistance. However, this seems to be the **higher-performance** route. The M-MODAL burrs seem to be consistently superior to the ZP6, which even non-coffee people can tell. The B-MODAL burrs are a bit of a mystery. Some say it's a more refined C40 or K-Ultra. That leads me to believe that it's superior to the J-Ultra when it comes to more modern light roast espressos and Moka pot brews.

Weirdly (or maybe not), both paths *cost almost exactly the same*, \~425‚Ç¨. I haven't seen much discussion around the B-MODAL burrs, which is mainly why I'm seeking advice. This is my first post here, so please be kind to me. Thanks in advance!",0,1752861899.0,pourover,1,0.33,False
1m39g9p,https://www.reddit.com/r/CoffeeBrewerReviews/comments/1m39g9p/does_peets_coffee_dark_roast_kcup_pods_deliver/,Does Peet's Coffee Dark Roast K-Cup Pods Deliver Bold Flavor? Review Inside!,"Peet's Coffee has always been a cherished name among coffee lovers, and the Peet's Coffee 1000135 Dark Roast K-Cup Pods showcases its appeal. As someone who enjoys my daily cup of coffee, I took these pods for a spin to see if they live up to the buzz. Spoiler alert: there‚Äôs a lot to like, but with a few considerations worth mentioning.

**Packaging and Presentation**  
The initial impression starts with how well the coffee pods are packed. The slim box housing the 54 count pods fits neatly on any kitchen counter without looking cluttered. What I appreciated about the packaging was the emphasis on sustainability‚Äîeach pod is designed to be fully recyclable. You just have to peel, compost the coffee grounds, and recycle the pod shell. For those conscious of their environmental footprint, that's a major thumbs up.

**Flavor and Aroma Experience**  
Nothing screams ""dark roast"" quite like the bold, smoky flavor this coffee delivers. It wakes up the senses in an instant, with a distinct depth of flavor that‚Äôs hard to miss. I even tested it with cream and sugar (because why not?), and it still retained its rich profile with a pleasant bite cutting through the added sweetness. My colleague, an espresso purist, gave it a try too‚Äîsurprisingly, it won his approval for its pronounced smoky overtones and lasting aftertaste. However, if you're someone who prefers mild blends, it might hit you as overpowering.  

**Ease of Use**  
Hands down, this is one of the easiest ways to make coffee. These pods are compatible with any Keurig machine, so there‚Äôs zero guesswork involved. I simply popped a pod into my brewer, hit a button, and within seconds, a steaming cup of dark roast goodness was ready. The consistency in brewing is commendable too. No matter which Keurig model you‚Äôre using, the pods deliver the same, reliable flavor every single time.

**Check Peet's Coffee 1000135 Dark Roast price on Amazon.**

**Positive Features**  
- Robust and smoky flavor perfect for serious coffee enthusiasts.  
- Fully recyclable pods, catering to eco-conscious drinkers.  
- Compatible with any Keurig machine, ensuring brewing convenience.  

**Areas for Improvement**  
- The bold flavor might not suit those who prefer lighter roasts.  
- Pods can occasionally drip post-brewing, requiring an extra wipe.  

**Quality of Ingredients**  
Being sourced responsibly from high-altitude coffee-growing regions of Latin America adds an extra depth to the experience. Beans grown at these altitudes tend to mature slowly, which translates to a denser coffee bean packed with flavor. This commitment to quality sourcing reflects not just in taste but also in Peet‚Äôs dedication to creating a positive impact in the communities from where they get their beans.

**Rival Brands**  
Comparing this to other Keurig-compatible dark roasts, like Starbucks' or Green Mountain varieties, Peet's Coffee confidently holds its ground. Its distinguishable smoky tones and intensity set it apart from Starbucks, which often leans towards earthy or roasted nut profiles. Green Mountain, on the other hand, tends to be milder, which is ideal for those easing into dark roasts but feels a bit lacking when you're in the mood for something bolder. However, Peet‚Äôs might feel a bit too niche for fans of roasted blends that balance a variety of flavor notes instead of going all-in on boldness.

**Quality for Price**  
Considering the consistent taste, premium sourcing, and sustainable pods, I‚Äôd say this coffee is a worthy investment. You‚Äôre not just paying for a quick caffeine fix but for a cup of coffee that feels indulgent, not rushed. Many comparable products in this category either lack the intensity or fall short on the freshness front. With these pods, though, every cup feels deserved, as if you‚Äôve brought a small slice of an artisanal coffee shop into your morning routine.

1m39fem,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1m39fem/my_sisterinlaw_and_i_used_to_be_best_friends/,My sister-in-law and I used to be best friends,"I used to be best friends with my SIL, but now I barely consider her a friend and want distance. This post needs some context...

**College** 

My SIL and I met in college in 2012 and I was very friendly and made friends easily, while she did not. She once said, ""I didn't come to college to make friends."" But I befriended her anyway and we became close friends and eventually called eachother ""best friends"". I had other friends during this time and a couple of others I would have called ""best friend"", so she was never the only friend in the picture. 

**After college** 

After we graduated was when I started to notice some things I didn't like about her. She made snide comments all the time, was very negative, and always complained about something. It got to the point where I anticipated what she was going to complain about in every conversation. It was tiring but I kept on being her friend and planning coffee dates multiple times a month. 

*Side note: I am a Christian. I am a loving person and have delt with people's negative personalities for a long time and just kept hanging on to relationships that did not serve me in the name of ""loyalty"". My first friendship break-up was when I was 30 years old. I have grown up with a people-pleasing tendency. I have gone to counseling about this and am actively working on it. No more dealing with pleasing people and always being the nice one. I am done.* 

I kept being friends with her and just felt like this was probably part of normal friendship. We have a lot in common and have had good times but after all the negativity I felt myself pulling away and not planning as many things with her.

**The Awkward Moment (2023-ish)**

Fast forward several years. I got married to her brother (who is so different from her, he is an amazing person). I got pregnant a few months after my ""former best friend"" turned SIL went through a miscarriage. I visited her and brought her a meal and some cookies. I cried with her and spent 3 hours with her that day. I didn't bring up the miscarriage after that. 

Then I noticed that she ignored me for 2 months. We went to a few get-togethers with friends and she did not say hi or even make eye contact with me at all. So I decided to confront her about it. When I did she said that ""I was not there for her"" when she went through her miscarriage. I felt really bad and apologized but that has always bothered me because I thought that spending 3 hours with her and bringing her a meal was ""being there for her"". Was I the only friend she was relying on her to ""be there for her""?...I never talked to her about this though.

**Present-day**

I have never felt comfortable around her since then. I don't feel like getting together. I dread family get togethers (which are mostly on major holidays, thankfully). I just get an icky feeling/vibe from her now. I think that she thinks everything is fine/normal between us. I think it is years of built up resentment/bitterness on my part. I wish I told her how I felt years ago,  but now it probably won't solve anything. Even if I were to bring it up, she's not going to change and it might make things worse between us and awkward at familiy gatherings. 

She doesn't have many close friends (she will even admit that) and I now understand why after all these years. 

I am about to have baby #2 and she is pregnant with her first. I don't really feel excited for her, just indifferent. She is just a SIL to me, not a best friend but I feel obligated to involve her/invite her to things. I definitely don't initiate anything/text her unless I absolutely need to. I've definitely distanced, but what should I do from now on? Especially since out kids will most likely be growing up together in the same city. ",2,1752861840.0,Advice,1,1.0,False

**College** 

My SIL and I met in college in 2012 and I was very friendly and made friends easily, while she did not. She once said, ""I didn't come to college to make friends."" But I befriended her anyway and we became close friends and eventually called eachother ""best friends"". I had other friends during this time and a couple of others I would have called ""best friend"", so she was never the only friend in the picture. 

**After college** 

After we graduated was when I started to notice some things I didn't like about her. She made snide comments all the time, was very negative, and always complained about something. It got to the point where I anticipated what she was going to complain about in every conversation. It was tiring but I kept on being her friend and planning coffee dates multiple times a month. 

*Side note: I am a Christian. I am a loving person and have delt with people's negative personalities for a long time and just kept hanging on to relationships that did not serve me in the name of ""loyalty"". My first friendship break-up was when I was 30 years old. I have grown up with a people-pleasing tendency. I have gone to counseling about this and am actively working on it. No more dealing with pleasing people and always being the nice one. I am done.* 

I kept being friends with her and just felt like this was probably part of normal friendship. We have a lot in common and have had good times but after all the negativity I felt myself pulling away and not planning as many things with her.

**The Awkward Moment (2023-ish)**

Fast forward several years. I got married to her brother (who is so different from her, he is an amazing person).

1m39cwl,https://i.redd.it/0u5y5trq9odf1.png,US Threatens Tariffs on Brazil to Protect Political Ally,"The US has threatened to impose 50% tariffs on Brazilian goods as ex-President Jair Bolsonaro faces prosecution. 

Details. New tariffs, scheduled for August 1, will apply to all Brazilian exports. These include agricultural products (orange juice, beef, coffee), energy and minerals (oil, aluminium) and manufactured goods, such as drone components and aircrafts.

‚ñ∫The Supreme Court of Brazil took measures against social media companies that failed to ban specific accounts ‚Äî mostly those spreading misinformation about the 2022 presidential elections ‚Äî leading to Trump accusing Brazil of attacking US tech companies and ‚Äúwitch-hunting‚Äù Jair Bolsonaro.

‚ñ∫ President Lula plans to use a recently passed law of reciprocity, which grants the presidency the power to respond to trade barriers if negotiations fail, by implementing a 50% counter-tariff on US imports.

Context. Despite Trump‚Äôs claims, the US had a trade surplus with Brazil last year, selling more goods than it purchases ‚Äî remaining Brazil's second-largest trading partner.

‚ñ∫ Bolsonaro has been a close ally of Trump, not only in economic policy but also in political positions regarding Israel and Venezuela.

‚ñ∫ He and several associates are facing trial over attempts to overturn the 2022 election results, including plotting to assassinate Lula and install a military dictatorship.

‚ñ∫ President Lula has been seeking closer ties with China, recently agreeing to a currency swap deal. Amid the ongoing tariff war between the US and the EU, Mercosur ‚Äî the major South American economic bloc ‚Äî has signed a trade agreement with several EU countries.

Important to Know. Trump‚Äôs tariffs are an attempt to help Bolsonaro regain eligibility for the 2026 elections. If Bolsonaro were to return to power, Brazil would shift back into the American sphere of influence and become a strong ally for the upcoming imperialist conflict.

‚ñ∫ The US still holds significant economic leverage over Brazil. Lula would have to speed up trade negotiations with alternative partners to minimise the tariff damage. But if Brazil responds with reciprocal tariffs, these would also harm US exports.

‚ñ∫ Lula will attempt to use these tariffs to galvanise the population and increase his own popularity. The tariffs are also immediately harmful to Brazil‚Äôs largest capitalists, who might move away from Bolsonaro because of them.",2,1752861687.0,Politsturm,0,1.0,False

1m39c0l,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1m39c0l/theres_a_song_about_the_appalachian_mountains_and/,"There's a song about the Appalachian mountains, and it might be in your DNA","I'm a geneticist, the first college graduate in my family (my mom left Appalachia at 17, for a waitressing job and a fisherman in Alaska, my dad was the fisherman) and I can honestly say it's a fantastic career. I love what I do, and up until recently I wouldn't have traded it for anything in the world. Now‚Ä¶ I'm almost wishing I had never left Alaska.¬†



First of all I want to say for the record that both my parents are some of the smartest, best people I know. My mom knows every plant there is basically, and she can recognize local plant life on sight, naming it's genus and species, what it does, and where it‚Äôs native to. When I was a kid she would take me on a walk and say, ‚ÄúOkay Sammy, I need you to find me something that‚Äôs safe to eat.‚Äù And I would run off into the woods and come back with something. The fun thing about that game was that a lot of plants native to Alaska are edible, so it was pretty easy to try and stump her by bringing random bark or something like that. Although, it was pretty hard to stump her. Whatever I brought back she would teach me about its properties, what it can do, and what the best way to use it is. If she didn‚Äôt know for sure, we would take a sample of it home and check to see if it was in any of her books.



Every once in a while she would tell me a little about Kentucky, she lived in this little town right at the base of black mountain. Sometimes while she and I were hiking behind our house after school, I would get to hear about some of the rare plants she found as a kid while hiking through the hills she grew up in. Red Elderberry, Hobblebush, the cool thing is after painting a word picture so descriptive I almost could've drawn it myself, she would go on to pull out a notebook or paper scrap (which she always seemed to have with her) and draw me a beautiful picture of the plant. She gifted me that notebook when I left for college, and I spent some of my spare time pasting in the loose drawings and adding descriptions, or little notes.



I never really asked her questions about her childhood. Whenever I asked about Kentucky she would talk about the plants, or sometimes tell me something about her family (she had seven siblings). But when I asked more complicated questions, she would give me an evasive reply. When I was a kid I figured she just preferred talking about plants. As I got older, I assumed the past might be too painful for her to talk about.



¬†Sometimes while gathering food for dinner, or herbs for her medicine cabinet (Mushrooms Magic Cabinet she called it, for some reason) she would stop and kneel down to show me something, usually going on to sketch it for me too. She always said she wanted me to understand the rich world of natural science, and plant remedies. I'm glad she taught me about that, on those long afternoon hikes through woods so thick I wondered how many hundreds of years it had been since someone else had tread on our same path.¬†



My mom used to purchase the old encyclopedias that salesmen sometimes hawked door to door. She paid a ton extra once to have color picture encyclopedias delivered to our house, in NoWheresLand Alaska. When she showed my dad the bill he just sighed, kissed her on the head and said, ‚Äúthe price of having an intelligent wife.‚Äù



My dad is basically a walking farmers almanac. He‚Äôll glance up at a clear blue sky and say in that deep mountain drawl of his, ‚ÄúAh hate when the weather takes a turn lahk that.‚Äù And the next day a storm will sweep through, knocking down trees and blowing out power lines.¬†



I asked him once how he got a super power like that, and he said, ‚ÄúWorkin‚Äô on boats, Meery, you either learn the sea or the sky, or both. If you learn the sky you'll survive, if you learn the sea you'll manage on the job, but if you learn both you'll find a second home.‚Äù (Both my parents had their own individual nicknames for me, based on my full name: Samira).



Honestly I always felt the same way about the forest. If you know the sky well enough to predict the weather, and the land well enough to know what's healing, you'll be okay. The forest is a great home for anyone willing to learn from it. Or so I thought.



I won‚Äôt lie. I had an awesome childhood.¬†



I spent my time split between Earth and sea, learning from one or both of my parents. Dad would take me out on the fishing boat and teach me how to run it, mom would take me into the mountains and teach me about plants. Back then schools in that part of Alaska could be pretty lax, which meant I got a lot of time to learn from the two best teachers I ever could have asked for. I know it's not like that for every kid, I got lucky.¬†



When I graduated from my dinky little highschool, I took a full ride scholarship in North Carolina, right at the base of the Appalachians. The only time my parents visited me during college was when I graduated, first with my bachelors, then my masters, then my doctorate. They came to all three graduations, even though every time my mom was looking around like she expected someone to jump her, and my dad clutched her arm like she might just float away.



I didn‚Äôt think about it as hard as I should have. My mom lived in Kentucky, not North Carolina, so I assumed (and I feel guilty about this now) that my sweet backwoods parents were just nervous being in such big crowds. And even though I was a little hurt that they didn‚Äôt spend any weekends visiting me at college, I waved it away because they were probably just scared to leave home. I didn‚Äôt give either of them the credit they deserve. To be honest, I didn‚Äôt give their fear the credit it deserved. Looking back I realize now that I assumed I was just smarter than them. I‚Äôm not, and if I had realized that sooner it would have saved a lot of people a lot of pain.



After I graduated I began looking for a job. Finding a job as a geneticist isn‚Äôt usually like trying to find a job with a degree in something like‚Ä¶ I don‚Äôt know, business. You don‚Äôt go on indeed and submit 40 applications, you talk to your professors, you make contacts during school with people you hope will offer you a job after you graduate. I got four job offers, one in Seattle Washington, one in Pittsfield Massachusetts, one in Texas, and one in California.¬†



California and Texas got ruled out instantly, too hot for me. Seattle was harder, I loved the idea of being on the water again, and my dads route sometimes took him close to the Seattle coast so maybe I could see him more frequently. But there was just something about Massachusetts that called to me. I discussed the options with my mom, and when I told her that I was thinking about taking the job in Massachusetts all she said was, ‚ÄúIf you think that‚Äôs a good idea.‚Äù



Again, I made the mistake of assuming she just didn't want me to be so far away. I assured her over and over that I would come home for Christmas, birthdays, and every important holiday, but it didn‚Äôt seem to make any difference for that strange sad tone she held in her voice every time we talked about it.



Finally, I threw caution to the wind and accepted the job. I moved to Massachusetts in October, and that was when things first started to get weird. It started with my mom. She called me on my first day there and our conversation started out normal enough.



She seemed cheerful as she asked, ‚ÄúSo what do you think of the house? Does it look like it did in the pictures?‚Äù



I glanced around at my living room, ‚ÄúWell it‚Äôs a lot smaller than the pictures made it look, but the wood floors are gorgeous and they seem to be in perfect condition. I‚Äôve got a huge front porch and I‚Äôm really excited to put some furniture out there, maybe a hammock or something.‚Äù I walked into the kitchen, getting more into my narration now. ‚ÄúThe kitchen is about the same size as the one in that air BnB we stayed in a few years ago.‚Äù



She laughed, ‚ÄúSo, postage stamp sized?‚Äù



I joined her laughter, ‚ÄúYes. But the fridge is a pretty new model, and the oven seems to be in good condition. About as much storage space as my college dorm room, but I can work around that. Oh and there‚Äôs this super cool brick support beam at the corner between my living room and kitchen, and it runs all the way through the house up into the attic where I have my bedroom, which makes that area feel really cool and chic.‚Äù



Her smile shone through in her voice, ‚ÄúYou always have loved that old school chic style. What‚Äôs your bedroom like? Is it big enough?‚Äù



I nodded as I started climbing the stairs to my attic room, ‚ÄúYeah it‚Äôs basically the size of the first floor, and I have my own little ensuite bathroom up there which is awesome. There‚Äôs also a nice big window in there, and I think that‚Äôs where I want to put my desk. Then my bed can go across the room, and I‚Äôll still have plenty of space.‚Äù



I know my mom pretty well, and her tone seemed to shift from truly upbeat to forced lightness, ‚ÄúDo you have curtains for your windows? And is the only bathroom upstairs? That‚Äôll be annoying when you have guests.‚Äù



I glanced at the empty curtain bar and the stack of blackout curtains on the floor next to it with a sigh, ‚ÄúYeah I really should get my curtains hung tonight, or I won‚Äôt sleep very well. You know how badly I need my blackout curtains. And no, there‚Äôs a half bath in the laundry room on the first floor. I don‚Äôt have a garage, but that‚Äôs fine I would honestly rather have the laundry room. It‚Äôs just off the kitchen, and there‚Äôs a back door in the laundry room too to get out on the back porch.‚Äù



Her voice got more serious, ‚ÄúDo your doors have deadbolts?‚Äù



I had made my way back downstairs by that point and I glanced at the solid wood front door, ‚ÄúBack door yes, front door no.‚Äù



‚ÄúAnd you have curtains for all the windows? Not just your bedroom?‚Äù



I rolled my eyes, ‚ÄúYeah, but I can wait a while before I hang those.‚Äù



She paused then said, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not trying to be bossy, but that needs to be a priority. I‚Äôll order you a pizza or something so you don‚Äôt have to worry about cooking tonight. But get those curtains up tonight, before the sun goes down please.‚Äù



I smiled, ‚ÄúThanks mom, I really appreciate that. I‚Äôll text you my new address so you can do that. You‚Äôre the best.‚Äù



She replied, ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs my pleasure sweetheart. Do you have a lot to unpack?‚Äù



I glanced at the few boxes that were scattered around, ‚ÄúNot really. The movers did a lot of the hard work for me. My dishes are in the dishwasher and I‚Äôll put them away later. And I can put my clothes away pretty slowly.‚Äù



She asked, ‚ÄúHas anyone told you what to do yet?‚Äù



I laughed, ‚ÄúMom, I haven‚Äôt even had my first day at work yet. I have no idea what my job responsibilities are.‚Äù



There was no laughter in her voice, ‚ÄúListen to me carefully Samira, please. I‚Äôm not going to say this more than once for fear of you thinking I‚Äôve lost my marbles so you‚Äôd better take notes.‚Äù



I had a flashback instantly to the time when I was little and I almost stepped on a snake. I remember my mom yelling, in this stern voice that sounded nothing like her, ‚ÄúSamira! Stop right there!‚Äù



I remember stopping with my foot in the air, looking down, and nearly peeing myself when I saw the snake curled up right in front of me. How I missed it but she spotted it from ten yards away I still don‚Äôt know, but her tone gave me the exact same feeling now. I ran to grab a pen and paper and told her when I was ready.



She took a deep breath like this was going to take a lot out of her and said, ‚ÄúFirst, no whistling at night. Ever. Not even to call the dog inside, you hear? You don't know what else will hear you whistling and come running.‚Äù I didn‚Äôt have a dog yet, but I knew better than to interrupt. ‚ÄúSecond, close the blinds at night. I don‚Äôt care if you're on the ground floor, penthouse, or in the basement. If you have a window the blinds need to close as soon as the sun starts going down. If you can see out, other things can see in.Third, find an acorn and put it on your windowsill, preferably the one in your bedroom but anywhere will work. Now I know you Sammy, and I know you‚Äôll stop taking notes when you don‚Äôt understand what I‚Äôm saying, so keep on taking notes and just trust me, okay?‚Äù



I giggled, she had totally caught me. My notes right now said:



1. No whistling at night
2. Close the blinds at night (duh)
3. Acorn?



I went back and added ‚Äúput acorn on windowsill‚Äù then said, ‚ÄúOkay I‚Äôm still taking notes, what‚Äôs next?‚Äù



Instead of going on she said, ‚ÄúRead back to me what you have so far, exactly as it‚Äôs written down.‚Äù



I sighed but did as I was told, and she said, ‚ÄúAlright that‚Äôs good enough. Four, always carry a flashlight, keep a good penlight in your purse and never trust a light you see at night that doesn‚Äôt come from you or your home. Do you understand?‚Äù



I nodded, remembered she couldn‚Äôt see me, and coughed out in a dry voice, ‚ÄúYeah, carry a light always and don‚Äôt trust lights that aren‚Äôt mine‚Ä¶ Yeah I don‚Äôt know if I follow. Do you mean like don‚Äôt stand in front of lights on the road? I did that once when I was five mom, and you can‚Äôt blame me, the midnight sun makes everyone weird.‚Äù



The midnight sun in Alaska is this phenomenon where the sun disappears almost completely in the winter, then stays up for 20 hours or so (sometimes more, depending on where you are in Alaska) in the summer. When I was really little, apparently I would point to any light source and say ‚Äúsunrise?‚Äù Including standing in the middle of the road and pointing at an oncoming truck.¬†



You can‚Äôt blame me for being confused. You try going to bed and waking up in the dark, getting an hour of light, and then being plunged back into darkness.



Finally my mom let out a dry laugh and said, ‚ÄúYou‚Äôll get what I mean later, just remember to carry your light okay. Five, don‚Äôt trust any voices or music you hear after dark. If you hear my voice asking you to come outside and help me with my bags there‚Äôs something I need you to know. *I will never come visit you out there.* Understood?‚Äù



I got a cold chill even as her words made my cheeks blush furiously. She had hurt my feelings, and to be honest if she had told me this before I took the job, I probably would have gone to Seattle. ‚ÄúMom-‚Äù



She cut me off, ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not because I don‚Äôt love you, and it sure isn‚Äôt because I don‚Äôt miss you. But you need to have that in your head, don‚Äôt trust any of the voices you hear at night, no matter who they sound like. Make my voice sleep on the front porch and see what it looks like in the morning.‚Äù She sighed and we sat with the dead air for a long time before she went on. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry Sammy. I‚Äôm not doing a great job, I just don‚Äôt- I hoped you would stay away from Appalachia, that‚Äôs all. Call me any time, and be safe. Okay?‚Äù



I nodded, feeling hurt and not knowing what to do with it but I said, ‚ÄúOf course mom, I love you.‚Äù



She said, ‚ÄúI love you too. And I have one more thing for you to write down.‚Äù



I slid the paper back over to me with an eye roll that I was glad she couldn‚Äôt see, ‚ÄúNumber six. Fire away.‚Äù



She said, ‚ÄúYou may have grown up in the Alaskan wilderness, but that is nothing compared to the wilds of Appalachia. Don‚Äôt you go thinking you can do a solo hike at night or something else crazy, just because of where you grew up. You are Alaskan at heart, not an Appalachian. Don‚Äôt test the wilderness.‚Äù



I wrote down *Don‚Äôt test the wilderness*, and said, ‚ÄúOkay no solo night time hikes while whistling and chit chatting with the voices in my head. Got it.‚Äù



Instead of laughing she just said, ‚ÄúPlease come home Samira. You don‚Äôt need to-‚Äù I heard what sounded like a muffled sob and then my dad came on the line.



He said, ‚ÄúHey Meery, just wanted to say hi and I love you. Your mom misses you somethin‚Äô awful.‚Äù



I nodded and gulped down the sob building in my own throat, ‚ÄúDad is mom okay?‚Äù



I expected him to chuckle and assuage my fears but instead he said, ‚ÄúShe‚Äôs the okayest she‚Äôs ever been, it‚Äôs you we‚Äôre worried about. If Appalachia gets to be too much you can always come back to Alaska. Just remember that sweetheart. We‚Äôll help you find a job. It‚Äôs not starting over or giving up if all you‚Äôre doing is coming back home.‚Äù



I wasn‚Äôt sure I agreed, but I hung up after saying goodbye and I love you about a thousand more times. I figured I wouldn‚Äôt hear from my mom again for a while, but she called me every single night for the first month. She never referenced our first conversation except the occasional ‚ÄúDid you remember to close your blinds?‚Äù Or the one time she asked if I had found an acorn for my windowsill yet. I had, and I sent her a picture of the acorn sitting on my window ledge to make her feel better. She sent me back a thumbs up, and my dad texted me ‚Äúthat‚Äôs a damn good acorn, Meers.‚Äù



As a result my first month all alone in a rental house in Appalachia was extremely boring. My routine became pretty simple: get home from work, make dinner, close the blinds while talking to mom, then relax and go to bed. My weekends were similar. I would wake up, open all the blinds, make some coffee and maybe breakfast, then unpack something. After the first month she stopped calling every day, although we still usually talked every day, at least over text.. Before long we settled into a nice routine, where we would call each other every couple of days. It wasn‚Äôt remotely the same as being in the same house as her, but it was still good.



Then after a while,¬† I got to start working on my first really big project. Genetic memory in regards to evolutionary advantages, safety, and (drum roll please) folklore. It turns out that some stories just seem to pop up naturally, whether they‚Äôve been taught or not. Don‚Äôt wander through the woods alone? Every culture has some kind of folklore with that message. There are all sorts of stories that just seem to occur to people naturally. Even more interesting is that genetic memory seems to work for some really random things, like for example a specific tune.



First of all, here‚Äôs how genetic memory works. Let‚Äôs say you‚Äôre obese. There‚Äôs a really good chance that someone, somewhere back in your family lineage went through a famine. So their DNA basically built in safeguards for their future ancestors to survive a famine. But, if you‚Äôre living in a modern day first world country you probably won‚Äôt experience famine, so your body is just retaining resources because of that ancestor. The same is true for schizophrenia, a lot of researchers now believe schizophrenia is basically a mistyped genetic code, designed for survival but tweaked just a little bit by some force of nature. I spoke with a psychiatrist who said that individuals with schizophrenia tend to be excellent at pattern detection, and paranoia (one of the symptoms) can be helpful in a true life or death situation.



My team was working on studying which genetic lines held the same core memory for this one specific tune. I‚Äôm not great at music but the tune is basically a three second high note, two second lower note (like a dip), the same three second high note followed by a two second higher note (like going up a hill), a sustained three notes, another one second dip, and another two second lower note. Try it. You‚Äôll recognize it.



Everyone on my team spent roughly three months humming this tune constantly, I would hum it as I drove to and from work, while I did dishes, while taking the garbage out. It was familiar to most of us, especially the people who had grown up in and around the general area we‚Äôre in now, but based on our studies with the control group, people from all over might automatically know or recognize the tune.



The only people who said they didn‚Äôt recognize it were the few members of our team from different countries, though even the guy from the UK who looks so pale it‚Äôs like his printer ran out of ink recognized it. I recognized it too, which I didn‚Äôt think was very meaningful, but I was excited to be part of the group. We spent six months studying the genetic strands of our participants, and found that all the people in our trial study shared the same basic genetic makeup. Once we had that down, all we had to do was figure out what was so special about this tune, why was it being passed down literally through DNA?



A lot of my coworkers and I started spending our free time together, doing things like escape rooms, rage rooms (a few things that didn‚Äôt happen in rooms), and the occasional hike. While out on one of these hikes one of my teammates proposed a camping trip.



I won‚Äôt lie, my moms warning briefly entered my head, but it wasn‚Äôt like I was going camping alone, I would be in a huge group of people. What was there to worry about?



The group that wound up going on the trip consisted of me, a woman my age named Marybell who told us if anyone called her that she‚Äôd bury us all under the mountain (Mary is okay, Bella is okay, Marybell is not okay), a guy named Scott, a guy named Gabriel, a woman named Lana, and a guy who looks like a¬† faded picture, named Leano.¬†



Interestingly, I was one of the only people with any connection to Appalachia who agreed to go on the camping trip. The Friday before we all went out my supervisor, an older woman with beautiful dark skin and gorgeous curly hair named Nora, pulled me aside and asked to speak to me.



Once we were alone she said, ‚Äúare you going on that camping trip?‚Äù



I smiled, ‚ÄúYeah I am. Do you want to come too?‚Äù



She looked more stern than she did the day I broke a vial of samples, ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt you know better?¬† Excuse me for being blunt, but I thought you had family from this area. Don‚Äôt you know better than to go out in those mountains at night?‚Äù



I had told her that my mom was from here, and I offered an apologetic smile, despite feeling insulted and a little confused, ‚ÄúMy mom left Kentucky when she was seventeen, way before she had me. I grew up in Alaska, so I‚Äôm pretty used to the wilderness. And if you ask my mom, I‚Äôm Alaskan, not Appalachian.‚Äù



Nora lifted her hands in a surrender gesture, ‚ÄúIf you think you can handle it. Just be safe, try to keep the rest of them safe too.‚Äù I gave my assent and stood to leave, as I exited the room she called out one final piece of advice, ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt whistle.‚Äù



I chuckled uncomfortably, but a chill ran up my spine.¬†



On Saturday I woke up when it was still dark outside, grabbed all my supplies, and jumped in my car. It was 3 in the morning, we wanted to start our first day early so we could find a place to set up camp and just relax for a while. One of the guys knew a place near a waterfall in the mountains, and we planned on trying to find a spot nearby to set up. He said it was about an 8 mile hike from where we would park to where we would end up. Depending on terrain and our walking speeds, that could be a three to five hour hike, which is why I packed everything into my car, locked it, then went back inside to make a large thermos of coffee to drink while driving to the parking area.



I opened the kitchen blinds so I could keep my eye on my car (I‚Äôm paranoid about leaving that much stuff in my car when I‚Äôm not in it) while I made my coffee. I ground the beans, my eyes resting blurrily on my cell phone as I flipped through videos while trying to wake up.¬†



Once the coffee was ready and sitting in my thermos, I went to the front door, locked it, and made my way back to my car. About ten feet past my car, which was still a couple yards ahead of me, a deer stood in the shadow cast by one of the large trees on the property. I stopped to admire it, feeling a pang of homesickness as I thought about my mom.



Much to my surprise, the deer began to approach me. Deer in Alaska are pretty brave from what I hear about other places, but even there wild animals don‚Äôt normally approach you at random, in the middle of the night, when they aren‚Äôt used to you yet.



An alarm bell went off vaguely in my head, and I rushed around to the driver side door of my car, got in and locked the door. I felt a little silly being so paranoid, but it was dark and my fear that the animal might have rabies or something was pretty strong. I took a deep breath once I was buckled in and looked around to see where the deer had gone. It was still roughly where I had seen it before, standing in the shadows near the tree line. It could have been my imagination, but it looked for a moment as though the deer leaned against the tree nearest to it, like it was trying to get on two legs.



I shivered as I started my car, swung it around onto the road, and started driving. I glanced back at the deer, and for a second I could have sworn I saw it standing on its rear legs. Not braced against the trunk of the tree, but standing firmly on its two rear legs, it stepped out of the shadow and I saw its face was entirely bone as though the skin had all been pulled off. Then I turned a corner and I couldn‚Äôt see it any more, what must have been an optical illusion was gone, and replaced only by darkness.



I was the last person to arrive at the parking lot where we were all meeting, but I was quickly forgiven when I shared the thermos of coffee and asked, ‚ÄúSo is it normal for deer to walk around on two legs out here?‚Äù



Marybell rolled her eyes, ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt start, it‚Äôs way too early for pranks.‚Äù



I chuckled, but made a face at her, ‚ÄúWho says I‚Äôm making a prank, I‚Äôm really asking.‚Äù



Marybell lifted an eyebrow, as Scott slung an arm around me, ‚ÄúTell me what this nifty two legged deer was like Sammy-Rah.‚Äù



I rolled my eyes and shrugged his arm off, side-stepping to put some distance between us, ‚ÄúI came out of my house this morning and there was a deer standing off in the shadows staring at me. As I was getting ready to leave, it got up on its back two legs and started walking at me. I got in my car and left, but I could still see it standing on two feet as I was driving away.‚Äù



As I spoke, the group's collective smile began to fade into a vaguely concerned frown. All of a sudden I felt the distance, just how far away I really was from Alaska. It made me miss my parents.¬† Briefly considered telling them about the face made of bone, but if their reactions to the information I had already shared was any indication, they weren‚Äôt going to be inclined to believe me.



Then Leano laughed and said, ‚ÄúI see, she does prank us. This is to set the tone? So to speak. Yes?‚Äù



It took me a moment to process what he said, but when I did I decided to run with it. I didn‚Äôt want the group thinking I had a screw loose. So I just smiled and said, ‚ÄúGotcha.‚Äù



Leano laughed uproariously, and the rest of the group gave me a mixture of eyerolls and chuckles that, at least, made me feel like one of the gang. I figured I could worry about the weird deer later, I mean honestly it wasn‚Äôt that big of a deal. We gathered our things, locked our cars, and started the long hike just as the sky began to lighten in the East. By the time the sunrise graced us with its explosion of colors across the Eastern sky, we had made it probably two miles into our hike. I was already exhausted.



I hiked a lot with my parents and friends back in Alaska, we even did lots of camping trips where basically all we did was hike or swim. But the trail we were on was steep in some areas, rocky in most areas, and hard to set a rhythm with. As a result I felt like I was constantly bumping into people, getting ahead or falling behind.



By the time we took a break to eat, I think we were all wondering why we had signed up for this. Even Leano, who usually has an almost annoyingly positive attitude, looked silent, paler than ever, and just a little unhappy. My spirits plummeted. If Leano was having a bad time, the rest of us were screwed.



We got our packs back on our shoulders, looked around at each other as if to say, ‚Äòwe may as well finish what we started‚Äô and got back on the trail. Just before I was getting ready to say that we should turn back and go see a movie or something, there was a bend in the trail, and we were looking out over the most stunning landscape I‚Äôve ever seen.



I need you to understand, I‚Äôm from Alaska. ‚ÄúStunning landscape‚Äù should be old hat to me, everything there is stunning. But there was something about the way the world looked, stretched out below me in a tie-dye of colors, oranges and greens, the blue water I could see in a few places, and beyond that a sky line that seemed to stretch on forever.



I didn‚Äôt hear myself gasp but Marybell stopped next to me and said, ‚ÄúI know right? Every time I come out in the wilderness I get that same feeling. Awe doesn‚Äôt even begin to describe it.‚Äù



I nodded at her, grateful she understood, ‚ÄúYeah, I thought Alaska had the monopoly on beauty in nature. I didn‚Äôt- I wonder why my mom left this place?‚Äù



The words just kind of popped out of me, but Marybell took them seriously. ‚ÄúOh is your mom from Massachusetts?‚Äù



I shook my head, ‚ÄúNo, Kentucky. But she grew up in the Appalachian mountains, or like right at the base of Black Mountain. She used to tell me stories sometimes‚Ä¶ I don‚Äôt really get why she left. Although she would probably say the same thing about me leaving Alaska.‚Äù



Marybell‚Äôs eyebrows shot up, ‚ÄúI think I understand.‚Äù



I lifted my own eyebrows, waiting for her to respond, but she turned away and kept moving, as if she hadn‚Äôt just left our conversation in the middle.¬†



When we got to our campgrounds we all went and set up our tents first, I‚Äôm guessing I wasn‚Äôt the only person who was thinking a nap on my sleeping bag sounded perfect. When I finished setting my tent up I stepped back and looked around to see if anyone else needed my help. Pretty much all of us had our own little one or two person tents. Marybell seemed to have finished first and was helping Lana. Gabriel and Scott were apparently sharing a tent, and working together on it, and Leano was already done, and putting rocks in a circle to form a fire pit. I went over and started helping with sourcing and arranging rocks, then we collected some fire wood and got everything set aside, ready to go for when we needed it.

1m39btj,https://www.reddit.com/r/TestedAtHome/comments/1m39btj/why_is_the_stanley_camp_pour_over_coffee_maker/,Why Is the STANLEY Camp Pour Over Coffee Maker Perfect for Outdoors?,"Stanley The Camp Pour Over Set, featuring the classic Hammertone Green design, became my companion in the search for great coffee moments, and it's been an interesting experience. If you're like me and love coffee brewed with care, precision, and simplicity, this set might just hit all the right notes. Its elegant design, reusable filter, and camp-ready durability offer something different from your typical coffee maker. Let me walk you through the ins and outs of this set, from the moment I unboxed it to savoring that first cup.

**Design and Build Quality**  
The sturdy feel of the Stanley Camp Pour Over Set is something I noticed right away. Its 18/8 stainless steel construction combined with the Hammertone Green finish gives it a retro outdoor aesthetic that feels purposeful and classic. The pour-over device and the 12 oz camp mug pair seamlessly, and the included lid ensures your coffee stays warm longer, which is perfect for chilly mornings outdoors. It‚Äôs compact and lightweight enough to carry along while camping, yet it doesn‚Äôt look out of place sitting on my kitchen counter. The reusable stainless steel filter is a highlight, eliminating the need for paper filters and making it more environmentally friendly.  

**Ease of Use**  
When it comes to functionality, the process couldn't be simpler. All I had to do was add my ground coffee into the filter, place it over the mug, pour some hot water slowly, and let the device work its magic. The flow rate was consistent, and my favorite perk‚Äîno paper filter hassle! Plus, the integrated design makes for a straightforward experience even if you're new to pour-over brewing. This straightforward manual operation feels like you‚Äôre more involved in making your cup of coffee, which is quite satisfying.

**Check [Stanley The Camp Pour Over Set] price on Amazon.**  

**Positives**  
- Lifetime durability from its rugged stainless steel build  
- Reusable filter saves money and reduces waste  
- Compact and travel-friendly design  
- Includes a matching mug with a secure lid for temperature retention  

**Performance and Brewing Quality**  
I‚Äôve brewed various coffee types with this, like Ethiopian Yirgacheffe and a dark French roast, and the flavors were impressively clean and rich. Thanks to the stainless steel filter, the coffee oils aren't absorbed, giving each cup a fuller body than if brewed using paper filters. However, you might notice a slight amount of sediment in your cup, as expected from metal filters. That doesn‚Äôt bother me much‚Äîit adds a natural essence to the experience.

**Maintenance and Durability**  
One thing I value in products is their maintenance ease, and this coffee maker doesn‚Äôt disappoint. Cleaning the filter was as easy as rinsing it under warm water. Even after multiple uses, the filter still looked good as new. It‚Äôs dishwasher-safe too, although I found handwashing quicker. Over a couple of months, with daily use, there was no dent, discoloration, or loosening of materials‚Äîits durability speaks volumes about Stanley‚Äôs craftsmanship.

**Negatives**  
- Slight learning curve for achieving the perfect brew  
- Filter allows minimal sediment to seep through  
- Limited 12 oz mug size may not suit those wanting larger coffee servings  

**Other Options**  
While testing the Stanley Camp Pour Over Set, I couldn‚Äôt resist comparing it with competitors like the Hario V60 and Chemex. The Stanley impressed with its outdoor ruggedness, something neither Chemex nor Hario can match. Chemex might deliver slightly cleaner coffee, but its glass construction is fragile for camping adventures. Meanwhile, the Hario V60 offers more control over brewing techniques, but it requires paper filters, making it less sustainable. If outdoor brewing is your thing, Stanley truly excels as a reliable companion.  

**Value for Money**  
Echoing the sentiment ‚Äúbuilt for life,‚Äù the price-to-quality ratio of this product feels justified. Its longevity and reusable filter cut ongoing costs while its flexible usage indoors or outdoors adds overall utility. If you‚Äôre switching to pour-over brewing and value the gear's durability, it‚Äôs a worthy investment. Not to mention, it eliminates the reoccurring expense of paper filters, saving a considerable amount in the long run.

Both my mom and my uncle have had it for a few years and they have both been able to eat dairy products for a little over a year. Considering my levels were low, especially compared to their‚Äôs, I thought I would be okay to eat dairy as well. 

I‚Äôve been eating cheese and butter and such in moderation but using oak and almond milk in coffee. Yesterday I had a glass of milk with my breakfast, the first time since I‚Äôve gotten my results back

About 3 hours later my throat started to hurt, I thought maybe I was talking too much lol since I was at therapy. It felt like there was something in my throat so I tried drinking water. It progressively got worse. The pain traveled to my chest and the pain got worse as well. I went to urgent care not thinking it was a big deal and the doctor immediately gave me Benadryl and next thing I knew the ems was there with an ambulance! They said my tonsils were swollen and my symptoms were very concerning. It got worse before we left in the ambulance so they gave me epinephrine in my leg. 

Whew what a day. I never had a sensation like that before I didn‚Äôt even know how to describe it to the doctor. In the moment I felt ridiculous going in an ambulance but looking back, I‚Äôm glad they took such precautions. I‚Äôve never had any other allergies so I‚Äôve never dealt with something like this.

Who I‚Äôm Hoping to Connect With:

Aged 18-25 (a little older is okay if you're genuinely friendship-minded)

Based in the UK - ideally London or nearby

Interested in eventually meeting up and building a real connection

Comfortable with chatting regularly, gaming, or the occasional voice call

A Bit About Me:

‚öΩ I play football weekly & a big fan of the sport

ü§ò Into rock & metal, and always up for gigs

üéÆ Gamer (mostly single-player, story-driven stuff)

üé¢ Huge fan of theme parks, go-karting, and adrenaline-filled days out

üé¨ Into Marvel and all things nerdy

üß† Neurodivergent, emotionally self-aware, and always happy to listen

What I‚Äôm Not Looking For:

One-word replies or ghosting after a day

People just messaging out of boredom

Surface-level convos with no real intention behind them

What I Am Looking For:

Effort, consistency, and actual interest in getting to know each other

People who want to build a connection that could lead to hanging out IRL

Ideally you're into the same interests, but not required

If this sounds like something you‚Äôd be up for, feel free to message and just let me know your age, gender, location, and a bit about you, so I know you‚Äôve read this.

Yes, I smoke, I know it's bad for you and people around you, I'm being stupid etc... So please don't come at me for that!

I've (40+ F) been living in my apartment for five + years. 
I've got a balcony where I sit out most days, having my coffee, reading the news, and - of course - I smoke. 

No neighbours have ever talked to me about this, and it's completely allowed according to the rules in the building.

A few days ago, my elderly wall-to-wall neighbour, who's lived here longer than I have, told me that she can sometimes smell smoke in her apartment when her windows are open. I was not aware of/have thought of this, because it's a good distance between my balcony and her windows. 

It's a valid complaint, and I don't want to be a nuisance or cause others any inconvenience, so after she told me this I started checking if her windows were open before lighting up. I've also put a fan on my balcony to blow the smoke away from her. 

This morning, I went out with my coffee. Her windows were shut. No-one else around. The fan was on. As I'm sitting there with my cigarette, she starts talking to me about this again, because she'd gone outside, and could smell the smoke.  

So she asks me (not in a shouty or angry way) if I can go somewhere else to smoke... As if I've got a second secret balcony somewhere? 

I don't know why she's suddenly decided this is a thing, she hasn't said anything about it these past five years. I'm trying to be as considerate and accommodating as I can, but it seems a bit excessive for her to police what I do on my own property. 

We've never had anything to do with one another before this, other than a wave and a ""Hello, nice flowers!"", so there's no bad blood. I don't throw parties or the like, I'm quiet and keep to myself. 

Yes, I can go outside, but there's quite a way to go before I can find somewhere comfortable to sit and relax, and I'd have to take all my stuff (coffee, cushion etc) with me every time I move - not to speak of the weather conditions.

Am I being an a**hole for not giving up smoking on my property?

1m38yw0,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepcast/comments/1m38yw0/7_devils_bridge/,7 Devil's bridge,"South Carolina is full of ghost stories, most of them cheap thrills born of boredom or drunken dares for teenagers. But Seven Devil‚Äôs Bridge? That one stuck with me. Not because I believed in restless spirits or midnight curses, but because i was once one of those bored teenagers, and although i didn't see anything, i heard...something, I've regrated hearing ever since. I didn't believe in ghosts. I just enjoyed fear, and in a smalltown there wasn't much to do. So one day a few friends and I went to go see the Seven Devils Bridge.



The night we went to Seven Devil‚Äôs Bridge was thick with humidity, nothing new For South Carolina, it was often hot and humid. The air so still it felt like the world was holding its breath. The road leading up to the bridge was barely visible, swallowed by trees that loomed in from both sides, backroads upon backroads. My friends joked and shoved each other, their laughter sharp against the quiet, but I wasn‚Äôt laughing. I was listening, the air felt electric, and i felt something....different.



We stood on the bridge, waiting. The legend said that if you crossed at midnight, you wouldn‚Äôt make it to the other side. A lot of nonsense, I thought. Still, we were bored, and just wanted to get out of the house, this was supposed to be just another thing to do, to kill time. So I leaned against the rusted railing, staring down at the shallow creek below, waiting for something, anything to happen, to prove me wrong.



That‚Äôs when I heard it. A low cry? It was almost melodic, but broken, fragmented. 

Like sound whispering through static. My head snapped toward my friends, but they were still laughing, still shoving, completely unaware.



The sound twisted, shifting between notes, growing more distinct. Now just a hum. A voice? But the words were impossible to understand. My pulse hammered. I tried to shake it off, tried to tell myself it was the wind, the water below, some trick of my tired mind, but it was gone now, The wind blew gently, the slow flow of water in the creak droned, yet i didn‚Äôt move. The sound, whatever it was, now gone, but the feeling of being watched remained.



""what was that?"" i wasn't sure if i was asking myself, my friends or the air, my two friends looked at me amused.

""what are you actually getting freaked out?"" Dale asked, a smirk on his face, while James was dicking around on his phone....did i imagine it? 

Trying to shrug the overwhelming feeling of eyes on me i simply suggested we should go get a bit to eat on the way home, and we left, my friends still lulling about, i found myself antsy, slowing my walking to match there pace.

""get ahold of yourself pussy"" i remember telling myself before pushing my thoughts away as we drove away from Seven Devils Bridge





The drive home should have put it out of my mind. Dale and James kept up their usual antics, arguing over where to grab food, complaining about how dead the town was, but I barely heard them, there in body alone. I kept glancing at the rearview mirror, almost waiting to see something lurking behind us. Nothing. Just the empty road stretching into the night.



Then the first time I heard it again, I was alone.



It was the next morning, in my room, just before sunrise. That same sound, quiet as a hum, distant but impossible to ignore. My stomach twisted. I sat up, listening, holding my breath. It sounded closer now. Like it was inside.



I turned toward my closet, setting ajar, hadn't i closed it the night before? i couldn't remember, i couldn't be sure.

No. No way. I got up, slammed it shut. The humming faded slowly.



For a while, i just sat there, unsure of what i heard, then my alarm went off, I jolted up again as if just waking up, ""was that real...was i dreaming? the uncertainty bleeding reality into fiction. 



At school, it was worse. I was spacing out in class, (i was usually sleeping in class but i felt so wired) then i thought i heard it again. Not a cry this time. Words. Garbled, slipping between syllables like a language I knew but couldn't understand. I looked around but no one else reacted. I pressed my palms against my face, squeezing my eyes shut.



""Not real. Not real."" i thought like a mantra i could will into existence.



But when I opened them, my hands...they weren‚Äôt my hands.



They looked...wrong. Smaller? Thinner? Not mine. Not human?



I blinked, and they were normal again. A distant voice in my ear let out a sharp laugh before fading into nothing.



what i felt then wasn't just fear. i was frozen in place, the bell rang but i sat there, not moving till i heard the shovel of the next classes feet. i quickly got up, shaking, sweating, and darted out of the room and into the bathroom, after emptying my stomach and leaving the restroom i had one thought, ""Fuck This"".

Within the next 15 minutes i was getting into my friends old white chevy truck and we were peeling outta the parking lot, i remember thinking ""eh at least i showed up today"" to clarify i wasn't a great student.

For the next few days, life settled back into the usual haze of wasted hours and half-hearted decisions. No whispers. No voices. No twisted hallucinations.



I convinced myself it had all been some weird trick of exhaustion, or the mind, maybe both, maybe a leftover fear from that damn bridge. So I let it go. I spent the afternoons gaming with Dale and James, trash talking, losing track of time until the sky outside turned deep blue. I skipped school like usual, slept till noon, smoked just enough to keep reality soft around the edges.



It was easy to pretend nothing had happened. Then, it came back, like a distant hum, it came back.



I was at Dale‚Äôs place, leaned back on his busted couch, controller in hand, barely focused on some yet another match we were winning or losing. James was rolling a blunt, moaning about how expensive good weed was getting. just another day. A normal day.



And then‚Äîthe hum. Low and fractured. The kind of sound you‚Äôd hear if someone was standing just behind you, breathing words through gritted teeth, something more primal than anger. I stiffened.



James flicked his lighter, exhaling smoke. Dale cursed at the screen. Neither of them heard it. life parading on around me.



I swallowed hard, eyes darting toward the darkened hallway leading out of the living room we called home. Something was standing there, just a shape. Unmoving. Wrong.



I stared. Blinked. Gone.



I exhaled slowly, forcing a smirk, forcing myself back into the game. This wasn‚Äôt real. It wasn‚Äôt i told myself.



I took a deep inhale, letting the smoke roll through my lungs, heavier than it should‚Äôve been. Relax. That‚Äôs what I needed. That‚Äôs what I told myself.



Dale was still talking, something about his ex and how she was ‚Äúcertifiably insane.‚Äù James was focused on rolling another blunt, eyes lazily tracking the process like it was second nature. Everything was normal. I was normal. This was normal.



Then‚Äîthe sound. Subtle. Weaving between the static of the TV in the background. Like a breath beneath the silence.



I froze. focusing on the sound, trying to convince myself it was nothing. Paranoia. Overthinking.



Then, the voice came, low, sharp, slicing through the air like a blade.



""You are not alone.""



I choked on my breath, coughing violently, nearly knocking the coffee table over as i shot up and stumbled.



James frowned at me. Dale paused mid-sentence.



""You good?"" Dale asked, raising an eyebrow. I tried to speak, but my throat was locked up, my heart hammering against my ribs. Not alone? What the hell did that mean?



My head snapped toward the hallway again...nothing. But I swore I felt something standing there, watching. Breathing.



I gripped the edge of the couch, my pulse thundering, the high suffocating me instead of calming me.



James flicked his lighter, eyes narrowing. ‚ÄúYou sure your good bro? something up?‚Äù



I let out a sharp, nervous laugh. it felt loud and forced.



""Nah, man, shit just hit me harder than I expected,"" I lied, forcing a smirk, wiping sweat from my forehead.



I was not alone. And i silently hoped i was just losing my mind.



The tension had reached a breaking point. I wasn‚Äôt hiding it well anymore, i couldn't, the sleepless nights, the paranoia, the way I flinched at sounds no one else seemed to hear. Dale and James had started watching me, their jokes turning into quiet questions, uneasy glances. I could see it in their faces, they knew something was wrong.



Finally, James snapped.



‚ÄúLook, man, what the hell is up with you?‚Äù he asked, blunt tucked behind his ear, arms crossed. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôve been losing your mind ever since we went to the bridge.‚Äù



Dale nodded, leaning against his truck. ‚ÄúYeah. You ain‚Äôt exactly subtle.‚Äù



I opened my mouth to lie, to brush it off, but I couldn‚Äôt. swallowing the lump in my throat i simply asked



‚ÄúYou think it started there?‚Äù voice hollow.



James and Dale exchanged a glance.



‚ÄúI Guess...That‚Äôs the only thing that makes sense,‚Äù Dale said. ‚ÄúYou were normal before.‚Äù



That word normal, hearing it in the context hurt.



James exhaled sharply. ‚ÄúThen maybe we gotta go back.‚Äù



My pulse spiked. ‚ÄúWhat?‚Äù



He shrugged. ‚ÄúThink about it. Maybe it‚Äôs like‚Ä¶ I don‚Äôt know. maybe going back will help you chill out.‚Äù



Dale shrugged. ‚Äúfuck it why not?‚Äù



I wanted to argue, I really did. But the voice‚Äîthe one that had been whispering in my ear for days‚Äîhad said something, hadn‚Äôt it?



""Come back."" ""Fix it.""



Against every ounce of logic in my body, in cold sweat I agreed.



Seven Devil‚Äôs Bridge looked different this night.



We stood at the edge, headlights casting long shadows over the cracked pavement, the quiet suffocating from all sides.



Dale was tense. James was still trying to act casual. But I? I felt sick.



‚ÄúI don‚Äôt get it,‚Äù Dale muttered. ‚ÄúWhat are we even supposed to do?‚Äù



James shrugged. ‚ÄúSee if something happens.‚Äù



I exhaled slowly, stepping forward. The air felt wrong, like the pressure had shifted. My hands shook, but I shoved them into my hoodie pockets. I had to do this.



Then, the humming began. Not distant this time. Not faint. Loud. Surrounding us. Wrapping around us like a silent beast.



Dale cursed, stepping back. James stiffened. They heard it...they HEARD IT!



Then we saw them. Seven figures. Hanging from the bridge.



Still. Twisting. Watching. crying.



Dale moved first.



A strangled sound escaped him, something between a scream and a curse, but he didn't stop to process what he was seeing. He ran.



James followed, stumbling backward, dragging me with him. His grip was tight, nails digging into my wrist, pulling me toward the truck like he was afraid the ground might swallow us.



Yet I hesitated. Not because I wanted to stay, but because the figures had turned their heads toward us.



Seven sets of hollow, bloodshot eyes, locked onto mine. Their swollen maggot filled mouths twisted, open but not speaking, tongues blackened and shriveled from the noose around their throats. But I heard them anyway.



""Come back."" ""left us."" ""Fix it.""



Then one of them moved.

e rope, a wet, tearing  gurgling sound filling the air.



Everything became a blur, before i knew what i had done I ran.



The truck door slammed behind me, Dale fumbling with the keys, James breathing hard beside me. The engine roared to life, the tires kicking gravel as we sped away, the bridge shrinking in the distance.



But the voices never faded, becoming a constant hum.



By the time we reached town, Dale‚Äôs hands were shaking too much to hold his phone, and James had gone silent‚Äîjust staring at the road ahead, eyes wide, unblinking.



I sat in the back, gripping my knees, pulse hammering. Because even though we had left...I could still see them.



Now, they weren‚Äôt just at the bridge. They were everywhere.

A violent jerk, body convulsing against the rope.



The bridge never let us go. after that second visit, after we saw those...things, everything got worse. The air around us felt heavier, like we were dragging something unseen everywhere we went.



At first, I thought it was just me. The noises hadn‚Äôt stopped. It followed me home, curling beneath the sound of my breathing, hiding under the flicker of my bedroom light.



Then James called.



‚ÄúI saw it again,‚Äù he whispered. ‚ÄúThe bridge. But I wasn‚Äôt there. I was in my room, but when I blinked I-I was hanging from it.‚Äù Then Dale was next.



He slammed his palms against the hood of his truck one afternoon, shaking his head like he was trying to wake up. ‚ÄúI keep seeing them..Everywhere. In the mirror. Outside my window. In the backseat when I drive. They don‚Äôt move...but they‚Äôre watching.‚Äù



And me? I was drowning in it. The hallucinations weren‚Äôt just flickers anymore. They were vivid. Brutal.



I couldn‚Äôt tell if I was awake or dreaming, because every time I blinked, I saw them die, at times, seeing US die.



The first man‚Äîhe kicked. Struggled. His fingers clawed at the rope around his neck, body convulsing as blood pooled behind his eyes.



The second. Silent. Motionless. Accepting the fate she'd been given.



The third screamed, a raw, splintering sound that tore through my skull, his mouth twisted open as if the air had been ripped from his lungs.



And the rest, they watched me.



Even as they hung‚Äîthe stares burned into me. 



I gripped my desk, panting, choking on air, the classroom around me collapsing into static. Dale and James were looking at me.



They knew. Because now, they had seen it too.



The days after the second visit blurred into something fractured. None of us could hold onto reality the way we used to.



Yet I wasn‚Äôt alone anymore. Now, Dale and James heard them too.



The voices had spread like an infection, crawling into our lives, twisting in ways none of us could ignore. And the hallucinations were worse.



after me, James saw them after.



It was late, maybe two in the morning, when he called. His voice was hoarse, barely above a whisper.



‚ÄúThey‚Äôre here.‚Äù



I sat up, gripping my phone. ‚ÄúWhere?‚Äù



‚ÄúMy room.‚Äù His breath hitched. ‚ÄúHanging. From the ceiling.‚Äù



A hollow silence stretched between us. I tried to think, maybe he was just seeing it, just reliving the moment, but then, his voice cracked.



‚ÄúThey‚Äôre moving this time.‚Äù



I couldn‚Äôt respond. Because I knew James was right.



It wasn‚Äôt just frozen images anymore. They were changing. Shifting. Growing closer, i had seen them as well.



Then Dale had his turn.



I met up with him a few days later, standing outside his truck, the air thick with weed smoke and something wrong.



‚ÄúI can‚Äôt look in my mirrors anymore,‚Äù he muttered, staring past me, eyes red-rimmed and dry. ‚ÄúEvery time I do, I see one of them behind me.‚Äù



I swallowed hard. He dragged a hand through his hair. ‚ÄúI think it‚Äôs getting worse.‚Äù



And I knew he was right. Because now, they weren‚Äôt just hanging from the bridge.



They were hanging from us. 



The unraveling was slow, but inevitable, I should‚Äôve seen it coming.



One day sitting in Dale‚Äôs truck, parked behind the abandoned gas station on the edge of town. a regular hang out spot for us, James was jittery, legs bouncing, knuckles tight around a half-smoked cigarette. Dale was eerily still, staring ahead, barely blinking.



The silence between us felt wrong, uncomfortable, heavy, suffocating, buzzing with something we couldn‚Äôt name.



Then Dale twitched. A sharp inhale. Fingers curling into fists. His jaw locked.



‚ÄúDale?‚Äù I frowned, shifting toward him. ‚ÄúYou good?‚Äù



He didn‚Äôt answer. Instead, his head snapped toward James, eyes wide, wild, like he didn‚Äôt recognize him.



And then, he lunged.



James barely had time to react before Dale‚Äôs hands were around his throat, knocking him back against the passenger door.



‚ÄúDude!‚Äù I shouted, scrambling to pull him off.



James choked, gasping, nails digging into Dale‚Äôs arms, struggling to push him away, but Dale‚Äôs grip tightened.



His eyes weren‚Äôt normal, they were bloodshot, blown wide, like something else was looking through them.



And then he spoke. though it wasn‚Äôt his voice.



""You crossed the bridge."" ""You left us there."" ""Why did you leave?""



My stomach dropped.



I grabbed Dale, yanking him back with everything I had, forcing him against the seat, pinning his wrists.



James coughed violently, sucking in air, shaking all over.



Dale blinked fast‚Äîsomething snapped back into place. His face crumpled, realization hitting like a freight train.



‚ÄúOh my God,‚Äù he whispered. His whole body trembled, eyes darting between me and James. ‚ÄúI‚ÄîI didn‚Äôt mean to‚ÄîI don‚Äôt know what‚Äî‚Äù



James was still catching his breath, rubbing his throat. His expression wasn‚Äôt angry. It was terrified.



Dale‚Äôs hands trembled as he reached for James, stopping short. both were terrified.



‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know what happened,‚Äù he breathed. ‚ÄúI swear to God, I wasn‚Äôt‚ÄîI don‚Äôt even remember‚Äî‚Äù



None of us knew what to say. Because deep down, we knew the truth. It wasn‚Äôt Dale.



Not really.



The next week passed in a haze of frantic research and uneasy silence.



None of us wanted to talk about what happened in the truck. Dale afraid to ask for forgiveness, and would James even accept it? We moved carefully around each other, conversations clipped, tensions hanging in the air like fog.



But the whispers never stopped.



James buried himself in old news articles, digging through anything that mentioned Seven Devil‚Äôs Bridge. He found scraps, bits of folklore, missing persons reports, vague warnings dating back decades.



Dale spent nights glued to his laptop, scrolling through conspiracy forums, desperate for anything that felt familiar. And me? I was lost, just listened.



Slowly the voices were changing.



""You don‚Äôt belong."" ""you never left. ""Fix it.""



The more we searched, the worse it got as time passed, Reality slipped.



And then James woke up wrong.



I got a call at dawn, his voice shaking, not normal, not James.



‚ÄúI‚ÄîI don‚Äôt‚Äî‚Äù His breath came sharp, clipped, uneven. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs blood in my bed.‚Äù



I sat up fast, heart hammering, the fog of sleep washing away quickly. ‚ÄúWhat?‚Äù



‚ÄúI-I...don‚Äôt know where it came from.‚Äù His voice cracked. ‚ÄúI....don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs mine.‚Äù



Something cold settled in my stomach. ""Did he-no....no""



Dale and I rushed over.



James was waiting for us on his porch, skin pale, pupils blown wide like he hadn‚Äôt slept. He led us into his home, slowly, reluctant.

It dawned on me that he hadn't been inside since our call.



The sheets, soaked. Rust-colored, thick, too much blood for one person.



But James had no wounds, Nothing at all, Nothing on him. And the worst part?



When Dale pulled back the blankets, there were handprints.



Seven of them. Smudged into the fabric, fingers long, warped.



close but not human, i swear i saw claw marks, but couldn't be sure.



James sat on the floor, shaking, staring at his hands like they weren‚Äôt his. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt‚ÄîI don‚Äôt remember falling asleep.‚Äù



Dale swallowed hard. ‚Äúmaybe you didn‚Äôt?‚Äù



None of us had an answer, because now, it wasn‚Äôt just hallucinations anymore.



It was real, and we couldn't differentiate reality from fiction anymore, reality and ""fiction"" were melding together. 



Desperation led us back.



After a week of finding nothing, no explanations, no answers, just more paranoia, we had no choice.



We didn‚Äôt talk much on the drive. Dale gripped the wheel, white knuckled, pale faced. James sat rigid, hands tucked under his arms as if he was trying to keep them from shaking.



And me? I listened, lost in a haze of fear and confusion.



The humming had changed. It wasn‚Äôt just a whisper, slowly, it became like music. With Notes bent, broken, twisting through the air like a sound that had never been meant for human ears, yet still alluring.



By the time we arrived, the moon sat heavy in the sky, casting long, jagged shadows across the cracked pavement. The bridge loomed ahead, every shadow dancing in my mind.



None of us moved at first. Like we were waiting‚Äîfor permission.



Then James let out a breath. ‚ÄúWe go together.‚Äù Dale nodded stiffly.



I swallowed hard. ‚ÄúYeah.‚Äù



And we stepped forward. Back into whatever this was we had stubbled into, whatever had never really let us go.

It felt as though the bridge let us in before we had the chance to change our minds.



The moment our feet hit the wood, the air shifted‚Äîthicker, heavier, like space was compressing around us. Everything sounded wrong, felt...wrong.



James sucked in a breath. ‚ÄúDo you feel that?‚Äù



None of us answered. We all felt it. Then, reality bled away.



Dale was the first to break.



His eyes widened, breath coming in short bursts as he reached for the side of his head. ‚ÄúNo,‚Äù he whispered. ‚ÄúThey‚Äôre inside‚ÄîI can feel them, I can hear them!‚Äù



I turned toward him, stepping closer, but he screamed.



Not just a yell, a raw, primal shriek of terror.



‚ÄúGet away!‚Äù He stumbled back, eyes locked onto something that wasn‚Äôt there. His hands twitched like he was trying to claw something out of his own skin.



James grabbed him, voice sharp. ‚ÄúDale, it‚Äôs not real!‚Äù



But Dale wasn‚Äôt listening. Then James froze.



His face slackened, breath hitching as his gaze lifted toward the bridge, as if he saw something standing there, watching us.



His lips trembled. ""They're moving.""



And then was my turn.



The world fractured around me. The air bled. The bridge split open, spilling its rotted history out into the night.



And something crawled toward me. Not human. Not alive. A writhing puddle of limbs bent the wrong way, its mouth a gaping pit of blackened teeth, flies and maggots flowing out.



It lunged. I didn‚Äôt think, I couldn't, I just swung.



The force of the hit sent it sprawling. I didn‚Äôt stop, Terror, rage and delirium fueling me.



My fists landed, again, and again, crushing, tearing, breaking. It twitched beneath me, convulsed, cracked, final-



And then I blinked. The hallucination melted away.



And James lay beneath me.



Breathing ragged. Bleeding, Then he wasn't breathing at all. His body lay twisted, throat slack, eyes wide, yet unseeing.



Blood pooled beneath his cracked skull, soaking into the rotting wood. His chest didn‚Äôt rise, didn't fall, Didn‚Äôt move.



James was dead and it was my fault.



Dale was on his knees now, hands tangled in his hair, rocking slightly, whispering something, but his words I couldn‚Äôt be heard over the humming.



The bridge had taken James and we were still standing on it.



Dale moved before I could say anything.



One second, he was kneeling beside James‚Äôs body, face pale, hands shaking. The next, he was running.



Away from the bridge. Away from me.



‚ÄúNo‚ÄîDale, wait!‚Äù I scrambled to my feet, my pulse roaring in my ears. My hands were still wet with blood...James‚Äôs blood.



Dale didn't stop.



His breath came ragged, sharp, cutting through the silence like a blade as he ran toward the road. Toward the way out.



I didn't know what else to do, so i chased after him.



I could hear my own voice, raw, desperate. ‚ÄúDale, listen to me‚Äîplease! I didn‚Äôt mean to! I didn‚Äôt‚Äî‚Äù



He wasn‚Äôt listening. Then he slowed.



His footsteps faltered, his pace uneven, then he stopped completely.



I nearly crashed into him, gasping, grabbing his arm. ‚ÄúDale, we have to‚Äî‚Äù



Then I saw it. The bridge was still in front of us.



Even though we had been running the opposite way, even though we should‚Äôve left it [behind.it](http://behind.it) was still there.



Like we hadn‚Äôt moved at all.



Dale staggered back, shaking his head, his breath quick and shallow. ‚ÄúNo‚Äîno, this isn‚Äôt right. This isn‚Äôt‚Äî‚Äù



My stomach turned as i whipped around, looking back the way we‚Äôd come‚Äîbut it was the same.



Wooden planks stretching endlessly in both directions. No exit. No road.

 

Just the bridge and all around us, the humming grew louder.



Dale snapped.



The weight of everything, the hallucinations, the never ending bridge, James‚Äôs death, everything crashed into him at once.



He whirled around, his face twisted with rage and grief, his breath sharp, uneven.



‚ÄúYou killed him!‚Äù His voice was raw, cracking like something inside him had finally broken. ‚ÄúYou‚ÄîJames is dead because of you!‚Äù



My heart dropped, a truth i refused to accept.



‚ÄúI‚ÄîI thought I was fighting....something‚Äù My words came out frantic, desperate, but Dale wasn‚Äôt listening.



""You always thought you were fighting something!"" Dale's hands shook, his body tense with something more than fear. Hate. Betrayal. Terror. ""Maybe it's YOU that‚Äôs the problem! maybe this place wanted you, not us!""



I flinched. the words i had thought hurt so much more to hear aloud.



Dale was breathing fast now, eyes darting wildly, his voice tearing through the air like a knife.



‚ÄúYou think I can ever forget what I just saw?"" he hissed. ""You think I can just live with this?!‚Äù



I moved toward him, hands raised, pleading. ""Dale, please‚Äîwe have to get out of here, we have to‚Äî‚Äù



He shook his head violently, staggering backward, eyes glassy and frantic. ""There‚Äôs no way out!""



And then. we saw it. From the shadows of the bridge, something stirred.



A shape. A rotting, twisting thing, its limbs bent at unnatural angles, its flesh torn and leaking, bones jutting through in jagged, uneven splinters.



Its head tilted, too far, its mouth wrong. Breathing, Watching. Waiting.



But the humming, the damn endless, suffocating hum...was gone...



In its place, James‚Äôs voice.



""Come closer."" ""Don't left me."" ""You can‚Äôt leave too.""



A whisper. Soft, almost pleading, curling through the air around us, threading into our bones.



Dale froze, I couldn‚Äôt breathe, James was dead. we knew that. We saw it. i DID it.



But his voice didn‚Äôt care because now, it wanted us too.



Then the voices came all at once, an explosion of whispers, a chorus of the dead, words tangled and overlapping, crawling into our ears like rot.



""Dont leave us."" ""You belong here."" ""Come closer."" ""Make it right.""



Dale screamed.



He clutched his head, stumbling back, his breath ragged and sharp, his mind fracturing beneath the weight of voices that weren‚Äôt his.



‚ÄúShut up!‚Äù he gasped. ‚ÄúShut up!‚Äù



But they wouldn't stop.



I tried to reach for him, tried to pull him back, but something had already tswisted or snapped within him.



His movements turned jerky, erratic. His pupils blown wide, unfocused, lost.



And then, the glint of metal, A pocket knife.



Dale lunged.



I barely moved in time, the blade sliced the air, narrowly missing my throat.



""Dale!"" My voice cracked, frantic. ""Stop! It's me!""



But was it Dale anymore? i couldn't be sure.



His breathing hitched, hands trembling, eyes wild and not his own.



""Fix it.""



""You crossed the bridge.""



""Don't leave us.""



The voices pushed him forward.



I grabbed at his wrist, forcing it away, but he seemed stronger now. Or maybe something else was inside him.



The struggle blurred, violent, desperate.



Blood. My own? His? Both?



The knife twisted, slipped from his grip, clattered onto the wood.



Dale staggered back, chest heaving, eyes flickering between recognition and something else.



I didn‚Äôt move.



Because now, the bridge was waiting.



Blood pooled at our feet.



I didn‚Äôt know whose at first. mine? his? both? but I felt it, warm against my skin, soaking into the decayed wood beneath us.



Dale staggered back, his breath coming in jagged gasps, eyes flickering between horror and realization.



I clutched my side, fingers pressing against the sharp tear in my shirt, the sting beneath it. I‚Äôd been cut, fairly deep.



But Dale, Dale was worse.



A gash ran along his arm, deep, trembling, red spilling between his fingers as he tried to press against it.



We stared at each other, shaken, ruined, Then Dale‚Äôs face collapsed.



His breath came faster, sharp and uneven, like everything inside him was unraveling all at once.



‚ÄúI‚ÄîI did that,‚Äù he stammered, voice broken. He shook his head violently, like he could erase what had just happened. ‚ÄúI hurt you. I hurt‚Äî‚Äù



His gaze flickered toward James‚Äôs body. The blood. The twisted, motionless shape.



‚ÄúNo.‚Äù Dale‚Äôs voice cracked. His hands trembled. ‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt‚Äîthis wasn‚Äôt supposed to‚Äî‚Äù



I stepped forward, ignoring the sting in my side. ‚ÄúDale, listen to me, we have to figure this‚Äî‚Äù



‚ÄúHow am I supposed to figure this out?!‚Äù His voice rose, tight, unhinged. ‚ÄúJames is dead! I tried to kill you! I don‚Äôt‚Äî‚Äù



He cut himself off, his chest heaving, his hands gripping his own hair. His breath hitched.



And then, I saw the moment he decided.



The shift in his posture. The way his body stilled, false calmness in the moment.



‚ÄúI can‚Äôt do this anymore.‚Äù



""Dale‚Äî""



His hands moved too fast, the knife flashed‚Äî



And then his throat was open.



The sound that escaped his lips was small, broken, not meant for the world to hear.



I lurched forward, catching him as his body buckled, dragging him onto my lap, pressing my hands against the wound‚Äîbut it didn‚Äôt matter.



There was too much blood.



""Dale‚ÄîDale!"" My voice cracked, shook, choked on something that felt like glass in my throat.



His mouth moved, but the words didn‚Äôt come. His fingers twitched against mine, then went still.



The bridge watched.



The voices whispered.



And Dale, he was gone.

I felt the bridge breathe.



I was alone now, or maybe I never had been. Maybe I had always belonged here, just waiting for my turn.



James lay twisted where I left him.



Dale‚Äôs body was slack, broken, the knife still loosely in his fingers, his blood pooling in sick rivulets.



And me? I had nowhere left to run.



The moment Dale‚Äôs body went still, everything erupted. The whispers turned to screams.



James‚Äôs voice. Dale‚Äôs voice. A chorus of them. Layered, overlapping, raw, hateful. 



""You did this.""



""You killed me.""



""we‚Äôre still here.""



""You belong here.""



I clutched my head, pressing my palms against my temples, trying to drown them out, but no, it was inside me now.



They were inside me. Then the hallucinations ripped open.



James stood in front of me, neck twisted, his lips curled into something between a grin and a snarl.



His throat moved, but I saw the gash, the ruined flesh, the blood still dripping and spurting.



""I woke up in blood.""



Dale trembled beside him, his hands wrapped around his own throat, gasping like he was still trying to breathe.



""You did this.""



I stumbled away. no, no, no, they were dead, they were dead, they were dead!



And then, the bridge changed.



The planks beneath me twisted, rotted, pulsed. The air shifted, thick with something I could feel crawling into my lungs.



Everything bent, distorted, splintered apart until there was only darkness.



And the sound of laughter.



Not mine. Not Dale‚Äôs. Not James‚Äôs.



Something else. Something that had been waiting all along.



The bridge had taken everything.



James. Dale. Reality itself. I had nothing left, except the truth it was forcing me to see.



The voices didn‚Äôt stop. They slithered around me, wrapping into my thoughts, twisting into something that felt more real than my own skin.



""You never left.""



""You belong here.""



""This is where you stay.""



But then...blackness.



Everything tore away, I woke up somewhere else.



Cold metal beneath me. Bright lights overhead.



For a moment, I thought I was dead. that the bridge had finally finished what it started.



God no! the voices...wait



Real voices? Not whispers.



‚Äú‚Ä¶Found him wandering. Covered in blood-most of it wasn‚Äôt his.‚Äù



‚Äú‚Ä¶Two confirmed deaths. Dale and James. Killed on the bridge. But the way we found them‚Äî‚Äù



‚Äú‚Ä¶Rambling. Hallucinating. Won‚Äôt stop talking about the bridge.‚Äù



I realized a pressure around my wrists. Restrained. I twisted, blinking fast. White walls. Clinical air.



Not the bridge, but I was still trapped.



Weeks passed. Month perhaps? I didn't know because none of it was mine anymore.



The cops labeled it murder. The psychiatric evaluations labeled it delusion.



They didn‚Äôt believe me. Hell, They couldn‚Äôt believe me.



And now, I sit in a windowless room, retelling my story one last time.



My voice hollow, Distant, and at the end, when I had nothing left to say. I exhaled slowly.



Then, I reached for the only thing I had left.



A sharpened edge. One last choice. Before the bridge could take me back.



Am I crazy? Or was the bridge real? either way i still hear the distant, alluring hum, inviting me home.

I'll take any ideas at this point. Bear with me as I try to be as comprehensive as possible: I'm late 30sf and 215 lbs, gaining an average of 2 lbs a week the last month from a previous stable weight of 200 which was still higher for me, but my average weight since the pandemic and having a kid. The extra weight was gained over 6 months of taking Zoloft. I was 200 lbs for over a year until a surgery in mid March after which I couldn't do cardio or yoga for 8 weeks. I'm also about a month out from tapering completely off of Zoloft which I feel influenced my weight gain. I started Metformin last weekend and GAINED 2 pounds since. What the hell?!

I don't binge eat or struggle with junk. I love water and raw veggies even without sauce or dressing. I'm not an athlete, but I run 15+ miles a week. I've actually never been so fit and have beat my 10 year distance PR 5 times in the last 3 weeks. I also take my kid to the playground every day weather permitting and have to shadow her constantly because she's insane, so I'm basically always running around. I also do PT-prescribed stretches and yoga to keep myself flexible. The only thing I don't do is weight train, but I'm also constantly toting around my 30+lb kid. I *feel* great physically after dealing with POTS symptoms triggered by COVID last year. The year before that, I had mono so bad my hair hurt and my lab values were off the charts. It's nice to not be weak or have the room spin when I stand. I'm just heavy.

I cut out candy and snacks because my only vice is sweets. I seldom drink my calories and NEVER have sweetened soda or sweet tea-- if I get a rare craving, I get a single diet coke out. Once a week I get a pastry or cookie under 400 calories from Panera and that's what makes life livable for me. I drink alcohol maybe 1x a month and not to excess, typically only white wine. I take my coffee with unsweetened plant milk and Splenda. I have two medium coffees a day but seldom finish them because I have a kid and school and errands every day.

I submit an honest food log to my doctor a year ago when I had stomach issues and was embarrassed, but he said I ate better than any of his other patients... while diagnosing me with stress related anorexia nervosa. This mystified me because my weight had been stable and I lost all my postpartum weight within a year of giving birth. I asked what that was about and he said to try to eat more regularly(honestly I'd forget to eat until late afternoon every day), which I have been for months now. I've been taking care of myself eating a lot of lean protein and fresh fruits and veggies and I don't want to fall back on forgetting to eat again. I''m feeling desperate.  I had a lab panel including cortisol just last month and my sugars are great, cortisol fine, all labs textbook perfect as a whole. My doctor doesn't have any more ideas for me and said my habits are healthier than his even though I've seen him at the gymü´†

I can't physically eat too much fat and never have been able to because it makes me sick, so that's not it either. I enjoy whole grain carbs in moderation like oatmeal, rice. My main snack is fresh rotating seasonal fruit and occasionally turkey jerky, I don't snack on crackers etc. My main protein is grilled chicken followed by beans/legumes and occasionally red meat or fish. I don't eat a lot of fast/convenience food. I'm not perfect for sure, but I just don't know what else to cut out or down. I have between 1500-2000 calories a day which is well within my TDEE allotment without starving myself.

I'm most comfortable at 175 so that's where I'd like to be and what I think is completely reasonable. I'm just at a complete loss here. l AM under an immense amount of stress with academia and family issues but as I mentioned, my cortisol is supposedly fine. Because of my exercise, I have a decent regular sleeping schedule occasionally thwarted by having a toddler. I don't smoke anything(yet when I did use medical mj I was thinner!). I don't know what else I can do or cut out that's healthy and within reason, but I'm getting married soon and it's driving me nuts that all my hard work is only causing me to gain weight üò≠ My future husband says we're just getting old and I can't reschedule the wedding because I feel fat, so I appreciate any and all tips, pointers, suggestions for questions for my doctor, etc!",1,1752860640.0,loseit,0,1.0,False

My first thought is that she brought home bed bugs from somewhere but after some research the other signs (like blood on bedding and bites on body) aren't there.  Plus the amount of  powder that shows up overnight leads me to believe it's something else. 
I washed her bedding and pillow case. Next night, same thing. 
I thought maybe it's from the overhead AC vent, deteriorating fabric from her chair.. but her vent is closed and the chair is only a few months old. 
It looks as if someone sprinkled fine coffee grounds over her head as she slept. 
If you move the pillow theres an outline, an edge that looks like it was dropped down. She does have a fan but I checked it's filters and they're clean. 
Tonight I plan on turning off the fan to see if there's a difference. I also asked her to sleep opposite, head and feet switched to see if she wakes up with the powder in the same spot.

My first thought is that she brought home bed bugs from somewhere but after some research the other signs (like blood on bedding and bites on body) aren't there.  Plus the amount of  powder that shows up overnight leads me to believe it's something else. 
I washed her bedding and pillow case. Next night, same thing. 
I thought maybe it's from the overhead AC vent, deteriorating fabric from her chair.. but her vent is closed and the chair is only a few months old. 
It looks as if someone sprinkled fine coffee grounds over her head as she slept. 
If you move the pillow theres an outline, an edge that looks like it was dropped down. She does have a fan but I checked it's filters and they're clean. 
Tonight I plan on turning off the fan to see if there's a difference. I also asked her to sleep opposite, head and feet switched to see if she wakes up with the powder in the same spot. 
I'm completely stumped. Any insight would be appreciated. Adding pics. ",5,1752860531.0,strange,12,1.0,False
1m38u2o,https://www.reddit.com/r/widowers/comments/1m38u2o/do_you_wish_someone_gave_you_a_grief_basket/,Do you wish someone gave you a Grief Basket?,"Do you recall when the friendly ""Welcome Wagon"" ladies used to greet a new family in the community years past? They brought a basket full of helpful information to get you started in learning about your community, available services, a gift or two, and shared coffee with you in the comfort of your home. Life seemed much simpler and safer back then. Neighbor helping neighbor. They no longer do home visits, but the organization is still in business doing mailings and the Internet nowadays.

So what about a ""Grief Basket""? It's sometimes referred to as a comfort, sympathy or bereavement basket. Many florist's and others sell them. It is meant as a way to show someone cares, offering condolences when there's a death in the family. 

When someone enters widowhood, those very early days when you are in the turmoil center of the tornado, anxiety is over the top. Eating, sleeping, hydrating, just trying to wrap your mind around everything, you are barely functioning. I experienced it all as most of us have.

Inspired by how Welcome Wagon was, I decided a few months ago, I'd make up a useful basket of simple, easy microwaveable, no can opener needed, foods, snacks/munchies, a few drinks, a card, simple toiletries, and randomly gave them out to a funeral home or to a grief group for someone entering widowhood. A simple act of kindness, anonymously, letting the recipient know someone cared. Granted, it may only hold one over for a few days, but it's the thought, time and effort put into it for the receiver in their time of need.

Everywhere I go, I make the suggestion, we as a society need to do more to help those in widowhood. Mainly because only those of us who have been through it, get it, but as a way to get people educated, because there's more to life than play and self centered oneself. 

I just learned yesterday, a Church run food pantry is going to start doing some kind of grief basket after appreciating my bringing the suggestion to light. I'm hoping others will follow, in time. 

On the other hand, I was invited recently to a retired newly widowed Minister run, small grief group, I was informed was just for widows. Nope, they wanted to incorporate every grieving person. First red flag feeling duped. I was criticized for even making the suggestion about a grief basket and taking up their time by just sharing about me and what I've done. I was shocked and quickly realized this group was one way structured and wasn't about comradery in support or sharing, but rather more like a one-sided Bible study, or books only, of sorts, if you will. I was more than offended to say the least. Never to return. Exit stage right. Some people just want to stroke their ego, and play, ""follow the leader."" 

No matter. I know my heart condition and will continue moving forward. It's just another of life's lessons I'm learning. Some folks just live a double life, but they know how to talk the talk, walk the walk. If I ever get into a situation like this again, hopefully never, I'll just be a silent, invisible bystander, then exit.

1m38ty4,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/1m38ty4/my_autistic_nephew_wanted_to_tell_the_world_why/,My autistic nephew wanted to tell the world why he will be buying Bitcoin till he‚Äôs old. (His words),"Good afternoon, everyone,

Today, I want to share with you a financial strategy I‚Äôm excited about: investing ‚Ç¨10 in Bitcoin every single week. You might wonder why I‚Äôd choose to put a small, consistent amount into something as volatile as Bitcoin. Let me walk you through my reasoning, based on the research I‚Äôve done, and explain why I believe this is a smart move for my financial future.

### My Journey into Bitcoin‚Äôs Growth
Bitcoin‚Äôs story is nothing short of remarkable. Back in 2010, one Bitcoin was worth just $0.30. By the end of 2024, it had soared to $103,332.30, and on January 1, 2025, it was valued at $98,000. That‚Äôs an incredible journey for a digital currency that started as an experiment! What draws me to Bitcoin is its unique design: a decentralized system, a fixed supply of 21 million coins, and its growing acceptance as both a store of value and a medium of exchange.

When I looked at Bitcoin‚Äôs historical data from 2010 to 2024, I calculated an average annual growth rate, or Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR), of about 147.7% over 14 years, from $0.30 in 2011 to $98,000 in 2025. That means a tiny investment back then would have grown exponentially. But I‚Äôm realistic‚ÄîI know those astronomical growth rates won‚Äôt last forever. As Bitcoin matures, its percentage growth is slowing down, a phenomenon called diminishing returns. That‚Äôs why I‚Äôve taken a closer look at how Bitcoin‚Äôs growth is likely to evolve and how I can still benefit.

### Accounting for Diminishing Returns
To make a more realistic projection, I moved away from assuming constant exponential growth. Instead, I used a power-law model to capture Bitcoin‚Äôs historical price trends. After analyzing the data, I found that Bitcoin‚Äôs price can be approximated by the formula **P(t) = 0.221 * t^4.681**, where **t** is the number of years since 2010. This model shows that while Bitcoin‚Äôs price keeps rising, the annual percentage growth decreases over time‚Äîfor example, from 31.2% in 2024 to about 12.6% by 2046. This makes sense: as Bitcoin‚Äôs market cap grows and adoption stabilizes, the wild percentage jumps of the early days give way to steadier, but still significant, growth.

This model gives me confidence that Bitcoin remains a promising investment, even if it won‚Äôt repeat the thousand-fold gains of its infancy. The absolute price increases are still substantial, which is why I‚Äôm excited about getting in now.

### My Investment Plan
Here‚Äôs my plan: starting on January 30, 2026, when I‚Äôm 30 years old, I‚Äôll invest ‚Ç¨10‚Äîor $11.65, based on an exchange rate of 1.165 USD/EUR‚Äîevery week in Bitcoin. I‚Äôll keep this up for 20 years, until January 30, 2046, when I turn 50. That‚Äôs 1,040 weeks, or a total investment of ‚Ç¨10,400. Using my power-law model, I estimate Bitcoin‚Äôs price in 2026 will be around $242,746. By 2046, it could reach approximately $4.84 million per Bitcoin.

Each week, I‚Äôll buy a small fraction of Bitcoin at the prevailing price. Over 20 years, I calculate I‚Äôll accumulate about 0.0209 Bitcoin. By 2046, that would be worth around $101,100, or roughly ‚Ç¨86,780 at the same exchange rate. That‚Äôs nearly nine times my total investment! Compare that to a savings account or even many stock investments, and it‚Äôs clear why I‚Äôm so enthusiastic about this strategy.

### Why I Think This Is a Great Idea
So, why am I committing to this weekly ‚Ç¨10 investment in Bitcoin? Here are my reasons:

1. **Minimizing Risk with Dollar-Cost Averaging**: By investing a fixed amount each week, I‚Äôm using a strategy called dollar-cost averaging. This means I buy Bitcoin whether the price is high or low, reducing the risk of bad timing. Even with Bitcoin‚Äôs volatility, this approach smooths out my average purchase price over time.

2. **Affordability**: ‚Ç¨10 a week is manageable for me. It‚Äôs like skipping a couple of coffees or a takeout meal. I don‚Äôt need a huge upfront sum to get started, which makes Bitcoin accessible and practical.

3. **Long-Term Growth Potential**: Even with diminishing returns, my model suggests Bitcoin‚Äôs price will continue to climb significantly over the next two decades. The power-law projection shows it could reach millions of dollars per coin, driven by its scarcity and growing global adoption.

4. **Hedge Against Inflation**: In a world where traditional currencies often lose value due to inflation, Bitcoin is often called ‚Äúdigital gold.‚Äù I see it as a way to protect my wealth over the long term, especially as central banks continue printing money.

### Acknowledging the Risks
I‚Äôm not naive‚ÄîBitcoin isn‚Äôt a sure bet. Its price has seen massive drops, like the 80.5% crash from 2017 to 2018. Regulatory changes, technological disruptions, or competition from other cryptocurrencies could impact its future. My calculations also assume a constant USD/EUR exchange rate, which might not hold true. That‚Äôs why I‚Äôm only investing what I can afford to lose and keeping my portfolio diversified. But the potential upside, even with moderated growth, makes this a risk I‚Äôm willing to take.

### My Conclusion
I believe that investing ‚Ç¨10 in Bitcoin every week is a smart, accessible, and potentially transformative financial decision. My research shows that a modest ‚Ç¨10,400 investment could grow to nearly ‚Ç¨87,000 by 2046, even accounting for Bitcoin‚Äôs diminishing returns. That‚Äôs the power of consistent, long-term investing in an asset with a unique value proposition. I‚Äôm excited to be part of Bitcoin‚Äôs journey, and I encourage anyone looking for a way to build wealth over time to consider a similar approach. Let‚Äôs seize this opportunity and see where Bitcoin takes us in the years ahead!

Let me break down the main differences between glass, wood, and marble coffee tables to help you make the right choice.

Glass Coffee Tables:
These are perfect for small living rooms because they create an illusion of more space. They're also incredibly easy to clean ‚Äì just a quick wipe with glass cleaner and you're done. However, they show fingerprints easily and can be dangerous if you have small children running around. Plus, they tend to scratch over time.

Wood Coffee Tables:
I've found that wooden coffee tables are the most versatile option. They come in countless styles, from rustic farmhouse to sleek modern designs. They're durable, can be refinished if damaged, and generally age well. The downside? They can be susceptible to water rings and scratches if you're not careful.

If you're interested in browsing some beautiful wood coffee table options, I found a great selection here: https://explorehomedeals.com/coffee-tables

Marble Coffee Tables:
Marble tables are stunning and add instant luxury to any room. They're incredibly durable and heat-resistant, which means no coasters needed. However, they're heavy, expensive, and can stain if not properly sealed. They also require special cleaning products to maintain their appearance.

My Personal Take:
After trying all three materials, I settled on wood for my main living room and glass for my smaller home office. Wood offers the best balance of durability, style, and practicality. It's also more forgiving with daily use and can be restored if damaged.

Cost Considerations:
- Glass: Usually mid-range, $150-400
- Wood: Varies widely, $100-1000+
- Marble: Most expensive, typically $500+

Maintenance Tips:
1. Glass: Use microfiber cloths to avoid scratches
2. Wood: Apply furniture polish monthly
3. Marble: Seal annually and clean spills immediately

If you're ready to start shopping, I've found some great deals on all these materials here: https://explorehomedeals.com/coffee-tables

Remember to consider your lifestyle when choosing. If you have kids, wood might be your safest bet. If you're going for a modern look in a child-free home, glass or marble could work beautifully.

My recommendation? For most people, a solid wood coffee table offers the best combination of durability, style, and value. Just make sure to measure your space carefully and consider how you'll use the table daily before making your final decision.",1,1752860362.0,HomePicks,0,1.0,False

I'm a 31-year-old male working at a bank‚Äîthis is my only source of income‚Äîand I'm considering buying a condo. I'd appreciate your input, as I might be too emotionally invested in the idea of owning a place.

# About the condo:

1. The price is high‚Äîit‚Äôs equivalent to 10 years of my salary, assuming no other spending. It's a one-bedroom unit, around 40m¬≤.
2. Liquidity is strong. I've been following the market, and I'm confident in this.
3. I'd need to borrow 75% of the condo‚Äôs value.
4. Since I work at a bank, I can access a relatively low interest rate compared to the national average.
5. Based on my calculations, I‚Äôd be spending 60‚Äì65% of my monthly income on the mortgage.
6. The condo is close to my office, and given the insane traffic here, minimizing commuting is a huge plus.
7. Historically, the price has increased around 10‚Äì12% annually.
8. There's also a major highway about to open nearby, which is expected to further boost property values.

# About me:

1. I'm quite frugal. I don‚Äôt spend much on travel, a car, or fancy hobbies. My main interests are novels and films‚ÄîI'm a bit of a pirate in that regard. I cook, make coffee at home, and exercise using calisthenics instead of paying for a gym.
2. I don‚Äôt plan to get married or have kids.
3. I‚Äôm financially responsible for both myself and my parents in case of emergencies. I plan to save about 15% of the condo‚Äôs value as a safety net.
4. I'm currently living comfortably. While I don‚Äôt splurge, I do prefer high-quality food and coffee, and I treat myself once a month‚Äîeither by going out or flying home. On average, I spend about 30% of my monthly income, and nearly 100% of my monthly salary.
5. My salary isn‚Äôt equal to my total income. Like many in banking, I rely heavily on bonuses, which can be unpredictable. Last year my total income was on the low side, but in just the first 6 months of this year, I‚Äôve already earned 75% of last year‚Äôs total.
6. I invest, but I‚Äôve only seen mediocre returns‚Äîon par with savings accounts. With limited time and no insider access, I can‚Äôt consistently beat the market.
7. I‚Äôm also considering a personal project that I‚Äôd love to dedicate myself to full-time. I‚Äôve seriously thought about quitting to pursue it, but my responsibilities to my parents keep me grounded. Just wanted to mention that for context.

**In conclusion:**  
I think this condo could be my best investment and possibly my last chance to buy property. But I‚Äôm also aware that I might be overly fixated on the idea of owning a home. So, I‚Äôm reaching out for outside opinions‚Äîdo you think this is a smart move? Or am I letting emotion cloud my judgment?

Their tale of experiencing a skinwalker. My grandma taught school on the reservation and they lived well off compared to the natives living there. From what I know, there‚Äôs a lot of lore surrounding the Navajo Nation. Non-natives (primarily older generations) keeping their experiences and stories left unspoken, especially to those not from the culture.

Forgive me if I‚Äôm mistaken in any of this, the culture, ideology, practices, or any other part. I‚Äôm just trying to tell the story my family has only spoken to me in whispers about. My grandmother, father, and uncle lived there for a few years and their experience was much different than the Navajo people who have lived there for generations upon generations. I just want to tell their story and get insight as to anyone else who has lived in that community and any other stories some people might be willing to share.

My father and uncle are about 2 years apart in age. They lived in Navajo Mountain in the 1980s. My dad was 10-12 and my uncle younger. As it goes, they were always outside riding bikes with their friends, natives of the reservation. My grandma was recovering from an abusive relationship with their father and wasn‚Äôt too concerned with their whereabouts, being it was a small community. There wasn‚Äôt much trouble around, nor would they know what real trouble was at that age. Trouble wasn‚Äôt the issue to young white boys on a reservation then. Pure terror was.

It was a typical night without any parental supervision. The night was colder than usual, and the night sky was blacker than you could imagine. In such a desolate place, the stars in the sky would light the night. This night was as if the earth had moved to a different dimension, an abyss. The boys raced each other as they did every night, until they were compelled to force their brakes in unison. They simultaneously looked up, each boy‚Äôs face melted from carefree, innocent and adolescent to unadulterated horror.

The boys stood motionless, grasping their bikes with every nerve, muscle and strength in their body on the dirt road. To the right of them was a mesa, one they rode by every day. The mesa that paralleled from my family‚Äôs home. The mesa that they could see through my father and uncle‚Äôs bedroom every night. This mesa would become fear and nightmares to them from this night forward.

At the top of the mesa was a roaring fire. Taller than any bonfire that someone could assemble. Bigger than a group of people could assemble. It raged and was unbelievable, it was almost as tall as the mesa itself. More unbelievable was the pitch black figure seen cavorting around the bonfire. The native boys with my father and uncle informed them that this was not a typical Navajo dance or ritual. Pits began to form in their stomachs.

Friends of my father and uncle turned back around without a word and bolted back to their homes. My father and uncle threw their bikes to the ground and ran across the unpaved road into their home. The two came back in a panic, relaying what they‚Äôd seen to my grandmother, but she was unconcerned. A legend of the natives she told them, and shooed them away. They laid awake all night in their shared room. Not saying a word to one another. They forced their curtains as close as possible, too scared to look out the window and see what they shouldn‚Äôt have to begin with.

Neither could shake the images burnt into their memory, but the sun managed to rise and peaked through into their room. A sense of release washed over them as the darkness had faded. The boys left their beds and traveled to the kitchen to try a second time to tell my grandmother what they saw that night. They tried to get a handle on what they saw, but it was as if they couldn‚Äôt explain it. Again, my grandmother brushed them off. With a coffee and newspaper more important than their story, she told them to climb the mesa and investigate.

The boys wrangled the friends who shared the experience with the night prior as they passed on their bikes. The friends stayed on the dirt road, looking up at the mesa as my father and uncle climbed up to see any evidence of the hell-burning fire they witnessed together. The mesa wasn‚Äôt much taller than an average one story house, so the brothers took less than 2 minutes to climb to the top where the nightmare took place. When they got to the top they were hysterical and also relieved. There was no indication a bonfire of that enormity, or even a fire at all had taken place on the mesa they had clearly seen it the night earlier.

They climbed down and told the message to the friends who had also been a part of the shocking scene. Their native friends looked at them in shock, but neither said a word to them. They immediately turned their bikes around and proceeded home. It was never talked about again despite my father and brother asking about it. My grandmother and everyone else in the community refused to talk about it again.

My father is a skeptic. He does not believe in anything paranormal. Aliens, ghosts, mermaids, you name it. But whenever I ask about the skinwalker he saw, he turns pale and white. He gets quiet, jumpy and curt. I had to plead to get the full story out of him and I could see goosebumps and every hair standing up on his arms when he shared his experience.

My grandma took me to Navajo Mountain in 2019 to show me her history and to see how Navajo Natives still live on this reservation today. According to her, not much has changed since living there in the 80s.

I hiked and explored what I could of the reservation, as to not invade or violate any of the Navajo Reservation and its beauty. However, I did feel a change in mood when I visited. My existence felt heavy, as if I wasn‚Äôt supposed to be there or if I was invading on territory that wasn‚Äôt meant for me. Not caused by any of the community there, but just by my presence being on the land. I will never forget my experience visiting and all that I learned about reservation life. My intention is to hear any other stories from Navajo Mountain residents or talk with some people with similar stories in the Navajo reservation.

I climbed the mesa where the skinwalker my dad and uncle claimed had its ritual. I felt pretty normal until I got to the top and stood in the middle. I felt some darkness creep into me as I stood there. I‚Äôve never been the same since.",1,1752860203.0,creepcast,0,1.0,False

I slowly open my eyes, dreading yet another work day. With every passing day, my desire to climb out of bed wanes.  
I look around my room. It‚Äôs boring. There is no art on the wall, no colors, just white. Everything is white, sterile, quiet and indifferent.

As it does every morning, my body feels heavy as I push myself out of bed. I stumble to the shower. I haven‚Äôt yet, and probably never will, get used to this water pressure. The water slaps my skin like needles. It always does. I‚Äôve stopped wondering if that‚Äôs normal. The least of my concerns, certainly.

I knew that was coming. I was hoping it wouldn‚Äôt. I was praying that my vague, alcohol-infused memories weren‚Äôt real.

‚ÄúYeah, about that. Listen, Marie, I was feeling super vulnerable last night. Obviously, we‚Äôre both lonely up here. I‚Äôm just sorry if I‚Äôve‚Äî‚Äù

‚ÄúSo, you regret it? Or you didn‚Äôt mean the things you said?‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat? No! It‚Äôs not that at all. Things are just so‚Ä¶ complicated right now.‚Äù  
Of course things are complicated. This isn‚Äôt a Facebook status update. But I just keep making it worse. Pull it together, Joseph.

‚ÄúLook, Joseph. We‚Äôre all confused. Let‚Äôs talk after work today? Do that for me, please?‚Äù

Marie walks away, but not without brushing her hand down my arm. Our fingers briefly want to interlock as she grazes them. I know I shouldn‚Äôt have, but I‚Äôve developed feelings for her.  
Is it possible to love two people at the same time?

I sit down at my desk and log in. My job is‚Äîno, *was*‚Äîas Mission Specialist Engineer. That title means less every day.  
After the event occurred, some six months ago, we‚Äôve all been scrambling to keep the station afloat. Given the circumstances, we‚Äôve had to deviate from the station‚Äôs original purpose, slowly converting it into a long-term, self-sufficient, life-sustaining abode. My focus, specifically, is food preservation and new food growth.

Getting my Soil and Crop Sciences Ph.D. at Texas A&M hadn‚Äôt fully prepared me for this. This is something that couldn‚Äôt be studied. Every day, we‚Äôre learning something new. Cross-breeding crops has allowed us to grow multiple food sources while consolidating what little space we have here.

As I type away, the power flickers. This is not unusual, of course. After some of the damage during the event, we‚Äôve had our solar panels reduced by half. We‚Äôre just lucky they all weren‚Äôt swept away.

A few hours pass. My eyes ache from staring at this screen. It‚Äôs hard to focus on my work with Marie permeating every thought. I feel guilty.

‚ÄúI need a break,‚Äù I whisper to myself.

It‚Äôs been weeks since I‚Äôve taken my break on the observatory deck ‚Äî a place I used to visit daily before the event. I‚Äôd grab my favorite book, a cup of tea, and spend the entirety of my break there. I‚Äôd pause for long moments at a time and just stare at the vast peacefulness outside the observatory deck window. Our station was lucky to have the largest one ever built.

But now, the observatory deck just serves as a reminder ‚Äî of what was lost.

Nonetheless, I grab my book and a cup of tea and make the walk to my favorite chair, thankful that it‚Äôs unoccupied.

I sit down and stare out. My eyes well up. They always do when I look.

No clouds.  
No blue.  
No movement.  
Just debris.  
Earth is gone.

Fragments drift like glass in the void.  
One massive piece still burns.

The blast haunts me every day. We‚Äôre making it work up here, though.  
Because we have to.

There are only a few hundred of us left. And it‚Äôs my job to help us grow more food ‚Äî before we start repopulating.

I miss my friends and family.  
I hope they felt no pain.

This was supposed to be a six-month contract. A job on the moon.

Now?  
Now it‚Äôs all we have left.",7,1752860073.0,shortscarystories,4,1.0,False

1m38jcu,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1m38jcu/my_family_has_a_rite_of_passage_where_we_drive/,"My family has a ""rite of passage"" where we drive down a specific highway. I just found my grandfather's journal, and now I know it's not a tradition, it's a curse.","The men in my family have a tradition. A rite of passage, my dad called it. When a boy becomes a man, he takes a journey in my grandfather‚Äôs car. A cross-country trip, alone, to ‚Äúconnect with the past.‚Äù My grandfather died before I was born, so for me, it was supposed to be a way to connect with the man I never knew. A way to understand my roots.

Now, I think it was a test. And I don‚Äôt know if I passed or failed.

The car itself is a relic. A 1968 Ford Falcon, a heavy beast of sea-foam green steel and chrome. The inside smells of old vinyl, stale pipe tobacco, and something else‚Ä¶ something faintly metallic and sad, like old blood. There‚Äôs no GPS, no Bluetooth, no screen of any kind. Just a rumbling engine, a steering wheel the size of a ship‚Äôs helm, and an old AM/FM radio with a single, crackling speaker in the dash.

I set off two weeks ago, with a worn paper map unfolded on the passenger seat beside me. The first few days were incredible. Just me, the open road, and the ghosts of old rock and roll on the radio. it was the time for me to go through ""the road"". Looking at the map, I saw it: a thin, red line designated a state highway that cut a perfectly straight, 200-mile slash through a vast, dark green patch of national forest.

The turn-off was unassuming, just a faded green sign pointing down a two-lane blacktop that was immediately swallowed by a canopy of ancient, towering pine trees. The air grew cooler. The sunlight dimmed, filtered through the dense needles overhead. Within ten minutes, I hadn‚Äôt seen another car. The road was a lonely, empty ribbon unfurling into the wilderness.

That‚Äôs when the radio started acting up.

At first, it was just static, the familiar hiss of a signal lost to distance and geography. But then, through the static, a voice crackled to life. It was a news anchor, his voice crisp and urgent, talking about naval blockades and tensions in Cuba. The broadcast lasted for about thirty seconds, then dissolved back into static. Weird. I twisted the dial, but all I got was more hissing. A few miles later, it happened again. A jingle, upbeat and cheerful, for a brand of soda I vaguely remembered my parents talking about, one that hadn't been on shelves since the 70s.

I dismissed it as atmospheric bounce. I‚Äôd heard of it happening in remote areas‚Äîradio waves from god know where, trapped in the ionosphere, sometimes bouncing back down in just the right conditions. It was a strange, atmospheric quirk. A cool story to tell later.

But the broadcasts kept coming. And they started to change. They became more intimate. I heard the hushed, whispered conversation of two young lovers, their words full of nervous excitement. I heard a mother humming a lullaby, a gentle, wordless tune full of so much love it made my chest ache. I heard a heated argument between two men, their voices sharp and angry, though I couldn't make out the words. They weren‚Äôt broadcasts anymore. They something else.

The feeling in the car shifted from curiosity to a low, humming unease. The road stretched on, empty and unchanging. Then, up ahead, I saw a building. It was an old, dilapidated diner, its sign faded and peeling, its windows boarded up. It looked like it had been abandoned for half a century. As I drove past, the radio erupted. It wasn't a voice this time. It was a cacophony of sound‚Äîthe clatter of cutlery on ceramic plates, the sizzle of a grill, the low murmur of conversation, and over it all, the clear, cheerful voice of a waitress asking, ""What'll it be, hun?"" It was so real, so vibrant, I could almost smell the greasy spoon coffee. It lasted for the ten seconds it took to pass the diner, and then it vanished, replaced by the familiar hiss of static.

My heart was pounding. That wasn‚Äôt some physical phenomena.

A few miles later, I passed a wide clearing with a single, massive, gnarled oak tree in the center. As the car drew level with it, the radio crackled again. This time, it was the sound of children laughing, pure, unadulterated joy. And underneath it, the steady, rhythmic creak‚Ä¶ creak‚Ä¶ creak of a tire swing. I looked at the tree. There was no swing. Just a thick, heavy branch, empty against the grey sky.

The realization hit me hard. The radio wasn‚Äôt picking up random signals from the sky. It was picking them up from the ground. From the road itself. It was playing back moments, memories, that had happened in the exact locations I was passing. This entire, desolate stretch of highway‚Ä¶ it was a recording. And this car, my grandfather's car, was the playback device.

A morbid curiosity, stronger than my fear, took hold. I started to experiment. I slowed the car to a crawl. I passed an old, collapsed barn, its roof caved in, its timbers rotting. The radio filled with the frantic, desperate voice of a man praying, begging for mercy as the sound of a roaring thunderstorm raged around him. The storm wasn't real. The sky above me was a flat, overcast grey. But in the car, I could almost feel the thunder shake my bones.

I stopped the car completely. The prayer faded. I put it in reverse, backed up ten feet. The prayer started again, mid-sentence. I was controlling it. I was scrubbing through the timeline of this place.

The initial wonder of it began to curdle into something much darker. The memories weren't all picnics and laughter. They couldn't be. Up ahead, the road curved sharply around a deep, rocky ravine. A rusty, mangled section of guardrail was the only sign of trouble. As I approached, a knot of ice formed in my stomach. I almost turned the radio off. I couldn't.

The static gave way to the screech of tires on wet pavement. It was a horrifying, high-pitched squeal of rubber losing its grip. It was followed by a single, sharp, female scream, a sound of pure, final terror, cut off abruptly by a sickening crunch of metal on rock.

And then, silence. A profound, heavy, listening silence that was worse than the scream itself.

I felt physically cold. The dread wasn't just in my head anymore; it was a physical sensation, seeping into me from the old vinyl of the seats, through the steering wheel into my hands. This wasn't just a recording. The emotions were real. The pain, the fear, the joy‚Ä¶ they were imprinted here.

I had to get out. Just for a minute. I pulled the car over onto the gravel shoulder, my hands shaking. I needed fresh air. I needed to escape the claustrophobic intimacy of these ghosts. I killed the engine, and the silence was a relief. I sat there for a long time, just breathing. My eyes scanned the simple, primitive dashboard. The glove compartment.

I don‚Äôt know why I opened it. Maybe I was just looking for a distraction. Inside, beneath a stack of old gas receipts and a tire pressure gauge, was a small, leather-bound journal. It was my grandfather‚Äôs. His name was embossed in faded gold on the cover.

With trembling fingers, I opened it. The pages were filled with his neat, looping handwriting. The first few entries were about the car, about his love for driving. Then, the entries started to be about this road.

October 12th, 1971
Started my rite of passage today. A state highway that cuts through the old forest. The map calls it Route 9, but it feels older than that. There‚Äôs a strange quality to the air here. The radio keeps picking up old signals. Like echoes. I must be coming back this way.

October 15th, 1971
It‚Äôs not echoes. It‚Äôs the road. I‚Äôve started calling it ‚ÄúThe Hollow.‚Äù It holds onto things. Voices. Moments. I passed the old Miller farm today and heard old man Miller yelling at his son, clear as day. Miller‚Äôs been dead twenty years. This road‚Ä¶ it remembers.

I flipped through the pages. The entries became more frequent, more obsessive. He was driving the road regularly, listening, cataloging the memories he found. He was as fascinated as I had been. But then, the tone of the final entries changed. The neat cursive became a frantic, almost illegible scrawl.

September 3rd, 1992
I was wrong. I was a fool. The road doesn‚Äôt just play back. It records. It takes. I was out here last week, after a terrible fight with my wife. I was so angry, so full of rage. Today, I drove past the same spot. And I heard it. I heard myself. I heard my own words, my own anger, echoing back at me from the static. It took a piece of me. It recorded my pain and now it plays it back. Any strong emotion, any peak of human experience‚Ä¶ it gets imprinted. It feeds the Hollow.

The last entry was written on a page that was tear-stained and smudged.

September 5th, 1992
It‚Äôs our blood. It has to be. I found the old county records. The ones they keep in the church basement. This land wasn't empty. Before it was a forest, before it was a road, it belonged to a tribe. Our ancestors, when they first settled this valley, they‚Ä¶ they cleared them out. That was the phrase in the old letters. ‚ÄúCleared them out.‚Äù It wasn‚Äôt a treaty. It wasn‚Äôt a sale. It was a slaughter. A genocide. We built our lives on their graves. And this road cuts right through the heart of their burial ground.

It‚Äôs not just playing back memories. It‚Äôs playing back their suffering. An endless loop of their final agony. And it‚Äôs a curse. For us. For our bloodline. The car, this damn car, it‚Äôs an amplifier. It attunes us to their pain. This rite of passage‚Ä¶ it isn‚Äôt about connecting with us. It‚Äôs about binding us to them. To their suffering. The road demands a witness from the bloodline of the usurpers. It demands we listen.

I dropped the journal. My blood had turned to ice. The rite of passage. The connection to the past. It was all a lie. A beautiful, romantic story to cover up a horrifying, ugly truth.

I looked up, into the rearview mirror. The road behind me seemed to shimmer, the image of the forest wavering like a heat haze. The car, which had been running perfectly, suddenly sputtered. Coughed. The engine died.

The radio crackled to life. But it wasn't a memory this time. It was a low, expectant hum. A waiting sound.

And in the mirror, I saw them.

Far behind me, where the road met the horizon, figures began to appear. Dozens of them. Then hundreds. They were on horseback, dark, wrathful silhouettes against the grey sky. They began to ride towards me, moving with an unnatural speed. They were screaming, a sound that came not through the radio, but through the very air, a chorus of rage and pain in a language I didn‚Äôt know but understood perfectly.

I looked to the sides of the road, to the forest I had thought was empty. It wasn‚Äôt empty anymore. Figures were stumbling out from between the trees. Women, children, old men. Their bodies were torn, mutilated. Their faces were masks of unending agony. And they were all looking at me. They weren‚Äôt just ghosts. They were accusations. They were raising their spectral, broken hands, pointing at me, their mouths open in silent screams that I could feel in my soul.

My own scream was a raw, terrified sound. I turned the key in the ignition, praying. The engine caught, roaring back to life. I stomped on the accelerator, and the old Falcon fishtailed on the gravel before finding purchase on the asphalt. I flew down that road, the army of spectral riders gaining on me in the rearview mirror, the suffering faces of the dead flashing past my windows.

The road ahead seemed to stretch into infinity. The car rattled and shook, pushed to its absolute limit. The humming from the radio grew louder, more intense, a sound that felt like it was trying to shake my skull apart. I saw a sign up ahead. A modern, reflective green sign for the interstate. The end of the Hollow.

I shot past it, crossing some invisible line.

And everything stopped.

The riders in my mirror vanished. The figures in the woods were gone. The humming from the radio cut out, replaced by a profound, deafening silence.

I kept driving for another mile before pulling over, my body shaking so violently I could barely control the car. I sat there, gasping for air, the silence a welcome blanket.

Then, the radio crackled one last time.

It was a voice. An old man‚Äôs voice, full of a weariness so deep it felt ancient. It was a voice I‚Äôd never heard, but I knew, with a certainty that chilled me to the bone, that it was my grandfather.

‚ÄúNow you know,‚Äù he whispered, his voice a ghost in the machine. ‚ÄúNow you carry it, too. The road remembers. The road always remembers. And one day, son, for one of us, for one of our blood‚Ä¶ it won‚Äôt be enough to just listen. One day, it will claim its payment.‚Äù

The radio went silent. And I was alone. But I know I‚Äôm not. I can still feel it. A cold spot in my soul. The rite of passage is complete. I‚Äôve connected with my ancestors. And I am now bound to their crime, a witness to their sin, just waiting for the day the road decides it‚Äôs my turn to become another one of its recordings.",13,1752859788.0,nosleep,0,1.0,False

I normally drink Altissio, Bianco Piccolo, Pistachio Vanilla. I always add milk to my coffee and consume it hot or cold. No sugar.

How do you like this coffee? Or any alternate recommendations? I haven't opened it yet so maybe can return and buy a different one.

I just found my grandfather's journal, and now I know it's not a tradition, it's a curse.","The men in my family have a tradition. A rite of passage, my dad called it. When a boy becomes a man, he takes a journey in my grandfather‚Äôs car. A cross-country trip, alone, to ‚Äúconnect with the past.‚Äù My grandfather died before I was born, so for me, it was supposed to be a way to connect with the man I never knew. A way to understand my roots.

Now, I think it was a test. And I don‚Äôt know if I passed or failed.

The car itself is a relic. A 1968 Ford Falcon, a heavy beast of sea-foam green steel and chrome. The inside smells of old vinyl, stale pipe tobacco, and something else‚Ä¶ something faintly metallic and sad, like old blood. There‚Äôs no GPS, no Bluetooth, no screen of any kind. Just a rumbling engine, a steering wheel the size of a ship‚Äôs helm, and an old AM/FM radio with a single, crackling speaker in the dash.

I set off two weeks ago, with a worn paper map unfolded on the passenger seat beside me. The first few days were incredible. Just me, the open road, and the ghosts of old rock and roll on the radio. it was the time for me to go through ""the road"". Looking at the map, I saw it: a thin, red line designated a state highway that cut a perfectly straight, 200-mile slash through a vast, dark green patch of national forest.

The turn-off was unassuming, just a faded green sign pointing down a two-lane blacktop that was immediately swallowed by a canopy of ancient, towering pine trees. The air grew cooler. The sunlight dimmed, filtered through the dense needles overhead. Within ten minutes, I hadn‚Äôt seen another car. The road was a lonely, empty ribbon unfurling into the wilderness.

That‚Äôs when the radio started acting up.

At first, it was just static, the familiar hiss of a signal lost to distance and geography. But then, through the static, a voice crackled to life. It was a news anchor, his voice crisp and urgent, talking about naval blockades and tensions in Cuba. The broadcast lasted for about thirty seconds, then dissolved back into static. Weird. I twisted the dial, but all I got was more hissing. A few miles later, it happened again. A jingle, upbeat and cheerful, for a brand of soda I vaguely remembered my parents talking about, one that hadn't been on shelves since the 70s.

I dismissed it as atmospheric bounce. I‚Äôd heard of it happening in remote areas‚Äîradio waves from god know where, trapped in the ionosphere, sometimes bouncing back down in just the right conditions. It was a strange, atmospheric quirk. A cool story to tell later.

But the broadcasts kept coming. And they started to change. They became more intimate. I heard the hushed, whispered conversation of two young lovers, their words full of nervous excitement. I heard a mother humming a lullaby, a gentle, wordless tune full of so much love it made my chest ache. I heard a heated argument between two men, their voices sharp and angry, though I couldn't make out the words. They weren‚Äôt broadcasts anymore. They something else.

The feeling in the car shifted from curiosity to a low, humming unease. The road stretched on, empty and unchanging. Then, up ahead, I saw a building. It was an old, dilapidated diner, its sign faded and peeling, its windows boarded up. It looked like it had been abandoned for half a century. As I drove past, the radio erupted. It wasn't a voice this time. It was a cacophony of sound‚Äîthe clatter of cutlery on ceramic plates, the sizzle of a grill, the low murmur of conversation, and over it all, the clear, cheerful voice of a waitress asking, ""What'll it be, hun?"" It was so real, so vibrant, I could almost smell the greasy spoon coffee. It lasted for the ten seconds it took to pass the diner, and then it vanished, replaced by the familiar hiss of static.

My heart was pounding. That wasn‚Äôt some physical phenomena.

A few miles later, I passed a wide clearing with a single, massive, gnarled oak tree in the center. As the car drew level with it, the radio crackled again. This time, it was the sound of children laughing, pure, unadulterated joy. And underneath it, the steady, rhythmic creak‚Ä¶ creak‚Ä¶ creak of a tire swing. I looked at the tree. There was no swing. Just a thick, heavy branch, empty against the grey sky.

The realization hit me hard. The radio wasn‚Äôt picking up random signals from the sky. It was picking them up from the ground. From the road itself. It was playing back moments, memories, that had happened in the exact locations I was passing. This entire, desolate stretch of highway‚Ä¶ it was a recording. And this car, my grandfather's car, was the playback device.

A morbid curiosity, stronger than my fear, took hold. I started to experiment. I slowed the car to a crawl. I passed an old, collapsed barn, its roof caved in, its timbers rotting. The radio filled with the frantic, desperate voice of a man praying, begging for mercy as the sound of a roaring thunderstorm raged around him. The storm wasn't real. The sky above me was a flat, overcast grey. But in the car, I could almost feel the thunder shake my bones.

I stopped the car completely. The prayer faded. I put it in reverse, backed up ten feet. The prayer started again, mid-sentence. I was controlling it. I was scrubbing through the timeline of this place.

The initial wonder of it began to curdle into something much darker. The memories weren't all picnics and laughter. They couldn't be. Up ahead, the road curved sharply around a deep, rocky ravine. A rusty, mangled section of guardrail was the only sign of trouble. As I approached, a knot of ice formed in my stomach. I almost turned the radio off. I couldn't.

The static gave way to the screech of tires on wet pavement. It was a horrifying, high-pitched squeal of rubber losing its grip. It was followed by a single, sharp, female scream, a sound of pure, final terror, cut off abruptly by a sickening crunch of metal on rock.

And then, silence. A profound, heavy, listening silence that was worse than the scream itself.

I felt physically cold. The dread wasn't just in my head anymore; it was a physical sensation, seeping into me from the old vinyl of the seats, through the steering wheel into my hands. This wasn't just a recording. The emotions were real. The pain, the fear, the joy‚Ä¶ they were imprinted here.

I had to get out. Just for a minute. I pulled the car over onto the gravel shoulder, my hands shaking. I needed fresh air. I needed to escape the claustrophobic intimacy of these ghosts. I killed the engine, and the silence was a relief. I sat there for a long time, just breathing. My eyes scanned the simple, primitive dashboard. The glove compartment.

I don‚Äôt know why I opened it. Maybe I was just looking for a distraction. Inside, beneath a stack of old gas receipts and a tire pressure gauge, was a small, leather-bound journal. It was my grandfather‚Äôs. His name was embossed in faded gold on the cover.

With trembling fingers, I opened it. The pages were filled with his neat, looping handwriting. The first few entries were about the car, about his love for driving. Then, the entries started to be about this road.

October 12th, 1971
Started my rite of passage today. A state highway that cuts through the old forest. The map calls it Route 9, but it feels older than that. There‚Äôs a strange quality to the air here. The radio keeps picking up old signals. Like echoes. I must be coming back this way.

October 15th, 1971
It‚Äôs not echoes. It‚Äôs the road. I‚Äôve started calling it ‚ÄúThe Hollow.‚Äù It holds onto things. Voices. Moments. I passed the old Miller farm today and heard old man Miller yelling at his son, clear as day. Miller‚Äôs been dead twenty years. This road‚Ä¶ it remembers.

I flipped through the pages. The entries became more frequent, more obsessive. He was driving the road regularly, listening, cataloging the memories he found. He was as fascinated as I had been. But then, the tone of the final entries changed. The neat cursive became a frantic, almost illegible scrawl.

September 3rd, 1992
I was wrong. I was a fool. The road doesn‚Äôt just play back. It records. It takes. I was out here last week, after a terrible fight with my wife. I was so angry, so full of rage. Today, I drove past the same spot. And I heard it. I heard myself. I heard my own words, my own anger, echoing back at me from the static. It took a piece of me. It recorded my pain and now it plays it back. Any strong emotion, any peak of human experience‚Ä¶ it gets imprinted. It feeds the Hollow.

The last entry was written on a page that was tear-stained and smudged.

September 5th, 1992
It‚Äôs our blood. It has to be. I found the old county records. The ones they keep in the church basement. This land wasn't empty. Before it was a forest, before it was a road, it belonged to a tribe. Our ancestors, when they first settled this valley, they‚Ä¶ they cleared them out. That was the phrase in the old letters. ‚ÄúCleared them out.‚Äù It wasn‚Äôt a treaty. It wasn‚Äôt a sale. It was a slaughter. A genocide. We built our lives on their graves. And this road cuts right through the heart of their burial ground.

It‚Äôs not just playing back memories. It‚Äôs playing back their suffering. An endless loop of their final agony. And it‚Äôs a curse. For us. For our bloodline. The car, this damn car, it‚Äôs an amplifier. It attunes us to their pain. This rite of passage‚Ä¶ it isn‚Äôt about connecting with us. It‚Äôs about binding us to them. To their suffering. The road demands a witness from the bloodline of the usurpers. It demands we listen.

I dropped the journal. My blood had turned to ice. The rite of passage. The connection to the past. It was all a lie. A beautiful, romantic story to cover up a horrifying, ugly truth.

I looked up, into the rearview mirror. The road behind me seemed to shimmer, the image of the forest wavering like a heat haze. The car, which had been running perfectly, suddenly sputtered. Coughed. The engine died.

The radio crackled to life. But it wasn't a memory this time. It was a low, expectant hum. A waiting sound.

And in the mirror, I saw them.

Far behind me, where the road met the horizon, figures began to appear. Dozens of them. Then hundreds. They were on horseback, dark, wrathful silhouettes against the grey sky. They began to ride towards me, moving with an unnatural speed. They were screaming, a sound that came not through the radio, but through the very air, a chorus of rage and pain in a language I didn‚Äôt know but understood perfectly.

I looked to the sides of the road, to the forest I had thought was empty. It wasn‚Äôt empty anymore. Figures were stumbling out from between the trees. Women, children, old men. Their bodies were torn, mutilated. Their faces were masks of unending agony. And they were all looking at me. They weren‚Äôt just ghosts. They were accusations. They were raising their spectral, broken hands, pointing at me, their mouths open in silent screams that I could feel in my soul.

My own scream was a raw, terrified sound. I turned the key in the ignition, praying. The engine caught, roaring back to life. I stomped on the accelerator, and the old Falcon fishtailed on the gravel before finding purchase on the asphalt. I flew down that road, the army of spectral riders gaining on me in the rearview mirror, the suffering faces of the dead flashing past my windows.

The road ahead seemed to stretch into infinity. The car rattled and shook, pushed to its absolute limit.

You can check your cognitive preference by seeing which of the following exercises‚Äîeach linked to one type of thinking‚Äîcomes more naturally to you.

Below are examples of some typical exercises that represent the two types of thinking

**The following exercises involve various types of reasoning‚Äîinductive, deductive, and others‚Äîwhich means there is Ti-related and Te-related logic in both of them**

Divergent Thinking Exercises

A. Pick an everyday object (e.g., book) and list more than 10 possible uses in 2 minutes.

B. ‚ÄúA stranger knocks at your door at midnight‚Ä¶‚Äù Task: Write three different story beginnings with wildly different genres (horror, comedy, sci‚Äëfi).

C.  Imagine a new gadget for travelers. Generate 15 feature ideas‚Äîno idea too silly.

D. ‚ÄúWhat if gravity were half as strong?‚Äù List 10 consequences in daily life, society, nature.

Convergent Thinking

A. For each set, find one word that forms a common phrase or compound with each cue.

Time: 1‚Äì2 minutes per set.

Set 1: ‚ÄúBlue‚Äù ‚Äì ‚ÄúSpherical‚Äù ‚Äì ‚ÄúHat‚Äù

Set 2: ‚ÄúBook‚Äù ‚Äì ‚ÄúChair‚Äù ‚Äì ‚ÄúTable‚Äù

B. In this room are four light switches. In the next room are four identical lamps‚Äîone lamp for each switch‚Äîbut you cannot see the lamps from here.

Determine exactly which switch controls which lamp.

You may manipulate the switches as you like, but you may enter the next room only once to examine the lamps. How can you use the switches‚Äîthen visit the lamp room just a single time‚Äîto unambiguously match each switch with its lamp?

C. Decide which single item doesn‚Äôt belong in each set‚Äîand explain why (only one valid rationale). Mercury‚ÄØ,‚ÄØVenus‚ÄØ,‚ÄØEarth‚ÄØ,‚ÄØMars,‚ÄØPluto

Rose‚ÄØ,‚ÄØTulip‚ÄØ,‚ÄØOak‚ÄØ,‚ÄØDaisy,‚ÄØLily

Circle‚ÄØ,‚ÄØTriangle‚ÄØ,‚ÄØSquare‚ÄØ,‚ÄØRectangle,‚ÄØLine

1‚ÄØminute per set. Look for the single defining rule that excludes one member.

D. Read the short passage below. From the four title options, choose the single best title that captures its main idea. You have 2 minutes‚Äîthen check which one you picked.

Every summer, the town‚Äôs historic fountain springs to life at dawn, when the first rays of sunlight ignite the water into a sparkling dance. Residents rise early to witness the display, gathering around its stone basin with coffee in hand. Local artisans sell handcrafted ceramics nearby, and children chase dancing droplets on the cobblestones. As the sun climbs, the fountain‚Äôs magic slows, and life in the square settles into the day‚Äôs usual rhythm.

Title Options

‚ÄúA Day in the Life of a Busy Town Square‚Äù

‚ÄúSunrise Spectacle: The Fountain‚Äôs Morning Performance‚Äù

‚ÄúHandcrafted Ceramics at the Local Market‚Äù

‚ÄúChildren‚Äôs Games on Cobblestone Streets‚Äù

**A. Divrgent Thinking: Variety ‚Äì Diffusion ‚Äì Analytical Exploration**  
**What you do:** You have many different interests and draw information from various areas of the external world.

**How you operate:** You compare different perspectives, notice details, and observe subtle differences and patterns.

**What you produce:** Accurate conclusions, specialized knowledge, a rich variety of thought.

**Strengths:** Breadth, ability to connect multiple ideas, awareness of diverse viewpoints.

**Potential drawbacks:** Difficulty integrating all this information into a coherent, deep system. Risk of fragmentation.

**B. Convergent Thinking: Focus ‚Äì Synthesis ‚Äì Holistic Perspective**  
**What you do:** You focus on a few very specific interests or phenomena.

**How you operate:** You immerse yourself in them, study them in depth, and try to see the ‚Äúwhole‚Äù that lies behind them.

**What you produce:** General theories, holistic patterns of thought, philosophical or theoretical synthesis.

**Strengths:** Depth, systematization, potential for grounding new theories.

**Potential drawbacks:** Risk of ignoring details or alternative perspectives. Possible abstraction



**Obviously, Divergent thinking is associated with Ne, while convergent thinking is associated with Ni.**",4,1752859582.0,mbti,3,1.0,False

I've been caught off guard lately by these small acts of kindness that have come my way. You know, the kinda stuff that just happens out of the blue and somehow makes your day. Like, the other morning, I was in line for coffee, and the person ahead of me paid for my drink. It wasn't a big deal in the grand scheme of things, but wow, did it make me smile.

It kinda got me thinking. There's so much chaos in the world and, tbh, it's easy to get lost in it. These little gestures, tho, they're like tiny reminders that goodness is still out there... even when it feels rare. I wanted to pass this feeling on to you, whoever you are. Maybe you're having a rough day or just need a reminder that people can be unexpectedly awesome.

Next time you feel up to it, maybe pay it forward? Even if it's something small. Who knows, it might just make someone else's day better, too.

Take care, Stranger. ü´∂",5,1752859568.0,LettersToStrangers,1,1.0,False

\---¬†

‚ÄúTada, breakfast.‚Äù¬†

There were many things wrong with this picture. First, it wasn‚Äôt morning. Second, it wasn‚Äôt breakfast. She eyed the vessel, where that frothy, sickly-colored grain juice swirled. It reeked faintly of bread, sort of, maybe something that was *exiled* from an oven too early. She raised a brow behind her wire-thin glasses.¬†¬†¬†

‚ÄúBeer for breakfast?‚Äù her voice came in that usual, stern manner, ‚Äú‚Ä¶what‚Äôs with the‚Ä¶ pottery project?‚Äù¬†

‚ÄúOh, this?‚Äù¬†¬†

Haber raised the ‚Ä¶ creatively shaped goblet made from terracotta, and the brew threatened to spill over. A thing ‚Äì so aptly put ‚Äì his hands formed in that company-mandated ‚Äòcreativity seminar‚Äô. It maybe didn‚Äôt scream *‚Äúteam synergy‚Äù* or *‚Äúemotional openness‚Äù*, but it could hold fluids and tolerate superglue just fine - those were all criteria that mattered to Haber anyhow. Kate stuck to her own cookie-cutter merchandising mug (fashioned after that terrible abomination Jim Davis created). He sipped from the liquid and sighed.¬†

‚ÄúBecause‚Ä¶‚Äù, he wiped his mouth, ‚Äú‚Ä¶our *B-50* is traced all the way from Sumer. So‚Ä¶ authentic pottery ‚Ä¶ is vital. You wouldn‚Äôt get it.‚Äù¬†

Her fingers tapped on the table, without clear rhythm. She sipped her joe, instead of their glorious *Barley-Strain-No.50*.¬†¬†

‚ÄúI get it, it‚Äôs just not funny. Besides, the only thing *Sumerian* here would be *your hygiene*.‚Äù¬†

*Ouch.* Haber bit into his lip hard enough to feel a bit of iron. He just couldn‚Äôt reward that jab with a smirk.¬†

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not supposed to be funny, but‚Ä¶ *meaningful*,‚Äù he muttered.¬†

‚ÄúVery meaningful, I can tell. Created the most powerful‚Ä¶ cereal and used it to make‚Ä¶‚Äù she gestured with the orange cat, trying to come up with some descriptor, ‚Äú‚Ä¶alcoholic porridge juice. *Poignant.*‚Äù¬†

He tilted his head, almost wounded. But there was something faint behind his auburn eyes, something that genuinely wanted her to understand what they had made. Or just to hear it acknowledged, to stroke his ego.¬†¬†

‚ÄúCome on, just a sip. You contributed, say, about half of it‚Ä¶ aren‚Äôt you even *a little* curious?‚Äù¬†¬†

‚ÄúNot really,‚Äù she quashed his hope with a slurp from the cat-mug. Haber leaned back, clutching his chalice in silence, like a deflated king. *Kepler-186's* lazy beams reached into the bridge. Amber and rose, creeping across the panels.¬†

M-type stars had that homey feeling. Like viewing a perpetual sunset, or the gentle licks of a campfire. That red-yellow allure. Haber could feel it in his bones, though it seemed *far older* than bones. Some sort of yearning, primordial and wordless.¬†¬†

The world they were navigating for was suspended in that red yearning. He could see it now, a smidgeon on their viewscreen, blue and turquoise against that backdrop. A planet parked just at the cusp of Kepler-186‚Äôs habitable zone, larger and bulkier than Earth ‚Äì but far away from that hustle and bustle of the Federation‚Äôs space. It was unremarkable at best, a mere navigation node for other navigation nodes. A little speck on the edge of the known.¬†¬†

*He liked this outpost, though.* Haber flew out to it more often than he was required to. *Technically* he was supposed to alternate with the others, but nobody really checked or cared.¬† Being on that world reminded him of childhood, as silly as that sounded. It gave him the feeling of hiding in those secluded spots in the parks of his hometown. Behind the maintenance sheds, beneath trees and under bushes, where there reigned neither dinnertime nor bedtime. Though he was shirking paperwork now, not his father. The same trick, nonetheless. A secluded spot in so much dark.¬†¬†

His eyes went from the spot, to the stars. They were *cold and dark.* So far, farther than imagining could ever do justice.¬†

‚ÄúY‚Äôever think it‚Äôs‚Ä¶ strange?‚Äù He murmured, sipping more alcoholic juice. It clung to his throat. She decoded his communication in a millisecond.¬†

‚ÄúAh. The *‚Äòwhere are the aliens‚Äô* whine, again. This is what, third round this trip?‚Äù¬†¬†

The thin pair of glasses sighed, but followed his gaze anyway, up and out into the viewfinder‚Äôs stretched expanse. The light caught in them, and it looked dull and smoky.¬†

‚ÄúHard to believe you‚Äôre still chasing shadows. Didn‚Äôt you get the memo when *SETI* went under?‚Äù¬†

She reached across the console, snagged a napkin, and dabbed at the spillage with the precise disgust of someone cleaning up vomit. She held up the blotchy tissue like Exhibit *A*.¬†¬†

‚ÄúThe likelihood of something like this-‚Äù¬†

‚Äú*-morphing into starfarers?* Yeah, yeah. ‚ÄòGreatly exaggerated.‚Äô‚Äù He mimicked her toneless voice, ‚ÄúBut why? Even your yeast cultures want to proliferate. Expand. *Consume‚Ä¶*‚Äù¬†

She remained silent. But Haber had long discerned that her silence was anything but dismissive in its nature. He‚Äôd come to respect that about her, over time. She always listened, even if she seemed like she didn‚Äôt. *Especially* then. It was sometimes frightening. She was used to making her own inscrutable notes, locked behind that stone-cold mask.¬†¬†

‚ÄúMy cultures don‚Äôt *want* anything. They have genes, they eat, they reproduce. They are how they are, and things go how they go.‚Äù She took a sip, that almost seemed‚Ä¶ *contemplative.* ‚ÄúThe stars are no different‚Ä¶‚Äù¬†

‚ÄúFederation seems to tow my line, though.‚Äù Haber shrugged.¬†

‚ÄúYes, because it justifies their *inflated* budgets. Keeps the plebs trembling, entertaining that there *might* be a rogue interstellar computer with a fetish for office supplies, or a galactic inquisitor with more tungsten rods than moral guidelines,‚Äù *-sip-* ‚Äúor a sentient nano-plague, or whatever *sweaty intranet writers* can come up with, on their *crumb-littered*, *dirty* keyboards that-‚Äú¬†

‚ÄúYeah, yeah, I get it,‚Äù Haber waved her off.¬†

She reached the same conclusions as he did, though put in her own way. Spelled out in prose as cynical as it was clean ‚Äì as opposed to Haber‚Äôs *feverish* visions. They had considered the same options, those grand, awe-inspiring and terrifying things Humanity had expected when carefully probing their toes into the great dark. And contemplated together, how their hands had grasped *naught but dust* when Humanity‚Äôs time came.¬†¬†

Though not for lack of trying. For hundreds of years now, colony ships have delved ever onwards, into the intergalactic gaps, bringing the flame of life into the farthest reaches. Like prophets into a barren, speechless desert. Though that speechless void was *far cruel* than any desert could have been.¬†¬†

And if that hadn‚Äôt been enough, Humanity‚Äôs probes had multiplied, and they were *dancing* on the rim of Sagittarius A\*, sensors peeled wide, ever restless. There were no wrecks, no ruins, nowhere. Never any hands to shake, enemies to challenge, allies to stand beside. *All that wasteful fear, all that useless hope,* Haber thought.¬†¬†

And what grand hope the stars had been. So much time, so much *fire*, raked up in their name. Warheads stockpiled and xenolinguists trained ‚Äì *for nothing*, he could see that now. His fingernail excavated tiny trenches in the leatherette. The vacuum was a groaning silence.¬†

‚ÄúIf I had to wager‚Ä¶‚Äù, she began just as their vessel shifted slightly, the navigational AI taking them in for final vectoring. Something about its steering seemed organic.¬†

‚Äú‚Ä¶whatever it is you‚Äôre looking for,‚Äù she continued, setting down her mug, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sure it‚Äôs gonna to be *far stranger* than we‚Äôd ever anticipate. Though I doubt you or I will have the privilege of knowing.‚Äù¬†

Her voice didn‚Äôt carry judgement, just the steady certainty of someone who had thought for a long, *long* time on something.¬†¬†

‚ÄúIn the meantime, I‚Äôll stick to my yeast. These cells are perfect the way they are. Maybe we‚Äôll find some friends for them somewhere, out there‚Ä¶ and not something cut from your *bombastic space-opera tripe‚Ä¶*‚Äù¬†¬†

Her words made him feel strange. He clutched his mug to shield himself from it.¬†

‚ÄúTypical *micro-supremacist‚Ä¶*‚Äù¬†¬†

‚ÄúThey always call you that, but they never call you *wrong‚Ä¶*‚Äù¬†¬†

She sipped her coffee. To mask a smirk, Haber was sure of it. He swirled his chair around to face the console. The display was a mess. Blinking lights, and scrawling texts amid the sea of stars. A tiny green blip swam in it ‚Äì their frigate. He watched the computer in space and the computer on soil perform their handshake. After they exchanged digital pleasantries, a green glyph flashed on the display. They were clear to approach. He rose to his feet, and left the mug to its own devices.¬†

‚ÄúNo funny message this time?‚Äù Kate looked over, sensing his resolve to depart.¬†

‚ÄúActually, no message at all,‚Äù he shrugged. ‚ÄúFigured they‚Äôd get bored eventually.‚Äù¬†

‚ÄúFine then. Didn‚Äôt travel all this way to chat anyway,‚Äù she buttoned her lab coat.¬†

The console recognized his identiband in passing, and began diverting fuel to what slept inside their hangar. *Okay,* he admitted to himself, \*maybe this was the other thing that made him visit the outpost this often‚Ä¶¬†\*

That little reservoir of sugars and cells kept foaming on the coaster for a long time after they had made for the hangar. And soon, the entire bridge would smell like bread and beer.¬†¬†

¬†

¬†

*The Valkyrie* detached from its umbilical, full of hydrogen and fury. She drifted free for a moment, weightless and suspended, until with the creak of hydraulics and a jolt, the stick in Haber‚Äôs hand became responsive. He would get written up if he didn‚Äôt follow the navigational AI *somewhat*, but there was enough fuel and room for *interpretation*. He couldn‚Äôt help it. His mouth curled into an unconscious grin.¬†¬†

Slipping into orbit below, 186f was now so vast and murky in their sights. Veiled with storms and primitive vegetation. Their Federation frigate, that charmful *brick*, retreated from view and its computer onboard bade them farewell on the screen, but Haber chose to ignore it.¬†¬†

‚ÄúCommencing deorbit‚Ä¶‚Äù Haber announced, and promptly disregarded the instructions on the screen. The flying wing turned and yawed according to every gesture of his fingers, not some glorified pathfinding algorithm. All *five thousand tons* were beholden to him ‚Äì not to something an intern coded while on break. And he could make the Valkyrie *sashay*. Thrusters burned in retrograde, and the whole mass transferred the inertia to his ribs like an overeager lover. He grunted as it pressed him into the seating. His vision tunneled.¬†

*More*, he demanded from the engine. And the *Valkyrie* obliged. She was made for it, after all. To drop from ships into planetary combat ‚Äì though carrying scientists, that was *his idea*. His little indulgence. To control something so much larger than yourself - it gave a *rush* like nothing else. That typical, annoyed pout of the woman next to him would be just the cherry on top. If he were any bit more sentimental this would be the time to put on *The Blue Danube*. She held tight onto the coffer on her lap, knuckles almost turning white.¬†

The green arrows guided him below, dipping into the heavy gravity of the world beneath them. The air across the cockpit began to glow subtly, but the Valkyrie laughed at it. There was no heat she could not bear. They dipped like an arrow, straight down and picking up speed with absurd tempo. Haber could sense the acceleration do a number on his poor heart. Crawling into his lungs and weighing heavily.¬†

*‚ÄúWHOOPWHOOP PULL-UP!¬† WHOOPWHOOP PULL-UP!‚Äù*

‚Äú*Shush*, you‚Ä¶‚Äù Haber hissed at the arrogant machine, that thought it knew better than him. Kate held onto the glasses that the acceleration wanted to get rid of.¬†¬†

‚ÄúWould you really risk a citation for our latest *failure*?‚Äù she remarked cool and cruel.¬†¬†¬†

Haber snorted, rolling the craft on its axis to accentuate his defiance, ‚Äú*Failure*? C‚Äômon Kate, this is our big break‚Ä¶‚Äù¬†¬†

‚Äú*B50* is gonna be a lot like *B49* I feel‚Ä¶‚Äù her fingers tapped the case.¬†

‚Äú*Nonsense*,‚Äù he grinned.¬†¬†

The green margins directed the Valkyrie‚Äôs flight. Just when Haber imagined his aim was to shoot proton torpedoes down some thermal exhaust port or something to keep him occupied, the cockpit *hiccupped* ‚Äì and the world went red.¬†¬†

\*SIGNATURE LOCK. DETECTION-DETECTION-DETECTION-¬†\*

He jostled the stick backwards in alarm from the shrill noise. Adrenaline made his vision narrow, while her eyes barely glanced up from the console.¬†

‚ÄúThe planetary defense battery is *pinging us*,‚Äù she remarked, calmly.¬†¬†

‚Äú*Wh-what?!*‚Äù Haber stammered. The Valkyrie seemed to *thrill* at the interruption, long-idle code booting up. Flare dispersion systems and evasion auto-maneuvers offered themselves to him, all surely in accordance with the fighter schooling Haber never had.¬†

‚ÄúNot sure yet. Let me check‚Ä¶‚Äù¬†¬†

Haber didn‚Äôt believe machines held spirits, but if they did, this Valkyrie‚Äôs machine-soul would probably be *ecstatic* to finally fly missions under the fire of atmospheric batteries - exactly what Haber didn‚Äôt want to do right now. He swirled the looping path around the outpost, *(hopefully)* out of range from any anti-anything installation.¬†

‚ÄúSelf-activation. *Automatic* lockdown, if I had to guess‚Ä¶‚Äù, she swiped across her pocket-sized display, ‚Äú‚Ä¶let me see if I can fix it‚Ä¶‚Äù¬†

‚ÄúYou think they‚Äôre having issues with their comms again? Power outage? *Pirates?*‚Äù, the last suggestion came with a raise of his brow. Pirates would have made for a fine story, but there wasn‚Äôt exactly much to loot from orchards and tilled fields. The Valkyrie rumbled, impatient.¬†

‚ÄúThey would have warned us about any pirate skiff. Maybe a *virus*. Though they have mechanical overrides‚Ä¶ they would have known to trigger those by now‚Ä¶‚Äù¬†

Haber tapped the screen. ‚ÄúSays here the response was *overdue*.‚Äù¬†¬†

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs like a few miles from central. They‚Äôre not stupid‚Ä¶‚Äù¬†¬†

They didn‚Äôt theorize any further. Haber dipped the stick, and the Valkyrie dove into the thick and heavy clouds. Rain whipped across the view, and in the distance, lightning flashed once in a while. 186f was in the midst of its monsoon season.¬†¬†

The black strip came into view, between that swampy earth. The computer aided his approach with those grating red *‚Äòvisual aids‚Äô* like a digital backseat driver. He could ignore those. The earth rushed left and right in his view, drawing closer with dreadful speed. His hand edged the thrust a little lower, lower. The turbines howled as they reversed thrust. His other hand yanked up the control stick, swirling it around as the whole craft gyrated on its vertical axis, heavy yet *elegant*. The howling engines reverberated, and he felt the sheer inertia grasp him sideways. The craft pivoted, then hovered, Haber setting it down gently. Right inside the marked out square at the end of the tarmac. He finally let out that sucked in air he didn‚Äôt realize he held. His fingers unclenched from the stick, trembling slightly with leftover adrenaline.¬†

*‚ÄúShowoff‚Ä¶""*

She was already standing outside by the time he finished setting it in park. Just at the edge of where the black flying wing ended and rain began. Underneath the still steaming nacelle, where tiny columns hissed upwards. The rain poncho was little more than a pyramid of cellophane on her head, and it did little to keep her short black hair dry. Her glasses fogged, then cleared, then fogged again. Haber wasn‚Äôt sure if she always wore the same lab coat or had multiple identical ones like some *psychopath*. Either way, she was about to cuss him out because he was staring again.¬†¬†¬†

‚ÄúAny going *theories*,‚Äù she inquired flatly, ‚Äú‚Ä¶on why they let their defense battery time out?‚Äù¬†¬†

He shrugged, climbing up into the transport - an old, misused troop carrier, tarp barely holding its own against the wind.¬†

¬†

‚ÄúMaybe an outbreak. Wouldn‚Äôt be unusual for a colony this small to up and *evacuate* for medical.‚Äù¬†

Kate raised an eyebrow. ‚ÄúProtocol is to shelter in place.‚Äù¬†

Haber adjusted the seat, fiddling with the little lever. ‚ÄúYeah, and we‚Äôre *so religious* about protocol.‚Äù¬†

She gave him that look again. The one she used instead of a middle finger. *Fair point.*

He retrieved the key taped to the dashboard and turned the ignition. The real, *authentic* diesel engine humming to life with a choked roar. It rattled the whole frame with its power. Fascinating piece of engineering. Antiquated, about as efficient as a Carnot heat engine would get (not very), and horribly dirty, but there was some aspect to it that appealed to Haber. Maybe it was those earlier things, the blatant *honesty* of it. The engine howled as they traversed mud and water towards the horizon.¬†

She held the silver suitcase close to her and clung onto the passenger‚Äôs seat (she couldn‚Äôt drive stick, after all). The carrier tumbled over bumps in the drenched earth and shook the precious cargo in her arms. A neat little coffer, carrying a neat little grain. The likes that *maybe-hopefully-certainly* will be ubiquitous to the arsenal of any starry-eyed pioneer wishing to turn lifeless rock into rich, good earth. He was still slightly incensed that its given name never stuck. It would always be the *G.E.C.K.* to him‚Ä¶¬†

The road blurred into brown streaks, and gray rain fell. The engine growled and kept fighting on, steady as she went. Haber‚Äôs thoughts were far from the wheel, though.¬†¬†

It was a *dizzying* design. Haber, when zooted off three or four caffeine bars and chewing the edge of his pencil, could almost feel his sanity slip when thinking about the splendor that box held. That he called it *B50* was such a disrespect to it - it was as much *barley* as the *Portuguese Man-o-war* was a *jellyfish*. This was not another grain ‚Äì this was the grain to end *all* grains. It was a carefully calibrated micro-ecosystem, that started way beneath the regolith. The ground there harbored more complexity than any deep-space refinery ever could. Sheltering vast populations of bacteria and fungi ‚Äì forming into Mycorrhizal filaments that bored into the rock, grinding out minerals and trapped water for the world above. It created its own microclimate, leaking volatile ethers and alcohols from the heavy ears that retained water, warded off frost, and promoted further erosion. Turning *rock* into *earth*. He could see them now, those tall stalks of ochre-gold, swaying in the gentle wind, the grain glistening and fat under its own weight. It grew from stone and turned air to sweetness. You could smell it, if you got close. It was *magic*.¬†

There were children born on barren worlds, now, somewhere among the ether. That never saw Earth and *never would*. That were *shackled* to their habitats, staring out at air that killed and wastes that stretched on lifelessly. Who could not tell fresh breath from recycled and didn‚Äôt know the scent of rain. But not forever. Soon, *oh soon*, it would be different. When it‚Äôll be their time to learn to run, they won‚Äôt kick up *rocks* \- they will kick up *dirt*. Dirt that will smell like old Terra without ever having touched it. Dirt that will hide beetles and worms. They‚Äôll kneel down and pick through it with bare fingers, giggling when something wriggles away, and look up to see a garden of a universe. A sky without edges. They will think it *always* was this way. They‚Äôll see that life‚Äôs purpose is to bloom naturally, everywhere. That worlds were meant to be lived on. That the universe was kind, giving, and truly *theirs*. All of man‚Äôs children. All for man‚Äôs children.¬†

It all lay there, spelled out in his coffer. Sleeping in chrome. Waiting, patiently. Up to them both to fulfill. The thought made Haber‚Äôs limbs tremble and throat close up, and he might have cried if he wasn‚Äôt driving.¬†¬†

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre *zoning out.*‚Äù¬†¬†

‚ÄúYeah, yeah, fetch me a caffeine stick or I‚Äôll park us in a ditch.‚Äù¬†

She grumbled something inaudible but reached behind and passed the foil-wrapped bar of nutrition. The processed protein *(and the dusted-on caffeine supplement)* did little to curb Haber‚Äôs growing peckishness, but they‚Äôd have a real meal when they got there. They had mighty fine tomato cultures growing last time, and hopefully there were still some left‚Ä¶¬†

The diesel's growl dropped an octave as they crested the final rise ‚Äì the only rise. The perimeter wall was raised timidly over the completely flat and muddy earth, lording over sprawling paddies, square fields and small greenhouses. Small quadrotors were circling lazily overhead, documenting every critter (few as they were, for good reason - hassle to manage, really) and every blade of grass. She was looking somewhere into the distance as they pulled up close to the gate.¬†¬†

Eyes forward, brow creased. She was *probably* scanning for the decoy greenhouse that hid the defense battery. The one with the slightly lower profile and more heat sinks to avoid satellite detection. He parked next to some big lorry, which‚Äôs tarp was dangling over the rear like a big raincoat. The grass underneath was high and undisturbed. For long, perhaps.¬†¬†

It had stopped raining by now, likely thanks to the colony‚Äôs cloudbusters. The air was clean, but the petrichor still stuck to it. Kate‚Äôs black boots were already dodging puddles on their way to the gate. He stuffed the key into his jacket, jogging to catch up. The green text dispensed its dry welcome behind a veil of dust. The gate control was sunken into the polished concrete and rebar, staring back at him, expecting.¬†¬†¬†¬†

‚ÄúOpen sesame,‚Äù he waved his wrist‚Äôs identiband at it.¬†

‚ÄúCLEARANCE ACCEPTED. WELCOME, DOCTOR F. J. HABER.‚Äù¬†¬†

¬†

¬†

The gate vanished into the ground, beckoning them inside. *Nobody* was there to greet them, however‚Ä¶¬†

He narrowed his eyes, scanning the courtyard. ‚ÄúMaybe the medical evac theory wasn‚Äôt that dumb...‚Äù¬†

The plaza before them didn‚Äôt seem odd, at least from a glance. The gravel roads were tidy. No burn marks or signs of struggle. He couldn‚Äôt pinpoint his apprehension about it all. As there wasn‚Äôt anything in particular to point at. Even the precariously constructed wooden stands stood neatly around the chalk-painted concrete square. Flimsy, but normal. That was the point to his unease. The settlement was fine, *very normal.* It was the people who were vacant.¬†¬†

They moved across the square with that same weird, echoing quiet. Their footsteps felt too loud on the gravel. Haber kept glancing down side streets, between buildings, expecting a waving hand or a maintenance worker stepping out from a doorway. The wind whistled a low and droning tune on the aluminum roofing. Other than that, nothing. A colony shouldn't smell this much like wet concrete and *nothing else.*

Their walk towards the center was uneventful, only accentuated by the very faint buzzing of automated drones going about their business. The path lights were blinking at him, casting little shadows to their feet.¬†¬†

Something about the layout clicked just then in his mind, and he almost laughed. *Roman*, he thought. Kate would call him weird (again) if he voiced that, but it was true. Residential buildings in front, arranged in rows. Administrative center and energy infrastructure in its heart, flowing out to every corner, from the entrance gate, to its walls. Workshops, armories, schools, parks and playgrounds all strewn throughout. They were nearing central now, walking past some heat exchangers humming to themselves. It didn‚Äôt do much to quell the chill collecting in Haber‚Äôs gut. Maybe central held some answers.¬†¬†

The road crossed a little park-like area in front of it (government-standard flora and a crooked sort of tree). It looked like it was inhabited, once. Mangled newspaper barely held onto the bench. Toys were lying on the gravel, LED lights blinking dimly. A lunch box lay there too, wide open and empty. There was a tiny pink unicorn on the ground¬†underneath the bench, next to the tree. As if hiding, it stared at him from the shade. It was still rocking. From the wind, *surely*, but it still gave Haber pause. Where was everyone?¬†

He stepped over the tricycle in the path, and towards the low, wide and square bunker in front of them. Both didn‚Äôt say anything as they entered.¬†

The mess hall was clean. Clean as a whistle. The fridges were wide open, buzzing loudly as if to protest it. They were all *empty*. The were no condiments either. Flour stains on the cabinets and floors. Nothing was left in the freezers. Shelves laid empty, only the scraped steel left for them to see. Kate found the cellar door, where the emergency rations were stored. All Federation-sanctioned settlements carried enough provisions to feed hundreds for decades, unrationed, just in case all KAIROS engines in the galaxy just magically broke apart simultaneously. The tins lay there, discarded in a pile stacked almost to the ceiling, each torn into and empty sans the stains. Not even the tasteless yeast-vitamin-bricks were left.¬†

She looked over the pile, and said nothing, but the way she adjusted her glasses told enough.¬†

Haber wandered from the center, almost in a trance, out to the reddish sunshine that was creeping in. The greenhouses behind it were open, more red light peering out. He leaned into one‚Äôs open hatch, and could see how it shone on empty trays, empty lines of soil that was by now *crumpled* from the heat. The fans circled air for plants that weren‚Äôt there. Haber knew that the colonists rationed every joule of energy. This wasn‚Äôt like them.¬†¬†

The fields that lined their way to the perimeter‚Äôs concrete, they were completely barren too. Haber thought at first that they hadn‚Äôt sown yet, but the ground wasn‚Äôt tilled ‚Äì it was *dug* open. \* Someone looking for something?\* There was nothing valuable on 186f, if you ignored the genomic wonders abound. You couldn‚Äôt make much bank with tomato crops. They had electronics, sure, but so had every habitable hunk of rock. One could make more profit salvaging the navigation satellites overhead. Perhaps just Federation currency? It was cryptographically sealed to this place, so it wouldn‚Äôt be much use except for paperweight. This place held *nothing* special. So why the breaking and entering?¬†¬†¬†

A long whirr drew near. The survey drone descended, making immaculate scans of the empty, destroyed soil with audible clicks. Haber stared at it, then at the *rootless* earth, and the gears began turning slowly. The rations, their ripe fields. Those samples Haber froze throughout the years. Kepler-186f could have lasted at least *a century* with that foodstuff. And yet, after less than five weeks, it was all gone. Glaringly so. Every package. Every backup cache. Then the crops. Then the trays. The greenhouses. They had *eaten* everything. The outpost was picked clean ‚Äì not for the precious earths in electronics, not for cryptographically secure USN currency ‚Äì but for *food*. And once the food inside the colony must have run out, they were digging for *more* in the barren ground. Like starving peasants fishing for roots. Haber couldn‚Äôt place why, but that realization made his veins frigid. ¬†  
¬†

He began retracing his steps to central, and it unconsciously turned into a jog. Haber didn‚Äôt want to see those fields behind him anymore. The colony hall‚Äôs door was still ajar, swinging slightly on its hinges. Back and forth, back and forth. He found her in the overseer‚Äôs office, slumped in the chair behind the main console. Her coat hung off one shoulder. Her hair was damp. Her glasses sat beside the silvery coffer, folded neatly. She didn‚Äôt look up when he entered.¬†

Haber stopped in the doorway, chest heaving.¬†

‚ÄúThe food is *gone*,‚Äù he managed between breaths. ‚ÄúThe plants, greenhouses, the fields‚Ä¶ everything‚Ä¶ *gone*.‚Äù¬†

He stepped closer. She was staring at the flickering screen. Her expression didn‚Äôt change.¬†

The feed had been pulled from the external navigation satellites; he could tell by the quality. Federation-grade ‚Äì good enough to be up to code, *barely* enough to see. This feed had a log. She rewound it. Ten days ago, nothing. Nine days ago, a deep-space contact. And on the eighth it was an image, slipping into frame. An object, supplanting the stars of the sky. Like a red nail, long and caked with what looked like rust. It became larger at its end, tip vanishing into a needlepoint in shadow. The geometry was jagged, and it looked like the hilt of a sword on the other side. There at the base dragged many thin wires before it, leading to foils that almost resembled sails. They glittered like chrome in the dark. *Some sort* of vessel, but *nothing* like Haber had ever seen before.¬†¬†

The seventh log did not exist.¬†

‚ÄúIs that a ‚Ä¶ *ship?*‚Äù, his voice was alien to him.¬†¬†

Kate just stared.¬†

He had never seen anything like this before, and there was a nagging suspicion in his head that no other human had. *Not anyone still around to say so*. His knees softened. He reached for the back of the chair to steady himself. His fingers were shaking.¬†

She got up. Didn‚Äôt reach for her coat.¬†¬†

‚ÄúWe should go,‚Äù she finally looked at him. Her gaze was diffuse. He opened his mouth.¬†

‚Äú*We should go.*‚Äù She repeated, more urgently.¬†¬†

¬†\---

His hand hurt, from clutching the Valkyrie‚Äôs stick so tightly. He massaged it as he sat - not on his seat - but behind the electronic switchbox, knees drawn up, so he could watch the bridge‚Äôs mysterious relay to the engine room. That weird little junction box. The one that always rattled and hummed, even if nothing else did. He set the silver coffer against it. Wondrous box, meet bigger wondrous box.¬†¬†

In there the ship was convening with forces so much greater than all that was. The KAIROS engine made KAIROS-shunts, that their frigate would slip into. Like tucking underneath the fabric of reality, and it felt much like it too, from a metaphorical perspective. It was already winding up, as the vacuum coils buzzed and the magic box aligned untold calculations into one. Preparing to tuck them into a new elsewhere, by pressing them flat like a leaf in a fat book. It would tickle a bit.¬†

He kept one hand on the console, the other resting gently on the coffer. It was still warm from her grip. Kate said nothing. She stared straight ahead into the void from her seat, still wrapped in thought. They hadn‚Äôt spoken. Her boots were still muddied from Kepler-186f.¬†¬†

He looked out at the stars as well, or rather, where they used to be. Already, they were bending and sliding. From points of light to lines. From lines to nothing. Haber closed his eyes, but he could see the pink plastic bobbing in his mind.¬†

‚Äú*Take us away from here‚Ä¶*‚Äù he whispered.¬†

And space folded.¬†¬†

And they were gone.¬†

1m38btj,https://www.reddit.com/r/SIBO/comments/1m38btj/gi_consultion/,GI consultion,"Hi everyone 

I have been suffering from a series of GI symptoms over the course of the last year or so. Symptoms: constant abdominal distention (but no gas or pain), constipation, early satiety, and general slow motility. Ran a series of blood tests. Hormones, thyroid, etc all seem normal. Family doctor said it's just IBS but I advocated for and endoscopy and colonoscopy. Those showed a small hiatal hernia and a tortuous bowel, but those are not the cause of my symptoms. 

I've been on the low FODMAP diet for about a month now. Aside from a couple of slip ups, I've been following it strictly. It has helped my symptoms a lot, but it hasn't resolved them. My abdomen is always at least a little swollen (and firm above the belly button). After I eat, I bloat up for a couple of hours and then it goes down to the baseline swelling. I am also still prone to all the other symptoms I listed above.

After scouring this subreddit, I've realized I probably have SIBO and/or some other pathogen. My guess is that low stomach acid is a likely culprit. Reintegrating coffee, 2,000mg of vitamin C, and metamucil tablets has helped to keep my bowels from stagnating. I've found the combo to keep things at bay, but of course I want to tackle this on all fronts. 

I have a phone consultation scheduled with my GI in a few weeks and I want to go in prepared and be able to advocate for myself. Of course, I'll be requesting a SIBO breath test, but I wanted to ask for advice on what else I should say and what other kind of testing I should request to rule out any possible culprits. 

Thank you, guys! 

TLDR; what to ask for at a GI consult for a thorough diagnosis.

1m38bpr,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmIOverreacting/comments/1m38bpr/aio_my_grandparents_keep_making_comments_about/,AIO: My grandparents keep making comments about what I eat and it's driving me insane,"This is my first time posting here, but I need an impartial perspective to know if this is just in my head and I should just let it go or if my feelings are justified. So I (18f) am currently traveling with my grandparents and 3 cousins (all of which are younger than me, the oldest is 14 and the youngest is 10). I arrived to their house on Sunday night, but the problems started on Tuesday, when we ate at a restaurant and when I finished, my Grandma made a small comment about how much I ate, the thing is, that I saw what my cousins were eating and I know that what I ate had less calories. Later that same day we went to a coffee shop, my cousin (14) ordered an iced chocolate drink and I ordered the same, not realizing she had ordered it with whipped cream (which I never eat), and when the drinks came, she scolded us and told us that whipped cream will fattens people up, she did not listen when I told her that I don't even like it and apparently she also didn't notice that I left all the whipped cream there. I even took pictures because I was scared that she would tell my parents about how I am eating unholy amounts of sugar or something. Then my youngest cousin wanted to go to the cinema to watch the new Superman movie, so we went, and my cousins ordered popcorn and Ice slushes, I didn't order anything, although my oldest younger cousin offered to share some of her popcorn if I wanted, but anyway, I helped them carry their food and my Grandma just looked at me and shook her head and even when I explained that nothing of what I was carrying was mine, she still made a comment about too many calories. The next day nothing really happened, but then yesterday, we went to a restaurant for breakfast, I ordered eggs with tomato and epazote, then I shared a pastry with two of my cousins (the younger ones) because the 14 year-old had ordered pancakes and was already full. So I cut the pastry in three pieces, my youngest cousin decided to eat only half of her piece, so I grabbed it to offer it to my grandparents, but they scolded me and told me that I had already had my piece, and they didn't say anything when I told them that I was just grabbing the plate to give it to them, they declined it and I gave the plate to the cousin who hadn't eaten it. She hadn't finished the pancakes and I asked for a bite because she had told me that they were amazing, she was already too full, so she said yes and I grabbed a bite to taste it and other cousin (not the youngest) grabbed the rest. But my grandparents started scolding me telling me that I had too much sugar and calories and that I had just spent the entire breakfast stealing my cousins' food, which, I only grabbed some fruit that my cousin didn't like (two slices), but I don't know, I nearly cried and had to rant to my mom by text because I got really angry. Then today for breakfast, I finished bu U wanted another piece of cheese and they scolded me again for eating too much. I was the only person in that table that didn't have waffles or a pastry so I don't understand why I am being yelled at for cheese. Also, while we were eating she said that a other cousin and me needed to lose weight, which okay, maybe don't say that in front of everyone and maybe not while we're eating? I have thyroid issues that I haven't been able to get treatment for, so I visit the nutritionist to keep my weight and everything in order. I also am medium sized, although I have a lot in small size and a few in large size. My grandparents also don't know how much I weight, so I don't know how they are sure that I need to lose some kilos. And I could lose some, I'm not denying it, but I am quite confused at how they just state that I'm overweight without really knowing how much I weight. And maybe it's my imagination but it feels more targeted towards me, yesterday at dinner I had tea and a cookie I shared with 3 other people. Two of my cousins had a piece of cake each and the other one an Oreo milkshake. And I just know that if I had ordered the same I would have gotten the scolding of my life. There is something to consider here: I started my period today so I have been quite hormonal this days, I also have a history of anxiety, dissociation and SH, so maybe my brain is just making a big deal out of nothing, also, I am worrying because this whole situation almost made me relapse, and after each comment I almost want to make myself throw out (which I know I can't do, because I have tried and it's not physically posible for me). So I need to know, if only for my peace of mind if this is really just me overreacting and making a drama out of nothing or if my grandparents are maybe overstepping boundaries a little bit.",2,1752859301.0,AmIOverreacting,0,1.0,False
1m38blr,https://www.reddit.com/r/NovelNexus/comments/1m38blr/the_rooster_bar_novel_by_john_grisham/,The Rooster Bar Novel by John Grisham:,"The end of the year brought the usual holiday festivities, though around the Frazier house there was little to cheer. Mrs. Frazier went through the motions of decorating a small tree and wrapping a few cheap gifts and baking cookies no one really wanted, and, as always, she kept The Nutcracker running nonstop on the stereo as she gamely hummed along in the kitchen as though the season was merry.  
  
¬† Things were anything but merry. Mr. Frazier had moved out three years earlier, and he wasn‚Äôt missed as much as he was despised. In no time, he had moved in with his young secretary, who, as things developed, was already pregnant. Mrs. Frazier, jilted, humiliated, broke, and depressed, was still struggling.  
  
¬† Louie, her younger son, was under house arrest, sort of free on bail, and facing a rough year ahead with the drug charges and all. He made no effort to buy his mom anything in the way of a gift. His excuse was that he couldn‚Äôt leave the house because of the court-ordered monitor attached to his ankle. But even without it, no one expected Louie to go to the trouble of buying gifts. The year before and the year before that both of his ankles had been unburdened and he hadn‚Äôt bothered to shop.  
  
¬† Mark, the older son, was home from the horrors of law school, and, though even poorer than his brother, had managed to buy his mother some perfume. He was scheduled to graduate in May, sit for the bar exam in July, and begin working with a D.C. firm in September, which, as it so happened, was the same month Louie‚Äôs trial was on the docket. But Louie‚Äôs case would not go to trial for two very good reasons. First, the undercover boys had caught him in the act of selling ten bags of crack‚Äîthere was even a video‚Äîand, second, neither Louie nor his mother could afford a decent lawyer to handle the mess. Throughout the holidays, both Louie and Mrs. Frazier dropped hints that Mark should rush in and volunteer to defend his brother. Wouldn‚Äôt it be easy to stall matters until later in the year when Mark was properly admitted to the bar‚Äîhe was practically there anyway‚Äîand once he had his license wouldn‚Äôt it be a simple matter of finding one of those technicalities you read about to get the charges dismissed?  
  
¬† This little fantasy of theirs had some rather large holes in it, but Mark refused to discuss it. When it became apparent that Louie planned to hog the sofa for at least ten hours on New Year‚Äôs Day and watch seven straight bowl games, Mark made a quiet exit and went to a friend‚Äôs house. Returning home that night, while driving under the influence, he made the decision to flee. He would return to D.C. and kill some time puttering around the law firm where he would soon be employed. Classes didn‚Äôt start for almost two weeks, but after ten days of listening to Louie bitch and moan about his problems, not to mention the nonstop Nutcracker, Mark was fed up and looking forward to his last semester of law school.  
  
¬† He set his alarm for eight the following morning, and over coffee with his mom explained that he was needed back in D.C. Sorry to leave a bit earlier than expected, Mom, and sorry to leave you here all alone with your bad boy, Mom, but I‚Äôm outta here. He‚Äôs not mine to raise. I got my own problems.  
  
¬† The first problem was his vehicle, a Ford Bronco he‚Äôd been driving since high school. The odometer had frozen at 187,000 miles, and that had happened midway through college. It desperately needed a new fuel pump, one of many replacement parts on the Urgent List. Using tape and paper clips, Mark had been able to wire and jerry-rig the engine, transmission, and brakes for the past two years, but he‚Äôd had no luck with the fuel pump. It worked but at a lower capacity than normal, so that the Bronco‚Äôs max speed was forty-nine on level ground. To avoid being clobbered by 18-wheelers on the expressways, Mark stuck to the back roads of rural Delaware and the Eastern Shore. The two-hour drive from Dover to central D.C. took twice as long.  
  
¬† This gave him even more time to consider his other problems. Number two was his suffocating student debt. He‚Äôd finished college with $60,000 in loans, and no job. His father, who seemed happily married at the time but was also in debt, had warned him against further studies. He‚Äôd said, ‚ÄúHell, boy, four years of education and you‚Äôre sixty grand in the hole. Quit before it gets any worse.‚Äù But Mark thought taking any financial advice from his father was foolish, so he worked a couple of years here and there, bartending and delivering pizza, while he haggled with his lenders. Now, looking back, he wasn‚Äôt sure where the idea of law school had originated, but he did remember overhearing a conversation between two frat brothers who were pondering weighty matters while drinking heavily. Mark was the bartender, the lounge was not crowded, and after the fourth round of vodka and cranberry juice they talked loud enough for all to hear. Among many interesting things they had said, Mark had always remembered two: ‚ÄúThe big D.C. law firms are hiring like crazy.‚Äù And, ‚ÄúStarting salaries are one-fifty a year.‚Äù  
  
¬† Not long after that, he bumped into a college friend who was a first-year student at the Foggy Bottom Law School in D.C., and the guy gushed on about his plans to blitz through his studies, finish in two and a half years, and sign on with a big firm for a fat salary. The Feds were throwing loans at students, anybody could qualify, and, well sure, he would graduate with a mountain of debt but nothing he couldn‚Äôt wipe out in five years. To his friend, at least, it made perfect sense to ‚Äúinvest in himself‚Äù with the debt because it would guarantee all that future earning power.  
  
¬† Mark took the bait and began studying for the Law School Admission Test. His score was an unimpressive 146, but this did not bother the admissions folks at the Foggy Bottom Law School. Nor did his rather thin undergraduate r√©sum√© with an anemic grade point average of 2.8. FBLS accepted him with open arms. His loan applications were quickly approved. Sixty-five thousand bucks were simply transferred from the Department of Education each year to Foggy Bottom. And now, with one semester to go, Mark was staring miserably at the reality of graduating with a combined total, undergrad and law school, principal and interest, of $266,000 in debt.  
  
¬† Another problem was his job. As it happened, the market wasn‚Äôt quite as strong as rumored. Nor was it as vibrant as FBLS had advertised in its slick brochures and near-fraudulent website. Graduates from top-tier law schools were still finding work at enviable salaries. FBLS, though, was not quite in the top tier. Mark had managed to worm his way into a midsized law firm that specialized in ‚Äúgovernmental relations,‚Äù which meant nothing more than lobbying. His starting salary had not been established, because the firm‚Äôs management committee would meet in early January to review profits from the previous year and supposedly jiggle the pay structure. In a few months, Mark would be expected to have an important talk with his ‚Äúloan counselor‚Äù about restructuring his student debt and somehow repaying the entire mess. This counselor had already expressed concern that Mark did not know how much he would be earning. This concerned Mark too, especially when added to the fact that he didn‚Äôt trust a single person he‚Äôd met at the law firm. As much as he tried to fool himself, he knew deep in his gut that his position was not secure.  
  
¬† Another problem was the bar exam. Because of demand, the D.C. version of the test was one of the more challenging in the nation, and FBLS grads had been bombing it at an alarming rate. Again, the top schools in town did well. The year before, Georgetown had a 91 percent pass rate. For George Washington it was 89 percent. For FBLS, the pass rate was a pathetic 56 percent. To succeed, Mark needed to start studying now, in early January, and hit the books nonstop for six months.  
  
¬† But the energy simply wasn‚Äôt there, especially in the cold, dreary, depressing days of winter. At times the debt felt like cinder blocks strapped to his back. Walking was a chore. Smiling was difficult. He was living in poverty and his future, even with the job, was bleak. And he was one of the fortunate ones. Most of his classmates had the loans but not the jobs. Looking back, he‚Äôd heard the grumbling even in his first year, and with each semester the mood at  
school grew darker, the suspicions heavier. The job market worsened. The bar exam results embarrassed everyone at FBLS. The loans piled up. Now, in his third and last year, it was not unusual to hear students verbally spar with professors in class. The dean wouldn‚Äôt come out of his office. Bloggers blistered the school and screamed harsh questions: ‚ÄúIs this a hoax?‚Äù ‚ÄúHave we been had?‚Äù ‚ÄúWhere did all the money go?‚Äù  
  
¬† To varying degrees, almost everyone Mark knew believed that (1) FBLS was a subpar law school that (2) made too many promises, and (3) charged too much money, and (4) encouraged too much debt while (5) admitting a lot of mediocre students who really had no business in law school, and (6) were either not properly prepared for the bar exam or (7) too dumb to pass it.  
  
¬† There were rumors that applications to FBLS had fallen by 50 percent. With no state support, and no endowment, such a decline would lead to all manner of painful cost cutting, and a bad law school would only get worse. This was fine with Mark Frazier and his friends. They would endure the next four months and happily leave the place, never to return.  
  
¬† ‚Äî  
  
¬† MARK LIVED IN a five-story apartment building that was eighty years old and visibly deteriorating, but the rent was low and this attracted students from George Washington and FBLS. In its earlier days it had been known as the Cooper House, but after three decades of frat-like wear and tear it had earned its nickname as the Coop. Because its elevators seldom worked, Mark took the stairs to the third floor and entered his cramped and sparsely furnished flat, for which he paid $800 a month for five hundred square feet. For some reason he‚Äôd cleaned the place after his last exam before the holidays, and as he flipped on lights he was pleased to see that everything was in order. And why shouldn‚Äôt it be? The slumlord who owned the place never came around. He unloaded his bags and was struck by the silence. Normally, with a bunch of students, and with thin walls, there was always a racket. Stereos, televisions, arguments, pranks, poker games, fights, guitar playing, even a trombone played by a nerd on the fourth floor that could rattle the entire building. But not today. Everyone was still at home, enjoying the break, and the halls were eerily quiet.  
  
¬† After half an hour, Mark was bored and left the building. Walking along New Hampshire Avenue, with the wind cutting through his thin fleece and old khakis, he decided, for some reason, to turn onto Twenty-First and stop by the law school to see if it was open. In a city with no shortage of hideous modern buildings, FBLS managed to stand out in its unsightliness. It was a postwar edifice covered with bland yellow bricks on eight levels slung together in asymmetrical wings, some failed architect‚Äôs effort at making a statement. Supposedly, it once was an office building, but walls had been knocked out with abandon to create cramped lecture halls on the four lower floors. On the fifth was the library, a rabbits‚Äô warren of large, retrofitted rooms packed with seldom-touched books and some replicated portraits of unknown judges and legal scholars. The faculty had offices on the sixth and seventh floors, and on the eighth, and as far away from the students as possible, the administration carried on, with the dean solidly hidden in a corner office from which he seldom ventured.  
  
¬† The front door was unlocked and Mark entered the empty lobby. While he appreciated its warmth, he found the area, as always, utterly depressing. A huge bulletin board covered one wall with all manner of notices and announcements and enticements. There were a few slick posters advertising opportunities to study abroad, and the usual assortment of handmade ads offering stuff for sale‚Äîbooks, bikes, tickets, course outlines, tutors by the hour‚Äîand apartments for rent. The bar exam loomed over the entire school like a dark cloud and there were posters extolling the excellence of some review courses. If he searched hard enough he could possibly find a few employment opportunities, but at FBLS those had become scarcer by the year. In one corner he saw the same old brochures hawking even more student loans. At the far end of the lobby there were vending machines and a small coffee bar, but nothing was being brewed during the break.  
  
¬† He fell into a battered leather chair and soaked in the gloominess of his school. Was it really a school or was it just another diploma mill? The answer was becoming clear. For the thousandth time he wished he had never walked through the front doors as an unsuspecting first-year student. Now, almost three years later, he was burdened by loans he couldn‚Äôt imagine paying off. If there was a light at the end of the tunnel, he couldn‚Äôt see it.  
  
¬† And why would anyone name a school Foggy Bottom? As if the law school experience itself wasn‚Äôt dreary enough, some bright soul had, some twenty years earlier, tagged it with a name that conveyed even more cheerlessness. That guy, now dead, had sold the school to some Wall Street investors who owned a string of law schools that were reportedly producing handsome profits while cranking out little in the way of legal talent.  
  
¬† How do you buy and sell law schools? It was still a mystery.  
  
¬† Mark heard voices and hurriedly left the building. He hiked down New Hampshire to Dupont Circle, where he ducked into Kramer Books for a coffee and a quick thaw. He walked everywhere. His Bronco lurched and stalled too much in city traffic, and he kept it tucked away in a lot behind the Coop, always with the key in the ignition. Unfortunately, so far no one had been tempted to steal it.  
  
¬† Warm again, he hustled six blocks north along Connecticut Avenue. The law firm of Ness Skelton occupied a few floors in a modern building near the Hinckley Hilton. The previous summer Mark had managed to weasel his way inside when he accepted an internship that paid less than minimum wage. At major law firms, the summer programs were used to entice top students to the big life. Little work was expected. The interns were given ridiculously easy schedules, along with tickets to ball games and invitations to fine parties in the splendid backyards of the wealthy partners. Once seduced, they signed on, and upon graduation were soon thrown into the meat grinder of hundred-hour weeks.  
  
¬† Not so at Ness Skelton. With only fifty lawyers, it was far from a top-ten firm. Its clients were trade associations‚ÄîSoybean Forum, Retired Postal Workers, Beef and Lamb Council, National Asphalt Contractors, Disabled Railroad Engineers‚Äîand several defense contractors desperate for their share of the pork. The firm‚Äôs expertise, if it had any, was maintaining relationships with Congress. Its summer intern program was designed more to exploit cheap labor than to attract top students. Mark had worked hard and suffered through the stultifying work. At the end of the summer, when he had received an offer that somewhat resembled a position upon passing the bar exam, he couldn‚Äôt decide if he should celebrate or cry. Nonetheless, he jumped at what was being offered‚Äîthere was nothing else on the table‚Äîand proudly became one of the few FBLS students with a future. Throughout the fall, he had gently pressed his supervisor about the terms of his upcoming employment but got nowhere. There might be a merger in the works. There might be a split. There might be a lot of things, but an employment contract was not one of them.  
  
¬† So he hung around. Afternoons, Saturdays, holidays, anytime he was bored he would stop by the firm, always with a big fake smile and an eagerness to pitch in and help with the grunt work. It was not clear if this was beneficial, but he figured it couldn‚Äôt hurt.  
  
¬† His supervisor was named Randall, a ten-year guy on the verge of making partner, and thus under a lot of pressure. A Ness Skelton associate who didn‚Äôt make partner after ten years was quietly shown the door. Randall was a George Washington law grad, which, in the city‚Äôs pecking order, was a step down from Georgetown but several notches above Foggy Bottom. The hierarchy was clear and rigid, and its worst perpetrators were the GW lawyers. They detested being looked down upon by the Georgetown gang; thus they were eager to look down with even more disdain on anyone from FBLS. The entire firm reeked of cliques and snobbery, and Mark often wondered how in hell he wound up there. Two associates were from FBLS, but they were so busy trying to distance themselves from their school they had no time to lend Mark a hand. Indeed, they seemed to ignore him more than anyone else. Mark had often mumbled, ‚ÄúWhat a way to run a law firm.‚Äù But then he figur  
ed that every profession had its levels of status. He was far too worried about his own skin to fret over where the other cutthroats had studied law. He had his own problems.  
  
¬† He had e-mailed Randall and said he would be dropping by to do whatever grunt work was available. Randall greeted him with a curt ‚ÄúBack so soon?‚Äù  
  
¬† Sure, Randall, and how were your holidays? Great to see you. ‚ÄúYeah, got bored with all the holiday crap. What‚Äôs up?‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúTwo of the secretaries are out with the flu,‚Äù Randall said. He pointed to a stack of documents a foot thick. ‚ÄúI need that copied fourteen times, all collated and stapled.‚Äù  
  
¬† Okay, back to the copy room, Mark thought. ‚ÄúSure,‚Äù he said as if he couldn‚Äôt wait to jump in. He hauled the documents down to the basement, to a dungeon filled with copiers. He spent the next three hours doing mindless work for which he would be paid nothing.  
  
¬† He almost missed Louie and his ankle monitor.  
  
¬† 2  
  
¬† Like Mark, Todd Lucero was inspired to become a lawyer by booze-tinted conversations he‚Äôd overheard in a bar. For the past three years, he had been mixing drinks at the Old Red Cat, a pub-style watering hole favored by students from GW and Foggy Bottom. After college at Frostburg State, he‚Äôd left Baltimore and drifted into D.C. in search of a career. Finding none, he hired on at the Old Red Cat as a part-timer and soon realized he had a fondness for pulling pints and mixing strong drinks. He‚Äôd come to love the pub life and had a gift for schmoozing with the serious drinkers while placating the rowdies. Todd was everybody‚Äôs favorite bartender and was on a first-name basis with hundreds of his regulars.  
  
¬† Many times over the past two and a half years he had thought of quitting law school to pursue his dream of owning his own bar. His father, though, had strong opinions to the contrary. Mr. Lucero was a cop in Baltimore and had always pushed his son to obtain a professional degree. Pushing was one thing, but paying for it was something else. And so Todd had fallen into the same trap of borrowing easy money and handing it over to the greedy folks at FBLS.  
  
¬† He and Mark Frazier had met the first day, during orientation, back when they were both starry-eyed and envisioning big law careers with fat salaries, back when they, along with 350 others, were horribly naive. He vowed to quit after his first year, but his father yelled at him. Because of his commitment to the bar, he had never found the time to knock on doors around D.C. and hustle for summer internships. He vowed to quit after his second year and cut off the flow of debt, but his loan counselor strongly advised against it. As long as he was in school he did not have to confront some brutal repayment schedule, so it made perfect sense to keep borrowing in order to graduate and find one of those lucrative jobs that, in theory, would eventually take care of the debts. Now, though, with only one semester to go, he knew only too well such jobs did not exist.  
  
¬† If only he‚Äôd borrowed $195,000 from a bank and opened his bar. He could be printing money and enjoying life.  
  
¬† ‚Äî  
  
¬† MARK ENTERED THE Old Red Cat just after dark and took his favorite place at the end of the bar. He fist-bumped Todd and said, ‚ÄúGood to see you, man.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúYou too,‚Äù Todd said as he slid over a frosty mug of light beer. With his seniority, Todd could comp anyone he damn well pleased, and Mark had not paid in years.  
  
¬† With the students away, the place was quiet. Todd leaned on his elbows and asked, ‚ÄúSo what are you up to?‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúWell, I‚Äôve spent the afternoon at dear old Ness Skelton, in the copy room sorting papers that no one will ever read. More stupid work. Even the paralegals look down their noses at me. I hate the place and I haven‚Äôt even been hired yet.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúStill no contract?‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúNone, and the picture gets fuzzier every day.‚Äù  
  
¬† Todd took a quick sip from his mug stashed under the counter. Even with his seniority, he wasn‚Äôt supposed to drink on the job, but his boss wasn‚Äôt in. He asked, ‚ÄúSo how was Christmas around the Frazier house? Ho, ho, ho. I lasted ten miserable days and got the hell out. You?‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúThree days, then duty called and I came back to work. How‚Äôs Louie?‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúStill seriously indicted, still looking at real jail time. I should feel sorry for him but compassion runs thin for a guy who sleeps half the day and spends the other half on the sofa watching Judge Judy and bitching about his ankle monitor. My poor mom.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre pretty hard on him.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúNot hard enough. That‚Äôs his problem. No one‚Äôs ever been hard on Louie. He got caught with pot when he was thirteen, blamed it on a friend, and of course my parents rushed to his defense. He‚Äôs never been held accountable. Until now.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúBummer, man. I can‚Äôt imagine having a brother in prison.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúYeah, it sucks. I just wish I could help him but there‚Äôs no way.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúI won‚Äôt even ask about your dad.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúDidn‚Äôt see him and didn‚Äôt hear from him. Not even a card. He‚Äôs fifty years old and the proud papa of a three-year-old, so I guess he played Santa Claus. Laid out a bunch of toys under the tree, smiled like an idiot when the kid came down the stairs squealing. What a rat.‚Äù  
  
¬† Two coeds walked to the bar and Todd left to serve them. Mark pulled out his phone and checked his messages.  
  
¬† When Todd returned, he asked, ‚ÄúHave you seen any grades yet?‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúNo. Who cares? We‚Äôre all top students.‚Äù Grades at Foggy Bottom were a joke. It was imperative that the school‚Äôs graduates finish with sparkling r√©sum√©s, and to that end the professors passed out As and Bs like cheap candy. No one flunked out of FBLS. So, of course, this had created a culture of rather listless studying, which, of course, killed any chance of competitive learning. A bunch of mediocre students became even more mediocre. No wonder the bar exam was such a challenge. Mark added, ‚ÄúAnd you really can‚Äôt expect a bunch of overpaid professors to grade exams during the holidays, can you?‚Äù  
  
¬† Todd took another sip, leaned even closer, and said, ‚ÄúWe have a bigger problem.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúGordy?‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúGordy.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúI was afraid of that. I‚Äôve texted and tried to call but his phone‚Äôs turned off. What‚Äôs going on?‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs bad,‚Äù Todd said. ‚ÄúEvidently, he went home for Christmas and spent his time fighting with Brenda. She wants a big church wedding with a thousand people. Gordy doesn‚Äôt want to get married. Her mother has a lot to say. His mother is not speaking to her mother and the whole thing is blowing up.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúThey‚Äôre getting married May 15, Todd. As I recall, you and I signed on as groomsmen.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúWell, don‚Äôt bet on it. He‚Äôs already back in town and off his meds. Zola stopped by this afternoon and gave me the heads-up.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúWhat meds?‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a long story.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúWhat meds?‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs bipolar, Mark. Diagnosed a few years back.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre kidding, right?‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúWhy would I kid about this? He‚Äôs bipolar and Zola says he‚Äôs off his medication.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúWhy wouldn‚Äôt he tell us?‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt answer that.‚Äù  
  
¬† Mark took a long drink of beer and shook his head. He asked, ‚ÄúZola‚Äôs back already?‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúYes, evidently she and Gordy hurried back for a few days of fun and games, though I‚Äôm not sure they‚Äôre having much fun. She thinks he quit his meds about a month ago when we were studying for finals. One day he‚Äôs manic and bouncing off the walls; then he‚Äôs in a stupor after sipping tequila and smoking weed. He‚Äôs talking crazy, says he wants to quit school and run off to Jamaica, with Zola of course. She thinks he might do something stupid and hurt himself.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúGordy is stupid. He‚Äôs engaged to his high school sweetheart, a real cutie who happens to have money, and now he‚Äôs shacking up with an African girl whose parents and brothers are in this country without the benefit of those immigration papers everyone is talking about. Yes, the boy is stupid.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúGordy‚Äôs in trouble, Mark. He‚Äôs been sliding for several weeks and he needs our help.‚Äù  
  
¬† Mark pushed his beer away, but only a few inches, and clasped his hands behind his head. ‚ÄúAs if we don‚Äôt have enough to worry about. How, exactly, are we supposed to help?‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúYou tell me. She‚Äôs trying to keep an eye on him and she wants us to come over tonight.‚Äù  
  
¬† Mark started laughing and took another sip.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs so funny?‚Äù Todd asked.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúNothing, but can you imagine the scandal in Martinsburg, West Virginia, if word got out that Gordon Tanner, whose father is a church deacon and whose fianc√©e is the daughter of a prominent doctor, lost his mind and quit law school to run off to Jamaica with an African Muslim?‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúI can almost see the humor.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúWell, try harder. It‚Äôs a scream.‚Äù But the laughter had stopped. ‚ÄúLook, Todd, we can‚Äôt make him take his meds. If we tried to he‚Äôd kick both our asses.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúHe needs our help, Mark. I get off at nine tonight and we‚Äôre going over.‚Äù  
  
¬† A man in a nice suit sat at the bar and Todd walked over to take his order. Mark sipped his beer and sank into an even deeper funk.  
  
¬† 3  
  
¬† Three years before Zola Maal was born, her parents fled Senegal. They resettled in a Johannesburg slum with their two young sons and found menial jobs scrubbing floors and digging ditches. After two years, they had saved enough for a boat ride. Using the services of a broker/trafficker, they paid for a miserable trip to Miami aboard a Liberian freighter, along with a dozen other Senegalese. When they were safely smuggled ashore, an uncle met them and drove them to his home in Newark, New Jersey, where they lived in a two-room apartment in a building filled with other folks from Senegal, not a single one of whom held a green card.  
  
¬† A year after they arrived in the U.S., Zola was born at Newark‚Äôs University Hospital and instantly became an American citizen. While her parents worked two and three jobs, all for cash at less than minimum wage, Zola and her brothers attended school and assimilated into the community. As devout Muslims, they practiced their religion, though at an early age Zola found herself attracted to Western ways. Her father was a strict man who insisted that their native tongues of Wolof and French be replaced with English. The boys absorbed the new language and helped their parents with it at home.  
  
¬† The family moved often around Newark, always to cramped apartments, each one slightly larger than the last, and always with other Senegalese close by. All of them lived in fear of being deported, but there was safety in numbers, or so they believed. Every knock on the door brought a brief shudder of fear. Staying out of trouble was imperative, and Zola and her brothers were taught to avoid anything that might attract the wrong kind of attention. Even though she had the right papers, she knew that her family was in jeopardy. She lived with the horror of her parents and brothers being arrested and sent back to Senegal.  
  
¬† When she was fifteen, she found her first job washing dishes in a diner, for cash of course, and not much of it. Her brothers worked too, and the entire family scrimped and saved as much as possible.  
  
¬† When Zola wasn‚Äôt working she was studying. She breezed through high school with good grades and enrolled in a community college as a part-time student. A small scholarship allowed her to become full-time and also landed her a job in the college library. But she still washed dishes, and cleaned houses with her mother, and babysat children for family friends with better jobs. Her oldest brother married an American girl who was not a Muslim, and though that meant an easier route to citizenship, it caused serious friction with her parents. The brother and his new wife moved to California to start another life.  
  
¬† At the age of twenty, Zola left home and enrolled as a junior at Montclair State. She lived in a dorm with two American girls, both of whom were also on tight budgets. She chose accounting as a major because she enjoyed working with numbers and had a knack for finance. She studied hard when time allowed, but the juggling of two and sometimes three jobs often interfered with the books. Her roommates intro  
duced her to the partying scene and she discovered she had a knack for that too. While she clung to the strict Muslim prohibition against alcohol, and she really didn‚Äôt like the taste of any of it anyway, she was more receptive to other temptations, primarily fashion and sex. She was almost six feet tall and was often told how great she looked in tight jeans. Her first boyfriend happily taught her all about sex. Her second introduced her to recreational drugs. By the end of her junior year she silently and defiantly considered herself a nonpracticing Muslim, though her parents had no clue.  
  
¬† Her parents would soon have more serious problems. During the fall semester of her senior year, her father was arrested and jailed for two weeks before bail was arranged. At the time, he was working for a painting contractor, another Senegalese with proper documents. Evidently, his boss had underbid a union contractor for a job painting the interior of a large office complex in Newark. The union contractor notified Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) and reported that illegals were being used. That was serious enough, but some office supplies were allegedly missing and fingers were being pointed. Zola‚Äôs father and four other undocumented workers were charged with grand larceny. He was served with a Notice to Appear in immigration court, along with a criminal indictment.  
  
¬† Zola hired a lawyer who claimed to specialize in such matters and the family forked over a retainer of $9,000, virtually all its savings. The lawyer was extremely busy and seldom returned their phone calls. With her parents and brother hiding in and around Newark, Zola was left to haggle with the lawyer. She grew to despise the man, a fast talker who liked to stretch the truth, and would have fired him had it not been for the retainer. There was no money to hire another. When he failed to appear in court, the judge kicked him off the case. Zola eventually convinced a legal aid lawyer to step in and the indictment was dismissed. The deportation, however, was not going away. The case dragged on and became so distracting that her grades suffered. After several court appearances and hearings, she became convinced that all lawyers were either lazy or stupid and that she could do a better job herself.  
  
¬† She fell for the scam that easy federal money could make law school possible for everyone, and took the first bold steps that would lead to Foggy Bottom. Now, halfway through her final year of law school, she owed more money than she could imagine. Both parents and Bo, her unmarried brother, were still facing deportation, though their cases were languishing in the backlogged immigration courts.  
  
¬† ‚Äî  
  
¬† SHE LIVED ON Twenty-Third Street in a building not quite as dilapidated as the Coop but similar in many respects. It was packed with students crammed into small, cheaply furnished flats. Early in her third year, she had met Gordon Tanner, a handsome, athletic blond boy who lived directly across the hall. One thing quickly led to another, and they began an ill-fated affair, one that soon led to conversations about living together, to save money of course. Gordon finally nixed the idea because Brenda, his pretty fianc√©e from home, loved the big city and visited often.  
  
¬† Juggling two women proved too much for Gordy. He‚Äôd been engaged to Brenda for practically his entire life and now wanted desperately to avoid a marriage. Zola raised far different issues, and he had not convinced himself he was brave enough to run off with a black girl and never see his family and friends again. Add the strain of a soft or even nonexistent job market, suffocating debt, and the prospect of flunking the bar exam, and Gordy lost control. He had been diagnosed as bipolar five years earlier. Meds and psychotherapy worked well, and, with the exception of a frightening episode in college, his life had been pretty normal. That changed around Thanksgiving of his third year at Foggy Bottom, when he stopped taking his meds. Zola was shocked at the mood swings and finally confronted him. He admitted his condition and went back on the meds. The ups and downs leveled out for a couple of weeks.  
  
¬† They finished exams and went home for the holidays, though neither wanted to. Gordy was determined to provoke the final fight with Brenda and blow up the wedding. Zola did not want to spend time with her family. Even with his troubles, her father would find the need to unload lectures and tirades on her sinful Western lifestyle.  
  
¬† After a week they were back in D.C. with Gordy still engaged, the wedding still on for May 15. But he was off his meds and behaving erratically. For two days he never left his bedroom, sleeping for hours, then sitting with his chin on his knees, staring at the dark walls. Zola came and went, uncertain about what to do. He disappeared for three days while sending her text messages that he was on the train to New York, to ‚Äúinterview some people.‚Äù He was on the trail of a great conspiracy and had a lot of work to do. She was asleep in her apartment when he barged in at four in the morning, ripping off clothes and wanting sex. Later in the day he disappeared again, chasing bad guys and ‚Äúdigging for dirt.‚Äù When he returned he was still manic and spent hours with his laptop. He told her to stay away from his apartment because he had so much work to do.  
  
¬† Frightened and exasperated, Zola finally went to the Old Red Cat and talked to Todd.  
  
¬† 4  
  
¬† She met them at the stoop in front of the building and they followed her up the stairs to her apartment on the second floor. When they were inside she closed the door and thanked them for coming. She was obviously worried, almost frantic.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúWhere is he?‚Äù Mark asked.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúOver there,‚Äù Zola said, nodding toward the hall. ‚ÄúHe won‚Äôt let me in and he won‚Äôt come out. I don‚Äôt think he‚Äôs slept much in the past two days. He‚Äôs up and down and right now he‚Äôs bouncing off the walls.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúAnd no meds?‚Äù Todd asked.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúEvidently not, at least none from the pharmacy. I suspect there‚Äôs some self-medicating going on.‚Äù  
  
¬† They looked at one another, each waiting for someone to make the next move. Mark finally said, ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs go.‚Äù They stepped across the hall and Mark knocked on the door. ‚ÄúGordy, it‚Äôs Mark. I‚Äôm here with Todd and Zola and we want to talk.‚Äù  
  
¬† Silence. Springsteen could barely be heard in the background.  
  
¬† Mark knocked again and repeated himself. The music died. A chair or a stool was kicked and fell over. More silence, then the doorknob clicked. A few seconds passed, and Mark opened the door.  
  
¬† Gordy was standing in the center of the cramped room, wearing nothing but an old pair of yellow Redskins gym shorts, the same pair they had seen a hundred times. He was staring at a wall and ignored them as they eased into the room. To their left, the kitchenette was a wreck with empty beer cans and liquor bottles left in the sink and strewn along the counters. The floor was littered with paper cups, used napkins, and sandwich wrappers. To their right, the small dining table was piled high with papers in random stacks around a laptop and printer. Under it, the floor was covered with papers and files and discarded magazine articles. The sofa, television, recliner, and coffee table had been shoved as tightly as possible into one corner, as if to clear everything away from the wall.  
  
¬† The wall was a maze of white poster boards and dozens of sheets of copy paper, all arranged in some crazed order and secured with colored pushpins and Scotch tape. With black, blue, and red markers, Gordy was in the process of piecing together a gigantic corporate puzzle, some grand conspiracy that led to the ominous faces of a few men at the top.  
  
¬† Gordy appeared to be staring at the faces. He was pale and emaciated and had obviously lost a lot of weight, something Mark and Todd had not noticed two weeks earlier during final exams. He was an athlete who loved the gym, but the toned muscles were gone. His thick blond hair, the source of immense vanity, was stringy and had not been washed in days. Sizing him up, and taking in the condition of his apartment, they knew instantly that their friend had gone over the edge. They were in the presence of a manic artist, secluded and deranged and hard at work on an enormous canvas.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs the occasion?‚Äù Gordy asked as he turned and glared at them. His eyes were sunken, his cheeks hollow, his beard a week old.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúWe need to talk,‚Äù Mark said.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúYes we do,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúBut I‚Äôm doing  
the talking because I have a lot to say. I‚Äôve got it all figured out now. I‚Äôve caught the bastards and we have to move fast.‚Äù  
  
¬† Tentatively, Todd said, ‚ÄúOkay, Gordy. We‚Äôre here to listen. What‚Äôs up?‚Äù  
  
¬† Gordy pointed to the sofa and calmly said, ‚ÄúPlease have a seat.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúI‚Äôd rather stand, Gordy, if that‚Äôs okay,‚Äù Mark said.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúNo!‚Äù he barked. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not okay. Just do as I say and we‚Äôll be fine. Now sit down.‚Äù He was snarling, suddenly angry, and seemed ready to throw a punch. Neither Mark nor Todd would last ten seconds in a fistfight with Gordy. They had seen two in their law school days, both quick knockouts in bars with Gordy still on his feet.  
  
¬† Todd and Zola sat on the sofa and Mark pulled a stool over from the snack bar. They stared at the wall in disbelief. It was a maze of flowcharts with arrows jutting in all directions and linking together dozens of companies, firms, names, and numbers. Like schoolchildren who‚Äôd just been admonished, they sat, waited, and absorbed the wall.  
  
¬† Gordy stepped to the dining table, where a half-empty fifth of tequila was in the works. He poured some into his favorite coffee cup and sipped it as if having tea.

I'm looking to upgrade my Nespresso since it died after using it for just a year. I have decided to go with Breville and either the Bambino or Bambino Plus. This will be my first actual espresso machine and I'm excited to get into the hobby!

Here's a couple of my thoughts that keep me going back and forth:

\- Might be stupid, but I do love that I can choose a color for the Plus.

\- I already have a milk frother (Aeroccino3 from Nespresso). 95% of the time, I drink cold coffee, so I do like having a milk frother that does cold AND hot. So does that defeat the purpose of the Plus?

\- I was reading something about the Plus using a 3-hole system? Does that really make that much difference besides less watery pucks and no dripping? Does it affect the taste?

\- I also plan on getting the DF54 grinder to go with whatever machine I get.

About what I normally drink to further help decide... I drink mostly iced lattes with the exception of the rare cold day down here in Florida. 

TIA for any input! I'm so excited to dive into this hobby and hopefully stop spending hundreds a month on coffee from my local coffee shop. ",2,1752859288.0,BrevilleCoffee,2,1.0,False

1m389zy,https://www.reddit.com/r/HomeHive/comments/1m389zy/how_long_do_keurig_coffee_makers_last/,How long do Keurig coffee makers last?,"After using various Keurig coffee makers for over 8 years, I've learned quite a bit about their lifespan and durability. I'm sharing my experience to help you understand what to expect from these popular single-serve coffee machines.

Generally, a Keurig coffee maker lasts between 3-5 years with regular use. However, I've seen some units keep brewing perfectly fine even after 7 years. It really comes down to how well you maintain your machine and how often you use it.

I recently replaced my old Keurig with a newer model (you can check out the latest Keurig models here: https://explorehomedeals.com/Keurig-coffee-makers), and I noticed significant improvements in brewing technology and durability compared to my previous machine.

Here are the main factors that affect a Keurig's lifespan:

1. Maintenance
Regular descaling is crucial. I descale mine every 3-4 months using white vinegar or Keurig's descaling solution. This prevents mineral buildup and keeps the machine running smoothly.

2. Water Quality
Using filtered water makes a huge difference. Hard water can cause faster mineral buildup and potentially reduce your machine's lifespan.

3. Usage Frequency
Daily users might need to replace their machines sooner than occasional users. My first Keurig lasted 4 years with 6-8 cups daily use.

4. Model Type
Higher-end models tend to last longer. They're built with better components and often have better warranties. You can compare different models here: https://explorehomedeals.com/Keurig-coffee-makers

Common Signs It's Time to Replace Your Keurig:
- Inconsistent brewing amounts
- Unusual noises during operation
- Frequent pump failures
- Water leakage
- Significantly longer brewing times

Tips to Extend Your Keurig's Life:
- Clean the needle regularly
- Run water-only cycles between drinks
- Empty the water reservoir daily
- Use the auto-off feature
- Clean the exterior regularly

I've found that treating these machines right really pays off in the long run. While some people report issues earlier, my experience shows that with proper care, you can expect several years of reliable service from a Keurig coffee maker.

If you're noticing any issues with your current machine, it might be time for an upgrade. The newer models have improved significantly in terms of durability and features. They're also more energy-efficient and have better temperature control.

Understanding your machine's lifespan helps you make informed decisions about maintenance and replacement timing. A well-maintained Keurig can be a reliable morning companion for years to come.",1,1752859197.0,HomeHive,0,1.0,False

I have no fear of depths and a great fear of shallow living.‚Äù","*Human beings are beautiful creatures of Allah, with nuances, flaws, love in their hearts, and hope in their eyes; they are not something that can be covered in a checklist. So, this work is in defiance of this culture where humans measure each other by the most superficial of things. This is mostly just an invitation into my internal world, the external world well, let me know what you need to know.*

>**ON BIRTH**

I am 28, born on Christmas, a Muslim by birth. The irony laughs in my face. I let it. They/We call us arain, I don't know what it means, maybe just another label humans chose for themselves to distinguish themselves or to categorize our absurdities, intricacies, and shortcomings. I was born in a village in 1996. I don't remember my birth. I sometimes do imagine the pain my mother went through bringing me into this world. A body splits open in the most selfless of ways to give way for life to another body.

I don't know where to start or if the words would be enough for me to convey to somebody ""WHO AM I"". There is a certain fear in it that no matter how much I know about you or you know about me, you are the ""OTHER"", something distinct from ""ME"". This terrifies me; it gives me liberty to be myself, but at the same time reminds me of the unreachble distance that is always there between the ""SELF"" and the ""OTHER"".

>**What do I look like?**

A 5\`4\`\` biological male. Hairs unkempt, some white, some brown, and mostly black. I try to cover the white with the hair color almost every two months. The most futile of activities. Purposeless. I have thick hair. Two eyes, the eyelashes above the eye are thick, as is typical for south-asian genes. Dark circles underneath the eyes. A wide nose that rests between the symmetrical halves of my face. I trim every week. The teeth are just normal. One protrudes further than the others, hangs out of balance, grows out of place, revolting against the symmetry of the rest. Two ears with earlobes hanging. Soft mostly. A skin color that would be called brownish. I am not good with colors, though. It is funny how color doesn't exist as an entity and is just the reflection of light back to the eye. So, sometimes, when the light around me is white, maybe that reflection is less brown. But I am brown. They tell me.

I am told the face matters the most. Rest is what the human body looks like. Two arms, two legs, a stomach, a beating heart, a brain, some chemicals, and on top of it all, I am given a soul. I missed some as well, but I am not a doctor and cannot count all the organs, bones, muscles, veins, and the strata in there. But, I am told it is there. I don't doubt it. But what if one thing was missing? Will that imply that I am a human less than other humans? What makes me a human, essentially?

The total weight of the flesh sits at 64 kg with a vertical height of 5\`3\`\`. My temperature at the moment is close to 99 ¬∞C. Blood Pressure seems normal. If you need any other vitals from me, you can ask me.

>**ON EDUCATION**

Well, went to school to learn things. Stood in assembly, and sang ""Pak Sarzameen"" every day, and marched in a band. Foucault once posed that school is meant to discipline us or to hold us captive or keep us in line, so our educational institutions resemble the architecture of a prison. Almost a barracks-like structure. Categorized, labeled. School bells mimicking the alarm bells of a prison. Ideology keeps the veil over the eyes.

Went to college, it was the same.

I found it boring mostly. Then uni...blah blah blah

At the end of this journey of education, I have 3 or 4 pieces of paper.

The last one read ""Bachelor in Mech Engineering"".

Useless. Piece of junk.

>**On Beauty and Physical Attraction**

**""Do I love you because you are beautiful, or do I find you beautiful because I love you?""**

I have always had this question in my head, and I have never been able to come up with a satisfactory answer. I have always liked beauty that flirts closely with ugliness. Some faces that only look good in a certain light, or from a certain angle, or in front of a certain mirror. There is something in the crooked face that is inviting. Classical beauty has sort of a certain authoritarian tedium about it, and it demands some sort of reverence from me.¬†¬†It asks me to shrink myself, and it makes me uneasy, almost queezy, or if you have ever felt the sink in your stomach when you go on a merry-go-round.

While the acne scars, the crooked teeth, and the extra fat invite me to look at them. The idea of Platonic beauty doesn't sit right with me, and I cannot agree that there are certain proportions of the face or the body that make it beautiful. We are deeply flawed organisms, and there is a certain comfort and trust if your flaws are superficial on the surface, like the gap of two teeth rather than the flaw of the soul, because we are ugly, and it ought to show one way or the other. Do you take the surface flaw or do you take the flaw of the soul? Well, one could have both, too, I suppose, but ...

If I am to believe Kant and that beauty is subjective, then what is subjective is what isn't permanent. What happens if whatever is in the eyes of the beholder goes away and withers? Then, do the acne scars need some moisturizer or some acne cream now, or is now the time to get some liposuction for the extra fat? It is a scary thought again...hence, to console my heart, I go back to believing: ""I find you beautiful because I love you"". In this way, I have a choice. If I can choose to love you, then no matter how ugly we both become, we can find each other beautiful.

>**On Daily Life**

I got up today and went to get a coffee. Now, in the line to get my order in, next to me is a couple placing their order in. Just unaware of the people standing behind them in a line patiently waiting for their turn. My anxiety was kicking in, and I was trying to ground myself by flexing the back of my leg muscle to the tune of the music, which was not that audible, and I could barely make the lyrics in my head. At times, looking away at the window behind the tree line, listening to what the couple is talking about. At this point, I can choose to think about two things.

1- Could you both just get your order in, you imbeciles, inconsiderate A, Holes instead of wasting everybody's time.

2- The husband looks tired, and there is a certain sadness in his face. There is something beneath the surface he probably wants to say to her, but cannot bring himself to say it, maybe. The wife, with a dark lipstick on her, looks weary as well, and they both probably have a lot going on in their life. Maybe their kid kept them up all night, or maybe they are trying to have a child and Allah hasn't willed it yet.

Anyhow, I get my order in, and now I am in line to the side where they bring your order. I am watching the person making the coffee, taking other orders before me, and he is awfully terrible at this. His hands fumbling, the girl boss next to her also criticizing him, ""Side p hojao tum, main kar leti hun"". He gets the orders before me and the uncle, who is with a person, I cannot make out whether it's his wife or his daughter, comes to pick up the order. I still haven't gotten my order yet. The black box printer thing that prints the orders out, my order is still stuck in there. I haven't said anything, and he doesn't even know about my order yet. At this time, I can choose to think about two things:

1- You d\*\*\*wad, can you just do your job and bring my order, and can you be a little bit faster at this, man, come on! It ain't that hard. You just have to mix some coffee and milk.

2- The guy looks shy, and his posture tells me there is something that weighs on him. I don't know what it is; I cannot quite make it. This posture is often associated with a shame-based personal self; I see myself in him. I don't know what the house he lives in, how far he has come from, how insecure he feels in the presence of people like me, and how much he shrinks himself down not to offend anybody around, especially the customers who look influential, certain, confident, and as if they have life figured out.

I now take my order and sit at the table. Next to me is a maybe 20-year-oldish kid drawing something in his drawing book. I cannot quite make the shape, but he looks as if he has lost something. I don't know what it is. To quote ""I want to know"".

Everything in my own immediate experience, the ""BEING"" that is in front of me, makes me want to believe that I am the center of the universe. That is my innate learned setting. That the ""OTHER's""existence is only possible in a relation to ME. My car, my pants, the Keys in my pants' pockets, this apple on MY desk, MY Apple, the Neighbor outside coughing loudly, disturbing ME, what is under ME, what is next to ME, left to ME, right to ME, in front of ME, MY tv, MY remote. It ain't honey. I am not the center of the universe. But that is our default setting to be self-centered, to imagine ourselves as being the center of the universe, to see and interpret things through this lens of self.

The only way for me to revolt against this default innate self is to choose to sacrifice myself in a myriad of pithy, unimaginitive, unsexy ways, often in thought, sometimes in action.

I aspire to think the 2nd way of the examples I gave. It requires a very conscious effort, and sometimes, if the default has kicked in, then it takes me a second to interrupt myself in the middle of the thought and to pull myself back out of the default roadway, and some days, some days are just harder, and I lose faith in humanity some days. Those are the days when the weight of consciousness feels heavier. Those are the days when the pillow gets wet.

>**On Possessions**

1- I had a bike when I was 5. My friend had a better bike. I wanted his bike.

2- I grew up, and my dad had a motorbike. A rusty old piece. My friend's dad had a better bike. I wanted him to have a better motorbike.

3- My dad got a car. An old piece of junk. My friend's dad had a better car. I wanted my dad to have a better car.

4- I got a car. This is made by a company called ""Kia"". The name, if read in Urdu, begs the question itself.

It is made up of Aluminium, Iron, Plastic, or some variation of these materials. There are 4 tires; sometimes they look dirty, sometimes they look clean. There are 6 windows in the car. The leather inside doesn't look too flashy.

Now, when I drive past something bigger, my mind sometimes hisses again, ""This is not enough. Get that one.""

It‚Äôs a box. A metallic box with four rotating cylinders. At the front, there is what you call an IC engine. Every time you hit the speed pedal, you're igniting fuel to push pistons up and down, which rotate a crankshaft, which spins axles, which turn wheels. There are wires. They carry signals talking to integrated circuits that run different functions, such as a beeping light, the beeping sound, or the indicator's ""tik tik"".

If you step back far enough, it's hilarious how much of our identity we pour into a moving ""Lohay Ka Dabba"".

It is just a ""**THING**"", in a sea of ""**THINGS**"". It doesn't have anything that can fill the hollow of life itself. It exists to serve me or to provide me 1 hour of comfort at max. from heat/cold every day. Nothing more, nothing less.

I don't want a better car now. This is enough.

Whatever you worship is what will eat you alive. You worship stuff, you will feel like you never have enough.

>**ON ISLAM**

I was born a Muslim.

Before being a complete adult, I was introduced to Absurdism. Ah!!! Nice idea, I thought. The world of pain and suffering didn't make sense in the context of a just God to a 16-year-old. So, maybe it all is just ....meh. Just absurd. Just a futile exercise.

Then came the period of my life, where I got introduced to the *New Athiest* movement. The likes of Sam Harris, Richard Dawkins, and Christopher Hitchens. The new atheist movement carried with it an extreme whiff of orientalism, a racist caricature of the East, and a very narrow world view. I am still mad at Hitchens for supporting the Iraq War. Yes, don't kill in the name of Allah, but please bomb the shit out of this country in the name of Western-skewed democratic ideals fueled by capitalistic frenzy.

In all my life, I have searched for meaning and peace. But choosing to believe in a universe that is Godless was just painful for me. I cannot make sense of my pain and the sufferings of others. It must mean something. It ought to. The part of my life where I chose not to believe in Allah, all it gave me was catastrophic fatalism, debilitating anxiety, and just doom.

Now, I have been back, and my creator OPENED THY ARMS and took me back in.

I want to write more on this, but I realize people can find conversations around religion offensive, and I don't want to cause unnecessary hurt to anybody. But, just wanted to be honest and say, I have completed the full circle. It feels good to be back home.

Being able to learn different viewpoints and to critically question myself has only increased the intensity of my ""Imaan"". There is no question that I consider blasphemous. My Rab gave me the faculty to think, to feel, and I use it any chance I get.

May Allah forgive us all.

*Footnotes*  
1-  I have left some things which I suppose, in the pragmatic sense of things, are important to talk about. But, they are nominal values, as in nothing out of the ordinary, and hence, not worth mentioning in the end. Like, the money I earn. It is enough to sustain our family with life being a 6, maybe on the scale of comfort of 1-10, but my scaling is based on what I have experienced through my senses. I choose not to worry more than this about it.  
2- I have mostly talked about who I am. I don't know who you are. If I could sculpt somebody, I would sculpt you the way I want to. But see, it doesn't work like this. So, if you don't flich away from what you see, then we could be it maybe. Isn't that the most basic of human needs? For somebody to take a look at us and say, ""You are okay as you are.""  
3- I want to write so much more, to tell you who I am. But, I feel like I must think highly of myself if I think somebody is going to waste this much of their time to read about me. So, I have left some things unfinished where I wanted to say more but couldn't out of ease, out of necessity, out of guilt. Maybe agar zindagi rahi, I will finish these words.  
4- I am very bad at multitasking. So, very hard for me to communicate with somebody if I am doing something else too. If you do decide to reach out, can you please also give me a 2-hour time slot, during which we can talk about things to see if something clicks. I want to be mindful of both of our time. It is precious.

I've been doing this for the last 4 years before getting laid off a few months ago.

Before the layoff, I realized that being a developer just isn't for me. I like it and I'm good at it, but the working style just doesn't suit my personality. With a marketing background, I tried to pivot into applying for Product Management or Sales Engineer positions, but didn't get any responses.

I recently got coffee with a friend I've worked with throughout the years who is currently running a small company as a corporate spinoff. It's a tiny company operating as a startup, but they already have branding and customers since it's a spinoff. He asked if I was interested in doing product marketing for them as they currently have no one for it, and I took him up on his offer and have been working for them for about a month. 

I never saw myself returning to marketing, but i'm finding that being in this position reignited a passion for my career that hasn't existed in a long time. I could see myself continuing down this path in product marketing for the rest of my career.

However, I'm also looking toward the future and thinking about how future employers will see my job history and whether or not that will hurt me.

We made a rather large Grind pod order because our weakness is hazelnut pods and they had good reviews for theirs compared to others. 

I make a sort of makeshift Americano for my husband first - two pods drawn as lingo, followed by a podless shot of hot water. Invariably, the first pod of my coffee which I make next, fails. It starts with the coffee failing to flow, maybe a tiny trickle, and the machine stopping trying to draw water through it. When I go to clear the pod out, the lever resists and feels stuck at first. It always happens on the 3rd pod (first pod drawn after podless hot water). I‚Äôve tried wafting the steam out and waggling the handle back and forth a bit before putting that pod in, which sometimes is successful but the 4th pod may fail then. 

My guess is this is something to do with the bamboo material of the pods themselves? Either that or there‚Äôs some sort of buildup in the front of the machine/nozzle?

His face settles into the crook of my elbow as he tugs far more than his share of the bedclothes to his side without waking. His hair stinks of cigars and his breath is rancid, though judging by the taste rolling around the back of my throat‚Äîa virulent tincture of baptized gin and a stranger‚Äôs perfume‚Äîmine‚Äôs worse.  
  
¬† From the other side of the room, there‚Äôs the snap of drapes being pulled back, and sunlight assaults me. I throw my hands over my face. Percy flails awake with a caw like a raven‚Äôs. He tries to roll over, finds me in his path, keeps rolling anyway, and ends up on top of me. My bladder protests soundly to this. We must have drunk an extraordinary amount last night if it‚Äôs hanging this heavily over me. And here I was starting to feel rather smug about my ability to get foxed out of my mind most nights and then be a functioning human by the next afternoon, provided that the afternoon in question is a late one.  
  
¬† Which is when I realize why I am both utterly wrecked and still a little drunk‚Äîit isn‚Äôt the afternoon, when I‚Äôm accustomed to rising. It‚Äôs quite early in the morning, because Percy and I are leaving for the Continent today.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúGood morning, gentlemen,‚Äù Sinclair says from the other side of the room. I can only make out his silhouette against the window‚Äîhe‚Äôs still torturing us with the goddamned sunlight. ‚ÄúMy lord,‚Äù he continues, with a brow inclined in my direction, ‚Äúyour mother sent me to wake you. Your carriage is scheduled to leave within the hour, and Mr. Powell and his wife are taking tea in the dining room.‚Äù  
  
¬† From somewhere near my navel, Percy makes an affirming noise in response to his uncle and aunt‚Äôs presence‚Äîa noise that resembles no human language.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúAnd your father arrived from London last night, my lord,‚Äù Sinclair adds to me. ‚ÄúHe wishes to see you before you depart.‚Äù  
  
¬† Neither Percy nor I move. The lone shoe still clinging to my foot surrenders and hits the floor with a hollow thunk of wooden heel on Oriental carpet.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúShould I give you both a moment to recover your senses?‚Äù Sinclair asks.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúYes,‚Äù Percy and I say in unison.  
  
¬† Sinclair leaves‚ÄîI hear the door latch behind him. Outside the window, I can hear carriage wheels crackling against the gravel drive and the calls of the grooms as they yoke the horses.  
  
¬† Then Percy lets out a grisly moan and I start to laugh for no reason.  
  
¬† He takes a swipe at me and misses. ‚ÄúWhat?‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúYou sound like a bear.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúWell, you smell like a barroom floor.‚Äù He slides headfirst off the bed, gets tangled in the sheets, and ends up doing a sort of bent-waist headstand with his cheek against the carpeting. His foot rams me in the stomach, a little too low for comfort, and my laugh turns into a grunt. ‚ÄúSteady on, there, darling.‚Äù  
  
¬† The urge to relieve myself is too strong to ignore any longer, and I drag myself up with one hand on the hangings. A few of the stays pop. Bending down to find the chamber pot under the bed seems likely to result in my demise, or at least a premature emptying of my bladder, so I throw open the French doors and piss into the hedges instead.  
  
¬† When I turn back, Percy‚Äôs still on the floor, upside down with his feet propped on the bed. His hair came undone from its ribboned queue while we slept and it edges his face in a wild black cloud. I pour a glass of sherry from the decanter on the sideboard and down it in two swallows. Hardly any flavor manages to kick its way through the taste of whatever crawled into my mouth and died during the night, but the hum will get me through a send-off with my parents. And days in a carriage with Felicity. Lord, give me strength.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúHow did we get home last night?‚Äù Percy asks.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúWhere were we last night? It‚Äôs all a bit woolly after the third hand of piquet.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúI think you won that hand.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not entirely certain I was playing that hand. If we‚Äôre being honest, I had a few drinks.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúAnd if we‚Äôre truly being honest, it wasn‚Äôt just a few.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúI wasn‚Äôt that drunk, was I?‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúMonty. You tried to take your stockings off over your shoes.‚Äù  
  
¬† I scoop a handful of water from the basin Sinclair left, toss it across my face, then slap myself a few times‚Äîa feeble attempt to rally for the day. There‚Äôs a flump behind me as Percy rolls the rest of the way onto the rug.  
  
¬† I wrangle my waistcoat off over my head and drop it onto the floor. From his back, Percy points at my stomach. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôve something peculiar down there.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúWhat?‚Äù I look down. There‚Äôs a smear of bright red rouge below my navel. ‚ÄúLook at that.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúHow do you suppose that got there?‚Äù Percy asks with a smirk as I spit on my hand and scrub at it.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúA gentleman doesn‚Äôt tell.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúWas it a gentleman?‚Äù  
  
¬†  
; ‚ÄúSwear to God, Perce, if I remembered, I‚Äôd tell you.‚Äù I take another swallow of sherry straight out of the decanter and set it down on the sideboard, nearly missing. It lands a little harder than I meant. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a burden, you know.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúWhat is?‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúBeing this good-looking. Not a soul can keep their hands off me.‚Äù  
  
¬† He laughs, closemouthed. ‚ÄúPoor Monty, such a cross.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúCross? What cross?‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúEveryone falls in immediate, passionate love with you.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúThey can hardly be blamed. I‚Äôd fall in love with me, if I met me.‚Äù And then I flash him a smile that is equal parts rapscallion and boyish dimples so deep you could pour tea into them.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúAs modest as you are handsome.‚Äù He arches his back‚Äîan exaggerated stretch with his head pressed into the rug and fingers woven together above him. Percy‚Äôs showy about so few things, but he‚Äôs a damned opera in the mornings. ‚ÄúAre you ready for today?‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúI suppose? I haven‚Äôt much been involved in the planning, my father‚Äôs done it all. And if everything wasn‚Äôt prepared, he wouldn‚Äôt be sending us off.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúHas Felicity stopped screaming about school?‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt have a notion where Felicity‚Äôs mind‚Äôs at. I still don‚Äôt see why we have to take her along.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúOnly as far as Marseilles.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúAfter two goddamned months in Paris.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúYou‚Äôll survive one more summer with your sister.‚Äù  
  
¬† Above us, the baby kicks up his crying‚Äîthe floorboards aren‚Äôt near enough to stifle it‚Äîfollowed by the sound of the nursemaid‚Äôs heels as she dashes to his call, a clack like horses‚Äô hooves on cobbles.  
  
¬† Percy and I both flick our eyes to the ceiling.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúThe Goblin‚Äôs awake,‚Äù I say lightly. Muted as it is, his wailing stokes the ache pulsing in my head.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúTry not to sound too happy about his existence.‚Äù  
  
¬† I‚Äôve seen very little of my baby brother since he arrived three months previous, just enough to marvel at, firstly, how strange and shriveled he looks, like a tomato that‚Äôs been left out in the sun for the summer, and, secondly, how someone so tiny has such huge potential to ruin my entire bloody life.  
  
¬† I suck a drop of sherry from my thumb. ‚ÄúWhat a menace he is.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúHe can‚Äôt be that much of a menace, he‚Äôs only about this big.‚Äù Percy holds his hands up in demonstration.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúHe shows up out of nowhere‚Äî‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúNot sure you can claim out of nowhere‚Äî‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚Äú‚Äîand then cries all the while and wakes us and takes up space.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúThe nerve.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre not being very sympathetic.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre not giving me many reasons to be.‚Äù  
  
¬† I throw a pillow at him, which he‚Äôs still too sleepy to bat away in time, so it hits him straight in the face. He gives it a halfhearted toss back at me as I flop across the bed, lying on my stomach with my head hanging over the edge and my face above his.  
  
¬† He raises his eyebrows. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs a very serious face. Are you making plans to sell the Goblin off to a roving troupe of players in hopes they‚Äôll raise him as one of their own? You failed with Felicity, but the second time might be the charm.‚Äù  
  
¬† In truth, I am thinking how this tousle-haired, bit-off-his-guard, morning-after Percy is my absolute favorite Percy. I am thinking that if Percy and I have this last junket together on the Continent, I intend to fill it with as many mornings like this as possible. I am thinking how I am going to spend the next year ignoring the fact that there will be any year beyond it‚ÄîI will get wildly drunk whenever possible, dally with pretty girls who have foreign accents, and wake up beside Percy, savoring the pleasant kick of my heartbeat whenever I‚Äôm near him.  
  
¬† I reach down and touch his lips with my ring finger. I think about winking as well, which is, admittedly, a tad excessive, but I‚Äôve always been of the mind that subtlety is a waste of time. Fortune favors the flirtatious.  
  
¬† And by now, if Percy doesn‚Äôt know how I feel, it‚Äôs his own damn fault for being thick.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúI am thinking that today we are leaving on our Grand Tour,‚Äù I reply, ‚Äúand I‚Äôm not going to waste any of it.‚Äù  
  
¬† 2  
  
¬† Breakfast is laid out in the dining room when we arrive and the staff have already made themselves scarce. The French doors are flung wide so the hazy morning sunshine flutters in across the veranda, curtains billowing inward when the wind catches them. The gold inlay along the scrollwork glows dewy and warm in the light.  
  
¬† Mother looks like she‚Äôs already been up for hours, in a blue Jesuit with her lovely dark hair swept back in a neat chignon. I ruffle my fingers through mine, trying to work it into that deliberately rumpled look I usually favor, handsome in the it looked like this when I woke sort of way. Across the table from her, Percy‚Äôs aunt and uncle are straight-faced and unspeaking. There‚Äôs food enough for a militia spread before the three of them, but Mother‚Äôs poking at a single boiled egg in a delftware cup‚Äîshe‚Äôs been making a valiant effort to reclaim her figure since the Goblin wreaked havoc upon it‚Äîand neither of Percy‚Äôs guardians is having more than coffee. Percy and I are unlikely to make any noticeable impact either‚Äîmy stomach‚Äôs still precarious, and Percy‚Äôs finicky about food. He stopped eating meat a year ago, like some sort of extended Lent, claiming it‚Äôs for his health, but he‚Äôs still sick in bed far more often than I am. It‚Äôs hard to be sympathetic when I‚Äôve told him ever since he adopted it that unless he gives me a better explanation, I think his diet is absurd.  
  
¬† Percy‚Äôs aunt reaches out when we enter, and he takes her hand. They have the same soft features‚Äîthin nosed and fine boned‚Äîas Percy‚Äôs father has in portraits, though Percy‚Äôs got thick black hair that grows in coarse curls and defies wigs, queues, and anything fashionable. Percy‚Äôs lived with his aunt and uncle all his life, ever since his father returned from the family estate in Barbados with a jungle fever, his French violin, and an infant son with skin the color of sandalwood, then expired. Lucky for Percy, his aunt and uncle took him in. Lucky for me as well, or else we might never have met, and then what would have been the point of my life?  
  
¬† My mother looks up as we enter and smooths the wrinkles around the corners of her eyes like they‚Äôre creases in a tablecloth. ‚ÄúAnd the gentlemen arise.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúGood morning, Mother.‚Äù  
  
¬† Percy gives her a little bow before he sits, like he‚Äôs a proper guest. It‚Äôs a ridiculous pretense from a lad I know better than either of my actual siblings. And also like a fair amount more.  
  
¬† The actual sibling present doesn‚Äôt acknowledge our arrival. She has one of her amatory novels propped against a crystal jam pot, a serving fork wedged between the pages to hold it open. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôll melt your brain, Felicity,‚Äù I say as I drop into the seat beside her.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúNot as fast as gin will,‚Äù she replies without looking up.  
  
¬† My father‚Äîthank God‚Äîis absent.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúFelicity,‚Äù my mother hisses down to her. ‚ÄúPerhaps you should remove your spectacles at the table.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúI need them for reading,‚Äù Felicity says, eyes still fixed upon her smut.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúYou shouldn‚Äôt be reading at all. We have guests.‚Äù  
  
¬† Felicity licks her finger and turns the page. Mother glowers down at the cutlery. I help myself to a piece of toast from a silver rack and settle in to watch them volley. It‚Äôs always pleasant when it‚Äôs Felicity being needled instead of me.  
  
¬† Mother glances across the table at Percy‚Äîhis aunt is plucking at the rather distinct cigar burn on the braided cuff of his coat‚Äîthen says to me in a confidential tone, ‚ÄúOne of my maids found a pair of your breeches in the harpsichord this morning. I believe they were the same ones you left the house in last night.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs . . . odd,‚Äù I say‚ÄîI thought I‚Äôd lost them long before we got home. I have a sudden memory of stripping off my clothes as Percy and I staggered through the parlor in the wee dawn hours, scattering them behind me like fallen trees. ‚ÄúDidn‚Äôt happen to find a shoe as well, did she?‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúDid you want them packed?  
‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sure I‚Äôve plenty.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúI wish you had at least looked through what was sent.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúWhat for? I can send for anything I‚Äôve left behind, and we‚Äôll be getting new duds in Paris.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúIt makes me anxious to think of sending your fine things to some unknown French flat with a strange staff.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúFather arranged the flat, and the staff. Take it up with him if you‚Äôre skittish.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúI‚Äôm skittish about you two boys on your own on the Continent for a year.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúWell, you should have raised that concern a bit earlier than the day we leave.‚Äù  
  
¬† My mother purses her lips and goes back to poking at her egg.  
  
¬† Like a summoned demon, my father appears suddenly in the doorway to the dining room. My pulse rocks, and I tuck into my toast, like food might disguise me as his gaze roams the table. His golden hair is slicked back into a tidy queue, the way mine might have a prayer of looking if it didn‚Äôt spend most of its life getting raked through by the fingers of interested parties.  
  
¬† I can tell he‚Äôs come for me, but he casts his attention first upon my mother, just long enough to kiss her on the top of the head, before it snags upon my sister. ‚ÄúFelicity, get those goddamn spectacles off your face.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúI need them for reading,‚Äù she replies without looking up.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúYou shouldn‚Äôt be reading at the breakfast table.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúFather‚Äî‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúRemove them at once or I‚Äôll snap them in half. Henry, I‚Äôd like a word.‚Äù  
  
¬† My Christian name from my father‚Äôs mouth jars me so badly I actually wince. We share that ghastly Henry, and every time he says it, there‚Äôs a bit of a grit-toothed grimace, like he deeply regrets my christening. I half expected him and Mother to call the Goblin ‚ÄúHenry‚Äù as well, in hopes of bequeathing the name to someone who still has a chance of proving worthy of it.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúWhy don‚Äôt you sit and have some breakfast with us?‚Äù Mother says. Father has his hands on her shoulders, and she places one of hers overtop, trying to drag him into the empty chair on her other side, but he pulls away.  
‚ÄúI need a private word with Henry.‚Äù He nods at Percy‚Äôs aunt and uncle with hardly a glance‚Äîproper salutations aren‚Äôt for lower members of the peerage.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúThe boys are leaving today,‚Äù Mother tries again.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúI know that. Why else would I wish to speak to Henry?‚Äù He lobs a frown in my direction. ‚ÄúNow, if you don‚Äôt mind.‚Äù  
  
¬† I toss my napkin onto the table and follow him from the room. As I pass Percy, he looks up at me and his mouth curls into a sympathetic smile. The faint freckles he‚Äôs got splattered below his eyes twist up. I give him an affectionate flick on the back of the head as I go by.  
  
¬† I follow my father into his sitting room. The windows are thrown open, lace drapes casting lattice shadows over the floor and the sickly perfume of spring blossoms dying on the vine blowing in from the yard. Father sits down at his desk and shuffles through the papers stacked there. For a moment, I think he‚Äôs going to start back in on his work and leave me to sit and stare at him like an imbecile. I take a calculated risk and reach for the brandy on the sideboard, but Father says, ‚ÄúHenry,‚Äù and I stop.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúYes, sir.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúDo you remember Mr. Lockwood?‚Äù  
  
¬† I look up and realize there‚Äôs a scholarly swell already standing beside the fire. He‚Äôs redheaded and ruddy cheeked, with a patchy beard decorating his chin. I had been so intent on my father, I‚Äôd failed to notice him.  
  
¬† Mr. Lockwood gives me a short bow, spectacles slipping down his nose. ‚ÄúMy lord. I‚Äôm sure we‚Äôll become better acquainted in the coming months, as we travel together.‚Äù  
  
¬† I‚Äôd like to throw up on his buckled shoes, but I refrain. I hadn‚Äôt wanted a bear-leader, primarily because I‚Äôm not interested in any of the scholarly things a bear-leader is meant to teach his charges. But a guardian presence of their selection had been one of my parents‚Äô conditions for my touring, and as I had very few chips to wager in that game, I had agreed.  
  
¬† Father laces the papers he was mucking with into a leather skin and extends it to Lockwood. ‚ÄúPreliminary documents. Passports, letters of credit, bills of health, introductions to my acquaintances in France.‚Äù Lockwood tucks the papers into his coat, and Father twists around to face me, one elbow resting on his desk. I slide my hands between my legs and the sofa.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúSit up straight,‚Äù he snaps. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre small enough without slumping.‚Äù  
  
¬† With more effort than it should take, I pull back my shoulders and look him in the eye. He frowns, and I nearly sink straight back down.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúWhat do you think I wish to speak about, Henry?‚Äù he says.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know, sir.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúWell, take a guess.‚Äù I look down, which I know is a mistake but I can‚Äôt help it. ‚ÄúLook at me when I‚Äôm speaking to you.‚Äù  
  
¬† I raise my eyes, staring at a spot over his head so I don‚Äôt have to look straight at him. ‚ÄúDid you want to discuss my Tour?‚Äù  
  
¬† He rolls his eyes, a short flick skyward that‚Äôs just long enough to make me feel like a bleeding simpleton, and my temper flares‚Äîwhy ask such an obvious question if he was just going to mock me when I answered?‚Äîbut I keep silent. A lecture is gathering in the air like a thunderstorm.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúI want to be certain you‚Äôre clear on the conditions of this Tour before you depart,‚Äù he says. ‚ÄúI still believe your mother and I are foolish to indulge you a single inch further than we already have since your expulsion from Eton. But, against my better judgment, I am giving you this one year to get ahold of yourself. Do you understand me?‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúYes, sir.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúMr. Lockwood and I have discussed what we think is the best course of action for your time abroad.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúCourse of action?‚Äù I repeat, looking between them. Up until this moment, I‚Äôd thought we all understood that this year was for Percy and me to do as we pleased, with a bear-leader along to arrange the annoying things like lodging and food and provide an obligatory parental eye that, like any good parental eye, would be frequently blind to youthful iniquities.  
  
¬† Mr. Lockwood clears his throat rather grandly, stepping into the light from the window, then back out at once, blinking the sun from his eyes. ‚ÄúYour father and I have discussed your situation and determined that you will be best served with some restraints placed upon your activities while on the Continent.‚Äù  
  
¬† I look between him and my father, like one of them will crack and confess this is a jest, because restraints were certainly not part of the understanding I came to with my parents when this Tour was first agreed upon.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúUnder my watch,‚Äù Lockwood says, ‚Äúthere will be no gambling, limited tobacco, and absolutely no cigars.‚Äù  
  
¬† Well, this is turning a bit not good.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúNo visitations to any dens of iniquity,‚Äù he goes on, ‚Äúor sordid establishments of any kind. No caterwauling, no inappropriate relations with the opposite sex. No fornication. No slothfulness, or excessive sleeping late.‚Äù  
  
¬† It‚Äôs beginning to feel like he‚Äôs shuffling his way through the seven deadly sins, in ascending order of my favorites.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúAnd,‚Äù he says, rust on the razor‚Äôs edge, ‚Äúspirits in moderation only.‚Äù  
  
¬† I‚Äôm ready to protest loudly to this until I catch my father‚Äôs hard stare. ‚ÄúAnd I defer entirely to Mr. Lockwood‚Äôs judgment,‚Äù he says. ‚ÄúWhile you travel, he speaks for me.‚Äù  
  
¬† Which is exactly the last thing I need accompanying me to the Continent‚Äîa surrogate of my father.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúWhen you and I next see each other,‚Äù he continues, ‚ÄúI expect you to be sober and stable and‚Äù‚Äîhe casts a look at Lockwood, like he‚Äôs unsure how to tactfully phrase this‚Äî‚Äúdiscreet, at the very least. Your ridiculous little cries for attention are to cease, and you‚Äôll begin working at my side on the management of the estate and the peerage.‚Äù  
  
¬† I would rather have my eyes gouged out with sucket forks and fed back to me, but it seems best not to tell him so.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúI have set your itinerary with your father,‚Äù Lockwood says, withdrawing a small pad from his pocket and consulting it with a squint. ‚ÄúWe begin in Paris for the summer‚Äî‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúI have some colleagues I‚Äôd like you to call on there,‚Äù Father interrupts. ‚ÄúAcquaintances it will be important for you to maintain once you‚Äôre over the estate. And I‚Äôve arranged for you to accompany our friend Lord Ambassador Robert Worthington and his wife to a ball at Versailles. You will not embarrass me.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúWhen have I ever embarrassed you?‚Äù I murmur.  
  
¬† As soon as I say it, I can feel us both riffle through our mental libraries for each incident in which I shamed my father. It‚Äôs an extensive catalogue. Neither of us says any of it aloud, though. Not with Mr. Lockwood here.  
  
¬† Lockwood chooses to take a clumsy hack through the awkward silence by pretending it doesn‚Äôt exist. ‚ÄúFrom Paris, we continue on to Marseilles, where we will deliver your sister, Miss Montague, for school. I have accommodation arranged as far as there. We will winter in Italy‚ÄîI have suggested Venice, Florence, and Rome, and your father concurs‚Äîthen either Geneva or Berlin, depending upon the snowfall in the Alps. On our return, we will collect your sister, and the two of you will be home for the summer. Mr. Newton will make his own way to Holland for school.‚Äù  
  
¬† The air in the room is hot, and it‚Äôs making me feel petulant. Or perhaps I‚Äôm entitled to a little petulance because this whole lecture seems a bit of a sour send-off and I‚Äôm still rather panicked over the fact that at the end of all this, Percy‚Äôs going to bloody law school in bloody Holland and I‚Äôm going to be properly apart from him for the first time in my life.  
  
¬† But then Father gives me a frostbitten look, and I drop my gaze. ‚ÄúFine.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúExcuse me?‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúYes, sir.‚Äù  
  
¬† Father stares hard at me, his hands folded before him. For a moment, none of us speaks. Outside on the drive, one of the footmen scolds a groom to step lively. A mare nickers.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúMr. Lockwood,‚Äù Father says, ‚Äúmay I have a moment alone with my son?‚Äù  
  
¬† As one, my muscles all clench in anticipation.  
  
¬† On his way to the door, Mr. Lockwood pauses at my side and gives me a short  
clap on the shoulder that‚Äôs so firm it makes me start. I was expecting a swing to come from entirely the opposite direction and be significantly less friendly. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre going to have an excellent time, my lord,‚Äù he says. ‚ÄúYou will hear poetry and symphonies and see the finest treasures the world has to offer. It will be a cultural experience that will shape the remainder of your life.‚Äù  
  
¬† Dear. Lord. Fortune has well and truly vomited down my front in the form of Mr. Lockwood.  
  
¬† As Lockwood closes the door, Father reaches toward me and I flinch, but he‚Äôs only going for the brandy on the sideboard, moving it out of my grasp. God, I‚Äôve got to get my head on straight.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúThis is the last chance I‚Äôm giving you, Henry,‚Äù he says, a bit of the old French accent peeping through, as it always does when his temper is rising. Those soft edges on his vowels are usually my first warning, and I almost put my hands up preemptively. ‚ÄúWhen you return home, we‚Äôll start in on the estate work. Together. You‚Äôll come to London with me and observe the duties of a lord there. And if you can‚Äôt return to us mature enough for that, then don‚Äôt come back at all. There‚Äôll be no place left for you in this family or any of our finances. You‚Äôll be out.‚Äù  
  
¬† Right on schedule, the disinheritance rears its ugly head. But after years of holding it over me‚Äîclean up, sober up, stop letting lads climb in through your bedroom window at night or else‚Äîfor the first time, we both know he means it. Because until a few months ago, if it wasn‚Äôt me who got the estate, he‚Äôd have had no one to pass it to that would keep it in the family.  
  
¬† Upstairs, the Goblin begins to wail.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúIndicate that you understand me, Henry,‚Äù Father snaps, and I force myself to meet his eyes again.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúYes, sir. I understand you.‚Äù  
  
¬† He lets loose a long sigh, paired with the thin-lipped disappointment of a man who‚Äôs just seen the unrecognizable results of a commissioned portrait of himself. ‚ÄúI hope you one day have a son that‚Äôs as much of a leech as you are. Now, you‚Äôve a coach waiting.‚Äù  
  
¬† I fly to my feet, ready to be rid of this sweltering room. But before I get far, he calls, ‚ÄúOne final thing.‚Äù I turn back with the hope we might speak from a distance, but he crooks a finger until I consent to return to his side. He casts a glance at the door, though Lockwood is long gone, then says to me in a low voice, ‚ÄúIf I catch even a whiff of you mucking around with boys, while you‚Äôre away or once you return, you‚Äôll be cut off. Permanently. No further conversation about it.‚Äù  
  
¬† And that is our farewell in its entirety.  
  
¬† Out of doors, the sun still feels like a personal affront. The air is steamy, a ferric storm beginning to conspire at the horizon. The hedges along our drive sparkle where the dew sits, leaves turned to the light and shivering when the wind runs through them. The gravel crunches as the horses paw at it, harnessed and anxious to depart.  
  
¬† Percy is already at the carriage, his back to the house, which allows me an unobserved moment of staring at his arse‚Äînot that it‚Äôs particularly noteworthy arse, but it‚Äôs Percy‚Äôs, which is what makes it very much worth the noting. He‚Äôs directing one of the porters loading the last of our luggage that wasn‚Äôt sent ahead. ‚ÄúI‚Äôll keep it with me,‚Äù he‚Äôs saying, his arms extended.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs room to stow it, sir.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúI know. I‚Äôd rather have it with me is all.‚Äù  
  
¬† The porter surrenders and hands Percy his fiddle case, the only relic left him by his father, which he cuddles like he was concerned they‚Äôd never see each other again.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúHave your aunt and uncle gone?‚Äù I call as I cross the drive toward him and he looks up from stroking his fiddle case.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúYes, we had a chaste farewell. What did your father want?‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúOh, the usual. Told me not to break too many hearts.‚Äù I rub my temples. A headache is building to a boil behind my eyes. ‚ÄúChrist, it‚Äôs bright. Are we off soon?‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs your mother and Felicity.‚Äù Percy nods in the direction of the front steps, where the pair of them are silhouetted against the white stone like they‚Äôre fashioned from cut paper. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôd best say good-bye.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúKiss for good luck?‚Äù  
  
¬† I lean in, but Percy puts the fiddle case between us with a laugh. ‚ÄúGood try, Monty.‚Äù  
  
¬† Hard not to let that pinch.  
  
¬† Felicity is looking sour and unattractive as usual, with her face scrunched up against the sun. She‚Äôs got the bridge specs tucked down the front of her Brunswick‚ÄîMother might not have noticed, but I can see the imprint of the chain through the fabric. Barely five and ten and she already looks like a spinster.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúPlease,‚Äù Mother is saying to her, though Felicity‚Äôs staring into the sun like she‚Äôs more interested in going blind than in taking maternal counsel. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt want letters from the school about you.‚Äù  
  
¬† The finishing school has been a long time coming, but Felicity is still so scowly about it you‚Äôd think she hadn‚Äôt spent all her born days proving to my parents that if one of their children needed civilizing, it was she. Contrary thing that she is, she‚Äôs begged for an education for years, and now that it‚Äôs finally handed to her, she‚Äôs dug in her heels like a stubborn mule.  
  
¬† Mother opens her arms. ‚ÄúFelicity, come kiss me good-bye.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúI‚Äôd rather not,‚Äù Felicity replies, and stalks down the steps toward the carriage.  
  
¬† My mother sighs through her nose, but lets her go. Then she turns to me. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôll write.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúOf course.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt drink too much.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúCould I get an absolute value on too much?‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúHenry,‚Äù she says, the same sigh behind her voice as when Felicity stormed away. The what are we to do with you? sort.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúRight. Yes. I won‚Äôt.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúTry to behave. And don‚Äôt torment Felicity.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúMother. I‚Äôm the victim. She torments me.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúShe‚Äôs fifteen.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúThe most vicious age.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúTry to be a gentleman, Henry. Just try.‚Äù She kisses me on the cheek, then gives my arm a pat like she might a dog. Her skirts rasp against the stone as she turns back into the house and I go the opposite way down the drive, one hand rising to shield my face from the sun.  
  
¬† I swing myself into the carriage, and the footman shuts the door behind me. Percy‚Äôs got his fiddle case balanced on his knees and he‚Äôs playing with the latches. Felicity‚Äôs scrunched up in one corner, like she‚Äôs trying to get as far from us as possible. She‚Äôs already reading.  
  
¬† I slide into the seat beside Percy and pull my pipe from my coat.  
  
¬† Felicity executes an eye roll that must give her a spectacular view of the inside of her skull. ‚ÄúPlease, brother, we haven‚Äôt even left the county, don‚Äôt smoke yet.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúNice to have you along, Felicity.‚Äù I clamp the pipe between my teeth and fish about in my pocket for the flint. ‚ÄúRemind me again where we‚Äôre permitted to drop you by the side of the road.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúKeen to make more room in the carriage for your harem of boys?‚Äù  
  
¬† I scowl, and she tucks back into her novel, looking a bit smugger than before.  
  
¬† The coach door opens, and Mr. Lockwood clambers up beside Felicity, knocking his head on the frame as he goes. She slinks a little farther into the corner.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúNow, gentlemen. Lady.‚Äù He polishes his spectacles on the tails of his coat, replaces them, and offers us what I think is meant to be a smile, but he‚Äôs so toothy the effect is a bit like that of an embarrassed shark. ‚ÄúI believe we‚Äôre ready to depart.‚Äù  
  
¬† There‚Äôs a whistle from the footman, then the axles creak as the coach gives a sudden lurch forward. Percy catches himself on my knee.  
  
¬† And like that, we are off.  
  
¬† 3  
  
¬† The great tragic love story of Percy and me is neither great nor truly a love story, and is tragic only for its single-sidedness. It is also not an epic monolith that has plagued me since boyhood, as might be expected. Rather, it is simply the tale of how two people can be important to each other their whole lives, and then, one morning, quite without meaning to, one of them wakes to find that i  
mportance has been magnified into a sudden and intense desire to put his tongue in the other‚Äôs mouth.  
  
¬† A long, slow slide, then a sudden impact.  
  
¬† Though the story of Percy and me‚Äîthe account sans love and tragedy‚Äîis forever. As far back as I can remember, Percy has been in my life. We‚Äôve ridden and hunted and sunbathed and reveled together since we were barely old enough to walk, fought and made up and run amok across the countryside. We‚Äôve shared all our firsts‚Äîfirst lost tooth, first broken bone, first school day, the first time we were ever sweet on a girl (though I have always been more vocal about and passionate in my infatuations than Percy). First time drunk, when we were reading at our parsonage‚Äôs Easter service but got foxed on nicked wine before. We were just sober enough to think we were subtle about it and just tipsy enough that we were likely as subtle as a symphony.  
  
¬† Even the first kiss I ever had, though disappointingly not with Percy, still involved him, in a roundabout way. I‚Äôd kissed Richard Peele at my father‚Äôs Christmas party the year I turned thirteen, and though I thought it was quite a fine kiss, as far as first ones go, he got cold feet about it and blabbed to his parents and the other Cheshire lads and everyone who would listen that I was perverted and had forced myself on him, which was untrue, for I would like it to be noted that I have never forced myself on anyone. (I‚Äôd also like it noted that every time since then that Richard Peele and I have had a shag, it‚Äôs always been at his volition. I am but a willing stander-by.) My father made me apologize to the Peeles, while he gave them the lots of boys mess around at that age speech‚Äîwhich he‚Äôs gotten a lot of use out of over the years, though the at that age part is becoming less and less relevant‚Äîthen, after they‚Äôd left, he hit me so hard my vision went spotty.  
  
¬† So I had walked around for weeks wearing an ugly bruise and mottled shame, with everyone eyeing me sideways and making spiteful remarks within my earshot, and I began to feel certain I had turned all my friends against me for something I couldn‚Äôt help. But the next time the boys played billiards in town, Percy bashed Richard in the side of the face with his cue so hard that he lost a tooth. Percy apologized, like it was an accident, but it was fairly transparent vengeance. Percy had avenged me when no one else would look me in the eyes.

The truth is that Percy has always been important to me, long before I fell so hard for him there was an audible crash. It‚Äôs only lately that his knee bumping mine under a narrow pub table leaves me fumbling for words. A small shift in the gravity between us and suddenly all my stars are out of alignment, planets knocked from their orbits, and I‚Äôm left stumbling, without map or heading, through the bewildering territory of being in love with your best friend.  
  
¬† If the whole of England were sinking into the sea and I had the only boat with a seat for a single person more, I‚Äôd save Percy. And if he‚Äôd already drowned, I probably wouldn‚Äôt save anyone. Probably there wouldn‚Äôt be much point in me going forward either. Though I would hang on because I‚Äôd likely wash up in France, and from what I remember from the summer my family spent there when Felicity and I were young, there are some lovely women in France. Some handsome boys as well, many of whom wear their breeches very tight, though I wasn‚Äôt clear where I stood on that when I was eleven.  
  
¬† As we sail across the Channel toward Calais, this is what I‚Äôm thinking of‚ÄîPercy and me and England sinking into the sea behind us, and also French lads and their tight breeches and, zounds, I can‚Äôt wait to get to Paris. I am also maybe a tiny bit drunk. I nicked a bottle of gin from a bar before we left Dover, and Percy and I have been passing it between us for the last hour. There are still a few swallows left.  
  
¬† I haven‚Äôt seen Felicity since we boarded the packet, nor much of Lockwood either‚Äîhe spent most of our time in Dover as we waited for a storm to pass fussing over luggage and customs and correspondence. Then, once the boat left the harbor, our bear-leader became occupied with being sick over the rail, and we became occupied with avoiding him, and those two activities were perfectly compatible.  
  
¬† Beyond the prow of the packet, the water and the sky are the same ghostly gray, but through the fog I can make out the first signs of the port winking at us‚Äîa link of golden lights gilding the invisible coastline like a chain. The waves are rough, and side by side, with our elbows upon the rail, Percy and I keep bumping shoulders. When we strike a rough patch and he nearly loses his footing, I seize the chance to grab him by the hand and haul him upright again. I have become a veritable scholar in seemingly innocent ploys to get his skin against mine.  
  
¬† It‚Äôs the first time we‚Äôve been properly alone together since Cheshire, and I‚Äôve spent the whole while filling him in on the tyrannical restraints placed upon us by Lockwood and my father. Percy listens with his fists stacked atop each other on the railing and his chin resting upon them. When I‚Äôm finished, he wordlessly hands me the gin bottle. I snatch it with the plan to drain it, only to find he‚Äôs beat me to it. ‚ÄúBastard.‚Äù He laughs, and I pitch the bottle into the gray water, where it bobs for a moment before the bow of the packet sucks it under. ‚ÄúHow is it that we‚Äôve landed the only bear-leader for hire who‚Äôs entirely opposed to the true purpose of the Tour?‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúWhich is . . . remind me.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúStrong spirits and loose women.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúSounds instead like it‚Äôs going to be weak wine with dinner and handling yourself in your bedroom after.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúNo shame in that. If the Good Lord didn‚Äôt want men to play with themselves, we‚Äôd have hooks for hands. Still, I‚Äôd rather not be keeping myself company from now until next September. God, this is going to be a disaster.‚Äù I look to him, hoping for some sort of despair that is at least on a comparable level with mine‚ÄîI thought we were all operating under the same understanding that this year was to be for Percy and me to do as we pleased before he goes to school and I load stones in my pockets and throw myself into the ocean‚Äîbut instead he‚Äôs looking aggravatingly pleased. ‚ÄúHold on, are you keen on all this cultural shite?‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not . . . not keen.‚Äù And then he gives me a smile that I think is supposed to be apologetic but instead looks very, very keen.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúNo, no, no, you have to be on my side about this! Lockwood is tyranny and oppression and all that! Don‚Äôt be seduced away by his promises of poetry and symphonies and‚ÄîDear Lord, am I to be subjected to music for the entirety of our Tour?‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúAbsolutely you will. And the only thing you will hate more than listening to Lockwood‚Äôs selected music will be listening to me talk about said music. Sometimes I‚Äôll talk to Lockwood about music and you will hate it. You‚Äôre going to have to listen to me and Lockwood using words like atonal and chromatic scale and cadenza.

## Key Features Analysis

The ideal personalized espresso cup combines aesthetic appeal with practical functionality. Several key features contribute to a superior espresso-drinking experience.

**Material Quality:** The material used in an espresso cup significantly affects its durability, heat retention, and overall feel. High-quality porcelain and ceramic are popular choices for their smooth texture, excellent heat retention, and resistance to chipping. Some manufacturers also offer double-walled glass options, which provide insulation and prevent condensation.

The best personalized espresso cups are made from lead-free and cadmium-free materials, ensuring they are safe for everyday use. The material should also be dishwasher and microwave safe for added convenience. Furthermore, the finish should be durable enough to withstand repeated washing without fading or scratching.

**Customization Options:** The level of customization offered is paramount for a truly personalized espresso cup. The best providers offer a wide range of options, including the ability to add text, monograms, photos, and custom designs.

The customization process should be user-friendly, with clear instructions and intuitive design tools. Some companies offer preview features that allow you to see exactly how your design will look on the cup before placing your order. The quality of the printing or engraving is also critical; the design should be sharp, vibrant, and long-lasting.

**Size and Shape:** Espresso cups come in various sizes and shapes, each affecting the taste and aroma of the espresso. A traditional espresso cup is typically small, holding around 2-3 ounces, which helps maintain the crema and temperature of the espresso.

The shape of the cup can also influence the drinking experience. Some cups have a wider mouth to allow for better aroma release, while others have a narrower opening to concentrate the flavors. The handle should be comfortable to hold and appropriately sized for the cup.

**Design Aesthetics:** The design of the espresso cup is a matter of personal preference, but the best personalized cups offer a balance of style and functionality. Clean lines, elegant curves, and minimalist designs are popular choices.

The color and finish of the cup can also enhance its aesthetic appeal. Matte finishes are often preferred for their modern look and feel, while glossy finishes provide a more classic and sophisticated appearance. The design should complement the espresso itself, creating a visually pleasing and enjoyable drinking experience.

**Durability and Longevity:** A high-quality personalized espresso cup should be durable enough to withstand daily use and last for years. The material should be resistant to chipping, cracking, and staining.

The customization should also be durable and resistant to fading or peeling. The best cups are made with high-quality printing or engraving techniques that ensure the design remains intact over time. Regular cleaning and proper care can also extend the lifespan of the cup.

Conversely, a more existentialist viewpoint might emphasize the role of these rituals in creating meaning and identity in‚Å£ a seemingly absurd world.

Not even sure about all these stuffs. My whole purpose of coming to penpal is that i dont have to do this but platform wants mt to write 500 words and i dont want to write everything here.

So just know that i am female person looking for strong friendship in another female person who lives across the world.

I feel it ll be magical.




I‚Äôm 31F, happily married, and from a place where the sun rises early, the chai is always brewing, and life moves somewhere between tradition and tech. I‚Äôve been thinking ‚Äî in a world of noise, pings, and infinite scrolls, how beautiful it would be to slow down‚Ä¶ and write. To truly write. Letters, thoughts, experiences ‚Äî shared with someone across the world who‚Äôs also living, learning, and unlearning.

So here I am, looking for a female penpal, preferably 27 or older, who also finds joy in connecting deeply ‚Äî not through likes or comments, but through real, intentional words.

I‚Äôm not looking for anything intense or structured. Just a gentle, ongoing exchange of life. We could talk about:
	‚Ä¢	Our daily routines ‚Äî what your mornings look like, how your coffee smells, or the one thing that makes your Mondays easier.
	‚Ä¢	Cultural quirks ‚Äî things that are totally normal to you but would make me say, ‚ÄúWait, what?‚Äù
	‚Ä¢	Books we love, music we can‚Äôt stop playing, shows that feel like comfort food.
	‚Ä¢	Little wins, big setbacks, the weirdness of growing up, and the joy of becoming softer, stronger women.
	‚Ä¢	Or simply what‚Äôs blooming in your garden or what cloud shape made you smile today.

I‚Äôm a very simple simple simple woman ‚Äî that‚Äôs the only way I know how to describe myself these days. I‚Äôve had a difficult past, but I‚Äôve done the work to grow from it. I‚Äôm still doing it, actually. I‚Äôve bloomed in places I didn‚Äôt think I could. I‚Äôve lost a lot, but gained peace. And I‚Äôve realized how powerful it is to keep learning, unlearning, and showing up for your own life.

I love deep conversations, slow mornings, beautiful silences, and feeling connected to someone without needing to explain everything. I love writing and reading ‚Äî not in the perfect grammar sense, but in the ‚Äúlet‚Äôs be human and feel things‚Äù sense.

If you‚Äôre someone who‚Äôs also trying to make the best out of life, someone who thinks the idea of bonding with another woman halfway across the globe is magical ‚Äî let‚Äôs do this.

Let‚Äôs remind ourselves that beyond algorithms, there are real people with real hearts. Let‚Äôs be penpals who hold space for each other in this chaotic, beautiful world.

üíå If this resonates with you, feel free to DM (female-identifying only please).

This time I'm baffled.

17.9g of the same coffee I used yesterday, so same amount, and same grind size (checked grinder to be sure). Water in chamber. I don't use the silicon puck and haven't for months, fwiw. Same heat I use daily, on my induction stovetop converter I've always used. Same pick tamper pressure because it's spring loaded to give a consistent press every time.

I don't set a timer these days because it's all dialed in, but based on milk temp that I heat on cooler edge of the same induction adapter plate, I can deduce i left the 9barista on the heat longer than I should have.

Steam blew out so vigorously and intensely that it blew the o ring partially out. 

Trying to think it through... The one thing different today is that I noticed the 9barista wasn't placed on the hot center of my induction plate and not at the highest temp (sometimes I use 7 or 8 instead of 9, to allow heating the other burner for cooking breakfast). I then moved it to center of heating plate as I noticed the milk was at frothing temp and already done (usually it finishes at same time as the coffee, more or less).

Perhaps I let it just be cool enough to get some water to pass the valve but not enough to press through the puck, and somehow a block happened with the half dampened puck...?

It's a reach and I don't fully get it but I don't know what else to think.

Also perhaps of note, it overheated because I forgot water a while (month?) back, did the o ring replacements and also added the metal chimney then (have a mk 1 for a few years now). All has been fine until today though...",2,1752858229.0,9Barista,6,1.0,False
1m37u3s,https://www.reddit.com/r/NovelNexus/comments/1m37u3s/the_abduction_by_john_grisham/,The Abduction by John Grisham:,"¬† Chapter 1  
  
¬† The abduction of April Finnemore took place in the dead of night, sometime between 9:15 p.m., when she last spoke with Theo Boone, and 3:30 a.m., when her mother entered her bedroom and realized she was gone. The abduction appeared to have been rushed; whoever took April did not allow her to gather her things. Her laptop was left behind. Though her bedroom was fairly neat, there was some clothing strewn about, which made it difficult to determine if she had been able to pack. Probably not, the police thought. Her toothbrush was still by the sink. Her backpack was by her bed. Her pajamas were on the floor, so she at least had been allowed to change. Her mother, when she wasn‚Äôt crying or ranting, told the police that her daughter‚Äôs favorite blue-and-white sweater was not in the closet. And April‚Äôs favorite sneakers were gone, too.  
  
¬† The police soon dismissed the notion that she‚Äôd simply run away. There was no reason to run away, her mother assured them, and she had not packed the things that would make such an escape successful.  
  
¬† A quick inspection of the home revealed no apparent break-in. The windows were all closed and locked, as were the three doors downstairs. Whoever took April was careful enough to close the door behind them, and lock it on the way out. After observing the scene and listening to Mrs. Finnemore for about an hour, the police decided to have a talk with Theo Boone. He was, after all, April‚Äôs best friend, and they usually chatted by phone or online at night before going to sleep.  
  
¬† At the Boone home, the phone rang at 4:33, according to the digital clock next to the bed where the parents slept. Mr. Woods Boone, the lighter sleeper, grabbed the phone, while Mrs. Marcella Boone rolled over and began wondering who would call at such an hour. When Mr. Boone said, ‚ÄúYes, Officer,‚Äù Mrs. Boone really woke up and scrambled out of bed. She listened to his end of the conversation, soon understood that it had something to do with April Finnemore, and was really confused when her husband said, ‚ÄúSure, Officer, we can be over there in fifteen minutes.‚Äù He hung up, and she said, ‚ÄúWhat is it, Woods?‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúApparently, April‚Äôs been abducted, and the police would like to talk to Theo.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúI doubt if he abducted her.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúWell, if he‚Äôs not upstairs in his room, we may have a problem.‚Äù  
  
¬† He was upstairs in his room, sound asleep, undisturbed by the ringing of the phone. As he threw on blue jeans and a sweatshirt, he explained to his parents that he had called April the night before on his cell phone and they‚Äôd chatted for a few minutes, same as usual.  
  
¬† As they drove through Strattenburg in the predawn darkness, Theo could think of nothing but April and of her miserable home life, her warring parents, her scarred brother and sister, both of whom had fled as soon as they were old enough. April was the youngest of three children born to two people who had no business having a family. Both parents were crazy, according to April herself, and Theo certainly agreed. Both had drug convictions. Her mother kept goats on a small farm outside of town and made cheese, bad cheese in Theo‚Äôs opinion. She peddled it around town in an old funeral hearse painted yellow, with a pet spider monkey riding shotgun. Her father was an aging hippie, who still played in a bad garage band with a bunch of other leftovers from the 1980s. He had no real job and was often gone for weeks. The Finnemores were in a perpetual state of separation, with talk of divorce always in the air.  
  
¬† April confided in Theo, and told him things he vowed to never repeat.  
  
¬† The Finnemore home was owned by someone else, a rental house April hated because her parents had no interest in maintaining it. It was in an older section of Strattenburg, on a shady street lined with other postwar homes that had seen better days. Theo had been there only one time, for a less-than-successful birthday party April‚Äôs mother had thrown together two years earlier. Most of the kids who‚Äôd been invited did not attend because their parents wouldn‚Äôt allow it. Such was the Finnemore family reputation.  
  
¬† There were two police cars in the driveway when the Boones arrived. Across the street, the neighbors were on their porches, watching.  
  
¬† Mrs. Finnemore‚Äîshe went by the name of May and had named her children April, March, and August‚Äîwas in the living room on a sofa talking to a uniformed officer when the Boones entered, rather awkwardly. Quick introductions were made; Mr. Boone had never met her.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúTheo!‚Äù Mrs. Finnemore said, very dramatically. ‚ÄúSomeone has taken our April!‚Äù Then she burst into tears and reached to hug Theo. He wanted no part of being hugged but went along with the ritual out of respect. As always, she wore a large flowing garment that was more of a tent than a dress, light brown in color and made from what appeared to be burlap. Her long graying hair was pulled into a tight ponytail. Crazy as she was, Theo had always been struck by her beauty. She made no effort at being attractive‚Äîquite unlike his mother‚Äîbut some things you can‚Äôt hide. She was also very creative, liked to paint and do pottery, in addition to making goat cheese. April had inherited the good genes‚Äîthe pretty eyes, the artistic flair.  
  
¬† When Mrs. Finnemore settled down, Mrs. Boone asked the officer, ‚ÄúWhat happened?‚Äù He responded with a quick summary of what little they knew at that point.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúDid you talk to her last night?‚Äù the officer asked Theo. The cop‚Äôs name was Bolick, Sergeant Bolick, which Theo knew because he‚Äôd seen him around the courthouse. Theo knew most of the policemen in Strattenburg, as well as most of the lawyers, judges, janitors, and clerks in the courthouse.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúYes, sir. At nine fifteen, according to my phone log. We talk almost every night before going to bed,‚Äù Theo said. Bolick had the reputation of being a wise guy. Theo wasn‚Äôt prepared to like him.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúHow sweet. Did she say anything that might be useful here? Was she worried? Scared?‚Äù  
  
¬† Theo was immediately caught in a vise. He could not lie to a police officer, yet he could not tell a secret that he‚Äôd promised he wouldn‚Äôt tell. So he fudged a bit by saying, ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt recall anything like that.‚Äù Mrs. Finnemore was no longer crying; she was staring intensely at Theo, her eyes glowing.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúWhat did you talk about?‚Äù Sergeant Bolick asked. A detective in plainclothes entered the room and listened carefully.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúThe usual stuff. School, homework, I don‚Äôt remember everything.‚Äù Theo had watched enough trials to know that answers should often be kept vague, and that ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt recall‚Äù and ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt remember‚Äù were perfectly acceptable in many instances.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúDid you chat online?‚Äù the detective asked.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúNo, sir, not last night. Just phone.‚Äù They often used Facebook and text messages, but Theo knew not to volunteer information. Just answer the question in front of you. He‚Äôd heard his mother say this to her clients many times.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúAny sign of a break-in?‚Äù Mr. Boone asked.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúNone,‚Äù said Bolick. ‚ÄúMrs. Finnemore was sound asleep in the downstairs bedroom, she heard nothing, and at some point she got up to check on April. That‚Äôs when she realized she was gone.‚Äù  
  
¬† Theo looked at Mrs. Finnemore, who again shot him a fierce look. He knew the truth, and she knew he knew the truth. Trouble was, Theo couldn‚Äôt tell the truth because he‚Äôd made a promise to April.  
  
¬† The truth was that Mrs. Finnemore had not been home for the past two nights. April had been living alone, terrified, with all the doors and windows locked as tightly as possible; with a chair jammed against her bedroom door; with an old baseball bat across the end of her bed; with the phone close and ready to dial 911, and with no one in the world to talk to but Theodore Boone, who had vowed not to tell a soul. Her father was out of town with his band. Her mother was taking pills and losing her mind.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúIn the past few days, has April said anything about running away?‚Äù the detective was asking Theo.  
  
¬† Oh, yes. Nonstop. She wants to run away to Paris and study art. She wants to r  
un away to LA and live with March, her older sister. She wants to run away to Santa Fe and become a painter. She wants to run away, period.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt recall anything like that,‚Äù Theo said, and it was the truth because ‚Äúin the past few days‚Äù could mean almost anything; thus, the question was too vague to require a definite answer on his part. He had seen this time and time again in trials. In his opinion, Sergeant Bolick and the detective were being far too sloppy with their questions. So far, they had not been able to pin him down, and he had not told a lie.  
  
¬† May Finnemore was overcome with tears and made a big show out of crying. Bolick and the detective quizzed Theo about April‚Äôs other friends, any potential problems she was having, how she was doing in school, and so on. Theo gave straight answers, with no wasted words.  
  
¬† A female officer in uniform had entered the den from upstairs, and she sat with Mrs. Finnemore, who was again distraught and overcome. Sergeant Bolick nodded at the Boones and motioned for them to follow him into the kitchen. They did, and the detective joined them. Bolick glared at Theo and in a low voice said, ‚ÄúDid the girl ever mention a relative in prison in California?‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúNo, sir,‚Äù Theo said.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúAre you sure?‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúSure I‚Äôm sure.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs this all about?‚Äù Mrs. Boone jumped in. She was not about to stand by silently while her son was rudely interrogated. Mr. Boone was ready to pounce, too.  
  
¬† The detective pulled out an 8"" x 10"" black-and-white photo, a mug shot of a shady-looking character who gave every indication of being a veteran criminal. Bolick went on, ‚ÄúGuy‚Äôs name is Jack Leeper, a ten-time loser. Distant cousin to May Finnemore, even more distant to April. He grew up around here, drifted away a long time ago, became a career thug, petty thief, drug dealer, and so on. Got busted in California for kidnapping ten years ago, sentenced to life with no parole. Escaped two weeks ago. This afternoon we get a tip that he might be in this area.‚Äù  
  
¬† Theo looked at the sinister face of Jack Leeper and felt ill. If this thug had April, then she was in serious trouble.  
  
¬† Bolick continued, ‚ÄúLast night around seven thirty, Leeper here walks into the Korean Quick Shop four blocks away, buys cigarettes and beer, gets his face captured on the surveillance cameras. Not the smartest crook in the world. So, we know he‚Äôs definitely in the area.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúWhy would he take April?‚Äù Theo blurted, his mouth dry with fear, his knees ready to buckle.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúAccording to authorities in California, they found some letters from April in his prison cell. She was his pen pal, probably felt sorry for the guy ‚Äôcause he‚Äôs never supposed to get out of prison. So she strikes up a correspondence. We‚Äôve searched her room upstairs and can‚Äôt find anything he may have written to her.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúShe never mentioned this to you?‚Äù the detective asked.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúNever,‚Äù Theo said. He had learned that with April‚Äôs weird family there were many secrets, many things she kept to herself.  
  
¬† The detective put away the photo, and Theo was relieved. He never wanted to see the face again, but he doubted if he could ever forget it.  
  
¬† Sergeant Bolick said, ‚ÄúWe suspect that April knew the person who took her. How else can you explain the lack of a forcible entry?‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúDo you think he would hurt her?‚Äù Theo asked.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúWe have no way of knowing that, Theo. This man‚Äôs been in prison most of his life. His behavior is unpredictable.‚Äù  
  
¬† The detective added, ‚ÄúThe good thing is that he always gets caught.‚Äù  
  
¬† Theo said, ‚ÄúIf April‚Äôs with him, she‚Äôll contact us. She‚Äôll find a way.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúThen, please let us know.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt worry.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúExcuse me, Officer,‚Äù Mrs. Boone said. ‚ÄúBut I thought in a case like this you first investigate the parents. Missing children are almost always taken by one of their parents, right?‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúThis is correct,‚Äù Bolick said. ‚ÄúAnd we are looking for the father. According to the mother, though, she spoke with him yesterday afternoon and he was with his band somewhere in West Virginia. She feels rather strongly that he is not involved in this.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúApril can‚Äôt stand her father,‚Äù Theo blurted, then wished he‚Äôd remained quiet.  
  
¬† They chatted for a few more minutes, but the conversation was obviously over. The officers thanked the Boones for coming and promised to check back later. Both Mr. and Mrs. Boone said they would be at their office all day if they were needed for anything. Theo, of course, would be in school.  
  
¬† As they drove away, Mrs. Boone said, ‚ÄúThat poor child. Snatched from her own bedroom.‚Äù  
  
¬† Mr. Boone, who was driving, glanced back over his shoulder and said, ‚ÄúAre you okay, Theo?‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúI guess,‚Äù he said.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúOf course he‚Äôs not okay, Woods. His friend has just been abducted.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúI can speak for myself, Mom,‚Äù Theo said.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúOf course you can, dear. I just hope they find her, and soon.‚Äù  
  
¬† There was a hint of sunlight to the east. As they drove through the residential neighborhood, Theo stared out of his window, searching for the hardened face of Jack Leeper. But no one was out there. Lights in homes were being turned on. The town was waking up.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs almost six,‚Äù Mr. Boone announced. ‚ÄúI say we go to Gertrude‚Äôs and have her world-famous waffles. Theo?‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúI‚Äôm in,‚Äù Theo replied, though he had no appetite.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúMarvelous, honey,‚Äù Mrs. Boone said, though all three knew she would have nothing but coffee.  
  
¬† Chapter 2  
  
¬† Gertrude‚Äôs was an old diner on Main Street, six blocks west of the courthouse and three blocks south of the police station. It claimed to serve pecan waffles that were famous around the world, but Theo had often doubted this. Did people in Japan and Greece really know about Gertrude and her waffles? He wasn‚Äôt so sure. He had friends at school who‚Äôd never heard of Gertrude‚Äôs right there in Strattenburg. A few miles west of town, on the main highway, there was an ancient log cabin with a gas pump out front and a large sign advertising DUDLEY‚ÄôS WORLD-FAMOUS MINT FUDGE. When Theo was younger, he naturally had assumed that everybody in town not only craved the mint fudge but talked about it nonstop. How else could it achieve the status of being world famous? Then one day in class the discussion took an odd turn and found its way to the topic of imports and exports. Theo made the observation that Mr. Dudley and his mint fudge were heavy into exports because they were so famous. It said so right there on the billboard. To his astonishment, only one other classmate had ever heard of this fudge. Slowly, Theo realized that it probably was not as well known as Mr. Dudley claimed it to be. Slowly, he began to grasp the concept of false advertising.  
  
¬† Since then, he‚Äôd been very suspicious of such big claims of notoriety.  
  
¬† But on this morning he couldn‚Äôt dwell on waffles and fudge, famous or not. He was far too occupied with thoughts of April and the slimy figure of Jack Leeper. The Boones were seated at a small table in the crowded diner. The air was thick with bacon grease and strong coffee, and the hot topic, as Theo realized not long after he sat down, was the abduction of April Finnemore. To their right, four uniformed policemen talked loudly about the possibility that Leeper was close by. To their left, a table of gray-haired men spoke with great authority on several subjects, but seemed particularly interested in the ‚Äúkidnapping,‚Äù as it was sometimes referred to.  
  
¬† The menu promoted the myth that Gertrude‚Äôs was indeed the home of ‚ÄúWorld-Famous Pecan Waffles.‚Äù In silent protest against false advertising, Theo ordered scrambled eggs and sausage. His father ordered waffles. His mother ordered dry wheat toast.  
  
¬† As soon as the waitress walked away, Mrs. Boone looked Theo squarely in the eyes and said, ‚ÄúOkay, let‚Äôs have it. There‚Äôs something else to the story.‚Äù  
  
¬† Theo was constantly amazed at how easily his mother could do this. He could tell only half of a story, and she immediately looked for the other half. He could offer up a little fib, nothing serious, maybe something just for fun, and she instinctively pounced on it and ripped it to shred  
s. He could duck a direct question, and she would fire back with three more. Theo suspected she had acquired this skill after years as a divorce lawyer. She often said that she never expected her clients to tell her the truth.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúI agree,‚Äù said Mr. Boone. Theo couldn‚Äôt tell if he really agreed, or whether he was just tag-teaming with his wife, which he often did. Mr. Boone was a real estate lawyer who never went to court, and, while he missed little, he was usually a step or two behind Mrs. Boone when it came time to grill Theo about something.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúApril told me not to tell anyone,‚Äù Theo said.  
  
¬† To which his mother responded quickly, ‚ÄúAnd April is in big trouble right now, Theo. If you know something, let‚Äôs have it. And now.‚Äù Her eyes narrowed. Her eyebrows arched. Theo knew where this was headed, and, truthfully, he knew it was better to level with his parents.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúMrs. Finnemore wasn‚Äôt at home when I talked to April last night,‚Äù Theo said, his head low, his eyes darting left and right. ‚ÄúAnd she wasn‚Äôt home the night before. She‚Äôs taking pills and she‚Äôs acting crazy. April‚Äôs been living by herself.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúWhere‚Äôs her father?‚Äù Mr. Boone asked.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs off with his band, hasn‚Äôt been home in a week.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúDoesn‚Äôt he have a job?‚Äù Mrs. Boone asked.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúHe buys and sells antique furniture. April says he‚Äôll make a few bucks, then disappear for a week or two with his band.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúThat poor girl,‚Äù Mrs. Boone said.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúAre you going to tell the police?‚Äù Theo asked.  
  
¬† Both parents took long sips from their coffee cups. They exchanged curious looks as they pondered this. They eventually agreed that they would discuss it later, at the office, while Theo was at school. Mrs. Finnemore was obviously lying to the police, but the Boones were reluctant to get in the middle of that. They doubted if she knew anything about the abduction. She seemed distressed enough. She probably felt guilty for being away when her daughter was taken.  
  
¬† The food arrived and the waitress refilled the coffee cups. Theo was drinking milk.  
  
¬† The situation was very complicated, and Theo was relieved to have his parents involved and doing their share of the worrying.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúAnything else, Theo?‚Äù his father asked.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúNot that I can think of.‚Äù  
  
¬† His mother said, ‚ÄúWhen you talked to her last night, was she frightened?‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúYes. She was really scared and also worried about her mother.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúWhy didn‚Äôt you tell us?‚Äù his father asked.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúBecause she made me promise not to tell. April has to deal with a lot, and she‚Äôs very private. She‚Äôs also embarrassed by her family and tries to protect them. She was hoping her mother would show up at any minute. I guess someone else did.‚Äù  
  
¬† Theo suddenly lost his appetite. He should‚Äôve done more. He should‚Äôve tried to protect April by telling his parents or perhaps a teacher at school. Someone would have listened to him. He could have done something. But, April swore him to silence, and she kept assuring him she was safe. The house was locked; plenty of lights were on, and so forth.  
  
¬† During the drive home, Theo said from the rear seat, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not sure I can go to school today.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúI was waiting for that,‚Äù his father replied.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs your reason this time?‚Äù his mother said.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúWell, to start with, I didn‚Äôt get enough sleep last night. We‚Äôve been up since, what four thirty?‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúSo you want to go home and go to sleep?‚Äù his father replied.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt say that, but I doubt if I can stay awake at school.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúI bet you can. Your mother and I are going to work, and we have no choice but to stay awake.‚Äù  
  
¬† Theo almost blurted something about his father‚Äôs daily siesta; a brief power nap at the desk with the door locked, usually around 3:00 p.m. Everyone who worked at the law firm of Boone & Boone knew that Woods was upstairs, shoes off, feet on the desk, phone on Do Not Disturb, snoring away for thirty minutes every afternoon.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúYou can tough it out,‚Äù his father added.  
  
¬† Theo‚Äôs problem at this moment was his habit of trying to avoid school. Headaches, coughs, food poisoning, pulled muscles, stomach gas‚ÄîTheo had tried them all and would try them again. He didn‚Äôt hate school; in fact, he usually enjoyed it once he got there. He made good grades and enjoyed his friends. Theo, though, wanted to be at the courthouse, watching trials and hearings, listening to the lawyers and judges, chatting with the policemen and the clerks, even the janitors. Theo knew them all.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs another reason I can‚Äôt go to school,‚Äù he said, though he knew this was a battle he would not win.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs hear it,‚Äù his mother said.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúOkay, there‚Äôs a manhunt underway, and I need to go help. How often do we have a manhunt in Strattenburg? This is a big deal, especially since it‚Äôs my close friend they‚Äôre looking for. I need to help search for April. She would expect me to. Plus, there‚Äôs no way I can concentrate at school. A total waste of time. I‚Äôll think of nothing but April.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúNice try,‚Äù his father said.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúNot bad,‚Äù his mother added.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúLook, I‚Äôm serious. I need to be on the streets.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúI‚Äôm confused,‚Äù his father said, though he really wasn‚Äôt. He often claimed to be confused when discussing things with Theo. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre too tired to go to school, yet you have enough energy to lead a manhunt.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúWhatever. There‚Äôs no way I can go to school.

An hour later, Theo parked his bike outside the middle school and reluctantly went inside as the 8:15 bell was ringing. In the main lobby, he was immediately met by three crying eighth-grade girls who wanted to know if he knew anything about April. He said he knew nothing more than what was being reported on the morning news.  
  
¬† Evidently, everybody in town had watched the morning news. The reports showed a school photo of April, and a mug shot of Jack Leeper. There was a strong suggestion that a kidnapping had taken place. Theo didn‚Äôt understand this. A kidnapping (and he‚Äôd checked the dictionary) usually involved a demand for ransom‚Äîcash to be paid for the release of the person seized. The Finnemores couldn‚Äôt pay their monthly bills‚Äîhow were they supposed to find serious cash to free April? And there was no word yet from the kidnapper. Usually, as Theo remembered from television, the family gets word pretty soon that the bad guys have the child and would like a million bucks or so for a safe return.  
  
¬† Another report from the morning news showed Mrs. Finnemore crying in front of their home. The police were tight-lipped, saying only that they were pursuing all leads. A neighbor said his dog started barking around midnight, always a bad sign. As frantic as the reporters seemed to be that morning, the truth was that they were finding very little to add to the story of a missing girl.  
  
¬† Theo‚Äôs homeroom teacher was Mr. Mount, who also taught Government. After Mr. Mount got the boys settled, he called the roll. All sixteen were present. The conversation quickly got around to the disappearance of April, and Mr. Mount asked Theo if he‚Äôd heard anything.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúNothing,‚Äù Theo said, and his classmates seemed disappointed. Theo was one of the few boys who talked to April. Most of the eighth graders, boys and girls, liked April but found her difficult to hang out with. She was quiet, dressed more like a boy than a girl, had no interest in the latest fashions or the weekly teen-gossip magazines, and as everyone knew, came from a weird family.  
  
¬† The bell rang for first period, and Theo, already exhausted, dragged himself off to Spanish.  
  
¬† Chapter 3  
  
¬† Final bell rang at 3:30, and by 3:31 Theo was on his bike, speeding away from school, darting through alleys and back streets and dodging downtown traffic. He zipped across Main Street, waved at a policeman standing near an intersection and pretended not to hear when the policeman yelled, ‚ÄúSlow it down, Theo.‚Äù He cut through a small cemetery and turned onto Park Street.  
  
¬† His parents had been married for twenty-five years, and for the past twenty they had worked together as partners in the small firm of Boone & Boone, located at 415 Park Street, in the heart of old Strattenburg. There had once been another partner, Ike Boone, Theo‚Äôs uncle, but Ike had been forced to leave the firm when he got himself into some trouble. Now the firm had just two equal partners‚ÄîMarcella Boone on the first floor, in a neat modern office where she handled mainly divorces, and Woods Boone upstairs all alone in a large cluttered room with sagging bookshelves and stacks of files littering the floor and an ever-present cloud of fragrant pipe smoke rolling gently across the ceiling. Rounding out the firm, there was Elsa, who answered the phone, greeted the clients, managed the office, did some typing, and kept an eye on Judge, the dog; there was Dorothy, a real estate secretary, who worked for Mr. Boone and did work that Theo considered horribly boring; and there was Vince, the paralegal, who worked on Mrs. Boone‚Äôs cases.  
  
¬† Judge, a mutt who was Theo‚Äôs dog, the family‚Äôs dog, and the firm‚Äôs dog, spent his days at the office, sometimes creeping quietly from room to room keeping an eye on things, oftentimes following a human to the kitchen where he expected food, but mostly snoozing on a small square bed in the reception area where Elsa talked to him whenever she typed.  
  
¬† The last member of the firm was Theo, who happily suspected that he was the only thirteen-year-old in Strattenburg with his own law office. Of course, he was too young to be a real member of the firm, but there were times when Theo was valuable. He fetched files for Dorothy and Vince. He scanned lengthy documents looking for key words or phrases. His computer skills were extraordinary and allowed him to research legal issues and dig up facts. But his favorite chore, by far, was dashing off to the courthouse to file papers for the firm. Theo loved the courthouse and dreamed of the day when he would stand in the large, stately courtroom on the second floor and defend his clients.  
  
¬† At 3:40 p.m., on the dot, Theo parked his bike on the narrow front porch of Boone & Boone, and braced himself. Elsa greeted him every day with a fierce hug, a painful pinch on the check, then a quick inspection of whatever he was wearing. He opened the door, stepped inside, and got himself properly greeted. As always, Judge was waiting, too. He bounced from his bed and ran to see Theo.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúI‚Äôm so sorry about April,‚Äù Elsa gushed. She sounded as if she knew the girl personally, which she did not. But by now, as with any tragedy, everyone in Strattenburg knew or claimed to know April and could say only great things about her.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúAny news?‚Äù Theo asked, rubbing Judge‚Äôs head.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúNothing. I‚Äôve listened to the radio all day, no word, no sign of anything. How was school?‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúTerrible. All we did was talk about April.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúThat poor girl.‚Äù Elsa was inspecting his shirt, then her eyes moved down to his pants and for a split second Theo froze. Every day she looked him over quickly and never hesitated to say something like ‚ÄúDoes that shirt really match those pants?‚Äù or ‚ÄúDidn‚Äôt you wear that shirt two days ago?‚Äù This irritated Theo tremendously and he had complained to both parents, but nothing came of his protests. Elsa was like a member of the family, a second mother to Theo, and if she wanted to quiz him about anything, she did so out of affection.  
  
¬† The rumor was that Elsa spent all her money on clothes, and she certainly gave that appearance. Apparently, she approved of his attire today. Before she had the chance to comment, Theo kept the conversation going with, ‚ÄúIs my mother in?‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúYes, but she has a client. Mr. Boone is working.‚Äù  
  
¬† This was usually the case. Theo‚Äôs mother, when she wasn‚Äôt in court, spent most of her time with clients, almost all of whom were women who (1) wanted a divorce, or (2) needed a divorce, or (3) were in the process of getting a divorce, or (4) were suffering through the aftermath of a divorce. It was difficult work, but his mother was known as one of the top divorce lawyers in town. Theo was quite proud of this. He was also proud of the fact that his mother encouraged every new client to seek professional counseling in an effort to save the marriage. Sadly, though, as he‚Äôd already learned, some marriages cannot be saved.  
  
¬† He bounced up the stairs with Judge at his heels and barged into the spacious and wonderful office of Woods Boone, Attorney and Counselor-at-Law. His dad was behind his desk, at work, pipe in one hand, pen in the other, with papers scattered everywhere.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúWell, hello, Theo,‚Äù Mr. Boone said with a warm smile. ‚ÄúA good day at school?‚Äù The same question five days a week.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúTerrible,‚Äù Theo said. ‚ÄúI knew I shouldn‚Äôt have gone. A total waste.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúAnd why is that?‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúCome on, Dad. My friend, our classmate, has been snatched by an escaped criminal who was sent to prison because he‚Äôs a kidnapper. It‚Äôs not like this happens every day around here. We should‚Äôve been out there on the streets helping with the manhunt, but no, we were stuck in school where all we did was talk about searching for April.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúNonsense. Leave the manhunt to the professionals, Theo. We have a fine police force in this city.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúWell, they haven‚Äôt found her yet. Maybe they need some help.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúHelp from whom?‚Äù  
  
¬† Theo cleared his throat and clenched his jaw. He stared straight at his father, and got ready to tell the truth. He‚Äôd been taught to confront the truth head-on, hold nothing back, just blurt it all out, and whatever followed would be far better than lying or concealing the truth. He was about to say‚Äî‚ÄúHelp from us, Dad, April‚Äôs friends. I‚Äôve organized a search party, and we‚Äôre about to hit the streets‚Äù‚Äîwhen the phone rang. His father grabbed it, of  
fered his usual gruff ‚ÄúWoods Boone,‚Äù then began listening.  
  
¬† Theo held his tongue. After a few seconds, his father covered the receiver and whispered, ‚ÄúThis might take a while.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúSee you later,‚Äù Theo said as he jumped to his feet and left. He walked downstairs, Judge following close behind, and made his way to the rear of Boone & Boone, to the small room he called his office. He unloaded his backpack, arranged his books and notebooks, and gave every indication that he was about to plunge into his homework. He was not.  
  
¬† The search party he‚Äôd organized consisted of about twenty of his friends. The plan was to hit the streets in five units of four bikes each. They had cell phones and two-way radios. Woody had an iPad with Google Earth and GPS apps. Everything would be coordinated, with Theo, of course, in charge. They would comb certain areas of town searching for April, and they would distribute flyers with her face in the center and the promise of one thousand dollars in reward money for information leading to her rescue. They had passed the hat at school and collected almost two hundred dollars from students and teachers. Theo and his friends figured they could get the rest of the money from their parents in the event someone came forward with crucial information. Surely, Theo had argued, the parents would cough up the money, if necessary. It was risky, but there was so much at stake and so little time.  
  
¬† Theo eased out the back door, leaving Judge alone and confused, then sneaked around to the front and hopped on his bike.  
  
¬† Chapter 4  
  
¬† The search party came together a few minutes before 4:00 p.m., in Truman Park, the largest park of any kind in the city of Strattenburg. The gang met near the main gazebo, a popular place in the heart of the park, a place where politicians made speeches and bands played on long summer evenings and, occasionally, young couples got married. There were eighteen in all; fifteen boys and three girls, all properly helmeted and eager to find and rescue April Finnemore.  
  
¬† Throughout the day at school, the boys had argued and bickered about how a proper manhunt should be conducted. None had ever taken part in such a search, but this lack of experience was not mentioned or acknowledged. Instead, several of them, including Theo, spoke as if they knew precisely what to do. Another strong voice belonged to Woody, who, because he owned the iPad, felt as though more weight should be given to his ideas. Another leader was Justin, the best athlete in their class and, therefore, the one with the most self-confidence.  
  
¬† There were skeptics in the eighth grade who believed that Jack Leeper had already fled the area with April. Why would he stay in a place where everyone was looking at his face on television? The skeptics argued that any effort to find her was futile. She was gone, hidden in another state, perhaps another country, hopefully still alive.  
  
¬† But Theo and the others were determined to do something, anything. Maybe she was gone, but maybe she wasn‚Äôt. No one knew, but at least they were trying. Who knows‚Äîthey might get lucky.  
  
¬† Late in the day, the searchers finally reached an agreement among themselves. They would concentrate their efforts in an old section known as Delmont, near Stratten College, in the northwest part of the town. Delmont was lower income, with more renters than owners, and popular with students and starving artists. The search party figured any kidnapper worth his salt would stay away from the nicer neighborhoods. He would avoid central Strattenburg with its busy streets and sidewalks. He would almost certainly choose an area where strangers came and went with greater frequency. Thus, they had narrowed their search, and from the moment the decision was made, they were convinced that April was stashed away in a back room of some cheap rental duplex, or perhaps gagged and bound and hidden above an old garage in Delmont.  
  
¬† They split into three teams of six, with a girl included a bit reluctantly to each unit. Ten minutes after they gathered in the park, they wheeled into Gibson‚Äôs Grocery on the edge of Delmont. Woody‚Äôs team took Allen Street, Justin‚Äôs, Edgecomb Street. And Theo, who had assumed the role of supreme commander, though he didn‚Äôt refer to himself in such a manner, led his team two blocks over to Trover Avenue, where they began tacking MISSING flyers on every utility pole they saw. They stopped at a Laundromat and handed flyers to the people washing their clothes. They chatted with pedestrians on the sidewalks and told them to keep a sharp lookout. They talked to old men rocking on porches and nice ladies pulling weeds from flower beds. They pedaled slowly along Trover, taking in each house, each duplex, each apartment building, and as this went on and on, they began to realize that they were not accomplishing much. If April were locked away inside one of the buildings, how were they supposed to find her? They could not peek in. They could not knock on the door and expect Leeper to answer it. They could not yell at the windows and hope she answered. Theo began to realize that their time was better spent handing out flyers and talking about the reward money.  
  
¬† They finished Trover Avenue and moved a block north to Whitworth Street, where they went door-to-door in a shopping center, passing out flyers in a barbershop, a cleaners, a pizza carryout, and a liquor store. The warning on the door of the liquor store plainly forbade the entry of anyone under the age of twenty-one, but Theo didn‚Äôt hesitate. He was there to help a friend, not buy booze. He marched inside, alone, handed flyers to the two idle clerks at the cash registers, and walked out before they could protest.  
  
¬† They were leaving the shopping center when an urgent call came from Woody. The police had stopped them on Allen Street, and the police were not happy. Theo and his team took off, and a few minutes later arrived at the scene. There were two city police cars and three uniformed officers.  
  
¬† Theo realized immediately that he did not recognize any of the policemen.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúWhat are you kids doing here?‚Äù the first one asked as Theo approached. His bronze nameplate identified him as Bard. ‚ÄúLemme guess, you‚Äôre helping with the search?‚Äù Bard said with a sneer.  
  
¬† Theo shoved out his hand and said, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm Theo Boone.‚Äù He emphasized his last name in hopes that one of the officers might recognize it. He‚Äôd learned that most of the policemen knew most of the lawyers, and maybe, just maybe, one of these guys would realize that Theo‚Äôs parents were well-respected attorneys. But, it didn‚Äôt work. There were so many lawyers in Strattenburg.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúYes, sir, we‚Äôre helping you guys search for April Finnemore,‚Äù Theo went on pleasantly, flashing his braces with a wide smile at Officer Bard.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúAre you the leader of this gang?‚Äù Bard snapped.  
  
¬† Theo glanced at Woody, who‚Äôd lost all confidence and appeared frightened, as if he were about to be dragged away to jail and perhaps beaten. ‚ÄúI guess,‚Äù Theo answered.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúSo, who asked you boys and girls to join in the search?‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúWell, sir, no one really asked us. April is our friend and we‚Äôre worried.‚Äù Theo was trying to find the right tone. He wanted to be very respectful, but at the same time he was convinced they were doing nothing wrong.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúHow sweet,‚Äù Bard said, grinning at the other two officers. He was holding a flyer and he showed it to Theo. ‚ÄúWho printed these?‚Äù he asked.  
  
¬† Theo wanted to say, ‚ÄúSir, it‚Äôs really none of your business who printed the flyers.‚Äù But this would only make a tense situation much worse. So he said, ‚ÄúWe printed them at school today.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúAnd this is April?‚Äù Bard said, pointing to the smiling face square in the middle of the flyer.  
  
¬† Theo wanted to say, ‚ÄúNo, sir, that‚Äôs another girl‚Äôs face we‚Äôre using to make the search even more difficult by confusing everybody.‚Äù  
  
¬† April‚Äôs face had been all over the local news. Surely, Bard recognized her.  
  
¬† Theo said, simply, ‚ÄúYes, sir.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúAnd who gave you kids permission to tack these flyers on public property?‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúNo one.

1m37u2f,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1m37u2f,"What went wrong? Over-pressure failure, but why?","Had a steam blow out just now. I've had this happen before, and overheating failures iv repeaired, but always was able to understand what went wrong.

This time I'm baffled.

17.9g of the same coffee I used yesterday, so same amount, and same grind size (checked grinder to be sure). Water in chamber. I don't use the silicon puck and haven't for months, fwiw. Same heat I use daily, on my induction stovetop converter I've always used. Same pick tamper pressure because it's spring loaded to give a consistent press every time.

I don't set a timer these days because it's all dialed in, but based on milk temp that I heat on cooler edge of the same induction adapter plate, I can deduce i left the 9barista on the heat longer than I should have.

Steam blew out so vigorously and intensely that it blew the o ring partially out. 

Trying to think it through... The one thing different today is that I noticed the 9barista wasn't placed on the hot center of my induction plate and not at the highest temp (sometimes I use 7 or 8 instead of 9, to allow heating the other burner for cooking breakfast). I then moved it to center of heating plate as I noticed the milk was at frothing temp and already done (usually it finishes at same time as the coffee, more or less).

Perhaps I let it just be cool enough to get some water to pass the valve but not enough to press through the puck, and somehow a block happened with the half dampened puck...?

It's a reach and I don't fully get it but I don't know what else to think.

Also perhaps of note, it overheated because I forgot water a while (month?) back, did the o ring replacements and also added the metal chimney then (have a mk 1 for a few years now). All has been fine until today though...",2,1752858217.0,9Barista,1,1.0,False

Now i tried pulling some shots and it seems like no matter how little coffe i put in my filter the hex screw from the showerdisc gets pushed into my coffe. With more then 5g the whole puck gets stuck to the shower disc and the coffee tastes very burnt.  
Did it just came with a to small filter insert for the machine or is the whole boiling unit mounted too low?

For those that are familiar with R.E.Load bags, that was my company that I ran for about 25 years in Northern Liberties before calling it quits. Breezer brought me in a few months ago to help open up their retail location, which is in the same building that serves as headquarters for the brand, with offices for product development, the creative department, and sales all on the 2nd floor. It's really a great setup and I'm happy to have the opportunity to connect even more with the Philly cycling community. 

If you're interested, head over and join us on [Strava](https://www.strava.com/clubs/breezerbikes) or follow us on [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/breezerbikes/) you'll see our ride announcements every few weeks. We'll also have some demo Breezer bikes available to check out. For more info about the lineup, check [here](https://www.breezerbikes.com/). Hope to ride with you soon!

I just need to vent‚Äî I have a 6 week old (7 weeks on Monday) and I have been through it emotionally. I started therapy, joined a support group, we get help once a week from my mom and his mom helps out at night for a feeding or two.

Some days are rough and I cry and cry and go back to how I was feeling at the beginning‚Äî was this a mistake? Can I do this? I‚Äôm not living my life like I was. Did I shower? Have I eaten? But then‚Ä¶

Some days are AMAZING!! My daughter wakes up not crying, we change her and she just looks around and is happy to sit in her bouncer. She takes her formula, doesn‚Äôt spit up, there‚Äôs no crying, we get a smile here and there, and she goes down for her naps without a fight. At night we‚Äôll even get 4-5 hours of her sleeping! 

I‚Äôm writing this not just for myself, but maybe someone who‚Äôs in the first week hating this as much as I did, and just want to say as the weeks go by, there are really good days and cling to those for the days that suck ass. Today, is a bad day. But yesterday was an AMAZING DAY. And I know we‚Äôll have more amazing days and it‚Äôs okay to hate this at times. I know our babes will grow up happy (I hope!) and we‚Äôll get to go out and do things I used to love doing on my own‚Äî bookstores, coffee runs, walks longer than 15 minutes, seeing friends!

Most days I can park in my bosses personal parking spot, her boyfriend only works from home one day a week, so on those days I park on the street.

I always close the door when I leave to move my car but if a customer leaves the seating area and doesn't push the door shut then it sticks open a bit, and she thought she was just fine to come in even though there are signs staying the cafeteria is closed at 12:30 for 10 minutes!!! 
Her response to me asking her to not take an item without paying was ""I've had many people complain about you closing at 12:30, maybe you should figure out something else so you can serve us when we want our lunch"" I was awestruck.

The **Bodum 10948-01BUS Brazil French Press Coffee Maker** has been a staple in my kitchen for some time now, and there‚Äôs quite a bit to unpack about this compact piece of brewing brilliance. If you‚Äôre someone who takes coffee seriously‚Äîor even if you just enjoy the occasional aroma-filled cup on a lazy morning‚Äîthis French press promises an entirely new level of simplicity and eco-friendliness. Of course, it isn't entirely free from quirks.

**Design and Build Quality**

The first thing that drew me toward this coffee press was its minimalist design. With its BPA-free plastic body and high-heat borosilicate glass carafe, it offers both durability and aesthetics. The matte black finish feels modern yet classic, and it fits seamlessly with my other kitchen gadgets. I also appreciate how lightweight it is, which makes it easy to move around.  

But the glass carafe, while heat-resistant and non-staining, had me slightly worried about its fragility. So far, it‚Äôs held up well despite my somewhat clumsy handling. The stainless steel plunger and durable filter also deserve praise for doing a pretty stellar job in keeping pesky coffee grounds out of my cup, making every sip a smooth experience.  

**Ease of Use and Brewing Process**

Getting started with this French press was a breeze. The instructions are straightforward‚Äîadd coarsely grounded coffee, pour in hot water, wait four minutes, then plunge. No advanced settings or techy buttons, just a simple manual process that delivers rich, aromatic coffee every time.  

I‚Äôve noticed, though, that it takes a bit of practice to perfect the grind size and coffee-to-water ratio for that ideal taste. There were mornings when my brew turned out a bit weaker than expected, but fine-tuning the ratios over time made all the difference.  

[Check Bodum 10948-01BUS price on Amazon.](https://tastefulcoffee.com/p/b00bkrhd20/)  

**Who It‚Äôs Best For**

This product isn‚Äôt trying to compete with high-end espresso machines or fancy electric coffee makers. It‚Äôs for anyone who loves coffee with a fuller flavor and doesn‚Äôt want the hassle of dealing with single-use coffee pods. Its compact size makes it ideal for small kitchens, camping trips, or even an office desk setup. It‚Äôs also a great starter coffee brewer if you‚Äôre dipping your toes into the world of French presses.

Parents, my sister included, have told me that the brew strength options are perfect for groggy mornings when their toddlers have been up all night. On the other hand, my coworker swears by this French press for its environmentally friendly features‚Äîno paper filters or plastic capsules means zero waste.  

**Perks**

- Lightweight and compact design fits in tight spaces.  
- Durable borosilicate glass ensures coffee retains its natural flavor.  
- Stainless steel plunger and filter are excellent at separating coffee grounds.  
- BPA-free body and handle make it safe for everyday use.  

**Areas for Improvement**

- The glass carafe requires careful handling to avoid cracks or breakage.  
- Coffee grind size needs to be adjusted carefully for optimal results.  
- Lacks capacity if you‚Äôre brewing for more than two people at a time.  

**Competing Brands**

Compared to its market rivals, like the popular Aeropress or even larger-capacity French presses, this product holds its own for several key reasons. It outshines other brands when it comes to flavor depth as there‚Äôs no use of paper filters, which can absorb some coffee oils. That said, the Aeropress offers more versatility for brewing other coffee styles, while Bodum focuses purely on robust French press coffee.

Against chrome-heavy or stainless steel French presses, the lightweight plastic of this model might feel less premium. At the same time, that lightweight build made this my travel companion more often than the heftier alternatives.  

**Price Performance**

Taking into account the simplicity of the design and how well it brews coffee, this French press offers commendable **bang for the buck**. It‚Äôs affordable without compromising on the quality of the final brew. While there are cheaper options in the French press category, I found this one strikes a nice balance between functionality and affordability. If longevity and aesthetics matter to you, it‚Äôs worth every penny.

anyway, onto the main point. my father almost never cleans up after himself in any aspect. he doesnt rinse dishes when putting them in the sink which in turn attracts gnats, he will leave his pee and spit in the toilet and have the audacity to ask ME to flush for him when i ask him to flush, he leaves his little hairs on the sink in the bathroom when he shaves after we have given him a fairly simple solution (some hammock thing that goes on the mirror and catches the hair) and only recently agreed to not force me to clean up his hair when i clean the bathroom, he never refills the toilet paper rolls in the bathroom and just leaves the old rolls sitting and blames me for them, and just so SO much more. one of the worst examples is him leaving a pretty big dead moth in one of his coffee cups. just left it there for me to clean. he knows im very sensitive about bugs, and i did cry because i felt horrible for the moth. he didnt apologize, he just said ""leave it ill deal with it"". okay dude. im disabled and high needs autistic by the way, so that just adds another layer of ""why are you making your teenage daughter clean up after you"".

he blames it on his undiagnosed ADHD, claiming he just forgets. im sorry, theres no way you forget EVERY SINGLE TIME. and if you are, you need to see a fucking neurologist because thats not ADHD, thats dementia or something. but the thing is, with all of this, he still finds it in him to act like im always leaving messes when i happen to leave my clothes on the bathroom floor absentmindedly. i dont do this often. i never did, despite what he says. hes gaslit (well, attempted to. im not very easy to gaslight unfortunately) me in the past, so im not entirely surprised. but im at my breaking point. im tired of ALL OF THIS. my mom just says ""well he just forgets"" NO HE DOESNT.

Detailed Review,"The NFFTYUUT 1 Cold Brew Coffee Maker is a product that has brought both convenience and consistency to my mornings. As someone who treasures an iced coffee after the morning rush, I dove right into putting this sleek mason jar-style brewer to the test. Boasting durable glass construction, a 64-ounce capacity, and a stainless steel filter, it presents itself as a multipurpose brewing companion perfect for coffee, lemonade, iced tea, and even fruit-infused drinks. But as much as I‚Äôve grown fond of it, exploring its strengths and quirks felt essential.

**Stylish and Robust Design**  
Aesthetic appeal isn‚Äôt the only thing the design has going for it, but let‚Äôs address the obvious: this coffee maker looks fantastic on my counter. The thick, durable glass feels satisfying in hand and offers a level of trustworthiness you don‚Äôt always get from cheaper plastic alternatives. I‚Äôve accidentally bumped it against my sink a few times (oops), and to my relief, the robust material held up every time. The black handle is a snug fit, offering good grip when the jar is full of cold brew or lemonade during summer BBQs.

**Functional Brewing Features**  
One of the standout features is its stainless steel filter. Unlike the single-use paper filters I despise‚Äîand keep running out of‚Äîthis one is reusable, saving me trips to the store and making it eco-friendly. It handles fine coffee grounds impressively well, keeping my brew grit-free. The wide mouth is a bonus when it comes to filling and cleaning, but this product is strictly for manual use‚Äîit‚Äôs not suitable for pressurized brewing.

**Highlights**  
- Durable glass that resists breakage.  
- Large 64 oz capacity for multiple servings.  
- Reusable stainless steel filter to prevent waste.  
- A versatile design suitable for various cold drinks.  

[Check NFFTYUUT 1 Cold Brew Coffee Maker pricing on Amazon here.](https://tastefulcoffee.com/p/b0c2btnzz3/)

**User Experience**  
I've been using this cold brew coffee maker daily for a couple of weeks now, and one thing that stands out is how simple the process is. I just add my favorite medium-coarse coffee grounds to the filter, fill it with room-temperature water, and refrigerate it overnight. Twelve hours later, I have smooth, flavorful cold brew ready to taste. However, note that the brewing process does require patience. If you‚Äôre someone who tends to forget about prepping the night before, you might find this a bit of an inconvenience.

**some Drawbacks**  
- Brew time requires up to 12 hours, limiting spur-of-the-moment use.  
- On the heavier side when fully filled, especially for smaller hands.  

**Competing Products**  
In the realm of cold brew coffee makers, there are a few contenders like the Takeya Deluxe and the Hario Mizudashi. The Takeya, for instance, is lighter and slightly easier to handle for frequent travel but sacrifices the upscale appearance of glass for BPA-free plastic. The Hario Mizudashi, meanwhile, is also a strong competitor in terms of aesthetic appeal, but the capacity is smaller, making it less practical for family gatherings or frequent hosting.

Comparatively, the NFFTYUUT coffee maker stands out for its larger capacity and premium materials. While the Takeya and Hario models may edge ahead in portability or specialty branding, this mason jar option is a real winner for at-home brewing and versatility.

**Affordable Quality**  
While I can‚Äôt disclose exact prices here, I believe the overall value of this brewer aligns with its features. Budget-friendly doesn‚Äôt mean cutting corners, and this product proves it. It‚Äôs well-suited for anyone looking to invest in a sturdy cold brew solution for everyday or occasional indulgence. Extra points for the reusable components, which add long-term appeal without increasing environmental waste.

Today for example, I had coffee (sometimes I drink two cups), a carrot, a bowl of potato soup with a slice of bread, and noodles with a bacon-onion-cream sauce. It's usually a home-cooked meal for dinner and I don‚Äôt hold back. I often eat three plates. I also usually have a chocolate bar or something else sweet during the day. Sometimes I don‚Äôt have snacks, only get up for coffee and wait/sleep until dinner.

1m37g5a,https://www.reddit.com/r/exmormon/comments/1m37g5a/coffee_and_parkinsons/,Coffee and Parkinson's,"Yesterday, I ran into an older non-member couple in their 70's. The wife taught my daughter in elementary school. She explained that her husband had had Parkinson's for the last 10 years (all symptoms present in appearance). It's been my experience that members who have never been coffee drinkers contract Parkinson's much earlier in life than actual coffee drinkers because 1) I've known members to get Parkinson's in their 60's, and 2) I've known non-members who were coffee drinkers and never got Parkinson's until their late 80's and early 90's. So, I asked her if her husband had been a coffee drinker. She said she was religiously, but no, he has never been a coffee drinker. Parkinson's runs in my husband's family. My husband is TBM and will not drink coffee. 

From parkinson.org:  
For years, drinking coffee has been associated with having a reduced risk of developing Parkinson's disease (PD). In fact, a 1968 study suggested that coffee drinkers were less like to get PD (Nefzger, Quadfasel, & Karl, 1968). Since then, multiple epidemiologic studies have confirmed the PD/coffee connection (Ascherio et al., 2003; Ascherio et al., 2004; Fujimaki et al., 2018). Researchers have mostly attributed the protective effect to the caffeine component (Lee et al., 2013).

However, coffee is more than a caffeine delivery system. Coffee has more than 1,000 different compounds, including organic acids, sugars, amino acids and fatty acids. One such fatty acid called Eicosanoyl-5-hydroxytryptamide (EHT) has been getting quite a bit of buzz in the PD research community; and, for good reason. A recently published study titled, ‚ÄúSynergistic neuroprotection by coffee components eicosanoyl-5-hydroxytryptamide and caffeine in models of Parkinson‚Äôs disease and DLB‚Äù (Yan et al., 2018), provides some compelling insights into the possible biochemical protective mechanisms of our cup of joe.

1m37frh,https://www.reddit.com/r/SGExams/comments/1m37frh/health_issues_is_ruining_me/,Health issues is ruining me,"Hi first time posting here + anonymous account. If you think yk me please don't try to find out.

Ok so, I'm 15 (female), 171cm, but I'm only 38kg max nowadays, sometimes lower. One thing about it my family is that they are all naturally skinny (I think because of metabolism) and have anemia. I haven't gotten tested but I think I probably also do have. The problem is, because of what i suspect is anemia, I have been feeling constantly nauseous and dizzy and fatigued and headache and when I stand up I always see the weird black spots jn my vision which has only gotten worse over the years to the point that my vision is 80-95% gone nowadays when I stand up, and it lasts for like 45 seconds which is way too long imo. Back in like 2018 (when I was 8) I also used to have fever every recess for like 30min daily which was when I first tried telling my symptoms to my mum but she brushed it off saying kids don't understand what being sick feels like. Nowadays I'm not a picky eater. I always finish everything in my plate even when I feel full until iw vomit, and I don't skip meals. Also I have never had any eating disorders before.

So more recently, like last year, I started going to McDonald's every day after school and I'd order a big burger and I'd just eat as I do my homework and revision and it worked quite well. I felt way better and I finally started to gain a little weight, and I stopped feeling so drained mentally and physically and I could actually focus on class more and not feel absolutely on the brink of passing out, which meant 4-5 meals a day, but I was still not even at 40kg. My mum however was not a big fan of this saying it was unhealthy which yes it could be but whenever I went for health checkups back then I had never been healthier. My mum also really hates when I go eat alone because she thinks that it makes me depressed or something when it actually helps me do my work better and I honestly don't like going out with friends all the time. 

At the start of this year my mum basically forbade me from eating outside alone but because no one eats like 4-5 meals a day I started rarely going to McDonald's after school to eat and I started feeling really bad again and lost a lot of weight. I also keep feeling really fatigued in class and basically kind of pass out asleep sometimes in class and I have been chugging caffeine to stay awake because I feel so horrible. On top of that, at around 9-10am in the morning I will randomly find it extremely difficult to breathe for around 10-20mins unless I lie down. When I went for a health checkup a few months ago the nurse said that I had really small bones which made me ""small"" despite my height, which makes sense because although I already look unhealthily skinny my bones aren't showing and you can't see my ribs either. I also found out I have extremely low blood pressure, and while low blood pressure is also something common in my family but mine is way too low.
It's really affecting my concentration because while everyone else is peacefully learning in class I have to fight the urge to throw up or pass out, and I have once or twice this year. It's excruciating trying to stay awake when I feel so sick in class, even if I get enough sleep the night before. I would do anything to be able to concentrate and get my grades back up again (since eoy is coming around) and to feel healthy again.

I am from a school which can be considered prestigious so I spend most of my time studying and I really can't find time to exercise or else I would have to sleep less, and I can't really make a whole meal for myself at home because it takes up time and my dad scolds me when I eat after mealtime (even if it just snacks or fruit) because if I were full from the meal I wouldn't need to eat 30 mins later. So the best I can do is eat outside or make smth small like a sandwich for myself.

The reason why I'm making this post is because today (I have hbl because oral) after breakfast, my mum told me to vacuum the house, and as I stand up from my bed I actually felt okay. But as I walked my vision became darker and darker with spots and my head tightened and I couldn't breathe that well and when I entered the storage unit after what felt like forever I freaking PASSED OUT but i didn't hit the floor because I just leaned on a shelf instead and I got up like 3 seconds after. It's only been getting worse so what should I do? How can I gain weight? I'm already taking iron supplements which make me feel slightly better but I really cannot keep drinking monster and like 3 cups of coffee a day.

I have a general question, it's not completely unfounded or unrelated to my actual working experience etc To give you a hint, my family owns a company that manufactures solar panels etc and has had dealings with the MENA and Eastern European world. 

My question is basically this, are there any people interested in investing in ""traditional"" industries anymore? What i mean by that, basically, i come from a country ( Greece ) with a long tradition of entrepreneurs who followed a certain pattern. The pattern was basically this : find an underdeveloped or emerging/frontier market/country, set up a trading company or factory there, export to the West, make profit, repeat. Many of my country's most legendary businessesmen of the past made their fortunes by getting involved in shipping, exporting foodstuff and agricultural products ( grains, meat, coffee, tobacco, cotton ) , construction and the 'infastructure sector' aka government contracts related to development of things like the electricity grid, water desalination, building roads - bridges etc Their countries' of operation were almost always in Africa and South America ( Argentina, Brazil, Egypt, Sudan, Malawi etc ). Is it me or do people nowadays stopped caring for these type of 'real business' ? Like, ask anybody in this subreddit or irl and their idea of a startup would probably something fashion, IT, social media related.

**\[Nero 039: Paint-it-Black\]**

Freya used the hand that was coated in sick, slick reaper fluid to make a painless psionic incision across his back like a surgeon with a scalpel. She carefully maneuvered around his sternum with minimum bone breakage or tissue tearage with her long, skinny fingers like five antennae probing and prodding her abductee. Once the black viscous venom reached his heart, he was a goner. His blood would slowly spread the painful poison throughout his body until he had become a reasonless, rabid creature that lashed out at everything. A Looper, who was trapped in his own body and in an endless cycle of mindless aggression followed by pitiful bouts of clarity. The only salvation he could hope for was to be put out of his misery by something or someone before he put them out of their misery with malice in his heart. It was dark. It was stark. A brutal reminder that there were fates in this cruel world that were worse than death.

The purple skin on Freya #1‚Äôs face simmered as the Reaper virus began to spread. She clasped her chest with her secondary pair of hands and coughed. This was it. After one last thrust, her duplicate would reach his heart and there would be no turning back. But then... *right there at that moment...* Right when her duplicate was a split second away from damaging his core. A voice reached out like a hand from the grave*.* It whispered to her soul to avoid startling her since her fingertips were a hair away from his heart. All it would take was one fearful shiver to cause infection.

***‚ÄúLet there be Darkness‚Ä¶‚Äù***

Freya‚Äôs eyes scrambled around in her head like two broken eggs. She recognized the voice almost immediately and refused to look down. Something far worse than wicked had just grabbed her attention. It darkened her morning and stole her spine as if she was a carcass. *‚ÄúNo! She‚Äôs going to kill me!!‚Äù* the first thought on her mind was God. The next instinctual cry was for her mother. Her frantic mental babblings were a moment of fidelity to fear and murder. ¬†¬†¬†¬†

A hand reached through the void like a hand from the grave and snatched her by the ankle... *the Lady‚Äôs* touch made her freeze and the hair on the back of her neck stand: *‚ÄúS-she‚Äôs here! No! I‚Äôm going to die!‚Äù* the little voice inside of her skull sliced and diced her brain. She shivered as another scream escaped from her subconscious. There was no place to run. There was no place to hide. She would find her wherever there was darkness.¬†¬†

***‚ÄúStop you‚Äôre whimpering before you infect the child!‚Äù***

Freya gasped at *her* shrieking words. What was once a nice fairy tale had become the place where nightmares came true. Bravery shredded under the blackened claws of this ghoulish creature until there was nothing left but the mangled corpse of cowardice.

*They* let go of her ankle after giving her a fair warning. Something began to rise from the vast whiteness of the temporal void like a wraith rising from its ghostly grave. The very dimensional fabric of space rippled like a pool of tainted holy water as its head came to the surface. The figure rose like a flower... blooming amidst the withered ashes of the faith. It stood behind Freya and remained about as silent and still as a dead man dangling from a noose.

Lady Darkness spread her mothlike wings and let go of the one who was hers to keep after carrying him through time and space like a tomb. Alas, those delicate, intricate, chitinous patterns were as mesmeric as four blinking eyes. With scales that were as hideous as dead butterfly wings. She was the night that chased away the light. The keeper of the bell from above that chimed at *nine.* *Six* when they were hidden far below in eternal darkness.

Freya melted like a warm chocolate bar. She tried to mask her fear, but her shaky knees and hurried breaths gave it away like laughter at a funeral. Her eyes were two dots darting around everywhere but behind her. You saw what she refused to see. The pale scaled woman with black, jagged teeth. The one who laid her head on his shoulder as her black claws sank into his chest like desire and morbidity. The two came together in morbid metamorphosis. She flapped her wings like a bone collector wearing the body parts of dead insects.

When Sensei finally raised his head, the only thing that was left of her were ashes. You could see remnants of what he had not consumed in his black eyes. Dark fragments of what remained from the collapsed dimension he had escaped... *Can you hear her?* *She can see you!* Dark **v**estiges of the rift leeched away at his smooth narrow face like a lich leaving dark entrails that were replaced by in-trails of fresh skin. Bones were made for gnawing and flesh was for chewing. Eschewing a good feast until the one who was protecting him had gotten used to this new place:

*‚ÄúI wouldn‚Äôt do that if I were you,‚Äù* he told Freya.

‚ÄúW-who, who are you?‚Äù Freya asked.

‚ÄúShe‚Äôs hungry,‚Äù he said with a mouth full of moths.

***‚ÄúLook away before I devour you next!‚Äù***

‚ÄúW-what was that?!‚Äù¬†Freya asked.

‚ÄúCareful now. Once she gets a taste, she won‚Äôt stop until she gets down to the bone,‚Äù Sensei said rather darkly, warning the girl to tread lightly.

The darkness that painted Sensei black hardened into a chrysalis before exploding into several hundred moths. They fanned out like an infection until all but one had disappeared into the vast whiteness of space. The one moth that remained behind landed atop his head. He took a sip of coffee from his mug without even noticing the inscrutable insect. After taking a few unnerving moments to savor the fresh taste of breakfast blend, he spoke, ‚ÄúLooks like I came just in time. As much as I‚Äôd like to see how this ends, we‚Äôre late for our appointment.‚Äù ¬†

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre not afraid of him are you?‚Äù Nero gasped.

*‚ÄúQuiet!‚Äù* Freya sneered while tightening her grip.

She took in her surroundings after her mind had finally escaped from the wreckage. The first thing she noticed was that her duplicate was gone. It had been swept aside by Darkness with the ease of a passing breeze. A catastrophe that made it difficult but not impossible to kill Nero. She couldn‚Äôt just summon a new one. It took a tremendous amount of energy and a time-consuming ritual to do so. There was only one option left. She would have to go post-physical.

The veins on the purple parts of her body tightened as she strained to control the spread of the Reaper mutation. Nodules boiled and throbbed on her face and neck. She pushed through the pain and into the grey area. Her eyes glowed as she reached over onto the other side of what was possible and began the process of shedding her mortal coil. This would release a terrible expulsion of energy that would destroy everything around her and more than likely kick you out of the story! Here we were again with her doing the most just to get rid of you and Nero. Interesting though... she was going to go post-physical? Right here and now? Really?

Yup! A third of them were able to leave their bodies behind before Atlantis was washed away into the sea by a wrathful God. The only problem with her trying to transform ‚Äúright here and now‚Äù was that she was essentially hitting the self-destruct button. Crystals were one of the few things that resonated in the post physical realm, and she was too far away from a hub to find her way back home. The Atlanteans had discovered this eons ago when they were first exploring their empath abilities. They incorporated a similar technology to build their crystal nexus when they made the fateful decision to go down the post physical path. Many more would have escaped if not for the fallen angel Ark Haven and his insidious machinations. Like always, he was up to no good and shared with them an alternative method they could use to achieve their goal.

His knowledge came with a terrible secret, but the Atlanteans were too blinded by hubris and ambition to see what he had done. What started as a supernal pursuit soon became an aberrant obsession. They paid the cost and nobly absorbed the loss inflicted upon their society again and again like a hammer blow. They studied and innovated. Built and traded. Several wars, plagues, and famines came to pass before they finally entered the Great Golden Age. A time of peace and prosperity that was spurred on by technology.

The crowning achievement was the Crystal Nexus. The greatest wonder the world has ever known. The tower reached through the clouds like the hand of a titan and blocked out the sun on one half of the City of Atlantis. Their greatness came with pitfall. They had strayed too far from the light. God had had enough and gave them one final warning. Cease tampering with nature or be destroyed. They couldn‚Äôt turn back now. Not when they were so close. They put *everything* they had into one final push and found themselves in the Great Dark Age.

It was a sorrowful state of being that lacked all the meaningful things that had once made them great. Trade, culture, prosperity, rights, everything had been pushed aside in the pursuit of one thing: becoming something more than flesh and blood. See. The terrible secret Ark Haven finally revealed to their Mother Queen was that it would take more than sweat and tears. Heh. That‚Äôs right. They were going to need human sacrifices if they wanted to see their dream through until the end. It was the only way to power the heart of their nexus. Many met their end in these sacrilegious experiments. Often horrible deaths, at the hands of otherworldly beings.

God had no choice. Their crimes against humanity could not go unpunished. And so, he summoned the Great Flood and washed their magnificent city down into the depths of the sea. Only a fraction of the population managed to escape into post physical form in time. As for the Atlanteans that survived the apocalyptic event but were unable to go post physical. They went on to become the Nephilim. Cannibals and cave dwellers who were far removed from the greatness of their ancestors. So deep was God‚Äôs grief, he made a covenant with Noah to never again destroy the world with water. He also forbade the technology conceived by the lost tribes of Atlantis.

\---

Nano was very interested in her transformation process. He studied what she was doing to free herself very carefully. It could be the missing key to their invasion. Dimensional space was like water and post physical was like oil. The two realms did not coexist so much as tolerate each other. Even the angels, who had come to dominate metaphysical space. Even they could not grasp the concept of the post physical and usually tended to ignore it altogether as some kind of distant ‚Äúunreality,‚Äù preferring to focus on hard trans dimensional reality instead, and the previously mentioned ‚Äúmeta-space,‚Äù where they had built their Kingdom of Heaven.

There was one creature who knew. She had infected every dimensional fiber with ink from her black tentacles. All had surrendered to her but heaven. Nano could ask him how she did it, but he was off limits‚Ä¶ *she* had taken him for herself. A sickly smirk withered across his face. His dark hair flowed like black curtains in the killing fields. Lady Darkness was in his eyes, a glint with a hint that told the frightened Atlantean in no uncertain terms, ‚ÄúPlay and you die.‚Äù

‚ÄúW-what did you say?‚Äù Freya asked.

‚ÄúI said, sorry about your clone. I know how long it takes to make a new one. *We* had to do something to stop you from killing my student,‚Äù he said in his usual cool manner even going so far as to steal a sip of coffee afterwards. He stood there for a moment studying the desperation in his victim‚Äôs eyes, saying, ‚ÄúYou came here to deliver a message.‚Äù

‚ÄúH-how did you know?‚Äù she asked.

‚ÄúLet‚Äôs just say I had a hunch.‚Äù

I (27F), have two younger sisters (both 22) and we are all really close to one another, especially after our parents divorced when we were young (they're in good terms now so not a lot of drama between them).

A few months ago I found out that one of my sisters got into a relationship with a man, let's call him Eddy, and when I found out that he was 11 years older than her I immediately became very suspicious and just couldn't accept that age difference at all (in case anyone starts assuming I'm jealous, I'm currently married and have a 1 year age gap with my husband). I let my sister know that this gap is too big for her and that she should find someone closer to her age, but she insists that Eddy is a good person and treats her well. What upsetted me more was the fact that she was in a relationship with Eddy for around a year and I didn't know about it. 

Out of concern for her I told my parents about the relationship and both of them were not accepting of the age gap. Even though the three of us did talk to her about it, she remained stubborn and did not listen to us; the only one who defended her was her twin sister, saying if she's happy then let her be happy. 

Eventually she convinced us to meet Eddy in person and even told us that if they didn't like him after they met him, she'll leave him. We agreed.

Eddy eventually came to our house, and my only first impression of him was that he looked younger than his age and that's it. It was a very awkward atmosphere, but Eddy apparently was well composed and told us about himself: he's an accountant and is currently studying for an MBA at the same university where my sister is currently attending, and they met at a coffee shop close to the campus where they both frequent to study and work (his job is fully remote), and I was surprised to find out that it was my sister who approached Eddy, not the other way around (this isn't the first time she approached older guys, she once approached a 24 year old when she was 16 and I made her stop seeing him, even threatened to call the police on the man). Eddy confessed that he was at first hesitant because of the gap but he then decided to give it a chance, and both looked very comfortable with one another. I asked Eddy if he was ever in a relationship with someone his age, and he said that he was, he told us that he almost got engaged to his ex (3 years younger), but she called things off at the last minute because she mentally wasn't ready for marriage.

Eventually my parents warmed up to him but I wasn't convinced. After Eddy left I tried talking to my sister alone and told her that she needed someone closer to her age and not him, as people his age could easily take advantage of younger girls like her and that the dynamic would ruin her life, I even had to threaten to cut our relationship completely when she doesn't end her relationship because she wouldn't listen. She eventually became very annoyed and told me to stay out of her business.

Our relationship wasn't the same after that and to this day I do not accept her relationship with him, not out of jealousy but out of fear that she may be taken advantage of by this much older person. AITA?",2,1752857140.0,AITAH,59,0.55,False

1m37c83,https://www.reddit.com/r/CoffeeBrewerReviews/comments/1m37c83/discover_if_holstein_housewares_5cup_coffee_maker/,Discover if Holstein Housewares 5-Cup Coffee Maker lives up to its glowing reviews!,"**Everyday Experience with the Holstein Housewares HH-0914701E - 5 Cup Drip Coffee Maker**  

Getting hands-on with the Holstein Housewares HH-0914701E coffee maker has been an interesting journey. This nifty, teal-colored 5-cup drip coffee maker became a staple on my kitchen counter, blending its vibrant hue with functionality. With its space-saving design, it snugly fit into my tiny kitchen, leaving enough room for other essentials. The first few days, I wondered if the compact design would compromise its performance, but this handy machine quickly proved it could punch above its weight.  

**Compact Design and Aesthetic Appeal**  
One thing that you can't miss is its eye-catching teal shade. The glossy finish is both modern and playful, so it doesn't just sit on the countertop‚Äîit gives your kitchen a cute pop of color. Measuring approximately 6x8x9.76 inches, this appliance was clearly designed for small kitchens, apartments, or even offices where counter space is a luxury. For such a compact machine, its borosilicate glass carafe feels surprisingly durable; I‚Äôve accidentally knocked it against the sink a couple of times without a single scratch!  

**Highlights**  
- Compact dimensions fit smoothly into tight spaces.  
- Glass carafe with clear level indicators for precision.  
- Bold and fun teal design adds charm to any kitchen d√©cor.

**Performance and Brewing Quality**  
I‚Äôm more of a ""coffee but not quite connoisseur"" type, but taste matters, right? This little machine delivers a freshly brewed, rich-tasting cup that holds its ground against more expensive counterparts. With a single power button, operation couldn‚Äôt be easier‚Äîeven my perpetually groggy partner manages to make coffee without incident. The auto-pause feature (seriously, why don‚Äôt all coffee makers have this?) lets you sneak a cup without waiting for the brew to finish. It‚Äôs a lifesaver on rushed mornings.  

The reusable cone filter is a game-changer too. No more hunting for paper filters or filling your trash bin with unnecessary waste. Plus, cleaning the filter is a breeze‚Äîit takes just a quick rinse compared to the endless scrubbing of some other machines I‚Äôve used.  

**Convenience Features**  
The machine packs some thoughtful functions, like the keep-warm mode, which ensures coffee stays hot for when life inevitably distracts you. Auto-pause and serve? A dream for multi-taskers like me who can‚Äôt sit around waiting for coffee to brew. However, you need to be careful not to overfill the water reservoir since the included water level indicator, while clear, isn‚Äôt 100% foolproof when you‚Äôre in a hurry.  

**Merits**  
- Auto-pause feature allows mid-brew coffee grabs.  
- Keep-warm function ensures hot coffee without haste.  
- Reusable cone filter saves money and reduces waste.  

**Shortcomings**  
- Limited brewing capacity is fine for 1‚Äì2 people but falls short for gatherings.  
- Water indicator isn‚Äôt the easiest to read in low light.  
 
**Safety and Maintenance**  
Based on my experience, the anti-drip design works perfectly‚Äîno messy countertops after removing the carafe. Safety-wise, the base stays cool during operation, so accidental burns aren‚Äôt an issue. Cleaning the unit is quick and easy thanks to its removable filter basket and wipe-friendly surfaces. I‚Äôve had machines before with too many nooks and crannies that made cleaning frustrating, but this one was surprisingly effortless.  

One minor critique would be the carafe lid feels a tad flimsy when you‚Äôre giving it a deep clean. It hasn't broken, but I tread cautiously while washing it.  

**Competing Products**  
Comparing this coffee maker to an equally compact model like the Mr. Coffee 5-Cup Coffee Maker, some differences are apparent. The Holstein model wins in the aesthetics department with its vibrant color, while the Mr. Coffee is a bit more utilitarian in its design. When it comes to brewing quality, both machines deliver decent pots, though the reusable filter in this machine earns points for being eco-conscious. The latter model, however, has a slightly larger carafe and a more visible water window, making it better for those hosting guests.  

**Quality for Price**  
For an affordable price point, this coffee maker delivers well above expectations. Its features like the reusable filter, auto-pause, and compact design make it a fantastic option for those who need an everyday coffee solution rather than something overly fancy. What you won‚Äôt get here is an advanced programmable timer or high-capacity brewing, but considering the practicality and vibrant design, it feels like a smart purchase.

He has Ms and a broken back can't walk or stand but uses a wheel chair and is able to drive. 5 years ago, maybe more now? We moved to a house designed for him. Everything is very low so me and my mum gave up our own back health lol (we are 6ft) so he was able to use everything, but he doesn't? He doesn't do the dishwasher ever because he can't reach, but if his mates are round he will get cups out etc to make them coffee. If he comes home with shopping he'll just leave it on the side for us to put away, again because he can't reach but is always able to get food out for himself from the same cupboards. He leaves everything on the sides dirty dishes, bogeys (he can't get tissue??? Ew), old food, the living room table is covered in his rubbish because he can't get to the bin which he is literally at if he turns around. 

When I was younger he always tried to teach me when my mum was at work as she was always the one who earnt the money that is was my job to do the cleaning etc before he was in a wheelchair. He's also not very nice, when I was 13 - 17 he would emotionally torment me and say I would be gaslighting him because my brother would say I didn't hit him when my dad would go on a tangent about me attacking my brother which would leave us both confused? and he'd threaten to throw and would wave pots and pans at me which has lead to them all being dented now.

I just need support and idk who to speak to because I just get dirty looks if I try to reach out to friends because he's disabled but I dont know how to get across to them he is capable because he does archery 4-5 times a week and goes out for breakfast with his friends and if vert active, he just refuses to clean, not once on my life even before the accident or onset of MS has I ever seen him clean anything, wash his hands or do the laundry ",6,1752856993.0,disability,1,0.88,False

Limescale buildup can affect the taste of your drinks and even reduce the kettle's efficiency. But don't worry, descaling is easy and can be done with common household items like vinegar or lemon juice.

Let's start with vinegar, which is my go-to method. First, mix equal parts water and white vinegar in your kettle. Fill it about halfway, as the solution will bubble up when heated. Turn on the kettle and let it boil. Once it's done, unplug it and let the mixture sit for about 20 minutes. This gives the vinegar time to break down the limescale. After that, pour out the solution and rinse the kettle thoroughly. You might need to repeat this process if there's a lot of buildup.

Now, if you're not a fan of the vinegar smell, lemon juice is a great alternative. It works similarly and leaves a fresher scent. For this method, squeeze the juice of one or two lemons into your kettle and add water until it's half full. Boil the mixture, let it sit for about 20 minutes, then rinse well.

Both methods are effective, but I find vinegar works best for heavy buildup. Lemon juice is great for regular maintenance and lighter descaling jobs.

After descaling, it's important to run a cycle or two with just plain water to ensure all traces of vinegar or lemon are gone. This prevents any residual taste in your next cup of tea or coffee.

Regular descaling keeps your kettle working efficiently and extends its lifespan. I usually do this every month or two, depending on how hard the water is in my area and how often I use the kettle.

Speaking of kettles, I recently upgraded mine to a more efficient model. If you're in the market for a new electric kettle, I found a great selection at https://athometouch.com/Electric-Kettle. They have some models that are designed to resist limescale buildup, which can make maintenance even easier.

Remember, a clean kettle means better-tasting drinks and a longer-lasting appliance. Whether you choose vinegar or lemon juice, regular descaling is a simple task that pays off in the long run. It's an easy way to keep your morning routine smooth and your drinks tasting great.",1,1752856950.0,LivingEssentials,0,1.0,False

Freya closed her eyes and took a breath in solemnity. Their Sensei was right. She wasn‚Äôt here to fight. She had come here to deliver a message. The purple blotches on her face began to settle when she opened her eyes. She released her hold on Nero and stared at him. A mixture of hatred and sadness swirled aimlessly in her eyes as she watched him crumple to the floor, utterly beaten and broken by his near-death experience. Her sadness turned to shock. Just a second ago he was injured and defeated, but now he was hell-bent and strong-minded.

The beast inside Nero stirred. Claw marks mutilated and tore at his stomach and chest. It ripped him apart from the inside and tried desperately to escape from its fragile mortal coil. Lumps and bumps moved and grooved up and down his neck and face. A massive sharklike jaw snapped and lashed out from his right arm and then shoulder. He looked up at Sensei with malic before those same hungry shark eyes roamed her way. Nothing could dampen his spirit. He was the Beast. The monster struggled to stay inside. It pulled and stretched at his skin and chewed at his bones like a crazed demon dog. He jumped to his feet, raised his fist at her, and shouted, ‚ÄúHey! You‚Äôre not scared are you? You better not be! Are you listening to me?!‚Äù

When she just stood there guilty as charged, he took her silence to mean only one thing. She was indeed terrified of Sensei. He sneered at him and took a moment to detest the way he just stood there sipping coffee like they were harmless pups. *Err!* He was going to show this arrogant jerk who was boss one day. Him and that ugly hag that gave him nightmares. The thought burned his brain as he scowled at Freya and fed her a nasty growl. *Err!* It triggered him down to his core to see her like this. She had never backed down from a fight! Never! *Err!*

Sensei smirked at him and said, ‚ÄúYou worry too much.‚Äù

‚ÄúGah! W-who do you think you are?! You better not lay a finger on her or...‚Äù he shouted at him in a very waning tone, revealing his own shaky boots.

‚ÄúOr you‚Äôll kill me, huh?‚Äù Sensei asked rather insidiously.

Nero backed off, ‚ÄúUh, yeah, something like that.‚Äù

*Err!* His cowardice triggered Freya down to her core. She fed him the same dirty growl he had fed her for backing down to his Sensei. *Err!* What the hell was he doing shaking in his boots? He had taken more than his fair share of beatings over the years. Some deserved and others really deserved, but one thing always remained true. He had never backed down from a fight! Never! *Err!*

Their antics made you reexamine Sensei. You watched in horror as the shadows coiled and uncoiled from around the edges of pale face. ***They*** made eye contact with you... the descent into those two bottomless pits was trance inducing. *Can you hear her?* She wants you to join them. Luckily for you, Lenda‚Äôs sudden mad dash over towards them stopped you from falling into the abyss. She hopped and skipped over there in joyful deliverance, like he was her hero. While you treaded carefully and soon found yourself over there with them.

Freya took a moment to study you more closely. Huh. Maybe she should have done that before she tried to blast you away. The first thing that stuck out about her was her height. She was even taller than initially thought, maybe about six feet seven inches give or take. And more slender, too. Her secondary pair of arms were crossed across her decorated breastplate, which was even more elaborate and elegant than narrated. It was impossible to encompass who she was without a worthy comparison. A metaphorical hammer that really hit the head of the literary nail. Okay, let‚Äôs see. You could have easily mistaken her for a high elf if she hadn‚Äôt made it clear that she was an Atlantean. There were also some strong Amazonian and Valkyrie vibes. So, if you took all three of these fantastical ingredients and shoved them into the world‚Äôs sturdiest mixing bag, added a pinch of salt, honey, and fairy dust, and then violently *shook* it until it exploded, you‚Äôd get Freya.

The more she stared at you the more you could tell that she was ashamed of her conduct. That she was suffering mightily under the crushing weight of her own mixed emotions. The only way to break free from the burden would be to seek clarity from a scribe. Because on the one hand, she really did want to escort you off the page, but you know, on the other hand, she really had no business trying to pry the book from your fingers; it wasn‚Äôt very superheroine-like.

Something else that caught your attention was the jewelry worn on her sleeveless primary right arm. One bracelet was the most beautiful of them all. It shimmered and glimmered even brighter now that she was in turmoil. You could *feel* her emotions. Her inner voice spoke to you like a soft ping, with sincerity and empathy. Not with words but sensations. *‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry,‚Äù* was the energy that escaped from her gentle heart, also, *‚ÄúI wish you a good life, friend.‚Äù*

She blushed angrily and covered her empath bracelet with her other hand after that last feeling escaped. Then she lowered her head so she wouldn‚Äôt have to look at anyone else. That way she could avoid another embarrassing subliminal slip. Her demeanor shifted when she turned her attention to Sensei. Nervousness shook her voice as she shuffled over her words like a rambler: ‚ÄúYou are right. I was told to deliver a message on behalf of the Holy Order. They ask that you deal with one of your own before we are forced to deal with him. The offender in question is a fiend known as Maggot Man. Those who are of your ilk should be dealt with by those who are of your ilk. We would rather not sully our hands in the affairs of the wicked.‚Äù

‚ÄúI know who that is,‚Äù Sensei said.

‚ÄúGood. You have seven days.‚Äù

‚ÄúWe‚Äôll get around to it, right now we‚Äôre late for an appointment.‚Äù

‚ÄúThe task at the wicked temple of the faithless?‚Äù Freya asked.

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs not the right name for it, but yes,‚Äù he smirked, darkly.

‚ÄúI‚Ä¶ I can take you to your temple of sin if necessary,‚Äù she said.

‚ÄúNo thank you but thank you for the gesture of course.‚Äù

‚ÄúVery well,‚Äù she replied, much relieved but still shaking.

‚ÄúNow, my dear, if you‚Äôd be kind enough to release us from your trap, we‚Äôll be out of your hair,‚Äù he said before taking a moment to admire the vast whiteness of space.

‚ÄúI will once you get from behind me.‚Äù

‚ÄúForgive me. That was very ungentlemanly,‚Äù he said before taking a step back from the unknown and making himself known. Deciding to stand next to you and Lenda and sip breakfast blend while holding his ‚Äútrashy‚Äù NWO mug like a killer holding a knife. The way Freya instinctively flinched at his taxidermic presence. It dug up memories he thought he had buried in the grave. ‚ÄúTell them I said hello over on the other side. If things were slightly different, I‚Äôm sure we‚Äôd get along.‚Äù

‚ÄúCurse you,‚Äù she muttered back.

‚ÄúHeh. Too late,‚Äù he smirked.¬†

\---

Freya closed her eyes and took several labored breaths. The empath bracelet on her arm shimmered as soon as she thought about Nero. It was like opening a time capsule. Memories that felt like dreams. Nothing lasts forever, especially a time that was so perfect and sweet it made her say the magic words, ‚ÄúI wish it could be like this forever.‚Äù A tear slipped down her check when she *finally* opened her eyes and let go. One more deep breath. ‚ÄúYou got this,‚Äù she told herself right before raising her hand towards heaven and calling upon God:

*‚ÄúGrant us safe passage into the sea of light.‚Äù* ¬†

The world around you slowly turned grey until it was one giant storm cloud. There was another more sudden shift in the atmosphere. Something big was about to happen... *you could feel it in your bones.* Thick bands of rain wrapped around in all directions like a hurricane. You looked over at Freya, right into those enchanting emerald eyes. Her long flowing hair stood on end under the static bend of the weather. She lowered her hand, and the lightning strikes started. ¬†

The world around you was spinning and thundering. Things were out of control like a ship without a captain caught in a deadly storm. The whiteness of space imploded with every thunderclap. It felt like you were in a giant snow globe that had been shaken and then thrown into four-dimensional space. It was crazy! The speed at which you traveled was incalculable. It felt like you were riding on the most dangerous rollercoaster in the galaxy. That was just the climb up! When the dimensional rift reached the top, it slowed down and began to rotate like a planet. Then, right before you could get a grip, the snow globe-coaster of destruction went into this massive drop that felt like a broken space elevator freefalling down into the atmosphere.

Even though you were being slapped dizzy like a pinball, everyone else seemed to be enjoying the turbulent ride. Lenda danced and had the time of her life. She was nice enough to offer her arm for support when she saw you wobbling like a wombat. Nero stared at Freya and wondered if there was any way he could ever make things right. Nano kept his distance, analyzing everything with folded arms. While Sensei causally sipped coffee under an impossible amount of pressure.

The ride had finally come to an end. The world was spinning, and your ears were ringing. Oh my. What a nauseating affair. You looked around only to realize that you were back in the circle drive, standing in front of that same stupid water fountain like nothing had ever happened. Freya was gone. All that was left was the memory of her trying to boot you from the story. You bumped into Lenda, which made her look over and ask, ‚ÄúHey, are you alright? Freya... she *really* did it. She attacked you. What the hell, right? Like, I‚Äôve *never* seen that before.‚Äù

‚ÄúAhem. Let‚Äôs not encourage violence,‚Äù Sensei said.

He stood there with his hands in his pockets, studying the gargoyle statue. The arm holding the crown was broken. The pieces now resting at the bottom of the basin. He raised his hand to take a sip of coffee only to realize his mug was missing. ‚ÄúGreat. What else can go wrong?‚Äù ¬†

‚ÄúOh my ungoodness! You‚Äôre so funny!‚Äù Lenda simpered.

‚ÄúThank you. I guess,‚Äù Sensei said with a raised eyebrow.

She gave him a big hug and said, ‚ÄúThanks for saving us!‚Äù

‚ÄúI also thank you,‚Äù Nano said as he rejoined the group.¬† ¬†¬†¬†

‚ÄúWhatever, I had it covered,‚Äù Nero grumbled jealously.

Sensei studied his student for a moment and even allowed a tiny bit of pride to escape from his otherwise steely demeaner. He looked over at you to make sure you were seeing this. That‚Äôs right. If you hadn‚Äôt been there to see it for yourself, you would have never known that Nero came *this close* to suffering a horrible fate. You saw what his Sensei was focusing on and did the same, zooming in on the hand that was wrapped in bandages. You know, the one he burned after recklessly using heavenly hellfire to ignite the mulberry tree.

Before you could get it out, well, you couldn‚Äôt get it out because you couldn‚Äôt speak. Seeing this, Sensei spoke for you: ‚ÄúHey. Nero.‚Äù

‚ÄúYeah?‚Äù he asked.

‚ÄúCheck it out.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat? My hand?‚Äù he asked.

‚ÄúYou haven‚Äôt noticed?‚Äù

He quickly unwrapped the cloth from around his hand and saw that the wound had completely healed. He gave you all one of those patented, wry Nero smirks before striking his palm with his freshly healed fist. The flames in his eyes matched his scathing tone: ‚ÄúThe Reaper fire... it must‚Äôve made me stronger. Heh. I told you I‚Äôd win.‚Äù He put his fist in your face before having the nerve to sneer at you, ‚ÄúHeh. Still think I‚Äôm a kid playing with fire?‚Äù

I have some experience in cheap eating, I even made excel back in time.

In fact, this is not that expensive as you think. We need prot, carbs lipid and ofc a bunch of vitamins and minerals. All in certain proportion.

Basically here are the main ingredients I use

In the morning :
Oats (good prot/carb ratio, good for diet if you eat them raw) with 1/2 water 1/2 milk 
Eggs (just once a week for morning Sunday usually)
Banana/Apple/Orange, depending on season/prices 
A coffee made √† l'italienne, the famous typical machine, with grain I grind myself (it's cheaper).

In the afternoon.

Croque monsieur (the hamburger of the french) : ham + cheese between two slices of bread, one slice of tomato (cooked then placed inside). Sometime adding an eeg on the top. Some salad with vinegar.

Ketchup if no egg. I do not like to mix ketchup and eggs.

Le quatre heure (the snack) - could vary highly but general a simple fruit or a biscuit 

Night 

Usually soupe √† l'oignon (oignon soup), or chicken soup.
I always bought full chicken, cut them in part and put them in the freezer as it's cheaper. Then I use the bones to make my soup with carrots ü•ï potatoes ü•î oignon garlic. With bread.

One or two bottle of red wine per month and 1 beer per week. Lens, pork, jam, pasta, tomato sauce, anchois and other stuff I don't listed (because I didn't eat the same menu every day you can imagine)

I spended less than 100 euro per month INCLUDING cleaning products.

It was in 2020 so today's price of that will be maybe 150, but not more.

So when I see so much American complaining that they spend 300-500$ / month for food, I just don't understand.

Here how are you dealing with the groceries?

# Best Water Filter System for Camper [2025 Guide]

A clean and reliable water source is paramount for any camper,ensuring both health and enjoyment during your travels. untreated water can harbor harmful bacteria, viruses, and sediment, leading to illness and unpleasant experiences. A quality water filter system for your camper provides peace of mind, delivering safe and grate-tasting water for drinking, cooking, and showering. This guide explores the best water filter systems for campers in 2025, highlighting top contenders and key features to help you make an informed decision.

## Key Features Analysis

The selection of a suitable water filter system hinges on several key features that differentiate models and address various needs.

**Filtration Capacity:** Understanding the capacity of a water filter system is crucial for extended trips. A higher capacity translates to more gallons of filtered water before requiring replacement or cleaning.

The filtration capacity is typically measured in gallons or liters,indicating the total volume of water the filter can effectively process before its performance degrades. Some filters boast capacities of up to 20,000 gallons, which can last for multiple camping seasons. Others might have smaller capacities, suitable for shorter trips or smaller campers with less water consumption. Choosing the right capacity ensures consistent water quality and reduces the frequency of maintenance.

**Filtration stages:** Multi-stage filtration systems offer a more comprehensive approach to water purification. Each stage is designed to remove specific contaminants, resulting in cleaner and safer water.

A typical multi-stage system might include a sediment filter to remove particulate matter like sand and rust, followed by an activated carbon filter to eliminate chlorine, VOCs (volatile organic compounds), and unpleasant tastes and odors. Some systems incorporate a KDF (Kinetic Degradation Fluxion) filter to inhibit bacteria growth and reduce heavy metals. More advanced systems may also include ultraviolet (UV) sterilization to kill bacteria and viruses. The combination of these stages provides a robust defense against a wide range of water contaminants.

**Flow Rate:** The flow rate determines how quickly the water filter system can deliver filtered water. A higher flow rate is essential for satisfying multiple users or filling large containers without significant delays.

Flow rate is typically measured in gallons per minute (GPM). A flow rate of 2 GPM might be sufficient for a small camper with minimal water demands, while a larger RV with multiple occupants may require 4 GPM or higher to ensure adequate water pressure for showers and simultaneous use of multiple fixtures.look for filters that maintain a consistent flow rate even as the filter becomes loaded with sediment and contaminants.

**portability & Installation:** Camper water filter systems vary widely in their portability and ease of installation. Some are designed for permanent installation within the camper's plumbing system, while others are portable and can be easily connected to an external water source.

Permanent systems often require professional installation and may take up more space within the camper. Portable systems, on the other hand, are typically easier to set up and can be moved between different campsites or even used at home. Consider the available space in your camper, your plumbing skills, and your willingness to undertake installation tasks before deciding between a permanent or portable system.

**Filter Replacement & Maintenance:** All water filter systems require periodic maintenance, including filter replacement or cleaning. The frequency of maintenance depends on the filter type, the water quality, and the amount of water filtered.

Some filters are designed for easy replacement,with spin-on cartridges that can be changed in a matter of minutes. Others may require more complex procedures and specialized tools. Consider the cost of replacement filters and the convenience of the maintenance process before making a purchase. Opt for filters with readily available replacement cartridges and clear instructions for maintenance.

**Certifications:** Autonomous certifications, such as those from NSF International, provide assurance that a water filter system meets specific performance standards and has been tested for safety and effectiveness.

NSF certifications indicate that the filter has been rigorously tested and verified to reduce specific contaminants to acceptable levels. Look for filters that are certified to NSF/ANSI standards 42 and 53, which cover aesthetic effects (taste, odor, chlorine reduction) and health effects (reduction of lead, cysts, vocs), respectively.These certifications provide peace of mind that the filter will perform as advertised and provide safe drinking water.

## Core Benefits

A quality water filtration system delivers a multitude of benefits, enhancing the camping experience and promoting better health.

**Improved Taste & Odor:** Filtering out chlorine, sediment, and other impurities significantly improves the taste and odor of your camper's water. This enhances the enjoyment of drinking water,coffee,and other beverages.

Many municipal water sources contain chlorine and other chemicals designed to disinfect the water supply. While these chemicals are effective at killing bacteria, they can also impart an unpleasant taste and odor. A water filter system effectively removes these chemicals, resulting in water that is cleaner, fresher, and more palatable. This is especially beneficial for those who are sensitive to the taste of chlorine or other chemical additives.

**Protection From Harmful Contaminants:** Water filters remove or reduce dangerous contaminants like bacteria, viruses, heavy metals, and pesticides, safeguarding your health while on the road.

Campers frequently enough rely on water sources that may not be as rigorously tested or treated as municipal water supplies. These sources may contain harmful bacteria, viruses, or parasites that can cause gastrointestinal illness. A water filter system provides a crucial barrier against these contaminants, ensuring that the water you drink and use for cooking is safe and healthy. Some filters are specifically designed to remove lead and other heavy metals, which can be particularly dangerous for children and pregnant women.

**Prolonged Appliance Life:** Filtered water minimizes the buildup of mineral deposits in water heaters,coffee makers,and other appliances,extending their lifespan and reducing maintenance costs.

Hard water, which is common in many camping areas, contains high levels of calcium and magnesium. These minerals can accumulate inside water heaters, coffee makers, and other appliances, forming scale that reduces efficiency and can eventually lead to failure. A water filter system removes or reduces these minerals, preventing scale buildup and prolonging the life of your appliances. This not only saves money on repairs and replacements but also ensures that your appliances operate at their peak performance.

**Enhanced Showering Experience:** A whole-camper filter system prevents hard water stains and provides softer, cleaner water for showering, resulting in healthier skin and hair.

Hard water can wreak havoc on skin and hair, causing dryness, irritation, and even hair loss.The minerals in hard water react with soap to form a film that can be tough to rinse off, leaving skin feeling tight and itchy and hair feeling dull and lifeless. A whole-camper filter system removes or reduces these minerals, providing softer, cleaner water for showering. This results in healthier, more moisturized skin and smoother, more manageable hair.

## FAQs Section

Addressing common queries to ensure the best user experience.

**What type of filter system is best for my camper?**
The best type of filter system depends on your specific needs and camping habits. If you primarily camp in areas with known water quality issues, a multi-stage system with advanced filtration capabilities is recommended. For shorter trips or when water quality is generally good, a basic inline filter may suffice. Consider your water consumption, available space, and budget when making your decision.

**How often should I replace my camper‚Äôs water filter?**
The frequency of filter replacement depends on the type of filter, the water quality, and your water consumption. Most manufacturers provide guidelines for filter replacement, typically measured in gallons or months. It's crucial to monitor the performance of your filter and replace it when it starts to lose effectiveness or when recommended by the manufacturer. Keeping a log of your water usage can definitely help you estimate when a replacement is due.

**Can I use a standard home filter in my camper?**
While it's possible to use a standard home filter in a camper, it may not be the most practical or effective solution. Home filters are frequently enough designed for different flow rates and water pressures than those typically found in campers. Additionally, they may not be as portable or durable as filters specifically designed for RV use.It's generally recommended to use a filter system that is specifically designed for campers to ensure optimal performance and compatibility.

**How do I sanitize my camper's water system after installing a filter?**
Sanitizing your camper's water system is essential to remove any bacteria or contaminants that may have accumulated in the pipes and tanks. A common method involves using a bleach solution. First, drain the entire system, then add a mix of 1/4 cup of household bleach per 15 gallons of water to your fresh water tank. Run the solution through all faucets and shower heads until you smell bleach.Let it sit for at least four hours,then drain and flush the system with fresh water until the bleach smell is gone.Be sure to follow all safety precautions when handling bleach.

## Key Features Analysis

The effectiveness and longevity of a copper water bottle depend heavily on its core features. Evaluating these details is paramount before making a purchase.

**Purity of Copper:** The most critical aspect of a copper water bottle is the purity of the copper used in its construction. A bottle claiming to be ""pure copper"" should ideally be made of at least 99% copper.Impurities can not only diminish the purported health benefits but also compromise the taste of the water or introduce harmful substances. Many manufacturers list the percentage of copper used; verifying this information is essential.Checking certifications or lab test results, if available, provides additional assurance of purity.**Construction and Leak-Proof Design:** The bottle's construction significantly impacts its durability and usability. Seamless construction, achieved thru techniques like hydroforming or advanced welding, minimizes the risk of leaks and cracks. A robust, leak-proof lid is equally critical. Look for lids with silicone gaskets or O-rings,as these provide a reliable seal. The lid material should also be durable and BPA-free. A well-engineered bottle will withstand daily wear and tear without leaking, ensuring hassle-free use.

**Capacity and Size:** Copper water bottles come in various sizes, ranging from small, portable options (around 500ml) to larger bottles suitable for all-day hydration (up to 1 liter or more). Choose a capacity that aligns with your daily water intake needs and lifestyle. Smaller bottles are ideal for carrying in a bag or taking to the gym, while larger bottles are better suited for desk use or longer outings. Consider the bottle's dimensions and weight when full to ensure it's comfortable to carry and handle.

**Interior Lining (or Lack Thereof):** Some copper water bottles feature an interior lining, typically made of stainless steel or tin. The lining can protect the copper from reacting directly with acidic beverages, preventing copper leaching and preserving the original taste of the water.  However, some users prefer unlined bottles to fully embrace the purported health benefits of copper. Consider the trade-offs carefully: an unlined bottle may require more frequent cleaning and careful handling of beverages whereas a lined bottle might diminish the purported beneficial properties of copper.

**Ergonomics and Grip:** A comfortable grip enhances the overall user experience. Look for bottles with textured surfaces or ergonomic designs that provide a secure hold, even when wet. Some bottles feature recessed areas or silicone sleeves that improve grip and prevent slippage. The shape of the bottle should also be ergonomically sound, allowing for easy pouring and drinking. Evaluating the grip is especially significant for active users or those with mobility limitations.**Cleaning and Maintenance:**  Copper is prone to tarnishing and oxidation, so proper cleaning and maintenance are essential.  Consider bottles with wide mouths for easier cleaning access. Unlined copper bottles require more specialized cleaning with natural solutions like lemon juice and salt to remove tarnish. Ensure the bottle can be thoroughly cleaned and dried to prevent bacterial growth. Avoid using harsh chemicals or abrasive cleaners,as these can damage the copper.

## Core Benefits

Using a copper water bottle offers several potential benefits, though it's crucial to acknowledge that many are based on traditional practices and anecdotal evidence rather than conclusive scientific studies.

**Potential Antimicrobial properties:** Copper possesses known antimicrobial properties. Some researchers believe that storing water in a copper vessel can help kill or inhibit the growth of harmful bacteria, viruses, and fungi. While not a substitute for proper water filtration or purification methods, using a copper water bottle may offer an additional layer of protection against waterborne pathogens. This makes it potentially beneficial for travelers or those concerned about water quality.

**Possible Immune System Support:** Proponents of Ayurvedic medicine claim that copper-infused water can definitely help strengthen the immune system. Copper is an essential trace mineral that plays a role in various bodily functions, including immune cell advancement and function. By regularly consuming water stored in a copper bottle, individuals might receive a small, supplemental dose of copper that could contribute to overall immune system health. This is especially appealing to health-conscious individuals.

**Enhanced digestion:** Some users report improved digestion after drinking water stored in a copper bottle. Copper is believed to stimulate peristalsis (the rhythmic contractions that move food through the digestive tract) and aid in the breakdown of food. It may also help reduce inflammation in the digestive system and promote the absorption of nutrients. Individuals experiencing mild digestive issues might find that using a copper bottle provides some relief.

**Alkalizing Effect:** While not definitively proven, some proponents suggest that copper may impart a slight alkalizing effect on water.Alkaline water is believed to help balance the body's pH levels and offer various health benefits. It's critically important to note that the actual change in pH is highly likely small and its impact is debated within the scientific community. However, individuals interested in alkaline water may find this an additional appealing feature.

**Sustainable and Eco-Pleasant:** Copper water bottles are reusable and can definitely help reduce reliance on single-use plastic bottles. This aligns with a growing desire for more sustainable and eco-conscious consumer choices. by opting for a durable copper bottle, individuals can actively contribute to reducing plastic waste and promoting environmental duty. This is a considerable draw for individuals with eco-friendly lifestyles.

## FAQs Section

**How frequently enough should I clean my copper water bottle?**
The frequency of cleaning depends on the type of bottle and its usage. Unlined copper bottles should be cleaned every few days to prevent tarnishing and remove any buildup. Lined bottles may require less frequent cleaning, perhaps once a week. Always wash your bottle promptly when visible residue is present due to beverages other than water.**Can I use my copper water bottle for other drinks besides water?**
It's generally recommended to only use copper water bottles for water. Acidic beverages like juice, coffee, or soda can react with the copper, potentially leaching copper into the drink and altering its taste. While small amounts of copper are generally harmless, excessive intake can have adverse health effects. If your bottle is lined with stainless steel, it may be safe for these other beverages, but always consult the manufacturer's instructions.

**How do I remove tarnish from a copper water bottle?**
Mix equal parts of lemon juice, salt, and water to make a natural cleaning solution. Pour the solution into the bottle, close the lid, and shake well. Let it sit for 15-30 minutes, then scrub the inside with a soft brush or sponge. Rinse thoroughly with water and dry entirely. For external tarnish, apply the solution to a soft cloth and rub gently.Avoid using harsh chemicals or abrasive cleaners, as these can damage the copper.

**Is it safe to drink water stored in a copper bottle every day?**
When used correctly, drinking water stored in a copper bottle is generally considered safe. Copper is an essential nutrient, and the amount that leaches into the water is typically within safe limits. Though, it's critically important to use a high-quality bottle made of pure copper and to avoid storing acidic beverages in the bottle. If you have any concerns, consult with a healthcare professional.

1m36xhi,https://www.reddit.com/r/story/comments/1m36xhi/i_lost_my_job_then_lost_everything/,‚ÄúI lost my job‚Ä¶ then lost everything.‚Äù,"I greeted a few coworkers, sat at my desk, and started checking emails. But something felt‚Ä¶ off. People were quieter. My boss, Mr. Gomez, looked tense.

Later that day, he called me into his office. The air felt heavy the moment I stepped in.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm really sorry, Samson,‚Äù he said, not looking me in the eye. ‚ÄúDue to budget cuts‚Ä¶ we have to let you go.‚Äù

I froze.

My heart dropped. I had worked there for years, always on time, always gave it my all. I could barely speak.

‚ÄúIs there really no other way?‚Äù I asked quietly.

He sighed. ‚ÄúI wish there was.‚Äù

I left the office with my things in a box and my head down. The rain outside had gotten worse, like the sky understood how I felt. On the way home, I stopped by a small caf√©. I just needed to sit, think, breathe.

That‚Äôs when I saw Navarro, an old friend.

‚ÄúHey! Long time no see,‚Äù he said, waving me over.

I gave him a tired smile and sat down. My clothes were damp, and I could feel the weight in my shoulders.

‚ÄúI just lost my job,‚Äù I said quietly. ‚ÄúThey said it was because of budget cuts.‚Äù

Navarro frowned. ‚ÄúMan‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm really sorry. That‚Äôs rough.‚Äù

I stared out the window. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know what to do now. I have a family to feed. Bills to pay. I feel useless.‚Äù

He was quiet for a moment, then leaned in.

‚ÄúLook‚Ä¶ I‚Äôve been trying something recently. It‚Äôs this online game,¬† kind of like gambling, but I‚Äôve made a lot of money from it.‚Äù

I raised an eyebrow. ‚ÄúGambling?‚Äù

‚ÄúI know how it sounds,‚Äù he said quickly. ‚ÄúBut it‚Äôs not as risky as you think. I started small, and now I‚Äôm earning thousands. You should try it. Might help you get back on your feet.‚Äù

I hesitated. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know‚Ä¶ I‚Äôve never done anything like that.‚Äù

‚ÄúJust once,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôve got nothing to lose.‚Äù

I stared down at my coffee. My mind was spinning.

Navarro tapped the table.

‚ÄúJust try it tonight. Start small,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúYou might be surprised.‚Äù

I nodded slowly. ‚ÄúI‚Äôll‚Ä¶ think about it.‚Äù

I stood up, grabbed my coat.

‚ÄúThanks, Navarro. I need to head home.‚Äù

‚ÄúAnytime,‚Äù he said with a small smile. ‚ÄúLet me know how it goes.‚Äù

I left the caf√©. The sky was already dark. My footsteps were slow, my thoughts heavy. On the way home, my phone buzzed ‚Äî a message from Navarro. A link.

I looked at the screen. Then up in the sky.

Took a deep breath.

And walked faster.

That night, I sat alone in the dark. My wife, Luna, and daughter, Estelle, were already asleep. I stared at the glowing screen in my hand. Navarro‚Äôs words echoed: *You‚Äôve got nothing to lose.*

With shaking fingers, I opened the site.

I placed a small bet, just to see how it worked.

To my surprise‚Ä¶ I won.

Then I tried again.

And again.

And within days, the small wins turned into big ones. Thousands poured in.

I felt alive again. Like the weight on my back had finally lifted. I started treating my family to expensive dinners. Bought new clothes. Gadgets. Things they didn‚Äôt even ask for.

‚ÄúYou deserve the best,‚Äù I told them, smiling like I hadn‚Äôt in months.

Luna was confused at first, but she was happy to see me happy. Estelle looked proud.

But that was just the beginning.

Weeks turned into months. The high from winning faded,¬† replaced by a need to chase it again. I started losing.

First, a few hundred.

Then thousands.

I told myself it was just a cold streak. I had won before. I could win again. But the site kept taking more than it gave. I began borrowing. First from friends. Then from loan apps. Then from people I really shouldn‚Äôt have gotten involved with.

The fancy dinners stopped.

I returned the gadgets. Sold some. Pawned the rest.

Luna noticed.

‚ÄúWhy are we short on money again? Weren‚Äôt we doing fine just last week?‚Äù

I brushed her off. ‚ÄúJust a few unexpected expenses. I‚Äôve got it under control.‚Äù

But I didn‚Äôt.

One afternoon, Estelle came home crying.

‚ÄúThey kicked me out of the school bus‚Ä¶ because we haven‚Äôt paid in weeks.‚Äù

That night, Luna confronted me.

‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs going on, Samson?‚Äù she asked. ‚ÄúWhere is all the money going?‚Äù

I hesitated.

Then lied.

‚ÄúBusiness deal fell through. It‚Äôs temporary. I just need a little time.‚Äù

But the debt collectors started calling more. Then they showed up. Loud knocks. Threats. Demands.

Eventually, I couldn‚Äôt even pay the rent.

We packed our things and moved into a small, cramped apartment. Estelle lost her private school scholarship. Luna had to start working full-time again at a nearby clinic.

And still‚Ä¶ I kept gambling.

Not because I thought I‚Äôd win.

But because it was the only time I felt *hope.*

One rainy evening, just like the one when this all began, Luna sat me down.

‚ÄúWe‚Äôre done,‚Äù she said softly.

‚ÄúWhat?‚Äù

‚ÄúI can‚Äôt do this anymore. Estelle is scared of you. I don‚Äôt recognize you. We‚Äôre moving in with my sister.‚Äù

I opened my mouth‚Ä¶ but no words came out.

They left the next morning.

Now, I sit alone.

The apartment is silent. Bills are stacked on the table. My phone still buzzes‚Ä¶ but it‚Äôs never who I want it to be.

I sit at the same table, under the same flickering light, staring at the same website.

But this time, there‚Äôs nothing left to bet.

Just me, and everything I lost.

It all started with: *‚ÄúYou‚Äôve got nothing to lose.‚Äù*

But now‚Ä¶ I know better.

Because eventually, you do.

1m36wzu,https://a.co/d/a4W9v9o,üß† üëÉ Scent Training for Phantosmia: What It Is and How It Might Help,"

If you‚Äôre experiencing phantosmia (phantom smells), you might feel like there‚Äôs nothing you can do but live with it. While not a guaranteed fix, scent training is one gentle, low-risk strategy that has helped some people retrain their sense of smell.

üåø What is Scent Training?

Scent training involves regularly smelling specific scents to stimulate and possibly ‚Äúre-educate‚Äù the olfactory system. It‚Äôs kind of like physical therapy but for your nose and brain!

It‚Äôs simple, low cost, and can be done at home.



üß™ How to Do Scent Training

You‚Äôll need 4 essential oils or jars with strongly identifiable smells, commonly:
	‚Ä¢	Rose
	‚Ä¢	Lemon
	‚Ä¢	Clove
	‚Ä¢	Eucalyptus

Steps:
	1.	Take a quiet moment twice a day (e.g. morning and night).
	2.	Sniff each scent gently for ~20 seconds, focusing on the smell and trying to recall what it should smell like.
	3.	Repeat this daily, ideally for several weeks.

You can substitute scents if you prefer others (like coffee, peppermint, or vanilla). The key is consistency.




üß† Why Might This Help?

Although phantosmia is different from total smell loss (anosmia), the theory is similar ‚Äî you‚Äôre activating and potentially strengthening the brain‚Äôs smell pathways. This could reduce misfiring signals that cause phantom smells or improve olfactory nerve function.

Some people report reduced frequency or intensity of phantom smells after several weeks or months of scent training.




‚ö†Ô∏è A Few Notes:
	‚Ä¢	This is not a cure, but a possible tool in your toolkit.
	‚Ä¢	It‚Äôs gentle and safe for most people, though strong smells can be unpleasant if you‚Äôre sensitive.
	‚Ä¢	Talk to your doctor before starting if you have asthma or allergies.


There are plenty of options available but I‚Äôve included a link to the kit I used which I was happy with.  They smell really strong and are lasting a long time and came with a tracker and little booklet explaining the process.

1m36wtv,https://www.reddit.com/r/MobapadGaming/comments/1m36wtv/my_review_of_mobapad_p1_carrying_case_for/,My review of Mobapad P1 Carrying Case for Nintendo Switch 2,"Recently, I received the **P1 Carrying Case for my Nintendo Switch 2** from **Mobapad**, so here is my review of a case that on paper had a promising price to protection / quality.

https://preview.redd.it/actmw9vcrndf1.jpg?width=4000&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=373dc9200eda7440f0cc1684032ac165018cd3e4

**First impressions & build quality**

The P1 case makes a good first impression. The packaging is a solid improvement over previous products. I value good packaging, especially when it doesn‚Äôt require much extra effort from the brand. In this case, they have delivered. It is a case after all, but first impressions matter for me in that regard.

https://preview.redd.it/txod72bnrndf1.jpg?width=3827&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=12e2dcd14cdea54a2571f59e2c0cdf14534e5da9

About the case itself... It‚Äôs slim‚Äîaround 3‚ÄØcm thick‚Äîand very weightless, so it doesn‚Äôt add unnecessary bulk (which I hate in other non-official cases. Slim is slim. The outer shell uses a PU material that feels smooth but has a nice texture for grip. It‚Äôs kind of like touching a rubbery fabric. It probably repels water or at least prevents the outer shell from absorbing it, which is a plus if you find yourself living in a rainy area like mine and running to pick up a bus or something and you are carrying it by hand. Or if you accidentally drop any drink on it, which CAN AND WILL HAPPEN some time when outside.

https://preview.redd.it/yd3r1hcsrndf1.jpg?width=4000&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=fbef191c0d92fd83b4e9fe34c8323d43c1cbd179

The zippers look very good. They glide without any snagging, which gives a bit of confidence in durability. I don't have any knowledge of YKK brand for zippers but these seem solid.  
  
On the outside, it is VERY sturdy. It is as sturdy as a rigid plastic case could be, but with enough flexibility to absorb potential falls from hand height without any issue. I tested it just by applying pressure with my closed fist and it surprised me. I also hit it a couple of times to test for dents or scratches. None. No deformation, no visible marks. Another good mark in this regard.

**Protection**

And that leads us to protection. On the inside, the soft velvet lining feels gentle on the console. It‚Äôs the same velvet you can find in most official and unofficial cases and will provide sufficient protection to the console. It has a nice internal padding and a cushion on the upper part that keeps the Switch completely in place, tight enough so it doesn't move. I had cases for my Switch 1 where you could feel the console bouncing inside. This ain't the case here, since it also has some kind of insert at the bottom that helps stop the console from shifting around, which may be useful for travel.

https://preview.redd.it/dd8almixrndf1.jpg?width=4000&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=2cc67dded1bd365afacbecfd160f8640dd453d42

Something I value in slim cases is the joystick safe area. It has a couple of small cushion pads placed over those areas‚Äîclearly designed to prevent pressure on joysticks when the case is closed. I appreciate this since I‚Äôve had two Skull&Co thumb grips since day one and wouldn‚Äôt want to remove them every time I take my console with me somewhere.

[BAAANAAAAAAAAAANZAAAAAAAAAAA üçåüçåüçåüçåüçåüçå](https://preview.redd.it/9ibqfocbsndf1.jpg?width=4000&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=8ec9f6b016d1efcb48fefe35055596b17484ff15)

Overall, enough protection and features to ensure the console is correctly protected when inside.

**Storage & portability**

As it was typical in Switch 1 cases, the P1 features a cushion that serves both as extra screen area protection and extra storage for games. There are 12 slots for game cards, lined with the same soft velvet material, so they don‚Äôt scratch and the slots themselves are made by sewed elastic fabric that holds the cards in place. Beyond that, it‚Äôs a minimalist design‚Äîno extra pockets for cables or a charger. After all, it‚Äôs a slim case and for me, that‚Äôs fine because I mainly needed something easy to throw into a bag. I had no issue dropping it into my usual Tomtoc sling bag, and the rubberized texture on the outside means it never feels slippery in hand.

https://preview.redd.it/vtrocs91tndf1.jpg?width=4000&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=adcf6db4ca9f2265fd37814135a205afc5c221f9

**Everyday use**

It‚Äôs not a particularly complex item, so it doesn‚Äôt take long to figure out if it‚Äôs good or bad in terms of portability and protection for everyday or occasional use. Used it today, threw the console in, tossed some games in the slots, put it inside my bag and played for a while on the go while drinking some coffee in a bar. One thing I appreciate is that you can just open the console stand, place it over the case and it will stay perfectly stable with the case open, which avoids the unnecessary risks of placing on a table or other surfaces outside the case.

In terms of durability, it remains to be seen but judging by the materials and sturdiness I think that with occasional-moderate use this may well last the entire console lifetime. Its resilience with consistent use will take time to evaluate, and I‚Äôll update this review in the future.

**What I disliked (more like missed)**

There is not much that you can point to in terms of an in-depth review of this kind of case, but perhaps I miss having more design or color variations. I got the black version and there are a couple nice options but I feel they could have gone a bit further with some game-themed color combinations. I would have instantly picked a banana-yellow one (DK Banana style). Fortunately, themed design and color choices is something that Mobapad can explore for future production of this case.  
  
And of course, same as any product that has a mix of cardboard, ink, plastic from the package and tint rubber or plastic mix on the product itself, I didn't like that first time opening smell combination. But the case itself smells of new fabric just fine and I have absolutely no clue if that can be avoided so it is not a real downside. I am just a bit picky with smells.

https://preview.redd.it/ztg4624wsndf1.jpg?width=4000&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=5fea2fab3ada23b9de66746609162c0b292921bc

**Conclusion**

Mobapad has already proved that it‚Äôs committed to providing some of the best devices we can use with our console, which they achieved with their M6HD for Switch 1, but also understands what they need to do in order to satisfy those like me with an appetite for balance between price and quality in our everyday console accessories.

  
In its price range and considering quality and features, **I would give it a solid 4.5/5.**",1,1752856084.0,MobapadGaming,2,1.0,False

I'm not recommending for or against USCCA, I don't know enough about them to go either way. But the video is good to watch and talk about.

[How these defensive gun uses could land you in prison](https://youtu.be/ERIIDaAPhgo?si=tb1N9e-Hs_R8XmK1)

So they put Colion Noir in a couple of situations where he as to make quick decisions on lethal use of his weapon. Another Youtuber who is a former prosecutor helps break down the legal implications of his actions. It's pretty interesting and makes you think.

In the first scenario, there's a guy in the back who is reading a paper. They don't dwell on him much, but I think his part in the scene is to be the witness who didn't see much, but he did see Colion shoot the guy in the back as he was trying to go out the door. That's the kind of testimony that might get you in trouble with the wrong prosecutor.

In the second scenario, there was a lot going on in a short amount of time, but Colion seemed to handle that one better than expected. Shooting the cashier escalated the situation, but the presence of the second gunman made him think twice about engaging. Then then things went to a new level when they grabbed the girl. He made good choices in this one.

My thoughts after watching this; things can escalate QUICKLY and once they do a 3 second event might be broken down into 30 hours of analyzation and discussion. Keeping a cool head is hard, even for those who train. How many videos have you seen of trained police officers who lose their shit when things go loud? Just take that guy from last year who lit up his own vehicle when an acorn fell and hit the hood.

It's hard to think when shit gets real and the adrenaline kicks in. I'm a former combat veteran and a trauma nurse, so I'm used to working in high stress situations, but I have no idea how I will react in some of the scenarios shown here. I've been shot at before, but never in close quarters with a bunch of civilians potentially in the line of fire.

My takeaway from this; take that extra half second (if able) to assess the situation. Are they still a threat? If I shoot, what's behind them that I might hit? Stuff like that. It helps me to take that pause in the trauma room, and I would think it would help me in that coffee shop. Of course, if the barrel is pointed towards you, it might be time for pure reaction.",11,1752856050.0,liberalgunowners,5,1.0,False
1m36v5l,https://i.redd.it/a0m4lt3rsndf1.png,Dungeon crawler maps,"Hi internet strangers,

Got a adventure game using standees I'm working on that takes place over numerous maps, but thinking what would be the better (cost vs ease of setup vs quality) that would be best.
However I would like a scenario maker style so players can have random missions so they don't have to play just the campaign and can wring some more out of it.

I've seen books with ""missions map"" on each page (mass effect & GH: JotL). These seem cost effective and easy to set up, but means the scenario mode is dead in the water. Also means the entire map is revealed before players begin, meaning any ""sense of exploration"" is lessened

The are map tiles (Gloomhaven) more expensive but they can be rearranged, flipped and allows for that scenario mode I like. (Current plan but I'm musing in a coffee shop rn)

Then thes large map tiles with blanking sheets and door tokens (MB's dungeons and dragons) more expensive still but allows for even more resuse.

My go to for 7brew before I switched to sugar free items was the large iced banana bread chai tea with oat milk. I LOVE sweet milk teas but I know that the chai cannot be made sugar free as the mix (or whatever) is made w sugar. I‚Äôve tried a couple variations of the iced cinnamon spice tea but I guess I‚Äôm not saying it right bc it always comes out lack luster. Plus the milk alternatives seem to separate a lot with the sf syrups‚Ä¶ I know I won‚Äôt be able to compare it to the chai bc that‚Äôs its own distinct flavor and I know banana is one of the syrups that aren‚Äôt available in sugar free. I also am not super hip on the whole scoops thing vs saying 3x sweet- so if someone could explain what the taste (and calorie if poss) difference is that would probably also be quite helpful! 

For reference, my last order was: medium iced cinnamon spice tea, with almond milk, sf brown sugar cinnamon, sf vanilla, sf strawberry 3x sweet (I had to go home and put some creamer in it bc the almond milk separated and it wasn‚Äôt milky enough for my taste)

Just looking for an iced, sweet and creamy tea (or other drinks- not too big on coffee these days but willing to try the energy drinks) without coconut in them. Obviously looking for sf options as the title suggests but a huge plus if it‚Äôs 200 cals or less. I appreciate any assistance!

1m36tgj,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1m36tgj/he_threatened_to_leak_my_nudes_and_i_feel/,He threatened to leak my ‚Äúnudes‚Äù and I feel incredibly shameful.,"So, two years ago, in 2023, I posted a picture of my hand holding a Starbucks coffee in my car. I made the mistake of posting this on my Public Snapchat profile and not my friends only one. I got a DM from someone saying they‚Äôre on a military base and they‚Äôre not around much women, but they liked my hands and nails and wondered if I had cute feet. They wanted to pay me money to send feet pictures. I‚Äôd like to take accountability by realizing that‚Äôs incredibly weird and that I shouldn‚Äôt have followed it up, I should‚Äôve blocked this person and wrote it off, but I didn‚Äôt. If I had done that, I wouldn‚Äôt be in the situation I am in now. I engaged and went back and forth and was like, ‚Äúoh. Wellllll, he doesn‚Äôt seem like a weirdo, so okay. Maybe. We‚Äôll see.‚Äù Clearly, I did it. I sent a total of four pictures: three of my feet and one of me bent over with my feet showing, and all in all, I got paid $140 for it. The whole time he and I are talking, he‚Äôs like, ‚Äúyou have really pretty feet. People would pay big money for your feet. You should think about selling pictures; not even just to me.‚Äù And I told him repeatedly this isn‚Äôt for me, you already paid and you‚Äôre not giving me the creeps, I just do it with you. I, however, never really felt good about it and honestly started feeling a bit shameful that I engaged like this with a stranger. It‚Äôs just not in my personal moral compass. I wanna make it a point to say I support sex workers and their choice to do the things they wanna do for their money, but it‚Äôs just personally not for me. I hope I am not coming off as judgmental as that‚Äôs the last thing I wanna do; sex work is their work. I sent him back the $140 through cashapp and on Snapchat, told him thank you for the help, but I‚Äôm just not interested in this anymore. All in all, we talked for about three weeks to a month, maybe a month and a half.

Fast forward to now, 2025. There‚Äôs this guy, who I‚Äôve seen in passing since he runs in a crew of guys who I know and I‚Äôm actually really cool with, who continuously messages me on Snapchat. If I post a picture, he replies to it and tells me I am beautiful and that my feet are pretty, etc etc. I normally hearted his messages and go on about my way. However, he increasingly started asking me to sell him feet pictures, which I denied every single time and told him that‚Äôs not something I do, I‚Äôm not interested, please stop, I‚Äôve been telling you no for years‚Ä¶ no, no, NO. he then says to me today, ‚Äúit‚Äôs crazy that you‚Äôre telling me no when I‚Äôve personally bought pictures from you before. But I guess you have an image to keep up. That‚Äôs nonsense. I know how to move with you now‚Äù in a Snapchat message. I‚Äôm like ??? Oh, shit. He lied about who he was, made an entirely new profile, and then hmu as if he never knew who I was. He pretended he was a stranger. I felt violated. I send him a message back saying:

‚Äú and if you did, that's great. I hope you enjoyea them! It's not ""keeping up an image"" for anything, I did it once with you and that was that. I don't do it, period. That's it, that's all. It has nothing to do with me knowing you (which I barely do, l've seen you in passing here and there) but still. That's kinda crazy to be like, two years later it was me the whole time, but it is what it is lol. I sent you pictures of my feet and you paid for them, that was it and I ended up sending you the money back anyway so what is the point?‚Äù

I then sent him another message and said, ‚ÄúGod bless you!‚Äù as I‚Äôm trying not to be rude or upset him even though he was rude to me. He blocks me on Snapchat, then leaves a comment on a IG post of mine from a burner account, ‚Äú You sent them to ***********. I still have the screenshots & cash apps. Just make sure you don't send those out or I will too‚Äù It almost seems to me as if he is shameful of paying for feet pictures and doesn‚Äôt want it come out. He also paid me one time to tell him about the last time I was intimate with someone and seemed to really get off on that. Under his actual account, He would always send messages like, ‚Äúyou don‚Äôt want a trick? You don‚Äôt want anyone to give you some money just for being pretty? I can keep a secret. Girls like guys with money.‚Äù I never put two and two together that the language and voice is the same as the account when he pretended to be a stranger and bought pictures of my feet.

Of note, I never got a notification he saved the four pictures I sent, so, it has me wondering if he took pictures of the screen from another phone and still has the pictures. I refunded him the money in full of what he sent me, so, I‚Äôm not understanding why he is bringing this up now, two years later. I did SS Snapchat messages; I wanted to have proof of what really went on in case he tried to put anything out and made it seem like it was more than what it truly was. I am now blocked on his burner IG, too. From his personal IG, he blocked me as well.

I‚Äôm pretty shook over this situation and I‚Äôm feeling all types of emotions from shame, embarrassment, sadness to fear and anxiety‚Ä¶ and a weird feeling of being content. Do you have any thoughts about this? Has anyone else been in a position like? What do you think?",0,1752855862.0,Advice,1,0.5,False
1m36t1x,https://www.reddit.com/r/N24/comments/1m36t1x/sleep_inertia_and_difficulty_waking_up/,Sleep inertia and difficulty waking up,"Hi! So this is sort of a continuation of the [last post](https://www.reddit.com/r/N24/comments/1m36bfz/update_entrainment_progress_with_light_therapy/) I just made. I thought my post was getting pretty long, and this is kind of a stand alone topic anyway.

I've been trying to fix my sleep through therapy for several months, but I'm tired of having my day cut short by my untamed sleep. I know it may not be healthy, but I need to find a way to wake up earlier consistently, I can't keep waiting until I find a way to make the therapy work better. It's not even like I'm pushing myself to wake up after less than 6 hours of sleep - I only wish to manage to wake up after 6-8 hours.

But even though I sleep on average for 7-8.5 hours, and very rarely do I sleep less than 6.5 hours, there are random days when I sleep for 10-12 hours, and I simply can't get up any earlier. When I set alarms, if I hear them, I feel almost paralysed, like I have no control. I get back pains as if I was sleeping on some train tracks, my mind is blank, and I just snooze the alarms or turn them off, sometimes I don't even recall doing it. And on top of that, even after I end up waking up naturally hours later, my body still feels awful, my mind is still foggy, the only difference being that I get a tiny bit of energy, an impulse to get up.

* I tried setting up my lights to turn on a bit before my alarms with no effect. On a few occasions I somehow managed to bring myself to put my light therapy glasses on, and I just went back to sleep with them running...
* I tried all sorts of alarms with math/puzzles and whatnot, I tried putting the alarm someplace else so I'd have to get up from bed, but I'd just be in a zombie-like state and I'd get back to bed after turning it off. 
* Caffeine doesn't give me energy, I can even go right to sleep after drinking some coffee. Tried various supplements (vitamin D, magnesium, omega 3 and some others) with no effect.
* Tried some meditation/mindfulness/breathing exercises before bed. As I was falling asleep, I tried focusing my thoughts on the things I want to get done the next day.
* Having someone wake me up is no better than an alarm, if anything it just worsens my mood and makes me extra disappointed in myself for failing that person as well
* I haven't had a sleep study done, but from what others told me I rarely snore and they didn't notice me having difficulty breathing while asleep, so I doubt I have sleep apnea.
* The timing of my food and workouts also doesn't seem to be linked to my wake up time or the sleep inertia

The days when I sleep more 8 hours seem to happen randomly (at least now, while I'm doing therapy and I'm somewhat entrained). I imagine that when I did no therapy and I would simply try to restrict my sleep, this sleep inertia and morning fatigue would've been due to the sleep deprivation. But at this point, I've been sleeping more than enough for months, yet I still can't wake up after sleeping a normal amount of time.

Now, I could probably count on one hand all the days throughout my life when I woke up really refreshed and energized, it's so rare I can't even remember the last time. But still, when I manage wake up after 6-8 hours, I do feel much better than when I oversleep. The fatigue goes away quicker, and I can ""start"" my day sooner. Maybe part of it is mental, so when I oversleep I feel guilty and it impacts my day. But it feels like much more than that, as if my body is not in sync with itself...

So at this point, if the first hours of some of my days are going to be ruined anyway, till the sleep inertia is fully gone, I might as well just get it over with early with an alarm, seeing how sleeping more after my alarms doesn't lead me to waking up fresh and ready to go. But I just can't get myself to do it, and I don't know what else I can try anymore.",3,1752855835.0,N24,1,1.0,False
1m36smf,https://www.reddit.com/r/CharlotteDobreYouTube/comments/1m36smf/aita_for_snapping_at_my_friend_for_ruining_my/,AITA FOR SNAPPING AT MY FRIEND FOR RUINING MY TRIP BACK HOME,"Last year, I was on the phone with one of my friends, whom I told that I was planning a trip back home to Toronto. At the moment I work in Switzerland and my friend with whom I was on the phone with, lives in Poland. We met back in 2017 and were friends ever since. She sounded really excited by the fact that I was going to Toronto, I could sense in her voice that she wanted to join me. I decided to invite her, to which her immediate response was: ‚ÄúCan my boyfriend come?‚Äù. I didn‚Äôt want to be mean, so I told her she can bring him along, because I had an extra bedroom with a spare bathroom for them. She told me that his mom works for Polish airlines, therefore they can get a standby ticket for him, which would cost literally ten times cheaper than a regular ticket. I thought that this was great for them, as the salaries in Poland are low, this way they could save money on tickets and get a free accommodation from me. To be honest, I don‚Äôt think they would be able to afford a ten day trip to Toronto, if I didn‚Äôt provide them with an accommodation. A couple of days later, she sends me a message saying that, there is a flight scheduled three hours after ours, and asked me to wait for her boyfriend for three hours at the airport in Toronto in case he can‚Äôt get on our flight, because he is on a standby ticket. I had a horrible three day migraine that day, and I sent her a voice msg with clear pain in my voice telling her that I will definitely have the same migraine once we land after our 8.5 hour flight to Toronto, so I will wait for them at my apartment and I can give them my address. She sent me a message back, telling me not to worry and that everything will be fine. I assumed that it was all clear, and she will not ask me to wait for them or change my flight for her boyfriend. I was already travelling a week late because of them, I had adjusted my schedule so they could come with me. Due to this, I was going to miss out on seeing some of my friends. Finally June 22^(nd)¬†rolls around, I take my flight to Poland first, because she invited me to her birthday before going to Canada. Our flight was scheduled for June 24th. The day before our flight, the boyfriend‚Äôs mom calls and tells her that the flight we are taking has been overbooked by 6 people and most likely her boyfriend will not fly with us. But the flight that is three hours after ours had ten empty seats. When her boyfriend wasn‚Äôt at home, she started crying and telling me that she is afraid something will happen to his plane if he takes the other one and in case something happens to him she wants to be there with him. She has anxiety about people dying, but she isn‚Äôt seeing a therapist or working to overcome it. I reassured her that everything will be fine and even if he takes the next flight, Toronto airport is safe and I live in a very safe suburb. That same day, she invited me for lunch with her best friend and her best friends daughter. During our lunch, the boyfriend‚Äôs mom calls her again and tells her that it looks like he will definitely not be on our flight. After we finish eating, she asks me in front of her friends at the table, if I can volunteer to take the flight that is three hours after ours, in case her boyfriend can‚Äôt get on our flight. I calmly tell her that, we already have to leave the house at 10 am, to take her car to the dealership, after which we need to head to the airport, we won‚Äôt find out if her boyfriend is travelling with us until we board, and if we take the later flight, we won‚Äôt fly till 5 pm, and then we have an 8.5 hour flight ahead of us. Her response was :‚ÄùBut it‚Äôs only three hours more‚Äù. Her best friend‚Äôs response was: ‚ÄúBut aren‚Äôt you going to wait for them at the airport in Toronto for three hours when you land anyways?‚Äù. I told them no, If I take my flight then I will go to my apartment, do groceries and just wait for them there. My friend‚Äôs eyes got red and so did her face. She said she needs to step out because the food made her ill. I felt like I was put on the spot and made to look like an asshole in front of her friends. I actually got anxious myself and went to the bathroom. After I came out, she was quiet the whole day.¬†

The next morning as we were getting ready to go to the airport she tells me: ‚ÄúIt would be so funny if you are chosen as the person who has to take the later flight because this flight is overbooked!‚Äù. According to her, this was a joke, according to me it was insensitive because she knows I actually have anxiety and I have a therapist to deal with this too. Her boyfriend ended up getting on our flight, and we were all relieved about this. I told her that when we land in Canada, I will wait for them in baggage claim because for Canadians, we don‚Äôt need to queue for the passport control, it‚Äôs an automatic computer, whereas for foreigners, there is usually a long line. When the plane landed I got my usual migraine which I get after long flights, I got off the plane and followed the passengers to the bus which took us to passport control. I scanned my passport and quickly ended up in baggage claim. She messaged me asking me where I was. I told her that I was at baggage claim as we agreed before. She wrote me that she thought I was waiting for them when I got off the plane. I repeated again that we will have to go through different passport control so there was no point in waiting for them when I got off the plane. Her response back was: ‚ÄúOk. Hope you will wait for us at the airport though, not at your house‚Äù. According to her this was a joke, according to me this was a dig at what I told her the day before when she asked me to change my flight or wait for them for three hours. On top of this, she txts me 20 minutes later, telling me that they already got their suitcase and they are waiting for me outside of the airport. At this point I was pissed. She saw me at baggage claim, completely ignored me and proceeded to the exit ‚Äúto smoke‚Äù. She could have tapped on my shoulder and told me that she needs to smoke, instead of being passive aggressive, because I didn‚Äôt wait for them when I got off the plane. I was also mad because when I visited Poland, I followed her everywhere and listened to her directions. Now she was in my country, txting me passive aggressive messages and just ignoring me because she is with her boyfriend. When I came to the exit. I told her I needed to talk to her. I told her how I was feeling and I did raise my voice. The boyfriend was confused and told me that they were in a good mood and she didn‚Äôt say anything bad about me. I told him to check the messages she sent me. He had no idea what she was texting me. She said that they were five steps behind me on the plane and I didn‚Äôt wait for them. There were 9 seats per row, and they were seated in the middle of the plane and I was in the front. They weren‚Äôt even on my bus when we got off the plane and again, the passport control was completely different for us. She said she didn‚Äôt see me at baggage claim but her boyfriend blurted out that they saw me, but they were dizzy so they decided to go smoke. He had no idea I had told her to wait for me there. I told her boyfriend about what happened at lunch with her friends the day before and how she was crying about the fact that he might die if he takes the next flight and she wanted to be there if something happened. She told me that I was making fun of her anxiety by telling this to her boyfriend and that she would never stoop so low. To be honest, I wasn‚Äôt making fun of her anxiety at all. I was showing that she doesn‚Äôt care about her friend who suffers from migraines and the only thing she cared about was her boyfriend. I invited her on this trip, and she wouldn‚Äôt be able to come if it wasn‚Äôt for me. She told me that I was selfish and the only thing that didn‚Äôt go my way was that they just went for a smoke after they got of the plane. I wasn‚Äôt mad because they went for a smoke, I was mad because she hinted twice that day to the conversation we had the day before then ignored me at baggage claim although she knew I was waiting for her there. Her boyfriend thought that I told him about what happened at lunch and about her crying because I wanted him to take my side. But no, I just wanted to inform him of what she was doing without him knowing a thing about it, because he got involved anyway saying that she wasn‚Äôt mad at me.¬†

When we got home, she gaslit me into thinking that she was in fact not mad at me and I misunderstood her. I apologized to her for yelling at her and told her that I truly thought that she was mad at me. I thought after this, our trip would go smoothly but I was so wrong. They had come completely unprepared. They both used my face cream, metamucil, chia seeds and magnesium, I gave them an extra umbrella, I bought them groceries which all had to be thrown out because they didn‚Äôt eat what they picked out for me to buy them. She used my lactose pills and my cable because she didn‚Äôt buy a cable to charge her phone. After all of this, she told her boyfriend right in front of me that I don‚Äôt share anything because growing up my brother didn‚Äôt share‚Ä¶ On one of the days, it was going to rain and she told me that we will be going to three museums and then shopping. I decided to wear a dress and sandals because I assumed that we will be indoors the whole day. I made sure to take my umbrella and told them to take the extra umbrella in my apartment, which they didn‚Äôt take. When we got to the first museum, she announced that she will not go in because it was too expensive. Then she dragged us in the rain to the next museum, mind you that Toronto is a very big city. My friend was with us that day. She thought that the Polish girl was very bossy and controlling and her boyfriend was too nice for her. My Canadian friend also had an umbrella. The Polish friend asked if she could have one of our umbrellas to share with her boyfriend. I am 5 feet and my Canadian friend is almost 6 feet. I told them, I can‚Äôt share it with the Canadian friend but I can share it with the Polish one. But this didn‚Äôt suit the Polish friend because she wanted to walk with her boyfriend and not with me. When we arrived to the second museum, she told us that she won‚Äôt go in there either because it was too expensive too. At this point the rain was getting stronger. She told us that she wanted to walk to the third museum. My feet were getting cold and wet because I was wearing sandals. Both of their sneakers were soaked as well, which stank up my apartment for the rest of the week. It was also getting windy. I decided to endure it because after the first day of yelling at her, I really wanted to get through this trip and never travel with her again. On our way to the third museum, she decided to have a coffee. She spent an hour at the coffee shop. I informed her that museums close at 5:30 pm. At this point a storm began. She insisted that she wanted to walk through Queen‚Äôs Park on the way to the Royal Ontario Museum. At this point I told her that I will order an uber for my Canadian friend and I, because I was cold and there was a storm. The Polish friend took my Canadian friend‚Äôs umbrella and left. Within a minute when we were looking for the uber, we both got completely soaked because we had a huge height difference and the umbrella didn‚Äôt cover either of us, because it was on an angle. Luckily, my Canadian friend had an extra shirt in her bag, which she gave me to dry myself. When we arrived to the third museum, the security guard informed us that it will close in five minutes.. I told the Polish girl that we might as well go to our dinner place, because it was close by. She really wanted to have a seafood boil. The restaurant was near Yorkville, the most expensive neighbourhood in Toronto. While walking beside stores such as Prada, Lois Vuitton and Hermes, the Polish girl kept on telling me go in and by a jacket because I will get sick. It was a ridiculous request, because the restaurant was a 15 minute walk and I wasn‚Äôt about to get a jacket from a luxury brand that I didn‚Äôt need.¬†

The next day we took the bus to Niagara Falls. I booked a 7 dollar front seat and the Polish friend and her boyfriend sat at the back of the bus on the way to Niagara and from Niagara. This is a key point, the fact that she was at the back of the bus the whole time. When we came back to Toronto we had some poutine and beers. Since it was late, I decided to order an uber instead of taking the subway and the bus back to the suburbs. When I called the uber, he parked his car 500 meters from us. I decided to walk towards him and the Polish girl started yelling at me telling me to make him drive to us. I told her to just come to the car. She opened the front seat of the car. The uber driver had a big binder with a lot of papers in the front seat so he asked her to sit at the back. She told him that she feels sick at the back of the car, so she can‚Äôt sit there. This was interesting because she sat at the back of the bus during the whole trip to and from Niagara. The uber driver insisted that she needs to sit at the back. She sat at the back and scrolled down the window. I asked her kindly to roll it up as it was cold. She said very loudly: ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt close the window, his perfume smells really bad‚Äù. Obviously the uber driver heard this. Then as we were about to enter Gardner Expressway highway, we were under the highway bridge, she started yelling at him saying that he wasn‚Äôt paying attention to the GPS and he had to take a left turn, she yelled that he was on the phone and not paying attention to the road. It was the tone and the way she said this that made him mad. So he took a right turn, stopped the car and told me: ‚ÄúI am sorry, I have to cancel the ride, your friend is being rude. Please leave my car.‚Äù. Her boyfriend started cursing at the driver and the driver cursed back. Now we were stranded under a bridge at the entry to the highway, in the middle of the night. Luckily she was able to call a different uber. She told the new uber driver that I am making her feel like she is a bad person because she was fearing for her live, and apparently the previous driver was recklessly driving because he was on the phone. The guy was not recklessly driving. In fact, the Polish girl herself, is always on the phone arguing with people while driving. The uber driver was calmly talking on the phone on bluetooth with someone, and I am pretty sure in that spot he could have taken a left turn from the middle lane, because in certain places in Canada, you can do that. Also, the new uber driver informed us that one of the entries to the highway was closed, and he in fact used a different one too.¬†

During the whole trip, I shut my mouth and decided to just handle her and never travel with her again. After the Niagara trip she got sick and on the last day in Canada her boyfriend got sick as well. Turned out it was covid. The day after I landed in Canada, I messaged her to see how their Covid was going. She redirected the conversation and texted me the following: ‚ÄúYeah, don‚Äôt take it the wrong way, I‚Äôm saying it just because I care about you and really want you to be happy. Based on what I saw on the first day in Canada and when I saw how you fight. I never knew you like this. But if that‚Äôs how you always do it then I think you should work on it. It doesn‚Äôt lead anywhere, only makes the other person feel like shit and not heard. I used to do it too, I still loose my cool from time to time, but it rarely happens. It is hard to learn, but it‚Äôs very rewarding and helpful in life‚Äù. I found this message funny because we literally got kicked out of an uber because of her in the middle of nowhere. I had already apologized for yelling at her on the first day, and I actually apologized to her twice. She could have brought this up during the trip, but she probably chose not to so she can enjoy her free accommodation, because she wouldn‚Äôt be able to afford it otherwise. When she called me she told me that it was the first time her boyfriend met me and I acted like that on the first day. She told me that I should want people to like me and no one will like me if I act like that. This is also amusing as I have friends from all over the world, meanwhile her friends are mostly Eastern Europeans. She also said that I don‚Äôt listen to people, which I completely disagree with, as you can see in this story, I did mention her point of view. The last thing she said was something along the lines of ‚ÄúThis could be the reason why your relationships don‚Äôt work out.‚Äù. This was the last straw. I reminded her that she had to sleep with her boyfriend for two years without a title or commitment, for him to even agree to be in a relationship with her. So she shouldn‚Äôt psychoanalyze anyone‚Äôs relationship issues. She hung up the phone on me and I blocked her phone number.¬†

The lack of self-awareness astonished me. There were other things that happened on this trip, for example she got mad that I didn‚Äôt let her drive my parent‚Äôs car and she didn‚Äôt want to hangout with my friends so I had to rearrange my plans to suit hers. I basically did everything for both of them during the trip and this is how they repaid me. Also, she didn‚Äôt pay for majority of ubers. On the way back, she asked me to take a six hour layover in Poland, telling me that she would spend time with me. As soon as we reached Poland, she took her boyfriend to the doctor, where we had to wait for an hour and a half, and right after that she dropped me at the airport and left. I had to wait there by myself for four hours, whereas I could have taken a flight with a three hour layover and been less tired. She just did this so she could get a free uber ride to the airport with me. So this is my story of a trip from hell. Sometimes you see your friend‚Äôs true colours when they get into a relationship. Please girls, don‚Äôt be like this. Don‚Äôt start treating your friends like shit just because you get into a relationship. That makes you an ungrateful asshole.¬†

I get a stomach ache if I smoke while I‚Äôm in the middle of something, and I don‚Äôt enjoy a morning smoke because of the aftertaste permeating my palate for the rest of the day.
